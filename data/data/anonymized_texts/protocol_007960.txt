Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 5  PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  Title A Phase II, Randomized, Double-Blind, Vehicle Controlled Study of the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of B244 Topical Spray for the Treatment of Pruritus in Adults with a History of Atopic Dermatitis Protocol Number PRB244-01 Sponsor AOBiome Therapeutics Development Phase II Study Objectives Primary objective:  ● To assess the efficacy of B244 in the treatment of pruritus in adults with a history of atopic dermatitis.  Secondary objectives:   ● To assess the safety and tolerability of B244 in adults with a history of atopic dermatitis.  Study Design This is a double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 2 doses of B244 for the treatment of pruritus in adults with a history of atopic dermatitis. Subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive twice daily topical doses of B244 at 1x1010 cells/ml (O.D. 5.0), 4 x1010 cells/ml (O.D. 20.0) or vehicle (control) for 4 weeks. The total duration of the study will be approximately 11 weeks. The study will be conducted at approximately 50 study sites.  At Screening and Baseline, all subjects must have atopic dermatitis, which involves a minimum of 10% and a maximum of 40% body surface area, score of ≥ 7 points on the NRS scale and static IGA of 2-3. The total duration of the study will be approximately 11 weeks. Participants will report for a Screening visit and if all inclusion/exclusion criteria are met, subjects will go through a two-week washout phase before reporting for a Baseline visit. At the baseline visit, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive B244 1x1010 cells/ml, B244 4x1010 cells/ml or vehicle. Subjects will come in for Week 2 and Week 4 visits. After completion of the 4-week treatment period, all subjects will enter a 4-week follow-up period. Participants

Efficacy Endpoints The key primary efficacy endpoint is as follows:  ● Mean change in WI-NRS from baseline to Week 4 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 9  Additional secondary efficacy endpoints include the following:  ● Proportion of subjects with ≥4 point improvement in WI-NRS from baseline to Week 4 ● Proportion of subjects with any improvement in WI-NRS from baseline to Week 4 ● Mean change in AI-NRS from baseline to Week 4 ● Proportion of subjects with ≥4 point improvement in AI-NRS from baseline to Week 4 ● Proportion of subjects with any improvement in AI-NRS from baseline to Week 4 ● Mean change in WI-NRS from baseline to Week 2 ● Proportion of subjects with ≥4 point improvement in WI-NRS from baseline to Week 2 ● Mean change in POEM from baseline to Week 4 ● Mean change in 5-D Pruritus Scale from baseline to Week 4 Exploratory endpoints include the following:  ● Mean change in IGA from baseline to Week 4 ● Mean change in EASI from baseline to Week 4 Safety Endpoints Safety and tolerability endpoints include the following:  ● Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) ● Changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters following study drug exposure ● Changes in local skin tolerability following application of study drug Assessment Schedule: All subjects will attend a screening visit not more than 21 days prior to Baseline (Day 0). Subjects will be required to return to the clinic at Baseline, Day 14 (Week 2) and Day 28 (Week 4). All subjects will be asked to attend a Week 8 follow-up visit 4 weeks (28 days (±3) days) after the last dose of study medication. Statistical Considerations: Sample Size: Approximately 576 subjects may be enrolled to account for 16.7% drop out rate prior to completing the study.  A total of 160 evaluable subjects per group (480 total) are required to achieve at least 80% to detect a pairwise difference of 0.65 in mean WI-NRS change from baseline to Week 4 between one of two active doses of B244 and vehicle control when assuming a standard deviation of 2.5 and applying a Dunnett 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 10  Testing Method at a one-sided familywise error rate of 0.10. Populations:  ● ITT population:  All subjects who are enrolled and apply at least 1 dose of study treatment will be included in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population.  The ITT population will be the primary population for safety and efficacy assessments. ● Per Protocol (PP) population:  All subjects in the ITT population without any protocol deviations that may have an impact on the efficacy assessments, who complete their Week 4 visit, and who administer at least 50% of investigational product (IP), will be included in the Per Protocol (PP) population. ● Safety Population:  All subjects treated with at least one dose of IP.  Efficacy Analysis:  Efficacy analysis will be performed on the ITT population with some supportive analysis on the PP population.  Regression models will include all eligible subjects for the respective analysis, from the 3 treatment arms.   Hypothesis tests for the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed using a Dunnett Testing Method, applying pairwise comparisons of each respective B244 dose group to vehicle using a one-sided familywise error rate of 0.10.  No additional adjustments will be made for multiple testing.   Additional supportive analyses may be performed combining the B244 dose groups in comparison against vehicle and comparison of the B244 groups to one another.   The frequency and rate of NRS responders at Week 4 (≥4 point change from baseline in NRS) will be reported and compared between treatment groups using a logistic regression model. Continuous measures of change from baseline to Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 8 for AI-NRS and WI-NRS; and change from baseline to Week 2, Week 4, Week 8 for POEM and 5-D Pruritus Scale will be analyzed using mixed models with repeated measures (MMRM) to account for within-subject variability over time.  Comparisons at each time point will be performed within the longitudinal model. Safety Analysis:   
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 11  Analysis of safety measures will be performed on the Safety Population, including all treated subjects.  The incidence of all adverse events (AEs) and treatment-related AEs will be tabulated by treatment received. These AEs will be classified by system organ class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The incidence and severity of changes in local tolerability and adverse reactions will be collected as a solicited AE of special interest.  For incidence reporting, if a subject reported more than one AE that was coded to the same system organ class or preferred term, the subject will be counted only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term. An overview of AEs, which includes subject incidence of AEs, treatment-related AEs, AEs by severity, SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation, will be presented.   Summaries of IP exposure, clinical laboratory measures, vital signs, rescue medications, and concomitant medications will be presented. Study Sites Approximately 50 study sites  Expected Duration of Subject’s Participation Approximately 11 weeks: Up to 3 weeks of screening, 4 weeks of treatment, and a follow-up period of 4 weeks.   This study will be conducted in accordance with the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).

Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 18  2 INTRODUCTION 2.1 Background Ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) are essential for the initial step in environmental nitrification processes, specifically the oxidation of ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (NO2-). Nitrosomonas are Gram-negative chemolithoautotrophic betaproteobacteria that obtain energy solely from NH3 oxidation, while fixing CO2 for their carbon needs2. Oxidation of NH3 proceeds in two steps (Figure 1) leading to sequential generation of hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and NO2- that require two enzyme complexes: the membrane-bound ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) comprised of subunits AmoA, AmoB and AmoC; and the periplasmic NH2OH oxidoreductase (HAO). In addition to high NO2- levels, NH3 oxidation leads to nitric oxide (NO) and N2O production through two independent pathways downstream of NH2OH production: nitrifier denitrification and NH2OH oxidation3.  Figure 1 Nitrifier Denitrification Pathway 
 B244 is a purified a strain of Nitrosomonas eutropha originally isolated from soil samples. Sequencing of the B244 genome revealed a distinct genetic profile from that of other published Nitrosomonas strains and AOB genomes. Based on in vitro co-culture studies, B244 was able to reduce survival of pathogenic bacteria. Nitrite generation from ammonia concurrently with medium acidification by B244 led to strong antibacterial effects and a marked reduction (~100-fold) in viable counts of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two pathogens frequently isolated from infected skin and wound sites. In contrast, control cultures with B244 in the absence of ammonium or with heat-killed B244 supplemented with ammonium, had no antibacterial effects. The unique metabolic and antimicrobial activity of Nitrosomonas, in combination with their lack of virulence render these bacteria as attractive candidates for topical delivery of nitrite and nitric oxide on human skin with potential to improve health in both normal and abnormal skin conditions or wound sites. NO-releasing drugs or NO donors have also shown activity against Propionibacterium acnes and other pathogenic bacteria, anti-inflammatory activity, and inhibition of lipogenesis by insulin-stimulated immortal sebocytes4-6.   2.2 Clinical Experience B244 is being developed as a ‘live topical’ to provide a natural source of AOB and NO/NO2 to the human skin.   

 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 19  AOBiome’s first Phase 1b/2a clinical trial titled, “A Double Blind, Vehicle-Controlled, Single Center, Randomized, Sequential, Ascending 14-Day Multiple Dose Study in Subjects with Acne Vulgaris to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Preliminary Efficacy of B244 Delivered as a Topical Spray” was completed in 2016 where 36 participants with clinical diagnosis of facial acne vulgaris were randomized to receive ascending doses of investigational product (IP) over 14 days. Safety analyses have been completed and there has been no attributable drug related SAEs reported.  In addition, a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial titled, “A Randomized, Double Blinded, Phase IIb/III, Decentralized Study of B244 Delivered as a Topical Spray to Determine Safety and Efficacy in Participants with Mild to Moderate Acne Vulgaris in 372 patients with clinical diagnosis of facial acne” has been completed.  B244 was safe and well tolerated with no attributable drug related SAEs.  Efficacy was supported by statistically significant 2-point reduction in IGA with B244 and a trend in the reduction of the number of inflammatory lesions compared to vehicle.   A study titled, “A Prospective, Vehicle Controlled, Double Blind, Multicenter, Randomized, Phase II Study of B244 Delivered as a Topical Spray to Determine Safety and Efficacy in Subjects with Mild to Moderate Atopic Dermatitis” has recently been completed.  A total of 122 subjects were enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive B244 or vehicle in the study. Overall, there were no unexpected safety signals observed following treatment with B244. A total of 30 (25%) subjects experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) during the study, including 16 (26%) subjects in the B244 treatment group and 14 (23%) subjects in the vehicle group.   AOBiome completed a Phase Ib study in pediatric and adolescent subjects aged 2-17 years of age. A study titled, “An Open-label, Multicenter, Phase Ib Study of B244 Delivered as a Topical Spray to Assess Safety in Pediatric Subjects aged 2 to 17 years with Atopic Dermatitis” enrolled a total of 28 subjects across 3 cohorts.  Overall, there were no unexpected safety signals observed following treatment with B244 in pediatric subjects with atopic dermatitis. The B244 spray was well tolerated and not associated with any increased pain or redness at the application site.  “A Vehicle-Controlled, Double-Blind, Randomized Phase II Study of B244 Delivered as a Topical Spray to Determine Safety and Efficacy in Subjects with Mild to Moderate Rosacea” has been completed with a total of 140 subjects randomized. Generally, there were no unexpected safety signals observed following treatment with B244. Overall, 31 (22.1) subjects had experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event of which 19 (26.0%) subjects in B244 spray group and 12 (17.9%) in the Vehicle group.  In addition, other topical development programs with B244 include hypertension.  A study titled, “A Prospective, Controlled, Double Blinded, Multicenter, Randomized, Vehicle Controlled, Phase II Study of B244 Delivered as a Topical Spray to Determine Safety and Efficacy in Subjects with Elevated Blood Pressure” has been completed.  Safety data indicated that B244 was safe and well tolerated.  Overall, 16% of subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE during the study with comparable incidence in the B244 and Vehicle groups.  Overall, there were no unexpected safety signals observed following treatment with B244.  
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 20  Moreover, intranasal application of B244 is being developed for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and migraines.  A rat toxicology study performed by intranasal administration of B244 twice daily for 28 days found that B244 was safe and well tolerated in rats at levels of up to the maximum dose 8x109 cell/mL.  A study titled, “A Prospective, Controlled, Double Blinded, Single Center, Randomized, 3 arm, Phase 1b/2a Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Preliminary Efficacy of B244 Delivered as an Intranasal Spray in Healthy Volunteers and Subjects with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis” has been completed.  In addition, a study titled “A Prospective, Randomized, Vehicle-Controlled, Double-Blind, Phase 2 Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of B244 Delivered as an Intranasal Spray for Preventive Treatment in Subjects with Episodic Migraine” is in progress.  2.3 Safety Profile To date, there have been no reported infections or health risks associated with topical application or ingestion of Nitrosomonas species.  The absence of any illnesses attributed to these bacteria despite our widespread exposure indicates that they pose a minimal health risk, if any at all.  Infection or tissue damage by Nitrosomonas is unlikely, because the sequenced genomes of several Nitrosomonas and other AOB lack genes encoding cytotoxins, or other known bacterial virulence factors.  Further, AOB are slow growing, as compared to most heterotrophic bacteria, with optimum doubling times of 8 hours or higher.  In particular, Nitrosomonas growth is rate limited by the availability of ammonia requiring the oxidation of 27 moles NH3/mole CO2 fixed.  Due to their dependence on ammonia for their growth, the numbers of Nitrosomonas on the skin will be necessarily limited and naturally regulated by the amount of ammonia produced in sweat.  This would ensure that the amount of nitrite and NO generated would be relatively low, without any adverse effects.   2.4 Rationale for the Study Eczema or Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory skin condition that affects nearly 20% of children and between 2-10% of adults7. Disease prevalence has steadily grown in the last 30 years, resulting in a growing field of atopic dermatitis research8.   Pruritus is a common morbidity associated with Atopic Dermatitis, and its management remains a challenge for physicians. Pruritus is defined as an urge or unpleasant sensation that produces the urge to scratch9. Modern treatment no longer consists of antihistamines alone. Anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, as well as antipruritic therapies to address the epidermal barrier as well as immunomodulation or infection are now used in clinical practice9.  Mild pruritus may be controlled with topical therapies, while moderate to severe pruritus requires combination treatment, consisting of antipruritic and immunosuppressive drugs, phototherapy, and topical compounds9.  While the complete pathophysiology of pruritus remains unclear, histamines are one of the most potent mediators in AD related pruritus. The itch cycle exacerbates damage to the epidermal barrier leading to water loss and dryness, thereby creating a hospitable environment for skin 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 21  pathogens, which cause infections and flare up symptoms. Staphylococcus aureus is consistently found in eczematous skin lesions in patients with AD. Correlation between the severity of the disease and presence of Staphylococcus aureus has been well established and it has been shown that the presence of bacteria is an important factor in skin aggravation10. The goal of therapy for AD is to restore the epidermal barrier function and reduce skin inflammation, thereby alleviating symptoms and intensity of AD associated pruritus. However, systemic antibiotic use is controversial.  B244 has been developed as a topical application of a natural source of AOB and NO/NOx to the human skin.  We hypothesize that application of AOB to eczematous skin may reduce Staphylococcus aureus skin load and normalize the inflammatory response by reducing Th2 activation. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of B244 in the treatment of pruritus in adults with a history of atopic dermatitis. 3 STUDY OBJECTIVES 3.1 Primary Objective ● To assess the efficacy of B244 in the treatment of pruritus in adults with a history of atopic dermatitis.  3.2 Secondary Objectives ● To assess the safety and tolerability of B244 in adults with a history of atopic dermatitis. 4 ENDPOINTS 4.1 Efficacy 4.1.1 Primary ● Mean change in WI-NRS from baseline to Week 4 4.1.2 Secondary ● Proportion of patients with ≥4 point improvement in WI-NRS from baseline to Week 4 ● Proportion of subjects with any improvement in WI-NRS from baseline to Week 4 ● Mean change in AI-NRS from baseline to Week 4 ● Proportion of subjects with ≥4 point improvement in AI-NRS from baseline to Week 4 ● Proportion of subjects with any improvement in AI-NRS from baseline to Week 4 ● Mean change in WI-NRS from baseline to Week 2 ● Proportion of subjects with ≥4 point improvement in WI-NRS from baseline to Week 2 ● Mean change in POEM from baseline to Week 4 ● Mean change in 5-D Pruritus Scale from baseline to Week 4 4.1.3 Exploratory

Participants will report for a Screening visit and if all inclusion/exclusion criteria are met, subjects will go through a two-week washout phase (see Section 10.6.2) before reporting for a Baseline visit.   ● After screening and baseline, participants will be randomized to one of two doses of B244 or vehicle application for 4 weeks.  ● Randomization will be 1:1:1 so that an equal number of patients will be treated in each Arm of the study. ● All B244 randomized subjects will be treated at the dose of 1x1010 cells/ml (O.D. 5.0) or 4x1010 cells/ml (O.D. 20.0). ● Subjects must be willing and able to complete diary within a consistent time frame on a daily basis and to comply with restrictions on allowable therapies for the duration of the study.  ● All subjects will attend a screening visit not more than 21 days prior to Baseline (Day 0). Subjects will be required to return to the clinic at Baseline, Day 14 (Week 2) and Day 28 (Week 4) visits. All subjects will be asked to attend a Week 8 follow-up visit 4 weeks (28 (±3) days) after the last dose of study medication. ● Subjects will apply a total of 10 pumps of IP per application across all affected areas twice-a-day (i.e. 10 pumps in the morning and 10 pumps again at night) for 4 weeks. ● Safety evaluations will consist of review of participant’s medical history at screening and on-going assessment of adverse events reported throughout the study duration.

Informed Consent Forms for enrolled participants and for participants who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the study site in secure study files. Consent will be obtained by trained research study staff trained in taking informed consent. The study will be explained with the opportunity for the participant to ask questions. If a participant wishes to enter the study, a consent form will be completed and signed.  7.2 Screening for Eligibility After informed consent has been obtained, to determine participant eligibility for enrollment in the study, screening assessments will be performed within 1 week (-21 to -14 days) prior to starting the Washout period (-14 to -1). All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that participants meet all eligibility criteria before Washout period and subsequent randomization on Day 0. Subjects will be asked to undergo a 2 week (-14 to -1) washout period prior to the Baseline procedure. During the screening, washout, treatment and follow-up periods, subjects will be asked to stop utilizing bleach or vinegar as a pruritus or atopic dermatitis therapy, as well as any other treatments described in the exclusion criteria and the Excluded Medications/Therapy (Appendix B).  All screening assessments are listed in the Time and Events Table (Appendix A).  A participant must meet all inclusion criteria, and none of the exclusion criteria, to be enrolled and randomized in this study. The Investigator and team will maintain a screening log to record details of all persons screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  7.3 Study Withdrawal and Withdrawal from Investigational Product and Stopping Criteria   
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 26  A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator. Reasons for withdrawal (participants who refuse to complete any remaining study visits) or discontinuation (participants who prematurely stop the application) at any time during the study may include, but are not limited, to the following:  ● For safety reasons, either at the discretion of the Investigator or at the participant’s request ● For protocol violations at the discretion of AOBiome ● Withdrawal of consent by the Subject ● Lost to follow-up ● Due to use of concomitant therapy that could interfere with the results of the study (the Investigator will report all such information through the CRF and decide, in accordance with AOBiome, whether the participant is to be withdrawn).   The reason for participant study withdrawal will be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). Data from participants withdrawing from the study will be considered evaluable up to the point at which they are withdrawn using the same criteria for evaluability as for participants who complete the study.  Study stopping rules will be implemented to stop the study for safety review in the event that: • 1 subject reports death, or • >2 subjects report an SAE, or • >4 subjects experience grade 3 AEs of a similar type, or • >6 subjects experience grade 2 AEs of a similar type  when the reported SAEs or AEs are considered possibly, probably, definitely or related to the investigational product.   Atopic Dermatitis is an active disease with known seasonal and personal histories of flares and exacerbations of the patient’s underlying disease state. This includes personal histories of worsening itch and itch-scratch cycles, which can lead to localized infection and localized cellulitis. A subject’s known and collected clinical history should be considered by the principal investigator when determining relationship of event to the investigational product.  7.4 Early Termination Early termination from the study may occur due to loss to follow-up or withdrawal of consent by the subject. Participants who have discontinued the study early will be evaluated by the Investigator at the Early Termination Visit.  See the list of assessments to be performed at the Early Termination Visit in the Time and Events Table (Appendix A). Participants with ongoing AEs or SAEs believed to be possibly related to investigational product (IP) will continue to be followed until resolution or for 30 days as warranted by the nature of the AE.  
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 27  7.5 Lifestyle Considerations There are no dietary or activity related restrictions for this study. 7.5.1 Use of Bland Emollients During the Study  Subjects will be allowed to use their usual choice of bland emollients (e.g., lotion, moisturizer) from screening to follow-up, on an as needed basis, using specific time of use guidelines in relation to study medication application.  Subjects will be allowed to use their emollient of choice at a similar dose and frequency throughout the study if used.  Any clinically significant changes in type, dose, or frequency of bland emollients will not be allowed during the study.  A detailed guideline will be shared with the sites and subjects to ensure consistency in study medication treatment application and relation to body washing, emollient use, and other chemical exposure to skin.  Subjects will be encouraged not to use sunscreen on the treated lesions during participation in the study. Sunscreen should be used minimally or used sparingly while in the active treatment phase (Baseline to Week 4) of the study.  Alternatively, sunscreen should be washed off prior to study medication use.  Subjects who do not have atopic dermatitis on their face may apply makeup as needed. However, those subjects who have atopic dermatitis on their face and require to use makeup will be advised to use it minimally.  8 STUDY TREATMENT 8.1 Investigational Product Under normal conditions of handling and administration, IP is not expected to pose significant safety risks to site staff. A Material Safety Data Sheet describing the occupational hazards and recommended handling precautions will be provided to site staff if required by local laws or will otherwise be available from the Sponsor upon request.  Investigational product must be stored in a secure area under the appropriate physical conditions for the product (2-8oC). Access to and administration of the IP will be limited to the Investigator and authorized site staff. Investigational product must be dispensed or administered only to participants enrolled in the study and in accordance with this protocol (see Section 8.6).  The Investigator is responsible for study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance. The Investigator or designated site personnel must maintain study treatment accountability records throughout the course of the study. The responsible person(s) will document the amount of study treatment received from and returned to the sponsor and the amount administered to participants. The required accountability unit for this study will be the

Physical description: Odorless, cloudy, light pink suspension Odorless, cloudy, light pink suspension Odorless, clear, and colorless suspension Manufacturer/source of procurement: AOBiome, LLC AOBiome, LLC AOBiome, LLC  The contents of the label will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. B244 and matching vehicle will be packaged in identical 30 ml white bottles.   8.2 Dose Changes  No dose changes are anticipated.  8.3 Storage conditions  
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 29  All investigational drug supplies in the study will be stored in a secure, refrigerated (2-8°C) safe place, under the responsibility of the Investigator or other authorized individual.   8.4 Description of Blinding Method This study will be double-blinded: neither Investigator(s), nor study participants, nor those involved in the conduct of the trial (including sponsor staff) will be aware of the treatment the participants are receiving.  The appearance of B244 and vehicle dispensing containers will be identical.  8.5 Treatment Assignments: This is a double-blind study. Participants will be assigned to study treatment in accordance with the randomization schedule generated for the allocation of B244 or vehicle prior to the initiation of the trial. Randomization will be centrally-based and performed using an appropriate IWRS (an automated randomization system).   Each participant scheduled to receive investigational product (IP) will receive a randomization number at the time of randomization. The randomization number will be used to identify the study medication kit assigned to the participant and indicate the treatment to be administered to that participant.      8.6 Treatment Compliance Study treatment must be dispensed or administered according to procedures described herein. Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study treatment. Only authorized site personnel may supply study treatment. Participants will record use of the study medication utilizing the study diary at the time of use each day. Participants will review study medication compliance with the Investigator or designee. Any missed doses, timing, and reason for missed dose will be recorded in the eCRF. There should be no doubling of doses to make up for missed doses. If a dose is missed, the next dose of study medication should be taken as scheduled.  Each site participating in the trial will be instructed to assess subject’s compliance by weighing the investigational product at the Baseline visit, Week 2 visit, and Week 4 visit and followed every time study medication is dispensed and returned per instructions below. Sites will be provided scales, which will be calibrated prior to each use. Study personnel will be instructed to record measurements into the eCRF.  All weight measurements will be performed without the safety cap.  Subjects will be dispensed 2 bottles upon randomization, and each bottle will be labeled 1 and 2 with a permanent marker at the site.  Unused Bottle 1 will be vortexed, primed, and weighed without the cap by the site per treatment application instructions and dispensed to the subject who will mix and apply the first dose at the site under study staff supervision.  Bottle 2 will also be vortexed, primed, and weighed at the site at the time of dispense without the cap, the cap inserted back on the bottle, 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 30  and the bottle returned to its carton unused. After the first treatment application of Bottle 1, subjects will take home both bottles where they will place Bottle 1 on the counter at room temperature for in-home application twice a day until empty.   Bottle 2 will be stored in the refrigerator until Bottle 1 is empty, at which point Bottle 2 will be taken out of the refrigerator, mixed per treatment application instructions, and used.  Should Bottle 1 run out during a treatment application, the subject will count the number of pumps that were made with Bottle 1 and complete the remaining number of pumps needed to achieve a total of 10 pumps using Bottle 2.    At the Week 2 visit, subjects will return any empty bottle (likely Bottle 1 since each bottle should last approximately 10 days and the subject should be on Bottle 2 at the time of visit) to the site for weight measurement (without the safety cap) to confirm usage.  At this visit, a third bottle of the same treatment group will be labeled as Bottle 3 and will be vortexed, primed, and weighed at the site at the time of dispense without the cap, the cap inserted back on the bottle, and the bottle returned to its carton unused.  The subject will be dispensed Bottle 3 to take home and store in the refrigerator until Bottle 2 is empty, at which point Bottle 3 is taken out of the refrigerator and used on the counter until the Week 4 visit.  All empty bottles returned to the site will be collected and stored by the site in ambient temperature until return to the drug depot. If the subject is still on Bottle 1 at the Week 2 visit, the site will confirm daily dosing application and retrain the subject on the appropriate use of IP application, and the subject will continue using Bottle 1 until empty, at which point Bottle 2 is taken out of the refrigerator and used on the counter until Bottle 2 is empty, after which Bottle 3 is taken out of the refrigerator and used on the counter until the Week 4 visit.  Any bottle currently in use at the time of the Week 2 visit should not be returned to the site.    At the Week 4 visit, all used and unused bottles will be returned to the site for weight measurements and storage at the site in ambient temperature until return to the drug depot.    8.7 Treatment Application Subjects will receive study drug for application throughout the study. Subjects will be instructed in the use of the spray bottle and asked to self-administer the Investigational Product following a detailed instruction on treatment application that will be shared with the sites and subjects to ensure consistency in treatment application and relation to body washing, emollient use, and other chemical exposure to skin.  Key guidelines include:  ● The subject should wash his/her hands before applying study treatment. ● Subjects will apply a total of 10 pumps of IP per application to all affected. areas twice-a-day (i.e., 10 pumps in the morning and 10 pumps again at night). ● The subject will apply the IP to the affected area twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart) for 28 consecutive days. ● Subject should mix the bottle thoroughly per instructions provided before each application and then saturate the application area well, holding the bottle approximately 6 inches away from the skin. 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 31  ● Subjects will be asked to let the product air dry after each application. ● Subjects will follow instructions provided for body washing, emollient use, and other chemical exposure to skin in relation to timing of IP application. ● The spray bottle in use may be stored at ambient temperature until used up, while additional unused bottles will be stored in the refrigerator until use.  DO NOT FREEZE. ● The subject will apply the IP to the worst and largest lesions first and then apply the IP to the smaller lesions. If after covering all lesions, the total number of pumps per application has not been exhausted, subject should go back and cover the worst lesions with the remaining number of pumps. However, the total number of 10 pumps allowed should not be exceeded per application.  ● Subjects will be asked not to expose the treatment kit to conditions which are unnatural or harmful to the product, such as excessive heat (temperatures over 77°F [25°C] and freezing temperatures below 32°F [ 0°C]). Subjects may travel with their study medication but should not leave it in a hot car, outside in the cold temperatures, etc. Subjects will also be asked not to tamper or cause damage to the IP bottle. 8.8 Treatment of Investigational Product Overdose The sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. Washing with conventional cleanser and water will remove the product. The Investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose.   8.9 Study Drug Discontinuation  Subjects will be discontinued from study drug treatment in the following events:  ● The subject experiences a Grade 2 or higher treatment emergent AE that is assessed as likely related to study drug  ● The subject receives treatment with an excluded therapy or has a clinically significant change in dose or frequency of allowed adjunctive therapies during the treatment period ● The female subject becomes pregnant or female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant or is breastfeeding  Discontinuation from study drug treatment may also occur for any of the following reasons:  ● Subject decision to discontinue study drug treatment, or subject decision to withdraw consent from the study  ● Any medical condition that may jeopardize the subject’s safety if study drug is continued, in the investigator’s and/or Sponsor’s opinion  ● Discontinuation is deemed to be in the best interest of the subject, in the investigator’s and/or Sponsor’s opinion  
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 32  Subjects who discontinue treatment with study drug prior to completing the treatment period will have an ETD visit within 7 days after their last dose of study drug in addition to a follow-up visit.  8.10 Product Accountability In accordance with federal and local regulatory requirements, the Investigator and designated site personnel must document the amount of investigational product dispensed to study participants, the amount returned by study participants, and amount received and returned to the sponsor, when applicable. Product accountability records must be maintained throughout the course of the trial. Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IP (deficient IP in condition, appearance, pertaining documentation, labeling, expiry date, etc.) should be promptly reported to the Sponsor, who will initiate a complaint procedure. All investigational product must be stored in a secure locked room with access limited to the Investigator and designated site personnel. Study product is to be stored in a refrigerator between 2-8°C. Maintenance of a temperature log is required. Under no circumstances will the Investigator allow IP to be used other than as directed by this Clinical Trial Protocol, or dispose of IP in any other manner.   8.11 Unblinding Procedures The Investigator may unblind a participant’s treatment assignment only in the case of emergency or in the event of a serious medical condition when knowledge of the study treatment is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the participant, as determined by the Investigator. It is preferred (but not required) that the Investigator first contacts the Medical Monitor to discuss options before unblinding the participant’s treatment assignment. The Investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as possible when a participant’s treatment assignment is unblinded without revealing the treatment assignment of the unblinded participant unless that information is deemed important for the safety of participants currently in the study. The date and reason for the unblinding must be documented in the participant’s study record.  The Medical Monitor may unblind the treatment assignment for any participant with an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identifying the participant’s treatment assignment, may be sent to clinical Investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or sponsor policy.  8.12 Retrieval and Destruction of Investigational Product All partially used or unused treatments will be returned to the site as brought by study participants. A detailed IP log of the returned IP shall be established.  The site will not destroy unused IP unless the Sponsor provides written authorization to the contrary. All used and unused bottles will be shipped to the authorized drug depot at the end of the study.  8.13 Concomitant and Excluded Therapies  
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 33  Any medication or vaccine (including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the subject is receiving within 30 days prior to screening and through the final study visit will be recorded on the appropriate CRF) along with:  ● Reason for use. ● Dates of administration including start and end dates. ● Dosage information including dose and frequency.  Any medications started during the study (including “as needed” medications) will be recorded in the concomitant medication list as soon as the Investigational Site will become aware of the medication being added.  Details of any medication taken by the subject outside of the study center will be reviewed by the Investigator or designee on each study center visit. The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy.  A list of excluded medications/therapy is provided in Appendix B.  Previous treatment of atopic dermatitis must be recorded irrespective of the term it was given. Acetaminophen is permitted for use any time during the study. Other concomitant medication may be considered on a case-by-case basis by the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor. Concomitant therapies include any therapies (including over-the-counter medications) used by a subject from initiation of study drug treatment through the follow-up period. A record of all medications used will be maintained for each subject throughout the study. Reported information will include a description of the type of drug, treatment period, dosing regimen, the route of administration, and drug indication.  8.13.1 Permitted Medications Subjects using oral contraceptives, hormone-replacement therapy, or other maintenance therapies that are not Excluded Therapies (Appendix B) may continue their use during the study.    Stable doses of the following therapies for pruritus and/or atopic dermatitis will be allowed as adjunctive therapies during the study:  ● Oral H1 antihistamines ● Bland emollients A detailed guideline will be shared with the sites and subjects to ensure consistency in study medication treatment application and relation to body washing, emollient use, and other chemical exposure to skin. 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 34  Low- or mid-potency topical corticosteroids will be allowed per subjects’ usual medication, frequency, and dose throughout the study from screening to washout, treatment, and follow-up periods as rescue medication up to 7 days per month.   Subjects using any of these adjunctive therapies should maintain their regimen without clinically significant changes in type, dose or frequency throughout the screening, treatment, and follow-up periods.  All participants will be screened for concomitant medications prior to inclusion into the study.  Any concomitant medication to treat adverse events will be recorded in the Concomitant Medication section of the eCRF.  8.13.2 Excluded Therapies Therapies and medications that are excluded from the initial Screening visit through the follow-up period are listed in Appendix B.  8.14 Rescue Medications 8.14.1 Rescue Medication Permitted During the Study Over the course of the study, the Investigator will monitor and evaluate subject’s condition and determine whether rescue therapy may be necessary.  The use of medications to treat a subject’s atopic dermatitis during the study will be permitted if a medical professional determines that it becomes medically necessary.  Such rescue treatment should not exceed 7 days per month for the duration of the trial (screening, washout, treatment, and follow-up), e.g., no more than 3 days total during the 2 week washout period, no more than 7 days total during the 4 week treatment period, and no more than 7 days total during the 4 week follow-up period.   If a subject requires treatment for more than 7 days per month or requires systemic therapy, they may be discontinued from the study.  Medications permitted are listed in Table 8.1. In the event of an atopic dermatitis or pruritus exacerbation in between visits, subjects should contact study staff as soon as they are able. Subjects should seek approval on the use of rescue medications.  In the event that the subject did not notify the study staff, every effort should be made by the subject to contact the PI or study staff as soon as feasible. The details of the medication should be recorded in the eDiary and transferred to the CRF.  Details recorded should include medication name, date of administration, dosage, and number of applications.

Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 36  Use of any excluded therapies will be recorded for subjects who receive them.  8.15 Handling of Investigational Product  Subjects will receive study IP in 30 ml white bottles. Each bottle will be anticipated for use over 10 days and brought to all study appointments. The IP bottle can be kept at room temperature while in use by the subject.   Subjects will be asked not to subject the treatment kit to conditions which are unnatural or harmful to the product, such as excessive heat (temperatures over 77°F (25°C)) and freezing temperatures (below 32°F (0°C)). Subjects may travel with their study medication but should not leave it in a hot car, outside in the cold temperatures, etc. Subjects will also be asked not to tamper or cause damage to IP.  9 CONTRACEPTION REQUIREMENTS  Effective contraception is required for all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant during study participation. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use an acceptable form of contraception for up to 2 weeks after the study completion as detailed. Women of childbearing potential are defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who is NOT permanently sterile (e.g., by tubal ligation) or postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as 12 consecutive months with no menses without an alternative medical cause.  Effective contraception methods include:  ● Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of an IUD or IUS or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy, for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception  ● Use of barrier methods (i.e., condom, diaphragm) used with a spermicide (i.e., foam, cream, or gel that kills sperm) ● Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the study participant).   Periodic abstinence (i.e., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.   Male participants of the study who are having sexual intercourse with a woman who can become pregnant must use an acceptable form of birth control while participating in the study. Additionally, male participants are expected to inform their female partners of their participation in a research study of an investigational drug, the effects of which on a fetus and on a pregnant woman are unknown. Male participants will also be expected to provide their female partners with the contraception requirements information previously described and the study doctor’s contact information for questions.  
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 37  Payment for all aspects of obstetrical care, child-or related care will be the study participant’s responsibility.   In case of pregnancy, Investigational Product should be discontinued and the Sponsor should be informed immediately. Follow-up of the pregnancy will be mandatory until the outcome is available. 10 STUDY PROCEDURES 10.1 Pre-screening procedures  Study subjects will be recruited from among participating hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic centers or from general population under the responsibility of a participating Investigator. Prior to initiation of the recruitment phase, participating Investigators will identify a pool of potential study subjects. Each of these centers will identify potentially eligible patients in advance, by either reviewing past medical records and diagnoses, screening in clinics, referral from other physicians, or other sources of recruitment, to identify those aged 18 to 65 with clinical diagnosis of mild or moderate Atopic Dermatitis. Medical records from patient’s dermatologist or primary care physician to confirm the diagnosis are optional. Verbal confirmation of the diagnosis present for > 12 months is sufficient to fulfill this criterion.   10.2 Informed Consent Procedures  Eligible participants may only be included in the study after providing a consent using the IRB-approved informed consent form. Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study-specific procedures (i.e., all of the procedures described in the protocol). The process of obtaining informed consent should be documented in the participant’s source documents. The date of signing of informed consent (and withdrawal, if later withdrawn) should be documented in the eCRF.  10.3 Study Assessments  Study activities will take place according to the Time and Events table (Appendix A).  Demographics and a complete medical history will be recorded during the Screening period. The medical history will include a complete review of all current diseases and their respective durations and treatments.  10.4 Inclusion procedures   Once all inclusion/exclusion criteria are fulfilled, the patient becomes eligible for randomization and inclusion into the treatment period. Treatment allocation will be performed as stated above 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 38  in Section 8.5. Study medication will be delivered as stated in Section 8.6. Patients will be counseled on product application and eDiary completion.   10.5 Timing of patient’s visits to the clinic Patients will be asked to report to the clinic for their scheduled appointments. If a subject is unable to schedule an appointment within the required time frame, study staff will be asked to reschedule the patient to a day when they are able to come in within predetermined time frame.   10.6 Description by type of visit 10.6.1 Screening Visit (-21 to -14) – Visit 1 ● informed consent completed and signed  ● inclusion and exclusion criteria  ● demographic data  ● medical/surgical history ● concomitant medications ● physical exam ● vital signs ● blood for clinical chemistry, serology and hematology ● urine pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential) ● NRS assessment ● POEM questionnaire ● Pruritus 5-D questionnaire ● IGA scoring assessment ● EASI scoring assessment ● study counseling ● start eDiary ● start AE monitoring 10.6.2 Washout Phase (-14 to -1) For those subjects who meet the eligibility criteria at the Screening visit and is determined by the Principal Investigator to be eligible for the study after the safety labs testing results are available, subjects will be notified by telephone to start the Washout period phase.  Subjects will be allowed to use their regular emollients if needed but will be asked to stop using bleach or vinegar baths. Stable doses of the following therapies for pruritus and/or atopic dermatitis will be allowed as adjunctive therapies during the study:  ● Oral H1 antihistamines ● Bland emollients 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 39  A detailed guideline will be shared with the sites and subjects to ensure consistency in study medication treatment application and relation to body washing, emollient use, and other chemical exposure to skin. Low- or mid-potency topical corticosteroids will be allowed per subjects’ usual medication, frequency, and dose during the washout period but no more than 7 days per month as rescue medication.   Subjects using any of these adjunctive therapies should maintain their regimen without clinically significant changes in type, dose or frequency throughout the screening, treatment, and follow-up periods.  Subjects will be prohibited from using Excluded Medications/Therapy listed in Appendix B. ● phone call to subjects ● study counseling  10.6.3 Study Day 0-Baseline visit (0) – Visit 2 ● inclusion and exclusion criteria  ● concomitant medications ● medical history ● vital signs ● urine pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential) ● NRS assessment ● POEM questionnaire ● Pruritus 5-D questionnaire ● IGA scoring assessment ● EASI scoring assessment ● allocation of a randomized treatment kit number via IWRS ● delivery of the corresponding Investigational Product  ● obtain study medication weight for Investigational Product compliance ● first application of Investigational Product (under medical supervision)  ● study counseling ● eDiary review ● recording of AEs if any 10.6.4 Day 5- Phone call to patient The Day 5 visit is a telephone visit that occurs 5 days (±2 days) after the Baseline visit.

Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 41     10.6.8 Early Termination Visit Every attempt should be made to complete all visits during the defined window periods. Subjects who do not complete all required study visits and withdraw from the study before the Day 56 final visit will be asked to complete the Early Termination Visit.  During the visit, the following will be obtained:  ● concomitant medications  ● vital signs ● physical exam ● urine pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential) ● NRS assessment ● POEM questionnaire ● Pruritus 5-D questionnaire ● IGA scoring assessment ● EASI scoring assessment ● blood for clinical chemistry and hematology (if visit occurs before Day 28) ● eDiary ● collect study medication (if visit occurs before Day 28) ● obtain study medication weight for Investigational Product compliance ● recording of AEs if any 11 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 11.1 Safety Assessments 11.1.1 Vital Signs  Vital signs will include measurements of heart rate, sitting blood pressure, respiration rate, and temperature. Vital signs will be assessed as outlined in Appendix A and at unscheduled study visits when clinically indicated. The subjects’ height and weight will be measured as outlined in Appendix A.  11.1.2 Physical Examinations  The physical examination will be performed at Screening, Day 56, and at any Unanticipated visit should one occur as outlined in Appendix A. The physical examination includes an assessment of general appearance and a review of systems (dermatologic, head, eyes, ears, nose, mouth/throat/neck, thyroid, lymph nodes, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, extremities, musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems).  
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 42  11.1.3 Laboratory Assessments Blood samples should be taken using standard venipuncture techniques. Blood sampling will be performed according to the site SOPs.  The following laboratory variables will be determined as outlined below:  The following routine clinical chemistry, hematology and Lipid Panel will be performed according to Time and Events table (Appendix A): Albumin, Alkaline Phosphatase, ALT, AST, Total Bilirubin, BUN, BUN:Creatinine ratio, Calcium, Chloride, Creatinine, eGFR, Glucose, Potassium, Sodium, Uric Acid, Total Protein, Bicarbonate  Lipid Panel: HDL Cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, Total Cholesterol, Triglycerides, VLDL Cholesterol, LDL/HDL Cholesterol Ratio, Non-HDL Cholesterol.  Urinalysis: Color, clarity, pH, specific gravity, bilirubin, glucose, ketones, leukocytes, nitrite, blood, protein, urobilinogen, microscopic analysis.          Hematology: WBC, RBC, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Platelets, WBC Differential (Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils, Basophils)  Serology will only be done at Screening: HIV Ab, HCV Ab, and HBsAg.   Pregnancy testing: All females of childbearing potential will have a local urine pregnancy test performed at specified visits.   Patients will be asked to fast for at least 8 hours before all blood tests are done. An exception will be made on the laboratory testing for the screening visit such that either fasting or non-fasting blood samples can be collected.  This is to avoid requesting participants to fast prior to the informed consent.    The total blood volume collected for clinical labs for Screening visit will be approximately 20 ml of whole blood. Volume collected for subsequent visits would be approximately 10 ml of whole blood.   Any value outside the normal range will be flagged for the attention of the Investigator or designee at the site. The Investigator or designee will indicate whether or not the value is of clinical significance. If the result of the clinical chemistry test from the samples taken during the screening phase is indicated as clinically significant, the study subject will NOT be allowed into the study.   11.2 Efficacy Assessments 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 43  Efficacy endpoints will be descriptively summarized and will include the number of observations, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum of scores/values at all applicable time points and for all treatments in the ITT Population. 11.2.1 EASI Assessment An EASI score is used to measure the extent (area) and severity of atopic eczema (Eczema Area and Severity Index). The score will be calculated at the times indicated in the Time and Events Table (Appendix A). The investigator will assess improvement of eczema based on intensity and severity of the disease. EASI score sheet can be found in Appendix C.  The severity strata for the EASI are as follows:  0 = clear 0·1-1·0 = almost clear 1·1-7·0 = mild 7·1-21·0 = moderate 21·1-50·0 = severe 50·1-72·0 = very severe   11.2.2 Patient Oriented Eczema Measure The POEM is a tool developed by the University of Nottingham, United Kingdom, for monitoring atopic dermatitis severity (Appendix D). The subject will complete the questionnaire at each of the assessment timepoints as outlined in Appendix A. Each of the 7 questions in the POEM questionnaire carries equal weight and is scored from 0 to 4: ● No days = 0. ● 1 to 2 days = 1. ● 3 to 4 days = 2. ● 5 to 6 days = 3. ● Every day = 4. Scores are then added to yield a total score of 0 to 28; higher scores mean the greater the severity of atopic dermatitis. 11.2.3 Itch Numeric Rating Scale The Itch NRS is a validated, self-reported instrument for measurement of itch intensity. It uses a 24-hour recall period and asks subjects to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable). Higher scores indicate greater itch intensity. In this study, both worst itch intensity (WI-NRS) and average itch intensity (AI-NRS) during a 24-hour recall period will be captured. Subjects will record their Itch NRS scores once 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 44  daily via eDiary throughout the screening, treatment, and follow-up periods, as outlined in Appendix A.  The question for WI-NRS would be, “Please rate the itching severity due to your atopic dermatitis by circling the number that best describes your worst level of itching in the past 24 hours.”  The question for AI-NRS would be, “Please rate the itching severity due to your atopic dermatitis by circling the number that best describes your average level of itching in the past 24 hours.”  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  0 = No itching        10 = Worst itch imaginable  11.2.4 Investigator Global Assessment Score (IGA) IGA will be performed at the times indicated (Screening, Baseline, Day 14, Day 28, and Day 56) in the Time and Events Table of the Protocol (Appendix A) as static IGA. The Investigator will assess improvement of Atopic Dermatitis based on the 5-point severity scale summarized below and in Appendix E.     11.2.5 5-D Pruritus Scale The 5-D Pruritus Scale is a validated, multi-dimensional measure of itching that assesses the five domains of degree, duration, direction, disability and distribution (Appendix F). Subjects rate their symptoms over the preceding 2-week period on a 1 to 5 scale, with 5 being the most affected. Subjects will complete the 5-D Pruritus Scale during study visits as outlined in Appendix A.  11.3 eDiary and Efficacy Assessments All patient reported outcomes and clinical outcome assessments (ePRO/eCOA) will be obtained electronically using either a smartphone application or a tablet.  Participants will be provided with eDiary at screening to initiate daily diary entries from screening to follow-up and will include responses to WI-NRS, AI-NRS, daily dose confirmation (during the treatment period), 

 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 45  rescue medication (if any), and local skin tolerability (Day 1 to Day 7 of treatment).  In addition, participants’ usual adjunctive therapies (e.g., bland emollient, oral H-1 antihistamine) may be collected using eDiary or CRF at screening and optionally throughout the study.  POEM and 5-D Pruritus Scale will be reported by the participants at the designated site visits using a site provided tablet.  IGA and EASI will also be assessed at the designated site visits by the clinician. 11.4 Patient Reported Local Tolerability Solicited local adverse reactions (e.g., itching, new rash, pain, tenderness, stinging, skin color change, etc.) and severity from subjects will be collected during the first week of treatment using eDiary with the questions outlined in Appendix G to inform local skin tolerability.  11.5 Pregnancy Reporting Any pregnancy will be reported by study participants during their study participation. Participants who report pregnancy or lactation during the review of inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to randomization will not be enrolled in the trial. In case of pregnancy, Investigational Product should be discontinued and the Sponsor informed. Follow-up of the pregnancy will be mandatory until the outcome is available.  11.6 Study Completion A completed participant is one who has completed all study visits. Day 56 study visit is defined as the participant’s last visit. 11.7 Subject Withdrawal Criteria A subject may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for safety, behavioral, or administrative reasons.  Reasons for withdrawal (subjects who refuse to return for any remaining study visits) or discontinuation (subjects who prematurely stop the application) at any time during the study may include, but are not limited, to the following:  ● For safety reasons, either at the discretion of the Investigator or at the subject’s request ● For protocol violations at the discretion of AOBiome ● Due to concomitant therapy that could interfere with the results of the study (the Investigator will report all such information on the CRFs and decide, in accordance with AOBiome, whether the subject is to be withdrawn).   All premature discontinuations and their causes must be carefully documented by the Investigator on the CRF or if needed on the AE form.    If, for any reason, a subject is withdrawn before completing the final visit, the reason for termination will be entered on the CRF.  All data gathered on the subject prior to termination will 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 46  be made available to AOBiome. Subjects not completing the entire study should be fully evaluated when possible.  The appropriate CRFs should be completed.  If the subject chooses to withdraw before completing the study, the subject should notify the study coordinator who will instruct the subject on completion of assessments for End of Study (EOS) visit.  For subjects who refuse to complete the assessments for their early termination, every attempt must be made to check on their status, using any mode of communication such as telephone, email, fax, or text.  12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 12.1 Sample Size Approximately 576 subjects may be enrolled to account for 16.7% drop out rate prior to completing the study.  A total of 160 evaluable subjects per group (480 total) are required to achieve at least 80% power to detect a pairwise difference of 0.65 in mean WI-NRS change from baseline to Week 4 between one of two active doses of B244 and vehicle control when assuming a standard deviation of 2.5 and applying a Dunnett Testing Method at a one-sided familywise error rate of 0.10.  12.2 Populations for Analysis Intent to Treat (ITT): All randomized participants who apply at least 1 dose of study medication. Subjects will be grouped as randomized.   Per Protocol: All subjects in the ITT population without any major protocol deviations that may have an impact on the efficacy assessments, who complete their Week 4 visit, and who administer at least 50% of investigational product (IP). Subjects will be grouped as treated. Safety: All subjects who apply at least 1 dose of study medication. Subjects will be grouped as treated. 12.3 Data Analysis A separate statistical analysis plan will be developed. All data collected will be documented using summary tables, figures, and/or patient data listings. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (number (n), mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum) will be presented. For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented. As appropriate, a 95% CI will be presented. Graphical displays will be presented, as appropriate.  Data will be presented by treatment group and overall. Descriptive statistics for each treatment group will be provided for clinical laboratory values (e.g., hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis) and vital signs data, presented as both actual values and changes from baseline relative to each on-study evaluation. Abnormal clinical laboratory values will be listed.  
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 47  12.3.1 Disposition A tabulation of the disposition of subjects will be presented, including the number enrolled, the number randomized, the number treated, and the reasons for study discontinuation. Summaries of the number in each analysis set will be presented. Entry criteria violations and protocol deviations will be listed. 12.3.2 Demographic and Baseline Demographic and baseline characteristic data summarization will be performed in order to descriptively assess the comparability of treatment groups. Data to be tabulated will include age, race, ethnicity, height, weight, and BMI, as well as baseline characteristics related to medical history. 12.4 Safety Analyses 12.4.1 Definitions  All adverse events recorded during the study will be coded according to MedDRA.  12.4.2 Adverse Events  All adverse events (AEs) recorded during the study through the date of randomization through 28 days after the last dose of study drug will be analyzed.   Adverse events will be summarized by treatment group using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred term. Separate tabulations will be produced for all treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), treatment-related AEs (those considered by the Investigator as at least possibly drug related), SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and AEs ≥ Grade 3 severity. By-subject listings will be provided for any deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation.  AE’s will be summarized using incidence rates. Therefore, each subject will only contribute once for a given adverse event SOC or PT.   Any treatment emergent AEs related to local safety (e.g., erythema, edema, induration, vesiculation, etc.) will be collected by the investigator during scheduled clinic visits.  In addition, solicited local adverse reactions (e.g., itching, new rash, pain, tenderness, stinging, skin color change, etc.) and severity from subjects will be collected during the first week of treatment using eDiary to inform local skin tolerability. A summary of the incidence of any adverse event, SAE, and adverse events leading to discontinuation will be presented.  Summaries will display, by treatment group, the incidence of patients with events, the frequency of patients with events within each primary system organ class and by preferred terms. For each preferred term and each system organ class a patient will 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 48  be counted only once. For summaries on severe or drug-related AE, for a given patient, the highest severity or relationship for a specific preferred term will be considered.  12.4.3 Deaths and Serious Adverse Events  Serious adverse events and events leading to death will be summarized overall and by primary system organ class and preferred term.  12.4.4 Adverse Events leading to treatment discontinuation  Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation will be summarized overall and by primary system organ class and preferred term.  12.5 Efficacy Analyses  All efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population and PP population. Regression models will include all eligible subjects for the respective analysis, from the 3 treatment arms.   Hypothesis tests for the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed using a Dunnett Testing Method, applying pairwise comparisons of each respective B244 dose group to vehicle using a one-sided familywise error rate of 0.10.  No additional adjustments will be made for multiple testing.  As such, p-values from analysis of secondary and exploratory efficacy analyses must be interpreted in an exploratory fashion. The primary endpoint of mean change from baseline to Week 4 in WI-NRS will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models.  In addition, continuous efficacy endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4 and Week 8 for actual values and change-from-baseline values. The difference in treatment groups in change-from-baseline values at post-baseline visits will be analyzed using a mixed model with repeated measures to account for within subject variability and including visit (Baseline vs. Week 2, Week 4, Week 8), treatment group, visit-by-treatment interaction, and baseline value as explanatory variables.  Categorical variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics and analyzed using a logistic regression model at each respective timepoints.  Generalized estimating equations to account for repeated measures and within-subject variability may also be applied.  Supportive analyses may be performed combining the B244 dose groups in comparison against vehicle and comparison of the B244 groups to one another.       
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 49  12.6 Handling of dropouts or missing data  All available data will be analyzed.  The details for any imputations for missing data will be documented in the trial’s Statistical Analysis Plan.  Subjects who dropout after enrollment but prior to randomization will be replaced.   12.7 Clinical Trial Protocol deviations  At minimum, the following deviations will be summarized on the ITT patient population:   ● Inclusion or exclusion criteria not satisfied.  ● Deviations related to the Investigational Product administration  ● Not permitted concomitant medications.  13 ADVERSE EVENTS (AE) AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE) The Investigator and study staff are responsible for detecting and recording AEs and SAEs during scheduled safety evaluations and whenever such information is brought to their attention. This section of the protocol provides definitions and detailed procedures to be followed.  13.1 Definition of an AE An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant which is temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, regardless of its potential relationship to the medicinal product.  An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable or unintended sign, including an abnormal symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated), whether or not related to the investigational product (IP).    Examples of an AE include: ● Exacerbation of a pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. ● New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study. ● Signs, symptoms of a drug interaction. ● Signs, symptoms of a suspected overdose of either investigational product or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE/SAE).  AEs may include pre- or post-treatment events that occur as a result of protocol-mandated procedures (i.e., modification of participant’s previous therapeutic regimen).  13.2 Definition of a SAE A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 50  a) results in death. b) is life-threatening. NOTE:  The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  c) requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. NOTE:  In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out -patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs.  If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. Routine hospitalizations or elective surgeries are generally not regarded as SAEs.   d) results in disability/incapacity NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  e) is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f) Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition.  These should also be considered serious.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 13.3 Time-period, Frequency, and Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  All AEs occurring after administration of the first dose of study medication and on or before the final assessment must be reported as AEs.  All AEs must be recorded irrespective of whether they are considered drug-related.  At each assessment in the period defined above, AEs will be evaluated by the Investigator and recorded.  
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 51  Any AEs already documented at a previous assessment and designated as ongoing, should be reviewed at subsequent assessments as necessary.  If these have resolved, this should be documented.  Changes in intensity or frequency of AEs should be recorded as separate events (i.e., a new record started).  The recording of AEs and SAEs are described in Section 13.4 (“Recording of AEs and SAEs”).  13.4 Recording of AEs and SAEs All clinical events, including either observed or volunteered problems, complaints or symptoms are to be recorded on the Adverse Events page(s) of the CRF.  The need to capture this information is not dependent upon whether the clinical event is associated with study treatment. Adverse clinical events resulting from concurrent illnesses or reactions to concurrent medications are also to be recorded.  In order to avoid vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions, the AE should be recorded in standard medical terminology rather than the participant’s own words.  Each adverse clinical event is to be evaluated for duration, intensity, and whether the event may be associated with the investigational product (IP) or other causes.  Start and stop dates, relationship to investigational product (IP), medical management, and alternative causality of event must be recorded in the Adverse Events section of the CRF.  AEs believed to be possibly related to investigational product (IP) must be followed until resolution.  13.5 Evaluating AEs and SAEs  13.5.1 Severity Rating The severity of an adverse event (AE and SAE) is to be scored according to the following scale: Mild Awareness of symptoms, but easily tolerated Moderate Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity Severe Incapacitating with inability to work or perform usual activity An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE.  An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre-defined outcomes as described in Section 13.2 “Definition of a SAE”.  13.5.2 Relationship to Investigational product (IP)  SAEs will be classified as “not related” or “related” (including unknown).   
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 52  For AEs, the relationship to study treatment is to be assessed according to the following definitions: Definitely not related: The AE is definitely not related to the drug.  This designation should be reserved for those events which occur prior to study treatment or for those events which cannot be even remotely related to study participation (e.g., injuries sustained in an automobile accident).  Unlikely related: There is no reasonable association between the study treatment and the suspected event and the event could have been produced by the participant 's clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the participant.  Possibly related:  The suspected adverse event may or may not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from study treatment administration but seems to be the type of reaction that cannot be dismissed as unlikely.  The event could have been produced or mimicked by the participant 's clinical state or by other modes of therapy concomitantly administered to the participant.  Probably related: The suspected adverse event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study treatment administration, abates upon discontinuation of the treatment, and cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the participant 's clinical state.  Definitely related: This designation should be reserved for those events which have no uncertainty in their relationship to treatment administration.  13.6 Pregnancy  Any pregnancy that occurs in a female participating in the study must be reported to the Safety Team or to a designated Safety email or fax number provided by the Safety Team within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. Follow-up must occur to determine the outcome of the pregnancy (including premature termination) and the status of mother and child.  Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as AEs or SAEs.  Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE.  Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy and considered by the Investigator as related to the investigational product must be promptly reported to the Sponsor, even if the event occurred after the participant completed the study.  The Investigator must attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partners of male participants who become pregnant while the male participant is enrolled in the study. Pregnancy information must be reported to the Sponsor as described above.  13.7 Prompt Reporting of SAEs to the Sponsor 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 53   In the case of a Serious Adverse Event the Investigator must immediately:  ● SEND (within 1 working day) the signed and dated SAE Report Form to the Safety Team or to a designated Safety email or fax number provided by the Safety Team;  ● ATTACH a photocopy of all examinations carried out and the dates on which these examinations were performed. Care should be taken to ensure that the patient's identity is protected and the patient's identifiers in the Clinical Trial are properly documented on all copies of source documents provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges;  ● Follow-up of any Serious Adverse Event that is fatal or life threatening should be provided within one additional calendar week. The treatment code will be unblinded for reporting of Serious Adverse Events that are unexpected and determined to be related to the use of the Investigational Product.  Follow-up  ● The Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the patients, including referral to a specialist if indicated. Notably the Investigator should follow up the outcome of any adverse events (clinical signs, laboratory values or other, etc.) until the return to normal or stabilization of the patient's condition;  ● In the case of any Serious Adverse Event, the patient must be followed up until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized. This implies that follow-up may continue after the patient has left the Clinical Trial and that additional investigations may be requested by the Safety Team;  ● In case of any Serious Adverse Event brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after cessation of Investigational Product and considered by the Investigator to be related to the Investigational Product, this should be reported to the Safety Team.

It is recommended that the Investigator retain the study documents at least fifteen (15) years after the completion or discontinuation of the Clinical Trial. However, applicable regulatory requirements should be taken into account in the event that a longer period is required.   The Investigator must notify the Sponsor prior to destroying any study essential documents within the fifteen (15) year period following the Clinical Trial completion or discontinuation.  If the Investigator's personal situation is such that archiving can no longer be ensured by him/her, the Investigator shall inform the Sponsor and the relevant records shall be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee.   15.3 Internal Safety Review Committee An internal safety review committee may be set up as needed to protect the ethical and safety interests of participants and to protect the scientific validity of the study. Ad-hoc safety interim analyses might be performed by an independent statistician if the safety review committee identifies potential safety signals during its routine blinded safety review. The details for the analysis plan may be documented in the trial’s Statistical Analysis Plan.   16 STUDY MONITORING 16.1 Responsibilities of the Investigator(s)  The Investigator(s) undertake(s) to perform the Clinical Trial in accordance with this Clinical Trial Protocol, ICH guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the applicable regulatory requirements.   The Investigator is required to ensure compliance with all procedures required by the Clinical Trial Protocol and by study procedures provided by the Sponsor (including security rules). The Investigator agrees to provide reliable data and all information requested by the Clinical Trial Protocol (with the help of the Case Report Form [CRF], Discrepancy Resolution Form [DRF] or 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 57  other appropriate instrument) in an accurate and legible manner according to the instructions provided and to ensure direct access to source documents to Sponsor representatives. If any particular circuits have to be defined (e.g., e-CRF, Fax), particular attention should be paid to the confidentiality of the patient's data to be transferred. The Investigator may appoint such other individuals as he/she may deem appropriate as Sub-Investigators to assist in the conduct of the Clinical Trial in accordance with the Clinical Trial Protocol. All Sub-Investigators shall be timely appointed and listed. The Sub-Investigators will be supervised by and under the responsibility of the Investigator. The Investigator will provide them with a Clinical Trial Protocol and all necessary information.   16.2 Responsibilities of the Sponsor   The Sponsor of this Clinical Trial is responsible to Health Authorities for taking all reasonable steps to ensure the proper conduct of the Clinical Trial Protocol with regard to ethics, Clinical Trial Protocol compliance, integrity and validity of the data recorded on the Case Report Forms. Thus, the main duty of the Monitoring Team is to help the Investigator and the Sponsor maintain a high level of ethical, scientific, technical and regulatory quality in all aspects of the Clinical Trial. At regular intervals during the Clinical Trial, the site will be contacted, through monitoring visits, letters or telephone calls, by a representative of the Monitoring Team to review study progress, Investigator and patient compliance with Clinical Trial Protocol requirements, and any emergent problems. During these monitoring visits, the following but not exhaustive list of points will be scrutinized with the Investigator: patient informed consent, patient recruitment and follow-up, Serious Adverse Event documentation and reporting, outcome events documentation and reporting, Investigational Product allocation, patient compliance with the Investigational Product regimen, Investigational Product accountability, concomitant therapy use and quality of data.   16.3 Source document requirements  According to the ICH guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, the Monitoring Team must check the Case Report Form entries against the source documents. The Informed Consent Form will include a statement by which the patient allows the Sponsor’s duly authorized personnel, the Ethics Committee (IRB/EC), and the regulatory authorities to have direct access to source data which supports the data on the Case Report Forms (e.g., patient's medical file, appointment books, original laboratory records, etc.). These personnel, bound by professional secrecy, must keep confidential all personal identity or personal medical information (according to confidentiality rules).   16.4 Use and completion of Case Report Forms (CRFs) and additional requests  The sponsor or CRO will be responsible for activities associated with the data management of this study. This will include setting up a relevant database and data transfer mechanisms, along with appropriate validation of data and resolution of queries. Data generated within this 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 58  clinical study will be handled according to the relevant SOPs of the data management and biostatistics departments of sponsor or CRO.   For Electronic Data Capture (EDC): Study sites will enter data directly into an EDC system by completing the eCRF via a secure internet connection.  Data entered into the eCRF must be verifiable against source documents at the study site. Any changes to the data entered into the EDC system will be recorded in an automated, secure audit trail and is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 Part 11 compliant.   Data entered into the eCRF will be validated as defined in the Data Validation Specifications (DVS). Validation includes, but is not limited to, validity checks (for example, missing data, range checks) and consistency checks (logical checks between variables) to ensure that study data are accurately reported. Additionally, CRO Data Management will perform aggregate data review as defined in the DVS to ensure that the data are complete, consistent and reasonable. The electronic edit checks will run continually throughout the course of the study and queries reviewed by CRO personnel to assure validity as compared to source records. Manual queries may also be entered into EDC by Monitoring or Data Management personnel to address identified discrepancies.   Medical conditions/procedures will be coded using MedDRA and prior and concomitant medications will be coded using WHODrug.   At the conclusion of the study, each site will be provided with their subject CRFs in Portable Document Format (PDF) for archival.  The CRF PDFs will contain subject data, audit trail information, queries including responses, and comments.  17 PUBLICATIONS All data generated from this study are the property of AOBiome LLC and shall be held in strict confidence along with all information furnished by AOBiome.  Independent analyses and/or publication of these data by the Investigator or any member of his/her staff is not permitted without prior written consent of AOBiome.    Any formal presentation or publication of data from this trial will be considered as a joint publication by the Investigator(s) and appropriate Sponsor personnel.  Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement. Written permission to the Investigator will be contingent on the review by the Sponsor of the methodology and statistical analysis and any publication or presentation will provide for nondisclosure of AOBiome confidential or proprietary information.  In all cases, the parties agree to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to all other parties at least 30 days prior to submission.  This will enable all parties to protect proprietary information and to provide comments based on information that may not yet be available to other parties.   
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 59  18 PROTOCOL ADHERENCE This protocol defines the study objectives, the study procedures and the data to be collected on study participants. Additional assessments required to ensure the safety of participants should be administered as deemed necessary on a case by case basis. Under no circumstances is an Investigator allowed to collect additional data or conduct any additional procedures for any research related purpose involving any investigational drugs under the protocol. Investigators ascertain they will apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations. If an Investigator feels a protocol deviation would improve the conduct of the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment is agreed upon by the sponsor and approved by the IRB/IEC and health authorities, where required, it cannot be implemented. 19 CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS Any protocol amendments will be added as stand-alone documents.  In addition, any and all revisions dictated by the amendments will be made in the protocol.  Each time a protocol is amended, a new amended version date will be added to the cover page.  The Investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes of the Clinical Trial Protocol without agreement by the sponsor and prior review and documented approval/favorable opinion from the IRB/EC of an amendment. The Investigator is expected to take any immediate action required for the safety of any participant included in this study, even if this action represents a deviation from the protocol. In such cases, the reporting requirements identified in Section 13 must be followed and the Study Lead. 20 CONFIDENTIALITY  All information disclosed or provided by the Sponsor (or any company/institution acting on their behalf), or produced during the Clinical Trial, including, but not limited to, the Clinical Trial Protocol, the CRFs, the Investigator's Brochure and the results obtained during the course of the Clinical Trial, is confidential. The Investigator or any person under his/her authority agrees to undertake to keep confidential and not to disclose the information to any third party without the prior written approval of the Sponsor. However, the submission of this Clinical Trial Protocol and other necessary documentation to the Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) is expressly permitted, the IRB/EC members having the same obligation of confidentiality. The Sub-Investigators shall be bound by the same obligation as the Investigator. The Investigator shall inform the Sub-Investigators of the confidential nature of the Clinical Trial. The Investigator and the Sub-Investigators shall use the information solely for the purposes of the Clinical Trial, to the exclusion of any use for their own or for a third party's account.  21 PROPERTY RIGHTS  All information, documents and Investigational Product provided by the Sponsor or its designee are and remain the sole property of the Sponsor. The Investigator shall not mention any information or the Product in any application for a patent or for any other intellectual property rights. All the results, data, documents and inventions, which arise directly or indirectly from the 
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 60  Clinical Trial in any form, shall be the immediate and exclusive property of the Sponsor. The complete verified database will be shared with the Operations Committee, which shall have full access to all data. The Sponsor may use or exploit all the results at its own discretion, without any limitation to its property right (territory, field, continuance). The Sponsor shall be under no obligation to patent, develop, market or otherwise use the results of the Clinical Trial. As the case may be, the Investigator and/or the Sub-Investigators shall provide all assistance required by the Sponsor, at the Sponsor's expense, for obtaining and defending any patent, including signature of legal documents.   22 DATA PROTECTION  The patient's personal data and Investigator's personal data which may be included in the Sponsor database shall be treated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations;   When archiving or processing personal data pertaining to the Investigator and/or to the patients, the Sponsor shall take all appropriate measures to safeguard and prevent access to this data by any unauthorized third party.  23 SPONSOR AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS BY REGULATORY AGENCIES  For the purpose of ensuring compliance with the Clinical Trial Protocol, Good Clinical Practice and applicable regulatory requirements, the Investigator should permit auditing by or on behalf of the Sponsor and inspection by applicable regulatory authorities.   The Investigator agrees to allow the auditors/inspectors to have direct access to his/her study records for review, being understood that these personnel are bound by professional secrecy, and as such will not disclose any personal identity or personal medical information.   The Investigator will make every effort to help with the performance of the audits and inspections, giving access to all necessary facilities, data, and documents. As soon as the Investigator is notified of a future inspection by the authorities, he will inform the Sponsor and authorize the Sponsor to participate in this inspection.   The confidentiality of the data verified and the protection of the patients should be respected during these inspections.   Any result and information arising from the inspections by the regulatory authorities will be immediately communicated by the Investigator to the Sponsor.   The Investigator shall take appropriate measures required by the Sponsor to take corrective actions for all problems found during the audit or inspections.   
 
Protocol PRB244-01 Amendment 3 28-FEB-2020  Page 61  24 PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF THE STUDY OR PREMATURE CLOSE-OUT OF A SITE   24.1 Decided by the Sponsor in the following cases: 1. In the event the results of the Clinical Trial do not appear to be scientifically convincing to the Sponsor;  2. If the aim of the Clinical Trial has become outdated or is no longer of interest;  3. If the information on the product leads to doubt as to the benefit/risk ratio;  4. If the Investigator has received from the Sponsor all Investigational Product, means and information necessary to perform the Clinical Trial and has not included any patient after a reasonable period of time mutually agreed upon;  5. In the event of breach by the Investigator of a fundamental obligation under this agreement, including but not limited to breach of the Clinical Trial Protocol, breach of the applicable laws and regulations or breach of the ICH guidelines for GCP;  6. If the total number of patients are included earlier than expected; In any case the Sponsor will notify the Investigator of its decision by written notice.   24.2 Decided by the Investigator  The Investigator must notify (30 days' prior notice) the Sponsor of his/her decision and give the reason in writing. In all cases (decided by the sponsor or by the Investigator), the appropriate Ethics Committee(s) (IRB/EC) and Health Authorities should be informed.   25 CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  All appendices attached hereto and referred to herein are made part of this Clinical Trial Protocol. The Investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes of the Clinical Trial Protocol without agreement by the sponsor and prior review and documented approval/favorable opinion from the IRB/EC of an amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to clinical trial patients, or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial. Any change agreed upon will be recorded in writing, the written amendment will be signed by the Investigator and by the Sponsor and the signed amendment will be filed with this Clinical Trial Protocol. Any amendment to the Clinical Trial Protocol requires written approval/favorable opinion by the IRB/EC prior to its implementation, unless there are overriding safety reasons. In some instances, an amendment may require a change to the Informed Consent Form. The Investigator must receive an IRB/EC approval/favorable opinion concerning the revised Informed Consent Form prior to implementation of the change.

PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
PARTICIPANT AREA  DESCRIPTION  
Title  SGLT2 Inhibitor Adjunctive Therapy to Closed Loop Control in T1D  
Investigational Device  Tandem Control- IQ with G6 Continuous Glucose Monitor (CiQ)  
Investigational Medication  Empagliflozin 5 mg daily  
Objectives  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining SGLT2 inhibitors with closed loop control  
Study Design  The study is a randomized control trial where approximately 60 participants will be in the trial for 
approximately 10 weeks. A Pilot Study with approximately five (5) participants will use the Basal- IQ insulin 
therapy + Empagliflozin 10 mg daily. These participants will participate in an estimated 36 -48 hour hotel 
admission to initiate use of Closed Loop Control (CLC) with the Tandem t:slim X2 with Control -IQ 
Technology (CiQ) with Empagliflozin (CiQ -EMPA). The safety data from the hotel admission will be 
presented to the DSMB for review. Upon DSMB approval, up to 40 participants will be randomized 1:1 to 
(a) CiQ x 4 weeks with or without Empagliflozin 5 mg daily (CiQ -EMPA vs. CiQ -NO EMPA) then Basal- IQ x 
2 weeks with or without Empagliflozin  5 mg daily (BiQ -EMPA vs. BiQ -NO EMPA) or (b) Basal- IQ x 2 weeks 
with or without Empagliflozin (BiQ -EMPA vs. BiQ -NO EMPA) then CiQ x 4 weeks with or without 
Empagliflozin (CiQ -EMPA vs. CiQ -NO EMPA)   
Number of Sites  1 
Endpoint  To demonstrate the efficacy of Empagliflozin as adjuvant therapy with Basal- IQ therapy vs a closed loop 
artificial pancreas system (CiQ -EMPA) in patients with T1DM. The primary efficacy outcome variable will 
be time in range (70 -180 mg/dl).  
Population  Key Inclusion Criteria  
• Age 18 -65 
• Diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes  
Key Exclusion Criteria  
• Hemoglobin A1c > 9%  
Sample Size   •  Enrollment for the Pilot Study will proceed with the goal of completing approximately 5 participants 
in the trial.  
• Enrollment for the Main Study will proceed with the goal of completing approximately 40 subjects, 10 subjects in each group. 
Treatment Groups  With Empagliflozin  5 mg daily : 
• CiQ x 4 weeks (CiQ -EMPA) then Basal -IQ x 2 weeks (BiQ -EMPA)  
• Basal -IQ x 2 weeks (BiQ -EMPA) then CiQ x 4 weeks (CiQ -EMPA)  
Without Empagliflozin:  
• CiQ x 4 weeks (CiQ -NO EMPA) then Basal- IQ x 2 weeks (BiQ -NO EMPA)  
• Basal -IQ x 2 weeks (BiQ -NO EMPA) then CiQ x 4 weeks (CiQ -NO EMPA)  
Participant Duration  Approximately 10 weeks  
Protocol Overview/Synopsis  Up to five participants will participate in a Pilot Study. These participants will wear the Basal -IQ insulin 
pump, continuous glucose monitor,  and take one tab daily of Empagliflozin 10 mg for about  2-3 weeks at 
home. They will then participate in a 36 -48 hour hotel admission to begin the use of Control- IQ System 
with Empagliflozin. After DSMB review of safety data, up to 40 participants will be enrolled to begin the Main Study where, in a crossover design, participants will use the Control -IQ for 4 weeks and then Basal-
IQ for 2 weeks, with  the drug given at the dosage of 5mg per day or without drug.

 Chapter 1:  Background  114 
 
 115 
Current automated insulin delivery device systems providing dynamic insulin infusion, while 116 
improving prandial glucose control compared to conventional open loop therapies, have been 117 
unable to normalize prandial glucose control in T1DM. Strate gies that have been 118 
used/considered in AP systems to improve prandial control include a) hybrid system that requires 119 
the patient to announce meals by entering the carbohydrate content; b) system with meal 120 
announcement that is partially or completely indepe ndent of meal carbohydrate content, and c) 121 
fully automated system with no meal announcement. Notably, a fully automated CLC system 122 
would lower the significant patient burden linked to prandial glucose control. Postprandial 123 
glucose control is a key determin ant of HbA1c, the clinical gold standard for optimal glucose 124 
control. While meal carbohydrate content is the major factor for prandial glucose excursions, 125 
precise determination of meal carbohydrate content (that is associated with better glycemic 126 
control and lower glucose variability) during free living remains a significant challenge for the 127 
patients with an average error in carbohydrate counting of ~20% with most patients 128 
underestimating their carbohydrate content hence leading to increased prevalence of prandial 129 
hyperglycemia.  130 
Clinical trials with fully automated AP systems have mostly been in small number of patients and 131 
in the in -patient settings for short durations  [1, 2]. These trials have demonstrated significant 132 
postprandial hyperglycemia with a risk for late postprandial hypoglycemia. The availability of 133 
newer antidiabetic drugs provide the opportunity to test these medications as adjuvants 134 
together with conventional or CLC algorithms, to determine the effects, if any, of combination 135 
therapy, for improvements in postprandial and overall glucose control in individuals with T1DM. 136 
The adjuvants tha t have been tried in very short -term inpatient trials include pramlintide (amylin 137 
analogue that delays gastric emptying and lowers postprandial glucagon concentrations) [3-5] 138 
and Glucagon- like-peptide 1 receptor analogues (delays gastric emptying and lowers  139 
postprandial glucagon concentrations) and GLP -1 receptor agonists [6]. These studies have 140 
demonstrated modest improvements in CGM parameters (time in range and glucose variability) 141 
without increasing hypoglycemia in T1DM subjects.  142 
 
 143 
Inhibitors of sodium -glucose cotransporter -2 have been approved for use in type 2 diabetes 144 
where large cl inical trials have demonstrated clinically significant improvements in glucose 145 
control (viz., HbA1c) and cardiovascular events [7]. While not FDA approved for use in adults with 146 
Type 1 diabetes subjects, these drugs have also been tested in randomized controlled clinical 147 
trials in these patients to evaluate their safety and efficacy. The EASE program [8] included two 148 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 18 of 72 
 double -blind, placebo -controlled  phase 3 trials in > 1700 patients with T1DM. These trials tested 149 
2.5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg tablets vs. placebo over 26 -52 weeks. The results showed that 150 
Empagliflozin lowered HbA1c, lowered total daily dose of insulin (by 10 -13%) while increasing 151 
time in range (by up to 12%) without any increase in the frequency or severity of hypoglycemia. 152 
Simultaneously, there were improvements in body weight (by up to 3.5 Kg), blood pressure and 153 
glucose variability.  154 
However, adverse effects pertaining to genital infections, diabetic ketoacidosis, and ketosis  155 
without acidosis were between 2 -3 fold higher with Empagliflozin than placebo. Due to the 156 
glycosuric effects of this class of drugs, it is noteworthy that the characteristic hyperglycemic 157 
milieu often seen during classical episodes of diabetic keto -acidosis are not observed in 158 
ketoacidosis related to S GLT2 drug use where the ambient glucose concentrations are frequently 159 
< 250 mg/dl. This observation has prompted the creation of the condition of “euglycemic diabetic 160 
keto -acidosis” associated with SGLT2 drug use. Risks for development of ketosis were deem ed to 161 
be due to concomitant illnesses (viral infections, gastro -enteritis), insulin pump failure, alcohol 162 
excess, extreme/endurance sports and low carbohydrate diet (< 100 grams/day). Suggestions for 163 
prevention of ketosis in patients on SGLT2 inhibitor the rapy are to avoid use of this class of drugs 164 
in those with HbA1c > 9%, temporary drug discontinuation for 24 -48 prior to planned surgery, 165 
fasting, intercurrent illnesses or prolonged physical activity, early recognition of symptoms of 166 
ketosis (malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, excess thirst), regular point of care ketone 167 
monitoring (6 -12 hourly) especially if glucose > 9mmol. The putative STICH protocol has recently 168 
been recommended for management of diabetic ketoacidosis associated with use of SGL T2 169 
inhibitor therapy [9]. This includes  STop drug, Inject bolus insulin (1.5 times the usual correction 170 
bolus), Consume 30 -60 grams of carbohydrate and Hydrate with 200-500 ml of fluids . The above 171 
sequence needs to be repeated every 1-2 hours with recheck of ketones in 2-4 hour s. Medical 172 
attention should be  sought if any of the steps cannot be followed, particularly if fluids cannot be 173 
maintained or if ketonemia does not resolve within 4 -6 hours.   174 
The increased risk of ketosis and DKA in SGLT2 users with T1DM may not preclude use of this 175 
class of drugs for the management of T1DM given their clinical benefits in RCTs in T1DM patients 176 
(described above) and the cardiovascular benefits in T2DM patients. As always, careful patient 177 
selection, patient education and monitoring strategies need to be developed and tes ted to 178 
ensure patient safety.  179 
 
 180 
Adjuvant use of antidiabetic medications in combination with automated insulin delivery systems 181 
have been tested in short term clinical trials in T1DM. The drugs tested include pramlintide and 182 
GLP-1 receptor agonists [6]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published clinical trials 183 
on the sa fety and efficacy of combining SGLT2 inhibitors with closed loop control. In contrast to 184 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 19 of 72 
 the above trials, where both pramlintide and GLP -1 agonists need to be infused or injected, 185 
Empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, is taken as a once daily oral tablet making it simple, practical 186 
and not burdensome for patient adherence. Additionally, given its proven benefits on glucose 187 
control in several large RCTs involving >1700 patients with T1DM, it is necessary to test its efficacy 188 
and safety, in combination with automated insulin delivery systems, in T1DM subjects as part of 189 
a clinical trial that we propose. Additionally, albeit the increased prevalence of ketosis with 190 
empagliflozin use in the published trials, given the accumulated clinical information and 191 
experienc e, we will ensure that appropriate precautions including judicious selection of research 192 
participants (HbA1c of 9% as cutoff for enrollment), educating subjects on avoiding 193 
circumstances that could predispose to ketosis (intercurrent illnesses, alcohol excess, low carb 194 
diet etc) and careful monitoring, will prevent and further lower the risks of ketosis during the 195 
proposed, short term clinical trial.  196 
 
 197 
The Basal- IQ feature in the t:slim insulin pump reduce the frequency  and duration of low -glucose 198 
events by predicting glucose levels 30 minutes ahead and suspending insulin if they are expected 199 
to drop below 80 mg/dL.  Use of Empagliflozin during Basal- IQ phase is to explore its safety and 200 
feasibility as an adjunctive agent, compare its use vs Control -IQ phase  and to gather data on its 201 
effect on postprandial glucose excursions.  202 
 
 203 
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the use of Empagliflozin as 204 
an adjunctive therapy with the Tandem t:slim  X2 insulin pump with Control IQ Technology vs. 205 
the Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump with Basal- IQ Technology in T1 D participants.  206 
 
 207 
The Main  Study is a randomized control trial, aged 18 to 65 y.o. at time of consent, will be in the 208 
trial for up to 10 weeks. The first five participants will be enrolled in a Pilot Study to use the Basal - 209 
IQ with Empagliflozin 10 mg daily for approximately two weeks. These participants will 210 
participate in an estimated 36 -48-hour hotel admission to initiate use of Closed Loop Control 211 
(CLC) . 212 
The safety data from the Pilot Study  will be presented to the DSMB for review. Upon DSMB 213 
approval, approximately 40 participants will be randomized 1:1 in a crossover design:  214

Participants will use either lispro or aspart insulin prescribed by their personal physician. 259 
Participants should bring their insulin to all study appointments.  260 
 
 261 
Inhibitors of sodium -glucose cotransporter -2 have been approved for use in type 2 diabetes 262 
where large c linical trials have demonstrated clinically significant improvements in glucose 263 
control (viz., HbA1c) and cardiovascular events [7, 10]. These  drugs have also been tested in 264 
randomized controlled clinical trials in patients with Type 1 diabetes to evaluate their safety and 265 
efficacy.  266 
 
 267 
Experimental group participants will be advised to take Empagliflozin (trade name: Jardiance ) 5 268 
mg one time daily, with or without food. Empagliflozin is available only in 10  mg and 25 mg  film 269 
coated unscored tablets. For this study , the participants will be provided 10  mg tablets and a pill 270 
splitter. They will be  instructed to split only 1 tablet a t a time and take each half tablet  (5mg each) 271 
on subsequent days. Participants will be cautioned against spitting more than one tablet at a 272 
time. Participants will be advised to take the medication only as prescribed. If a dose is missed, it 273 
should be taken as soon as the participant remembers but will be advised not to double the next 274 
dose.  275 
 
 276 
Empagliflozin will be provided by a third -party collaborator and delivered to the UVA 277 
Investigational Pharmacy. The clinical investigator will be responsible for maintaining adequate 278 
records of the disposition of the drug.  279 
 
 280 
The site will document drug receipt,  subject dispensing and return, returns of used and unused 281 
supplies to a third- party collaborator (or on -site destruction), and will maintain a current 282 
accounting of all supplies in inventory —that is, a balance -on-hand log. The balance -on-hand, or 283 
dispensi ng, log will contain the protocol number, the investigative site(s), the drug name, and the 284 
medication units).  When dispensing drug to a subject, site personnel will record the date, subject 285 
number, and amount dispensed. When a subject returns a drug, the  amount used and unused 286 
will be documented, and an explanation for any inadvertent loss or destruction of supplies will 287 
also be recorded.  288

Approximately five subjects will be enrolled into the Pilot Study. The Pilot participants will 301 
complete use the Basal- IQ Technology with Empagliflozin for 1 -3 weeks. They will t hen 302 
participate in a 36 -48 hour hotel admission where they will use the Control -IQ System with the 303 
Empagliflozin.  The safety data from this admission will be presented to the DSMB for review 304 
prior to proceeding to the Main Study.  305 
Pilot participants may enroll the Main Study. The study physician may request repeat laboratory 306 
values if values are greater than 6 weeks from Pilot screening laboratory values. A current 307 
urine/blood pregnancy test will be required prior to enrolling into the Main Study .  308

 Chapter 6  Study Equipment Training  458 
Equipment training  in the Main Study  may begin immediately after screening eligibility has been 459 
met or may be deferred for a maximum of 30 days.  Equipment training  in the Pilot Study  is 460 
intended to begin immediately after screening eligibility has been met . The study physician may 461 
elect to delay a participant’s equipment training session if needed.   The purpose of this training 462 
is to introduce the study insulin pump and study CGM to the participant.  463 
The participant’s insulin parameters will be programmed into their study insulin pump by two  464 
research staff. Subjects will then switch to the study insulin pump. The participant’s personal 465 
pump and infusion site will be removed.  466 
The participant will have the insulin pump and sensor on them at all times. Study supplied phones 467 
will be available upo n request.  468 
Participants will download the study equipment approximately one time per week or as 469 
frequently as needed.  470 
 
 471 
A study CGM will be provided to all participants at the training session. The participants will be 472 
provided with CGM equipment and instructed to use the study CGM on a daily basis. If the  473 
participant has  prior use of the CGM, re-training will be specific t o the individual.  The study team 474 
may elect to have less frequent CGM users watch the Dexcom online training videos 475 
(https://www.dexcom.com/training -videos)  to assist in the training session.  Study staff training 476 
may include review of study CGM in real -time to make management decisions and how to review 477 
the data after an upload for retrospective review. Study staff will specifically identify how alarms 478 
are set using the app and the frequency that these alarms will repeat when  479 
The participants personal CGM will be discontinued. The participants will be observed placing the 480 
sensor and will learn/review how to access the CGM trace via the t:slim X2 insulin pump  user 481 
interface. The participants will be asked to perform fingerstick blood glucose measurements (if  482 
needed) in accordance with the labeling of the study CGM device.  483 
An electronic copy of the CGM user’s guide will be provided for the participants to take home. 484 
The study team will be sure that the participants will leave the clinic knowing how to use pro per 485 
use the CGM. The study team will be available for any questions.  486 
Participants will have the option of using their personal smartphone or receive a study 487 
smartphone to use in order to collect the data from the devices.  If the participant elects to use a  488

Participants will be provided with a study blood glucose me ter and test strips t o be used at home 492 
per manufacturer guidelines.  493 
All study blood glucose meters will be QC tested by study staff with at least two different 494 
concentrations of control solution, if available.  A tested meter will not be used in a study if it 495 
does not read wit hin the target range at each concentration per manufacturer labeling.   496 
Participants will be reminded to use the study blood glucose meter for all fingerstick BGs during 497 
the study.  498 
 
 499 
Participants will be provided with a study blood keto ne meter and test strips to be used at home 500 
per manufacturer guidelines.  501 
All study blood ketone meters will be QC tested by study staff with at least two different 502 
concentrations of control solution, if available.  A tested meter will not be used in a study if it 503 
does not read within the target range at each concentration per manufacturer labeling.   504 
Participants will b e instructed to perform blood ketone testing at any symptoms, change of 505 
conditions , and as described in Glycemic Treatment Guidelines ( section 10.2 ). A home glucagon 506 
emergency kit will be required. Participants who currently do not have one will be given a 507 
prescription for the glucagon emergency kit.  508 
 
 509 
All subjects will be asked to wear an activity tracker (e.g. Fitbit) . Information  about movement 510 
and heart rate will be recorded though not an endpoint in this study.  511 
 
 512 
 Insulin Pump Topics   513 
The participant will be fully instructed on the study insulin pump. A qualified system trainer will 514 
conduct the training and in particular discuss differences from their home pump in important 515 
aspects such as calculation of insulin on board and correction  boluses. Additional topics not 516 
limited to but may include: infusion site initiation, cartridge/priming procedures, setting up 517 
the pump, charging the pump, navigation through menus, bolus procedures including 518 
stopping a bolus, etc.  519 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 34 of 72 
 The study team will assist the participant in study pump infusion site initiation and will start the 520 
participant on the study pump. The study pump will be programmed with the participant’s 521 
usual basal rates and pump parameters. The participant’s personal pump will be removed.  522 
The participant will be supervised with the study pump during at least one meal or snack bolus 523 
to ensure participant understanding of the pump features.  524 
The participant will be encouraged to review the literature provided with the pump and 525 
infusion sets after  the training is completed. Infusion sets manufactured by Tandem will be 526 
provided to the study subject and a sample list is below and may be provided in different 527 
cannula lengths (e.g. 6mm or 9mm) and tubing lengths (e.g. 23 or 43 inch):  528 
 Tandem Autosoft Line  (e.g. Autosoft 30, Autosoft 90, Autosoft XC)  529 
 Tandem Varisoft  530 
 Tandem TruSteel  531 
Insulin pump training specific to the Basal -IQ Technology & Control -IQ Technology functions will 532 
include:  533 
How to turn on and off the equipment  534 
How to understand wh en the insulin pump is increasing or decreasing basal rates  535 
How to administer a meal or correction bolus  536 
How to enable the sleep function and set the sleep schedule  537 
The participant will be assessed for understanding of the system interface and how to react to 538 
safety/alert messages  539 
The participant will be given electronic versions of the user guides as a reference  540 
 Basal -IQ Training  541 
Participants will be instructed how the t:slim X2 insulin pump with Basal -IQ technology differs 542 
from their personal insulin pump. Specifically, participants will be instructed how the technology 543 
is able to predict glucose levels 30 minutes ahead and will suspend insulin delivery in the event 544 
of a low glucose event. They will also be advised that the system can turn on and turn off every 545 
5 minutes and can suspend insulin up to 2 hours when identifying a hypoglycemic trend. While 546 
the Basal- IQ technology can be on (active) or off when in normal use, participants will be 547 
instructed to have the Basal -IQ feature “ON” when assigned to the Basal- IQ treatment arm.  548 
 Control -IQ Training  549 
The participant will be instructed to how to use the system if insulin is delivered by any means 550 
other than the study pump (e.g. injection of subcutaneous insulin via syringe in the event of 551 
infusion site failure). If insulin is delivered by any means other than the study pump, the 552 
participant will be instructed to turn off Control -IQ for approximately four hours.  553 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 35 of 72 
 The participant will be provided with contact information and will be asked to call the study 554 
clinical staff during periods of illness with an elevated temperature >101.5 degrees Fahrenheit 555 
(38.6 degrees Celsius), periods of significant illness, or during periods of use of medications such 556 
as epinephrine for the emergency treatment of a severe allergic reaction or asthma attack in 557 
addition to use of oral or injectable glucocorticoids to determine if closed -loop use should be 558 
temporarily discontinued.  559 
The participant will also be asked to call the study clinical staff for technical issues with t:slim X2 560 
with Control IQ. The participant should use the study pump without Control -IQ activated and 561 
study CGM (open loop mode) during periods of component disconnections or technical 562 
difficulties.  Study staff contact information will be provided to the partic ipant.  563 
Upon completion of each insulin pump training, study staff will document, using a checklist, that 564 
the participant is familiar with the function/feature and/or capable of performing each of the 565 
tasks specified.  566 
The participant will be provided Glyce mic Treatment Guidelines ( Chapter 10: ) to use at home.  567 
 Optimization of Insulin Pump Settings  568 
Data -driven optimization of pump settings can occur any time during the study, particularly if the 569 
participant contacts the study physician due to concerns about their pump settings due to 570 
recurring hypo - or hyperglycemia.   571

 Chapter 7  Pilot Study  572 
The Pilot Study will be performed at a local hotel/research house. The durati on of the hotel 573 
admission will be approximately 36 -48 hours with the intent of collecting appropriate safety data 574 
that will be presented to the DSMB for review.  575 
 
 576 
After participant’s eligibility is confirmed, the participant will undergo  Study Equipment & 577 
Medication Training (Chapter 6 ) and receive education regarding the use of Empagliflozin 578 
(section 3.2).  579 
The partici pant will be on the study equipment and study medication for about  7-14 days prior 580 
to the hotel admission. The study physician may elect to have the study participant take the 581 
medication for a shorter or longer period of time, depending on side effects.  P articipants of the 582 
study will stay at the hotel/research house with study  staff and other study  participants.  583 
 
 584 
There will be at least two study staff present at all times at the study site, at least one of whom 585 
will be clinical staff (e.g. nurse, physician, nurse practitioner). There will be a physician available 586 
either on -site or nearby off -site at all times. In addition, one of the study medical physicians and 587 
one senior engineer will be on call during the entire admis sion. Glucagon for the emergency 588 
treatment of hypoglycemia will be available on -site. 589 
 
 590 
Pilot participants will be contacted by the study team approximately 48 hours prior to the hotel 591 
admission to verify the following informatio n: 592 
Inquire about any changes to the participant’s medical history  593 
Study equipment (e.g. insulin pump, CGM, and activity tracker) has occurred  594 
Determine pump profile(s) the participant uses on certain days  595 
New CGM sensor has been placed approximately 48 -72 hours prior to admission  for proper 596 
warm- up 597 
Verify with the subject that the goal CGM reading at time of arrival is less than 250 mg/dL  598 
Should any concerns regarding medical history, pump information, or unforeseen issues arise, 599 
the admission will be canc elled for that participant at the discretion of the investigator.  600 
 
 601 
Participants will arrive at the hotel on the first day of the admission.  The study team will perform 602 
vital signs and inquire about any changes to the participant’s medical history.  Any changes to 603 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 37 of 72 
 medical history will be communicated to the medical physician to ensure continued eligibility and 604 
participation.   605 
In the event that the participant’s CGM reading is not between 80 -250 mg/dL or ketone 606 
concentration is ≥0.6 mmol/L prior to the Control -IQ initiation, the study physician may 607 
recommended corrective action as outlined in Chapter 10: . Study physician may elect to cancel 608 
participant’s participation in the hotel admission if concerned about their medical safety.  This 609 
participant will not be replaced.  610 
The participant’s Basal- IQ insulin pump will be discontinued and the Control -IQ insulin pump will 611 
be initiated.  The study team will ensure the proper function of the CGM, insulin pump, and 612 
activity tracker. The goal will be to in itiate Closed Loop Control by approximately 11 a.m.  613 
The CGM used in the study is FDA -approved for the non- adjunctive measurement of blood 614 
glucose (i.e. the CGM reading can be used for insulin dosing decisions). The CGM readings will be 615 
the primary source of blood glucose values .  There are no protocol fingerstick blood glucose 616 
measurements other than at times of CGM calibration (if necessary) and if directed by the study 617 
team.  Glycemic Treatment Guidelines to be used during the hotel admission are defined in 618 
Chapter 10: . 619 
 
 620 
Upon arrival, the subject will be asked to check the CGM reading and ketone concentration using 621 
the study ketone meter.  If CGM is <70 mg/dL or >250 mg/dL, or ketone test is >0.6 mmol/L, the 622 
study physician will suggest appropriate treatment.  The study team may request fingersticks as 623 
needed. The study subject may continue participation in the trial once CGM is between 70 -250 624 
mg /dL and ketone concentration is ≤0.6 mmol/L.  625 
If CGM is ≥200mg/dL for more than 2 hour s or ≥300 mg/dL at any time for experimental group 626 
participants, study physician will be notified to suggest appropriate  treatment and ketones will 627 
be checked.  If CGM is ≥300mg/dL for more than 2 hour s or ≥400 mg/dL at any time for control 628 
group participants, study physician will be notified to suggest appropriate treatment and ketones 629 
will be checked. If ketone concentration is ≥0.6 mmol/L, the study team will check the insulin 630 
pump infusion site and correction insulin and will consider the proper remedy based on the  study 631 
physician judgement via the subject’s insulin pump.  The study team will monitor CGM changes 632 
and ketones will be checked every 60 minutes until ketone concentra tion is <0.6 mmol/L.  633 
If ketone concentration is ≥3.0 mmol/L, the study physician will recommend the appropriate 634 
medical treatment.    635 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 38 of 72 
 If CGM ≤60 mg/dL at any time, subjects will be given approximately 16 grams of fast -acting rescue 636 
carbohydrates.  Study team will monitor CGM rise and will consider treating again if CGM <80 637 
mg/dL after approximately 20 minutes.  Hypoglycemic treatments can occur at any time per study 638 
physician request.  639 
 
 640 
Participants may eat freely during the admission, eating a minimum of 100g of carbs per day. The 641 
estimated time of meals will be 8  a.m., 1 p.m., and 7 p.m.  642 
 
 643 
Participants will be free to engage in low -intensity activity (walking, shopping) during the morning 644 
and afternoon hours in a group setting. Participants will enjoy  quiet activities in the  evening.  645 
 
 646 
Discharge will be at approximately 7p.m . if the CGM and ketone values are within parameters 647 
outlined in Chapter 10 . A snack will be provided for the participant at the time of discharge.  648 
Participants will be asked to continue monitorin g ketone levels for 24 -48 hours after discharge  649 
from the hotel . 650 
 
 651 
Approximately 48 hours after the hotel admission , the study team will contact the participant via 652 
phone/email/text to assess:  653 
adverse events, adverse device effects, and device issues  654

 Chapter 8  DSMB Review  657 
 
 658 
The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be provide d all adverse event data from the   onset 659 
of the Pilot Study through the hotel admission for review.  While approximately 5 participants 660 
will be scheduled for the hotel admission, the goal is to provide at least 75% of the data to the 661 
DSMB for review .  Replacing dropped study participants will not be required in the Pilot Study . 662 
The DSMB will review data related to individual stopping criteria as detailed in the study protocol.   663 
 
 664 
After their review, the DSMB can recommend that the current study continue without 665 
modification, continue with specified modifications, discontinue one or more arms of the study, 666 
or halt or modify the study until more information is available . 667 
The DSMB may recommend modifications to individual stopping rules if additional safety 668 
concerns arise during from their continuing reviews of the study data.    669 
The hotel admission will not be repeated unless required by the Data Safety Monitoring Board 670 
(DSMB).   671 
 
 672 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review compiled safety data after the 673 
completion of 10 Main Study participants. As a safety measure, the Board will review if the rate 674 
of mild ketosis greater than 40% (B -OH-B level > 0.6 mmol), 20% significant ketosis (B -OH-B > 1.5 675 
mmol) and more than 5% DKA (B -OH-B > 3 mmol) to be considered significant to stop the study.  676 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review compiled safety data after 10 participants 677 
complete 4 weeks of the Main Study . Absence of serious adverse events  related to Empaglifozin , 678 
the participants will continue with study participation pending DSMB review. The DSMB will 679 
review compiled safety data after 10 participants complete the trial. In addition, the DSMB will 680 
review all DKA and severe hypoglycemia irresp ective of relatedness to study device use, study 681 
drug, and all serious events (including UADEs) related to study device use at the time of 682 
occurrence. The DSMB also will be informed of any ADEs not meeting criteria for a UADE if the 683 
Study PI requests the DSMB review.  The DSMB can request modifications to the study protocol 684 
or suspension or outright stoppage of the study if deemed necessary based on the totality of 685 
safety data available.   686

 Chapter 9  Main Study  687 
After DSMB review and approval of the hotel admission safety data, Main Study participants will 688 
be screened, randomized and trained on the study equipment. Pilot participants may be enrolled 689 
in the Main Study. Screening and consenting of the Main Study participants may be concurrent 690 
to the DSMB review. Virtual study visits may take the place of in -person study visits.  691 
 
 692 
 Run-In Phase  693 
Participants will be aske d to record two days of baseline ketone values before initiating the use 694 
of the study drug. Participant will then be directed  to use the study CGM with Empagliflozin for 695 
1-2 weeks. Proceeding to the pump treatment is dependent upon the participant’s tolerance to 696 
the medication. The study physician may elect to provide the participant additional time in the 697 
event of medication side effects.   698 
Participants will be instructed on the Glycemic Treatment Guidelines with special focus upon 699 
CGM readings (section 10.3 ) and Hyper glycemic Management (section 10.5 ).  700 
Participant will meet the following c riteria to continue study participation:   701 
o Adherence to study protocol  702 
o Ketone testing at least 2 times daily, preferably 4 times, with monitored values not 703 
greater than 0.6/mmol on at least two successive occasions  (first measurement should be 704 
obtained upon waking in a fasting state)  705 
o No adverse events relating to  perineal infections, symptomatic postural hypotension, no 706 
evidence of significant hypoglycemia (< 54 mg/dl) or any other listed adverse effects of 707 
medication.  708 
 
 709 
Participants will receive pump training dependent upon the randomizati on group (i.e. Control -IQ 710 
pump for 4 weeks then Basal -IQ pump for 2 weeks.)  Training provided is described in Section 711 
6.5. 712 
 
 713 
Data  driven optimization of pump settings can occur any time during the study, particularly if the 714 
study participant contacts the study physician due to concerns about their pump settings due to 715 
recurring hypo - or hyperglycemia.  716 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 41 of 72 
 While initiating and maintaining Empagliflozin therapy, the study physician will carefully monitor 717 
insulin dose reductions, especially basal insulin decreases.  718 
 
 719 
All participants will be contacted by the study team in the week following the Run- In Phase and 720 
the Basal- IQ Pump Training Visits  to address issues relating to the study equipment and side 721 
effect of the Empagliflozin if randomized to the treatment group. Two check -in visits will occur 722 
after the Control -IQ Training Visit. Extra contact with subjects will occur as needed.  723 
 
 724 
Participants will be instructed to download the study devices (i.e. insulin pumps, CGM, activity 725 
tracker, etc…) each week, or as needed, to secure data collection.  Study participants will log daily  726 
ketone values in an online resource for ongoing assessment purposes. The study team will 727 
download the ketone meter whenever the study subject attends an in clinic visit. If the subject 728 
owns a personal laptop device, he/she will be asked to bring it to the visit for the study team to 729 
download specific software to be used during data collection. If the subject does not own a laptop 730 
device but owns a desktop computer, he/she will  be provided with a memory drive storing the 731 
appropriate resources to be used at home.  732 
 
 733 
The Basal- IQ Technology will continue working for the first 15 minutes after CGM readings 734 
become unavailable. The Basal- IQ Technology requires three  of the last four data points to make 735 
a prediction. If connectivity with the CGM is lost during a suspension, the Basal -IQ Technology 736 
will continue the suspension for 15 minutes. If connectivity is not resolved within 20 minutes, 737 
Basal- IQ Technology will r esume insulin automatically.  738 
The Control -IQ Technology will continue to operate for the first 15 minutes after CGM readings 739 
become unavailable. If connectivity is not restored after 20 minutes, the Control -IQ Technology 740 
will stop operation until CGM readings are available. While the Control -IQ Technology is not 741 
operating, the participant’s pump will continue to deliver insulin according to the participant’s 742 
personal p rofile settings. Once CGM readings are available, the automated insulin delivery 743 
feature will automatically resume.   744 
If the study system is unable to activate the Control -IQ Technology  for any reason, the pump will 745 
automatically revert to pre -programmed basal insulin delivery without any need for instruction 746 
from the user.  747 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 42 of 72 
 If the Control -IQ Technology detects a system error that does not allow the pump to operate, the 748 
Malfunction Alarm will display and the participant will be instructed to contact Tandem Technical 749 
Support via the study team.  750 
 
 751 
Participants may have unscheduled visits during the study period if required for additional device 752 
training or other unanticipated needs per the study investigator discretion.  753 
 
 754 
All participants will complete both the Basal -IQ and Control -IQ insulin pump training at a virtual 755 
clinic visit prior to using the equipment.  756 
 
 757 
The following procedures will be performed in both groups at the study conclusion visit:  758 
All study devices and all remaining Empagliflozin supplies, including empty medication bottles  759 
Study team will download the study equipment  760 
Blood will be drawn for creatinine, HbA1c, and pregnancy assessment  761 
Study participants will be instructed on how to transition back to the hom e insulins and the doses 762 
to be used. Subjects will be informed that there may be a risk of severe hypoglycemia and/or 763 
severe hyperglycemia during the transition back to the subject’s usual home basal insulin . The 764 
study physician will be available for consu ltation during this transition period.   765 
 
 766 
Approximately 48 hours after the home use of the equipment, the study team will contact the 767 
participant via phone/email/text to assess:  768

Basal- IQ Questionnaire Survey Technology Acceptance  884 
 
 885 
The Diabetes Distress Scale  [12] is a measure of diabetes -related emotional distress and consists 886 
of a scale of 28 items. These include 7 items from each of four domains central to diabetes -related 887 
emotional distress. Patients rate the degree to which each item is currently problematic for t hem 888 
on a 6 -point Likert scale, from 1 (no problem) to 6 (serious problem).  889 
Administration time is approximately 5 minutes.  890 
 
 891 
The Hypoglycemia Fear Survey -II [13] was developed to measure behaviors and worries related 892 
to fear of hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes. It is composed of 2 subscales, the Behavior 893 
(HFS -B) and Worry (HFS -W). HFS -B items describe behaviors in which patients may engage to 894 
avoid hypog lycemic episodes and/or their negative consequences (e.g., keeping blood glucose 895 
levels higher, making sure other people are around, and limiting exercise or physical activity). 896 
HFS-W items describe specific concerns that patients may have about their hypo glycemic 897 
episodes (e.g., being alone, episodes occurring during sleep, or having an accident). Items are 898 
rated on a 5 -point Likert scale (0=never, 4=always), with higher scores indicating higher fear of 899 
hypoglycemia.  900 
Administration time is approximately 10 minutes (both versions).  901 
 Control -IQ / Basal -IQ Survey Technology Acceptance  902 
The Technology Acceptance Surveys  [14] were developed for a Bionic Pancreas camp study. The 903 
38 items in the Questionnaire were based on interviews conducted with individuals who had 904 
participated in previous Bionic Pancreas trials about their experience regarding the Bionic 905 
Pancreas. It was subsequently adapted to assess these same measures for the inControl closed- 906 
loop system. It assesses both positive and negative experiences with inControl, including blood 907 
glucose management, device burden, and overall satisfaction. Items were rated on a 5 -point 908 
scale.  909

 Chapter 12  Risks Associated with Clinical Trial  911 
 
 912 
Risks and Benefits are detailed below. Loss of confidentiality is a potential risk; however, data are 913 
handled to minimize this risk.  Hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and ketone formation are always a 914 
risk in participants with type 1 diabetes and participants will be monitored for these symptoms.  915 
 Venipuncture Risks  916 
A hollow needle/plastic tube will be placed in the arm for taking blood samples. Blood draws can 917 
cause some common reactions like pain, bruising, or redness at the sampling site.  Less common 918 
reactio ns include bleeding from the sampling site, formation of a small blood clot or swelling of 919 
the vein and surrounding tissues, and fainting.  920 
 Fingerstick Risks  921 
About 1 drop of blood will be removed by fingerstick for measuring blood sugars and sometimes 922 
HbA1c or other tests. This is a standard method used to obtain blood for routine hospital 923 
laboratory tests.  Pain is common at the time of lancing.  In about 1 in 10 cases, a small amount 924 
of bleeding under the skin will produce a bruise.  A small scar may persist for several weeks.  The 925 
risk of local infection is less than 1 in 1000.  This should not be a significant contributor to risks in 926 
this study as finger sticks are part of the usual care for people with diabetes.  927 
 Subcutaneous Catheter Risks  (CGM)  928 
Participants using the CGM will be at low risk for developing a local skin infection at the site of 929 
the sensor needle placement.  If a catheter is left under the skin for more than 24 hours it is 930 
possible to get an infection where it goes into the skin, with swelling, redness and pain.  There 931 
may be bleeding where the catheter is put in and bleeding under the skin causes a bruise (1 in 10 932 
risk).  933 
Study staff should verbally alert the participant that on rare occasions, the CGM may break and 934 
leave a small portion of the sensor under the skin that may cause redness, swelling, or pain at 935 
the insertion site.  The participant should be further instructed to notify the study coordinator 936 
immediately if this occurs.  937 
 Risks of Hypoglycemia  938 
As with any person having type 1 diabetes and using insulin, there is always a risk of having a low 939 
blood sugar (hypoglycemia).  The frequency of hypoglycemia should be no more and possibly less 940 
than it would be as part of daily living.  Symptoms of hypoglycemia can include sw eating, 941 
jitteriness, and not feeling well.  Just as at home, there is the possibility of fainting or seizures 942 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 50 of 72 
 (convulsions) and that for a few days the participant may not be as aware of symptoms of 943 
hypoglycemia.  A CGM functioning poorly and significantly  over -reading glucose values could lead 944 
to inappropriate insulin delivery.  945 
 Risks of Hyperglycemia  946 
Hyperglycemia and ketonemia could occur if insulin delivery is attenuated or suspended for an 947 
extended period or if the pump or infusion set is not working properly.  A CGM functioning poorly 948 
and significantly under -reading glucose values could lead to inappropriate suspension of insulin 949 
delivery.  950 
 Risks of Device Reuse  951 
Participant will be informed that FDA or relevant national authorities have approved the insulin 952 
pump, CGM, glucometer and ketone meter for single use and that by using them among multiple 953 
patients , bloodborne pathogens (e.g. Hepatitis B) may be spread through the use of multiple 954 
users.  955 
The study CGM system is labeled for single use only. The sensor (the component of the system 956 
that enters the skin) will be single use only. The transmitter and receiver may be reused during 957 
the study after cleaning the device using a hospital -approved cleaning procedure. The transmitter 958 
is attached to the sensor but does not enter the skin and the receiver, if used, is a hand held 959 
device.  960 
The study insulin pumps are labeled for single -patient use. During the study, this device may be 961 
reused after cleaning adhering to a hospital -approved cleaning procedure. All inf usion set 962 
equipment will be single patient use only (infusion set insertion kits, tubing, cartridges etc.)   963 
The study blood glucose meter and blood ketone meter are labeled for single -patient use. 964 
During  the study, these devices may be reused after cleaning adhering to a hospital -approved 965 
cleaning procedure.   966 
 Device Cleaning Instructions  967 
CGM cleaning instructions are provided in the Dexcom G4 PLATINUM (Professional) Cleaning and 968 
Disinfection manual (current edition). The transmitter should be cleaned with Clorox Healthcare® 969 
Bleach Germicidal Cleaner or any disinfectant product in a spray bottle containing a bleach 970 
solution of 6500 parts per million with the EPA registration number 56392 -7.  The transmitter 971 
will be submerged in this solution and then placed on an absorbent wipe or clean surface.  Two 972 
sprays will be dispensed from the Clorox cleaner onto each side of the transmitter. A nylon brush 973 
will be used to scrub the transmitter on all sides for 30 seconds.  The transmitter will be placed 974 
in the Clorox Cleaner solution for one minute. Transmitter is then rinsed under flowing tap water 975 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 51 of 72 
 for ten seconds. The transmitter will then be disinfected using a disinfectant product with EPA 976 
registration number 56392 -7 using similar procedures as the cleaning process .   977 
Per the pump manufacturer, the insulin pump will be cleaned with a damp lint -free cloth. Use of 978 
household or industrial cleaners, solvents, bleach, scouring pads, chemicals, or sharp instruments 979 
are prohibited. The pump should never be submerged in water. If needed, use only a very mild 980 
detergent, such as a bit of liquid soap with warm water. A soft towel will be used to dry the pump.  981 
The Bayer Contour Next glucometer is cleaned and disinfected with two separate Super Sani - 982 
Cloths (EPA number 9480- 4). The entire surface will be cleaned, making sure the surface stays 983 
wet for 2 minutes. This step is repeated with a clean cloth for disinfecting the device.  984 
The Precision Xtra User’s Guide suggests that healthcare professionals use 10% bleach, 70% 985 
alcohol or 10% ammonia to clean the device.  986 
Equipment that touches intact skin will be cleaned with ethyl or isopropyl alcohol (70 -90%), 987 
quaternary ammonium germicidal detergent (i.e. Cavicide, EPA number 46781) or household 988 
bleach. The contact time on the surface depends on the method used to clean the equipment. 989 
Cavicide requires three minutes on the surface of the equipment. Clorox Germicidal Bleach Wipes 990 
require two minutes on the equipment. The surface should remain wet (i.e. slightly damp) with 991 
the disinfectant to be considered effective though not wet enough to leave drops of liquid.  992 
In the event a manufacturer updates cleaning procedures for their device, the study team will 993 
adhere to the most current recommendations.  994 
There is the risk of blood sampling collection and contamination from sampling techniques. Hand 995 
washing with either soap & water or waterless hand sanitizer will be used prior to caring for the 996 
study subject. Gloves will be worn during blood sample collection and processing. Medical 997 
personne l will continue to practice hygiene for the subject’s protection (i.e. hand washing, 998 
changing gloves frequently, disposing needles properly). Gloves will be removed and hands 999 
washed or sanitized prior to leaving and upon return to the subject’s room. Soiled linen will be 1000 
changed to minimize the transfer of pathogenic organisms.  1001 
 Hb1Ac Risk  1002 
An NGSP Point of Care analyzer (i.e. DCA Vantage Analyzer) will be utilized at the research site to 1003 
obtain the subject’s HbA1c level.  1004 
 Other Risks  1005 
Some participants may develop skin irritation or allergic reactions to the adhesives used to secure 1006 
the CGM, or to secure the insulin infusion sets for the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.  1007 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 52 of 72 
 If these r eactions occur, different adhesives or “under -taping” (such as with IV 3000, Tegaderm, 1008 
etc.) will be tried, sites will be rotated frequently, and a mild topical steroid cream or other 1009 
medication may be required.  1010 
Whenever the skin is broken there is the possibility of an infection.  The CGM and pump infusion 1011 
sites are inserted under the skin.  It is possible that any part that is inserted under the skin may 1012 
cause an infection.  These occur very infrequently, but, if an infection was to occur, oral and/or 1013 
topical antibiotics can be used.  The risk of skin problems could be greater if you use a sensor for 1014 
longer than it is supposed to be used.  Therefore, participants will be carefully instructed about 1015 
proper use of the sensor.  1016 
Data downloaded from the CGM, pump, and glucose and ketone meter , if accessible,  will be 1017 
collected for the study as measures of diabetes self- management behaviors.  Some people 1018 
may  be uncomfortable with the researchers' having such detailed information about their daily 1019 
diabetes habits.  1020 
 Known Potential Benefits  1021 
It is expected that this protocol will yield increased knowledge about using an automated 1022 
closed -loop system with anticipatory action to control glucose levels.  The individual participant 1023 
may not benefit from study participation.  1024 
 Risk Assessment  1025 
Based on the facts that (1) adults and adolescents with diabetes experience mild hypoglycemia 1026 
and hyperglycemia frequently as a consequence of the disease and its management, (2) the study 1027 
intervention involves periodic automated insulin do sing that may increase the likelihood of 1028 
hypoglycemia, and periodic automated attenuation of insulin delivery that may increase the 1029 
likelihood of hyperglycemia, (3) mitigations are in place, and have been tested in prior studies 1030 
using the investigational device system in the home setting, that limit the likelihood of excessive 1031 
insulin dosing or prolonged withdrawal of insulin, and (4) rapid reversal of hypoglycemia and 1032 
hyperglycemia can be achieved, it is the assessment of the investigators that this protoc ol falls 1033 
under DHHS 46.405 which is a minor increase over minimal risk. In addition, it is the belief of the 1034 
investigators that this study also presents prospect of direct benefit to the participants and 1035 
general benefit to others with diabetes.  1036 
 
 1037 
 Empagliflozin Adverse Reactions  1038 
The most recognized  adverse reactions associated with the use of Empagliflozin are urinary tract 1039 
infections and mycotic genital infections occurring in both men and women.  1040 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 53 of 72 
 Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric 1041 
intake due to illness or surgery, alcohol abuse, and shortness of breath may result in adverse 1042 
reactions. The study physician may consider temporarily discontinuing Empaglifloz in in any 1043 
setting of reduced oral intake (such as acute illness or fasting) or fluid losses (such as 1044 
gastrointestinal illness or excessive heat exposure).  1045 
After initiating therapy, participants will be monitored for increased urination and dehydration. 1046 
Participants will be informed that dehydration may increase the risk of hypotension and, 1047 
therefore, will be encouraged to increase their fluid intake while taking the medication.  1048 
Participates will also be advised that a majority of infections can be prevented by maintaining 1049 
attention to basic hygiene include regular washing after urination.  1050 
Ketoacidosis is a common adverse reaction with the use of Empagliflozin.  Ketone measurement 1051 
instructions are detailed in section 10.5.  1052 
While very rare, participants treated with Empagliflozin may present with pain or tenderness, 1053 
erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, and should be 1054 
assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, the study team  will assess and refer the participant 1055 
for appropriate care.  Empagliflozin will be discontinued and blood glucose levels will be closely 1056 
monitored, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control. The study physician 1057 
will contact the participant’s personal physician.  1058 
 
 1059 
The study is being conducted in compliance with the policies described in the study policies 1060 
document, with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, with 1061 
the protocol described herein, and with the standards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  1062 
Whenever possible, data will be directly collected in electronic case report forms, which will be 1063 
considered the source data.  1064 
The protocol is considered a significant risk device study, due to the fact that the closed loop 1065 
system is experimental.  Therefore, an investigational device exemption (IDE) from the U.S. Food 1066 
and Drug Administration (FDA) is required to conduct the study.   1067

become life -threatening, is not necessarily considered a serious adverse event).  1078 
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitaliza tion.  1079 
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 1080 
conduct normal life functions ( life threatening).  1081 
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  1082 
Is considered a significant medical event by the investigator based on medical judgment (e.g., 1083 
may jeopardize the participant or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one 1084 
of the outcomes listed above).  1085 
 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  1086 
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused 1087 
by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in 1088 
nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a 1089 
suppleme ntary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with 1090 
a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of participants (21 CFR 812.3(s)).  1091 
 Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  1092 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant which the device may have caused or to 1093 
which the device may have contributed. 1094 
 Device Complaints and Malfunctions  1095 
A device complication or complaint is something that happens to a device or related to device 1096 
performance, whereas an adverse event happen s to a participant.  A device complaint may occur 1097 
independently from an AE, or along with an AE.  An AE may occur without a device complaint or 1098 
there may be an AE related to a device complaint.  A device malfunction is any failure of a device 1099

seizure or coma.  These episodes may be associated with sufficient neuroglycope nia to 1125 
induce seizure or coma;  1126 
If plasma glucose measurements are not available during such an event, neurological recovery 1127 
attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence 1128 
that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.  1129 
 Hyperglycemia Events/Diabetes Ketoacidosis  1130 
Hyperglycemia not associated with an Adverse Device Effect is only reportable as an adverse 1131 
event when one of the following four  criteria is  met:  1132 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 56 of 72 
 The event involved DKA, as defined by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and 1133 
described below  1134 
Evaluation or treatment was obtained at a health care provider facility for an acute event 1135 
involving hyperglycemia or ketosis  1136 
Blood ketone level ≥1.5 mmol/L and communication occurred with a health care provider at the 1137 
time of the event  1138 
Blood ketone level ≥3.0 mmol/L, even if there was no communication with a health care 1139 
provider  1140 
Hyperglycemic events are classified as DKA if the following are present:  1141 
Symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, or vomiting  1142 
Serum ketones ≥1.5 mmol/L or large/moderate urine ketones  1143 
Ketosis as defined by symptoms and ketones regardless of treatment provided in a health care 1144 
facility  1145 
All reportable Adverse Events —whether volunteered by the participant, discovered by study 1146 
personnel during questioning, or detec ted through physical examination, laboratory test, or 1147 
other means —will be reported on an adverse event form online.  Each adverse event form is 1148 
reviewed by a Study Physician  to verify the coding and the reporting that is required.  1149 
 
 1150 
The study investigator will assess the relationship of any adverse event to be related or unrelated 1151 
by determining if there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been caused 1152 
by the study device.  1153 
To ensure consist ency of adverse event causality assessments, investigators should apply the 1154 
following general guideline when determining whether an adverse event is related:  1155 
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and the 1156 
study intervention, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by the participant’s 1157 
clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the adverse event follows 1158 
a known pattern of response to the study intervention; and/or the adverse ev ent abates or 1159 
resolves upon discontinuation of the study intervention or dose reduction and, if applicable, 1160 
reappears upon re -challenge.  1161 
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study intervention (e.g., 1162 
preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 1163 
medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal relationship to study 1164 
intervention.  1165 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 57 of 72 
 
 
 1166 
The intensity of an adverse  event will be rated on a three -point  scale: (1) mild, (2) moderate, or 1167 
(3) severe.  It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity: thus, a severe adverse 1168 
event is not necessarily serious.  For example, itching for several days may be rated as severe, 1169 
but may not be clinically serious.  1170 
MILD: Usually transient, requires no special treatment, and does not interfere with the 1171 
participant’s daily activities.  1172 
MODERATE: Usually causes a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant and may 1173 
interfere with daily activities,  but is usually ameliorated by simple therapeutic measures.  1174 
SEVERE: Interrupts a participant’s usual daily activities and generally requires systemic drug 1175 
therapy or other treatment.  1176 
 
 1177 
Adverse events will be coded per the UVA IRB web site instructions (i.e. mild, moderate, severe).   1178 
The DSMB  will review the investigator’s assessment of causality and may agree or disagree.  Both 1179 
the investigator’s and DSMB ’s assessments will be recorded.  The DSMB  will have the final say in 1180 
determining the causality.  1181 
Adverse events that continue after the participant’s discontinuation or completion of the study 1182 
will be followed until their medical outcome is determined or until no further change in the 1183 
condition is expected.  1184 
 
 1185 
The outcome of each reportable adverse event will be classified by the investigator as follows:  1186 
RECOVERED/RESOLVED – The participant recovered from the AE/SAE without sequelae.  Record 1187 
the AE/SAE stop date.  1188 
RECOVERED/RESOLVED WITH SEQUELAE – The event persisted and had stabilized without 1189 
change in the event anticipated.  Record the AE/SAE stop date.  1190 
FATAL – A fatal outcome is defined as the SAE that resulted in death.  Only the event that was 1191 
the cause of death should be reported as fatal.  AEs/SAEs that were ongoing at the time of 1192 
death; however, were not the cause of death, will be recorded as “resolved” at the time of 1193 
death.  1194 
NOT RECOVERED/NOT RESOLVED (ONGOING) – An ongoing AE/SAE is defined as the event was 1195 
ongoing with an undetermined outcome.  1196 
An ongoing outcome will require follow -up by the site in order to determine the final outcome 1197 
of the AE/SAE.  1198 
The outcome of an ongoing event at the time of death that was not the cause of death, will be 1199 
updated and recorded as “resolved” with the date of death recorded as the stop date.  1200 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 58 of 72 
 UNKNOWN – An unknown outcome is defined as an inability to access the participant or the 1201 
participant’s records to determine the outcome (for example, a participant that was lost to 1202 
follow -up). 1203 
All clinically significant abnormalities of clinical laboratory measurements or adverse events 1204 
occurring during the study and continuing at study termination should be followed by the 1205 
participant’s physician and evaluated with additional tests (if necessary) until diagnosis of the 1206 
underlying cause, or resolution.  Follow -up information should be recorded on source 1207 
documents.  1208 
If any reported adverse events are present when a participant completes the study, or if a 1209 
participant is withdrawn from the study due to an adverse event, the participant will be 1210 
contacted for re -evaluation within 2 weeks.  If the adverse event has not resolved, additional 1211 
follow -up will be performed as appropriate.  Every effort should be made by the Investigator or 1212 
delegate to contact the participant until the adverse  event has resolved or stabilized.  1213 
 
 1214 
All UADEs, ADEs, device complaints, and device malfunctions will be reported irrespective of 1215 
whether an adverse event occurred, except in the following circumstances.  1216 
The following device issues are anticipated and will not be reported but will reported as an 1217 
Adverse Event if the criteria for AE reporting described above are met:  1218 
Component disconnections  1219 
CGM sensors lasting fewer than the number of days expected per CGM labeling  1220 
CGM tape adherence issues  1221 
Pump infusion set occlusion not leading to ketosis  1222 
Battery lifespan deficiency due to inadequate charging or extensive wireless communication  1223 
Intermittent device component disconnections/communication failures not leading to system 1224 
replacement  1225 
Devic e issues clearly addressed in the user guide manual that do not require additional 1226 
troubleshooting  1227 
Skin reactions from CGM sensor placement or pump infusion set placement that do not meet 1228 
criteria for AE reporting  1229 
 
 1230 
UADEs must be reported within 10 working days to the FDA  after the sponsor first receives 1231 
notice of the adverse effect.  1232 
Other reportable adverse events, device malfunctions (with or without an adverse event) and 1233 
device complaints should be reported promptly, but there is no formal required reporting 1234 
period.  1235 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 59 of 72 
 The IDE Sponsor will investigate the UADE and if indicated, report the results of the 1236 
investigation to the IRBs, FDA , and DSMB  within 10 working days of the study team  1237 
becoming aware of the UADE per 21CFR 812.46(b) (2).   1238 
The DSMB  will determine if the UADE presents an unreasonable risk to participants. If so, the 1239 
DSMB  must ensure that all investigations, or parts of investigations presenting that risk, are 1240 
terminated as soon as possible but no later than 5 working  days a fter the DSMB  makes this 1241 
determination and no later than 15 working  days after first receipt notice of the UADE.  1242 
In the case of a device system component malfunction (e.g. pump, CGM, control algorithm), 1243 
information will be forwarded to the responsible manufacturer by the study personnel . 1244 
 
 1245 
 Participant Discontinuation  1246 
Rules for discontinuing study device use are described below.  1247 
The investigator believes it is unsafe for the participant to continue on the intervention.  This 1248 
could be due to the development of a new medical condition or worsening of an existing 1249 
condition; or participant behavior contrary to the indications for use of the device that 1250 
imposes on the participant’s safety  1251 
The participant requests that the treatment be stopped  1252 
Two distinct episodes of DKA  that are not attributable to the study drug  1253 
One distinct episode of DKA directly attributable to the study drug  1254 
Two distinct severe hypoglycemia events as defined in section 13.2.1. 1255 
 Suspending/Stopping Overall Study  1256 
In the case of an unanticipated system malfunction resulting in a severe hypoglycemia or severe 1257 
hyperglycemia event (as defined in section 13.2 ), use of the study device system will be 1258 
suspended while the problem is diagnosed.  1259 
In addition, study activities could be similarly suspended if the manufacturer of any constituent 1260 
study device requires stoppage of device use for safety reasons (e.g. product recall).  The affected 1261 
study activities may resume if the underlying problem can be corrected by a protocol or system 1262 
modification that will not invalidate the  results obtained prior to suspension. The study Medical 1263 
Monitor will review all adverse events and adverse device events that are reported during the 1264 
study and will review compiled safety data at periodic intervals (generally timed to the review of 1265 
compiled safety data by the DSMB). The DSMB  may request suspension of study activities or 1266 
stoppage of the study if deemed necessary based on the totality of safety data available.  1267 
In the event that two subjects experience urosepsis, AKI, fournier’s gangrene, severe genital 1268 
mycotic infections and hypotension requiring hospitalization, t he study will be paused to discuss 1269 
events with the DSMB . 1270

 1271 
A DSMB will review all DKA and severe hypoglycemia irrespective of relatedness to study device 1272 
use, and all serious events (including UADEs) related to study device use at the time of 1273 
occurrence. The DSMB can request modifications to the study protocol or suspension or outright 1274 
stoppage of the study if deemed necessary based on the tota lity of safety data available. Details 1275 
regarding DSMB review will be documented in a separate DSMB document.     1276

Participants using glulisine at the time of enrollment will be asked to contact their personal 1279 
physician to change their prescribed personal insulin to lispro or aspart for the duration of the 1280 
trial.  1281 
The study devices (study insulin pump, study CGM) must be removed before Magnetic Resonance 1282 
Imaging (MRI), Computed Tom ography (CT) or diathermy treatment. Participants may continue 1283 
in the trial after temporarily discontinuing use if requiring one of the treatments above.  1284 
 
 1285 
Participation in the study is voluntary. Participant may withdraw at any time.  For participants 1286 
who do withdraw  from the study , the study team will determine if their data will be used in 1287 
analysis.  1288

 Chapter 15  Statistical Consideration  1294 
 
 1295 
As presented in Figure 1, this study uses a randomized controlled design, with participants 1296 
randomly assigned to four groups as follows : 1297 
a. Groups 1 and 2 are assigned to Experimental condition – use of SGLT2 inhibitor 1298 
(Empagliflozin) plus technology  (CGM, Basal IQ or Control IQ) 1299 
b. Groups 3 and 4 are assigned to Control condition – no use of SGLT2 inhibitors; 1300 
use of technology onl y (CGM, Basal IQ or Control IQ) 1301 
All four groups participate in a 1 -2 week baseline CGM sessions, after which Groups 1 and 3 begin 1302 
use of Control IQ, while Groups 2 and 4 begin use of Basal IQ. After using Control IQ or Basal IQ 1303 
for 4 or 2 weeks, respectively, all groups switch to use of the alternative technology (Figure 1).  1304 
The primary purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining SGLT2 1305 
inhibitors with closed loop control, and to gauge the effect size of the outcomes listed below. 1306 
Nevertheless, the projected sample size  of N=40 (N= 60 recruited) participants is expected to 1307 
results in statistically significant differences on some outcomes:  1308 
Primary Outcome:  CGM -measured time in the target range 70 -180mg/dl (TIR) during the day;  1309 
Hierarchical secondary outcomes:  24/7 CGM tim e in range <70mg/dl; 24/7 CGM -measured 1310 
average glucose; CGM -measured glucose variability (coefficient of variation, CV) during the day; 1311 
risks for hypo - and hyperglycemia.  1312 
Analysis Overview:  The overall analysis will follow Intention -to-treat (ITT) approach, with each 1313 
participant analyzed according to the treatment assigned by initial randomization. The study 1314 
design includes repeated measures on all outcomes; thus, we will use a linear mixed -effect model 1315 
that corresponds well to this structure. The mixed model will use “Subject” as a random factor 1316 
and “Group” as a fixed factor, e.g. using the Linear Mixed Models procedure in SPSS. We should 1317 
note that similar results may be generated by repeated measures ANOVA, but mixed models 1318 
handle missing data better (e.g.  ANOVA only uses listwise deletion, which could reduce power 1319 
and introduce bias towards study completers). A mixed model is also more flexible and will allow 1320 
us to address additional questions, such as clustering of subjects or introducing time between 1321 
assessments as a continuous variable.  1322 
Data Sources:  Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data acquired every 5 minutes during the 1323 
baseline and throughout the study. CGM data will be used to compute established metrics of 1324 
glycemic control (e.g. time in ranges), risks for hypo - and hyperglycemia, e.g. the Low and High 1325 
BG Indices (LBGI/HBGI), and CV, as recommended by the Consensus on Use of CGM, to which our 1326 
team contributed substantially.  1327 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 63 of 72 
 Handling of Missing Data:  All randomized participants who have at least 5 0% of their CGM 1328 
readings during the study period will be included in the analysis. Occasional missing CGM data 1329 
do occur during normal CGM use and these values will be ignored when summary CGM metrics 1330 
(e.g. percent times in range, LBGI, HBGI) are computed. Typically, CGM data are voluminous and 1331 
the percent of missing values is low; thus no imputation would be required. For example, in the 1332 
recently completed multi -center Protocol 3 of the International Diabetes Closed Loop Trial, 1333 
N=168 subjects (of N=168 recr uited) completed the entire 6 -month protocol, and CGM data were 1334 
available 96% of the time [15] (Table 1 ).  1335 
Safety outcomes  will be reported for all enrolled participants, irrespective of whether the 1336 
subjects were randomized or the study was completed.  1337 
Data Analysis:  The objectives of this study are addressed  by different sub- analyses of our general 1338 
analytical scheme, as follows:   1339 
Objective 1:  Effect of adding Empagliflozin to predictive low glucose suspend (Basal IQ – 2 1340 
weeks) and closed -loop control (Control IQ – 4 weeks) will be assessed by the study 1341 
randomized design (Figure 1). In this design we will have N=20 participants on Empagliflozin 1342 
and N=20 participants off Empagliflozin, beginning with Control IQ and then switching to 1343 
Basal IQ, or beginning with Basal IQ and then switching to Control  IQ. This analysis will be 1344 
done using the baseline data as covariates in a general linear model.  1345 
Objective 2:  CGM -measured effect of Empagliflozin will be assessed using the baseline CGM 1346 
data, (between Visits 2 and 3) via direct contrast between the two Experimental and two 1347 
Control groups (N=20 participants in Groups 1 -2 vs 20 participants in Groups 3 -4); 1348 
Objective 3:  CGM -measured effects of Empagliflozin added to Basal IQ will be assessed by 1349 
direct comparison of the Experimental vs Control groups during th e Basal IQ sessions (N=20 1350 
participants per arm will be available to this analysis);  1351 
Objective 4:  CGM -measured effects of Empagliflozin added to Control IQ will be assessed 1352 
by direct comparison of the Experimental vs Control groups during the Control IQ ses sions 1353 
(N=20 participants per arm will be available to this analysis);  1354 
To preserve the overall type 1 error, a hierarchical testing procedure will be used: if the primary 1355 
analysis for CGM -measured TIR 70 -180mg/dL during the day is statistically significant (p < 0.05), 1356 
then testing will proceed to the next outcome metric in the following order: CGM- measured 24/7 1357 
percent time <70mg/dL; CGM -measured average glucose; CGM -measured CV during the day; 1358 
LBGI and HBGI. This process will continue iteratively moving to the next variable down on the list 1359 
until a non- significant result (p ≥ 0.05) is observed, or all variables have been tested. If a non - 1360 
significant result is encountered, then formal statistical hypothesis testing is terminated and any 1361 
variables remaining on  the list become exploratory.  1362 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL  
 
 
CiQ-SGLT2 Inhibitor_ 19-Apr- 2021   Page 64 of 72 
 
 
 1363 
Sample Size Determination  is based on data from our Protocol 3 of the recently completed iDCL 1364 
Trial (Table 1) conducted with the same algorithm in the same population. The Pre -Post changes 1365 
in TIR in Table 1indicate effect size of >0.7 of Control IQ compared to SA P. Knowing the action of 1366 
Basal IQ and Control IQ, and the action of Empagliflozin, we can assume that Empagliflozin will 1367 
double the effect of Basal IQ and Control IQ during the day and will preserve their benefits 1368 
overnight. This, a 1:1 randomization into two Experimental vs.  two Control groups  and N=20 1369 
participants per study arm, yields a sample size on N=40 subjects to complete the study. This 1370 
sample size was computed using the G*Power 3 software under the assumptions of power=90% 1371 
and type 1 error α=0.01,  further reinforcing the feasibility of the hierarchical analyses  described 1372 
above. In our experience with long -term AP studies, we observe attrition rate of 20%, with most 1373 
dropouts occurring during the baseline prior to randomization. Thus, the recruitment  sample size 1374 
was increased to N= 60 to accommodate up to 20% attrition rate without sacrificing statistical 1375 
power. We should also note that technology improvement appears to increase the retention rate 1376 
in recent large -scale trials. For example, it the iDCL protocol 3, only 2 out of 170 recruited 1377 
participants dropped out and all 168 randomized participants completed the 6 -month study.  1378

 Overall, the studies using the AP algorithm originally developed at the University of Virginia, have 1379 
logged >65,000 days of use to date, in 31 clinical trials enrolling over 600 children and adults with 1380 
type 1 diabetes at 15 clinical centers in the U.S. and Europe ( Table 1 ). Control IQ is the third 1381 
commercial -grade generation of this algorithm, which will be used in this study.  1382 
 
 1383 
 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  1384 
To demonstrate the efficacy of Empagliflozin as adjuvant therapy added to a closed loop artificial 1385 
pancreas system (AP -EMPA) in patients with T1DM. The primary efficacy outcome variable will 1386 
be time in range (70 -180 mg/dl). Secondary efficacy outcomes will be: time below 70 mg/dl, time 1387 
above 180 mg/dl, time between 70 -140 mg/dl 5 hours postprandial, glucose variability indices 1388 
(HBGI, LBGI, ADRR). The corresponding variables obtained from the NO -AP-EMPA arm will be the 1389 
comparator.  1390 
 Secondary Outcome  1391

 Rationale for sample size determination: Use of Empagliflozin could potentially ‘double the 1434 
effect’ of Basal -IQ and Control IQ during the day by lowering postprandial glucose concentrations 1435 
based on the following rationale.  1436 
a. Studies  have demonstrated reduced hepatic glycogen synthesis resulting in 1437 
reduced net hepatic glycogen content in poorly controlled T1D compared to 1438 
nondiabetic controls [16]. In contrast, in well controlled T1DM subjects, initial 1439 
splanchnic glucose uptake was not reduced when compared to matched 1440 
nondiabetic controls [17]. Taken together, assuming usual daily carbohydrate 1441 
intake of ~ 180 grams (i. e., 60 grams per main meal) in an adult with T1DM, and a 1442 
net splanchnic extraction of ingested carbohydrates of ~ 25% [17], ~ 75% of 1443 
ingested carbohydrates (~ 135 grams) would appear daily into the circulation. 1444 
Given a relatively conservative estimate that ~ half the ingested carbohydrates 1445 
are taken up by the peripheral tissues, that leaves ~ 70 gram s of ingested 1446 
carbohydrates/day to contribute to postprandial glucose excursions.   1447 
b. Based on data obtained from the prescribing information of Empagliflozin that 10 1448 
mg of Empagliflozin results in net urinary loss of 64 grams of glucose per day [18], 1449 
it is reasonable to assume that adjuvant use of this medication with Control -IQ or 1450 
Basal- IQ would at least “double the effects” of lowering postprandial glucose 1451 
concentrati ons in this clinical trial.    1452

 Chapter 16   Data Collection and Monitoring  1453 
 
 1454 
The study data are collected through a combination of case report forms (electronic and paper) 1455 
and electronic device data files obtained from the software and  individual hardware 1456 
components.  These electronic device files and electronic CRFs are considered the primary source 1457 
documentation.  1458 
When data are directly collected in electronic case report forms, this will be considered the 1459 
source data.  Records will be  maintained in accordance with ICH E6 and institutional regulatory 1460 
requirements for the protection of confidentiality of participants.  1461 
 
 1462 
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of 2 years after the last approval of a 1463 
marketin g application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 1464 
applications in an ICH region or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal 1465 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product.  These documents should 1466 
be retained for a longer period, however, if required by local regulations.  No records will be 1467 
destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor, if applicable.  It is the responsibility of the 1468 
sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.  1469 
 
 1470 
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, Good Clinical Practices 1471 
(GCP), or procedure requirements.  The noncompliance may be either on the part of the 1472 
participant, the investigator, or the study site staff.  As a result of deviations, corrective actions 1473 
may be developed by the site and implemented as appropriate.  Major deviations will be reported 1474 
to the IRB -HSR within 7 calendar days of when the study team bec omes aware of the event.   1475

 Chapter 17  Ethics/Protection of Human Participants  1476 
 
 1477 
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with Regulations for 1478 
the Protection of Human Participants of Research codified in 45 CFR Part 46, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 1479 
CFR Part 56, and/or the ICH E6.  1480 
 
 1481 
The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials will 1482 
be submitted to the IRB for review and approval.  Approval of both the protocol and the consent 1483 
form must be obtained before any participant is enrolled.  Any amendment to the protocol will 1484 
require review and approval by the IRB before the changes are implemented to the study.  All 1485 
changes to the consent form will be IRB approved; a determination will be made regarding 1486 
whether previously consented participants need to be re -consented.  1487 
 
 1488 
 Consent Procedures and Documentation  1489 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to an individual’s agreement to participate in 1490 
the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation.  Extensive discussion of 1491 
risks and possible benefits of participation will be provided.  Consent forms will be IRB approved 1492 
and the participant will be asked to read and review the document.  The investigator or their 1493 
delegate will explain the research study to the participant  and answer any questions that may 1494 
arise.  All participants will receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehension of 1495 
the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research 1496 
participants.  P articipant  will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form 1497 
and ask questions prior to signing.  1498 
The participant wi ll sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being do ne 1499 
specifically for the study. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the 1500 
participant for their records.  The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected b y 1501 
emphasizing to them that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if they 1502 
decline to participate in this study.  1503 
 Participant and Data Confidentiality  1504 
The study monitor, representatives of the IRB or device company supplying study product may 1505 
inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but 1506 
not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) for the  participants in this study.   1507 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL

 The study participant’s contact information will be securely stored at the clinical site for internal 1508 
use during the study.  At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure 1509 
location for as long a per iod as dictated by local IRB and Institutional regulations.  1510 
Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific 1511 
reporting, will be transmitted to and stored at the University of Virginia Center for Diabetes 1512 
Technol ogy.  The study data entry and study management systems used by research staff will be 1513 
secured and password protected.  At the end of the study, all study databases may be de - 1514 
identified and archived at the University of Virginia Center for Diabetes Technol ogy.  1515

Respiratory Rate Verification  Study - Gabi SmartCare Gabi Band   
PR 2022 -495 
Summary  
Objectives of the Clinical Investigation Plan  
The purpose of this study is to conduct a Respiratory Rate accuracy Verification  comparing the Gabi SmartCare 
Gabi Band  to the Reference , an FDA cleared End Tidal Carbon Dioxide monitor (GE Datex -Ohmeda).  
 
The testing will be conducted in order to obtain a full data set for Verification  on a minimum of 2 3 participant s.  
Multiple developmental phases may be conducted and will be reviewed for  readiness for continuation to 
Verification . If modifications are warranted, the initial data sets will be used for algorithm development.  The study 
will be split up into two phases:  
• Phase I with a minimum of 8 subjects  
• Phase II with a minimum of 15 subje cts 
 
Background  
Respiratory  Rate is an important physiological measurement in the healthcare setting. The gold standard in 
Respiratory  Rate is based off of an airway measurement using end tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO 2) respiratory rate . 
 
The medical device studied under this protocol will be the non -invasive  and investigational Gabi SmartCare Gabi 
Band . All appropriate preliminary  testing on the Gabi SmartCare Gabi Band  has been successfully performed and 
demonstrates safety and efficacy for use in hu man studies prior to Clinimark’s receipt of the devices. Gabi 
SmartCare Gabi Band  is a non -invasive device that allows for real-time, remote monitoring  using a sensor applied 
on the participan t’s upper arm.   
 
Protocol Overview  
After IRB  approval, a minimum of 23 volunteer test participant s will be enrolled for the verification  study 
population .  A maximum of 60 participant s will be enrolled . An attempt will be made to include 3 darkly pigmented 
participant s or 15% of the participant  pool (whichever is larger).  Participants  will be from 0 -5 years of age with the 
following distribution:  
 
Population  Age Population  Requirement  
Neonates  0-28 days No requirement  
Infant  >1 month – 24 months  Minimum 30% of participants  
Pediatrics  >2 years – 5 years  Minimum 30% of participants  
 
Each participant  is expected to take 1-2 hours, including paperwork, sensor application, and a maximum of 60 
minutes of data collection. Each participant  will be connected to a commonly used End Tidal Carbon Dioxide 
monitor (GE Datex -Ohmeda) and the Gabi SmartCare Gabi Band. The end tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO 2) monitor will 
determine performance of respiratory rate metrics (GE Healthcare S5 Compact Monitor  with M-COVX (K001814) or 
E-CaiO (K051092) modules ). Each participant  will be instrumented with neonatal or pediatric nasal cannula that 
allows for measurement of the EtCO 2.  SpO 2 sensors may be placed on the feet and/or toes for safety monitoring 
purposes . 
 
Data will be simultaneously and continuously recorded from the Reference EtCO 2 monitor and the Device Under 
Test (DUT). Periods of quiet will be encouraged.   Data will be marked for stable quiet periods  that are useable for 
analysis . There is no additio nal follow -up required for the investigation.     
 
One minute epoch s will be generated  from the stable data periods for analysis .   For verification , the  Reference  
EtCO 2 waveform will be scored by counting the respiratory peaks per minute  (See Appendix B: Sample Waveform

There are no anticipated risks or adverse device effects to be assessed. There are no contraindications for use in 
the proposed study / study population. There may be other risks to the participant  associated with the device or 
procedure that are unforesee able at this time.  
 
Sensor s 
Sensor placement involves positioning sensors on volunteer participant  in the same manner that is used on 
hospitalized patients . The sensors may be warm to the touch. Under normal operating conditions, no fault 
conditions, the sensors are not expected to overheat. If the sensors are too warm, they will be removed 
immediately.  Adhesive sensors or tape may cause some irritations to t he skin in some participant s. Every effort 
will be made to minimize products with natural rubber or latex. Products containing natural rubber or latex will be 
identified.  The risk in the use of the sensor is believed to be minimal . 
 
Nasal Cannula  
The nasa l cannula are made of soft, flexible plastic so as to minimize the discomfort level as much as is reasonably 
possible. Materials may cause some skin irritations. Insertion and removal of a nasal cannula may cause nasal 
irritation, discomfort, or pain.  
 
General Electrical Hazards  
Electrical hazards are a potential risk with all electrical equipment. The equipment used in this study has been 
designed to meet applicable safety standards. The equipment will be safety and functionally tested prior to 
participant  use. The possibility of any electrical hazard is extremely remote.  
 
Benefits  
The benefits to the study are to the advancement of non -invasive medical monitoring of patients by improving 
accuracy and performance of the monitors. There are no direct benefit s to the participant s involvement  in this 
study other than being a paid volunteer. The only alternative to this study is to NOT participate.  
 
Design of the Clinical Investigation  
Method  
The purpose of this study is to conduct a Respiratory Rate accuracy Verification  comparing the Gabi SmartCare 
Gabi Band  to the Reference, an FDA cleared End Tidal Carbon Dioxide monitor (GE Datex -Ohmeda).  
 
This study is a comparative, single -center, non -randomized study in a minimum of 23 participant s for the 
verification . Each participant  test is expected to take approximately 1 -2 hours. Typically, up to 4 participant s will be 
run per day.  It is expected that the data collection will take two days for Phas e II and four day s for Phase II . A 
maximum of 60 participant s will be enrolled. An attempt will be made to include 3 darkly pigmented participant s 
(Fitzpatrick of 5 or 6) or 15% of the participant  pool (whichever is larger).  Participant s will be from 0 -12 years of 
age with the following distribution:  
 
Population  Age Population  Requirement  
Neonates  0-28 Days  No requirement  
Infant  >1 month – 24 months  Minimum 30% of participants  
Pediatrics  >2 years – 12 years  Minimum 30% of participants  
 
The parent or guardian will be provided an IRB approved Informed Consent. As applicable, parent or guardian will 
be told about any new information that might change their decision to participate. Participant s whose parent or 
guardian have completed the inf ormed consent , completed  the Participant Demographics and Screening Record

Each participant  will be connected to a commonly used End Tidal Carbon Dioxide mon itor (GE Datex -Ohmeda) and 
the Gabi SmartCare Gabi Band. The end tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO 2) monitor will determine performance of 
respiratory rate metrics (GE Healthcare S5 Compact Monitor with M-COVX (K001814) or E-CaiO (K051092) 
modules ). Each particip ant will be instrumented with neonatal or pediatric nasal cannula that allows for 
measurement of the EtCO 2.  SpO 2 sensors may be placed on the feet and/or toes for safety monitoring purposes.  
 
Data will be simultaneously and continuously recorded from the Reference EtCO 2 monitor and the Device Under 
Test (DUT). Periods of quiet will be encouraged.  Data will be marked for stable quiet periods that are useable for 
analysis. There is no additional follow -up required for the investigation.     
 
One minute epoch s will be generated from the stable data periods for analysis.   For verification , the Reference 
EtCO 2 waveform will be scored by counting the respiratory peaks per minute (See Appendix B: Sample Waveform 
Scoring Form for an example).  The reviewers counti ng the raw EtCO 2 waveform will be blinded to the results from 
the test device. The DUT data will be averaged over the corresponding one minute period.  The Accuracy root -
mean -square (A rms) will be the basis for evaluation and acceptance.  
 
To ‘Pass’ this te st the Gabi SmartCare Gabi Band  (Device Under Test ) must demonstrate a respiratory rate Accuracy 
root -mean -square (A rms) of ≤3 .0 breaths per minute when compared to the Reference EtCO 2 monitor .

Statistical Analysis  
Clinimark will  perform the s tatistical analysis for the verification  phase.    
 
The Reference Respiratory Rate based on EtCO 2 will be collected simultaneous to the Device Under Test 
Respiratory Rate  during one minute epochs during quiet, stable periods . The data will be paired based on syncing 
of the data collection system clocks. During the stable data sets , the DUT data will b e averaged in approximately 60 
second intervals. The Reference EtCO 2 waveform will be scored by counting the respiratory peaks per minute (See 
Appendix B: Sample Waveform Scoring Form for an example).  The reviewers counting the raw EtCO 2 waveform 
will be blinded to the results from the test device.  
 
The final pairing to be analyzed is Reference EtCO 2 scored and counted waveform with the average of the 
simultaneous 60 second period for the DUT. The Accuracy root -mean -square (A rms) will be the basis for eval uation 
and acceptance.  
 
Endpoint / Comparator  
The primary objective of this study is to compare the accuracy of the device under test for the measurement of 
respiratory rate to the Reference, which is an End Tidal Carbon Dioxide Monitor (EtCO 2). For verifi cation , the EtCO 2 
waveform will be scored by counting the respiratory peaks per minute.  
 
The endpoint of interest is accuracy as measured by the Accuracy root -mean -square (A rms) difference between the 
Device Under Test (DUT) and the Reference Respiratory Rate as counted by  EtCO 2 scored waveform (Ref) for all 
stable respiratory periods where

Acceptance Criteria: Passing requires an A rms of ≤3.0cpm . 
 
Sample Size Justification  
This study will utilize a sample size of 20 participant s with 7 to 11 usable data points per participant , providing 
>200 data points over the specified breath per minute range.  
 
Success for this study is defined as A RMS £ 3cpm . The A RMS statistic measures accuracy of a device under test (DUT) 
when compared to a reference device (REF) over a range of values. Accuracy, measured by the A RMS statistic, can 
be affected by both random and systematic components of error. Here we estimate power to obtain an A RMS £ 
3cpm  for this study through simulation using parameters estimated from two preliminary studies  conducted 
previously by Clinimark . Respiratory rate study 1 composed of 894 data points from 18 study participants. 
respiratory rate study 2 composed of 913 data points from 20 study participants. Both studies had respiratory rate 
targets of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 breaths per minute. The A RMS statistics are 2.8 cpm  and 1.2 cpm  for 
Study 1 and Study 2 respectively. For more informati on about the results and standard respiratory rate metrics 
please refer to ‘Summary of Respiratory Rate Data and Results from Clinimark Studies’ dated May 1, 2019. These 
preliminary data contain the features of real data, such as within participant  correlation that is present due to 
repeated measurements on the same study participants. Note this sample size was conducted on studies with 
adult populations  where paced breathing can be used to get a range of repository rates.  Participants in this stud y 
will breathe  at their natural rate.  
 
Repeated measures within participant s is a common practice in the pulse oximetry field but is known to potentially 
lead to within participant  correlation, which is accounted for in these power estimates. Linear mixed  models 
(LMM) were used to estimate parameters for each study in order to take into account repeated measures within 
participant s. DUT was treated as the dependent variable. Participant  was treated as a random effect, and REF was 
treated as a fixed effect.  Parameter estimates from the mixed model were used as parameter estimates for 
simulations. The variance between participant s in the mixed model results were used to model within individual 
correlation. Residual variance was used to model variance within participant s. The estimated effect of REF was 
modeled as slope. The simulation model also incorporated mean bias. The simulation model was as follows:  
𝐷𝑈𝑇!"=𝑚×𝑅𝐸𝐹!"+	𝐵+	𝜎#
$%&'%%( +	𝜎#
'!&)!( 
• 𝑚 = slope;  𝐵 = mean bias; 𝜎# = variance ; 
• 𝑖 = measure; 𝑗 = individual  
Simulations were performed for the studies with a range of 10 to 38 individuals and 1 to 5 measurements at each 
respiratory rate target of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 breaths per minute, for a total of 145 different  study 
size combinations. For each study size, 10,000 simulations were performed and the percentage of simulated 
studies that passed was taken as the estimate of power for that study size combination. Parameter estimates from 
study 1 resulted in the most c onservative power estimates, and are as follows:  
𝑚:0.97039  
𝐵: -0.08434  
𝜎#
$%&'%%( : 0.4724  
𝜎#
'!&)!(: 7.04  
Based on parameter estimates from study 1 the following combinations study sizes would have >80% to obtain 
ARMS £ 3cpm : (Participant s x measurements) 27x9, 16x18, 11x27, 10x36. A study design with 30 participant s and 18 
measurements per participant  has >80% power to obtain A RMS £ 3cpm  given the expectation that the device

There will not be any follow -up procedures for withdrawn or discontinued participant s required, unless a follow -up 
is required a t the Investigator’s discretion . 
 
Consideration for early termination or suspension of the investigatio n is tied to unanticipated equipment failure or 
a decision by the sponsor or the site. Both  Gabi SmartCare  and Clinimark reserve the right to discontinue the study 
at any time for administrative or other reasons. Written notice of study termination will be  submitted to the 
investigator in advance of such termination. Termination of a specific site can occur because of, but not limited to, 
inadequate data collection, low participant  enrollment, or non -compliance with the protocol or other research 
requirements.  
 
Early termination results when the study is  closed prior to the end of the study. A study suspension is  a temporary 
postponement of the study activities related to enrollment. Both are possible for the study.  If the study is 
terminated or suspended, no additional enrollment will be allowed unless otherwise informed by the sponsor. The 
current participant s will be followed according to the protocol.  
 
If the study is t erminated prematurely or suspended by the sponsor/investigator, the sponsor /investigator will 
promptly inform the regulatory authorities (if required) of the termination and the reason(s). IRB/IECs will also be 
promptly informed and provided with the reas on(s) for termination or suspension by the sponsor/ investigator. 
The investigator will promptly inform the participant s and assure appropriate follow -up for the participant . 
 
If the investigator (or IRB/IEC) terminates or suspends the investigation the in vestigator will promptly inform the 
institution (if required) and the IRB/IEC, and provide a detailed written explanation of the termination or 
suspension. The investigator will promptly inform the participant s and assure appropriate therapy and follow -up 
for the participant s. The sponsor will inform the regulatory authorities (if required).  
 
Withdrawal of IRB approval shall be reported to the sponsor by the investigator within 2 working days.  
 
In case of early termination of the study, all study participan ts should be followed until the resolution of any 
pending adverse event(s).

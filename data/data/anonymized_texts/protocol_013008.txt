Study Title:  
A prospective, double -masked, randomized, multicenter, placebo -controlled, parallel- group study assessing the 
safety and ocular hypotensive efficacy and optimum concentration to be used clinically of netarsudil ophthal mic 
solution  in Japanese/Japanese- American  subjects with open -angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in the 
United States 
Study Number:  
AR-13324- CS205 
Study Phase:  
2 
Primary Objective(s) : 
In this Phase 2 study, the primary objectives are to evaluate:  
• The ocular hypotensive efficacy of netarsudil ophthalmic solution relative to its placebo over a 
28-day period 
• The ocular and systemic safety of netarsudil ophthalmic s olution relative to its placebo over a 
28-day period 
Secondary Objective(s): 
None.  
Study Design:  
This will be a 28 -day, double -masked, randomized, multicenter, placebo -controlled, parallel group efficacy and 
safety trial evaluating reduction of elevated i ntraocular pressure (IOP) with n etarsudil ophthalmic solution. The  
purpose of this s tudy is to assess the efficacy and saf ety of netarsudil ophthalmic solution  (0.02% and 0.04% ) 
compared to its placebo in Japanese or Japanese- American subjects that are at  least 18 years of age with 
open -angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT).  
All investigational products will be dosed in both eyes (OU) once daily (QD) in the evening (PM). Subjects 
eligible to be enrolled in this study will be those of Japanese ethnicity within the second generation, with a 
diagnosis of either OAG or OHT that are on treatment with a topical ocular hypotensive medication. 
Approximately 180 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Subjects who agree to participate in this study and are enrolled will attend a total of 6 study visits: a Screening Visit, Qualification Visit #1, Qualification Visit 
#2/Day 1 (baseline), Week 1 (Day 8), Week 2 (Day 15), and Week 4 (Day 29).  
Subjects currently using ocular hypotensive medications  will be required to washout of their pre -study ocular 
hypotensive medication for a prescribed period (i.e., 5 days to at least 4 weeks, depending on the medication) 
prior to attending Qualification Visit #1. Subjects eligible to be enrolled in this study must meet all inclusion 
criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at each of the Screening Vis it and Qualification Visits #1 and #2. 
Subjects will receive a baseline eye examination including IOP measurements at the Screening Visit and Qualification Visits #1 and #2 and, if deemed eligible, will be enrolled at Qualification Visit #2 and assigned to  
placebo or 1 of 2 investigational products in a 1:1:1 ratio according to a computer -generated randomization list. 
Randomization will take place using IWRS methodology and will stratify subjects by site .  
Randomized subjects will dose the assigned investig ational product in both eyes QD in the evening (between 
20:00 and 22:00 hours) beginning on Day 1 and up to and including the evening prior to the final visit at

    significant blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, or a history of herpes simplex or zoster keratitis in either eye 
at screening  
9. Use of ocular medication in either eye of any kind within 30 days of screening a nd throughout the study, 
with the exception of a) ocular hypotensive medications (which must be washed out according to the 
provided schedule), b) lid scrubs (which may be used prior to, but not after, screening), c) lubricating drops for dry eye (which ma y be used throughout the study), or d) non- steroid allergy drops (note: must not 
contain a vasoconstrictor) as prescribed by the Investigator 
10. Mean central corneal thickness using optical pachymetry greater than 620 μm in either eye at screening  
11. Any abnorma lity preventing reliable applanation tonometry of either eye (e.g., keratoconus)  
12. Known hypersensitivity to benzalkonium chloride or excipients of netarsudil ophthalmic solution  
Systemic:  
13. Clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory tests at screening  
14. Clinically significant systemic disease which might interfere with the study  
15. Participation in any investigational study within 30 days prior to screening  
16. Systemic medication that could have a substantial effect on IOP within 30 days prior to screening, or  
anticipated during the study, including any corticosteroid -containing drug regardless of route of 
administration  
17. Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy, or not using a medically acceptable form of birth control.  A n adult woman is considered to be of childbearing potential 
unless she is 1 year post -menopausal or 3 months post -surgical sterilization All females of childbearing 
potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test result at the screening examination and  must not intend 
to become pregnant during the study 
Study Population:  
A total of approximately 180 Japanese/Japanese -American subjects will be enrolled in this study at 
approximately 35 investigational sites in the US comprising a total of 60 subjects per treatment arm for each of 
the 3 treatment arms. Subjects will be at  least 18 years of age with diagnosed OAG or OHT, each of whom 
meets all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  
Investigational Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration:  
• Netarsudil Ophthalmic Solution 0.02%, 1 drop QD (PM), OU  
• Netarsudil Ophthalmic Solution 0.04%, 1 drop QD (PM), OU  
• Netarsudil Ophthalmic Solution  Placebo , 1 drop QD (PM), OU  
Duration of Treatment:  
Dosing will continue daily for 28 days cont inuously . 
Efficacy Assessments:  
The primary efficacy outcome will be the comparison of netarsudil ophthalmic solution s (0.02% and 0.04%)  
relative to placebo for mean diurnal IOP within a treatment at Week 4 (Day 29) by Goldmann Applanation 
Tonometry.  
Seco ndary efficacy outcomes will be comparison of netarsudil ophthalmic solution s relative to placebo for:  
• Mean diurnal IOP at Weeks 1 and 2 (Days 8 and 15, respectively)  
• Mean change from baseline in mean diurnal IOP at each post -treatment visit  
• Mean percent change from baseline in mean diurnal IOP at each post -treatment visit  
• Mean IOP at each post -treatment time point  
• Mean change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each post -treatment time point

     Mean percent change from diur nally adjusted baseline IOP at each post-treatment time point 
 Percentages of subjects achieving pre-specified mean , mean change, and percent mean change in mean 
diurnal IOP levels 
Other secondary efficacy analyses may be carried out as  described in the study Statistical Analysis Plan. 
Safety Assessments: 
The primary safety measures in both eyes of enrolled subjects will include: 
 Ocular symptoms/adverse events 
 Best corrected visual acuity 
 Objective findings of biomicroscopic examinations  (i.e., anterior segment examinations including 
evaluation of cornea, conj unctiva, lids, and lens) 
 Dilated ophthalmoscopy, including vertical cup-disc ratio measurements 
Other safety assessments will be: 
 Systemic safety assessments as measured by heart rate, blood pressure, and clinical laboratory evaluations 
(including hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis)  
 Pregnancy testing (for women of child bearing potential) 
Statistical Methods: 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the mean diurnal IOP across subjects within treatme nt group at Week 4.  
Assuming a two-sided test with alpha = 0.05 and a comm on standard deviati on (SD) of 3.5 mmHg at each time 
point yielding a common SD of 3.0 for the diurnal mean assuming a correlation among time points of 0.60, 49 
ITT subjects per arm yields at least 90% power to demonstrate superiority of netarsudil (0.02% or 0.04%) to 
placebo in mean diurnal study eye IOP (a verage of 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours) at the Week 4 Visit assuming 
a difference of at least 2.0 mmHg in  the mean diurnal IOP. The study  will be considered a success and 
superiority of netarsudil to placebo will be concluded if the two-sided p-value ≤ 0.05 at Week 4. With 60 ITT 
subjects per arm, each test has 95% power to demonstr ate superiority of netarsudil (0.02% or 0.04%) to 
placebo.  
The primary analysis of the primary outcome will employ a linear model with mean diurnal IOP at Week 4 as 
the response, baseline mean diurnal IOP as a covariate, and treatment as a main effect factor, using the intent to 
treat population with Monte Carlo Markov Chain multiple imputation techniques used to impute missing data.  
The least squares mean differences (netarsudil – placebo ) will be presented separately for netarsudil 0.02% and 
0.04% as well as 2-sided p-values and 95% confidence in tervals (CIs). Inference will be made on the 2-sided 
p-values. Superiority for a concentration (0.02% and 0.04% ) will be concluded if the 2-sided p-value, for testing 
the difference (netarsudil – placebo) to 0, ≤ 0.05 and the point estimate of the difference < 0 at Week 4 for that 
concentration. 
There will be no adjustment for the multiplicity of the 2 active concentrations (0.02% and 0.04%) tested against 
placebo in this Phase 2 study.

    1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Investigational Product 
Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy that causes characteristic loss of visual fields and 
can eventually lead to blindness.  A major  risk factor for glaucomatous visual field loss is 
elevated intraocular pressure ( AGIS 2000 ).  
The need for improved e fficacy of glaucoma medications is supported by several clinical 
studies.  Studies such as the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial ( Heijl 2002), the Ocular 
Hypertension Treatment Study ( Kass 2002; Kass 2010), and the Collaborative Normal 
Tension Glaucoma Study Group ( Collaborative Normal-Tension Glaucoma Study Group 
1998) support the general conclusion that every millimeter of reduction in intraocular pressure ( IOP) is significant for delaying disease progression.  This conclusion holds true not 
only for high risk ocular hypertensive and glaucoma subjects with elevated IOPs but also for glaucoma subjects with IOPs in the normal range.  Thus, the goal for treating subjects should be to lower IOP to the point that it prevents further damage to the optic nerve and ac hieve 
this without sacrificing safety or convenience.   
Inhibitors of Rho kinase (ROCK) have emerged as a new class of IOP-lowering agents and 
are currently being tested in the clinic ( Chen 2011; Kopczynski 2014).  Netarsudil mesylate 
(AR-13324) is a novel Rho kinase and norepinephrine transporter inhibitor developed at 
Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for topical ophthalmic use for lowering IOP.  In both rabbit and monkey studies, netarsudil produces large reductions in IOP with a longer duration of action 
than reported for previously characterized Rho kinase inhibitors.  Netarsudil ophthalmic 
solution has been shown to provide significant IOP lowering when dosed once- daily (QD) in 
the evening (Clinical Study Reports  AR-13324-CS202, AR -13324-CS301, 
AR-13324-CS302, and  AR-13324-CS304), and reduces IOP potentially through several 
mechanisms: increasing trabecular outflow ( Clinical Study Report AR-13324- CS102; 
Wang  2015) , decreasing aqueous humor production ( Clinical Study Report 
AR-13324-CS102; Wang 2015), and reducing episcleral venous pressure ( Clinical Study 
Report AR-13324-CS102; Kiel 2015).  The ability to reduce aqueous production may be 
related to netarsudil in vitro  inhibitory activity against monoamine transporters, including the 
norepinephrine transpor ter. 
The present study is a Phase 2 efficacy and safety study comparing netarsudil ophthalmic 
solution 0.02% and 0.04% to its placebo administered QD over the course of 28 days. This study will run concurrently with a Phase 1 ocular and systemi c safety study comparing 
netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% and 0.04% to its placebo after a single dose and daily QD dosing over a 7- day period (Protocol  AR-13324-CS104). Both studies will recruit 
subjects with Japanese ethnicity within the second gener ation in the US.

    1.2 Findings from Non- clinical and Clinical Studies  
Non-clinical 
Proof of concept for n etarsudil in lowering IOP was established in primary pharmacology 
studies in 2 species, rabbits and monkeys.  Safety pharmacology (central nervous system, 
respiratory , and cardiovascular) of n etarsudil was investigated in rats and dogs. 
Pharmacokinetics/bio distribution of netarsudil was assessed after systemic and ocular 
administration of netarsudil . Ocular toxicity was investigated in studies up to 6 months in 
rabbits and up to 9 months in monkeys. Repeated dose toxicity of systemically administered netarsudil was investigated in studies up to 28 days in rats and dogs. Reproductive toxicity 
was investigated in rats and rabbits. The non- clinical program for netarsudil also included a 
standard range of genotoxicity tests. 
Clinical  
The clinical development of netarsudil ophthalmic solution includes pharmacokinetics, 
tolerability , and dose-response investigations. The assessment of the ocular and systemic 
safety  of netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% in two Phase 1 clinical studies  (Clinical Study 
Reports  AR-13324-CS101 and AR -13324-CS102) has been completed.  Results from a 
previous Phase 2 study (Clinical Study Report AR -13324-CS201) investigating a range of 
netarsudil concentrations (0.01%, 0.02%, and  0.04%) were used to select the appropriate 
concentration s of netarsudil ophthalmic solution  to be tested in the present study (0.02% and 
0.04%). Three well -controlled Phase 3 clinical studies  (Clinical Study Repo rts 
AR-13324-CS301, AR -13324-CS302, and AR -13324-CS304) evaluating the safety and 
efficacy netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% have been completed.  
Detailed information on nonclinical and clinical studies completed with netarsudil 
ophthalmic solution is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.3 Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects  
As no other compounds of this class are approved, and only early stage clinical experience is  
available, the risks and benefits are not well understood at this time.  Given the 
pharmacology of this class of agents and the results of previous Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical studies by the Sponsor (Clinical Study Reports AR -13324-CS101, 
AR-13324-CS102, AR -13324-CS201, AR -13324-CS202, AR -13324-CS301, and 
AR-13324-CS302, and AR -13324-CS304) , it is expected that  transient hyperemia of the 
conjunctiva will be observed.  The reader should refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for more detailed information on potential risks due to use of netarsudil ophthalmic solution .   
The majo r potential benefit from exposure to netarsudil ophthalmic solution is reduction in 
IOP in subjects with open angle glaucoma ( OAG ) or ocular hypertension ( OHT ).  A 
long- term benefit of reduced IOP could be slowing of disease progression and preservation 
of vision in subjects when measured over periods of months to years

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This will be a 28 -day, double-masked, randomized, multicenter, placebo -controlled, 
parallel -group efficacy and safety trial evaluating reduction of elevated IOP with netarsudil 
ophthalmic solution. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of 
netarsudil ophthalmic solution (0.02% and 0.04%) compared to its placebo  in Japanese or 
Japanese- American subjects that are at least 18 years  of age with OAG or OHT.  
All investigational products will be dosed in both eyes (OU) QD in the evening (PM). 
Subjects eligible to be enrolled in this study will be those of Japanese ethnicity within  the 
second generation, with a diagnosis of either OAG or OHT that are on treatment with a topical ocular hypotensive medication. Approximately 180 subjects  will be enrolled . Subjects 
who agree to participate in this study and are enrolled in the study wil l attend a total of 6 
study visits: a Screening Visit, Qualification Visit #1, Qualification Visit #2/Day 1 (baseline), Week 1 (Day 8), Week 2 (Day 15), and Week 4 (Day  29). 
Subjects currently using ocular hypotensive medications will be required to washout of their 
pre-study ocular hypotensive medication for a prescribed period (i.e., 5 days to at least 4 
weeks, depending on the medication) prior to attending Qualification Visit #1. Subjects Screening Visit

    eligible to be enrolled in this study must meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria at each of the Screening Visit and Qualification Visits  #1 and #2. Subjects will 
receive a baseline eye examination including IOP measurements at the Screening Visit and 
Qualification Visits #1 and #2 and, if dee med eligible, will be enrolled at Qualification Visit 
#2 and assigned to placebo or 1 of 2 investigational products in a 1:1:1 ratio according to a computer- generated randomization list. Randomization will take place using Interactive Web 
Response System ( IWRS ) methodology and will stratify subjects by site .  
Randomized subjects will dose the assigned investigational product in both eyes QD in the evening (between 20:00 and 22:00 hours) beginning on Day 1 and up to and including the 
evening prior to the final visit at Visit 6 (Week  4). Procedures conducted at each of s tudy 
Visits 4-6 will include safety measures and efficacy measurements, including IOP assessments.  At Visits 4 -6 (Weeks  1, 2, and  4, respectively),  IOP will be assessed at 
08:00, 10:00 and 16:00 hours.  Following completion of the Visit 6 ( Week 4 ) study visit 
procedures, subjects will exit the study. For subjects who discontinue early, every possible effort will be made to assure there is a final visit that includes all examinations listed f or 
Visit 6.0 (Week  4) and dilated ophthalmoscopy.  
3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
In order to further evaluate the hypotensive efficacy of netarsudil ophthalmic solution 
relative to its placebo  in subjects with OAG or OHT  and to generate additional safety data for 
netarsudil , a double-masked, parallel group, 3- arm active- and  placebo -controlled study 
design was selected.  
As the intended route of administration for netarsudil ophthalmic solution is topical ocular, this is the route to be used in this study. The dosage regimen selected for this study is based 
on a previously completed Phase 2 study ( AR-13324-CS202) and 3 completed Phase 3 
studies ( AR-13324-CS301, AR -13324-CS302, and AR -13324-CS304) .  
Efficacy and safety resu lts with netarsudil ophthalmic solution to date have been generated in 
a mostly non-Japanese population.  In order to ensure that similar results are observed in Japanese subjects, this study is being conducted in subjects of Japanese ethnicity. 
3.3 Expected Duration of Subject Participation  
Each subject is planned to undergo a minimum washout period of their current ocular 
hypotensive medications (if needed) , followed by approximately 28 days of treatment.  
Treatment duration with the investigational product (IP)  for this study will start on the 
evening of Visit 3 (Qualification Visit #2; Day 1) and end on the evening before Visit 6 
(Week 4/Day 28).

7. Ocular trauma within the 6 months prior to screening, or ocular surgery or non- refractive 
laser treatment within the 3 months prior to screening 
8. Recent or current evidence of ocular infection or inflammation in either eye.  Current evidence of clinically significant blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, or a history of 
herpes simplex or zoster keratitis in either eye at screening  
9. Use of ocular medication in either eye of any kind within 30 days of screening and throughout the study, with the exception of a) ocular hypotensive medications (which must be washed out according to the provided schedule), b) lid scrubs (which may be used prior to, but not after, screening), c) lubricating drops for dry eye (which may be used throughout the study), or d) non-steroid allergy drops (note: must not contain a vasoconstrictor) as prescribed by the Investigator

    5. STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Description of Treatments  
5.1.1 Study Drug  
Netarsudil  mesylate (AR -13324) Ophthalmic Solution  is a sterile, isotonic, buffered aqueous 
solution containing netarsudil (0.02% or 0.04%), boric acid, mannitol, w ater for injection, 
and preserved with benzalkonium chloride .   
   
5.1.2 Placebo or Control Drug 
Netarsudil ophthalmic solution pl acebo  is a sterile, isotonic, buffered aqueous solution 
containing boric acid, mannitol, w ater for injection, and preserved with benzalkonium 
chloride .  
5.2 Treatments Administered  
Subjects will be randomized to receive IP netarsudil ophthalmic solution  (0.02% or 0.04% ) 
or its placebo  administered OU.  Subjects will instill 1 drop into each eye  QD in the evening 
between 20:00 and 22:00 hours. IP doses will be administered by the study subjects.  For 
subjects deemed unable to self -administer the doses, a guardian or alternative caregiver  will 
be asked to administer the medication. All subjects will administer study treatment for 
approximately 28 days . 
5.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient 
The study drug doses and treatment period selected for this study are based on  one Phase 1 
study (AR-13324-CS101)  and the positive outcomes seen for netarsudil in  2 previously 
completed Phase 2 studies ( AR-13324-CS201 and  AR-13324-CS202) and 3 completed Phase 
3 studies ( AR-13324-CS301, AR -13324-CS302, and AR -13324-CS304). Each dose is being 
administered QD OU in the evening (between 20:00 and 22:00 hours) in this study , since this 
dosing regimen was found to provide good efficacy and tolerability in the previous clinical studies.   
5.4 Method o f Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  
A randomization code for allocating the treatments will be prepared by an independent 
biostatistician who is not involved in the day- to-day conduct of the study. Subjects will be 
randomized using IWRS  in a 1:1:1  ratio to receive netarsudil ophthalmic solution (0.02% or 
0.04% ) or its placebo  and will stratify subjects by site . 
5.5 Masking  
Treatment assignments will be masked to the Investigator, the clinical study team ( Sponsor, 
personnel involved in day to day study management, Monitors, Data Managers, and 

  
Netarsudil Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% and 0.04%

    Statisticians), and the subjects for the duration of the study. Only in case of medical 
emergency or occurrence of AEs that warrant unmasking in the opinion of the Investigator, will the treatment assignment(s) be unmasked and made available to the Investigator and the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee. Individual unmasking by the Investigator will 
normally result in withdrawal of the subject from the study and should only be performed for the specific subject requiring unmasking in their treatment group. In the absence of medical 
need, the randomization code will not be available to the above personnel until after the study is completed and the database is unlocked.  
If the Investigator feels it is necessary to unmask a subject’s treatment assignment after an 
emergency situation, the Investigator should contact the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee. After consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee, a d ecision will 
be made as to whether or not the treatment should be unmasked. The treatment assignment will be revealed on a subject -by-subject basis, thus leaving the masking on the remaining 
subjects.  
If there is an emergency situation in which treatment of an AE requires immediate 
unmasking, and the Investigator is unable to contact the Sponsor Medical Monitor or 
designee, the Investigator may unmask the treatment. The Investigator will perform the 
unmasking through the IWRS or other randomization system. In the case of such unmasking 
in an emergency situation, the Investigator should contact the Sponsor immediate ly and 
document unmasking in writing, recording the date, time, and reason for unmasking the study drug treatment in the source documentation.   
5.6 Concomitant Therapy  
As noted in Section 5.7.1, subjects using ocular hypotensive medications at screening are 
required to undergo a washout of their current ocular hypotensive medications.  Intermittent 
use of over-the- counter (OTC) artificial tear lubricant products is acceptable, with a 
minimum of 10 minutes between OTC products and study medication.  However, concurrent therapy with any form of ocular hypotensive medications (prescription or OTC) is not allowed during the study. 
Disallowed  ocular medications include: 
• Miotics  
• Epinephrine- related  compounds 
• Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (ocular or systemic) 
• α-adrenoceptor agonists 
• β- adrenoceptor anta gonists 
• Muscarinic agonists (e.g.,  pilocarpine)

Confidential  Page 24 of 85  
    • Prostaglandin analogues  
• Any corticosteroid containing ocular or systemic drug is disallowed during the study 
regardless of route of administration  
Systemic therapy with agents other than corticosteroids that could have an effect on IOP is to 
be consistent in dose, regimen and agent within the 30 days prior to screening and throughout 
the study. For example, a subject can be treated with a systemic β-adrenoceptor antagonist as long as the particular agent and its dose and regimen had been consistent for the 30 days prior to screening, and there is no reason to believe that alteration would be necessary at some point later during the study. Subjects should be cautioned to avoid use of alcohol or the use of any drugs such as cannabis or marijuana during the study visit days. 
Contact lens wear during the study is acceptable. However, subjects must remove their 
contact lenses at least 30 minutes before instillation of study medication, and not place them in their eye(s) until 30 minutes after instillation.  
Use of all medications should be documented on the appropriate case report form ( CRF ).  
Investigators are encouraged to contact the Sponsor/Sponsor representative for any questions regarding allowed medications. Judgment of continued study participation by the subject, and inclusion of this subject’s subsequent visits in the safety and efficacy analysis will be made by the Sponsor. 
All medications which the subject has taken within 30 days prior to screening and duri ng the 
study will be recorded in the CRF. The name of the drug, dose, route of administration, 
duration of treatment and indication will be recorded for each medication. For combination products (e.g., Contac
®), the brand name is required.  For non-combination products, the 
generic name is desired. The use of routine ophthalmic diagnostic pharmaceutical agents (e.g., fluorescein and local anesthetic) will be allowed, and individual documentation not required. Any change in dosing parameters should also be recorded in the CRF. 
5.7 Restrictions  
5.7.1 Prior Therapy /Washout Period 
Subjects currently using ocular hypotensive medications must undergo a minimum washout 
period as specified in Table 1.   
If washout is to be extended beyond 8 weeks (56 days) for logistical or other reasons, the 
Sponsor should be contacted.

5.7.2 Fluid and Food Intake  
On days that  diurnal IOP measurements are made, subjects may not consume alcohol . 
Otherwise, t here are no general restrictions on fluid or food intake for subjects participating 
in this study.   
5.7.3 Subject Activity Restrictions  
On days that  diurnal IOP measurements are made, subjects may not engage in strenuous 
activity. Otherwise, there are no restrictions on subject activities during their participation in 
this study.  
5.8 Treatment Compliance  
All subjects will be instructed on the importance of following the once-daily dosing regimen. Dosing should occur in the evening between 20:00 and 22:00 hours. As no commercially available method is readily available for direct, single -container monitoring of treatment 
adherence with multi-dose ophthalmic products, no formal measure of treatment compliance 
is planned.  Subjects should be reminded at all visits to dose every evening. In addition, subjects will be provided with dosing reminders.  
5.9 Packaging and Labeling 
The con tainer -closure system for the netarsudil ophthalmic solution (0.02% or 0.04%) and 
netarsudil ophthalmic solution placebo in this clinical study is a white,  multi-dose low 
density polyethylene (LDPE) dropper dose ophthalmic bottle with a polypropylene white  
cap.  Each packaged unit will be labeled with an investigational label with the following minimal information: the study number, kit number, and storage statement, including a statement “For Use in Clinical Study Only.  Caution: New Drug - Limited By Fede ral (US) 
Law to Investigational Use.” or equivalent.

be stored refrigerated (2°C to 8°C/36°F to 46°F ).  Temperature of the study treatment storage 
location at the site is to be monitored using a calibrated monitoring device and documented. 
At time of dispensing, the subject will be instructed to store the bottle(s) as directed on the drug label  and to keep the bottle(s) refrigerated (2°C to 8°C/36°F to 46°F ). Subjects should 
be instructed not to freeze the product.  
5.11 Investigational Product Retention at Study Site  
5.11.1 Receipt and Disposition of Study Medication 
Study medication  will be shipped to the Investigator’s site from a central depot.  The study 
medication storage manager  at the Investigator’s site will verify study medication shipment 
records by comparing the shipping documentation accompanying the study medication to the 
study medication actually received at the Investigator’s site. If a discrepancy is noted, the appropriate individual at the Sponsor or designee must be notified immediately.  The responsible person (e.g., study coordinator) at the Investigator’s institution has to account for all used, partially used , and unused study medication . The responsible person will also 
maintain the drug accountability records. 
5.11.2 Return of Study Medication 
When the site is closed, the study is completed , or is terminated by the Sponsor; all study 
material including used and unused study medication will be returned to the Sponsor ( or its 
designee) .  All study medication accounting procedures must be completed before the study 
is considered to be concluded. The responsible person at the Investigator’s institution has to 
account for all used, partially used, and unused study medicatio n. The study medication

    6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Informed Consent  
Prior to any study procedures, the study will be discussed with each subject . Subjects wishing 
to participate must give written informed consent.  The verbal explanation of the study will 
cover all the elements specified in the written  information provided for the subject.  The 
Investigator will inform the subject of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study, including any discomfort it may entail.  The subject must be given every opportunity to clarify any points he/she does not understand and, if necessary, may ask for more information.  At the end of the interview, the subject should be given time to reflect. Subjects and/or legally authorized representative then will be required to sign and date the informed consent form.   
The informed consent form (ICF) must have received approval/favorable revie w by a 
properly constituted Institutional Review Board ( IRB) prior to use.  A copy of the signed and 
dated consent document will be given to each subject.  The original signed and dated ICF 
must be maintained in the study files at the Investigator’s site.   
The Investigator or staff is responsible for ensuring that no subject is exposed  to any study 
related examination or activity before the subject has given written informed consent.  It 
should be emphasized that the subject is at liberty to withdraw consent to participate at any 
time, without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled.  Subjects who refuse to give, or withdraw, written informed consent may not be included or continued in this study, and should be notified that discontinuation from the study will not impact on their subsequent care. 
6.2 Demographics and Medical History  
Demographic data and any ongoing medication use will be collected and recorded.  Any 
medications the subject took but discontinued within the 30 days prior to screening will also be recorded.  Significant medical history will be collected and any current underlying medical conditions, including those that began within the last 30 days and which may have resolved before screening, additionally must be recorded. 
6.3 Physical Examination 
The Investigator will review each subject’s  medical and ophthalmic history including 
systemic and ocular medication use to determ ine eligibility for this study. If enrolled, the 
Investigator will determine if there are any changes in health or concomitant medication use 
at each follow -up visit.  
The Investigator or designee will also perform the following  ophthalmic assessments  as 
described in  Appendix 2: visual acuity, visual field, IOP, biomicroscopy, central corneal 
thickness, gonioscopy, symptomatology, and dilated ophthalmoscopy.

    6.4 Vital Signs  
The Investigator or designee will measure heart rate, pulse, and blood pressure as des cribed 
in Appendix 2.  
6.5 Clinical Laboratory Tests 
6.5.1 Laboratory Parameters  
A chemistry panel , complete blood count (hematology and differential), and urinalysis will 
be performed as shown. 
Note that fasting will NOT be required and specific values may be out of the typical fasting 
range . 
The clinical laboratory results must be reviewed by the Investigator prior to subject 
enrollment, and  the tests CANNOT be indicative of any clinically significant disease in the 
opinion of the Investigator.  
6.5.2 Sample Collection, Storage and Shipping  
The site staff responsible for collecting the laboratory samples will be identified on the 
Delegation of Responsibilities Log. The laboratory responsible for processing the sample collections is . Details 
for the preparation and shipment of samples and reference ranges will be provided in the laboratory manual.  
6.5.3 Pregnancy Testing  
A urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test (only for females who are not 
diagnosed as postmenopausal or surgically sterile) will be used in this study and performed at the screening visit to immediately confirm non -pregnancy eligibility for females of 
child -bearing potential.   
The Sponsor will provide urine pregnancy tests to the sites.  Expiration dates on the pregnancy tests will be reviewed and confirmed by the site prior to use. 
If a female becomes pregnant during the study, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor 
immediately after the pregnancy is confirmed and the subject will be exited from the study.  The Investigator should follow the progress of the pregnancy until the fetus is carried to term. 
6.6 Dispensing Investigational Product 
Study staff responsible for dispensing study medication will be liste d on the Delegation of 
Responsibilities Log. When a subject meets all criteria for selection and has completed all 
screening assessments, the subject will be assigned to a treatment group according to the

maintaining a study medication accountability log . 
6.7 Efficacy Assessments  
6.7.1 Specification of the Efficacy Parameters  
The primary efficacy outcome will be the comparison of netarsudil ophthalmic solution (0.02% and 0.04%) relative to placebo  for mean diurnal IOP within a treatment at 
Week  4 (Day  29) by Goldmann Applanation Tonometry. A description of the method for 
measuring IOP to be used in this study is contained in Appendix 2.  
Secondary efficacy outcomes will be comparison of netarsudil ophthalmic solution relative to placebo  for: 
• Mean diurnal IOP at Weeks 1 and 2 (Days 8 and 15, respectively) 
• Mean change from baseline in mean diurnal IOP at each post -treatment visit 
• Mean percent change from baseline in mean diurnal IOP at each post -treatment visit  
• Mean IOP at each post -treatment time point  
• Mean change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each post -treatment time point 
• Mean percent change from diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each post -treatment time 
point 
• Percent ages of subjects achieving pre- specified mean, mean change, and percent mean 
change in mean diurnal IOP levels  
Other secondary efficacy analyses may be carried out as described in the study Statistical Analysis Plan.  
6.7.2 Method and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing of Efficacy 
Parameters  
As detailed in subsequent sections describing each visit and Appendix 1,  IOP will be 
measured at a screening visit, at 2 qualification visits after washout of ocular hypotensive medications as required, and at each post Day 1 treatment  study visit.  
6.8 Safety Assessments  
The primary safety measures in both eyes of enrolled subjects will include: 
• Ocular symptoms/adverse events

    • Best corrected visual acuity  
• Objective findings of biomicroscopic examinations (i.e., anterior segment examinations 
including evaluation of cornea, conjunctiva, lids, and lens) 
• Dilated ophthalmoscopy, including vertical  cup-disc ratio measurements  
Other safety assessments will be:  
• Systemic safety assessments as measured by heart rate, blood pressure, and clinical laboratory evaluations (including hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis)  
• Pregnancy testing (for women of child bearing potential)  
6.9 Adverse Events Assessments  
6.9.1 Performing Adverse Event (AE) Assessments  
Qualified study staff responsible for assessing adverse events (AEs) will be lis ted on the 
Delegation of Responsibilities Log.  This includes assessment of AE severity and 
relationship to study medication.  A dverse event  information may be volunteered by the 
subject or solicited by study personnel through non-leading questions. 
All AE s occurring during the study, regardless of the assumption of causal relationship, must 
be documented on the respective CRF.  Adverse events should be documented from the time 
the subject receives the first dose of study medication until 30 days after the last dose of 
study drug.  
If a subject has an ongoing AE at the time of study completion, the ongoing AE must be 
followed-up and provided appropriate medical care until the event has resolved or stabilized.  
Documentation of AEs /adverse reactions includes start date and stop date, severity, action(s) 
taken, seriousness and outcome. 
6.9.2 Adverse Event Definition  
The following definitions of terms apply to this section: 
• Adverse event . Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
• Life-threatening AE or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction (SAR). An AE  or SAR  
is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its 
occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an AE or SAR  that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
  
Netarsudil Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% and 0.04%   
Clinical Study Protocol: AR -13324 -CS205  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
   
Confidential  Page 32 of 85  
    • Serious adverse event (SAE) or serious suspected adverse reaction (SSAR) . An AE or 
SAR  is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening adverse event, subject 
hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or sig nificant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in subject hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
• Suspected adverse reaction (SAR) means any AE for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the AE .  For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE .  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
• Unexpected AE or unexpected SAR.  An AE or SAR  is considered ‘‘unexpected’’ if it is 
not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at th e specificity or severity that 
has been observed.  For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the Investigator’s Brochure referred only to 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the Investigator’s Brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or SARs  that are ment ioned in the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring 
with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
Note: Any medical condition present prior to administration of the masked study medication which remains unchanged or improved should not be recorded as an AE at subsequent visits. 
Note: If an event occurs during the washout period (prior to subject enrollment and the commencement of study medication), it should be recorded as part of the Medical History and not as an AE .  As noted in Section 7.3.1, any change in their Visit 1 (Screening) health 
status prior to enrollment should be recorded on the Medical History page of the CRF . 
Note: In the present study, Investigators are asked to use the verbatim term “conjunctival hyperemia” on the study AE form to describe observations of conjunctival redness if the ocular redness observation is increased from Visit 1 ( Screening ) observations and clinically 
meaningful.  Investigators are also asked to note all observations of conjunctival hyperemia on the biomicroscopy CRF  as well as on the study AE form.

    6.9.3 Timing  for Reporting of Adverse Events  
The AEs occurring during the study must be documented, regardless of the assumption of a 
causal relationship.  Adverse events should be documented from the time the subject receives the first dose of study medication until subject participation in the stud y has been completed.  
If a subject has 1 or more ongoing AEs at the time of study completion, the subject must be 
followed and provided appropriate medical care until the sign(s) and/or symptoms(s) of the AE have remitted or stabilized in the opinion of t he Investigator.  
When recording an AE, the following information should be provided on the study AE CRF : 
1. Action Taken with Study  Drug:  
• None 
• Investigational Product Discontinued 
• Investigational Product Interrupted 
2. Other Action Taken:  
• None 
• Non-Drug Therapy  
• New OTC or Rx Drug Added 
• Hospitalized less than 24 hours 
• Hospitalized greater than or equal to 24 hours 
3. Outcome of an adverse event is coded as : 
• Fatal  
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved 
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovered/Resolved with sequelae  
• Recovering/Resolving 
• Unknown/Lost to follow-up

    6.9.4 Severity  
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the level of discomfort or the 
degree of intensity of an AE as determined by the Investigator or reported to him/her by the 
subject.  The assessment of severity is made irrespective of study medication relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
• 1 = Mild:  present and noticeable, but not distressing, and no disruption of normal daily 
activities  
• 2 = Moderate:  bothersome, discomfort sufficient to possibly reduce or affect normal 
daily activity  
• 3 = Severe: incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
A change in severity for a reported AE will require a stop date for the previous severity and a 
new start and stop date for the new severity.  For example, a change in severity may go from mild to severe or from severe to moderate.  In either case, the start and stop dates should be recorded.   
Please note: a severe AE is not the same as a serious AE.  Seriousness of an AE (NOT severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see Section 6.9.8 for further information on serious AEs [S AEs]). 
6.9.5 Relationship  
The study medication relationship for each AE/adverse reaction should be determined by the 
Investigator using these explanations:  
• Not Related :  The event is clearly related to other factors such as subject’s clinical 
condition; therapeutic interventions, concomitant disease or therapy administered to the subject and does not follow a known response pattern to the product. 
• Unlikely Related : The event is most probably caused by other etiologies such as 
participant’s underlying condition, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy; or the delay between administration and the onset of the AE is incompatible with a causal 
relationship. Therefore, there is not a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the study medication.  
• Possibly Related :  The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of 
study medication administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study medication, but could have been produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to the subject.  
• Related :  The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of study 
medication administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study

    medication and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as subject’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to the subject, and either occurs immediately following study medication administration, or improves on stopping the study medication, or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a positive reaction at the application site.  
6.9.6 Expectedness  
The most frequently reported AE for netarsudil ophthalmic solution  in two Phase 2 and three  
Phase 3 studies ( Clinical Study Reports  AR-13324-CS201, AR -13324-CS202, 
AR-13324-CS301, AR -13324-CS302, and AR -13324-CS304) has been conjunctival 
hyperemia.  Other AEs seen in greater frequency with netarsudil than in active control 
treatment arms in these studies include instillation site erythema or pain, eyelid erythema, conjunctival hemorrhage, conjunctival vascular disorder, blurred vision, corneal deposits, eye irritation, increased lacrimation, and foreign body sensation. 
An AE or SAR  is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or 
is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  “Unexpected,” as used in 
this definition, also refers to AEs  or SARs  that are mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure 
as occurring with this class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of netarsudil, and are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the IP.  The AEs that are both unexpected and serious should be reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor (see Section  6.9.8 for further details).  
6.9.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
Clinical laboratory values (other than pregnancy test results) that are noted as abnormal and clinically significant at study exit and that are changes from Visit 1 (Screening) values will be documented as AEs. 
6.9.8 Serious Adverse Events or Serious Suspected Adverse Events  
An Investigator must immediately report any SAE or SSAR (see Section  6.9.2 for 
definitions) to the Sponsor or Sponsor representative (contact information below) , whether or 
not the SAE or SSAR is considered drug-related, including those listed in the protocol or 
Investigator’s Brochure.  The Investigator report must include an assessment of whether 
there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.  The Investigator must report any SAE or SSAR that occurs during the study for a subject or any SAE or SSAR that occurs within 4  weeks (i.e. , 30 days) after the last administration of study medication . Study 
endpoints that are SAEs  (e.g., all-cause mortality)  must be reported in accordance with 
Section 6.9.2 of the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship 
between the drug and the event ( e.g., death from anaphylaxis).  In that case, the Investigator 
must immediately report the event to the Sponsor or Sponsor representative.  In case of 
incomplete information, the Investigator must provide follow-up information as soon as possible, again using the SAE report form.

    Responsibilities Log. Investigators are encouraged to contact the Sponsor/Sponsor 
representative for any questions regarding allowed medications.  Judgment of continued study participation by the subject, and inclusion of this subject’s subsequent visits in the 
safety and efficacy analysis will be made by the Sponsor.  
6.11 Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)  
Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) will be taken at visits as a measure of ocular function and will be measured at screening and frequently throughout the study. Visual acuity will be measured using ETDRS charts or their equivalents.  Accepted charts are those designed according to the principles described by Ferris and coworkers ( Ferris 1982 ) and supported by 
the guidelines from the Eye Care Technology Forum ( Ferris 1996).  
See Appendix 2 for details of the procedures to be followed when determining BCVA. 
6.12 Biomicroscopy  
Biomicroscopic examination of the eyelids, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, lens, iris, and pupil of both lenses will be carried out at every study visit for both eyes of subjects.  Normal or abnormal status of these ocular tissues will be graded as described in Appendix 2. 
6.13 Gonioscopy/ Pachymetry  
Gonioscopy will be used to confirm the iridocorneal angle is open and to what extent.  Eligible subjects must have an angle of 3 or 4 (Shaffer grading scale; Stamper 2009) for 
participation in the study.  Gonioscopy may be performed up to 3 months prior to 
randomization. Pachymetry  will be used to measure the thickness of the central cornea.  Both 
of these assessments will be done in order to determine the eligibility of a subject to be enrolled in this study.  Further information on these procedures is found in Appendix 2. 
6.14 Visual Field Testing  
Visual field testing must be p erformed in both eyes . Visual field testing may be performed up 
to 3 months prior to randomization. Visual fields must be determined as automated threshold 
perimetry (e.g., 30-2 or 24-2 Humphrey). SITA Standard is preferred, SITA fast is also 
allowed.  Visual fields must be reliable, defined as those with a) fixation losses less than or equal to 33%, b) false positives less than or equal to 33%, and c) false negatives less than or equal to 33%.  Visual fields fixation losses should not be rounded up to the next whole 
number value. The gaze track and blind spot should be turned on for all visual fields assessments in order to calculate the fixatio n losses.  See Appendix 2 for further 
information.  
6.15 Dilated Ophthalmoscopy  
A dilated funduscopic examination including evaluation of the retina, vitreous, macula, 
choroid, optic nerve, and vertical cup/disc ratio will be performed.  Se e Appendix 2 for

    furth er information on scoring.  Evaluation of vertical cup -disc ratio will be performed when 
ophthalmoscopy is performed. 
6.16 Intraocular Pressure  
Local anesthetic will also be applied in order to facilitate IOP measurements with the 
Goldmann Applanation Tonometer.  Tonometer calibration on at least a monthly basis must be documented. 
Two consecutive IOP measurements of each eye must be obtained. If the 2 measurements 
differ by more than 2 mmHg, a third measurement must be obtained. Intraocular pressure will be analyzed as the mean of 2 measurements or as the median of 3 measurements 
(Sherwood 2006). 
Each Goldmann tonometry value is read as an integer. When calculating the mean or median, it is possi ble to have a fractional value; any non- integral mean or m edian IOP number will be 
reported to one decimal place. Note:  For purposes of determining eligibility of subjects to be enrolled, any non-integral mean IOP number should not be rounded. 
IOP should be measured by qualified individuals using a calibrated Goldmann applanation 
tonometer. 
6.17 Study Eye Selection Process  
Subjects must qualify in both eyes based upon IOP and ocular history for a subject who 
qualifies; the study eye will be the eye with the higher IOP at 08:00 hours on Visit 3. If both eyes have the same IOP at 08:00 hours on Visit 3, then the right eye will be the study eye. For each subject, BOTH eyes will be treated . 
6.18 Removal of Subjects from the Study or Study Treatment  
6.18.1 Completed Subject  
A completed subject is defined as one who completes all 28 days of planned dosing and completion of the post- treatment f ollow-up day visit procedures. 
6.18.2 Non-completing Subject  
A non-completing subject is defined as one who exits the study by their own volition or at the discretion of the Investigator, the Medical Monitor, and/or the Sponsor Safety Officer.  Any subject may de cide to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time without 
prejudice.  In the event that discontinuation of treatment is necessary, the Investigator will make every attempt to complete all subsequent safety assessments listed for Visit 6 .0 
(Day  29) as  well as dilated ophthalmoscopy. 
The subject may also be discontinued from the study for the following reasons:

    • Lack of Efficacy  (as demonstrated by IOP measurements and Investigator decision that 
there is a risk of additional glaucomatous damage if the subject continues in the study). 
• Adverse Events  (AEs including, in the opinion of the Investigator, clinically relevant 
laboratory abnormalities and intercurrent diseases reported by the subject or observed by 
the investigator with documentation in the CRF).  
• Withdrawal of Consent  
• Non-compliance (e.g., non-adherence to scheduled follow-up visits or non- compliance 
with dosing)  
• Lost to Follow- up    
• Disallowed Concurrent Medication   
• Investigator Decision   
• Protocol Deviation   
• Death  
• Other 
6.18.3 Actions after Discontinua tion 
All subjects who discontinue study medication due to a report of an AE must be followed and provided appropriate medical care until their signs and symptoms have remitted or stabilized or until clinically meaningful abnormal laboratory findings have r eturned to acceptable or 
pre-study limits.  
For subjects who choose to withdraw consent or who are discontinued for non- complian ce 
prior to completing the study, every possible effort should be made by the Investigator to assure there is a final visit that  includes all examinations listed for Visit 6.0 (Exit) and dilated 
ophthalmoscopy. 
6.18.4 Discontinuation of the Entire Study  
The entire study may be discontinued at a given site (by the Investigator or the Sponsor/ 
Sponsor representative or at all sites by the Sponsor). Prompt, written notice of reasonable cause to all other relevant parties (Sponsor or Investigator) is required.  Prompt notice to the IRB and to regulatory authorities is also required.

    7. STUDY ACTIVITIES  
The schedule of study visits and procedures is shown in Appendix 1.  
7.1 Visit 1 ( Screening ) 
This visit may occur at any time of the day.  The Investigator  or a member of his/her staff will 
interview the individual as to their qualifications for participation in the study.  
Individuals will be asked to review the informed consent, discuss issues as needed, and to 
sign the form.  A signed written informed consent must be obtained from the subject prior to any study specific procedu res or assessments. The ICF process will be clearly documented in 
the subject’s source. 
Significant medical and ophthalmic history including concomitant  medication use will be 
taken, and demographic measures recorded (see Section  6.2).  
The following procedures will be performed (see Appendix 2 for procedure details) :   
• Heart rate and blood pressure 
• Pregnancy test:  All fema les of childbearing potential must have a negative urine 
pregnancy test result  
• Best Corrected Visual Acuity   
• Central corneal thickness will be measured by ultrasound pachymetry (taken at screening 
or within 1 week prior to the Screening Visit) 
• Intraocular pressure (before pupil dilation):  Medicated IOP must be ≥ 15 mmHg and < 30 mmHg in both eyes at the Screening Visit (this also applies to treatment naïve 
subjects)  
• Biomicroscopy 
• Dilated ophthalmoscopy (including vertical cup-disc ratio)  
• Visual fields and  gonioscopy may be taken up to 3 months prior to randomization in both 
eyes 
• Symptomatology: Individuals will be asked “How are you feeling?” 
Blood samples will be taken for clinical chemistry  and hematology , and a urine sample will 
be taken for urinalysis (Appendix 2). The results of blood work and urinalysis should be 
reviewed after this study visit in order to determine eligibility of the subject prior to undertaking the examination at Visit 2 (Qualification Visit #1).

    For subjects who are unable or unwilling to have blood drawn and urine collected for clinical 
labs at Visit 1 (Screening), the blood and urine sample may be drawn at Visit 2 (Qualification 
Visit #1) so long as the results of the clinical labs are available  and reviewed for eligibility 
for that subject prior to Visit 3 (Qualification Visit #2). 
The Investigator will evaluate the results of these examinations for possible enrollment of the 
individual into the study. 
7.1.1 Evaluation of Eye-Drop Instillation Perform ance  
Subjects (or legally authorized representative for subjects deemed unable to administer) will 
be provided a bottle of commercially available, multi-dose, non- medicated artificial tears in a 
room with access to water and soap. Medication instiller will be asked to instill a drop of the artificial tear in each eye under the observation of a member of the Investigator’s staff.  The 
staff will observe the subject, guardian , or alternative person to assure that they instill 1 drop 
of the artificial tear into each eye, without touching the tip of the bottle to their eye or face (Stone 2009) .  The staff member may work with the individual to improve their delivery 
technique to meet this standard. If the subject (guardian or alternative person) cannot demonstra te proper delivery of the eye drop, or if staff member feels that the individual will 
be unable to do so consistently, then the subject will be excluded from further study participation.  
7.1.2 Washout 
As noted in Section 5.7.1, a washout period is required for individuals currently using ocular hypotensive medications and who meet  the other qualifications for enrollment.   
7.2 Visit 2 (Qualification Visit #1, for 08:00 hours IOP and safety measurements) 
After the washout (if needed), individuals will return to the Investigator’s office in the early morning. The subject will be questioned regarding any changes in their health or concomitant medication use.  Any change in the individual’s Visit 1 health status should be recorded on the Medical History page of the CRF (e.g., the subject has been diagnosed with cancer). 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed again for the qualified individual. Results of the 
clinical laboratory tests from Visit 1 need to be available and reviewed by the Investigator.  
For subjects who were unable or unwilling to have blood drawn and urine collected  for the 
clinical labs at Visit 1, the blood and urine sample may be drawn at Visit 2 (Qualification 
Visit #1) so long as the results of the clinical labs are available for that subject prior to Visit 3 
(Qualification Visit #2).  
The following procedures will be performed: 
• Heart rate and blood pressure

7.3 Treatment Period  
7.3.1 Visit 3.0 (Qualification Visit #2, Day 1, for IOP and safety measurements at 
08:00 hours )  
Within 2 to 7 da ys after Visit 2, individuals will return to the Investigator’s office for the next 
08:00 hour IOP measurement.  
The results of the clinical laboratory tests from Visit 1 need to be available, and reviewed by 
the Investigator. In order for the individual to be enrolled, the tests CANNOT be indicative of any clinically significant disease in the opinion of the Investigator.  
The subject will be questioned regarding any changes in their health or concomitant 
medication use.  Any change in the individual’s health status should be recorded on the Medical History page of the CRF (e.g., the subject has been diagnosed with cancer).  
Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed again for the qualified individual. The following procedures will be performed:  
• Heart rate and blood pressure 
• Symptomatology: Individuals will be asked  “How  are you feeling?”

    9. PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 General Considerations  
All continuous study assessments will be summarized by treatment and time point 
(as applicable) using descr iptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, 
and maximum).  All categorical study assessments will be summarized by treatment and time point (as applicable) using frequency counts and percentages.   
Hypothesis testing, unless otherwise indicated, will be performed at a 2 -sided 
0.05 significance level.  When applicable, two -sided 95% confidence intervals will be 
reported.  All p- values will be displayed to four decimal places, with p -values less than 
0.0001 presented as '<0.0001' and p-values greater than 0.9999 presented as ‘>0.9999’.  
Differences between netarsudil (0.02% or 0.04%) and placebo will be calculated as 
netarsudil  – placebo .   
All study data will be listed by treatment, subject, and time point (as applicable).   
For diurnally- adjusted IOP, baseline will refer to the time -relevant measure at Visit 3.0 
through 3.2 (e.g., IOP at 08:00 hours at Visit 3.0 will be the baseline for 08:00 hours at 
Visit 4.0, Visit 5.0, and Visit 6.0; IOP at 10:00 hours at Visit 3.1 will be the baseline for 10:00 hours at Visit 4.1, Visit 5.1, and Visit 6.1; etc.).  For all other variables, baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to the first dose of study medication. An additional definition of baseline for conjunctival hyperemia will also be  used: baseline (pre-washout) 
will be defined as the conjunctival hyperemia measure at Visit 1.  
The unit of analysis for efficacy will be the study eye.  For a subject who qualifies, the study eye will be the eye with the higher IOP at 08:00 hours on Visit 3.  If both eyes have the same IOP at 08:00 hours on Visit 3, then the right eye will be the study eye. 
Data collected during the observation extension visits may be summarized separately from 
the data collected during the main portion of the study. 
Statistical methods will be more fully described in separate document(s) (i.e., the Statistical 
Analysis Plan).  
9.2 Determination of Sample Size  
Assuming a 2-sided test with alpha = 0.05 and a common standard deviation ( SD) of 
3.5 mmHg at each time point yielding a  common SD of 3.0 for the diurnal mean assuming a 
correlation among time points of 0.60, 49 ITT subjects per arm yields at least 90% power to demonstrate superiority of netarsudil (0.02% or 0.04%) to placebo  in mean diurnal study eye 
IOP (average of 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 hours) at the Week 4 visit assuming a difference of at least  2.0 mmHg in the mean diurnal IOP. The study will be considered a success and 
superiority of netarsudil to  placebo  will be concluded if the two -sided p-value ≤ 0.05 at

    Week  4.  With 60 ITT subjects per arm, each test has 95% power to demonstrate superiority 
of netarsudil  (0.02% or 0.04%) to placebo . 
9.3 Analysis Populations 
9.3.1 Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT population will include all randomized subjects who have received at least 1 dose of 
study medication.  This population will be the primary population for efficacy analyses and will be used to summarize all efficacy variables and will summarize sub jects as randomized.  
9.3.2 Per Protocol (PP) Population  
The per protocol ( PP) population is a subset of the ITT population, which will include those 
subjects who do not have major protocol violations likely to seriously affect the primary outcome of the study as judged by a masked evaluation prior to the unmasking of the study treatment.  This population will be the secondary population for efficacy analyses and will be used to summarize a subset of efficacy variables.  If the PP and ITT populations are exactly the same, then additional efficacy analyses on the PP population will not be performed.  The PP population will summarize subjects as treated.  
9.3.3 Safety Population 
The safety population will include all randomized subjects who have received at least 1 dose of study medication.  This population will be used to summarize safety variables and will 
summarize subjects as treated.  
9.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics such as age, gender, or disease status will be summariz ed and listed.  Medical history, history of ocular surgery and procedures, glaucoma 
history and washout period (if needed) will also be summarized and listed. 
9.5 Primary Efficacy  
9.5.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint (s) 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the compariso n of netarsudil ophthalmic 
solution (0.02% or 0.04%) relative to its placebo  for mean diurnal IOP within a treatment 
group at Week 4 (Day29) by Goldmann Applanation Tonometry. 9.5.2 Primary Efficacy  Analyses  
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will employ a linear model with mean diurnal 
IOP at Week 4 as the response, baseline mean diurnal IOP as a covariate, and treatment as a main effect factor, using the ITT population with Monte Carlo Markov Chain multiple 
imputation techniques used to impute missing data.  The least squares mean differences

Confidential  Page 55 of 85  
    Additionally, secondary analyses of the primary endpoint will be completed using individual 
2-sample t -tests and 95% t-distribution CIs for each comparison netarsudil (0.02% or 0.04%) 
versus placebo using the ITT population. 
The primary and secondary analyses will also be completed on the secondary endpoints: 
mean diurnal IOP at Weeks 1 and 2, mea n IOP measure at each post -treatment time point and 
visit (08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 at the Week 1, Week 2, and Week 4 Visits), mean change from baseline in mean diurnal IOP at each post -treatment visit, and mean change from diurnally 
adjusted baseline IOP at each post -treatment time point and visit.  Models adjusting for 
baseline will only be performed on the mean IOP response variable as inference is identical between this response and the change from baseline IOP response variable in such a model. 
Additionally, for the mean IOP values at each time point, mixed model repeated measures 
will be run with baseline as the covariate; treatment, visit, time point, treatment by visit, treatment by time point, visit by time point, and treatment by visit by time point as the fixed effect factors; and subject as the random effect, repeated measure.  An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within subject, between visit and time point variances.  This allows for different variances and co -variances within and between time 
points and visits.  The treatment by visit, treatment by time point, visit by time point, and treatment by visit by time point interactions allow for a different rate of change in IOP in the different treatment arms among visits and  time points.  This model will be run including the 
Week 1, Week 2, and Week 4 visits.   
Mean percent change from baseline in mean diurnal IOP and mean percent change from 
diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each time point will be analyzed using two- sample  t-tests, 
between netarsudil (0.02% or 0.04%) and placebo, at each time point and visit, including 
two-sample t -tests and 95% t-distribution confidence intervals on the difference 
(netarsudil  - placebo).   
Mean diurnal IOP values will be constructed by ave raging the 3 diurnal IOP measurements 
on each of Week 1, Week 2, and Week 4 visits.  Mean diurnal baseline IOP will be constructed as the average of the three Day 1 IOP measurements.  Mean change from mean baseline diurnal IOP will be created by taking the  average of the 3 time points on each of 
Week 1, Week 2, and Week 4 visits and subtracting the single mean baseline diurnal IOP measurement.  
Sub-group analyses based upon pre- study characteristics such as site, demographics, or 
pre-study ocular hypotensive medications may be completed to further investigate the 
efficacy measures.   
Analyses of IOP will also include summarizing the number and percentage of study eyes achieving mean diurnal IOP reduction from baseline of ≥ 4 to_≥ 12 mmHg in 2 mmHg increments and percent reduction from baseline of ≥ 5% to ≥ 40% in 5% increments at 
Week  1, Week 2, and Week 4.  Additionally, the number and percentage of study eyes 
attaining a mean diurnal IOP of ≤ 22 to ≤ 14 mmHg in 1 mmHg increments will be summarized at Week 1,  Week 2, and Week 4.  Fisher’s exact test (2 -sided p- values) will be

    used to test differences between netarsudil (0.02% or 0.04%) versus placebo for each 
category at each visit.  These analyses will be presented for both the ITT and PP populations 
with observed data only. 
9.7 Safety  
9.7.1 Safety Endpoints  
• Ocular symptoms/adverse events  
• Best corrected visual acuity  
• Objective findings of biomicroscopic examinations (i.e., anterior segment examinations 
including evaluation of cornea, conjunctiva, lids, and lens) 
• Dilate d ophthalmoscopy, including vertical cup-disc ratio measurements  
Other safety assessments will be:  
• Systemic safety assessments as measured by heart rate, blood pressure, and clinical laboratory evaluations (including hematology, clinical chemistry , and uri nalysis )  
• Pregnancy testing (for women of ch ild bearing potential)  
9.7.2 Safety Analyses 
Verbatim descriptions of AEs will be mapped to MedDRA thesaurus terms and be presented 
in a data listing.  Treatment emergent AEs, those that occur after the first dose of s tudy 
medication, will be summarized by treatment group using frequency and percent for each system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) within each SOC.  Summaries will be presented separately for ocular and non -ocular AEs.  These summaries will also be presented 
for relation to Investigational Product and by severity.  Fisher’s exact test will be used to test the difference in proportions of subjects with each AE between treatment groups netarsudil (0.02% or 0.04%) vs placebo .   
Visual acuity data wil l be summarized at each time point using both continuous summaries 
(logMAR), including change from baseline, and discrete summaries, including change from baseline on an ETDRS chart (or equivalent) in the number of lines and the proportion of subjects with  a worsening of ≥ 3 lines from baseline.   
Slit lamp biomicroscopy and dilated ophthalmoscopy measures will be summarized at each measured time point using discrete summary statistics.  Conjunctival hyperemia will also be 
summarized using continuous summary statistics including change from baseline and change from baseline (pre-washout).

    10.4 Subject Information and Consent  
Informed consent must take place before any study specific procedures are initiated. Signed 
and dated written informed consent must be obtained from each subject and/or from the subject’s parent or legal guardian prior to enrollment into the study. 
All ICFs  must be approved for use by the Sponsor and receive approval/favorable opinion 
from an IRB prior to their use. If the consent form requires revision (e.g., due to a protocol 
amendment or significant new safety information), it is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the amended informed consent is reviewed and approved by the Sponsor prior to submission to the governing IRB and that it is read, signed and dated by all subjects subsequently enrolled in the study as well as those currently enrolled in the study if directed by the IRB.  
10.5 Subject Confidentiality  
The Investigator and his/her staff will maintain all personal subject data collected and proces sed for the purposes of this study using adequate precautions to ensure confidentiality, 
in accordance with local, state and federal laws and regulations.  
Monitors, auditors and other authorized representatives of Aerie, the IRB (s) approving this 
study, and government regulatory authorities ( e.g., FDA and other foreign regulatory 
agencies) may be granted direct access to the study subject’s original medical and study records for verification of the data or clinical study procedures. Access to this information will be permitted to representatives of the aforementioned organizations to the extent permitted by law.  
A report of this study’s results may be published or sent to the appropriate health authorities in any country in which the study drug may ultimat ely be marketed, but subject identities will 
not be disclosed in these documents. 
10.6 Study Monitoring  
Clinical research associates hired or contracted by the Sponsor will be responsible for  
monitoring the study sites and study activities. They will contact an d visit the Investigator 
regularly. The actual frequency of monitoring visits depends on subject enrollment and on 
study site performance. Among others, the following items will be reviewed: 
• study progress 
• compliance with the protocol 
• completion of CRF s 
• dispensing, storage, and accountability of IP, including unmasking of IP 
• source data verification  
• AE and SAE reporting 
• essential documents contained within the regulatory binder

Confidential  Page 60 of 85  
    For source data verification (i.e., comparison of CRF  entries with subject records), data will 
be 100% source verified. 
10.7 Case Report Forms and Study Records  
Study data will be recorded via electronic CRFs . Each authorized study staff member will 
receive a unique access account in order to use the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. 
Access accounts will not be shared among study staff. Authorized users will make entries 
and/or changes to the CRF  via a secure internet access. Each completed set of  CRF s will be 
reviewed by the Investigator who will then electronically sign and date the  CRF  confirming 
that data for the subjects are complete and accurate.  
Source document information should be legible. Recorded data should only be corrected by drawing a single line through the incorrect entry and writing the revision next to the corrected data. The person who has made the correction should place his or her initials as well as the date of the correction next to the correction. Data may not be obliterated  by 
erasure, redaction, or with correction fluid. 
The study records must include a copy of each Investigator's CV and medical license; 
completed FDA Form 1572 or statement of Investigator; each CRF ; subject charts/source  
documents; Investigator's Brochure; protocol and protocol amendments; correspondence with  
the Sponsor and the IRB; IP storage, receipts, returns and dispensing records; Delegation of Responsibilities Log ; site training records ; records of site monitoring; unmasking 
documentation; AE and SAE reporting; IRB/IEC approvals ; advertisements ; written 
information provided to subjects; and subject completed ICFs. If the Investigator moves, withdraws from an investigation, or retires, the responsibility for maintaining the records may be transferred to another person (e.g., Sponsor, other Investigator) who will accept the responsibility. Notice of this transfer, including written acceptance, must be made to and agreed upon by the Sponsor. 
10.8 Protocol Deviations 
A protocol deviation occurs when there is non- adherence to study procedures or schedules. 
Examples of deviations include common out of window visits or timed procedures, a missed 
procedure, etc. Sites will record protocol deviations in the study records. To the extent 
possible, sites will make their best efforts to quickly remedy deviations.  
The site will contact the Sponsor for clarification of inclusion/exclusion criteria as needed 
prior to enrollment of a study subject. The Sponsor will document clarification requests and responses. No waivers to inclusion or exclusion criteria are allowed . If a potentia l subject 
does not meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria during screening, that subject may not be enrolled in the study. 
The site will notify the Sponsor or their representative and IRB within 10 days , or sooner, if 
required by the IRB, of becoming aw are of any significant protocol deviation. Typically, 
significant protocol deviation s include significant deviations from the inclusion and

    exclusion criteria that may impact interpretation or the quality of efficacy information or the 
safety of a subject,  concomitant medication restrictions, or any other protocol requirement 
that results in a significant added risk to the subject or has an impact on the quality of the data collected or the outcome of the study. 
The Sponsor will review, designate, and/or approve all protocol deviations prior to database 
lock. 
10.9 Access to Source Documentation  
Monitors, auditors, and other authorized representatives of the Sponsor, the governing 
IRB(s), the FDA, the DHHS, other domestic government agencies, and other foreign regulatory agencies will be granted direct access to the study subject’s original medical and 
study records for verification of the data and/or clinical study procedures. Access to this information will be permitted to representatives of the aforementioned organizations to the extent permitted by law.  
10.10 Data Generation and Analysis 
After data have been entered into the study EDC system database, a system of computerized data validation checks will be implemented and applied to the database.  Query reports pertai ning to data omissions and discrepancies will be forwarded to the clinical Investigator 
and the Sponsor for resolution.  Where required, the Investigator will be asked for supplementary information through a query.  The study EDC system database will be updated by the clinical investigator or their staff, in accordance with the resolved query reports.  All changes to the study database will be documented.   
Once the CRFs are monitored in the EDC system, the data management contract research 
organization ( CRO) and the Sponsor will further check the CRFs for completeness and 
plausibility of the data. The data management CRO will use quality systems in order to verify accurate and complete data entry, including additional checks of the data once entered in a database (e.g., range checks, cross checks and other edit checks).  
All procedures for the handling and analysis of data will be conducted using good computing practices meeting ICH and US FDA guidelines for the handling and analysis of data for clinical trials.  Data will be checked per the data management CRO’s SOPs. The database then will be locked and a biostatistician will complete the analyses of the data in accordance with the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
10.11 Retention of Data  
The Investigator shall retain s tudy records for a period of 2 years following the date a 
marketing application is approved for the drug for the indication for which it is being investigated, or for a period of 2 years after all investigations with the drug are discontinued and FDA has b een duly notified in the circumstance that no application is to be filed or the

    application is not approved for such indication. The Sponsor will inform the Investigator 
when the study records can be destroyed. 
10.12 Financial Disclosure  
The Principal Investigat or and sub-Investigators (as listed on Form FDA 1572) will provide 
financial disclosure information prior to participation in the study. The Principal Investigator 
and any sub-Investigators will notify the Sponsor promptly of any required revision to their 
financial disclosure status during the term of this study, annually, or at the end of the study (if applicable). The Principal Investigator and sub-Investigators will provide updated financial disclosure information upon the Sponsor’s written request following completion of the study. 
10.13 Publication and Disclosure Policy  
Aerie Pharmaceuticals, as the Sponsor, has proprietary interest in the study. Authorship and 
manuscript composition will reflect joint cooperation between multiple investigators and sites and Aerie Pharmaceuticals personnel, and will be administrated by a steering committee.  As this study involves multiple centers, no individual publications will be allowed prior to completion of the final report of the multicenter study except as agreed with Aerie Pharmaceuticals .

    Appendix  2 Procedures  
Procedures: Best Corrected Visual Acuity  
Best corrected visual acuity  (BCVA) is taken at all visits as a measure of ocular function.  
BCVA will be measured at screening and frequently throughout the study. 
Procedure : Distance visual acuity must be assessed using an Early Treatment of Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) or equivalent chart. Visual acuity testing should precede 
intraocular pressure measurement, the administration of topical anesthetic agents, or any examination requiring contact with the anterior segment.  
Distance visual acuity will be measured with best correction. 
The visual acuity chart may be either retro -illuminated (“back -lit”), or reflectance 
illuminated. If the latter  is chosen , then the illumination must be checked at regular intervals 
to be consistent with ETDRS guidelines. Standard charts for a distance from subject to chart 
of 10 feet to 20 feet  must be used. Ideally, the subject should be seated. The right eye should 
be tes ted first.  Sites are directed to refer to the instructions on the commercial ETDRS 
charts. If there is any question, contact the Sponsor’s monitor. 
The subject should attempt to read each letter, line by line, left to right, beginning with line 1 
at the t op of the chart (20/200 line).  The subjects should be told that the chart has letters 
only, no numbers.  If the subject reads a number, he or she should be reminded that the chart contains no numbers, and the examiner should then request a letter in lieu of the number. The subjects should be asked to read slowly, about 1 letter per second, so as to achieve the best identification of each letter.  He/she is not to proceed to the next letter until he/she has given a definite response.  
A maximum effort should  be made to identify each letter on the chart. When the subject says 
he/she cannot read a letter, he/she should be encouraged to guess.  If the subject identified 2 letters (e.g. , A or B), he/she should be asked to choose 1 letter and, if necessary, to guess. 
When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be made despite encouragement to read or guess, the examiner should stop the testing for that eye.  However, all letters on the last line should be attempted as letter difficulties vary and the last letter may be the only one read correctly. The number of letters missed or read incorrectly should be noted.  Repeat with left eye. 
In order to provide standardized and well-controlled assessment of visual acuity during the 
study, all visual acuity assessments for a subject must be performed consistently (e.g., the same lighting conditions, viewing distance, etc.) during the entire study.  
The number of letters missed is multiplied by 0.02 and added to the baseline value to determine the logMAR visual acuity. Baseline is defined as the last line for which the subject reads at least 1 letter.

    External examinati on and biomicroscopy will be performed using a slit lamp. Magnification 
will be consistent with standard clinical practice.  
The clinician will examine and grade the eyelid s of both eyes for evidence of erythema 
and/or edema. Observations will be documented on the appropriate CRF.  The clinician will 
examine the conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, pupil, and lens of the eye with the aid of a slit lamp, which is a table -mounted binocular microscope, and report their gradings 
for these tissues .  Fluor escein dye will be instilled into the ocular cul- de-sac to facilitate this 
examination. The Sponsor recommends that the same examiner should conduct all biomicroscopy examinations at each time point and at each visit for a given subject.  
Biomicroscopic gra ding will be done as follows: 
LID

    Procedures: Dilated Ophthalmoscopy  
The Sponsor recommends that the same masked examiner should conduct all 
ophthalmoscopy exams for a given subject. 
RETINA, VITREOUS, MACULA, CHOROID, OPTIC NERVE  
0= Normal  
1= Abnormal  
CUP -DISC RATIO (Vertical)  
Score from 0.1 to 1.0 in 0.1 increments  
A priori, a change of 0.2 units in either eye is considered clinically significant.  
Procedures: Pachymetry - Central Corneal Thickness  
Central corneal thickness will be measured by ultrasound pachymetry in both eyes (mean of 2 readings per eye).  The mean value will be used for enrollment criteria.  
For individuals with mean central corneal thickness greater than 620  μm, they may return 
either the same day, or within 7 days for another pachymetry measurement. If the mean of 
2 readings on that second pachymetry is ≤ 620 μm, then the individual may be considered for the study. 
Procedures: Gonioscopy  
The purpose of this examination is to confirm that the iridocorneal angle is open, and that the 
subject does not have narrow angle glaucoma, which is an exclusion criteria for study participation.  Gonioscopy may be perform ed up to 3 months prior to randomization. 
Gonioscopy will be performed at the slit lamp, bilaterally, using a goniolens  and grading will 
be by the Shaffer grading scale (Stamper 2009).  
Procedures: Symptomatology  
Subjects will be queried “How are you feeling?” and any treatment emergent adverse events will be documented on the adverse event form. 
Procedures: Heart Rate  
Heart rate will be measured after the subject has been seated quietly for at least 5 minutes. 
Pulse will be detected at the wrist, and will b e counted for 30 seconds, and multiplied by 2. If 
an electronic measurement device is used, it must be documented.

    Procedures: Blood Pressure 
Blood pressure will be measured after heart rate (and thus the subject will already be in a 
resting s tate).  Blood pressure will be measured using a sphygmomanometer with appropriate 
size cuff and a stethoscope or with a measurement device. 
Procedures: Urine Pregnancy Test  
A urine hCG pregnancy test (only for females who are not diagnosed as postmenopausal or 
surgically sterile) will be used in this study and performed at the screening visit to immediately confirm non -pregnancy eligibility for females of child -bearing potential.   
The Sponsor will provide urine pregnancy tests to the sites.  Expiration dates on the pregnancy tests will be reviewed and confirmed by the site prior to use. 
If a female becomes pregnant during the study, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor 
immediately after the pregnancy is confirmed and the subject will be e xited from the study.  
The Investigator should follow the progress of the pregnancy until the fetus is carried to term. 
Procedures: Clinical Laboratories  
Central laboratories should be used for clinical chemistries as mandated by the protocol. A 
copy of th e certification for the reference laboratory conducting any clinical laboratory tests 
required by this protocol will be provided. Laboratory requisition forms must be completed and samples must be clearly labelled with the subject number, protocol number, site/center number and visit date. Details for the preparation and shipment of samples and reference ranges will be provided in the laboratory manual. 
A chemistry panel , complete blood count (hematology and differential), and urinalysis will 
be performed as shown below.  Note that fasting is NOT required and specific values may be 
out of the typical fasting range.

    Appendix  5 Declaration of Helsinki  
Recommendations Guiding Medical Doctors in Biomedical Research Involving Human 
Subjects  
I. BASIC PRINCIPLES  
1. Biomedical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted  
scientific principles and  should be based on adequately performed laboratory and animal 
experimentation and on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature. 
2. The design and performance of each experimental procedure involving human subjects should be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol which should be transmitted to 
a specially  appointed independent committee for consideration, comment and guidance. 
3. Biomedical research involving human subjects should be conducted onl y by scientifically 
qualified persons and under the supervision of a clinically competent medical person.  The responsibility for the human subject must always rest with a medically qualified person and never rest with the subject of the research, even though the subject has given his or her consent. 
4. Biomedical research involving human subjects cannot legitimately be carried out unless the importance of the objective is in proportion to the inherent risk to the subject. 
5. Every biomedical research project inv olving human subjects should be preceded by 
careful assessment of predictable risks in comparison with foreseeable benefits to the subject or to others. Concern for the interests of the subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society.  
6. The right of the research subject to safeguard his or her integrity must always be respected. Every precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of the subject and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and  on the 
personality of the subject. 
7. Doctors should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subjects unless they are satisfied that the hazards involved are believed to be predictable. Doctors should cease any investigation if the hazards are found to outweigh the potential benefits. 
8. In publication of the results of his or her research, the doctor is obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results. Reports of experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication. 
9. In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study and the discomfort it may entail. He or she should be informed that he or she is at liberty to abstain from participation in the study and that he or she is free to withdraw his or her

Confidential  Page 81 of 85  
    consent to participation at any time. The doctor should then obtain the subject's given 
informed consent, preferably in wr iting.  
10. When obtaining informed consent for the research project the doctor should be particularly cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship to him or her or may consent under duress. In that case, the informed consent should be obtained by a doctor who is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this official relationship. 
11. In case of legal incompetence, informed consent should be obtained from the legal guardian in accordance with national legislation. Where physica l or mental incapacity 
makes it impossible to obtain informed consent, or when the subject is a minor, permission from the responsible relative replaces that of the subject in accordance with national legislation.  
12. The research protocol should always contai n a statement of the ethical considerations 
involved and should indicate that the principles enunciated in the present Declaration  are 
complied  with.  
II. MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH PROFESSIONAL CARE (CLINICAL  
RESEARCH)  
1. In the treatment of the sick person, the doctor must be free to use a new diagnostic and 
therapeutic measure, if in his or her judgment it offers hope of saving life, reestablishing health or alleviating suffering.  
2. The potential benefits, hazards and discomforts of a new method should be weighed  
against the advantages of the best current diagnostic and therapeutic methods.  
3. In any medical study, all subjects - including those of a control group, if any, should be 
assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic methods. 
4. The refusal  of the patient to participate in a study  must never interfere with the doctor- 
patient relationship.  
5. If the doctor considers it essential not to obtain informed consent, the specific reasons for this proposal should be stated in the experimental protocol for transmission to the independent committee. 
6. The doctor can combine medical research with professional care, the objective being the acquisition  of new medical knowledge, only to the extent that medical research  is 
justified by its potential diagnostic o r therapeutic value for the patient.

    III. NON -THERAPEUTIC BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECT  
(NONCLINICAL BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH)  
1. In the purely scientific  application  of medical  research carried  out on a human  being, it is  
the duty of the doctor to  remain  the protector of the life and health  of that person on 
whom biomedical research  is being carried  out. 
2. The subjects should be volunteers  - either  healthy  person or subjects for  whom  the 
experimental design  is not related  to the patient’s  illness.  
3. The Investigator or the team  should discontinue the  research  if in his/her  or their 
judgment  it may,  if continued, be harmful  to the individual. 
4. In research  on man,  the interest  of science and  society  should never take precedence over  
consideration related  to the well -being of the subject.

    Appendix  6 Study Monitoring  
1. Member(s) of the Sponsor or designee will meet with the Investigator prior to the 
initiation of the study in order to assess the adequacy of the Investigator’s patient population, facilities, and equipment, and to familiarize  the Investigator with the 
protocol. 
2. A member of the Sponsor or designee will meet with the Investigator after several of the subjects  have initiated the study in order to ensure that the subjects ar e being properly  
selected, that adequate supplies for the study have been provided, and that the assignment 
of medication is properly recorded. In addition, the Study Monitor will verify that the Investigator follows the approved protocol and all approved amendments, if any, by reviewing the Instigator’s regulatory documents, source document, Informed Consent 
Forms, and Case Report Forms of study subjects. 
3. A member of the Sponsor or designee will meet with the Investigator when all subjects have completed t he Final Visit of the study, in order to collect the Case Report Forms, 
unused study medications , and unused supplies and materials.  
4. Interim monitoring visits and telephone consultations will be done by the Study Monitor, as necessary, to ensure the proper progression and document of the study.

1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA  
 
This is an open -label  Phase  II study  of Everolimus  (RAD001)  in patients  with progressive  
advanced/metastatic  urothelial  carcinoma  that have progressed  despite  treatment  with prior  
cytotoxic  chemotherapy.  The primary  objective  of the study  is to measure  the 2-month  PFS rate 
of Everolimus  (RAD001)  as determined  by RECIST.  Everolimus  will be administered  at a dose 
of 10 mg orally  once  daily  continuously.  Intra-patient  dose reduction  may be required  depending  
on the type and severity  of the individual  toxicity  encountered.  Re-staging  imaging  studies  will 
be performed  after every  two cycles  of treatment  (one cycle  = 4 weeks)  during the  first five years  
of treatment,  and after every  3-6 cycles  of treatment  thereafter.  Patients  may continue  on study  
as long as they are tolerating  therapy  and are free of disease progression.  
 
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC AIMS  
Primary  
• To measure PFS of  Everolimus  (RAD001) as  determined  by RECIST  
• To determine the safety  and toxicity  of Everolimus  (RAD001) in this patient  population.  
 
Secondary  
• To determine the response  rate of Everolimus  (RAD001)  in patients  with progressive  
urothelial  cancer who  have received  prior  cytotoxic chemotherapy  
• To assess  markers  for activated  mTOR  pathway  (including  phospho -S6 and phsopho -4E 
BP1) in all pre-treatment  specimens  and correlate  with response to treatment  and PFS.  
 
3.1 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
 
3.2 Urothelial  Cancer  
 
In the United  States,  urothelial  carcinoma (UC) of the bladder is the  fourth most common  
malignancy  in men and the ninth most common  in women  with an estimated  67,160 new cases  
(50,040  men and 17,120  women) and  13,750 deaths (9,630  men and 4,120  women) for the year 
2007[1].  Although  UC is a chemosensitive malignancy  with response  proportions of  over 50% 
with conventional  cytotoxic  regimens,  the response  durations  are short  and the median  survival  
of patients  with metastatic disease is approximately  14 months [2].  Second -line trials  with 
cytotoxic agents  have generally yielded  discouraging  response  rates  (see table  below) with  a 
median  progression -free survival  between  2 to 3  months and a median  survival in the  range of 6 
to 9 months[3 -6].  Furthermore,  many  patients  receive  these agents as part of  first-line therapy  
leaving  few available options for patients  with progressive or recurrent  disease.  There is no  
FDA -approved  drug for this setting  and no standard conventional  chemotherapy  agent(s) have  
demonstrated  a survival benefit  in patients  with metastatic urothelial  cancer  that has progressed  
after first line  platinum -based  chemotherapy.   This highlights  the need for  the development  of

3.3 Rationale for Everolimus  in Urothelial  Carcinoma  
 
At Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center  (MSKCC), we performed  an immunohistochemical  
(IHC) study  to assess  whether mTOR  pathway  markers are  expressed  in high -stage  bladder  
urothelial  carcinomas.   The study  was carried  out on a tissue  microarray  of 92 cases  of invasive  
urothelial  carcinoma of the bladder  (≥ pT2) using antibodies  against  phospho -S6 and phospho - 
4E BP1,  both markers  for an activated  mTOR  pathway.  Staining  was graded  as 0 to 3+  (0=0 - 
5%; 1+=6 -25%;  2+=26 -50%;  and 3+=>50% tumor  cells positive) for phsopho -S6 (cytoplasmic)  
and phospho -4E BP1  (cytoplasmic  and/or nuclear).  Presence of at least two evaluable  cores  
from  each tumor  was required for inclusion  in the  final evaluation.   The results of  
immunoreactivity  in tumor  cells demonstrated  that mTOR  pathway  markers are overexpressed  in 
invasive urothelial  carcinoma  of the bladder  with correlation  of expression  seen within  molecules  
of the mTOR  pathway  using  Spearman’s  correlation  coefficient  (rho=0.411)  (see table  below).  
This suggests  that m-TOR  targeted  therapies  may have activity  in patients  with urothelial  
carcinoma.

3.4 Everolimus  
Everolimus  is a novel  oral derivative of rapamycin.  
Everolimus  has been in clinical  development  since  1996  as an immunosuppressant  in solid  organ  
transplantation  and has obtained  marketing  authorization  (Certican®) for prophylaxis  of rejection  
in renal  and cardiac  transplantation  in a number  of countries,  including  the majority  of the

European  Union.  Everolimus  has been in development  for patients  with various  malignancies  
since 2002.  
Everolimus  is being  investigated  as an anticancer  agent  based  on its potential to act: 
• Directly  on the  tumor  cells by inhibiting  tumor  cell growth  and proliferation.  
• Indirectly  by inhibiting  angiogenesis  leading  to reduced  tumor  vascularity  (via potent  
inhibition  of tumor  cell HIF-1 activity,  VEGF  production  and VEGF -induced  proliferation  of 
endothelial  cells).  The role of angiogenesis  in the maintenance  of solid  tumor  growth  is well 
established,  and the mTOR  pathway  has been implicated  in the regulation  of tumor  
production  of proangiogenic  factors  as well as modulation  of VEGFR  signaling  in 
endothelial  cells.  
 
 
3.4.1 mTOR pathway and mechanism  of action  
 
At the cellular  and molecular  level,  Everolimus  acts as a signal  transduction  inhibitor.  
Everolimus  selectively  inhibits  mTOR  (mammalian  target  of rapamycin),  a key and a highly  
conservative  serine -threonine  kinase,  which  is present  in all cells and is a central  regulator  of 
protein  synthesis  and ultimately  cell growth,  cell proliferation,  angiogenesis  and cell survival.  
mTOR  is the  only currently  known  target  of Everolimus (reviewed  in Boulay  and Lane,  2007).  
mTOR  is downstream  of PI3K/AKT  pathway,  a pathway  known  to be dysregulated  in a wide  
spectrum  of human  cancers  (e.g. through  loss/mutation  of the PTEN  negative  regulator;  through  
PI3K  mutation/amplification;  through  AKT/PKB  overexpr ession/overactivation;  through  
modulation  of TSC1/TSC2  tumor  suppressors).  In addition,  activation  of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR  
pathway  is frequently  a characteristic  of worsening  prognosis  through  increased  aggressiveness,  
resistance to treatment  and progression.  
The main  known  functions  of mTOR  include  the following  (Bjornsti  and Houghton   2004;  
Boulay  and Lane,  2007):  
• mTOR  functions  as a sensor  of mitogens,  growth  factors  and energy  and nutrient levels,  
facilitating  cell-cycle progression  from  G1 to S phase in appropriate  growth  conditions.  
• The PI3K -mTOR  pathway  itself is frequently  activated  in many  human  cancers,  and 
oncogenic transformation  may sensitize  tumor  cells to mTOR  inhibitors.  
• Through  inactivating  eukaryot ic initiation  factor 4E binding  proteins  (4E-BP1)  and activating  
the 40S ribosomal  S6 kinases  (i.e., p70S6K1),  mTOR regulates  translation  of important  
massages,  including  those  encoding  the HIF-1 proteins, c-myc,  ornithine decarboxylase,  and 
cyclin  D1, as well as ribosomal  proteins  themselves.  
• The activation  of mTOR  pathway  leads  to the  increased  production of  pro-angiogenic factors  
(i.e., VEGF) in tumors  and to tumor,  endothelial  and smooth muscle cell  growth  and 
proliferation.  
• The regulation  of mTOR  signaling  is complex  and involves  positive  regulators,  such as AKT  
that phosphorylate and  inactivate negative  regulators  such as the Tuberous  Sclerosis  
Complex  (TSC1/TSC2).  
Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center  
IRB Protocol  
IRB#:  08-123 A(8) 
Amended:  03/04/15  5  
  
mTOR  is represented  by two structurally  and functionally  distinct  multiprotein  signaling  
complexes,  mTORC1  (mTOR  complex  1, rapamycin  sensitive)  and mTORC2  (mTOR  complex  
2, rapamycin  insensitive)  (Wullschleger,  Loewith  and Hall 2006).  
mTORC1  is mainly  activated  via the PI3 kinase  pathway  through  AKT  (also  known  as PKB,  
protein  kinase  B) and the tuberous  sclerosis  complex  (TSC1/TSC2)  (Bjornsti  and Houghton  
2004).  Activated  AKT  phosphorylates  TSC2,  which  leads  to the dissociation  of TSC1/TSC2  
complex,  thus inhibiting  the ability  of TSC2  to act as a GTPase  activating  protein.  This allows  
Rheb,  a small  G-protein,  to remain  in a GTP  bound state and  to activate mTORC1. AKT can also 
activate  mTORC1  by PRAS40  phosphorylation,  thereby  relieving  the PRAS40 -mediated  
inhibition of  mTORC1  (Manning  and Cantley  2007; Wang  at al 2007).  
mTORC2  (mTOR  complex  2) is activated  through  a currently  unknown  mechanism,  possibly  by 
receptor tyrosine kinase  (RTK) signaling  (Manning  and Cantley  2007).  It has been  sugge sted that 
mTORC2  phosphorylates  and activates  a different  pool of AKT  that is not upstream  of 
mTORC1.  PHLPP  phosphatase  plays  the role of a negative  regulator.  mTORC2  is rapamycin  
insensitive  and is required  for the organization  of the actin  cytoskeleton  (Wullschleger,  Loewith  
and Hall 2006).  
mTORC1 -mediated  signaling  is subject  to modulation  by the macrocyclic  lactone  rapamycin  and 
its derivatives,  such as Everolimus.  Once  these  agents  bind to the 12 kDa cytosolic  FK506 - 
binding  protein  immunophilin  FKBP12,  the resulting  rapamycin -FKBP12  complexes  bind to a 
specific  site near the catalytic  domain  of mTORC1  and inhibit  phosphorylation  of mTOR  
substrates.  As a consequence,  downstream  signaling  events involved  in regulation  of the G1 to S- 
phase  transition  are inhibited.  This mechanism  is thought  to be responsible  for the 
immunosuppressive  effects  of rapamycin  as well as its putative  antineoplastic  activity (Witzig,  et 
al 2005).  Since  many  cancers  are characterized  by dysregulation  of G1 transit  (for example,  
overexpression  of cyclin  or cyclin -dependent  kinases),  inhibition  of mTOR  becomes  an 
intriguing  target  for inducing cytostasis  (Bjornsti  and Houghton  2004).  
 
 
3.4.2 Preclinical  studies  
 
Pre-clinical  investigations  have  demonstrated  that Everolimus  is a potent  inhibitor  of the 
proliferation  of a range  of human  tumor  cell lines in-vitro with IC50s  ranging  from  sub/low  nM 
to µM concentrations.  These  concentrations  can be reached  in patients  at the doses  used in 
clinical  trials.  
Everolimus  has proven  active  in human  tumor  cell lines  originating  from  lung,  breast,  prostate,  
colon,  kidney,  melanoma  and glioblastoma.  Everolimus  was also shown  to have  activity  in acute  
myeloid  leukemia  cells (Zeng,  et al 2007),  adult  T-cell leukemia  cells (Ikezoe,  et al 2007),  
diffuse  large  B cell lymphoma  cells (DLBCL;  Wanner,  et al 2006),  pancreatic  tumor  cells 
(Tuncyurek,  et al 2007),  ovarian  cancer  cells (Treeck,  et al 2006,  Mabuchi,  et al 2007),  
hepatocellular  carcinoma  cells (Sieghart,  et al 2007),  and human  pancreatic  neuroendocrine  cells,  
where induction  of apoptosis was reported  (Zitzmann,  et al 2007).

IRB#:  08-123 A(8) 
Amended:  03/04/15  6  
  
As a single  agent,  Everolimus  inhibited  proliferation  in three  mantle  cell lymphoma  cell lines 
(Jeko1,  SP49  and NCEB1)  approximately  40–65% compared  to control  cells.  This was 
associated  with G1 cell-cycle  arrest  and reduced  phosphorylation  of the mTOR  downstream  
target,  4E-BP1 (Haritunians,  et al 2007).  
In a clonogenic  assay  using  cells derived  from  81 patient -derived  tumor  xenografts   never  
cultured  in vitro (11 human  tumor  types  with 3 to 24 tumors  each:  bladder,  colon,  gastric,  
NSCLC  [adeno,  squamous  epithelium  and large  cell],  SCLC,  breast,  ovary,  pancreatic,  renal,  
melanoma,  and pleuramesothelioma),  Everolimus  inhibited  colony  formation  in a concentration - 
dependent  manner.  In addition,  normal  hematopoetic  stem cells were  insensitive  to Everolimus,  
with an IC50  about  15 times  higher than  the tumor  lines.  
Everolimus  also inhibits  the proliferation  of human  umbilical  vein endothelial  cells (HUVECS),  
with particular  potency  against  VEGF -induced  proliferation.  The inhibition  of endothelial  
proliferation  and antiangiogenic  activity  of Everolimus  has been  confirmed  in vivo, as 
Everolimus  selectively  inhibited  VEGF -dependent  angiogenic  response.  Mice  with primary  and 
metastatic  tumors  treated  with Everolimus  showed  a significant  reduction  in blood  vessel  density  
when  compared  to controls  at well-tolerated  doses.  Additionally,  activity  in a VEGF - 
impregnated  s.c. implant  model  of angiogenesis  and reduced  vascularity  (vessel  density)  of 
Everolimus -treated  tumors  (murine  melanoma)  provided  evidence  of in vivo effects  of 
angiogenesis.  
Everolimus  also inhibits  tumor  growth  in-vivo in xenografted,  syngeneic  and orthotopic  animal  
models,  residing  longer  in tumor  tissue  than in plasma  and demonstrating  high tumor  penetration  
in a rat pancreatic  tumor  model.  These  effects  occurred  within  the dose range  of 2.5 to 10 mg/kg  
p.o. daily.  Typically,  the antitumor  activity  of Everolimus  monotherapy  was that of reduction  of 
tumor  growth  rates rather  than producing  regressions or  stable disease.  
Everolimus,  administered  p.o., was a potent  inhibitor  of tumor  growth  and well tolerated  in: 
• s.c. mouse  xenograft  model,  established  from  a variety  of tumor  cell lines  of diverse  
histotypes  (NSCLC,  pancreatic,  colon,  melanoma,  epidermoid),  including a  Pgp170 - 
overexpressing  multi -drug resistant  tumor  line. 
• a series  of low-passage  tumor  xenografts  established  directly  from  human  tumor  material,  
maintained  only in vivo and considered  highly  predictive of therapeutic outcome in patients.  
These included  breast  (5 lines),  colorectal  (9 lines ), gastric (3  lines),  lung (22 lines  including  
adenocarcinomas,  epidermoid  cell, large cell and small  cell histotypes),  melanoma  (6 lines),  
ovarian  (4 lines),  pancreatic  (3 lines) and  renal  (6 lines).  
• two syngeneic models  (CA20948 rat pancreatic,  B16/Bl6  mouse  orthotopic melanoma).  
Taken  together,  these data indicate the broad antiproliferative potential  of Everolimus.  
It is not clear  which  molecular  determinants  predict  responsiveness  of tumor  cells to Everolimus.  
Molecular  analysis  has revealed  that relative  sensitivity  to Everolimus  in vitro  correlates  with the 
degree  of phosphorylation  (activation)  of the AKT/PKB  protein  kinase  and the S6 ribosomal  
protein.  PTEN  status  alone  may not be predictive  of Everolimus  relative  to in vitro  sensitivity,  
however in some  cases  (i.e., GBM) there is also a correlation  with PTEN status.

In preclinical  models,  the administration  of Everolimus  is associated  with reduction  of protein  
phosphorylation  in target  prote ins downstream  of mTOR,  notably  phosphorylated  S6 (pS6)  and 
p4E-BP1,  and occasionally  with an increase  in phosphorylation  AKT  (pAKT).  
 
3.3.3 Pre-Clinical  Safety  
 
In safety  pharmacology  studies,  Everolimus  was devoid  of relevant  effects  on vital functions  
including  the cardiovascular,  respiratory  and nervous  systems.  Everolimus  had no influence  on 
QT interval  prolongation.  Furthermore,  Everolimus  showed  no antigenic  potential.  Although  
Everolimus  passes  the blood -brain  barrier,  there  was no indication  of relevant  changes  in the 
behavior  of rodents,  even  after single  oral doses  up to 2000mg/kg  or after repeated  
administration  at up to 40 mg/kg/day.  Based  on these  findings,  the potential  of Everolimus  to 
affect  vital functions  in patients  is considered  low. 
Everolimus  is considered  to have  no genotoxicity  or carcinogenicity  potential.  All significant  
adverse  events  observed  in preclinical  toxicology  studies  with Everolimus  in mice,  rats, monkeys  
and minipigs  were  consistent  with its anticipated  pharmacologic  action  as an antiproliferative  
and immunosuppressant  and were  at least in part reversible  after a 2- or 4-week  recovery  period  
with the exception  of the changes  in male  reproductive  organs,  most  notably  testes.  Ocular  
effects  (lenticular  disorders)  observed  in rats were  not observed  in any other  species  and are 
considered  to be  a species -specific disorder.  
More pre -clinical  information  is provided  in the  Investigator’s  Brochure.  
 
3.3.4 Everolimus  Pharmacokinetics  
 
Everolimus  is rapidly absorbed  with a median  tmax of 1-2 hours.  The bioavailability  of the drug is  
believed  to be 11% or greater.  The AUC 0-τ is dose-proportional  over the dose range  between  5 to 
70 mg in the weekly  regimen  and 5 and 10 mg in the daily  regimen.  Cmax is dose-proportional  
between  5 and 10 mg for both the weekly  and daily  regimens.  At doses  of 20 mg/week  and 
higher,  the increase  in Cmax is less than dose-proportional.  The coefficient  of variation  between  
patients  is approximately  50%.  
Trough  levels  (24 hour post-dose)  correlate  well with AUC 0-τ at steady -state during  daily  
administration.  
In whole  blood,  at a daily  dose of 10 mg, about  20% of Everolimus  is confined  in plasma  with 
26% being  unbound. The remaining  80% is sequestered  in blood cells.  
Everolimus  is extensively  metabolized  in the liver and eliminated  in the bile. Major  metabolites  
are inactive.  Elimination  half-life is approximately  30 hours.  The clearance  of Everolimus  is 
approximately  halved  in patients  with mild-moderate  hepatic  impairment  (Child -Pugh  Class  A or 
B), while  renal  impairment  has little or no impact  on its the  pharmacokinetics.  
Age,  weight  and gender  in the adult  population  do not affect  the pharmacokinetics  of Everolimus  
to a clinically  relevant  extent. The clearance of Everolimus  is reduced  in children.

Pharmacokinetic  characteristics  are not notably  different  between  Caucasian  and Japanese  
subjects,  whereas  population  pharmac okinetic  studies  have  shown  an average  20% higher  
clearance in Black  patients.  
A high-fat meal  altered  the absorption  of Everolimus  with a 1.3 hour delay  in tmax, a 60% 
reduction  in Cmax and a 16% reduction  in AUC.  
Everolimus  is a substrate  of CYP3A4  and a substrate  and moderate  inhibitor  of the multi -drug 
efflux  pump  P-glycoprotein  (P-gP, MDR1,  ABCB1).  Hence,  its metabolism  is sensitive  to drugs  
which  modify  these  enzymes  (substrates,  inducers,  or inhibitors  of these  enzymes).  Competitive  
inhibition  could  occur  when  Everolimus  is combined  with drugs  which  are also CYP3A4  or P- 
glycoprotein  substrates.  
Table 6 (Section  9.5) lists examples  of clinically  relevant  CYP3A inhibitors  and inducers.  
Please  refer to Section  9.5 for more  information  on the concomitant  use of CYP3A4  
inhibitors/inducers  and other medications.  
More information  on Everolimus  pharmacokinetics  is provided  in the  [Investigator’s  Brochure].  
3.3.5 Everolimus  Pharmacodynamic studies  
 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  modeling  based  on inhibition  of the biomarker  p70S6  kinase  
1 [S6K1]  in peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells [PBMC])  suggests  that 5-10 mg daily  should  be 
an adequate  dose to produce  a high degree  of sustained  target  inhibition  ([Study C2101]  / [Study  
2102],  Lane,  et al 2003).  Furthermore,  molecular  pharmacodynamic  (MPD)  studies  using  
immunocytochemistry  (IHC)  in biopsied  tumor  tissue  assessed  the degree  of inhibition  and its 
duration  for pS6, p4E-BP1 and pAKT  expression  with the daily  and weekly  dosing.  There  was 
high inhibition  of the downstream  markers  S6K1  and 4E-BP1 at 5mg/day,  which  was complete  
at 10 mg/day,  while  preliminary  results  suggest  an increase  in pAKT  expression  with maximal  
effect  at 10 mg daily  ([Study  C2107], Tabernero,  et al 2005).  
More information  is provided in the  Investigator’s  Brochure.  
 
3.3.6 Clinical  experience with Everolimus  
 
Everolimus  has been  investigated  as a component  of multi -drug immunosuppression  in solid  
organ  transplantation  since  1996  and was approved  for the indication  of prophylaxis  of organ  
rejection  in adult  patients  receiving  an allogeneic  renal  or cardiac  transplant  on 8 Jul 2003  by the 
European  Union  under  the trade  name  of Certican®. The most  frequent  adverse  drug reactions  in 
this context  are highly  specific  to the transplant  context.  However,  certain  events  are 
generalizable,  most notably  myelosuppression,  skin disorders  and increases  in blood lipid levels.  
Everolimus  has been in development  for patients  with cancer  since  2002.  Approximately  2586  
patients  with various  malignancies  have  been  treated  in either  Novartis -sponsored  or non- 
Novartis -sponsored  clinical  studies  as of 31 Aug 2007.  Overall,  Novartis  sponsored  a total of 22 
studies  of Everolimus  administered  either  as a single  agent  (n=848)  or in combination  with other  
anti-tumor  agents  (n=663).  Ongoing  or completed  Investigator -sponsored  studies  also enrolled  
over 1000 patients  globally.

Amended:  03/04/15  9  
  
Eight  single -agent  Novartis sponsored  trials  have  or are being  conducted  in various  advanced  
malignancies.  Five Phase  I studies  evaluated  several  escalating  doses  with either  weekly  or daily  
administration  (Studies  C2101/02,  C2106,  C2107,  C1101)  of Everolimus  with the objective  to 
identify  an optimal  regimen  and dosage  based on  safety,  pharmacokinetics,  and knowledge  of the 
drug’s  molecular  effects  on various  tumors.  The 10 mg/day  and 50-70 mg/week  dosages  were  
proposed  for further  studies  when  using  Everolimus  as a single  agent  and as a target  maximum  
dose in combination  studies.  In addition,  the Phase  I studies  conducted  in prostate  cancer  (Study  
C2106)  and in Japanese  patients  with advanced  cancers  (Study  C1101)  evaluated  the safety  and 
the molecular changes  in tumors  associated  with the administration  of Everolimus.  
Two Phase  II monotherapy  studies  were  designed  to evaluate  the safety  and efficacy  of a single  
dose of 10 mg administered  daily,  including  Study C2235  in advanced  NSCLC  (n=81)  and Study  
C2239 in advanced  pancreatic neuroendrine tumors (n=160).  
A Phase  III study  (Study  C2240)  is ongoing  and designed  to demonstrate  the safety  and efficacy  
of Everolimus  at an oral dose of 10 mg versus  matching  placebo  in patients  with metastatic  
carcinoma  of the kidney,  whose  disease  has progressed  despite  prior  VEGF -R tyrosine  kinase  
inhibitor  therapy.  Over  400 patients  have  been enrolled  in this prospective,  randomized,  
multicenter study,  which  remains  blinded  as of the cut-off date.  
Overall,  the most  frequent  mild-moderate  Grade  1 and 2 adverse  effects  have been  rash,  
stomatitis,  fatigue,  neutropenia  and, to a lesser  extent,  gastrointestinal  disorders  (nausea,  
anorexia,  diarrhea,  vomiting)  and headache.  The primary  DLT  has been  severe  (Grade  3) 
stomatitis,  and occasionally  fatigue,  hyperglycemia,  and neutropenia.  Reduced  blood  counts,  
hyperlipidemia  (mainly  hypercholesterolemia),  and hyperglycemia  are relatively  frequent  
laboratory  findings.  Infections  have not been notably  frequent  or severe.  Severe  non-infectious  
low-Grade  (Grade  1 and 2) pneumonitis  has led to development  of treatment  guidelines  for the 
disorder (Table 3 -2). Preliminary  indications  of anti-tumor  activity  are encouraging.  
Refer to Section  9 for more  information  on known  undesirable effects  of Everolimus.

3.3.7 Rationale for the Study  Population  
The first -line treatment  of patients  with metastatic  urothelial  carcinoma varies  and may involve  a 
cisplatin - or carboplatin -based  doublet,  triplet,  the four drug MVAC  regimen,  or a sequential  
doublet  regimen.  Furthermore,  many  patients  with metastatic dis ease have  previously  received  
cytotoxic chemotherapy  in the  perioperative setting.  Given  this heterogeneity  in prior exposure to  
chemotherapy,  the definition of  “second -line” or “third -line”  chemotherapy  has not been well  
characterized.  As a result, we have designed  the eligibility  for this protocol  based  on the  number  
of prior chemotherapeutic agents  patients  have  received  rather than  the number  of “lines”  of 
therapy  that have  been administered.  Second -line chemotherapy  trials  have  typically  included  
patients  who have received  either 1 or ≥ 1 prior  regimen(s).   Clinical  trials  at MSKCC  have 
included  a maximum of  4 prior drugs  because patients are treated  with multiple  agents  in the  
community  before referral.   There  are no available data demonstrating  that the response  
proportion  in the  relapsed  setting  is linked  to the  number of prior  regimens;  this concept  has been

reinforced  identifying  Sunitinib as active in a MSKCC  phase 2 trial of patients with metastatic  
urothelial  cancer who  have received  a maximum  of 4 prior drugs  (J Clin Oncol  2008 Vol. 26, No 
15S, p. 270s Abstract  #5082).   This prior treatment  inclusion  criteria will  serve to enhance  
accrual  and likely  ultimately  provide  a more  homogenous  patient population  (e.g.,  most patients  
will have been  exposed to a  platinum,  gemcitabine,  and a taxane  at some  point in their treatment  
history).  Further,  we do not anticipate the response  to this targeted  agent  to be closely  linked  to 
the number of prior  cytotoxic  agents  administered.   If Everolimus  demonstrates  activity  in this  
second -line trial,  future  trials will include an  evaluation  of the combination  of Everolimus  with 
chemotherapy  in the  first- and second -line settings.  
 
3.3.8 Rationale for a PFS Endpoint  
Pertinent  to the  issue  of discovering  new drugs active  in urothelial  cancers  is that identifying  
clinical  benefit  should not be  limited  to response.  Some  of the newer "targeted  therapy"  agents  
approved  by the FDA have  been  approved  on the  basis  of improved  progression -free survival  
(PFS) and  not response  rate (e.g.,  sorafenib in renal  cell carcinoma with  a response  rate of 
approximately  10% but a  major impact  in PFS and, eventually,  an improveme nt in survival).  
This being  said, the median progression -free survival for bladder  cancer  patients treated  with 
chemotherapy  is modest  at only 2-3 months and response  rates are in the  10-20% range.   In a 
second -line trial  of weekly  paclitaxel in 31 patients  with progressive urothelial  cancer,  the 
median  time to progression  was 2.2 months[4].  In an ECOG trial  evaluating  the epothilone  
analog  BMS -247550  in patients with relapsed  urothelial  cancer,  the median  progression -free 
survival  was 2.7 months (95% CI,  1.8, 4.1)[5].  In a recently  reported  phase  3 randomized  
second -line trial  of vinflunine  versus  best supportive  care,  the PFS for patients treated  with 
vinflunine was  3.0 months (95% CI,  2.1, 4.0)  (J Clin Oncol  2008 Vol. 26, No 15S, p. 257s  
Abstract  #5028).   Novel therapies  are desperately  needed  for these patients and identifying  
activity  in the  refractory  setting  by using  PFS is considered  an acceptable  approach  with these  
new targeted  agents.  
 
A recently  reported  randomized, double -blind,  multicenter trial  of Everolimus  versus  placebo  has 
demonstrated  a statistically  and clinically  significant improvement  in progression -free survival  
(HR=0.30,  p <0.0001),  with a  favorable safety  profile  in patients  with metastatic renal  cell 
carcinoma  after progression  on VEGFr -TKI therapy  ((J Clin Oncol  2008 Vol. 26, No 15S, p.  
256s Abstract  #LBA5026).   Based  on a sample size of 362 patients,  this trial had a 90% power  to 
detect  a 33% risk reduction  with a median  exponential  PFS improvement  from  3.0 to 4.5 months.  
The PFS  for Everolimus -treated  patients  was 4.0  months (3.7-5.5) versus  1.9 months (1.8-1.9) 
for those  treated  with placebo.  Pertinent  to this study,  only 3% of patients had a partial  response  
by RECIST a nd the majority  of patients had stable  disease.  Also pertinent  to this proposed  trial 
in bladder cancer  is the  fact that the kidney  cancer  trial was also not a  pure “second -line” trial;  
approximately  50% of patients had received  more  than one prior TKI.  Everolimus  was well– 
tolerated,  with the most common adverse events including  stomatitis,  anemia and  asthenia.  This 
trial establishes  precedent  for the use of PFS as an endpoint  for RAD001  trials in other diseases  
in the  “second -line” setting.

4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is an open -label  Phase  II study  of Everolimus  in patients  with progressive  
advanced/metastatic urothelial  carcinoma that  have  progressed  despite treatment with prior  
cytotoxic chemotherapy.  
 
 
The primary  endpoints  of this study  will be: 
 
• To measure the two-month PFS rate of Everolimus  (RAD001) as  determined  by RECIST  
• To determine the safety  and toxicity  of Everolimus  (RAD001) in this patient  population  
The secondary  endpoints  of this study  will be: 
• To determine the response  rate of Everolimus  in patients  with progressive  urothelial  cancer  
who have received  prior  cytotoxic chemotherapy.  
• To assess  markers  for activated  mTOR  pathway  (including  phospho -S6 and phsopho -4E 
BP1) in all pre-treatment  tissue  specimens  and correlate with  response  to treatment  and PFS.  
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
Everolimus  will be administered  at a dose of 10 mg orally once  daily continuously.  Intra-patient  
dose reduction  may be required  depending  on the type and severity  of the individual  toxicity  
encountered.  Re-staging  imaging  studies  will be performed  after every  two cycles  of treatment  
(one cycle  = 4 weeks)  during  the first five years  of treatment,  and after every  3-6 cycles  of 
treatment  thereafter.  Patients  may continue  on study  as long as they are tolerating  therapy  and 
are free of disease  progression.  
 
5.1 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
 
5.2 Investigational  Drug  Description  
 
Everolimus  (RAD001)  is a novel  oral derivative  of rapamycin.  Everolimus  will be administered  
orally  as a once -daily  dose of 10 mg (two 5 mg tablets)  continuously  from  study  day 1 until 
progression  of disease  or unacceptable  toxicity.  Patients  will be instructed  to take Everolimus  in 
the morning,  at the same  time each day. 
Everolimus  should  be taken  by the patient  in a fasting  state or with no more  than a light fat-free 
meal.  Dietary  habits  around  the time of Everolimus  intake  should  be as consistent  as possible  
throughout  the study.  
If vomiting  occurs,  no attempt should be  made to replace the vomited  dose.

5.3 Drug  Dispensing/Administration  
 
Administration  will be performed  on an outpatient  basis.  Everolimus  will be dispensed  as tablets  
at the beginning  of each treatment  cycle  (or, for patients  who have completed  five years  of 
treatment,  at the beginning  of every other  treatment  cycle).  In case of dose modification,  patients  
will be asked  to return  all of their previously  dispensed  medication  to the clinic  and they will be 
dispensed  with new strength  capsules.  
All dosages  prescribed  and dispensed  to the patient  and all dose changes  during  the study  must  
be recorded.  
Medication  labels  will comply  with US legal  requirements  and will be printed  in English.  They  
will supply  no information  about  the patient.  The storage  conditions  for study  drug will be 
described  on the  medication label.  
Everolimus  will be provided  by Novartis.  Everolimus  is formulated  as tablets  for oral 
administration  of 5mg strength.  Tablets  are blister -packed  under  aluminum  foil in units  of 10 
tablets,  which  should  be opened  only at the time of administration  as drug is both hygroscopic  
and light-sensitive.  
 
 
5.4 Storage and Stability  
 
Current  stability  data permit  a shelf  life of either  36 months  (for 5mg tablet  variants  based  on 
solid  dispersion  dried  by evaporation/drying  oven)  or 24 months  (for 2.5mg,  5 mg and 10 mg 
tablet  variants  based  on solid  dispersion  dried  by paddle  dryer),  assuming  correct  storage  below  
30oC in the original  double -sided  aluminium  blister  packaging  and protected  from  light and 
moisture.  
 
5.5 Source of Drug  
 
Novartis,  Inc. will supply  Everolimus  free of charge.  
 
 
5.6 Drug  Accountability  
 
 
All study  drug supplies  must  be kept in a locked  room  with limited  access.  The study  drug must  
not be used outside  the context  of this protocol.  Under  no circumstances  should  the investigator  
or other  site personnel  supply  study  drug to other  investigators,  patients,  or clinic,  or allow  
supplies  to be used other  than directed  by this protocol  without  prior  authorization  from  
Novartis.  
 
The pharmacist  will maintain  a complete  drug accountability  record  for each capsule  strength  
with lot numbers  of each drug received,  including  the number  of bottles  dispensed  to each 
patient,  the dates  drug was dispensed,  and the daily dose  of Everolimus  the patient  received.  The 
prescribed  dose should also be  recorded  in the  patient’s  medical  records.

6.1 CRITERIA FOR SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY  
 
Patients  must  have  baseline  evaluations  performed  prior  to the first dose of study  drug and must  
meet  all inclusion  and exclusion  criteria.  Results  of all baseline  evaluations,  which  assure  that all 
inclusion  and exclusion  criteria  have  been  satisfied,  must  be reviewed  by the Principal  
Investigator  or his/her  designee  prior  to enrollment  of that patient.  In addition,  the patient  must  
be thoroughly informed  about  all aspects  of the study,  including  the study visit  schedule,  
required  evaluations,  and all regulatory  requirements  for informed  consent.  The written  informed  
consent  must  be obtained  from  the patient  prior  to enrollment.  The following  criteria  apply to  all 
patients  enrolled  onto the  study  unless  otherwise specified.  
 
6.2 Subject Inclusion  Criteria  
 
• Patients  must have a diagnosis of  urothelial  carcinoma of the bladder,  urethra,  ureter,  or renal  
pelvis,  with histological  confirmation  at MSKCC.  
• Patients  must have progressive metastatic disease.  Progressive disease  will be defined  as new 
or progressive lesions on cross -sectional  imaging.  
• Patients  must have at  least one  measurable site of disease (according  to RECIST criteria) that  
has not been  previously  irradi ated.  If the patient has had previous  radiation  to the  marker  
lesion(s),  there must be  evidence of progression  since  the radiation.  
• Patients  must have been  previously  treated,  as defined  by the following:  
• Treatment  with at least one prior cytotoxic  agent  but not more than  four prior  
cytotoxic agents.   Up to four  prior chemotherapy  agents  are allowed,  since  
conventional  chemotherapy  ranges  from just one  drug (e.g.,  gemcitabine) to regimens  
that contain  four agents (e.g.,  M-VAC  is a four-drug regimen  containing  
methotrexate,  vinblastine,  doxorubicin, and cisplatin).  
• The prior therapy  must have included  at least one of the following:  cisplatin,  
carboplatin,  paclitaxel, docetaxel,  or gemcitabine.  
• The prior cytotoxic  agents may  have  been  administered  in the  perioperative  or 
metastatic setting  and may have  been administered  sequentially  (e.g.,  first-line 
treatment  followed  by second -line treatment  at time of progression) or as part of a 
single regimen.  
• Pre-treatment  tumor  tissue  available  for analysis  of m-TOR  pathway  markers  
• Age ≥ 18 years  
• Karonfsky  Performance  Status  ≥ 60%

• Fasting  serum  cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL  OR ≤7.75 mmol/L  AND  fasting  triglycerides  ≤ 2.5 x  
ULN.  NOTE:  If a patient's  lipid values  exceed  either one of these  criteria upon screening,  the 
patient  can only become  eligible after successful  initiation of  appropriate lipid-lowering  
medication.  After lipid-lowering  therapy,  patients  must meet  the same criteria – i.e. a fasting  
serum  cholesterol  ≤300  mg/dL  OR ≤7.75 mmol/L  AND  fasting  triglycerides  ≤ 2.5 x  ULN  – 
to be  eligible for study  treatment.

7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
Patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinics of the Genitourinary 
Oncology Service at  
Memorial  Sloan-Kettering  Cancer Center (MSKCC).  Potential  research  subjects  will be 
identified  by a member  of the patient’s  treatment  team,  the protocol  investigator,  or the research  
team.  If the investigator  is a member  of the treatment  team,  s/he will screen  their patient’s  
medical  records  for suitable  research  study  participants  and discuss  the study  and their potential  
for enrolling  in the research  study.  Potential  subjects  contacted  by their treating  physician  will 
be referred  to the investigator/research  staff of the study.  The patient’s  initial  conversation  with 
the investigator/research  staff and portions  of the patient’s  MSKCC  medical  records  will be used 
to confirm  that the patient is eligible for study  participation.

9.1 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN  
 
9.2 Schedule and Dose  Administration  
 
The study  drug Everolimus  will be self-administered  on an outpatient  basis.  The investigator  
will instruct  the patient  to take the study  drug exactly  as specified  in the  protocol section  5.1. 
Everolimus  will be administered  orally  as a once -daily  dose of 10 mg (Two  5 mg  tablets)  
continuously  from  study  day 1 until progression  of disease or unacceptable  toxicity.

IRB Protocol  
IRB#:  08-123 A(8) 
Amended:  03/04/15  18  
  
 
The start of the next cycle  may be delayed  if additional  time is required  for the patient  to 
recover  from  Everolimus -associated  toxicity  experienced  during  the previous  cycle.  However,  
imaging  will occur  at regular  intervals.  The study  investigator  may implement  dose 
suspension  or reduction  in order to ensure  patient  safety  (see section  9.2). 
 
9.3 Dose Modifications  
 
Patients  will be monitored  closely  for toxicity,  and the  Everolimus  dose may be adjusted  
according  to individual  patient tolerance.  For patients who are unable  to tolerate the protocol - 
specified  dosing  schedule,  dose adjustments  are permitted  in order to keep  the patient  on 
study  drug.  
If administration  of Everolimus  must be  interrupted  because of unacceptable  toxicity,  drug 
dosing  will be interrupted  or modified  according  to rules  described  in Table  4. Toxicity  will 
be assessed  using  the NIH-NCI Common Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events,  version  
3.0 (CTCAEv3.0,  http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAEv3.pdf ).

Toxicity  Actions  
Non-hematological  toxicity   
Grade 2 
(except  pneumonitis  – refer to Table 5 If the toxicity  is tolerable to the patient,  maintain the 
same dose.  If the toxicity  is intolerable to patient,  
interrupt Everolimus  until recovery  to grade 1. Then  
reintroduce Everolimus  at same dose.  
If event  returns  to grade 2, interrupt  Everolimus  until 
recovery  to grade 1, then reintroduce  Everolimus  at 
the lower  dose level.  
Grade 3 
(except  hyperlipidemia*)(except  pneumonitis  – refer to Table 5 Interrupt  Everolimus  until recovery  to grade 1, then  
reintroduce Everolimus  at the lower  dose level.  For 
pneumonitis  consider  the use of a short  course of  
corticosteroids.  
Grade 4 
(including  hyperlipidemia)  Discontinue Everolimus.  
Hematological  toxicity   
Grade 2 Thrombocytopenia  (platelets  <75, ≥ 50x109/L) Interrupt  Everolimus  until recovery  to grade 1 (>75 
x109/L), then reintroduce Everolimus  at initial  dose.  
If thrombocytopenia again  returns  to grade 2, interrupt  
Everolimus  until recovery  to grade 1. Then  reintroduce  
Everolimus  at the lower  dose level.  
Grade  3 Thrombocytopenia  ( platelets  <50 , ≥ 25 x 109 /L) Interrupt  Everolimus  until recovery  to grade ≤1  
(platelets  ≥ 75 x109/L).  Then  resume  Everolimus  at one 
dose level  lower.   If grade  3 thrombocytopenia  recurs,  
discontinue Everolimus.  
Grade  4 Thrombocytopenia  (platelets  < 25 x109/L) Discontinue Everolimus.  
Grade 3 Neutropenia  (neutrophils  <1, ≥0.5  x109/L) Interrupt  Everolimus  until recovery  to grade 1 
(neutrophils  ≥ 1.5 x 109/L), then resume  Everolimus  at 
the initial dose.   If ANC  again  returns  to Grade 3, hold 
Everolimus  until the ANC  ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, then resume  
Everolimus  dosing  at the lower  dose level.   Discontinue  
patient  from  study  therapy  for a third episode of  grade 3 
neutropenia.  
Grade 4 Neutropenia  (neutrophils  < 0.5 x109/L) Interrupt  Everolimus  until recovery  to grade  1 
(neutrophils  ≥ 1.5 x 109/L). Then  resume Everolimus  at 
the lower  dose level.  If grade 3 or grade 4 neutropenia  
occurs  despite this  dose reduction, discontinue  
Everolimus.  
Grade 3 febrile neutropenia  (not life-threatening)  Interrupt  Everolimus  until resolution  of fever  and 
neutropenia to grade ≤ 1. Hold  further  Everolimus  until 
the ANC  ≥ 1,500/mm3 and fever  has resolved.  Then  
resume Everolimus  at the lower  dose level.  If febrile  
neutropenia recurs, discontinue Everolimus.  
Grade 4 febrile neutropenia  (life-threatening)  Discontinue Everolimus.  
Any hematological or non-hematological  toxicity requiring  
interruption  for ≥ 3 weeks  Discontinue Everolimus.  
*Grade  3 hyperlipidemia  (hypercholesterolemia  and/or  hypertriglyceridemia)  should  be managed  
using  medical  therapies  (see Sec. 9.3.2).

9.3 Monitoring  of Everolimus  suspected  toxicities  
 
Patients  whose treatment  is interrupted  or permanently  discontinued  due to an adverse event or  
an abnormal  laboratory  value  suspected  to be related  to Everolimus  must be  followed  at least 
weekly  until the  adverse  event  or abnormal  laboratory  value  resolves  or returns  to grade 1. If a 
patient  requires  a dose delay  of > 21 days from  the intended  day of the next scheduled  dose,  then 
the patient  must be  discontinued  from  the study.  
9.3.1 Management of stomatitis/oral  mucositis/mouth  ulcers  
 
Stomatitis/oral   mucositis/mouth   ulcers   due  to  Everolimus   should  be  treated   using  local  
supportive care.  
When  described,  the disorder  has been  identified  as inflammation  or ulcers  in the mouth.  If exam  
reveals  mouth  ulcers,  rather  than a more  general  inflammation  of the mouth,  please  classify  the 
adverse  event  as ‘mouth  ulcers.’  If inflammation  is limited  to the mouth  without  ulcers,  please  
use the term ‘stomatitis’ rather than  the less specific term  ‘mucositis.’  
If the disorder  appears  elsewhere  other  than the mouth,  please  describe  the location  as well as 
any specific procedures  carried  out for  exploration  (e.g. endoscopy).  
Please  use the Grading  according  to the NIH-NCI Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  
Events,  Version  3.0 (CTCAE v3.0;  http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAEv3.pdf).  
Grade 1: minimal  symptoms;  normal diet 
Grade 2: symptomatic but can eat and swallow modified  diet 
Grade 3: symptomatic and  unable  to adequately  aliment or hydrate orally  
Grade 4: symptoms  associated  with life-threatening  consequences  
Recommendations:  
1. For mild toxicity  (Grade  1), use conservative measures such as non-alcoholic  mouthwash  or 
salt water (0.9%)  mouthwash  several  times  a day until resolution.  
2. For more severe  toxicity  (Grade 2 or 3), the suggested treatments  are topical analgesic mouth  
treatments  (i.e., local anesthetics  such as benzocaine,  butyl  aminobenzoate,  tetracaine  
hydrochloride,  menthol,  or phenol) with  or without topical  corticosteroids,  such as 
triamcinolone oral  paste  0.1%  (e.g. Kenalog  in Orabase®). 
3. Agents  containing  hydrogen  peroxide, iodine,  and thyme derivatives  may tend to worsen  
mouth ulcers.  It is preferable  to avoid  these agents.  
Antifungal  agents  must  be avoided  unless  a fungal  infection  is diagnosed.  In particular,  systemic  
imidazole  antifungal  agents  (ketoconazole,  fluconazole,  itraconazole,  etc.) should  be avoided  in 
all patients  due to their strong  inhibition  of Everolimus  metabolism  (which  leads  to higher  
Everolimus  exposures).  Therefore,  topical  antifungal  agents  are preferred  if an infection  is 
diagnosed.  Similarly,  antiviral  agents  such as acyclovir  should  be avoided  unless  a viral infection  
is diagnosed.

9.3.2 Management of hyperlipidemia  and hyperglycemia  
 
Treatment  of hyperlipidemia  should  take into account  the pre-treatment  status  and dietary habits.  
Blood  tests to monitor  hyperlipidemia  must  be taken  in the fasting  state.  Grade  2 or higher  
hypercholesterolemia  (>300  mg/dL  or 7.75 mmol/L)  or grade  2 or higher  hypertriglyceridemia  
(>2.5  x upper  normal  limit)  should  be treated  with a statin  or appropriate  lipid-lowering  
medication  in addition  to diet. Patients  should  be monitored  clinically  and through  serum  
biochemistry  for the development  of rhabdomyolysis  and other  adverse  events  as required  in the 
product  label/data  sheets  for HMG -CoA  reductase  inhibitors.  Patients  who develop  grade  4 
hyperglycemia or grade  4 hyperlipidemia will  be withdr awn from  study.  
Note:  Concomitant  therapy  with fibrates  and an HMG -CoA  reductase  inhibitor  is associated  with 
an increased  risk of a rare but serious  skeletal  muscle  toxicity  manifested  by rhabdomyolysis,  
markedly  elevated  creatine  kinase  (CPK)  levels  and myoglobinuria,  acute  renal  failure,  and 
sometimes  death.  The risk versus  benefit  of using  this therapy  should  be determined  for 
individual  patients  based  on their risk  of cardiovascular complications  of hyperlipidemia.  
Grade  3 hyperglycemia  has been observed  in patients  receiving  Everolimus  therapy.  In many  
cases  in [Study  Everolimus  C2222]  the affected  patients  had an abnormal  fasting  glucose  at 
baseline.  Based  on this finding,  optimal  glucose  control  (indicated  by fasting triglycerides  ≤ 2.5 
x ULN)  must  be achieved  before  starting  a patient  on Everolimus.  Study  patients  should  have  
their glucose levels  monitored during  Everolimus  therapy.  
 
9.3.3 Management of non-infectious  pneumonitis  
 
Both  asymptomatic  radiological  changes  (grade  1) and symptomatic  non-infectious  pneumonitis  
(grade  2 = not interfering  with activities  of daily  living  or grade  3 = interfering  with activities  of 
daily  living  and oxygen  indicated)  have  been  noted  in patients  receiving  Everolimus  therapy.  
Non-infectious  pneumonitis  has been associated  with Everolimus  and other  mTOR  inhibitors  
(Atkins  2004).  All patients  are required  to undergo  baseline/pretreatment  pulmonary  function  
tests and will be excluded from  study  treatment  if TLC <50% predicted,  FVC  <50% predicted,  or 
DLCO  <40%  predicted.  In order  to monitor  for asymptomatic  (grade  1) non-infectious  
pneumonitis  during  study  treatment,  a chest  CT scan or chest  x-ray is required  in addition  to the 
monthly  radiological  tumor  examinations.  Additional  chest  CT scans  may be performed  when  
clinically  necessary.  If non-infectious  pneumonitis  develops,  a consultation  with a pulmonologist  
should  be considered.  If the patient  develops  grade  3 pneumonitis,  treatment  with Everolimus  
should  be interrupted  and the patient  should  be treated  as medically  indicated  (short  course  
corticosteroids,  oxygen,  etc). 
Management  of non-infectious  pneumonitis  suspected  to be associated  with Everolimus  and dose 
modification  instructions  are provided in Table 5. 
The attribution  of changes  on interval  chest  imaging  will be recorded  as related,  possibly related,  
or unrelated  to study  drug.

-------------------------------------  
reactivation  is defined  as: 
New  appearance  of measurable  
HBV -DNA  Treat:  Start  first antiviral  medication  
AND  
Interrupt  study  drug administration  until resolution:  
• ≤ baseline  HBV -DNA  levels  
If resolution  occurs  within  ≤ 28 days,  study  drug should  be re-started  at one 
dose level  lower,  if available.  If the patient  is already  receiving  the lowest  
dose of study  drug according  to the protocol,  the patient  should  restart  at the 
same  dose after resolution.  Antiviral  therapy  should  continue  at least 4 
weeks  after last dose of study  drug.  
If resolution  occurs  > 28 days,  patients  should  discontinue  study  drug but 
continue  antiviral  therapy  at least 4 weeks  after last dose of study  drug.  
* All reactivations  of hepatitis B  are to be  recorded  as grade 3 (CTCAE v 3.0 Metabolic  
Laboratory/Other:  Viral  Re-activation),  unless  considered  life threatening by the investigator;  in 
which  case they should be  recorded  as grade  4 (CTCAE  v 3.0 Metabolic  Laboratory/Other:  Viral  
Re-activation).  Date  of viral reactivation  is the  date on which  both DNA  and ALT  criteria were  
met (e.g. for a patient  who was HBV -DNA positive  on 01-JAN-10 and whose  ALT reached  ≥ 5 
× ULN on 01-APR -10, the date of viral reactivation  is 01-APR -10). 
9.3.5 Hepatitis  C management  
The  following  two  categories   of  patients   should  be  monitored   every   4  weeks   for  HCV  
reactivation:  
• Patients  with detectable   HCV RNA -PCR  test at baseline.  
• Patients  known  to have a history  of HCV  infection,  despite  a negative  viral load test at 
baseline (including  those  that were treated  and are considered  ‘cured’)  
For definition of  hepatitis  C reactivation  and the management  guidelines,  see Table 8.

detectable  HCV -RNA,  reactivation  is defined  as: 
New  appearance  of detectable  HCV -RNA  Discontinue  study  drug 
* All reactivations  of hepatitis C are to be  recorded  as grade 3 (CTCAE v 3.0 Metabolic  
Laboratory/Other:  Viral  Re-activation),  unless  considered  life threatening by the investigator;  in 
which  case they should be  recorded  as grade  4 (CTCAE  v 3.0 Metabolic  Laboratory/Other:  Viral  
Re-activation).  
 
 
All interruptio ns or changes  to study  drug administration  must be  recorded.  
 
It will be documented  whether or not each patient completed  the clinical  study.  If, for any 
patient,  either study  treatment  or observations  are discontinued,  the reason  will be recorded.  
 
9.4 Treatment  Compliance  
 
Records  of study  medication  used,  dosages  administered,  and intervals  between  visits  will be 
recorded  during  the study.  Drug  accountability  will be noted  and patients  will be asked  to return  
all unused  study  medication.  
 
9.5 Concomitant Medications  
 
Patients  will be instructed  not to take any additional  medications  (including  over-the-counter  
products)  during  the course  of the study without  prior  consultation  with the investigator.  At each 
visit,  the investigator  will ask the patient  about  any new medications  he/she  is or has taken  after 
the start of the study  drug.  
All Concomitant  medications/Significant  non-drug therapies  taken  ≤ 30 days prior  to start and 
after start of  study  drug, including  physical  therapy  and blood transfusions,  should be  recorded.  
The following  restrictions  apply  during  the entire  duration  of the study:  
• No other investigational  therapy  should be  given  to patients.  
• No anticancer  agents  other  than the study  medication  should  be given  to patients.  If such 
agents  are required  for a patient  then the patient  must first be withdrawn  from the  study.  
• Growth  factors  (e.g.G -CSF,  GM-CSF,  erythropoietin,  platelets  growth  factors  etc.) are not to 
Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center  
IRB Protocol

Amended:  03/04/15  26  
  
be administered  prophylactically  but may be prescribed  by the investigator  for rescue  from  
severe hematologic events if  this is thought  to be  appropriate.  
• Concurrent  administration  of Everolimus  and strong  CYP3A4  inhibitors  (such  as 
ketoconazole,  itraconazole,  ritonavir) and  inducers  (such  as rifampin,  rifabutin) should be  
avoided.  Provided  there  is no alternative treatment  available,  patients  should be  closely  
monitored  for potential  toxicities.  
• Concurrent  administration  of Everolimus  and moderate CYP3A4  inhibitors  (such  as 
erythromycin,  fluconazole,  calcium  channel  blockers,  benzodiazepines) and moderate  
CYP3A4  inducers  (e.g. carbamazepine,  phenobarbital, phenytoin) should also be  avoided  if 
possible,  or used subject  to caution  (e.g. incre ased frequency  of safety  monitoring,  temporary  
interruption  of Everolimus).  
• Competitive inhibition  could  occur when Everolimus  is combined  with drugs  which  are also 
CYP3A4  substrates.  Caution  should be  exercised  in such cases.  
• Co-administration  with substrates,  inducers,  or inhibitors  of P-glycoprotein  should be  
avoided,  if possible,  or used subject  to caution  (e.g. increased  frequency  of safety  monitoring,  
temporary  interruption  of Everolimus).  
• Grapefruit  and grapefruit  juice a ffect cytochrome  P450 and P-glycoprotein  activity  and 
should therefore be avoided.  
• In addition,  patients  should  avoid  Seville  oranges  and star fruit as well as the juice  of these  
fruits,  which  are potent  CYP3A4 -inhibitors.  
• No chronic treatment  with systemic steroids  or immunosuppressive  agents  except  
corticosteroids  with a daily  dosage  equivalent  to prednisone  ≤ 20 mg  should be  administered.  
Patients  receiving  corticosteroids  must have been  on a stable dosage  regimen  for a minimum  
of 4 weeks  prior  to the  first treatment  with Everolimus.  Topical  or inhaled  corticosteroids  are 
allowed.  
• Everolimus  may affect  the response  to vaccinations,  making  the response  to the vaccination  
less effective.  Live vaccines should be  avoided  while a patient  is treated  with Everolimus.  
Oral anticoagulants  such as warfarin  are CYP2C9  substrates;  as such,  no interaction  with 
Everolimus  is expected.  However,  drug-drug interaction  studies  between  macrolide  antibiotics  
and warfarin  have  produced  mixed  outcomes  and the disparity  in these  findings  has led to the 
conclusion  that multiple  factors  may alter the clearance  of warfarin.  The coadministration  of 
Everolimus  and oral anticoagulants  is possible  but should  be subject  to verification  of 
coagulation  (INR) once  steady  state is reached  (after one week’s  treatment).  
Examples  are provided  in Table  6. A comprehensive  list of cytochrome  P450  isoenzymes  and 
CYP3A4  inhibitors,  inducers,  and substrates  can be found  at http://medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart .

* asterisk  denotes  strong  inhibition/induction  
Please  note:  
- strong  inhibitor  implies  that it can cause  ≥5-fold increase  in AUC or ≥80%  decrease  in clearance  of 
sensitive  CYP substrates  
- moderate  inhibitor  implies that it can cause  2- to 5-fold increase  in AUC  values  or 50-80% decrease  in 
clearance   of sensitive  CYP substrates.  
(Distinction  is not always  categorical  as interaction  can vary according  to conditions).  
1. Macrolide  antibiotics:    Azithromycin  is not a CYP3A  substrate.  Therefore,  it may be employed  where  
antibiotherapy with  a macrolide  is desirable  in a patient  being  treated  with Everolimus.  
2. Statins:  Atorvastatin  and pravastatin  may be associated  with Everolimus,  since  a PK interaction  study  has 
shown  that there  is no relevant  PK interaction.

 Footnotes  for Schedule  of Events  
1.Complete blood  count  (CBC)  with differential  and platelets  
2. Comprehensive  panel  (i.e. serum  electrolytes  including  sodium,  potassium,  chloride,  bicarbonate,  phosphorus,  calcium,  glucose,  blood  urea nitrogen,  creatinine,  SGOT  
(AST),  SGPT  (ALT),  alkaline  phosphatase,  total bilirubin,  total protein,  albumin,  uric acid).  
Fasting Lipids include  triglycerides,  total cholesterol,  HDL  and LDL.  
3. Disease  Assessment/Tumor  Measurements:  Re-staging  imaging  studies  will be performed  after every  two cycles  of treatment  (1 cycle  = 4 weeks)  during  the first five years  of 
treatment  and after study  completion  or withdrawal.  Imaging  studies  should  be performed  during  weeks  7 or 8. The same  imaging  studies  performed  at baseline  (e.g.,  CT or 
MRI)  should  be performed  throughout  the study,  when  possible.  Baseline  chest  CT or chest  x-ray must  be performed.  If chest  CT or chest  x-ray is not part of the disease  
assessment,  it must  be repeated  every  2 months.  Bone x -ray(s)/scan  to be performed  if bone  metastases  are present.  
4. Adverse  Events:  Patients  must  be followed  for adverse  events  from  the first day of study  treatment  until at least 28 days after the last on-study  treatment  administration,  or 
until all serious  or study  drug-related  toxicities  have resolved  or are determined  to be “chronic”  or “stable,”  whichever  is later.  Serious  adverse  events  should  be monitored  and 
reported  as described  in the protocol.  
5. Post-study survival  status:  Follow -up survival  information  will be collected  for all patients  by clinic  visit or telephone  contact  approximately every  6 months  for up to 2 years  
from  the date of first dose of Everolimus.  Patients will be followed until disease progression and/or  death.  
6. Physical  Examination/Hematology/Biochemistry/Fasting Lipids:  Physical  Examination/  Hematology/  Biochemistry/Fasting Lipids on  Cycle 1 Day 1 is not required  if 
performed  within  7 days of Day 1 unless clinically  indicated.  
7. Post Treatment/Withdrawal:  This visit will take place  1 month  after the last dose of study  drug.  Patients  with ongoing  study  drug-related  toxicities  should  be followed  as 
dictated  in footnote  4. These patients should  be followed  at the interval  deemed  appropriate by their study  physician.  
8. Everolimus:  Everolimus  will be orally  self-administered,  once  daily  in the morning.  Patients  will receive  a prescription  for a 4-week  supply  of drug at the beginning  of each 
cycle  during  their first five years  of treatment.  After  five years  of treatment,  patients  will receive  a prescription  for an 8-week  supply  of drug at the beginning  of every  other  
cycle.  The Everolimus  drug bottles  (including  any unused  capsules)  will be returned  to the clinic for  drug accountability  at each study  visit.  
9. Serum  or urine  test must  be performed  for all women  of childbearing potential.  
10. Pre-treatment  tumor  tissue  specimens  for all patients  will be analyzed  using  immunohistochemistry  for markers  including  those  of an activated  mTOR  pathway  including  
phsopho -S6 and phospho -4E BP1.  Note  that the study will  not require research  biopsies.  
11.  Treatment  Compliance:  At the start of each cycle,  patients  will be given  a Pill Diary  and asked  to record  the time,  date,  concomitant  drugs,  and side-effects  of each dose of 
Everolimus  taken.  
12. All patients should be screened  for hepatitis risk factors  and any past illnesses  of hepatitis B and  hepatitis C.  It is highly  recommended that patients with positive HBV - 
DNA  or HBsAg are treated  prophylactically with  an antiviral  for 1-2 weeks  prior to receiving study  drug.  The antiviral  treatment  should  continue throughout  the entire study  
period  and for at least 4 weeks  after the last dose of study  drug. Patients with viral hepatitis C risk factors  should  be screened  for HCV  RNA -PCR.  
13.  Patients on  antiviral  prophylaxis  treatment  or positive  HBV  antibodies  should  be tested  for HBV -DNA   according  to study  visit schedule.  Patients  with positive  HCV -RNA  
PCR  or a history  of past infection,  even  if treated  and considered  ‘cured’  – should  be followed  by HCV -RNA  PCR  according to visit schedule.

11.0     TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
Adverse  events  most  frequently  observed  with Everolimus  are rash,  stomatitis/oral  mucositis,  
fatigue,  headache,  anorexia,  nausea,  vomiting,  and diarrhea.  Infections  have not been  notably  
frequent  or severe.  Non-infectious  pneumonitis  has also been observed.  The majority  of these  
AEs have  been  of mild to moderate  severity  (CTC  grade  1-2). Overall,  the most  frequently  
observed  laboratory abnormalities  include  reduced  blood  counts  and hyperlipidemia  mostly  
reported  as hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia.  
The principal  DLT  in Phase  1 trials  has been Grade  3 stomatitis.  For guidance  on management  of 
stomatitis  refer to Section  9.3.1  
Hyperlipidemia  was reported  as a serious  adverse  reaction.  It is a recognized  side-effect  of 
rapamycins.  Use of lipid-lowering  drugs  should  be associated  with dietary  recommendations.  
Monitoring  of blood  lipid levels  requires  patients  to be fasting;  this aspect  must  be verified  when  
interpreting  results.  For guidance on management  of hyperlipidemia refer to Section  9.3.2.  
Hyperglycemia  was reported  as a serious  adverse  reaction.  Again,  the fasting  state of patients  
should  be verified  when  interpreting  results.  For guidance  on management  of hyperglycemia  
refer to Section  9.3.2.  
Pneumonitis  is a recognized  adverse  effect  of rapamycins  (sirolimus,  temsirolimus,  and 
everolimus).  Numerous  case reports  in the literature  suggest  that rapamycin -associated  
pneumonitis  is relatively  unaggressive,  limited  in extent,  and reversible  upon  drug 
discontinuation.  The term ‘pneumonitis’  is used here to describe  radiologically  evident,  non- 
infectious,  non-malignant  infiltration  in the lungs.  More  precise  diagnosis  should  come  after 
histocytological  examination  following  lung biopsy,  generally  during  bronchoscopy  which  may 
or may not be symptomatic.  Advice  on the management  of pneumonitis  has been provided  in 
Table 5. 
In oncology  studies  with Everolimus,  severe  pneumonitis  suspected  as drug-related  has been 
reported  as a serious  adverse  event  on 13 occasions.  Additionally,  it has been reported  in the 
following  associated  preferred  terms:  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome  (n=2),  alveolitis  (n=1),  
allergic  alveolitis  (n=1),  interstitial  lung disease  (n=10),  lung infiltration  (n=23),  cryptogenic  
organizing  pneumonia,  lung consolidation,  pulmonary  alvealoar  haemorrhage,  pulmonary  
toxicity,  and pulmonary  fibrosis  (n=1  each).  One fatal case of drug-related  pneumonitis  was 
reported  for a patient  with metastatic  infiltrating  ductal  carcinoma  of the breast  treated  with 10 
mg/day,  which  developed  approximately  two months  after starting  Everolimus.  Cytology  for 
both the pleural  and pericardial  fluids  were  positive  for malignancy.  The death  was considered  
possibly  related  to the underlying  late-stage  tumor  and study  drug.  Additionally,  one patient  
treated  with 10 mg/day  died due to severe  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome  and septic  shock.  
Thoracic  CT scan demonstrated  condensation  in the majority  of the left lower  lobe and frosted  
glass  appearance  in the  left upper lobe,  lingula,  and right  lung.  
Along  with the cases  of non-infectious  pneumonitis,  serious  opportunistic  infectio ns have  also 
been  reported  in cancer  patients  treated  with Everolimus:  mycobactrium,  aspergillus,  fatal 
candidal  sepsis,  and fatal pneumocystis  carnii,  in particular.  Because  Everolimus,  as other  
rapamycins,   inhibits  proliferation   of  activated   lymphocytes   and  reduces  neutrophil   counts,  
Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center  
IRB Protocol  
IRB#:  08-123 A(8) 
Amended:  03/04/15  33  
  
treatment  with Everolimus  must  be considered  as predisposing  patients  to the risk of infection.  
This risk will be higher  in patients  severely  immunocompromised  because  of their underlying  
disease and/or  co-medications.  Outcome may be fatal in case of serious  infections.  
A reduction  in blood  cell counts  is frequent  when  Everolimus  therapy  is initiated.  Infrequently  
and without  clinical  significance,  anemia  and thrombocytopenia  have  been  reported.  In heavily  
pretreated  patients  with aggressive  lymphoma,  the incidence  of grade  3 anemia,  neutropenia,  and 
thrombocytopenia was reported to be  11%,  16%, and 30%,  respectively.  Serious, suspected  drug- 
related  hemorrhages  have  been  exceptional.  Nevertheless,  Everolimus  should  be considered  as 
predisposing  patients  to hemorrhage  and potentially  fatal should they  develop  severe  drug- 
related  thrombocytopenia.  
Discrete,  reversible  changes  in liver enzymes  have been  found  to occur  in numerous  patients  
during  treatment  with Everolimus  in oncology  clinical  studies  and in a study  in rheumatoid  
arthritis.  In oncology  studies,  these  changes  may be evident  only in patients  without  severe  
underlying  morbidity.  The increase  in transaminases  (AST  and ALT)  generally  appears  after 4 
weeks  of treatment.  In all but a few cases  it does not exceed  Grade  1 (≤ 2.5 x ULN).  Similarly,  
mild increases  in alkaline  phosphatases  can coexist.  Spontaneous  corrections  or intermittent  
correction  with continued  treatment  can occur.  Serum  bilirubin  is not increased.  In studies  of 
patients  with advanced  cancers,  clinically  relevant  changes  in liver enzymes  have  been 
invariably  associated  with the presence  of liver metastases  and/or  progression  of the underlying  
cancer.  
Renal  failure  has been reported  in five suspected  cases  to date.  One patient  with no alternative  
explanation  made a complete  recovery  following study  drug adjustment  and no treatment/therapy  
for the event.  The rest of the patients  had concurrent  morbidities,  which  may have  contributed  to 
the reported  events.  
Reactivation  of Hepatitis  B (HBV)  has been observed  in patients  with cancer  receiving  
chemotherapy  (Yeo  2004).  Sporadic  cases  of Hepatitis  B reactivation  have also been seen in this 
setting  with everolimus.  Use of antivirals  during  anti-cancer  therapy  has been  shown  to reduce  
the risk of Hepatitis  B virus  reactivation  and associated  morbidity  and mortality (Loomba  2008).  
A detailed  assessment  of Hepatitis  B/C medical  history  and risk factors  must  be done  for all 
patients  at screening,  with testing  performed  prior  to the  first dose of everolimus.  
Hypophosphatemia,  hypomagnesemia,  hyponatremia,  and hypocalcemia  have  been  reported  as 
serious  adverse reactions. Electrolytes  should be  monitored  in patients  treated  with Everolimus.  
Table  4 provides  general  recommendations  for the management  of patients  with suspected  drug 
toxicities  while on treatment  with Everolimus  as single -agent  therapy.  
More  detailed  information  regarding  Everolimus,  reported  suspected  toxicities,  and individual  
cases  is provided  in the  [Investigator’s  Brochure].

12.1 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
Response  and progression  will be evaluated  in this study  using  the international  criteria  by the 
Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid Tumors  (RECIST)  Committee  [JNCI , 92(3):205 -216, 
2000].  Changes  in the largest  diameter  (uni-dimensional  measurement)  are used in the RECIST  
criteria.  Note:  lesions  are either  measurable  or non-measurable  using  the criteria  provided 
below:  
 
12.2 Definitions  
 
Measurable  lesions:  lesions  that can be accurately  measured  in at least one dimension  with 
longest  diameter ≥ 20 mm using  conventional  techniques or  ≥ 10 mm with spiral  CT scan.  
Non-measurable  lesions:  all other  lesions  (or sites of disease)  including  small  lesions  (longest  
diameter  < 20 mm with conventional  techniques  or < 10 mm using  spiral  CT scan)  are 
considered  non-measurable  disease.  Bone  lesions,  leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites,  
pleural/pericardial  effusions,  lymphangi tis cutis/pulmonis,  inflammatory  breast  disease,  
abdominal  masses  (not followed  by CT or MRI),  and cystic lesions  are all non-measurable.  
Target  lesions:  all measurable  lesions  – up to a maximum of  five lesions  per organ  and 10 lesions  
in total,  representative  of all involved  organs  – should be  identified  as target  lesions  and recorded  
and measured  at baseline.  Target  lesions  should  be selected  on the basis  of their size (lesions  
with the longest  diameter)  and their suitability  for accurate  repeated  measurements  (either  by 
imaging  techniques  or clinically).  A sum of the longest  diameter  (LD)  for all target  lesions  will 
be calculated  and reported  as the baseline  sum LD. The baseline  sum LD will be used as 
reference by which  to characterize the objective tumor  response.  
Non-target  lesions:  all other  lesions  (or sites  of disease) should be identified  as non-target  lesions  
and should  also be recorded  at baseline.  Measurements  of these  lesions  are not required,  but the 
presence or absence  of each should be  noted  throughout  follow -up. 
 
12.3 Guidelines  for evaluation  of measurable disease  
 
All measurements  should  be taken  and recorded  in metric  notation.  The same  method  of 
assessment  and the same  technique  should  be used to characterize  each identified  and reported  
lesion  at baseline and  during  follow -up.

IRB Protocol  
IRB#:  08-123 A(8) 
Amended:  03/04/15  35  
  
 
Complete  Response  
(CR):   
 
Disappearance  of all target  lesions  
 
Partial  Response  
(PR):   
At least a 30% decrease  in the sum of the LD of target  lesions,  
taking  as reference  the baseline  sum LD 
 
Progressive  
Disease  (PD):   
At least a 20% increase  in the sum of the LD of target  lesions,  
taking  as reference  the smallest  sum LD recorded  since  the 
treatment  started  or the appearance  of one or more  new lesions  
 
Stable  Disease  
(SD):   
Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to qualify  for PR nor sufficient  
increase  to qualify  for PD, taking  as reference  the smallest  sum LD 
since  the treatment  started  
 
12.4.2  Evaluation  of Non-Target Lesions  
 
 
Complete  
Response  (CR):  Disappearance   of  all  non-target   lesions   and  normalization   of 
tumor  marker  level  
Incomplete  
Response/  
Stable  Disease  
(SD):  Persistence    of   one   or   more   non-target    lesion(s)    or/and  
maintenance  of tumor  marker  level  above  the normal  limits  
Progressive  
Disease  (PD):  Appearance   of  one  or  more  new  lesions   and/or   unequivocal  
progression  of existing  non-target  lesions  (1) 
 
12.4.3  Evaluation  of Best Overall  Response  
 
The best overall  response  is the best response  recorded  from  the start of the treatment  until 
disease  progression/recurrence  (taking  as reference  for PD the smallest  measurements  recorded  
since  the treatment  started).  In general,  the patient's  best response  assignment  will depend  on the 
achievement  of both measurement  and confirmation criteria.

12.4.4  Confirmation  of Response  
 
There  will be no repeat  imaging  studies  done  solely  for the purpose  of confirming  response.  
Patients  will have  follow -up imaging  studies  as outlined  in the protocol  and responses  that are 
confirmed  on follow -up scans will be noted.  
 
12.4.5  Duration  of Overall  Response/  Progression  Free Survival  
 
The duration  of overall  response  is measured  from  the time measurement  criteria  are met for CR 
or PR (whichever  status  is recorded  first)  until the first date that recurrence  or PD is objectively  
documented,  taking  as reference  for PD the smallest  measurements  recorded  since  the treatment  
started.  
Progression  Free Survival  will be calculated  from  the start of treatment  until progressive  disease  
or death.  Patients  who die before  documented  progression  will be considered  failures  at their 
time of death.  If the patient did not progress  or die, the  patient  will be censored  on the  date of last 
follow -up. 
 
13.0    CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
 
In the absence  of treatment  delays  due to adverse  event(s),  treatment  may continue  until one of 
the following  criteria  applies:  
▪ Completion  of treatment  per protocol  
▪ Disease progression  
▪ Intercurrent  illness  that prevents  further administration  of treatment  
▪ Unacceptable  adverse event(s)  
▪ Patient  decides  to withdraw from  the study,  or 
Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center  
IRB Protocol  
IRB#:  08-123 A(8) 
Amended:  03/04/15  37  
  
▪ General  or specific  changes  in the patient’s  condition  render  the patient  unacceptable  for 
further treatment  in the  judgment  of the investigator  
▪ Inability  of subject to comply  with study  requirements  
If at anytime,  the patient  is found  to be ineligible  for the protocol  as designated  in the inclusion  
and exclusion  criteria  detailed  in Section  6.0 (i.e., a change  in diagnosis),  the patient  will be 
removed  from  the study.  
 
 
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
The purpose of this study  is to assess  the efficacy  of Everolimus  in patients  with progressive  
urothelial  cancer who  have received  prior  cytotoxic chemotherapy.  Historically,  patients in this  
setting  experience a median time  to progression  of 2-3 months (as illustrated  in Section  3.1). 
Thus,  the primary  endpoint of  this stu dy will be the proportion  of patients  who are progression - 
free after two  months on-study.  
 
The sample size and stopping  rules  will be determined according  to Simon's Minimax  two-stage  
design.  A two-month progression  free survival  rate of 50% would  be considered  not promising,  
while a 70% two-month  PFS rate would  be considered  promising.   In Stage  1 of the trial, 23 
evaluable patients will be accrued  to the  study.  If twelve  or more  patients  demonstrate  
progression  on imaging  after two  months on-study,  the study  will be terminated  early  and 
declared  to have a negative result.  If 13 or more patients are progression -free at  two months,  
enrollment  will be extended  to accrue a total of 37 patients.  If 24 or  more  patients  are 
progression -free after their two-month  scan (i.e. after Stage 2),  the treatment will be declared  
effective and  worthy  of further testing.  
 
Patients  will be  considered  inevaluable for the primary  objective (PFS  at 2 months) if they 
receive < one cycle  of protocol  therapy  and are discontinued  from  protocol  treatment for 
either rapid  clinical  deterioration  related  to progression  of disease or adverse events  
unrelated  to Everolimus.  Patients  with still be evaluable for toxicity  assessment.  
For the purposes of  this study,  the Type  I (false acceptance  of a non-promising  therapy) and   
Type  II (false rejection  of a promising  therapy)  error rates  have  been set at 0.05 and 0.20,  
respectively.  This statistical  design  would  effectively  discriminate between  two-month  PFS rates 
of <50% and  >70%  and yields  80% probability  of a positive  result  if the true two-month  PFS rate 
is >70%.  It yields  95% probability  of a negative result if  the true two -month  PFS rate is <50%.  
The probability  of early  stopping  under the null hypothesis is 66%.  
 
The secondary  endpoint  of response  rate will  be estimated  as the proportion of  patients  meeting  
the criteria outlined  in Section 3.4.2.3 for a complete  response or partial  response.  
This proportion  will be reported  along  with its binomial  confidence interval.  
 
An accrual  rate of 2-4 patients per month is anticipated,  and thus the  expected accrual  time for 
the study  will be approximately  10-20 months.

Frequency  of toxicity  will be  tabulated  according  to the NCI Common Toxicity  Criteria,  version  
3.0. 
 
Biological  markers  including  phospho -S6 and phospho -4E BP1 will be evaluated  in all pre- 
treatment  specimens.  Patients will be categorized  on the  basis  of marker levels into three  
categories:  no expression,  low expression,  or high expression.  These levels  will be correlated  
with PFS using  a log rank test and will be correlated  with response to treatment (complete  
response/partial  response  versus  no response) using Fisher’s  exact  test..

monitored  periodically  throughout  the study  period and potential  problems  will be brought  to 
the attention  of the study  team  for discussion  and action.  
 
Random -sample data quality  and protocol  compliance audits  will be conducted  by the study  
team  at a minimum of  two times  per year,  more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  were  
approved  by the National  Cancer  Institute  in September  2001.  The plans  address  the new 
policies  set forth  by the NCI in the document  entitled  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  for 
Data  and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials,”  which  can be found  at: 
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  
established  and are monitored  by the Office  of Clinical  Research.  The MSKCC  Data and Safety  
Monitoring   Plans   can  be  found   on  the  MSKCC  Intranet   at:  http://mskweb2.mskcc.org  
/irb/index.htm  
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by which  clinical  trials  are monitored  for data,  safety  and 
quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff education  on 
clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two 
institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials  
programs.  The committees,  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II 
clinical  trials  and the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  trials,  
report  to the  Center’s  Research  Council  and Institutional  Review Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development and review process, each protocol will be assessed  for its level  
of risk and degree of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  in-house  
sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will  be addressed  and the 
monitoring  procedures  will be  established  at the time of protocol  activation.  
 
16.4 Protocol  Amendments  or Changes  in Study  Contact  
 
Any change  or addition  (excluding  administrative)  to this protocol  requires  a written  protocol  
amendment  that must  be reviewed  by Novartis  and the investigator  before  implementation.  
Amendments  significantly  affecting  the safety  of subjects,  the scope  of the investigation  or the 
scientific  quality  of the study  require  additional  approval  by the IRB. A copy  of the written  
approval  of the IRB must  be provided  to Novartis.  Examples  of amendments  requiring  such 
approval  are: 
• Increases  in drug  dose or duration  of exposure  of subjects  
• Significant  changes  in the  study  design  (e.g. addition or  deletion  of a control group)  
• Increases  in the  number  of invasive procedures  
Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center  
IRB Protocol  
IRB#:  08-123 A(8) 
Amended:  03/04/15  40  
  
• Addition  or deletions  of a test procedure required  for monitoring  of safety  
These  requirements  for approval  should  in no way prevent  any immediate  action  from  being  
taken  by the investigator  or by Novartis  in the interests  of preserving  the safety  of all patients  
included  in the trial. If an immediate  change  to the protocol  is felt to be necessary  by the 
investigator  and is implemented  for safety  reasons,  Novartis  must  be notified  and the IRB at the 
center  must  be informed  immediately.  Amendments  affecting  only administrative  aspects  of the 
study  do not require  formal  protocol  amendments  or IRB approval,  but the IRB must  be kept 
informed  of such administrative  changes.  Examples  of administrative  changes  not requiring  
formal  protocol  amendments  and IRB approval  include:  
• Changes  in the  staff used to monitor  trials  
• Minor  changes  in the  packaging  or labeling  of study  drug

written  at the top of the report.  If appropriate,  the report  will be forwarded  to the FDA  by the 
SAE staff through  the IND Office  
 
17.3.2  Serious  Adverse  Event (SAE) Reporting  to Novartis  
 
The principal  investigator has  the obligation  to report  all serious  adverse events to the  FDA,  IRB,  
and Novartis  Pharmaceuticals  Clinical  Safety  and Epidemiology  Department  (CS&E).  
All events  must  be reported,  by FAX  (888-299-4565),  to Novartis  Pharmaceuticals  CS&E  
Department  within  24 hours  of learning  of it’s occurrence.  This includes  serious,  related,  
labeled  (expected)  and serious,  related,  unlabeled  (unexpected)  adverse  experiences.  All deaths  
during  treatment  or within  30 days following  completion  of active  protocol  therapy  must  be 
reported  within  5 working  days.  
Any serious  adverse  event  occurring  after the patient  has provided  informed  consent  and until 4 
weeks  after the patient  has stopped  study participation  must  be reported.  This includes  the period  
in which  the study  protocol  interferes  with the standard  medical  treatment  given  to a patient  (e.g. 
treatment  withdrawal  during  washout  period,  change  in treatment  to a fixed  dose of concomitant  
medication).  
Serious  adverse  events  occurring  more  than 4 weeks  after study  discontinuation  need only be 
reported  if a relationship  to the  Novartis  study  drug (or therapy)  is suspected.  
For Comparator  Drugs/Secondary  Suspects  (Concomitant  Medications),  all serious  adverse 
experiences  will be forwarded  to the  product manufacturer by the investigator.  
Any pregnancy  that occurs  during  study  participation  should  be reported.  To ensure  patient  
safety,  each pregnancy  must  also be reported  to Novartis  within  24 hours  of learning  of its 
occurrence.  The pregnancy  should  be followed  up to determine  outcome,  including  spontaneous

congenital  abnormalities,  or maternal  and newborn  complications.  
 
18.1 INFORMED CONSENT  PROCEDURES  
 
Before protocol -specified  procedures  are carried  out, consenting  professionals will explain full 
details  of the protocol  and study  procedures  as well as the risks involved  to participants  prior to 
their inclusion  in the  study.  Participants  will also be informed  that they are free to withdraw from  
the study  at any time.  All participants  must sign an IRB/PB -approved  consent form  indicating  
their consent  to participate.  This consent  form  meets the  requirements  of the Code  of Federal  
Regulations  and the Institutional  Review Board/Privacy  Board  of this Center.  The consent  form  
will include the following:  
1. The nature  and objectives,  potential  risks and benefits  of the intended  study.  
2. The length  of study  and the likely  follow -up required.  
3. Alternatives  to the  proposed study.  (This  will include  available standard  and 
investigational  therapies.  In addition,  patients  will be offered  an option of  
supportive care for therapeutic  studies.)  
4. The name of the investigator(s) responsible  for the protocol.  
5. The right  of the participant to accept  or refuse study  interventions/interactions  and 
to withdraw from  participation  at any time.  
Before any protocol -specific  procedures  can be  carried  out, the  consenting professional  will fully  
explain the  aspects  of patient privacy  concerning  research  specific information.   In addition to  
signing  the IRB Informed  Consent,  all patients  must agree to the  Research  Authorization

20.0     APPENDICES  
A.  Procedures  and instructions  
Publication  of results  
Any formal  presentation  or publication  of data from  this trial may be published  after review  and 
comment  by Novartis  and prior  to any outside  submission.  Novartis  must  receive  copies  of any 
intended  communication  in advance  of publication  (at least fifteen  working  days for 
presentational  materials  and abstracts  and thirty  working  days for manuscripts).  These  
requirements  acknowledge  Novartis’  responsibility  to provide  peer input  regarding  the scientific  
content  and conclusions  of such publications  or presentations.  Principal  Investigation/Institution  
shall  have the final authority  to determine  the scope  and content  of its publications,  provided  
such authority  shall  be exercised  with reasonable  regard  for the interests  of Novartis  and, in 
accord  with the trial contract  and shall not permit  disclosure  of Novartis  confidential  or 
proprietary  information.  
 
Disclosure and confidentiality  
The investigator  agrees  to keep  all information  provided  by Novartis  in strict  confidence  and to 
request  similar  confidentiality  from  his/her  staff and the IRB/IEC/REB.  Study  documents  
provided  by Novartis  (investigators'  brochures  and other  material)  will be stored  appropriately to  
ensure  their confidentiality.  The information  provided  by Novartis  to the investigator  may not be 
disclosed  to others  without  direct  written  authorization  from Novartis,  except  to the extent  
necessary  to obtain  informed  consent  from  patients who wish to participate  in the  trial. 
 
Discontinuation  of study  
Novartis  reserves  the right  to discontinue  any study  under  the conditions  specified  in the clinical  
trial agreement.  
 
Ethics  and Good  Clinical  Practice  
This study  must  be carried  out in compliance  with the protocol  and the principles  of Good  
Clinical  Practice,  as described in Novartis  standard  operating  procedures  and: 
1. ICH  Harmonized   Tripartite   Guidelines   for  Good  Clinical   Practice   1996.  Directive  
91/507/EEC,  The Rules  Governing  Medicinal  Products in the  European  Community.  
2. US 21 Code  of Federal  Regulations  dealing  with clinical  studies  (including  parts  50 and 
56 concerning  informed  consent  and IRB regulations).  
3. Declaration  of Helsinki  and amendments,  concerning  medical  research  in humans  
(Recommendations  Guiding  Physicians  in Biomedical  Research  Involving  Human  
Subjects).  
The investigator  agrees  to adhere  to the instructions  and procedures  described  in it and thereby  to 
adhere to the  principles  of Good  Clinical  Practice that it conforms  to.

Institutional  Review  Board/Independent Ethics  Committee  
Before  implementing  this study,  the protocol,  the proposed  informed  consent  form  and other  
information  to subjects,  must  be reviewed  by a properly  constituted  Institutional  Review  
Board/Independent  Ethics Committee/Research  Ethics  Board  (IRB/IEC/REB).  A signed   and 
dated  statement  that the  protocol and informed  consent have been  approved  by the IRB/IEC/REB  
must  be given  to Novartis  before  study  initiation.  Any amendments  to the protocol,  other  than 
administrative ones,  must be  reviewed  by Novartis  approved  by this committee.  
 
Informed  consent  
The investigator  must  explain  to each subject  (or legally  authorized  representative)  the nature  of 
the study,  its purpose,  the procedures  involved,  the expected  duration,  the potential  risks and 
benefits  involved  and any discomfort  it may entail.  Each  subject  must  be informed  that 
participation  in the study  is voluntary  and that he/she  may withdraw  from  the study  at any time 
and that withdrawal  of consent  will not affect  his/her  subsequent  medical  treatment  or 
relationship  with the treating  physician.  
This informed  consent  should  be given  by means  of a standard  written  statement,  written  in non- 
technical  language.  The subject  should  read and consider  the statement  before  signing and dating  
it, and should  be given  a copy  of the signed  document.  If the subject  cannot  read or sign the 
documents,  oral presentation  may be made  or signature  given  by the subject’s  legally  appointed  
representative,  if witnessed  by a person  not involved  in the study,  mentioning  that the patient  
could  not read or sign the documents.  No patient  can enter  the study  before  his/her  informed  
consent  has been obtained.  
The informed  consent  form  is considered  to be part of the protocol,  and must  be submitted  by the 
investigator with  it for IRB/IEC/REB  approval.

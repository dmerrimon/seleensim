 The Lutonix LEVANT  2 Trial Protocol Summary  
Title  A Prospective, Multicenter, Single Blind, Randomized, Controlled Trial 
Comparing the Moxy™ Drug Coated Balloon  vs. Standard Balloon Angioplasty 
for Treat ment of Femoropopliteal Arteries  ( LEVANT  2) 
Test Device  Moxy™ Drug Coated Balloon  
Control Device  Non-coated standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon catheter 
(standard PTA catheter)  
Study Design  Prospective, Multicenter, Single Blind, Randomized, Safety and Efficacy  
Overview  The study will enroll patients presenting with claudication or ischemic rest pain 
and an angiographically significant lesion in the superficial femoral or popliteal 
artery  and a patent outflow artery to the foot.  After successful protocol -defined 
pre-dilatation, subjects that are determined not to require stenting based on 
defined  angiographic criteria  are randomized 2:1 to treatment with either the 
Moxy  Drug Coated Balloon (test arm) or standard PTA cathete r (control arm). 
Subjects that do not meet post -predilatation lesion criteria are excluded (and 
treated per standard  practice ) and followed for safety for 30 days.   
Randomized subjects will have ultrasound and clinical follow -up through 2 
years and telepho ne follow -up through 5 years.  An Economic Assessment sub -
study (AMORE) will be conducted at sites in the USA.  
Purpose  To assess the safety and efficacy of the Moxy  Drug Coated Balloon  for 
treatment of stenosis or occlusion of the femoral and popliteal arteries  
Objective  To demonstrate the superior efficacy and non -inferior safety of the Moxy  Drug 
Coated Balloon  by direct comparison to standard PTA catheter for treatment of 
stenosis of  the femoropopliteal arteries  
Randomization  Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to Moxy  Drug Coated Balloon or standard 
PTA cathete r 
Enrollment  Enrollment will occur at up to 55 global centers.  
 
Approximately 750 subjects will be enrolled in order to include a total of 476 
randomized subjects.  Enrollment will be stopped once 476 subject s are 
randomized.  An additional 55 roll-in subjects may be included for site training 
purposes.  
 
Appr oximately 50% of randomized enrollment  will be in the USA .

 1 INTRODUCTION  
The purpose of this investigation is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Moxy ™ Drug Coated 
Balloon  for treatment of a stenosis or occlusion of the femoropopliteal  arteries . 
1.1 CLINICAL  BACKGROUND  
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is estimated to be present in 3% of people in the age range of 40-
59 years and in 20% of people over 70 years1 of age .  The femoropopliteal artery is the most 
commonly diseased artery in the peripheral circulation, and is the site of a larger percentage of  
lower limb interventions2.  Because of the vessel’s unique characteristics, such as significant 
shortening, elongat ion, torsion, flexion, and vulnerability to external compression, superficial 
femoral artery ( SFA) disease can be  associated with severe and life threatening complications3 and 
a very high frequency of restenoses after percutaneous intervent ion4. The Mox y Drug Coated 
Balloon may help reduce the rates of restenosis and the need for repeat endovascular or surgical 
procedures.  
Four decades after the first femoropopliteal angioplasty was performed with sequential dilators in 
19645, a durable endovascular tre atment for femoropopliteal disease is yet to be identified.  
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) has become the most common therapy, but PTA is 
challenged by a high rate of restenosis and a frequent need for reintervention; the one year patency 
of PTA without reintervention is estimated to be only 33% in a recent meta -analysis6.  Bare metal 
stents (BMS) were successful at preventing recoil and dissection, but stent outcomes in the 
femoropopliteal artery are complicated by stent fracture, and resten osis rates of BMS are as high as 
40-60% in the peripheral vasculature7.  Restenosis is caused by neointimal hyperplasia, a 
hyperproliferative response to the vessel injury caused by angioplasty and the foreign body 
reaction and abnormal vessel geometry ca used by stent implantation.  In the coronary vasculature, 
this challenge has largely been mitigated in the last decade by the introduction of drug eluting   
stents (DES).  However, in the peripheral vasculature DES have not proven as beneficial8,

 although a recent publically presented peripheral study investigating a paclitaxel coated stent has 
shown benefit over BMS9. 
The introduction of bare nitinol stents improved outcomes over PTA alone and early generation 
BMS showed a primary patency between 60 and 8 0% at one year.  The recently published 
RESILIENT study10 tested a new, flexible nitinol stent and showed a primary patency rate of 
81.3% in the stent group vs. 36.7% in the PTA group. Provisional nitinol stent implantation has 
become the worldwide standard -of-care in the SFA in cases where PTA results are subop timal 
(e.g. flow limiting dissection, severe recoil, or unacceptable residual stenosis).  Provisional 
stenting is designated as a ‘class IIa’ recommendation per the most recent 2005 ACC/AHA 
guideline for management of peripheral artery disease11.   
Stent o utcomes in the femoropopliteal artery are complicated by the vessel’s unique physiologic 
characteristics and possibility of stent fracture, and restenosis remains a clinical challenge. In 
addition, implantation of a stent can complicate and limit the treat ment choices available to the 
patient in the event repeat intervention or surgery becomes necessary.  
A novel  therapy that is commercially available in some countries and under investigation in others 
is the drug coated balloon (DCB), an otherwise standard  PTA catheter with a drug coating on the 
balloon surface.  During angioplasty, DCBs are designed to deliver an anti -proliferative drug 
directly to tissues of the treated vessel wall, thus inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis 
without the need fo r a permanent foreign body implant.  The investigational device of the present 
study, the Moxy  Drug Coated Balloon , is one example  of a DCB.   
To date, two pilot European clinical trials for treatment of femoropopliteal arteries have been 
performed by anoth er manufacturer to assess their drug coated balloons using the Paccocath® 
technology .  The Paccocath coating contains the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) –
paclitaxel  - as in the Lutonix drug coating , but a different carrier (iopromide).  This s ame API is 
currently used in some manufacturers ’ approved drug eluting stents.  Both studies have

 demonstrated preliminary safety and decreased restenosis of the femoropopliteal lesions in the 
context of standard -of-care stenting.  Both the THUNDER12 and F emPac13 studies were 
prospective, randomized, controlled, multi -center clinical trials that compared the Paccocath 
coated DCB to control PTA with provisional stenting allowed in both arms.  Subject  characteristics 
were similar in both studies, however over all lesion lengths were notably shorter in the FemPac 
trial.  In both studies, DCB -treated subjects had significantly less late lumen loss (the primary 
endpoint), less restenosis, and a lower rate of reintervention ( target lesion revascularization (TLR) ) 
at 6 months than those treated with control PTA.  The potential benefit of DCB demonstrated by 
these pilot studies is tabulated in the Table 1.

The results of these two early pilot studies suggest that local delivery of paclitaxel by a DCB 
directly to tissues of the diseased vessel wall is safe and effective as a treatment for 
femoropopliteal stenosis.   
1.1.1 THE LEVANT  I FIRST-IN-MAN TRIAL SUMMARY  
The LEVANT I trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  is a trial which compared femoropopliteal treatment with the 
Moxy Drug Coated Balloon to a standard PTA catheter (with and without stenting) with a primary 
endpoint of late lumen loss. One hundred -one randomized subjects ha ve been enrolled at 9 
European centers.  After a defined pre -dilatation, subjects were stratified to the balloon strata or 
stent strata and then randomized to treatment with the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon or a standard 
PTA catheter (control group).  Subject inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to previous

 femoropopliteal studies, with lesion length of 4 -15 cm and vessel diameter 4 -6 mm.  Subject 
demographics, baseline lesion characteristics, Rutherford Category, device, and procedural success 
were si milar between arms.  The Moxy Drug Coated Balloon showed safety at 30 days compared 
to control with no unanticipated adverse device effects, similar adverse event rates and no reports 
of thrombus in the DCB arm.   
At 6 months, clinical follow up compliance was 91%, and 74% and subjects underwent protocol 
defined repeat angiography.  Major 6 -month angiographic and clinical endpoint results are listed in 
Table 2 for the intent -to-treat (ITT) population (n=101) and in Table 3 by stratification group.

In the ITT population, the primary endpoint of mean late lumen loss at 6 months was significantly 
lower in the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon arm (0.46±1.13) compared to the PTA arm (1.09±1.07), 
with a p value of 0.016, consistent with efficacy of Moxy Drug Coated Balloon for this indication.  
The difference in mean late loss between arms was also significant in the balloon -only 
stratification group (0.45±1.18 vs. 1.19±1.15, p=0.024).   
The Moxy Drug Coated Balloon demonstrated safety comparable to c onventional PTA  in the 
LEVANT I Trial, with similar AE and SAE rates through 6 months.  There were no unanticipated

 adverse device effects in the drug -coated balloon arm, and overall adverse event rates were similar 
to conventional uncoated balloon angiopla sty. Secondary clinical endpoints trended in favor of the 
Moxy Drug Coated Balloon arm, particularly TLR (12.8% vs. 22.2% in PTA arm) and target 
vessel revascularization (TVR) (12.8% vs. 32.6%).  
As part of a pharmacokinetics sub -study, s erum paclitaxel le vels were collected and analyzed in 7 
Moxy Drug Coated Balloon  subject s.  All subjects had detectable serum paclitaxel  immediately 
after the index procedure, with a mean maximum concentration C max = 58.4±83.2 ng/mL.  Mean 
total exposure AUC all = 73.2±45.3 ng*h/mL. The mean residence time (from index procedure to 
the last measurable concentration) of paclitaxel in serum M RT last = 5.64±4.56 hours.  
In summary, 6 -month results demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the use of the 
Moxy Drug Coated Balloon for treatment of femoropopliteal lesions, with a significantly improved 
late lumen loss and similar adverse events rates as compared t o PTA through 6 -months.   
1.2 DEVICE  AND  STUDY  RATIONALE  
The Moxy Drug Coated Balloon is indicated for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of 
obstructive de novo or non -stented restenotic lesions in native femoropopliteal arteries ≤15 cm in 
length and >4.0 to <6.0 mm in diameter.  
The drug coating on the Moxy  Drug Coated Balloon  contains paclitaxel and excipients  (drug 
carrier)  with a history of human safety for intravenous use.  Each component has been safely used 
in other products.  PTA catheters have been in commercial use for over 25 years, and the Moxy  
Drug Coated Balloon  meets international standards (e.g. ISO 10555) developed over time to 
validate the mechanical safety of dilation catheters. The anti -proliferative drug paclitaxel  is a well 
understood active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API) with an extensive history of human use in 
oncology14 and drug -eluting stents (DES)15.  The maximum total dose o f 3.8 mg on the largest 
peripheral Moxy  Drug Coated Balloon  is less than 2% of the d ose of a pproximately  300mg infused 
during a single course of cancer therapy. In addition, GLP animal Safety and Safety Margin studies 
have been performed to confirm the safety of the Moxy  Drug Coated Balloon .

Prior to start of study enrollment , Lutonix or their designee  will perform formal device training for 
study site personnel and support staff.  Each study site will receive a supply of the Moxy Drug 
Coated Balloons  upon completion of the protocol requirements for study initiation.  Additional 
training and support wil l be provided  as needed  on an ongoing basis.   Any unused devices  must be 
returned to the sponsor at the time site enrollment stops or upon sponsor request.  After use, this 
product may be a potential biohazard.  Handle and dispose of in accordance with acc eptable 
medical practices and applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations.   For quality control 
purposes, devices may be requested to be returned to the sponsor before or after use, in which case 
the site should return devices by following the  Return Material Authorization (RMA) instructions 
located in the study binder.  
4 RISK -BENEFIT  ANALYSIS  
4.1 POTENTIAL  RISKS  
The potential risks and benefits of participation in this study are clearly identified in the  subject 
Informed Consent Form (ICF) and are to be explained to the subject  and/or their legal 
representative prior to participating in the study.  The Moxy Drug Coated Balloon  and standard 
uncoated percutaneous angioplasty catheters are intended to be the only devices used for treatment 
of the target lesion.   
Due to the high similarity of the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon  to other marketed balloon catheters, 
procedural use is not expected to significantly change or increase risks during the initial procedure.  
However, it shares the risks of conventional  balloon  angioplasty treatment of patients with 
femoropopliteal disease. There may also be risks associated with the drug coating on the Moxy 
Drug Coated Balloon  that are unknown at this time.  Please refer to the Investi gator ’s Brochure for 
more details on the development of the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon . 
4.1.1 RISKS FOR PERIPHERAL CATHETERIZATION PROCEDURE  
Potential adverse events which may be associated with a peripheral balloon dilatation 
catheterization procedure include, bu t are not limited to, the following:  
• abnormal heart rhythms  
• abrupt vessel closure  
• allergic reaction  
• aneurysm or rupture of the artery

 • AV fistula  
• bleeding  
• death  
• dissection  
• embolization  
• femoral nerve compression with associated neuropathy  
• groin area bruising  and discomfort  
• hematoma  
• infection  
• kidney failure  
• low blood pressure  
• perforation  
• pseudoaneurysm  
• respiratory failure  
• stroke  
• total occlusion or thrombosis  
• vessel trauma that may require re -intervention or surgical repair  
There may be other potential adverse events that are unforeseen at this time.  
Even if the balloon catheter  procedure is deemed successful, it is associated with a meaningful risk 
of vessel narrowing within 12 months (depending on risk factors).  Additional therapy may be 
required with in 12 months such as re -intervention using angioplasty or surgery.   
Patients undergoing an interventional procedure are often treated with courses  of thienopyridines 
such as c lopidogrel  or prasugrel,  which may cause thrombocytopenic purpura and /or bleedin g 
complications.   In rare cases, these drugs may cause a significant reduction in white blood cell 
count, which may in turn result in serious infections.  Aspirin is also a common drug used before 
and after such procedures.  Aspirin is known to contribute occasionally to causing gastrointestinal 
ulcers (bleeding or non -bleeding).   Aspirin may also affect platelet function to the extent of 
causing bleeding complications (which may be minor, major, or life threatening).  If such 
conditions occur, the patient may require surgery, blood transfusion, or platelet transfusion.   
Any of the above could cause prolonged illness, permanent impairment of daily function or, in rare 
cases, death. Possible treatments could include, but are not limited to emergency PTA and vascular 
surgery.  It is expected that the fluoroscopy time of the interventional procedure will be similar to 
the time required for conventional percutaneous lower extremity interventional procedures and not 
pose additional risks to the subject  or lab personnel.

26 March 2012  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 71 
 4.1.2 ASSOCIATED RISKS FROM THE DRUG COATING  
The balloon coating includes the API paclitaxel and small amounts of well known excipients  (drug 
carrier) that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as inactive ingredients in 
drug products for intravenous (IV) drug delivery. A dditional adverse events that may be unique to 
the paclitaxel drug coating include:   
• allergic/immunologic reaction  
• alopecia  
• anemia  
• blood p roduct transfusion  
• gastrointestinal symptoms  
• hematologic dyscrasia (including leu kopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)  
• hepatic enzyme changes  
• histologic changes in vessel wall, including inflammation, cellular damage or necrosis  
• myalgia/ arthralgia  
• periph eral neuropathy  
There may be other risks associated with the drug coating that are unknown at this time.   
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies published in pregnant women or men intending 
to father children who have received paclitaxel in either the test or control device.  Studies 
performed in rats and rabbits receiving IV paclitaxel during organogenesis revealed evidence of 
maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and fetotoxicity at dosages of 1 and 3 mg/kg, respectively 
(approximately 3 and 16 t imes the dose provided by the largest Moxy Drug Coated Balloon - 
coated with 3.8 mg of paclitaxel adjusted for body surface area ). The  drug resulted in increased 
resorptions and increased fetal deaths.  No teratogenicity was observed in gravid rats receivin g 
daily IV paclitaxel doses of 1 mg/kg (a daily dose of approximately 3 times the dose of the largest 
Moxy Drug Coated Balloon, adjusted for body surface area).  Use of the test or control devices in 
women who are of childbearing potential or in men intend ing to father children should therefore 
take reproductive risk into careful consideration.  
4.2 RISK  MANAGEMENT  PROCEDURES  
Eligibility criteria have been selected that exclude patients who are at a higher risk for 
experiencing an anticipated adverse event in or der to reduce the risks to subject s who participate in 
this study.  In addition, subject s enrolled in this study will receive a defined anti -platelet regime n 
and are required to follow the pre -specified clinical follow -up schedule described in Section 7.  In 
addition, follow -up duplex ultrasound will be performed to assess the target vessel patency, and all 
adverse events are formally monitored and independently adjudicated.  
Extensive reliability engineering testing has been performed on the Moxy Drug Coate d Balloon  to 
help mitigate any risks to the subject s due to product failure.  Additionally, animal studies using 
LEVANT 2 Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0002 -01                                                                                                                                   Revision: 0 8 
 
26 March 2012  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 71 
 the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon have been conducted to ensure that the device performs as 
intended without introducing more risks during the inter ventional procedure.  
Investigational device training will be conducted at each initiated study center and appropriate 
training records will be maintained.  
4.3 POTENTIAL  BENEFITS  
There are no guaranteed benefits from participation in this study; however, it is possible that 
treatment with the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon  may reduc e the potential for restenosis  of the 
lesion, thereby reducing the need for repeat hospitalization and/or p rocedure(s).  
Additionally, information gained from the conduct of this study may be of benefit to others with 
the same medical condition. As with all investigational medical devices, the long -term results of 
using the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon  are not known at the prese nt time. Alternatives to the use of 
the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon  include standard  or cutting  balloon angioplasty, vascular stenting, 
atherectomy, cryoplasty, or vascular radiation and surgery  (vessel bypass with native or synthetic 
vessel) .  Lutonix believ es that the risk for significant injury or death due to the Moxy Drug Coated 
Balloon is extremely low, and the potential benefits of decreased restenosis and decreased need for 
reintervention is likely, but these potential risks and benefits have yet to be  quantified.  
4.4 EARLY  TERMINATION  
Lutonix, Inc. ( Sponsor ) and the Data Monitoring Committee  (DMC ) will monitor the progression 
of the study.  If warranted, the study may be suspended or discontinued early if there is an 
observation of serious adverse reaction s presenting an unreasonable risk to the study population.   
The Sponsor may terminate Investigator and site participation in the study for issues including but 
not limited to the following issues:  
• Evidence of an Investigator’s failure to maintain adequate  clinical standards  
• Evidence of an Investigator or staff’s failure to comply with the protocol  
• Inaccuracy or late submission of data forms and core lab images  
• Inability to meet enrollment targets (1.5 subjects/month)  
• Conditions of approval imposed by the reviewing IRB/EC and/or regulatory 
agencies  
• Evidence of safety concerns or protocol non -compliance  
• Change of staff at site that adversely impacts trial conduct   
Any evident pattern of non -compliance with respect to these standards will be cause for the si te to 
be put on probation.  If corrective actions are not subsequently undertaken, the clinical site will be 
asked to withdraw from the study and their site may be replaced  
Notification of suspension or termination will occur no later than five (5) working  days after the 
Sponsor  makes the determination.  In the event of study suspension or termination, the Sponsor  
LEVANT 2 Investigational Plan

26 March 2012  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 71 
 will send a report outlining the circumstances to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics 
Committee (EC), and all Investigator s and Regulatory Authorities as required by regulation .  A 
suspended or terminated study may not be reinitiated without approval of the reviewing  IRB/EC 
and Regulatory Authorities, as required by regulation . 
The Investigator must notify the IRB/EC in writin g as soon as possible but no later than within 10 
days if the premature termination is related to safety or compliance issues.  
5 CLINICAL  STUDY  DESIGN    
The study will enroll subject s presenting with claudication or ischemic rest pain and an 
angiographicall y significant lesion in the superficial femoral or popliteal artery  and a patent 
outflow artery to the foot.   After successful protocol -defined pre -dilatation, subject s that are 
unlikely to require a stent based on strict angiographic criteria (absence of major flow -limiting 
dissection from the lumen and ≤70% residual stenosis  or the lesion is not appropriate for stenting 
due to proximity to the knee joint ) are randomized 2:1 to treatment with either the Moxy  Drug 
Coated Balloon  (test arm) or standard PTA c atheter (control arm).   
Subject s that do not meet post -predilatation criteria are excluded (and treated per standard practice ) 
and followed for safety  only (via telephone or clinical  follow up)  for 30 days.  Randomized 
subjects will have ultrasound and cl inical follow -up through 2 years and  telephone follow -up 
through 5 years. There is no pre -set limit to site enrollment, however site enrollment will be 
tracked and managed to ensure approximately 50% of the overall randomized enrollment occurs at 
US sites.

5.1 SCREENING  PROCEDURES  
All patients admitted for a percutaneous revascu larization of a femoropopliteal artery should be 
screened for study eligibility.  If inclusion criteria are met and no exclusion criteria are present at 
the time of screening, the patient should be entered into a study Screening Log.  Once the patie nt’s 
eligibility has been determined, the Investigator  will discuss the study and ask the patient to 
participate.  Prior to enrollment, the patient must sign the informed consent form approved for use 
by the IRB/EC  or other appropriate committee.  A copy of  the signed and dated Informed Consent 
will be provided to the subject .  Subject s will be assured that they may withdraw from the study at 
any time and for any reason.   The background and purpose of the study , participation 
requirements,  as well as the pot ential benefits and risks of the procedure(s) must  be explained to 
the subject .

26 March 2012  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 71 
 The status of all patients screened, whether enrolled, withdrawn, etc., should be captured on the 
study Screening Log for tracking and reporting purposes.    
If not already pe rformed as standard practice, t he following assessments and tests must be 
performed after obtaining informed consent and prior to the index procedure (within 30 days 
unless otherwise noted ) to verify and complete eligibility:  
• Physical examination  (including blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature) 
performed by either an MD, Physician’s Assistant, or Nurse Practitioner  
• Relevant  medical history  
• Rutherford Classification  
• Blood analysis  
o CBC  with differential  (hemoglobin, hematocrit, pla telets and leukocytes ) 
(differential: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and basophils)  
o CMP  
▪ Glucose  
▪ Calcium  
▪ Protein (albumin, TP)  
▪ Electrolytes (bicarbonate, chloride, sodium, potassium)  
▪ Kidney (BUN, creatini ne) 
▪ Liver (ALP, ALT, AST, bilirubin)   
o Pregnancy Test (blood or urine; if female of child bearing potential)  
• Resting Ankle -Brachial Index  (ABI) (within 90 days)  
• Walking Impairment Questionnaire  
• EQ5D and SF -36-v2 Questionnaires  
• Six Minute Walk Test  
5.2 PATIENT  SELECTION  FOR  ENROLLMENT  
Subjects must  meet all the clinical eligibility criteria, agree to participate and comply with study 
protocol requirements and follow -up schedule, and provide informed consent.  
All subject s are expected to remain available (geographically stable) for the duration of th e study 
follow -up period. If any subject  moves away, every effort must be made to maintain the follow -up 
schedule including having an appropriate physician follow the subject .  The Investigator  is 
responsible for ensuring that each follow -up visit occurs a t the specified time and that all 
applicable data is reviewed and entered into the electronic case report form system (eCRF) in a 
timely fashion.  
5.2.1 ROLL-IN SUBJECTS AND CASE PROCTORING REQUIREMENTS  
After site initiation, each site must perform a proctored Mo xy Drug Coated Balloon procedure 
prior to enrolling subjects in the randomized portion of the trial.   This is intended to train site 
LEVANT 2 Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0002 -01                                                                                                                                   Revision: 0 8 
 
26 March 2012  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 71 
 personnel in proper procedur e and data collection.  All roll -in subjects must meet all protocol 
requirements (including enr ollment criteria and follow -up) and the sponsor (or designee) must be 
in attendance for training purposes.   A subject (s) who was proactively designated as a roll -in, but 
subsequently treated per the standard practice  arm (i.e. not treated with the Moxy Dru g Coated 
Balloon) is not considered a roll-in. The roll -in subjects will be analyzed separately from the 
randomized cohort.   Based on a total of 55 sites, a maximum of 55 of roll -in subjects is expected.  
Some centers may have more than one investigator pe rforming the study procedure; each 
investigator enrolling in the study must undergo formal Moxy procedure proctoring with a sponsor 
representative (or designee) during their initial study case(s).  The sponsor reserves the right to 
limit the number of inve stigators performing the study procedure at a site and can expand case 
proctoring requirements as necessary to ensure compliance.

6 STUDY/TREATMENT  PROCEDURES  
6.1 ENROLLMENT  
A subject is c onsidered enrolled in the study after both of the following steps have occurred:  
• Baseline angiographic confirmation that the target lesion meets all appropriate 
inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
• Defined  pre-dilatation balloon inflation has begun.  
All subject s enrolled  and randomized  in the trial will be followed for t he entire duration of the 
study and included in the ITT  analysis. Subjects  that do not meet post -predilation criteria are 
enrolled , but not randomized , and treated per standard practice  and followe d for safety for 30 days  
via telephone or clinical visit.  Subject s with target lesions that , after baseline angiography , do not 
meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria and are not pre -dilated per protocol are considered screen 
failures  and will not be enroll ed or randomized in the study.  
6.2 MOXY  DRUG  COATED  BALLOON  INSTRUCTIONS  FOR  USE  (IFU)  
Always follow the current IFU packaged with the device for procedural information, preparation  
and use  of the  Moxy Drug Coated Balloon .  Any devices found to be defective or that do not 
perform as expected should be returned immediately to the Sponsor  for evaluation and a Device 
Malfunction Form  must  be completed.  
A balloon compliance chart is included on each device product label.   
If more than one Moxy Drug Coated Balloon will be needed to treat the entire pre -dilated 
segment(s)/lesion(s), the combination of lengths available should be carefully considered 
before hand to ensure complete coverage of the target lesions (within the maximum length of 
LEVANT 2 Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0002 -01                                                                                                                                   Revision: 0 8

 15cm) and, at the same time, reduce unnecessary vessel dilatation.  The IFU also contains detailed 
information on lesion coverage and minimal inflation times.  
6.3 BASELINE  ANG IOGRAM  
DSA - or Cine - angiograms should be obtained per core lab guideline .  Standard off -line QVA 
acquisition procedures will be followed for analysis at the independent Imaging Core Laboratory. 
All angiography procedures (both index  and non -scheduled) mus t be recorded in such a way that 
they are suited for off -line QVA.  For purposes of ensuring protocol compliance, all angiograms 
must be submitted to the core laboratory as soon after the case as possible.  
6.4 IN-FLOW  LESION  TREATMENT  
Absence of inflow disease  (≥50% stenosis) as confirmed by angiography is required for enrollment 
in the study. Enrollment is allowed following complete successful treatment per standard practice 
of inflow artery lesions, with successful treatment defined as attainment of a residua l diameter 
stenosis ≤30% without death  or major vascular complication.  
6.5 PRE -DILATATION  
Always refer to the current IFU packaged with the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon for complete pre -
dilatation requirements.  
Lesion (s) pre-dilatation(s) is required for all (test and control) patients.  The predilatation balloon 
should be a standard PTA balloon inflated to a diameter approximately 1 mm less than the 
reference vessel diameter (RVD).  Always limit the longitudinal length o f the pre -dilatation 
balloon to avoid creating a region of vessel injury that is outside the boundaries of the area to be 
treated by the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon (i.e. geographical miss). In order to reduce dissections 
and potential subject allocation to t he standard practice arm after pre -dilatation, careful and 
controlled pre -dilatation (s) inflations should be performed and recorded  (on film) .  
See Table 5 for an overview of lesion assessment. If, after pre -dilatation, the lesion site  has a major 
flow-limiting dissection  or residual stenosis >70% , the subject will not be randomized but is 
instead treated per institutional standard practice.  Nonrandomiz ed subjects excluded after pre -
dilatation will be followed for 30 days for safety and then withdrawn.

6.6 RANDOMIZATION  
If after pre -dilatation(s) , patients are determined to meet the criteria for randomization, they will be 
randomized using a pre -specified site randomization system. Subject s will be randomized in a 2:1 
fashion  to Test (Moxy Drug Coated Balloon) or Control (standard PTA catheter), see  
Figure 3.     
6.6.1 TREATMENT WITH STANDARD PTA  CATHETER (CONTROL ) 
For subjects randomized to the control arm, a treatment with an uncoated standard PTA catheter 
will be performed following the Investigator’s standard procedure for such a treatment and 
utilizing a locally approved, standard off -the-shelf PTA balloon. Use of embolic capture 
angioplasty balloons or cutting/scoring balloons is not allowed.  
The Investigator should determine the appropriate size of the balloon to be used by visual 
assessment . The Investigator  should use an uncoated balloo n of similar length and diameter to the 
Moxy Drug Coated Balloon  to ensure similarity of treatment between test and control arms.  
6.6.2 TREATMENT WITH MOXY  DRUG COATED BALLOON  (TEST) 
Please refer to the current Moxy Drug Coated Balloon IFU for detailed informati on on device use.  
The Investigator should determine the appropriate size of the balloon to be used by online QVA (if 
possible) or by visual estimate.  The Moxy Drug Coated Balloon should extend at least 5 mm 
proximally and distally of the pre -dilatation segment .  Care should be taken not to extend the entire 
injury segment unnecessarily.  
6.7 POST  TREATMENT  AND  PROVISIONAL  (BAILOUT)  STENTING  PROCEDURES  
The rate of provisional (i.e. bailout) stenting in prior SFA clinical trials, including those 
investigating drug coat ed balloons, has varied considerably.  In particular, a discrepancy has been 
noted in bailout rates between control and treatment arms.  This discrepancy is likely attributable 
to investigator bias that the control arm is less likely to succeed and thus th e threshold for stenting 
LEVANT 2 Investigational Plan  
Document: CL0002 -01                                                                                                                                   Revision: 0 8

 test-device treated subjects is lower.  There is no consensus or established objective criteria that 
are validated regarding the appropriate threshold for provisional SFA stenting.  In the absence of 
an established threshold, the d etermination to bailout has previously been based on criteria that are 
either subjective or largely left to the discretion of the individual operator and his/her judgment.  
The current trial design is intended to minimize the need for bailout stenting; imba lance in bailout 
stenting between treatment arms could influence the outcome of the study.  Due to the importance 
of equal treatment between test and control groups, plus the need within the medical community to 
establish validated criteria for provisional  stenting, this trial will utilize more rigorous criteria for 
bailout stenting.  Specifically, the trial will employ the additional requirement of a pressure 
gradient measurement to document an unsatisfactory balloon -only outcome (obtained by 
measuring pre ssures proximal and distal to the lesion simultaneously).  The minimum pressure 
gradient threshold for bailout stenting ( Table 6) has been established by consulting a  number of 
experts who have extensive experience with SFA intervention, some of whom utilize pressure 
gradients routinely in their practices.  Requiring confirmation of a baseline pressure gradient prior 
to stenting establishes objective criteria that must  be met for bailout stenting (and should reduce 
the rate in this study).   
TABLE 6: PROVISIONAL (BAILOUT ) CRITERIA  
Bailout Prevention  
 Treatment requirement prior to bailout stenting:  
• Prolonged (>2 minutes) balloon inflation(s)  
• Vasodilators and/or thrombolytic agents per investigator discretion  
Bailout Criteria  
• Residual stenosis of  >50%  (based on careful in -lab review of angiograms including QVA if 
available)  or  major flow -limiting dissection  (Record angiography in 2 orthogonal views)  
and 
• Documented translesional pressure gradient of >20mmHg ( using ≤4F end-hole catheter) or 
>10mmHg (pressure wire)  measured immediately distal to the target lesion  
These criteria are set as the minimum  baseline pressure gradient requirement for allowing bailout 
stenting; however, bailout stenting is not required for pressu res equal to or exceeding these 
thresholds (i.e. presence of a gradient at/above these thresholds does not require that the operator 
place a stent).  Rather, these thresholds are seen as minimum requirements for bailout stenting; 
below these thresholds, ba ilout stenting is not allowed . 
If the criteria for bailout stenting are fulfilled, placement of a bare nitinol stent approved by the 
FDA for use in the SFA is allowed.  T he physician should use the shortest stent possible to treat 
only the clinically signi ficant dissection or residual stenosis and not the e ntire target lesion. 
Antiplatelet therapy should be prescribed per the stent manufacturer’s IFU .

 The angiographic core lab and study steering committee will be monitoring cases of bailout 
stenting through out the course of enrollment for compliance to provisional (bailout) criteria listed 
in this section.  
6.8 UNSCHEDULED  ANGIOGRAPHY/REVASCULARIZATION  
A DUS is required prior to any subsequent angiography of the index limb, and the images must be 
submitted to the  DUS Core Lab.  In the event that a subject undergoes repeat angiography after the 
index procedure is complete, all subsequent angiograms for the index limb or, in the event of an 
index limb revascularization, all procedural angiograms must be forwarded to  the Angiographic 
Core Lab for review and analysis.  Attempts should be made to record the same views and angles 
as from the index procedure.  Treatment of any new non -target lesions is left to the discretion of 
the Investigator however, use of drug -device  combination products (e.g. DES or DCB) is not 
recommended within 90 days of the index procedure .

7.1 BLINDING  PLAN  
In order t o minimize the introduction of bias into the study, a pre -specified blinding plan has been 
developed.  All Duplex Ultrasound operators, core lab evaluators , and members of the Clinical 
Events Committee (CEC) will be blinded to the subject’s treatment assignment.  B oth the  subject 
as well as the investigator conducting the follow -up visit will be blinded to treatment until the 
completion of the 12 month visit. Blinding procedures  will be reviewed at the time of each site 
initiation by a sponsor representative.   Blinding procedures and instructions are as follows:  
Time point  Blinding Procedure  
Informed Consent/  
Pre-Procedure  During review of the study and the informed consent process with the patient, 
blinding procedures, timelines and rationale should be discussed with the 
subject and any care takers.  
Randomization  Communication to the Investigator performing the procedure as to the 
randomized treatment should be done  in such a way as to prevent the subject 
from overhearing which group they have been allocated to. Hand signals, 
written codes, scripts or headphones can all be employed to ensure the subject 
remains blinded.   Each site must develop a system that best work s with lab 
work flow.  
Post-Procedure  It is important that recovery and hospital/clinic staff is educated to the protocol 
blinding requirements and that the subject and care taker are not inadvertently 
unblinded during the recovery period.  In addition, t he medical record should 
clearly identify the subject as a study participant and the type of treatment 
should be kept confidential.  
Follow -up The one month (if clinical visit), 6 and 12 month follow -up visits must be 
performed by a blinded site investigat or.  If only a single interventional 
investigator exists at any one site, an additional site sub -investigator qualified 
to conduct follow up assessments for this population (physician, nurse 
practitioner, physician assistant, etc.)  should be appointed to conduct the 
blinded study related follow -up visits prior to any standard follow up, if 
applicable, with the interventional investigator .  The clinical status of the 
subject (for assessment of clinical and primary safety endpoints) should be 
established pri or to performing the required DUS (for assessment of the 
primary efficacy endpoint).  
Unblinding  A subject may not become unblinded prior to the completion of the 12 month 
follow up unless it should become medically necessary as determined by the 
investigator.    
7.2 MEDICATIONS  
Table 7 displays the required medication regimen for this study. All medications administered will 
be recorded in the subject’s medical record.  These medication and schedules are consistent with 
LEVANT 2 Investigational Plan

 standard hospital practice.  Details of each requirement can be found in the sections below. In 
subjects ≥75 years of age and/or <60kg, prasugrel is generally not recommended because of the 
increased risk of fatal and intracranial bleeding and uncertain benef it, except in high -risk situations 
(diabetes or history of prior MI) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be 
considered.  Always refer to the current package insert.

***Ticlodipine  use per label  is an acceptable alternative only if neither  Clopidogrel  nor P rasugel are appropriate  
7.2.1 PRE-PROCEDURE  
Subjects  that are already taking daily chronic aspirin therapy should receive a  dose of 75-325 mg  
aspirin  within 24 hours prior to the index procedure .  Those subjects not already taking daily 
chronic aspirin therapy should be given at least 300 mg aspirin at least 2 hours and preferably 24 
hours before the procedure is performed.  
If the subject  is known to be receiving a stent for a non-target lesion  (i.e. inflow lesion) , it is 
suggested  that 3 days before the intervention clopidogrel (75 mg per day) or prasugrel (10 mg per 
day) be prescribed. The initial loading dose of clopidogrel or prasugrel should attempt  to be started 
prior to the index procedure, but must occur no later than 2 hours after the completion of the index 
procedure.  
7.2.2 INTRA -PROCEDURE  
All subject s must receive adequate anticoagula tion according to hospital standard practice.  
7.2.3 POST-PROCEDURE  
Approved vascular closure devices are allowed.  Clopidogrel (75 mg/daily ) or prasugrel (5 -10 
mg/daily) must be prescribed for at least 1 month, unless a stent is placed, in which case 
antiplatel et therapy should be prescribed per the stent manufacturer’s IFU.  Updated guidelines 
will be implemented via note -to-file if changes in the recommended doses occur.

 7.3 STANDARD  TESTS,  PROCEDURES,  AND  FOLLOW -UP 
Table 8 displays the required schedule for randomized subject  treatment and evaluation.  This 
schedule is consistent with standard clinical care pre - and post -interventional procedures.  T he 
times for each test are broad enough to fit into most hospital routine testing procedures.  
Subjects enrolled , but not randomized , and treated per standard practice will be followed for safety 
through 30 days. The 30 day follow -up visit can be performed  as a telephone or clinical visit.  
Duplex ultrasound  imaging is not a protocol requirement for this group.  Details of each testing 
requirement can be found in the sections below.

At 6, 12, and 24 month follow -up visits, the clinical status of the subject (for assessment of clinical 
and safety endpoints) should be established prior to performing the required DUS (for assessment 
of paten cy).  
 
7.3.1 TESTING  
7.3.1.1   LABORATORY TESTING   
Laboratory samples must be drawn pre -procedure , post -procedure,  and at the 6 and 12 -month 
clinical visits.  All laboratory values must be recorded on the appropriate study eCRFs.  Pre -
procedure samples may be taken up t o 30 days prior to the index procedure.  
Laboratory test reporting requirements include:  
• CBC  with differential  (hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets and leukocytes ) 
(differential: neutrophils, lymphocytes , monocytes and basophils)  
• CMP  
o Glucose  
o Calcium  
o Protein (HSA, TP)  
o Electrolytes (bicarbonate, chloride, sodium, potassium)  
o Kidney (BUN, creatinine)  
o Liver (ALP, ALT, AST, bilirubin)  
• Pregnancy Test (blood or urine; if female of child bearing potential)  
7.3.1.2  PHARMACOKINETIC TESTING  
In a subset of approximately 30 subjects treated with  the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon at selected 
sites in the USA, small amounts of blood (2 vials per sample) will be collected for 
pharmacokinetic ( PK) testing  (blood paclitaxel level analysis) during the index hospitalization and 
at the s tudy required 1 month follow -up visit .  Blood collection will occur at the time points shown 
in Table 9.  Efforts should be made to include only those subjects  who will be available to provide 
all scheduled samples .  Detailed PK collection instructions and materials will be provided to select 
sites by the PK core laboratory.  These subjects may have a 4F venous sheath inserted at the time 
of procedure an d left in situ until all blood tests are completed to provide for additional subject 
comfort.  Any subjects receiving a drug -eluting/coated stent within 12 months prior or during the 
index procedure cannot be included in the PK testing .  All Moxy Drug Coat ed Balloons used to 
treat patients undergoing PK testing will be returned to Lutonix after the procedure for analysis.

will be instructed that sampling is random.  Subjects that are participating in the PK study must 
have their 1 month visit conducted as a clini cal visit in order to obtain the final PK sample.  
7.3.1.3  ANKLE -BRACHIAL INDEX (ABI)  
A resting ABI must be performed per local hospital standard, and consistently among subjects over 
the lifespan of the study.

Rutherford classification can be me asured with or without treadmill, but must be performed 
consistently among subjects over the lifespan of the study.  
7.3.1.5  SIX MINUTE WALK TEST  
For subject s with no confounding  health issues that would complicate the test ( e.g. respiratory, 
cardiac, orthopedic impairments ), a six minute walk test will be performed.  
See Appendix C for detailed Walk Test  information.  
7.3.1.6  WALKING IMPAIRMENT QUESTIONNAIRE  
The WIQ form will be completed at pre -procedure and at 6, 12 and 24 months.  
See Appendix D for the questi onnaire form.  
7.3.1.7  QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRES  
The EQ5D and SF36 -v2 surveys  will be completed at pre -procedure and at 6, 12 and 24 months.  
See Appendices  E and F  for the questionnaire form s. 
7.3.1.8  DUPLEX ULTRASOUND AND ANGIOGRAPHY GUIDELINES  
The initial baseline DUS must be performed after the index procedure (up to 1 month  ±2 weeks  
post-procedure), and again at 6, 12 and 24 months.  Since DUS is critical to assessing study 
endpoints, the quality of this test is extremely important.  The Core Labs will be closely 
monitoring the quality of all incoming images for compliance.  Sites should ensure that only DUS 
operators who are trained on the protocol and DUS guidelines are performing these tests.  Refer to

7.3.2 FOLLOW -UP PROCEDURES  
The Investigator or Research Coordinator will contact randomized subjects v ia phone (or via 
clinical visit if preferred or as part of a regular follow -up) at approximately 1 month, 36 months, 
48 months and 60 months (and possibly longer if required) in order to assess for any adverse 
events and medication compliance.    
All rando mized subjects will return for follow -up at 1 (if required for duplex ultrasound), 6, 12 and 
24 months post procedure. See Table 8 for required testing at each follow -up visit time point.  
Refer to Section 7.1 Blinding Plan for specifics on maintaining the blind during the fol low-up 
visits.   
Following randomization, all subject s are required to complete all assigned follow -up visits and 
procedures.  During the duration of the study, all events need to be reported in the web -based 
eCRF. Subject s will be instructed to report adv erse events to their study physician between 
evaluation visits.  
Relevant medications will be recorded on the eCRF.  Anti -platelet therapy compliance including 
dose, periods of interruption (and reason for interruption), and invasive procedures deterred due  to 
the need to take anti -platelet therapy will also be recorded on the eCRF.  
8 ADVERSE  EVENTS  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject.  This definition 
does not imply that there is a relationship between the adverse event and the device under 
investigation.  See Appendix A for detailed AE definitions.  
8.1 ADVERS E EVENT  REPORTING  
All adverse events occurring since the start of the study procedure must be recorded in the eCRF. 
All serious adverse events will be reviewed and adjudicated by the Clinical Event s Committee  to 
determine  whether it is related to the devic e or procedure.   All adverse events occurring in this 
study will be classified in accordance with the adverse event signs or symptoms.  Any Serious 
Adverse Event must be reported to Lutonix or designee within 24 hours of knowledge. All adverse 
events will be reported to the IRB/EC per local requirements.  
9 SUBJECT  WITHDRAWAL  CRITERIA  
Subject s can withdraw from the study at any time  for any reason ; the reason for withdrawal will be 
documented.  All data available at the time of withdrawal (if any) will be used  for analysis. There 
will be no further follow -up (per this study protocol) on the subject  who has withdrawn.  Subject s 
who withdraw from the study will not be replaced, however loss -to-follow -up has been considered

 If a visit i s missed, the site is required to document a minimum of three (3) attempts to contact the 
subject within the follow -up window.  If the subject only misses one protocol required visit, the 
site should repeat the three (3) attempts to contact the subject fol lowed by a certified letter.  When 
a subject misses two (2) consecutive follow -up visits with failure of all contact attempts, the 
subject may then be considered lost to follow up and exited from the study.  
10 DATA  COLL ECTION  AND  MONITORING  
10.1   DATA  COLLECTION  
The Investigator  (or designated hospital staff) will assure primary data collection based on source -
documente d hospital chart reviews. These documents will be completed in an expedited fashion.  
10.1.1  ELECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS (ECRF)  
All required c linical data for this trial will be collected in web -based standardized e - CRFs.  
Clinical  trial data will be collected in accordance with the Guidance for Industry: Collection of 
Race and Ethnicity Data in Clinical Trials.  Subject  personal information sh ould be blinded.  Site 
numbers, subject n umbers and initials will be used to track subject  information throughout the 
study.  
The eCRF is designed to accommodate the specific features of the study design.  Modification of 
the eCRF will only be made if deeme d necessary by Lutonix and /or the appropriate regulatory 
body.   
10.1.2  ANGIOGRAMS AND  DUPLEX ULTRASOUNDS  
All core lab raw data will be sent to the independent Core Lab listed in the study summary.  All 
Core Lab evaluators will be blinded to the randomized treatm ent.  A specific algorithm will be 
used to analyze each core lab result.  This information will be documented on a study form and the 
data transmitted to Data Management for integration into the main study database.   
10.2   MONITORING  
A formal written Monitori ng Plan will be developed in accordance to FDA guidelines 53 CFR 
4723 and the study protocol by the CROs appointed for this study and approved by Lutonix.  
Appropriately trained and qualified monitoring personnel will monitor the progress of this study.  
Prior to protocol submission to the site, a formal pre -qualification visit will be conducted by a 
Lutonix employee or designee at sites who have not previously been involved in Lutonix -
sponsored trials.  Pre -qualification visits are done to confirm the appr opriate staff, experience, 
resources, equipment, and patient population exist for this protocol.  
Each site will have an initiation visit performed by a Study Monitor and a member of the Lutonix 
clinical staff.  This visit will ensure that the investigator understands his/her responsibility for 
conducting this study at his/her center.  This includes, but is not limited to, device accountability,

 protocol compliance, informed consent process, enrolling appropriate subjects, and IRB/EC 
submissions, approvals, and continuing reviews.  
Monitoring will be perform ed on  100% of original medical records of all enrolled subjects for all 
case report form data fields.   Sites will be monitored according to the approved monitoring plan.  
Monitoring personnel will monitor for accuracy and timely submission of data forms and core lab 
images , and compliance with the study protocol, meeting enrollment commitments, applicable 
regulations, the signed Investigator  Agreement and any conditions of a pproval imposed by the 
reviewing IRB/EC  and/or regulatory agencies.   Monitoring personnel will also confirm 
documentation of the informed consent process, missing visits or examinations, and the reason for 
any subject failing to complete the study.    
Any e vident pattern of non -compliance with respect to these standards will be cause for the site to 
be put on probation.  If corrective actions are not subsequently undertaken, the clinical site will be 
asked to stop enrollment and complete outstanding follow -up visits for subjects already enrolled at 
their site.   
Monitoring visits will be scheduled based on the enrollment rate at each site, duration of the study, 
compliance, and any suspected inconsistency in data that requires investigation.    
The Study Monit ors will maintain personal contact with the Investigator  and staff throughout the 
study by phone, mail, and on -site visits.  The Study Monitors will compile and submit to Lutonix a 
monitoring report after each visit  which will include any findings, conclus ions, and actions taken 
to correct deficiencies . Specifically, the Study Monitors will review:  
• Screening Procedures  
• Subject  Randomization  
• Discontinuation of Treatment  
• Source Data  
• Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event Recording and Reporting  
• Investigational D evice Reconciliation  
• Study Data  and Core Lab Data Submission  
• Protocol Deviations  
At the close of the study at an investigational site, appropriately trained personnel appointed by 
Lutonix will make a final on -site visit.  The purpose of this visit is to co llect all outstanding study 
data documents, ensure that the Investigator 's files are accurate and complete, review record 
retention requirements with the Investigator , make a final accounting of all study supplies shipped 
to the Investigator , provide for a ppropriate disposition of any remaining supplies, and ensure that 
all applicable requirements are met for the study.  The observations and actions made at this visit 
will be documented and communicated to the Investigator .

 Members of the Steering Committee, in conjunction with the CRO and imaging core laboratories, 
will oversee protocol compliance and implement steps of corrections, action s or warnings letters as 
necessary. Any site found to have major or repeated compliance issues will be contacted by a 
Steerin g Committee member, or designee, for necessary discussion and/or retraining. The Steering 
Committee may stop enrollment at any site based on compliance or safety issues . 
12.2  DATA  MONITORING  COMMITTEE  
The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  is responsible for the oversight and safety monitoring of 
the study . The DMC advises the Sponsor regarding the continuing safety of the trial subjects and 
those yet to be recruited to the trial, as well as the continuing validity and scientific merit of t he 
trial.  The DMC  members are leading experts in peripheral vascular disease, cardiovascular 
medicine  and biostatistics who are not participating in the trial and have no affiliation with 
Lutonix.  
During the enrollment phase of the trial, the DMC  will rev iew accumulating safety data to monitor 
for incidence of serious vascular events that would warrant modification or termination of the trial.  
Any DMC  recommendations for study modification or termination because of concerns over 
subject  safety or issues re lating to data monitoring or quality control will be submitted in writing to 
the Steering Committee for consideration and final decision. However, if the DMC at any time 
determines that a potential serious risk exists to subject s in this trial, the DMC  chairman will 
immediately notify the Steering Committee.  
The DMC  will meet at regular intervals to review the safety data. DMC  responsibilities, 
membership, meeting frequencies , and procedures will be outlined in the DMC  charter.  
12.3   CLINICAL  EVENTS  COMMITTEE  
The Clinical Event s Committee ( CEC ) is made up of a minimum of three clinicians with expertise 
in vascular intervention and who are not participants in the study  or members of the SC . The 
members of the CEC  will be blinded to the subject ’s treatment. The CEC is charged with the 
development of specific criteria used for the categorization of clinical events and clinical endpoints 
in the study which are based on the protocol.  
At the onset of the trial, the CEC  will establish explicit rules outlining the mini mum amount of 
data required in order to classify a clinical event. All members of the CEC  will be blinded to the 
primary results of the trial. The C EC will meet regularly to review and adjudicate all clinical 
events. The committee will also review and rule  on all deaths that occur throughout the trial.  
13 REGULATORY  RESPONSIBILITIES

Any amendments to the protocol, as well as possible associated information and consent form 
changes, will be submitted to the IRB/EC  and written approval obtained prior to impleme ntation.  
13.2   REGULATORY  APPROVAL  
In the USA an IDE application  must be submitted to the FDA .  IDE a pproval must be received 
prior to the inclusion of the first US subject .  
In the EU, t he study must be submitted to the Competent Authorities in each country that the study 
is being conducted, according  to the national requirements. Approval or a confirmation fro m the 
authority that the study can start must be received prior to the inclusion of the first EU subject .  
13.3   INFORMED  CONSENT  
Part of the IRB/EC approv al must include approval of an Informed Consent Form (ICF) that is 
specific to the study and approved by the FDA and any other re levant  regulatory bodies.  The  
Investigator  must administer this approved ICF to each prospective study subject , and obtain the  
subject 's signature on the ICF prior to enrollment in the study.  The ICF  may be modified to suit 
the requirements of the individual site.  The Investigator  will provide Lutonix or designee with a 
copy of the approved ICF for his/her site.  Lutonix or des ignee must pre -approve each ICF prior to 
initial submission to the IRB/EC; major changes must be approved by the FDA.  
The study must be explained in a language that is understandable to the subject  and he/she must be 
allowed sufficient time to decide wheth er to participate. All subject s will be assured that they have 
the right to withdraw from the study at any time during the course of the protocol and this decision 
will not influence his/her relationship with the Investigator  (treating physician) and/or st udy staff.  
13.4   SELECTION  OF CLINICAL  SITES  AND  INVESTIGATORS  
The Sponsor  will select Investigator s who are qualified and experienced to participate in  the 
investigation of the study devices. Sites will be selected based upon a review  of a recent site 
assess ment and the qualifications of the (primary) Investigator (s) at  the site. Investigator s may be 
selected to participate in the study after submitting a  current  curriculum vitae (CV).  
All Investigator s must be approved by the Sponsor  prior to participation in the study.  
Any site  that becomes deactivated prior to initial enrollment, either by the sponsor or by the 
individual site itself,  will be replaced.  
Due to the potential for an imbalance in the randomization ratio from low enrolli ng sites, any site 
not able to enroll a subject within 2 months (60 days) of formal initiation will be replaced.  The 
sponsor will proactively be tracking site based enrollment throughout the study and may 
implement enrollment restrictions to assist in bal anced enrollment across sites.

15 STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS PLAN  
15.1   OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN  
The LEVANT 2 pivotal trial is a global, multi -center,  randomized clinical trial comparing the 
Moxy Drug Coated Balloon  to standard PTA for the treatment of stenosis of the femoropopliteal 
arteries.  Appr oximately 750 subjects will be enrolled in order to include a total of 476 randomized 
subjects at up to 55 global centers. Enrollment will be stopped once 476 subjects are randomized.  
Subject randomization will be allocated 2:1 Moxy Drug Coated Balloon (test arm) to standard 
PTA catheter (control arm) after  successful pre -dilatation .   
Subjects are considered enrolled in the study after being consented and the defined pre -dilatation 
balloon inflation has begun.  Based on angiographic results afte r predilatation, some will not meet 
criteria for randomization , and these nonrandomized patients are followed only for safety and do 
not contribute to the required evaluable sample size of 476 randomized subjects.  However, since 
the patient  underwent a pr otocol defined predilatation, they are considered to be enrolled even 
though  they are not randomized.  
The approximate number 750 of enrolled patients was estimated from the proportion of  subjects in

reported in the literature.  Approximately 1/3 or more of total number of predilatated subjects will 
likely not be randomized and will be treated per standard of care.  Enrollment will continue only 
until a randomize d sample size of 476 is achieved, since this is  the randomized sample size 
necessary for primary endpoint analysis presuming up to 15% loss -to-follow -up (i.e. 405 evaluable

 Successful pre-dilatation  is defined as ≤70% residual stenosis and an absence of flow -limiting 
dissection based on strict angiographic criteria .  Subjects who met these criteria  are randomized .  
Subjects who do not meet post -predilitation lesion  success  criteria  are not randomized and are 
instead treated per hospital standard  practice,  followed for safety for 30 days , and then withdrawn.  
Subject s who are enrolled and randomized will be followed clinically for 24 months to assess the 
primary endpoints of patency and f reedom from serious adverse events with further follow -up 
extending out to 5 years.  
The primary analysis is an ITT analysis using proportion -based testing.   For the study to be 
considered successful, superiority of Moxy Drug Coated Balloon must be demonstr ated for the 
primary efficacy endpoint, and non -inferiority of the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon must be 
demonstrated for the primary safety endpoint .  US and non -US enrollment will be 
contemporaneously monitored throughout the study to ensure approximately 50%  of randomized 
subjects occur at US sites.  
15.2   ASSESSMENT  OF COMPARABILITY  OF TREATMENT  GROUPS  AND  
POOLABILITY  OF SITES  AND  SECONDARY  ANALYSES  
To demonstrate the comparability of the Control to Test subjects, the samples will be compared 
using t -tests or Wi lcoxon nonparametric tests for means and X2-tests for proportions: age, gender, 
smoking, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, total target  lesion length  and maximum 
percent stenosis of the target lesion  (via core lab analysis) , previous target  lesion intervention,  ABI 
of the target limb, and Rutherford grade.   
All primary endpoints will also be presented by site, and the sites will be tested for differences in 
the endpoints.  Sites with  3 or fewer randomized subjects will be combined for this purpose.     
An analysis will be performed to examine the potential for interaction of site and treatment group.    
A mixed effects logistic regression model will be fit that includes a fixed effect for treatment 
group, and random effects for site and the i nteraction of treatment group and site.  If the p -value 
for the interaction term variance component is <0.15, it will be considered evidence of a 
statistically significant interaction effect, and additional analyses will be performed to explore the 
differences between sites to assess their potential causes and whether or not they are clinically 
meaningfu l.     
All primary endpoints will also be presented by geography (US versus OUS).  An analysis will be 
performed to examine the potential for interaction of geography and treatment group.  A logistic 
regression model will be fit that includes fixed effects  for treatment group, geography, and the 
interaction of treatment group and geography.  If the p -value for the interaction term is <0. 15, it 
will be considered evidence of a statistically significant interaction effect, and additional analyses 
will be perf ormed to explore the differences between geographies to assess their potential causes 
and whether or not they are clinically meaningful.

26 March 2012  LUTONIX CONFIDENTIAL  Page 52 of 71 
 In addition, a descriptive analysis that examines the impact of important covariates on study results 
will be performed . Baseline covariates are age, gender, smoking, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, 
diabetes mellitus, total target lesion length, and maximum percent stenosis of the target lesion (via 
core lab analysis), previous target lesion intervention, ABI of the target limb, and Rutherford 
grade.  These covariates will be included along with treatment group in a logistic regression model 
in order to understand their potential impact on study results and to account for chance imbalances 
between the randomized groups in th ese covariates.  
To assess the consistency of results under different analyses, secondary as -treated (AT) and per -
protocol (PP) analyses will be performed for the primary and secondary endpoints.  The AT 
dataset will include only those subjects treated with  either an investigational or control device, and 
the comparison will be based on the actual device used, not randomized assignment.  The PP 
dataset will include all subjects in the full analysis dataset that are characterized by appropriate 
exposure to tr eatment (procedurally correct as pre -specified), availability of measurements, and the 
absence of major protocol violations including violations of entry criteria.  An additional 
supportive analysis of patients with and without bailout stenting will also b e performed based on 
descriptive statistics, and data will further be presented for PP analysis of subjects with and 
without bailout stenting.  
A descriptive analysis will also be reported for the subset of subjects with treated lesion s ≥4 cm , 
comparable to the inclusion criteria of ongoing VIVA OPC16  stent registry studies (e.g., SUPERB 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , OSPREY [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , and DURABILITY II [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ).   
 
15.3    HANDLING  OF MISSING  DATA  
Endpoints may be missing because subjects have died , have uni nterpretable imaging data  or have 
withdrawn from the study prior to the time the endpoint is measured.  The primary safety and 
effectiveness endpoints will be analyzed using survival analysis techniques.  In survival analyses, 
unobserved endpoints are a st andard part of the analysis; they are known as “censored 
observations”.  As long as the censoring is unrelated to the treatment, this method of handling 
missing endpoints produces unbiased estimates of the freedom -from -event rates.  
The reason  for the censo ring of all subjects with missing endpoints will be reported; if there is any 
indication that the censoring is related to the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon or to the standard PTA 
catheter , a worst -case analysis will be performed for each primary endpoint, in ad dition to the 
standard analysis.  In a worst -case analysis, an event will be assumed to have occurred at the time 
the subject discontinued participation in the study  for all such subjects in the Test group.  In the 
Control group, all subjects with missing data will be assumed not to have had an event.  In

 addition, a tipping -point analysis will also be performed, in which assumptions about missing data 
are varied from worst -case to best -case to examine at what point the missing data would alter the 
results of the analysis.  These analyses will constitute sensitivity analyses of the effect of missing 
data on the study results.  
15.4    PRIMARY  ENDPOINTS  
Primary Safety Endpoint  
The primary safety endpoint is a c omposite of freedom from all -cause perioperative (≤30 day) 
death and freedom at 1 year from the following: index limb amputation  (above and below the 
ankle)  index limb re -intervention, and index -limb-related death.   These events are called “safety 
events” in the following text.  
Primary Effi cacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is Primary Patency of the target lesion at 1 year. Primary Patency is 
defined as the absence of target lesion restenosis (defined by DUS PSVR ≥2.5) and freedom from 
target lesion revascularization (TLR).   These e vents are called “efficacy events” in the following 
text. 
The clinical status of the subject (for assessment of clinical and primary safety endpoints) is established 
prior to performing the required DUS (for assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint). A patent target 
lesion (by core lab DUS analysis) at the 12 month visit without a prior TLR is considered an Efficacy 
Success . 
 
 
15.4.1    PRIMARY SAFETY ENDPOINT : BACKGROUND CONSIDERATIONS & OUTCOME 
EXPECTATIONS  
The Primary Safety Endpoint includes assessment of cl inically significant systemic and 
downstream vascular complications at 1 year by assessing freedom from all-cause index limb re-
intervention (e.g. PTA or surgical bypass) for any reason (e.g. embolism, thrombosis, or 
restenosis), all index limb amputations  (including both major and minor amputations below -the 
ankle), index -limb-related death , and  all-cause perioperative (≤30 day) death . 
Primary Endpoint expectations are estimated  from an analysis of data from  three randomized trials:   
• The THUNDER trial12, a prospective randomized European clinical trials  of another 
manufacturer’s drug-coated balloon (DCB) to a sta ndard uncoated balloon to treat 
femoropopliteal stenosis  
• The FemPac  trial13, a prospective randomized European clinical trial of another 
manufacturer’s DCB to a standard uncoated balloon to treat femoropopliteal stenosis  
• The LEVANT I study  of the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon, which uses the same API as 
the THUNDER and FemPac DCB, but a different excipient (drug carrier ).  Like the 
other studies, the control in the L EVANT I study was a standard PTA balloon.

 Although the primary composite safety endpoint as defined in the present study is not specifically 
reported in THUNDER and FemPac, the rate is estimated as the rate of freedom from all clinical 
events including dea th, amputation, any TLR (clinically -indicated or not), embolism or thrombosis 
in THUNDER at 12 months and in FemPac at clinical follow -up between 18 and 24 months (since 
12 month data was not reported).  Clinical outcomes reported for these Control studies  and 
LEVANT I are summarized in Table 11: Historic Data for Primary Saf ety Endpoint Estimation

This analysis is complicated by the fact that there is likely to have been some overlap between the 
adverse events reported in the THUNDER and F emPac studies ;  however Lutonix does not have 
access to the raw data, and therefore are  not able to assess to what extent this affects the hazard 
rates .  In addition, subjects that based on unacceptable angiographic results after predilatation are 
likely to require stenting are excluded from the present study, so there may be some inherent 
positive selection bias that was absent in THUNDER and FemPac.   Nevertheless, these factors that 
might increase the primary endpoint rate are at least partially counterb alanced by the fact that the 
above studies did not report many adverse index limb events (such as minor below -the-ankle 
amputations and non -target lesion vascular interventions) that count as safety endpoint failures in 
the present study.  
The most conserv ative estimates come from the LEVANT I study; the hazard rates in the Test and 
Control groups are more similar in LEVANT I than in THUNDER or FemPac.  The safety 
endpoint success rate of the  Moxy Drug Coated Balloon  is therefore assumed to be 70% at 12 
months, and of the standard PTA catheter to be 48% at 12 months.

 15.4.2  PRIMARY SAFETY ENDPOINT :  HYPOTHESES AND SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION  
Objective :  To assess whether the proportion of subjects with at least one  safety event * in the Test 
group is inferior or not inf erior to that of Control group through 12 -months post -index procedure.  
H0: The proportion of subjects with safety events in the Test group through 12 -months 
post-index procedure is clinically inferior to that of the Control group.  
H1: The proportion of subjects with safety events in  the Test group through 12 -months 
post-index procedure is clinically non-inferior to that of the Control group.  
H0:PTEST  – PCONTROL   ≥       vs.    H 1:PTEST   – PCONTROL  < ** 
*All-cause perioperative (≤30 day) death , index limb amputation  (above and below the ankle),  
index limb re -intervention, and index -limb-related death  are ‘safety events’. ** δ is the range of 
differences that is considered not clinically important (it also known as the “range of indifference ” 
or the “margin of noninfer iority” ). 
The statistical analysis will be a Farrington & Manning test for non -inferiority of proportions ; the 
test will be a one -sided test at α=0.025.  The response variable  in each subject  will be the presence 
or absence of at least one safety event  from the time  following the index procedure  through 12 
months .  The primary analysis will be ITT.  In addition to the primary ITT analysis, secondary as -
treated analyses and per -protocol analyses will also be reported but may not be the basis of 
labeling clai ms. 
The proportions  at 12 -months post -index procedure, and the confidence intervals of these rates in 
each group, will also be reported.  
Sample Size Estimate :  We estimated the sample size under the following conditions:  
• The true 12 -month proportion  in the  Test group is 100% - 70% = 30%.  The true 12 -month 
proportion  in the Control group is 100% - 48% = 52%. 
• A 2:1 randomization ratio . 
• Farrington & Manning test for non -inferiority of proportions.  
• The Type 1 error,  = 0.025 (one -sided).  
• The Type 2 error,  = 0.10 (Power = 1 -  = 90%). 
• The non -inferiority margin, δ= . 05. 
• Subjects who are censored without having an event  will be omitted from the analysis.  
 
According to PASS 2008 (using the Farrington and Manning test for non -inferiority of 
proportions ), the evaluable sample size required for 90% power is 150 (50 Control plus 100 Test).  
This endpoint is not the sample -size driver of the study.   Randomization of 476 subjects is 
expected to provide at least 405 evaluable subjects, after adjust ment for up to 15% censoring) and 
approximately 99% power.

 15.4.3  PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT : BACKGROUND CONSIDERATIONS & OUTCOME 
EXPECTATIONS  
The Primary Efficacy Endpoint is Primary Patency of the target lesion at 1 year. Primary Patency 
is defined as the absenc e of binary restenosis based on DUS peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) 
≥2.5 and freedom from TLR.  
In order  to facilitate comparison with other ongoing studies and in deference to the threshold used 
in defining  the VIVA Physician Group endpoint17, seconda ry endpoint alternative patency will also 
be reported for PSVR binary restenosis thresholds ≥2.0 and ≥3.0.  Compared to threshold PSVR 
≥2.0, the threshold ≥2.5 more accurately reflects clinically significant stenosis and is more 
consistent with angiographic  results.18 The primary composite efficacy endpoint as defined in the 
present study is not specifically reported in THUNDER or FemPac, neither of which included 
Doppler ultrasound assessment at 1 year.  
The efficacy endpoint success rate is instead estimated solely from the obser ved rate of freedom 
from TLR (whether clinically -indicated or not) at 18 to 24 months in these studies.  It is 
noteworthy that only after 2 years do TLR rates exceed 6 month angiographic binary restenosis 
rates. Efficacy events reported for these studies a nd for the pilot study LEVANT I are summarized 
in Table 12 below .  Efficacy endpoints success rate is estimated in Table 12 from LEVANT I data 
according to both angiographic and DUS criteria for restenosis, even though DUS will be used in 
the LEVANT 2 study.

 ++ The predicted FF -event rate at 12 months equals EXP( -hazard*time).  
Note that the hazard rates in the Control and Test groups based on the LEVANT I DUS data are 
more similar than in the THUNDER and FemPac studies or using LEVANT I angiographic data, 
which means that using the LEVANT I DUS data produces the most conservativ e (i.e. largest) 
study sizes.  So in spite of its limitations, we used LEVANT I DUS data to estimate study sizes for 
the current study. The eff icacy endpoint success rate of the Moxy Drug Coated Balloon is 
therefore assumed to be 59% at 12 months, and of t he standard PTA catheter to be 42% at 12 
months.  
15.4.4  PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT : HYPOTHESIS AND SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION  
Objective :  To assess whether the proportion of subjects with at least one  efficacy event * in the 
Test group is equal or not to that of Contr ol group through 12 -months post -index procedure.  
H0: The proportion of subjects with efficacy events in  the Control group through 12 -months 
post-index procedure is equal to that of the Test group.  
H1: The proportion of subjects with efficacy events in  the Control group through 12 -months 
post-index procedure is not equal to that of the Test group.  
H0: PCONTROL  = PTEST        vs.    H 1: PCONTROL  ≠ PTEST    
*Target lesion restenosis (defined by DUS PSVR ≥2.5) and target lesion revascularization (TLR)  
are ‘efficacy events’.  
The statistical analysis will be a  likelihood ratio chi -square test for  inequality of binomial 
proportions ; the test will be a two -sided test at α=0.05.  The response variable  in each subject  will 
be the presence or absence of at le ast one efficacy  event  from the time  following the index 
procedure  through 12 months .  The primary analysis will be ITT, and a significant rejection of the 
null hypothesis with results in favor of the Test group will indicate success for this endpoint.  In  
addition to the primary ITT analysis, secondary as -treated analyses and per -protocol analyses will 
also be reported but may not be the basis of labeling claims.  
The proportions  at 12 -months post -index procedure, and the confidence intervals of these rates in 
each group, will also be reported.  
Sample Size Estimate :  The sample size estimate assumed the following:  
• The true 12 -month proportion  in the Test group is 100% - 59% = 41%.  The true 12 -month 
rate in the Control group is 100% - 42% = 58%. 
• A 2:1 randomization ratio.  
• Likelihood ratio chi -square test for  inequality of binomial proportions.  
• The Type 1 error,  = 0.05 (two -sided).  
• The Type 2 error,  = 0.10 (Power = 1 -  = 90%). 
• Subjects who are censored without having an event will be omitted from the analysis.

According to PASS 2008, the study  evaluable sample size required for 90% power is 
approximately 405 subjects ( 135 Control plus 270 Test after eliminating the censored subjects, if 
any).   After adjustment for 15% censoring through 12 months, the study size is 476 (317 in the 
Test group and 159 in the Control group ) randomized subjects.   This endpoint is the sample -size 
driver of the study .  
15.5     SECONDARY  ENDPOINTS  
15.5.1  SECONDARY ENDPOINTS WITH HYPOTHESIS TESTING  
The following secondary endpoints will have hypothesis tests.  No secondary endpoints will be 
tested unless both primary objectives  are passed.  All secondary endpoints with hypothesis tests 
will be included in the product labeling.  The primary analysis will be ITT.  In addition to the 
primary ITT analysis, secondary as -treated analyses and per -protocol analyses will also be reported  
but may not be the basis of labeling claims.  
The testing of the secondary objectives  will be performed in a hierarchical fashion in the order in 
which they are listed below.  This means that as soon as a null hypothesis is not rejected , no 
further hypothe ses will be tested.  This hierarchical testing scheme ensures that the study -wide 
Type 1 error rate is 0.05 when all of the secondary endpoints are tested at α=0.05.   
15.5.1.1  SECONDARY ENDPOINT :  TOTAL TLR  AT 12 MONTHS  
Objective :  To assess whether the proportion  of subjects with  a TLR in the Test group is equal or 
not to that of Control group through 12 -months post -index procedure.  
H0: The proportion of subjects with a  TLR in the Control group through 12 -months post -
index procedure is equal to that of the Test gr oup. 
H1: The proportion of subjects with a  TLR in the Control group through 12 -months post -
index procedure is not equal to that of the Test group.  
H0: PCONTROL  = PTEST        vs.    H 1: PCONTROL  ≠ PTEST  
The statistical analysis will be a likelihood ratio chi -square test for inequality of  binomial  
proportions ;  the test will be a two -sided test at α=0.05.  The response variable  for each subject  will 
be the presence or absence of a TLR by 12 months .     
The proportions  at 12 -months post -index procedure, and the confidence intervals of these rates in

 A hospital day is defined as any day the s ubject spends as a hospital in -subject  or any day that the 
hospital is visited for an emergency -department evaluation or an out -subject  procedure.  Only 
those hospital days after the index procedure that are associated with treatment of PAD in the

 APPENDIX  A:  DEFINITIONS  
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject.  This definition 
does not imply that there is a relationship between the adverse event and the device under 
investigation.   
 Adverse Device Effect  
An adverse device effect is any untoward and unintended response to a medical device.  
This definition includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the 
instructions for use for preparation or deployment of the device.  It also includes any event 
that is a r esult of a user error.  
 Anticipated Adverse Event  
Any undesirable health related experience occurring to a subject whether or not considered 
related to the investigational product(s) or drug regimen prescribed as part of the protocol, 
predefined in the pr otocol and/or Instruction s For Use (IFU) that is identified or worsens 
during a clinical study.  
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A SAE is an adverse event that:  
• led to death or led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject  
• resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury,  
• resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function,  
• required in -subject hospitalization or prolongation of  existing hospitalization or  
• resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to body 
structure or a body function  
 All serious adverse events will be adjudicated by the CEC  and reported appropriately.  
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)  
A SADE is an adve rse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences 
characteristic of a serious adverse event or that might have led to any of these 
consequences if suitable action had not been taken or intervention had not been made or if 
circumstances had bee n less opportune.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
A UADE is “any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem 
or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not

 previously i dentified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan 
or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated 
serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or wel fare of 
subjects” (21 CFR 812.3(s)).  
 Adverse Event Severity Stratification  
The Investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse 
event:  
 
Mild  
 Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the 
subject’s usu al activity or is transient, resolved without treatment 
and with no sequelae.  
Moderate  
 Interferes with the subject’s usual activity and/or requires 
symptomatic treatment.  
Severe  
 Symptom(s) causing severe discomfort and significant impact of 
the subject’s usual activity and requires treatment.  
  
 Relationship to study device  
The Investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study device:  
 
Not Related  
 The event is definitely not associated with device application.  
The adverse event is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or 
effect of another device or drug.  
Unlikely  
 An adverse event has little or no temporal relationship to the 
study device and/or a more li kely alternative etiology exists.  
Possible  
 
 The temporal sequence between device application and the event  
is such that the relationship is not unlikely or subject’s condition 
or concomitant therapy could have caused the AE.  
Probable  
 The temporal sequence is relevant  or the event abates upon 
device application completion/removal or the Event cannot be 
reasonably explained by the subject’s condition.  
Highly 
Probable  The temporal sequence is relevant  and the event abates upon 
device application completion/removal, or reappearance of the 
event on repeat device application (re -challenge).

  Relationship to study procedure  
The Investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study procedure : 
 
Not Related  
 The event is definitely not associated with procedure .  The 
adverse event is due to an underlying or concurrent  illness or 
effect of another procedure . 
Unlikely  
 An adverse event has little or no temporal relationship to the 
procedure  and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
Possible  
 
 The temporal sequence between the procedure  and the event  is 
such that the relationship is not unlikely or subject’s condition or 
concomitant therapy could have caused the AE.  
Probable  
 The temporal sequence is relevant  or the event abates upon 
procedure completion  or the Event cannot be reasonably 
explained by the subject’s condition.  
Highly

Per-Protocol (PP)  
The PP analysis is based on all subjects  that are characterized by appropriate exposure to treatment 
(procedurally correct as pre-specified), availability of measurements, and the absence of major 
protocol violations including violations of entry criteria.  
 
Primary Patency  
Primary Patency of the target lesion is defined as the absence of binary restenosis based on DUS 
peak systol ic velocity ratio ≥2.5 (or based on angiography if performed) , as analyzed by 
independent core lab, without prior target lesion revascularization . (Alternative Primary Patency is 
also reported PSVR thresholds ≥2.0 and ≥3.0. )  
Procedural success  
Attainment of ≤30% residual stenosis in the treatment area by independent core lab analysis  
without major adverse events during the index procedure.   
 
Popliteal Artery  
The vessel located between Hunter’s canal and the trifurcation.  
PSVR  
Peak Systolic Velocity Ratio  
 
Reference Vessel Diameter (RVD)  
The interpolated reference vessel diameter is based on a computed estimation of the original 
diameter of the artery at the level of the obstruction (minimal luminal diameter)  
Restenosis  
Either ≥50% restenosis of the d iameter of the reference -vessel segment by Q VA or peak systolic 
velocity ratio of ≥2.5, determined by blinded ultrasound  and independent core lab analysis . 
Restenotic Lesion  
A lesion in a vessel segment that had undergone a prior percutaneous treatment

occlusive disease  Normal results of treadmill  (5 min,2 mph, 
12⁰ constant grade )  
I 1 Mild Claudication  Treadmill exercise complete, post exercise 
AP is greater than 50 mm Hg but more 
than 25 mm Hg less than normal  
 2 Moderate Claudication  Symptoms between  categories 1 and 3  
 3 Severe Claudication  Treadmill exercise cannot be completed 
post exercise AP is less than 50 mm Hg

barely pulsatile ankle or metatarsal 
plethysmographic tracing, toe pressure less 
than 30 mm Hg

ischemia  Resting AP of 60 mm Hg or less, flat or 
barely pulsatile ankle metatarsal 
plethysmographic tracing flat or barely 
pulsatile, toe pressure less than 40 mm Hg  
 6 Major tissue loss, extending above 
transmetatarsal level, functional foot 
no longer sa lvageable  Same as category 5  
 
Screen Failures  
Subject s screened, but not meeting all study entry criteria and hence are not enrolled, are 
considered screening failures and will be documented as such on the Screening Logs.  
Secondary Patency  
Secondary  Patency of the target lesion is defined as the absence of binary restenosis based on DUS 
peak systolic velocity ratio ≥2.5 (or based on angiography if performed)  as analyzed by 
independent core lab, independent of whether or not patency is re-established via an endovascular 
procedure .   
Stroke  
Clinical signs/symptoms of focal neurological deficit lasting longer than  24 hours . 
Target Lesion  
Lesion that is to be treated during the index procedure.  For study inclusion, the lesion must be ≥1 cm 
below the common femoral bifurcation and terminates distally ≤2  cm below the tibial plateau AND ≥1 
cm a bove the origin of the posterior tibial trunk , with the intent of staying above the trifurcation.

 Target Lesion Revascularization  
A repeat revascularization procedure (percutaneous or surgical) of the original target lesion site.  
Target Vessel Revascularization  
A repeat revascularization procedure (percutaneous or surgical) of a lesion in the target vessel . 
Target Vessel   
The entire vessel in which the target lesion is located.

Short Title  BAC for Alzheimer’s Disease or  Vascular Dementia Phase II Study  
Project No  BAC -02 
Study Phase  Phase II  
Sponsor  Charsire Biotechnology Corp.  
Objectives   To evaluate the efficacy and safety of BAC in patients with 
Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia  
Study Design  Randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, parallel study  
Study Population  Patient aged at least 40 years old in United States diagnosed with 
Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia  
Number of Patients  The sample size is determined to be 45 versus 15 patients (3 :1 ratio) 
for Treatment versus Control groups, 60 patients in total. To ensure 
the completion of 60 evaluable (per -protocol population) patients, 
around 75 patients will be recruited.  
Study Product, Dose, 
Route, Regimen  BAC (vapor fraction from seeds of Glycine max (L.) Merr . and 
composition thereof), topical application on external nasal skin, 
scalp, and neck, 2 times daily, 30g/day  
During the treatment period, patients may continue to receive 
routinely used medications or treatments for Alzheimer’s disease or 
vascular dementia.  
Duration of 
Administration  Twelve weeks  
Study Visits  Screening, Randomization (Baseline) Treatment (Weeks 2, 4, and 8 
compared to Baseline), Final (Week 12)  
Patient Assignment  In each study site, patients who meet all eligible requirements for 
entry into the study will be randomized and stratified into 1 of 2 
dementia types (Alzheimer’s disease and non - Alzheimer’s disease) 
into treatment group or vehicle control group in 3:1 ratio as shown 
below:

Statistical Analysis  Analysis Population  
Two data sets will be introduced for statistical analysis.  
Intent -to-treat (ITT) population:  
– All randomized patients who have received at least one dose 
study medication.  
Per-protocol (PP) population:  
 BAC  for Alzheimer’s Disease  or Vascular Dementia  
(Project Number: BAC -02) Version: 2.0 
Date: 24APR 2017 
 
Sponsor: Charsire Biotechnology Corp.  Page 7 of 9 – A subset of ITT population  
– Fulfill all inclusion and exclusion criteria  
– Accumulatively dosed with at least 63 days of study drug and 
with at least 75% of dosing compliance during treatment period  
– With ADAS -cog score  evaluation at or after Week 8 visit  
– Did not receive any prohibited treatment during the study  
Efficacy endpoints will be analyzed on ITT and PP population. 
Demographics, baseline characteristics, and s afety endpoints will be 
analyzed on ITT population. The conclusion of efficacy will be 
made according to the results of ITT population analysis.  
 
Analyses  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for 
each group by using descriptive statistics.  
The efficacy endpoints will be compared between the BAC group 
and vehicle group. The primary endpoint of this study is c hange in 
ADAS -cog score at Week 12 visit compared to baseline . The test 
will be performed by ANCOVA with treatment group and center as 
factor and with baseline score as covariate. Test treatment group 
will be declared superiority if the null hypothesis is rejected and 
impro vement in ADAS -cog of test product group is greater than that 
of matched vehicle group.  
As for secondary endpoints, change in ADAS -cog score  at all post -
treatment visits (except Week 12 visit) compared to baseline will be 
analyzed by ANCOVA with treatment group and center as factor 
and with baseline score as covariate. Same statistical analysis 
methods will be applied for other secondary endpoints such as 
changes in ADCS -ADL score, MMSE score, and NPI score at all 
post treatment visits compared to baseline.  The CIBIC -plus score at 
all post treatment visits will be presented by transition table.  
All treatment group comparisons will be conducted with 
significance level of 0.05, using 2 -tailed tests.  
For safety analyses, adverse events will be reported by treatment 
groups and by physiological systems as appropriate. Incidence of 
adverse events between treatments will be analyzed by CMH test.

individual system. Net changes from pre -treatment laborat ory test 
results and vital signs will be analyzed by descriptive statistics.  
All treatment group comparisons will be conducted with 
significance level of 0.05, using 2 -tailed tests.  
Additionally, descriptive statistics will be provided for all of the 
endpo ints. Frequency table will be provided for categorical data, 
while mean, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, median, inter -
quartile range (IQR), and 95% two -sided confidence interval will be 
calculated for continuous measurements.

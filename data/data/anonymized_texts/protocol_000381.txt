 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
TITLE Minimally Invasive Thoracic Surger y Intercostal Nerve Block Trial 
SPONSOR Sponsor-Investigator 
FUNDING 
ORGANIZATION Internal – UCSF Department of Su rgery, Division of Cardiothoracic 
Surgery 
NUMBER OF SITES 1 
RATIONALE Subjects who undergo minimally invasive lung surgery have 
postoperative surgical pain.  Uncont rolled surgical pain of the chest 
wall can result in splin ting, atelectasis, and pneumonia.  The optimal 
strategy to manage surgical pain from minimally invasive thoracic surgery is unknown.  With th e development of Liposomal 
Bupivacaine, a sustained-releas e formulation of Standard 
Bupivacaine, there has been renewed interest in regional intercostal 
nerve blockade.  While Standard Bu pivacaine loses ef ficacy after 8 
hours, Liposomal Bupivacaine has the potential efficacy of 96 hours.  
The trial data supporting Liposom al Bupivacaine were performed 
outside of thoracic surgery in lo cal wound infiltration (not regional 
nerve blockage), and the data within  thoracic surgery are limited and 
based upon observational studies.  
STUDY DESIGN Randomized, double-blind, ac tive-comparator contro lled clinical trial 
PRIMARY 
OBJECTIVE To assess the analgesic efficacy of  intraoperative intercostal nerve 
block and wound infiltration by Liposomal Bupivacaine versus Standard Bupivacaine in subjects  undergoing minimally invasive lung 
resection. 
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES To assess if there are changes in pe rioperative outcomes  in intercostal 
nerve block by Standard Bupivacaine versus Liposomal Bupivacaine:  
pulmonary complications, length of stay, direct hospital costs, quality of life.

call the clinic. 
PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSES  When the study has reached 1/3 a nd 2/3 goal enrollm ent, interim 
analysis for safety will be c onducted by an independent data 
monitoring committee.  Serious and severe adverse events will be 
monitored by the committee on an ongoing basis throughout the 
study. 
STATISTICS 
Primary Analysis Plan & Rationale Null Hypothesis:  There is no diff erence in cumulative daily in-
hospital use of opioids in subjects who receive intercostal nerve block 
and wound infiltration with Liposom al Bupivacaine or Standard 
Bupivacaine during minimally invasive lung resection. 
Statistical Method:  Student’s t-test. 
Rationale: 80 subjects will provide 80% power to detect a statistically 
significant effect with 2-sided alpha error set at 0.05 if the measured 
effect is 19% absolute reduction in cumulative daily in-hospital use of 
opioids.   
Kratz, Johannes R. Confidential 
 
Version #: 9.0 Version Date: 11/5/2019 Pa ge 9 of 37 
 The mean cumulative daily in-hospi tal usage of opioids is 35mg 
morphine equivalents with standa rd deviation of 12mg.  This was 
estimated by review of previously published studies and corroboration 
with UCSF clinical practice patterns.  A 19% reduction in cumulative daily in-hospital use of opioids  corresponds to 1 fewer oxycodone 
dose per day, which was considered clinically significant.

 1 BACKGROUND 
In the study, subjects under going minimally invasive lung su rgery will receive a one-time 
intraoperative inte rcostal nerve block and wound infiltra tion with Standard Bupivacaine or 
Liposomal Bupivacaine. 
Standard Bupivacaine 
Standard Bupivacaine ( Marcaine®; Hospira Inc; Lake Forest , IL) is an amide local 
anesthetic that is commonly used in the operating room fo r wound infiltrati on and regional 
nerve block.  Onset of action is 5-10 mi nutes and duration is up to 8 hours [1]. 
Liposomal Bupivacaine  
Liposomal Bupivacaine ( Exparel®; Pacira Pharmaceuticals Inc; Parsippany, NJ) is a 
sustained-release formulation of Standard Bupivacaine [2].  On set of action is within 10 
minutes and duration is up to 96 hours [3].  Liposomal Bupivacaine is FDA-approved for 
single-dose infiltration into the surgical site  to produce postsurgica l analgesia since 2015 
and brachial plexus regional nerve block since 2 018.  In clinical practi ce and research, it is 
also being used off-label for other forms of  regional nerve block (including intercostal 
nerve block).  Liposomal Bupivacaine is being used at UCSF for all procedures associated 
with an enhanced recovery program, which includes thoracic surgery. 
1.1 Overview of Non-Clinical Studies 
Liposomal Bupivacaine is a novel formulation of Standard Bupiv acaine that is designed to 
provide sustained-release.  Multivesicular liposomes release Standa rd Bupivacaine over 
an extended period of time due to diffusion, lipid membrane erosi on, and lipid membrane 
reorganization [4].  266mg Liposomal Bupivacai ne (planned dose for the study) reaches 
peak plasma levels at 12 hours and leve ls can be detected up to 96 hours after 
administration.  About 3% of the Liposoma l Bupivacaine formula tion contains extra-
liposomal Standard Bupivacaine to provide immediate analgesic coverage until there is 
adequate liposomal release [3].  The active component Standard Bupivacaine is an amide 
local anesthetic that binds the voltage-gated sodium channels of the neuron and inhibits 
conduction of pain.  Standard Bupivacaine is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 
and excreted by the kidneys [5].  The remn ant liposomes and lipi d membranes slowly 
degrade and are eliminated th rough systemic absorption [4]. 
1.2 Overview of Clinical Studies 
Liposomal Bupivacaine has been studied in a variety of surgical specialties in both wound 
infiltration and regional nerve block.  Comparison of studi es is limited by different 
surgical procedures, placebo versus active control, and varied primary and secondary 
outcomes.  
The initial trials of Liposomal Bupivacaine we re in wound infiltration [6].  In comparison 
to placebo, subjects undergoing hemorrhoidectomy had lower cumulative pain score and 
lower cumulative opioid cons umption in the first 72 hours after surgery [7].  In 
comparison to Standard Bupiv acaine, subjects undergoing breast augmentation had lower 
mean pain score at 12 hours and no differenc e for the remaining hospital stay [8].  
Subsequent trials have evaluated Liposomal B upivacaine in regional nerve block [9].  In 
Kratz, Johannes R. Confidential 
 
Version #: 9.0 Version Date: 11/5/2019 Pa ge 11 of 37 
 comparison to Standard Bupi vacaine, subjects undergoing robotic-assisted hysterectomy 
with abdominal wall nerve block had lower cumulative opioid use in the first 72 hours 
after surgery and subjects undergoing shoulder arthroplasty had reduced pain scores and 
opioid consumption in the first 48 hours [ 10, 11].  The most common adverse events 
associated with Liposomal Bupivacaine from these studies were nausea, emesis, and/or 
constipation.  Cardiac and neurologic toxicity were not reported [6, 9].   
Liposomal Bupivacaine is FDA-a pproved for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site 
to produce postsurgical analgesia since 2015 and brachial plexus regional nerve block 
since 2018.  In clinical practice and research, it is also being used off-label for other forms 
of regional nerve block (includi ng intercostal nerve block).   
In thoracic surgery, there are two published studies that were both observational and 
retrospective.  They evaluated intercostal nerv e block versus epidural  analgesia in subjects 
undergoing lung resection by bot h thoracotomy and minimally  invasive techniques [12, 
13].  Rice et al showed that there was no difference in pain sc ores, opioid use, or 
postoperative complications betw een groups.  However, Khalil et al showed that there 
were lower mean pain scores on postoperative day one and three, no difference in opioid 
usage, and lower pulmonary complications  in subjects that received Liposomal 
Bupivacaine [ Error! Bookmark not defined. ].  There is also an unpublished randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial in subjects that underwent thoracotomy and intercostal nerve 
block.  They did not find a di fference in pain scores or  total opioid consumption. 
There are currently three regi stered clinical trials at  ClinicalTrials.gov evaluating 
Liposomal Bupivacaine in lung resection su rgery.  The Mayo Clinic  is performing a non-
inferiority trial of epidural analgesia vers us intercostal nerve block with Liposomal 
Bupivacaine in subjects under going open lung resection [14].  Inova Health Care Services 
is performing a trial assessing local wound infi ltration with Liposomal  Bupivacaine versus 
Standard Bupivacaine in s ubjects undergoing thoracoscopy [1 5].  Massachusetts General 
Hospital is performing a trial evaluating intercostal nerve block with Liposomal 
Bupivacaine, Standard Bupivacaine, Standard  Bupivacaine with epinephrine, and normal 
saline in subjects undergoing vide o-assisted lung resection [16] .  Each of these studies 
address questions different fro m this proposal.  Moreover, th e results from these studies 
are not expected within the next year. 
2 STUDY RATIONALE 
Subjects who undergo minimally invasive thoracic surger y have acute, postoperative 
surgical pain.  Uncontrolled surgical pain of the chest wall can result in splinting, 
atelectasis, and pneumonia [17].  There are a variety of multim odality analgesic strategies 
currently employed in the clinical setting;  however, the optimal strategy to provide 
analgesia while minimizing analgesic-rela ted complications is unknown.  With the 
development of Liposomal Bupivacaine, a su stained-release formul ation of Standard 
Bupivacaine, there has been renewed interest  in regional intercostal nerve blockade. 
Currently, most centers utilize some combinati on of epidural analgesi a, systemic opioids, 
acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and gabapentin [18].  While this 
approach has proven effective, systemic opioids and epidural analgesia have many 
limitations.  In the hospital, over 15% of pa tients receiving oxycodone will experience 
Kratz, Johannes R. Confidential 
 
Version #: 9.0 Version Date: 11/5/2019 Pa ge 12 of 37 
 altered mental status, nausea, or  constipation [19].  In addition, it is essential to investigate 
other pain control strategies in considerat ion of the ongoing opioid a buse epidemic [20].  
In regard to epidural analge sia, its placement is operator dependent, is limited by subject 
habitus, cannot be used in subjects on antip latelets or anticoagulants, requires frequent 
postoperative monitoring, is associated w ith postoperative hypotension and urinary 
retention, and can result in epidural hematomas and absce sses that can be life-threatening 
[21, 22]. 
Intercostal nerve blockage with Liposomal Bupi vacaine is an alluring alternative analgesic 
strategy as it is a sustained-release formul ation of Standard Bupi vacaine.  Standard 
Bupivacaine loses efficacy after 8 hours, but Liposomal Bupivacaine has the potential 
efficacy of 96 hours [3].  Liposomal Bupi vacaine is FDA-approved for single-dose 
infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical anal gesia since 2015 and brachial 
plexus regional nerve block since 2018.  Its use for other forms of regional nerve block 
(including intercostal nerve block)  is considered off-label.  
Liposomal Bupivacaine is being used for local wound infiltration and regional nerve 
blocks across the surgical subspecialties, in cluding thoracic surgery.  The actual volume 
and breakdown of use in thoracic surgery is unknown; nonetheless,  over the half the 
audience at the Society of Thoracic Surgery Annual Conference in  January 2018 indicated 
that they routinely used Liposomal Bupivacaine  in their practice.  However, there is a 
clear deficit in data for thor acic surgery.  There have been  only two observational studies 
within thoracic surgery [12, 13].  They  compared Liposomal Bupivacaine to epidural 
analgesia and found equivalence between the t echniques.  The results from these studies 
are subject to systematic erro r with selection bias and confounding.  In addition, as the 
proportion of minimally invasive to open surg ery has increased with  the use of robotic-
assisted thoracic surgery [23] , many centers have eliminated  epidural analgesia for the 
aforementioned reasons and the more pertinen t question is Liposomal  Bupivacaine versus 
Standard Bupivacaine. 
As discussed in Section 1.2, there are ongoing tria ls that will provide less biased evidence 
in thoracic surgery assessing both local wound infiltration and intercostal nerve block with 
Liposomal Bupivacaine.  The Minimally Invasive Thoracic Surgery Intercostal Nerve 
Block Study is unique, because it will a ssess intercostal nerve block and wound 
infiltration with Standard B upivacaine and Liposomal Bupivacaine in both video-assisted 
and robotic-assisted lung resection. 
A final consideration is the ec onomic impact of Liposomal Bupi vacaine.  The direct costs 
of Liposomal Bupivacaine are 100 times the co sts of Standard Bupivacaine, and at UCSF, 
the direct costs of Liposomal Bupivacaine ar e $340 [24].  If Lipos omal Bupivacaine is 
found to be efficacious, there could be cost  savings through a reduction in use of other 
pain medications and postoperative compli cations.  Alternatively, if Liposomal 
Bupivacaine is not found to be efficacious, it will only add to the economic burden on the 
health care system. 
2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment 
The risks associated with Liposomal Bupivacai ne and Standard Bupivacaine are similar.  
The most common adverse events include na usea, emesis, and/or constipation and are 
Kratz, Johannes R. Confidential 
 
Version #: 9.0 Version Date: 11/5/2019 Pa ge 13 of 37 
 expected to occur in >10% of subjects.  Less common adverse events include dizziness, 
altered mental status, and hypers ensitivity reactions with urtica ria and/or pruritis.  Very 
rare, but serious adverse events  include neurologic toxicity  with seizures and apnea, 
cardiac toxicity with atriove ntricular nodal conduction abno rmalities and cardiac arrest, 
and hypersensitivity reaction with anaphylaxis.  Serious adverse events can be preventable 
with appropriate education, dos ing, and administration.  Most serious adverse events are 
found to be dose-related due to improper intr avascular injection, inappropriate dosing, or 
slow metabolic degradation in patients w ith hepatic dysfunction [6].  For more 
information regarding adve rse events, see prescribing information [2].   
To minimize risk and limit the occurrence of serious adverse events, subjects will not be 
eligible for the study if they have evidence of hepatic dysfunction.  In the operating room, 
dosing of Standard Bupivacaine will be base d upon subject weight (See Section 8.3.2).  
The medication will be administered with pr oper technique by drawing back before 
injection to ensure the tip of the needle is not located within the lu men of a blood vessel.  
On the hospital ward, continuous cardiac te lemetry will be used on all subjects and 
nursing will assess the mental status of each subject per shift. 
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
3.1 Primary Objective 
The primary objective is to assess the analge sic efficacy of intercostal nerve block and 
wound infiltration by Liposomal Bupivacaine ve rsus Standard Bupivacaine in subjects 
undergoing minimally invasive l ung resection by robotic or video-assisted thoracoscopic 
surgery. 
3.2 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objective is to assess if analgesia from the aforementioned interventions 
improve perioperative outcomes with reducti on in pulmonary complications, length of 
stay, and direct hospital co sts as well as improveme nt in quality of life. 
4 STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 Study Overview 
This is a single center, d ouble-blind, randomized, active-comp arator controlled clinical 
trial.  80 subjects undergoing minimally invasi ve lung resection will be randomly assigned 
to one of two study groups: a one-time intr aoperative intercostal nerve block and wound 
infiltration by Standard Bupivacaine or by Liposomal Bupivacaine.  Each subject will 
receive standardized postoperative pain manage ment.  Evaluations will be taken at three-
time points - preoperative clinic visit, index hospitalization following surgery, and 
postoperative clinic visit.  Scr eening data will be reviewed to  determine subject eligibility.  
Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered 
into the study.  Total duration of subject participation will be 30 days.  Total duration of 
the study is expected to be 8 months.  The treatment reg imens are outlined below.

 Active Comparator - Standard Bupivacaine  
- 5cc of prepared drug will be percutaneously  injected into each intercostal space 3-10 
with a 22-gauge spinal needle  under direct intrathoracic visi on and subcutaneously into 
each wound at the conclusion of the surgery.  
5 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION 
5.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
 Cumulative Daily In-Hospital Use of Opio ids measured in mg of Oral Morphine 
Equivalents 
The subjective sensation of pain is challengi ng to measure.  Cumulative daily in-hospital 
opioid use measured in mg of oral morphine equiva lents acts as a surrogate endpoint of 
pain and is commonly used in the literature.  It provides objective da ta that are recorded 
on every subject in the medi cation administration record. 
5.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
 Cumulative Daily In-Hospital Pain Score: 0 (no pain) – 10 (most pain)  
Pain Scores are a measure of the subject’s post operative pain that are recorded every four 
hours by the nursing staff.  They are limite d by the subject’s pe rception of pain, 
concomitant pain medication use, and corre lation with an abstract scaling system.  
 
 Mean Time to First Opioid Use (hours)  
Time to first opioid use is a surrogate mark er of postoperative pain.  It is limited by 
variations in anesthes iologist intraoperative  analgesia techniques. 
 
 Mean Time to Ambulation (hours)  
Time to ambulation is a downstream marker of  postoperative pain control.  Ambulation is 
limited by subject motivation an d/or physical disability. 
 
 Pulmonary Complications: Pneumonia and Atelectasis requiring Bronchoscopy (y/n)  
Pulmonary complications are a downstream ma rker of postoperative  pain control as 
subjects with chest wall postoperative pain co mmonly splint with respiration.  Splinting is 
associated with atelectasis and pneumonia. 
 
 Liposomal Bupivacaine and Stand B upivacaine Adverse Events (y/n):  
- Gastrointestinal- nausea, emesis, constipation  
- Hypersensitivity- pruritis, urticaria, anaphylaxis  
- Cardiac- atrioventricular heart block, cardiac arrest  
Kratz, Johannes R. Confidential 
 
Version #: 9.0 Version Date: 11/5/2019 Pa ge 15 of 37 
 - Neurologic- dizziness, altere d mental status, seizure  
- Miscellaneous  
To assess if there are differences in the complications between the study groups. 
 
 Length of Stay (days)  
Length of stay in the hospital can be used as downstream marker of overall postoperative 
course.  It is limited by a ttending practice patterns. 
 
 Total Opioid Prescription at Disc harge (morphine e quivalents in mg)  
To assess if there are differ ences in the amount of opioid prescribed at discharge. 
 
 Total Opioid Use as Outpatient (morphine equivalents in mg)  
To assess if there are diff erences in the amount of opi oid used after discharge. 
 
 Direct Costs of Hospita l Encounter (dollars)  
The interventions in the study add costs over standa rd of care.  It is important to evaluate 
the burden on the health care system  in addition to subject outcomes. 
 
 Quality of Life: Short-Form-8 Health Survey (Rand Health)  
A change in quality of life before and after surgery will assessed.  This survey is limited 
by subject adheren ce to completion. 
5.3 Safety Evaluations 
All subjects will be monitore d for cardiac arrhythmias with continuous cardiac telemetry 
throughout the entirety of their hospitalization per standard postoperative care.  If cardiac 
arrhythmias occur, they will be managed by the surgery inpatient team and cardiology 
consultation if deemed necessary.  
 The mental status of each s ubject will be assessed daily by the surgery inpatient team and 
each shift (every 12 hours) by the nursing st aff.  Workup and mana gement of altered 
mental status is at the di scretion of the surgery team.  
 Surgical wounds will be monitored daily by the surgery inpatient team and each shift 
(every 12 hours) by the nursing staff.  Eviden ce of hypersensitivity reaction will be treated 
with observation, antihistamines, and/or epinephrine depending upon the severity of 
reaction.  The minimum duration of inpatient monito ring is 24 hours. For subjects that are 
discharged on POD1 after 24 hours of monito ring, a safety assessment will be performed 
by telephone on POD2.  If subject answers “Yes” to any of the questions, the subject will 
be brought into clinic fo r further evaluation.  See POD2 Safety Assessment below for more 
information.

 Adverse events will be assessed continuously, st arting with the first patient enrollment and 
until study completion, and will be immediately reported to the Medical Monitor.  Serious 
and severe adverse events, regardless of cau sality, will be follow ed until resolution or 
stabilization per Section 11 below.  Subjects will be discharged with specialized  discharge instructions to alert them of 
potential adverse effects and instru ct them when to  call the clinic. 
 
POD2 Safety Assessment  The safety assessment will be conducted ove r the phone on POD2 for subjects that were 
discharged on POD1.  If the subject answers “yes” to any of these questions, the event 
will be recorded as an AE and the patient w ill be brought into clinic for further evaluation.

 8 STUDY TREATMENTS 
8.1 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
80 eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to intraoperative inte rcostal nerve blocks 
and wound infiltration by Standard Bupivacaine  or Liposomal Bupivacaine in a 1:1 ratio 
with varying block size (4-8) using Stata 15.1 (College Station, TX) ralloc.ado package.  
When the subject arrives in the operating ro om, the surgeon/study doctor will contact the 
pharmacy who will determine treatment as signment and prepare the medication as 
outlined in Sections 8.3-8.4. 
8.2 Blinding 
All patients will be blinded to the treatment  groups as they will receive the one-time 
treatment while under general anes thesia in the operating room. 
All study staff will be blinded to the treat ment groups, except t hose staff involved in 
assigning treatment groups.  Access to the rando mization code will be strictly controlled.  
The study blind will be broken on completion of the clinical study and after the study 
database has been locked.   
Investigators will be blinded to the medical treatment groups - Standard Bupivacaine and 
Liposomal Bupivacaine.  As St andard Bupivacaine is clear and Liposomal Bupivacaine is 
milky white, obscuring over-wraps will be placed over syringe.  See Section 8.3-8.3.2 for more information. 
During the study, the blind may be broken only  in emergencies when knowledge of the 
patient’s treatment group is necessary for furt her patient management.  If this occurs, the 
investigator will contact the study staff involved in assigning treatment groups, and the 
blind will be broken.  When possible, the inve stigator should discu ss the emergency with 
the Medical Monitor prior to unblinding.

11 ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPO RTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
11.1 Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product an d that does not necess arily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorab le and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), sy mptom or disease temporally associated 
with the administration of an investigationa l product, whether or not related to that 
investigational product.  An unexpected AE is one of a ty pe not identified in nature, 
severity, or frequency in the current Investig ator’s Brochure or of greater severity or 
frequency than expected based on the inform ation in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
The Investigator will probe, via discussion w ith the subject, for th e occurrence of AEs 
during each subject visit and record the information in the site’s source documents.  
Adverse events will be recorded in the patien t CRF.  Adverse events will be described by 
duration (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome , treatment and relation to 
study drug, or if unrelated, the cause. 
AE Severity The National Cancer Institute’s Common Te rminology Criteria fo r Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 3.0 will be used to assess an d grade AE severity, including laboratory 
abnormalities judged to be  clinically significant.  The modified criteria can be found in the 
study manual.  If the experience is not covered in the modifi ed criteria, the guidelines 
shown in Table 1 below should be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed out that the 
term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily serious. 
Kratz, Johannes R. Confidential 
 
Version #: 9.0 Version Date: 11/5/2019 Pa ge 25 of 37 
 Table 1.  AE Severity Grading 
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1) Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The subject may be aware of the sign or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well. 
Moderate (2) Mild to moderate limita tion in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required. 
Severe (3) Marked limitation in activity,  medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospitalizations possible. 
Life-threatening (4) The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it 
occurred. This does not refer to an experience that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
 
AE Relationship to Study Drug The relationship of an AE to the study dr ug should be assessed using the following the 
guidelines in Table 2. 
Table 2.  AE Relationship to Study Drug 
Relationship 
to Drug  Comment  
Definitely Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by stopping or reducing the dosage of the drug; and that is not explained by any other reasonable hypothesis. 
Probably An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected respon se pattern to the suspected drug; that is 
confirmed by stopping or reducing the dosage of the drug; and that is unlikely to be explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state or by other interventions. 
Possibly An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors. 
Unrelated An event that can be determined with  certainty to have no relationship to the study 
drug. 
11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE) 
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at a ny dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
 death 
 a life-threatening a dverse experience 
 inpatient hospitalization or prol ongation of existing hospitalization 
 a persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
Kratz, Johannes R. Confidential 
 
Version #: 9.0 Version Date: 11/5/2019 Pa ge 26 of 37 
  a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical even ts may also be considered an SAE when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardi ze the subject or requi re intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed.  
11.2.1  Serious Adverse Experience Reporting 
The study site will document all SAEs that oc cur (whether or not related to study drug) 
per UCSF CHR Guidelines .  The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed 
consent is obtained and end after procedures fo r the final study visit have been completed. 
In accordance with the standard operating proced ures and policies of the local Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), the si te investigator will report 
SAEs to the IRB/IEC.   
11.3 Protocol Defined Important Medical Fi ndings Requiring Real  Time Reporting 
The following medical findings that occur will require real time reporting by the inpatient 
surgical team to the medical monitoring team: 
 Cardiovascular: Bradycardia,  Heart Block, Ventricular Ar rhythmia, and/or Cardiac 
Arrest requiring intervention 
 Neurologic: Seizure 
 Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis 
 Death

 replacing.  DMC members must not have any real or perceived sc ientific, financial, 
professional, personal, proprieta ry, or other conflict of inte rest related to the conduct, 
outcome, or impact of the study.   
Review of Safety Data  
The primary charge of the DMC is to monitor the study for participant safety.  The safety 
and related data the DMC will review includes,  
 Participant recruitment, accrual, retention, and w ithdrawal information  
 Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)   
o Tabulated by body system, intensity,  seriousness, duration, treatment 
given, and the relationship to the study drug and study procedure  
o Comparison of events that occur between treatment arms  
o Individual events of particular concern  
In particular, the following are adverse events of special interest pe rtinent to Liposomal 
Bupivacaine and Standard Bupivacaine: 
 Nausea, emesis, and/or constipation and are expected to occur in >10% of 
subjects.   
 Less common adverse events include di zziness, altered mental status, and 
hypersensitivity reactions with ur ticaria and/or pruritis.   
 Very rare, but serious adverse events incl ude neurologic toxicity with seizures and 
apnea, cardiac toxicity w ith atrioventricula r nodal conduction a bnormalities and 
cardiac arrest, and hypersensitivity  reaction with anaphylaxis.   
SAEs must be reported by the I nvestigator to the DMC Chair.  
Review of Other Data  
- Effectiveness  
The DMC monitors effectiveness outcomes to de termine relative risk/benefit, futility, or 
for early termination due to overwhelming effectiveness.  
- Study Conduct  
The DMC reviews data related to study conduct.   Data to be review ed and listed in the 
DMC reports regarding study conduct include s: summary of prot ocol violations, 
completeness and timeliness of study visit da ta, enrollment eligibility and ineligibility 
information, noncompliance, unanticipated pr oblems, information c oncerning withdrawal 
of participants.  The DMC may issue r ecommendations regarding study conduct when 
concerns arise that aspects of study conduct may threaten participant safety or study 
integrity.  
DMC Meetings  
- Projected Schedule of Meetings   
An initial meeting of the DMC will be held pr ior to any participant enrollment in order for 
the members to review the charter, form an understanding of the prot ocol and definitions 
being used, establish a distribution and meet ing schedule, review the study modification 
and/or termination guidelines , and finalize format and prot ocol-specified statistical 
Kratz, Johannes R. Confidential 
 
Version #: 9.0 Version Date: 11/5/2019 Pa ge 30 of 37 
 methods to be used in reports to be consid ered by the DSMB.  Subsequent DMC meetings 
will be held to review at 1/3 and 2/3 goal en rollment, and at the conclusion of the study.  
- Ad Hoc Meetings  
An ad hoc meeting of the DMC may be called at any time if immanen t participant safety 
issues arise.  If a significa nt safety concern arises dur ing the study, the DMC Chair may 
convene a meeting to review safety and any ot her aspect of the study.  Significant safety 
events may include, but are not  limited to, the following:  
 A death or life-threatening condition sustained by a pa rticipant, re gardless of 
causality  
 An unexpected serious safety issue ne wly identified duri ng the development 
program that could expose part icipants to unnecessary risks  
 Any other concern regarding particip ant safety raised by any DMC member  
- Meeting Format  
DMC meetings will be conducted in person.  
- Voting  
DMC recommendations will be agreed upon by form al majority vote.  In event of a split 
vote, the DMC Chair will cast the deciding vote.  
- Stopping Rules  
The DMC will determine whether the study s hould continue as planned, proceed with 
modifications, or be terminated.  The justifi cation to terminate the study may be due to the 
DMC's analysis that there is overwhelming effectiveness, futil ity, or safety issues.  If the 
DMC votes to terminate the study, a final study report will be made.  
15 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS 
Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will 
be written describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any modifications to the analysis  plan described below.   
15.1 Data Sets Analyzed 
All eligible patients who are randomized into  the study and receive the intervention will 
be included in the analysis.  
15.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
The following demographic variables at screen ing will be summarized: age, gender, race 
and ethnicity, height, weight, comorbid conditions, smoking hist ory, lung function, 
indication for surgery, pr ior thoracic surgery. 
15.3 Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in cumula tive in-hospital use of opioids in 
subjects who receive intercostal nerv e block and wound infiltration Liposomal 
Bupivacaine or Standard Bupivacaine dur ing minimally invasive lung resection. 
Kratz, Johannes R. Confidential 
 
Version #: 9.0 Version Date: 11/5/2019 Pa ge 31 of 37 
 Student’s t-test will be used to assess the me ans of the cumulative total of in-hospital oral 
morphine equivalents.  It is presumed that the data will be normally distributed.  If this 
assumption is not met, transformation or nonparametric tests (Ma nn-Whitney U test) will 
be used.  Moreover, as there are only 40 subj ects per group, it is po ssible that we do not 
achieve effective randomization.  If this occurs, we will ut ilize linear regression adjusting 
for age, sex, race, comorbidity, diagnosis, and procedure performed.  A power of 0.8 and 2-sided alpha error set at 0.05 will be used  to assess for statistical significance. 
15.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
 Cumulative Daily In-Hospital Pain Score (0-10)  
 Mean Time to First Opioid Use (hours)  
 Mean Time to Ambulation (hours)  
 Pulmonary Complications: Pneumonia and Atelectasis requiring Bronchoscopy (y/n)  
 Liposomal Bupivacaine and Stand B upivacaine Adverse Events (y/n):  
- Gastrointestinal- nausea, emesis, constipation  
- Hypersensitivity- pruritis, urticaria, anaphylaxis  
- Cardiac- atrioventricular heart block, cardiac arrest  
- Neurologic- dizziness, altere d mental status, seizure  
- Miscellaneous  
Safety and tolerability data will be summarized by treatment group.  Adverse event 
rates will be coded by body system and will include the number of patients for whom 
the event occurred, the rate of  occurrence, and the sever ity and relationship to study 
drug.  
 Length of Stay (days)  
 Total Opioid Prescription at Disc harge (morphine e quivalents in mg)  
 Total Opioid Use as Outpatient (morphine equivalents in mg)  
 Direct Costs of hospita l encounter (dollars)  
 Quality of life – Short-Form-8 Health Survey (Optum Health)  
Student’s t-test, Pearson’s chi-squared test, and Kaplan-Meier survival estimate will be 
used.  A 2-sided alpha error set at 0.05 will be used to assess for statistical significance.  
15.5 Interim Analysis 
There will be interim reviews conducted by the DMC for the purpose of monitoring study 
conduct and assessing patient safety at 1/3 and 2/3 goal enrollment.  Blinding will be maintained.  An O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function with symmetric stopping 
boundaries for benefit and harm will be uti lized.  If the stopping boundaries have been 
reached (absolute value of z-value >3), the da ta will be unblinded for review and the trial 
will be terminated.  Finally, there also will be consideration of terminating trial if there is 
consensus of futility.

 15.6 Sample Size and Randomization 
80 Subjects will be randomized to 1:1 to Lipos omal Bupivacaine or Standard Bupivacaine 
by varying block size (4-8).  80 subjects will provide 80% power to detect a statistically 
significant effect with 2-side d alpha error set at 0.05 if the measured effect is 19% 
absolute reduction in cumulative daily in-hospital use of opioids.   
The mean daily in-hospital usag e of opioids is 35mg morphine  equivalents with standard 
deviation of 12mg.  This was estimated by review of prev iously published studies and 
corroboration with UCSF clini cal practice patterns [12].  A 19% absolute reduction in 
cumulative daily in-hospital use of opioids corresponds to 1 fewer oxycodone dose per 
day, which was considered the minimum clinically significant effect. 
16 DATA COLLECTION, RETENTI ON AND MONITORING 
16.1 Data Collection Instruments 
The Investigator will prepare and maintain  adequate and accurate source documents 
designed to record all observations and other pe rtinent data for each subject treated with the 
study drug.   
Study personnel will enter data from source documents corresponding to a subject’s visit 
into the protocol-specific el ectronic Case Report Form (eCRF) in REDCap when the 
information corresponding to that visit is ava ilable.  If a correction is required for an 
eCRF, the time and date stamps track the person entering or updating eCRF data and 
creates an electronic audit trail.  The Shor t Form 8 Health Survey and Pain Medication 
Survey will be administered and recorded as a REDCap survey. 
The Investigator is responsible for all inform ation collected on subjects enrolled in this 
study.  All data collected during the course of this study must be reviewed and verified for 
completeness and accuracy by the Investigator .  A copy of the CRF will remain at the 
Investigator’s site at th e completion of the study. 
16.2 Data Management Procedures 
The data will be entered into REDCap.  Th e Data Management group will be responsible 
for data processing, in accordance with pro cedural documentation.  Database lock will 
occur once quality assurance procedures have been completed. 
All procedures for the handling and analys is of data will be conducted using good 
computing practices meeting F DA guidelines for the handling and analysis of data for 
clinical trials. 
16.3 Data Quality Control and Reporting 
After data have been entered into the study database, a system of computerized data 
validation checks will be implemented and app lied to the database on a regular basis.  
Queries are entered, tracked, and resolved th rough the EDC system directly.  The study 
database will be updated in accordance with the resolved queries.  All changes to the 
study database will be documented. 
Kratz, Johannes R. Confidential 
 
Version #: 9.0 Version Date: 11/5/2019 Pa ge 33 of 37 
 16.4 Archival of Data 
The database is safeguarded against una uthorized access by established security 
procedures.  Appropriate backup copies of the database and related so ftware files will be 
maintained.  Databases are backed up by the database administrato r in conjunction with 
any updates or changes to the database.   
At critical junctures of the protocol (e.g., pr oduction of interim reports  and final reports), 
data for analysis is locked and cleaned per established procedures. 
16.5 Availability and Retention of Investigational Records 
The Investigator must make study data accessible to the monitor, other authorized 
representatives of the IRB/IEC and Regul atory Agency (e.g., FDA) inspectors upon 
request.  A file for each subj ect must be maintained that includes the signed Informed 
Consent, HIPAA Authorization and copies of  all source documentation related to that 
subject.  The Investigator must ensure the reliability and availability of source documents 
from which the information on the CRF was derived. 
All study documents (patient fi les, signed informed consent forms, copies of CRFs, Study 
File Notebook, etc.) must be ke pt secured for a period of two years after centers have been 
notified that the IND has been  discontinued.  There may be other circumstances for which 
the Sponsor is required to maintain study r ecords and, therefore, the Sponsor should be 
contacted prior to removing study records for any reason. 
16.6 Monitoring 
By signing this protocol, the Investigator gr ants permission to the appropriate regulatory 
authorities to conduct on-site monitoring and/or auditing of all appropriate study 
documentation. 
16.7 Subject Confidentiality 
In order to maintain subject confidentiality, al l protected health information is stored in 
REDCap. 
17 ADMINISTRATIVE, ETHICAL, REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 
The study will be conducted according to th e Declaration of Helsinki, Protection of 
Human Volunteers (21 CFR 50), Institutio nal Review Boards (21 CFR 56), and 
Obligations of Clinical I nvestigators (21 CFR 312). 
All study records will be stored on REDCap that  contains a firewall with a secure server 
that is backed up regularly off-site.  Clini cal information will not be released without 
written permission of the subject, except as necessary for monitoring.  The Investigator 
must also comply with all applicable pr ivacy regulations (e.g.,  Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC). 
17.1 Protocol Amendments

eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients may be implemented immediately, provided the IRBs are notified within five working days. 
17.2 Institutional Review Boards and Independent Ethics Committees 
The protocol and consent form will be re viewed and approved by the IRB/IEC of each 
participating center prior to study initiation.  Serious adverse experiences regardless of 
causality will be reported to the IRB/IE C in accordance with the standard operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB/IEC, a nd the Investigator will keep the IRB/IEC 
informed as to the progress of the study.  The Investigator will obtain assurance of 
IRB/IEC compliance with regulations. 
Any documents that the IRB/IEC may need to fulfill its respon sibilities (suc h as protocol, 
protocol amendments, Investigator’s Brochur e, consent forms, in formation concerning 
patient recruitment, payment or compensation procedures, or other pe rtinent information) 
will be submitted to the IRB/IEC.  The I RB/IECs written unconditional approval of the 
study protocol and the informed consent form will be in the possession of the Investigator 
before the study is initiated.  The IRB/IE Cs unconditional approval statement will be 
transmitted by the Investigator to the Sponsor .  This approval must refer to the study by 
exact protocol title and number and should id entify the documents re viewed and the date 
of review. 
Protocol and/or informed cons ent modifications or changes may not be initiated without 
prior written IRB/IEC approval except when ne cessary to eliminate immediate hazards to 
the patients or when the change(s) involves onl y logistical or adminis trative aspects of the 
study.  Such modifications will be submitted to  the IRB/IEC and written verification that 
the modification was submitted and subse quently approved shoul d be obtained.   
The IRB/IEC must be informed of revisions to other documents orig inally submitted for 
review; serious and/or unexpected advers e experiences occurring during the study in 
accordance with the standard operating pro cedures and policies of the IRB; new 
information that may affect adve rsely the safety of the patient s of the conduct of the study; 
an annual update and/or request for re-appr oval; and when the study has been completed.

2.INTRODUCTION
Protocol A0081105 is a randomized, double- blind, parallel -group, placebo-controlled, 
multi -center trial in subjects 5 to 65 years of age with PGTC seizures. This study will
evaluate the efficacy of 2 dose levels of pregab alin [Dose Level 1: pregabalin 
5 mg/kg/day (maximum 300 mg/day) or Dose Level 2: pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day 
(maximum 600 mg/day), administered BID ] compared with placebo.
2.1.Study Design
This study wi ll consist of an 8- week baseline phase, a 12 -week double -blind assessment 
phase (including a 2 -week double -blind dose escalation phase and a 10 -week double -
blind fixed dose phase), and a 1- week double -blind taper phase.   Eligible subjects will be 
randomly assigned to receive double -blind treatment with 1 of 2 dose levels of pregabalin 
or placebo.  Study drug treatments are to be taken orally twice daily (BID) in equally 
divided doses for 12 weeks during the double -blind assessment phase and t hen 1 week 
double -blind taper.  Subjects who complete the double -blind phase of this trial may be 
eligible for screening for a 1- year open -label pregabalin safety study.
A total sample size of 168 subjects (ie, 56 subjects per group) is needed to have been 
randomized, r eceived treatment and had a baseline and post baseline efficacy 
assessment. Randomization will be stratified by site and subject age (Stratum 1: 5-7 years 
of age; Stratum
2: 8-11 years of age; Stratum 3: 12 -16 years of age; Stratum 4: 
17-65 years of age). Subjects in each age stratum within site will be randomized to a 
fixed dose of either placebo, Dose Level 1: pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day (maximum 
300 mg/day) or Dose Level 2: pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day (maximum 600mg/day) in a 
1:1:1 ratio.  Approximately 30% of p lanned enrollment (approximately 50 subjects) will 
be subjects <17 years of age.  Every reasonable effort will be made to enroll a minimum 
of 12 subjects in each of the 4 age strata.

2.2.Statistical Power and Sample Size
A total sample size estimate of 168 subjects allo ws for the evaluation of efficacy using the 
primary endpoint, log e(28-day seizure rate + 1), for making comparisons between 
placebo vs. 5 mg/kg/day pregabalin (maximum 300 mg/day; Dose Level 1), and placebo 
vs. 10 mg/kg/day (maximum 600 mg/day; Dose Level 2) pregabalin groups for the 
treatment period of the study.  The following sample size assumptions and corresponding 
power calculations are provided in Table 1below.  This sample size will also allow for a 
genera l assessment of safety and tolerability.

placebo based on a meta -analysis of Studies 1008- 009, 1008 -011, and 1008 -034 based on the log 
transformed 28 day seizure rate, with 300 mg/day only in St udy1008 -034.
The primary statistical analysis will model the log transformed 28 day seizure rate, and 
compare each dose of pregabalin to placebo in a step- wise manner, starting with the 
highest dose of pregabalin.  Since there is a significant dose respo nse of pregabalin, the 
power to detect expected differences for each pregabalin dose relative to placebo will be 
different.  Hence, this step
-wise testing procedure will provide maximum power as well 
as control for multiplicity of testing at the desired 0.05 level of significance for the 
primary analysis.
Based on a meta -analysis of double -blind placebo controlled adult adjunctive therapy 
studies (Studies 1008 -009, 1008 -
011, and 1008-034) using the log transformed 28 day 
seizure rate, the expected differenc es from placebo (ie, the difference in the observed 
least squares means after adjusting out the study -to-study differences and site clustering 
within study effects) were -0.668 ( -48.7%) and 
-0.448 ( -36.1%) for 600 mg/day 
(Dose Level 2) and 300 mg/day (Dose Level 1), respectively.  This study is powered on 
80% of these estimated treatment differences; - 0.534 ( -41.4%) and -0.358 ( -30.1%) for 
600 mg/day (Dose Level 2) and 300 mg/day (Dose Level 1), respectively.
A meta- analysis of Studies 1008 -009, 1008-011, and 1008-034 was used to estimate a 
pooled standard deviation of 0.73 on the log transformed 28 day seizure rate scale, with 
a 95% confidence interval of [0.70, 0.76 ].  For the purposes of this study, a smaller 
standard deviation of 0.67 was used to assess the power and initial sample size 
requirements for comparing the 2 pregabalin group to placebo.  The rationale for 
assuming the smaller SD of 0.67 is based on the Study 1008
-034 data which included all 
three treatment groups of interest (i.e., placebo, 300 mg/day, and 600 mg/day).  This 
study had a point estimate for the standard deviation of 0.72 and a 95% confidence 
interval for the standard deviation of [0.67, 0.77] .
To ensure that the sample size is reasonably sufficient using an assumed pooled standard
deviation of 0.67 on the log escale, in order to provide at least 80% power to detect a

procedure ( Friede and Keiser, 2011 )3based upon a residual variance of ANCOVA under 
the null hypothesis will be applied when approximately the first 110 subjects in total have 
had the opportunity to complete the study (ie, no ongoing subjects will be included in this 
sample size re -estimation pr
ocedure).  The blinded sample size re -estimation procedure 
for this study will not allow for a reduction in the planned sample size of 56 subjects per 
group or an increase in sample size greater than 65 subjects per group (195 subjects 
total).  T his repres ents the sample size required to provide 80% power to detect a 
treatment difference of -0.358 on the log scale with a standard deviation of 0.72.  The 
sample size also allows for operational feasibility. Details regarding the statistical 
methodology of the blinded sample size re -estimation procedure will be documented in 
Appendix 6.  This blinded sample size re -estimation procedure will be conducted by a 
statistician who is not associated with the conduct or final analysis of the study.
There will be no penalty applied to the p
-values or confidence intervals for assessing 
treatment difference from placebo due to this blinded sample size re -estimation 
procedure.

reported separat elyfrom the main clinical study  report.
3.INTERIM ANALYSES, FI NAL ANALYSES AND UNB LINDING 
3.1.Interim Safety Analysis
In additional to the regular revi ew of blinded safety data during the conduct of the study, 
as described in the “Safety Analysis” section, 2 unblinded Interim Safety Analyses (ISA) 
to be reviewed by an E -DMC will be conducted to further assess safety.  The timing of the 
first ISA will be w hen the first one -third of the subjects enrolled (randomized) has had an 
opportunity to complete the study.  The second ISA will be performed when 
approximately two -thirds of the subjects enrolled (randomized) have had an opportunity 
to complete the study .  
The I SA will involve the descriptive review of deaths, SAEs, discontinuations due to 
AEs, and discontinuations due to the following 4 events:
1. An episode of status epilepticus during the 12- week double -blind assessment 
phase.
2.A 28
-day seizure rate for a ll PGTC seizures during the 12- week double -blind 
assessment phase that is greater than 2-times the maximum 28- day study seizure 
rate during the baseline phase (a 28 -day period is defined as 4 consecutive study 
weeks).
3.An episode of a newly emergent generalized seizure type during the 12- week 
double -blind assessment phase.
4. An increase in the rate or intensity of PGTC or other generalized seizure activity 
during the 12- week double -blind assessment phase that, according to the 
investigator, is clinically signi ficant.
The I SA will not include any  anal ysis for efficacy  and therefore no t ype I error (alpha) 
spending penalty  applies.
An External Data Monitoring Committee (E -DMC) will conduct this unblinded interim 
safet y analysis and provide recommendation to the s ponsor.  An E- DMC Charter will 
specify  the details of how the safety interim analyses are to be conducted, and how

Protocol A0081105 Statistical Analy sis Plan
Statistical Analysis Plan Version 3.0 Page 12of 39communications between the sponsor and the E -DMC will take place through open and 
closed meeting sessions. Additionally , the Charter will ad dress the confidentiality  of the 
interim safet y information and appropriate measures will be taken to minimize bias so 
that the integrity of the study is protected.
3.2.Final Analysis and Unblinding 
Blinding codes should only be used for an individual subject and the blind broken only in 
an emergency situation or when it is critical to guide treatment and care of a given 
subject for reasons of subject safety.  At the initiation of the study, the study site will be 
instructed on the method for breaking the blind for an individual subject.  The method 
will be either a manual or electronic process.  When breaking the blind is required the 
investigator should contact Pfizer before breaking the blind if possible.  W hen the 
blinding code is broken for a subject, the reason must be fully documented and entered 
on the appropriate case report form.
The unblinding for the final anal ysiswill follow standard Pfizer procedures. 
4.HYPOTHESES AND DECIS ION RULES 
4.1.Statistical Hypotheses
There will be 2 pair -wise comparisons of i nterest: 
a)Dose Level 2: pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day (maximum 600 mg/day) -placebo, and
b)Dose Level 1: pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day (maximum 300 mg/day) -placebo.
Each dose of pregabalin will be compared to placebo in a pair -wise manner using a 
sequential step -wise testing procedure to control for multiplicity of testing such that the 
experiment -wise type I error rate will not exceed the 5% level of significance.
1) The first step will test the null hypothesis of equal treatment effect of Dose Level 2 vs. 
placebo at =0.05 2- sided for the primary endpoint.
H01:  µPGB Dose Level 2 -µPBO= 0
Ha1:  µPGB Dose Level 2 -µPBO≠ 0

6.1.Efficac y Endpoint(s)
For all 28-day log seizure endpoints, the results will be reported as “percent reduction in 
seizures” relative to placebo. For example, a difference between one of the pregabalin 
doses and placebo of - 0.400 on the log transformed scale for th e 28-day seizure rate 
translates into a 33% reduction in the 28- day seizure rate of the pregabalin group from 
the placebo group (ie, 100%*[exp -0.400-1]= -33%).  The “percent reduction in seizures” 
will be calculated for changes versus placebo on the follow ing statistics: the two -sided 
95% confidence intervals, the least square means and their standard errors .
An additional back transformation will be calculated for percent reduction in seizures for 
each pregabalin treatment group relative to placebo for pr esentation as follows: 
6.1.1. Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint will be the log- transformed (log e) 28-day seizure rate for all PGTC 
seizures collected during the double- blind assessment phase ( not including the 1 -week 
double -blind taper phase) .  The 28 -day seizure rate will be calculated as follows for the 
double -blind assessment phase:
28-day seizure rate =# of seizures in the double -blind assessment phase of study28[# of days in period -# of missing diary days in period]
When the l og-transformation is used, the quantity “1” is added to the 28 -day seizure rate 
for all subjects to account for any possible "0" seizure incidence.  This will result in the 
following primary efficacy endpoint: log e(28-day seizure rate + 1). 
The 28- day sei zure rate for all PGTC seizures collected during the baseline phase will be 
calculated similarly.
6.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoint
Responder Rate, defined as subjects who have a 50% reduction in the 28 -day seizure 
rate for all PGTC seizures during the double-blind assessment phase, as measured from 
baseline (data collected during the 8
-week baseline phase) will be defined as a responder, 
otherwise they  be considered as a non -responder.
The responder rate will be based on the percentage change from baseline in t he 12 -
week 
double -blind treatment phase 28- day seizure rate , which is defined as follow s :
% Change = [(28 -day seizure rate t – 28- day seizure rate b) / 28 -day seizure rate b] × 100%,
where t is the 12- week double -blind treatment phase and b is for the 8- week baseline 
phase.

6.1.3.1. Proportion of S eizure -Free Days
The proportion of seizure -free days for each seizure type: PGTC, myoclonic, tonic/atonic, 
absence, and clonic seizures will be computed. Proportion of PGTC seizure -free daysis 
defined as number of seizure -free day s in a period divided by  “number of day s in a period
-number of missing Seizure diary  days”.
6.1.3.2. Number of 
Seizure -Free Days G ained
The number of seizure -free days gained for each seizure type: PGTC, myoclonic, 
tonic/atonic, abse nce, and clonic seizures will be calculated.  The number of seizure -free 
days will be adjusted to a per 12 weeks value (ie, 84 days) for the baseline and 12- week 
double -blind assessment phases.  Changes from baseline are to be computed and the 
analysis performed accordingly. The 12 week adjusted number of seizure -free day sis 
defined as follows:
number of seizure -free day s in a period * 84 / (number of day s in a period –number of 
missing diary  days in a period) .
Period r efersto the length time in baselin e, and in DB.  The 12 week adjusted number of 
seizure -free days will be calculated for baseline andDB; change from baseline will also 
be calculated.
6.1.3.3. Proportion of S ubjects with PGTC S eizure -Freedom
The proportion of subjects with PGTC seizure -freedom will be computed.  The numerator 
for seizure -freedom is defined as the number of subjects that experience no PGTC 
seizures over the last 28 days of the double- blind assessment phase (must be a minimum 
of 4weeks ), patient must have received at least 42 day s (2weeks + 28 day s) of study  
medication and have a minimum of 21 of the last 28 day s as non -missing diary (ignore 
the first 2 weeks from dose escalation phase) .The denominator is the 
number of subjects 
in the ITT population with 42 day s (2 weeks + 28 day s) of study  medication .
The proportion of subjects with PGTC seizure -freedom over the entire double blind fixed 
dose assessment phase will also be computed. The numerator for seizure -freedom is 
defined as the number of subjects that experience no PGTC seizure s over the fixed dose 
phase, patient must have received at least 84 day s (2 weeks + 14 +28 +28 day s)dosing
and have a minimum of 11 of the 14 day s and 21 of each of the two28 day periods with 
non-missing seizure diary (ignore the first 2 weeks from dose escalation phase) .The

development , and reporte d separate from the main clinical study  report .
6.2.Safety Endpoints
Safety  endpoints include adverse event data (eg, occurrence, nature, intensity , and 
relationship to study  drug), Hy ’s law, vital signs, weight, clinical laboratory  assessments, 
ECG, neurologi cal examination, phy sical examination, prior and concomitant 
medications, suicidal ideation and behavior assessments (as age appropriate).
6.2.1. Adverse Events
All AEs occurring during the course of the study  will be coded using the MedDRA 
coding dictionary .  
All AEs (serious and non -serious) reported from the first day  of study  treatment through 
and including 999 calendar day s after the last administration of the study  drug will be 
considered treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs). 
6.2.2. Prior and Concomitant Treatments and Medications
Concomitant and prior medications, defined as medications stopped, ongoing or started 
on or after the first day  of study  treatment up to the last dose of study  treatment, will be 
summarized, using the WHO -drug coding dictionary . In addition, c oncomitant and prior 
non-drug treatments/procedures will be summarized using the MedDRA coding

6.2.3.
Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Assessments During the Clinical Trial
C-SSRS responses will be mapped to the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suic ide 
Assessment (C -CASA). (see Appendix 2)
The following 3 endpoints are for suicidality  data anal ysis and evaluation: 
Suicidal Behavior ;
Suicidal I deation ;
Suicidal Behavior or Ideation .
Suicidal behavior : A subject is said to have suicidal behavior if the subject has 
experienced an y of the following events (C -CASA event codes 1- 3): 
Completed suicide;
Suicide attempt; or
Preparatory  acts toward imminent suicidal behavior.

Statistical Analysis Plan Version 3.0 Page 17of 39Suicidal ideation : Any  observed suicidal ideation maps to a single C- CASA category .   
The C -SSRS, for example, includes five ideation questions (that map to C- CASA 
category  4) with increasing severit y.    
Subjects with new onset suicidal ideation and behavior : A subject will be considered to 
have a new onset of suicidal ideation and behavior if the subject reported no ideation and 
no behavior at the baseline assessment (note that self
-injurious behavior, no suicidal 
intent [C -CASA code 7] is not considered to be suicidal ideation or behavior) a nd 
reported an y behavior or ideation post- baseline.  Data observed at screening is not 
considered in the definition of new onset.
Subjects with worsening suicidal ideation and behavior relative to baseline : A subject 
will be considered to have a worsening of suicidal ideation and behavior if the subject 
moved to a lower numbered C -CASA category  (observed in categories 1 -4) than was 
reported at baseline.  Movement within C- CASA categories 5 -9 would not be considered 
worsening.  In addition, worsening will be considered within the suicide ideation 
C-CASA category  4 if there is an increase in severity  identified in the C -SSRS which 
captures additional granularity  on suicide ideation. A subject who reports only  ideation at 
baseline and who reports any  behavior post -baseline is considered to have worsened.  
Data observed at screening is not considered in the definition of worsening.

efficacy  endpoint as a sensitivity analy sis. This age group definition will also be used to 
investigate treatment- by-age interaction for the primary  efficacy  endpoint.
Age will be defined as subjects’ age at randomization. If a subject turns 66 at 
randomization after screening, he/she will be counted in the 17- 65 age group.
Region will be defined as follows (Upon closing of the randomization, region 
determinations will be further evaluated -Seecontingency  plan):
United States (US) : Subjects who participate in the U.S . or Puerto Rico centers 
will be pooled together;
European Union: All subjects who participate in Europe an Union (eg, Austria, 
Belgium, Denmark, France, German y, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, 
Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary , Lithuania ,Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, ) centers will be pooled

Federation, Ukraine ,Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina ,Serbia ,Montenegro,
Turkey ) centers will be pooled together .
Any region not enroll ingany subjects will not be included in the anal ysis.
7.HANDLING OF MISSING VALUES
Missing data will be handled based on the nature of the endpoint and the proposed 
statistical methods for analy zing the data.  
For all endpoints that include seizure rate, day s with missing seizure diary  data will be 
subtracted from the seizure rate calcula tions. If seizure rate for an y phase cannot be 
calculated for a subject due to missing information, the endpoint that involves seizure rate 
during that phase will be also missing for that subject.
For scales used in this study , scores will be imputed according to the imputation rules and 
algorithms for missing component scores that are provided in the data standard 
documents. Partial dates for AEs and concomitant medications will be imputed 
according to Pfizer standard algorithms.

the following windows and drop- out categories:
Windowing for each subject will be constructed for the 1stmonth, 2ndmonth, and 
3rdmonth the subject was in the study. Thus a 28 -day seizure rate will be 
determined for each windowed month for which seizure data exist, otherwise the 
seizure data will be considered missing with a corresponding reason for it being 
missing. Specific details are provided in Appendix 3.
Drop -out patterns will be constructed based on the reason the seizure data is 
missing for the corresponding windowed month. Hence, the following drop -out 
patterns will be defined for three
specific categories of related to lack of efficacy 
or adverse eve ntor other reason :
Completed study as planned .
Drop -out due to lack of efficacy:
Drop -out at month 1 due to lack of efficacy ;
Drop -out at month 2 due lack of efficacy ;
Drop -out at month 3 due to lack of efficacy .
Drop -out due to an adverse event :
Drop -outat month 1 due to an adverse event ;
Drop -out at month 2 due to an adverse event ;
Drop -out at month 3 due to an adverse event .
Drop -out due to other reason :
Drop -out at month 1 due to other reason;
Drop -out at month 2 due to other reason;
Drop -out at month 3 due to other reason .
Other reason includes any drop -outs excluding efficacy  and adverse event.
These drop -out patterns will be summarized by treatment group to assess any imbalance 
using frequency counts. If there is a significant amount of missing dat a, then multiple 
imputation techniques will also be applied to the primary analysis model. However, if the 
amount of mis sing data is not significant (i e, less than 5% across all treatment group s),

STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES
The ITT population will be used in the anal yses of the primary  efficacy  endpoint, and for 
all other efficacy  endpoints. The Safet y population will be used in the analy ses of the 
safet y data.  
8.1.Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The primary efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint, log e(28-days seizure rate t+ 1) as 
defined in Section 6.1 of this document, will utilize a linear model with the following 
fixed effect terms:
A log etransformed baseline seizure rate log e(28-days seizure rate b+ 1) forall 
PGTC seizures , as a continuous covariate;
Age strata (Stratum 1: 5 -7 years of age; Stratum 2:8-11 years of a ge; Stratum 3: 
12-16 years of age; Stratum 4; 17- 65 years of age);
Geographic region (See Section 6.4) by  pooling of investigator centers;
Treatment group [placebo, Dose Level 1: pregabalin 5 mg/k g/day (maximum 
300
mg/day), Dose Level 2: pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day (maximum 600 mg/day) ].
There will be two pair -wise comparisons of interest: 
1) Dose Level 2: pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day  (maximum 600 mg/day ) -placebo, and
2) Dose Level 1: pregabalin 5 mg/kg /day (maximum 300 mg/day ) -placebo.
The difference in the least squares means and their standard errors for these two pair -wise 
comparisons will be used for constructing test statistics and two sided 95% confidence 
intervals. 
Each dose of pregabalin wil l be compared to placebo in a pair -wise manner using a 
sequential step -wise testing procedure to control for multiplicity of testing such that the 
experiment -wise type I error rate will not exceed the 5% level of significance:
1.The first step will test the null hypothesis of equal treatment effect of Dose Level 2 
vs. placebo at =0.05 2 -sided for the primary endpoint. 
If the null hypothesis of the first step is rejected, then proceed to the second step, 
otherwise accept the null hypothesis of the first step, stop further testing, and 
claim no treatment effect.

Dose Level 1 vs. placebo at =0.05 2 -sided for the primary endpoint.
If the null hypothesis of the second step is rejected, then claim a treatment difference 
for both dose groups of pregabalin [Dose Level 2: 10 mg/kg/day ( maximum 
600mg/day) and Dose Level 1: 5 mg/kg/day ( maximum 300 mg/day) ] from the 
placebo group for the primary endpoint only; otherwise accept the null hypothes is of 
the second step, stop further testing, and claim a treatment difference for only 
pregabalin Dose Level 2: 10 mg/kg/day ( maximum 600 mg/day) from placebo for the 
primary endpoint only.
The difference in the least squares means and their standard errors for these 2 
pair
-wise comparisons will be used for constructing test statistics and 2 -sided 95% 
confidence intervals.  Results will be reported as “percent reduction in seizures from 
baseline” relative to placebo.  For example, a difference between 1 of the pregabalin 
doses and placebo of -0.358 on the log -transformed scale for the 28 -day seizure rate, 
translates into a 30.1% reduction in the 28 -day seizure rate of the pregabalin group 
from the placebo group (ie, 100%*[exp-0.358-1]= -30.1% ]).
An additional back transformation will be calculated for percent reduction in seizures 
for each pregabalin treatment group relative to placebo for presentation as follows:
The 28- day seizure rate of log scale in the double -blind treatment phase will be 
summarized by  each month and the entire 12- weeks double -blind period for each 
treatment group, agegroup [pediatrics overall (<17 y ears) and adults (17- 65 years)], 
and geographic region.
Conti ngenc y plan for the primary  ANCOVA anal ysis model
If after unbli nding, the primary  ANCOVA anal ysis model as described above performs 
well without any issue s, the primary  anal ysis model will stay  as described above. 
However, in case of ANCOVA anal ysis issue s, for example, with convergence or missing 
cells in a particula r treatment within a region or within an age strata , the cause of the 
analysis model issue swill be mitigated , for example , as follows :
If a small region, say  US region, causes the model issue alone , the small region 
(say US region) will be pooled with European Union ; Other ANCOVA model 
terms will stay  as is;
If age strata causes the model issue alone , the age group (
5-16 years of age and 
17-65 years of age ) as described in Section 6.4 will be used instead of the age 
strata; Other ANCOVA model terms will stay  as is;

analysis will be performed with the small region (say  US region) pooled with 
Europe an Union and age group (instea d of age strata), Other ANCOVA model 
terms will stay  as is.
Other anal yses of continuous dependent variables with ANCOVA model will follow the 
same procedure as the primary  efficacy  endpoint analy sis. Responder rates and an y other 
binary  variables that use the same planned model as primary  efficacy  endpoint analy sis 
will similarly  be adjusted as needed.
Sensitivity  Anal ysis
As a sensitivity  anal ysis of the primary  endpoint, multiple imputation methods will be 
used to evaluate the impact of missing data ( SeeAppendix 4). 
Subjects who discontinue the study  for insufficient clinical response, adverse event, or 
death will be imputed based on the observed placebo distribution, regardless of 
randomized treatment assignment.  Imputatio n will be based on baseline log e(28-days 
seizure rate b+1), geographical region, baseline weight (continuous) , and age strata .
Subjects who discontinue the study  for other reasons, or who complete the study  but have 
a missing double blind seizure rate, will be imputed based on observed subjects in the 
same randomized treatment group.  Imputation will be based on treatment group , baseline 
log e(28-days seizure rate b+1), geographical region, baseline weight (continuous), and age 
strata .
A sensitivity  anal ysis will be performed using 
the same linear model as the primary  
efficacy analysisexcept for the age covariate , which will be applied for the 2age group s
(
5-16 years of age ; 17-65 years of age ) . 
Anadditional sensitivity  anal ysis will be performed using t he same linear model as the 
primary  efficacy analysis with two age group s covariate as well as pooled region of US 
and European Union.
A ranked ANCOVA will be performed for the change from baseline to double blind phase
of log -transformed (log e) 28-day sei zure rate for all PGTC seizures, including age strata, 
treatment group, and region.
A Wilcoxon -Mann Whitney test will also be performed and reported for the change from 
baseline to double blind phase of log -transformed (log e) 28-day seizure rate for all PG TC 
seizures .

A supplemental analysis will be performed to investigate generalizability of the treatment 
difference with respect to the 2 age categories (ie, a possible treatment -by-age 
interaction that is statistically and clinically relevant). The estimated seizure rate, 
standard error and the corresponding 95% confidence interval in addition to the treatment 
difference between each pregabalin treatment group and placebo will be calculated for 
both pediatric (5 -16 years of age) and a dult population (17- 65 years of age).  This 
supplemental anal ysis will also be a re -evaluation of the primary  anal ysis model with an 
interaction term for treatment- by-age.  This model will not replace the primary  model.    
As a supplemental analysis, a generalized linear model assuming a Poisson and negative 
binomial distribution
sand canonical log link function will be applied to the raw seizure 
counts.1, 2  The model will have an off -set parameter for the amount of time (i.e.,

Pearson will be specified to fit the Poisson distribution .
The analyses with Poisson and negative binomia l models will be performed with baseline 
seizure count as covariate . 
The raw 28 -day seizure rate will be summarized overall, and separately  byage group of

8.2.Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The secondary efficacy endpoint will be the responder rate, defined as the proportion of 
subjects who had at least a 50% reduction in the 28- day seizure rate for all PGTC 
seizures during the double-blind assessment phase, as measured from baseline (data 
collected during the 8 -week baseline phase) on the I TT population .  This secondary 
endpoint will be analyzed using a logistic regression model with the following fixed 
covariate terms: treatment, age stratum , and geographical region.  No adjustments for 
multi plicity will be taken, and nominal p -values from 2 -sided tests and the 
correspondence odds ratio with 95% confidence interval will be reported.
NOTE: The “PARAM=GL M”option in CL ASS statement of SAS will be applied for 
logistic regression . 
The responders and non-responders will be summarized descriptively by treatment using

No inferential safet y analyses are planned. Pfizer safet y reporting standards will be 
utilized for all safety  endpoints.
All safet y anal yses will be presented overall, and separatel y byage group of pediatrics 
overall (<17 years) and adults (17- 65 years).
8.4.1. Adverse Events
All AEs occurring during the course of the study  will be coded using MedDRA coding 
dictionary .  
All AEs (serious and non -serious) reported from the first day  of stud y treatment through 
and including 28 calendar day s after the last administration of the study  drug will be 
considered treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs). An overall summary  of treatment -
emergent AEs will be provided.  TEAEs will also be summarized by  system or gan class, 
preferred term, severity , and relationship to study  drug. TEAEs will be presented overall, 
and separatel y by age group of pediatrics overall (<17 y ears) and adults (17-65 years) .
Summaries and listings of all AEs, SAEs and treatment -related AEs will be presented in 
accordance with the current Pfizer Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and standards .
The 3 -
tier Approach for summarizing AEs will be implemented, and events (MedDRA 
PTs) will be classified into the following tier definitions:
Tier 1: None 
Tier 2: Targeted Medical Events (TMEs) identified in the Ly rica Safety  Review Plan
Tier 3: Standard safet y output (no new outputs- see above)

“Percent reduction in 
seizures” relative to 
placeboFor example, a difference between one of the pregabalin 
doses and placebo of -0.400 on the log transformed scale 
for the 28- day seizure rate translates in to a 33% reduction 
in the 28- day seizure rate of the pregabalin group from the 
placebo group (ie, 100%*[exp
-0.400-1]= -33%)
An additional back transformation will be calculated for 
the percent reduction in seizures for each pregabalin 
treatment group rela tive to placebo for presentation in the 
CSR  as follows: 
Percent change from 
baseline in 12 -week 28-day 
seizure rate% Change = [28-day  seizure rate t -28-day seizure rate b)/ 28-
day seizure rate b] × 100%
Responders 50% reduction in the 28 -day seizure rate from baseline 
during the 12 -week double -blind treatment phase, then
response = 1 (responder) otherwise response = 0 (non -
responder).
The response status will be set as missing if the baseline 
seizure rate is missing. If baseline seizure rate is non-missing 
but there are no double -blind phase seizure rates, then the 
response status will be set as non -response
Proportion Seizure -free 
daysThe numerator for seizure -free day s is defined as the 
number of day s the subject experience no seizures over the 
double -blind assessment phase.

Protocol A0081105 Statistical Analy sis Plan
Statistical Analysis Plan Version 3.0 Page 33of 39Appendix 4.Analysis Strategy Using Multip le Imputations
If the amount of missing data is not significant in the primary  endpoint (ie, less than 5% 
within each treatment groups), then the multiple imputation analysis will not be 
performed.
Concept of multiple imputation strategy
Multiple imputatio n procedure is used under the assumption of missing at random (MAR) 
data and under the assumption of a monotone missing data pattern. In general, let Y be 
the response data (monthly  seizu re rate) where that part of Y which is missing is denoted 
by Ymis, and that part of Ywhich is observed is denoted by  Yobs.  A data pattern is said to 
have a missing monotone data pattern when the variable Yjfor an individual subject is 
missing at time point j, and all subsequent variables for that individual are also mis
sing 
for Ykin which k>j.
The three steps for conducting statistical inferences using a multiple imputation 
procedure consist of the following :
Imputation step: Missing data are filled in m times to generate m complete data sets, 
where m > 1 ;For this stu dy, we will let m take on the value 100.
Analysis step: Them complete d atasets are analy zed using standard procedures;
Combination step: The results from the m complete data sets are combined for the final 
statistical inference .
The imputation step is pe
rhaps the most critical, since it relies upon assumptions 
regarding the missing data mechanism. The goal of the imputation is to account for the 
relationships between the unobserved and observed variables, while taking into account 
the uncertaint y of the imputation. The MAR assumption is key  to the validity  of multiple 
imputation. Use of this assumption allows the analy st to generate imputations ( Y{1},Y{2}, . 
. .Y {m}) from the distribution f(Ymis|Yobs), since after conditioning on Yobs, the 
missingness i s assumed to be due to chance and is considered ignorable .In this 
application, we will use the regression method in which the variable Y jwith missing 
values, is fitted with non- missing observations as the dependent variables. This allows 
for the follow ing regression model to be employ ed:
Yj= β 0+ β 1*Y1+ β 2*Y2+ … + β (j-1)Y(j-1).
The fitted model has parameter estimates (b 0, b1, b2, …, b (j-1)) and the associated 
covariance matrix 
s2
jVj, where V jis the usual XTX matrix from the intercept and 
variables Y 1, Y2, …, Y(j-1).

0, β*
1, β*
2, …, β*
(j-1); and *2) are dra wn from a 
posterior predictive dis tribution of the missing data. The missing values of Y jare then 
replaced with the predicted values using the following equation:
β*
0 + β*
1*y1+ β*
2*y2+ … + β*
(j-1)*y(j-1)+ z i**2
where y1, y2, …, y (j-1)are covariates values for the first (j
-1) variables and z ia simulated 
standard normal deviate for the ithindivi dual. 
The next step is to carry  out the anal ysis of interest for each of the 
m imputed complete -
observation datasets, storing the parameter vector and standard error estimates.
Finally , the results are combined using results from Rubin (1987), to calculate estimates 
of the within imputation and between imputation variability .These statistics accoun t for 
the variability  of the imputations and assuming that the imputation model is correct, 
provide consistent estimates of the parameters and their standard errors. 
SAS sample programs for multiple imputation strategy  for this study
A pattern mixture model of multiple imputation is applied, and sample SAS programs are 
described as below.  Note that the variable names/labels are suggestions only  and the 
actual names/labels and code levels should be consistent with current sponsor reporting 
standards. 
SUBJ ID:subject identification number .
REGION and AGE _strata (See covariates Section 6.4).
TRT : Treatment group (Placebo, Pregabalin Level 1
, Pregabalin Level 2 ).
LN_BSZRT : A log etransformed baseline seizure rate log e(28-days seizure rate b
+1).
LN_SZRATE: A log etransformed double -blind seizure rate log e(28-days seizure 
rate t+1).
IMPSTAT : Impstat = 1 if DC due to AE, death, or insufficient clinical response.  
Impstat = 2 otherwise .
MISS: Miss = 1 if ln_szrate is missing.  Miss = 0 otherwise.
In order to impute missing data at the singular time point, first prepare an input dataset, 
making sure that it will contain only  the intended donor and recipient patterns.   Separate 
the input dataset <efficacy> into two 
datasets: I MP, containing all placebo subjects and 
those subjects from the pregabalin arms that have missing LN_SZRATE [Miss=1] and

Poisson D istributions often arise from a Counting process
Seizure counts as a random variable Y
The expected value of the seizure counts is E(Y) = 
The variance of the seizure counts is Var(Y) = 
Generalized L inear Model for Seizure Counts with equal duration
g() = ln() = +X
Distribution is Poisson
Link function g( ) is the natural log 
In other words = exp(+X)
Incorporating exposure time (T) in the Model 
Off-setting the exposure time by  ln(T)
ln(/T) = +X
  = T·exp(+X)
Adjust for unequal exposure times among treatment groups
Exposure time T is derived in months as study  day/28, where study  day is derived as the 
(assessment date -date of start of double blind treatment phase) + 1.  Eg, if the subject 
dropped out at day  26, the exposure time would be 26/
28=0. 93months.
The scale parameter will be set to Pearson in the Poisson model

For this study , the ratio of estimated sample size of two treatment group ( ) is assumed 
as one due to 1:1 randomization with respect to placebo versus dose level 1.  In addition, 
the estimat esfor correla tion () and pooled variance (2) is estimated based on the 
residual variance of ANCOVA.  Therefore, the simpli fied equation for this study  is:

Hypertensive diseases of pregnancy complicate around 10% of pregnancies. 
Preeclampsia is a pregnancy related hypertensive disorder. In the US during the past two decades the incidence of preeclampsia has increased by 25%. 
1The 
diagnosis of preeclampsia impacts the gestational age at delivery, with those with preeclampsia with severe features being delivered by 34 weeks gestational age, and those without being delivered by 37 weeks gestational age.
2 Preeclampsia is a major 
contributor to prematurity. Perinat al mortality is higher in infants of preeclamptic 
women regardless of gestational age at delivery. 3Causes are hypothesized as 
placental insufficiency and placental abruption, which in turn cause either intrauterine fetal demise, or early delivery. Preecla mpsia may also cause serious 
maternal adverse effects including: eclampsia (seizures), posterior reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome, placental abruption leading to disseminated intravascular 
coagulopathy amongst other maternal adverse outcomes. It is also associated with 
long term maternal health consequences, including long- term cardiovascular 
disease risk.  
2 
Low dose aspirin was initially reported as having a beneficial effect at preeclampsia 
prevention in a case in 1978.4 Since then there have been large  randomized 
controlled trials with conflicting results regarding effectiveness of aspirin for 
preeclampsia prevention, and the optimal dosing. (table 1)

Rationale for a clinical trial  
Evidence suggests that in preeclamptic patients there is a imbalance in the prostacyclin  
/thromboxane balance favoring thromboxane. Thromboxane is a vasoconstrictor while 
prostacyclin is a vasodilator.9 The pathophysiology of action of aspirin for preeclampsia 
prophylaxis is believed to be due to its preferential inhibition of COX -1 at low dos es (60-  
150mg/day)10. 
The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology in July 2018, published a 
committee opinion supporting the USPSTF guideline criteria for the use of low dose aspirin for preeclampsia prophylaxis. The recommended dose is 81mg/day of aspirin, and it is to be used in women at high risk for preeclampsia. Women were considered to be at high risk if they had at least a 8% incidence of preeclampsia (table 2). The initiation of aspirin was to be done at 12- 28 weeks gestation, optimally prior to 16 weeks 
gestational age.

As illustrated in table 3 there have been multiple randomized controlled trials that 
support the use of higher aspirin doses for preeclampsia prophylaxis. A recent systematic review and metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials, evaluating a total of 14 ,668 patients noted that the incidence of preeclampsia depended on the 
gestational age at initiation of aspirin and the dosing of aspirin used. With a clinically significant decrease in rate of preterm preeclampsia noted when the aspirin dose is  
≥ 100 mg/d ay and when it is initiated at ≤ 16 weeks (table 4)

Aspirin resistance is a phenomenon that refers to the inability of aspirin to reduce the 
production of thromboxane A2. It is detected by laboratory tests that either measure directly the thromboxane A2 levels, or indirectly the platelet function that depen ds on 
platelet thromboxane production.
15 A recent study evaluated aspirin resistance in 
pregnant patients, and noted that aspirin resistance was decreased as the dosing of aspirin increased. With a incidence of 30% , 10% and 5% of aspirin resistance at doses  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-18-1073 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/08/2024   of 81, 121 and 162mg respectively. 16 Moreover, data has emerged in other fields 
linking obesity, female gender, and poor glycemic control to aspirin resistance. 17 
At baseline, obesity is linked to a low grade inflammation state causing lipid 
peroxidation and in turn a persistent platelet activation, causing higher levels of 
thromboxane to be present in this population.18 Also, obesity is a established risk factor 
for preeclampsia. 2In a population- based cohort study including 503,179 nulliparous 
patients, obese patients had a four fold increase in incidence of preeclampsia in 
comparison to those with a normal BMI.19 
A metaanalysis published in the lancet in 2018 highlighted the effects of the interaction between bodyweight and aspirin dose in reducing vascular events.
20 This study 
concluded that patients with higher body weights need q higher aspirin dosage for 
secondary cardiovascular prevention. While other fields are also realizing the impact of 
bodyweight on aspirin effectiveness, we argue that this concept should be extended to 
our high risk obese patient population. A population which also inherently has a higher 
incidence of preeclampsia, higher baseline thromboxane levels, and may also have 
higher aspirin resistance. We thus propose that a “one dose fit all” approach may not 
be appropriate in this patient population. To our knowledge, at this time there are no 
randomized controlled trials that have compared aspirin 81mg and 162 mg in the 
pregnant obese patient population.  
Hypothesis  
 
We hypothesize that the administration of a higher dose of aspirin prophylaxis to a high risk obese population will result in a clinically significant decrease in rate of developing preeclampsia with severe features in comparison to the standard 81mg/day dose.  
 
2. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Randomization 
Randomization will be achieved by computer -generated random sequences, using 
RedCap. Permuted block randomization will be performed. Women will be randomized 
to 81mg/day of aspirin or 162 mg/day of aspirin.  
 
 
Interventions and Procedures  
Women with singlet on gestations that are less than twenty weeks gestational age and 
meet inclusion criteria will be approached by the research staff after the study is introduced by the patient’s provider. Written informed consent will be obtained from participating women at the outpatient clinic. If the patient consents, then randomization  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-18-1073 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/08/2024   will be performed. The results of randomization will be shared with the obstetric provider 
and the patient prior to starting aspirin. If the patient had already been started on 
81mg/day aspirin in a prior visit then she will be informed of whether she should 
continue with the same dose or if she would need a higher dose based on the randomization.  
After randomization, patients will then be prescribed the medication. Which wil l be 
started between 12 and 20 weeks gestational age and continued till time of delivery. The primary provider will dictate all other aspects of care.  
A medication adherence survey (Morisky medication adherence survey) will be performed to assess for compliance at 16- 24 weeks of gestational age, and again at 32-  36 weeks 
gestational age. At the time of administration of medication adherence surveys, participants will be asked about medication side effects.  
22-24 
Blood samples (3- 4 cc) and urine samples (3- 4 cc) will be obtained at the time of 
enrollment (with the routine blood tests that are sent), to test for baseline aspirin, thromboxane and prostacycli n levels. At the time of delivery, blood samples (3- 4 cc) and 
urine samples (3- 4 cc) (with routine blood samples that are sent at time of labor 
admission), placental 1x1 cm specimens and cord blood will be obtained. These samples will be used for biochemic al correlation with the clinical  data.  
The primary outcome (incidence of preeclampsia with severe features) will be determined based on clinician diagnosis, with the use of ACOG diagnostic criteria. Secondary outcomes will be determined by following the mother and the neonate clinically until the time of discharge. Patients will not be contacted after discharge from the hospital.

Sample Size and Feasibility  
An intent -to-treat principle will be applied to all analysis. To calculate Bayesian 
statistical power we assumed a baseline incidence of preeclampsia in our population to 
be 20%. We investigated effects sizes of 50%, 40%, and 30% reduction (corresponding relative risk [RR] of 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7). We also varied the level of certainty (probability 
threshold for declaring benefit) from 70% to 85%. For all scenarios, we assumed a neutral prior centered at RR of 1.0 with 95% credible interval of 0.33- 3.0 (excludes 
implausible large treatment effects). Tables 5 and 6 present the power for two total sample sizes. We will use the number of patients required to detect a 40% reduction in incidence of preeclampsia with 75% certainty and power (1 –  β) = 0.80 is 220 (110 
patients in each arm).

In the week of November 5- 9 2018, 10 patients that attended the UT Women’s clinic 
and UT Bellaire Clinic, met inclusion criteria. Assuming a 50% enrollment rate, the study 
would take 12.5  months.  
Statistical Tests  
Selected baseline characteristics  and outcome measures  will be collected for each 
group. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize all variables. An intent -to-treat 
analysis will be conducted. The rate of the primary outcome, preeclampsia, will be 
compared between the intervention and contr ol group using  a log binomial  (or Poisson  in 
case  of nonconvergence)  model  to estimate  relative risk and 95% confidence interval  (CI). 
Each  secondary  outcome will be similarly  analyzed using the best fitting  generalized  linear 
model with intervention group as the covariate. For all outcomes, we will report relative risks or differences and 95%  CIs. 
We will also conduct a Bayesian analysis of the primary outcome to calculate 
probability of treatment benefit or harm. We wil l use a neutral prior distribution for the 
intervention effect that excludes  implausible  large treatment  effects:  Normal(0,  SD=0.57) 
in the log RR scale (prior 95% interval for the RR of 0.33- 3) 
25. We will report posterior 
median and 95% credible interval  and probability of treatment  benefit.  
 
Subgroup Analysis. To investigate treatment effect modifier for the primary 
outcome, we will use a Bayesian hierarchical model with terms of interaction between treatment group (162 mg, 81 mg) and the prespecified potential moderator of BMI (30 - 
40; >40).  The conservative  Bayesian  approach of Dixon  and Simon  
26 allows  us to specify 
a priori  how likely  (or unlikely)  it is for subgroup differences  to be present  and to shrinkthe 
subgroup estimates to the overall mean treatment effect. A neutral prior will be used for the interaction term.  Point  estimates  of treatment  effect  and 95% credible intervals  will be 
reported along with probability of treatment  benefit/harm.

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/08/2024   3. SAFETY ASSESSMENT  
A. Maternal  Risk 
According to a USPSTF report discussing low -dose aspirin use for the prevention of 
preeclampsia,  there  was no increased risk of placental  abruption (RR: 1.17;  CI, 0.93-1.48) 
in 11 trials (23,332 women). No increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage (RR: 1.02;  CI 
0.96- 1.09)  in 9 trials  (22,760  women)  and no difference in mean  blood loss (5 trials;  2,478 
women). 27 
In the EPREDA trial (150mg ASA administered) they noted no abnormal bleeding in 
mothers  nor babies.  28 In the multicenter  RCT done by Yu et al, with administration  of 150 
mg ASA in comparison to placebo, no statistically significant differences in the rates of 
placental abruption (4% vs 2%, p=0.12), postpartum hemorrhage (25% vs 26%, p=0.67) 
and blood transfusions (2.5 vs 2.2%, p=0.81) were observ ed between the groups.  
 
B. Fetal  Risk 
 
A review of 11 trials (which included 23,332 participants), noted no significant harm of perinatal death or abruption to those receiving aspirin in comparison to those that did not. Of the 10 trials reporting on neonatal  intracranial hemorrhage, the fixed- affects 
pooled risk ratio was 0.84 (CI, 0.61 to 1.16). 
29 In a cohort of 15,000 women that 
reported aspirin use in the first trimester, there was no increased risk of congenital 
malformations. 30 Furthermore, the use of low dose aspirin in the third trimester, has not 
been found to be associated with early ductal closure. 31 A 2007 cochrane meta-  
analysis which reviewed 10 trials (including 26, 148 infants) did not find an increased 
risk of neonatal intracranial hemorrhag e, in relation to the use of low dose aspirin in the 
third trimester.32 
 
Management of Adverse Events  
Any adverse events will be reported to the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (CPHS). Because this study involves the use of aspirin at low doses there is  no 
increased anticipation of severe adverse  events.  
Procedures in the Event of Abnormal Clinical Findings  
In the event of an abnormal clinical finding, the health care provider caring for the 
participant will be notified to allow treatment in the usual clinical manner.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-18-1073 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/08/2024   Institutional Review Board  
Before initiation of the study, the PI will obtain approval of the research protocol from  the 
IRB. The study  will be registered in www.clinicaltrials.gov  as required  by US law  for public 
access.  
Specification of Safety Parameters  
The proposed trial is intended to evaluate the impact of different low doses of aspirin on 
rates of preeclampsia. Aspirin at the desired doses have been used safely during pregnancy.  
The PI, who will also determine  the safety  parameters,  will carefully  monitor  patient  safety. 
The PI or designee will notify the IRB of applicable events according to institutional guidelines.  
 
 
4. ETHICAL  CONSIDERATIONS

Study Drug Tivozanib
ObjectivesPrimary Objective:
•The primary endpoint of the study is PFS at 24 weeks in patients with 
advanced HCC. Patients who remain alive without evidence of disease progression (per RECIST) for at least 24 weeks after enrollment will be considered PFS responders.
Secondary Objectives:
•To determine the safety of tivozanib in HCC.
•To determine the OS and clinical benefit rate (CR, PR and SD) by RECIST.
•To determine the steady state PK and soluble VEGFR-2 baseline/ change 
with tivozanib and use modeling to correlate exposure with biomarker change and the primary outcome measure of PFS.
•To determine the change in viral load (HBV and HCV) during therapy in 
patients with HBV or HCV associated HCC.
•To determine the change in tumor marker (alfa fetoprotein) with tivozanib 
therapy is in the effect of tivozanib on several tumor-associated immune response markers.
Study DesignMulticenter Phase 1b/2 study of tivozanib in patients with advanced inoperable 
hepatocellular carcinoma.  The Phase 2 portion includes early stopping rules for futility.
Target Accrual and Study 
DurationBetween 6 and 18 patients will be enrolled in Phase 1b portion of this study. Six 
Phase 1b patients treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose will be included in the Phase 2 portion of this study. An additional 31 patients will be enrolled for the Phase 2 portion, for a total Phase 2 sample size of 37. This study is expected to accrue 9 patients to the Phase 1b, for a combined sample of size of 40 (9+37-6). If 18 patients are enrolled in the Phase 1b, the maximum combined sample size will be 49 (18+37-6).
The number of subjects required is a function of the unknown PFS response 
rate. Accrual is expected to take up to 4 years. The duration the patients will be on study will be approximately 2 years.

Statistical AnalysisSample Size Determination:  Sample size for the Phase 1 portion depends on 
the unknown dose-toxicity profile. For the Phase 2 portion, with = 0.05, 
assessment of 37 patients gives 80% power to detect minimum 20 percentage 
point improvement in the 24 week PFS response rate, assuming a 50% rate under the standard of care.
Randomization: No randomization is required.
Efficacy Analysis: Primary interest is in the PFS response rate 24 weeks after 
enrollment. The response rate will be described by binomial proportion estimates and 95% confidence intervals. All enrolled patients will be included in this primary analysis.
Safety Analysis: Adverse events will be tabulated. AE rates will be described 
using binomial proportions and 95% confidence intervals.

122216 Page 14 of 761 BACKGROUND
Primary HCC is the sixth most common malignancy diagnosed worldwide. HCC results in 
between 250,000 and one million deaths globally per y ear and its incidence continues to increase 
in the developed world. HCC is an aggressive tumor that often occurs in the setting of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis and is often diagnosed late in its course, as there are no biomarkers to detect it when it is incipient and potentially curable. Median survival following diagnosis is less than 6 months. Treatment options are divided into surgical therapies (i.e., resection, cryoablation, and orthotopic liver transplantation [OLT]), and nonsurgical therapies (i.e., percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), systemic chemotherapy, and radiation). Curative th erapies such as resection, transplantation, or 
percutaneous therapies benefit only 25% of patients.  Majority of patients are not eligible for such 
therapies because of tumor extent or underlying liver dysfunction. Improving treatment outcomes in patients with advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requires the development of agents with tolerable safety profiles and the identification of biomarkers capable of predicting tumor response or resistance to treatment. The underlying etiology for HCC development is often chronic viral infection and inflammation due to hepatitis and cirrhosis affects both tumor progression and immune cell networks.
1
1.1 Study Disease – Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Liver cancer is a common and rapidly fatal malignancy, with the third highest cancer mortality in 
2008. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer, accounting for about 80% of all cases of cancers originating in the liver. HCC is a hypervascular malignancy and VEGF is frequently expressed and associated with poor prognosis.
2 VEGF induces 
endothelial cell proliferation and vascular permeability and its effects are mediated through multiple receptors, including VEGFR-2.
3 VEGFR-2 is the predominant mediator of 
VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell migration, proliferation, survival, and enhanced vascular permeability. High VEGF HCC tumor expression has been correlated with vascular invasion and poor patient survival. VEGFR-2 has been shown to be more strongly expressed in HCC compared to dysplastic nodules and background cirrhotic liver, and VEGFR-2 up-regulation is a feature of poor differentiation and tumor progression. Therefore, VEGFR-2 is an important regulator of VEGF-induced tumor development and angiogenesis. Systemic therapy using targeted therapy for advanced-stage HCC appeared promising in Phase 2 studies delaying progression free survival despite no radiographic shrinkage in the tumor and led to confirmatory Phase 3 studies that led to FDA approval of the multikinase inhibitor, sorafenib. Sorafenib targets Raf kinase and receptor tyrosine kinase activity of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFR- β) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) 1, 2 and 3.31, 32 
Since its approval in 2008, no other targeted therapies have shown superior activity or safety profiles in the treatment of advanced HCC.
4
Although sorafenib has been approved for use, in clinical practice the drug has many toxicities and overall survival even in western populations with good supportive care remains only 10.7 months, 2 months greater than placebo. In addition, the primary endpoint of improved symptom control was not achieved and 66% of patients either need dose reductions or delays and APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7

122216 Page 15 of 76discontinue drug for reasons other than disease progression that speak also to the limited 
tolerability of this drug and also the challenges with developing safe and efficacious therapies for this disease population. Despite these limitations with the approval of sorafenib targeting angiogenesis is and will remain the backbone for HCC therapy for the foreseeable future.
5 Novel 
agents that target this pathway and have sound preclinical rationale need to be evaluated to improve outcomes for patients with this disease. In addition, there is a need to incorporate and prospectively validate novel biomarkers that will predict response to such therapies.
1.2 Study Drug - Tivozanib Hydrochloride
Tivozanib hydrochloride (also known as AV-951; previously known as KRN951) has the 
chemical name ( N- {2-Chloro-4-[(6, 7-dimethoxy-4-quinolyl) oxy] phenyl}-N'-(5-methyl-3-
isoxazolyl) urea hydrochloride monohydrate). Tivozanib hydrochloride is a novel and potent pan-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent activity against all 3 VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3).
6 Tivozanib 
hydrochloride inhibits phosphorylation of VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 at picomolar concentrations (IC
50 of 0.21, 0.16 and 0.24 nM, respectively), and inhibits c-Kit and PDGFR at 
10-times higher concentrations (IC 50 of 1.63 and 1.72 nM, respectively). In nonclinical models 
and studies performed in humans, tivozanib hydrochloride has shown strong anti-angiogenesis and antitumor activity. VEGF is a potent induction factor, playing a central role in angiogenesis and vascular permeability of tumor tissues. By inhibiting VEGF-induced VEGFR activation, tivozanib hydrochloride inhibits angiogenesis and vascular permeability in tumor tissues, leading indirectly to inhibition of tumor growth.
7
Tivozanib hydrochloride has been studied in severa l clinical trials in multiple tumor types. A 
summary of tivozanib’s hydrochloride pertinent efficacy results and safety data follow. Please refer to the tivozanib hydrochloride Investigator Brochure (IB) for descriptions of all available data.
1.3 Preclinical Studies with Tivozanib
A detailed discussion of the preclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of 
tivozanib can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.
1.4 Clinical Studies with Tivozanib
Clinical activity data are available for 3 monotherapy studies and for 2 combination therapy 
studies. Clinical response was assessed using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1).
Forty-one patients with advanced solid tumors received tivozanib hydrochloride monotherapy 
given orally for 28-consecutive days followed by a 14-day rest period in a Phase 1 study (KRN951/03-B01). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of tivozanib hydrochloride was determined to be 1.5 mg/day. Overall, 46.3% of subjects experienced some level of disease control. Most subjects had a best overall response of stable disease [SD] (43.9%) or progressive disease [PD] (43.9%). The median time to disease progression across all treatment groups was 3.9 months (95% CI: 2.7, 6).APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study No.: I 229112
122216 Page 16 of 76In a Phase 2 study (AV-951-07-201) in 272 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 
there were 2 primary efficacy analyses: best tumor response rates throughout the 16-week open-label period and progression-free survival (PFS) rates at 12 weeks post-randomization. Throughout the 16-week, open-label period, the overall response rate (ORR) for all treated subjects was 24.6% by investigator assessment and 18% by independent radiology review (IRR) assessment. By both investigator assessment and IRR assessment, the disease control rate (DCR) for all treated subjects was 84.2% (229/272 subjects). At 12 weeks post-randomization, PFS rates were 57.4% for tivozanib hydrochloride subjects and 28.1% for placebo subjects (p = 0.001). By IRR assessment, PFS rates were 49.2% for tivozanib hydrochloride subjects and 21.1% for placebo subjects (p = 0.001).
Sixteen subjects with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were treated with tivozanib 
hydrochloride in a Phase 1 continuous-dosing monotherapy study. No subject had a confirmed best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Four subjects had SD. Duration of SD, for the 4 subjects with confirmed SD, ranged from 7 weeks to 32 weeks. Disease control was confirmed in 25% of subjects. Time to progression (TTP) was less than 10 weeks for most subjects.
Tivozanib hydrochloride was combined with temsirolimus in a Phase 1b study in patients with 
metastatic RCC. Of the 22 subjects evaluable for a secondary endpoint of efficacy, no subject 
had confirmed CR, 5 subjects had confirmed PR, and 15 subjects had confirmed SD. Reported ORR and DCR were 22.7% and 90.9%, respectively.
In a Phase 1b study of tivozanib hydrochloride combined with paclitaxel in a cohort of invasive 
breast cancer patients, ORR, DCR, and TTP were among the secondary efficacy variables. 
Thirteen subjects were included in the efficacy evaluable population. No subject had a confirmed 
CR, 4 subjects had confirmed PR, 6 subjects had SD, and 1 subject had PD. For responses confirmed by RECIST, ORR was 30.8% and DCR was 76.9%. In the 4 subjects demonstrating a PR, the duration ranged from 5.6 to 9.4+ months and TTP ranged from 9.7 to 13.1+ months.
1.5 Tivozanib Hydrochloride Safety Experience
Clinical data are available for 14 completed or ongoing clinical studies of tivozanib 
hydrochloride. Adverse events were generally manageable using standard medical therapy and/or discontinuation or reduction of study drug.
Related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that resulted in a fatal outcome occurred in 
4 subjects and included post-procedural hemorrhage, cerebrovascular accident, pulmonary embolism, and hypertension.
Related TEAEs for combination therapy studies can be summarized as follows:
•Combination Therapy Studies:  Related TEAEs were reported in 65/81 subjects (80.2%). 
The most frequently related TEAEs (occurring in ≥ 10% of treated subjects) were fatigue

1.6 Correlative Studies1.6.1 Pharmacokinetic/ Pharmacokinetic and VEGFR-2
Given the toxicity and cost of newer targeted therapies, an important goal of early phase clinical 
studies is to identify biomarkers that will iden tify subsets of patients most likely to benefit from 
novel agents as well as to further our understanding of the mechanisms that are not yet not fully known. Research in this area has focused on soluble factors such as changes in soluble VEGF receptors, dynamic vascular changes and permeability changes using newer functional imaging such as DCE-MRI, but no standards have emerged. In a recent study of sunitinib and chemoembolization in HCC, we used PK modeling and developed a model using soluble VEGFR -2 and AUC of sunitinib and its active metabolite to predict PFS.
8 Model predicted PFS 
of 7 months and actual PFS in the study of 7.8 mont hs strongly correlated. Given this finding and 
the very similar mechanism of action between sunitinib and tivozanib, we propose to do a limited PK sampling at rationally selected time points to assess both AUC and soluble VEGFR-2 in tivozanib treated patients and correlate the PFS at 24 weeks with model predicted outcomes using the previously described model. Stats methods are described in appropriate sections. Despite this being a good liver function population by inclusion criteria, still represents a population with limited liver reserve, hence we are starting at one dose level below recommended Phase 2 dose, PK studies in the patients included in this initial Phase 1 portion will add to the existing knowledge of tivozanib pharmacokinetic literature and is included for patient safety.
1.6.2 Immune Biomarker
Like many other cancers, HCC cells develop multiple strategies of escaping tumor-specific 
immunity such as the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC),
9 suppression 
of tumor-associated antigen-reactive lymphocytes by T regulatory cells (Treg)10 and 
dysfunctional dendritic cells.11 MDSCs will be quantified by flow using a panel of markers that 
we have already standardized HLA DR-, CD 14-, CD11b +,CD33+. These mechanisms that drive HCC progression makes the development of efficacious immunotherapies for HCC very challenging.
The hypothesis of this study is based on the following rationale: c-Kit is one of the targets of 
tivozanib and functions as a receptor for stem cell factor (SCF),
12 a well-studied tumor-derived 
factor expressed by various human and murine tumor cell lines.13 In mouse tumor models, 
abrogation of tumor-expressed SCF by RNA interference has been shown to significantly reduce MDSC expansion and restore the effector function of tumor-infiltrating T cells.
14 Furthermore, 
blockade of c-Kit by immunotherapeutic treatment with an anti-c-Kit monoclonal antibody prevented the development of Tregs, tumor-specific T cell anergy and tumor angiogenesis.
14 In 
view of this role of c-Kit, we hypothesize that modulation of c-Kit signaling via tivozanib may have a novel role in reversing tumor-induced immune suppression. In RPCI studies, levels of APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study No.: I 229112
122216 Page 19 of 76ERK2 phosphorylation will be compared between c-Kit+ and c-Kit − immune cells to allow us to 
address the role of c-Kit expression on immune cells as the mechanism by which tivozanib modulates the immunosuppressive network in advanced stage HCC patients. Results will be correlated to outcome  measurements on patients (progressed, median survival time.
Targeting of c-Kit to prevent MDSC and Treg accumulation in murine tumor models has been 
successfully demonstrated with sunitinib.
15,16 Importantly, in our studies with HCC patients we 
have shown that multifocal immunosuppressive networks are present at high levels in patients compared to healthy controls and that they are reduced following sorafenib treatment (provided in Preliminary Data). Specifically, the frequency of MDSCs and Tregs decreased in advanced stage HCC patients following their treatment with sorafenib.
The downstream signaling effect of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors, such as tivozanib, 
is modulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation. Although RTKs converge on several MAP kinases, this study will examine tivozanib-mediated modulation of ERK2 phosphorylation by high-throughput multi-parameter flow cytometry. In addition, this study will measure the extent of intracellular ERK2 phosphorylation as this adaptor signaling molecule plays a critical role in the function of immunosuppressive and effector immune cells. The expression level of c-Kit and level of ERK2 phosphorylation will be examined in circulating MDSC and Tregs analyzed from patients with advanced, inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma receiving tivozanib as part of a Phase 2 study. One prediction is that ERK2 phosphorylation will decrease in c-Kit+ MDSC and Tregs upon treatment with tivozanib. Diminished c-Kit signaling will therefore coincide with a reduction in the frequency of MDSC and Tregs relative to effector anti-tumor T cells.
1.7 Risks and/or Benefits
The known adverse events from tivozanib include diarrhea, fatigue, asthenia, hypothyroidism, 
dysphonia, hypertension, palmo-plantar erythrodysesthesia, and alopecia. Refer to Table 1  and 
the current Tivozanib Investigator Brochure.
2 RATIONALE
HCC is a common malignancy worldwide and rising in incidence in the United States. Most 
patients have incurable/advanced disease at presentation. The subset of Child Pugh Class A and early Class B liver dysfunction patients have been shown to benefit from sorafenib which is considered the ‘standard of care’; as it improve d overall survival and PFS when compared with 
placebo in well conducted large randomized Phase 3 trials despite a lack of radiographic response. The time to symptom improvement endpoint, however, was not met and median survival still remains less than 11 months. Targeting angiogenesis is now the backbone of HCC therapy, but better agents and biomarkers that define subsets of patients who are likely to derive the most benefit from such therapies are still needed. Tivozanib is an oral potent inhibitor of VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 and represents a tolerable and effective treatment for VEGF driven malignancies based on data from 12 comp leted trials in cancer patients. It showed 
safety and efficacy in renal cell cancer and is be ing evaluated in combination with sorafenib in 
Phase 3 studies in RCC. Given that HCC is a highly vascular VEGF driven malignancy and like APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study No.: I 229112
122216 Page 20 of 76RCC, is a malignancy where sorafenib has proven efficacy, we hypothesize tivozanib may have 
meaningful clinical benefit. Although HCC pa thogenesis is driven by many factors, of the 
identified angiogenic factors, VEGF is the most potent and specific and has been identified as a crucial regulator of both normal and pathologic angiogenesis. In vivo  data suggest that VEGF 
inhibition with tivozanib has therapeutic potentia l in HCC. Elevated VEGF levels correlate with 
advanced stage and poor prognosis in HCC. The preclinical efficacy of tivozanib in HCC models, the tolerability in early clinical tria ls and success of a targeting angiogenesis in HCC 
form the rationale for our hypothesis that tivozanib may be tolerable and improve PFS in HCC patients beyond 24 weeks, the expected median  PFS for patients receiving sorafenib. In vitro, 
sorafenib has been reported to have anti-HCV e ffects and in recently completed human studies 
we have seen significant differences in survival using baseline immune cell numbers. It is expected that some effects of novel multi-targeted TKIs maybe immune mediated and hence propose to test this hypothesis prospectively using validated assays already in place.
3 OBJECTIVES3.1 Primary Objective
The primary endpoint of the study is PFS at 24 weeks in patients with advanced HCC. Patients 
who remain alive without evidence of disease progression (per RECIST) for at least 24 weeks after enrollment will be considered PFS responders.
3.2 Secondary Objectives
•To determine the safety of tivozanib in HCC.
•To determine the OS and clinical benefit rate (CR, PR and SD) by RECIST.
•To determine the steady state PK and soluble VEGFR-2 baseline/ change with tivozanib and 
use modeling to correlate exposure with biomarker change and the primary outcome measure of PFS.
•To determine the change in viral load (HBV and HCV) during therapy in patients with HBV or HCV associated HCC.
•To determine the change in tumor marker (alfa fetoprotein) with tivozanib therapy is in the effect of tivozanib on several tumor-associated immune response markers.
3.3 Study Design
This is a multicenter Phase 1b/2 study of tivozanib in patients with advanced inoperable 
hepatocellular carcinoma.
3.3.1 Phase 1b 
Based on monotherapy tolerability data of tivozanib from 14 studies an oral dose of 1.5 mg daily 
has been recommended for Phase 2 testing. Since tivozanib has not been tested in HCC patients, and HCC patients who are candidates for systemic therapies tend to have Child Pugh Class A or early B cirrhosis, this study will start with a Phase 1 dose escalation study.APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study No.: I 229112
122216 Page 21 of 76The Phase 1b portion of the study follows a modified 3 + 3 design. Typical 3 + 3 studies start at 
the lowest dose. This modified design starts at patients at the middle dose. The first 3 patients will be treated with a 1 mg oral once daily dose. Depending on observed toxicity rates, the dose may be deescalated to 0.5 mg, or escalated to 1.5 mg. The standard 3 + 3 dose (de)escalation rules will be followed, as specified in the table below.  Dose level will be considered, tolerable following completion of 1
st cycle of treatment. The dose of 1 mg daily, was found to be the 
tolerated dose in the phase 1b portion and will be the phase 2 dose.

that dose.
≤ 1 out of 6 at the highest dose level 
below the maximally administered 
doseThis is generally the recommended Phase 2 dose. At least 6 patients must 
be entered at the recommended Phase 2 dose
3.3.2 Phase 2
The Phase 2 portion is a two-stage, single arm, unblinded trial allowing for early termination in 
case of futility. The 6 Phase 1b patients treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose will be included in the Phase 2 trial. Details are provided in Section 11 .
3.3.3 Treatment Cycle
A cycle will be defined as 28 days.  At the full dose, this will be 21 days on treatment with 
7 days off. However, in the case of a dose reduction patients will be treated starting on day 1 of the cycle, every other day for 10 doses. Treatment will continue until progression or toxicity. Response/ progression will be assessed Q 8 weeks or q 2 months by CT scan. (MRI when patients have contraindication to CT). Steady state PK will be assessed at Day 15, as this is the first study in patients with liver dysfunction.
3.4 Target Accrual and Study Duration
Between 6 and 18 patients will be enrolled in the Phase 1b portion of this study. Six Phase 1b 
patients treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose will be included in the Phase 2 portion of this study. An additional 31 patients will be enrolled for the Phase 2 portion, for a total Phase 2 sample size of 37. This study is expected to acc rue 9 patients to the Phase 1b, for a combined APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7

6 TREATMENT PLAN6.1 Preparation and Administration
Treatment will be administered in an outpatient basis. Reported adverse events (AEs) and 
potential risks are described in Section 9 . Appropriate dose modifications are described in 
Section 0 . No other investigational or commercial drugs or therapies other than that described 
below may be administered with the intent to treat the subject.
The amount of tivozanib dispensed to the subject at the beginning of each dosing cycle will be 
sufficient to allow for 3 weeks (21 days) of consecutive once-daily dosing of tivozanib. Only 21 capsules will be dispensed per cycle. In the case of a dose reduction patient will be given 10 capsules for every other day dosing for 10 doses.
Tivozanib capsules will be dispensed for oral use only and taken daily for 21 days and off for 
7 days. The intended dose is 1 mg daily on Day 1 through Day 21 and no drug on Day 22 through Day 28, in a 28-day cycle. Patients start Cycle 2 after Day 28 and repeat dosing from Day 1 to Day 21. In the case of dose reduction patients will be intended to take 1 mg every other day starting on Day 1. After 10 doses (every other day) patients will have no drug through the end of the 28-day cycle.  Patients will start the next cycle after Day 28 of the previous cycle.
The prescribed daily dose of tivozanib hydrochloride is to be taken, once per day (or every other 
day in the case of a dose reduction), preferably in the morning, with water, and with or without food. Only one capsule of tivozanib hydrochloride should be taken each dose. If a dose is vomited or otherwise missed that day for any reason, the dose for that day should not be made up. The next dose should be taken as prescribed at the next scheduled time (i.e., one capsule is to be taken even if the previous dose was vomited or otherwise missed; additional dose(s) should not be taken at any time to make up for any missed dose(s)). Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided during the study.
In the event that tivozanib hydrochloride dosing is interrupted, the duration of cycle/treatment 
will not be extended; doses missed during the interruption will be captured as omitted rather than delayed.

6.2 Dose Modifications
6.2.1 Definition of Dose-Limiting Toxicity 
A DLT is any Grade 3 or higher toxicity that is possible, probable, or definitely related to study 
drug.
Management and dose modifications associated with the above AEs are outlined in the below 
sections. Dose level will be, considered tolerable following completion of 1st cycle of treatment. APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study No.: I 229112
122216 Page 27 of 76Patients who experience a DLT will be dose reduced to the next lower dose cohort for 
continuation on the study.
6.2.2 Treatment Delay
Clinical judgment will be used to determine appropriate management of the subject experiencing 
any adverse event (AE). The suggested criteria for dose modification for tivozanib hydrochloride drug-related AEs are summarized in the table below.

Grade 4Interrupt dosing until toxicity resolves to 
grade < 1.Dosing may resume at reduced dose (see 
below for dose reduction guidelines).
1 Hypertension must be treated as described in Section 6.2.5 prior to any dose modification
6.2.3 Tivozanib Hydrochloride Dose Interruption
Subjects with drug related Grade 3/4 AEs should have their dose interrupted to allow for 
resolution of toxicities to grade < 1. The exception is HTN, which must first, be treated as 
described in Section 6.2.5  prior to any dose modification. Dosing interruptions of ≤ 2 weeks will 
be allowed. Upon resolution of toxicities to ≤ grade 1, dosing may resume at one dose level 
below the current dose, based on the Investigator’s discretion for an individual subject’s safety and tolerability. Doses missed during a drug interruption are not to be made up. If dosing is interrupted for > 2 weeks, dosing should be discontinued, unless there is clear benefit from treatment. 
6.2.4 Tivozanib Hydrochloride Dose Reduction
Dose reductions of  tivozanib by 0.5 mg/day will be required for patients with ≥ Grade 3 
drug-related adverse events.  This excludes grade ≥ 3 hypertension, nausea, vomiting, and 
diarrhea, without adequate supportive care.  Hypertension, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may resume at the same dose level after adequate supportive care, in the investigators opinion it is safe to proceed at the same dose level.  If hypertension, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting recurs despite adequate supportive care tivozanib must be dose reduced, up to 2 dose reductions are allowed. Once a patient’s dose of tivozanib is reduced, it may not be re-escalated through the APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7

will be used, as 0.5 mg capsules are no longer manufactured. According to the drug manufacturer AVEO Pharmaceuticals, this dosing regimen will achieve comparable exposure to 0.5 mg QD, based on the half-life of Tivozanib. 
6.2.5 Management of Hypertension
Hypertension (HTN) that occurs during study treatment must be treated with anti-hypertensive 
drugs prior to any dose reduction. Recommended management of HTN for subjects receiving study drug is presented in Appendix C  and Appendix D .
Persistent HTN is defined as 2 consecutive elevated blood pressure (BP) measurements 
preferably taken in the clinic and obtained at least 1 hour apart. It is recommended that 24-48 hours should elapse between the decision steps. For a listing of recommended DHP (dihydropyridine) calcium channel blockers, angiot ensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, 
and angiotensin receptor blockers, see Appendix D , Recommended Anti-hypertensive 
Medications. Note: If a subject has controlled HTN on an anti-hypertensive regimen at baseline 
and then develops a worsening of HTN requiring more intensive therapy than the previous regimen, this would be considered Grade 3 HTN.
6.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care
Agents known to be Cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) strong inhibitors and inducers must be 
avoided for the duration of tivozanib treatment. Appropriate replacement drugs will be prescribed with the help of clinical Pharmacist.  An individual patient’s risk/benefit should be 
taken into account when administration of a CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer is required as these agents may decrease serum concentrations of tivozanib, potentially impairing efficacy. For a complete list and additional information, refer to the following website: http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx.
Since there is a potential for interaction of tivozanib with other concomitantly administered 
drugs through the CYP3A4 system, the electronic case report form (eCRF) must capture the concurrent use of all other drugs, over-the-counter medications, or alternative therapies. The Investigator should be alerted if the patient is  taking any agent known to affect or with the 
potential to affect selected CYP450 inhibitors and inducers.
Patients may be pretreated for nausea and vomiting with appropriate anti-emetics.
6.4 Treatment Discontinuation
Patients with non-hematologic Grade 4 drug related adverse events will permanently discontinue 
study drug unless the patient has experienced objective evidence of benefit and the investigator has determined that it is reasonably safe to continue treatment despite the occurrence of a life threatening adverse event.  If a patient has dose interruption ≤ 2 weeks from the next scheduled 
dose, missed doses will not be made up (i.e., cycle duration will remain unchanged). If any drug-related toxicity results in interruption of dosing of > 2 weeks from the next scheduled dose, the subject should be discontinued from tivozanib, unless there is clear benefit from treatment.APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study No.: I 229112
122216 Page 29 of 76Upon treatment discontinuation, all end of study evaluations and tests will be conducted. All 
subjects who discontinue due to an AE must be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes. Appropriate medical care should be provided until signs and symptoms have abated, stabilized, or until abnormal laboratory findings have returned to acceptable or pre-study limits. The final status of the AE will be reported in the subject’s medical records and the appropriate eCRF.
Reasons for treatment discontinuation should be classified as follows:
•Death
•Progressive disease
•Treatment-related toxicity
•Toxicity unrelated to treatment
•Investigator judgment
oThe Investigator may withdraw a subject if, in his/her judgment, it is in the 
subject’s best interest to do so.
•Noncompliance
•Subject voluntary withdrawal
oA subject may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason. If a subject 
discontinues treatment, an attempt should be made to obtain information regarding the reason for withdrawal.
•Early withdrawal of subject(s)
•Sponsor decision.
6.5 Compliance
Patients will be instructed to record date for each day and the total number of pills taken each 
day ( Appendix E ). Dosing compliance will be monitored at each clinic visit. Phase 1b patients 
who do not complete at least 80% of the prescribed dose in Cycle 1 for reasons other than DLT will be replaced. Otherwise, if a patient has 2 consecutive cycles of less than 50% compliance, 
the patient will be deemed non-compliant and come off study. At the discretion of the investigator, if the patient is benefiting from the treatment the patient may continue on study. 
Patients who come off study, due to non-compliance, will not be replaced.

8 EFFICACY EVALUATIONS8.1 Objective Tumor Response
All protocol-defined imaging studies must be performed at the investigative site or sponsor-
approved facility using protocol-defined parameters. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. RECIST 1.1 will be used to assess objective tumor response.
8.2 Target Lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, will be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions will be selected on the basis of their size. Lesions with the longest diameter (short axis for lymph nodes) and are ≥ 10 mm (CT and MRI), ≥ 15 mm lymph 
nodes, > 20 mm CXR and are for accurate repetitive measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically) will be chosen. A sum of the longest diameter (short axis for lymph nodes) of all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. This will be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease.
•Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any lymph nodes must have 
a reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. Changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat studies performed no less than 6 weeks after the criteria for response are first met.
•Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat studies performed no less than 6 weeks after the criteria for response are first met.
•Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as references the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: I 229112
122216 Page 41 of 76an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression.
•Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest  sum diameter while on study. Subjects having 
a documented response with no confirmation of the response will be listed with stable disease.
8.3 Non-Target Lesions
All other small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or lymph nodes ≥ 10 mm to < 15 mm short 
axis) and non-measurable lesions (i.e., leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, blastic bone lesions, or abdominal masses / abdominal organomeg aly identified by physical exam that is not 
measurable by imaging) should be identified as non-target lesions and indicated as present in the source documents at baseline. The general location will also be documented on the images drawing a regularly-shaped Region of Interest. Measurements of the non-target lesions will not be performed, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up and evaluation.
•Complete Response: Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level, if applicable. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
•Non-Complete Response/Non-Progressive Disease: Persistence of 1 or more non-target 
lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the upper limits of normal.
•Progressive Disease: Appearance of 1 or more new lesions or the unequivocal progression 
of existing non-target lesions. Although a clear progression of non-target lesions is exceptional, in such circumstances, the opinion of the treating physician should prevail and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time.
8.4 Evaluation of Response
Time point response assessments will be performed every 8 weeks (timed to coincide with the 
end of a cycle) with a confirmatory assessment (required for non-randomized trials) within 6 weeks after a PR or CR is deemed. To determine time point response, refer to Table 5  and 
below.APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7

Not all evaluated No NE
Unequivocal PD Yes or No PD
Any Yes PD
1 Non-CR/non-PD is preferred over SD for non-target disease since SD is used as endpoint for assessment of 
efficacy in trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of study treatment until the end of treatment taking into account any requireme nt for confirmation. In general, the subject’s 
best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria and will be determined by combining the subject’s status of target lesions, non-target lesions, and new lesions.
•Residual Disease:  Any measurable tumor that was considered a target or non-target or new 
lesion ≥ 1 cm.
•Symptomatic Deterioration: Subjects with global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time, and not related to study treatment or other medical conditions should be reported as progressive disease due to “symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment due to symptomatic deterioration. Symptomatic deterioration that may lead to discontinuation of treatment include, but is not limited to, symptoms such as:
oWeight loss > 10% of body weight.APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: I 229112
122216 Page 43 of 76oWorsening of disease-related symptoms (e.g., worsening dyspnea, increasing 
pain/increasing requirement for narcotic analgesics).
oDecline in performance status of > 1 level on ECOG scale.
8.5 Confirmation Measurement
Response will be confirmed within 6 weeks.
8.6 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline a nd during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.
•Clinical Lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.
•Chest x-ray: Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable.
•Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for body scans).
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe  specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all 
scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.
•PET-CT: At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET-
CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: I 229112
122216 Page 44 of 76PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with 
conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.
•Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, becau se they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and meas urements will be taken from one assessment to 
the next. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.
•Endoscopy, Laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation 
is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological 
response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.
•Tumor Markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a subject to be considered in complete clinical response.
•Cytology, Histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable  disease (an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive disease.
•FDG-PET: While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:
•Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion.
•No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD. If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan). If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
•FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: I 229112
122216 Page 45 of 76The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol 
and supported by disease-specific medical literature for the indication. However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.
Note: A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.
9 SAFETY EVALUATION9.1 Adverse Events9.1.1 Definition
An adverse event or adverse experience (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated 
with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. Therefore, an AE can be ANY unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (i nvestigational) product (attribution of ‘unrelated’, 
‘unlikely’, ‘possible’, ‘probable’, or ‘definite’).
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been observed; or if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan in other study-related documents.
9.1.1.1 Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the CRF rather than individual signs and symptoms 
(e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be clinically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up information.
9.1.1.2 Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) 
should be identified by their primary cause. For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the CRF.
However, clinically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated 
in time should be recorded as independent events on the CRF. For example, if a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on the CRF.APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: I 229112
122216 Page 46 of 769.1.1.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management will be 
recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF (e.g., abnormalities that require study drug dose modification, discontinuation of study treatment, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.).
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 x the upper limit of normal associated with cholecystitis), only the diagnosis (e.g., cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF.
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the 
abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE  or SAE on the CRF. If the laboratory abnormality 
can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE or SAE. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia”
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF, unless their severity, seriousness, or etiology changes.
9.1.1.4 Preexisting Medical Conditions (Baseline Signs and Symptoms)
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, 
severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on an Adverse Event CRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).
9.1.2 Grading and Relationship to Drug
The descriptions and grading scales found in the CTEP Version 4 of the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be utilized for AE reporting. CTEP Version 4 of the CTCAE is identified and located at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
AEs not covered by specific terminology listed should be reported with common medical 
terminology, and documented according to the grading scales provided in the CTCAE Version 4.
The relationship of event to study drug will be documented by the Investigator as follows:
•Unrelated: The event is clearly related to other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs administered to the patient.
•Unlikely: The event is doubtfully related to investigational agent(s). The event was most 
likely related to other factors such as the patient’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs.APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: I 229112
122216 Page 47 of 76•Possible: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, but could have been produced by other factors such as the patient’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs.
•Probable: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and follows a known response pattern to the study drug. The event cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the patient’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs.
•Definite: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, follows a known response pattern to the study drug, cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the patient’s condition, therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs; AND occurs immediately following study drug administration, improves upon stopping the drug, or reappears on re-exposure.

9.2.1 Definition
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event (experience) that in the opinion of either the 
investigator or sponsor results in ANY  of the following:
•Death.
•A life-threatening adverse event (experience). Any AE that places a patient or patients, in the 
view of the Investigator or sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred. It does NOT  include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.
•Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (for > 24 hours).
•A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.
•A congenital anomaly or birth defect.
•Important Medical Event (IME) that, based upon medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient or patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.
9.2.2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events (Network Sites see Appendix A )
All new SAEs occurring from the date the patient signs the study consent until 30 days after the 
last intervention or a new treatment is started, whichever comes first, will be reported. 
The RPCI SAE Source Form is to be completed with all available information, including a brief 
narrative describing the SAE and any other relevant information. 
SAEs occurring after the 30 day follow-up period that the investigator determines to be possibly, 
probably or definitely related to the study intervention should be reported.
SAEs identified as an Unanticipated Problem by the Investigator must be reported. Please refer 
to Section 9.3.2 for details on reporting Unanticipated Problems.
9.2.3 Follow-Up for Serious Adverse Events
All related SAEs should be followed to their resolution, until the study patient is lost to follow 
up, the start of a new treatment, or until the study investigator assesses the event(s) as stable or irreversible. New information will be reported when it is received.APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: I 229112
122216 Page 49 of 769.3 Unanticipated Problems
9.3.1 Definition
An Unanticipated Problem (UP) is any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:
•Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given:
oThe research procedures that are described in the study-related documents, 
including study deviations, as well as issues related to compromise of patient privacy or confidentiality of data.
oThe characteristics of the patient population being studied.
•Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research).
•Suggests that the research places patients or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized and if in relation to an AE is also deemed Serious  per Section 9.2 .
9.3.2 Reporting Unanticipated Problems
Unanticipated problem reporting will begin at the time of participant consent. An Unanticipated 
Problem shall be submitted to the CRS Compliance Office as “Reportable New Information” in the Click system within 1 business day of becoming aware of the Unanticipated Problem. After review, CRS Compliance will submit the UP to the IRB. 
When becoming aware of new information about an Unanticipated Problem, submit the updated 
information to CRS Compliance as “Reportable New Information” in the Click system.

reporting.
9.4 Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Study Sponsor
Adverse events, both serious and non-serious, and deaths that occur during the patient’s study 
participation (from time of the first dose of tivozanib, written informed consent through 30 days after receiving the last dose of tivozanib hydrochloride) will be documented. All subjects receiving at least 1 dose of tivozanib hydrochloride, whether completing the treatment period or not, should be followed for 30 days after the last dose of tivozanib hydrochloride. New AEs and changes in ongoing AEs or those with an unknown outcome must be followed for 30 days after the last dose of tivozanib hydrochloride. All SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).

9.5 FDA Reporting
This protocol is being conducted under a RPCI, IND and it is the responsibility of the study IND 
holder to report certain AEs or Unanticipated Problems to the FDA.
RPCI’s Compliance Office will report Network Site reports to the FDA. The following describes the FDA reporting requirements by timeline for AEs and new safety 
findings that meet the criteria outlined below:
Within 7 Calendar DaysAny adverse event that meets ALL  the following criteria:
•Related or possibly related to the use of the study drug;
•Unexpected; and
•Fatal or life-threatening.
Within 15 Calendar DaysAny adverse event that meets ALL  the following criteria:
•Related or possibly related to the use of the study drug;
•Unexpected; and
•Serious but not fatal or life-threatening.APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7

122216 Page 51 of 76Or meets ANY  of the following criteria:
•A previous adverse event that is not initially deemed reportable but is later found to fit the 
criteria for reporting (report within 15 days from when event was deemed reportable).
•Any findings from other studies, including epidemiological studies, pooled analysis of multiple studies, or other clinical studies conducted with the study drug that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug.
•Any findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure.
•Any clinically important increase in the rate of occurrence of a serious, related or possibly related adverse event over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Sponsors are also required to identify in IND safety reports, all previous reports concerning 
similar adverse events and to analyze the signi ficance of the current event in the light of the 
previous reports.
Reporting ProcessThe principal investigator or designee will complete and submit a FDA Form 3500A for any 
event that meets the above criteria. Forms will be submitted to the CRS Compliance Office via email: CRSCompliance@Roswellpark.org . The Compliance office will send the form to the 
Administrator of ORSP.
9.6 Procedures for Reporting Subject Death
Any death experienced by a subject after enro llment through 30 days of receiving the last dose of 
tivozanib hydrochloride, regardless of relationship to study drug, or any death that occurs more than 30 days after receiving study drug that is believed to be study drug-related must be promptly reported (within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event) by telephone, telefax, 
or e-mail transmission to AVEO Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety. Reports of all on-study deaths must also be communicated promptly to the FDA (if applicable) and the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) and/or reported in accordance with local law and regulations.
9.7 Procedures for Reporting Study Drug Overdose
An overdose of tivozanib hydrochloride should be reported if the dose of tivozanib 
hydrochloride administered is greater than the assigned dose for the subject.
Should a subject experience an overdose during the course of the study (whether symptomatic or 
not, and regardless of seriousness), the Sponsor-Investigator or qualified designee must complete a Medwatch Form 3500A to report the overdose to AVEO Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the overdose. Follow-up information on the outcome of the overdose should be forwarded to the AVEO Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety.
Any event associated with, or observed in conjunction with, a product overdose (whether 
accidental or intentional) or a product abuse and/or withdrawal is considered an AE and should APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: I 229112
122216 Page 52 of 76be reported as such. If a SAE occurs in conjunction with the overdose, then the reporting time 
frame for a SAE should be followed.
9.8 Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure During Pregnancy and Birth Events
All pregnancies, including pregnancies in female partners of male study participants, occurring 
from the date of ICF signature until 45 days following tivozanib hydrochloride administration must be documented. If it is confirmed that a study participant has become pregnant while participating in this trial, study drug administration will be discontinued immediately. Any pregnancy occurring during this study will be reported immediately to AVEO Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety.
The Sponsor-Investigator must actively follow-up, document and report the outcome of any 
pregnancy even if the subject has withdrawn from the study. The Sponsor-Investigator will then report follow-up information to AVEO Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Timelines vary according to the nature of the pregnancy outcome:
•For normal outcomes, AVEO Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety should be notified within 45 days from birth/delivery.
•For abnormal outcomes, the fully completed Medwatch Form 3500A must be sent to AVEO Pharmacovigilance/Drug Safety according to the same procedures and timelines described for expedited AE reporting.

10 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING
Phase 1 studies will be reviewed at the scheduled RPCI Phase 1 meetings and the minutes are 
forwarded to the IRB for review.
The RPCI Data and Safety Monitoring Board will assess the progress of the study, the safety 
data, and critical efficacy endpoints. The DSMB will review the study annually and will make recommendations that include but not limited to; (a) continuation of the study, (b) modifications to the design (c) or termination of the study.
11 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY
This is a Phase 1b/2 study to assess the safety and efficacy of tivozanib therapy in HCC patients. 
The Phase 1b portion follows a modified 3+3 design (refer to Section 3.3 ), and provides limited 
toxicity information about tivozanib therapy in this patient population. The Phase 2 portion is a two-stage, single arm, unblinded trial allowing for early termination in case of futility. Phase 1b patients treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose will be included in the Phase 2 trial.
11.1 Phase 1b
To compensate for the current lack of toxicity information about tivozanib treatment in this 
patient population, the safety cohort begins by enrolling 3 patients at Dose Level 1. Then APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: I 229112
122216 Page 53 of 76modified 3 + 3 decision rules are followed to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose. Dose 
decision rules are specified in Section 3.3 . A schematic of the Phase 1b design is shown in 
Figure 1 . The recommended Phase 2 dose will be considered tolerable if DLT(s) are observed in 
at most 1 of 6 patients completing at least 1 treatment cycles at that dose level.
The Phase 1b design requires between 6 and 18 patients. Available information about tivozanib 
treatment suggests Dose Level 2 will be the recommended Phase 2 dose. Under this scenario, the safety cohort will consist of 9 patients. The 6 safety cohort patients treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose will be included in Stage 1 of the Phase 2 study.
Phase 1b patients who do not complete at least 80% of the prescribed dose in Cycle 1 for reasons 
other than DLT will be replaced.
11.2 Phase 2
The Phase 2 study proceeds in 2 stages, and allows for early stopping for futility. The primary 
endpoint is the percentage of PFS responders, defined as patients who survive without disease progression (per RECIST criteria) for least 24 weeks past enrollment.
Stage 1:  Enroll  patients, including the safety cohort patients treated at the Phase 2 dose. 
  #
If 9 or fewer PFS responses are observed, the therapy will be deemed ineffective and the study 
will end. Otherwise, the study will proceed to the second stage.
Stage 2:  Enroll an additional  patients. If  or fewer PFS responses are observed $ % &$'
among the total  patients, the therapy will be deemed ineffective; otherwise, it will be  ($')
concluded that the therapy is promising. Under the null hypothesis of a 50% PFS rate at 
24 weeks, the probability of stopping early for futility is 50%. Under the alternative of a 70% PFS rate, this probability is 3.3%. Patients who die or withdraw from the study prior to the 24th week will be counted as events. These patients will not be replaced. The nominal significance level of this design is .
!*!+
11.3 Sample Size Determination
Between 6 and 18 patients will be enrolled in Phase 1b portion. Six Phase 1b patients treated at 
the recommended Phase 2 dose will be included in the Phase 2 portion of this study. An additional 31 patients will be enrolled for the Phase 2 portion of this study, for a total Phase 2 sample size of 37. This study is expected to acc rue 9 patients to the Phase 1b, for a combined 
sample of size 40 (=9+37-6). If 18 patients are enrolled in the Phase 1b, the maximum combined sample size is 49 (=18+37-6).
The sample size calculation is based on testing hypotheses concerning the proportion of the 
treated population alive and disease free 24 weeks after enrollment. Let p represent the proportion of patients surviving with no evidence of disease progression by RECIST at 24 weeks after enrollment. A true progression rate of less than p0 = 0.50 is considered unacceptable and evidence of such will deem the treatment not worthy of further study. The null and alternative hypotheses to be tested are H0:p = p0 versus H1: p > p0.APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: I 229112
122216 Page 54 of 76This 2-stage design requires a potential total of 37 patients to achieve approximately  power  ,
to detect a difference of at least Δ percentage points (p0 versus p0 + Δ). For calculations in this 
study, p0 = 0.50, α = 0.05, 1 - β = 0.80 and Δ = 0.20. With these design parameters, the sample 
size was calculated using the web calculator located at http://cryptnet.net/kepner/.17
11.4 Randomization
This is a nonrandomized study.
11.5 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Descriptive statistics and statistical plots will be used to summarize changes in biomarkers levels 
in blood and changes in viral titers. The paired t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and McNemar’s 
test will be used for within-patient comparisons of changes in biomarker levels across times. The 
repeated measures modelling may be used to explore the effects of exogenous factors (i.e., diabetes, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.) on the changes in biomarkers and viral titers. The effects of biomarkers on clinical benefit rate (CR+PR) will be assessed using logistic regression and the effects on time-to-event data (overall survival and progression free survival) will be estimated by Cox model.
11.6 Efficacy Analysis
The efficacy sample includes all patients enrolled in the Phase 2 study, plus Phase 1b patients 
treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose.  Patients removed from the study for non-compliance will be counted as events in the efficacy analyses.
The primary endpoint will be progression free survival at 24 weeks using standard RECIST 
criteria. All enrolled patients will be included in assessment of the primary endpoint. Time-to-progression will be descriptively analyzed using standard Kaplan-Meier estimation along with the corresponding descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals.
Secondary endpoints will include, overall survival, toxicity, clinical benefit rate (CR+ PR+ SD). 
Correlative endpoints will also include AFP response, antiviral effect (if any in those with HBV or HCV associated HCC) and exploration for any correlation between drug exposure (assessed by steady state PK) and response/ survival an d toxicity by quartiles of drug exposure will be 
exploratory.
11.7 Safety Analysis
The safety sample will include all patients exposed to the study drug.Toxicity frequency will be tabulated by grade acros s all dose levels and cycles for all patients in 
the safety sample, and for the subset treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose. These tables will be produced at 3 time points:
1. At the end of the Phase 1b study.2. At the Phase 2 interim analysis.3. At the Phase 2 final analysis.APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: I 229112
122216 Page 55 of 7611.8 Interim Analysis and Criteria for Early Termination of the Study
No explicit interim analysis is planned for the Phase 1b dose-finding portion of the study. 
However, during this phase, observed toxicities will be monitored and discussed weekly by RPCI’s Phase 1 Committee. Potential early termination decisions are inherent in the Phase 1 study monitoring.
The Phase 2 design includes a formal interim analysis, allowing for early termination if the 
experimental treatment is deemed ineffective. Early termination rules are detailed in Section 11.2 .
12 CORRELATIVE DATA ANALYSIS12.1 Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis
Using data collected from PK and PD samples, a population PK/PD model will be developed to 
characterize the time course of tivozanib concentrations in relation to target increases in VEGF-A and decreases in sVEGFR-2. Subsequently, diagnostic plots will be created to ascertain whether a trend exists in VEGF-A and sVEGFR-2 changes, immunological biomarker response, viral load and progression free survival (PFS). If trends exists, these endpoints will also be included in the PK/PD model. A variety of comp artmental population pharmacokinetic structural 
models will be evaluated using a nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach, NONMEM
®. The 
physiologic pharmacokinetic models explored will be described by the estimation of mean 
structural model parameters (e.g., plasma volumes of distribution and clearances), the magnitude of inter-individual variability (IIV) in these parameters, and the magnitude of residual variability (RV). The model for IIV will be assumed that the variance is proportional with respect to the typical value of the pharmacokinetic parameter, and the estimates are presented as percent coefficients of variation. This analysis will include evaluation of the influence of a limited number of patient covariates, such as patient de mographics along with other patient cofactors, on 
the variability in select PK/PD parameters. Based on our sparse sampling approach, prior information on PK parameter estimates and variances can be used with a Bayesian estimation method to drive the model analysis. This allows for a smaller number of samples to be taken while still providing enough information to achieve sufficient model fitting. For each model, the fit will be assessed by examination of several diagnostics. For comparisons of hierarchical models, the change in the minimum value of the objective function (MVOF), a statistic that is proportional to minus twice the log likelihood of the data, will be examined. This change 
represents a statistic which is asymptotically distributed like χ
2, with degrees of freedom equal to 
the number of parameters added to or deleted from the model. For example, a change in the 
MVOF of ≥ 7.88 between two hierarchical models represents a statistically significant difference 
at an α-level of 0.005 for the addition of one parameter (df = 1). The goodness-of-fit of 
NONMEM® analyses will be additionally assessed by examination of the following: 
(1) scatterplots of measured concentrations and weighted residuals versus population predicted 
concentrations, and weighted residuals versus time since first and last dose; (2) scatterplots of measured concentrations, individual weighted residuals, and absolute individual weighted residuals versus individual predicted concentrations; (3) the precisions of the parameter estimates APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7

estimate x 100% ); (4) changes in the estimates of interindividual (IIV) and residual variability (RV); and (5) histograms, boxplots, and plots of quantiles of individual and population weighted 
residuals versus quantiles of the normal distribution (QQ plots).
12.2 Immune Biomarker
Interest is in the effect of tivozanib on several tumor-associated immune response markers. One 
pre- and two post-treatment measurements will be obtained from each tivozanib-treated patient who completes at least two treatment cycles. Post-treatment measurements will be obtained at 
Day 56, and at the end of follow up (either documented disease progression, death or one year of progression-free survival). These immune marker measurements will be presented as continuous variables.
Primary interest is in the change in immune system measurements obtained at baseline and the 
end of Cycle 2 (Day 56). Using (linear) mixed model methods, the change in expression measurement outcomes will be modeled against a random patient effect, and fixed-effects for time (pre vs post), patient status at Day 56 (progression/death or not) and the status-by-time interaction. Fixed effects for other exogenous effects (e.g. presence of hepatitis B/C, cirrhosis, diabetes, etc) may also be included. Mixed model methods account for the hierarchical (within patient) covariance in the outcome measurements, and missing outcome observations for patients who die/withdraw before finishing Cycle 2.
The magnitude, direction and reliability of the change estimate will be described using the fitted 
parameter estimate for time and its 95% confidence limits. If the immune measurements change estimate, depends on the patient status (i.e., if the status-by-time interaction is statistically significant), the change will be estimated and tested within progression strata using contrast statements.
For power calculations, we assume paired (pre/post) standardized observations are available for 
37 patients, and significance threshold of 0.05. If the change in immune measurements does not depend on progression status, then this experiment can be considered as a paired t-test. This test has 80% power to detect a 0.47 standard deviation shift in mean immune measurement.
If the change in immune measurements depends on progression status, we further assume a 
within-patient correlation coefficient of 0.2. This ANCOVA-type model combination gives 80% power to detect a 1.6 standard deviation differe nce in the progression strata specific regression 
line slopes.
Appropriate functional forms for the mean function will be explored using means by time box 
plots, scatter plots, and other methods. Within-patient and time correlations will be explored using profile plots. Compliance with modeling assumptions will be assessed by examination of residual plots. PRESS residuals will be utilized to identify possible influential observations. The marker measurements may be transformed to satisfy distributional assumptions. Correlations between marker values will be tested using Spearman Rank correlation methods, and visualized using spline-augmented scatter plots.APPROVED RPCI Institutional Review Board: 3/27/201 7
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: I 229112
122216 Page 57 of 76In all, we expect a total of 8 immune measurements for each patient at each time point (four 
marker measurements, and four phosphorylation measurements). Methods proposed by Hochberg will be used to control the overall (family-wise) Type I error rate to 0.05.
In exploratory analyses, the three expression measurement outcomes for each patient will be 
modeled using (linear) mixed model methods with fixed-effects for time, cumulative dose, patient status (progressed, died, other), exogenous factors and the second order interactions with patient status. The effects of baseline expression measures on progression free and overall survival will be assessed using multivariable proportional hazards models, with adjustment for possible confounding factors. Survival distributions will be obtained using the product-limit based Kaplan Meier methods, with descriptive quantities such as median survival time and corresponding 95% confidence intervals.
13 ETHICAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS13.1 Ethical Principles
This study will not be initiated until the protocol and informed consent document(s) have been

14 STUDY RESPONSIBILITIES14.1 Data Collection
Data entry into the database is to be completed in a timely fashion (within 30 days) after the 
subject’s clinic visit. If an AE is considered serious it is captured on both the Adverse Event page 
and the Serious Adverse Event Form, which is handled in an expedited fashion.
Data management activities will be performed using EXPeRT. EXPeRT is a suite of software 
tools that enables the collection, cleaning and viewing of clinical trial data. CRS data management will design the study-specific database and facilitate its development by the EXPeRT Information Technology team. Once the database design is approved by the Investigator, Statistician, and Clinical Research Coordinator, the database will be put into production and data entry can begin. Data can be entered and changed only by those with the rights to do so into the eCRFs. EXPeRT is compliant with all relevant technical aspects of relevant GCP guidelines.

1) Obtain at least 4 ml of a random urine sample (does not have to be a 24-hour urine)
2) Determine protein concentration (mg/dL)3) Determine creatinine concentration (mg/dL)4) Divide #2 by #3 above: urine protein / creatinine ratio = protein concentration (mg /dL) /Creatinine concentration (mg/ dL)
The UPC directly correlates with the amount of protein excreted in the urine per 24 hrs (i.e. a 
UPC of I should be equivalent to 1 g protein in a 24hr urine collection)
Protein and creatinine concentrations should be available on standard reports of urinalyses, not

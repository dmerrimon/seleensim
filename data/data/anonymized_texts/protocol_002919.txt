Name of Sponsor: Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
Name of Investigational Product: Dasotraline (SEP -225289) 
Title of Study: An Open-label, Flexibly -dosed, Multicenter, Extension Study of Dasotraline to 
Evaluate Long-term Safety and Tolerability in Adults with Binge-eating Disorder  
Proposed Indication : Binge-eating Disorder  
Study Centers: ~ 61 clinical sites in the United States  
Planned Study Period:  35 months  
Study Objectives: 
Primary: To evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of flexibly -dosed dasotraline (4, 6, or 
8 mg/day) in adults with binge-eating disorder (BED) who have completed a prior daso traline study in 
BED by: 
•The incidence of adverse events (AEs), discontinuations due to AEs, and serious AEs
(SAEs)
•The frequency and severity of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior using theColumbia - Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS)
•Changes in  12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG s), vital signs, body weight, body mass index
(BMI), and clinical laboratory results
Secondary: 
•To assess potential withdrawal effects of dasotraline using the following assessments
(administered during the withdrawal period):
− Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment (CSSA)
− Discontinuation- Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) Scale
− Symptoms of anxiety utilizing the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM -A)
− Symptoms of depression utilizing the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scal e
(MADRS) 
•To assess the abuse potential of dasotraline utilizing a comprehensive abuse potential
monitoring plan (APMP)
•To evaluate the long -term effectiveness of flexibly -dosed dasotraline in the treatment of
adults with BED as measured by  the following :
− Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE- Q) modified
− Binge-eating Clinical Global Impressions - Severity ( BE-CGI-S)
Protocol Study No. SEP360-322, Version 4.00  Dasotraline  
 
Confidential and Proprietary 5 13 Jun 2017 
 − Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)  
• To assess subject -reported health status using t he Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short 
Form Survey In strument ( SF-12)1 
Study Design: This is a Phase 3, 12-month, multicenter, open- label, flexibly -dosed, safety study in 
adults with  BED. This study is projected to enroll approximately 500 subjects based on the number of 
subjects expected to complete treatm ent in the core studies ( ie, SEP360-221 or SEP360-321). 
Informed consent will be obtained from all subjects after all procedures from the core study have been 
completed  and before any study procedures unique to this study are performed. Safety and tolerabi lity 
will be monitored throughout the study by AE reports, physical and neurological examination s, 12-lead 
ECG, vital signs, body weight, BMI, clinical laboratories (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, 
hemoglobin A1c, and lipid panel), and C- SSRS. Effectiveness will be evaluated using the BE-CGI-S, 
EDE-Q modified, and SDS . Subject-reported health status will be assessed using the SF-12 (subjects 
from Study SEP360-221 only). Assessment of potential withdrawal effects of dasotraline will be 
conducted via administration of the CSSA, DESS, HAM -A, and MADRS at the end of treatment and 
during the 3-week study medication withdrawal period. 
A comprehensive Abuse Potential Monitoring Plan (APMP ; see Section 24) for dasotraline designed to 
detect potential abuse of the compound and to more closely monitor AEs consistent with the known pharmacology for dasotraline will be implemented. 
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety data including data on 
adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) at regular intervals. 
Subjects will self -administer study drug on an outpatient basis for 12 months, once a day at 
approximately the same time each morning with or without food, including on the day s when clinic 
visits occur. Subjects meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will start taking open -label study 
drug on Day 1, the morning following the OL Baseline visit (ie, Week 12 visit in the core study).  
The total daily dose will remain betw een 4 mg/day and 8  mg/day for the 12-month treatment period. 
Dasotraline  will be dosed at 4 mg/day for the first 2  weeks of the study. At the Week  2 visit, the dose 
may be increased to 6 mg/day. Thereafter the dose may be increased or decreased by 2  mg/day, as 
necessary for effectiveness or tolerability  reasons at the discretion of the investigator . A minimum of 
8 days is required between dose increases. Dose decreases may be made at less than 8 day intervals, at 
the investigator’s discretion, for reasons o f safety or tolerability.  If, in the judgment of the investigator, 
the subject does not tolerate the minimum required dose (4 mg/day), he or she will be discontinued 
from the study. 
All changes in study drug dose will begin the morning after the visit at w hich the dose change decision 
is made and using  the new package of study drug. 
The study will consist of a baseline visit, 12-month open-label treatment period, and 3-week study drug 
withdrawal period as shown in the Study Schematic ( Figure 1). During the treatment period, subjects 
will return to the clinic at the end of 2 and 4 weeks for clinical evaluation and thereafter will return to 
the clinic once every 4 weeks during the treatment period for scheduled visits.  At the approximate 
midpoint between the scheduled monthly visits (ie, 14 ± 2 days after a visit), the site staff will contact the subject via telephone, text, or email in order to monitor for SAEs, AEs, and concomitant 
medications, as well as to remind subjects about adherence to study drug administration, and upcoming 
visits. If necessary, an unscheduled visit can be arranged.

 Subjects will attend weekly visits during the 3 -week study drug withdrawal period. Assessment of 
potential withdrawal effects will be conducted via administration of the CSSA, DESS, HAM-A, and 
MADRS at the end of treatment. Subjects will undergo assessments every other day and weekly as 
follows: the CSSA and DESS will be completed every other day during the 3-week study medication 
withdrawal period. Clinical site staff will call the subject every other day, beginning the second day 
after the last dose of study drug, unless a clinic visit is scheduled for that day.  Phone contacts may be 
made up to 3 times per day if the clinical site st aff is unable to contact the subject on the first 
2 attempts. If the subject cannot be contacted on a given day, during the next contact the study site staff 
will retrospectively collect the missed CSSA and DESS, in addition to the current day’s CSSA and 
DESS, as necessary. Clinical site staff will record the responses in the subject’s source information and 
in the CRF with the contact date and time. The CSSA, DESS, HAM -A, and MADRS also will be 
administered at each weekly visit  during the withdrawal period. 
A window of ± 1 day will be allowed for each weekly clinic visit and telephone call during the study 
medication withdrawal period. 
After the last withdrawal period visit, all subjects will be referred for follow -up care as determined by 
the investigator.  
Number of Subjects (planned): This study is projected to enroll approximately 500 subjects based on 
the number of subjects expected to complete treatment in the core stud ies.

Confidential and Proprietary 9 13 Jun 2017 
 Subject-reported Health Status Endpoints:  
• Change in SF-12 two component scores (physical component, mental health component)2 
Statistical Methods:  
The safety population will include all subjects who receive at least one dose of study medication. A 
total of 2 analysis groups will be formed based on a sub ject’s previous participation  in the core study 
(previously randomized to dasotraline, previously randomized to placebo). A group that combines 
these 2 analysis groups also will be presented. Summary tables, wherever applicable, will be presented 
by analys is group, respectively. Where changes are reported, the reference will be to the pretreatment 
baseline from the core study, and indicated as “DB baseline”. Where relevant, changes from baseline for the open- label study, defined as the Week  12 assessment in  the double- blind study or the last 
assessment prior to the first dose of study medication in the open-label study, will also be reported, and 
will be referred to as the open -label study baseline or "OL baseline." Continuous variables will be 
summarized us ing descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, median, range, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] as needed) and categorical variables will be reported as frequencies and percentages. No 
statistical comparisons will be conducted  and no inferential stati stics on effectiveness and safety will be 
presented . 
Safety Analyses: The safety data will be analyzed by analysis group based on the safety population for 
the open-label treatment period (for data up to the end of treatment period) and withdrawal period ( for 
data collected during the withdrawal period), separately, as appropriate.  
Treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) and discontinuation- emergent adverse events (DEAE)  will 
be summarized (hereafter TEAE is referred as AE). The incidence of AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to 
discontinuation due to AEs (or SAEs) will be summarized by analysis group (by presenting the number and percentage of subjects with one or more AEs in each category). The number and proportion of 
subjects with one or more AEs within a system  organ class (SOC) or by preferred term will be 
presented by analysis group as well.  
For laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, lipid panel, hemoglobin A1c), weight, BMI, vital signs, neurological examination, and ECG parameters, descriptive statistics will be provided for 
observed values and changes from DB baseline and OL baseline for the continuous variables. Frequencies and percentages will be reported for categorical variables by study visit and analysis 
group. The markedly abnormal value s for selected safety parameters will be summarized, as 
appropriate. 
The number and percentage of subjects with suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior, emergence or 
worsening of suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior will be summarized by analysis group for the open-
label treatment period, and the withdrawal period, separately.  
The CSSA total score, DESS total score, MADRS total score, and HAM- A total score will be 
summarized by presenting descriptive statistics of observed values and change s from Week 52/EOT by 
treatment and visit for the withdrawal period.  
Analyses for Effectiveness and Subject-reported Health Status: Descriptive statistics of observed 
values and changes from DB baseline and OL baseline in BE -CGI-S score, EDE -Q modified  glob al 
and subscale scores ( restraint, shape concern, weight concern), EDE -Q modified i tems 4-6 scores, SDS 
total score and subscale scores (school/work disability, social life disability, and family life disability), 
and SF-12 (subjects from Study SEP360 -221) two compo nent scores (physical component, mental

Abbreviations: B SN = baseline; EOS  = End of Study; EOT  = End of Treatment; OL  = open label; V  = visit  
a Week 12 in core study. Baseline assessments indicated as “carried over” are primarily performed as part of Week 12 visit in the core study and do not need to be repeated; the 
data will be duplicated from Week  12 visit or other visits (such as for height) in the  core study.  
b Subjects who discontinue from the study prior to completion of treatment with study drug will be asked to return to the site and complete the EOT assessments within 1  day of 
discontinuation and complete the Withdrawal Period visits and  calls. 
c Subjects will take the first dose of study drug in this study on Day  1 (the morning following the baseline visit); there will be no break in study drug treatment between the core 
study and this extension study. All study drug will be administered by the subject once a day at approximately the same time each morning including on the days when clinic 
visits occur.  
d At the approximate midpoint between the scheduled monthly treatment period visits (ie, 14 ± 2 days after a visit), the site staff will conta ct the subject via telephone, text, or 
email to monitor for  SAEs, AEs, and concomitant medications, as well as to remind subjects about adherence to study drug administration and upcomi ng visits, following which 
an unscheduled visit may be scheduled, if ne cessary.

Confidential and Proprietary 16  13 Jun 2017 e Informed consent will be obtained from all subjects after all procedures from the core study have been completed and before any study procedures unique to this study are 
performed.  
f  Subjects must be fast ing for at least 8  hours (may have water) prior to  the indicated laboratory tests. Visits should be scheduled in the morning.  
g  The “Since Last Visit” version will be used. Subjects who answer “yes” to “suicidal ideation” item  4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or 
item 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) on the C-SSRS assessment at any time during the study must be referred to the Investigator for follow up 
evaluation.  
h The Structured Intervi ew Guide for the HAM -A (SIGH-A) will be used for the administration of the HAM -A. 
i The Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS (SIGMA) will be used for the administration of the MADRS.  
j Clinical site staff will call the subject every other day ( ± 1 day) during the study medication withdrawal period, beginning the second day after the last dose of study drug (unless 
a clinic visit is scheduled for that day) in order to collect the Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment (CSSA) and Discontinu ation-Emergent S igns and Symptoms (DESS). 
Clinical site staff may call up to 3  times per day if the clinical site staff are unable to contact the subject on the first 2 attempts. If the subject cannot be contacted on a given day, 
during the next contact the study site sta ff will retrospectively collect the CSSA and DESS from the missed day(s) and the current day, as necessary . 
k Any positive urine β -hCG test should be confirmed by serum β -hCG.

 4. INTRODUCTION 
4.1. Background  
Binge eating disorder (BED) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent episodes 
(on average at least once per week for 3  months) of excess food consumption during a limited 
time period, accompanied by feelings of loss of control and distress in the absence of regular 
compensatory behaviors characteristic of bulimia nervosa (BN) ( Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition [DSM -5]). BED is the most common eating disorder in 
the United States and Western Europe, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 2.5% in adults (~3.5 % in adult women, 2.0 % in adult men, and 1.6 % in adolesc ents) and a mean age of onset 
of 25.4 ± 1.2 years (McElroy-2012, Kessler-2013, Hudson-2007). Binge eating  disorder is 
defined in DSM- 5 as: 
• Recurrent episodes of binge eating characterized by both:  
− Eating an amount of food larger than what most people would eat, in a discrete 
period of time (eg, 2 hours) 
− Sense of lack of control over eating episode 
• Binge-eating episode associated with ≥ 3: 
− Eating much more rapidly than normal 
− Eating until uncomfortably full 
− Eating large amounts when not feeling hungry 
− Eating alone because of embarrassment  
− Feeling disgusted with oneself, guilty afterward  
• Marked distress regarding binge eating is present  
• Binge eating occurs, on average, at least once a week for 3 months 
• Not associated with recurrent use of compensatory behavior (eg, bulimia nervosa). 
Patients with BED show significantly higher prevalence or risk for a range of comorbid 
psychiatric and medical disorders when compared to healthy individuals. The majority of 
patients fulfill Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men tal Disorders, 4
th Edition (DSM-IV) 
criteria for one or more psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and phobias. BED 
patients also have a 2 -3 fold greater risk for physical ailments, including obesity, hypertension, 
diabetes mellitus, and ch ronic pain. Taken together, these findings signify that BED presents a 
major public health problem with significant social and economic conseque nces (Kessler -2013). 
Considering the severity of clinical symptomology, the negative impact on quality of life a nd 
physical measures of health, there is a significant need for safe and efficacious treatments for adults with BED.

 4.1.1. Neurobiology of Binge Eating Disorder 
Nonclinical and clinical studies have implicated dopamine, opioid, and norepinephrine systems 
within the brain reward circuit in the pathogenesis of eating and addictive disorders, including 
binge eating disorder ( Murray-2014, Gold- 2013, Smith-2013, Hoebel-1989). In particular, 
disturbances in dopamine and the dopamine D 2/3 receptor play a key role in binge eating, 
suggesting that drugs targeting disturbances in dopaminergic transmission may be effective in 
treating the disorder.  
Nonclinical studies show that rats continue to self-administer substances that act like dopamine, 
or stimulate dopamine release,  in response to a dysregulated reward circuit (Murray-2014, 
Ikemoto-1997, Carlezon -1995). Rats continuously fed a cafeteria diet or a high -fat, high sugar 
meal show reduced levels of dopamine and dopamine D 2/3 receptors in the dorsal striatum and 
nucleus accumbens that form part of the reward circuit ( van de Gies sen-2012, 
van de Giessen-2013). Knockout of striatal dopamine D 2 receptors induces compulsive- type 
behavior in response to highly palatable food ( Johnson-2010). High -fat diets are associated with 
reduced dopamine transporter (DAT) expression and dopamine efflux ( Speed-2011). In 
nonclinical studies of drug abuse, reduced availability of dopamine D 2 receptors in the striatum 
lead to increased and habitual drug intake, further supporting the importance of this t ransmitter 
system in addictive behaviors, and suggesting that BED and other impulse control disorders 
share overlapping  neural mechanisms ( Trifilieff-2014, Smith -2013). 
Clinical, genetic, and neuroimaging studies of eating behaviors in humans have shown parallel disturbances in the brain reward circuit and dopamine transmission in patients with BED, 
including reduced availability of dopamine D
2 receptors in the striatum (Murray -2014, 
Smith-2013). Down regulation of dopamine D 2 receptors in response to overeating leads to a 
hyper-responsive reward system that is sensitized to food, perpetuating patterns of recurrent food 
craving and overconsumption that result in BED in susceptible individuals. Further evidence for 
a hyper-responsive reward circuit i n BED patients comes from neuroimaging studies using 
positron emission tomography (PET). Administration of methylphenidate, an inhibitor of the 
dopamine reuptake transporter, results in greater increases in dopamine levels in the caudate 
nucleus in response to food in BED patients when compared to individuals without BED. These increases are significantly correlated with higher binge eating scores ( Wang-2011). Additional 
PET studies have shown negative correlations between impulsivity and availability of dopamine D
2/3 receptors in the striatum and midbrain of humans ( Lee-2009, Buckholtz-2010).  
Similar to findings from the PET studies, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies 
show a dysregulated and hyper-responsive reward circuit in response to food in BED patients. Exposure to high -calorie or highly palatable food stimuli elicits greater activation in reward 
areas, such as the nucleus accumbens and orbital frontal cortex in BED patients compared to 
controls, which directly correlates with the severity of binge- eating symptoms ( Schienle-2009, 
Filbey-2012). Together these studies show that a dysregulated dopaminergic driven reward 
circuit is critical to the symptomology associated with BED and suggest that therapies targeting 
this system may be effec tive interventions for the disorder. 
4.1.2. Pharmacological Management of Binge Eating Disorder 
Although cognitive, behavioral and interpersonal psychotherapies improve binge eating 
symptoms, many patients do not respond. Recent studies suggest that pharmacothera pies that

Confidential and Proprietary 29 13 Jun 2017 
 target one or more of the neurotransmitter systems implicated in BED may play a critical role in 
its management ( McElroy-2012). 
Several classes of pharmacological agents have been evaluated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled or open-label studies, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs), antiobesity agents, anticonvulsants, and stimulants ( Hudson-1998, McElroy -2000, 
Arnold-2002, McElroy -2003A, Stunkard-1996, Appolinario-2003, Grilo -2005, McElroy -2003B, 
McElroy-2006, McElroy -2007, Leombruni-2006, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
Lisdexamfetamine  dimesylate is a central nervous stimulant indicated for the treatment of attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD). In two 12–week, randomized, placebo-controlled 
registration studies, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate showed significant reductions in binge eating frequency ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and these efficacy results supported United S tates 
Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) approval of Vyvanse® as a treatment for adults wit h BED 
(Shire-2015). 
4.2. Study Conduct Rationale  
Dasotraline (also known as SEP-225289), a new chemical entity currently in clinical trials for 
ADHD, blocks pre-synaptic DAT and norepinephrine transporter (NET). Unlike 
psychostimulants such as amphetamine, whic h facilitate the direct release of dopamine and 
norepinephrine ( Hutson-2014, Minzenberg-2012), dasotraline is a dual dopamine and 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (DNRI). Dasotraline has a long time to maximum concentration (t
max; reaches maximum concentr ations approximately 10 to 12 hours after dosing) 
and mean apparent half -life (47.1 to 77.0 hours). 
A nonclinical study was conducted to compare the acute effects of dasotraline in a rat model of BED with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, and its pharmacologically active metabolite, d-amphetamine. Rats that were allowed irregular and limited access to chocolate developed 
robust and intermittent hyperphagia that mirrored BED without associated obesity. Binge eating of chocolate was markedly reduced by a single or al dose of dasotraline. The reduction in 
chocolate consumption was dose dependent and comparable to the effects observed with both 
lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and d-amphetamine in this rat BED model.  
A recently completed clinical study supports dasotraline as a potentially safe and efficacious 
treatment option for adults with ADHD ( Koblan-2015). Clinically meaningful and statistically 
significant treatment effects were observed at 8  mg/day. Consistent with DNRI pharmacology, 
the most frequent adverse events  reported in the study were insomnia, decreased appetite, and 
dry mouth. In addition, significant dose dependent decreases were observed in appetite and 
weight loss. A review of previously published trials for BED suggests that decreases in appetite 
and weight loss are strongly associated with a reduction in binge eating frequency (Appolinario-2003, Grilo-2005, McElroy- 2003B, McElroy -2006, McElroy-2007, 
McElroy-2012). Administration in over 1000 adult subjects in completed and ongoing studies 
supports the safety of dasotraline for continued evaluation. 
Use of dasotraline as a potential treatment for BED is supported by research that suggests 
pharmacotherapies that target one or more of the neurotransmitter systems (including dopamine 
and norepinephrine ) that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of BED may play a critical 
role in its management. The centrally acting effects of dasotraline on dopamine and 
Protocol Study No. SEP360-322, Version 4.00  Dasotraline  
 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 30 13 Jun 2017 
 norepinephrine uptake combined with the results from the SEP360-201study, and the rat model 
study of bi nge eating provide further support to evaluate dasotraline as a treatment for BED.  
The initial 12 -week study SEP360-221 evaluates  dasotraline flexibly dosed at 4, 6, or 8 mg /day 
and the 12-week study SEP360-321 evaluates dasotraline fixed doses of 4 or 6 m g/day as a 
potential treatment f or BED. The current study evaluates long term safety and efficacy of 
dasotraline as a treatment for BED  and will enroll subjects who complete treatment in Study 
SEP360-221 or Study SEP360-321. 
4.3. Risk-Benefit Assessment  
Overall, in previous clinical studies dasotraline was generally safe and well tolerated. The 
pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profiles observed in adults from completed clinical studies 
support evaluation of dose levels of 4 – 8 mg /day in adults with BED. 
Most adverse events in completed clinical studies were mild to moderate in intensity, and 
included headache, dizziness, insomnia, tachycardia, and nausea. Dose dependent increases in 
the incidence of insomnia and weight loss were observed, consistent with DNRI pharmacology. 
A total of 13 serious adverse events (SAEs) have been reported in 9  subjects receiving 
dasotraline. Across the 8 completed clinical studies evaluating dasotraline, the rate of 
discontinuations as a result of treatment- emergent adverse events (TE AEs) was low. The highest 
rate of discontinuations due to TEAEs was in the SEP360-201 adult ADHD study (11.2% and 
29.7% of subjects treated with dasotraline 4 and 8 mg/day, respectively), primarily due to 
insomnia. In general, the side -effect profile of dasotraline, based on available data, appears 
comparable with other medications used in the treatment of ADHD and suggests it may be well 
tolerated in patients with BED. A flexible dose design to reach the 8 mg  dose will be 
implemented in this study to facilitate management of safety and tolerability issues.  
The results from the human abuse liability study indicate dasotraline has minimal abuse potential 
and is unlikely to be recreationally abused. All doses of dasotraline (8, 16, 36 mg ) demonstrated 
significantly lower drug liking scores than methylphenidate (40, 80 mg ) and were no greater than 
placebo. The most frequently reported abuse potential adverse events were insomnia and dizziness in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia and suic idal ideation 
in adults with ADHD. The current study will be conducted in accordance with relevant 
regulatory guidance and law with regards to handling, distribution, storage, dispensation, 
accountability, and destruction of study drug. In addition a comprehensive Abuse Potential 
Monitoring Plan (APMP) for dasotraline designed to detect potential abuse of the compound and to more closely monitor adverse events ( AEs) consistent with the pharmacology of the 
compound will be implemented for this study ( Section 24, Appendix V ). 
Additionally, a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established for this study. The DSMB will review safety data including AEs and SAEs at regular intervals.  
Results from the adult A DHD study and the rat model of binge-eating combined with 
dasotraline’s DNRI pharmacology, and extended PK profile suggest dasotraline may prove safe and efficacious in the treatment of patients with BED. Although drugs targeting disturbances in 
dopaminerg ic transmission may translate to therapeutic benefit in BED, the efficacy and safety 
of dasotraline in this indication  is currently being evaluated .

 7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase  3, 12-month, multicenter, open- label, flexibly -dosed, safety study in adults with 
BED. This study is projected to enroll approximately  500 subjects based on the number of 
subjects expected to complete treatment in the core studies  (ie, SEP360-221 or SEP360-321). 
Informed consent will be obtained from all subjects after all procedures from the core study have 
been compl eted and before any study procedures unique to this study are performed. Safety and 
tolerability will be monitored throughout the study by AE reports, physical and neurological 
examination s, 12-lead ECG, vital signs, body weight, BMI, clinical laboratories (hematology, 
chemistry, urinalysis, hemoglobin A1c, and lipid panel), and C- SSRS. Effectiveness will be 
evaluated using the BE-CGI-S, EDE-Q modified, and SDS.  Subject-reported health status will be 
assessed using the SF-12 (subjects from Study SEP360-221 only). Assessment of potential 
withdrawal effects of dasotraline will be conducted via administration of the CSSA, DESS, 
HAM-A, and MADRS at the end of treatment and during the 3-week study medication 
withdrawal period. 
A comprehensive Abuse Potential Monitoring Plan (APMP ; see Section 24) for dasotraline 
designed to detect potential abuse of the compound and to more closely monitor AEs consistent 
with the known pharmacology for dasotraline will be implemented. 
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety data including 
data on adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) at regular intervals. 
Subjects will self -administer study drug on an outpatient basis for 12 months, once a day at 
approximately the same time each morning with or without food, including on the days when 
clinic visits occur. Subjects meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will start taking 
open-label study drug on Day 1, the morning following the open- label (OL) Baseline visit (ie, 
Week 12 visit in the core study). 
The total daily dose will remain between 4  mg/day and 8 mg /day for the 12 -month treatment 
period. Dasotraline will be dosed at 4  mg/day for the first 2  weeks of the study. At the Week  2 
visit, the dose may be increased to 6 mg/day. Thereafter the dose may be increased or decreased 
by 2 mg/day, as necessary for effectiveness or tolerability reasons at the discretion of the 
investigator . A minimum of 8 days is required between dose increases. Dose decreases may be 
made at less than 8 day intervals, at the investigator’s discretion, for reasons of safety or 
tolerability.  If, in the judgment of the investigator, the subject does not tolerate the minimum 
required dose (4 mg /day), he or she will be discontinued from the study. 
All changes in study drug dose will begin the morning after the visit at which the dose change 
decision is made and using the new package of study drug. 
The study will consist of a baseline visit, 12-month open- label treatment  period, and 3- week 
study drug withdrawal period as shown in the Study Schematic ( Figure 1). During the treatment 
period, subjects will return to the clinic at the end of 2 and 4 weeks  for clinical evaluation and 
thereafter will return to the clinic once every 4 weeks during the treatment period for scheduled 
visits. At the approximate midpoint between the scheduled monthly visits (ie, 14 ± 2 days after a 
Protocol Study No. SEP360-322, Version 4.00  Dasotraline  
 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 35 13 Jun 2017 
 visit), the site staff will contact the subject via telephone,  text, or email in order to monitor for 
SAEs, AEs, and concomitant medications, as well as to remind subjects about adherence to study 
drug administration, and upcoming visits. If necessary, an unscheduled visit can be arranged. 
Subjects will attend weekly  visits during the 3-week study drug withdrawal period. Assessment 
of potential withdrawal effects of dasotraline will be conducted via administration of the CSSA, 
DESS, HAM -A, and MADRS at the end of treatment. Subjects will undergo assessments every 
other day and weekly as follows: The CSSA and DESS will be completed every other day during 
the 3-week study medication withdrawal period. Clinical site staff will call the subject every 
other day, beginning the second day after the last dose of study drug, unless a clinic visit is scheduled for that day. Phone contacts may be made up to 3 times per day if the clinical site staff are unable to contact the subject on the first 2 attempts. If the subject cannot be contacted on a 
given day, during the next contact the study site staff will retrospectively collect the missed 
CSSA and DESS, in addition to the current day’s CSSA and DESS , as necessary . Clinical site 
staff will record the responses in the subject’s source information and in the case report form 
(CRF) with the contact date and time. The CSSA, DESS, HAM -A, and MADRS also will be 
administered at each weekly visit  during the withdrawal period. 
A window of ± 1 day will be allowed for each weekly clinic visit and telephone call during the study medication withdrawal period.  
After the last withdrawal period visit, all subjects will be referred for follow -up care as 
determined by the investigator. 
A study schematic is presented in Figure 1. Details of the s tudy assessments and other 
procedures to be performed at each visit are presented in  Table 2, Schedule of Assessments, and 
Section 11, Study Assessme nts. 
If necessary, subjects may return to the clinic at any time for an unscheduled visit.

 7.3. Rationale  
7.3.1. Rationale for the Study Design 
This is an open- label study to evaluate the long -term safety and effectiveness of flexibly -dosed 
dasotraline consistent with the intended long-term use of the compound in this population. 
7.3.2. Rationale for the Dosages 
The dosages to be used in this study (4, 6, or 8 mg /day) are the same as those administered in the 
core study  SEP360-221. Doses of 4 and 6 mg are administered in the core study SEP360-321. 
7.3.3. Rationale for the Study Population 
Subjects in this study will have met BED e ligibility requirements in the core study and not have 
taken any medication other than study drug for the purpose of controlling BED symptoms during 
the core study.  
7.3.4. Rationale for the Endpoints 
The safety assessments and their timing are considered appropriate to assess the long -term safety 
of dasotraline, taking into account known pharmacology and adverse events based on previous studies. The symptom, functional, and quality of life assessments were selected to assess the 
potential effectiveness of dasotraline on these parameters.  
7.3.5. Prevention of Missing Data 
In an effort to minimize the number of subjects who are terminated from the study before s tudy 
completion, the following study design and conduct elements are implemented: (i) clinic visits every 2 weeks for the first month, every 4 weeks for the remainder of treatment, and every week 
during the study drug withdrawal period, (ii) during the treatment period a window of ± 3 days for each bi- weekly or monthly clinic visit and a window of ± 1 day for each weekly clinic visit 
starting at Week 52, (iii) training the sites on the importance of continued follow-up and on the 
informed consent process, ensuring subjects understand the commitment they are making, including the intent to complete the trial, and (iv)  monitoring of data collection for adherence 
during the s tudy.

10.1.2. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
The total daily dose will remain between 4  mg/day and 8 mg /day for the 12 -month treatment 
period. Dasotraline  will be dosed at 4 mg /day for the first 2  weeks of the study. At the Week  2 
visit, the dose may be increased to  6 mg/day. Thereafter the dose may be increased or decreased 
by 2 mg/day, as necessary for effectiveness or tolerability  reasons at the discretion of the 
investigator . A minimum of 8 days is required between dose increases. Dose decreases may be 
made at less than 8 day intervals, at the investigator’s discretion, for reasons of safety or 
tolerability.  If, in the judgment of the inves tigator, the subject does not tolerate the minimum 
required dose (4 mg /day), he or she will be discontinued from the study. 
All changes in study drug dose will begin the morning after the visit at which the dose change 
decision is made and using the new pa ckage of study drug. 
10.2. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with study drug will be monitored closely and determined at each visit during 
treatment. Subjects will be instructed to bring all unused study drug with them to each visit. 
Compliance will be assessed by  counting capsules and dividing the actual number of doses taken 
(per capsule count) by the number of doses the subject should have taken within a visit period 
and multiplying by  100. Subjects who miss more than 25% of scheduled doses or take more than 
125% of the scheduled doses will be considered noncompliant. Evidence of noncompliance must 
be immediately reported to the Medical Monitor. Potential noncompliance will be discussed with 
subject, and at the investigator’s discretion may result in termination of the subject from the 
study. All subjects will be reminded of the importance of strict compliance with taking study 
drug for the effectiveness of treatment and for the successful outcome of the study.

 described in Section  22, Appendix  III, from informed consent through the end of the study. Note: 
Continued use of an effective and medically acceptable form of birth control is recommended for 
30 days after study completion or premature discontinuation from the study. 
10.4. Guidance for Overdose  
There is no overdose experience with dasotraline in humans. Signs and symptoms of overdose in 
nonclinical studies were consistent with exaggerated pharmacology and included hyperactivity, 
stereotypy, aggressiveness, and reduced food intake and body weight loss. 
Activated charcoal may be of value if administered very soon after a dasotraline overdose (ie, 
during the absorption process). 
10.5. Cautions 
Dasotraline capsules should not be opened or tampered with in any way; the active ingredient is 
an ocular irritant.

 11.2. Safety Assessments  
11.2.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be collected for each subject. Subjects should be queried in a non- leading 
manner, without specific prompting (eg, “Has there been any change in your health status since 
your last visit?”). See Section 12, Safety Reporting. 
AEs will be monitored throughout the study at all visits  including telephone , text, or email 
assessments.  
Information on AEs carried over from the core- study will be described in the DMP.  
11.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
The clinical laboratory tests required by protocol are listed in Section 21, Appendix II . 
Blood and urine samples will be collected for clinical laboratory tests. All clinical laboratory tests will be performed  centrally. For detailed instructions regarding clinical laboratory 
procedures, sampling, and shipping guidelines refer to the Central Laboratory Instructions 
Manual. Samples will be processed at a central laboratory to ensure consistency. All clinical 
laboratories will be College of American Pathologists (CAP) and Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments (CLIA) (or equivalent) certified.  
Any POC  (point of care) kits that are performed on site by study personnel rather than in a lab- 
must be CLIA waived and the study center  must possess a CLIA certificate of Waiver.  
11.2.3. Vital Signs  
Following 5 minutes of rest, respiration rate, oral temperature, and supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures and pulse rate will be measured. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures and pulse 
rate will be taken again with the subject standing after the subject has been standing for 2 to 
4 minutes. The same arm should be used during each assessment of blood pressure and pulse rate throughout the study. If a subject develops symptoms consistent with orthostatic hypotension 
(light-headedness, dizziness, or changes in sensorium upon standing) at any point, his or her 
supine and standing blood pressure and pulse rate should be collected at that time in the manner described above. Vita l signs will be obtained prior to clinical laboratory  sample collection and 
performance of an ECG, whenever possible. 
11.2.4. Electrocardiograms (E CGs) 
All ECGs will be obtained in the supine position, after the subject has been resting supine for at 
least 10 minutes. ECGs will be 12 -lead with a 10 -second rhythm strip. ECGs should be obtained 
before drawing blood samples. All attempts should be made to use the same ECG recorder for all visits within individual subjects. ECGs will be centrally read by a centralized cardiac safety 
vendor according to established quality additional information assurance procedures for 
inter/intra reader variability. Refer to Section 20 (Appendix I) for additional information. 
Standard 12- lead ECG will record heart rate (HR), PR interval, RR interval, QT interval, QTc 
interval, and QRS duration.

 11.2.5. Physical and Neurological Examinations 
Clinically significant physical and neurological examination findings, as judged by the 
investigator, after baseline (carried over) will be recorded as AEs.  
The physical examination will consist of an assessment of body systems including but not 
limited to head, ears, eyes, nose and throat (HEENT), cardiovascular (heart and vascular system), respiratory (lungs and chest), gastrointestinal (abdomen), and skin. 
Neurological examinations will include a brief assessment of mental status, cranial nerves, motor 
strength and coordination, sensory function in addition to deep tendon reflexes. 
11.2.6. Safety Scales  
11.2.6.1. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) 
The C-SSRS (Posner-2007) is a tool designed to systematically assess and track suicidal AEs 
(suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation) throughout the study. The strength of this suicide 
classification system is in its ability to comprehensively identify suicidal events while limiting the over-identification of suicidal behavior. The scale takes approximately 5 minutes to 
administer. The C- SSRS will be administered by a trained rater at the site.  
This study will utilize the “Since Last Visit” version of the C-SSRS. 
Subjects who answer “yes” to “suicidal ideation” item  4 (active suicidal ideation with some 
intent to act, without specific plan) or item 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and 
intent) on the C-SSRS assessme nt at any time during the study must be referred to the 
Investigator for follow-up evaluation. 
11.2.6.2. Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment  (CSSA) 
The CSSA ( Kampman -1998) is a clinician -administered scale designed to evaluate withdrawal 
signs and symptoms related to stimulants over the past 24 hours. It takes approximately 
10 minutes to administer the 18 -item scale.  
Included in the CSSA are those symptoms most often associated with early cocaine abstinence, 
including change in appetite, depression, fatigue, anhedonia, anxiety, irritability, sleep disturbance, and inability to concentrate, paranoia, carbohydrate craving, bradycardia, and 
suicidality. The CSSA is scored as follows: cocaine craving scores are obtained by having 
subjects record the highest intensity and frequency of cocaine craving experienced during the preceding 24  hours using visual analog scales. All items except item 14, are scored 0  to 7 
according to instructions on the CSSA generally with 0 = no symptoms and 7 = maximum score on any individual it em. Item 14 is scored 0 to  8 with 0 = no symptoms and 8 = maximum score.  
Heart rate is determined by radial pulse measurement.  
On non-clinic days, the CSSA will be completed by site staff during a call to the subject.  
In order to complete the visual analog scale (VAS) portion of the CSSA on days when there are no scheduled clinic visits, subjects will be provided with copies of the VAS in advance, and will 
record their response at the time of scale administration.  
Protocol Study No. SEP360-322, Version 4.00  Dasotraline  
 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 48 13 Jun 2017 
 In order to complete the radial pulse portion of the CSSA on days when there are no scheduled 
clinic visits , subjects will measure their own radial pulse and provide the measurement to the site 
staff over the phone. 
For consistency of radial pulse measurements, subjects also will take their own ra dial pulse for 
the CSSA completed during in- clinic visits.  
Subjects will be instructed by the site staff regarding the appropriate way to take their pulse. 
11.2.6.3. Discontinuation- Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) Scale  
The DESS Scale ( Rosenbaum-1998) is a clinic ian-rated instrument of 43 items used to evaluate 
signs and symptoms associated with discontinuation or interruption of monoamine reuptake 
inhibitor treatment.  
On non-clinic days, the DESS Scale will be completed by site staff during a call to the subject.  
11.2.6.4. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM- A) 
The HAM -A is a widely used and well -validated tool for measuring the severity of a patient’s 
anxiety. It should be administered by an experienced clinician. The HAM-A consists of 14 items, 
each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and 
psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). Each item is 
scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 = not present to 4 = severe.  
The Structured Interview Guide for the HAM- A (SIGH-A) will be used for the administration of 
the HAM -A. 
11.2.6.5. Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  
The Montgomery- Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a widely used clinician -rated 
assessment of the subject’s level o f depression. The measure contains 10 items that measure 
apparent and reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep and appetite, difficulty concentrating, lassitude, inability to feel, and pessimistic and suicidal thoughts. Each item is scored in a range 
of 0 to 6 points, with higher scores indicating increased depressive symptoms. 
The Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS (SIGMA) will be used for the administration of 
the MADRS.  
11.3. Effectiveness  Assessments  
11.3.1. Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE- Q) Modified  
The Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE- Q) is a self -report version of the eating 
disorder examination (EDE) ( Fairburn-1994). Like the EDE, the EDE- Q measures eating -
disorder psychopathology in the past 28 days, and over longer inter vals for diagnostic items. The 
EDE-Q yields scores on the same subscales (dietary restraint, eating concern, weight concern, 
and shape concern), global score, and binge- eating frequency variables as the EDE interview. 
Research with clinical samples of patients with BED has reported acceptable agreement between 
the EDE-Q and EDE interview ( Grilo-2001A; Grilo-2001B ). 
Protocol Study No. SEP360-322, Version 4.00  Dasotraline  
 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 49 13 Jun 2017 
 Convergent findings from confirmatory factor analyses of item data obtained from patients with 
BED (Grilo-2010) and patients with overweight/obe sity (Grilo-2012; Grilo-2013; 
Hrabosky-2008) as well as non-clinical groups ( Grilo-2015) support an alternative, brief version 
of the EDE- Q and EDE comprising 7 items to generate a global score and 3 subscales (dietary 
restraint, shape/weight overvaluation, and body dissatisfaction) referred to as the EDE -Q7 
(Grilo-2015). In the present study, the EDE -Q7 along with 3 items to assess binge eating, 
including the number of binge eating days will be used and referred to as the EDE -Q modified .  
11.3.2. Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)  
The SDS was developed to assess functional impairment in 3 domains: work/school, social, and 
family life. The subject rates the extent to which work/school, social life, and home life have 
been impaired by his/her symptoms on an 11-point visual analog scale. The 3  items can be 
summed into a single global measure of impairment that ranges from 0  (unimpaired) to 
30 (highly impaired). This anchored visual analog scale uses spatiovisual, numeric, and verbal descriptive anchors simultaneously to as sess disability across 3  domains: work; social life, and 
family life. There are verbal descriptors for the points on the scale as well as numerical scores 
that provide more precise levels of the verbal descriptors. The SDS takes approximately 
10 minutes to  complete.  
11.3.3. Binge-eating Clinical Global Impressions –Severity of Illness ( BE-CGI-S) 
The BE-CGI-S (Busner & McElroy, 2012; based on Guy -1976) asks the clinician one question: 
“Considering your total clinical experience with the adult Binge Eating Disorder (B ED) 
population, how mentally ill is the subject at this time?”  The clinician’s answer is rated on the 
following 7- point scale: 1  = normal, not at all ill; 2  = borderline mentally ill; 3  = mildly ill; 
4 = moderately ill; 5  = markedly ill; 6  = severely ill; 7 = among the most extremely ill subjects.  
This rating is based upon observed and reported BED symptoms, behavior, and function in the past 7 days. Clearly, symptoms and behavior can fluctuate over a week; the score should reflect 
the average severity level across the 7  days. 
11.4. Other Assessments  and Scales  
11.4.1. Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12) 
The SF-12 is a 12 -item self-report questionnaire that is a subset of the SF-36 Health Survey. The 
survey captures physical and mental health. There are 8  subscales including: Physical 
functioning, Role-physical, Bodily pain, General health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-emotional, Mental health. The responses are reported on a 3 or 5 point Likert scale, depending on the question. The SF -12 is collected only for subjec ts enrolling in this study after 
completing Study SEP360-221. 
11.5. Study Visits and Assessments 
11.5.1. Open-label Baseline: Visit  1E (Day -1)

 12. SAFETY R EPORTING  
12.1. Definitions 
12.1.1. Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a medicinal 
(investigational) product and which does not necessarily have a causal relatio nship with this 
treatment.  
An AE can , therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease occurring after the administration of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product. AEs may 
include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. A Es will be 
collected from the time the informed consent is obtained to the last study visit. 
Lack of effectiveness  may be an expected potential outcome and should not be reported as an AE 
unless the event is unusual in some way. 
New signs and symptoms of underlying disease, or signs and symptoms of emerging disease 
must be recorded as AEs.  
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
12.1.2. Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) i s an AE that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening (ie, a patient is at immediate risk of death at the time of the event, 
not an event where occurrence in a more severe form might have caused death)  
• Requires hos pitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly  or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require an 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospit alization 
The term "severe" is often used to describe the severity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction)  (see Section 12.3); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
Protocol Study No. SEP360-322, Version 4.00  Dasotraline  
 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 55 13 Jun 2017 
 "serious," which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning as defined by the criteria above.  
During the study, if a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (eg, elective surgery) that was scheduled before the study entry, ie, before informed consent for an event/condition that occurred before the study, the hospitalization is considered a therapeutic intervention and not the 
result of a SAE. However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it should be reported as an AE (or SAE, if the event/condition results in a serious outcome such as prolongation of hospitalization).  
Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred. This definition does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death.  
12.2. Objective Findi ngs 
Clinically significant abnormal objective findings (eg, clinical laboratory value, ECG value, and physical examination observation) will also be recorded as  AEs. 
When a clear diagnosis is available that explains the objective findings, this diagnosis w ill be 
recorded as the AE, and not the abnormal objective finding (eg, viral hepatitis will be recorded as the AE, not transaminase elevation). If a definite diagnosis is not available, then record the sign (eg, clinically significant elevation of transaminase levels) or symptom (eg, abdominal pain) as 
the AE. 
Clinical laboratory test results will be reviewed by the Investigator. The Investigator must 
determine the clinical significance of all out of range values. Clinical laboratory test with possibly drug- related or clinically relevant abnormal values of uncertain causality may be 
repeated. Any abnormal values that persist should be followed at the discretion of the 
Investigator. Laboratory reports will be initialed and dated on all pages by the Investigat or. 
Clinical Laboratory Tests Outside the Normal Range: Any value outside the normal range will be flagged for the attention of the Investigator or appropriate designee at the site. The Investigator or appropriate designee will indicate whether or not the value is of clinical significance. If the 
result of any test (or repeat test, if done) from the samples taken at OL Baseline is indicated as 
clinically significant and is not covered by the inclusion criteria in Section  8.1, the subject will 
not be allowed into the study. Additional testing during the study may be done if medically 
indicated. If a clinically significant abnormality is found in the samples taken after dosing, during the study, and/or at the Follow-up Visit, this should be recorded as an AE and the subject will be followed until the test(s) has (have) normalized or stabilized.  
All on site ECG tracings and ECG over- read reports will be reviewed by the Investigator. The 
Investigator must determine the clinical significance of all abnormal ECG s. ECG with possibly 
drug-related or clinically relevant abnormal findings of uncertain causality  may be repeated . Any 
abnormal ECG that persists should be followed at the discretion of the Investigator. ECG tracings will be initialed and dated on all pages by the Investigator.

Confidential and Proprietary 56 13 Jun 2017 
 12.3. Collection and Recording of Adverse Events  
All AEs must be c ollected and recorded in the subject’s study records/source documents, in 
accordance with the Investigator’s normal clinical practice, and on the CRF. All AEs will be 
followed up until resolution, stabilization of the condition, the event is otherwise explained, or 
the subject is lost to follow -up. 
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity , frequency, seriousness,  action taken with the 
study treatment, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy treatment. Definitions for severity , 
frequency, action taken with the study treatment, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy 
treatment  are presented below.  
The severity  of AE: 
• Mild - Ordinarily transient symptoms that do not influence performance of subject’s 
daily activities. Other treatment is not ordinarily indicated. 
• Moderate - Marked symptoms sufficient to make the subject uncomfortable. 
Moderate influence on performance of  subject’s daily activities. Other treatment may 
be necessary.  
• Severe - Symptoms cause considerable discomfort. Substantial influence on subject’s 
daily activities. May be unable to continue the s tudy, and other treatment may be 
necessary.  
The frequency  of AE: 
• Once – an isolated episode 
• Intermittent  – occurs on 2  or more separate occasions  
• Continuous  – does not abate from date of onset to date of resolution 
The action taken  with the study treatment: 
• Drug Interrupted  – Study medication stopped temporarily 
• Drug Withdrawn  – Study medication stopped permanently 
• Dose Reduced  
• Dose Increased  
• Dose not Changed  
• Not Applicable  
The outcome of the AE: 
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovering/Resolving 
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved 
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  
• Fatal 
Protocol Study No. SEP360-322, Version 4.00  Dasotraline  
 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 57 13 Jun 2017 
 • Unknown  
The causal relationship of the AE to the s tudy treatment: 
• Not related   
o  Not related  - Improbable temporal relationship and is plausibly related to 
other drugs or underlying disease.  
o Unlikely - occurred within a reasonable time frame after 
administration/discontin uation of the study medication , but there is a likely 
association of an intercurrent/underlying medical condition or other drugs. 
• Related. 
o Possible - occurred in a reasonable time after study-medication 
administration , but could be related to concurrent drugs or underlying disease. 
o Probable  - occurred in a reasonable time after study-medication 
administration , is unlikely to be attributable to concurrent drugs or underlying 
disease, and there is a plausible mechanism to implicate the study medication . 
o Definite - occurred in a reasonable time after study-medication administration  
and cannot be explained by concurrent drugs or underlying disease. The AE 
should respond to dechallenge/rechallenge, however, this is not mandatory 
before assigning a definite causal ity. 
The Medical Monitor is the initial contact person for protocol-related questions or discussion of 
AEs. The contact information for the Medical Monitor as well as other emergency contact 
information can be found in Table 1 of this protocol. 
12.4. Immediately Reportable Events  
The following medical events must be immediately reported to  the Sponsor: 
• SAE 
• Pregnancy  
Emergency contact information can be found in Table 1. 
12.4.1. Serious Adve rse Event  
If the Investigator or study center staff becomes aware of a SAE that occurs in a study subject 
from the time that informed consent is signed through 30 days following the last dose of the 
study medication, this must be reported within 24 hours to PPD -PVG, the medical monitor, and 
Sunovion responsible physician whether considered related or unrelated to the study medication. SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent through 14 days following last dose of the study medication also must be recorded on the CRF and the data recorded should match that on 
the SAE form.  
Following the end of subject participation in the s tudy, the Investigator or an authorized delegate 
should report SAEs “spontaneously” to PPD- PVG if considered at least possibly related to the 
study medication . 
Protocol Study No. SEP360-322, Version 4.00  Dasotraline  
 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 58 13 Jun 2017 
 Serious AEs will be followed until resolution, loss to follow-up, stabilization of condition, or the 
event is otherwise explained.  
In addition to the initial notification, an initial SAE form as applicable must be completed an d 
signed and sent via fax or email (see Table 1) to PPD-PVG within 1 business day of the 
Investigator or s tudy site staff becoming aware of the event. The SAE report form must be 
signed by the Investigator or approp riate designee. The Sponsor provides the SAE form used to 
report SAEs.  
The Sponsor or designee will promptly notify all study sites and Investigators of a SAE that is 
determined to be expedited to the Regulatory Authorities in accordance with  applicable law(s) 
and regulation(s ). These SAEs must be promptly reported to the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) by the Investigator  or the appropriate person at the site. 
12.4.2. Pregnancy  
Pregnancies  that occur from the time th at informed consent is signed through 30 days f ollowing 
the last dose of the s tudy medication will be collected and reported on the Pregnancy Event Form. 
If a subject becomes pregnant during the course of the study, she will be instructed to 
immediately stop taking the study medication. Further, t he subject will be instructed to return 
promptly/within 48 hours of the first notification of pregnancy to the research site and undergo a 
serum pregnancy test, as confirmation of pregnancy. If positive, the subject will no longer 
receive any additional study medication. All pregnancies, whether or not the subject received any 
additional study medication, will be followed until resolution (ie, termination [voluntary or 
spontaneous] or birth). 
If a pregnancy is reported for the study subject’s partner, the study subject must agree to 
complete abstinence for the duration of the study  or until resolution of the pregnancy, whichever 
comes first, or discontinue study drug and withdraw from the study. If the subject chooses to 
withdraw from the study, continued abstine nce is recommended for 30  days after the last dose of 
study medication.  
If a pregnancy is reported for the study subject’s partner, the Sponsor’s representative will provide instructions on how to collect pregnancy information in accordance with local 
requirements. Proper consent to collect the partner’s information will be obtained before the 
collection of any information. 
To report a pregnancy, the Pregnancy Event Form must be completed and sent via fax to 
PPD-PVG within 1 business day of the Investigator or study site staff becoming aware of the 
pregnancy. The Sponsor provides the Pregnancy Event Form. 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the study medication  
may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication  or other AEs were 
detected.

The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor safety throughout the study. The 
DSMB will be independent of the Sponsor, CRO, and the Investigators and will be empowered 
to recommend stopping the study due to safety concerns but not for effectiveness or futility. The 
membership of the DSMB and its mandate will be described in a separate DSMB charter.

 13. TERMINATION OF SUBJECT FROM 
STUDY/DISCONTINUATIO N OF STUDY DRUG  
13.1. Criteria for Study Drug Discontinuation  
Subjects may be discontinued from the s tudy drug at any time during the treatment period. The 
possible reasons for discontinuation of study drug are as follows: 
• Adverse event  
• Lack of efficacy (specify ) 
• Lost to follow- up (specify)  
• Non-compliance with study drug (specify) 
• Protocol viol ation (specify)  
• Pregnancy  
• Withdrawal by subject (specify)  
• Other (specify)  
If at any time during the course of the treatment period , in the opinion of the Investigator, the 
subject may no longer safely participate due to a change in medical status (eg, experiences an 
AE, becomes pregnant), the subject must be discontinued from the s tudy drug. 
The reason and information for study drug discontinuation will be recorded on the appropriate 
CRF. In case of death, the date of death should be captured on the CRF. 
13.2. Clinical Assessments After Study Drug Discontinuation  
Subjects who discontinue study medication before completion will be asked to return to the site 
and complete the EOT vis it assessments ( Section 11.5.2.4), as soon as possible following 
discontinuation of study drug, and complete the study medication withdrawal assessments and 
visits (Section 11.5.3). 
13.3. Criteria for Subject Termination  from the Withdrawal Period  
Subjects may terminate during the withdrawal period for any reason.  The possible reasons for 
termination during the withdrawal period are as follows : 
• Adverse event.  
• Lost to follow-up (specify).  
• Protocol violation  (specify) . 
• Pregnancy.  
• Withdrawal by subject (specify).  
• Other (specify).

 14. STUDY TERMINATION  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the s tudy at  this site or at multiple sites for safety  
or administrative reasons at any time  while ensuring that early termination does not compromise 
subjects’ safety or well -being. In particular, a site that does not recruit at an acceptable rate may 
be closed . Should the s tudy be terminated and/or the site closed for whatever  reason, all 
documentation and s tudy medication s pertaining to the study must be returned to the Sponsor or 
its representative.  
If, in the opinion of the Investigator, clinical observations suggest it may be unsafe to continue, 
the Investigator may terminate part or the entire study after consultation with the Sponsor. 
In the event of s tudy or site te rmination, subjects who discontinue study medication before 
completion will be asked to return to the site and complete the EOT visit assessments 
(Section 11.5.2.4) as soon as possible after discontinuation of study drug and complete the study 
medication withdrawal visits  and calls  (Section 11.5.3).

 15. STATISTICS  
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will provide details on the statistical methods planned for 
this study and w ill be finalized before data base lock.  
15.1. Sample Size  
Subjects who complete the double-blind treatment period of the core study, sign the consent, and 
meet all entry criteria will be included in this study. The double -blind core study SEP360-221 
plans to randomize approximately 300 subjects  and the double-blind core study SEP360-321 
plans to randomize approximately 480 subjects.  It is estimated that approximately 500 subjects 
will be eligible for enrollment in this study  based on the number of subjects expect ed to complete 
treatment in the core study . 
15.2. Analysis Populations  
Safety Population: The safety population will include all subjects who receive at least one dose 
of study medication. The safety population mainly is used for the data analyses of the safety data 
collected through Week  52 or during the open- label treatment period . 
Withdrawal P opulation: The withdrawal population includes all subjects who receive at least one 
dose of study medication, and either early terminate from the study drug during the OL treatment 
period or complete the 52-week OL treatment period, and have at least 1 assessment after the last 
study drug administration for any evaluation. The withdrawal population is used to summarize 
the safety  and effectiveness assessments collected in the withdrawal period. 
All effectiveness and safety evaluations will be summarized by analysis group based on the safety population and withdrawal population separately, when applicable. 
15.3. Data Analysis 
Unless otherwise specified,  safety data will be presented separately by analysis group for the 
open-label treatment period (for data collected up to the end of open-label treatment period) and withdrawal period (for data collected during the withdrawal period), as appropriate. Since this is an uncontrolled open- label extension, n o statistical comparisons will be conducted and  no 
inferential statistics on e ffectiveness and safety  will be presented.  
15.3.1. Analysis Group 
A total of 2 analysis groups will be formed based on a subject’s previous participation in the core 
studies (ie, subjects previously randomized to dasotraline and subjects previously randomized to 
placebo). Group “ All-Das” that combines these 2 analysis groups will be also presented. 
Summary tables, wherever applicable, will be presented by above analysi s group, respectively.  
 Pbo-Das: Subjects previously randomized to placebo in studies SEP360-221 or 
SEP360-321 
 Das-Das: Subjects previously randomized to dasotraline group in studies SEP360-221 or

Subjects continued from Study SEP360-221 will be further grouped into 2 analysis subgroups. In 
summary table they will be labeled as follows (ie, with one additional pooled group: 221- Das):  
 Pbo-Das: previously randomized to placebo  
 Das-Das: previously randomized to dasotr aline 4–8 mg/day 
 221-Das: subjects continued from study SEP360-221 
Subjects continued from Study SEP360-321 will be further grouped into 3 analysis subgroups. In 
summary table they will be labeled as follows (ie, with  2 additional pooled groups: All Das -Das 
and 321-Das):  
 Pbo-Das: previously randomized to placebo 
 Das4-Das: previously randomized to dasotraline 4  mg/day 
 Das6-Das: previously randomized to dasotraline 6 mg/day 
 All Das-Das: previously randomized to dasotraline (4 mg/day or 6  mg/day) 
 321-Das: subjects continued from study SEP360-321 
Results will be presented by analysis subgroup as needed for limited analyses, wherever 
applicable. 
15.3.2. Definitions of Assessments 
The following definitions will be used for assessments: 
• Double-blind ( DB) Baseline (ie, Bas eline assessment of the double-blind study [ core 
study]): the last assessment made on or before double-blind randomization as 
described in the core protocols; 
• OL Baseline (ie, Endpoint assessment of the double-blind treatment period of core 
study) or Baseline assessment of the open -label study (SEP360-322): the last 
assessment made during the double-blind treatment period, as described in the core protocols; 
• Week 52 Endpoint/Withdrawal Baseline: the last post- OL Baseline assessment made 
prior to or at Week 52 visit. 
• Withdrawal Endpoint: the last post- Withdrawal Baseline assessment made prior to or 
at Week 55 visit. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation [ SD], median, range, 95% confidence interval [CI] as needed). Where changes are 
reported, the reference will be to “DB Baseline”. Where relevant, changes from “OL Baseline” 
will also be reported.

 15.3.3. Safety Analysis 
The CSSA and DESS, which are used to assess physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms, 
are collected only at the Week  52 endpoint and in the withdrawal period; all other safety data are 
to be collected in both treatment period and withdrawal period and will be presented by analysis 
group for the open- label treatment period and withdrawal perio d, separately, as appropriate. 
15.3.3.1. Adverse Events  
All AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 
18.0 or higher.  
Treatment-emergent adverse event s (TEAEs ) are those reported adverse event s with onset data 
on or after the first day of the open- label treatment period  through 7 days after study drug 
discontinuation (14 days for serious adverse events and deaths). T he start of the open -label 
treatment period is defined as Day 1 for subjects previously randomized to placebo group and the 
OL Baseline visit date for subjects previously randomized to dasotraline groups. 
A discontinuation- emergent adverse event (DEAE) is defined as an AE which has an onset after 
the last dose date of study drug through the Week  55 visit (ie, the  last study visit in the 
withdrawal period). Table summaries  of AEs will be limited to TEAEs and DEAEs. All AE data will be displayed in 
data listings. For the sake of simplicity, hereafter TEAE is referred to as AE in this section.  
The overall incidence ( ie, number and percent of subjects with one or more AE in each category) 
of AEs, serious AEs, deaths, AEs leading to discontinuation, study drug- related AEs , study 
drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation, serious AEs leading to discontinuation, and ser ious 
study drug- related AEs, and serious study drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation will b e 
summarized by analysis group. 
The AEs also will be summarized by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) by 
presenting the number and percentage of subjects with each AE category. The incidence of AEs 
(by preferred term, grouped by SOC, and presented by analysis group) also will be summarized 
by severity, by the relationship to study medication, by the action taken regarding the study medication, as well as by the outcome.  
The incidence of AEs of special interest, including but not limited to neuropsychiatric- related 
and cardiovascular -related AEs, will be summarized by analysis group. For time to the earliest 
onset of insomnia, Kaplan- Meier curves wil l be plotted by analysis group. 
The overall incidence of DEAEs and serious DEAEs will be summarized by analysis group. The DEAEs also will be summarized by SOC and PT by presenting the number and percentage of subjects with each AE category.  
15.3.3.2. Columbia Suici de Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) 
The number and percentage of subjects with suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior, emergence or worsening of suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior will be summarized by analysis group for the open- label treatment peri od and the withdrawal period, separately.

 15.3.3.3. Other Safety Assessments  
Other safety assessments, including but not limited to lab oratory values , ECG, vital signs, 
weight, BMI , and neurological exam, will be summarized as below.  BMI at a study visit will be 
derived per weight assessed  at each open -label study  visit and the height collected a t Screening 
in the core studies.  
Treatment Period  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for observed values and changes from DB baseline and OL 
baseline by study visit and analysis group for continuous variables; for categorical variables. 
Frequencies and percentages by study visit and analysis group will be reported. In addition, for 
selected parameters of lab oratory values , ECG, vital signs, and weight, the number and 
percentage of subjects with markedly abnormal values will be presented.  
Withdrawal Period  
Descriptive statistics of continuous variables will be provided for observed values and changes 
from Week 52 Endpoint by study visit and analysis group; for categorical v ariables, frequencies 
and percentage by study visit and analysis group will be reported. 
15.3.3.4. Physical Dependence and Withdrawal Symptoms  
For continuous data used to assess physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms (ie, CSSA 
total score, DESS total score, MAD RS total score, and HAM- A total score), descriptive statistics 
of the observed values and changes from Week  52 Endpoint will be summarized by analysis 
group and visit for the withdrawal period. 
15.3.3.5. Concomitant Medications  
The number and percentage of subjects taking concomitant medic ation will be summarized by 
anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification and preferred name by analysis group.  
15.3.4. Analyses for Effectiveness and Subject-Reported Health Status  
For BE-CGI-S score, EDE -Q modified global score and  subscales scores  (restraint, shape concern, 
weight concern) , EDE-Q modified items 4 -6 scores, SDS total score and subscale scores, and 
SF-12 (subjects from Study SEP360-221 only) physical component and mental health 
component scores, d escriptive statistics (N, mean, SD, median, range) of observed values will be 
summariz ed by analysis group at DB baseline, OL baseline (when applicable) , each scheduled 
assessment in the treatment period, and Week  52 Endpoint. In addition, similar summary 
statistics as descri bed above and 95% CI of changes from DB baseline and OL baseline will be 
presented. Confidence intervals will be based on means and standard deviations estimated 
without adjustment for any center or baseline effects.  
For time to early discontinuation, Kapl an-Meier curves will be plotted by analysis group.

ASSURANCE  
16.1. Data Collection/ Electronic Data Capture (EDC)  
The results from data collected during the study (except clinical laboratory test results, 
electrocardiogram results, and IXRS data)  will be recorded in the subject’s  electronic CRF.  The 
study sites will use an electronic data capture ( EDC) system that is compliant with relevant FDA

 intervals not to exceed one year or as otherwise specified by the IRB. The Sponsor must be 
supplied with written documentation of continued review of the clinical research.  
The Investigator must promptly inform their IRB of all SAEs reported by subjects enrolled in the 
study or other safety information reported from Sponsor/CRO in accordance with applicable 
law(s) and regulation(s ). 
17.3. Informed Consent  
The informed consent form will be approved by the Sponsor/CRO before submission to the IRB. 
The Sponsor/CRO may provide a template informed consent form to be qualified by each 
research facility to conform to local requirements. All informed consent forms must co ntain the 
minimum elements as mandated by ICH GCP,  applicable local  law(s) and regulations  and will be 
subject to Sponsor /CRO approval as well as IRB approval. The Sponsor/CRO may submit 
informed consent forms to a central IRB for review and approval or favorable opinion contingent 
upon prior the Investigator permission and review. 
Before recruitment and enrollment, each prospective subject will be given a full explanation of 
the study, allowed to read the approved informed consent form and be provided ampl e time and 
the opportunity to ask any questions that may arise. Once all questions have been answered and the Investigator is assured that the prospective subject understands the implications of participating in the study, the prospective subject will be asked to give consent to participate in 
the study by signing the informed consent form. As part of the consent process, each prospective 
subject must consent to direct access to his/her medical records for study-related monitoring, 
auditing, IRB review, and  regulatory inspection. It should be clearly explained to each 
prospective subject that participation in each and every clinical visit and assessment is expected. The subject may be discontinued from study medication, but that does not necessarily negate t he 
expectation that the subject will continue to participate in the study through the final 
visit/assessment. The Investigator will provide a copy of the signed informed consent form to 
each subject , and will record the date of the informed consent on the CRF . 
If an amendment to the protocol changes the subject participation schedule in scope or activity,

 24. APPENDIX V. ABUSE PO TENTIAL MONITORING P LAN 
Overview of Abuse Potential Monitoring Plan 
Dasotraline is a new chemical entity being investigated for the treatment of Binge Eating 
Disorder (BED). Dasotraline is a diastereomer of the major metabolite of sertraline but is not a 
metabolite of sertraline, nor is it converted to the demethylated metabolite of sertraline in vivo. Dasotraline is a potent inhibitor of the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and 
dopamine (DA) via the respective transporters SERT, NET, and DAT, with preferential 
inhibition of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET) relative to the serotonin transporter (SERT) without significant off- target activities. Clinical studies 
demonstrated central SERT occupancies in healthy subjects well below those attained at DAT, in addition decreases in 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) were observed, indicating central NET inhibition. This pharmacological profile warra nts the implementation of an Abuse Potential 
Monitoring Plan, which surpasses the clinical monitoring, and adverse event (AE) reporting historically implemented in development programs for SSRIs.  
The Abuse Potential Monitoring Plan (APMP) for dasotraline has been designed to detect 
potential abuse of the compound and to more closely monitor AEs consistent with the 
pharmacology. The plan will detect irregularities in the handling of dasotraline in clinical trials and identify the misuse of dasotraline or oth er psychoactive substances. Moreover, the APMP 
provides a process by which events subject to additional monitoring are identified, processed, and reviewed. Events subject to additional monitoring were identified based on the pharmacology of dasotraline, as  well as adverse event profiles of compounds with similar 
mechanisms of action.  
Procedure for Managing Medication Irregularities  
Defining Threshold Criteria 
The purpose of this procedure is to capture information about all medication-handling irregularities that meet the predefined threshold criteria. All instances meeting the medication irregularity threshold criteria will require a clinical risk assessment by the investigator with 
classification of the nature of the irregularity. The investigator will be required to complete 
Attachment  A, the Medication Handling Irregularity (MHI) form in these situations. 
For clinical trials utilizing dasotraline, we define the threshold criteria for medication irregularities as any one of the following:  
• 10% or more of dispensed drug is either used in excess of prescribed dose or is unaccounted for; and/or  
• Suspected abuse or diversion of dasotraline; and/or  
• Suspected abuse of any other substance including alcohol, illicit substances, and over-the-counter (OTC) medications or prescription drugs.

 Instances of Medication Irregularity  
For all instances where the predefined threshold criteria are met covering medication 
irregularities, the investigator must complete the Medication Handling Irregularity (MHI) form 
(Attachment  A) and fax to the contact provided within 3 business days of its occurrence or 
discovery every time a threshold medication handling irregularity occurs. The contact will fax 
the completed MHI form to Sunovion within 1 business day of receipt and determine whe ther 
further action is warranted (ie, discontinuation of subject due to noncompliance with study 
protocol, education of the subject, etc). Attachment B  displays the process flow for handling 
medication irregularities. Any instance of medication irregularit y may further be classified as an 
event subject to additional monitoring (ESAM). 
The management of documented medication handling irregularities will be driven by the 
particular classification of the irregularity. As shown on Attachment A, items coded #1-3 
describe situations of accounting errors and/or noncompliance with study procedures without evidence of study medication misuse or abuse of other substances. In these instances (code #1-3 
on the MHI form), the investigator will complete Attachment A and f ax to the contact provided 
within 3 business days of knowledge of the irregularity. 
 
Suspected or Known Abuse or Diversion of Study Medication 
All cases of suspected or known abuse or diversion of study medication should be documented 
on the MHI form and c oded #4. The investigator will complete Attachment A and fax to the 
contact provided within 3 business days of knowledge of the irregularity. For all cases of medication irregularities coded as #4, the investigator will attempt to obtain a urine drug scree n 
from the subject, perform early termination procedures and discontinue the subject from the 
study. 
 
Suspected or Known Abuse of Alcohol or Other Substances 
The abuse of alcohol, illicit substances, OTC medication or prescription drugs while a subject is 
participating in a dasotraline clinical trial should be documented on the MHI form and coded #5. The investigator will complete Attachment A and fax to the contact provided  within 3 business 
days of knowledge of the irregularity. For all cases of medicatio n irregularities coded as #5, the 
investigator will attempt to obtain a urine drug screen from the subject, perform early termination procedures and discontinue the subject from the study. 
 
Event Subject to Additional Monitoring (ESAM) 
A key objective of the Abuse Potential Monitoring Plan is to monitor for instances of abuse or 
diversion of the study medication and other psychoactive substances. In addition to monitoring 
for irregularities in medication handling, AEs that may be suggestive of a developing abuse 
issue, will also receive special attention. The following adverse experiences or related signs and 
symptoms will require additional monitoring.  This list is a guide as to the types of events that 
require additional medical surveillance; it is not comprehensive and other events may be

 identified that require similar medical surveillance . Subjects experiencing an event subject to 
additional monitoring may need to be discontinued from the study.

Preparation of a Narrative for an Event Subject to Additional Monitoring (ESAM) 
Protocol Study No. SEP360-322, Version 4.00  Dasotraline  
 
 
Confidential and Proprietary 86 13 Jun 2017 
 To ensure clarity and completeness of information, all Events Subject to Additional Monitoring 
will require the preparation of a narrative by the investigator. This narrative will be reviewed by 
the sponsor/investigator to determine if the subject should be discontinued from the study. A 
narrative summary template  will be provided to the investigators ( Attachment  C). 
Handling of the Event Subject to Additional Monitoring (ESAM) 
• Investigators will report all Events Subject to Additional Monitoring with narratives to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours (Attachment C)  
• The medical monitor will review all ESAM in real time and forward a copy of the 
report to the sponsors’ Medical Director within one 1 business day 
 
Urine Drug Screens  
The protocol incorporates exclusion criteria targeting individuals with a history of substance use 
disorders (eg, alcohol abuse or dependence and illicit drug abuse or dependence). The protocol includes urine drug screens at baseline and at various post- baseline visits as well as providing the 
investigator with the discretion to obtain random urine drug screens. Investigators will be directed to obtain urine drug screens in instances where there is known or suspected abuse of study medication and/or other substances.

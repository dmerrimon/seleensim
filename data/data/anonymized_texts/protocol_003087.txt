1 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Study Synopsis  
Increasing the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic imaging in patients 
at high risk for breast cancer could provide substantial clinical benefit by improving diagnosis, preventing over -treatment, and reducing healthcare 
costs. Acoustic angiography  is a new type of contrast enhanced 
ultrasound imaging which is specifically sensitive to microvascular structu re and density.  It evaluat es tumor micro -vasculature and may 
provide a powerful prognostic tool for the diagnosis of breast cancer, and eventually for treatment evaluation.   
 Sixty patients who are to have a clinical surgical breast biopsy based on results from pre -study standard of care (SOC) imaging will be recruited 
from the UNC Breast Clinic for participation in the study. The primary 
objective of this single arm study is to compare the sensitivity and 
specificity of a coustic angiography  with traditional b- mode  ultrasound in 
the distinction of malignant versus benign breast lesions .  Secondary 
objectives include a comparison of area under the curve (AUC) for 
acoustic angiography versus b- mode ultrasound, comparison of radiologist 
preferen ce for the two imaging techniques  for each of 3 lesion 
characteristics, and quantification of vessel tortuosity based on acoustic angiography imaging results.  These metrics will be used  to develop a 
predictive model of malignancy  which will subsequently be compared to 
results from radiology review .   
1.2 Traditional Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis  
Breast cancer is the most common cancer type among women. Approximately 10% of women in the United States develop breast cancer during their lifetime and 30% to 40% of these patients will die from it.[33, 34] Mammography is an effective tool for the early detection of breast cancer  in the majority of women.[35] However , for women with dense 
breast tissue (considered an independent risk factor for breast cancer) and younger women, mammography performs poorly  due to lower 
sensitivity and specificity in these groups.[37] For young women with heritable mutations who wish to begin screening at a younger age, these limitations are especially problematic.[38] Additional ly, mammography is 
less sensitive in  women who have undergone breast augmentation. Given 
these limitations , most of these women may undergo additional imaging  
with breast ultrasound or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).  
 MRI is time consuming, extraordinari ly costly, and has limited availability, 
especially among rural and underserved populations . Another screening 
option, breast ultrasound (without contrast) , is widely used when additional 
imaging beyond mammogram is required due to its real -time imaging

2 capability (>30 images per second), portability, safety (does not involve 
radiation), and relatively low cost compared to breast MRI.  Unfortunately, 
while breast ultrasound is highly sensitive (96%), it is less specific (70%), 
resulting in a high false positive rate.  This results in unnecessary biopsies  
with associated complications , additional  follow- up and negative 
psychosocial impacts on patients , e.g., significant anxiety . A significant 
clinical need exists to improve breast ultrasound sensitivity and specificity .  
1.3 Angiogenesis  
Angiogenesis is the development of new microvasculature, and is well recognized to be involved in the growth of solid tumors as well as  tumor  
invasion and metastasis. Recent studies have reported an association between microvessel density and poorer recurrence- free, cancer -specific 
and overall survival.[39- 46]. Furthermore, both microvessel density and 
microvessel morphology have been reported to be associated with the clinical response to chemotherapy.[16, 47- 49] However, no curr ent clinical 
imaging modality can directly evaluate the microvasculature associated with suspected breast tumors.[50] Histological techniques based on core needle biopsy or surgical biopsy may evaluate only a small portion of a lesion, and require additional invasive procedures. Thus, direct non-invasive evaluation of the tumor micro- vasculature may provide a powerful 
prognostic tool for the diagnosis of breast cancer, and also provide a potential tool for treatment evaluation.  
1.3.1 Screening Based on Angiogenes is-Acoustic Angiography  
Acoustic angiography allows for the viewing of vessel shape and delineation of ‘tortuosity,’ which can indicate the presence and progression of cancer. This ability to image the microvasculature depends on the use of a multi (high) frequency ultrasound scanner in addition to a traditional 
single -frequency pulse -echo ultrasound scanner (b- mode ultrasound), the 
latter to ensure accurate anatomical location of the lesion.  Because of this dependence on pulse- echo, the technique is referred to as “acoustic” 
angiography  [62].   
 Acoustic angiography also depends on use of an ultrasound contrast 
agent. Contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging has been used for nearly two decades for clinical cardiology in the United States (and is currently routinely used in UNC Hospital Cardiology Clinics), and is much more 
widely used in Europe and Asia for visualization of blood perfusion in organs, tissues, and tumors.[51] Early concerns about the safety of ultrasound contrast  (specifically with the contrast  agent  (perflutren lipid; 
Definity®)  due to events in a clinical trial have been resolved; the 
overwhelming amount of more recent evidence from large clinical studies has shown that contrast ultrasound is very safe.[52- 54] In fact ,it is much 
safer than other commonly used techniques, such as coronary angiography, exercise ECG, or myocardial scintigraphy.[55] Furthermore,

3 it does not have the risks of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis associated with 
gadolinium based MRI contrast agents when used in renally compromised 
patients. On October 27, 2011, the FDA eliminated the requirement for patient monitoring 30 minutes after ultrasound contrast examination, based on th ese and other recent safety data.  The ultrasound contrast 
agent to be used in LCCC1405 is perflutren lipid.    
1.4 Perflutren Lipid  Background and Known Toxicities  
See http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/  for full 
prescribing information on perflutren when used according to its FDA -
approved indication.  Also see section 6.1.5. 
1.4.1 Background and Current Indications  
Definity ® (perflutren lipid) is an FDA -approved lipid- shell microbubble 
ultrasound (US) contrast agent that may be admini stered by an 
intravenous (IV) bolus or infusion. Currently, this contrast agent is approved for use in patients with suboptimal echocardiograms to opacify 
the left ventricular chamber and to improve delineation of the left ventricular endocardial border. It is not approved as a contrast agent for 
acoustic angiography in the breast . 
 When used according to its approved indication, the maximum dose of 
perflut ren is administered as either two bolus doses or one single 
intravenous infusion.  
For our study, perflutren lipid will be administered intravenously by a nurse 
or trained medical personnel  (see section  4.3). 
1.4.2 Associated Toxicities  
In pre- market clinical trials 1716 subjects were evaluated with activated 
perflutren lipid. Of the 1716 subjects, 144 subjects (8.4%) had at least one treatment -related adverse reaction. There were 26 serious adverse events 
and 15 (0.9%) subjects discontinued because of an adverse event. Nineteen subjects (1.1%) suffered serious cardiopulmonary adverse events including eight deaths. The deaths occurred several days after activated perflutren lipid administration and appear to be related to the course of underlying disease. Of the 11 other serious adverse events, 
which appeared within 2- 15 days of the drug administration, all appeared 
to be a progression of underlying cardiac and non- cardiac disease. 
However, a role for perflutren lipid in the initiation or course of these 
adverse events cannot be ruled out.  
 There were 15 discontinuations reported. Nine of these patients were discontinued after the first injection. One patient experienced a hypersensitivity reaction with urticaria and pruritus and all the ot her 
patients experienced dizziness, chest pain, dyspnea or back pain. 
LCCC 1405  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Lee  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
September 26, 2014  
4 Adverse events (AEs) appeared within 1 – 15 minutes of the drug 
administration and were of moderate intensity resolving usually without 
treatment within minutes or hours after onset.  
 For all AEs, there were no differences in the overall incidence based on 
age, gender, or route of administration. The most common events were (% of patients experiencing): headache (2.3%), back and renal pain (1.2%), flushing (1.1%) and nausea (1.0%).  
 
Cardiopulmonary Reactions  
In 2007, in response to post -marketing reports of 4 deaths and 190 
serious cardiopulmonary reactions, the FDA issued a black box warning 
for both Definity® and Optison® adding disease state contraindications and a mandatory 30
 minute monitoring period following administration in 
all patients. Following this there have been several large scale safety studies looking into the records of a total of more than 200,000 patients who received one of these contrast agents. In all those s tudies a 
composite rate of serious adverse events was calculated to be 1 – 3 in 
10,000,[22] compared to gadolinium -based MRI contrast which has an 
incidence of NSF of 2 – 5 in 100 patients with chronic kidney disease.[23]  
 
Following a meeting of the FDA C ardio- renal Advisory Committee in 2008, 
the black box warning was revised. The revisions shortened the 
contraindications to include cardiac shunts and hypersensitivity to perflutren, and mandated the 30 minute monitoring period be limited to patients with pulmonary hypertension or unstable cardiopulmonary conditions. The black box warning was further revised in 2011, removing the mandatory 30 minute monitoring period, but stating that most serious cardiopulmonary reactions occur within 30 minutes of adminis tration. For 
this reason, the label states that cardiopulmonary resuscitation personnel and equipment be readily available prior to perflutren administration, and that all patients be monitored for acute reactions.  
 Patients with a history of cardiac shunts, pulmonary hypertension or unstable cardiopulmonary conditions will be excluded from our study. In addition, all patients will be monitored for 30- minute post -perflutren 
administration by the research nurse or research physician.  
 
Hypersensitivity Reac tions  
The real risk of perflutren in our study is to the small number of potential 
patients with undiagnosed allergy to perflutren. Post -marketing reports 
have included anaphylactoid events and other serious but non- fatal 
adverse reactions, typically within 30 minutes of drug administration (see the package insert, and section 6.1.5  for additional information. In order to 
avoid a potentially fatal event, EpiPen® (epinephrine) injections will be kept near the US machine for all patients.

High Ultrasound Mechanical Index (MI)  
High ultrasound MI values may cause microsphere cavitation or rupture 
and lead to ventricular arrhythmias. In addition, end- systolic triggerin g with 
high mechanical indices has been reported to cause ventricular arrhythmias.  
 
Use in Patients with Known Breast Lesions  
US contrast agents including perflutren should carry no additional risks in 
patients with  a known breast lesions, as they are cleared by the lungs. 
The phospholipid component of perflutren lipid microspheres are thought to be metabolized to free fatty acids, while the octafluoropropane (OFP), as a stable gas, is not metabolized. In a small (n=8) pharmacokinetic study in healthy subjects, OFP was undetectable after 10 minutes in most 
subjects either in the blood or expired air, with a mean half -life of 1.3 
minutes (Definity® Prescribing Information) .  
1.5 Rationale  
One main limitation to the widespread use of contrast enhanced 
ultrasound clinically has been the lack of availability of state- of-the art 
contrast imaging approaches available to clinicians. However, contrast ultrasound will likely become far more widespread as new imaging 
techniques, such as acoustic a ngiogra phy, demonstrate their usefulness 
and become available on commercial ultrasound systems.  We propose to 
evaluate a novel ultrasound method that could potentially improve the sensitivity and specificity of traditional breast ultrasound.   Increasing the accu racy of diagnostic imaging in high risk patients could provide 
substantial clinical benefit by improving diagnosis, preventing over -
treatment, and reducing healthcare costs.  
 LCCC1405 is designed to compare the sensitivity and specificity of 
contrast enhanced ultrasound (acoustic angiography) to the sensitivity and 
specificity of conventional ultrasound in women scheduled to undergo a biopsy based on pre-study imaging  results.  The gold standard for 
sensitivity and specificity, then, will be based on pathological results. The 
Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) is used by radiologists who read mammograms, ultrasounds and MRIs to indicate their level of suspicion of the possibility of breast cancer. Scores range from 0 to 6, with scores of 4- 5 indicating suspicious results, while 6 
indicates an existing diagnosis of breast cancer.  This study is limited to 
women with a score of 4- 5 based on pre- study imaging .

4.0 STUDY  PLAN  
LCCC 1405  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Lee  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
September 26, 2014  
8 4.1 Schema  
This is a one arm single center study of 60 patients with suspicious breast 
lesions (BIRADS 4 or 5) from the UNC Breast Clinic that consent to 
undergo an acoustic angiography in conjunction with b- mode ultrasound 
prior to their scheduled biopsy .   
 
4.2 Enrollment/Recruitment  
A total of 60 women will be enrolled to this study. The 60 study subjects 
will be consecutively recruited from women who are scheduled to undergo core needle or surgical biopsy (BIRADS 4 or 5) to have pathological confirmation of malignancy status.  Eligible patients will be identified by research staff review in coordination with the UNC Breast Clinic.   
Once a patient has been referred, the patient will be approached by a coordinator from Radiology to assess interest in participation.  
 All eligible women  who agree to participate in the study will be asked to 
come to their scheduled biopsy appointment thirty minutes early to complete the informed consent process.   
 Review of the consent will take place in the privacy of an exam room, or when possible, a sample consent form will be sent to the patient via email prior to the patient’s visit to allow for ample review.  Once the patient has consented, women of child bearing potential (WCBP) will be given a urine pregnancy test in order to ensure that they are not pregnant.  If a urine pregnancy test shows a result positive for pregnancy, the patient will be excluded from the study per the exclusion criteria because the investigators cannot, in good conscience, expose a fetus to the contrast agent used.  Women who consent for the study and are eligible will be 
escorted by the research coordinator to a dressing room, where the subject will change into a gown.

9 4.3 Acoustic Angiography  
4.3.1 Perflutren Administration 
At the time of imaging, the contrast agent perflutren lipid  (see section 4.3) 
will be administered. See 
http://www.definityimaging.com/pdf/VIALMIX_Users_Guide.pdf, and the package insert, for instructions on perflutren lipid preparation and activation. Per flutren lipid is intended for intravenous (IV) administration 
only after activation in the Vialmix® apparatus.  Cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation personnel and equipment  will be readily available prior to 
perflutren administration, and all patients will be monitored for acute 
reactions.  
 
Perflutren will be administered in a single dose using a bolus 
administration.  (see http://www.definityimaging.com/how -
administration.html). Although the prescribing information allows for two 
10 uL/kg doses separated by 30 minutes, we will be administering double the package recommended dose (administering 20 uL/kg ) administered 
within 30- 60 seconds, followed by a 10mL saline flush. No second dose 
will be administered.   All patients will b e monitored for 30- minute post -
perflutren administration by the research nurse or research physician.  
Monitoring will include taking vitals  (O
2 sat, HR, RR, BP).  The oxygen 
saturation, heart rate, and respiration rate will be monitored continuously for 30 min.  The blood pressure will be monitored every 15 minutes.  This 
study will be conducted in Mammography of the UNC Cancer Hospital , so 
trained medical personnel will be available as needed.  
 The initial concentration will be diluted, although the final dilution amount 
is not finalized (most likely to range from  1:1 (full dos e) to - 1:5 dilution in 
saline).  This dilution technique is still to be determined based on 
performance because this is a new type of imaging . We w ill infuse via 
hand bolus injection.  The infusion time will be approximately  30 - 60 
seconds for the dose.  
4.3.2 Acoustic Angiography Imaging Procedures  
Acoustic angiography imaging involves a research high frequency ultrasound scanner (VisualSonics Vevo 770; see section 5.0) in contrast 
imaging mode .  In addition, we may use a standard FDA -approved clinical 
ultrasound system to obtain a second  conventional B -mode ultrasound 
image as a gold standard.   Imaging will be performed within th e package 
insert guidelines for ultrasound system mechanical index (a measurement of output power) when imaging perflutren contrast agent (less than 0.8).  
 Acoustic angiography imaging will be performed by a trained medical personnel using mild compression to eliminate motion.  A linear translation 
stage will be attached to the transducer to mechanically translate the 
LCCC 1405  CONFIDENTIAL

September 26, 2014  
10 transducer the imaging distance (up to approximately 3 cm).Total imaging 
time per pass  is estimated to be 60 seconds , similar to a standard 
ultrasonography exam    All image data will be de- identified and transferred 
for off -line analysis based on a study ID. The research images will NOT be 
interpreted or analyzed for clinical decisions related to the patient.   See 
section 5.0 for additional information on the acoustic angiography device.  
4.4 Standard of Care Biopsy  
The patient will then undergo her scheduled breast biopsy procedure based on the pre- study  diagnostic imaging. The research acoustic 
angiography  imaging will NOT  be interpreted prior to the breast biopsy 
and therefore will not influence any clinical decision concerning the biopsy.  
4.5 Medical Record Abstraction  
A secondary objective of this study is to q uantify the vessel tortuosity and 
develop a “ model -based malignancy score” to predict malignancy of a 
lesion based on quantitative tortuosity metrics  from the acoustic 
angiography imaging . In order to meet  this objective, we will review  each 
patient’s clinical records, including their pathology report  from biopsy .  The 
malignancy will be determined as indicated by the pathology report.   
4.6 Reader Study    
A total of five readers (radiologists trained in breast imaging) will be recruited to participate in evaluation of all imaging performed under 
LCCC1405.    
 
In the reader preference study, each reader will be asked to compare the 
acoustic angiography case to the conventional b- mode ultrasound case to 
evaluate the imaging characteristics based on the BIRADS ultrasound lexicon (http://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/PDF/QualitySafety/Resources/BIRADS/USLexiconClass.pdf). Specifically the relative ability to evaluate shape, margins and vascularity will be evaluated using a seven-point scale (-3 to +3) for the paired modality comparisons for each of the 
60 cases.  
 The data collection form for the reader study portion is given in Appendix 
A, section 13.1.  
 
The readers will be asked to assign a subjective malignancy score ( -2 
(highly not malignant) to +2  (highly malignant)) and their confidence for 
each lesion for each modality (0 to 100%).  These will also be documented 
on the form in Appendix A.  These scores will be used combined for a 
binary analysis.  Malignancy scores of +1 and +2 will be considered 
malignant.  Scores of -2, -1, and 0 will be considered not malignant.  
The confidence of malignancy will be used independently  in the analysis .

11 5.0 Research Ultrasound Scanner: FUJIFILM VisualSonics Vevo 770  
The device used for this study will be a research ultrasound scanner 
(FUJIFILM VisualSonics Vevo 770) and unique probes developed in conjunction with the research lab run by the founder of VisualSonics, Dr. Stuart Foster.  The ultrasound probes are modifications of Vevo 770 probes  (RMV716 probes ), modified to house 2 single- element transducers 
instead of 1.   
 The Vevo 770 is a research ultrasound system designed for pre- clinical, 
high resolution imaging of small animals.  It is marketed commercially by 
VisualSonics, Inc., a division of SonoSite, Inc., under the parent company FUJIFILM.  This ultrasound system and similar models have been designated to pose no significant risk in other c linical trials  by the 
respective IRBs or other similar regulatory agencies responsible for compliance oversight of these studies . (See section 13.1, Appendix  B). 
  
 
Figure 1. Device Image  3 Dual -Frequency Transducers:  
The probes we plan to use in this study are modified VisualSonics 
RMV716 probes.  They have been modified to house a high frequency inner element and a low frequency annular ring element, instead of a single transducer element.  We plan to run the transducers in dual -
frequency contrast mode  during the study .  In dual -frequency contrast 
mode, the low frequency (outer) element transmits ultrasound and the

5.1 Expected Risks  
5.1.1 VisualSonics Vevo 770  
This research protocol presents minimal risk to participants, investigators 
and study personnel.  The ultrasound imaging equipment , though 
specifically designed for preclinical use and not FDA approved, is calibrated and will be used according to FDA limits on diagnostic imaging 
ultrasound exposure to patients (Mechanical Index of less than 1.9 and spatial -peak temporal average intensity of less than 720 mW/cm
2).  For 

LCCC 1405  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Lee  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
September 26, 2014  
13 the imaging studies proposed here, the maximum mechanical index and 
intensity will not exceed 0.8 and 300 mW/cm2, respectively, less than half 
of the FDA limits, and within the range of  standard output parameters 
regularly used in diagnostic ultrasound imaging .  Furthermore, t his is  
within the mechanical index range listed on the prescribing information for 
use of perflutren contrast agent . The 1.5 cycle pulse length and 2- 4 MHz 
center frequency  of the ultrasound that is produced by our transducer s are 
within the range of common parameters regularly used by other FDA approved diagnostic ultrasound imaging systems.  The unique aspect of 
this imaging system is that we receive data at a hig her frequency (15- 45 
MHz) than typical diagnostic ultrasound imaging systems used for transcutaneous imaging .   The transmitted ultrasound parameters are 
within standard diagnostic imaging ranges  for frequency and acoustic 
output .

PI: Lee  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
September 26, 2014  
14 6.1.1 Supplier/How  Supplied 
Perflutren (Definity®) will be provided to study subjects at no cost. 
Perflutren is supplied as a single use 2mL clear glass vial containing clear liquid. Each package contains 4 single- use vials.  
6.1.2 Handling and Dispensing of Perflutren  
Perflutren lipid must be dispensed only from official study sites by authorized personnel according to local regulations. Perflutren should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that study drug is only dispensed to study patients.  
6.1.3 Storage Requirements/Stability  
The drug product should be stored in a secure location with limited access under controlled temperature conditions of 2- 8° C (36° -46° F) in a 
refrigerator.  
6.1.4 Preparation  
See http://www.definityimaging.com/pdf/VIALMIX_Users_Guide.pdf, and 
the package insert for instructions on the use of Vialmix®.  
6.1.5 Clinical Safety Summary  
See prescribing information on perflutren when used according to its FDA indication (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/), and see section 1.3 for a summary of toxicities reported in clinical trials. In addition, the following warnings and precautions are noted in the October 2011 labeling:  
 
Serious Cardiopulmonary Reactions:  
Serious cardiopulmonary reactions including fatalities have occurred 
uncommonly during or shortly following perflutren- containing microsphere 
administration, typically within 30 minutes of administration. The risk for these reactions may be increased among patients with unstable cardiopulmonary conditions (acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary artery syndromes, worsening or unstable congestive heart failure, or serious ventricular arrhythmias). Always have cardiopulmonary resuscitation personnel and equipment readily available prior to perflutren  
administration  and monitor all patients for acute reactions.  
The reported reactions include: fatal cardiac or respiratory arrest, shock, syncope, symptomatic arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), hypertension, hypotension, dyspnea, hypoxia, chest pain, respiratory distress, stridor, wheezing, loss of consciousness, and convulsions.  
 
Anaphylactoid Reactions:  
LCCC 1405  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Lee  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
September 26, 2014  
15 In post -marketing use, uncommon but serious anaphylactoid reactions were 
observed during or shortly following perflutren- containing microsphere 
administration including: shock, hypersensitivity, bronchospasm, throat 
tightness, angioedema, edema (pharyngeal, palatal , mouth, peripheral, 
localized), swelling (face, eye, lip, tongue, upper airway), facial hypoesthesia, rash, urticaria, pruritus, flushing, and erythema have occurred in patients with no prior exposure to perflutren- containing 
microsphere products.  
 
Syste mic Embolization of Perflutren in Patients with Cardiac Shunts:  
In patients with right -to-left, bi -directional, or transient right -to-left cardiac 
shunts phospholipid- encapsulated microspheres can bypass the pulmonary 
particle -filtering mechanisms and directly enter the arterial circulation 
resulting in microvascular occlusion and ischemia. In an animal study 
utilizing intra -arterial administration of activated perflutren, microsphere 
trapping was seen in small arterioles <15 μm, especially at branch point s 
and in capillaries at all doses tested, including doses directly applicable to those used in humans. An animal study utilizing intravenous 15 administration did not result in arterial microvascular obstruction presumably because of filtering by the lungs. Do not administer perflutren 
by intra-arterial injection.  
 
High Ultrasound Mechanical Index:  
High ultrasound mechanical index values may cause microsphere 
cavitation or rupture and lead to ventricular arrhythmias. Additionally, end-systolic triggering with high mechanical indices has been reported to cause 
ventricular arrhythmias. The safety of activated perflutren at mechanical indices greater than 0.8 has not been evaluated.    
 
QTc Prolongation:  
ECG parameters for doses up to10 microL/kg were monitored in 221 
subjects at multiple time points from 1 hour to 72 hours after the first bolus injection. In the 221 subjects, QTc prolongations of >30 msec were noted in 64 (29%) subjects. Forty -six out of 64 subjects with QTc prolongations 
were further evaluated and 39% (18/46) showed associated cardiac rhythm changes. The effects of concomitant drugs were not studied.  
6.1.6 Return and Retention of Study Drug  
Incomplete vials of  perflutren lipid remaining at the compl etion of the study, 
or expired perflutren lipid will be destroyed by UNC IDS.  
 
7.0 ADVERSE EXPERIENCES- DRUGS  
LCCC 1405  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Lee  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
September 26, 2014  
16 7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an 
abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug) in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.   
 
Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of an AE (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE.  Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable by the investigator to the study  therapy.  
7.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a 
reasonable possibility  that the drug is the cause.   Reasonable possibility  
means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the AE.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
 
Causali ty assessment to a study drug is a medical judgment made in 
consideration of the following factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, known mechanism of action or side effect profile of study treatment, other recent or concomitant drug exposures, normal clinical course of the disease under investigation, and any other underlying or concurrent medical conditions.  Other factors to consider in considering drug as the cause of the AE:  
• Single occurrence of an uncommon event known to be str ongly 
associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome)  
• One or more occurrences of an event not commonly associated with drug exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population (e.g., tendon rupture); often more tha n once occurrence from one 
or multiple studies would be needed before the sponsor could 
determine that there is reasonable possibility  that the drug caused 
the event.   
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial 
that indicates the events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group  
LCCC 1405  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Lee  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
September 26, 2014  
17 7.1.3 Unexpected AE or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered unexpected if  the sensitivity and specificity or 
severity of it is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product).  Unexpected also refers to AEs or SARs that are mentioned in 
the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.   
  
7.1.4 Serious AE or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes : 
• Death;  
• Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred);  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization (>24 hours) or prolongation of existing hospitalization;*  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life f unctions;  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed in the definition.  For reporting purposes, also consider the occurrences of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as an important medical event.  
 *Hospitalization  for anticipated or protocol specified procedures such as 
administration of chemotherapy, central line insertion, metastasis interventional therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious adverse events.  
 Pregnancy that occurs during the study must also be reported as an SAE.  
7.2 Documentation of non- serious AEs or SARs 
For non- serious AEs or SARs, documentation must begin from day 1 of 
study treatment and continue through the 30 day follow -up period after 
treatment is discontinued.   
 
Collected information should be recorded in the electronic Case Report Forms (e -CRF) for that patient.  Please include a description of the event, 
LCCC 1405  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Lee  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
September 26, 2014  
18 its severity or toxicity grade, onset and resolved dates (if applicable), and 
the relationship to the study drug.    Documentation should occur at least monthly.  
7.3 SAEs or Serious SARs  
7.3.1 Timing 
After informed consent but prior to initiation of study medications, only 
SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. 
SAEs relate d to invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication 
washout, or no treatment run- in).  
 For any other experience or condition that meets the definition of an SAE or a serious SAR, recording of the event must begin from day 1 of study treatment and contin ue through the 30 day follow -up period after treatment 
is discontinued.  
7.3.2 Documentation and Notification 
These events (SAEs or Serious SARs) must be recorded for that patient 
within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.   
7.3.3 Reporting  
IRB Reporting Requirements:  
• UNC will submit an aggregated list of all SAEs to the UNC IRB annually at the time of study renewal according to the UNC IRB policies and procedures.  
• The UNC- IRB will be notified of all SAEs that qualify as an 
Unanticipated Problem as per the  UNC IRB Policies using the IRB’s 
web-based reporting system (see section  8.2 ) within 7 days of the 
Investigator becoming aware of the problem.   
Pregnancy  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on study should be recorded as SAEs.  The patient is to be discontinued immediately from the study. The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician- gynecologist, preferably one experienced in 
reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.  
 The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must document the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome). If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE.

19 8.0 UNANTICIPATED CONCERNS  
8.1 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
The investigational device exemption (IDE) regulations define an 
unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) as “any serious adverse 
effect on health or safety or any life- threatening problem or death caused 
by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare  of subjects” (21 CFR 
812.3(s)).  
8.2 Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
As defined by UNC’s IRB, unanticipated problems involving risks to study 
subjects refers to any incident, experience, or outcome that:  
• Is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related 
docum ents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
• Is related or possibly related to a subject’s participation in the research; and  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) related to the research than was previously known or recognized.  
8.3 Reporting 
8.3.1 UADEs  
UADEs must be reported by the clinical investigator to the sponsor and the reviewing IRB, as described below:  
 For this device study , investigators are required to submit a report of a 
UADE to the FDA, the manufacturer of the device  and the UNC IRB as 
soon as possible, but in no event later than 10 working days after the 
investigator first learns of the event (§ 812.150(a)(1)), using the MedWatch Form 3500A .   Sponsors (LCCC) must immediately conduct an 
evaluation of a UADE and must report the results of the evaluation to FDA, the UNC IRB , and participating investigators within 10 working days 
after the sponsor first receives notice of the effect (§§ 812.46(b), 812.150(b)(1)).  
 
LCCC 1405  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Lee  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA

20 For this device study, we will submit a report of a UADE to the 
manufacturer and the IRB as soon as possible, but no later than 10 
working days after the investigators first learn of the event.  
8.3.2 UP 
Any events that meet the criteria for “Unanticipated Problems” as defined 
by UNC’s IRB must be reported by the Study Coordinator using the IRB’s 
web-based reporting system.   
 
Any unanticipated problem  that occurs during the conduct of this study 
and that meets at least  the first two criteria listed in  section 8.2 must be 
reported to the UNC IRB using the IRB’s web- based reporting system.   
9.0 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
The Principal Investigator will provide continuous monitoring of patient safety i n this trial with periodic reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC).  
 Meetings/teleconferences will be held at a frequency dependent on study accrual, and in consultation with the study Biostatistician.  These meetings will include the  investigators as well as protocol nurses, clinical research 
associates, regulatory associates, data managers, biostatisticians, and any other relevant personnel the principal investigators may deem appropriate.  At these meetings, the research team will discuss all issues relevant to study progress, including enrollment, safety, regulatory, data collection, etc.  
 The team will produce summaries or minutes of these meetings. These summaries will be available for inspection when requested by any of the regul atory bodies charged with the safety of human subjects and the 
integrity of data including, but not limited to, the oversight (Office of Human Research Ethics (OHRE) Biomedical IRB, the Oncology Protocol Review Committee (PRC) or the North Carolina TraCS Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).   
 The UNC LCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review the study on a regular (quarterly to annually) basis, with the frequency of review based on risk and complexity as determined by the UNC Protocol Review Committee.  The UNC PI will be responsible for 
submitting the following information for review: 1) safety and accrual data including the number of patients treated; 2) significant developments reported in the literature that may affect the safety of participants or the ethics of the study; 3) preliminary response data; and 4) summaries of team meetings that have occurred since the last report.  Findings of the DSMC review will be disseminated by memo to the UNC PI, PRC, and the UNC IRB an d DSMB.

21 10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This is a nonrandomized, single- center study.  The primary purpose and 
endpoint of this study is to compare, in a radiologist reader study, the 
sensitivity and specificity of the acoustic angiography system to the b -
mode ultrasound with pathology as the reference standard.   
10.1 Sample Size and Accrual  
  Per the revision in increased Perflutren dose, we have updated our sample size statistics as follows.  
  For power  calculation, the null hypothesis is that the specificity of acoustic 
angiography system is the same as the standard of care (b- mode 
ultrasound), which is assumed to be 70%. (We will determine the specificity of b -mode ultrasound during the trial to confirm that the 70% 
represents the specificity in the hands of UNC radiologists)  Under the alternative, we expect that the specificity of the new device is at least 90%. The specificities are measured relative to pathological diagnosis as the reference standard. With 60 lesions and 5 readers, where we anticipate that roughly half will be malignant, assuming the correlation from the same patient to be 0.5 and the readers to read different patients independently, the power to see specificity at least larger than 90% is 9 8% 
at the significance level 0.05 using one- side test. With 50 lesions (half are 
benign), the power to see specificity  of 90% is >96%; with 25 lesions 
(about 13 are benign), this power becomes 72%.   The power to reject the 
null hypothesis is 98%.  Although we will study both sensitivity and 
specificity, our power calculation is based on specificity, which is the primary interest.  
10.2 Data Analysis Plans 
10.2.1 Primar y Analysis  
This is a prospective study to assess the diagnostic performance of the newly developed device. The primary outcome of interest is the 
sensitivity and specificity of the acoustic angiography device  as 
compared to b- mode ultrasound. The sensitivity and specificity can be 
estimated non -parametrically as the proportion of the lesions which are 
distinguished as malignant versus non- malignant compared to the 
reference. This estimate will be calculated for each reader then averaged over all the readers. The standard error of the average sensitivity and specificity estimate will be calculated using the bootstrap method, where each patient is treated as independent unit with 5 ratings. The confidence interval of the final estimate will be provided using the norm ality 
assumption.  
 
LCCC 1405  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Lee  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
September 26, 2014  
22 Furthermore, we will estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the b- mode 
ultrasound in this study and compare it with the sensitivity and specificity 
estimate of the acoustic angiography device using the bootstrap approach 
and the confidence interval of their differences will be provided using the normality assumption.   
 Malignancy scores of +1 and +2 will be considered malignant.  Scores of -
2, -1, and 0 will be considered not malignant.   The confidence of 
malignancy will be used independently  
10.2.2 Secondary Analys es 
Radiologist Preference  
The secondary analysis will be to estimate the receiver operating characteristic ( sensitivity and specificity) curve for the acoustic 
angiography system, with an additional aim of evaluating reader preference for specific breast lesion characteristics.  Specifically, to compare the diagnostic performance, we will non- parametrically calculate 
the area under the ROC curve for each reader and each modality, where the ROC curve is derived using the different cut -off of the probability 
scores across 60 patients. We then fit a mixed effect model, where the outcomes are the estimated area under the ROC curves and the fixed effect is the dummy variable of the acoustic angiography system vs. conventional b- mode ultrasound.  The readers will be treated as random 
effect. F -test from model fitting will be used to test whether the acoustic 
angiograph has a significant larger AUC than the conventional b- mode 
ultrasound (with significance level 0.05).  
 To assess the  reader preference for modality for each characteristic 
including shape, margins and vascularity , we will fit a random effect model 
with only intercept and random terms for patients and readers while the outcomes are the confidence scores ( -3 to +3) . By testing the intercept 
significantly larger than zero, we will conclude that the new modality provides more confidence for readers than the conventional one.  
 
Image Segmentation and Tortuosity Quantification  
In order to derive quantitative vessel tortuosity metrics for the a coustic 
angiogr aphy images, we will perform an image processing workflow. The 
de-identified DICOM images will be converted to a 3- D volume and 
linearly up- sampled using MATLAB to create isotropic 50 x 50 x 50 micron 
voxels. Then, the lesion will be manually segmented to identify a region of interest (ROI) for vessel analysis. Using a series of algorithms [59, 60], each vessel in the ROI will be segmented and a series of tortuosity metrics will be calculated. The vessels are segmented using semi -
automated multi -scale ridge t raversal and stored as a series of center -line 
point coordinates (x,y,z) forming a spline. The radius of the vessel is estimated at each point and saved as a fourth parameter. [14, 61] Each

PI: Lee  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
September 26, 2014  
23 tortuosity metric will be used individually to contrast benign and malignant 
lesions using a two- sided t -test, incorporating a Bonferroni correction to 
account for multiple hypothesis testing.  
 
Predicting Malignancy  
In order to predict malignancy based on the quantitative vessel tortuosity 
metrics, the set of images will be randomly divided into two halves to form a training data set and a test data set. The malignant lesions and the benign lesions will be randomly assigned to the training or test group separately to ensure that both groups contain both types of images. Multivariate binary logistic regression will be used to predict malignancy based on the full set of tortuosity metrics for the training data set of 30 images. We will examine the model for multicollinearity using pairwise correlations and perform linear discriminant analysis to choose a smaller subset of metrics if over -fitting due to multicollinearity appears to be a 
problem. The model will then be used to predict the probability of 
malignancy  of the test set of 30 images  (via development of a model -
based malignancy score). We will construct a receiver operator curve 
(ROC) by determining the sensitivity and specificity of the model when varying the threshold of probability of malignancy. We can then compare the performance of the quantitative tortuosity model to the reader study by comparing the area under the curve for both ROCs.  
11.0 STUDY MANAGEMENT  
11.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval and Consent  
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance with federally mandated regulations.  The IRB should approve the consent form and protocol.  
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their 
origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
   Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. Each consent form must include all the relevant 
elements currently required by the FDA Regulations and local or state regulations. Once this essential information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing an IRB -approved consent 
form.  
 
LCCC 1405  CONFIDENTIAL

modification form must be completed by UNC Research Personnel within five (5) business days of making the change.   
11.5.2 Single Patient/Subject Exceptions  
Any request to enroll a single subject who does not meet all the eligibility criteria of this study requires the approval of the UNC Princi pal 
Investigator and the UNC IRB.  
11.5.3 Other Protocol Deviations/Violations  
All other planned deviations from the protocol must have prior approval by the Principal Investigator and the UNC IRB.  According to UNC’s IRB, a protocol deviation is any unplanned variance from an IRB approved 
protocol that:  
• Is generally noted or recognized after it occurs  
• Has no substantive effect on the risks to research participants  
• Has no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan or the value of the data collected  
• Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the investigator(s).  
 
An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation  if the variance:  
• Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more research participants.  
• Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the 
study.  
• Results from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the investigator(s).  
• Demonstrates serious or continuing noncompliance with federal regulations, State laws, or University polic ies. 
 If a deviation or violation occurs without prior approval from the Principal Investigator, please follow the guidelines below:  
 
Protocol Deviations: UNC personnel will keep a log of any protocol 
deviations and report them to the study sponsor or data and safety 
monitoring committee in accordance with their policies.  Deviations should be summarized and reported to the IRB at the time of continuing review.  
 Protocol Violations: Violations should be reported by UNC personnel 
within one (1) week of the investigator becoming aware of the event using the same IRB online mechanism used to report Unanticipated Problems.   
11.6 Amendments to the Protocol  
Should amendments to the protocol be required, the amendments will be originated and documented by the Principal  Investigator at UNC.  It should

26 also be noted that when an amendment to the protocol substantially alters 
the study design or the potential risk to the patient, a revised consent form might be required.   
 The written amendment, and if required the amende d consent form, must 
be sent to UNC’s IRB for approval prior to implementation.   
11.7 Record Retention  
Study documentation includes all Case Report Forms, data correction forms or queries, source documents, Sponsor -Investigator 
correspondence, monitoring logs/letters, and regulatory documents (e.g., 
protocol and amendments, IRB correspondence and approval, signed patient consent forms).  
 Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities and all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical research study.  
 Government agency regulations and directives require that all study documentation pertaining to the conduct of a clinical trial must be retained by the study investigator.  In  the case of a study with a drug seeking 
regulatory approval and marketing, these documents shall be retained for at least two years after the last approval of marketing application in an International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) region.  In all othe r 
cases, study documents should be kept on file until three years after the completion and final study report of this investigational study.  
11.8 Obligations of Investigators  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at the  site in accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations 
and/or the Declaration of Helsinki.  The Principal Investigator is responsible for personally overseeing the treatment of all study patients.  The Principal Investigator must assure that all study site personnel, including sub- investigators and other study staff members, adhere to the 
study protocol and all FDA/GCP/NCI regulations and guidelines regarding clinical trials both during and after study completion.  
 The Principal Investigator at each institution or site will be responsible for assuring that all the required data will be collected and entered onto the Case Report Forms. Periodically, monitoring visits will be conducted and the Principal Investigator will provide access to his/her  original records to 
permit verification of proper entry of data. At the completion of the study, all case report forms will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and will require his/her final signature to verify the accuracy of the data.

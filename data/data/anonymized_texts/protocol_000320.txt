Confidential and Proprietary  Page 6 of 70  During the study treatment period, blood samples will be collected for safety analysis and for 
PK analysis of omadacycline.  Urine samples will be collected during the study period for 
safety, PK analysis, and microbiological analysis.  Safety assessments will include monitoring of adverse events (AEs),  concomitant medications,  clinical laboratory test results, vital sign 
measurements, pregnancy testing and physical examination findings.
 
Subjects will return to the clinical site for visits on Day 1, Day 3, Day 5, and for an End of 
Treatment (EOT) /Day 7  visit on the day of or within the 2 days following the last dose of test 
article.  Subjects will return to the study site for a Post Therapy Evaluation (PTE) on Day 14 (+/- 2 days) after the subject’s first dose of test article.  A Final Follow -up assessment will be 
conducted within 30 to 37 days following the first dose of test article.  The Final Follow -up 
assessment may be conducted via telephone contact or by another interactive technology for subjects who are not having any symptoms and had no AEs or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities noted at or after the PTE visit.  Otherwise, this assessment is to be performed with an in -person study visit.  During the Follow- up call/visit if the subject reports symptoms 
of potential recurrence, additional procedures will be performed.  
 
Rationale for Omadacycline Dose Regimen Selection:  
The dosing regimen of omadacycline selected for this study is based on the nonclinical and 
clinical experience to date, including in vitro antibacterial activity, PK characteristics, clinical efficacy  in prior studies, and the overall safety and tolerability profile.  Key considerations in 
dose selection are summarized below:
 
• While the driver of efficacy for omadacycline in UTI is not known, a pragmatic 
assumption was made that maximizing the time of urine concentration above 
pathogen MIC (ideally, throughout the dosing interval) would be desirable. 
• In PTK 0796- UUTI -15103, omadacycline dosed as 300 mg po  every 12 hours 
(q12h) on Day 1 followed by 300 mg po daily for 5 days and 450 mg po q12h on Day 1 followed by 450 mg po daily for 5 days both demonstrated high urinary concentration s on Day 1 and Day 5.  For the 300 mg dosing group, over the 24 
hour dosing period, mean urinary concentrations ranged from 14 to 20 µg/mL on Day 1 and 17 to 30 µg/mL on Day 5.  For the 450 mg dosing group, over the 24 hour dosing period, mean urinary concentrations ranged from 11 to 25 µg/mL on Day 1 and 30 to 48 µg/mL on Day 5. 
• In PTK0796- UUTI -15103, both the 300 mg and 450 mg omadacycline treatment 
groups had nausea reported in 60% of  subjects.  Vomiting occurred in 40% and 
20% of the 300 mg and 450 mg treatment groups, respectively.  In the recently completed PTK0796- ABSI -16301 study which compared  omadacycline 450 mg 
po every 24 hours (q24h) for 2 doses followed by 300 mg po q24h for a total of 7  
to 14 days to linezolid 600 mg po every 12 hours for a total of 7 to 14 days, nausea and vomiting rates of 30.2% and 16.8% were observed.  In both studies, most events of nausea and vomiting occurred early in the treatment associated 
with the loading doses of omadacycline. 
• The effect  of a light meal administered approximately 1.5 hours before dosing 
was evaluated using the free base formulati on of omadacycline and resulted in 
approximately 20% decrease in exposure.  In the recently completed study 
Omadacycline   Paratek Pharmaceuticals, LLC 
PTK0796 -UUTI -17201 -Version 3.0 FINAL; 18-FEB- 2019 IND # 75,928 IND # 73,431 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 7 of 70 PTK0796 -DDI-17106, the effect of a light meal administered approximately 1.5 
hours before dosing with the same formulation of omadacycline used in t he 
pivotal Phase 3 studies was evaluated .  The results demonstrated an 
approximately 19% to  25% reduction in exposure when a light meal was 
administered 1.5 hours before dosing. 
• The Sponsor has decided to  add an omadacycline treatment group dosed at 450 
mg twice daily  for 7 days . The rationale for the change includes: 
1)    Since the driver of efficacy is unknown and the mean renal excretion of a 300 
mg oral dose is 14.4%,  a regimen that maximizes the tolerated dose of 
omadacycline may provide additional information on the dose necessary for clinical and microbiologic success in uUTI and allow comparison to the daily 
dosed omadacycline treatment groups. 
2) The proposed dosing of 450mg twice daily for 7 days will provide approximately 2x or greater the amount of omadacycline that is excreted into the urine compared to the daily omadacycline treatment groups.   
3) Blinded review of the first 145 subjects reveals good tolerability. Nausea has 
occurred in approximately 10% of all subjects with only a single subject 
(0.7%) reporting vomiting. There has been only one treatment discontinuation 
due to adverse events of nausea and/or vomiting reported. Therefore, even if all cases of nausea and vomiting were in a single omadacycline treatment group, nausea and vomiting appears lower than observed in  PTK0796- UUTI -
15103 study. 
4) Dose -limiting transaminase increases were seen in Phase 1 studies at 600mg 
IV which is higher than the exposure at 450mg PO twice daily.  
5) Increases in heart rate following omadacycline are Cmax associated . Cmax 
concentrations with the 450mg PO dose (1077 ng/mL) at steady state are 
approximately one-half the Cmax concentration with the 100mg IV dose (2120 ng/mL) suggesting that heart rate increases above 12- 17 bpm observed 
with 100-200mg IV doses in healthy patients is unlikely following 450mg 
twice daily dosing. 
Therefore based on the pharmacokinetic, clinical, and safety  data, the 450mg 
twice daily dose will increase urinary concentration, may provide additional 
clinical and microbiologic benefit while maintaining the safety profile observed with daily dosing. 
 
In order to minimize the effect of food on exposure and to potentially minimize the impact  of 
nausea and vomiting during the omadacycline loading dose, omadacycline will be dosed twice on Day 1 with each dose administered 2 hours following a light meal, and all even numbered doses will be administered approximately 2 hours following a light mea l.Given the urinary 
concentrations observed in PTK0796- UUTI -15103 and the expected impact of a light meal, 
urinary concentrations should remain above the typical omadacycline MIC
90 of 2 µg/mL for 
Escherichia  coli, the most common uropathogen in uncomplicated cystitis.

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 8 of 70 Approximately 2 25 female subjects  will be enrolled at up to 25 sites.  Subjects will be 
randomized (1:1:1:1:1 ) to five treatment groups.  
Adaptive design:  
This is an adaptive dose-response finding study.  During the course of the study, a Bayesian 
analysis will be used to adaptively allocate new subjects to one of the treatment arms, conditional on the availability of primary efficacy endpoint data (investigator assessment of clinical response at PTE) .  When there is sufficient information available about the dose-
response, results from the Bayesian analysis will be reviewed by a DMC to determine if enrollment in any omadacycline treatment arms should be stopped or modified. Modifications to omadacycline dosing regimens/treatment arms may also be based on safety and tolerability.  
Bayesian analyses will be conducted after efficacy data (investigator assessment of clinical response at PTE) are available for approximately 40, 80, and 100 subjects in order to :  
• Determin e omadacycline dose group(s) that can be dropped from the trial, or  
• Modify the randomization ratios among the dose groups to improve the precision 
of the selected dose groups comparison of clinical success to the that of the 
nitrofurantoin group.   
 
Additional analyses may be carried out for the same two purposes.  Response criteria are targeted toward estimating the probability that the clinical success rate (proportion of subjects) for each dose group is within 10% of that of the nitrofurantoin group.  If at the analyses, that probability falls b elow 30% for a particular dose group, recruitment for that 
dose group may be stopped or curtailed.  If that probability exceeds 80% for a particular dose group, recruitment for that dose group may be increased to improve the precision of the estimate.

Enrollment of a total of ap proximately 225 subjects is planned.  The Bayesian posterior 
probability that the clinical success rate at the PTE Visit is within 0.10 of that of the 
nitrofurantoin group will be estimated for each omadacycline dose group.  The target 
probability is 0.80.  If the true underlying clinical succe ss rates for  the nitrofurantoin and 
omadacycline dose groups are 0.82, then the sample size of N=50 per treatment has 
approximately 79% power/ probability to yield the target probability (N=53  per treatment for 
80% power). T he sample size may be increased for a particular omadacycline dos ing group by 
changing the randomization ratio and/or dropping a dose group to achieve improved power / 
probability of achieving the target probability that clinical success rates for a dose group  is 
within 0.10 of that of the nitrofurantoin group. If required to improve the precision of the 
interim or projected final analyses estimates of response rates or posterior probabilities, sample size may be increased to a maximum sample size provided in the statistical analysis plan ( SAP).  Subjects will be  randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to f ive treatment groups.  
 
The following subject analysis populations have been defined: 
• Intent- to-treat (ITT):  all randomized subjects. 
• Safety:  all randomized subjects who receive any amount of test article.   
• The microbiological ITT  (micro -ITT) population will consist of subject s in the 
ITT population who have a study-qualifying pre- treatment  positive  Baseline urine 
culture with 1 or 2 uropathogens at ≥10
5 Colony Forming Units (CFU)/mL . (ME) 
population will include subjects in the CE population who have a study-qualifying 
pre-treatment Baseline urine culture with 1 or 2 uropathogens at ≥105 CFU/mL .   
• The clinically evaluable (CE) population will c onsist of all ITT subjects who 
received test article, have a qualifying infection, an assessment of outcome, and 
meet all other evaluability criteria detailed in the SAP . 
• The microbiologically evaluable (ME) population will include subjects in the CE 
population who have a study-qualifying pre- treatment Baseline urine culture with 
1 or 2 uropathogens at ≥ 105 CFU/mL .   
 
All safety data will be summarized by treatment groups and  the incidence of AEs will be 
presented  by system organ class (SOC)  and preferred term (PT)  according to the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA®), relationship to the test article, and severity.  
Descriptive statistics of clinical laboratory  results and vital signs and the change from 
Baseline will be presented as will a summary of clinically notable values. 
The number and percentage of subjects with investigator ’s assessment of clinical response 
and a microbiological response will be presented at each time point measured by treatment 
group.  Exact 95% confidence intervals will be determined for the point estimates of the clinical success rates and the microbiological success.  A comparison of the clinical success rate at PTE between each omadacycline dose group and the nitrofurantoin group will be conducted using a beta distribution with an uninformative Bayesian prior distribution.

 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)  
Uncomplicated Urinary tract infection (UTI) or acute cystitis is characterized by dysuria, 
frequency and urgency with pyuria, and bacteriuria in a person without underlying urologic 
or renal abnormalities.  The burden of UTI is high in women; up to 60% of women have an 
episode during their lifetime .1,2,3,4 Long- term morbidity is low; however, the 30 % to 40% 
recurrence rate is significant .1,2,5  Short- term morbidity has been described in female college 
students who experienced a mean of 6.1 symptomatic days and 2.4 days of restricted activity per episode.
1,3 Recieveing n o treatment or an ineffective treatment for an uUTI increases the 
duration of symptoms and can be complicated by pyelonephritis in approximately 2.6% of women .
6,7  
Uncomplicated UTIs are predominately caused by E. coli (80% to 85%) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (5% to 15%) with a small minority caused by 
Klebsiella  pneumoniae , Proteus mirabilis , and other uropathogens .
1,6  Increasing rates of 
resistance among UTI pathogens to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, beta- lactams and 
fluoroquinolones, as well as, a recent safety warning to previously recommended first -line 
antibiotics (fluoroquinolone Food and Drud Adminstration  [FDA] safety alert and black box 
warnings ) has necessitated  reconsideration of antibiotic treatment recommendations. 
Fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin are now considered first- line agent s in the treatment of UTI. 
Resistance is generally low however emerging resistance has been observed in multi -drug 
resistant isolates. As a result, there is a need for new agents with efficacy against resistant 
uropathogens including extended- spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli .8 
 Omadacycline  
The investigational product, omadacycline (formerly named PTK 0796), is the first member 
of the aminomethylcycline class of antibiotics, which are semi synthetic derivatives of the 
tetracycline class.  As a class, the tetracyclines have been in use for approximately 7 0 years. 
They are well -tolerat ed, and have proven effective in the treatment of a variety of bacterial 
infections. Omadacycline is being developed for clinical use by both intravenous (iv) and per oral  (po)  administration. The targeted indications include community- acquired bacterial 
pneumonia (CABP), acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), and UTI.  
Omadacycline has been evaluated in a global Phase 3 study comparing the safety and efficacy of iv and po omadacycline to iv and po linezolid in the treatment of adult subjects with ABSSSI (PTK0796 -ABSI -1108).  In addition, a global Phase 3 study has been 
conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of iv and po omadacycline compared to iv and po moxifloxacin in the treatment of adult subjects with CABP  (PTK0796- CABP -1200).  The 
latest United States ( US)-only Phase 3 study compared the safety of po only omadacycline to 
po only linezolid in the treatment of adult subjects with ABSSSI (PTK0796- ABSI -16301).  
In all three studies, omadacycline was well -tolerated and demonstrated non- inferiority to its 
respective comparator.  Omadacycline (IV and PO) has recently been approved by US FDA 
for the treatment of adults with ABSSSI and CABP infections .

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 22 of 70 The drug is active against strains expressing both mechanisms of tetracycline 
resistance,namely efflux and ribosomal protection.9  Omadacycline has in vitro activity 
against the most common uUTI uropathogens including E. coli  and S. saprophyticus.  
Resistance to other antibiotics does not affect omadacycline activity. Omadacycline is not affected by tetracycline- resistance, presence of ESBL, or other common resistance 
mechanisms.  Omadacycline is active against the Enterobacteriaceae with a significant proportion of isolates having an  minimum inhib itory concentration ( MIC ) < 2.0 μg/ml.  The 
minimum inhibitory concentrations for at least 90% of the common uUTI pathogens tested 
(MIC
90) for omadacycline are 0.5 µg/mL for S. saprophyticus , 2 µg/mL for ESBL-negative 
E. coli , and 2 µg/mL for ESBL-producing E. coli .9 
Study PTK0796- UUTI -15103 was a randomized (1:1:1), open- label, parallel -desig ned 
Phase 1b study evaluating 3 dosing regimens of omadacycline in 31 female adults with cystitis. During the treatment period, serial blood and urine samples were collected for safety, microbiological, and pharmacokinetic ( PK) analyses of omadacycline. In  this study, t he PK 
of omadacycline in women with cystitis was found to be similar to the PK in healthy subjects. At steady -state, 10% to 13% of a po omadacycline dose is excreted in the urine, 
resulting in high urine concentrations. With the treatment reg imens studied, observed urine 
concentrations of omadacycline compared favorably with MIC values for common UTI pathogens, and a high percentage of subjects achieved clinical success and favorable microbiological responses. There was a higher than expected incidence of nausea and 
vomiting, which contrasts with the notably lower rates of nausea and vomiting observed in other omadacycline studies using comparable dosing regimens and active controls. The reason(s) for the increased incidences in nausea and vomi ting are difficult to ascertain given 
the open- label study design, small sample size, and lack of prior experience with 
omadacycline in the cystitis study population.  
This study is intended to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of oral omadacycline as compared 
to oral  nitrofurantoin in the treatment of adult female subject s with cystitis . These data will 
be important to determine the potential utility of omadacycline for the treatment of UTI and 
will help in selection of dosing regimens that may be used in future UTI studies.  
It is expected that the dosing regimens evaluated in this study will provide urine concentrations of omadacycline that will exceed the MIC
90 for the common uncomplicated 
UTI pathogens (see dose selection discussion in Section 7.4 ). 
Please refer to the current version of the Investigator's Brochure10 for additional information 
on omadacycline.

 Overall Study Description  
This is a randomized, double-blinded, adaptive designed Phase 2 study evaluating 3 dosing 
regimens of once-daily omadacycline, 1 dosing regimen of twice-daily omadacycline 
compared to twice -daily  nitrofurantoin in the treatment of female adults with cystit is.  The 
planned length of subject participation in the study is up to 37  days which includes a total 
duration of study therapy for 7 days.   
The study will consist of 3 protocol-defined phases :  Screening, double-blind treatment and 
follow-up.  All Screening evaluations should be completed  within the 24 hours prior to 
randomization.  Subjects who me et inclusion criteria, and do not meet exclusion criteria will 
be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 oral omadacycline dosing regimens or a twice-daily regimen 
of oral nitrofurantoin (see  Table 1  and Table  2).  Subjects should receive their first dose of 
test article at the site within 4  hours after randomization .  Treatment will be double-blinded 
and double- dummy (see Table 2 ). Please refer to  Section 9 of the protocol for further details 
on study phases and required assessments/procedures per phase.  
During the study treatment period, blood samples will be collected for safety analysis and for PK analysis of omadacycline.  Urine samples will be collect ed during the study period for 
safety , PK analysis, and microbiological  analysis.  Safety assessments will include 
monitoring of adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, clinical laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, pregnancy testing and physical examination findings. 
Subjects will return to the clinical site for visits on  Day  1, Day 3, Day 5, and for an End of 
Treatment (EOT) /Day 7  visit on the day of or within 2 days following the last dose.  Subjects 
will also return to the study site for a Post Therapy Evaluation (PTE) on Day 14 (+/- 2 days) 
after the subject’s first dose of test article.  A Final Follow -up assessment  will be conducted 
within 30 to 37 days following the first dose of test article.  The Final Fo llow-up assessment 
may be conducted via telephone contact or by another interactive technology for subjects 
who are not having any symptoms and had no AEs or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities noted at or after the PTE visit.  Otherwise, this assessmen t is to be performed 
with an in -person study visit. During the Follow- up call/visit if the subject reports symptoms 
of potential recurrence, additional  procedures will be performed.   
See Appendix 1 for the full Schedule of Events. 
5.1.1 Adaptive Design 
This is an adaptive dose-response finding study. Initially, subjects will be  randomized 
(1:1:1:1:1 ) to five treatment groups. During the course of the study, a Bayesian analysis will 
be used to adaptively allocate new subjects to one of the treatment arms, conditional on the availability of primary efficacy endpoint data (investigator assessment of clinical response at PTE). When there is sufficient information available about the dose- response, results from 
the Bayesian analys is will be reviewed by a DMC to determine if enrollment in any

dosing regimens/treatment arms may also be based on safety and tolerability. Bayesian analyses will be conducted after efficacy data (investigator assessment of clinical response at PTE) are available for approximately 40, 80, and 100 subjects in order to :  
1. Determine  omadacycline dose group(s) that can be dropped from the trial, or  
2. Modify the randomization ratios among the dose groups to improve the precision of the selected dose groups comparison of clinical success to that of the nitrofurantoin group.   
Additional analyses may be carried out for the same two purposes.  Response cri teria are 
targeted toward estimating the probability that the clinical success rate (proportion of subjects) for each omadacycline dose group is within 10% of that of the nitrofurantoin group.  If at the analyses, that probability falls below 30% for a particular dose group, recruitment for that dose group may be stopped or curtailed.  If that probability exceeds 80% for a particular omadacycline dose group, recruitment for that dose group may be  increased to 
improve the precision of the estimate.  
 Rationale for Study Design   
Omadacycline is the first member of the aminomethylcycline class of antibiotics, which are semisynthetic derivatives of the tetracycline class.  Omadacycline- has in vitro  activity 
against the most common bacterial pathogens associated with cystitis .  Omadacycline has 
been shown to have a significant fraction of the administered dose excreted by the kidneys and is present as active drug in the urine.  The safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK) of omadacycline have been evaluated in a limited number of adults with cystitis.  
 Rationale for Control Group  
Nitrofurantoin (Macrobid) is approved in the US for the treatment of acute uncomplicated 
urinary tract infection (acute cystitis) at a dose of 100 mg administered orally every 12 hours (q12h) for 7 days .
11  It is recommended as a first line treatment by the Infectious Disease 
Society of America and the European Society of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.6  
Clinical studies have demonstrated equivalent microbiologic eradication with other nitrofurantoin formulations (Macrodantin ).
11  Equivalent early and late clinical efficacy and 
early bacterial cure with other commonly used first line thera pies for uUTI including 
trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin, and ciprofloxacin have been demonstrated in 
four randomized clinical trials.6  Resistance to nitrofurantoin is low and the therapy is 
generally well tolerated.6  The most frequently reported AEs  that are possibly or probably 
drug related include nausea, headache, and flatulence.11 
 Approximate Duration of Subject Participation  
Subjects will participate in the study for up to 37 days.  Following Screening , eligible 
subjects will be randomly assigned to receive 7 days of po treatment of either omadacycline or nitrofurantoin.  Subjects will return to the site for an EOT visit within 2 days following the last dose of test article, and then again for a PTE visit on Day 14 (+/- 2 days) after the

The comparator drug, nitrofurantoin, is an antibacterial agent specific for urinary tract 
infections.  It has an acceptable and well -defined safety profile.  Nitrofurantoin is 
well-tolerated, can be adm inistered orally, is well -concentrated in the urine and is shown to 
be effective against common uncomplicated UTI uropathogens including E. coli and 
Staphylococcus saprophyticus .  
 Dose Selection Rationale  
The dosing regimen of omadacycline selected for this study is based on the nonclinical and clinical experience to date, including in vitro  antibacterial activity, PK characteristics, 
clinical efficacy in prior studies, and the overall safety and tolerability profile.  Key 
considerations in dose selection are summarized below:  
• While the driver of efficacy for omadacycline in UTI is not known, a pragmatic 
assumption was made that maximizing the time of urine concentration above pathogen 
MIC (ideally, throughout the dosing interval) would be desirable. 
• In PTK 0796- UUTI -15103, omadacycline dosed as 300 mg po q12h on Day 1 followed by 
300 mg po daily for 5 days and 450 mg po q12h on Day 1 followed by 450 mg po daily 
for 5 days both demonstrated high urinary concentrations on Day 1 and Day 5.  For the 300 mg dosing group, over the 24-hour dosing period, mean urinary concentrations ranged from 14 to  20 µg/mL on Day 1 and 17 to  30 µg/mL on Day 5.  For the 450 mg 
dosing group, over the 24-hour dosing period, mean urinary concentrations ranged from 11 to  25 µg/mL on Day 1 and 30 to  48 µg/mL on Day 5. 
• In PTK0796- UUTI -15103, both the 300 mg and 450 mg omadacycline treatment groups 
had nausea reported in 60% of subjects.  Vomiting occurred in 40% and 20% of the 300 mg and 450 mg treatment groups, respectively.  In the recently completed PTK0796- ABSI -16301 study which compared omadacycline 450 mg po every 24 hours 
(q24h) for 2 doses followed by 300 mg po q24h for a total of 7  to 14 days to linezolid 
600 mg po q12h for a total of 7  to 14 days , nausea and vomiting rates of 30.2% and 
16.8% were observed.  In both studies, most events of nausea and vomiting occurred early in the treatment associated with the loading doses of omadacycline.  
• The effect  of a light meal administered approximately 1.5 hours before dosing was 
evaluated using the free base formulation of omadacycline and resulted in approximately 20% decrease in exposure.  In the recently completed study PTK0796- DDI-17106, t he 
effect of a light meal administered approximately 1.5 hours before dosingwith  the same 
formulation of omadacycline used in the pivotal Phase 3 studies was evaluated .  The 
results demonstrated an approximately 19% to  25% reduction in exposure when a light 
meal was administered 1.5 hours before dosing. 
• The Sponsor has decided to add an omadacycline treatment group dosed at 450 mg twice 
daily for 7 days. The rationale for the change includes: 
1)    Since the driver of efficacy is unknown and the mean renal excretion of a 300 
mg oral dose is 14.4%,  a regimen that maximizes the tolerated dose of 
omadacycline may provide additional information on the dose necessary for

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 32 of 70 clinical and microbiologic success in uUTI and allow comparison to the daily 
dosed omadacycline treatment groups. 
6) The proposed dosing of 450mg twice daily for 7 days will provide 
approximately 2x or greater the amount of omadacycline that is excreted into 
the urine compared to the daily omadacycline treatment groups.   
7) Blinded review of the first 145 subjects reveals good tolerability. Nausea has occurred in approximately 10% of all subjects with only a single subject (0.7%) reporting vomiting. There has been only one treatment disco ntinuation due to adverse events of nausea and/or vomiting reported. 
Therefore, even if all cases of nausea and vomiting were in a single omadacycline treatment group, nausea and vomiting appears lower than observed in  PTK0796- UUTI -15103 study. 
8) Dose -limiting transaminase increases were seen in Phase 1 studies at 600mg 
IV which is higher than the exposure at 450mg PO twice daily. 
9) Increases in heart rate following omadacycline are Cmax associated . Cmax 
concentrations with the 450mg PO dose (1077 ng/mL) at st eady state are 
approximately one-half the Cmax concentration with the 100mg IV dose (2120 ng/mL) suggesting that heart rate increases above 12 -17 bpm observed 
with 100-200mg IV doses in healthy patients is unlikely following 450mg twice daily dosing.  
There fore based on the pharmacokinetic, clinical, and safety data, the 450mg 
twice daily dose will increase urinary concentration, may provide additional clinical and microbiologic benefit while maintaining the safety profile observed with daily dosing. 
 
In order to minimize the effect of food on exposure and to potentially minimize the impact of 
nausea and vomiting during the omadacycline loading dose, omadacycline will be dosed twice on Day 1 with each dose administered approximately 2 hours following a light meal. In addition, all even numbered doses will also be administered approximately 2 hours following a light meal.  Given the urinary concentrations observed in PTK0796- UUTI -15103 and the 
expected impact of a light meal, urinary co ncentrations should remain above the typical 
omadacycline MIC
90 of 2 µg/mL for E.coli , the most common uropathogen in uncomplicated 
cystitis.

d   Beginning with Dose 4, all even numbered doses should be taken approxi mately 2 hours after a light meal.  
 
 Dose Adjustments and Interruptions of Test Article  
No dose adjustments or interruptions of test article will be permitted during this study.  
 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  
Initially , all eligible subjects will be randomized via an IxRS that assigns them to 1 of the 
5 treatment arms (in a 1:1:1:1:1  ratio).  The site delegate will contact the IxRS (via phone or 
web) after confirming that the subject fulfills all the inclusion criteria and  none of the 
exclusion criteria.  The IxRS will assign a test article to the subject based on a 
computer-generated randomization schedule.  The randomization will be a blocked randomization sequence as defined in the IxRS specifications and Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  Subjects randomized into the study will be assigned the treatment corresponding to 
the next available number from the computer- generated randomization schedule.  The subject 
is considered randomized when the IxRS provides the test articl e assignment, regardless of 
whether the subject actually receives any medication .  As this is an adaptive design trial, any 
updates to the randomization schedule based upon the Bayesian analysis will be incorporated into the IxRS system.  
 
7.8.1 Subject  Numbering  
Upon signing the informed consent, the subject will be assigned a unique subject number. 
Subject number ranges will be provided by the sponsor.  Subjects who have been 
pre-screened on the telephone but who do not sign an ICF will not be assigned a subject number.  A subject who discontinues participation or is withdrawn before receiving a treatment assignment , and who is re-screened  at a later time will be assigned a new subject 
number and recorded as re- screened at the discretion of the investigator and in consultation 
with the sponsor as necessary .  The investigator will maintain a subject master list to 
document every subject who has signed an ICF .  A copy of this list should be retained in the 
investigator’s study files.     
 Dispensing Test Article  
Each study site will be supplied by the sponsor with the investigational product and comparator.  Test articles will be supplied to the sites in kits that contain active omadacycline tablets or matched placebo tablets, and active nitrofurantoi n over -encapsulated capsules or 
matched placebo over-encapsulated capsules.  Oral test article supplies are completely 
blinded and blinded study personnel can conduct storage, dispensation, and reconciliation.  The IxRS will  assign the test article kit to  be given to the subject.  The study 
coordinator/staff will instruct the subject on the use of po test article.

 Blinding  
The investigator and s ponsor will be blinded to treatment group assignments throughout the 
study.  The  sponsor designee (eg, study st atistical team, IxRS vendor, etc.) will have a 
designated randomization administrator who will maintain the randomization codes in 
accordance with standard operating procedures to ensure the blind is properly maintained, and that only sponsor personnel who require knowledge of treatment assignments will be unblinded (eg, staff involved in maintaining the randomization codes).  The DMC will review safety data and the results from the Bayesian analysis of efficacy based on masked (treatments groups 1 to  4) treatment assignments.   Based on this analysis, modifications may 
be made to the omadacycline treatment groups.  
The study will follow a double-dummy design.  Subjects assigned to omadacycline will receive active omadacycline tablets and over -encapsulated nitrofurantoin placebo capsules.  
Subjects assigned to the  nitrofurantoin  arm will receive omadacycline placebo tablets and 
over- encapsulated active nitrofurantoin  capsules.  
Randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of database lock and 
unblinding at the end of the study.  
Unblinding is only to occur in the case of subject emergencies (see S ection 7.11, below) and 
at the conclusion of the study.  
 Emergency  Unblinding of Treatment Assignment  
Emergency unblinding should only be undertaken when it is essential to treat the subject 
safely and efficaciously.  Most often, test article discontinuation and knowledge of the possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study subject who presents with an emergency condition.  It is encouraged for the investigator, when contemplating unblinding, to contact the sponsor or sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor or designee to confirm the 
need to unblind, prior to unblinding (see Section 2 for contact information).  However, if 
required, the investigator can unblind without consulting the Medical Monitor. 
Emergency code breaks are performed using the IxRS.  When the investigator contacts the 
system to unblind a subject, he/she must provide the requested subject identifying information and confirm the necessity to unblind the subject.  The investigator will then 
receive details of the drug treatment for the specified subject and a fax or e -mail confirming 
that the treatment assignment of the subject was unblinded.  The system will automatically 
inform the s ponsor’s monitor for the site and the sponsor that the code has been broken. 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a procedure in place at their site  to 
allow access to the IxRS code break information in case of emergency.  The investigator will 
inform the subject how to contact his/her backup in cases of emergency when he/she is unavailable.  The investigator will provide protocol number, test article name if available, 
subject number, and instructions for contacting the sponsor (or any entity to which it has delegated responsibil ity for emergency code breaks) to the subject in case emergency 
unblinding is required at a time when the investigator and backup are unavailable.

as possible and n ot more than 24 hours afterwards.   It will be the responsibility of all study 
personnel to ensure that, except for the above procedure, investigator blinding is maintained until after study completion. 
 Prior & Concomitant Therapy  
Treatments that have been administered within the 7 days prior to  the date of informed 
consent, or during the Screening phase, will be recorded in the eCRF .  The investigator is to 
instruct the subject to notify the study site about any new medications he /she takes after the 
start of the test article.  All medications and significant non-drug therapies (including 
physical therapy and blood transfusions) administered after the subject starts treatment with test article must be listed in the eCRF (see Secti on 9).  In addition, for antibacterial agents  
and anti- emetics administered , the dose, unit, frequency and route must be entered in the 
eCRF.  
 Prohibited  Therapy  
• All investigational medications or devices used during the 30  days prior to Screening are 
prohibited.   
All of the following therapies are excluded starting from the time of consent through EOT  
visit: 
• Potentially therapeutic  antibacterial agents  (with potential activity against uropathogens 
responsible for  UTI ) are prohibited for 72 hours prior to randomization through EOT, 
with the except ion of cases where a subject is deemed a clinical failure  during the course 
of the study and requires treatment with an additional antibacterial agent   
• Subjects will be instructed to avoid taking antacids and multivitamins containing 
multivalent cations (eg, aluminum, magnesium, calcium, bismuth, iron, or zinc) for 
6 hours before and within 4 hours after  doses 1, 2 and all subsequent odd numbered doses 
• Non- steroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID s) are prohibited

considered as a concomitant medication.  
Subjects should be encouraged to contact site personnel before starting any new treatment.  
For all treatments received by the subject during the study, relevant information must be recorded on the subject’s eCRF.  
 Treatment Compliance   
Study personnel at the site should monitor po test article compliance at each study visit by 
compa ring the returned test article with the dosing information reported by the subject.  
Compliance and any unresolved discrepancies will be documented in the source document and on the drug inventory record.  The test article eCRF should reflect the reconcile d dosing 
information provided by the subject. 
 Packaging and Labeling  
The investigational test article, omadacycline, will be packaged by the sponsor and supplied to the inves tigator.  This includes:  omadacycline 150- mg oral tablets  and matching placebo.  
The comparator test article, nitrofurantoin, will be packaged by the sponsor and supplied to the investigator.  This includes:  nitrofurantoin 100- mg oral capsules and matching placebo. 
 Storage and Accountability  
Test article must be received at the study site by a designated person, handled and stored 
safely and properly, and kept in a secured location to which only the investigator and designated staff have access.  Upon receipt, the test article should be stored according to the instructions specified on  the drug labels.  Storage conditions must be adequately monitored 
and appropriate temperature logs maintained as source data.  
The designated study personnel must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and 
dispensing of test article s in the study specific medication accountability ledger .  Test article 
supplies are completely blinded.  Subjects will be asked to return all unused test article and packaging at each visit and at the end of the study, last study visit or at the time of test article discontinuation. Monitoring of oral medication accountability will be performed by the field 
monitor during site visits and at the completion of the study.   
 Investigational Product Retention at Study Site  
At the conclusion of the study, and as appropriate during the course of the study, with instruction from the sponsor, the designated study personnel will destroy on site  as permitted 
by local site operating procedures, or return all unused test article s, packaging, and drug 
labels.  Destruction/return of all test article will be documented and maintained in the site files.

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 39 of 70 8 STUDY PROCEDURES  
Written , signed , and dated informed consent will be obtained before any study- related 
procedures have been performed.  Upon signing the informed consent, the subject will then 
be assigned a study subject number.  A dverse events must be recorded from the time the ICF 
is signed.  Subjects who have been pre-screened on the telephone but who do not sign an ICF 
will not be assigned a subject number.  The investigator will maintain a subject master list to 
document every subject who has signed an ICF .  A copy of this list should be retained in the 
investigator’s study files.  
 Informed Consent  
The investigator will provide for the protection of the subjects by following all applicable 
regulations.  These regulations are available upon request from the sponsor.  The ICF must be reviewed by the sponsor and approved by the IRB/IEC/REB. 
Before any procedures specified in the protocol are performed, a subject must: 
• Be informed of all pertinent aspects of the study and all elements of informed consent  
• Be given time to ask questions and time to consider the decision to participate 
• Voluntarily agree to participate in the study  
• Sign and date  an IRB/IEC/REB approved ICF  
 Subject Demographics/Other Baseline Characteristics  
Subject demographic and Baseline characteristic data to be collected on all subjects include:  
date of birth, gender, and race/ethnicity.   
 Medical History  
The investigator wi ll perform a comprehensive history at the Screening visit.   Significant 
medical history (at any  time)  and any medical history  within the past 6 months including 
ongoing medical conditions at  the time of  signing of the ICF will be recorded .  In addition, 
subject history of prior UTIs will be captured.   Where possible, diagnoses are to be recorded.  
Any event or change in the subject’s condition or health status occurring after signing the 
ICF will be reported as an AE . 
 Physical Examination  
At Screening, a full physical examination will include the examination of general appearance, skin, neck (including thyroid), eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities, and vascular and neurological systems.  If indicated based on medical history and/or symptoms, rectal, external genitalia, breast, and/or pelvic exams may 
be performed.   
Information for all physical examinations must be included in the source documentation at 
the study site.  Significant and relevant findings that are present prior to the start of test

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 40 of 70 article must be included in the subject’s eCRF.  Relevant findings that are present prior to the 
start of test article must be included in the relevant medical history/current medical 
conditions screen on the subject’s eCRF.  Significant findings made after the start of test article which meet the definition of an AE must be recorded on the Adverse Event screen of the subject’s eCRF.  
 Vital Signs  
Vital signs includ e blood pressure ( BP), heart rate, body te mperature, height and body 
weight. 
• Blood pressure and heart  rate should be measured within 30 min before, and 
approximately (± 15 minutes) 1 hour after and 3 hours after the completion of the first 
dose.  
The subject’s vital signs should be captured after at least 5  minutes (+ 5 min utes) of rest 
while in a non- standing position (supine or semi -recumbent, head of bed from 0° to 90°).  
Subsequent vital sign measurements should be captured in the same non-standing position. 
Systolic and diastolic BP will be me asured using an automated validated device, with an 
appropriately sized cuff.  Heart rate will be measured using an automated validated device, when available.  If not 
available, heart rate  will be measured manually.  
Temperature will be obtained using an electronic (rapid reading) device whenever possible.   
 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Clinical laboratory  tests to be performed include hematology (including coagulation), serum  
chemist ry, urine or serum pregnancy assessments, and urinalysis.  The Central Laboratory 
will be used for safety analysis of all specimens collected.  Details on the collection tubes 
and containers, shipment of samples and reporting of results by the Central Laboratory are 
provided to investigators in the Central Laboratory Manual.  
Because subject enro llment will not permit using Central Laboratory results to assess a 
subject’s meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria, it is expected that local laboratory testing will 
be used in circumstances where this testing is needed to assess a subject’s WBC count or differential, serum transaminase or bilirubin levels, serum creatinine or pregnancy testing .  
The total volume of blood collected from each subject will be approximately 4 – 14 mL per visit, or approximately 48 mL (3 tablespoons) over the course of the study. 
8.6.1 Central Laboratory Parameters 
Clinical laboratory tests  will include the following:

8.6.2 Local Laboratory Parameters  
 Pregnancy Assessments  
All subjects will have a local urine or serum pregnancy test at the site at the Screening and 
PTE visits.  Urine pregnancy test kits will be provided by the sponsor through the Central 
Laboratory.  If a positive urine or serum  pregnancy test result is obtained at the site during 
Screening , the subject is not to be randomized.  A serum sample for Serum β -human 
chorionic gonadotropin (β- hCG) testing will be collected at the Screening visit and sent to the 
Central Laboratory for confirmation  of the local urine or serum pregnancy test results  as well 
as at EOT .  If a positive β-hCG result is reported by the Central Laboratory after a subject  is 
enrolled, test article administration should be discontinued (see Section  8.15.6).

 Urine Culture and Dipstick Tests  
A clean -catch midstream urine sample should be collected and immediately sent to the local 
microbiology laboratory for microscopic examination and culture.  The  sample should be 
analyzed for pyuria microscopically (WBC count greater than 10/μL in unspun urine or 
greater than or equal to  10 per high power field in spun urine) or by urine dipstick test for 
leukocyte esterase.   Results will be recorded on the eCRF.   
Quantitative urine culture by appropriate methods should be performed using a calibrated loop that would identify bacteria at a lower limit of 1.0 × 10
3 colony forming units 
(CFU)/mL.  A study -qualifying pretreatment Baseline culture must grow at least 1 and no 
more than 2 bacterial isolates at ≥ 1.0 × 105 CFU/mL each.  If more than two bacterial 
isolates are identified, the culture will be considered contaminated.  In general, at any visit , 
bacteria identified at 1.0  × 105 CFU/mL or greater should be considered a bacterial pathogen 
(probability of true pathogen is greater than probability of contamination).  At any visit after Screening , a pathogen the same species as the Baseline pathogen with a CFU count of 
≥ 1 × 10
4 CFU/mL should be considered a persisting pathogen.  At any visit after Screening, 
any culture  with a CFU count of < 104 CFU/mL should be considered a negative culture. 
Culture results are to include identification of all pathogens to the level of genus and species.  
In vitro  antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates to antimicrobial drugs that may be 
used to treat UTIs can be performed locally using a standard method chosen by the laboratory.  
All bacterial isolates that grow ≥ 10
3 CFU/mL (whe ther at Baseline or post- Baseline ) 
identified by the local laboratory from urine culture  will be submitted to the Central 
Laboratory for verification of genus and species and for standardized MIC testing performed 
for omadacycline, nitrofurantoin  and a pan el of other  antibiotics.  In the event that local 
laboratory genus and species identification are not consistent with Central Laboratory results, a back -up isolate should be sent to the Central Laboratory.   
Details concerning cultures and shipment to the Central Laboratory will be provided in a 
Clinical Microbiology Laboratory Manual.  
The investigator may use the culture and susceptibility results from the local microbiology 
laboratory to help guide therapy; however, decisions to continue or discontinue t est article 
should be based on clinical response rather than susceptibility results (as omadacycline susceptibility testing is not available at the local site).  The decision to continue or 
discontinue study treatment should be based on the subject's clini cal course and the 
investigator’s clinical judgment.  The rationale for this decision should be recorded in source 
documents.

 Subject Assessment of UTI Signs and Symptoms Severity  
The subject will record her assessment of UTI signs and symptoms severity using the UTI 
Symptoms Assessment  questionnaire (UTISA) .  The UTISA is a 14-item instrument asking 
about the severity and bothersomeness of seven key uUTI symptoms, and applies a 4-point 
scale:   No Symptoms , Mild, Moderate, Severe. 
The investigator must review subject’s responses to the questionnaire and record any A Es as 
appropr
iate ( please refer to secti
on 8.15.5).  
 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Instructions will be provided to sites with detailed information on sample collection, 
handling, and shipment requirements.  All samples will be given a unique identifier.  The  
exact clock time of dosing, as well as actual sample collection date and time will be entered on the e CRF.  
8.9.1 PK Blood Collection and Processing  
Blood samples will be collected and analyzed for omadacycline concentration at the following time s:  
• Day 1:  2 hours a fter the first odd -numbered dose 
• Day 5:  During study visit  
8.9.2 PK Urine  Collection and Processing  
Urine will be collected and analyzed for omadacycline concentration at the following times:  
• Day 3 :  During study visit 
• Day 5 :  During study visit 
8.9.3 Storing  and Shipping of PK Samples  
After all PK samples from a single subject have been collected and frozen at - 20°C or 
colder , the primary samples from each time point can be batched together and carefully 
packaged and shipped frozen at - 20°C or colder to the central laboratory designated by the 
sponsor.  Samples are to be shipped with sufficient dry ice to remain frozen during overnight transit.  For each subject and time point, the remaining stored aliquots will be retained on site at - 20°C or colder until released or requested by the sponsor. 
 Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward, undesired, or unplanned event in the form of signs, symptoms, disease, or laboratory or physiologic observations occurring in a person given a test article or in a clinical study.  The event does not need to be causally related to the test article or clinical study.  An AE includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
Omadacycline   Paratek Pharmaceuticals, LLC

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 45 of 70 • Any clinically significant worsening of a preexisting condition. 
• An AE occurring from overdose of a test article,  whether accidental or intentional.  
Overdose is a dose greater than that specified in the protocol.  
• An AE occurring from abuse (eg, use for nonclinical reasons) of a test article  
• An AE that has been associated with the discontinuation of the use of a test article  
 Serious Adverse Events  
A Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) is an AE that:  
• Results in death 
• Is life-threatening (see below)  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation of an existin g hospitalization (see below) 
• Results in a persistent or significant disab ility or incapacity (see below)  
• Results in a con genital anomaly or birth defect 
• Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, 
or require hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any one (1) of the outcomes listed  above in this definition.  
Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Life-threatening refers to immediate risk of death as the event occurred per the reporter.  A 
life-threatening exp erience does not include an experience, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death, but as it actually occurred, did not create an immediate risk of death.  For example, hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening, even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal.  Similarly, an allergic reaction resulting in angioedema of the face would not be life-threatening, even though angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm, or 
anaphylaxis can be fatal.  
Hospitalization is official admission to a hospital.  Hospitalization or prolongation of a hospitalization constitutes criteria for an AE to be serious; however, it is not in itself considered an SAE.  In absence of an AE, a h ospitalization or prolongation of a 
hospitalization should not be reported as an SAE by the participating i nvestigator.  This is the 
case in the following situations: 
• The hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is needed for a procedure required  
by the protocol 
• The hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is part of a routine procedure 
followed by the center (eg, stent removal after surgery).  This should be recorded in the study file. 
• A hospitalization  for a preexisting condition that has not worsened

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 46 of 70 Disability is defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions. 
If there is any doubt about whether the information constitutes an SAE, the information is 
treated as an SAE.  
 Other Reportable Infor mation   
Certain information, although not considered an SAE, must be recorded, reported, and followed up as indicated for an SAE.  This includes: 
• Pregnancy exposure to a test article :  If a pregnancy is confirmed, use of the test article 
must be discontinued immediately.  Information about pregnancy exposure includes the 
entire course of pregnancy and delivery, and perinatal and neonatal outcomes, even if there are no abnormal findings.   
• Lactation  exposure to a test article with or without an AE  
• Overdose of a test article as specified in this protocol with or without an AE  
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a tes t article with or without an AE  
 
 Overdose  
Any administration of omadacycline of g reater than 1350 mg within a 24 -hour period will be 
an overdose, regardless of whether the overdose is intentional or accidental, it is a reportable event and the sponsor must be notified within 1 business day .  Any administration of great er 
than 300 mg of nitrofurantoin within a 24-hour period will be an overdose.  In the event that 
a study subject takes an overdose of test article, the investigator may obtain the subject’s 
treatment assignment by contacting the IxRS.  I nteractive Response S ystem  will also provide 
a confirmation report of the drug assignment to site personnel.  The site personnel will retain this confirmation report.   In the case of a potential overdose, the subject should maintain a 
high level of fluid intake to promote ur inary excretion ( as recommended  in the nitrofurantoin 
USPI
11). 
The physician managing the overdose may order any test he/she thinks is necessary to manage the subject properly. 
 Medication Errors  
Medication errors are the result of administration or consumption of the wrong product, by the wrong subject, at the wrong time, and/or by the wrong administration route, due to human error.   
Medication err ors include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• The administration  and/or consumption of test article that has n ot been assigned to the 
subject 
• Administration  of expired test article

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 47 of 70 All AEs and SAEs must be handled as specified in this protocol whether or not they are 
associated with a medication error.  A medication error associated with an SAE (including overdose, inadvertent exposure, and/or accidental exposure) will be reported wi th the SAE on 
the SAE Report  Form.  All other medication errors will be reported by  e-mailing the Clinical 
Test Article Error Incident Report Form as indicated in the Emergency Contacts (see 
Section  2). 
 Recording and Reporting  
A subject’s AEs and SAEs will be recorded and reported from the signing of the ICF to the time of the Final Follow -up assessment.  The investigat or must instruct the subject to report 
AEs and SAEs during this time period.  Reports of death within 30 days after  the last contact 
with the subject will be reported to the sponsor and additional information relative to the cause of death will be sought and documented.   
All AEs and SAEs must be recorded on source documents.  All AEs and SAEs for subjects 
who receive a treatment assignment will be recorded in the eCRFs.  
The investigator must follow- up as medically necessary on all AEs and SAEs until the events 
have subsided, the condition has returned to Baseline, or in case of permanent impairment, until the condition stabilizes.  
AEs should be based on the signs or symptoms detected during the physical examination and on clinical evaluation of the subject.  In addition to the information obtained from those sources, the subject should be asked the following nonspecific question :  "How have you 
been feeling since your last visit?"  Whenever possible, AEs should be reported as a 
diagnosis rather than individual signs and symptoms.  If a definitive diagnosis is not possible, the individual signs and symptoms should be recorded using standard medical terminology. 
If an AE requires a surgical or diagnostic procedure, the illness leading to the procedure should be recorded as the AE, not the procedure itself.  
Death should be recorded in the eCRF as an outcome of an AE.  Any unanticipated risks to the subjects must be reported promptly to the IRB/IEC/REB.   
8.15.1 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
All SAEs and follow-up information must be reported within 1 business day or 24 hours as required by local regulations by emailing  a completed SAE Report to the email address 
below.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) contact information: 
E-Mail:

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 48 of 70 8.15.2 Assessment of Relatedness 
The investigator will assess causality (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that test 
article  caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs.  The relationship will be characterized using 
the following classificati on: 
• Not related:  This relationship suggests that there is no association between test article  
and the reported  event.  The event can be explained by other factors such as an 
underlying medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident, and no plausible temporal or biologic relationship exists between test article and the event.  
• Related:   This relationship suggests that a definite causal relationship exists between test 
article  administration  and the AE, or there is a reasonable possibility that the event  was 
caused by the study medication, and other conditions (concurrent illness, 
progression/expression of disease state, or concurrent medication reaction) do not appear 
to explain the event. 
AEs and SAEs  also will be assessed for their potential relationsh ip to the protocol.  A 
protocol- related adverse event is one that is not related to the test article, but is considered by 
the investigator or the medical monitor (or designee) to be related to the research conditions, 
ie, related to the fact that a subjec t is participating in the study.  For example, a protocol-
related AE may be an untoward event related to a medical procedure required by the protocol. 
8.15.3 Assessment of Severity  
The severity (or intensity) of an AE will be classified using the following criter ia: 
• Mild:  These events are usually transient, require minimal or no treatment, and do not 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate:  These events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures.  Moderate events may cause some interference with normal 
functioning but pose no significant or permanent risk of harm. 
• Severe:  These events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment.  Severe events are usually incapacitating. 
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented as a new event to allow an 
assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intensity to be performed.  
8.15.4 Laboratory Findings 
Protocol- defined safety laboratory test results wil l be analyzed as part of specific laboratory 
safety analyses.  Additional laboratory test results at other time points may be available to the investigator as part of standard clinical practice.  Throughout the study, laboratory -related 
abnormalities should be recorded as AEs only if considered clinically significant, outside the range of expected values given the subject’s Baseline assessments and clinical course, and not known to be part of another AE diagnosis.

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 49 of 70 8.15.5 Worsening or Progression of Disease Under S tudy  
Worsening or progression of the qualifying UTI should be recorded as a clinical failure (as 
part of the efficacy assessment), rather than an AE, unless the worsening/progression also meets the criteria for a serious AE (in which case the event also sh ould be reported as an 
SAE).   In contrast, any new  or secondary  infections that the investigator considers to be 
distinct from the qualifying UTI should be reported as AEs in all cases, whether non -serious 
or serious. 
8.15.6 Pregnancies  
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy in a subject on test article must be reported to the sponsor within 1 business day of learning of its occurrence.  Test article should be discontinued immediately and the pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form and reported by the investigator to the sponsor.  Pregnancy follow-up should be recorded on the same form and 
should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the test article of any pregnancy outcome.  Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report Form.  
 Concomitant Medication Assessments  
The investigator should instruct the subject to notify the study site about any new medications she takes aft er the start of the test article.   
All prescription medications, OTC drugs, and recreational drugs taken within the timeframe defined in the entry criteria  prior to the start of the study and during the study, must be 
recorded on the Prior/Concomitant Medications page of the e CRF.   Medication entries 
should be specific to trade name, the single d ose and unit, the frequency and route of 
administration, the start and discontinuation date s, and the reason for therapy. 
 Subject Discontinuation or Withdrawal  
Reasons why a subject may discontinue or be withdrawn from the study include, but are not limite d to, AE, lost to follow up, withdrawal by subject, physician decision, death, and other 
(specify reason eg, subject non-compliance or study termination by the sponsor) .  Subjects 
may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason at any time.  Subject s are considered 
withdrawn from the study if they state an intention to withdraw, or fail to return for visits, or become lost to follow up for any other reason.  If premature withdrawal from the study occurs for any reason, the investigator should determi ne the primary reason for a subject’s 
premature withdrawal from the study and record this information on the eCRF.  
Subjects who discontinue study treatment should not be considered withdrawn from the study (unless the subject withdraws informed consent).  The date and primary reason for

 Study Completion and Post -Study Test Article  
A subject will have successfully completed the study after the planned test article regimen 
has been administered, and all assessments and visits have been performed  up through the 
final follow -up assessment  (Final Follow -up).  The study will be completed when the last 
subject has either discontinued or completed the Final Follow-up assessment .   
No long- term follow -up of subjects is planned, with the exception of pregnancies, as 
described in  Section 8.15.6, and SAEs described in Section 8.15.1. 
Sites will be notified by either the Sponsor or IxRS to stop enrollment when the desired 
number of treated subjects have been enrolled.  Subjects already consented , but not yet 
randomized wi ll be allowed to continue Screening  procedures. 
Upon study completion, the i nvestigator will provide the sponsor, IRB/IEC/REB, and 
regulatory agency with final reports and summaries as required by regulations.  The investigator must submit a written report to the sponsor and the IRB/IEC/REB within 
3 months after the completion or termination of the study. 
 Study Suspension or Termination  
The sponsor may suspend or terminate the study or part of the study at any time for any 
reason.  Should this be necessary,  subjects should be seen as soon as possible and treated as 
described in  Section 9.3 for prematurely withdrawn subjects.  The investigator may be 
informed of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subject’s interests.  The investigator will be 
responsible for informing Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and/or Ethics Committees (ECs) of the early termination of the study. 
If the investigator suspends or prematurely  terminates the ir participation in the  study, the 
investigator will promptly inform the sponsor and the IRB/IEC/REB and provide them with a 
detailed writ ten explanation.  Su bjects should be seen as soon as possible and treated as 
described in Section 9.3 for pre maturely withdrawn subjects.  The investigator will also  
return all test article s, containers , and other study materials to the sponsor.

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 57 of 70 12 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
 General Considerations  
All analyses of data for this study will comply with International Conference on 
Harmonisation  (ICH)  of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for 
Human Use (ICH-E9) and the sponsor’s guidance documents and standards.  Statistical analyses will be performed using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS
®). 
A Statistical A nalysis Plan incorporating the sections below and with mock table, figure, and 
listing (TFL) shells will be prepared, approved and finalized by the sponsor prior to database lock.  This plan will define populations for analysis, outline all data handling conventions, and specify statistical methods to be used for analysis of safety and efficacy.  Analyses of PK 
endpoints will be described in a separate analysis plan.  
Descriptive statistics, including the numbers and percentages for categorical variables, an d 
the numbers, means, standard deviation (SD), medians, minimums, and maximums for continuous variables will be provided.  Exploratory analyses may also be performed.  Listings of individual subject’s data will be produced. 
All eCRFs must be completed, entered and checked; all safety laboratory results must have 
been reported; all AEs must have been fully characterized (eg , relationship to test article 
determined) and coded; and all queries must have been resolved prior to database lock and unblinding.  Det ermination of inclusion in the analysis populations, characterization of 
protocol deviations as major/minor and final approval of the SAP will also be completed prior to database lock. 
 Determination of Sample  Size 
Enrollment of a total of approximately 225 subjects is planned.  The Bayesian posterior probability that the clinical success rate at the PTE Visit is within 0.10 of that of the nitrofurantoin group will be estimated for each omadacycline dose group.  The target probability is 0.80.  If the true u nderlying clinical success rates for the nitrofurantoin and 
omadacycline dose groups are 0.82, then the sample size of N = 50 per treatment has approximately 79% power/probability to yield the target probability (N  = 53 per treatment for 
80% power).  The sample size may be increased for a particular omadacycline dose group by changing the randomization ratio and/or dropping a dose group to achieve improved power/probability of achieving the target probability that clinical s uccess rates for a dose 
group is within 0.10 of that of the nitrofurantoin group.  If required to improve the precision of the interim or projected final analyses estimates of response rates or posterior probabilities, sample size may be increased  to a maximum sample size provided in the SAP . 
 Analysis Populations  
The following subject analysis populations have been defined: 
• Intent- to-treat (ITT):  all randomized subjects. 
Omadacycline   Paratek Pharmaceuticals, LLC 
PTK0796 -UUTI -17201 -Version 3.0 FINAL; 18-FEB- 2019 IND # 75,928 IND # 73,431 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 58 of 70 • Safety :  all randomized subjects who receive any amount of test article.   
• The microbiological ITT  (micro -ITT) population will consist of subject s in the ITT 
population who have a study-qualifying pre- treatment Baseline urine culture with 1  or 2 
uropathogens at ≥ 105 CFU/mL .   
• The clinically evaluable (CE) population will consist of all ITT subjects who received 
test article, have a qualifying infection, an assessment of outcome, and meet all other 
evaluability criteria detailed in the SAP  
• The microbiologically evaluable (ME) population will include subjects in the CE 
population who have a study-qualifying pre- treatment Baseline urine culture with 1 or 
2 uropathogens at ≥ 105 CFU/mL .   
 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics (including age, ethnicity and race) and Baseline characteristics will be 
summarized in the ITT population by treatment group.  
Descriptive statistics of the duration of test article treatment will be provided by treatment 
group.  The number and percentage of subjects who prematurely discontinued test article and the reason for discontinuation and the number and percentage of subjects prematurely discontinuing the study and the primary reason for discontinuation will be presented by treatment group. 
 Primary  Endpoint(s)  
12.5.1 Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the Investigator’ s assessment of clinical success at PTE in 
the ITT population.  The number and percentage of subjects with an Investigator’ s 
assessment of clinical success, clinical failure and indeterminate response at the PTE visit 
will be determined by treatment group in the ITT population.  Exact 95% confidence intervals will be determined for the point estimates of the clinical success rates in each 
treatment group. 
A comparison  of the clinical success rate at the PTE Visit between each omadacycline dose 
group and the  nitrofurantoin group will be conducted using a beta distribution with an 
uninformative Bayesian prior distribution.   Additional analyses on the primary efficacy 
endpoint will be performed using Bayesian modeling.  Details are described in SAP.  
 Secondary Endpoint(s)  
12.6.1 Safety Endpoint(s)  
All safety analyses will utilize the Safety population.  Summary tables will be provided for 
all treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs).  A TEAE is defined as an AE with a start 
date and time on or after the first dose of test article.  AEs will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and will be summarized by presenting the number and percentage of subjects having each TEAE for each treatment group by system

relationship to test article.   Additional tabulations will provide summaries by SOC and PT of 
subjects experiencing SAEs and TEAEs judge d to be related to test article . 
The following variables will be analyzed descriptively  by treatment group in the Safety 
population: 
• Vital signs (systolic and diastolic BP, heart  rate, body temperature), including change 
from Baseline by visit and time point measured 
• Clinically notable vital signs (meeting predefined criteria as specified in the SAP) by visit 
and time point measured 
• Laboratory parameters, including change from Baseline by visit 
• Clinically  notable laboratory parameters (meeting predefined criteria s specified in the 
SAP) by visit  
12.6.2 Efficacy Endpoint(s) 
The number and percentage of subjects with an Investigator’ s assessment of clinical success, 
clinical failure and indeterminate response at the EOT Visit (ITT and CE populations; by 
definition subjects in the CE population cannot have an indeterminate response) and PTE 
visit (CE  and micro -ITT population) will be determined by treatment group.  Exact 95% 
confidence intervals will be determined for the point estimates of the clinical success rates in 
each treatment group. 
The number and percentage of subjects with a  microbiologic failure, success and 
indeterminate response at the EOT and PTE Visits (micro -ITT and ME populations; by 
definition subjects in the ME population cannot have an indeterminate response) will be 
determined by treatment group.  Exact 95% c onfidence intervals will be determined for the 
point estimates of the microbiologic success rates in each treatment group. 
 Interim  Analysis  
This is an adaptive dose-response finding study. Bayesian analysis will be conducted when 
primary efficacy endpoint data (investigator assessment of clinical response at PTE) is 
available from 40, 80 and 100 subjects in order to: 
• Determine  if omadacycline dose group(s) that can be dropped from the trial, or 
• Modify the randomization ratios among the omadacycline dose groups to improve the 
precision of the selected dose group comparison of clinical success to that of the nitrofurantoin  group. 
Additional analyses may be carried out for these same two purposes.  Response criteria are targeted toward estimating the probability that the clinical success rate (proportion of subjects) for each dose group is within 10% of that of the nitrofurantoin group.  If at the specified analysis time point, that probability falls below 30% for a particular omadacycline 
dose group, r ecruitment for that omadacycline dose group may be stopped or curtailed by 
changing the randomization ratio.  If that probability exceeds 80% for a particular

randomization ratio to improve the precision of the estimate.    
Results from the Bayesian analysis will be reviewed by a DMC to determine if enrollment in 
any omadacycline treatment arms should be stopped or modified.  Modifications to 
omadacycline dosing regime ns/treatment arms may also be based on safety and tolerability.  
A DMC charter describing the composition of the DMC, roles and responsibilities, and statistical parameters will be developed and finalized prior to the first data review.  
 Data Monitoring Committee  
A DMC will provide ongoing monitoring of data.  Th e charter for the D MC will clearly 
outline membership, all roles, responsibilities, and decision-making criteria.  This will 
include a detailed description of the manner in which security and blinding of the data for the study management team  will be maintained, in addition to the procedures that ensure the 
independence and objectivity of t he DMC’s activities.  As the DMC will be reviewing data 
for this study, it may require reports indicating treatment assignment to assist in clinical interpretation of its findings.  Therefore, the D MC charter will provide a detailed explanation 
of the processes by which the DMC will obtain the information necessary for its operation that will not prejudice or create any potential source of bias in the conduct of the study.

 Direct Access, Data Handling, and Record Keeping  
13.5.1 Investigator 
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC/REB review, and 
regulatory inspections by providing direct access to source data and documents. 
All information will be recorded on source documents.  All requi red data will be recorded in 
the eCRFs.  
If an investigator retires, relocates, or otherwise withdraws from conducting the study, the 
investigator must notify the sponsor to agree upon an accep table storage solution.  
Regulatory agencies will be notified with the appropriate documentation. An updated form 1572 will be filed with the sponsor for any changes in the study personnel 
reported in the current form 1572. 
13.5.2 Sponsor  
The data is entered into an electronic database via eCRFs.  The Sponsor Medical Monitor 
reviews the data for safety information.  The data is reviewed for completeness and logical consistency.  Automated validation checks identify missing data, out-of-range data, and other data inconsistencies.  The central safety and microbiology data will  be processed 
electronically.  Requests for data clarification are forwarded to the investigative site for resolution.  
 Protocol Adherence  
13.6.1 Violations/ Deviations 
Investigators will agree to  apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations.  Under no 
circumst ances should the investigator contact the sponsor or its agents to request approval of 
a prospective protocol deviation, as no authorized deviations are permitted.  If the 
investigator feels a protocol deviation would improve the conduct of the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment is agreed upon by the sponsor and approved by the IRB/IEC/REB, it cannot be implemented.  All significant protocol deviations will be recorded and reported in the clinical study report (CSR).  
13.6.2 Protocol Amendments  
Any change or addition to the protocol can only be made in a written protocol amendment that must be approved by the sponsor, Health Authorities where required, and the IRB/IEC/REB.   Only amendments that are required for subject safety may be implemented 
prior to IRB/IEC/REB approval.  Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal protocol

c To be conducted on the day  of or within the 2 days following the last dose of test article.  This evaluation s hould also be conducted for any prematurely 
withdrawn subject on the day treatment ends . 
d Written and signed ICF must be obtained before any study- related assessment is perf ormed.  
e Subject assessment of UTI signs and symptoms severity will be collected daily through EOT  (including self -completion by subject at home on Days 2, 4 and 
6), at PTE and at Final Follow -up via the UTISA questionnaire . 
f Treatments that have been administered within the 7  days prior to the date of signing the ICF or during the Screening phase will be recorded in the eCRF.  All 
medications and significant non- drug therapies administered after the first dose of test article must be recorded in the eC RF. 
g A clean -catch, midstream urine sample should be collected and immediately sent to the local microbiology laboratory for microscopic evaluation and culture.  
Quantitative urine culture by appropriate methods should be performed using a calibrated loop that would identify bacteria at a lower limit of 103 CFU/mL.   
White blood cell counts should be measured by microscopy from spun or unspun urine or dipstick analysis for leukocyte esterase  and nitrites.  The 
statement “or microscopic evaluation for white blo od cells” refers to the alternative method to assess for the presence of pyuria (inclusion #4), but the 
dipstick assessment is required regardless of how inclusion is assessed.

are to be sent from the local lab to the Central Lab  for further analysis.  
i A full physical examination will be completed at Screening, thereafter only changes from Screening  assess ment s should be recorded as AEs in the eCRFs.  
j BP and heart rate should be measured within 30 min before, and approximately 1 hour  (± 15 minutes) after and 3 hours  (± 15 minutes) after the 
completion of the first dose on Day  1.   
k Hematology includes coagulation.

m All subjects will have blood collected for a serum β -hCG pregnancy test at the Cent ral Laboratory at the Screening and  EOT visits .   
n A subject’s AEs and SAEs will be recorded and reported from signing of the ICF to the Final Follow -up assessment.  
o Subjects should receive their first dose of test article within 4 hours after randomization in the office with a light meal . All other doses can be administered 
by subject at home . Beginning with Dose 3, all consecutive odd numbered doses of the omadacycline tablets and placebo tablets resembling omadacycline 
should be taken in a fasted state. Beginning with Dose 4, all even numbered doses should be taken approximately 2 hours after a light meal.   The total 
duration of po test article therapy for all subjects will be 7 days.  At the EOT visit , subjects will return any remaining unused po test article and site staff will 
perform accountability.  
p Dose 2 can be taken a minimum of 8 hours and up to 12 hours after Dose 1.  Dose 3 should be taken a minimum of 8 hours after Dose 2.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
Product Name: Omadacycline (PTK 0796) 
Study Number: PTK0796-UUTI-17201 
Date and Version:  Version 3, 18 February 2019 
Change  Rationale for Change  
Addition of 450mg BID omadacycline  
treatment arm, to be dosed 
approximately 2 hours after a light 
meal.  Based on the pharmacokinetic, clinical, and safety 
data, the 450mg twice daily dose will increase 
urinary concentration, may provide additional 
clinical and microbiologic benefit while maintaining 
the safety profile observed with daily dosing. Refer 
to the protocol for additional/detailed rationale 
supporting this change.  
Increased sample size to approximately 
225 subjects (previously approximately 
200 subjects).  The approximate total  enrollment will increase to 
accommodate the addition of the 450mg BID 
treatment arm. The initial goal was to enroll at least 
n=53 subjects per arm for final analysis. Sample size 
may be increased for a particular omadacycline dose 
group, based on recommen dations from DMC to 
change randomization ratio and/or drop a dose group 
to achieve improved power/probability of achieving 
the target probability that clinical success rates for a 
dose group is within 0.10 of that of the nitrofurantoin 
group.   
Addition o f statement regarding 
omadacycline approved uses  Omadacycline has recently been FDA -approved for 
CABP & ABSSSI (since original version of protocol 
was written)  
Increased the approximate duration of 
the study to 24 months  Due to enrollment  progressing slower than originally 
projected and the addition of 25 subjects to overall 
sample size  
Indicated that additional analyses on 
the primary efficacy endpoint will be 
performed using Bayesian modeling.  An additional sensitivity analysis will be  conducted 
on the efficacy endpoints to ensure improved 
interpretation and precision of estimates of efficac y 
analysis for dose selection.

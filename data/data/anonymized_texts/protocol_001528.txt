Stopping rule 1: The first early stopping rule applies to all patients by 
applying the Simon’s optimal two -stage design. In the first stage, we 
will enroll 21 evaluable patients. If 0 or 1 of the first 21 patients 
achieve RECIST response (PR or CR), the study will terminate.  If at 
least 2 of the first 21 evaluable patients achieve RESCIST response 
(PR or CR), an additional 20 patients will be enrolled.  If at the end of

the second stage, at least 5 out of 41 patients achie ve RECIST 
response, the treatment will be considered acceptable for further 
testing.  This design has a 3.9% chance of accepting the treatment for 
further testing if the true response rate is ≤ 5% (type 1 error = 0.046), 
and 90% power (type 2 error = 0.1) of accepting the treatment for 
further testing if the true response rate is at least 20%.  The maximal 
accrual will be 41 evaluable patients.  The probability of early 
termination is 72% under the null hypothesis.

The first early stopping rule applies to all patients by applying the 
Simon’s optimal two -stage design. In the first stage, we will enroll 21 
evaluable patients. If 0 or 1 of the first 21 patients achieve RECIST 
response (PR or CR), the study will terminate.  If at least 2 of the first 
21 evaluable patients achieve RESCIST response (PR or CR), an 
additional 20 patients will be enrolled.  If at the end of the second 
stage, at least 5 out of 41 patients achieve RECIST response, the 
treatment will be considered acceptable for further testing.  This 
design has a 4.6% chanc e of accepting the treatment for further testing 
if the true response rate is ≤ 5% (type 1 error = 0.046), and 85% power 
(type 2 error = 0.1 5) of accepting the treatment for further testing if the 
true response rate is at least 20%.  The maximal accrual wi ll be 41 
evaluable patients.  The probability of early termination is 72% under 
the null hypothesis.  
 
RATIONALE:  
Given the inclusion of more heavily pretreated patients, the response 
rate under the null hypothesis was reduced, and the response rate 
under t he alternative hypothesis was simultaneously adjusted (from 
0.21 to 0.2) for simplicity.  Type I and type II error rates were 
simultaneously adjusted (from 0.084 to 0.05 and from 0.1 to 0.15, 
respectively) based on our own recent work regarding the predict ive 
value of phase II studies, demonstrating that smaller type I errors with 
compensatory increases in type II error rates result in phase II designs 
more likely to predict for eventual drug efficacy and approval.  These 
changes resulted in changes to the total number of patients anticipated 
to be accrued, resulting in new calculations for the imaging parameter 
power calculations.

1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Primary Objectives  
 
1.1.1 Estimate the objective response rate (RR) of ziv-aflibercept  among patients with 
advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors ( NET )s according to RECIST 1.1  
 
1.1.2 Test the following hypothes es: that baseline perfusion CT parameters can predict which 
patients with advanced pNETs will respond to treatment  with ziv-aflibercept . 
Specifically:  
a. Pancreatic NETs with high baseline blood volume (BV > 5.25 ml/100gram ) measured 
by pCT will have a higher response rate to therapy with  ziv-aflibercept  than those 
with low baseline BV (BV ≤ 5.25ml/100gram ).  
b. Pancreatic NETs with high baseline permeability surface (PS > 25 
ml/minute/100gram ) measured by pCT will have a higher response rate to therapy 
with ziv-aflibercept  than those with low baseline PS (PS ≤ 25 ml/minute/100gram ). 
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
1.2.1 Estimate progressi on free survival (PFS) duration among patients treated with  ziv-
aflibercept   
 
1.2.2 Evaluate the relationship between response rate and baselin e BV and between response 
rate and baseline PS  
 
1.3 Exploratory  Objectives  
 
1.3.1 Determine whether post -treatment changes in BV  expressed as relative change from 
baseline correlate with response to  ziv-aflibercept  
1.3.2 Determine whether post -treatment tumor blood flow ( BF) (absolute measurement) 
correlate s with response to  ziv-aflibercept  
1.3.3 Determine whether post -treatment changes in BF  and, BV , expressed as relative change 
from baseline , correlate with relative change in sum of tumor diameters (RECIST 
1.1measurements)  
1.3.4 Determine the effect of  ziv-aflibercept  therapy on post -treatment blood flow (BF), BV, 
mean transit time (MTT), and PS at  4 weeks after treatment  
1.3.5 Evaluate the changes in tumor perfusion parameters at time of progression  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Pancreatic NETs  
 
Pancreatic NETs  are low - to intermediate -grade neoplasms that are thought to arise from the 
pancreatic islets. Also known as pa ncreatic  endocrine tumors  and, islet cell tumors , or pancreatic 
carcinoid, P NETs account for a minority of pancreatic neoplasms and can be either functional or 
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
7 nonfunctional. The f unctional status of pancreatic NET s is generally influenced by several 
facto rs, including disease bulk, stage, secretory status , and whether the peptide secreted is intact 
and causes distinct clinical symptoms. Pancreatic NET s are generally considered functional if 
they are associated with a hormonal syndrome. Those pancreatic NET s not causing a clinical 
hormonal syndrome are considered nonfunctional.  It is also recognized that the functional status 
of these tumors may change over time or with treatment.  Moreover, some of these tumors can 
produce multiple hormones simultaneously,  although symptoms related to one of these hormones 
often will dominate.  
 
Pancreatic NET s are reputed to be relatively rare neoplasms, but their exact incidence and 
prevalence are somewhat elusive. This is in part because most registries, including the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, only include neoplasms that are 
deemed malignant.  For most epithelial malignancies, invasion of the basement membrane 
defines malignant behavior, but for pancreatic NET s, the definition of malignant  behavior is 
more complex.  In absence of malignant behavior such as direct invasion of adjacent organs or 
metastases to regional lymph nodes or distant sites, size is typically used to classify pancreatic 
NET s as benign or malignant.  We recently undertoo k comprehensive population -based analyses 
of NETs from SEER registries between 1973 and 2004.  The annual age -adjusted incidence of 
NETs arising from the pancreas in the periods covered by the SEER 17 (2000 -2004) was 0.32 
per 100,000 population, respective ly.(1) Malignant well -differentiated pancreatic NET s accounts 
for approximately 1% of pancreatic cancers by incidence and 10% of pancreatic cancers by 
prevalence. (2) 
 
The incidence of smaller pancreatic NET s in the general population, however, is likely to be 
much higher.  For example, surgical series suggest that most insulinoma s are small and localized, 
yet in the SEER registries , 61% of insulinomas had distant metastases at diagnosis, (2) a finding 
that suggests that most of the small insulinomas are not being included in those statistics.  
Furthermore, in an analysis of 11,472 autopsies performed at a Hong Kong hospital, pancreatic 
NET s were found in 0.1% of all cases. (3)  This suggest that the prevalence of small 
asymptomatic islet cell tumors, many of which are never diagnosed, may be 100 fold more 
common than the data suggested by SEER registries.   
 
Pancreatic NET s are usually more indolent than the more common f orms of pancreatic cancer 
are. Management of pancreatic NET s generally can be categorized into management of the 
problems caused by secreted hormone(s) and oncologic issues  related to tumor growth and 
management of metastasis.  While somatostatin analogues are quite active and standard of care 
for hormonal syndromes from pancreatic NETs, the oncologic management of advanced 
pancreatic NETs remains an area of unmet need.  
 
Streptozocin -based chemotherapy was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the 
treatment of pancreatic NET nearly three decades ago. Analyse s of 2 large case -series using 
Response Evaluation Criteria of S olid Tumors (RECIST)  criteria have reported objective tumor 
response rates of 38 and 39% (4, 5). However, the exact role of streptozocin -based chemother apy 
is still debated due to potentially serious adverse events and conflicting data about efficacy.  
 
Genetic cancer syndromes (TSC -2, NF -1, and vHL), somatic mutations identified using an 
NCI Protocol #:  9604

8 exome sequencing approach , and expression profiling have  consistentl y implicated a dysfunction 
of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway as a critical event in pancreatic NETs 
(6-8). Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of mTOR, w as studied in a multi -national double blind 
placebo controlled phase III study  (9). The study demonstrated that everolimus significantly 
prolonged median progression free survival (PFS) from 4.6 to 11 mon ths compared to placebo 
(Hazard Ratio [HR] = 0.35, 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.27 - 0.45; P<0.0001). Everolimus 
also significantly reduced insulin, glucagon and gastrin secretions among patients with functional 
pancreatic NETs (10, 11).  
 
NETs are vascular tumors.  Hence, there is also strong rationale to study anti -angiogenic agents 
in NETs. Sunitinib, an inhib itor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VGEF) and platelet -
derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors, was also studied in a double -blinded placebo -controlled 
phase III study (12).  Treatment with sunitinib 37.5 mg daily was associated with an 
improvement in median PFS from 5.5 to 11.4 months (HR = 0.42, 95% CI, 0.26 - 0.66) (12). 
Although the study failed to achieve statistical significance due to unplanned interim analyses 
and early termination, its results are supported by other studies of VEGF inhibitors in pancreatic 
NET (13-15).  Additionally, evidence from renal cell carcinoma suggests that multiple VEGF 
inhibiting agents can be used in series with continued efficacy.  In a study of renal cell carcinoma 
patients who had previously r eceived sunitinib, pazopanib resulted in objective responses in 6/31 
(19%) patients, including 3/18 (17%) of the patients who discontinued sunitinib due to disease 
progression (16). 
 
Results from these two randomized phase III studies le d to the approval of everolimus and 
sunitinib for the treatment of pancreatic NET and changed the treatment paradigm. However, it 
should be noted that the objective response rates  for everolimus and sunit inib are low and 
predictive markers of benefit remains undefined.  
 
2.2 CTEP  IND Agent : Ziv-aflibercept  
 
Background and pharmacological mode of action  
 
Ziv-aflibercept is also referred to as “AVE0005,” “AVE0005 (VEGF Trap),” “VEGF Trap,” “V -
Trap,” and “VGFT” in various clinical study protocols and other documents. However, it will be 
referred to by its international non -proprietary name (INN ), ziv-aflibercept , throughout this 
protocol ( Investigator’s Brochure, 2011 ). 
 
Ziv-aflibercept  is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of human vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) receptor extracellular domains fused  to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin 
G1 (IgG1) . Ziv -aflibercept  contains portions of the extracellular domains of 2 different vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs): VEGFR1 (also known as Flt -1) and VEGFR2 
(also known as KDR or Flk -1). Ziv-aflibercept  binds VEGF in the picomolar (pmol/L) range, 
and also binds placental growth factor (PlGF), although with lower affinity. The affinity 
constants (KD) for binding to 2 human isoforms of VEGF, VEGF165 and VEGF121, are 0.50 
pmol/L and 0.36 pmo l/L, respectively. The KD for human PlGF2 is 39 pmol/L. The binding of  
ziv-aflibercept  to its ligands in vivo is expected to block tumor angiogenesis and vascular 
permeability ( Investigator’s Brochure, 2011 ). 
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
9  
Ziv-aflibercept  drug product is formulated as a sterile liquid for intravenous (IV) administration . 
Ziv-aflibercept  has been found to be active with a broad pharmacological index against early and 
advanced stage disease in a variety of preclinical solid tumor models incl uding sarcomas, and 
ovarian, prostate, mammary, colon, and gastric carcinomas when used as a single agent or in 
combination with cytotoxic agents. In mouse models of ascites formation with ovarian and renal 
cell carcinoma,  ziv-aflibercept  inhibited ascites  formation and reduced tumor burden 
(Investigator’s Brochure, 2011 ). 
 
Two analytes were assayed in animal models specifically by enzyme linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) methods: free  ziv-aflibercept  (compound not complexed to VEGF), and bound  
ziv-aflibercept  (complexed  ziv-aflibercept : VEGF [ratio 1/1]) ( Investigator’s Brochure, 2011 ). 
 
Following IV administration in all animal species evaluated, free  ziv-aflibercept  was 
characterized by a low clearance (0.5 to 3 mL/hr/kg), a low volume of distribution (51 to 77 
mL/kg), and a long apparent elimination half -life (t1/2) of 48 to 98 hours.  Based on the 
correlation between exposure and activity in non -clinical models, the target pharmacological 
exposure in humans is proposed to be a safely administered dose of  ziv-aflibercept  at which an 
excess of free  ziv-aflibercept  is sustained ( Investigator’s Brochure, 2011 ). 
 
Clinical overview  
 
The cutoff for data inclusion in thi s update is 31 July 2011. To date, the clinical development of  
ziv-aflibercept  encompasses a total of 41 clinical oncology trials (25 sanofi trials and 16 national 
cancer institute [NCI] trials) in more than 3700 cancer patients mostly with advanced solid 
malignancies as well as 2 clinical trials in 76 healthy subjects (PDY6655 and PDY6656).  Doses 
have been administered up to 800 µg/kg SC twice weekly, 7 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks (q2w), and  
9 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks (q3w).  
 
Ziv-aflibercept  was initially admini stered SC in 2 single -agent dose -escalation safety and 
pharmacokinetic (PK) studies (TED6113/6114) in patients with advanced solid tumors or 
lymphomas. However, the SC route of administration was discontinued due to the high volume 
of injection required fo r the formulated  ziv-aflibercept  concentration of 25 mg/mL. 
Subsequently, only IV administration was used in all clinical studies.  
 
Phase 1 single -agent dose escalation studies (TED6115/TED6116) evaluated safety, tolerability, 
PK and anti -tumor activity in  patients with various solid tumor types. Phase 2 single -agent 
studies were designed to measure the effect of  ziv-aflibercept  in patients with ovarian cancers 
(ARD6122, ARD6772, and EFC6125), and non -small -cell lung adenocarcinoma ([NSCLA], 
ARD6123).  
 
Comb ination Phase 1 dose -escalation studies were conducted to evaluate safety, PK, and anti -
tumor activity in patients with solid malignancies. The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of  
ziv-aflibercept  was confirmed in these Phase 1 combination studies as 4 mg/kg  every 2 weeks 
(q2w) when combined with chemotherapy administered every 2 weeks, as was initially 
determined in single -agent studies TED6115/TED6116.  
NCI Protocol #:  9604

10  
Combination Phase 3 studies’ primary objective was efficacy. In these studies,  ziv-aflibercept  
was admini stered IV over 1 hour at 4 mg/kg q2w or 6 mg/kg q3w depending on the associated 
chemotherapy schedule.  
 
In the q2w regimen in Phase 1 and Phase 3 combination studies,  ziv-aflibercept  was combined 
with standard doses of the following cytotoxic agents: oxali platin/5 -fluorouracil/leucovorin 
(FOLFOX4), [TCD6117]), irinotecan/leucovorin/5 -fluorouracil (irinotecan/LV5FU2, 
[TCD6118]), and gemcitabine or gemcitabine and erlotinib (TCD6121), gemcitabine 
(EFC10547/VANILLA), and irinotecan/5 -FU/leucovorin (FOLFIRI, [E FC10262/VELOUR]).  
 
In the q3w regimen in Phase 1 and Phase 3 combination studies,  ziv-aflibercept  was combined 
with standard doses of docetaxel (Taxotere®)/cisplatin/5 -fluorouracil (TCF, [TCD6119]), 
docetaxel or docetaxel/cisplatin or pemetrexed (TCD6120),  and docetaxel (EFC10261/VITAL).  
 
Clinical pharmacology  
 
Pharmacokinetics measurements were also performed during clinical trials and to characterize 
the PK of  ziv-aflibercept , 2 analytes were quantified in healthy subjects and in patients: free  ziv-
aflibe rcept  (compound not complexed to VEGF) and bound  ziv-aflibercept  (VEGF:aflibercept 
complex in a ratio  1:1). Bound  ziv-aflibercept  is pharmacologically inert. In addition, population 
PK analyses were conducted based on pooled PK data from Phase 1, Phase 2 a nd Phase 3 
studies.  
 
Free ziv-aflibercept  is thought to be cleared by 2 mechanisms in humans: a fast clearance 
resulting from binding VEGF to form bound  ziv-aflibercept , and a slower pathway where the 
free ziv-aflibercept  is eliminated by other biological mechanisms, such as protein catabolism. 
The results in humans are consistent with those from animal studies. Renal elimination of  ziv-
aflibercept  has not been investigated in humans. However, since high molecular weight (MW) 
proteins are not cleared by thi s route, renal elimination of  ziv-aflibercept  is expected to be 
minimal. This has been confirmed in rat studies.  
 
Ziv-aflibercept  exhibits a non linear PK with higher clearance at lowest dose levels whilst the PK 
of free  ziv-aflibercept  is linear over the 2-9 mg/kg dose range. This could be related to saturable 
high- affinity binding of  ziv-aflibercept  to endogenous VEGF at higher doses, limited by VEGF 
availability. At doses greater than 2 mg/kg, free  ziv-aflibercept  clearance is 1.0 L/day with a 
terminal half-life of 6 days and a volume of distribution (Vss=7.8 L) slightly greater than blood 
compartment. Elimination of VEGF -bound  ziv-aflibercept  is slower with an apparent clearance 
of 
0.182 L/day and a half -life of 15 days. At 4 mg/kg q2w and 6 mg/kg q3w, concentrations of free  
ziv-aflibercept  were near steady -state levels by the second cycle with essentially no 
accumulation (accumulation ratio of 1.2 and 1.1, respectively).  
 
According to simulations conducted using the population PK model, at 4 mg/kg q2w, the free to 
bound  ziv-aflibercept  ratio exceeds 1 throughout all the dosing intervals for 89% of the 
population. Consistently, the mean free over bound  ziv-aflibercept  ratio measured in all studies 
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
11 showed that free was in excess of bound  ziv-aflibercept  throughout treatment period at dose 
levels greater than  2 mg/kg every 2 weeks or greater than 4 mg/kg every three weeks.  
 
In combination therapies, no impact of  ziv-aflibercept  was observed on the PK of cytotoxic 
agents including oxaliplatin, cisplatin, 5 -FU, irinotecan, docetaxel, pemetrexed, gemcitabine and 
erlotinib.  
 
Pharmacodynamics (PD) and PK/PD evaluations were also undertaken during clinical trials to 
determine the effect of  ziv-aflibercept  on blood pressure (PDY6655 and PDY6656), on the Q -T 
interval  (TES10897), and on the relationship between PK parameters and safety and efficacy 
variables in Phase 3 studies (EFC10547/VANILLA, EFC10261/VITAL, EFC10262/VELOUR).  
 
The results on blood pressure (BP) from PDY6655 and PDY6656, suggested a renin -independent  
mechanism of hypertension induced by  ziv-aflibercept . No clear mechanism of the dose -related 
increase in BP was revealed in both studies, in particular, no change in renin angiotensin 
aldosterone system was observed.  
 
In the randomized, double -blind trial  (TES10897) of docetaxel combined with either  ziv-
aflibercept  6 mg/kg q3w or placebo, it was concluded that  ziv-aflibercept  6 mg/kg did not affect 
the ventricular repolarization in humans to an extent that would require substantial risk -benefit 
evaluation.  
 
Across the Phase 3 trials, individual free  ziv-aflibercept  clearance and AUCs were consistently 
correlated with both clinical efficacy outcomes and some class event safety endpoints. Overall, 
the lower the free  ziv-aflibercept  clearance, and the higher t he free  ziv-aflibercept  AUC, the 
longer the overall survival (OS) and progression -free survival (PFS); but the higher the 
incidences of hypertension (in each Phase 3 trial) and hemorrhage (in the EFC10262/VELOUR 
MCRC pivotal Phase 3 trial).  Considering th ese findings and the clinical results of 
EFC10262/VELOUR, the  ziv-aflibercept  dose of 4mg/kg q2w appears to correspond to an 
adequate dose when combined with FOLFIRI in MCRC and for general use in combination 
therapy.  
 
In clinical studies, serum levels of anti-aflibercept antibodies were measured in all patients 
during and after treatment. A low incidence of positive responses in the assays was reported and 
no or limited effect of positive response in the assays was observed on PK.  
 
2.3 Rationale  
 
2.3.1  Rationa le for  ziv-aflibercept  in pNETs  
 
Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (WDNET) can originate from cells scattered 
throughout the body. While generally thought to be rare, its diagnosed incidence is on the rise. (1) 
WDNETs are vascular and known to express va scular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). (17, 18) 
Prior studies with VEGF monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab, (19) and VEGF tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors sunitinib, (13, 20) soraf enib,(14) and pazopanib (15) have demonstrated promising 
activity. The response rates for VEGF tyrosine kinase i nhibitors have generally been higher for 
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
12 patients with pancreatic NETs. A recent phase III study reported improved  Progression Free 
Survival (PFS) among patients with advanced pancreatic NET treated with sunitinib compared to 
placebo. (21) 
 
There is also data to support that PlGF may be  of critical importance in pNETs. In RADIANT -3, 
largest phase III study to have been ever conducted in pNETs, Everolimu s significantly 
improved PFS compared with placebo (11 vs 4.6 months; HR=0.35; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.45; 
P<.001). (9) We recently reported the analysis of VEGF pathway biomarkers from the study. (22) 
In univa riate analyses, patients with elevated baseline VEGF -A (P =0.001), PlGF (P =0.004) or 
sVEGFR1 (P <0.001) had significantly shorter PFS compared to those with low marker levels. In 
multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model stratified by t reatment arm, which 
included all baseline angiogenesis markers (high vs low), only sVEGFR1 and PlGF were 
significantly associated with PFS (HR 1.54 [95% CI, 1.20 –1.98; P<0.001] and 1.35 [95% CI, 
1.01–1.81; P=0.46] respectively). (22) These analyses sugges t PlGF plays a significant role in 
pNET and there is rationale to study  ziv-aflibercept  in pNETs.  
 
2.3.2  Rationale for baseline perfusion CT as predictive biomarker  
 
There is urgent need for the development of predictive and prognostic biomarker in oncolog y to 
accelerate advances in novel therapeutics, and to develop personalized therapy. Biomarkers for 
therapies targeting angiogenesis have been particularly challenging. This is in part due to fact 
that tumor response rates with these and other molecularly targeted therapies have generally been 
low. Nonetheless, treatment can be associated with significant improvements in progression -free 
survival and overall survival. Predictive, prognostic, and pharmacodynamic biomarkers that will 
enable development of nov el drugs and novel drug combinations targeting angiogenesis are 
needed . 
 
Since the initial report that a greater reduction in Ktrans, measured by DCE -MRI, was associated 
with disease stabilization in a phase I study of VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PTK/Z K,(12) 
many have attempted to correlate dynamic imaging findings with clinical outcome with varying 
degrees of success.(4, 13 -16) In our prior study with bevacizumab and PEG interferon, perfusion 
CT (pCT), demonstrated that bevacizumab led to rapid and sus tained decrease in tumor blood 
flow (BF), and suggested that lower post -treatment blood volume (BV) correlated with PFS.(4) 
One limitation of many past studies, including our prior study,(4) is that dynamic imaging was 
optional and not uniformly performed among all patients , limiting statistical power and raising 
the issue of potential selection bias. Other retrospective studies have included heterogeneous 
groups of patients treated with different VEGF inhibitors. Nonetheless, many of these studies 
suggeste d that dynamic imaging has the  potential to select patients likely to benefit from anti -
angiogenic therapy. (4, 13 -16)  
 
In our more recent study with bevacizumab and everolimus, we confirmed that the absolute 
decrease in tumor BF following bevacizumab and  everolimus, correlated with baseline BF, and 
that such therapy decreased tumor BF by a percentage.(17)  In this study, pre -treatment 
permeability surface (PS), percent reduction in BF, BV, and post -treatment mean transit time 
(MTT ) correlated with RECIST response.(17) Scatter plot of parameters with best change in 
RECIST target lesion diameters are included below.

The high number of parameters correlating with outcome is likely related to the high degree of 
correlation between these parameters. In a recent pooled -analysis of pancreatic NET patients 
treated with VEGF inhibitors at MD Anderson, baseline BV a lso correlated with response. Of 
particular interest are the correlations between pre -treatment BV and PS with tumor response. 
This suggests that one can select patient likely to benefit from anti -angiogenic therapy based on 
one pre -treatment scan. We will  formally test this hypothesis in the current study.  
 
If the pCT can be confirmed to select patients who will benefit from VEGF inhibitors such as  
ziv-aflibercept , this approach could be used for further development of  ziv-aflibercept  in NET as 
well, as id entification of subgroups of patients with other solid tumors likely to benefit from 
agents targeting the VEGF pathway.

(Coordinating Center ) by the Study Coordinator. The required forms Registration Form can be 
found in Appendix D. 
 
Following registration, patients should begin protocol treatment within 14 days.  Issues that 
would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator.  If a patient 
does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the patient’s registration on the study 
may be canceled.  The Study Coordinator should be notified of cancellations as soon as possible.  
 
Except in very unusual circumstances, each par ticipating institution will order DCTD -supplied 
agents directly from CTEP.  Agents may be ordered by a participating site only after the initial 
IRB approval for the site has been forwarded by the Coordinating Center to the CTEP PIO  
(PIO@ctep.nci. nih.gov) .

registration.  
 
 
5. TREATMENT  PLAN  
 
One cycle consist s of 21 days (3 weeks ). See section 10.0  for acceptable window for testing and 
treatment.  Ziv-aflibercept  will be given intravenously on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment 
response will be evaluated every 3 cycles (approximately 9 weeks depending on any treatment 
delays).  
 
Perfusion CT wil l be performed at baseline (pre -treatment), c ycle 1 day 21  (± 2 days , prior to 
cycle 2 dose ), and at time of progression. The progression perfusion CT will not be performed if 
> 28 days have elapsed from the last  ziv-aflibercept  treatment (i.e. canceled or  delayed treatment 
due to adverse event).  
 
5.1 Agent Administration  
 
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient  basis.  Reported adverse events and potential 
risks are described in Secti on 7.  Appropriate dose  modifications  are described in Section 6 .  No 
investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described below may be 
administered with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy.  
 
 
Regimen  Description  
Agent  Precautions  Dose  Route  Schedule  Cycle

Ziv-aflibercept  
will be dil uted in 
NS IV over 60 
minutes (up to 
120 minutes is 
permitted and not 
considered a 
deviation).   Days 1  21 days  
(3 weeks)  
 
Management of Hypersensitivity Reactions: Stop infusion of  Ziv-aflibercept  for 30 -60 
minutes.  Medicate with diphenhydramine 25 – 50 mg IV (or a similar antihistamine) and 
steroids such as hydrocortisone 50 -100 mg IV or dexamethasone 10 -20 mg IV approximate ly 30 
minutes before re - starting the  ziv-aflibercept .  If the subject re -develops a hypersensitivity 
reaction despite treatment with diphenhydramine and steroids, the infusion should be stopped for 
another 30 – 60 minutes, depending upon the severity of t he reaction.  The infusion may be 
resumed by administering a histamine H2 -receptor antagonist approximately 30 minutes before 
restarting the  ziv-aflibercept  infusion and meperidine 25 -50 mg IV if patient still had chills and 
rigors.  Famotidine 20 mg IV or  ranitidine 50 mg IV are recommended rather than cimetidine 
because of the lack of likely metabolic/pharmacologic interactions with the former drugs.  The 
rate of the  ziv-aflibercept  infusion may also be slowed from 60 minutes to 2 hours.  Also, it is 
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
20 perm issible to premedicate overnight with steroids such as dexamethasone or prednisone.  All 
subjects should be monitored while receiving the  ziv-aflibercept  infusion and emergency medical 
equipment and health care personnel must be readily available to respon d to hypersensitivity 
reactions or other medical emergencies.  
 
5.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Use of somatostatin analogues for the control of hormone related syndrome from neuroendocrine 
tumors is allowed. Both Octreotide L AR at doses of ≤30 mg IM every 3 to 4 weeks, and 
Lanreotide autogel ≤120 mg SC every 3 to 4 weeks can be used as long acting agent. Octreotide 
short -acting SC 2 – 4 times per day can also be used for supplemental therapy  
 
The use of interferon or everolimu s for control of hormonal  syndrom e is not allowed.  
 
Other medications used for the supportive therapy of hormonal  syndrome are allowed. Other 
medications for diarrhea may be used on an as needed basis.  Steatorrhea due to somatostatin 
analogue may be manag ed by the usage of pancrealipase.  Diarrhea due to short gut syndrome 
should be managed with cholestyramine.   
 
5.3 Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event (s), treatment may continue until one of 
the following criteria appl ies: 
 
• Disease progression,  
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study,  or 
 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient u nacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
 
5.4 Duration of Follow Up  
 
Patients removed from study without progression will be followed until progression, start of new 
anti-neoplastic therapy, withdrawal of consent, or death, which ever occurs first.  Patients 
removed from study for unacceptable adverse event (s) will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the adverse event.

21 5.5 Criteria for Removal from Study  
 
Patients will be removed from study when any of th e criteria list ed in Section 5. 3 applies.  The 
reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must be documented in the Case 
Report Form.  
 
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE M ODIFICATIONS  
 
For continuation trea tment during subsequent cycles, patient should have recovered from any G3 
or G4 treatment -related AEs to ≤ G1. With exception of ziv -aflibercept  doses withheld for 
proteinuria, t he maximum delay for subsequent cycles is 4 weeks from when treatment was 
originally due  (7 weeks from last dose) . If a dose is delayed beyond 4 weeks for any reason  other 
than proteinuria , patient will permanently discontinue therapy . Please see Table 3 for dose 
modification and interruptions due to proteinuria.  
 
Patients should be permanently  discontinued for the following AEs :

• Fistula formation  
• Hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy (G4 hypertension)  
• Arterial thromboembolic events (any grade)  
• Nephrotic syndrome or thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)  
• Reversible posterior leuk oencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS)  
 
Temporarily hold  ziv-aflibercept  therapy for the following:  
 
• Elective surgery  should be carried out at least 4 weeks after last dose of  ziv-aflibercept . 
Do not resume  ziv-aflibercept  for at least  4 weeks following major surgery and until the 
surgical wound is fully healed.

below). Delay the administration of zi v-afl i bercept , for a 
maximum of 4 weeks, until recovery to blood pressure (BP) 
≤150/100 or to systolic BP < 180 if diastolic BP < 90 for 
patients with known history of isolated systolic hypertension: 
• If BP is controlled within 2 weeks delay: 
o First episode: readminister zi v-afl i bercept  at the 
same dose.  
o Second episode: readminister ziv-afl i bercept , with 
zi v-afl i bercept  reduced to dose level-1. 
o Third episode, discontinue ziv-aflibercept . 
• If BP is still uncontrolled despite appropriate anti 
hypertensive treatment and after 2 - 4 weeks delay: Ziv-
aflibercept  will be reduced to dose level  -1. 
• In case of re-occurence of grade 3 BP despite dose 
reduction of zi v-afl i bercept , or if BP is still uncontrolled 
despite delay of 4 weeks , the patients will be 
permanently discontinued from zi v-afl i bercept .

* Based on investigator ’s judgement in assessing potential risk of extesion and/or embolization.  
** Continuation of  ziv-aflibercept  may be considered, depending on individual benefit/risk assessment in case of 
incidental discovery of asymptomatic pulmonary embolism.  
*** Initial titration of anti -hypertensive medication following the start of a new drug (eg terazosin or calcium 
channel blocker) will not count as more intensive therapy.  
 
Hypertension therapy recomm endations: 
 
• For patients without  prior antih ypertensive therapy, at the time of the hypertensive 
episode the  initiation of calcium-channel blockers should be considered as a first-intent 
treatment. A close monito ring of the BP should  be initiated for further adjustment in 
treatment, as needed. Ultim ately, antihypertensive  treatment must be individualized based 
on the presence of comorbidity factors such as diabetes, cardiovascular or renal disease, 
additionally taking into account the safety and the efficacy of any prior antihypertensive 
therapy received. In addition, oral and/or intravenous sodium intake should be carefully 
monito red in these patients. 
 
• For patients already under anti-hypertensive therapy efforts should be done to optimize 
the existing therapy before adding  other agents as required to control the BP. 
 
When hypertension  is accompanied by signs or symptoms of end organ damage such as 
hypertensive  retinopathy, kidney function abnormalities (like progressive proteinuria), or any 
signs or symptoms  of cardiovascular morbidity or central nervous system (CNS) morbidity, 
treatment with zi v-aflibercept  should be interrupted. 
 
Proteinuria: 
 
Determination  and management of proteinuria:  
Prior to each administration of zi v-aflibercept , perform an UPCR. 
 
Urinary protein creatinine ratio (UPCR ) corresponds to the ratio of urinary protein and urinary 
creatinine  concentrations (expressed in mg/dL). There is a high correlation between morning 
UPCR and 24-hour proteinuria in patients with normal or reduced renal function, UPCR 
demonstrated very good to excellent performance for the diagnosis of both abnormal and 
nephrotic proteinuria at all renal function levels. This ratio provides an accurate quantification of 
24-hours urinary protein excretion. 
 
UPCR to detect proteinuria, will be done on morning urine spot. If UPCR > 1, 24-hour urine 
collection to grade proteinuria will be performed. In addition,  in case proteinuria is associated 
with hematuria (microscopic or macroscopic), schistocytes, orosomu coïd, haptoglobin,  and LDH 
will be measured in blood and a nephrologist advice should be considered as detailed in Table 3 . 
Proteinuria should always be assessed taking into account the presence or absence of 
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
24 hematuria and the blood  pressure status of the patient. 
Table 3 summ arizes the course of action with regard to ziv-aflibercept  dosin g, which will d epend 
on the presence of hematuria and the level of 24h proteinuria results. Only one dose level 
reduction is permitted for zi v-aflibercept .

26 Reversible posterior leuko -encephalopathy (RPLS) or clinical symptoms related to vasogenic 
edema  of the white matter:  
 
Clinical presentations are variable and may include headache, altered mental status, seizure and 
cortical visual deficit. Hypertension is a risk factor. MRI scans are key to diagnosis and typically 
demonstrate vasogenic edema (hyperi ntensity in T2 and FLAIR images and hypodensity in T1 
images) predominently in the white matter of the posterior parietal and occipital lobes; less 
frequently, the anterior distributions  
and the gray matter may also be involved. RPLS should be in the diffe rential diagnosis in 
patients presenting with unexplained mental status change, visual disturbance, seizure, or other 
CNS findings. RPLS is potentially reversible with early recognition of symptoms and timely 
correction of the underlying causes, including control of BP and interruption of the offending 
drug, which are important in order to prevent progression to irreversible tissue damage.  
 
Gastro -intestinal perforation:  
 
In case a patient reported abdominal pain or increase in severity of pre -existing abdo minal pain, 
with or without associated symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, constipation), he/she should be 
evaluated by a physician for possible gastro -intestinal perforation, as this has been reported wi th 
anti-VEGF agents.  
 
Hypersensitivity reaction:  
 
In case of hypersensitivity reaction, institutional treatment guidelines for this type of  
AEs, or the following proposed guideline in Table 4  can be applied.  
 
Table 4 – Acute infusion reaction management  
Symptom Severity Intervention Recommendation 
Mild-Moderate  
E.g., NCI CTCAE grade ≤ 2 cutaneous 
reaction, pruritus, flushing, rash, dyspnea, 
tachycardia, hypotension, anxiety, headache, 
myalgias, edema, nausea  Stop ziv-aflibercept  infusion;   
Give diphenhydramine 50 mg IV and/or IV  
dexamethasone 10 mg;  
Resume  ziv-aflibercept  infusion after subject 
recovery.  
Severe  
e.g., symptomatic bronchospasm, generalized 
urticaria, systolic BP ≤ 80 mm Hg, 
angioedema, anaphylaxis  Stop ziv-aflibercept  infusion;   
Give IV diphenhydramin e 50 mg and/or IV  
dexamethasone 10 mg and/or epinephrine as 
needed;  
Permanently discontinue  ziv-aflibercept .

7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIS T AND REPORTING REQU IREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  Th e 
following list of AEs ( Section 7.1 ) and the characteristics of an observed AE ( Section 7.2 ) will 
determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting (via CTEP -AERS ) in addition  to 
routine  reporting.  
 
Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR)  
for 
Ziv-aflibercept (VEGF -Trap, AVE 0005, NSC 724770)  
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of reported 
and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform presentation of events by 
body system. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to 
Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a sep arate column and is identified with bold and italicized 
text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol specific exceptions to expedited 
reporting to NCI (except as noted below).  Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Rep orting 
Requirements' http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  
for further clarification. Frequency is provided based on 941 patients. Below is the CAEPR for Ziv -
aflibercept (VEGF -Trap, AVE 0005).  
 
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to 
the AE in the SPEER. If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol usi ng multiple 
investigational agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to 
determine if expedited reporting is required.

NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
31 7.1.1 Adverse Event List(s) for CIP ( e.g. Study -Specific) Commercial Imaging Agents  
 
Commercial standard iodinated contrast agent will be used for perfusion CTs performed in this 
study. Known adverse events associated with iodinated contrast agents include: hot flashes3.4%; 
angina pectoris 3.0%; flushing 1.8%; bradycardia 1.3%; hypotension 1.0%; hives 1.0%.  
 
7.2 Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
• CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Ad verse Events (CTCAE) version 
4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting.  All appropriate treatment areas should have access  
to a copy of the CTCAE version 4 .0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4 .0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
• For expedited reporting purposes only:   
- AEs for the agent  that are bold and italicized  in the CAEPR ( i.e., those listed in the 
SPEER column, Section 7.1.1 ) should be reported  through CTEP -AERS only if the 
grade is above the grade provided in the SPEER . 
 
• Attribution  of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelate d – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
7.3 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting  
 
7.3.1 Expedited AE reporting for this study must use CTEP -AERS (CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP Web site  (http://ctep.cancer.gov ).  The 
reporting procedures to be followed are presented in the “ NCI G uidelines  for 
Investigators:  Adverse  Event Reporting  Requirements  for DCTD (CTEP and CIP) and 
DCP INDs and IDEs ” which can be downloaded from the CTEP Web site  
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ).  These requ irements are briefly outlined in the table s below 
(Section 7.3.3 ). 
 
In the rare occurrence when Internet connectivity is lost, a 24-hour notification is to be 
made to CT EP by telephone at 301 -897-7497.  Once Internet connectivity is restored, the 
24-hour notification phoned in must be entered electronically into CTEP -AERS by the 
original submitter at the site.  
 
7.3.2 The following text is required for multi -institutional studies only and may be deleted for 
singl e institution studies.  
CTEP -AERS is programmed for automatic electronic distribution of reports to the 
following individuals:  Study Coordinator of the Lead Organization, Principal 
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
32 Investigator, and the local treating physician.  CTEP -AERS provides a copy feature for 
other e -mail recipients.  
 
7.3.3 Expedited Reporting Guidelines  
 
Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID assigned during trial 
registration on all reports.  
 
Note:  A death on study requires both routine and expedited reportin g regardless of 
causality, unless as noted below.  Attribution to treatment or other cause must be 
provided.  
 
Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Neoplasms benign, 
malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) - Other (Progr essive Disease)”  
under the system organ class (SOC) of the same name.  Evidence that the death was a 
manifestation of underlying disease ( e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth 
or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease pr ocess) should be 
submitted.

7.4 Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
 
All Adverse Events must  be reported in routine study data submissions.  AEs reported through 
CTEP -AERS must also be reported in routine study data submissions.  
 
7.5 Secondary Malignanc y 
 
A secondar y malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
CTEP requires all s econdary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported via  CTEP -AERS . Three options are available to describe the event:  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
7.6 Second Malignancy  
 
A sec ond malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).   Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting 
via CDUS  unless otherwise specified .

9. BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE , AND SPECIAL STUDIES  
 
There is urgent need for the development of predictive and prognostic biomarker in oncolo gy to 
accelerate advances in novel therapeutics, and to develop personalized therapy. Biomarkers for 
therapies targeting angiogenesis have been particularly challenging. This is in part due to the fact 
that tumor response rates with these and other molecul arly targeted therapies have generally been 
low. Nonetheless, treatment can be associated with significant improvements in progression -free 
survival and overall survival. Predictive, prognostic, and pharmacodynamic biomarkers that will 
enable development o f novel drugs and novel drug combinations targeting angiogenesis are 
needed . 
 
Since the initial report that a greater reduction in Ktrans, measured by DCE -MRI, was associated 
with disease stabilization in a phase I study of VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PTK/ZK,(12) 
many have attempted to correlate dynamic imaging findings with clinical outcome with varying 
degrees of success.(4, 13 -16) In our prior study with bevacizumab and PEG interferon, perfusion 
CT (pCT), demonstrated that bevacizumab led to rapid an d sustained decrease in tumor blood 
flow (BF), and suggested that lower post -treatment blood volume (BV) correlated with PFS.(4) 
One limitation of many past studies, including our prior study,(4) is that dynamic imaging was 
optional and not uniformly perfo rmed among all patients limiting statistical power and raising 
the issue of potential selection bias. Other retrospective studies have included heterogeneous 
groups of patients treated with different VEGF inhibitors. Nonetheless, many of these studies 
suggested that dynamic imaging had potential to select patients likely to benefit from anti -
angiogenic therapy.(4, 13 -16)  
 
In our more recent study with bevacizumab and everolimus, we confirmed that the absolute 
decrease in tumor BF following bevacizumab and everolimus, correlated with baseline BF, and 
that such therapy decreased tumor BF by a percentage.(17)  In this study, pre -treatment 
permeability surface (PS), percent reduction in BF, BV, and post -treatment MTT correlated with 
RECIST response.(17) In a re cent pooled -analysis of pancreatic NET patients treated with VEGF 
inhibitors at M. D. Anderson, baseline BV also correlated with response.  
 
Of particular interest are the correlations between pre -treatment BV and PS with tumor response. 
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
38 This suggests that  one can select patient s likely to benefit from anti -angiogenic therapy based on 
one pre -treatment scan. We will formally test this hypothesis in the current study.  
 
9.1 Perfusion CT  
 
9.1.1  Perfusion CT Procedure and image acquisition  
 
Perfusion CTs will be performed at : 
1. Pre-treatment baseline (within 1 week of cycle 1 day 1)  
2. Cycle 1 day 21 (+/ - 3 days)  
3. Time of radiologic disease progression  (if patient is ≤ 28 days from last dose of  Ziv-
aflibercept ) 
 
Given the type of tumor studied, it is anticipated that most tumor lesions studied will be located 
in the liver , but any tumor location can also be studied .  Scans will be obtained with patients in 
the supine position on a 32 or 64-row multidetector CT  scanner . Axial cine scans will be 
performed using a single level of 4 cm thickness at the midpoint of the selected target lesion.  CT 
data will be collected in two phases to cover 4 cm axial thickness t hrough the midpoint of the 
selected target lesion :  there will be an initial 30 -40 second breath hold cine acquisition, followed 
by intermittent breath hold short helical scans extending out to 600 seconds. Data acquisition 
will start approximately  5 secon ds after intravenous injection of 50 mL of a nonionic contrast 
agent (ioversol [Optiray™]  or equivalent ,, 320 -350 mg of iodine/100 mL, Mallinckrodt Inc., St 
Louis, MO) using an automatic injector at 7 mL/second, through an 18 -gauge needle placed in an 
antecubital vein. The initial first phase cinecine  images, eight contiguous slices each of 5 mm 
thickness, will be acquired in cine mode with a 1 second rotation speed, and will be 
reconstructed at the CT console at half rotation intervals, giving an effective  temporal resolution 
of 0.5 seconds ; the second phase intermittent short helical images will be anatomically registered 
with the cine images.  
 
9.1.2  Perfusion CT image analyses  
 
The images will be analyzed centrally at M.D. Anderson using CT -perfusion sof tware on a 
workstation (CT Perfusion version 3  or higher , Advantage Windows 4.2; GE Medical Systems, 
Milwaukee, WI). This uses a deconvolution physiological model. (29) A region of interest (ROI) 
will be placed in the largest available artery in the cine sections, typically the abdominal aorta, 
which provide sprovide s the arterial input function for generation of perfusion maps, using the 
Body Perfusion protocol. In the case of liver lesions, the Liver Perfusion protocol will be used 
where possible; this utilizes a dual vascul ar input, consisting of arterial and portal vein inputs. 
ROIs will be drawn freehand around the periphery of target lesions with reference to the source 
cine CT images and perfusion parametric maps, on each axial section in which tumor was 
visualized.  Thi s will generate mean BF, BV, MTT, and PS (and in the case of Liver Protocol, 
also hepatic arterial fraction (HAF)) values for each tumor ROI on each level.  The pCT 
parameter values obtained for each level were then averaged for each lesion evaluated.  
 
9.1.3 Perfusion CT data analyses  
 
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
39 See Statistical Section  for the analyses of study primary endpoints.  
 
For perfusion CT exploratory endpoints, descriptive statistics will be provided wit h confidence 
intervals where appropriate. To explore optimal cut -points for perfusion CT parameters in 
predicting response, response rate for each parameter with cut -off set at median of the parameter 
will be computed. In addition, r eceiver oper ating chara cteristic curve will be used to graph the 
effect of cut -points in perfusion CT parameters on RECIST response classified as a binary 
outcome.  
 
9.2 Laboratory Correlative Studies  
 
9.2.1.1  Baseline plasma VEGF -A & PlGF  
 
We recently reported the analysis of VEGF pathway biomarkers from RADIANT -3, the largest 
phase III study to have been ever conducted in pNETs .(9, 22) In univariate ana lyses, patients 
with elevated baseline VEGF -A (P =0.001),  or PlGF (P =0.004) had significantly shorter PFS 
compared to those with low marker levels. We plan to analyze baseline levels in current study 
and correlate with outcome as well as baseline perfusio n CT parameters.  
 
PlGF levels will be obtained by the R&D Quantikine Human PlGF Immunoassay (#DPG00) and 
analyzed on a BioTek Synergy HT Multi -detection microplate reader, and analyzed on Gen5 
software (BioTek Winooski, Vermont).  All samples will be analy zed in duplicate, and each 
plate will contain positive and negative controls.  The assay requires 200 µL of plasma for a 
duplicated analysis.  The lower limits of detection is 7pg/ml, with upper limit for the assay of 
1,000 pg/mL.  Intra -assay precision is  <10%.  The variance of the duplicate samples will be 
determined, and analytes with %CV >15%  will be repeated.  
 
9.2.1.2  Handling of Specimens(s)  
 
10 ml of blood should be collected in EDTA (Lavender) tube and centrifuged at 1600 RCF for 
15 minutes. Plasma should t ransferred into two push cap tubes and can be stored at either -20 C 
or -80 C freezer.  
 
9.2.1.3  Shipping of Specimen(s)  
 
Specimens should be stored locally until study is closed to new patient entry. At that time , the 
specimens collected outside of M. D. Anderson should be shipped frozen on a Tuesday by 
overnight courier  delivery to:

11. MEASUREMENT OF EFFEC T 
 
11.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patien ts should be re -evaluated for response every 3 cycles (9  
weeks ).  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 9 (not less 
than 4) weeks following initial documentation of objective response.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228 -247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of  the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph 
nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
11.1.1  Definitions  
 
Evaluable for toxicity .  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their 
first treatment with  Ziv-aflibercep t. 
 
Evaluable for objective response.   Only those patients who have measurable disease 
present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease 
re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  These patients will  have their 
response classified according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit 
objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered 
evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response .  Patients who hav e lesions present at baseline 
that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at 
least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for non -target disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
11.1.2  Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease .  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be re corded) as ≥20 mm by chest 
x-ray or as ≥10 mm with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated  area will only be 
considered measureable if there has been evidence of progression in those lesions.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT s can slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
43 the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), a re considered as non -measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) 
since they are, by definition, simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as  target 
lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions sh ould be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, th e largest lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -
nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for  all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, 
then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used 
as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.  
 
11.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measure ments should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  
 
The same  method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
44 evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being 
followe d cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and  surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If CT scans have 
slice thickness greater th an 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be 
twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body 
scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution ; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the 
technical s pecifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/asse ssed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition pr otocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body  scans 
should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
PET-CT  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of  optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which 
may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
Ultrasound   Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety for independent review at a later d ate and, because they are operator dependent, it 
cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the 
study, confirmation by CT or MRI  is advised.  If there is concern about radiation 
exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
45  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may  be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
Tumor markers   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered 
in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recu rrent prostate cancer) have been published 
[JNCI  96:487 -488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461 -3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148 -1159, 
2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -125 
progression criteria which are to be integrated with  objective tumor assessment for use in 
first-line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534 -1535, 2000].  
 
Cytology, Histology   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residu al lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG -PET  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes  
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis 
of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negat ive FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG -
PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, thi s is PD.  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initi al abnormal 
FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this 
is not PD.  
c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent 
fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease -specific medical 
litera ture for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches 
may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy 
resolution/sensitivity.  
 
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
46 Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an upta ke 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
11.1.4  Response Criteria  
 
11.1.4.1  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the su m of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at le ast 5 mm.  (Note:  
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters w hile on 
study.  
 
11.1.4.2  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status chan ge, not a single lesion increase.     
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion 
of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by t he review panel (or Principal 
Investigator).  
 
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
47 11.1.4.3  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the  
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

Note :  Patients with a global deterioration of he alth status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment  without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuati on of treatment.

11.1.5  Duration of Respon se 
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taki ng as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that progressive disease is object ively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseli ne measurements.

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints /Objectives  
 
This is a single arm , open-label, phase II study of  Ziv-aflibercept  in patient s with advanced 
pancreatic NET . The study endpoint is objective response rate according to RECIST 1.1.   The 
primary objectives are to e stimate the objective response rate of  Ziv-aflibercept  among patients 
with advanced pancreatic NETs and to test the hypotheses that baseline perfusion CT parameters 
can predict which patients with advanced pNETs will respond to treatment with  Ziv-aflibercept . 
 
13.2 Study Design/ Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
A sequential two -stage design will be used to estimate the response rate of  Ziv-aflibercept  in 
pNETs and te st the hypothesis that baseline pCT can predict which patients with advanced 
pNETs will respond to treatment with  Ziv-aflibercept . 
 
In a recent phase III study of sunitinib versus placebo, treatment with VEGF TKI sunitinib was 
associated with significant i mprovement in PFS (11.4 (7.4 –19.8) versus 5.5 (3.6 –7.4) month; HR 
= 0.42 (0.26 –0.66)) and objective response rate of 9% versus 0%. Given the inclusion of 
treatments who have received prior VEGF inhibitor therapy, a true response rate of 5 % or less 
(H0) wou ld be considered uninteresting for further development. A true response rate of at  least 
20% (H1) would be considered of interest for further investigation. These hypotheses are 
informed in part by the understanding that response rate will be expected to b e somewhat lower 
among patients previously treated with VEGF inhibitors, despite the continued efficacy of serial 
VEGF inhibitor therapy, as demonstrated in the second -line pazopanib study in renal cell 
carcinoma, which estimated the response rate to be 19 %(16), as compared with a 31% response 
rate in a randomized st udy of untreated renal cell carcinoma patients (30). 
 
A two -stage design will be used to test whether there is sufficient evidence that the treatment 
could be a ca ndidate for further study, with early stopping rules to terminate the study early  for 
poor results.  
 
Early stopping rules : 
The following stopping rules will be applied hierarchically. Accrual will be held at time of 
interim analysis pending application of Stopping rule 1. Accrual will not be held for Stopping 
rule 2 or 3 at time of interim analysis, if random variation preclude adequate number of patients 
in subgroups at time of interim analysis.  
 
Stopping rule 1:  The first  early stopping  rule applies to al l patients by applying the Simon’s 
optimal  two-stage design. In the first stage, we will enroll 21 evaluable patients. If 0 or 1 of the 
first 21 patients achieve RECIST response (PR or CR), the study will terminate.  If at least 2 of 
the first 21 evaluable  patients achieve RESCIST response (PR or CR), an additional 20 patients 
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
52 will be enrolled.  If at the end of the second stage, at least 5 out of 41 patients achieve RECIST 
response, the treatment will be considered acceptable for further testing.  This des ign has a  4.6% 
chance of accepting the treatment for further testing if the true response rate is ≤ 5 % (type 1 error 
= 0.046), and 85% power (type 2 error = 0. 15) of accepting the treatment for further testing if the 
true response rate is at least 20 %.  Th e maximal accrual will be 41 evaluable patients.  The 
probability of early termination is 72% under the null hypothesis . 
 
Stopping rule 2:  The second early stopping rule applies to the high perfusion CT subgroup.  
Analyses will be applied after completion of stage 1 of the minimax design and application of 
Stopping rule 1. Our target response rate in this putatively favorable subgr oup (baseline BV > 
5.25 and baseline PS > 25) is at least 30%.  If the observed response rate is unlikely to reach 30% 
in this s ubgroup, the  trial will be stopped early.  The second early stopping rule will be evaluated 
after at least 9 evaluable patients are enrolled in the subgroup with both high BV (baseline BV > 
5.25) and high PS (baseline PS > 25). If there is no responder in both the high BV and the high 
PS subgroup when at least 9 evaluable patients are enrolled, the trial will be stopped early.  
Otherwise, that is, if at least one response is observed in this subgroup, the trial will continue.  
This stopping rule will have a t least 96% power if the response rate is 30% of higher in this 
favorable subgroup.   
 
When both the first and second stopping rules are considered together, the trial will be stopped 
early when either of the rules reaches the stopping boundaries. As a res ult, the trial will be 
stopped early when either the response rate is low in the overall group or in the favorable 
subgroup.  
 
Stopping rule 3:  The third early stopping rule applies to the low perfusion CT subgroups. 
Analysis will be applied after completio n of stage 1 of the minimax design and application of 
Stopping rules 1 and 2 if there are at least 18 patients in the low BV subgroup or the low PS 
group. The goal of the stopping rule is to stop enrollment of patients to the putative unfavorable 
group if patients in the group are unlikely to benefit from therapy. Based on the historical 
sunitinib phase 3 study, the response rate to sunitinib is 9% (90% CI, 5% – 16%). If no 
responders are observed among at least 18 evaluable patients, we can rule out a resp onse rate of 
16% or higher with 95% power and the subgroup would terminate.  
 
At the end of the study, 90% exact confidence interval will be constructed for the overall group 
and for all the marker subgroups respectively. In addition, we will test  the hypo thesis that 
baseline perfusion CT parameters can predict which patients with advanced pNETs will 
respond to treatment with  Ziv-aflibercept . All enrolled patients will have baseline perfusion 
CT. Threshold for baseline BV (5.25 ml/100gram) and PS (25 ml/min ute/100gram) were 
established from prior studies of VEGF inhibitors among patients with pancreatic NET treated at 
M. D. Anderson. Approximate ly 60% of pancreatic NET had baseline BV > 5.25 and 
approximate ly 60% had baseline PS > 25. The following RECIST re sponse rates were observed 
by baseline measurements.  
 
Baseline BV  Baseline PS  
BV < 5.25  BV > 5.25  PS < 25  PS > 25

The planned sample size is 41 patients. The expected accrual rate is approximately 3 patients per 
mont hs. 
 
The following accrual targets for gender, race, and ethnicity are based on analyses of 371 
patients with pancreatic NETs seen at University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. By 
gender 47% were female; 53% were male. By ethnicity, 8% were Hispanic  or Latino. By race, 
3% were Asian; 8% were black; 88% were white.

13.3 Analysis of Secondary  and Exploratory  Endpoints  
 
Due to the phase II nature of this study and the high correlation between the two pCT endpoints , 
no formal adjustment will be made for multiple analyses of secondary and exploratory study 
objectives.  
 
Analysis plan for secondary study objectives : 
▪ Estimate progression free survival  (PFS) duration among patients treated with  ziv-
aflibercept .  
PFS will be calculated from the date of study registration for al l eligible  patients using the 
Kaplan Meier method and reported with confidence interval.  
 
▪ Evaluate the relationship between response rate and baseline BV and betwee n response rate 
and baseline PS.  
In addition to hypothesis testing using externally generate d cut -points, refinement of o ptimal 
cut point s in baseline BV and baseline PS separating responders and non -responders will be 
performed.  
• Receiver operating characteristic  (ROC) curves will be generated for both parameters.  
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
55 • Response rates of pCT subgroup s defined by these cut -points will be compared using chi -
square test.  
• Response profiles of pCT subgroups defined by these cut -points will be compared using 
non-parametric test (Wilcoxon rank sum test).  
 
Analysis plan for exploratory study objectives:  
• Dete rmine whether post -treatment changes in BV expressed as relative change from baseline 
correlate with response to  ziv-aflibercept . 
o Median will be used as cut point for correlation of post-treatment changes in BV 
expressed as relative change from baseline  with response.  
o Response rates will be compared using chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test whenever 
appropriate.  
o Response profiles will be compared using non -parametric test (Wilcoxon rank sum 
test).  
 
• Determine whether post -treatment tumor blood flow ( BF) (absolute measurement) correlate s 
with response to  ziv-aflibercept  
o Median will be used as cut point for correlation of post-treatment tumor blood flow 
(BF) (absolute measurement)  with response.  
o Response rates will be compared using chi -square test or Fis her’s exact test whenever 
appropriate.  
o Response rates will be compared using chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test whenever 
appropriate.  
 
• Determine whether post -treatment changes in BF  and, BV , expressed as relative change from 
baseline , correlate with relative change in sum of tumor diameters (RECIST 1.1 
measurements)  
o Continuous parameters in relative change in pCT parameters will be plotted against 
best relative change in sum of tumor diameters from RECIST 1.1 tumor 
measurements.  
o Pearson correlation wi ll be used to test statistical significance. Non -parametric test 
will be used if appropriate.  
 
• Determine the effect of  ziv-aflibercept  therapy on post -treatment blood flow (BF), BV, mean 
transit time (MTT), and PS at 4 weeks after treatment  
o Descriptive sta tistics of p re and post treatment value s will be given.  
o Distribution of pre and post treatment values will be graphed  
o Treatment induced change in values will be compared using paired -t test. Non -
parametric test will be used if appropriate.  
 
• Evaluate the ch anges in tumor perfusion parameters at time of progression  
o Summary statistics will be given to describe change from baseline and change from 
post treatment pCT.  
o Differences will be compared using paired -t test. Non -parametric test will be used if 
appropri ate.

13.4 For p hase 2 protocols  only: Reporting and Exclusions  
 
13.4.1  Evaluation of T oxicity  
 
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with  Ziv-
aflibercept . 
 
13.4.2  Evaluation of R esponse  
 
All patients included in the study must b e assessed for response to treatment, even if there 
are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be 
assigned one of the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) 
stable disease, 4) progres sive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early 
death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, 
insufficient data).  [Note:  By arbitrary convention, category 9 usually designates the 
“unknown” statu s of any type of data in a clinical database.]  
 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those 
who received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the 
response rate.  Patients in response  categories 4 -9 should be considered to have a 
treatment failure (disease progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug 
administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.  Precise 
definitions for categories 4 -9 will be protocol specific.  
 
All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients.  Subanalyses may then be 
performed on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for whom major protocol 
deviations have been identified ( e.g., early death du e to other reasons, early 
discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.).  However, these 
subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment 
efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis  should be clearly 
reported.  The 95% confidence intervals should also be provided.

APPENDIX B  CTEP M ULTICENTER  GUIDELINES  
 
If an institution wishes to collaborate with other participating institutions in performing a 
CTEP sponsored research protocol, then the following guidelines mu st be followed.  
 
Responsibility of the Protocol Chair  
• The Protocol Chair will be the single liaison with the CTEP Protocol and Information 
Office (PIO).  The Protocol Chair is responsible for the coordination, development, 
submission, and approval of the protocol as well as its subsequent amendments.  The 
protocol must not be rewritten or modified by anyone other than the Protocol Chair.  
There will be only one version of the protocol, and each participating institution will use 
that document.  The Protoco l Chair is responsible for assuring that all participating 
institutions are using the correct version of the protocol.  
• The Protocol Chair is responsible for the overall conduct of the study at all participating 
institutions and for monitoring its progress.   All reporting requirements to CTEP are the 
responsibility of the Protocol Chair.  
• The Protocol Chair is responsible for the timely review of Adverse Events (AE) to assure 
safety of the patients.  
• The Protocol Chair will be responsible for the review of an d timely submission of data 
for study analysis.  
 
Responsibilities of the Coordinating Center  
• Each participating institution will have an appropriate assurance on file with the Office 
for Human Research Protection (OHRP), NIH.   The Coordinating Center is re sponsible 
for assuring that each participating institution has an OHRP assurance and must maintain 
copies of IRB approvals from each participating site.  
• Prior to the activation of the protocol at each participating institution, an OHRP form 310 
(documenta tion of IRB approval) must be submitted to the CTEP PIO.  
• The Coordinating Center is responsible for central patient registration.  The Coordinating 
Center is responsible for assuring that IRB approval has been obtained at each 
participating site prior to t he first patient registration from that site.  
• The Coordinating Center is responsible for the preparation of all submitted data for 
review by the Protocol Chair.  
• The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of AE reports.  There are two 
options for A E reporting: (1) participating institutions may report directly to CTEP with a 
copy to the Coordinating Center, or (2) participating institutions report to the 
Coordinating Center who in turn report to CTEP.  The Coordinating Center will submit 
AE reports to the Protocol Chair for timely review.  
• Audits may be accomplished in one of two ways:  (1) source documents and research 
records for selected patients are brought from participating sites to the Coordinating 
Center for audit, or (2) selected patient reco rds may be audited on -site at participating 
sites.  If the NCI chooses to have an audit at the Coordinating Center, then the 
Coordinating Center is responsible for having all source documents, research records, all 
IRB approval documents, NCI Drug Accounta bility Record forms, patient registration 
lists, response assessments scans, x -rays, etc. available for the audit.  
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
61 Inclusion of Multicenter Guidelines in the Protocol  
• The protocol must include the following minimum information:  
➢ The title page must include  the name and address of each participating institution and 
the name, telephone number and e -mail address of the responsible investigator at each 
participating institution.  
➢ The Coordinating Center must be designated on the title page.  
➢ Central registration of patients is required.  The procedures for registration must be 
stated in the protocol.  
➢ Data collection forms should be of a common format.  Sample forms should be 
submitted with the protocol.  The frequency and timing of data submission forms to 
the Coo rdinating Center should be stated.  
➢ Describe how AEs will be reported from the participating institutions, either directly 
to CTEP or through the Coordinating Center.  
➢ Describe how Safety Reports and Action Letters from CTEP will be distributed to 
participat ing institutions.  
 
Agent Ordering  
• Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will order DCTD -
supplied investigational agents directly from CTEP.  Investigational agents may be 
ordered by a participating site only after the initial  IRB approval for the site has been 
forwarded by the Coordinating Center to the CTEP PIO.

APPENDIX C  NEW YORK HEART ASSOC IATION CLASSIFICATIO N OF 
FUNCTIONAL CARDIAC C APACITY  
 
 
Class I  Patients with cardiac disease but without resulting limitation o f physical activity. 
Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or 
anginal pain.  
Class II  Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. 
They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physica l activity results in fatigue, 
palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.  
Class III  Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. 
They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, 
palpitation, dyspn ea, or anginal pain.  
Class IV  Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity 
without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure or the anginal syndrome may be 
present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken,  discomfort is increased.

Protocol Deviation:  Noncompliance with the protocol that does not have a 
significant effect on the subject’s rights, safety, welfare, and/or the integrity of 
the d ata. Deviations may be caused by the action of the subject, the 
investigator, the research staff, or natural events.  
 
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
73 Protocol Violation:  Changes to protocol procedures without prior approval of 
the IRB/Sponsor. These changes may have a significant effect on the subject’s 
rights, safety, welfare, and/or the integrity of the data, and may cause an 
unanticipated problem to the subject or others. Violations may also 
significantly alter the clinical effectiveness of the treatment or the evaluation of 
its toxici ty.  
 
Procedures for Reporting Protocol Violations/Deviations  
 
Participating Institutions:  Protocol violations/deviations occurring at a 
participating institution will be submitted to that site’s own IRB.   A copy of 
the participating institution’s IRB vi olation/deviation report will be 
forwarded to the MDACC NCISS within 7 calendar days after the original 
submission.  
 
Coordinating Center:  Upon receipt of the violation/deviation report from the 
participating institution, MDACC NCISS will submit the repor t to the MDACC 
PI for review.  
 
Data Collection  
 
The Clinical Oncology Research System (CORe) is a web based database that is used for 
patient registration (for Phase I, Phase I/II and Phase II trials) and data entry (for Phase 
I/II, II trials).  CORe can be accessed at www.oncologyresearch.org  .  Study staff at 
participating institutions will be provided with a username and password for CORe at the 
time of study activation.  
  
• Patient Registration:  All patient s, regardless of the phase of the trial , will be 
registered in CORe prior to beginning treatment.   
At the time of registration portions of a patient’s protected health information 
will need to be entered. In order for the site to enter this information th e 
patient must have signed an informed consent document, which includes an 
authorization for the release of protected personal health information (IC/A). 
The authorization that each institution obtains to use and disclose protected 
health information must  include MD Anderson Cancer Center as an entity that 
they will share data with. This consent and authorization (IC/A) document 
authorizes MD Anderson Cancer Center  to collect and retain documents, 
reports, and/or information which relate to the patient’s pa rticipation on the 
protocol. This document also authorizes MD Anderson Cancer Center to send 
data and/or composite data for the entire study to each site participating in the 
trial.  
 
• Data Entry:  Enter data in CORe according to the following data schedule

Specifics Regarding Phase II Trials  
• Data Locks:  Data will be transmitted to NCI quarterly on January 31, April 30, July 
31, and October 31.  Approximately 3 weeks prior to the transmission date, the 
participating institution will be info rmed by MDACC NCISS that the data will be 
locked during data transmissions.  During this period of data lock, no new patient 
data and/or changes to previously entered data should be made unless instructed by 
MDACC NCISS.  
 
• Data Queries:  Following data tran smission NCI will issue an error log to MDACC 
NCISS detailing any corrections that need to be made to data prior to protocol 
acceptance.  MDACC NCISS will communicate the required changes to the 
participating institution. NCISS will periodically review the  data for completeness. 
You may receive queries directly from NCISS prior to data submission to the NCI.  
Required data corrections must be completed as instructed by MDACC NCISS.  
 
4.0 PATIENT C ONFIDENTIALITY AND AUTHORIZATION STATEMENT  
 
The Health Insuran ce Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 contains,  as one of its six 
major components, the requirement to create privacy standards for health care information that is 
used or  disclosed in the course of treatment, payment or health care operations.   The original 
Privacy Rule, as it has come to be known, was published in December 2000.  The Final Rule was 
published on August 14, 2002, which has modified the privacy rule in significant ways vis -à-vis 
research.  
 
In order for covered entities to use or dis close protected health information during the course of 
an MDACC Multicenter trial the participant in the trial must sign an authorization form.  This 
Authorization may or may not be separate from the Informed Consent.  The Authorization may 
require local IRB approval before presentation to a potential trial participant.  The participating 
institution, with the approval from the NCI/CTEP and MDACC, will provide an Informed 
Consent template, which covered entities, must use.  
 
MDACC and participating institu tions will attempt to limit its use of protected health 
information in its trials.  However, because of the nature of these trials, certain protected health 
information must be collected per National Cancer Institute requirements. These are the primary 
reasons why MDACC has chosen to use Authorizations, signed by the participant on the trial, 
rather than limited data sets with data use agreements.  
 
 
5.0 ON-SITE AUDITING  
 
Purpose of Audit  
 
To ensure that the data analyzed to determine study results accurate ly reflect the primary 
source documents and that any clinical study was conducted in accordance with an 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved protocol. The audit program  reviews protocol 
management in the following categories: eligibility, informed con sent, treatment, disease 
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
76 outcome/response, toxicity, and general data quality. Compliance with all federal, National 
Cancer Institute and institutional requirements for the protection of human subjects is also 
assessed.  
 
In addition, the audit program pro vides education to the research staff regarding issues 
identified during the audit and assists research teams to develop appropriate ways to correct 
deficiencies identified by the audit.  
 
 
Selection for Audit  
 
Participating institutions can be selected fo r audit at any time.  Audit will generally be 
performed on a random basis and may occur at 6 – 12 month intervals.  
 
 
Audit Notification  
 
The participating institution principal investigator (PI) and study coordinator shall be notified 
two to four weeks in advance of the audit start date.  If the audit is initiated due to suspected 
deficiencies the advance notice may be shorter than 2 weeks.  All audit notifications shall be 
delivered to the PI and study coordinator by e -mail.  It is important that a person who is 
familiar with the research protocol and the study subjects enrolled on the trial be available 
(but not necessarily present) during the audit to assist the auditors in locating documentation 
that may be difficult to find in the primary medical record .  
 
The notification will include:  
• The date of the audit  
• A list of the patient records to be audited  
• A list of documents required for the audit  
 
 
Responsibilities of Participants in the Audit  
 
Clinical Trials Auditors: If more than one auditor visits the s ite a lead auditor will be 
designated to guide the audit process.  It shall be the auditor’s responsibility to print a copy 
of the protocol and be familiar with the study prior to the start of the audit.  
 
Principal Investigator and Research Staff: The prin cipal investigator is responsible for 
assuring that all requested audit materials are available at the time of the audit.  These 
materials shall include the following:  
 
• One copy of an original signed and dated informed consent document (ICD) for 
each parti cipant. For patients who have been re -consented while on  study, an 
original signed and dated informed consent must be available for each IRB -
approved version of the informed consent.  
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
77 • All patient records:  in -patient charts (if applicable), protocol -specifi c patient 
source documents (signed and dated pill diaries, symptom records), database 
printouts, and patient research files  
• Correspondence and source documentation from outside institutions pertaining to 
patient research data  
• Radiology films and other spec ified studies, if requested  
• Any operative, pathology and radiotherapy reports required by protocol  
• Regulatory Binder  
  
The research staff must have all patient research charts and the Regulatory Binder 
organized in a systematic and consistent fashion. The presence of organized study records 
reduces the potential for queries and helps prevent repeated questions to the study 
coordinator / PI requesting assistance in locating items during the audit.  
 
Conducting the Audit  
 
Medical Record Review: At the time of  the medical record audit, source documentation 
shall be reviewed and used to independently verify study data. Data quality shall be 
assessed by measuring it against the standards for optimal data collection as defined in the 
research protocol.  Data enter ed in CORE should match precisely with the corresponding 
information on the primary source document.  
 
The research team shall also be evaluated on protocol compliance with the study schedule, 
regulatory requirements, and guidelines for Good Clinical Pract ice (GCP).  Although the 
PI may delegate responsibilities for various aspects of the protocol management, the PI 
alone retains ultimate responsibility for the conduct of the clinical trial.  
 
The following elements are reviewed during the audit:  
 
Activation /Continuing Review Information : The auditor shall verify that:  
• IRB approval has been obtained prior to study activation and patient enrollment;  
• An annual continuing review has been completed within 365 days from initial 
date of approval;  
• Confirmation tha t all consenting physicians have a current NCI Investigator 
Registration number  
• Protocol amendment, informed consent, and IRB approval dates are appropriate;  
• Patients were treated following CORe registration.  
• All regulatory documents are in the regulatory  binder(s)  
 
Informed Consent Document :  The ICD must:  
• Be the appropriate IRB -approved version at the time the patient was enrolled. For 
NCI studies, the ICD must also have received NCI’s approval before it is used in 
obtaining informed consent.  
• Contain th e patient’s signature and date;  
• Contain the signature and date of the person who is obtaining the informed 
consent;  
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
78 • Contain the signature of the witness and date it was signed; if applicable  
• Indicate selection of optional studies verified by patient initia ls  
• List M. D. Anderson as an authorized reviewer on ICD's from outside institutions 
(where M. D. Anderson serves as the lead institution on a multicenter trial). On 
multicenter trials where M. D. Anderson is not the lead site, any institution that 
may req uest protected health information should be listed in the HIPAA section of 
the M. D. Anderson ICD.  
 
The informed consent process must be documented in the on -study note located in each 
patient’s medical record.  
 
Eligibility : The eligibility checklist is co mpared against the primary medical record to 
confirm that all criteria were met prior to registration on the trial. If documentation cannot 
be located, eligibility is noted as “unable to confirm” due to insufficient data. The patient 
shall be considered in eligible if one or more of the eligibility requirements were not 
satisfied.  
 
Protocol Compliance : Source documentation is used to verify that the performance status 
has been assessed and that the results of all required tests have been obtained within the  
protocol -specified time frame prior to the start of treatment. On -study visits, lab tests, and 
diagnostic studies shall be checked for adherence to the study schedule. If testing or visits 
were missed, the auditor shall verify that a protocol deviation/vi olation report was 
completed for each occurrence and submitted to the IRB, and a copy placed in the 
Regulatory Binder. A deviation log may be utilized as per institutional policy.  
 
Treatment Administration :  The audit team confirms that patients receive th e correct dose, 
route, dosing interval, and timing of the treatment administered.  Dose modifications shall 
also be checked and compared against the protocol.  The auditor shall assure that the 
proper body surface area (BSA) was calculated. The auditor sha ll also check the medical 
record for correct and consistent recording of the study subject’s weight and shall look for 
dose adjustments based on body weight changes as defined in the protocol.  
 
Disease Outcome / Response : The auditor shall verify baseline  and on -study disease status 
by reviewing tumor measurements analyses in the medical record/research file. Solid 
tumor measurements shall be compared to imaging reports and/or original radiology films 
to confirm tumor response. For hematologic tumors, docu mented response shall be verified 
using appropriate analyses as stated in the protocol. If the auditor cannot verify the 
outcome response, a physician auditor shall be consulted for a final decision.  
 
Toxicity : All toxicities shall be documented in the med ical record or recorded on patient 
data forms.  These shall include the appropriate Common Toxicity Criteria term to 
describe the toxicity, the grade of toxicity, the attribution, date of onset, and date of 
resolution.  The auditor shall confirm that all p atients have been followed for toxicities for 
thirty days from the last date of protocol therapy. When a SAE occurs, the auditor shall 
verify that initial and follow -up reporting is appropriate as required in the Code of Federal 
Regulations and in accordan ce to NCI / CTEP’s policy.  
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
79  
General Data Quality : This category concerns the quality and completeness of source 
documentation as well as the accuracy of data transcription from the source document to 
the case report form.  Emphasis shall be placed on clear  and complete reporting of the 
findings and correct matching of all data elements.  Any inconsistent, incomplete, illegible, 
or hard to follow records shall be noted.  Comments shall be made regarding repeated 
discrepancies that appear to affect the validi ty of the data or indicate that the management 
of the protocol needs more oversight.  
 
Audit Findings  
 
• Following completion of the audit, a preliminary audit findings report will be completed 
and be presented at the Audit Findings meeting or the “Exit Inter view meeting”.  
• The purpose of the exit interview is to provide an opportunity for education, clarification, 
immediate dialogue, and feedback. It is not intended as a time to resolve all of the issues 
noted in the audit findings.  
• The principal investigator and the study coordinator responsible for the study being audited 
are required to attend.  Additional research staff associated with the study is encouraged to 
attend as well.  
• As time allows, the lead auditor shall educate the research team in interpretati on of the 
various regulatory requirements / institutional policies and shall provide guidance on the 
development of a corrective action plan to address issues involving major deficiencies.  
• At the conclusion of the exit interview, the lead auditor may also discuss best practice 
guidelines and offer suggestions for improvement on data collection and protocol 
management.   
• Following the exit interview the lead auditor shall amend the audit findings to include any 
corrections/clarifications noted during the exi t interview.    
• Once the audit findings have been modified, the lead auditor shall send a return receipt e -
mail containing a copy of the audit findings to the PI and study coordinator.   
• Upon receipt of the e -mail, the research team shall have two weeks to  respond and return 
the audit findings to the lead auditor.   
• The PI/study coordinator shall be responsible for providing a written response to each of 
the findings cited during the audit.  
• To properly respond to the audit findings, the research team must e nter a response 
immediately below each query.  All research team responses shall be entered in red directly 
onto the audit findings document.   
• When appropriate, a corrective action plan shall be included to complete the response.  
• In situations where the l ead auditor must review a source document to verify a research 
team response, the study coordinator shall provide a photocopy of this source document. 
All photocopies must be provided to the lead auditor by the deadline for audit response 
noted in the e -mail. 
• Once all of the queries have been addressed and the response is complete, both the 
individual preparing the document and the PI for the study must print out and sign one 
copy of the audit findings report.  An electronic copy of the same document shall be e-
mailed to the lead auditor.  
NCI Protocol #:  9604  
Version Date:  1/11/18  
80 • Once the lead auditor receives the electronic copy of the response to the audit findings, he 
or she shall review the explanations/corrective action plans and shall create a summary 
report of outstanding audit findings, PI responses and any other audit activities.  
• The final audit report will be forwarded to the Lead PI, the MD Anderson IRB.

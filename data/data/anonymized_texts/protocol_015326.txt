Methodology This  study is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel -group s
tudy.  
Adult patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), and 
body mass index ( BMI)
 ≥18.5 kg/m2 who have inadequate glycemic 
control with insulin  therapy (administered by subcutaneous injections 
or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII])  are eligible for 
enrollment in this study as long as they meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria.  
Patients will continue treatment with insulin(s) or insulin analog(s) 
during the study. During the study, self -moni 
tored blood glucose 
(SMBG) values will be reviewed by the Investigator and insulin doses 
adjusted if the SMBG trends do not meet standard of care (SOC) T1D target goals.  
Note:  Subsequently,  in this document, the term “insu
 lin” includes 
insulin analog(s). The term “insulin analog” may also appear, as needed for clarity. Bolus insulin refers to regular insulin or fast -acting 
insulin analog administered via subcutaneous (SC) or inhaled route.

All patients will have a Screening Period of up to 2 weeks. The 
single-blind placebo Run- in Period will begin at Week -2. In order to 
qualify for randomization, patients must demonstrate ≥80% 
compliance to taking the expected amount of placebo tablets durin g 
the Run-in Period.  
Following randomization, patients will have a 24 -week double -blind 
Treatment Period and a 30 -day Follow -up Period. Thirty days after 
the last dose of double -blind study drug a telephone call will be made 
to all patients to record info rmation on serious adverse events (SAEs), 
events of special interest (EOSI), and any adverse event (AE) that was ongoing at the time of the End -of-Treatment (EOT) or Early 
Withdrawal (EW) visit.  
Approximately 1400 patients ≥18 years of age will be randoml y 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio between the follo
wing 2 treatment groups, as 
an adjunct to their insulin therapy:  
•Sotagliflozin  400 mg as two (2) 200 -mg tablets, once daily, before
the first meal of the day
•Placebo as two (2) placebo tablets (identical to sotagliflozin in
appearance), once daily, befo
re the first meal of the day
The treatment randomization schedule will be centralized and stratified by BMI at Screening (<25 kg/m
2, ≥25 kg/m2), Week -2 A1C 
(≤9%, >9%) and use of CSII at Screening (Yes, No). The des ired 
balances will be accomplished by use of randomly permuted blocks of fixed size.  
The glycemic goals recommended for this study are to treat A1C and blood glucose to the following targets
: A1C <7.0%, 
fasting/preprandial capillary plasma glucose 80 -130 mg/dL 
(4.4-7.2 mmol/L), and 2 -hour/peak postprandial capillary plasma 
glucose <180 mg/dL (<10.0 mmol/L). Goals may be adapted based on 
individual patient considerations consistent with American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) Guidelines.  
Insulin adjustment algorithms will be provided in the Site File Notebook to serve as reference, which 
may be modified based on the 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 of 130 

Protoc ol No. LX4211.312 
Investigator’s clinical assessment. 
In order to avoid influencing the patients’ and or Investi gators’ 
behavior, A1C and FPG results will be masked to study staff after 
randomization laboratories have been obtained. However, if the A1C 
is >11.0% at Week 16 or any determination thereafter, the value will 
be unmasked to the study sites to allow for appropriate diabetic management. In addition, the central laboratory urinalysis (UA) will not report urine glucose results to maintain the blind.  
Adjudication of all deaths, EOSI, including major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)/other 
cardiovascular (CV)  events, 
clinical or laboratory findings associated with potential drug -induced 
liver injury (DILI), severe hypoglycemia (or hypoglycemia reported 
as an SAE), and DKA events will be performed in a blinded manner 
by independent Clinical Endpoint Committee(s ) (CEC[s]) composed 
of the appropriate experts. Details will be provided in the CEC Charter(s).  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will meet on a regular basis to review accumulating cli
nical study safety data. 
Following each meeting, the DMC will make a recommendation to 
the Sponsor regarding the study. Details describing the DMC 
processes and procedures are outlined in a separate DMC Charter. To maintain continuous blinding and study integrity, the analysis will 
be conducted by an independent statistician, and measures will be 
taken to ensure the validity of the data and integrity of the study's conduct. 
This study will also include a substudy in which patients will use a daily diary for the self -assessment
 of satiety (appetite). The substudy 
will include a subset of enrolled patients.  
The study design is presented graphically below:

with any aspect of study conduct or interpretation of results. 
The Investigator or the Sponsor will supply justification for 
exclusion, if applicable.  
Sample Size 
Determination  The sample size will be based on satisfying design assumptions made for the primary efficacy endpoint. The primary efficacy 
endpoint is a binomial proportion, a composite measure of glycemic control and safety. We have assumed that the majority of treatment effect will be observed in the glycemic control portion of the endpoint and for planning purposes, the rates of severe 
hypoglycemia and DKA will be equal in both treatment groups. Little data are available to estimate the <7% A1C component of the endpoint in this patient population. Data reviewed from the 
LX4211.1- 202 Phase 2 trial in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
patients and from other pertinent literature sources suggests that a 
difference between treatment groups of at least 0.15 may be expected for this variable. We will assume this effect size for the primary end point, but will perform an adjustment for the expected 
proportion of patients not having a DKA or severe hypoglycemia event. A conservative assumption is made that the rates of DKA and severe hypoglycemia are independent and their union is estimated 
to be ≤0.15. It is expected that 0.85 of the patients will not have a 
DKA or a severe hypoglycemic event over the course of the study. 
Adjusting the 0.15 effect size estimate by this value yields a target effect size for the primary endpoint ≈0.12. Since the und erlying 
placebo rate is unknown for the composite outcome, we will assume a maximum variance construct under the alternative hypothesis for binomial proportions to estimate the sample size (ie, the mean of the pooled response rates is 0.50). Assuming a 
2-sided test with α = 0.05 and 90% power, 380 patients are needed 
per treatment group to detect a difference in binomial proportions of at least 0.12 for the primary endpoint. The sample size estimate will be adjusted for dropouts in a manner to reflect that the primary 
analysis will be conducted in the modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) 
patients. Dropouts are expected to be primarily a function of noncompliance: patients stopping early their randomized treatment, 
but followed to the 24- week visit. It is further assumed that the 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 130 

Protoc ol No. LX4211.312 
dropped (noncompliant) sotagliflozin patients will respond as the 
placebo patients and that there will be no drop -in patients in the 
placebo group. These assumptions net an adjusted effect size for 
detection of 0.12 x (1- 0.20) ≈ 0.10, wher e the dropout rate over 24 
weeks is assumed to be 20%. Based on this adjusted effect size, 544 patients are required per treatment group, for a total of 1088 patients across the 2 treatment groups.  
The occurrence of severe hypoglycemia is an important safety 
component of the primary endpoint. It is desirable that the study sample includes enough patients so that a reliable estimate of treatment difference can be obtained for this outcome. Based on a literature review, it seems reasonable to assume that the rate of 
severe hypoglycemia, defined as the number of patients experiencing at least 1 such episode divided by the number of mITT patients (ie, a binomial proportion), is ≤0.10 over a 24 -week period. 
We will assume this rate is the same in both treatment groups, yielding an expected difference of 0.0. A 2- sided 95% confidence 
interval (CI) based on normal approximation methods and corrected 
for continuity is associated with a distance value (ω) of 0.033 for a 
sample size of 700 patients per group; ω is the extended distance 
from the observed difference in one or both directions. The upper bound of this CI will exclude values greater than 0.05; ie, a 50% increase in the expected placebo rate.  
Based on the considerations mentioned above, a sample size of 700 
patients per treatment group (1400 tota
l patients) seems to be an 
appropriate target for the study.  
For the satiety substudy, assuming a dropout rate of 20% over the 
course of the study, a sample size 
of approximately 224 patients 
(112 per treatment group) demonstrating a change greater than 30% 
would be necessary to obtain statistical power at the recommended 0.80 level (alpha = 0.05). To achieve this number of patients for evaluation, 280 patients will be recruited to participate in the substudy. 
Statistical Methods  All primary efficacy analyses will be based on the mITT 
population. Supportive analysis of the
 efficacy data will be 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 130 

Protoc ol No. LX4211.312 
performed using the Per -protocol (PP) population.  
Primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint at Week 24 will 
use a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by BMI at 
Screening (<25 kg/m2, ≥25 kg/m2), Week -2 A1C (≤9%, >9%) and 
use of CSII at Screening (Yes, No).  Missing observations will be 
imputed as non -responders. A point estimate of treatment effect will 
be based on the sotagliflozin minus difference in binomial proportions. A 2 -sided 95% CI will be estimated on the observed 
difference and will be based on no rmal approximation methods 
using a continuity correction factor. The individual components of 
the endpoint will be summarized separately using descriptive statistics. 
Sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint will use a single imputation method to obtai n a rectangular dataset. Imputations will 
be based on use of the last observation carried forward (LOCF) algorithm. The stratified CMH test will be applied to this imputed dataset. The stratified CMH test will also be applied to the PP dataset as an additi onal sensitivity analysis.  
Primary analysis of the continuous efficacy endpoints will use 
mixed-effects model for repeated 
measures (MMRM) statistics 
based on the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method for 
estimation. The analysis model will include f ixed, categorical 
effects of treatment, BMI at Screening (<25 kg/m2, ≥25 kg/m2),
Week -2 A1C (≤9%, >9%) and use of CSII at Screening (Yes, No), 
ti
me (study week), baseline -dependent variable -by-time interaction, 
and a treatment -by-time interaction. An unst ructured (co)variance 
structure will be used to model the within -patient errors. Other 
structures will be explored by use of Akaike’s information criteria should the unstructured (co)variance structure not result in model convergence. The Kenward -Roger app roximation will be used to 
estimate the denominator degrees of freedom. The adjusted mean change from Baseline by each study week for each treatment group will be estimated in the framework of this model, as well as the between-group differences (comparing  sotagliflozin to placebo) and 
the 95% CIs for the adjusted mean. All post-Baseline observations 
collected at scheduled visits will be used in the MMRM, including 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 130 

Protoc ol No. LX4211.312 
data collected after the discontinuation of study drug. An analysis 
of covariance (ANCOVA) will be applied where only 
1 post-Baseline scheduled visit occurs; ie, the MMRM analysis 
omitting the time -related effects.  
For binary endpoints estimated as binomial proportions, the frequency and proportion of patients achieving the outcome will be presented by treatment group at each assessed study week. The 
primary analysis of these endpoints will use a CMH test stratified by the different levels of the randomization stratification factors of BMI at Screening (<25 kg/m
2, ≥25 kg/m2), Week -2 A1C (≤9%, 
>9%) and use of CSII at Screening (Yes, No). These treatment 
group comparisons will be performed at Week 24 only. The earlier 
study weeks will use descriptive analyses to summarize the data. 
These descriptive statistics will include the patient counts and prop
ortions, point estimates of treatment effect, and 95% CIs of the 
treatment effect. Missing observations at Week 24 will be imputed as non-responders; only the observed data will be summarized at 
the earlier study visits. Endpoints comprised of multiple out comes 
will use descriptive methods to summarize each component by 
treatment group at each study week.  
The test for superiority of sotagliflozin versus placebo based on the 
primary efficacy endpoint will be performed at the 2-sided 
0.05 α-level. If this nul l hypothesis is rejected, a sequential 
procedure will be used to maintain the overall Type I error rate at a 2-sided, 0.05 α-level across analyses of the secondary endpoints at 
Week 24. The secondary endpoints will be specified in a hierarchy and the first  listed will be tested at the same Type I error used for 
the primary endpoint comparison (α = 0.05). If this test rejects the 
null hypothesis, then the next listed secondary endpoint will be tested at the same Type I error rate. This testing sequence will continue as long as the null hypothesis is rejected at the 0.05  α-
level. The testing sequence will be broken at the first instance that a null hypothesis is not rejected. Once the sequence is broken, no later hypothesis in the hierarchy will be tested. The order of testing 
will be:

Protoc ol No. LX4211.312 
1)A1C change from Baseline at Week 24
2)Body weight at Week 24 change from Baseline (absolute
and percent change; the absolute change will be used in thesequence of analyses)
3)SBP change from Baseline at Week 16 in the subset ofpatients with Baseline SBP ≥130 
mm Hg
4)Percent change from Baseline in bolus insulin dose atWeek 24
In addition, raw P -values and 95% CIs
 will be computed for tests of 
all secondary endpoint hypotheses. These raw or unadjusted statistics will be used as descriptive summaries of the data and will 
not be used for formal testing of the hypotheses.  
Safety Assessments  Safety and tolerability of sotagliflozin will be assessed by collection and analysis of AEs, EOSI, laboratory variables, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations.  
Safety Data Analysis  Anal ysis of the safety data will be based on the Safety Population. 
Additional analyses may be perfor
med on other populations or 
subpopulations.  
Safety analysis will be descriptive.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs 
reported after the first dose of 
double-blind study drug. Treatment -
emergent adverse event summaries will include the overall 
incidence (number of patients with the event) and number of events 
by system organ class and  preferred term, overall incidence sorted 
by descending frequency across treatment groups, events by maximum intensity, events by relationship to study treatment, and events leading to discontinuation of study drug; SAEs and EOSI will also be summarized. Listings will be provided for deaths, 
SAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs. Additional summaries or listings of AEs may also be provided.  
Vital signs, laboratory results, ECG results, and physical examination findings will be sum
marized descriptively at each time 
point. Actual and change from Baseline data will be calculated and 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18 of 130 

Protocol  No. LX4211.312 
summarized as appropriate. In addition, shift table analyses will be 
presented for the laboratory data.  
The efficacy analysis of hypoglycemic events will be conducted 
using MMRM and CMH tests. Since these data also serve as a 
measure of safety, additional analyses will be conducted. The first 
analysis will be performed using CMH tests stratified by the randomization factors at each clinic visit. These tests wi ll provide 
inferential and descriptive summaries of the relative risk estimate for each of the 2 hypoglycemic event definitions: ≤70 mg/dL by SMBG, and ≤55  mg/dL by SMBG. The patient incidence of these 
hypoglycemic events will be counted over the week prio r to the 
scheduled clinic visit used in the analysis. The second analysis of 
these data will examine the relative risk for each of the 
hypoglycemic event definitions over the entire Treatment Period by use of a generalized linear model (GLM). The GLM will include 
fixed, categorical effects of treatment, BMI at Screening (<25 kg/m
2, ≥25 kg/m2), Week -2 A1C (≤9%, >9%), use of CSII at 
Screening (Yes, No), and an offset term for study duration. The events will be modeled as a negative binomial process.  
Meta-analysis The occurrence of the following events will be statistically 
analyzed using data from this study combined with other Phase 2/3 
trials conducted in T1D and T2DM patients: severe hypoglycemia, DKA, DILI, and MACE. Details of the analysis models and r elated 
assumptions will be documented in separate meta- analysis plans.

3. Introduction
3.1 Background Sotagliflozin (LX4211) and Disease 
Incidence of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) varies widely globally, ranging from 0.1/100,000 
per year in China and Venezuela to 36.5/100,000 per year in Finland. [1] Every year in the 
United States (US), on average more 
than 15,000 young people under the age of 20 years are 
diagnosed with T1D (Centers for Disease Control, 2011). [2] Maintaining glycemic control 
without h ypoglycemia is a key therap
eutic goal in T1D, to foster both near -term and long -
term health. To date, this has only been achieved by maintaining strict dietary discipline with 
vigilant glucose monitoring linked to appropriate exogenous insulin use througho ut the day. 
Chronic insulin use to maintain tight glycemic control presents significant challenges for patients, both logistically and medically, with constant approximations and adjustments made 
to accommodate various meals and activity levels. The challe nges and inherent imperfections 
of such calculations contribute to the tendency of many T1D patients to maintain blood 
glucose levels at the high end or above recommended glycemic targets, in order to avoid the immediate dangers of hypoglycemia, ultimately  at the expense of suffering long -term 
consequences of chronic high blood sugar.  
Despite the broad availability of insulin therapy for T1D, there remain large segments of the patient population for whom adequat
e glycemic control is not consistently achieved. For 
example, according to the T1D registry, [3] (~30% <15 years old, ~70% <30 years old), of the 
26,127 total registrants, 23% have po
or glycemic control with inability to achieve a 
hemoglobin A1C (A1C) <9.0%, while ~17% of registrants with the same standards of care (SOC) and medical providers are able to attain an A1C <7.0%. It is likely that a spectrum of pathophysiological and socioeconomic driv ers contribute to the wide disparity in glycemic 
control that is observed, and that certain groups within the T1D population find it particularly difficult to maintain glycemic control with currently available therapies.  
Given the challenges associated with improving treatment outcomes for groups that have a 
history of especially poor contr
ol, there is a need to identify a safe and simple 
pharmacological treatment that can consistently improve glycemic control when added t o 
insulin regimens. Importantly, attention must also be given to the goal of improving the 
quality of life in T1D patients by reducing insulin injection burden and the need for strict glucose monitoring.  
3.1.1 The Potential Role of Dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 Inhibition 
Sotagliflozin (LX4211) is a novel, orally delivered, small molecule dual inhibitor of sodium -
glucose cotransporter type 1 (SGLT1) and sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 ( SGLT2) that 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
was designed to reduce glucose absorption in the gastrointesti nal (GI) tract via SGLT1 
inhibition and renal glucose reabsorption via SGLT2 inhibition. Lexicon’s studies of 
knockout mice lacking either SGLT1 or SGLT2, or both, led to the discovery that inhibiting both targets pharmacologically could achieve metabolic and glycemic control without 
causing hypoglycemia.  
Note: Sotagliflozin and investigational drug LX4211 are used interchangeably in this 
protocol. 
Because sotagliflozin i
s a dual inhibitor of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and is unlike the selective 
SGLT2 modulators currently in devel
opment, sotagliflozin provides a potentially unique 
mechanism of action.  
The sodium -glucose cotransporter ( SGLT) inhibitors currently approved for treatment of type 
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin[ 4] or empagliflozin [5]) or with 
clinical data in T1D, (dapa gliflozin 
and empagliflozin) are selective SGLT2 inhibitors and 
therefore primarily target the kidney, where SGLT2 reabsorbs ~90% of filtered glucose. 
SGLT1 is the primary transporter for absorption of glucose and galactose in the intestine. SGLT1 inhibiti on by sotagliflozin delays and reduces glucose absorption in the proximal 
intestine thereby improving postprandial glycemic control with lower peak glucose levels and decreased glycemic variability. In addition, more glucose delivery distally triggers incr eased 
L-cell release of glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1) and peptide YY  (PYY), a natural peptide 
hormone response associated with enhanced glycemic and appetite control, findings that have been substantiated with numerous animal and human mechanistic studie s.[6,7] The overall 
sotagliflozin treatment effect i
s a reduction in glucose load through a balanced inhibition of 
SGLT1 and SGLT2, offering the potential for T1D patients to achieve better glycemic control in combination with insulin therapies.  
With sotagliflo zin, the desirable effects of SGLT2 
 inhibition are maintained and 
complemented with SGLT1 inhibition in the GI tract to produce clinically meaningful reductions in postprandial glucose (PPG). The net result is improved glycemic control with 
lower urinary glucose excretion (UGE) than seen with selective SGLT2 inhibitors. The latter 
is an important finding which is predicted to allow sotagliflozin to maintain efficacy in patients with renal impairment as well as reduce the side effects  associated with high UG E 
such as genitourinary (GU) tract infections. Notably, a recently completed proof -of-concept 
study in 30 T2DM patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate  [eGFR] 15 -59 mL/min/1.73 m
2) randomly assigned 1:1 to placebo or 400 mg 
sotagliflozin showed a significant decrease in PPG excursion and an increase in GLP -1 
secretion in these patients with high unmet medical need, in which SGLT2 inhibitors have little efficacy, while maintaining a favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profile. After 1

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
week, patients on sotagliflozin had a 50-60 mg/dL reduction in PPG compared to Baseline. 
Notably, this difference was preserved in the patient subgroup with severe renal impairment; 
efficacy is usually reduced in patients with seve re renal impairment with selective SGLT2 
inhibitors.  
3.1.1.1 Potential Effects on Mealtime Glycemic Control 
Mealtime insulin without sotagliflozin : Under the current mealtime treatment paradigm for 
T1D, exogenous insulin administration determines both glycemic co ntrol (PPG excursion 
triggered by ingested carbohydrate) and energy flux (facilitated glucose transport into cells) – 
therefore coupling 2 treatment objectives with a single insulin dose. As a result, to maintain normoglycemia after carbohydrate ingestion,  which is usually excessive for most patients, the 
amount of insulin required is usually greater than the amount required for optimal energy flux 
over a very narrow range – resulting in a narrow therapeutic index.  
Mealtime insulin with sotagliflozin : Based on results from oral glucose tolerance tests 
(OGTT) in controlled settings in multiple studies, sotagliflozin’s unique dual mechanism of 
action is expected to act as a buffer against postprandial hyperglycemia with a daily capacity of approximately 60 -100 g glucose. In some individuals, this capacity could buffer the entire 
carbohydrate content of more than 1 meal a day. This is explained below.  
Assuming a 2000 calorie diet, and a diet consisting of 40% carbohydrates, 800 calories (200 g) is derived from  carbohydrates (for simplification, 100% of 
carbohydrates are assumed to be glucose). For a diet consisting of 60% carbohydrates, 1200 calories (300 g) is derived from carbohydrates. On average, each meal may contain 65 g of glucose in the 40% carbohydrate, 2000 calorie diet, and 100 g of glucose in the 60% carbohydrate diet.  
With the glucose -buffering capacity afforded by sotag
 liflozin, mealtime glycemic control is 
expected to be influenced by both mealtime insulin and sotagliflozin, thereby decoupling glycemic control from energy flux. As a result, it is expected that:  
•Energy flux will continue to be primarily determined by insulin dose.
•Glycemic control will be determined
 by both insulin dose and sotagliflozin, thereby
requiring lower insulin doses t
o maintain glycemic goals, and also less precision of
insulin dosing due to reduced variability in blood glucose.
•Less insulin will be required at mealtime to meet the goal of avoiding postprandialhyperglycemia.
•This will, in effect
, lower the insulin to carb ohydrate (I/C) ratio.

•This will result in a requirement for less mealtime insulin on board (IOB), for a given
amount of carbohydrate.
•Less mealtime IOB will lower the risk of hypoglycemia.
Current experience in humans is des
cribed in Section 3.5. 
3.2 Sotagliflozin Pharmacology  
Sotagliflozin is a dual inhibitor of SGLT1 and SGLT2, designed to reduce glucose absorption 
in the GI tract via SGLT1 inhibition  and renal glucose reabsorption via SGLT2 inhibition. 
Unlike selective SGLT2 modulators currently in development, sotagliflozin provides dual inhibition, representing a potentially unique mechanism of action.  
3.2.1 Studies in Mice  
3.2.1.1 Nondiabetic, Diet -induced, Obe se Mice 
Administration of single doses of sotagliflozin to nondiabetic mice improved glucose 
tolerance. Repeat -dose administration to diabetic mice not only improved glucose tolerance, 
but also lowered A1C.  
The acute effect of sotagliflozin on facilitating glucose excretion in the nondiabetic, diet -
induced, obese mouse was evaluated in 
5 studies, each of which examined a control and 1 or 
more of the following doses of sotagliflozin:  0.003, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 3, 10, 30, and 60 mg/kg.  
Sotagliflozin caused a d ose-dependent increase in glucose excreti on over the 24 -hour period 
immediately following dosing. The minimally effective dose was 0.1 mg/kg. The daily dose 
causing 50% maximal glucose excretion in the first 24 hours following dosing (ED 50) was 
calculated to be approximately 1.8  mg/kg. Single doses of 10 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg 
sotagliflozin caused a pharmacologic effect for at least 72 hours after dosing.  
The acute effect of sotagliflozin on oral glucose tolerance in the nondiabetic, diet -induced, 
obese mouse w as evaluated at th
e following doses:  0.03, 0.3, 3, and 30 mg/kg. Sotagliflozin 
produced a dose -dependent improvement in glucose tolerance. Based upon the area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) from Time 0 to Hour 4 values and, under these 
experimental conditions where sotagliflozin was concomitantly administered with dextrose at 
the start of the OGTT, the minimally effective dose of sotagliflozin for improving glucose 
tolerance in the normal mouse was found to be 3  mg/kg. 
3.2.1.2 Diabetic Mice  
The effect of repeated daily treatment with sotagliflozin on lowering blood glucose in the 
diabetic mouse was evaluated in 2 studies. The first study examined the effect of vehicle 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
versus sotagliflozin oral suspension (5 mL/kg dose volume) for 25 days at 1  and 10 mg/kg in 
mice with established hyperglycemia.  
Sotagliflozin, at both 1  mg/kg and 10  mg/kg, produced a decrease in A1C concentrations. The 
reduction following treatment with sotagliflozin failed to reach statistical significance due to 
an unexpected  decrease in A1C concentrations in the vehicle treated mice. Sotagliflozin did 
produce the expected significant increase in UGE. Fed blood glucose concentrations were 
also reduced by sotagliflozin.  
The second repeat -dose study in diabetic mice examined  the effect of sotagliflozin at 1  mg/kg 
on slowing the progression to severe hyperglycemia in young mice. Mice in the control group exhibited an increase in A1C, whereas mice treated with sotagliflozin did not exhibit such increases. UGE was increased with sot agliflozin, both at the start of dosing and at the end of 
the 5-week dosing period. In addition, diabetic mice treated with sotagliflozin daily for 5 
weeks exhibited improved glucose tolerance.  
3.2.2 Studies in Rats  
The acute effect of sotagliflozin on facilitating glucose excretion in the nondiabetic rat was evaluated in 4 studies, each of which examined a vehicle control and one or more of the 
following doses of sotagliflozin:  0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 50 mg/kg. Sotagliflozin resulted in a 
dose-dependent increase in glucose excretion during the first 24 hours following dosing. All 
doses evaluated produced a significant increase in glucose excretion. The ED
50 was 
calculated as 0.75  mg/kg; the effect increased with increasing dose up to the highest dose 
tested (50  mg/kg). At doses of 1  mg/kg and above, the pharmacologic effect of sotagliflozin 
was maintained for at least 2 days following a single oral dose.  
3.2.3 Studies in Dogs  
The acute effect of sotagliflozin on facilitating glucose excretion in the nondiabetic dog was evaluated in 2 studies, each of which included a predose (Baseline) control value and 1 of the 
following doses of sotagliflozin:  0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 3 mg/kg. Sotagliflozin 
resulted in a dose -dependent increase in glucose excretion during the firs t 24 hours following 
dosing. The minimally effective dose for facilitating glucose excretion was 0.1  mg/kg. The 
ED
50 was calculated to be 0.2  mg/kg. At doses of 0.1  mg/kg and above, the pharmacologic 
effect of sotagliflozin was maintained for at least 2 da ys following a single oral dose.  
3.2.4 Summary of Pharmacology  
The preclinical pharmacology studies of sotagliflozin were designed to evaluate the compound’s mechanism of action and effects in vivo. Sotagliflozin consistently facilitated significant glucose excr etion in nondiabetic, diet -induced obese mice, and normal rats and 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
dogs in a dose -dependent fashion during the first 24 hours following oral administration. 
Depending on the species and the dose of sotagliflozin, the pharmacologic effect of the 
compound could be maintained for 48 hours or longer. The ED 50 for sotagliflozin was 
1.8 mg/kg/day in the mouse. The ED 50 was approximately 0.75  mg/kg/day for rats and 
approximately 0.2  mg/kg/day for dogs. Importantly, sotagliflozin reduced hyperglycemia in a 
diabetic mouse model and improved glucose tolerance in both diabetic and nondiabetic mice. 
Detailed pharmacology information may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
3.3 Sotagliflozin Toxicology  
Toxicology studies including Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) -compliant mammalian 
toxicology, genetic toxicology, and safety pharmacology have been completed with sotagliflozin. Chronic toxicology studies with sotagliflozin have been completed in the rat 
and the dog. Results from these studies are summarized in Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.2 , and 3.4. 
Additional details can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
3.3.1 Toxicology Studies in Rats  
A 26-week chronic toxicology study with sotagliflozin has been completed in  the rat. Doses 
administered were 30, 75, or 300  mg/kg/day. Results showed that sotagliflozin produced 
nonadverse clinical effects and pathology changes, most of which reversed (or exhibited 
reversibility) during the recovery phase. Clinical effects included relative decreases in body weight gain and body weight change for males given 75  mg/kg/day and animals given 
300 mg/kg/day, and increased food consumption for all groups given sotagliflozin. Clinical 
pathology changes included minor hematology findings,  higher urine volume, increased urine 
calcium and inorganic phosphorus excretion, increased serum urea nitrogen concentration, and minimally higher serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity at all dose levels; and higher serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and serum gamma glutamyltransferase activity for animals given 300  mg/kg/day. Administration of sotagliflozin at all dose levels 
resulted in declines in bone turnover and calciotropic hormone levels. The trends for 
decreases in bone turnover markers at the low dose were generally marginal and not 
considered biologically significant.  
Postmortem observations included increased kidney weights at all dose levels (reversed in males and was reversing in females
 with recovery) and reversible increased adrenal weights 
without microscopic correlates in males given ≥75  mg/kg/day and females given 
300 mg/kg/day. Microscopic findings included reversible minimal to slight dilatation of renal 
cortical tubules in males given ≥30  mg/kg/day and females given ≥75 m g/kg/day; reversible 
transitional cell hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis within the renal pelvis and 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
hyperplasia/hypertrophy in the urinary bladder for females given 300 mg/kg/day; an 
increased severity of prostatic inflammation at the terminal and recovery sacri fices in males 
given ≥75  mg/kg/day; minimal to moderate increased trabecular bone adjacent to the growth 
plate of the sternum in males given ≥30  mg/kg/day and females given ≥75 mg/kg/day; and 
hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis of the nonglandular stomach at the ju nction of glandular stomach 
for males given ≥30  mg/kg/day that was still present at the recovery sacrifice in animals 
given 75 or 300  mg/kg/day. Based on the results of this study, the no observed adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) for sotagliflozin administered  by oral gavage for at least 26 weeks to male 
and female rats is 30 and 75  mg/kg/day, respectively. These dose levels correspond with a 
Week 26 maximum observed plasma concentration (C max) of 2360 ng/mL and AUC 0-24 hours 
values of 15,077 ng•hr/mL for males , with respective values of 13,333 ng/mL and 
84,145 ng•hr/mL for females.  
3.3.2 Toxicology Studies in Dogs  
A 39-week chronic toxicology study with sotagliflozin has been completed in the dog. Doses 
administered were 20, 60, or 200  mg/kg/day. Results showed that sotagliflozin produced 
nonadverse clinical effects and pathology changes, most of which reversed or exhibited 
reversibility during the recovery phase. Clinical effects included clinical observations typical for animals given 200 mg/kg/day and increased foo d consumption for all groups given 
sotagliflozin. Clinical pathology changes were reversible and included effects on urinalysis 
(UA) and urine excretion tests at all dose levels and minimal to mild effects on serum glucose 
during Week 13 at all dose levels  and during Week 40 of the dosing phase at >60 mg/kg/day. 
Anatomic pathology findings were noted at all dose levels and were limited to reversible increased kidney weights without microscopic correlates and reversible decreased hepatocellular glycogen. Bas ed on the results of this study, the NOAEL for sotagliflozin 
administered by oral gavage for at least 39 weeks to male and female beagle dogs is 200 mg/kg/day, the highest dose level evaluated. This dose level corresponds with C
max and 
AUC0-24 hours values of 21,867 ng/mL and 158,334 ng•hr/mL, respectively, for males and of 
20,867 ng/mL and 143,795 ng•hr/mL, respectively, for females at Week 39 of the dosing 
phase. 
3.4 Reproductive Toxicity  
Initial reproductive toxicity studies assessing maternal, embryo /fetal toxicity and teratogenic 
potential have been conducted in both pregnant rats and rabbits. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity and developmental toxicity for sotagliflozin in Sprague -Dawley rats is 
100 mg/kg/day. This dose corresponds to a gestational da y (GD) 17 C
max of 7183 ng/mL and 
AUC0-24 hours of 78,012 ng•hr/mL. The NOAEL for maternal reproductive function and 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
embryo-fetal developmental toxicity for sotagliflozin in New Zealand White rabbits was 
200 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested in this study.  This dose corresponds to a GD20 C max of 
5623 ng/mL and AUC 0-24 hours of 18,145 ng•hr/mL.  
3.5 Clinical Trials of Sotagliflozin in Humans  
More than 600 subjects have participated in clinical studies of sotagliflozin. No significant 
safety concerns have been id entified in the sotagliflozin drug program, and sotagliflozin has 
been well -tolerated in all studies to date. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and discontinuations 
due to adverse events (AEs) have been infrequent and have been balanced between treatment and comparator groups. Reports of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) across all 
sotagliflozin studies for which data are available were generally balanced between treatment and comparator groups. Headache was reported as a possible adverse reaction that occurred 
in ≥5% of subjects in sotagliflozin clinical studies, and was reported at a greater rate in sotagliflozin -treated subjects than placebo; however, most were assessed as mild to moderate, 
and most resolved spontaneously.  
There was no common theme o r imbalances in SAEs, nor were ther
 e significant imbalances 
between sotagliflozin and comparators in AEs. Cumulatively, during the clinical trial program 8 SAEs were reported by 6 patients (4 T2DM and 2 T1D), all of which were assessed as unrelated to study drug; those reported by 4 T2DM patients in the Phase 2 study LX4211.1-202- T2DM who received sotagliflozin included pulmonary embolism, deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT), bile duct stone, cholangitis and lower limb fracture, while a myocardial infarction (MI) wa s experienced by a patient receiving placebo. Two SAEs of diabetic 
ketoacidosis (DKA) were reported by 2 subjects treated with sotagliflozin in the Phase 2 T1D study LX4211.1-203- T1DM; both SAEs were assessed by the Investigator as due to failure of 
insulin delivery via insulin pump. In both cases, the patients had full recovery and resumed study drug within 48 -72 hours of onset of DKA.  
More information on the safety of sotagliflozin and on the clinical program can be found in 
the Investigator’s Brochure.  
3.5.1 Digoxin Drug -Drug Interaction (DDI) Study  
Study LX4211.1- 114-NRM was a drug -drug interaction study in healthy subjects, where 
LX4211 was shown to increase systemic exposure of digoxin, a sensitive P -gp substrate. 
Least squares mean digoxin Cmax, AUC0 -last, and AUC0 -inf increased by 51.9%, 31.1%, 
and 26.9%, respectively, following administration of digoxin in the presence of steady -state 
LX4211 compared to administration of digoxin alone. It can be concluded from these results 
that LX4211 acts as a mild P -gp inhibitor and may therefore result in elevation of digoxin 
levels. Given these data, it may be necessary to decrease digoxin dose by approximately  
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
30-50% or to modify the digoxin dosing frequency when sotagliflozin is administered. All 
patients should be evaluated about concurrent medication at each visit and those taking 
concomitant digoxin should have digoxin concentrations monitored. If the digoxin is being 
managed by another physician, that physician should also be informed about this potential 
interaction. Additionally, we recommend that the patient’s concomitant medications be 
evaluated as to whether they are P -gp substrates and the drug labels of these drugs be 
reviewed to determine if dosage reductions are recommended . 
3.5.2 Clinical Trials in T1D  
Sotagliflozin has been evaluated in a 4 -week, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo-controlled, proof -of-concept trial in the US (LX4211.1 -203-T1DM). A total of 36 
patients, 18 -55 years of age, with inadequately controlled T1D with an A1C range at Baseli ne 
of 7.0-9.0% have completed the study. Prior to the double -blind portion, the trial was initiated 
with an open- label “pioneer” group of 3 patients, in order to determine the appropriate 
recommended reduction in mealtime bolus insulin.  
During the double -blind expansion phase, the threshold for correction insulin to treat 
hyperglycemia was lowered, with patient -specific threshold and algorithm determined by the 
Investigators based on individual goals. The study met the primary endpoint of reduction in total daily bolus insulin, as well as exploratory endpoint of 0.55% reduction in A1C after 29 
days of treatment, both of which were highly statistically and clinically significant. Two 
reports of DKA were reported by 2 separate patients treated with sotagliflo zin. Both events 
were reported by the Investigators as related to pump failure and unrelated to study drug. No 
events of severe hypoglycemia or SAE related to hypoglycemia have been reported.  
3.6 Rationale for Current Study  
3.6.1 Rationale for Selection of Dose  
The proposed 400 mg once-daily dose is based on the results of the Phase 2b study 
LX4211.1-202- DM. In that study, doses of 75 mg once daily, 200 mg once daily, 200 mg 
twice daily, and 400 mg once daily sotagliflozin were tested over a 12 -week, double -blind 
period. The 400 mg once daily dose was chosen for further evaluation based on its A1C 
lowering effect and the overall safety and tolerability observed at this dose. At 12 weeks, the 400 mg dose lowered A1C by a mean of 0.92%, while placebo lowered A1C by a me an of 
0.09%. Lower doses were less effective than the 400 mg dose and did not have any advantages in safety or tolerability. The overall incidence of AEs on 400 mg once daily was similar to placebo. A maximum dose of sotagliflozin has not been established in terms of 
either safety or A1C reduction.  
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
From a safety perspective, sotagliflozin was well -tolerated across studies. In healthy subjects, 
sotagliflozin was well -tolerated following single doses up to 2000 mg, and in multiple doses 
up to 800 mg over 10 days. Furthermore, in a thorough QT study, single doses of 
sotagliflozin (800 mg and 2000 mg) were well-tolerated and did not prolong the QT interval. 
Additionally, evaluation of metabolites in urine and plasma of healthy subjects resulted in no safety con cerns following single doses of 400 mg sotagliflozin. In patients with T2DM, 
single doses of 400 mg in combination with sitagliptin, and multiple doses up to 400 mg in combination with metformin over 12 weeks, were also well -tolerated.  
3.6.2 Rationale for Study  Design and Control Groups  
This study is designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of sotagliflozin when used as adjunct therapy in normal weight and overweight/obese patients with T1D treated with 
insulin. Sotagliflozin will be compared to placebo, consistent with regulatory guidance. The 
24-week duration for assessment of A1C, which is a component of the primary efficacy 
endpoint, is assessed to be sufficient for achieving steady state conditions for sotagliflozin. 
Moreover, the “net benefit” primar y endpoint chosen for this study (proportion of patients 
with A1C <7.0% at Week 24 and no episode of severe hypoglycemia and no episode of DKA) is clinically relevant. In this study, self -monitored blood glucose (SMBG) values will 
be reviewed by the Invest igator and insulin doses adjusted if the SMBG trends are not 
meeting SOC T1D target goals.  
Bias will be minimized by stratified allocation to treatment groups made based on body mass index (BMI) at Screening (<25 kg/m
2, ≥25 kg/m2), Week -2 A1C (≤9%, >9%) and use of 
continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion  (CSII) at Screening (Yes, No).  
A placebo control will be used to allow for an unbiased assessment of treatment effects and safety data.  The comparison with placebo 
is justified since patients will continue use of 
prescribed insulin therapy, and the patients’ glycemic status will be monitored and adjustments made to insulin dose based on prespecified glycemic targets.  
Bias will be minimized by randomly assigning the patients to treatment groups; blinding th e 
patients, the Investigators, and t
he Sponsor to the treatment allocations; and by adjudication 
of death and event(s) of special interest (EOSI) in a blinded fashion.  
A parallel -group design was selected because it is free of the assumptions underlying 
competing designs (eg, crossove
r). Inclusion of patients with eGFR ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 is 
justified based on study LX4211.107, which demonstrated glycemic efficacy in diabetic patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 -59 mL/min/1.73 m
2).

3.6.3 Rationale for Patient -reported Outcomes: Satiety Substudy  
This substudy is designed to demonstrate the effects of sotagliflozin on patient self -reported 
satiety. Based on the dual mechanism of action of sotaglifozin, it is anticipated that 
sotagliflozin will increase satiety. As result of dual inhibition, more glucose delivered distally 
will trigger increased L -cell release of GLP -1 and PYY, a natural peptide hormone response 
associated with enhanced glycemic and appetite control; these findings have been substantiated with numerous animal and human mechanistic studies. [8,9] 
The instrument selected for the study, the Patient Satiety Daily Diary (PSDD) utilizes the Patient Satiety Daily Diary Numeric 
Rating Scale (PSDD -NRS).[8,9,10]  
Patient-reported satiety is measured on an 11 -point numeric rating scale as a daily d iary 
measured prior to first meal. This single item measure has been utilized in diabetes studies to 
assess increased fullness as well as decreased hunger ratings relative to change in glucose and 
insulin responses. Numeric rating scales of satiety are well -accepted by Regulatory Agencies 
and are both sensitive to change and able to discriminate along the clinical severity continuum.  
The PSDD is  described in Section 8.1.6 and included i
 n Appendix H . 
3.7 Benefit/Risk of Sotagliflozin  
In this study, sotagliflozin is being investigated as an adjunct to insulin treatment in patients 
with T1D with poor glycemic control. The attributes of sotagliflozin, a dual SGLT1 and 
SGLT2 inhibitor, and its insulin -independent mechanism of action are well -suited to address 
the needs of this population with high unmet medical need. While insulin has been available 
as a life-saving therapeutic option for patients with T1D, the risk of hypoglycemia inherent 
with insulin use significantly limits the ability to achieve target glycemic goals for many patients with T1D. As a result, many patients with T1D purposely maintain 
hyperglycemia. [11] As noted earlier, based on the T1D registry [3], only approximately 17% 
of registered 
T1D patients are able t
o achieve a target A1C <7.0%. Six to 10% of deaths in 
young patients with T1D are directly attributable to hypoglycemia, likely from cardiac 
arrhythmias. [12] A recent publication evaluating national trends for US Hospital admissions 
related to hyperg lycemia and hypogl
ycemia reported an increase in rates of admission for 
severe hypoglycemia among diabetic patients 65 years and older during the period between 1999 to 2011. [13] Patients with T1D who are able to achieve target goals are only able to do 
so with rigorous monitoring of glucos 
e, insulin dosing, dietary intake and lifestyle 
management, factors which increase burden and negatively impact quality of life. Therefore, 
ability of an oral agent like sotagliflozin to potentially achieve glycemic control safely when 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
added to insulin, without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia offers an attractive potential for 
patients with T1D.  
Improvements in A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG),  and PPG were observed with 
sotagliflozin in multiple studies in patients with T2DM. Glycemic efficacy with A1C and 
PPG reduction, reduction in total bolus and total daily insulin, and a trend towards reducing 
hypoglycemic  events were also observed in the Phase 2 T1D study. As anticipated from the 
mechanism of action, treatment with sotagliflozin resulted in increased UGE (from inhibition of SGLT2) as well as increased incretin levels (from inhibition of SGLT1). In addition , the 
reductions in body weight, blood pressure (BP), and triglycerides observed with sotagliflozin treatment have the potential to benefit patients with diabetes through their effects on common diabetic comorbidities.  
In patients with T1D, the glucose-buffering capacity afforded by 
 sotagliflozin and mealtime 
glycemic control is expected to be influenced by both mealtime insulin and sotagliflozin, thereby decoupling glycemic control from energy flux. As a result, it is anticipated that patients will need lower and less precise doses of insulin to reduce variability in blood glucose. The lower amount of IOB at mealtime should reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. The ability to maintain better glycemic control with a simplified insulin regimen provided by sotagliflozin offers the possibility of long -term health benefits. The anticipated lower insulin 
requirement may also lead to lower risk of hypoglycemic events and improved quality of life. 
Few safety issues have been identified in the sotagliflozin drug program . To date, 
sotagliflozin has been we
ll-tolerated in all studies, with the majority of AEs assessed as mild 
to moderate in severity, and with most resolved spontaneously. Two patients in the 
sotagliflozin group in the T1D proof of concept study reported an event of DKA; in each case 
basal insulin was within 7% of baseline, and the event was attributed by the Investigator to 
insulin pump -related etiologies. Both cases were associated with high blood glucose readings 
>300 mg/dL, a finding expected in DKA and n otable in that this value did not appear to be 
masked by sotagliflozin treatment. Based on the SGLT2 inhibitor mechanism of action, GU 
infections are recognized as a potential risk that will be monitored as an EOSI in all Phase 3 
clinical trials. In comple ted trials to date, the rate of GU infections has been low and well 
balanced across sotagliflozin and placebo treatment groups. With the exception of DKA noted above, SAEs and discontinuations due to AEs have been uncommon and have been balanced between sotagliflozin and placebo or comparator groups. These have been uncommon and have responded to standard treatment.  
Therefore, we believe sotagliflozin presents a favorable benefit -risk assessment based on its 
tolera
bility and safety profile known to date.

5. Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design  
This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -
group study.  
Adult patients with  T1D and BMI ≥18.5 kg/m2 with inadequate gly cemic control with insulin 
therapy (administered by subcutaneous injections] or CSII are eligible for enrollment in this 
study if they meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
listed in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2. 
A total of 1400 patients will be 
randomly assigned 1:1 between the following 2 treatment 
groups: 
•Sotagliflozin 400  mg as two (2) 200 -mg tabl
ets, once daily, be fore the first meal of
the day
•Placebo as two (2) placebo tablets (identical to sotagliflozin in appearance), once
daily, before the first meal of t
he day
It should be noted that all tablets (placebo and 200 -mg) are identical in appearance.  
Patients 
will continue treatment with insulin( s) or insulin analog(s) during the study.  
Note:  Subsequently, in this document, the term “insulin” includes insulin analogs. The term 
“insulin analog” may also appear, 
as needed for clarity. Bolus insulin refers to regular insulin 
or fast-acting insulin analog which may be administered via subcutaneous (SC) or inhaled 
route. 
During the study, SMBG values will be reviewed by the Investigator and insulin doses 
adjusted if the SMBG trends do not meet 
SOC T1D target goals. Suggested insulin titration 
algorithms are provided in the Site File Notebook. These algorithms may be modified based 
on the Investigator’s clinical assessment.  Further details are presented in Section 7.6.1.  
Patients will participate in the study for up to 32 weeks. The study includes a Screening Period of up to 2 weeks, followed by a 2 -week si 
ngle-blind placebo Run- in Period, a 
24-week, double -blind Treatment Period, and a 30-day Follow-up Period. The study periods 
are described in detail in Section 5.1.1 to Section 5.1.5.

Efficacy measures are described in Section 8.1. The definition of efficacy endpo ints and the 
methods used to analyze effi
cacy are described in Section 10.3.1 and Section 10.4.1, 
respectively.  
Safety assessmen
ts are pres
ented in detail in Section 8.2 and Section 9. Safety endpoints are 
defined in Sectio
n 10.3.2 and the methods 
used to summarize safety measures are described 
in Section 10.4.3. 
This study will also
 include a substudy designed to evaluate satiety (appetite) in a subset of 
enrolled patients. Up to 280 patients
 (140 per treatment group) will be recruited for this 
substudy. Additional details are presented in Section 8.1.6. 
The study design is summarized in  Figure 5.1-1.

5.1.1 Screening Period 
Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients before beginning any study 
related screening procedures. The collection of SAEs will begin after the patient has signed informed consent. Participation in the satiety substudy will be discussed at this time.  
5.1.2 Single-blind Placebo Run -in Period  
Patients will begin the single -blind placebo Run- in Period at Week -2. 
At the beginning of the single -blind placebo Run- in Period, patients electing to participate in 
the satiety substudy will receive packets of satiety daily diaries. The patients will be instructed to complete the paper diary each day before the first meal of the day for the duration of the single -blind placebo Run -in Period (1 4 days, ±3 days). Patients will be 
reminded to bring the diaries with them on Day 1 (Baseline).  
Patients will receive diet and exercise counseling according to nutritional recommendations for a healthy lifestyle consistent 
with American Diabetes Associati on (ADA)[ 14], the 
European Association for the Stu
dy of Diabetes (EASD) [15], or similar local guidelines, with 
a goal of weight maintenance to be f
ollowed for the study duration.  
Glucose meter, BHB meter and supplies will be dispensed at the Run -in visit. Patients will 
also be edu
cated on the use of the glucose meter and BHB meter provided for use during this 
study and use of the study diary to record insulin doses, SMBG, and hypoglycemic events (please see Section 7.6.1.3 for SMBG and insulin data required for CRF entry).  
Compliance with the administration of single -blind placebo tablets and compliance 
 with 
recording data in the study diary will be assessed during the single -blind placebo Run- in 
Period. Patients must demonstrate good compliance with placebo tablets (≥80%) during the single-blind placebo Run- in Period to be eligible for randomization. Compliance will be 
calculated as specified in Section 7.5.1. 
5.1.3 Unscheduled Visits  
During the course of the study, additional contact by telephone call, or unscheduled site visit, 
(or both) may be considered, based on Investigator’s discretion. Assessments completed during these visits (on -site or by telephone call), may include evaluation of SMBG data, 
insulin doses, AEs (eg, volume depletion, elevated creatinine), hypoglycemic events, etc. The Unscheduled Visit electronic case report form (eCRF) will be completed for each unscheduled telephone contact or site visit.

5.1.4 24-Week Double -blind Treatm ent Period  
Following completion of the single -blind placebo Run- in Period, eligible patients will enter 
the 24-week, double -blind Treatment Period. Patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 in 
parallel between the 2 treatment groups: sotagliflozin 400  mg or placebo.  
The double -blind Treatment Period includes 5 clin ic visits (Baseline, and Weeks 4, 8, 16, 
and 24). 
For all patients, clinic visits should be scheduled in the morning at approximately the same 
time of day.  
In regard to patients taki
ng antihypertensive medications, the Investigator will be asked to 
maintain dosages unchanged between B
aseline and Week 16, if this is consistent with proper 
medical management of the patient.  
For patients in the satiety substudy,  the satiety daily diaries completed dur ing the single -blind 
placebo Run -in Period will be collected at Day 1 (Baseline). At the visit scheduled for 
Week 16, these patients will receive packets of satiety daily diaries. At the beginning of 
Week 23, patient s will receive a telephone call to remind them to start recording information 
onto the satiety daily diaries. The patients will be instructed to complete the paper diary each day, before the first meal of the day for the last 2 weeks of the double -blind Treatment Period 
(ie, during Week 23 and during Week 24, a total of 14 days,  ±3 days). The diaries will be 
returned to the site at the visit scheduled for the end of Week  24.  
5.1.5 Follow-up Period  
All patients will have a contact 30 days after the last dose of s tudy drug to obtain information 
on SAEs, EOSI, and any AEs that were ongoing at the time of the EOT/EW Visit.  
6. Study Population
Patients included in this study will be ≥18 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of T1D and inadequate glycemic control on insulin therapy alone.

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
with any aspect of study conduct or interpretation of results. The Investigator or the 
Sponsor will supply justification for exclusion, if applicable.  
6.3 Cessation of Study Drug and Termination of Study 
Participation 
It is important to distinguish among 3 terms:  
•Temporary cessation of study drug administration – refers to temporarily halting s tudy
drug administration, which may be resumed at a later date.
•Permanent cessation of study drug administration - refers to permanent cessation of
study 
drug administration .
•Termination of study participation – refers to withdrawal of consent, o r refusal to
participate in any further clinic visit s or procedures.
6.3.1 Temporary Cessation of Study Drug  
If a patient misses more than 3 consecutive doses, the patient should contact the site for 
instructions. Upon visiting the site for a scheduled visit, if a patient is documented to have interrupted study drug for >5 consecutive days, the site must notify the Sponsor and/or the Sponsor’s designee to obtain appropriate instructions. The Medical Monitor will assess the clinical scenario (with escalation to the Sponsor for input, if needed) and respond to the site.  
Some patients with liver function abnormalities may be required to temporarily cease taking study drug. There has been no li ver 
signal identified in preclinical and clinical studies to date. 
The proactive algorithm is designed to establish uniform and complete follow -up of patients 
with liver chemistry abnormalities and prevent unintentional re -challenge.  
Temporary cessation of  study drug that is resumed at a later date  does not constitute 
permanent cessation or “discontinuation.” Only patients who are permanently ceasing study drug administration should be deemed as permanently stopping study drug.  
6.3.2 Permanent Cessation of Study Drug 
Study drug administration may be halted for any of the following reasons:  
•A life-threatening or serious adverse effect
•Noncompliance, including refus
al of the study drug and/or failure to adhere to the
study requirements as specified in
 the study protocol
•The Investigator decides that, in the interest of the patient, it is not medically
acceptable to continue participation i
n the study
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
•The Sponsor decides to terminate the study
•The patient meets specific criteria for liver function abnormalities
oNote: There has been no liver sig
nal identified in preclinical and clinical studies
to date. The proactive algorithm 
is designed to establish uniform and complete
follow-up of patients with liver chemistry abnormalities and prevent
unintentional re -challenge.
Temporary or permanent cessation of study drug administration is NOT considered to be 
withdrawal of consent from study 
participation unless the patient explicitly withdraws 
informed consent.  
6.3.3 Termination of Study Participation and/or Withdrawal of 
Consent 
A patient has the right to discontinue study participation at any time, for any reason, and may 
leave the study without specifying a reason. The Investigator should make all efforts to obtain 
information about possible underlying AEs leading to the decision to withdraw from study participation. Any AE, EOSI, and SAE information elicited must be documented in the patient’s source documents and the eCRF.  
Unless a patient who prematurely discontinues trial participation specifically withdraws consent for any follow-up contact, all pati
ents will continue to be contacted as specified in 
the protocol through the end of the study. There are a number of options for continuing follow-up once a patient decides to cease taking study drug. Investigators and site staff 
should encourage patients to allow as much follow -up as possible, and will need to clearly 
identify which aspects of the clinical trial the participants are discontinuing. Whenever possible, documentation should be collected in writing as to which of the f ollowing options 
the patient has chosen.  
•The patient opts to permanently cease taking study drug only. In this case, the patient
continues to complete all study activi
ties per protocol.
•The patient is not willing to continue planned clinic visit s/assessme nts, but will agree
to phone 
call assessments in accord with the clinic visit  schedule.
•The patient is not willing to continue planned clinic visit s/assessments or phone call
assessme
nts, but will allow the Investigator access to their medical records and  end-
of-study telephone contact.
•The patient is not willing to be contacted but does allow the Investigator access totheir medical records/contact with
 their care provider. In this case, the patient agrees
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 52 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
to continue as a study participant by allowing i nformation collected from his/her 
medical records to be used for research purposes. The patient does not agree to be 
contacted via phone, email, and/or postal mail for follow -up visits and/or study 
updates. 
•The patient is not willing to allow any direct contact, access to medical records, orcontact with care provider. In this cas
e, public records may be used to confirm vital
status at end of study.
•The patient formally withdraws consent (ideally in writing, as detailed below) to
participate further in any compo
nent of the study. In this case, the patient does not
want any further medical information to be used for this research. Information that
has already been obtained will remain as part of the research record, but no additionalinformation will be added  to the research record.
For the purposes of this protocol, only patients who are not willing to allow any direct 
contact, access to medical records, or con
tact with care provider will be deemed as patients 
who have withdrawn consent.  
If a patient decides to withdraw consent from the study participation, it is necessary to ensure 
that relevant safeguards are put in place t
o maintain the individual’s safety in the case of any 
future safety issues that are discovered. In this case, the decision to withdraw informed 
consent should be put in writing and, if possible, signed by the patient or patient’s representative. A copy of this document should be maintained at the study site (with key data 
items recorded in the eCRF). This written information should specify which aspect(s) of the 
study consent is being withdrawn as described below. In accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance, and other international ethical directives, data that have already been collected and incorporated into the study database, including the results of laboratory assays, will continue to be processed. In addition, every effort should be made to have the patient return to the clinic for a final EOT visit as desc ribed in Appendix A.  
If the patient or the patient’s representative refuses to withdraw consent in writing, the site 
must document and the Investigator 
must attest by signature, the reason for the patient’s 
failure to withdraw the consent in writing. The Sponsor or designee should be immediately 
notified.  
6.3.4 Lost-to-Follow-Up 
If a patient repeatedly fails to return for any scheduled visit(s) and cannot be contacted or 
located by the site staff, Investigators will be expected to continue to try to contact tho se 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 53 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
patients until the end of the trial. This level of diligence is necessary in order to obtain (at a 
minimum) vital status (whether the patient is alive), and thus avoid being lost to follow -up 
for efficacy and safety assessment. All sites will receive tr aining on how vital status may be 
monitored in accordance with local practices/regulations for patients who are unable to be 
contacted.  
6.4 Criteria for Termination of the Study or Study Site  
6.4.1 Early Termination of the Study  
If the Steering Committee, Sponsor, DMC, or regulatory officials discover conditions arising 
during the study that indicate that the study should be halted or terminated, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation between the Steering Committee, Sponsor, and the DMC. Full details on the roles of the Steering Committee and DMC will be provided in each 
committee's respective charter. Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, 
but are not limited to, the following:  
•The discovery  of an unexpected, serious, or unaccept
 able risk to the patients enrolled
in the study
•A decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation, ordevelopment of the study drug
6.4.2 Early Termination of a Study Center  
Conduct of the study at a particular center may be terminated for the following reasons:  
•Failure of the Investigator to enroll patients into the study at an acceptable rate
•Failure of the Investigator to co
mply with pertinent FDA, European Medicines
Agency (EMA), and/or other applicabl
e Regulatory Authorities regulations
•Submission of knowingly false information from the research facility to the Sponsor,
Sponsor-designated contract research organi
zation (CRO) or vendors, study monitor,
or the FDA, EMA, and/or other applic able Regulatory Authorities
•Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements
The Investigator also has the right
 to withdraw from participating in the study at any time.  
If a study center or Investigator is terminated, the Sponsor will make all efforts pos sible to 
have another investigative s
ite assume responsibility for continuing trial activities.  
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 54 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
Study termination and follow -up will be performed in compliance with the conditions set 
forth in the following sections of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR ): 21 CFR 312.50 and 
21 CFR 312.56, and other local Regulatory Authorities.  
6.5 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment 
Patients will be randomly assigned between 2 parallel treatment groups in a 1:1 manner. The 
treatment randomization schedule will be centralized and stratified by BMI at Screening (<25 kg/m
2, ≥25 kg/m2), Week -2 A1C (≤9%, >9%), and use of CSII at Screening (Yes, No). 
The schedule will also account for the substudy in satiety. The desired balances will be accomplished by use of randomly permuted blocks of fixed size. An Interactive Voice/Web Response System (IXRS) will be used as a central mechanism to assign patients to study treatment. The study is double -blind so the study treatment assigned to each patient will not 
be revealed to the Investigator, patient, Sponsor, or designee until the decision is made to unblind the study. Data from individual patients may be unblinded if deemed medically necessary by the Investigator, or as required by local regulation in the case of an unexpected SAE.  
6.6 Replacement of Patients  
Patients will not be replaced in this study.  
7. Treatment
Patients will take single -blind placebo tablets once daily, orally, before the first meal of the 
day during the single -blind placebo Run- in Visit (see Section 7.2)  
Patients will take sotagliflozin
 400 mg or placebo (in identical tablet form), once daily, orally, 
before the first meal of the day,
 during the double -blind Treatment Period (see Section 7.3). 
The study drug eCRF will be completed each time study drug is dispensed (see Section 7.5.1).  
7.1 Study Drug Identification  
The identity, potency, strength, and appearance of the study drugs used are presented in Table 
7.1-1. It should be noted that the p

. . On days of clinic visits, site personnel will provide 
instructions to the patients for dosing with single -blind placebo tablet s based on scheduled 
procedures . The date and time of the last dose of placebo tablets  prior to the clinic visit will 
be recorded in the eCRF.  
In order to qualify for randomization, patients must have ≥80% compliance to taking the expected amount of placebo tablets during the 
 2-week single -blind placebo Run -in Period. In 
addition, patients should also demonstrate compliance with entering required data in the study diary.  
Details concerning the methods used for the titration of insulin to maintain glycemic targets 
in this time period are presented in Secti 
on 7.6.1.2.  
7.3 24-Week Double -blind Treatment Period  
On Day 1 of the double -blind Treatment Period, patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 
ratio between the following 2 treatment groups, as an adjunct to their insulin therapy:  
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
•Sotagliflozin 400 mg as two (2) 200 -mg tablets, once daily, before the first meal of
the day
•Placebo as two (2) tablets (identical to sotagliflozin tablets in appearance), once daily,
before the first meal of the day
Upon 
randomization, and at each dispensing visit  thereafter, patients will be provided 
individual bottles of study drug. Sufficient quantity of study drug will be provided to allow prescribed daily dosing until the next scheduled dispensing visit. Each dispensing uni t 
(bottle) will be labeled with a 1 -panel, double -blind label printed in black. Prior to 
dispensation, the Investigator/qualified designee will complete spaces on the study drug label to specify the Patient Number, and Date Dispensed. In addition, the prot ocol number, batch 
number, quantity of tablets, route of administration, directions for use, bottle number, storage conditions, and use -by date will be indicated.  
Except on days of clinic visits, patients should be instructed to dose with double -blind study 
drug before the first meal
 of the day. Two tablets of double -blind study drug should be taken 
with water and should be taken whole. If a patient misses a dose by more than 12 hours, that dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken as schedu led. No double doses 
should be taken, and dose reductions are not permitted.  
On days of clinic visits, double -blind study drug will not be taken the m
 orning of a scheduled 
clinic visit. Patients will take the assigned dose of double -blind study drug for th at day per 
site personnel instructions based on scheduled procedures. The date and time of 
administration of the last dose of study drug prior to the clinic visit will be recorded in the 
eCRF. Details concerning the methods used for the titration of insuli n to maintain glycemic 
targets in this time period are presented in Section 7.6.1.2.   
7.4 Study Drug Adjustment/Interruption  
The dosage of double -blind study drug may not be adjusted throughout the study. For safety 
reasons, should a patient experience an adverse event, the study drug may be temporarily interrupted. 
Upon visiting the site for a scheduled visit, if a patient is documented to have interru pted 
study drug for >5 consecutive day
s, the site must notify the Medical Monitor and/or designee 
and be in receipt of a response prior to continuing the patient in the study on study drug. The 
Medical Monitor will assess the clinical scenario (if needed w ith escalation to the Sponsor for 
input) and respond to the site on a case-by- case basis as to the appropriateness of continuing 
the patient in study on study drug.  
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 57 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
In cases of clinically significant volume depletion, study drug may be temporarily 
discontinued until the event has resolved. The Medical Monitor must be informed of these 
cases.  
Note:  If serum creatinine increases by ≥30% above the baseline value during the study, then 
the Investigator should consider 
assessment of: volume status, diuretic d osage, discontinuing 
nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and other relevant testing including renal 
imaging techniques, as appropriate.  
Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors are associated with osmotic diuresis and 
volume depletion, whi ch may lead t
o dizziness or hypotension, especially in the elderly. All 
patients will be advised to maintain proper fluid intake and to consider increasing it if they sense greater thirst, increased urination, or if they feel dizzy or faint.  
7.5 Handling and Dispensing of Study Drug  
The Sponsor will be responsible for ensuring that the quality of the study drug is adequate for the duration of the trial. Study drugs, both active and placebo, should be stored at 15-30°C 
(59-86°F) in induction- sealed bottles as de termined by the Sponsor and defined in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
Study drug should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is the responsibility of the Investigat
or to ensure that study drug is only dispensed to study patients. 
The study drug must be dispensed only from official study sites by authorized personnel 
according to local regulations.  
All study drug supplies that will be used in the study must be maintained securely under the direct responsibility of the Investi
gator or delegated by the Investigator to the hospital 
pharmacist, or other personnel licensed to store and dispense drugs. All drugs shall be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator’s prescription, and it is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that a n accurate record of drugs issued and returned is maintained.  
7.5.1 Dispense Study Drug and Record Compliance  
The Investigator must maintain accurate records of study drug receipt, dispensing information, and disposition. Sponsor will provide forms to facilitate  inventory control, if the 
staff at the investigational site does not have an established system that meets these requirements.  
Patients will be instructed to bring their empty bottles and any unused study drug to each clinic visit. Pill counts will be per formed 
at each clinic visit by a member of the site staff to 
determine compliance. Pill count will be recorded on the study drug eCRF.  
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 58 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
Treatment compliance will be calculated as:  
(Number of tablets dispensed – Number of tablets returned) X 100  
Number of t ablets expected to be taken  
The number of tablets expected to be taken should be 2 times the number of days since the 
last visit. The Investigator/qu
alified designee will remind patients at each visit regarding the 
importance of following the protocol defined schedule for taking study drug. Reasons for not 
following study drug administration as described in the protocol should be clearly recorded in the source documents.  
Patients will be deemed “compliant” if their calculated compliance is between 80% and 120%, inclusive. If a patient’s compli
ance is noted to be less than 80% or greater than 120% 
on 2 consecutive visits, the patient should be counseled by study personnel, and the 
Sponsor/designee should be contacted to recommend appropriate study continuati on. 
7.5.2 Return of Study Drug 
Bottles of used, partially used, and unused study drug products should be retained until the 
clinical research associate (CRA) has been able to complete drug accountability and reconciliation.  
Upon completion or termination of the study, all unused and/or partially used study drug must be returned to the Sponsor or design
ee, if not authorized by the Sponsor to be destroyed at the 
site.  
All study drug returned to the Sponsor or designee or other  authorized party must be 
accompanied by 
the appropriate documentation and be clearly identified by protocol number 
and study site number on the outermost shipping container. Returned supplies should be in the original bottles (eg, bottles that have clinical labels attached). Empty bottles should not be returned to the Sponsor or designee. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to arrange for disposal of all empty bottles, provided that procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable federal, state, local, and institutional guidelines and 
procedures, and provided that appropriate records of disposal are kept. The return of unused 
study drug should be arranged by the assigned site Monitor.  
7.5.3 Destruction of Study Drug 
If study drug is to be destroyed at the site, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that 
arrangements have been made for the disposal, written authorization has been granted by the Sponsor, procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable regulations and guidelines and institutional procedures, and appropriate records of the 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 59 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
disposal have been documented and provided to the Sponsor or designee. Unused study drug 
can only be destroyed after being inspected and reconciled by the res ponsible CRA.  
7.6 Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications, supplements, or products used to maintain health taken from 2 
weeks prior to the Screening Visit through the End of Study, including those specified in the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, must be recorded in the source documents. Dose modifications 
of any other long -term (stable dose) medications that the patients are on at study entry are 
discouraged during the study period; any modification  of concomitant medications from 
Screening and throughout the study period must be recorded in the source documents with 
justification for the change.  
The following medications are not permitted  during the Treatment Period:  
•Any marketed or investigational antidiabetic agent, other than insulin(s) or insulinanalog(s) (any medication other than insulin or insulin analog used for treatment of
T1D must be washed out for at least 8 weeks prior to the Screening Visit)
•Chronic systemic corticosteroid use, defined as any dose of systemic corticosteroid
taken for more than 2 consecutive weeks. Not 
e:  Topical, inhaled, ocular, or nasal
spray corticosteroids are allowed.
•The use of SGLT inhibitors (other than double -blind study drug) is not permitted
during
 the Treatment Period
7.6.1 Glycemic Goals and Adjustment of Insulin Do se 
7.6.1.1 Glycemic Goals  
The glycemic goals recommended for this study are to treat A 1C and blood glucose to the 
following targets: A 1C <7.0%, fasting/preprandial capillary plasma glucose 80-130 mg/dL 
(4.4-7.2 mmol/L), and 2- hour/peak postprandial capillary plasm a glucose <180 mg/dL 
(<10.0 mmol/L). Goals may be adapted based on individual patient considerations consistent 
with ADA/EASD Guidelines.[ 14,15] 
Suggested insulin adjustment algorithms are provided in the Site File Notebook to serve as 
reference, which may be modified based 
on the Investigator’ s clinical assessment.  
7.6.1.2 Assessment of Glycemia and Adjustment of Insulin 
For all patients, a study diary will be provided to record insulin doses, and episodes of hypoglycemia, as well as presence or absence of symptoms associated with these hypoglycemic e pisodes. The primary SMBG data sources will be glucose meter data from the 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 60 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
web-based portal and/or point -of-care glucose meter download/meter memory review. These 
primary data sources are supplemented by other available data, study diary, and laboratory 
blood glucose values. Additionally, for patients using CSII as the method of insulin delivery, 
the pump memory or downloaded pump data will provide daily basal, daily bolus, and total 
daily insulin data. Data to be recorded in the eCRF is outlined below. SMB G values obtained 
using the glucose meter provided for this study will be reviewed and guidance for the 
adjustment of insulin doses will be provided as per Section 7.6.1.4 and Section 7.6.1.5.  
Upon review of SMBG data, if resu
lts do not meet the glycemic goals recommended for this 
study, the
n Investigators will assess the need for a change in insulin dosing. Following any 
change in insulin dosing, a follow -up call should be arranged within 1 week, to assess 
response to the therapy change, and any need for  additional change(s). The recommended 
target for fasting/preprandial glucose is 80-130 mg/dL (4.4-7.2 mmol/L). Good clinical 
judgment is to be exercised while titrating the basal insulin dose, which should not be titrated any more frequently than every 3 -4 days. Recommended target for 1 -2-hour PPG by SMBG 
is <180 mg/dL, while avoiding hypoglycemia. Goals may be adapted for individual patients, 
if deemed necessary.  
Patients who experience hypoglycemia as a result of a missed meal, unusual exercise, or alcohol use should receive counseling 
on the correction of these behaviors.  
If needed, additional contact should be made available for patients to discuss dose 
adjustments in between scheduled s
ite visits. During these visits (on -site or phone), patients 
will report their SMBG data, insulin doses and hypoglycemic events to the study site.  
The dose of double -blind study treatment will not be adjusted at any time during the study.  
7.6.1.3 Entering SMBG and Insulin Data into the eCRF  
Patients will perform SMBG as instru cted during the 3 -5 days (consecutive or non -
consecutive) prior to each clinic visit (see Section 8.2.2). 
Calculation of SMBG Data for eCRF:  
Self-monitored blood glucose values from the preceding 3 -5 days (consecutive or non -
consecutive) 
prior to each clinic visit will be assessed. Self -monitored blood glucose data will 
be obtained from as many available sources as possible, which include but a re not limited to: 
(1) the memory of the glucose meter; (2) meter download, (3) SMBG from web -portal,; and 
(4) paper diary. The SMBG will be reviewed to obtain the glucose values for the preceding 3 
to 5 days and the glucose values will be reviewed by the site to identify any unusual high or low values or any trends which may require a change in insulin dose(s). The patient should be questioned to obtain a possible explanation for unusual high or low values, and to confirm 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
that the values (from the glucose meter’s memory and/or from other data sources) were 
obtained from the patient. A “clinical average” will be calculated from the acceptable available glucose values that have been collected and entered into the eCRF. (The “clinical average” does not imply arithmetic mean)  
Calculation of Insulin Data for eCRF:  
Insulin doses during the preceding 3- 5 days (consecutive or non- consecutive) 
 prior to each 
clinic visit will be assessed. Insulin dosing data will be obtained from as many available sources as possible  which include but are not limited to: (1) the memory of the glucose meter 
if insulin data is entered into the meter; (2) meter download if insulin data is entered into the meter; (3) insulin pump memory; (4) insulin pump download; (5) insulin pump data fr om 
web portal; and (6) study diary. For each day with complete insulin data, the daily bolus (for 
all patients, for patients on pre -mixed insulin, the bolus is defined as the rapid acting 
component; eg, a patient receiving a daily total of 50 IU of Novolin
® 70/30 insulin, 15 units 
(0.3 x 50) is assessed as the “daily bolus” insulin), daily basal (for patients using insulin 
pumps and patients using subcutaneous injections), daily non- bolus (for patients receiving 
intermediate insulin; eg, a patient taking a daily total of 50 IU of Novolin 70/30 insulin, 35 
units (0.7 x 50) is assessed as the “daily non- bolus” insulin) and total daily insulin (for all 
patients) will be calculated. Based on results of at least 3 days of data, the mean daily bolus, mean daily ba sal and mean total daily insulin (bolus + basal) will be calculated. These 
calculated values will be entered into the eCRF.  
7.6.1.4 Insulin Adjustment on Day 1  
All patients will take the first dose of double -blind study drug at the site. The study drug is to 
be administered prior to the first meal of the day (which is typically breakfast for most 
patients). For the first meal on Day 1, patients will be instructed to decrease their calculated (or usual) mealtime carbohydrate bolus insulin by 30%.  
Subsequent adjust ments in insulin dosing will be
  made based on SMBG trends, as assessed 
by the Investigator.  
The mealtime insulin adjustment recommendations for Day 1 are based on results from the T1D study (LX4211.1 -203-T1DM). It is expected 
that the I/C ratio will be decreased by 
approximately 30% with sotagliflozin treatment. It is also predicted that such an adjustment will convey appropriate margins of safety for both the treated and placebo groups. The I/C ratio will be subsequently adjusted as frequently as required by the Investigator to meet 
glycemic goals recommended for this study. It is expected that the Investigator will evaluate the postprandial blood glucose after the first dose of study drug and continue the 30% 
reduction in the mealtime I/C ratio if these values are in an acceptable range, and make 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 62 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
changes to the I/C ratio as clinically indicated for subsequent meals. The Investigator is 
encouraged to access the SMBG glucose uploaded from the patient’s meter, and/or other appropriate sources of blood glucose data at least daily for the first few days after initiation of study drug and assess if further changes in insulin reduction are required. No change in high 
blood glucose correction factor (sliding scale), basal (or non -bolus) insulin, or basal rate is 
recommended at initiation of study drug, although the Investigator is not prohibited from 
making any changes in any insulin dose consistent with meeting glycemic goals recommended for this study.  
7.6.1.5 Insulin Adjus tment Strategy 
•The need for insulin adjustments will be evaluated by the Investigator with the goal of
maintaining or improving glyce mic control consistent with the  glycemic target ranges,
local SOC, and the individual needs of the patient (see Section 7.6.1.2).
•Suggested insulin adjustment algorithms are provided in the Site File Notebook to
serve as reference, which may be mo
dified based on the Investigator’s clinical
assessment.
•When insulin is adjusted, it is recommended that any changes be made in increments
of 10% or less, as assessed appropri
ate by the Investigator.
•During the course of the study, increases in insulin that affect the appropriate insulin
action time period should be considered  i
f the SMBG pattern or trajectory over
3-5 days is assessed as above the patient’s individualized target range, and there is no
evidence of hypoglycemia in the insulin -action time period (see Section 7.6.1.2).
•During the course of the study, decreases in insulin, which affect the appropriate
insulin-action time period, should be co
nsidered if the SMBG pattern or trajectory is
assessed as below the pa tient’s individualized target range.
7.6.1.6 Unmasking of Patients Not Meeting Glycemic Targets  
In order to avoid influencing patient and/or Investigator behavior, A1C and FPG results will be masked to study staff after randomization laboratories have been obtained. However, if the 
A1C is >11.0% at Week 16 or any determination thereafter, the A1C result will be unmasked to allow for appropriate diabetic management.  
If an Investigator is unmasked to an A1C value >11.0%, the Investigator should ensure that no reasona ble explanation exists for
 insufficient glucose control and evaluate possible causes, 
such as: 
•Appropriate basal and mealtime insulin titration
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 63 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
•Compliance with treatment
•Compliance with diet and exercise
•Intercurrent disease
Note:  The centra
l laboratory U A will 
not include the measurement of urine glucose.  
7.6.2 Concomitant Antihypertensive Medication and Treatment of 
Hypertension 
Patients with elevated SBP and/or DBP, either naïve to medication or on therapy may enter 
the study. However, it is mandatory that th eir BP be treated aggressively and according to 
current local guidelines. Examples of guidelines current at the time of protocol writing 
include those from the ADA[ 14] and the European Society of Cardiology.[ 15] 
The current ADA recommendations 
for the treatment goals for hypertension are:  
•Patients with diabetes and hypertension should be treated to an SBP goal of
<140 mm Hg.
•A lower systolic target, such
 as <130 mm Hg, may be appropriate for certain
indiv
iduals, such as younger patients, if it can be achieved without undue treatment
burden.
•Patients with diabetes should be treated to a DBP <90  mm Hg. A lower diastolic
target, such
 as <80 mmHg, may be appropriate for certain individuals, such as
younger patients, if they can be achieved without undue treatment burden.
•Patients with a BP >12 0/80 mm Hg should be advised on lifestyl e changes to reduce
BP.
Patients admitted to the study with BP exceeding that mandated by Good Clinical Practice (GCP) or regional SOC guideline
s must be appropriately treated by either the Investigator or 
the referring physician.  
The Investigator is asked to keep antihypertensive medication dosages unchanged between Baseline and Week 16, if this is consi
stent with proper medical management of the patient, 
since BP will be evaluated as an endpoint at Week 16. Since sotagliflozin may cause 
intravascular volume contraction, symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiating 
sotagliflozin  particularly in patients with impaired renal function, elderly patients, and 
patients on either diuretics or medications that interfere with the renin -angiotensin -
aldosterone system (eg, angiotensin -converting -enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angiotensin 
receptor blockers [ARB], or patients with low SBP. Before initiating sotagliflozin in patients 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 64 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
with 1 or more of these characteristics, volume status should be assessed and corrected and 
patients monitored for signs and symptoms after initiating therapy.  
7.6.3 Concomitant Lipid Medication and Dyslipidemia/Lipid 
Management 
Patients with hyperlipidemia/dyslipidemia should be treated in accordance with lo cal and 
regional SOC.  
7.6.4 Other Concomitant Medications  
Initiation or adjustments of therapies for BP, lipids, and renal function will be left to the 
Investigator’s discretion. All concomitant therapy should be driven towards achievement of levels recommended  by local or regional SOC. The Screening and Run -in Periods will 
provide an opportunity to adjust concomitant medications as needed towards achievement of 
metabolic targets, but these medications may be adjusted at any time during the study. The 
Investigat or should instruct the patient to notify the site about any new medications he or she 
takes after the start of the study. All medications and significant non -study drug therapy that 
the patient takes after the start of study treatment should be listed on the Concomitant Medication eCRF.  
Starting any over -the-counter (OTC) medications or use of
  herbal supplements during the 
study should be strongly discouraged unless medically necessary. If use of a supplement is reported, it must be documented in the sourc e documents.  
Concomitant medications taken from 2 weeks prior to the Screening Visit through the End of Study, including those specified 
in the inclusion/exclusion criteria, must be recorded in the 
source documents and eCRF. Any modification of concomitant  medications from Screening 
and throughout the study period must be recorded in the source documents and eCRF pages.  
7.7 Blinding and Unblinding of Study Drug  
In this treatment- blinded study, the designated group and treatment assigned to each patient 
will not be revealed to the Investigator, the patient, or the Sponsor or designee, until the 
decision is made to unblind the study. Data from individual patients may be unblinded if deemed medically necessary by the Investigator or as required by local regulation  in the case 
of an unexpected SAE. The IXRS will be used to perform emergency unblinding by authorized individuals.  
Because of the glycosuric effect of sotagliflozin, urine glucose values will be masked to all study staff.  
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 65 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
The randomization schedule will b e maintained by the designee performing IXRS for this 
study. Investigators, study site personnel associated with this trial, patients, and the Sponsor 
and its designee involved in the conduct of the study will remain blinded to individual patients’ treatme nt assignments until database lock.  
During the study, the blind is to be broken only when the safety of a patient is at risk and the treatment plan is dependent on the
 study treatment received. If the unblinding occurs without 
the knowledge of the Sponsor and/or designee, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor and/or designee as soon as possible and no later than the next business morning. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly documented in the source records.  
The Sponsor o r designee will not release the random
 ization schedule to any party except 
upon formal written request by the Sponsor. The request must be approved by the appropriate Sponsor personnel, according to the Sponsor’s standard operating procedures (SOPs). Detai ls 
of any disclosure of the randomization schedule will be recorded in the site’s study files and the Trial Master File. A copy will also be sent to the Sponsor and/or designee. The blinding of the study will be broken after the database has been locked. T o maintain continuous blinding 
and study integrity, analysis will be conducted by an independent statistician, and measures will be taken to ensure the validity of the data. Details describing the DMC processes and procedures will be outlined in a separate DMC Charter.  
8. Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic, Safety, and Other
Assessments/Procedures
A Schedule of Assessments, with detailed time points, is provided in  Appendix A . Study 
procedures and assessments are presented 
by visit in  Appendix I . The efficacy endpoints 
derived from these assessments/pro
cedures and the methods used to analyze these data are 
described in Section 10.3.1 and Section 10.4.1. 
8.1 Assessment of Efficacy 
It should be noted that the primary efficacy endpoint includes assessments of the incidence of 
severe hypoglycemia and DKA. These are discussed in Section 9.5.1 and Section 9.5.2, 
respectively.  
8.1.1 A1C

16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 66 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
8.1.2 Fasting Plasma Glucose and SMBG  
Blood glucose values determined by SMBG will be obtained from data downloaded from the 
SMBG meter, the study diary and values obtained during clinic visits. The SMBG pro cedure 
is described in Section 8.2.2. 
In the evaluation of safety, hypoglycemia (based on SMBG) and symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia will be asse ssed as describ 
ed in Section 9.5.1.  
8.1.3 Insulin 
The usage of insulin (or insulin analog) will be assessed from diary data for all patients. In addition, for patients using CSII, insulin data will be accessed from the pump download.  
8.1.4 Kidney Function  
Urinary albumin, calcium, glucose, and creatinine will be obtained from urine samples and 
used to derive albumin:creatinine ratio  (ACR), calcium:creati nine ratio (CCR), and 
glucose:creatinine ratio  (GCR).  
Serum creatinine will be obtained fro
m clinical chemistry samples and used in the calculation 
of MDRD eGFR (Appendix D ).  
8.1.5 Body Weight and Blood Pressure 
The methods used to evaluate BP (SBP and DBP) and body weight are presented in 
Section 8.2.4 (Vital Signs) and Section 8.2.5 (Physical Examinations, Hei ght, and Weight), 
respectively. The information wil
l be evaluated for efficacy at the time points described in 
Section 10.3.1.2 and Section 10.3.1.3. 
8.1.6 Patient-reported Outcome:  Satiety (Substudy) 
In the satiety substudy, the patients will be instructed to complete the satiety daily diary each day before the first meal of the day during the 2 -week single -blind placebo Run -in Period (14 
days, ±3 days) and for the last 14 days, ±3 days of the double -blind Treatment Period (each 
day during Weeks 23 and 24). The instrument used will be the PSDD. The diary is presented in Appendix H . 
Patient satiety will be evaluated using a 11-point PSDD -NRS. Patients will be asked
  to 
indicate their average level of hunger (satiety) over the past 24 -hour period from 0 ‘very full’ 
to 10 ‘very hungry’.  
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 67 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
8.2 Assessment of Safety 
Assessments for safety include AEs, SMBG, clinical laboratory assessments, 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examination,  weight, and vital signs.  
Adjudication of all deaths, MACE/other selected CV events, DILI, severe hypoglycemia (and 
SAEs of hypoglycemia), and DKA will
 be performed in a blinded manner by a committee(s) 
composed of experts. Details will be provided in the charter of the adjudication committee(s). 
Please refer to Section 9.6 for details.  
8.2.1 Adverse Events  
Monitoring and reporting of AEs (including SAEs, EOSI, and AEs leading to 
discontinuation) are described in detail in Section 9.  
8.2.2 SMBG Procedures  
Glucose meters will be supplied to all patients at the start of the Run -in Period at Week -2 in 
order to perform SMBG.  
Fingerstick fasting blood glucose by SMBG will be measured in the clinic with the study -
provided meter at each visit per the schedul
e in Appendix A . These results should be recorded 
in the eCRF. (If the study- provided meter
 is not available at a particular visit, then another 
glucose meter may be utilized).  
Patients should be instructed to self -assess blood glucose levels regul arly to allow appropriate 
glycemic control and insulin titration.  
Fasting pre -breakfast SMBG:  
•Patients should be 
encouraged to check fasting pre- breakfast SMBG daily for the
entir
e duration of the study.
5-point SMBG profile:  
•5-point SMBG profile (fasting pre -break
fast, before and 2 hours after l unch, before
dinner and bedtime) will be performed on at least 3 days per week before each visitfor the duration of the treatment period.
8-point SMBG profile:  
•It is recommended that at least one (1)
 8-point SMBG profile be performed dur ing the
week prior to the clinic visit (fasting [before] and 2 hours after  breakfast, before and 2
hours after lunch, before and 2 hours after dinner, bedtime, and once during thenocturnal period [typically 02:00 or 03:00]).
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 68 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
In addition, it is recommended that:  
•The Investigator considers SMBG in the nocturnal period if fasting or bedtime SMBG
readings are lower than goal, or there 
are unexplained high fasting SMBG results,
which could be consistent with recovery from nocturnal hypoglycemia.
•Patients should perform SMBG prior to exercise, when they suspect low blood
glucose, after treating low bloo
d glucose until they are normoglycemic, and prior to
critical tasks such as driving.
•SMBG frequency and timing should be dictated by the patient’s specific needs and
goals.
•Patients will be requeste
d to monitor blood glucose levels with increased frequency
whenever they 
experience any illnesses (eg, cold, flu), or symptoms of hyperglycemia
or hypoglycemia.
Symptoms of hypoglycemia may include shakiness, dizziness, sweating, hunger, headache, pale skin color, sudden moodiness or 
behavior changes (such as crying for no apparent 
reason), clumsy or jerky movements, seizure, difficulty paying attention or confusion, or tingling sensations around the mouth. Patients will be instructed to record any hypoglycemic episodes or presence of hypoglyce mic symptoms (Yes or No) in the study diary provided.  
Patients will also be instructed to record SMBG values that are ≤70  mg/dL (≤3.9 mmol/L) in 
the study diary.
  
8.2.3 Selected Laboratory Tests  
All laboratory tests will be sent to the central lab for analysis, with the exception of urine 
pregnancy test, point of care BHB and fingerstick glucose, which  will be assessed at the site 
per Appendix A . 
Blood and urine derived central laboratory tests for hematology, serum chemistry (includi ng 
lipid profile), hormones, and other
 assessments are presented in  Table 8.2.3-1. This table also 
includes laboratory tests such 
as FSH (females, if n ecessary to confirm postmenopausal 
status), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) (at Screening only; if abnormal, free thyroxine 
will be measured), and serum pregnancy tests (for females of childbearing potential). Details 
describing the UA (dipstick and micr oscopic examination) are presented in Section 8.2.3.1. 
Details concerning pregnancy testing
 are presented in Section 8.2.3.2. 
The Schedule of Assessment is presented in  Appendix A .

8.2.3.1 U
rinalysis 
Urinalysis (urine dipstick with microscopy) by a central laboratory will be performed at the 
time points shown in Appendix A .  
Urine dipstick includes:  
•Specific 
gravity
•pH
•Protein
•Blood
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 70 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
•Ketones
•Bilirubin
•Urobilinogen
•Nitrate
•Leukocyte esteras
e
Urine micr
oscopy
 includes, but
 is not limited to, the detection of formed cellular elements, 
casts, bacteria, yeast, parasites, and cryst
als in centrifuged urine sediment.  
In an effort to minimize bias in t he study, Investigators, staff, and the Sponsor or designee 
will be blinded to urine glucose results until after database lock. Investigators and the study 
staff will be instructed that they are not to perform local UA with reagent strips (dipstick) for the same reason. In order to evaluate a urinary tract infection, the Investigator should request 
microscopic and culture as clinically indicated, but should not use a dipstick.  
If a dipstick analysis for the presence of ketones is deemed clinically necessar y, the dipstick 
should not provide glucose data. The Ketostix® (ketones only) reagent strip or similar is 
appropriate for this purpose; use of the Keto -Diastix® (ketones and glucose) reagent strip is 
not appropriate.  Sites and study personnel will remain blinded to the urine glucose and GCR 
data. The urinary glucose data will be analyzed after unblinding of the database.  
Referral to urology is recommended for all patients with gross hematuria or high -grade 
hematuria (>50 red blood cells [RBCs]/high- power field [HPF]) on a single UA.  
Referral to urology and urologic evaluation is recommended for males or females with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or
 symptomatic hematuria (unilateral flank pain, lower 
irritative voiding symptoms, recurrent urinary tract infections despite appropriate use of antibiotics, etc) that produces >3 RBC/HPF on 2 of 3 properly performed and collected UAs. (Note:  Urine specimens should be collected >48 hours after exercise. The UA should also be 
done when the urine is fresh, if po ssible, by a standardized methodology to avoid the lysis of 
formed elements from heat or chemical breakdown.) If there is an identifiable benign 
etiology for an isolated episode of hematuria, such as vigorous exercise, sexual activity, 
trauma, viral illnes s, or infection, it will be noted as part of the medical record. However, 
multiple episodes that meet the above criteria should be referred.  
8.2.3.2 Contraception and Pregnancy Testing 
Females of childbearing potential who participate in this study must use reli able 
contraceptive methods. For this study, females are considered to be of childbearing potential, 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 71 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
i.e. fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless permanently 
sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilater al salpingectomy and  
bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months 
without an alternative medical
 cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in women not using 
hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy.      
For this study the following methods of contraception are considered to be acceptable 
effective contraceptive measures (based o
n annual failure rate of <1% when used consistently 
and correctly):  
•Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated
with inhibition of ovulation:
oOral
oInt
ravaginal
oTransdermal
•Progest
ogen-only hormon
al contrace
ption associ ated with inhibition of ovulation:
oOral
oInjectable
oImplantable
•Intrauterine
 device 
(IUD)
•Intrauter
ine hormone -releasing syst
em (IUS)
•Bilatera
l tubal occlusion
•Vasectomised partner
Serum pregnancy 
testing is perfor
med at Screening. Urine pregnancy testing for females of 
childbearing potential b ased on urine s
amples will be performed as specified in Appendix A . 
Any positive urine test results mus
t be confirmed based on serum pregnancy test. The 
Investigator may perform additional tests at their discretion or as requir ed by local 
regulations.  
8.2.3.3 Collecting Fasting Blood Sample and Urine for Storage  
Fasting blood sample and spot urine sample will be collected in all patients on Day 1 and 
Week 24 (or at EOT/EW for patients who discontinue the study), frozen, and archived for  
potential evaluation of safety biomarkers as needed for additional study analyses.  These 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 72 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
samples will be collected and stored in accordance with all national and local regulations, and 
after the patient has completed the informed consent process. If no analysis of the sample is performed, it will be destroyed when safety assessments required for regulatory submission of this study are complete. No genetic testing will be performed on these samples.  
8.2.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (pulse rate, respiration rate, temperature, and BP) will be measured as per the schedule in Appendix A .  
An automatic sphygmomanometer will be dispensed to sites. For BP, the patient will have 3 measurements taken on the nondomin
ant arm while seated (see Appendix G ). Prior to the first 
measurement, the patient should 
remain seated at rest for at least 5 minutes. Following the 5-
minute rest period, 3 separate seated BPs should be measured with at least 1 minute between 
BP measurement s and with the cuff fully deflated between measurements. The value for 
analysis and entry criteria (Screening) will be the mean of these 3 measurements. It is 
recommended that BPs be assessed by the same person, if feasible, using the same calibrated equipment, on the same arm. Additional measurements may be obtained if clinically 
indicated.  
Three seated pulse rate measurements will be obtained. The mean of the 3 seated pulse rate measurements will constitute the 
pulse rate value for that visit.  
Note:  Vital sign measurements should be measured after the patient has been seated for at 
least 5 minutes and prior to phlebotom
y.  
8.2.5 Physical Examinations, Height, and Weight  
Complete physical examinations will be performed at Screening, and Week 24 (or EOT). A complete physical examination will include, at minimum, a review of the patient’s general 
appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, back and extremities, skin, and general neurological system.  
A symptom -related brief physical  exam will only
  occur if the patient is experiencing 
symptoms or AEs. If a symptom- related brief physical exam is required, it should include a 
review of all body systems that relate to the symptoms and/or AE the patient is experiencing.  
Height (without sh oes) will be measured once, during Screen ing. 
Weight will be measured at Screening and at all other clinic visits. The patient should be 
weigh
ed at approximately the same time of day, wearing minimal clothing (ie, no coat/shoes), 
and using the same calibra ted scale at each visit, where possible. BMI will be calculated.  
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 73 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
8.2.6 Electrocardiograms  
The 12-lead ECG will be performed as per the schedule in Appendix A . The 12-lead ECG 
recordings should be conducted prior t
o the morning study drug administration.  ECGs should 
be recorded either prior to phlebotomy or at least 30 minutes after phlebotomy.  
All ECGs will be sent to a central ECG vendor for evaluation. Details on processing will be 
provided to the sites in a separate ECG m
anual. 
8.2.7 Demographics 
The following variables will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF: age, sex, and race/ethnicity (as permitted by local regulations).  
8.2.8 Medical History  
A general medical history will be collected at the Screening Visit and Week -2. The eCRF 
will include specific questions about relevant exclusion criteria, for example, a history of DKA. 
8.2.9 Other Assessments  
Other assessments will be completed as per the schedule Appendix A  and include: informed 
consent, medication history, FS H f
or females who are postmenopausal, and TSH (at 
Screening only; if abnormal, free thyroxine will be measured).  
8.3 Study Procedures and Assessments by Visit  
Study procedures and assessments are presented by visit in Appendix A  and Appendix I . 
8.3.1 General Guidelines  
The timing of the visits and follow -up telephone contacts for this trial are given relative to the 
day of randomization. The patients should be encouraged to return for their visits as close to  
the scheduled visit date as possible. Patients should be encouraged to fast (with the exception of water or noncaffeinated, zero -calorie beverages) for at least 8 hours before collection of 
any fasting laboratory samples. 
If the patient is unable to fast as above, the scheduled “fasting” 
laboratory samples will still be collected and the non -fasting status will be noted in the eCRF and 
on the laboratory requisition form. ALL data collected will be used in the evaluations, 
including data that may originate outside the investigative site, such as non -visit 
(unscheduled) clinical laboratory evaluations.  
Any events that occur between scheduled visits should be recorded by the Investigator as soon as they come to his or her attenti
on.  
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 74 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
Note:  If serum creatinin e increases by ≥30% above the Baseline value during the study, then 
the Investigator should consider assessment of: volume status, diuretic dosage, discontinuing 
NSAIDs, and other relevant testing including renal imaging techniques, as appropriate.  
Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors are associated with osmotic diuresis and 
volume depletion, which may lead
 to dizziness or hypotension, especially in the elderly. All 
patients will be advised to maintain proper fluid intake and to consider increasin g it if they 
sense greater thirst, more urine production, or if they feel dizzy or faint. Investigators should consider closer monitoring of renal function in patients assessed to be at risk for deterioration of renal function. This may include evaluation of relevant laboratory tests at an unscheduled 
visit a week after initiating double -blind study drug.  
Visits should be scheduled in the morning, at approximately the same time of day.  
Prior to each visit, patients should be contacted and reminded of the date and time of their appointment.  
In addition, the patient 
should be instructed to: 
1.Bring the study drug bottles (used and unused) to the clinic. Note:  Patients should not
take study drug on 
the day of the visit until instructed by site staff. Patients should be
instructed to take their basal insulin on the day of the visit, but not to take bolusinsulin on the day of the visit until instructed by site staff.
2.Bring glucose meter and study diary to the clinic visit
Study assessments will be done acco
rding to the following detailed visit s chedule presented 
in the subsequent sections.  
At each visit, patients will be asked if to their  knowledge any EOSI has occurred since the 
l
ast visit. 
8.3.2 Guidelines for Diet and Exercise during Study  
Instructions for diet and  exercise will be provided to patients. All patients will be provided 
with guidance on diet and exercise consistent with ADA guidelines for individuals with T1D, 
including training in carbohydrate counting during the Screening and single -blind Run- in 
Periods. Compliance with diet and lifestyle recommendations will be discussed with the 
patient throughout the study and specifically in case of insufficient glycemic control. In 
addition, guidance will be provided to all patients regarding GU hygiene and on mai ntaining 
general hydration ( Appendix F ). 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 75 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
8.3.3 Restrictions during Study  
Restrictions during the study are described below:  
1.Patients must maintain compliance with the dietary and physical activity changes and
goals communicated at Screening and durin
g the single -blind placebo Run- in Period.
2.Patients should be encouraged to maintain stable diet and exercise activities consistentwith their normal practices at study
 entry and for the duration of the study.
3.Strenuous exercise should be  avoided for 24 hours before planned clinic visits due to
possible effect on safety laboratory assessments.
4.Addition of new concomitant medications will be restricted as per Section 7.6.
5.Females of childbearing potential must practice an acceptable method of birth control,as detailed in Section 8.2.3.2.
9. Safety Reporting
9.1 Adverse Events  
Non-serious AE collection (including EOSI) will be initiated after the first dose of double -
blind study drug.  
Any sign, symptom, or illness occurring prior to the first dose of double -blind study drug will  
be captured in the medical 
history. Treatment -emergent adverse events are defined as any 
AEs reported after the first dose of double -blind study drug.  
An AE includes any noxious, pathological, or unintended change in anatomical, 
physiological, or metabolic funct
ions as indicated by physical signs or symptoms occurring in 
any phase of the clinical study whether or not associated with the study drug and whether or 
not considered related to the study drug. This definition includes an exacerbation of preexisting med ical conditions or events, historical conditions not present prior to study 
treatment, which reappear following study treatment, intercurrent illnesses, hypersensitivity reactions, drug interaction, or the significant worsening of the disease under investi gation that 
is not recorded elsewhere in the eCRF. Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing 
conditions that do not represent a clinically significant exacerbation or worsening need not be considered AEs.  
Any treatment -emergent abnormal laborator y result
  which is assessed as clinically significant 
by the Investigator should be recorded as an AE. In the event of clinically significant abnormal laboratory test values, the tests should be repeated and followed up until they have 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 76 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
returned to the norma l range and/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is 
determined.  
Adverse events should not be solicited with leading questions that suggest specific signs or 
symptoms. Rather, AEs should be s
olicited by asking the patient a non- leading question such 
as:  “Do you feel different in any way since receiving the dose or since the last assessment?”  
The Investigator will evaluate all AEs with regard to the maximum intensity and relationship to study drugs, as follows:  
Maximum inte
nsity should be assigned using 1 of the following 3 severity grades  
Mild: aware of event but easily tolerated  
Moderate:  discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity  
Severe: incapacitating:  patient unable to work or perform usual activity  
Relationship to study drug 
Not related:  •Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from
administration of the drug
•Event is reasonably explained by other factors, including
underlying disease, complications, concomitant drugs, or
concurrent treatment; there is no reasonable causal link between
the study drug and the AE
Unlikely related:  •Temporal sequence from administration of the study drug to
event onset suggests a doubtful or improbable causal
relationship
•Alternative explanation (including underlying disease,complications, concomitant drugs, or concurrent treatment) is
plausible and more likely
Possibly related:  •That follows a reasonable temporal sequence from
administration of the drug (including the course after withdrawalof the drug), or
•For which the possibility of the study drug being the causative
factor (eg, existence of similar reports attributed to the suspecteddrug and its analogs; reactions attributable to the
pharmacological effect) could not be excluded, although other
factors such as underlying disease, complications, concomitant
drugs, or concurrent treatment are presumable
Probably related:  •That follows a reasonable temporal sequence from
administration of the drug (including the course after withdrawal
of the drug), and
•For which the poss ibility of factors other than the drug, such as
underlying disease, complications, concomitant drugs, or
concurrent treatment, could not be excluded as the cause
Definitely related:  • Follows a clear temporal sequence from administration of the 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 77 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
study drug  
•Could not be possibly explained by the known characteristics of
the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or 
other modes of therapy administered to the patient  
•Disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the
study drug 
•Reappears or worsens when the 
study drug is re- administered
•Follows a response pattern known to be associated with
administration of the study drug
The degree of certainty with which an AE is attributed to treatment with study drug (or 
alternative causes,  eg, natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, etc.) 
will be determined by how well the event can be understood in terms of known pharmacology of the study drug and/or reaction of a similar nature being previously observed with the s tudy drug or the class of study drug.  
All AEs that occurred during treatment should be followed for at least 30 days following the last dose of study drug or until
 the event has resolved, the condition has stabilized, the 
etiology of the event is determine d to be not related to study drug, or the patient is lost to 
follow-up. For each patient for whom an AE was reported that did not resolve before the end 
of the reporting period, follow -up information on the subsequent course of events must be 
submitted to the Sponsor. This requirement indicates that follow -up may be required for some 
AEs after the patient has completed his/her participation in the study.  
9.2 Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs will be collected starting with signing informed consent and continue un til 30 days 
after the last dose of study drug. Specific information regarding collection of CV events is described in Section 9.5 (Events of Specia l Interest).  
An SAE is defined as any 
event that results in any of the following outcomes:  
1.Death;
2.Life-threatening situation, defined as one in which a patient is at immediate risk, in
the Investigator’s opinion, o
f death from the reaction as it occurs. Th is does not
include an event that might have caused death if it had occurred in a more severeform;
3.Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conductnormal life functions;
4.Inpatient 
hospitalization or prolonging of a n inpatient hospitalization;
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 78 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
5.Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a patient who received study drug;
or
6.Medical or surgical intervention that is necessary to prevent 1 of the outcomes listedin this definition
The term “hospital
ization” refers to any surgery or treatment that requires a formal admission 
into the hospital regardless of l
ength of stay. This term does not include an emergency room 
visit or admission to an outpatient facility.  
Hospitalization for preplanned elective surgery or routine clinical procedures, which are not the result of an AE, need not be consid
ered AEs. If anything untoward is reported during the 
procedure, this must be reported as an AE and either ‘serious’ or ‘non -serious’ attributed 
according to the standard criteria. Additionally, if the elective procedure had to be performed 
sooner than planned due to a worsening of the underlying medical condition, then the 
worsening medical condition would need to be reported as an AE.  
All SAEs, regardless of assessment of causal relationship to study drug, must be reported as follows: 
•Complete the SAE form utiliz
ing the AE eCRF in the electronic data capture
(EDC) system and submit within 24 hours
 of learning of the event.
The CRO will provide the Investigators with blank SAE  forms, which are to be completed in 
the 
event that access to the EDC system is not available. If the EDC system cannot be 
accessed, the completed SAE forms will be faxed to the Covance Pharmacovigilance & Drug Safety Services (PV&DSS) number below. Once t he EDC system is available, the SAE 
information must be entered within 24 hours of the system availability.  
Information not available at the time of the initial report must be documented in the EDC within 24 hours of receipt of the n
ew information. Substan tiating data such as relevant 
hospital or medical records and diagnostic test reports should be also submitted via fax to:  
Covance Pharmacovigilance & Drug Safety Services (PV&DSS) at:  
Region Telephone Number  Fax Number  
United States  +1 (888) 724 -4908 +1 (888) 887 -8097 
Outside United States  +44 1628 548171  +44 1628 540028  
An SAE that occurs after completion of the study but, in the opinion of the Investigator, is related to the study drug, should be reported as described for an SAE. If an AE does not meet the FDA’s definition of “serious” but is considered by the Investigat or to be related to the 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 79 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
study drug and of such clinical concern as to influence the overall assessment of safety, it 
must be reported as defined for an SAE.  
All patients (including discontinued patients) with an SAE must be followed until the event resolves or reaches a new Baseline, but for 
a minimum of 30 days after the last dose of study 
drug. Additionally, if the patient has died, the Investigator will obtain appropriate records to determine the cause of death, which include but are not limited to death  certificate, hospital 
records, or autopsy results.  
9.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
The applicable Regulatory Authorities and all participating Investigators shall be notified by a written expedited safety report of any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected (eg, suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction [SUSAR]), no later than 15 
calendar days from the “date learned” of the event. An AE is considered to be an adverse 
reaction if the relationship between the AE and  the study drug is classified by the Investigator 
and/or Sponsor as “possibly related,” “probably related,” or “definitely related.” In addition, the applicable Regulatory Authorities will be notified within 7 calendar days of any 
unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction. An unexpected AE is any 
adverse drug event which is not listed in the current Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. The following 
examples provide types of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE: (A) a single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be 
strongly associated with drug exposure (eg, angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson 
Syndrome); (B) one or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (eg, tendon rupture); (C) an aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other 
events that commonly occur in the study population independent  of drug therapy) that 
indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent 
or historical control group.  
An untoward and unintended response to a non -study drug is, by definition, not a S
 USAR.

9.4 Precautions 
9.4.1 Pregnanc y 
Any patient who becomes pregnant during the study must be discontinued from treatment 
immediately and should be followed through delivery or termination of the pregnancy. In 
pregnancies that progress to term, any congenital abnormalities/birth defects in  the offspring 
of a patient who received study drug should be reported as an SAE. The outcome of the pregnancy and the presence or absence of a congenital abnormality will be documented by completion of a Pregnancy Questionnaire and a Pregnancy Outcome Form in accordance with GCP and ICH guidelines and the Sponsor’s SOPs. Female patients should also notify the Investigator if they become pregnant within 30 days after last dose of study drug. The Sponsor must be notified of all pregnancies reported to the In vestigator (see Section 9.2 for 
contact information) . 
9.5 Events of Special Interest  
Events of Special Interest will be captured from first dose of dou ble-blind study drug until 30 
days after last dose of study drug.  
Events of Special Interest are characterized as:  
A)Specific events that may be related to the mechanism of action of the drug, or which maybe of special concern because of toxic
ity issues as sociated with the study drug or study
drug class. For example, by increasing the urinary excretion of glucose, SGLT inhibitors
also increase urinary output. This may lead to volume depletion in some patients. In order
to provide better information about th e incidence and extent of this AE, additional
information will be collected about any reports of volume depletion or AEs associatedwith volume depletion.
B)Rare events not known to be related to the mechanism of action of the drug or class,which are of in terest to the Sponsor
.
All hypoglycemic events are considered EOSI. With the exception of hypoglycemia, all EOSI 
are considered to be AEs and should be 
reported on the AE eCRF as described in Section 9.1. 
For each EOSI reported, sites will be 
prompted to complete an EOSI Targeted Questionnaire. 
(In case an EOSI meets criteria to be reported as an SAE, please follow procedures as 
described in Section 9.2).  
•Events of Special Interest are:
oHypoglycemia (see Section 9.5.1)
oDKA,
 including all cases o
f metabolic acidosis (see Section 9.5.2)
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 81 of 130

Note:  Other AEs 
may be determined to be of special interest. As applicable, relevant Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activi
ties (MedDRA) terms will be described in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).  
The following EOSI will be adjudicated in  a treatment blinded fashion: severe  hypoglycemia 
(or hypoglycemia reported as an SAE), DKA (including all cases of metabolic acidosis), 
MACE/other specified CV events, and DILI.  
For the EOSI that require adjudication, the site will need to collect and sub mit copies of 
supporting source document
s to the Sponsor’s designee. Specific instructions regarding this 
process will be provided in the Site File Notebook. Algorithms defining the evaluation of liver laboratory abnormalities (possible DILI) are located i n Appendix E . 
Details regarding the membership, remit, and operations of the adjudication committee will be contained in the respective charter.  
9.5.1 Hypoglycemia or Symptoms Suggestive of Hypoglycemia  
Hypoglycemia is a common complication of insulin therapy.  According to recent data, severe 
hypoglycemia is common in T1D with at least one SH event in the prior 3 months reported 
by 6% of the 2,561 participants in a survey of those with T1D. The highest occurrence being 
in those age 50 years and older [ 18]. Whenever the patient has symptoms suggestive of 
hypoglycemia, SMBG should be performed prior to treatment of the event with carbohydrate administration unless safety considerations necessitate immediate treatment prior to

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
confirmat ion with SMBG. For every episode of hypoglycemia, regardless of severity, the 
patients should complete the appropriate hypoglycemia data in the study diary provided by 
the study site. In addition, especially in case of recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, t he 
patients should be encouraged to contact their study site for instructions on appropriate 
management of their diabetes.  
Patients are instructed to contact the Investigator as soon as possible following any severe 
hypoglycemic episode for review of 
data and to assess if a change in insulin therapy is 
required.  
The patient will record whether symptoms of hypoglycemia were present or absent for each episode of documented hypoglycemia 
on the provided study diary as soon as possible after 
the episode, so that this information can be reviewed by the site during the next visit. 
Documentation for duration of a hypoglycemic episode is only required for cases of severe hypoglycemia.  
Treatment of documented hypoglycemia requires the ingestion of carbohydrates (glucose). In most cases, 15 to 20 grams of glucose is
 the preferred treatment. A rise in blood sugar and 
change in symptoms should occur within 15 to 20 minutes. Re -treatment may be required in 
certain instances. The patient should be instructed to retest b lood glucose 15 to 20 minutes 
after treatment, and re -treat every 15 to 20 minutes if hypoglycemia has not resolved.  
Standardized definitions of hypoglycemia are being utilized across the sotagliflozin 
development program. The definiti
ons and procedures described below will be implemented 
across the sotagliflozin program.  
In the sotagliflozin program, hypoglycemic events will be categorized as either (1) Severe 
Hypoglycemia or (2) Documented Hypo
glycemia. An episode may meet criteria for both 
categories. In accordance with the February 2008 FDA draft Diabetes Guidance[ 19], and the 
2012 EMA Diabetes Guideline[ 20], hypoglyc
emic events reported in this trial will be 
classified as severe hypoglycemia,
 documented symptomatic hypoglycemia, or documented 
asymptomatic hypoglycemia per the following definitions:   
1.Severe hypoglycemia: Severe hypoglycemia has occurred if the answer is yes to any
of the following 3 questions:
a.Did 
the patient have an episode of suspected hypoglycemia treated with any
form of carbohydrate or with glucago
n that required the assistance of others to
treat?
b.Did the patient lose consciousness during the episode?
-OR- 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 83 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
c.Did the patient have a seizure during the episode? Note: “patient requires the
assistance of others to treat” means that the neurologic impairment was severeenough to prevent self -treatment in the opinion of those providing assistance
to treat. Note:  Assisting a patient out of kindness, when assistance is not
required, should not be considered as “requiring the assistance of others totreat.”
2.Documented symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycemia:
a.Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia:  An event during which  typical
symptoms of hypoglycemia 
are accompanied by a concurrent fingerstick
(SMBG) or venous glucose result of ≤70 mg/dL [≤3.9 mmol/L].
-OR- 
b. Documented asymptomatic hypoglycemia: An event not accompanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycemia 
but with a me asured fingerstick (SMBG) 
or venous glucose result of ≤70 mg/dL [≤3.9 mmol/L]  
Hypoglycemia is considered an EOSI for the sotagliflozin program. The Investigator will record all occurrences of documented hypog
lycemia or severe hypoglycemia in the 
Hypoglycem ia Reporting eCRF. In case an event meets criteria for both documented and 
severe hypoglycemia, both sections of the Hypoglycemia Reporting eCRF will be completed. Hypoglycemia data will be assessed at each visit by evaluating all available glycemic data.  
The primary data sources will be glucose meter data from the web -based portal and/or 
point-of-care glucose meter download/meter memory review. These primary data sources are 
supplemented by other available data, study diary, and laboratory blood glucose v alues.  
Because the analysis for hypoglycemia will be based on data recorded on the Hypoglycemia Reporting eCRF and not the AE eCRF
, it is requested that the Investigator not submit 
hypoglycemic events on the AE eCRF unless the episode meets criteria for an SAE (as described in Section 9.2). However, the Investigator is not prohibited from characterizing 
hypoglycemia as an AE. Any  event o
f hypoglycemia reported as an AE will be cross -checked 
to ensure that the event is also reported on the Hypoglycemia Reporting eCRF.  
All hypoglycemia event s reported by the Investigator as sever e and/or reported as SAEs will 
be adjudicated by experts blinded to the treatment assignment. Details regarding processes to be followed will be described in the CEC Charter.  
Hypoglycemia will be analyzed as incidenc e of patients (%) with at least 1 hypog
 lycemic 
event and the number of severe hypoglycemic events per patient per year of exposure, and the number of documented hypoglycemic events per patient per day. Subanalysis of total

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
documented hypoglycemia (symptoma tic plus asymptomatic), documented symptomatic 
hypoglycemia, documented asymptomatic hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemic events 
will be performed.  
Severe and documented hypoglycemia will be further characterized as follows:  
•Nocturnal hypoglycemia defined by the time of day: any hypoglycemia of the above
categories that occurs between 00:00 an
d 05:59 hours, regardless of whether the
patient was awake or woke up because of the event
•Daytime hypoglycemia defined by the time of day: any hypoglycemia that occur s
between 06:00 to 23:59
Severe hypoglycemi
a will be further characterized as: 
•Nocturnal hypoglycemia by sleep status: hypoglycemia waking up the patient from
sleep after having gone to bed in the e
vening and before getting up in the morning
before admini stration of any insulin
9.5.2 Diabetic Ketoacidosis  
Diabetic ketoacidosis is the most serious hyperglycemic emergency in patients with T1D and 
T2DM. According to recent data, DKA is common in T1D with at least one DKA event in the 
prior 3 months reported by 3% o f the 2,561 participants in a survey of those with T1D.The 
highest occurrence being in young adults (5%), and those with high A1C (up to 12% in those with A1C ≥ 9%) [ 18]. In adult patients mortality of less than 2% has been reported in 
controlled clinical studies; morta 
lity is increased in the elderly and patients with life -
threatening concomitant illnesses. Common precipitating factors include infections, intercurre nt illnesses, psychological stress, and noncompliance with insulin therapy. Clinical 
features of DKA at presentation can be nonspecific; however, most patients complain of polydipsia and polyuria for several days before onset of DKA. Other common symptoms include generalized weakness, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The 
laboratory triad of hyperglycemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis defines DKA. A 
commonly used classification of mild, moderate, and severe DKA is described below in  Table 
9.5.2-1. In regard to the 2 cases of DKA 
that occurred with empagliflozin, [5] it was noted 
that 1 patient presente d 
with plasma 
glucose of 17.0 mmol/L (306 mg/dL) and another 
presented with plasma glucose of 11.8 mmol/L (212 mg/dL). The authors noted, “Specifically, both patients presented with plasma glucose concentrations that could be interpreted as lower than typically associated with diabetic ketoacidosis.” In the sotagliflozin 
T1D phase 2 study, (LX4211.203), the 2 cases with DKA that occurred on sotagliflozin had 
blood glucose values of 30.7 mmol/L (553 mg/dL) and 20.9 mmol/L (376  mg/dL). However, 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 85 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
it is possible  that DKA could present with glucose values ≤250 mg/dL in patients treated with 
sotagliflozin.  
Table 9.5.2-1 Diagnostic Criteria for DKA for Patien ts Not Treated with Investigational 
Agents

bEffective serum osmolality = 2[Na+ (mEq/L)] + [glucose (mg/dL)/18]  
 In the table, anion gap = [Na+] – [Cl- + HCO 3-] with the normal anion gap referenced as “between 7 and 9 
mEq/L, and an anion gap > 10 -12 mEq/L indicates the presence of increased anion gap metabolic acidosis”. 
However, the normal range for each of the individual measurements varies depending upon the specific 
methodology used. In addition, the serum potassium can be included in the anion gap measurement, resulting in a normal range that is approximately 4 mEq/L higher than the number calculated using the preceding equation. As a result, interpretation of the anion gap s hould be based on the laboratory reference range for the anion gap, 
and considering baseline values for the individual patient.

The therapeutic goals in DKA management include restoration of circulatory volume and 
tissue perfusion, decreasing serum glucose, clearance of serum ketoacids, and correction of electrolyte abnormalities.  
Instructions for the patient and site staf f: 
At every clinic visit blood BHB (central laboratory and point -of-care) testing will be 
conducted. At visi
ts where UA is performed, the evaluation will include urine ketone 
determination by dipstick. 
It is possible that GI or other AEs occurring with LX4211 may mask presenting symptoms of 
DKA (Ap
pendix F). These symptoms include but are not limited to: inability to maintain oral 
intake, generalized weakness, excessive thir
st, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, rapid 
weight loss, fever, frequent urination, fruity -scented breath, confusion, acute illness and/or 
consistently elevated blood glucose. Therefore, it is important that patients with GI 
complaints or intercurrent illness be instructed by the site to measure their blo od or urine 
ketone or blood BHB levels.

(Note: In some patients alcohol may be a possible trigger for ketosis).  
If ketosis is present (moderate or higher for urine ketones or blood BHB level is >0.6 
mmol/L), then the patient  will be asked to c
ontact the Investigative site immediately . In this 
situation, the investigator should consider instructing the patient to take rapid acting insulin 
by syringe (not insulin pump) as well as eat carbohydrates in order to reverse the ketosi s.  
After rechecking the ketones, the investigator should consider instructing the patient to take 
additional doses of rapid acting insulin every  2 hours until elevated ketones are normalized.  
Because the amount of insulin needed to lower ketones will als o lower blood glucose, it is 
necessary for the patient to increase carbohydrate intake. Typically this would be 15 -30 
grams of carbohydrate each hour provided by a glucose containing sports drink or oral rehydration fluid. The site will evaluate if an assessment for metabolic acidosis is 
appropriate. If laboratory testing confirms presence of metabolic acidosis, then the “Possible 
DKA” eCRF will be completed.  If nausea and vomiting are present and the patient is unable to keep liquids down the patient shou ld be evaluated in an Emergency Room.  
If a patient is scheduled for a procedure or surgery that requires withholding oral intake (NPO), it is recommended that study
 drug is held from the day prior to procedure or surgery 
and resumed the day after procedure or surgery is complete and patient is tolerating adequate 
oral intake.  
An independent adjudication committee composed of experts in T1D will adjudicate cases of 
DKA (including all cases of metabol
ic acidosis) in a blinded fashion (see Section 9.6). 
Details regarding processes to be follow
ed will be described in the charter.  
9.6 Safety Monitoring and Oversight Committees  
9.6.1 Data Monitoring Committee  
The DMC  is an expert advisory group, made up of members independent of the Sponsor 
and/or designee that is responsible for evaluating cumulative safety data at regular intervals. 
The primary objective of the DMC is to monitor patient safety by reviewing the avail able 
clinical data at scheduled time points. The DMC may also conduct ad hoc meetings, as necessary. Following each meeting, the DMC will make a recommendation to the Sponsor regarding the study. The details regarding the DMC processes and procedures will be outlined 
in the DMC  Charter, which will be finalized prior to the review of any data.  
9.6.2 Clinical Endpoint Committee  
The CEC(s) is/(are) composed  of experts in cardiology and neurology (and other appropriate 
medical specialties such as hepatology and endocrinology) who are independent of the Sponsor 
and the CRO. The CECs will review and adjudicate all deaths, EOSI, including 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 87 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
MACE/selected CV events (MI, stroke, hospitalization due to un stable angina, urgent 
coronary revascularizations and hospitalization due to heart failure), clinical or laboratory 
findings associated with DILI, DKA, and severe hypoglycemia episodes (as well as 
hypoglycemia reported as an SAE) in a treatment -blinded fas hion. DILI events will also be 
assessed for causality.  
The details regarding the CEC processes and procedures will be outlined in the CEC 
Charter(s), which will be finali
zed prior to the review of any data.  
9.6.3 Steering Committee  
The Steering Committee will serve in an advisory capacity to the Sponsor on multiple clinical trials in the sotagliflozin development program. This committee will meet at regular intervals throughout the program to receive status updates on each of the individual trials and to 
provide recommendations regarding trial status and conduct of the studies in the sotagliflozin 
program included in their remit. The Steering Committee will operate under the principles, 
and have the roles and responsibilities, outlined in the Steering Committee Ch arter. 
10. Statistical Methodology
10.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size will be based on satisfying design assumptions made for the primary efficacy endpoint. The primary efficacy endpoint is a binomial proportion, a composite measure of glycemic control and safety. We have assumed that the majority of treatment effect will be 
observed in the glycemic control portion of the endpoint and for planning purposes, the rates 
of severe hypoglycemia and DKA will be equal in both treatment groups. Little data ar e 
available to estimate the <7% A1C component of the endpoint in this patient population. Data reviewed from the LX4211.1- 202 Phase 2 trial in T2DM and from other pertinent literature 
sources suggests that a difference between treatment groups of at least 0.15 may be expected 
for this variable. We will assume this effect size for the primary endpoint, but will perform an adjustment for the expected proportion of patients not having a DKA or severe hypoglycemia 
event. A conservative assumption is made that the rates of DKA and severe hypoglycemia are 
independent and their union is estimated to be ≤0.15. It is expected that 0.85 of the patients will not have a DKA or a severe hypoglycemic event over the course of the study. Adjusting the 0.15 effect size estimate by this value yields a target effect size for the primary endpoint ≈0.12. Since the underlying placebo rate is unknown for the composite outcome, we will assume a maximum variance construct under the alternative hypothesis for binomial proportions to e stimate the sample size (ie,  the mean of the pooled responses rates is 0.50). 
Assuming a 2-sided test with α = 0.05 and 90% power, 380 patients are needed per treatment 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 88 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
group to detect a difference in binomial proportions of at least 0.12 for the primary e ndpoint. 
The sample size estimate will be adjusted for dropouts in a manner to reflect that the primary 
analysis will be conducted in the modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) patients. Dropouts are 
expected to be primarily a function of noncompliance: patients stopping early their 
randomized treatment, but followed to the 24-week visit. It is further assumed that the 
dropped (noncompliant) sotagliflozin patients will respond as the placebo patients and that there will be no drop- in patients in the placebo group.  These assumptions net an adjusted 
effect size for detection of 0.12 x (1-0.20) ≈ 0.10, where the dropout rate over 24 weeks is 
assumed to be 20%. Based on this adjusted effect size, 544 patients are required per treatment group, for a total of 1088  patients across the 2 treatment groups.  
The occurrence of severe hypoglycemia is an important safety component of the primary 
endpoint. It is desirable that the s
tudy sample includes enough patients so that a reliable 
estimate of treatment difference can be obtained for this outcome. Based on a literature 
review, it seems reasonable to assume that the rate of severe hypoglycemia, defined as the number of patients experiencing at least 1 such episode divided by the number of mITT patients (ie, a binomial proporti on), is ≤0.10 over a 24 -week period. We will assume this rate 
is the same in both treatment groups, yielding an expected difference of 0.0. A 2 -sided, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) based on normal approximation methods and corrected for continuity is associated with a distance value (ω) of 0.033 for a sample size of 700 patients per group; ω 
is the extended distance from the observed difference in one or both directions. The upper bound of this CI will exclude values greater than 0.05; ie, a 50% increase in the expected placebo rate.  
Based on the considerations mentioned above, a sample size of 700 patients per treatment group (1400 total patients) seems to be 
an appropriate target for the study.  
For the satiety substudy, assuming a dropout rate of 20% over  the course of the study, a 
sample size
 of approximately 224 patients (112 per treatment group) demonstrating a change 
greater than 30% would be necessary to obtain statistical power at the recommended 0.80 
level (alpha = 0.05). To achieve this number of patients for evaluation, 280 patients will be 
recruited to participate in the substudy.

10.2 Analysis Populations  
10.2.1 Randomized Population  
Randomized patients are those who provide informed consent, and have a randomized kit 
allocated and assigned to study treat ment by IXRS. Data summaries using this population 
will include all Baseline data as appropriate (eg, patient demographics).  
10.2.2 Modified Intent -to-Treat and Per -Protocol Populations  
The mITT population includes all randomly assigned patients who have taken a t least 1 dose 
of study drug during the Treatment Period. Treatment group assignment will be based on the 
randomized treatment, which may not match the actual treatment received.  
The Per-protocol (PP) population includes all patients in the mITT population  who complete 
treatment through th
e primary assessment of 24 weeks, and have no significant protocol 
violations that will impact the collection or interpretation of efficacy data. Identification of all patients in the PP population will be determined befor e the database lock and unblinding. The 
PP patients will be assigned to treatment groups based on the treatment they received.  
The Satiety population includes all patients in the mITT population who elect to participate in the satiety substudy and completed ≥8
 satiety daily diaries (ie, the PSDDs) during the placebo 
Run-in Period. Identification of all patients in the satiety population meeting these criteria 
will be determined before database lock and unblinding.  
10.2.3 Safety Population 
Safety analyses will be based on the Safety population, defined as all randomly assigned 
patients who have taken at least 1 dose of study drug and are classified according to their actual treatment received.

10.4 Statistical Methods  
A more detailed description of the analysis and reporting of data will be provided in an SAP. 
An overview of the main analysis strategy is provided in the following sections.  
10.4.1 Efficacy Analyses  
All primary efficacy analyses will be based on the mITT population. Supportive analysis of the efficacy data will be performed using the PP population.  
Primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint at Week 24 will use a Cochran -Mantel-
Haenszel (CMH) test stratified b
y BMI at Screening (<25 kg/m2, ≥25 kg/m2), Week -2 A1C 
(≤9%, >9%), and use o f CSII at Screening (Yes, No). Missing observations will be imputed 
as non-responders. A point estimate of treatment effect will be based on the sotagliflozin 
minus difference in binomial proportions. A 2 -sided 95% CI will be estimated on the 
observed difference and will be based on normal approximation methods using a continuity correction factor. The individual components of the endpoint will be summarized separately 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 92 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
using descriptive statistics. Each of these components will be expressed as a binomial 
proportion: proportion of patients with A1C <7.0% at Week 24, proportion of patients with 
≥1 episodes of DKA after randomization, and proportion of patients with ≥1 episodes of severe hypoglycemia after randomization.  
Sensitivity analysis of the primary endp oint will use a single imputation met
 hod to obtain a 
rectangular dataset. Imputations will be based on use of the last observation carried forward (LOCF) algorithm. The stratified CMH test will be applied  to this imputed dataset. The 
stratified CMH test wi ll also be applied to the PP dataset as an additional sensitivity analysis.  
Primary analysis of the continuous efficacy endpoints will use mixed -effects model for 
repeated measures (MMR
M) statistics based on the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) 
method for estimation. The analysis model will include fixed, categorical effects of treatment, 
BMI at Screening (<25 kg/m2, ≥25 kg/m2), Week -2 A1C (≤9%, >9%), use of CSII at 
Screening (Yes, No), time (study week), Baseline -dependent variable -by-time interaction , and 
a treatment -by-time interaction. An unstructured (co)variance structure will be used to model 
the within -patient errors. Other structures will be explored by use of Akaike’s information 
criteria should the unstructured (co)variance structure not result in model convergence. The Kenward-Roger approximation will be used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom. 
The adjusted mean change  from Baseline by each study week for each treatment group will 
be estimated in the framework of this model, as well as the between -group differences 
(comparing sotagliflozin to placebo) and the 95% CIs for the adjusted mean. All 
post-Baseline observations collected at scheduled visits will be used in the MMRM, 
including data collected after the discontinuation of stu dy drug. An analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) will be applied where only 1  post-Baseline scheduled visit occurs; ie, the 
MMRM analysis omitting the time -related effects.  
For binary endpoints estimated as binomial proportions, the frequency and proportion of patients achieving the outcome will 
be presented by treatment group at each assessed study 
week. The primary analysis of these endpoints will use a CMH test stratified by the different 
levels of the randomization stratification factors of BMI at Screening (<25 kg/m2, ≥25 
kg/m2), Week -2 A1C (≤9%, >9%), and use of CSII at Screening (Yes, No). These treatment 
group comparisons will be performed at Week 24 only. The earlier study weeks will use 
descriptive analyses to summarize the data. These descriptive stat istics will include the 
patient counts and proportions, point estimates of treatment effect, and 95% CIs of the treatment effect. Missing observations at Week 24 will be imputed as non -responders; only 
the observed data will be summarized at the earlier st udy visits. Endpoints comprised of 
multiple outcomes will use descriptive methods to summarize each component by treatment group at each study week.  
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 93 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
The test for superiority of sotagliflozin versus placebo based on the primary efficacy endpoint 
will be per formed at the 2-sided 0.05 α- level. If this null hypothesis is rejected, a sequential 
procedure will be used to maintain the overall Type I error rate at a 2 -sided, 0.05 α-level 
across analyses of the secondary endpoints at Week 24. The secondary endpoints  will be 
specified in a hierarchy and the first listed will be tested at the same Type I error used for the primary endpoint comparison (α = 0.05). If this test rejects the null hypothesis, then the next 
listed secondary endpoint will be tested at the same Type I error rate. This testing sequence 
will continue as long as the null hypothesis is rejected at the 0.05  α-level. The testing 
sequence will be broken at the first instance that a null hypothesis is not rejected. Once the sequence is broken, no later hypothesis in the hierarchy will be tested. The order of testing will be: 
•A1C change from Baseline at Week 24
•Body weight at Week 24 change from Baseline (absolute and percent change; the
absolute change will be used in the sequ
ence of analyses)
•SBP change  from Baseline at Week 16 in the subse t of patients with Baseline SBP
≥130 mm Hg
•Percent change from Baseline in bolus insulin dose at Week  24
In addition, raw P -values and 95% CIs w
ill be computed for tests of all secondary endpoint 
hypotheses. These raw or unadjusted statistics will be used as descriptive summaries of the 
data and will not be used for formal testing of the hypotheses.  
10.4.2 Subgroup Analyses  
Subgroup analyses of the efficacy variables will be performed, as needed, for the different 
levels of th e randomization stratification factors and the subgroups derived by other efficacy 
endpoint definitions (eg, SBP). Of particular interest are subgroup analyses of the efficacy 
variables by Baseline eGFR status (≥45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 versus ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2), 
Week -2 A1C (≤9.0%, >9.0%), Week  -2 A1C (≤7.7% versus ≥7.7%), BMI (<25 kg/m2, ≥25 
kg/m2), use of CSII at Screening (Yes, No), and age at time of T1D diagnosis (≤18 years of 
age, >18 years of age). Additional subgroup analyses may be conducted and will be described in the SAP. All subgroup analyses will be exploratory.  
10.4.3 Safety Analyses  
Safety analysis will primarily involve examination of descriptive statistics and individual patient listings for any effects of study treatment on clinical tolerabili ty and safety. 
Summaries will be prepared by treatment group and, as needed, by clinic visit. These 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 94 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
summaries will be based on the Safety population and other subpopulations as needed. All 
safety data (AEs, EOSI, laboratory test results, vital signs, ECG r esults, and physical 
examinations) will be provided in listings.  
The evaluation of AEs is described in Section 10.4.3.1.  
Vital signs, physical ex amination findings, laboratory results, and ECGs will be summarized 
descriptively at each time point. Actual and change from Baseline data will be calculated and summarized. In addition, shift table analyses will be presented for the laboratory data.  
The analysis of hypoglycemic events will be conducted per the definitions provided in 
Section 9.5.1 and methods described f 
or binary, continuous, and other variables in 
Section 10.4.1. Since these data also serve as a 
measure of safety, additional analyses will be 
conducted. The first analysis will 
be performed using CMH tests stratified by the 
randomization factors at each clinic visit. These tests will provide inferential and descriptive 
summaries of the relative risk estimate for each of the 2 hypoglycemic event definitions: ≤70 mg/dL and ≤55 mg/dL by SMBG. The patient incidence of these hypoglycemic events 
will be counted over the week prior to the scheduled clinic visit used in the analysis. The second analysis of these data will examine the relative risk for each of the hypoglycemic event definitions over the entire Treatment Period by use of a generalized linear model (GLM). The GLM will include fixed, categorical effects of treatment; BMI at Screening (<25 kg/m
2, ≥25 kg/m2), Week -2 A1C (≤9%, >9%), use of CSII at Screening (Yes, No) , and 
an offset term for study duration. The events will be modeled as a negative binomial process. 
10.4.3.1 Adverse Events 
All AEs will be coded and listed by body system and preferred term based on MedDRA. Summaries using descriptive statistics will be provided for TEAEs, drug -related AEs, and 
AEs by intensity. Treatment -emergent adverse events are those events not present at Baseline, 
but occurring after the start of study treatment, or if existing at Baseline, increasing in intensity after the initiation of study drug. When multiple occurrences of the same event are 
reported for th e same patient, summaries made by intensity will select the event with the 
highest intensity. In a similar manner, summaries prepared by drug relationship will select the 
event with the greatest degree of relationship when a patient reports multiple occurrences of the same event. On- study deaths will be reported for deaths occurring during the active phase 
of the Treatment Period and 30 days after stopping study drug. Also, deaths occurring outside the 30-day window, but secondary to an AE reported within t he 30-day post-Treatment 
Period, will be reported.  
Treatment -emergent adverse event summaries will include the overall incidence (number of 
patients with the event) and number of 
events by system organ class and preferred term, 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 95 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
overall incidence sorted by  descending frequency across treatment groups, events by 
maximum intensity, events by relationship to study treatment, and events leading to 
discontinuation of study drug; SAEs and EOSI will also be summarized. Listings will be provided for deaths, SAEs an d discontinuations due to AEs. Additional summaries or listings 
of AEs may also be provided.  
10.4.4 Meta-analyses 
The occurrence of the following events will be statistically analyzed using data from this study combined with other Phase 2/3 trials conducted in T1D and T2DM patients: severe hypoglycemia, DKA, DILI, and MACE. Details of the analysis models and related assumptions will be documented in separate meta- analysis plans.  
11. Study Management
Ethical and Regulatory Standards are presented in Appendix B ; Investigator Obligations are 
presented in Appendix C . 
The Investigato
r is responsible for completing and maintaining adequate and accurate eCRFs 
and source documentation. Source docume
ntation constitutes original records, which may 
include:  progress notes, medication administration records, laboratory reports, ECG tracings, discharge summaries, etc.  
All data on the eCRF must be recorded in accordance with the eCRF completion guidelines. If a correction is necessary, it should
 be made by the Investigator or a designated qualified 
individual as specified within the guidelines. All eCRFs should be completed in their entirety and stored in a confidential and secure location. The Investigator m ust sign the Investigator’s 
statement in each patient’s eCRF indicating that the data reported are accurate.  
At the study site, CRAs will verify eCRFs against source documentation using a targeted approach consistent with Risk -Based Moni
toring guidance. Computer programmed edit 
checks will be run against the database to check for discrepancies and ensure that the data are reasonable. The safety database will be reconciled with the clinical database. All issues 
resulting from the computer generated checks and the safety database reconciliation will be 
resolved according to standard data management practices in conjunction with the Sponsor and/or designee, clinical study personnel, and the study Investigators.  
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 96 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
11.1 Data Handling and Quality Assurance  
11.1.1 Data Recording  
Entries made in the eCRF must be verifiable against source documents (the patient’s medical 
records) with the exception of race and ethnicity. For all other data, source documentation 
must be available.  
In this protocol, all information captured (“entered,” “documented,” “recorded”) becomes part of the Sponsor’s database.  
11.1.2 Description of General Procedure 
The designated CRO will supply each investigational site with access to a web -based EDC 
computer system. Edit checks and data logic checks are at the point of entry and are validated according to the CRO’s SOPs. All data entered into the system is transferred to a secure 
database maintained by the CRO.  
Access to the EDC system at the site, for vendors, for the Sponsor and Sponsor’s designee, is 
password  protected. Study access is gran 
ted to site personnel only after they have been 
trained in the use of the EDC system.  
The EDC system contains a system -generated audit trail that captures any c hanges made to a 
data field, including who made the change, and the date and time it was made. This information is available at the Investigator’s site and at the Sponsor and/or designee.  
Data entries should be made into the EDC system in a timely manner after a clinic visit, but 
not to exceed 10 days after t
he clinic visit has occurred. All data entered must be supported 
by source documents maintained for all patients enrolled in this study.  
11.2 Monitoring  
The Sponsor is responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of the study with regard to ethics, protocol adherence, site procedures, integrity of the data, and applicable laws and/or regulations. At regular intervals during the study and following completion of the study, the Sponsor’s and Sponsor’s designee’s study monitors will contact the study site via visits to the 
site, telephone calls, and/or letters in order to review study progress, eCRF completion, and 
address any concerns or questions regarding the study conduct. A risk -based monitoring 
approach is planned for this study, where elements of targeted source data verification 
focusing on critical data and risk -targeted monitoring interventions will be employed. The 
risk-based monitoring approach will be documented in the monitoring plan. During 
monitoring visits, the following aspects of study conduct will be careful ly reviewed:  
informed consent of patients, patient recruitment, patient compliance with the study 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 97 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
procedures, source data verification, drug accountability, use of concomitant therapy by 
patients, general safety documentation and reporting, and quality of  data. Records pertaining 
to these aspects are expected to be kept current.  
The Investigator must make study data accessible to the clinical monitor, to the Sponsor 
and/or Sponsor’s designee, and to r
egulatory inspectors.  
11.3 Audits and Inspections  
The Sponsor  and/or Sponsor’s designee, Regulatory Authority, or Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) or Ethics Review Committee (ERC) may visit the study site at any time during the 
study or after completion of the study to perform audits or inspections. The purpose of a  
Sponsor audit or regulatory inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted 
according to the protocol, GCP, ICH guidelines, and any other applicable regulatory 
requirements. Investigators should contact the Sponsor and/or Sponsor’s designee immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an inspection at their site.  
11.4 Amendments  
Any amendments to the protocol will be written by the Sponsor or desig nee and approved by 
the Sponsor. All amendments must be submitted to the appropriate IRB or ERC for approval prior to implementing the changes. In some instances, an amendment may require changes to the informed consent form (ICF), which also must be submi tted for IRB or ERC approval 
prior to administration to patients. If any changes to the eCRF are required, the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee will issue supplemental or revised eCRF pages.  
11.5 Record Keeping  
11.5.1 Drug Accountability 
The Investigator must maintain a ccurate records of study drug receipt, dispensing 
information, and disposition. If the Investigator cannot account for all clinical supplies at the termination of the study, a written explanation must be provided.  
11.5.2 Health Insurance Portability and Accountab ility Act of 1996 
and Subsequent Updates  
The Investigator agrees to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the privacy of patient health information, including, but not limited to, the Standards for Individually Identifiable Health Information, 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164 HIPAA Privacy Regulation and any applicable updates). The Investigator shall ensure that 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 98 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
study patients authorize the use and disclosure of protected health information in accordance 
with HIPAA P rivacy Regulation and other local applicable regulations, and in a form 
satisfactory to the Sponsor.  
11.5.3 Financial Disclosure  
The Investigator and any sub -Investigator shall provide to the Sponsor and/or Sponsor’s 
designee sufficient accurate financial information to allow the Sponsor and/or Sponsor’s designee to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the FDA and/or other applicable Regulatory Authorities . The Investigator shall promptly 
update this information if any r elevant changes occur in the course of the study or for 1 year 
following completion of the study.  
11.5.4 Access to Original Records  
It is an expectation of Regulatory Authorities that monitors, auditors, and representatives of national and international government regulatory agency bodies have access to original source documentation (see examples in Section 11) to ensure data integrity. “Original” in this 
context is defined as the first docu
mentation of an observation and does not differentiate 
between hard copy and electronic records.  
11.5.5 Retention of Study Documents  
According to 21 CFR Part 312.62, ICH E6, and the guidance documents applying to clinical trials in Volume 10 of the publication "The rules governing medicinal products in the 
European Union," study -related records must be retained for at least 2 years after the last 
approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending  or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region, or at least 2  years have elapsed since 
the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required  by applicable 
regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the Sponsor.  
The Investigator must not destroy any study -related records without receiving approv
 al from 
the Sponsor and/or Sponsor’s designee. The Investigator must notify the Sponsor and/or Sponsor’s designee in the event of accidental loss or destruction of any study records. If the 
Investigator leaves the institution where the study was conducted, the Sponsor and/or Sponsor’s designee must be contacted to arrange alternative record storage o ptions. 
Essential documents shall be archived safely and securely in such a way that ensures that they are readily available upon authorities
’ request. 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 99 of 130 

Prot ocol No. LX4211.312  
Patient (hospital) files will be archived according to local regulations and in accordance with 
the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution, or private practice. Where 
the archiving procedures do not meet the minimum timelines required by the Sponsor, alternative arrangements must be made to ensure the availability of the source documen ts for 
the required period.  
The Investigator/institution must notify the Sponsor and/or Sponsor’s designee if the archival arrangements change (eg, relocation or 
transfer of ownership).  
The Investigator site file is not to be destroyed without the Sponsor’ s and/or Sponsor’s 
designee’s approva
l. 
The Investigator’s contract will contain all regulations relevant for the investigational site.  
12. Administrative Structure of the Study
The study will be monitored by the Sponsor and/or designee. The following functions for this study will be performed by organizations designated by the Sponsor: medical monitoring, data management and statistical analysis, study drug randomization and dist ribution, routine 
site monitoring, medical writing, SAE reporting, and project management.  Additionally, an 
independent DMC, CEC, and T1D Steering committee will provide oversight.

Protoc ol No. LX4211.312 
15. Appendix C – Investigator Obligations
Per Title 21 of the US Government Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) Parts 50 and 56, 
the study protocol and the final version of the patient Informed Consent Form (ICF) will be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Review Committee (ERC) 
before enrollment of any patients. The opinion of the IRB or ERC will be dated and given in 
writing. A copy of the letter of approval from the IRB or ERC and a copy of the approved ICF will be  received by the Sponsor prior to shipment of study drug supplies to the 
Investigator.  
The Investigator will ensure that the IRB or ERC will be promptly informed of all changes in the research activity and of all u
nanticipated problems including risk to pa tients. The 
Investigator will also ensure that no changes will be made to the protocol without IRB or 
ERC approval.  
As a part of the IRB’s or ERC’s requirement for continuing review of approved research, the 
Investigator will be responsible 
for submitting periodic progress reports to the IRB or ERC at 
intervals appropriate to the degree of patient risk involved, but no less than once per year.  
Written informed consent must be given freely and obtained from every patient prior to clinical trial participation . The righ 
ts, safety, and wellbeing of the trial patients are the most 
important considerations and should prevail over interests of science and society.  
As described in Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, study personnel involved in 
conducting this trial will be qualifi
ed by education, training, and experience to perform their 
respective task(s). Study personnel will not include individuals against whom sanctions have 
been invoked after scientific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medical licensure, debarment). Quality assurance systems and procedures will be implemented to assure the quality of every aspect of the study.  
Principal Investigators must provide the Sponsor with a fully executed Form FDA 1572 (Statement of Investigator) and a
ll updates on a new fully executed Form FDA 1572.  
Principal Investigators must provide the Sponsor with his/her own curriculum vitae and current curriculum vitae for each sub -Inve 
stigator listed on Form FDA 1572.  
Protection of Human Subjects (21 CFR Part 50) 
Informed co nsent must be obtained from every patient before entry into a clinical study. It 
must be given freely and not under duress. Consent must be documented by use of an IRB - or 
ERC-approved consent form and signed by the patient or the patient’s legally authori zed 
representative. Non -English-speaking patients must be presented with a consent form written 
in a language that they understand. A copy of the signed consent form must be given to the 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 106 of 130 

Protoc ol No. LX4211.312 
patient signing it. Another copy must be kept in the Investigator’s f iles and made available to 
the FDA and/or other applicable Regulatory Authorities  representatives upon request. If, for 
any reason, patient risk is increased as the study progresses, a revised, IRB - or ERC-approved 
consent form must be signed by the patient. Before the study begins, a sample of the consent 
form must be provided to the Sponsor and/or Sponsor’s designee for review. The FDA and/or 
other applicable Regulatory Authorities  may reject otherwise scientifically valid studies if 
proper informed consent has not been obtained from all patients.  
Only in the case of a life -threatenin g incident may an investi gational product be used without 
prior signed consent. In such an emergency situation, separate certifications must be written 
both by a physician not participating in the study and by the Investigator. The certifications, along with the protocol and informed consent, must be sent to the IRB or ERC within 
5 working days. In this situation, the Investigator may not administer any subsequent product 
to that patient until informed consent and IRB or ERC approval are obtained.  
Informed Consent 
Written informed consent must be obtained from each patient prior to entry in the study. One 
copy of the signed informed consent document will be given to the patient, and another will be retained by the Investigator. Additionally, the participant must be allowed adequate time to 
consider the potential risks and benefits associated with his/her participation in the study.  
In situations where the participant is not legally competent to provide consent (ie, mentally 
incapacitated), written consent must
 be obtained from a parent, legal guardian, or legal 
representative. In these situations, the consent must be signed and dated by a witness.  
The informed consent document must have been reviewed and approved by the Sponsor or 
the designated CRO and by th e Investigat
or’s IRB or ERC prior to the initiation of the study. 
The document must contain the 8 basic elements of informed consent and may contain the 6 additional elements described in 21 CFR Part 50. Every consent form must include the

16. Appendix D – Calculations
Calculation of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR):  
Use these eGFR calculators to estimate kidney function for adults and children.  
At this time, all laboratories should be using creatinine methods calibrated to be isotope 
dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS
) traceable. In the US and other countries, nearly all 
methods from the major global manufacturers now have calibration traceable to an IDMS 
reference measurement procedure.  Consequently, the calculators for older nonstandardized 
creatinine methods are no longer available on this web site.  
In adults (patients 18 years and older), the recommended equation for  estimating eGFR from 
serum creatinine 
is the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation. The 
IDMS-traceable version of the MDRD Study equation is used. Either equation below may be 
used based on whether  the laboratory reports conventional units or SI units:

17. Appendix E – Algorithm for Liver Safety Laboratory
Abnormality Signals
Reference: 
2009 FDA Guidance for Industry “Drug -Induced Liver Injury – Premarketing Clinica l 
Evaluation”  
Step 1: Confirmation  of Elevated ALT and/or AST:  
Contact t
he Medical Monitor to discuss the case and procedures to follow.  
In general, an increase of serum ALT and/or AST to >3X ULN should be followed by repeat 
testing within 48 to 72 hours of all 4 of 
the usual serum measure s (ALT, AST, ALP, and TB) 
to confirm the abnormalities and to determine if they are increasing or decreasing.  
If symptoms persist or repeat testing shows serum ALT and/or AST >3X ULN for subjects 
with normal baseline measures or 2 -fold increases above base line values for subjects with 
elevated values before drug exposure, it is appropriate to initiate close observation to 
determine whether the abnormalities are improving or worsening (see below). If close monitoring is not possible, the drug should be disco ntinued.
 
Step 2: If Possible Liver Signal identified, Close Observation Required:  
Contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the case and procedures to follow.  
It is critical to initiate close observation immediately upon detection and confirmation of early signals of possible DILI, and not t
o wait until the next scheduled visit or monitoring 
interval. A threshold of aminotransferase levels ≥3X ULN seems reasonable, as lesser elevations are common and nonspecific. If additional testing, beyond that specified in  the trial 
protocol, is carried out, it is important that the subject’s information be added to the case report forms and database.  
Close observation includes: 
•Repeating liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests 2 or 3 times weekly. Frequency of
retesting can decrease to once a week or less 
if abnormalities stabilize or the trial drug has
been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic
•Obtaining a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases
•Obtaining a history of concomitan
t drug use (including nonprescription medi cations and
herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and
special diets
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 112 of 130 

Protoc ol No. LX4211.312 
•Ruling out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic
hepatitis; non -alcoholic stea tohepatitis (NASH); hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and
biliary tract disease
•Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents
•Obtaining additional tests to
 evaluate liver function, as appropriate (eg, International
Normalized Ratio [INR], direct bi
lirubin)
•Considering gastroenterology or hepatology consultations
Step 3: Decision to Stop Study Drug Admini
stration: 
Contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the case and procedures to follow.  
Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if:  
•ALT or AST >8X ULN
•ALT or AST >5X ULN for more than 2
 weeks
•ALT or AST >3X ULN and (TB >2X ULN or 
INR >1.5)
•ALT or AST >3X ULN with the appearance 
of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever
, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%)
Step 4: Evaluate Data for Alternate Causes of Liver Signal:  
Contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the case and procedures to follow.  
An important purpose of close observation is to gather additional clinical information to seek 
other possible causes of the observed li
ver test abnormalities, such as one of the following 
common causes:  
•Acute viral hepatitis. The usual onset of hepatocellular DILI is indistinguishable from
acute viral hepatitis A or B. Hepati
tis C is much less often acute in its onset and t ends to
be insidious, but it sometimes can resemble acute DILI. The presence of acute viral
hepatitis A, B, and C should be evaluated by serological markers. Viral hepatitis D(requires concomitant hepatitis B infection) and E are relatively rare in the Un ited States.
Hepatitis E is more common in developing countries, including Southeast Asia, andshould be considered in recent travelers to those countries and in patients in trialsconducted in those countries. Also rare are hepatocellular liver injuries caused by Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, toxoplasmosis, varicella, and
parvovirus, although these infections are seen more typically in immuno -suppressed
individuals. Adolescent and young adult patients with possible DILI should be tested for
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 113 of 130 

Protoc ol No. LX4211.312 
Epstein-Barr virus. Hepatitis is common among transplant patients with cytomegalovirus 
disease.  
•Alcoholic and autoimmune hepatitis. Acute alcoholic hepatitis usually is recurrent, with a
history of bingeing exposure to alco
hol preceding epis odes, and it has some characteristic
features, such as associated fever, leukocytosis, right upper quadrant pain and tenderness,
hepatomegaly, and AST >ALT, that may help distinguish it from other causes of liverinjury. Other features of the physical exam ination may include the presence of stigmata of
cirrhosis, such as spider nevi, palmar erythema, estrogenic changes in males, and
Dupuytren’s contractures. Alcoholic and autoimmune hepatitis should be assessed by
history, physical examination, and laborato ry testing, including serologic testing (eg,
antinuclear or other antibodies).
•Hepatobiliary disorders. Biliary tract disease, such as migration of gallstones orintrahepatic lesions, more often 
causes cholestatic injury initially and should be
investigat ed with gall bladder and ductal imaging studies, especially if ALP is increased.
Malignant interruption of the biliary tract also should be considered.
•NASH. NASH may be seen in obese, hyperlipoproteinemic, and/or diabetic patients andmay be associated with fluctuating
 aminotransferase levels, and hepatic and sometimes
splenic enlargement. It is sometimes associated with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
•Cardiovascular causes. Cardiovascular disease, especially right heart failure andhypotension or any  cause of impaired o 
xygenation of the liver, may cause acute
centrilobular hypoxic cell necrosis (ischemic hepatitis) with rapid and sometimesspectacular increases of serum aminotransaminase (eg, aminotransaminase >10,000 U/L).
Cardiovascular dysfunction or impaired liver oxygenation, including hypotension or right
heart failure, should be assessed by physical examination and history.
•Concomitant treatments. It is critical to discover concomitant treatments, including
exposure to nonprescription and diet
ary supplement products that might be responsible
for injury. Many people take multiple drugs, perhaps less often in controlled clinical trialsbecause of exclusion criteria, but subjects may not report taking disallowed drugs or otheragents. The possible exposure to occupational chemical agents may not be volunteered
unless subjects are specifically questioned.
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 114 of 130 

Protoc ol No. LX4211.312 
Step 5: Follow -Up to Resolution: 
Contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the case and procedures to follow.  
All trial subjects showing possible  DILI should be followed until all abnormalities return to 
normal or to the baseline state. DILI may develop or progress even after the causative drug 
has been stopped. Results should be recorded on the case report form and in the database. 
Note that longe r follow-up can sometimes reveal an off -drug repetition of what had appeared 
to be DILI, indicating that liver injury was related to underlying liver disease.  
Step 6: Rechallenge:  
Contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the case and procedures to follow.  
Whether or not to rechallenge a subject who showed mild DILI is a difficult decision. Reexposure may initiate a sometimes 
explosive and more severe reaction, as was observed 
with halothane several decades ago. Some cases of DILI show indicators of immunolo gical 
reaction such as eosinophilia, rash, fever, or other symptoms or findings, and it is possible that such cases are more prone to recur with reexposure. Rechallenge may not be considered negative unless the subject is exposed to and tolerates the same dose and treatment duration 
that preceded the original reaction. A negative rechallenge does not necessarily allow a conclusion that the drug did not cause the injury. Most people can adapt to xenobiotic substances, including new drugs, and develop toleran ce for them. This has been observed 
even for drugs that can cause severe injury, such as isoniazid. The large majority of people 
showing hepatocellular injury while taking isoniazid recover fully or recover while 
continuing to take the drug, and some, but not all, can resume or continue taking the drug 
without further adverse consequence. If such tolerance has developed, the use of rechallenge to verify drug causation would give a false negative result.  
Generally, rechallenge of subjects with significant aminotransferase elevations (>5X ULN) should not be attempted. If such subj
ects are rechallenged, they should be followed closely. 
Rechallenge can be considered if the subject has shown important benefit from the drug and other options are not available or if substantial accumulated data with the test drug do not 
show a potential for severe injury. The subject should be made aware of the potential risk, and consent to the rechallenge, and the Institutional Review Board consulted.

18. Appendix F – Recommendations  on Basic Genitourinary
Hygiene, Maintaining Hydration and Recognition of DKA and its
Management
Basic Genitourinary Hygiene:  
Patients with diabetes are at risk for developing genitourinary (GU) infections. The following 
guidelines should be communicated t o
 females and uncircumcised males regarding GU 
infections.  
Patient communication cards will be printed with the following for patients with T1D:  
For females:  
“The following advice may be useful in helping you to keep your bladder and urethra free from infection:  
•Go to the toilet
 as soon as you feel the need to urinate, rather than holding it in.
•Wipe from front to back after g
oing to the toilet.
•Practice good hygiene by washing your
 genitals every day, and before having sex.
•Empty your bladder after having sex.
”
For uncircumcised males:  
“The follo
wing advice may be useful in helping you to keep the foreskin free from infection:  
•Wash the end of your penis and foreskin with soap and water (do not let soap get in the
opening).
•After your shower or 
bath, dry the end of your penis and foreskin properly and replace the
foreskin.
•Also, when you urinate
, slide the foreskin back enough so that urine does not get on the
foreskin-this helps to keep it clean.
”
Maintaining Hydration:  
Sodium-glucose cotransporter  type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are associated with osmotic diuresis 
and volume depletion, which may lead to dizziness or hypotension, especially in the elderly. 
All patients will be advised to maintain proper fluid intake and to consider increasing it if 
they sense greater thirst, more urine production, or if they feel dizzy or faint.  
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 116 of 130 

Protoc ol No. LX4211.312 
Patient communication cards will be printed with the following for patients with T1D:  
“The following advice may be useful in helping you to maintain proper hydration and prevent 
dehydration: 
•Dehydration is when your body loses too much fluid, frequently due to diarrhea or
increased urination. The study drug may cause increased urination.
•If you are thirsty, we recommend drinking water or non -caloric liquids.
•Consider increasi
ng the amount of fluids you drink if:
oYo
u sense greater thirst than usual
oYou have a dry mouth or cracked lips
oYou
 have a fever
oYou have diarrhea or 
vomiting
oYou 
urinate more frequently or 
in larger amounts than usual
oYou get up in the middle of the night t
o urinate (more than usual)
oYou feel
 dizzy or light -headed
oYou exercise, or when it is hot outside”
Recognition of Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) and its Management:  
Patients with T1D are at risk for developing DKA. DKA is always preceded by ketosis. In many cases, ketosis can be treated and resolved with administration of additional rapid acting 
insulin and will therefore not progress to DKA. The following is applicable for all patients with T1D. Investigators and subjects should be aware of the fact that GI adverse events occurring with sotagliflozin may mask presenting symptoms of DKA, and that in some patients, alcohol could be a trigger for ketosis. Therefore, whenever Adverse Event data is collected or the patient reports an intercurrent illness (including infections), generalized 
weakness, increased weight loss, gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain or other symptoms or signs that  the Investigator believes may be consistent 
with DKA, then the Investigator will instruct the patient to measure ketones (urine ketones or  or blood BHB) .  
If ketosis is present (moderate or higher for urine ketones or blood BHB level is >0.6 
mmol/L), then the patient  will be asked to cont
act the Investigative site immediately . In this 
situation, the investigator should consider instructing the patient to take rapid acting insulin by syringe (not insulin pump) as well as eat carbohydrates in order to reverse the ketosis.  After rechecking the ketones, the investigator should consider instructing the patient to take 
16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 117 of 130 

Protoc ol No. LX4211.312 
additional doses of rapid acting insulin every  2 hours until elevated ketones are normalized.  
Because the amount of insulin needed to lower ketones will also lower blood glucose, it is 
necessary for the patient to increase carbohydrate intake. Typically this would be 15 -30 
grams of carbohydrate each hour provided by a glucose containing sports drink or oral 
rehydration fluid.  
The site will evalu ate if an assessment for metabolic acid osis is appropriate. If laboratory 
testing confirms presence of metabolic acidosis, then the “Possible DKA” eCRF will be 
completed. If nausea and vomiting are present and the patient is unable to keep liquids down, the patient should be evaluated in an Emergency Room.  
If a patient is scheduled for a procedure or surgery that requires withholding oral intake (NPO), it is recommended that study
 drug is held from the day prior to procedure or surgery 
and resumed the day after procedure or surgery is complete and patient is tolerating adequate oral intake.    
In some patients alcohol may trigger onset of ketosis.  
Patient communication cards will be printed with the following:  
“The following list may help you to recognize Di abetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). 
•Inabil
ity to maintain oral intake
•Generalized weakness
•Abdominal (bel
ly) pain
•Increased wei
ght loss
•Fever
•Frequ
ent urination, inclu
ding 
at night
•Fruity-scented breath
•Confusion
•Acute i

•Nausea or vomiting
•Having trouble thinki
ng clearly or fee

16 October 2015 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 118 of 130 

Protoc ol No. LX4211.312 
It is possible to have DKA even if your blood glucose is not elevated.  Regardless of your 
blood glucose level, if you have any of these symptoms on the list, then measure your blood 
or urine ketone or blood BHB level. If the urine ketones are high (your study doctor may instruct you that this is a level of “moderate” or more than “moderate”) or blood BHB level is 
above 0.6 mmol/L, then contact your study site immediately for assistance with managing 
your diabetes.”  
In some patients alcohol use may lead to production of ketones by your body.  
If you are scheduled for a procedure or surgery that requires you to not tak e any food or 
liquids, please contac
t your study doctor for instructions on continuing study drug. In such 
cases your study doctor may advise you NOT to take your study drug from the day prior to 
the procedure or surgery until after the procedure or surgery is complete, and you are taking 
food and liquids as you normally do.

19. Appendix G – Measurement of Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate
Equipment  
1.Blood pressure measurements will be taken by an automated blood pressure monitor or a
manual sphygmomanometer.
2.Bladder 
Length – Should nearly or completely encir cle the patient’s arm. For many
adults, the standard “adult” size bladder is not long enough and the “large” size bladder isrecommended.
3.Bladder Width – Should be at least 40% of the bladder 
 length
Patient Fa ctors 
Extraneous variables associated wit
h the measurement of blood pressure (BP) should be 
minimized. These include:  
1.Food intake,
 caffeine-containing beverages, cigarette smok ing, or strenuous exercise
within 2 hours prior to measurement
2.Full urinary bladder
3.The patient should not be allowed to talk while BP is being measured.
4.The patient should be placed in the examination room and the cuff should be placed onthe patient’s nondominant arm. The 
proper sized cuff should fit snugly with the lower
edge 2 to 3 cm above the antecubital fossa.
5.The patient should be allowed to sit quietly in a comfortably warm place (temperature
around 25°C or 77°F) for 5 minutes with 
the arm supported at heart level, preferably with
the cuff in place and with no restrictive clot hing on the arm. The patient should be
encouraged not to tense his or her muscles.
Nondominant Arm  
The patient’s nondominant arm should be the arm declared by the patient as being 
nondominant. The nondominant arm shoul
d then be used for all seated BP measu rements 
throughout the study.  
Measurement Technique  
Following the 5 -minute rest period, 3 separate seated BPs  should be measured with at least 
1 minute between BP measurements and with the cuff fully deflated between measurements. 
All BPs will be recorded in the patient’s electronic case report form (eCRF). The mean of the 3 seated BPs will constitute the BP value for that visit.  
Three seated pulse rate measurements will be obtained. The mean of the 3 seated pulse rate measurements will constitute the 
pulse rate value for that visit.

meal of the day, for the duration
 of the single -blind placebo Run- in Period
(14 days, ±3 days)
c.Remind patients to bring the satiety daily diaries to the next visit (Day1,
Baseline)
24-Week Double- blind Treatment Period (Day 1 to Week 24)  
Following completion of the single -blind, placebo Run- in Period, eligible patients will enter 
the 24-week, double -blind Treatment Period.  
Note: If serum creatinine increases by ≥30% above the baseline value during the study, then 
the Investigator should consider 
assessment of:  volume status, diuretic dose, discontinuing 
NSAIDs, and other relevant testing  including renal imaging techniques, as appropriate.  
Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors are associated with osmotic diuresis and 
volume depletion, which may lead
 to dizziness or hypotension, especially in the elderly. All 
patients will be advised to maintain proper fluid intake and to consider increasing it if they 
sense greater thirst, more urine production, or if they feel dizzy or faint.  
Note: The collection of AEs begins after the first dose of double -blind study drug. 
24-Week Double- blind Treatment Clinic Visit (Day 1)  
When scheduling the visit, remind patients that they should fast and drink only water or noncaffeinated, zero -calorie beverages for at least 8 hours prior to the visit.
 If the patient is 
unable to fast as above, the scheduled “fasting” laboratory samples will still be collected, and the 
non-fasting status will be noted in the eCRF.  
Patients should also be reminded that they are NOT to take study drug on the day of clinic 
visits until instructed by site staff
.  
Perform the following examinations and assessments and complete the appropriate eCRFs:  
1.Access inclusion/exclusion criteria
2.Randomization
3.Perform symptom -related brief physical examination
4.M

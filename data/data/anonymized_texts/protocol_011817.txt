 1.0   Objectives / Specific Aims :  
Sinusonic  is a simple handheld device that uses acoustic vibrations (128Hz) and positive 
expiratory pressure as patients exhale through their nose. Beneficial effects have been 
shown in a clinical trial studying chronic rhinitis that showed improvements in nasal 
blockage/congestion, nasal drainage, nasal/sinus pressure and sense of smell ( Soler ZM 
etal available at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alr.22537 ). A small 
unpublished pilot study demonstrated >70% increases in peak nasal  nitric oxide ( NO) 
after one use of Sinusonic.  NO is known to stimulate mucociliary clearance and has 
antiviral properties. Given that Sinusonic improves nasal congestion, nasal drainage and appears to increase NO which has antiviral properties, our hypothesis is that use of Sinusonic will decrease the frequency, severity and duration of community acquired viral URIs .  
Aim 1: To determine if Sinusonic decreases the number  of URIs 
experienced during an 8 week fall URI season. Subjects will use an active 
device (positive expiratory pressure and 128 Hz) or a sham device (no 
positive expiratory pressure and 1,000 Hz ) for 1 min three times a day  for 8 
weeks. Daily URI symptoms  will be recorded electronically.  
Aim 2: To determine if Sinusonic  decreases the severity and duration of 
community acquired viral URIs. Subjects will use active or sham device as above. Severity and duration of URIs will be recorded using daily symptom diaries.

 2.0 Background  
 
Sinusonic is a simple 
handheld device t hat uses 
acoustic vibrations 
(128Hz) and positive 
expiratory pressure as 
patients exhale through 
their nose. Beneficial  
effects have been  shown 
in a clinical trial that 
showed improvements in nasal blockage/congestion, nasal drainage, nasal/ sinus pressure and 
sense of smell (
Soler 
ZM, etal ). Some of these benefits occurred after one use of the device and these benefits 
continued to increase throughout the 5 week study.  In this clinical trial, approximately 80% of 
patients demons trated improvement . A small unpublished pilot study demonstrated >70% 
increases in peak nasal NO after one use of Sinusonic.  Our hypothesis is that use of Sinusonic improves nasal congestion, mucociliary clearance and exhaled NO, all of  which decrease vir al 
infections.  3.0 Intervention to be studied 
 Subjects will be screened for likely inclusion during the summer months. Baseline 
demographics, medical comorbidities, and URI  symptoms will be assessed . Informed consent 
will be completed.  
 The fall URI season typically runs through September and October  (Turner R etal). Towards the 
end of screening , all s ubjects will be randomized 2:1 to active use of Sinusonic (128Hz) for 1 
minute 3 times daily or an identical “placebo” device that emits a frequency of 1,000 Hz and has the ball valve modified to eliminate positive expiratory pressure. Devices will be shipped to home addresses via overnight mail. On September 1, 2020 all subjects will begin daily use of their assigned device.  Subjects will remain blinded as to treatment arm until study completion.  
Subjects will be asked to complete a brief daily questionnaire on URI  symptoms  and 
whether or not they feel as if they have a “cold” . Previously validated questions for viral 
URI studies are rating 8 items on a l ikert scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe 
symptoms) (Jackson GG, etal ). The 8 symptoms are : sneezing, runny nose, nasal 
obstruction, sore throat, cough, headache , malaise,  and chilliness . A Total Symptom 
Score (TSS) will be the sum of each symptom to provide a daily score ranging from 0 to 24. Prior studies have defined the common cold as present when:  
1) TSS >  14 PLUS moderate or severe nasal discharge x 3 days OR patient 
subjective impression they have a cold OR  0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%

Answers will be uploaded to secure REDCAP database. The study duration is 8 weeks. At the end  of the study, subjects will be asked questions regarding device safety and 
tolerability.  
Our primary  outcome will be absolute number of URIs experienced during the 8 week 
study period. Secondary outcomes will be time to first URI, duration and symptom severity of viral URIs. These metrics will allow us to determine if Sinusonic decreases the frequency of  URIs, as well as potentially shortening the duration or decreasing the 
severity of URIs.  
3.1 Device Instructions  
 
Instructions for use:  
1. Hold the SinuSonic  device at a 45 -degree angle  
2. Deep breathe in through mouth  
3. Hold the SinuSonic  to your nose and blow  out into the 
mask of the SinuSonic . The goal here is to hear the 
“target flutter” sound that is desired during treatment 
with the SinuSonic  
4. You will feel a little resistance to breathe out and a 
vibration sensation from a speaker in the device  
5. Remove the device to “blow the nose” if nasal drainage occurs  
6. Return the device to the nose then breathe in and out thru the nose to try and hear the “target flutter” sound  
7. Time of use is 1 minute of nasal breathing with the device -  as tolerated  
8. Goal is to use Sinusonic 3 times per day with uses separated by at least 5 minutes. 
3.2 Device Usage and Safety  
 
The SinuSonic consists of a fully -disposable medical grade silicone nosepiece mounted to a resin 
body. The device is equipped with a flutter valve located at the top of the device which creates gentle, self -guided oscillating expiratory resistance.  
 The SinuSonic is a  legally marketed device used in accordance with its labeling .  It is 
substantially equivalent to many Class I OTC devices with the same intended use and indications for use in clearing mucus to improve air flow, such as the Navage Nose Cleaner.  
  4.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria/Study Population  
Inclusion Criteria  
• Adults  18 years  or older  with no transient  sym ptoms  of any URI or allergies  at baseline.  
Exclusion Criteria  

  Version 1.0; Version 7/20/20 
 
Page 5 of 15  
 Any transient  ENT  condition that  may  impact  upper  airway  to include  acute sinusitis  or 
otitis . 
 Any upper  respiratory  illness  within  last 2 weeks  
TSS will be  measured  at baseline as  described  above  and must  be <9 for inclus ion 
(Eccles  etal). 
Topical  decongestant  use in last week  
Current  nasal  crusting  or history  of ulceration  or perforation   
History  of severe nose  bleeding  within  last 3 months  
Known pregnancy  
Immunosuppressed condition or  on immune  modulating  medications  such  as prednisone  
or chemotherapy  
Allergic  sensitivity  to silicone  or any other  component  of device  
Inability  to read  and understand English  
Inability  to perform  treatment due  to underlying  medical  condition 
 
After confirming that subjects meet inclusion criteria, they will be entered into study as 
outlined below .  Subjects who have URI symptoms at the beginning of the study will 
specifically be excluded, as the purpose of the study is prevention of URIs, not t reatment 
of pre -existing URIs.  
4.1 COVID19 
The purpose of the study is to see if Sinusonic prevents community acquired viral URIs, 
not to treat existing infections. So patients must be asymptomatic at the beginning of 
study. As this study is not conducted exclusively on MUSC patients and is being done virtually (to minimize exposure and increase safety during the covid pandemic), we do not have the ability to perform widespread covid testing on hundreds of asymptomatic patients. So it is possible that someo ne will have undiagnosed covid.  
 
5.0 Number of Subjects  
 Prior research reports (Turner etal ) using identical outcome measures and studying community 
acquired URIs in the fall season report that approximately 60% of subjects suffered from a viral URI (range 48% to 75% in each arm). We are planning to include 300 subjects (200 active device, 100 s ham device). If we conservatively assume that only 50% of sham device subjects 
get an URI, we will be powered to detect a decrease to 33%.   6.0 Setting  
Research will be conducted at geographical locations in the Southeast (SC, NC, GA, VA)  
that have simila r fall viral URI seasons .  Potential participant screening for all subjects 
across all aims, as well as informed consent and baseline evaluations, will occur remotely to avoid any risk to research personnel .  All baseline and  follow -up measures will be 
collected remotely using REDCap  at 4 and 8 weeks .   
7.0 Recruitment Methods  
  Version 1.0; Version 7/20/20 
 
Page 6 of 15  
 We will publicize the study through MUSC and Sinusonic  social media  targeting  
geographic regions described above. A number and email will be provided for subjects 
interested in partic ipating.  Only one subject per household can be enrolled.  
8.0 Consent Process  
Patients  who respond to social media recruitment  will be contacted by study personnel to 
determine eligibility. As the goal is to recruit subjects from throughout the southeast, no 
in person visits will be conducted at MUSC and it will be necessary to obtain remote 
informed consent.  
The remote consent process will include an informed consent discussion with the 
potential participant and involve the participant signing and returning the informed 
consent document to the researcher.  The informed consent discussion will occur over the 
phone. The documentation of consent process will include sending the informed consent  
document to the subject for signature and transmitting it back to the research team to be 
signed by the researcher before any research procedures begin. The document  will be sent 
using the electronic consent option in REDCap .  
A member of the study team w ill describe  in full detail the study and the informed 
consent form to the potential subject.  The study team member will explain: 
1. What would be different if the patient participated in the  study versus receiving 
standard of care treatment.  
2. The study  is voluntary participation, patient may withdraw any time, and PI 
may take patient  off study at any time.  
3. The reason for doing the study  
4. How many people will be in the study  
5. Who is eligible to participate in the study  
6. Details regarding the stu dy device.  
7. What medical assessments/questionnaires  they will have  and how often  
8. Risks involved in participating in a study  
 9. What information will be gathered  
The prospective participant will be given adequate time to review the informed consent form and ask any questions that they have before the consent is obtained.  Participants will electronically be sent  a signed  copy of the ICF.  
9.0  Study Design / Methods  
This study is designed as a pilot study.  
Data will be collected by the study investigators  as well as the subjects themselves 
throughout the entirety of the study.  The data will consist of answers from subjects for 
questionnaires asked by the clinicians as well as self -reported answers from the subjects.

10.0 Data Management  
All analyses and graphs will be performed with SPSS 24.0, Sample Power 3.0, and Sigma Plot 10.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL.).  Disease information and demographic variables, such as age, gender, race, and VAS scores will be summarized using frequencies, means, and standard deviation as appropriate.  Our primary outcome metric is number of viral URIs as defined above . Secondary outcome metrics include average duration  of URIs and 
severity of symptoms (as measured by TS S) of URIs . Categorical variables will be 
compared using Chi Square or McNemar’s test.  Continuous variables will be compared using One -Way ANOVA with repeated measures follow by post -hoc analysis.  Data 
regarding safety and patient satisfaction will be su mmarized for each time point.  A p -
value ≤0.05 will be considered statistically significant.  Due to the exploratory nature of this study, no p -value correction (ie Bonferroni) will be applied.   
11.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
Safety will be monitored throughout the study based on the monitoring of adverse events, via electronic data collection . The period of observation for collection of non- serious 
adverse events extends from the time the subject gives informed conse nt until the 
completion of the End- of-Study visit or Early Termination Visit.  Serious adverse events 
(SAE) will be reported  to the MUSC IRB and to the sponsor  from the time of informed 
consent through 30 days after the last use of the SinuSonic.  Adverse event data listings will be reviewed by  Principal Investigator and the research team at regular intervals 
throughout the study.   
Safety data listings will be reviewed by Principal Investigator, Co -Investigators, and the research 
team at regular intervals throughout the study.   
Safety will be monitored throughout the study based on monitoring of adverse events, and 
through collection of symptoms electronically.  Collection of symptoms will occur via the Daily 
URI Symptoms Score questionnaires that are electronically sent to the consented patients.  
  Version 1.0; Version 7/20/20 
 
Page 8 of 15  
 The period of observation for collection of non -serious adverse events extends from the  time the 
subject gives informed consent until completion of the End- of-study visit or Early Termination 
Visit. Serious adverse events (SAE) will be reported to the IRB and to the sponsor from the time 
of informed consent through 30 days after the last use  of the SinuSonic. Adverse event data 
listings will be reviewed by the principal investigator, co -investigators, and the research team at 
regular i ntervals throughout the study.  
All AEs, regardless of seriousness or relationship to SinuSonic use, spanning from the signature 
of the informed consent form until the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient, are to be reported to the Healthy Humming, LLC. All AEs which follow the IRB qualifications will also be reported to the IRB within 24 hours of site knowledge of the event.  
The Investigator will take appropriate measures to follow all AEs until clinical recovery is 
complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, 
or until death, in order t o ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will 
continue beyond the last timepoint per protocol, and that additional investigations may be 
requested by the monitoring team up to as noticed by Healthy Humming, LLC.  
In the case of occurrence of an SAE, the Investigator will immediately (within 24 hours) report 
the event to Healthy Humming, LLC and to the IRB, as applicable.  
12. Withdrawal  
At any point during the study, a subject may withdraw from the study.  The subject may 
refuse t o take part in or stop taking part in this study at any time. The subject will be 
instructed to call the investigator in charge of this study if they  decide to do this. Their  
decision not to take part in the study will not affect their  current or future me dical care or 
any benefits to which they  are entitled.  If they  wish to withdraw, they will be provided 
contact details for the study team to initiate their withdrawal.  
Early termination from the study is also subject to the PI’s discretion.  Subject will no longer be in the study and data will no longer be collected.  The reasons for this withdrawal could be due to study non- compliance or if the subject  no longer meet s 
eligibility requirements.  A member of the study team will notify the study participant  if 
they will no longer be participating in the study.  
13.0 Risks to Subjects  
There are risks to subjects using the SinuSonic device.  Subjects may experience a degree of discomfort, nosebleeds or crusting  due to use of the device.  Prior studies have 
reported: Mild discomfort in 2.5- 5% of patients; Bleeding in 0% of patients; Crusting in 
0% of patients  (Soler ZM etal) .  
There is a risk of a loss of confidentiality of your personal information as a result of participation in this study.  
 
14.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects or Others  
  Version 1.0; Version 7/20/20 
 
Page 9 of 15  
  
This study is for research purposes only.  Participants may benefit from decreased infection s 
with potentially milder symptoms  or shorter duration, but we do not know if this will occur .  
Information learned from the study may help other people in the future.   
15.0 Sharing of Results with Subjects  
Information about the subjects (including identifiable private information) may have all of their identifiers removed and used for future research studies .   
Records of the subjec ts’ participation in this study will be held confidential except as 
disclosure is required by law or as described in the ICF.  
16.0 Payment  
For participating in this study, participants will be given a free device, but no payment 
will be given .   
17.0 Devices  
Dispensing and storage of S inuSonic devices will be done by  the study sponsor .   
18.0  Data safety monitoring and reporting 
Patients will initially be screened over the phone and informed consent obtained. This 
will occur during the summer months so we have a group of 300 subjects who pass this 
initial screen. Towards the end of the screening period, we will re -contact patients to 
confirm their interest in participation. As described above, we will also ask symptom scores to ensure TSS<9 and patient does not have an active URI at the start of the study.  
If patients still wish to participate and still meet inclusion criteria, they will be randomized and devices shipped out within a week. 
Safety will be monitored throughout the study based upon self reporting of symptoms. 
Subjects will be advised to seek medical care if at any time their symptoms become severe.  Review of the daily reports will occur weekly to ensure the condition of each 
patient is adequately monitored for possible signs of URI or COV ID19.  
The period of observation for collection of non -serious adverse events extends from the 
time the subject gives informed consent until completion of the End- of-study visit or 
Early Termination Visit. Serious adverse events (SAE) will be reported from the time of informed consent through 30 days after the last use of the SinuSonic. Adverse event data listings will be reviewed at regular intervals throughout the study.  In addition, investigators will be alerted of Adverse Events of interest via automate d emails 
programmed in the EDC system. Patient compliance will be assessed via weekly phone 
calls from study coordinator.

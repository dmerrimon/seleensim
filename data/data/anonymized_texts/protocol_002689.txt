 1. PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Parallel Group, Double -Blind, Randomized, Placebo -
Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 
Eptinezumab Administered Intravenously in Subjects Experiencing an Acute Attack of Migraine  
Sponsor  Lundbeck Seattle Bio Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Study Phase  Phase 3B  
Study Drug, Dose and 
Schedule A single administration of eptinezumab, a humanized anti -
calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibody, 100 mg or placebo provided by intravenous infusion. 
Primary Objective  To evaluate the effect of eptinezumab compared to placebo with 
respect to time to headache pain freedom AND time to absence of most bothersome symptom during an intercurrent migraine that occurs in subjects who are candidates for preventive therapy.  
 
 
Secondary Objectives  To evaluate the efficacy of eptinezumab vs. placebo on:  
• Headache pain freedom at timepoints up to 48 hours 
• Absence of most bothersome symptom at timepoints up to 
48 hours 
• Time to headache pain relief  
• Sustained headache pain freedom from 2 – 48 hours 
• Acute rescue medication use 
• Effect on symptoms of the qualifying migraine  
• Effect on patient -reported outcomes 
Methodology  This will be a parallel group, double -blind, randomized, placebo -
controlled study assessing the efficacy of eptinezumab for acute 
migraine, as defined as an active intercurrent migraine occurring in those patients who are candidates for preventive therapy. Subjects will be randomized to receive either 100 mg eptinezumab or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified by concomitant migraine preventive treatment and region. The total study duration will be approximately 4 to 12 weeks, including up to 8- week screening period, with clinic visits 
occurring on Screening, Day 0 (dosing day), and Week 4. Weekly site/subject co ntact attempts via a mobile application or 
phone call will occur between screening and Day 0. The number of weekly contacts will be based on the length of time from the Screening visit to Day 0. Randomization and dosing will be triggered by a qualifying migraine and will occur on Day 0. 
Study design requires that study drug administration be initiated

 within 1 to 6 hours of migraine onset, and subjects must be 
willing and able to travel to the site for study drug administration 
within this time frame. Subjects must remain at the site for 4-hours post start-of-infusion for observation. Subjects may be followed longer than 4 weeks, if necessary, for safety follow-up as described in the protocol. An eDiary will be assigned prior to dosing at the Day 0 visit and dosed subjects must complete the eDiary at the prescribed intervals through 48 hours after start of infusion (t=0). Additionally, subjects will complete eDiary data entry from Day 3 until a new migraine is reported.  
 
Number of Subjects 
Planned  Approximat ely 450 subjects will be randomized and dosed at up 
to 100 sites. 
Subject Selection Criteria  Male or female subjects between 18 and 75 years of age, 
inclusive, who were diagnosed with migraine at < 50 years of age, have a history of migraine for > 1 year before screening and 
a frequency of 4 – 15 migraine days per month in the 3 months prior to screening. By history, the subject’s typical migraine attack, if untreated, would be associated with headache pain of moderate to severe intensity and a most bothersome symptom of nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia.  Subjects must be headache free for at least 24 hours prior to onset of a qualifying migraine.  
Duration of Treatment  This is a single -dose study with a 4 -week follow -up period.  
Duration of Clinical Study 
Participation  4 – 12 weeks  
Clinical Study Endpoints  • Co-Primary Endpoints:

 Sample Size  The planned sample size for this study is 450 randomized and 
dosed subjects. These subjects will be allocated into 2 treatment 
groups, eptinezumab vs. placebo, in a 1:1 ratio.  
 Two hundred twenty-five subjects per group provides at least 90% power to detect a 0.736 hazard ratio favoring eptinezumab at the 5% significance level for both co-primary endpoints. In addition, this sample size also provides 90% power for the key secondary endpoints, assuming that each at 5% significance level eptinezumab increases response rates for both 2-hour endpoints by at least 14.5 percentage points and that the correlation between these two endpoints is 0.8. 
 
Statistical Analysis  For each of the co -primary time -to-event endpoints, the 
difference between groups with respect  to time to pain freedom 
or time to absence of MBS will be tested using a Cox proportional hazards model at the 5% significance level. For each of the key secondary 2-hour endpoints, the treatment groups will be compared using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel tes t (CMH), 
adjusting for the study’s stratification factor. The key secondary 
endpoints will be tested hierarchically at a 5% significance level (pain freedom at 2 hours, followed by absence of most bothersome symptom at 2 hours). For each of the secondary endpoints, the treatment groups will be compared the same way as for the key secondary endpoints. If both key secondary endpoints achieve statistical significance, the secondary endpoints will be tested hierarchically at 5% level of significance (pain freed om at 4 hours, followed by absence of most 
bothersome symptom at 4 hours, followed by use of rescue medication within 24 hours).

5.1. Background  
Migraine is a highly prevalent paroxysmal neurological disease characterized by recurrent 
episodes of moderate to severe headache associated with physiological disruptions of 
neurological, gastrointestinal, and sensory function.  Attacks of migr aine typically last between 
4 and 72 hours, produce significant disability, and recur often without warning, over decades of 
time.  Migraine is more common in women and most prevalent through the 3rd and 4th decades 
of life, amplifying its impact on family  and career development ( Lipton, 2007). Migraine is one 
of the most prevalent neurological disease for which medical treatment is sought, and worldwide, 
is considered the leading cause of disability for people under the age of 50 and 2nd leading cause 
of disability worldwide ( Leonardi, 2005). Annually, lost work time and diminished productivity 
attributable to migraine costs American  employers an estimated $19.6 billion ( Stewart, 2003).  
Generally, migraine begins as an episodic disease.  Between attacks of migraine, the nervous system returns to a normal (premorbid) state of function.  However, approximately 2.5% of 
people with episodic migraine will annually transform from episodic to chronic migraine, meaning they are experiencing migraine on greater than 15 days per month for at least 
3 consecutive months ( Headache Classification Committee, 2018 ). For those with chronic 
migraine, the headaches are more intense; associated with more migraine-associated symptoms, 
and there is greater disease- related impact and d isability and in general there is a failure to return 
to normal (pre-morbid) neurological function between episodes of headache ( Katsarava, 2012).  
The pathophysiology of migraine is complex and incompletely understood.  Current models of migraine are based on a genetically determined hyper -excitable nervous system characterized by 
a lowered threshold to sensory activation and uniqueness in sensory processing ( Durham, 2004). 
Interactions between the migraine nervous system and specific internal and external stimuli (migraine triggers) can result in activation of the trigeminovascular system (TVS).  Once 
activated, the TVS releases various vasoactive peptides generating peripheral sensitization of 
trigeminal and upper cervical nociceptors. The ensuing peripheral nociceptive stimuli synapsing in the Trigeminal Nucleus Caudalis ultimately lead to a state of central sensitization as third 
order neurons in the thalamus become sensitized ( Cady, 2012). Clinically, during a fully 
developed attack of migraine, central sensitization can be observed as sensory allodynia.   
Central to this model of migraine pathophysiology is calcitonin gene- related peptide (CGRP).  
CGRP is one of the most abundant peptides in the human body and is produced in both 
peripheral and central neurons.  It is abundantly stored in trigeminal afferents and when released during migraine leads to vasodilation, the release of inflammatory peptides, and increased 
sensory transmission.  In both peripheral and central pain pathways, CGRP is associated with 
pain transmission and neuronal sensitization ( Durham, 2006). Intravenous (IV) infusions of 
CGRP can cause a migraine- like headache in susceptible individuals with migraine ( Hansen, 
2010). In addition, ma ny pharmacological agents used as acute or prophylactic treatment of 
migraine are known to inhibit CGRP.  Thus, CGRP is an attractive target for development of novel migraine pharmacology.  
The pharmacological treatment of migraine can be divided into two c ategories: one is to reverse 
or abort an attack of migraine after it is initiated and the second class is to protect the nervous

Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 65 system from generating future migraines.  Preventive treatments generally do not abort a 
migraine that has already began.   
Intercurrent migraine is defined as an active migraine that occurs in a patient population that are 
candidates for preventive therapy. While intercurrent migraine is not explicitly defined by the 
IHS, medications for active migraine such as triptans have been previously been studied 
(MacGregor, 2009 ).   While generally quite effective, excessive use of acute treatments for 
active migraine can actually worsen the severity and frequency of migraine causing a secondary 
headache condition called medication overuse headache (MOH) ( Headache Classification 
Committee, 2018). MOH is common in populations with chronic migraine ( Schmid, 2013). 
Thus, it is critical to initiate preventive treatment before medication overuse is established.   
5.2. Eptinezumab Background Information  
A significant unmet treatment need for subjects with migraine is for an effective treatment that 
can abort an existing migraine and at the same time prevent future migraine from occurring.  Eptinezumab is currently being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an 
indication in migraine prevention.  Unique to its profile is that it is administered as an 
intravenous infusion and throughout its Phase 2 and Phase 3 development programs, it has consistently demonstrated preventive efficacy as soon as the first day following infusion.  This 
raises the possibility that eptinezumab has the potential to be a treatment intervention for active 
migraine and at the same time, provide a sustained preventive benefit. In a key secondary endpoint for the perce ntage of patients with a migraine after dosing, there was a statistically 
significant reduction in Day 1 migraine frequency for both the 100 and 300 mg groups relative to placebo in ALD403- CLIN -011; in ALD403- CLIN -006, the results were not significant afte r 
multiplicity adjustments.  
Eptinezumab is a genetically engineered humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody that binds to human-α-CGRP with an affinity of 1.5E-11 M and human-β-CGRP with an affinity of 5.7E-11 M. Eptinezumab is being developed by Lundbeck Seattle Bio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
(Lundbeck Seattle) for the prevention of migraine.  However, as an intravenous infusion (IV) with 100% bioavailability, a T -max of 30 minutes, rapid engagement and high affinity for 
CGRP, eptinezumab  may also be suitab le as a treatment for active migraine.  
5.2.1. Summary of Clinical Studies  
Detailed descriptions of the relevant clinical findings for e ptinezumab are provided in the 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
A summary of the migraine studies completed and ongoing eptinezumab clinical studies is shown in Table 3.

5.2.2. Dose Justification 
Since the objective of this study is to assess treatment of active migraine in patients who require 
preventive therapy, 100 mg is deemed to be the lowest effective dose. This is based on the ALD403- CLIN -006 and ALD403- CLIN -011 studies in prevention, where 100 mg dose group 
provided benefit as early as Day 1 and conferred efficacy out to Week 12.   
5.3. Risks and Benefits  
Eptinezumab may be effective as a treatment for active migraine as well as providing preventive benefit for 12 weeks.    
There may be unknown adverse effects and unforeseeable risks associated with study drug 
administration or unexpected interactions with another drug that have not yet been identified.  
As with all protein therapeutics, there is a risk of both non- serious and serious allergic reactions.

Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 65 In the completed eptinezumab clinical studies, the most common adverse reaction in ≥ 2% of 
treated patients and ≥ 2% of placebo patients was nasopharyngitis.  The majority of these adverse 
events were categorized as mild to moderate.  
The safety of eptinezumab has been evaluated in 2,076 patients with migraine who received at 
least one dose of eptinezumab, representing 1615 patient-years of exposure. Long term data with 
eptinezumab is limited; however, 128 subjects have been treated with up to 2 years of exposure.  
• Healthy volunteer studies have included limited dosing, with follow- up limited to 
3-4 months post last dose.  
• Studies in migraine subjects have also included up to 20 weeks of follow- up for 
Safety. No new significant adverse safety findings were noted during the follow-up period. 
• An open label long term follow-up safety study included no new significant findings 
identified during the long- term follow -up period. 
The safety findings to date indicate that eptinezumab  is well tolerated and demonstrates a 
favorable risk-benefit profile based on review of nonclinical, clinical, and scientific literature 
data.  
5.4. Compliance Statement  
This clinical study will be conducted in accordance with standards of Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and all applicable federal and local regulations.

7.2. Clinical Study Design  
This will be a parallel group, double-blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study assessing the 
efficacy of eptinezumab for acute migraine. Acute migraine for this study will be defined as an 
active intercurrent migraine occurring in those patients who are candidates for preventive therapy. Subjects will be rand omized to receive either 100 mg eptinezumab or placebo in a 
1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified by concomitant migraine preventive treatment and region.  
The total study duration will be approximately 4 to 12 weeks, including up to 8- week screening  
period, with clinic visits occurring on Screening, Day 0 (dosing day), and Week 4. Weekly 
site/subject contact attempts via a mobile application or phone call will occur between screening and Day 0. The number of weekly contacts will be based on the length of time from the 
Screening visit to Day 0. Randomization and dosing will be triggered by a qualifying migraine 
and will occur on Day 0. Study design requires that study drug administration be initiated within 1 to 6 hours of migraine onset, and subjects must be willing and able to travel to the site for 
study drug administration within this time frame. Subjects must remain at the site for 4 -hours 
post start-of-infusion for observation. Subjects may be followed longer than 4 weeks, if 
necessary, for safety  follow-up as described in the protocol. An eDiary will be assigned prior to 
dosing at the Day 0 visit and dosed subjects must complete the eDiary at the prescribed intervals through 48 hours after start of infusion (t=0). Additionally, subjects will compl ete eDiary data 
entry from Day 3 until a new migraine is reported.  
Approximately 450 subjects will be randomized and treated. Efficacy and safety assessments will be conducted according to the Schedule of Events and Assessments presented in Section  2.    
7.3. Methods to Minimize/Avoid Bias  
To minimize bias, this clinical study is randomized, double-blinded, and placebo controlled.

Each participating investigative site will be assigned a 3 -digit site number (e.g., 601, 602). At the 
screening visit, once the subject signs the ICF they are registered in the electronic data capture (EDC), which will assign a unique subject number. The first three digits of the subject number identify the site, and the remaining four digits identify the subject. 
Subjects who fail screening may be rescreened if approved in advance by the medical monitor.   
8.3.2. Randomization and Treatment Assignment 
Randomization and dosing must occur at the dosing visit (Day 0) as specified in the schedule of 
events and once the eligibility assessments are approved by the medical monitor.  
Sites will complete randomization in EDC, and the randomization assignment will be obtained 
by the clinical study site’s unblinded pharmacist or designee in an interactive web/voice randomization system (IxRS).  Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the treatment 
groups.  Randomization will be stratified by concomitant migraine preventive treatment 
(concomitant migraine preventive treatment use vs. no concomitant migraine preventive treatment use) and region (North America vs. Rest of World).

9.1. Eptinezumab  
Eptinezumab is an anti- calcitonin gene-related peptide humanized monoclonal antibody (anti-
CGRP mAb) that is being developed by Lundbeck Seattle BioP harmaceuti cals, Inc., for the 
preventive treatment of migraine. As an intravenous infusion (IV) with 100% bioavailability, a 
Tmax of 30 minutes, rapid engagement and high affinity for CGRP, Lundbeck Seattle believes it 
may be suited for treatment of an active [intercurrent] migraine.  
Eptinezumab injection, 100 mg/mL (1 mL per vial), is presented in USP/Ph Eur. Type 1 glass vials as a single -use preservative-free solution for IV administration.  Eptinezumab is formulated 
at a concentration of 100 mg/mL with a pH of 5.8.  Those subjects randomized to the 
eptinezumab treatment group will receive an IV infusion of eptinezumab injection in 100 mL of 
0.9% saline.   
9.2. Placebo  
Placebo will be supplied as a single- use preservative-free solution in a 2- mL Type I glass vial 
formul ated with the same excipients as eptinezumab, without the active ingredient. Those 
subjects randomized to placebo will receive an IV infusion of placebo in 100 mL of 0.9% saline. 
9.3. Study Drug Dosing and Administration  
The pharmacist or designee is responsible for receiving, storing and preparing study drug and placebo, as well as transferring study drug or placebo to the blinded staff for administration.  
Unblinded staff will not be responsible for other aspects of the clinical study where blinding is 
necessa ry. Both randomization and dosing must occur on Day 0. Doses of eptinezumab or 
placebo (total volume of 100 mL) will be administered intravenously over a period of 30 (+15) minutes on Day 0 by the blinded investigator or designee.  
The study drug administr ation must be initiated within 1 to 6 hours of onset of the qualifying 
migraine. Subjects must remain at the site and be monitored by site staff for at least 4 hours post-
dose.  The investigator must be immediately available during the infusion and for at least 4 hours 
post start of infusion to assess each subject for the occurrence of adverse events.  Subjects will be requested to stay longer than 4 hours after dosing should the investigator determine this is 
clinically warranted (e.g., subjects should be observed until all AEs are resolved or clinically 
stable).  The timeframe for the post -dose observation period must be documented in the source 
record.  
Further instructions on preparation and procedures associated with administering the IV can be found in the Pharmacy Manual and Infusion Guidelines. 
9.3.1. Packaging and Labeling 
Before the shipment to the sites, study drug will be labeled with information (protocol number, 
contents, concentration, storage instructions and any other information), required by regula tory 
agencies and a statement that it is limited to investigational use. Study drug to be administered to 
the subject will be labeled after dose preparation by the unblinded pharmacist or designee as specified in the Pharmacy Manual in a manner that protects the blind.

Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 65 9.3.2. Blinding  
This clinical study is double -blinded, meaning the subjects, investigator and site personnel are 
blinded to treatment assignment, except for the site’s unblinded pharmacist or designee. The site 
must have a written plan in place, site blinding plan, to ensure blinding is adequately maintained for the study.  If the blind is broken, the date, time, and reason must be recorded in the source. 
The blind should only be broken for reasons in which knowledge of the treatment assignment is 
critical to the management of subject safety. Medical monitor approval should be obtained prior 
to breaking the blind if possible. The principal investigator will report any cases of unblinding to 
the Sponsor within 24 hours of the incident. Please refer to the site blinding plan and the infusion 
guidelines for additional details regarding breaking the study blind.  
9.3.3. Storage and Handling of Study Drug  
Eptinezumab will be stored at the site at 2
°C to 8°C in accordance with any accompanying 
instructions.  
Placebo will be stored at the site at -20°C (-10°C to -25°C) in accordance with any accompanying 
instructions.   Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional storage and handling procedures.  Diluent 
(0.9% saline) will be stored according to manufacturer instructions. 
Investigators shall take adequate precautions, including storage of eptinezumab and placebo in a 
securely locked, substantially constructed cabinet or other securely locked, substantially 
constructed enclosure, access to which is limited to maintain blind, prevent theft or diversion of 
the substance into illegal channels of distribution. 
9.3.4. Accountability and Disposition of Investigational Product 
The investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate study drug accountability records 
throughout the clinical study. The site must maintain a Study Drug Accountability Log, on which the unblinded pharmacist or designee will record the receipt, lot number, quantity and 
dispensation of study drug. Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional details regarding 
study drug accountability.  
Where more than one secure area is being used for storage at a site, all movement of study drug 
through the chain of custody must be recorded in accountability records such that full 
reconciliation may be completed at the end of the study.  
Included with each study drug shipment is a form listing lot numbers and quantity shipped. The 
unblinded pharmacist or designee will acknowledge receipt and integrity of these supplies.  A 
copy will be retained in the site's pharmacy binder during study conduct. 
9.3.5. Disposition of Study Drug  
After completion of the clinical study, the investigator is responsible for either returning or 
destroying all unused study drug. The investigator must verify that no remaining supplies are in 
his/her possession. All used/partially used vials/IV bags will be destroyed onsite according to the site SOPs or returned according to Lundbeck Seattle directive. Destruction must be in accordance with local regulations for the product type.

designee shall return the unused supplies to the sponsor or designee, or otherwise provide for 
disposition of the unused supplies (as authorized by the sponsor).  
9.4. Concomitant Medications  
Any concomitant therapy used from the time the subject signs the informed consent form 
through study completion must be recorded on the CRF, including medications required for 
treatment of any AEs or SAEs. The medication name, dosage, date, and indication for use must be recorded. The medical monitor or designee should be notified in advance of (or as soon as 
possible after) any instances in which restricted therapies are administered.  
9.4.1. Prohibited Medications/Treatments  
Anti-CGRP treatments are prohibited for the duration of the study. 
9.4.2. Restricted Medications/Treatments  
Medications which are not prohibited specifically are allowed during the study.  
The following medicati ons must be avoided for 2 hours after start of study drug 
administration: 
• Triptans, ergotamines and ergot- derivatives  
• Analgesics (including but not limited to acetaminophen, tramadol, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], combination analgesics, caffeine -containing 
analgesics and opioids/narcotics) and other acute migraine medication(s)  
• Antiemetic medications (including but not limited to prochlorperazine, promethazine, droperidol, chlorpromazine, metoclopramide) 
• Antihistamines (except if required to treat allergic reactions)  
• Any form of magnesium  or cannabis-based products  
• Devices, neuromodulation, neurostimulation, or injectable therapy (trigger point injections, extracranial nerve blocks, facet joint injections, spinal manipulation)  
Botulinum toxin for migraine or any other medical/cosmetic reasons is prohibited for the 48 hours after start of study drug administration. 
Systemic corticosteroids for migraine or for any other reason are prohibited for 48 hours after 
start of study drug administration except if required to treat life threatening allergic reactions.  
Any hormonal therapy (e.g., contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy) use must be stable and ongoing for at least 3 months prior to screening and for the duration of the study.  
Any migraine preventive treatment use must be stable and ongoing for at least 1 month prior to 
screening and for the duration of the study.

the acute treatment of migraines. The investigator should re- evaluate the subject’s risk factors 
relative to the prescribing information for both prophylactic and acute treatments that the subject 
is using, and judge that the use of these medications continues to be considered safe. 
The Medical Monitor should be contacted for any questions regarding restricted medications. 
9.4.3. Rescue Medications  
Rescue medication is defined as any medication to treat migraine or migraine associated 
symptoms. Two hours after start of study drug administration, subjects who did not adequately 
respond may take their own rescue medication or may elect to take no further medication. 
Inadequate response is defined as meeting 1 of the following: 
• Continues to experience moderate or severe headache pain; OR  
• Continues to experience significant migraine associated symptoms; OR  
• After initial migraine relief at 2 hours, headache or migraine associated symptoms 
returns within 2 to 48 hours after the dose of study drug 
At the discretion of the investigator, additional rescue medication may be provided to the subject 2 hours post start of infusion if their own rescue medication is inappropriate or does not provide 
adequate relief. Common examples of rescue medications include ketorolac, injectable or intranasal triptans, antiemetics, diphenhydramine, or in extreme cases, opioids. 
9.4.4. Contraceptives  
All women ar e required to have a negative pregnancy test at the Screening Visit and on Day 0 
prior to dosing. Women of child-bearing potential and males with partners of child-bearing 
potential must agree  to use adequate contraception during the screening period of the study and 
for the duration of the study. Abstinence is not an acceptable form of contraception for this study. Acceptable methods of contraception for females of child- bearing potential and males 
with partners of child- bearing potential are:  
• Intrauterine devices  
• Double-barrier methods (e.g., condoms and/or diaphragms/cervical cap with spermicidal gel or foam)  
• Hormonal contraceptives (oral, depot, patch, injectable, intrauterine devices or vaginal ring), stabilized for at least 3 months prior to screening 
• Vasectomy with use of condom (for male subjects) 
Females are considered of childbearing potential unless they are:  
• Permanently sterilized (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral 
oophorectomy or hysterectomy) at least 3 months prior to screening 
• Postmenopausal (i.e., no menses for at least 1 year)

Assessments.  
10.2. Assessments and Procedures  
10.2.1. Eligibility Verification  
During subject screening, after the ICF is signed and subject is determined by the site to be 
eligible, the site will submit an Eligibility Verification Packet to the PRA Medical Monitor via the Clinical6 portal, see the Clinical6 training materials for additional information.  
10.2.2. Randomization and Dosing 
Randomization and dosing must occur at the Day 0 visit, once the medical monitor approves the subject’s eligibility status.   
All subjects will be randomized via EDC after the following:   
• Eligibility has been approved by the medical monitor  
• Review of all inclusion/exclusion criteria to confirm subject is eligible on Day 0  
• Subject confirms continued interest in participating in the study  
If > 6 hours has passed since the onset of migraine, the subject will not be dosed with study drug.  
10.2.3. Demographics 
The year of birth, age, sex, ethnicity and race, will be collected in the source and recorded and in 
the CRF at Screening.   
10.2.4. Medical and Migraine History  
Medical history collection will include medical history as well as social and family history.  Significant historic and current medical conditions or illnesses, allergies to medications, and 
prior surgical interventions will be recorded in the source records and in the CRF.  Symptoms 
present at the time of informed consent will be considered medical history.   
Migraine history will be collected at the screening visit by the investigator. The data gathered will be collected in the source and recorded in the CRF, including but not limited to:  
• Diagnostic criteria for migraine with or without aura as defined by ICHD -3 
• Migraine medication use (past and present, acute and preventive) 
• Age at diagnosis of migraine, migraine triggers and other details of the subjects’ history 
with migraine

eligibility criteria are met.  
10.2.5. Physical Examinations 
Physical examinations will be performed at the times noted in the Schedule o f Events and 
Assessments in Section  2 and must be performed by an investigator who has been trained and 
delegated the task on the Delegation of Authority Log.  
The physical examination at the screening visit will be comprehensive and appropriate to determine the overall physical health of each subject. Examination of the genitourinary system 
and rectum may be deferred by the investigator if the subject’s related medical history and 
review of systems are negative.  For all other visits that call for a physical examination, the body 
systems examined will be at the discretion of the investigator.   
Physical examinations will also include height, weight and BMI, which can be delegated to other 
blinded site staff. Weight will be measured at all visits, while height and BMI will be measured at screening only. 
Abnormal physical examination findings at the screening visit will be recorded as medical 
history.  Any new or worsening physical examination finding identified at subsequent visits will be considered an AE.   
10.2.6. Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including blood pressure (BP) and heart rate, will be measured at the time points 
specified in the Schedule of Events and As sessments in Section  2. 
When measuring vital signs, the subject should be rested for 5 minutes before obtaining vital signs.  Blood pressure may be repeated to confirm measurement if appropriate.    
10.2.7. eDiary Assessments  
Subjects will be assigned an electronic diary (eDiary) prior to dosing on Day 0 to collect migraine data. At the Screening and Day 0 visits, the site staff will train the subject on eDia ry 
use and educate the subject on the importance of completing the eDiary at all timepoints. Subjects will be instructed to complete the eDiary at all timepoints from pre -dose through 
48 hours. Additionally, subjects will complete eDiary data entry from Da y 3 until a new 
migraine is reported (specified in the Schedule of Events and Assessments [ Section 2]). The 
subject will be instructed to return the eDiary at the Week 4 clinic visit. The data collected includes but is not limited to: 
• Start of infusion (t=0) 
• Headache severity on a four -point Likert scale (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 
3=severe)  
• Presence or absence of migraine associated symptoms, including nausea, photophobia 
or phonophobia, one of which will be identified prior to dosing as the s ubject's most 
bothersome migraine- associated symptom  
• Use of rescue and acute treatment of migraine medication

Protocol number, subject number and date of administration must be captured on all questionnaires.   
10.2.9.1. Headache Impact Test (HIT -6) 
The Headache Impact Test (HIT -6) is a tool used to measure the impact and effect on the ability 
to function normal in daily life when a headache occurs. The HIT-6 is a 6 question, Likert- type, 
self-reporting questionnaire with responses ranging from “Never” to “Always” with the 
following response scores: Never=6, Rarely=8, Sometimes=10, Very Often=11, Always=13. The 
total score for the HIT -6 is the sum of each response score and will be treated as missing if the 
response is missing for one or more questions. The HIT-6 total score ranges from 36 to 78, with 
score ranges having the following life impact:  
 
Subjects will be given the questionnaire at Screening and Week 4 visits and asked to review the brief instructions and complete. The com pleted HIT -6 questionnaire must be reviewed for 
completeness and clarity by site staff prior to the subject leaving the clinic.  The subject should be asked to complete any unanswered questions. 
10.2.9.2. Migraine Treatment Optimization Questionnaire- 6 (mTOQ -6) 
The migraine treatment optimization questionnaire -6 (mTOQ -6) is a tool used to assess response 
to acute treatment in persons with migraine. The mTOQ -6 is a 6 question, Likert- type, self -
reporting questionnaire with responses ranging from “Never” to “Half The T ime Or More” with 
the following response scores: Never=1, Rarely=2, Less Than Half The Time=3, Half The Time 
Or More=4. The total score for the mTOQ-6 is the sum of each response score and will be 
treated as missing if the response is missing for one or mo re questions.

completeness and clarity by site staff prior to the subject leaving the clinic.   
10.2.9.4. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The Columbia–Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) is an assessment tool that evaluates 
suicidal ideation and behavior. The C- SSRS will be administered by trained (i.e., C -SSRS 
certified) site staff at the time points specified in the Schedule of Events and Assessments in Section  2.  The C-SSRS “Baseline/Screening” version will be used for the Screening Visit, and 
the C -SSRS “Since Last Visit” version will be used for all subsequent visits.  
10.2.10. 12-Lead ECG  
ECGs will be performed using a 12-lead ECG device provided for the study at the time points specified in the Schedule of Events and Assessments in Section  2. ECG data will be transmitted 
and read centrally by a cardiologist; however, the investigator must review the ECG at screening and Week 4 and ensure there are no clinically significant abnormalities. In addition, all confirmed (i.e., c entrally -read) ECGs will be reviewed by the investigator and evaluated for 
clinical significance to verify eligibility.   
All ECGs are expected to be performed on the ECG device provided to the site by the study sponsor. A local ECG device may be used only if there are technical issues with the central ECG 
device that cannot be resolved while the subject is onsite. If a local ECG device is used, a paper 
ECG must be submitted to the central ECG reader. All technical issues must be reported immediately to the  central ECG help desk. 
10.2.11. Laboratory Samples and Testing 
10.2.11.1. Urine Drug Screening  
A screening test for drugs of abuse will be performed on urine samples during the screening visit and on Day 0 visit prior to dosing.  Urine drug screen kits will be provided by the central lab and the test performed on site.  If a urine drug screen is positive and there is no medical record 
documentation of prescribed medications to explain the result, the subject should be considered 
for exclusion from the study. Questions regardi ng the eligibility can be addressed with the 
medical monitor.

11.1. Adverse Events  
11.1.1. Definitions  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation 
participant administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not related to the study drug. (ICH E6) 
11.1.2. Assessment of Adverse Events  
The investigator is required to monitor the occurrence of adverse events for each subject from 
the time of informed consent through the course of the clinical study.  Adverse events may be reported  by the subject, reported by a caregiver, or reported by the investigative site through 
investigator site personnel open-ended questioning, through physical examination, laboratory test, documentation in medical records, or by other means.  Adverse events include: 
• Any new undesirable medical experience or an unfavorable and unintended change of an existing condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not considered related to the study drug. 
• Any abnormal assessment or laboratory findings considered by the investigator to be clinically significant.  Clinically significant findings include but are not limited to those that lead to discontinuation or interruption of study treatment, require therapeutic intervention, or require a change in subject  management.  
A new or worsening of a pre-existing or chronic condition is considered an adverse event and must be reported as such.  Medical conditions, which existed prior to the time of informed consent into the clinical study are part of the patient's medical history and are not considered an 
adverse event.  Unchanged, chronic, non-worsening or pre- existing conditions from the time of 
informed consent are not adverse events and should not be recorded on the AE CRF. A pre-
existing or chronic condition that worsens after signing the informed consent is considered an adverse event.  
Pre-existing medical conditions of clinical significance must be included in the subject’s medical 
history and recorded on the medical history CRF page. Presenting migraine symptoms on the day of study drug administration are not considered adverse events. 
Progression of treatment indication including new or worsening of anticipated clinical signs or 
symptoms, which are collected as clinical efficacy variables and assessed as uneq uivocally 
associated with the symptom progression and /or lack of efficacy, should NOT be reported as adverse events unless the symptom progression is greater than anticipated in the natural course of the disease.  
Each event recorded on the AE CRF is required to be assessed by the investigator with regard to the following; seriousness, severity, and relationship to study drug, as outlined below.

Lundbeck Seattle BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.  
01-Jul-2020 
Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 65 Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Migraines 
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying 
migraine should NOT be recorded as AEs . Migraine activity will be recorded in the eD iary and 
these data will be captured as effectiveness assessment data only. If there is any uncertainty as to 
whether an event is due to disease progression or worsening, it should be reported as an AE . 
Seriousness  
An adverse event or suspected adverse event is considered serious if in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in; 
• Death  
• Is life -threatening (that the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does 
not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolonged existing hospitalization 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial dis ruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• Congenital anomaly/ birth defect 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgement, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and/or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition (
21 CFR 
312.32(a ) and ICH E2A).  
Of note: 
• A social hospitalization (i.e., hospitalizations for pre -admissions not due to an acute 
medical issue) is not considered an SAE  
• A hospitalization is defined as greater than 24-hour post hospital admission 
Severity  
The severity of an AE will be graded as follows: 
• Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; c linical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated. 
• Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL).  
• Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -
care ADL.  
• Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
• Grade 5 Death related to AE.

Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 65 Relationsh ip to Study Drug  
The investigator is required to assess the causality/relationship between each AE and the study 
drug as not related or related and record the assessment on the source documents and in the CRF 
AE page. Medical judgment should be used to det ermine the likely relationship of the AE to the 
study drug considering all relevant factors including (but not limited to) relevant history, 
concomitant medical condition and concomitant medications.  Determination should be based on 
assessment of temporal  relationships, biologic plausibility, association (or lack of association) 
with underlying disease, and presence (or absence) of a more likely cause.   
Not Related:  It is plausible that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug (e.g., pre-
existing condition, underlying disease, concomitant medical condition, or concomitant 
medication).  
Related:  The AE cannot reasonably be explained by the subject’s clinical state, concomitant 
medical condition or concomitant therapies, and a temporal relationship ex ists between the 
event onset and administration of the study drug.  
11.1.3. Recording Adverse Events  
Event reporting will extend from time of informed consent until completion of the final visit. AEs should be recorded on the AE CRF, whether believed by the investigator to be related or not related to the study drug.  
AE reporting should contain: 
• A brief description of the event 
• Date of onset  
• Date of resolution 
• Severity  
• Actions taken or treatment required  
• Relationship to study drug  
• Outcome  
• Whether the event is considered serious 
Whenever possible, the investigator should group signs or symptoms that constitute a single 
diagnosis into a single event term.  For example, “cough, rhinitis, and sneezing” might be grouped together as “upper respiratory tract infection.” 
Asymptomatic abnormal findings considered by the investigator to be clinically significant 
should be recorded as an AE, unless it is associated with a clinical syndrome that has already been reported as an AE.

Lundbeck Seattle BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.  
01-Jul-2020 
Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 65 11.1.4. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur during the study period (beginning with informed consent), whether 
considered to be related to the study drug or not, must be reported within 24 hours of awareness 
or knowledge of the event.  Serious adverse events occurring within 30 days of the end of the clinical study must be reported regardless of the relationship with the study dr ug. The SAE 
Notification Form should be used to report any related SAEs which occur after the end of the clinical study.  
The date the site personnel became aware of the serious adverse event must be recorded in the 
source document.  To report the SAE, com plete the CRF AE page and indicate the reason for 
seriousness.  The minimum information required for an initial report is: 
• Sender of report (name, address of investigator) 
• Subject identification (screening/randomization number, initials, NOT subject name)  
• Protocol number 
• Description of SAE (e.g., event term) 
• Seriousness criteria  
• Relationship assessment  
After receipt of the initial report, the medical monitor or designee will review the information and, if necessary, contact the investigator to obtain further information for assessment of the 
event.  The Sponsor or designee will be responsible for information processing and reporting in accordance with applicable local and regulatory requirements.  
The sponsor will determine if an SAE requires expedited repor ting to regulatory agencies.  The 
clinical study site personnel are responsible for reporting these events to their IRB according to the institution’s IRB reporting requirements and in accordance with applicable local and regulatory requirements. 
Should the EDC System not be available, serious adverse events must be reported on the paper 
SAE Notification Form. Additional details can be found in the Site Manual.  This does not 
replace the EDC reporting system; information must be entered in the EDC system on ce the 
system returns to normal function. 
11.1.5. Unexpected and Related Serious Adverse Events  
Unexpected SAEs are those which:  
• Are not previously reported as associated with eptinezumab, as referenced in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
• May be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an AE listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, but differ from the event due to greater severity, frequency or specificity.  
The sponsor or designee will report, to the appropriate regulatory authorities according to local 
and regulatory requirements, unexpected SAEs which are considered related to eptinezumab 
(suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions [SUSARs]).  The clinical study site personnel 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -015  
Lundbeck Seattle BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.  
01-Jul-2020 
Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 of 65 are responsible for reporting these events to their EC/IR B in accordance with applicable local 
and regulatory requirements. 
11.1.6. Follow- up of Adverse Events  
Irrespective of the suspected causality, AEs will be monitored until resolution, stabilization in 
the judgment of the investigator, or the subject completes the study, is lost to follow up or 
withdraws from the study. 
The investigators must report new significant follow-up information to the Sponsor within  24 
hours of becoming aware of the event for SAE’s and enter into EDC Rave within 5 business days 
for AE’s.  New significant information includes the following: 
• new signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis 
• significant new diagnostic test results  
• change in causality based on new information 
• change in the event's outcome, including recovery 
• additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event 
11.1.7. Pregnancy  
In the event that a female subject becomes pregnant following administration of study drug or 
may have been pregnant at the time of study drug exposure, or the partner of a male subject 
becomes pregnant following administration of study drug, the pregnancy must be reported to the 
sponsor within five business days of the Investigator becoming aware of the pregnancy.  
Pregnancy information will be reported to the Sponsor using the Exposure In-Utero Forms in 
EDC.  
Although pregnancy per se  is not considered an AE, the outcome of a pregnancy that results in a 
birth defect or congenital anomaly or hospitalization for any reason is considered to be an SAE.  Every attempt should be made to follow a pregnancy to conclusion.   
Follow-up information is to be collected by the Investigator and provided to the sponsor 
regarding:  
• The course of the pregnancy including perinatal and neonatal outcome, premature 
termination of the pregnancy, or miscarriage  
• Offspring information including birth weight and birth defects (if any)  
All pregnancies that occur after a subject completes the study and up to 6 months after study 
drug admini stration should be reported by the subject to the investigative site. The investigator 
must report it to the Sponsor within five business days of awareness or knowledge of the pregnancy. 
11.1.8. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior  
Recent meta-analyses, spontaneous reports, and published case reports regarding suicidal 
ideation and behavior arising from drugs tested in clinical studies have been noted as an area of 
general concern. Based on this information, the United States Food and Drug Administration 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -015  
Lundbeck Seattle BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.  
01-Jul-2020 
Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45 of 65 (FDA) has provided guidance to prospectively assess suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical 
studies to ensure that subjects in clinical studies who are experiencing suicidal ideation and 
behavior are properly recognized and adequately treated and to ensure the collection of more timely and more complete data on suicidal ideation and behavior than have been collected in the 
past ( FDA, 2012 ). The C- SSRS (Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale) will be used for this 
purpose.  Any subject who answers “yes” to questions 4 or 5 of the C-SSRS during the screening 
visit will be referred to a mental health specialist by the investigator.  During the course of the 
study after dosing, any subject who answers “yes” to questions 4 or 5 of the Suicidal Ideation 
section or answers “yes” to any question in the Suicidal Behavior section of the C- SSRS will be 
referred by investigators to a mental health specialist.  Affirmative answers to questions 4 or 5 for suicidal ideation or to any question for suicidal behavior will be reported in EDC as an AE. 
11.2. Management of Reactions to Study Drug  
There are no specific antidotes to an infusion of eptinezumab.  
A medical emergency should be treated appropriately by the investigator using proper standard 
of care, according to their typical clinical practice and local guidelines for that emergency 
condition.  Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of these potential adverse events must be available for immediate use.   
Should a medical condition arise that the investigator believes is related to the study drug, clinical judgment should be used to provide the appropriate response including the consideration of discontinuation of study drug. Any events believed to be allergic reactions should be discussed with the medical monitor.  
If a subject experiences an allergic reaction, as assessed by the Investigator, that necessitates intervention including study drug interruption or discontinuation and/or the administration of 
standard medica l treatment, the site will collect additional blood specimens using the immune 
response lab kit, per the laboratory manual, at the time of the event and again at the next 
scheduled visit. This assessment includes serum histamine, serum tryptase, immunoglobulin E, and complement components.

01-Jul-2020 
Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 46 of 65 12. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
The data collected will be used to assess the following endpoints:  
12.1. Headache Pain Freedom  
Headache pain will be collected on a 4 -point scale with 3 being severe, 2 being moderate, 
1 being mild, and 0 being no pain. Headache pain freedom is defined as no pain (0) with the 
absence of rescue medication (note that rescue medication is prohibited for 2 hours post start of infusion). Assessment of headache pain will be taken at all selected  timepoints up to 48 hours. 
Time to headache pain freedom, which is one of the co- primary endpoints, is the first timepoint 
post start of infusion at which the subject reports freedom of pain meaning their headache pain has gone from moderate or severe (2 or 3) at baseline to no pain (0) with no administration of 
rescue medication. Headache pain freedom at 2 hours post start of infusion is one of the key 
secondary endpoints of this study; evaluation at all other timepoints are secondary (at 4 hours) and exploratory endpoints.  
12.2. Most Bothersome Migraine -Associated Symptom  
MBS is the symptom (from among nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia) that has been identified by the subject on Day 0 prior to dosing as being the most bothersome one for the migraine bein g treated. Absence of MBS is defined as freedom from the migraine- associated 
symptom with no administration of rescue medication. Assessment of MBS will be taken at all selected time points from pre -dose to 48 hours. Time to absence of MBS, which is one of the 
co-primary endpoints, is the first timepoint post start of infusion at which the subject reports 
absence of MBS with no administration of rescue medication. Absence of MBS at 2 hours post start of infusion is one of the key secondary endpoints of this study; evaluation of absence of migraine associated symptoms at all other timepoints are secondary (at 4 hours) and exploratory 
endpoints.  
12.3. Sustained Pain Freedom  
Freedom from headache pain (0) at 2 hours and sustaining this pain-free status to 24 and 48 hours (i.e. pain free 2 - 24 and 2- 48 hours) with no administration of rescue medication. 
12.4. Rescue Medication  
Use of rescue medication at any time, which is defined as any intervention (medical or device) 
provided to the subject to provide relief of migraine. This should not be provided sooner than 
2 hours following start of the study drug administration.

Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 of 65 13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1. Decision Rule  
Pair-wise testing of each eptinezumab group vs. placebo will be performed. The testing 
procedure will start  with primary endpoints. The result that is considered a study success is when 
both time to headache pain freedom and time to absence of MBS are statistically significant at 
the 5% significance level. If this occurs, testing will continue to key secondary endpoints.  
The key secondary endpoints will be tested hierarchically at a 5% significance level  (pain 
freedom at 2 hours, followed by absence of most bothersome symptom at 2 hours). If both key 
secondary endpoints achieve statistical significance, the secondary endpoints will be tested hierarchically at 5% level of significance (pain freedom at 4 hours, followed by absence of most bothersome symptom at 4 hours, followed by use of rescue medication within 24 hours).  
13.2. Sample Size  
The planned sample size for this study is 450 randomized and dosed subjects. These subjects will be allocated into 2 treatment groups, eptinezumab vs. placebo, in a 1:1 ratio. Two hundred 
twenty -five subjects per group provides at least 90% power to detect a 0.736 hazard ratio 
favori ng eptinezumab at the 5% significance level for both co-primary endpoints. In addition, 
this sample size also provides 90% power for the key secondary endpoints, assuming that each at 5% significance level eptinezumab increases response rates for both 2 -hour endpoints by at least 
14.5 percentage points and that the correlation between these two endpoints is 0.8.  
13.3. General Considerations  
13.3.1. Definition of Baseline  
The baseline assessment will be the latest available valid measurement taken prior to the 
administra tion of study drug on Day 0 (an eDiary will be assigned before dosing on the day of 
treatment visit).  
13.3.2. Handling of Missing Data 
Summary statistics will be reported based upon observed data. Subjects with missing data for the time-to-event co -primary endpoints will be considered to be censored at the last timepoint prior 
to the missing assessments. In the case of subjects having missing headache eDiary data at the 2-hour assessment, they will be assigned as non-responders for the key secondary endpoints, regardless of treatment arm.  Additionally, if the start date of an AE or concomitant medication is 
incomplete or missing, it will be assumed to have occurred on or after the intake of study medication, except if an incomplete date (e.g., month and year) clearly indicates that the event started prior to treatment.  
13.3.3. Populations to be Analyzed 
The populations to be analyzed are as follows: 
Protocol ALD403- CLIN -015  
Lundbeck Seattle BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.  
01-Jul-2020 
Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 48 of 65 Full Analysis Population: Randomized subjects who received eptinezumab/placebo. Subjects 
will be summarized within the treatment group to which they were randomized. This population 
will be used for efficacy analyses.  
Safety Population: Includes all subjects who received eptinezumab or placebo infusions. Subjects 
will be summarized within the treatment group for which they actually received treatment. This 
population will be used for the safety analyses. 
13.4. Statistical Methods  
Continuous variables will be summarized with mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized with frequency and percentage.   
13.4.1. Subject Disposition, Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
An accounting of all randomized study subjects by disposition will be presented. This 
summarization will include a summary of all subjects who have received study drug. 
Demographic, baseline characteristics, migraine history and concomitant medications (coded  by 
the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary) will be summarized descriptively by treatment 
group. 
13.4.2. Efficacy Analyses 
Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The analysis of the time to pain freedom will be based upon Kaplan-Meier method. The 
treatment difference wi ll be assessed by the stratified log -rank test. A stratified Cox proportional 
hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling will be used to assess the magnitude of the 
treatment difference (i.e., hazard ratio) between the treatment arms. The median estimate for 
each treatment group, hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval from the stratified Cox model with Efron's method of tie handling and with a single treatment covariate will be reported.  The analysis of the time to absence of MBS will be conducted similarly.  
Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
For each of the 2 -hour endpoints, the treatment groups will be compared using a Cochran-
Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test, adjusting for the study’s stratification factors. The treatment 
difference estimation, odds ratio, and associated confidence intervals will be provided. 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The absence of headache pain (headache pain freedom) at 4 hours, and the absence of most 
bothersome symptom at 4 hours will be analyzed similarly to the key secondary endpoints. 
The use of rescue medication within 24 hours will be analyzed similarly to the key secondary 
endpoints. In case of a missing assessment, it will be assumed that no rescue medication was taken in connection with that assessment. 
Exploratory Efficacy Analyses 
Additional exploratory efficacy endpoints will be assessed.

13.4.3.1. Adverse Events  
The incidence of all AEs will be tabulated by treatment received. These AEs will be classified by 
system organ class and preferred term using the Medical  Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). For incidence reporting, if a subject reported more than one AE that was coded to 
the same preferred term/system organ class, the subject will be counted only once for that 
specific preferred term/system organ class. Events recorded between the time the informed 
consent is signed and the study drug administration will be provided as part of a listing. 
An overview of AEs, which includes subject incidence of AEs, SAEs, deaths will be presented. 
For AEs presented  by severity, the worst severity during the clinical study will be presented for 
each subject.  
The subject incidence of AEs will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term.  
13.4.3.2. Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs will be listed and summarized in a similar manner to AEs.  
13.4.3.3. Clinical Laboratory Results 
Summary statistics for actual values and for changes from baseline will be tabulated for clinical 
laboratory results by scheduled visit. Subjects with clinical laboratory values outside of the 
normal reference range at any post -baseline assessment will be summarized. Shifts from baseline 
clinical laboratory values based upon the normal range and will be tabulated.  
13.4.3.4. Electrocardiogram (ECG) Results  
The observed data at baseline and change from baseline for each measurement day will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics.   
13.4.3.5. Vital Signs  
The observed data at baseline and change from baseline for each measurement day will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics.  
13.4.3.6. C-SSRS 
The C -SSRS assesses lifetime suicidality d uring an initial baseline evaluation, and then monitors 
suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior at subsequent follow-up assessments.  Four constructs are measured.  The first and second are the severity and intensity of ideation, rated on a 5-point 
ordinal scale.  The third is the behavior subscale, which is rated on a nominal scale and the fourth 
is the lethality subscale, which assesses actual attempts.  These results will be reported at baseline and post baseline.  Results for individual time points will be provided in a listing.

14.1. Data Quality Assurance  
The sponsor or designee will assess the site to verify the qualifications of each Investigator, 
according to sponsor’s or applicable SOPs. There will be an inspection of site facilities, and 
investigator will be further informed of responsibilities and the procedures for ensuring adequate 
and correct documentation. 
The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the clinical study for each clinical 
study subject. All information recorded on the CRFs for this clinical study must be consistent with the subjects’ source documentation (i.e., medical records). 
14.2. Case Report Forms and Source Documents  
As part of the responsibilities assumed by participating in the study, the principal investigator or sub-investigator agrees to maintain adequate case histories for the subjects treated as part of the 
research under this protocol. The principal investigator or sub- investigator agrees to maintain 
accurate CRFs and source documentation as part of the case histories. These source documents include, but are not limited to, eDiary archives, laboratory reports and original ECGs.  
14.3. Study Documentation  
Source document is defined as any hand written or computer-generated document that contains medical information or test results that have been collected for or are in support of the protocol 
specifications, e.g., clinical laborat ory reports, clinic notes, drug disbursement log, subject sign 
in sheets, subject completed questionnaires if applicable, telephone logs, ECGs, etc. All draft, 
preliminary and pre-final iterations of a final report are also considered to be source documents, 
e.g., faxed laboratory reports and hard copy laboratory reports, faxed initial results and hard 
copy, final report. 
14.4. Data Collection and Electronic Data Capture (EDC)  
The data collected during the study (except clinical laboratory test results, ECG results) will be 
recorded in the subject’s CRF. The study site(s) will use an EDC system that is compliant with 
relevant FDA regulatory requirements per 21 CFR Part 11. Data queries and data corrections will be handled through the same system. All transactions within the EDC system are fully 
documented within an electronic audit trail. Each set of completed CRFs must be reviewed after 
being source verified by monitor and electronically signed and dated by the investigator. The mTOQ-6, HIT-6, PGIC and C-SSRS questionnaires will be completed on paper . The eDiary 
assessments will be collected on the electronic diary (eDiary).  
14.5. Archiving Clinical Trial Records 
According to ICH guide lines, essential documents should be retained for a minimum of 2 years 
after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years have elaps ed since 
the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the Investigational Product. However,

Lundbeck Seattle BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.  
01-Jul-2020 
Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51 of 65 these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by applicable legal 
requirements.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator and site  staff to maintain a comprehensive and 
centralized filing system of all clinical trial-related documentation. This centralized file should 
be available for inspection at any time by the Monitor or Quality Assurance staff for monitoring 
or auditing by Lundb eck Seattle Bio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and regulatory authorities. Elements of 
clinical trial documentation should include: 
• Subject files containing the completed CRFs supporting source documentation and the signed ICF 
• Clinical trial files, containing the protocol with all amendments, the investigator 
Brochure, copies of all clinical trial documentation, and all correspondence to and 
from the ethics committee and Lundbeck Seattle Bio Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
• Pharmacy files, containing the Investigational Product Accountability Records or dispensation logs and all clinical trial agent- related correspondence  
14.6. Good Clinical Practice  
The procedures set out in this clinical trial protocol are designed to ensure that the sponsor and 
investigator abide by the principles of the GCP guidelines of the ICH and applicable federal and 
local regulations. The clinical trial also will be conducted in keeping with local legal requirements.  
14.7. Informed Consent  
Before each subject is admitted to the clinical trial, informed consent will be obtained from the 
subject (or his/her legally authorized representative) at the screening visit according to the regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country. The consent forms must be dated 
and retained by the investigator as part of the clinical trial records. The Investigator will not 
undertake any investigation specifically required for the clinical trial until valid consent has been 
obtained. The terms of the consent and when it was obtained must also be documented in the 
CRF. Each  subject will receive a fully -signed copy of each consent form that he/she signs for the 
clinical trial.  
If a protocol amendment is required, the ICF may need to be revised to reflect the changes to the protocol. If the consent form is revised, it must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate 
ethics committee and signed by all subjects subsequently enrolled in the clinical trial as well as those currently enrolled in the clinical trial. If a subject’s partner becomes pregnant during the 
subject’s partici pation in the trial, a separate pregnancy informed consent form for the pregnant 
partner will be obtained, to allow the sponsor to follow the pregnancy, any complications, and 
the health of the baby.  The pregnancy consent should be obtained at the time the investigator becomes aware of the pregnancy.

Version No. PR-0097.03 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 52 of 65 14.8. Protocol Approval and Amendment  
Before the start of the clinical trial, the clinical trial protocol and/or other relevant documents 
will be approved by the ethics committee, in accordance with local legal requ irements. The 
sponsor must ensure that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the first subject 
is enrolled in the clinical study.  
The procedures outlined in the protocol and CRFs will be carefully reviewed by the investigator and staff pr ior to clinical study initiation to ensure appropriate interpretation and implementation. 
No deviations from the protocol should be made except in emergency situations where alternative treatment is necessary for the protection, proper care and well -being of subjects. 
This protocol is to be followed exactly. To alter the protocol, amendments must be written, and approvals must be received from the appropriate personnel and from the ethics committee before 
implementation (if appropriate). Amendments will originate from Lundbeck Seattle 
BioPharmaceuticals, Inc., and will be provided to the investigator for submission to his/her ethics 
committee for their review and approval prior to implementation (if appropriate). It should be 
noted that when an amendment to a protocol substantially alters the clinical study design or 
increases potential risk to the clinical study subject, the ICF should be revised and subject’s consent to continue participation should be obtained. 
Administrative changes may be made without th e need for a formal amendment. All amendments 
will be distributed to all protocol recipients, with appropriate instructions.  
14.8.1. Premature Termination of the Clinical Study  
Lundbeck Seattle BioP harmaceuticals, Inc., reserves the right to terminate this clinical study at 
any time. The FDA or other governing national authority may also terminate the clinical study.  
The principal investigator may discontinue participation in the study. If the clinical study is 
terminated prior to scheduled completion, the investigator will be notified and given any 
necessary instructions concerning final examinations that are required . If the investigator, the 
sponsor, or the medical monitor becomes aware of conditions or events that suggest a possible 
safety hazard to subjects if the clinical study continues, the clinical study may be terminated after appropriate consultation between the relevant parties.  
14.9. Confidentiality  
All clinical study findings and documents will be regarded as confidential. The Investigator and members of his/her research team must not disclose such information without prior written approval from the sponsor. 
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained. Subjects will be identified on CRFs 
and other documents by their subject number, initials and/or birth date, not by name and in 
accordance with local requirements. Documents not to be submitted that identify the subject (e.g., the signed informed consent) must be maintained in confidence by the investigator.

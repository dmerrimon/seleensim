Study Title: A Phase 3 Study of BBI-608 in combination with 5-Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, 
Irinotecan (FOLFIRI) in Adult Patients with Previously Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (CRC). 
Study Number: CanStem303C (aka BB608-303CRC) 
Study Phase:  3 
Study Drug: BBI-608, a novel investigational small mo lecule anticancer drug that is 
hypothesized to affect multiple oncogenic cellular pathways, including inhibition of 
the signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway, which 
has been implicated in cancer stem cell viability.

4 Study Design: This is an international multi-center, prospective, open-label, randomized, adaptive 
design Phase 3 trial of the cancer stem cell pathway inhibitor BBI -608 plus 
standard bi -weekly FOLFIRI (Arm 1) versus standard bi- weekly FOLFIRI (Arm 2) 
in patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The 
hypotheses in General Population and pSTAT3(+) S ubpopulation for OS in the 
study will be tested . An interim analysis will be conducted to check the decision 
rules of futility, population and hypothesis selection, and event count adjustment. 
The Sponsor and the CRO have implement blinding plans to minimize bias prior to 
the interim and final analyses.  
In this study, adult patients with mCRC following progression on first-line 
FOLFOX or XELOX with or without bevacizumab will be randomized in a 1:1 
ratio to BBI -608 plus biweekly FOLFIRI (Arm 1) or biweekly FOLFIRI (Arm 2). 
Addition of bevacizumab to the FOLFIRI regimen, per Investigator choice, will be 
permissible. Patients will be stratified according to geographical region (North 
America/Western Europe/Australia, vs. Japan/ Korea vs. rest of the world); time to 
progression from start of first line therapy (<6 months vs. ≥6 months); RAS 
mutation status (mutant vs. wild type), bevacizumab as part of their  protocol 
treatment (yes vs. no) , and location of the primary tumor (left vs. right colon).  
The study will proceed in 14 -day (2-week) cycles. BBI- 608 will be administered 
orally, twice daily, with doses separated by approximately 12 hours . Standard 
FOLFIRI will be administered biweekly, on Day 1 of each 14 -day study cycle. 
BBI-608 administration will begin 2 to 5 days prior to the first FOLFIRI infusion in 
patients randomized to Arm 1. In Investigator selected patients, bevacizumab will 
be administered per product label and institutional standards. 
Tumor assessments will be performed every 8 weeks after randomization until 
6 months of treatment and every 12 weeks thereafter until objective disease 
progression .  
Retrospective analysis of archival tumor tissue samples will be performed at the 
time of the interim analysis to determine pSTAT3 status of randomized patients. 
Study 
Population: The study will enroll patients with histolog ically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the 
colon or rectum that is metastatic (Stage IV, mCRC). Patients will have failed 
treatment with  first- line combination therapy of oxaliplatin and a fluoropyrimidine 
with or without bevacizumab for metastatic disease, with failure defined as 
radiologic progression during or ≤6 months after the last dose of first- line therapy. 
Patients who discontinued first -line therapy due to toxicity may be enrolled as long 
as progression occurred ≤6 months after the last dose of first- line therapy. Patients 
receiving any other systemic chem otherapy in the metastatic setting will be 
excluded. All patients must have received a minimum of 6 weeks of the first -line 
regimen that included oxaliplatin and a fluoropyrimidine with or without 
bevacizumab in the same cycle. Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic treatment is 
allowed as long as no more than 2  prior systemic chemotherapy regimens were 
administered with no more than 1 prior regimen permitted in the metastatic setting. 
For participants with rectal cancer, sequential neoadjuvant and adjuvant  therapy 
will count as a single systemic regimen. Re -challenge with oxaliplatin is permitted 
and will be considered part of the first -line regimen for metastatic disease, with 
both initial oxaliplatin treatment and subsequent re -challenge being considered as 
1 regimen. Patients with measurable or non- measurable disease may be included. 
Other inclusion criteria for all patients include: age ≥18 yea rs.; ECOG performance 
status ≤1 and adequate hepatic, renal, and bone-marrow function.

5 Test Product, 
Dose, and Mode 
of 
Administration:  Patients in this study will receive BBI-608 orally, daily, at 240 mg bid (480 mg 
total daily dose) . In each cycle BBI-608 will be taken daily for 2 weeks (14 days). 
BBI-608 will be administered twice daily, 1 hour prior or 2 hours after meals, with 
the first dose taken in the morning and doses separated by approximately 12 hours. 
Patients will receive BBI -608 in combination with FOLFIRI. Addition of 
bevacizumab to the FOLFIRI regimen, per Investigator choice, will be permissible. 
FOLFIRI chemotherapy infusion will start at least 2 hours following the first daily 
dose of BBI -608 and will be administered every 2 weeks. If bevacizumab is added 
to the FOLFIRI regimen, bevacizumab infusion shoul d start at least 2 hours 
following the first dose of BBI -608 starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 and will be 
administered every 2 weeks. Irinotecan/leucovorin infusion will follow 
bevacizumab infusion in patients selected by the Investigator to receive standard 
dose of bevacizumab (5 mg/kg). Irinotecan 180 mg/m2 together with leucovorin 
400 mg/m2 will be administered intravenously, over approximately 90 minutes and 
2 hours, respectively, starting on Day 1 of Cycle  1, immediately following 
bevacizumab infusion or at l east 2 hours following the first daily dose of BBI- 608 
if bevacizumab is not administered. 5 -FU 400 mg/m2 bolus will be administered 
intravenously immediately following irinotecan/leucovorin infusion, followed by 
5-FU 1200 mg/m2/day (total 2400 mg/m2) cont inuous infusion. This regimen will 
be repeated on Day 1 of every 14-day cycle.  
Dose modification of BBI -608 and/or FOLFIRI is allowed. Dose modification of 
bevacizumab is per product label and institutional standards. 
Duration of 
Treatment:  Patients may continue to receive protocol therapy as long as they have not 
experienced any adverse events  (AEs) requiring permanent discontinuation of study 
medication and have not demonstrated disease progression based on RECIST 
criteria. If 1 or all components of the FOLFIRI re gimen is/are discontinued due to 
toxicity, BBI -608 should be continued until another discontinuation criterion is 
met. If BBI -608 is discontinued due to toxicity, FOLFIRI should be continued until 
another discontinuation criterion is met. 
Statistical 
Methods:  The primary study endpoints are OS in the General Population and the pSTAT3(+) 
Subpopulation . The hypotheses for the study are as follows: 
For the General Population, the null and alternative hypotheses are:  
H10: BBI- 608 + FOLFIRI ≤ FOLFIRI in the General Population 
H11: BBI-608+FOLFIRI > FOLFIRI in the General Population  
For the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation, the null and alternative hypotheses are: 
H20: BBI- 608 + FOLFIRI ≤ FOLFIRI in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation  
H21: BBI-608+FOLFIRI > FOLFIRI in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation 
A multiplicity adjustment strategy will be developed to control  the overall Type  I 
error rate with respect to several sources of mult iplicity in this trial. This 
multiplicity adjustment will employ the Hochberg -based gatekeeping procedure to 
account for the analysis of the treatment effect on the primary (OS) and key 
secondary (PFS, DCR, ORR) endpoints in the General Population and the 
pSTAT3 (+) Subpopulation.  
For the General Population, this study is designed to have a power of 90% and a 
1-sided α=0.025 to detect a 20% reduction in the risk of death (HR 0.80 which 
Study CanStem303C (Protocol Amendment 7.0)                    Amendment Date: 25 October 2019

6 corresponds to an increase of median survival from 12.54 to 15.68 months) in the 
General Population. The above design assumptions account for the anticipated 
varying control hazard rates for the bevacizumab versus no -bevacizumab 
stratification levels. It is assumed that approximately 30% of subjects will receive 
bevacizumab with expected mOS for the control arm FOLFIRI+bevacizumab 
subjects being 13.66 months while 70% of the subjects will not receive 
bevacizumab and have expected mOS of 12.06 months [Van Cutsem 2012 ]. 
Without adjusting for multiplicity, i t is estimated that 850 events in the General 
Population will be required to detect this reduction, which would be observed by 
randomizing 1250 patients (General Population) over 26 months with patient 
follow up for an additional 14 months, for a total study duration of 40 months. It is 
anticipated that up to 5% dropout rate will occur over the entire study.  
For the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation, without adjusting for multiplicity, and 
assuming 310  events (appro ximately 36% of 850) in pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation, 
there  will be approximately 88% nominal power at 1-sided α=0.025 to detect a 30% 
reduction (HR [BBI -608+FOLFIRI vs. FOLFIRI] = 0.70) in the risk of death in the 
pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation .  
The overall power of  the study will be approximately 90% (for both the General 
Population and the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation) after the multiplicity control 
procedure is considered .  
The interim analysis will be conducted when 425 deaths occur (50% of total 
number of 850 deaths) in the General Population. The OS results at the interim 
analysis will be reviewed by a  Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). The 
recommendations from DSMB on the study design and conduct will be based on 
the following decisions:  
x Futility stopping: terminate the trial or terminate pSTAT3(-) and 
pSTAT3 status unknown subpopulation due to lack of efficacy (futility).  
x Patient population and hypothesis select ion: select the most appropriate 
patient population and hypothesis (hypothesis in General P opulation, 
and/or hypothesis in pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation) for evaluating the 
significance of the treatment effect at the final analysis.  
x Event count adjustment: remain the current events size or increase the 
target number of events in 1 of or both pre-defi ned patient populations.  
Statistical Analysis for Primary and Key Secondary Endpoints:  
Overall survival in the General Population and the pSTAT3(+) 
Subpopulation , the primary endpoints of this study, are defined as the time 
from randomization to death from any cause. The survival experience of patients in both treatment groups will be summarized by the Kaplan
-Meier 
method and compared primarily by a stratified log -rank test adjusting for 
stratification va riables at randomization (listed in Section 3.1 ) for the 
General Population and unstratified log -rank test for the pSTAT3(+) 
Subpopulation .  
The progression free survival in both treatment groups will be summarized 
by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared primarily by a stratified log-rank

7 test adjusting for stratification variables at randomization for the General 
Population and unstratified log -rank test for the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation. 
Differences of DCR between the two treatment arms for the General 
Population, will be compared using a 1-sided Cochran-Mantel-H aenszel test 
stratified for stratification fa ctors.  Treatment difference of DCR and its 95% 
confidence interval based on harmonic mean method adjusting stratification 
factors will be provided.  For the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation, d ifferences of 
DCR between the two arms will be compared using a 1-sided Z-test via 
normal approximation .  Treatment difference of DCR and its 95% 
confidence interval based on normal approximation (unstratified) will be 
provided.   
Differences of ORR between the two arms will be analyzed the same as 
DCR for the General Population and for the pSTAT3(+) subpopulation.

19 2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE 
2.1. Colorectal Cancer 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second and third most commonly diagnosed type of cancer in 
females and males, respectively, with more th an 1.24 million cases diagnosed in 2008 alone 
[Mokarram 2017 ]. Approximately half of all diagnosed  CRC patients will develop disseminated 
advanced disease, which in most cases will be fatal [ Saunders 2006 ]. Standard treatment for 
unresectable metastatic disease currently includes first and second line 5-FU chemotherapy-
based regimen in combination with oxaliplati n or irinotecan. The vascular endothelial growth 
factor-A (VEGF-A) inhibitor, bevacizumab, has been shown to improve survival in combination 
with first and second line 5-FU based chemotherapy [ Welch 2010 ], while the VEGF/PlGF 
soluble decoy receptor, aflibercept, has been shown to improve OS in combination with the 
FOLFIRI regimen (irinotecan-5-fluorouracil-leucovori n) administered as second line therapy 
[Van Cutsem 2011 ]. Additionally, the monoclonal antibody epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) inhibitors, cetuximab and panitumumab, ha ve shown efficacy as third line monotherapy 
and in combination with earlier lines of therapy in patients with K-ras wild type tumors [Karapetis 2008; Amado 2008; Tol 2010; Bokemeyer 2012 ]. For the approximately 30% to 50% 
of colorectal tumors with an activating K-ras mutation [ Amado 2008 ], effective treatment options 
are further limited. At this time, a patient with  K-ras mutant tumor and progressive disease on 
second line therapy has treatme nt options generally limited to anti-angiogenic drugs including 
regorafenib monotherapy with a modest survival benefit of 1.4 months [ Grothey 2013 ], 
ramucirumab in combination with FOLFIRI providing a survival benefit of 1.6 months [Tabernero 2015 ], TAS-102, an oral fluoropyrimidine  analogue and thymidine phosphorylase 
inhibitor, recently proven to im prove overall survival by 1.8 months  in patients with refractory 
CRC over best supportive care [ Mayer 2015 ], an investigational regimen,  or best supportive care.  
Cancer stem cells (CSC), or cancer cells with stemness phenotypes, are a sub-population of 
cancer cells that have self-renewal capability, are highly malignant and are considered to be 
responsible for malignant growth, recurrence, dr ug-resistance, and metastasis. Moreover, CSCs 
are highly resistant to chemotherapies and cu rrent targeted agents. Accumulating evidence 
indicates that CSCs play a role in the pathogenesis of CRC [ Todaro 2010 ]. Cancer stem cells 
have been isolated from human colon carcinom as using various cell surface markers including 
CD133, CD44, CD24, CD29, CD166, Musashi-1, and Lgr5 [ Horst 2009; Du 2008; Levin 2010; 
Merlos-Suarez 2011; Kemper 2010 ]. These CSCs isolated from CRC patients display tumor-
initiating properties, as well as resistance to chemotherapeutics. These findings suggest that the 
development of cancer stem cell inhibitors re presents a novel strategy for the treatment of CRC. 
2.2. Napabucasin (BBI-608) 
Napabucasin (BBI-608) is a small molecule that is hypothesized to affect multiple oncogenic 
cellular pathways, including inhibition of the ST AT3 pathway which has been implicated in CSC 
viability.  It has the potential to treat CRC and other types of cancer by inhibiting self-renewal and survival of CSCs and inducing apoptosis in both CSCs and heteroge neous cancer cells. 
Recent studies have uncovered the presence of CSCs  (also called tumor in itiating cells) and have 
found them to have self-renewal capability whic h may contribute to malignant growth, relapse, 
and metastasis [ Clevers 2011; Zhou 2009; Schwartz-Cru z-y-Celis 2011; Chaffer 2011; Rasheed 
Study CanStem303C (Protocol Amendment 7.0)                    Amendment Date: 25 October 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL 
20 2011 ]. Isolation of CSCs has been reported in various major human cancer types, including 
breast, colon, prostate, melanoma, pancreatic, lung, head/neck, ovarian, glioblastoma 
multiforme, liver, esophageal, and hematological malignancy [ Clevers 2011; Zhou 2009; 
Schwartz-Cruz-y-Celis 2011; Gupta 2009; H annahan 2011; Gupta 2011; Boman Wicha 2008 ]. 
CSCs are resistant to conventional therapies, therefore, a targeted agent with activity against 
cancer stem cells is being explored [ Lobo 2007 ].  
Napabucasin (BBI-608) is hypothesized to inhibi t the STAT3 pathway. The signal transducers 
and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene  is an oncogene that belongs to a family of 
transcription factors activated in response to cytokines and/or growth factors to promote proliferation, survival, and other biological proc esses and is activated by phosphorylation of a 
critical tyrosine residue [ Darnell 2005 ]. Upon tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT3 forms homo-
dimers and translocates to the nucleus, binds to  specific DNA-response elements in target gene 
promoters, and induces gene expression [ Darnell 2005 ]. STAT3 activates certain genes involved 
in tumorigenesis, invasion, and metastasis, incl uding Bcl-xl, Akt, c-Myc, cyclin D1, VEGF, and 
survivin. The constitutive activation of STAT3 is frequently detected in primary human CRC cells and established human CRC cell lines [ Ma 2004; Corvinus 2005; Kusaba 2005 ], and 
elevated levels of pSTAT3 were correlated w ith the tumor invasion, nodal metastasis, and the 
stage (p<0.05) [ Ma 2004; Kusaba 2005 ]. Constitutive STAT3 activation in CRC cells is 
associated with invasion, survival, and growth of CRC cells and colorectal tumor model in mice 
in vivo  [Corvinus 2005; Lin 2005; Xiong 2008; Tsareva 2007 ]. These reports indicate that 
STAT3 is one of the oncogenic pathways activated in CRC and may serve as a therapeutic target. 
Data from CRC patients treated with napabucasin have indicated that pSTAT3 positivity may be 
a predictive biomarker for napabucasin treatment (and have also confirmed that pSTAT3 
positivity is a prognostic indicator of survival, as is cited in the scientific literature [ data 
available upon request ]). Several peer-reviewed scientific articles have established dysregulation 
of STAT3 signaling as a key feature of human CRC . Park et al [2008 ] showed that levels of 
activated STAT3 (pSTAT3) are significantly assoc iated with increasing T- and clinical stages in 
CRC. Kusaba et al [2005, 2006 ] correlated pSTAT3 levels with increasing T- and Duke’s stages 
and the presence of lymph vessel invasion and showed poor prognosis for OS in a first study of 
CRC, and with increasing T-stages and the presence of vein invasion and lymph node metastases in a second study of CRC. When a meta-analysis was performed combining data on 
gastrointestinal cancers, including gastric and co lorectal cancers, higher levels of pSTAT3 were 
shown to correlate with worsened overall patient survival [ Li 2015 ], signifying the role of 
pSTAT3 in cancer types throughout the gastrointesti nal system. Lastly, pSTAT3(+) is present in 
about 70% of colorectal carcinomas and approx imately 18% of colorectal adenomas [ de Jong 
2014 ]. 
2.2.1.  Safety Profile 
The predominant adverse drug reactions (ADRs) a ssociated with napabucasin are gastrointestinal 
in nature. Napabucasin treatment may result in  diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and 
decreased appetite (anorexia). Refer to the current Investigator Brochure (IB) for additional 
information on the safety profile of napabucasin.

21 2.2.2.  Napabucasin Monotherapy in Last Li ne Metastatic Colorectal Cancer 
Study CO.23 was a Phase 3 international, mu lticenter, randomized controlled trial of 
napabucasin monotherapy (480 mg PO BID) vs. placebo in refractory CRC patients. The primary 
endpoint for the CO.23 trial was OS. The key secondary endpoints include PFS, ORR, DCR, safety, and QoL. Exploratory endpoints include biomarker (pSTAT3) analyses.  
To be considered eligible, patients were requi red to have failed available standard therapy 
including 5-FU based regimens, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and EGFR inhibitor if KRAS wild type. The original planned sample size was 650 patients. Accrual was stopped after 282 patients were 
randomized following a pre-planned interim analysis based on DCR that met protocol-defined 
stopping criteria for futility. The study did not meet its primary objective. 
Final analysis was conducted after completion of  follow-up of the 282 patients. The demographic 
variables and known prognostic factors were ba lanced between the study arms. No significant 
differences were observed between the study arms in OS in the ITT population. Study results for primary and secondary endpoints are summarized in Table 1  (final clinical study report [CSR] is 
pending at the time of this Amendment). 

Of the 282 randomized patients, 251 patients provided diagnostic tumor samples for biomarker 
evaluation (evaluation was performed by blinded th ird party assessment). Of these 251 patients, 
55 were determined to be pSTAT3(+) and 167 were determined to be  pSTAT3(-) and were 
included in exploratory analyses ( Table 2 ); 29 patients had samples which were not evaluable. In 
concordance with the literature, presence of th e biomarker (pSTAT3(+)) was shown to be a 
negative prognostic factor in patients receiving placebo. In patients receiving napabucasin, 
prolonged OS was observed in pSTAT3(+) patients compared to pSTAT3(+) placebo patients, 
indicating a potential positive predictive effect. In pSTAT3(-) patients, OS was numerically 
smaller in patients randomized to napabucasin as compared to pSTAT3(-) patients randomized to 
placebo, but the difference is not clinically meaningful.  
Of note, the initial analysis of the correlation of biomarker status and clinical benefit [Jonker 
2018] included patients with non-evaluable tumor tissue with pSTAT3(-) patients by default. 
The analysis presented here corrects for this by removing those non-evaluable patients from the 
pSTAT3(-) group.

2.2.3.  Napabucasin in Combination with FOLFIRI for Colorectal Cancer 
BBI608-246 was a multi-arm Phase 1/2 clinical tria l of napabucasin in combination with several 
standard anti-cancer regimens for advanced gastrointestin al malignancies. The primary 
objectives of the study were to determine the safety, tolerability, PK characteristics, and 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of napabucasin  in combination with each of the backbone 
regimens. Secondary objectives were to evaluate  preliminary anti-tumor activity. Study accrual 
is complete, and analysis is ongoing.  
Patients were eligible if they had a gastrointes tinal malignancy that was re current, metastatic, or 
locally advanced, and if they were a candidate  for treatment with 1 of the following backbone 
regimens: FOLFOX6 (±bevacizumab), FOLFIRI  (±bevacizumab), CAPOX, irinotecan, or 
regorafenib. Patients were assigned to a backbone  regimen according to investigator assessment. 
The backbone regimen was administered in comb ination with napabucasin at a dose assigned 
according to the dose-escalation protocol. Once RP2D was identified, patients were dosed with 
either 240 mg twice-daily (480 mg total dail y) or 480 mg twice-daily (960 mg total daily), 
continuously, depending on th e assigned backbone cohort. 
One cohort included patients with advanced CRC who were administered napabucasin 240 mg 
twice daily (480 mg total daily) in combination with standard FOLFIRI (5-FU 400 mg/m
2 
intravenous bolus followed by 5-FU 1200 mg/m2/day continuous 48-hour intravenous infusion 
[total 2400 mg/m2] with leucovorin 400 mg/m2 and irinotecan 180 mg/m2 every 14 days). If 
indicated and assigned by the investigator, beva cizumab was given at 5 mg/kg intravenously 
every 14 days. In case of toxicity, dose adjustment of either napabucasin or FOLFIRI or bevacizumab was permitted. 
An analysis was performed on 82 patients in this cohort using safety and efficacy data available 
as of 01 September 2017. All patients had rece ived previous systemic therapy, 36 (44%) had 
received 1 prior regimen, 18 (2 2%) had received 2 prior regimens, and 28 (34%) had received 
3 or more prior systemic regimens. Additionall y, 34 (41%) patients had received prior treatment 
with FOLFIRI. A total of 16 (19.5%) patients achieved objective response per RECIST 1.1 
criteria, including 1 patient with complete response (CR) and 15 with partial response (PR). An 
additional 41 patients experienced stable diseas e (SD), and the DCR, proportion with CR, PR, or

24 2.3. Pre-clinical Rationale 
Refer to the current IB for a detailed summary of nonclinical data. 
2.4. Summary 
Napabucasin (BBI-608) at a dose of 240 mg BID (480 mg total daily) has been well tolerated as 
monotherapy and when combined with a standard regimen of FOLFIRI with or without 
bevacizumab. The clinical activity obse rved in Study CO.23 and Study BBI608-246, and the 
unmet medical need for additional effective therapies for patients with advanced CRC, provides 
a rationale for further clinical investigation. Study CanStem303C is designed to evaluate the role 
of napabucasin added to standard FOLFIRI (±bevac izumab) as second line therapy for advanced 
CRC.

25 3. TRIAL DESIGN 
This is an international multi-center, prospectiv e, open-label, randomized, adaptive design 
Phase 3 trial of BBI-608 plus standard bi-weekly FOLFIRI versus  standard bi-weekly FOLFIRI 
in patients previously treated for advanced meta static CRC. Addition of bevacizumab to the 
FOLFIRI regimen, per Investigator choice, is permissible. 
3.1. Stratification 
Patients will be stratified by: 
1. Geographical region (North America/Wes tern Europe/Australia, Japan/Korea vs. Rest of 
the World) 
2. Time to progression on first- line therapy (<6 months vs. ≥6 months from start of first line 
therapy) 
3. RAS mutation status (mutant vs. wild type)1 
4. Bevacizumab as part of study protocol treatment (yes vs. no) 
5. Location of the primary tumor (left colon vs. right colon)2 
1RAS mutant status refers to any known mutation in KRAS  or NRAS  mutations in exons 2, 3, and 4 resulting in 
decrease of response to anti-EGFR treatment. 
2Lesions proximal to the splenic flexure w ill be considered right colon and lesi ons at splenic flexure and distal to it 
will be considered left colon.  
3.2. Randomization 
Patients will be randomized according to a 1: 1 ratio using a permuted block randomization 
procedure to receive BBI-608 plus standard bi-weekly FOLFIRI or standard bi-weekly FOLFIRI. Addition of bevacizumab to the FOLFIRI regimen, per Investigator choice, will be permissible.

26 Patients will be randomized to 1 of the following 2 arms: 
Arm Agent(s) Dose and Route Duration 
1 BBI-608  240 mg orally 2 times daily1,2 Patients may continue to receive protocol 
therapy as long as they have not experienced 
any adverse events requiring permanent 
discontinuation of study medication and have not demonstrated disease progression based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. 
4,5 FOLFIRI Standard FOLFIRI IV, once every 
2 weeks3  
2 FOLFIRI Standard FOLFIRI IV, once every 
2 weeks3 
1 BBI-608 should be taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after a m eal, 2 times daily, with approximately 12 hours between doses. 
BBI-608 administration will begin 2 days prior to the FOLFIRI infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1. These 2 days are referred to 
as Run-in Day 1 and Run-in Day 2. The run-in day period may be extended by up to 3 additional calendar days. Run-in 
Day 1 should occur within 2 calendar days of patient randomization. 
2 Patients should be encouraged to maintain sufficient flui d intake while on protocol treatment, such as taking BBI- 608 with 
approximately 250 mL of fluid over the course of 30 minutes after the dose. 
3 Addition of bevacizumab to the FOLFIRI regimen, per Inves tigator choice, will be permissible. FOLFIRI chemotherapy 
infusion will start at least 2 hours following the first daily dose of BBI-608 and will be administered every 2 weeks. 
Irinotecan/leucovorin infusion will foll ow bevacizumab infusion in patients selected by the Investigator to receive standard 
dose of bevacizumab (5 mg/kg). Irinotecan 180 mg/m2 together with leucovorin 400 mg/m2 will be administered 
intravenously, over approximately 90 minutes and 2 hours, re spectively, starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1, following 
bevacizumab infusion or at least 2 hours following the first dose of BBI-608 if bevacizumab is not administered. 5-FU 
400 mg/m2 bolus will be administered intravenously immediately following irinotecan/leucovorin infusion, followed by 
5-FU 1200 mg/m2/day (total 2400 mg/m2) continuous infusion. This regimen will be repeated on Day 1 of every 14-day 
cycle. 
 4 If any component of FOLFIRI is discontinued due to toxicity or any other reason deemed appropriate by the clinical 
investigators, BBI-608 should be continued until another criterion for stopping treatment is met. If BBI- 608 is discontinued 
due to toxicity, FOLFIRI should be continued until another criterion for stopping treatment is met. 
5 If no other standard therapies are available at the t ime of disease progression based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, and the patient 
has not experienced any adverse events requiring permanent discontinuation, BBI-608 may be continued as monotherapy.

CRC. Patients will have failed treatment with 1 regimen containing a fluoropyrimidine and 
oxaliplatin with or without bevacizumab in th e metastatic setting. Selection of the most 
appropriate patient population and hypothesis for evaluating the significance of the treatment 
effect at the final analysis will be made based on the rules and hypothesis described in 
Section  13.5. 
4.1. Inclusion Criteria 
Questions about eligibility criteria should be addressed prior to randomization. 
The eligibility criteria for this study have be en carefully considered. Eligibility criteria are 
standards used to ensure that patients who en ter this study are medically appropriate candidates 
for this therapy, as well as to ensure that th e results of this study can be useful for making 
treatment decisions regarding other patients with similar diseases. 
Patients must fulfill all the following criteria to be eligible for admission to the study: 
4.1.1 Written, signed consent for trial participation must be obtained from the patient 
appropriately in accordance with applicable ICH guidelines and local and regulatory requirements prior to the performance of any study specific procedure.

4.1.3 Must have failed treatment with 1 regimen containing only a fluoropyrimidine and 
oxaliplatin with or without bevacizumab for metastatic disease. All patients must have 
received a minimum of 6 weeks of the first-line regimen that included oxaliplatin and a 
fluoropyrimidine with or without bevacizumab in  the same cycle. Treatment failure is 
defined as radiologic progression during or ≤6 months after the last dose of first-line 
therapy. 
No additional prior lines of therapy in the metastatic setting will be allowed. Patients who 
discontinued first-line therapy due to toxicity  may be enrolled for as long as progression 
occurred ≤6 months after the last dose of first-line therapy.  
Patients who show tumor progression while on maintenance therapy with a 
fluoropyrimidine with or without bevacizumab after prior fluoropyrimidine-oxaliplatin 
with or without bevacizumab i nduction therapy are eligible. 
Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic treatme nt is allowed as long as no more than 
2 prior systemic chemotherapy regimens were  administered with no more than 1 prior 
regimen permitted in the metastatic setting. Patients who received oxaliplatin/fluoropyrimidine-based neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy and have disease 
recurrence or progression >6 months from their last dose of neoadjuvant or adjuvant 
treatment (or >6 months from surgery if no ad juvant therapy was administered) will be 
required to receive fluoropyrimidine/oxa liplatin-based therapy with or without 
bevacizumab for metastatic disease. 
For participants with rectal cancer, sequential neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy will 
count as a single systemic regimen.

36 6. ENTRY/RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES 
6.1. Entry Procedures 
All randomizations will be done through the CanStem303C randomization and trial supply 
management (RTSM) system. Complete details regarding obtaining a password, accessing the system, and registering/randomizing patients will be provided at the time of study activation.  
All eligible patients enrolled on the study by the pa rticipating treatment center will be assigned a 
subject identification number which must be used on all documentation and correspondence. 
The following information will be required: 
x Patient’s date of birth (as allowed by local regulations) and age  
x Patient's initials (as allowed by local regulations)  
x Confirmation of the requirements listed in Section  4.1 and Section  4.2  
x Stratification factors  
6.2. Stratification 
The permuted block randomization procedure will  balance between treatment arms within each 
of the following stratification factors:  
x Geographical region (North America/Wester n Europe/Australia, Japan/Korea, vs rest of the 
world)  
x Time to progression from start of first line therapy (<6 months vs ≥6 months)  
x RAS mutation status (mutant vs wild type) 
x Bevacizumab as part of study protocol treatment (yes vs no) 
x Location of primary tumor (left colon vs right colon) 
6.3. Randomization 
Patients will be randomized 1:1 between the 2 treatment arms and the randomization will be 
provided electronically (via RTSM). 
Note: The validity of results of the trial depends  on the authenticity of, and the follow-up of, all 
patients entered into the trial. Under no ci rcumstances, therefore, may an allocated pati ent’s data 
be withdrawn prior to final analysis, unless the participant withdraws from  the trial and requests 
that data collection/submission cease from the point in time of withdrawal. 
All eligible patients randomized to the trial will be followed by the coordinating center. It is the 
responsibility of the physician in charge to satisfy himself or herself that the patient is indeed 
eligible before requesting randomization. 
All randomized patients are to be followed until death or until sites are informed by the study 
sponsor that further follow-up is no longer required.

37 7. TREATMENT PLAN 
Protocol treatment is to begin within 2 calendar days of patient randomization for patients 
randomized to Arm 1. Patients randomized to Arm 2 must begin protocol treatment within 
7 calendar days of randomization. 
7.1. Treatment Plan 
Palliative and supportive care for other disease-related symptoms and for toxicity associated with 
treatment is permitted for all patients on this trial. Details of interventions (e.g. medications such 
as antibiotics, analgesics, antihistamines, steroids, G-CSF, erythropoietin), procedures (e.g. 
paracentesis, thoracentesis), or blood products (e.g. blood cells, platelets, or fresh frozen plasma transfusions) should be recorded on the electronic case report forms (eCRFs). 
Addition of bevacizumab at the standard do se (5 mg/kg) to the FOLFIRI regimen, per 
Investigator choice, will be permissible. 
7.1.1.  Drug Administration 
One treatment cycle is defined as 14 days (2 we eks) with BBI-608 administered orally twice 
daily (with doses separated by approximately 12 hours), and standard FOLFIRI administered 
every other week (ie, once per cycle). BBI-608 ad ministration will begin 2 days prior to the 
irinotecan infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1 ( Table 4 ). These 2 days are referred to as Run-in Day 1  
and Run-in Day 2 . The run-in day  period may be extended by up to 3 additional calendar days. 
Addition of bevacizumab at the standard do se (5 mg/kg) to the FOLFIRI regimen, per 
Investigator choice, will be permissible.

(run-in day  period may be extended by up to 3 additional ca lendar days). These days are referred to as Run- in 
Day 1, Run-in Day 2, etc . Run-in Day 1 should occur within 2 calendar days of patient randomization on study 
Arm 1. 
2 Patients should be encouraged to main tain sufficient fluid intake while on protocol treatm ent, such as taking 
BBI-608 with approximately 250 mL of fluid over the course of 30 mi nutes after the dose. 
3 Addition of bevacizumab to the FOLFIRI regimen, pe r Investigator choice, will be permissible. FOLFIRI 
chemotherapy infusion will start at  least 2 hours following the first d aily dose of BBI-608 and will be 
administered every 2 weeks. If bevacizumab is added to the FOLFIRI regimen, be vacizumab infusion should 
start at least 2 hours following the first dose of BBI- 608 starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 and will be administered 
every 2 weeks. Irinotecan/leucovorin infusion will follow bevacizumab in fusion in patients  selected by the 
Investigator to receive standard dose of bevacizumab (5 mg/kg). Irinotecan 180 mg/m2 together with leucovorin 
400 mg/m2 will be administered intrav enously, over approximately 90 minu tes and 2 hours, respectively, 
starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1, following bevacizu mab infusion or at least 2 hours following th e first daily dose 
of BBI-608 if bevacizumab is not administered. 5-FU 400 mg/m2 bolus will be admini stered intravenously 
immediately following irinotecan/leucovori n infusion, followed by 5-FU 1200 mg/m2/day (total 2400 mg/m2) 
continuous infusion. This regimen will be repeated on Day 1 of every 14-day cycle.  
4 If any component of FOLFIRI is discontinued due to toxicity or any other reas on deemed appropriate by clinical 
investigators, BBI-608 should be continued until another criterion for stopping tr eatment is met. If BBI- 608 is 
discontinued due to toxicity, FO LFIRI should be continued until another criter ion for stopping treatment is met. 
5 If no other standard therapies are available at the time of disease progression based on  RECIST 1.1 criteria, and 
the patient has not experienced any adverse events requiring permanent discontinuation, BBI-608 may be 
continued in monotherapy. 
Patients will receive BBI-608 2 times daily, a pproximately 1 hour prior to or 2 hours after meals, 
with the first dose given in the morning and the second dose given approximately 12 hours later. 
Addition of bevacizumab to the FOLFIRI regimen, per Investigator choice, will be permissible. 
Starting on Cycle 1 Day 1, FOLFIRI chemotherapy i nfusion will start at least 2 hours following 
the first dose of BBI-608 and will be administered every 2 weeks. If bevacizumab is added to the 
FOLFIRI regimen, bevacizumab infusion should start at least 2 hours following the first dose of 
BBI-608 starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 and will be  administered every 2 weeks. Irinotecan 
180 mg/m2 together with leucovorin 400 mg/m2 will follow bevacizumab infusion in patients 
selected by the Investigator to receive standard dose of bevacizumab (5 mg/kg), and will be 
administered concurrently via approximately 90-minute and 2-hour infusions, respectively, 
starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1, following bevacizumab  infusion or at least 2 hours following the 
first daily dose of BBI-608 if bevacizumab is not administered. 5-FU 400 mg/m2 bolus will be 
administered intravenously immediately follo wing irinotecan/leucovorin infusion, followed by 
5-FU 1200 mg/m2/day (total 2400 mg/m2) continuous infusion for approximately 46 hours. This 
regimen will be repeated ev ery 14 days thereafter. FOLF IRI administration should proceed

39 according to the manufacturer’s inst ructions and local standard prac tice (with respect to 
pre-treatment laboratory evaluation, clinical a ssessment, pre-medication, and monitoring during 
and after the infusion). If site-specific FOLFIRI administration procedures with respect to timing 
diverge from the above administration instructi ons, prior Sponsor approval may be granted, as 
long as the total dose administered remains per protocol. 
For sites in Australia, Belgium, Japan, and the United States, it is permissible to replace 
leucovorin with levoleucovorin for the FOLFIRI regimen. In these countries only, 
levoleucovorin should be administered in accorda nce with local procedures in the event such 
replacement is used, and at the recommended dose of 200 mg/m2.  
If any component of the FOLFIRI regimen is permanently discontinued due to toxicity or any 
other reasons deemed appropriate by clinical investigators, BBI-608 and the residual components 
of medical therapy should be continued until anot her criterion for stopping treatment is met. If 
BBI-608 is permanently discontinued due to toxici ty, FOLFIRI should be continued until another 
criterion for stopping treatment is met. 
As BBI-608 may target cancer stem cells, it is po ssible that continued therapy after progressive 
disease per RECIST 1.1 may provide clinical benefit. If no other standard therapies are available 
at the time of disease progression  based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, and the patient has not 
experienced any AEs requiring permanent di scontinuation, BBI-608 may be continued in 
monotherapy. 
Handling instructions for BBI-608 will be provided to all sites. Investigators may refer to the 
current IB for detailed instructions. 
7.1.1.1.  BBI-608 Diarrhea Prophylaxis: 
It is strongly recommended that all patients hold their bowel regimen (fiber supplementation may 
be continued) starting 1 day prior to the firs t dose of BBI-608. Bowel regimen may be resumed 
as needed if constipation develops.  
Additionally, it is strongly recommended that all patients without constipation at 
screening/randomization start prophylactic anti-dia rrheals, such as Loperamide (Imodium®) 
2 mg orally (PO) twice daily or Diphenoxylate/Atropine (Lomotil®)  2.5 to 5 mg PO twice daily, 
starting 1 day prior to the first dose of BBI- 608 and continue with prophylaxis for the first 
4 weeks of study treatment with BBI-608. Anti-diarrheal prophylaxis should be held if 
constipation develops.  
7.1.2.  Blinding/Unblinding 
This is an open label study. The primary endpoint of this study is overall survival, the assessment 
of which is unlikely impacted by the open-label nature of the study.  
However, to comply with ICH E6 (R2) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (2016) 
recommending the blinded review of planned analyses 
[http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Sit e/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E6/E6_R2_
_Step_4_2016_1109.pdf ], and to minimize the risk of potential bias into interim and final analyses, a blinding plan was implemented by the Sponsor and by the CRO to maintain the 
integrity of the study data for the decision making at the interim and final analyses.

40 7.1.3.  Patient Monitoring 
For the duration that patients are on study therap y, AE monitoring will be done continuously. 
Patients will be evaluated for AEs at each visit and are to be instructed to call their physician to 
report any AEs between visits. 
7.1.4.  BBI-608 Dose Modification  
The major AEs associated with the use of BBI-608 are gastrointestinal events (nausea, diarrhea, 
and abdominal cramping) and fatigue. Fatigue is  often secondary to gastrointestinal events. 
There is no hematologic toxicity associated with BBI-608. We recommend that pre-exiting laxative bowel regimens, such as stool softeners,  be held starting the day prior to first dose of 
study treatment and may be resumed in cases of no bowel movement during the first 2 days of 
protocol treatment. Fiber supplementation may be continued. Additionally, prophylactic anti-
diarrheal medications, such as Imodium and/or Lo motil, starting 1 day prior to start of BBI-608 
are strongly recommended for all patients. 
The guidelines which follow outline dosing m odifications and recommended interventions 
should the above AEs occur.  
Adverse events will be graded using the NC I Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 4.0 (see Appendix 4 ). If a patient experiences several AEs and there are 
conflicting recommendations, please use the recomm ended dose adjustment that reduces the dose 
to the lowest level.

7.1.4.3.  Other Situations 
Change in Urine Color and Odor: 
Occasionally, subjects have reported an orange-brown color change to their urine. Rarely, 
subjects also report a new odor to their urine.  All subjects should be made aware of the 
possibility of these effects. For the reported  AEs of chromaturia in patients receiving 
BBI-608 + paclitaxel, the majority were recovered/resolved. Dosing can be continued in the presence of these events. 
7.1.5.  FOLFIRI Dose Modification 
Dose modifications for hematologic and non-hem atologic toxicities (using NCI CTCAE Version 
4.0) expected from FOLFIRI should be performed  according to the recommendations outlined in 
Table 8 . Dose modifications for non-gastrointestinal toxicities expected from FOLFIRI may also 
follow institutional guidelines. Any toxicity requiring dose level modi fication beyond the second 
dose modification for fluorouracil or irinotecan ma y require treatment discontinuation or further 
modification at the discretion of the Investig ator. When a dose reduction is required, no dose 
re-escalation will be permitted for the duration of study treatment.

Neupogen/G-CSF may be used at the discretion of the Investigator prior to each dose of 
FOLFIRI and administration should proceed acco rding to standard guidelines (NCCN/ASCO). 
Patients not experiencing resolution of neutropenia within 4 weeks at any time during the cycle, may discontinue FOLFIRI treatment. 
Prior to each dose of FOLFIRI, the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet count should be 
evaluated. If abnormalities are observed, and in the opinion of the Investigator the myelosuppression is most likely a result of FO LFIRI therapy, dose modification is recommended 
as in Table 9 .

Day 1 of the subsequent study cycle. 
If a toxicity is thought by the Investigator to be related to both BBI-608 and FOLFIRI, then the 
dose modification rules for both trea tment regimens should be followed. 
If any or all components of FOLFIRI is/are held or discontinued for toxicities solely related to 
FOLFIRI, BBI-608 therapy should be continued. 
If BBI-608 is permanently discontinued due to toxicity, FOLFIRI therapy should be continued.

All information regarding concomitant treatments (medications or procedures) must be recorded 
on the patient’s eCRF (including the name of the medi cation or procedure and duration of 
treatment).  
Palliative and supportive care is permitted for disease-related symptoms for all patients.  
Study CanStem303C (Protocol Amendment 7.0)                    Amendment Date: 25 October 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL 
46 All palliative and supportive care measures may be administered to patients in either study arm 
at the Investigator’s discretion. Incident palliativ e radiotherapy is permitted in both study arms 
while on study, but requirement of radiation to the target lesion(s) will qualify the patient as having disease progression. 
Overall, CYP isoenzymes have an insignificant  role in the biotransformation of napabucasin. The 
CYP P450 isoform 1A2 is the predominant isoform involved in the drug’s metabolism. Although 
the following drugs are permitted while on study treatment, all reasonable measures should be 
done to avoid use of drugs that are strong inhibitors or sensitive substrates of CYP1A2 unless 
there is medical necessity for their use.  
Strong CYP1A2 inhibitors include:  
x Ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones 
x Fluvoxamine 
x Enoxacin 
x Zafirlukast 
Investigators may refer to the curren t BBI-608 IB for additional information.  
Patients who require use of concomitant medications metabolized by the CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C19, 
3A4, and 2C9 enzymes should be monitored, as per drug product label, as use of BBI-608 can 
inhibit the abovementioned CYP enzymes leading to increased drug concentrations of the enzyme metabolites. 
Patients who develop surgically resectable dise ase with curative intent during study treatment, 
must hold BBI-608 midnight prior to morni ng of surgery. FOLFIRI (with or without 
bevacizumab) components should be held accordi ng to the product labels and institutional 
standards. Following surgical recovery, patients should resume BBI-608 with resumption of oral 
intake. The decision to resume FOLFIRI following surgery and the timing of FOLFIRI resumption will be made by the Investigator depend ing on surgical and clinical factors. Patients 
randomized to either study arm, who discontinue FOLFIRI following surgical resection, will 
continue study visits once per month (an exte nded 28-day cycle) for safety assessments. 
Although intravenous bisphosphonate use is permit ted for patients rece iving bevacizumab, per 
Investigator choice, while on study treatment, all reasonable measures should be done to avoid 
the use of intravenous bisphosphonates simultane ously or sequentially with bevacizumab in 
order to mitigate the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). Patients who have received 
intravenous bisphosphonates prior to treatment with  bevacizumab are also at increased risk of 
ONJ and should be specifically counseled rega rding this risk. Additionally, invasive dental 
procedures while the patient is receiving bevacizumab treatment also increases the risk of ONJ. 
As such, it is advised that patients receiving bevacizumab undergo a dental examination and 
appropriate preventive dentistry prior to start of treatment with bevacizumab. 
7.1.6.2.  Non-Permitted Treatments 
Concurrent chemotherapy, hormonal therapy (e xcept corticosteroids), immunotherapy, biologic 
therapy, or any other experimental agents should not be given to study patients while on protocol 
treatment.

47 7.1.7.  Duration of Therapy 
Patients may continue to receive  protocol therapy as long as they have not experienced any AEs 
requiring permanent discontinuation of protocol tr eatment and have not demonstrated disease 
progression based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. For de tails concerning toxicity, please consult 
Section  7.1.4  and Section  7.1.5  . For a complete list of general criteria for stopping study 
treatment, please see Section  11.  
7.1.8.  Patient Compliance 
Treatment compliance for BBI-608 is defined as  the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the 
number of capsules (BBI-608) taken by a patient ove r the course of a time interval to the number 
of capsules intended to be taken over that same time interval.  
Treatment compliance for FOLFIRI is defined as the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the 
amount of each of the component drugs ad ministered to a patient (milligrams/m2) over the course 
of a time interval to amount of the component IV  drug intended to be administered over that 
same time interval.  
Treatment compliance in both arms will be m onitored by drug accountability, as well as the 
monitoring of patient-reported compliance.

52 9. CRITERIA FOR MEASUREMENT OF STUDY ENDPOINTS 
9.1. Definitions 
9.1.1.  Evaluable for Adverse Events 
All patients who have received at least 1 dose of study drug (BBI-608 or FOLFIRI) will be 
evaluable for AEs from the time of their first dose of BBI-608. 
9.1.2.  Evaluable for Overall Survival  
All randomized patients will be included in th e analysis of OS, which is defined as the time 
interval between the date of randomization and the date of death from any cause. Patients who 
are still alive at the time of the final analysis, or who have become lost to follow-up will be 
censored at their last date known to be alive.  
9.1.3.  Evaluable for Progression Free Survival  
All randomized patients will be included in the analysis of PFS, which is defined as the time 
interval between the date of randomization and the date of objective disease progression or 
death, whichever comes first. If neither event has been observed, then the patient will be 
censored at the date of the last tumor assessment. 
Disease progression is defined as objective progression per RECIST 1.1 [Eisenhauer 2009] . It is 
required to perform, whenever possible, a radiological confirmation of the clinical suspicion of 
tumor progression. In the situation where there is clinical suspicion of progression, but objective 
progression cannot be determined per RECIST 1.1, di sease is defined as cl inical deterioration 
without objective evidence of progression.  
The date of disease progression is defined as the date when the criteria for objective progression 
are first met.  
9.1.4.  Evaluable for Objective Response Rate  
Patients with measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 at randomization will be included in the 
analysis of ORR which is defined as a composite of PR and CR as classified according to the definitions set out in Section  9.2.5  [Eisenhauer 2009].  For patients who discontinue protocol 
therapy prior to their first objective assessment of  response, it is imperative that an objective 
response assessment be undertaken as close to the protocol specified schedule as possible. 
9.1.5.  Evaluable for Disease Control Rate   
Patients who have measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 at randomization will be included in the 
analysis of DCR which is defined as a composit e of SD, PR, and CR as classified according to 
the definitions set out in Section  9.2.5  [Eisenhauer 2009] . For patients who discontinue protocol 
therapy prior to their first objective assessment of  response, it is imperative that an objective 
response assessment be undertaken as close to the protocol specified schedule as possible.

CONFIDENTIAL 
53 9.1.6.  Evaluable for Quality of Life Assessment 
All patients who have completed the baseline qua lity of life questionnaire and at least 1 other 
QoL questionnaire are evaluable ( Appendix 5 ). 
9.1.7.  pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation, the pSTAT3(-) Subpopulation and 
pSTAT3(Unknown) Subpopulation 
The pSTAT3 subpopulations will be defined by the results of a Clinical Trial Assay (CTA) for a 
specimen with an age within a defined cut-sect ion stability (CSS) window (6 months at interim 
analysis or the final CSS window at final analysis ).  Specimen age is defined as the time interval 
between the sectioning and st aining of the specimen.  
A patient with positive pSTAT3 status within a defined CSS window is the one with pSTAT3 
positive designated by CTA with specimen age up to 6 months at interim analysis or up to the 
final CSS window at final analysis.   
A patient with negative pSTAT3 status within a defined CSS window is the one with pSTAT3 
negative designated by CTA with specimen age up to  6 months at interim analysis or up to final 
CSS window at final analysis.   
A patient with pSTAT3 status unknown within a defined CSS window will include patients with  
specimen was not submitted for testing, if th e specimen is identified as non-evaluable upon 
pathology evaluation, if the specim en age is out of the defined CSS window, or if missing due to 
any other reasons.  
Evolving knowledge of Cut-Section Stability (CSS)  for pSTAT3 Biomarker Assay 
 
The pSTAT3 IHC D3A7 CTA was used for this study to identify the pSTAT3(+) patient population. This 
biomarker assay is an immunohistochemistry-based method intended for use in detection of pSTAT3 
protein in cut tissue sections. A cut-section stability (CSS) study is ongoing to establish the final pSTAT3 
CSS window which is expected to be completed prior to the final analysis.   
At the time of the interim analysis in the CanStem303C study, preliminary assessments from the ongoing 
CSS study were indicative of a stability of at least 6 months for slides stored at -20 degrees Celsius, the 
same manner in which CanStem303C specimens have been stored.  The interim analysis, therefore, 
included pSTAT3 biomarker status results for only th ose patients with specimens age up to a CSS of 6 
months.  
However, after the interim analysis in the CanSte m303C study, the biomarker data monitoring from the 
ongoing CSS study indicates that samples will likely remain stable at -20 degrees Celsius for greater than 
6 months.  This indicates that the final CSS window c ould be longer than 6 months and up to 15 months.  
As a result of evolving knowledge of CSS window, a patient with unknown pSTAT3 status that was due to 
a specimen out of the 6-month CSS window may have a pSTAT3 positive or negative status at the final 
analysis. Therefore, it is expected that will be fe wer patients with unknown pSTAT3 status within the final 
CSS window at the final analysis compared to the interim analysis with 6 month CSS window.  
 Figure 1  below shows the pSTAT3 subpopulations components at the interim and final analysis.

Note:  All specimens will be tested only one tim e regardless of final stability window.   
9.2. Response and Evaluation Endpoints 
Response and progression will be evaluated in th is study using the revised international criteria 
(1.1) proposed by the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) committee. 
9.2.1.  Measurable Disease 
Measurable tumor lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least 
1 dimension (longest diame ter to be recorded) as ≥20 mm with chest X-ray and as ≥10 mm with 
CT scan, or clinical examination. Bone lesions ar e considered measurable only if assessed by CT 
scan and have an identifiable soft tissue component that meets these requirements (soft tissue 
component ≥10 mm by CT scan). Malignant lymph nodes must be ≥15mm in the short axis to be 
considered measurable; only the short axis will be measured and followed. All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters ( or decimal fractions of centimeters). Previously 
irradiated lesions are not considered measurabl e unless progression has been documented in the 
lesion. 
9.2.2.  Non-measurable Disease 
All other lesions (or sites of disease), includi ng small lesions are considered non-measurable 
disease. Bone lesions without a measurable soft tissue component, leptomeningeal disease, 
ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangiti s cutis/pulmonis, infla mmatory breast disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of lung or skin and abdominal masses followed by clinical 
examination are all non-measurable. Lesions in previously irradiated areas are non-measurable, 
unless progression has been demonstrated.

CONFIDENTIAL 
55 9.2.3.  Target Lesions 
When more than 1 measurable tumor lesion is pre sent at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of 
5 lesions total (and a maximum of 2 lesions pe r organ) representative of all involved organs 
should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline. Target 
lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. Note that pathological nodes must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥15 mm by CT scan and only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the 
baseline sum. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10 mm, but <15 mm) should 
be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that ha ve a short axis <10 mm are considered non-
pathological and should not be recorded or followed (see Section  9.2.4 ). At baseline, the sum of 
the target lesions (longest diameter of tumor le sions plus short axis of lymph nodes: overall 
maximum of 5) is to be recorded. 
After baseline, a value should be  provided on the CRF for all identified target lesions for each 
assessment, even if very small. If extremely small and faint lesions cannot be accurately 
measured but are deemed to be present, a default value of 5 mm may be used. If lesions are too small to measure and indeed are believed to be absent, a default value of 0 mm may be used. 
9.2.4.  Non-target Lesions  
All non-measurable lesions (or sites of disease) plus any measurable lesions over and above 
those listed as target lesions are considered non-target lesions. Measur ements are not required 
but these lesions should be noted at baseline and should be followed as “present” or “absent”.  
9.2.5.  Response 
All patients will have their BEST RESPONSE fr om the start of study treatment until the end of 
treatment classified as outlined below: 
Complete Response (CR): disappearance of targe t and non-target. Pathological lymph nodes 
must have short axis measures <10 mm (Note: continue to record the measurement even if 
<10 mm and considered CR). Residual lesi ons (other than nodes <10 mm) thought to be 
non-malignant should be further investigated (by cytology specialized imaging or other 
techniques as appropriate for individual cases [Eisenhauer 2009] ) before CR can be accepted.  
Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of measures (longest diameter for 
tumor lesions and short axis measure for nodes) of  target lesions, taking as reference the baseline 
sum of diameters. Non-target lesions must be non-PD.  
Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinka ge to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters on study. 
Progressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increas e in the sum of diameters of measured lesions 
taking as references the smallest sum of diameters recorded on study (including baseline) AND 
an absolute increase of ≥5mm. Appearance of new lesions will also constitute PD (including 
lesions in previously unassessed areas). In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression of non-target disease may be accepted as evid ence of disease progression, where the overall 
tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of treatm ent or where the tumor 
burden appears to have increased by at least 73% in  volume. Modest increases in the size of one

CONFIDENTIAL 
56 or more non-target lesions are NOT considered unequivocal progression. If the evidence of PD is 
equivocal (target or non-target), treatment may continue until the next assessment, but if 
confirmed, the earlier date must be used.

Note:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status  requiring discontinuation of treatment without radiological 
progression having been observed at that time should be reported as “symptomatic de terioration”. This is NOT objective 
PD. Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 
9.3. Response Duration 
Response duration will be measured from the time measurement criteria for CR/PR (whichever 
is first recorded) are first met until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is 
objectively documented, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded on study (including baseline). 
9.4. Stable Disease Duration 
Stable disease duration will be measured from the time of randomization until the criteria for 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (including baseline). 
9.5. Methods of Measurement 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Assessments should be identified 
on a calendar schedule and should not be affected by delays in therapy. While on study, all 
Study CanStem303C (Protocol Amendment 7.0)                    Amendment Date: 25 October 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL 
58 lesions recorded at baseline s hould have their actual measurement s recorded at each subsequent 
evaluation, even when very small (e.g. 2 mm). If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion 
has likely disappeared, the measurement should be re corded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to 
be present and is faintly seen, but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be 
assigned. For lesions which fragment/split add t ogether the longest diameters of the fragmented 
portions; for lesions which coalesce, measure the maximal longest diameter for the “merged 
lesion. ” 
Additionally, for optimal tumor assessment scanning options are listed below in the decreasing 
order of preference: 
Order of Preference Scanning Option 
1 Chest-Abdomen-Pelvis CT with oral and IV contrast 
2 Chest CT without IV contrast PLUS MRI Abdomen-Pelvis with oral and IV 
contrast1 
3 Chest-Abdomen-Pelvis CT with oral contrast2 
1If Iodine contrast media is  medically contraindicated. 
2If Iodine contrast media is  medically contraindicated and MRI cannot be performed. 
9.5.1.  Clinical Lesions 
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and >10 mm as 
assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color 
photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommended. If feasible, imaging is preferred.  
9.5.2.  Chest X-ray  
Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when progression is an important endpoint, 
since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particul arly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions 
>20 mm on chest X-ray may be considered mea surable if they are clearly defined and 
surrounded by aerated lung.  
9.5.3.  CT/MRI  
CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for 
response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on 
the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measura ble lesion should be twice the slice thickness. 
MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans). Other specialized imaging or 
other techniques may also be appropriate for individual case [ Eisenhauer 2009 ]. For example, 
while PET scans are not considered adequate to  measure lesions, PET-CT scans may be used 
providing that the measures are obtained from the CT scan and the CT scan is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast).

59 9.5.4.  Ultrasound  
Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of 
measurement. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation 
by CT is advised. 
9.5.5.  Endoscopy/Laparoscopy  
The utilization of these techniques for objectiv e tumor evaluation is not advised. However, they 
can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to 
determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response or surgical resection is 
an endpoint.  
9.5.6.  Cytology/Histology.  
These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (for example, 
residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic ori gin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.

60 10. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be utilized for adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event 
(SAE) reporting (version can be found in Appendix 4 ).  
All appropriate treatment areas should have a ccess to a copy of the CTCAE. A copy of the 
CTCAE can be downloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) web site: 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopmen t/electronic_applications/ctc.htm). 
All SAEs defined per ICH guidelines ( Section  10.1) and other AEs must be recorded on the 
eCRFs. All SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours ( Section  10.2).  
10.1. Definition of a Protocol Reportable Serious Adverse Event 
All SAEs must be reported in an expedited manner (see Section  10.2 for reporting instructions). 
These include events occurring from the time the patient signs consent until 30 days after last 
protocol treatment administration. Determination of relationship between the event and study drug should be made by a qualified physician investigator.  
An SAE is an AE that at any dose: 
x Results in death 
x Is life-threatening 
x Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongati on of existing hospitalization (excluding 
hospital admissions for study  drug administration) 
x Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
x Is an important medical event 
Note: clinically significant test results should be recorded on the AE CRF using the appropriate 
CTCAE description and grading scale. 
10.2. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Instructions 
SAE reporting will commence following the signature of the informed consent and continue for 
30 days following the last dose of protocol trea tment. Any SAE occurring following patient 
signature of informed consent and prior to patient randomization must be submitted to the 
Sponsor for review and response prior to patien t randomization and/or study drug administration, 
even if the patient completely recovered from the SAE. Additionally, any SAE occurring at any 
time following administration of the final dose of protocol treatment that is suspected to be 
related to study treatment must be reported. 
All SAEs ( Section 10.1 ) must be reported using the SAE Report Form for this trial. 
Within 24 hours: Submit Initial Serious Adverse Event Report  
Within 7 days: Submit Follow-up Serious Adverse Event Report updated with as much 
detail as possible.

CONFIDENTIAL 
61 Detailed instructions for the submission of SAE Reports will be provided separately. 
10.3. Procedures in Case of an Overdose 
Use of BBI-608 in doses in excess of that specified in the protocol should be reported in the 
following manner: 
If an AE (s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of BBI -608, the overdose and AE are 
reported on the SAE Report Form, even if no other criteria for seriousness are met. The SAE 
Report Form should be submitted within 24 hours. The overdose should also be recorded on the relevant AE form in the eCRF using the term “accidental or intentional overdose with adverse effect.”  
If the overdose of BBI-608 is not associated with an AE, the overdose is reported as a non-
serious AE, on the relevant AE form in the eCRF within 24 hours, using the event term 
“accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” The clinical research associate 
responsible for the investigational center should also be notified of the event within 24 hours. 
Investigators/site personnel are to consult the local, approved product labels for each of the 
components of the FOLFIRI treatment regimen for guidance on the definition of an overdose of 
components of this regimen as well as for gu idance on reporting of any AE or SAE associated 
with overdose of any of the FOLFIRI components. Overdose of FOLFIRI should also be reported to the Sponsor in accordance with overdose reporting guidelines in Section  10.3). 
10.4. Other Protocol Reportable Events – Pregnancy/Exposure Reporting 
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) may be enrolled in this clinical trial. WOCBP are 
defined as women who have had a menstrual pe riod during the last year and have not had a 
hysterectomy. Precautions are required to be take n to prevent pregnancy during the clinical trial 
when the research population includes WOCBP. Th is includes pregnancy testing, use of effective 
methods of birth control, and pregnancy as an exclusion factor. The trial sample informed consent form includes the potential for unidentified risks to the embryo/fetus.  It also includes 
general information on pregnancy prevention and the required minimum period during which 
birth control must be utilized.  
10.4.1.  Pregnancy Prevention 
WOCBP and males who are enrolled in the trial must be informed of the requirement to use 
contraception as outlined in the eligibility criteria ( Section  4.1). Investigators are advised to 
inform the female partners of male participants  when appropriate and compliant with local 
policy.  
A highly effective method of birth control is defined as those which result in a failure rate of 
<1% per year when used consistently and correctly. 
10.4.2.  Pregnancy Occurring in WOCBP Exposed to Study Agent 
Any female participant who becomes pregnant dur ing the course of the trial should be instructed 
to stop taking study medication immediately.

CONFIDENTIAL 
62 The Investigator should provide counselling and discuss the risks and possible side effects to the 
embryo/fetus from BBI-608 and FOLFIRI. Monitoring should continue until conclusion of the 
pregnancy. The same should occur for female part ners of a male participant, or any female 
exposed to BBI-608 when appropriate and compliant with local policy. 
10.4.3.  Pregnancy/Exposure Reporting 
The Investigator is required to report to the Sponsor any pregnancy where the embryo/fetus 
could have been exposed to BBI-608. This include s pregnancies occurring in female participants, 
female partners of male participants, or females exposed through direct contact with the agent 
during their pregnancy (for example, environmenta l exposure involving direct contact with the 
agent). Pregnancies occurring until 30 days in female patients and until 90 days in partners of male patients, after the comple tion of BBI-608 must also be reported as well as pregnancies 
occurring until 180 days of the final FOLFIRI dose for female and male patients. 
The Investigator is required to inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy 
using the SAE reporting form appr opriate for the trial as indicated above. In the Adverse Event 
column please enter the following: “pregnancy, puerperium a nd perinatal conditions –  other, 
specify” (fetal exposure). Please note that the patient identification number must correspond to 
the participant in the main trial. Specifically, in the case of pregnancy in the female partner of a 
male participant, the male pa rticipant’s patient identification number should be used for 
reporting purposes.  
The SAE form must be updated to reflect the outcome of the pregnancy. For example: 
x “pregnancy, puerperium , and perinatal conditions – other, spec ify” (normal live birth),  
x “pregnancy, puerperium , and perinatal conditions – other, specify” (therapeutic abortion), or  
x another term under "pregnancy, puerperium,  and perinatal conditions" as applicable. 
Information on the medical history of the parents that may relate to assessing any potential fetal 
outcomes is requested, as is information on the h ealth of the newborn. The narrative section of 
the SAE form should be used to communicate all relevant information pertaining to the pregnancy. 
10.5. Responsibility for Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory 
Agencies 
Boston Biomedical, or the delegated CRO, will provide expedited reports of SAEs to FDA and 
other applicable regulatory authorities, for those events which meet regulatory requirements for 
expedited reporting, i.e. events which are BOTH serious AND unexpected, AND which are 
related to BBI-608 (suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction [SUSAR]): 
x Unexpected  AEs are those which are not consistent in either nature or severity with 
the reference safety i nformation contained in the Investigator’s Brochure  
x AEs considered related  to protocol treatment  are those events which have a 
reasonable possibility of being related to BBI-608.  
Boston Biomedical will determine which SA Es meet the criteria for regulatory reporting.

63 10.6. Reporting Safety Reports to Investigators 
Boston Biomedical, or the delegated CRO, will notify Investigators of all Safety Reports (SAEs) 
from this trial and Safety Updates from other clinical trials that are reportable to regulatory 
authorities. This includes all SAEs that are unexpected and related (i.e. possibly, probably, or definitely) to protocol treatment.

64 11. PROTOCOL TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION AND 
THERAPY AFTER STOPPING 
11.1. Criteria for Discontinuing Protocol Treatment 
Patients should stop protocol treatment in the following instances: 
x Progressive Disease (see Section  9.2.5 ). 
x Pregnancy 
x Intercurrent illness which would, in the judgement of the Investigator, affect assessments of 
clinical status to a significant degree, a nd require discontinuation of protocol therapy 
x Unacceptable toxicity 
x Request by the patient 
If a patient discontinues protocol treatment fo r a reason other than objective progression, every 
effort should be made to obtain tumor eval uations on the same schedule until progression is 
observed. 
Efforts should be made to maintain the investigat ions schedule and continue follow-up, even if 
patients discontinue protocol treatment premat urely and/or no longer attend the participating 
institution.  
11.2. Duration of Protocol Treatment  
Patients may continue to receive  protocol therapy as long as th ey have not experienced any AEs 
requiring permanent discontinuation of study med ication and have not demonstrated disease 
progression based on RECIST criteria. 
As BBI-608 targets cancer stem cells, it is possible that continued therapy after PD per 
RECIST 1.1 may provide clinical benefit. If no other standard therapies are available at the time of disease progression based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, and the patient has not experienced any AEs requiring permanent discontinuation, BBI-608 may be continued in monotherapy. 
11.3. Therapy After Protocol Treatment is Stopped 
Treatment after all protocol therapy has been disc ontinued is at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Information on post-study anti-cancer treatment will be collected in this study. 
11.4. Follow-up Off Protocol Treatment 
Follow-up will continue after treatment co mpletion according to the plan described in the 
protocol (see Section  8.2). Efforts should be made to maintain the investigations schedule and 
continue follow-up, even if patients discontinue  protocol treatment prematurely and/or no longer 
attend the participating institution.

65 12. CENTRAL REVIEW PROCEDURES, TISSUE COLLECTION, 
AND CORRELATIVE STUDIES 
12.1. Central Radiology Review 
There will be no central radiology review for this study. 
12.2. Central Pathology Review 
Archival tumor tissue samples will be sent a ce ntral pathology laboratory for testing for pSTAT3 
status. Tissue Collection 
12.2.1.  Protocol-Mandated Biomarker Analyses 
The submission of a representative diagnostic tumor tissue for the biomarker and a blood sample 
for correlative studies is mandatory for participation in this trial. Where local center regulations prohibit submission of blocks of tumor tissue, two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block and 
10 to 30 unstained slides of representative tumor tissue are requested. Where two 2 mm cores of 
tumor from the block are not available, 10 to 30 unstained slides of whole sections of representative tumor tissue are requested. The biomarker tissue samples will be analyzed with 
the pSTAT3 IHC prototype assay as an investig ational use only (IUO). Once the market-ready 
assay (MRA) is available, all patient samples will  be re-analyzed to confirm the results using the 
prototype assay. Where no previously resected or  biopsied tumor tissue exists, on the approval of 
the Sponsor/designated CRO, the patient may stil l be considered eligible for the study. 
After patient consent, blood samp le and paraffin tumor blocks will be the preferred tissue 
material to collect. If tumor blocks are unavailab le, then two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block 
and 10 to 30 specimen slides are preferred. If two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block are not 
available, 10 to 30 unstained slides of whole sections of representative tumor tissue are acceptable. If, at any time, the submitting hospital requires the block to be returned for medical or legal concerns, it will be re turned by courier on request. 
Samples may also be used for research purposes but will not be sold. Patients will not be 
identified by name. Patient samples will be blinded, and the only id entification of tissue will be 
by a patient study number assigned at the time of randomization to the trial.  
Testing for hereditary genetic defe cts predisposing to malignant disease will not be carried out 
without the expressed consent of the patient.  
All patients for whom a blood sample and/or diagnostic tumor block is collected will be aware of 
this retrieval and must have given their consent. 
12.3. Sparse Pharmacokinetic Plasma Sample Collection (Arm 1 Only) 
Plasma samples for sparse pharmacokinetics (PK)  analysis will be obtained from all patients 
randomized to Arm 1 (BBI-608 with FOLFIRI) at the study visits occurring on Day 1 of Cycle 2 
and Day 1 of Cycle 3 (corresponding to FOLFIRI infusion days). Patients randomized to Arm 2 (FOLFIRI) will not undergo plasma collection for PK analysis.

66 Day 1 (Cycle 2) Study Visit: 
The Day 1 (Cycle 2) visit should be scheduled prio r to 10 AM. On the day of this visit, patients 
should be instructed to wait to take their first daily dose of BBI-608 until they arrive in clinic. After arrival in the clinic, but approximately 5 minutes prior to administration of the first daily 
dose of BBI-608, a plasma sample will be obtain ed. Irinotecan infusion will be started 
immediately following bevacizumab infusion (for  patients who will receive bevacizumab 
together with FOLFIRI per investigator de cision) or approximately 2 hours after BBI-608 
administration if bevacizumab is  not administered. A second plasma sample will be obtained 
within 1 to 4 hours after administrati on of the first daily dose of BBI-608.  
Day 1 (Cycle 3) Study Visit: 
The Day 1 (Cycle 3) visit should be scheduled prio r to 10 AM. On the day of this visit, patients 
should be instructed to wait to take their first daily dose of BBI-608 until they arrive in clinic. 
After arrival in the clinic, but at least 60 minutes prior to administration of the first daily dose of 
BBI-608, a plasma sample will be obtained. Irinotecan infusion will be started immediately 
following bevacizumab infusion (for patients who will receive bevacizumab together with FOLFIRI per investigator decision) or approximat ely 2 hours after BBI-608 administration if 
bevacizumab is not administered. A second plasma sample will be obtained within 5 to 8 hours 
after administration of the first daily dose of BBI-608.  
For all days during which a plasma sample is obtained for PK analysis, the precise time of all 
doses of BBI-608 (on the day of sampling and the day prior), the precise time of the initiation of 
irinotecan administration, and the precise time of all PK sampling must be captured.  
Samples will be processed, stored, and shippe d according to the instructions provided in the 
separate Sparse PK sampling laboratory manual for this study.

67 13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analys es of the data collected in this study will 
be documented in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be maintained by the Sponsor. The 
SAP may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.  
13.1. Objectives and Design 
The primary objectives of this study are to co mpare OS of patients with metastatic pretreated 
CRC treated with BBI-608 plus biweekly FOLFIRI (Arm 1) versus biweekly FOLFIRI (Arm 2) 
in the General Population and in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation. 
Secondary objectives for this study include comparisons of PFS in the General Population and in 
the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation, Objective Response Rate in the General Population and in the 
pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation, Disease Control Rate in the General Population and in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation, Quality of Life Assessment in the General Population and in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation, and adverse ev ents in the 2 treatment arms. 
This is a multi-center, prospective, open-label,  randomized, adaptive de sign Phase 3 trial of the 
cancer stem cell pathway inhibitor BBI-608 plus  standard bi-weekly FOLFIRI (Arm 1) versus 
standard bi-weekly FOLFIRI (Arm 2) in patients with previously treated mCRC. Patients will be 
randomized to receive either BBI-608 plus standa rd bi-weekly FOLFIRI, (Arm 1) or standard bi-
weekly FOLFIRI (Arm 2) in a 1:1 ratio and w ill be stratified by geographical region (North 
America/Western Europe/Australia, Japan/Korea, versus  rest of the world), time to progression 
from start of first line therapy (<6 months versus  ≥6 months), RAS mutation status (mutant 
versus  wild type), bevacizumab as part of protocol treatment (yes versus  no), and location of the 
primary tumor (left colon versus  right colon). Addition of bevacizumab to the FOLFIRI regimen, 
per Investigator choice, will be permissible. 
13.2. Study Endpoints and Analysis 
13.2.1.  Primary Endpoint for the Study 
Overall Survival in the General Population and pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation 
Overall survival in the General Population and the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation, the primary 
endpoints of this study, are defined as the time fr om randomization to death from any cause. 
Patients who are alive at the time of the interim or  the final analyses or who have become lost to 
follow-up will be censored on the date the patient was last known to be alive. Patients will be 
analyzed in the arm to which they are randomized regardless of the treatment they received (intent-to-treat analysis). The survival experience of patients in both treatment groups will be 
summarized by the Kaplan-Meier method and comp ared primarily by a stratified log-rank test 
adjusting for stratification vari ables at randomization (listed in Section 3.1 ) for the General 
Population and unstratified log-rank test for the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation.  
Sensitivity analyses based on stratified Cox pr oportional hazards model will also be performed 
for the General Population or/and in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation depending on the decision 
from interim analysis. Geographical region (North America/Western Europe/Australia, 
Japan/Korea, versus  rest of the world), time to progression on first line therapy from start of first

68 line therapy (<6 months versus  ≥6 months), RAS status (mutant versus  wild type), bevacizumab 
as part of protocol treatment (yes versus  no), and location of the primary tumor (left colon versus  
right colon) will be the stratification factors to  define the stratified Cox proportional hazards 
model. 
Subgroup analysis and the corresponding forest plot analysis may be performed using the 
stratification factors mentioned above as well as the following factors:  
x Age (<65 versus  ≥65) 
x Sex (male versus  female) 
x Presence of liver metastases (yes versus  no) 
x Primary tumor site (colon versus  rectum) 
x ECOG Performance Status (0 vs 1) 
x Race (White, Black, Asian, other) 
x Country (Canada, USA, Western Europe, Australia, Japan, Korea, China, others) 
x Microsatellite Instability (MSS vs MSI-L vs MSI-H vs MSI-V) 
x Prior Bevacizumab: Yes / No   
13.2.2.  Key Secondary Endpoints 
The following key secondary outcomes will be assessed: 
Progression-Free Survival in the Genera l Population and the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation 
Progression-free survival is defined as the ti me from randomization to the first objective 
documentation of disease progression or death, whichever comes first. If a patient has not 
progressed or died at the time of the interim or fi nal analysis, PFS will be censored on the date of 
the last tumor assessment. This includes patients  who are lost to follow-up or have withdrawn 
consent. The progression free survival in bot h treatment groups will be summarized by the 
Kaplan-Meier method and compared primarily by a stratified log-rank test adjusting for stratification variables at randomization for th e General Population and unstratified log-rank test 
for the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation. 
Disease Control Rate in the General Population and the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation  
Disease control rate is defined as the propo rtion of patients with a documented complete 
response, partial response, and stable disease (CR + PR + SD) based on RECIST 1.1. The 
primary estimate of DCR will be based on patien ts with measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 at 
randomization.  For the General Population, differen ces of DCR between the two arms will be 
compared using a 1-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test stratified for stratification factors.  
Treatment difference of DCR and its 95% confide nce interval based on harmonic mean method 
adjusting stratification factors will be provided.  For the pS TAT3(+) Subpopulation, differences 
of DCR between the two arms will be compared using a 1-sided Z-test via normal 
approximation.  Treatment difference of DCR a nd its 95% confidence interval based on normal 
approximation (unstratified) will be provided.   
Objective Response Rate in the Genera l Population and the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation

CONFIDENTIAL 
69 Objective response rate is defined as the p roportion of patients with a documented complete 
response and partial response (CR + PR) based on RECIST 1.1. The primary estimate for ORR 
will be based on patients with measurable dise ase by RECIST 1.1 at randomization.  Differences 
of ORR between the two arms will be analyzed the same as DCR for the General Population and for the pSTAT3(+) subpopulation.   
13.2.3.  Other Secondary Endpoints 
Quality of Life Analysis in the General Population and the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation 
The QoL of patients will be assessed usi ng EORTC QLQ-30 while the patient remains on study 
treatment (FOLFIRI with or without BBI-608) as per Section  8.1. The EORTC QLQ-30 is a self-
administered cancer specific questionna ire with multi-dimensional scales ( Appendix 5 ). It 
consists of both multi-item scales and single item measures, including 5 functional domains, a 
global quality of life domain, 3 symptom domains,  and 6 single items. Scoring of the EORTC 
QLQ-30 data will be completed following the procedures recommended by the EORTC Study Group on Quality of Life. For each domain or single item measure a linear transformation will be 
applied to standardize the raw score to range be tween 0 and 100. The quality of life data will be 
analyzed to look for statistically and clinically significant differences between the BBI-608 plus 
FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI groups. Questionnaire compliance rates will be ascertained for each 
group at each measurement time point. Mean ba seline scores for each subscale and summary 
scores will be calculated ( Appendix 5 ). Questionnaire compliance ra tes will be ascertained for 
each group at each measurement time point. Mean  baseline scores for  each subscale and 
summary scores will be calculated. 
The endpoints in QoL analysis are the mean EORTC QLQ-C30 QoL change scores from 
baseline at Time 2 (Cycle 5 Day 1) and Time 4 (Cycle 9 Day 1) for the physical function and 
global health status/quality of life subscale scor es. Wilcoxon tests will be used to compare the 
difference at each of these 2 timepoints between 2 treatment arms for each of these 2 subscales. 
The proportion of patients in either arm with at  least a minimum of 10-uni t(s) deterioration in 
change scores at both Cycle 5 Day 1 a nd Cycle 9 Day 1 will be summarized. 
Safety Analysis 
All patients who have received at least 1 dose of study treatment (BBI-608 or FOLFIRI) will be 
included in the safety analysis. The incidence of AEs will be summarized by type of AE and 
severity using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0. The Exact test ( Chan 1999 ) may be used when comparing AE rate between treatment arms. 
13.3. Sample Size and Duration of Study 
The primary study endpoints are OS for the General Population and the pSTAT3(+) 
Subpopulation. The hypotheses (the General P opulation and the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation) for 
the study are as follows:   
For the General Population, the null and alternative hypotheses are:  
H10: BBI- 608 + FOLFIRI ≤ FOLFIRI in the General Population  
H11: BBI-608+FOLFIRI > FOLFIRI in the General Population  
For the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation, the null and alternative hypotheses are:

70 H20: BBI- 608 + FOLFIRI ≤ FOLFIRI in the pSTAT3 (+) Subpopulation 
H21: BBI-608+FOLFIRI > FOLFIRI in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation 
Sample Size and Power in the General Population  
For the General Population, this study is designed to have a power of 90% and a 1- sided α=0.025 
to detect a 20% reduction in the risk of d eath (HR 0.80 which corresponds to an increase of 
median survival from 12.54 to 15.68 months) The above design assumptions account for the 
anticipated varying control hazard rates fo r the bevacizumab versus no-bevacizumab 
stratification levels. It is assumed that approxim ately 30% of subjects will receive bevacizumab 
with expected mOS for the control arm FOLF IRI+bevacizumab subjects being 13.66 months 
while 70% of the subjects will not receive bevacizumab and have expected mOS of 12.06 
months [Van Cutsem 2012]. Without adjusting for multiplicity, it is estimated that 850 events in 
the General Population will be required to dete ct this reduction, which would be observed by 
randomizing 1250 patients (General Population) over 26 months with patient follow up for an 
additional 14 months, for a total study duration of 40 months. It is anticipated that up to 5% 
dropout rate will occur over the entire study. 
Sample Size and Power in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation  
According to the preliminary data from Studies BBI608-101, CO.23, BBI608-201, BBI608-224, 
and BBI608 246, of the 599 patients with biomarke r samples in the pooled analysis, 241 patients 
were pSTAT3(+), the pSTAT3(+) prevalence was estimated to be around 40% (95% CI: 36%, 
44%). If considering a lower boundary of 36% as  the biomarker positive prevalence in the 
current study, and proportional to the total deaths events in the General Population, there would be 310 (approximately 36% of 850) events in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation.  
For the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation, without adjusting for multiplicity, and assuming 310 events, 
there will be approximately 88% nominal power at 1- sided α=0.025 to detect a 30% reduction 
(HR [BBI-608+FOLFIRI vs FOLFIRI] = 0.70) in the risk of death in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation.  
Overall Power of the Study 
Assuming at the final analysis there are 850 events in the General Population and 310 events in 
the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation, considering multiplicity adjustment (Section 13.6), the overall 
power for the entire study which succeeds either in terms of OS in the General Population or in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation or both, is approxima tely 90%, assuming that the true OS hazard 
ratio in the General Population is 0.80 and that in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation is 0.70. 
13.4. Safety Monitoring 
Adverse events will be monitored on an on-going basis by central review. 
13.5. Interim Analysis 
An interim analysis will be conducted when  425 deaths occur (50% of total number of 
850 deaths) in the General Population for the pur pose of decision rules of futility, population and 
hypothesis selection, and event count adjustment ( Figure 2 ). The OS results will be evaluated by 
the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). Additionally, the DSMB will review safety

71 during conduct of the study. The role and responsib ility of the DSMB will be defined in a 
separate Charter. The recommendations from DSMB on the study design and conduct will be 
based on the following decisions: 
x Futility stopping: terminate the trial due to lack of efficacy (futility) or terminate pSTAT3(-) and 
pSTAT3 status unknown subpopulation 
x Patient population and hypothesis selection: select the most appropriate patient population and 
hypothesis (hypothesis in General Population, a nd/or hypothesis in pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation) 
for evaluating the significance of the tr eatment effect at the final analysis 
x Event count adjustment: remain the current events si ze or increase the target number of events in 
1 of or both pre-defined patient populations 
The details decision rules are described as following:  
Futility stopping rule: Perform an early assessmen t of the efficacy profile of BBI-608+FOLFIRI 
vs FOLFIRI in the 2 pre-defined patient populat ions and terminate the trial due to lack of 
efficacy (futility) if there is no evidence of treatment benefit in either population.  
The decision rules will be applied simultaneously  based on the observed hazard ratios at interim 
analysis: 
x ܴܪ଴: Hazard Ratio (BBI-608+FOLFIRI vs FOLFIRI) in the General Population. 
x ܴܪା: Hazard Ratio (BBI-608+FOLFIRI vs FOLFIRI) in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation. 
x ܴܪି: Hazard Ratio (BBI-608+FOLFIRI vs FOLFIRI) in the pSTAT3(-) Subpopulation. 
If ܴܪା: > c1 and ܴܪ଴: > c2, then the trial may be stopped due to lack of efficacy.  
If ܴܪା: ൑ c1 and ܴܪି> c3, then continue the trial for pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation only and 
perform the final analysis in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation. Here c1= c2= c3=1 are futility 
boundaries for the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation, th e General Population and the pSTAT3(-) 
Subpopulation respectively.  
Patient population and hypothesis selection rule: Select the most appropriate patient population 
and hypothesis for evaluating the significance of the treatment effect at the final analysis. 
The patient population selection rules are based on futility analysis and the interaction condition 
introduced in [ Millen 2012 ]. In this trial, if the General Population continues after interim 
analysis, the interaction condition will be evaluated by comparing the ratio of ܴܪା/ܴܪି with 
pre-specified threshold of c4 where c4 will be set to 0.9. If ܴܪା/ܴܪି൐ c4 which indicates the 
treatment effect in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulat ion is comparable to pSTAT3(-) Subpopulation, 
the hypothesis for the General Population only (the  broad indication) would be appropriate. On 
the other hand, if ܴܪା/ܴܪି൑ c4, which indicate the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation has substantial 
improvement compared to the pSTAT3(-) S ubpopulation, both hypotheses of the pSTAT3(+) 
subpopulation and the General Popu lation would be considered.  
If only the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation is cont inued, only the hypothesis of the pSTAT3(+) 
Subpopulation will be tested, and no interaction check will be performed.  
Event count adjustment rule: Increase the target number of events in 1 of or both pre-defined 
patient populations to improve the probability of success in the trial.

CONFIDENTIAL 
72 Within each patient population (General Population or pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation), conditional 
power is defined as the probability of establishing a significant OS effect at the final analysis 
conditional upon the interim analysis data at a 1- sided α=0.025. C onditional power is computed 
within each patient population using the population-specific hazard ratio observed at the interim 
analysis before an event count adjustment. A closed-form expression for conditional power is 
provided in Appendix 6 . The event count adjustment rule will be defined by identifying an 
optimal balance between the competing goals of increasing conditional power and reducing the 
number of events. The event count adjustment may also consider other factors including 
potential clinical benefits and operational feasibility. The details of the event count adjustment rule will be provided in a separate document a nd be available to DSMB and other unblinded staff 
as appropriate for recommendation and/or decision for  the interim analysis results. In the event 
that the event count for pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation is to be increased, the protocol may be 
amended to reflect this change. 
If the final analysis is performed in both the General Population and the pSTAT3(+) 
Subpopulation, the number of events in the trial will be driven by that in the General Population or in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation, whichever comes last. 
13.6. Multiplicity Adjustment 
To address multiplicity introduced by the anal ysis of several endpoints (primary endpoint and 
key secondary endpoints), analysis of the 2 patient populations (General Population and pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation), and data-driven desi gn changes, a Hochberg-based gatekeeping 
procedure will be implemented [ Dmitrienko  (2011, 2013)  and Kordzakhia (2018b) ]. The 
hypothesis testing for the key secondary endpoints will follow the order of PFS, DCR, and ORR 
in both the General Population a nd the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation.  
The gatekeeping procedure will be applied in  conjunction with the combination function 
approach at the final analyses to ensure strong Type I error rate control. A description of the multiplicity adjustment procedure is provided in Appendix 6 .

76 15. ETHICAL, REGULATORY, AND ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES 
15.1. Regulatory Considerations 
All institutions must conduct this trial in accordance with International Conference on 
Harmonization-Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) Guidelines and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 
The conduct of this trial must comply with local laws and national regulations (e.g. in the United 
States of America with applicable US FDA Regulations; in Canada with Division 5 of the 
Canadian Regulations Respecting Food and Drugs [Food and Drugs Act]) relevant to the use of 
new therapeutic agents in the country of conduct. 
Any changes to the protocol, including any amendments to the patient information, informed 
consent, quality of life forms, and any other pa tient study-related documents, will require the 
Sponsor to submit to the Regulatory Authorities as well as to the Ethics Committees. Further, 
changes outlined in such an amendment will not be implemented prior to receiving approval 
from the Regulatory Authority and Ethics Committee.  
15.2. Inclusivity in Research 
Individuals must not be excluded from participation in clinical trials on the basis of attributes 
such as culture, religion, race, national or ethni c origin, color, mental or physical disability 
(except incapacity), sexual orientation, sex/gende r, occupation, ethnicity, income, or criminal 
record, unless there is a valid reason (i.e. safety) for the exclusion.  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki  and the Tri-Council Policy Statement (TCPS), 
vulnerable persons or groups will not be automati cally excluded from a clinical trial (except for 
incompetent persons) if participation in the trial may benefit the patient or a group to which the person belongs.  
However, extra protections may be necessary for vulnerable persons or groups. It is the 
responsibility of the local Investigator and Institutional Review Board (IRB) to ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place to protect vulnerable persons/groups. In accordance with 
TCPS, researchers and IRB should provide special protections for those who are vulnerable to 
abuse, exploitation or discrimination. As vulnerable populations may be susceptible to coercion or undue influence, it is especially important th at informed consent be obtained appropriately.  
Centers are expected to ensure compliance w ith local IRB or institutional policy regarding 
participation of vulner able persons/groups. It is the center’s responsibility to ensure compliance 
with all local SOPs.  
Persons who cannot give informed consent (i .e. mentally incompetent persons, or those 
physically incapacitated such as comatose persons) are not to be recruited to this study. It is the responsibility of the local Investigator to determine the subject’s competency, in accordance with applicable local policies and in conjunction with the local IRB (if applicable).  
Subjects who were competent at the time of enrollment in the clinical trial but become 
incompetent during their participation do not automa tically have to be removed from the study. 
When re-consent of the patient is required, In vestigators must follow applicable local policies 
when determining if it is acceptable for a substi tute decision maker to be used. The Sponsor will 
Study CanStem303C (Protocol Amendment 7.0)                    Amendment Date: 25 October 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL 
77 accept re-consent from a substitute decision maker. If  this patient subsequently regains capacity, 
the patient should be re-consented as a condition of continuing participation.  
15.3. Obtaining Informed Consent 
Informed consent will be obtained for each participant/potential participant in this trial, in 
accordance with ICH-GCP Section 4.8. The center is responsible for ensuring that all local policies are followed. 
Additionally, in accordance with GCP 4.8.2, the Sponsor may require that participants/potential 
participants be informed of any new information may impact a participant’s/potential participant’s willingness to participate in the study.  
Based upon applicable guidelines and regulations (Declaration of Helsinki, ICH-GCP), a 
participating Investigator (as defined on the partic ipants list) is ultimately responsible, in terms 
of liability and compliance, for ensuring informed  consent has been appropriately obtained. The 
Sponsor recognizes that in many centers other pers onnel (as designated on the participants list) 
also play an important role in this process. In accordance with GCP 4.8.5, it is acceptable for the Principal Investigator to delegate the respons ibility for conducting the consent discussion. 
The Sponsor requires that each participant sign a consent form prior to their enrolment in the 
study to document his/her willingness to take pa rt. The Sponsor may also require, as indicated 
above, that participants/potential participants be  informed of new information if it becomes 
available during the course of the study. In conjunction with GCP 4.8.2, the communication of 
this information should be documented. 
The Sponsor allows the use of translators in obtaining informed consent. Provision of translators 
is the responsibility of the local center. Centers should follow applicable local policies when 
procuring or using a translator for the purpose of obtaining informed consent to participate in a clinical trial.  
In accordance with ICH-GCP 4.8.9, if a subject is unable to read, then informed consent may be 
obtained by having the consent form read and explained to the subject. This process must be thoroughly documented. 
15.3.1.  Obtaining Consent for Pregnancy/Exposure Reporting 
Information from and/or about the subject (i.e . the pregnant female, the newborn infant, male 
partner) should not be collected about or from th em unless or until they are a willing participant 
in the research. The rights and protections offered to participants in research apply and consent 
must be obtained prior to collecting any informati on about or from them. If the pregnant female 
is not a participant in the main trial, consent should be obtained via use of the exposure/pregnancy follow-up consent form.  
In the case of information collected about a newborn, consent should be provided by the legal 
guardian. In cases where the legal guardian is the pa rticipant in the main trial, consent is obtained 
via the main consent. If the legal guardian is not the trial participant, consent should be obtained 
via the exposure/pregnancy follow-up consent.  
Participants will not be withdrawn from the main trial as a result of refusing or withdrawing 
permission to provide information related to the pregnancy /exposure. Similarly, male 
Study CanStem303C (Protocol Amendment 7.0)                    Amendment Date: 25 October 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL 
78 participants will not be withdrawn from the main study should their partner refuse/withdraw 
permission. 
15.4. Discontinuation of the Trial 
If this trial is discontinued for any reason by the S ponsor all centers will be notified in writing of 
the discontinuance and the reason(s) why. If the reason(s) for discontinuance involves any 
potential risks to the health of patients participating on the trial or other persons, the Sponsor will 
provide this information to centers as well. 
If this trial is discontinued at any time by the ce nter (prior to closure of the trial by the Sponsor), 
it is the responsibility of the Principal Investig ator to notify the Sponsor of the discontinuation 
and the reason(s) why.  
Whether the trial is discontinued by the Sponsor or  locally by the center, it is the responsibility of 
the Principal Investigator to notify the local In stitutional Review Board and all clinical trials 
subjects of the discontinuance and any potential risks to the subjects or other persons. 
Following trial closure after demonstrating ove rall survival benefit, and until the time that 
BBI-608 is commercially available, all patients  randomized on the trial may have an opportunity 
to receive treatment with BBI-608; provided, that the Principal Investigator has determined that 
such continued treatment would be in the best interest of the patient, and subject to approval by 
the applicable regulatory authorities. This may be done via a new, open label extension study, 
requiring additional regulatory approval, or in another manner as determined by the Sponsor. 
15.5. Retention of Patient Records and Study Files 
All essential documents and study data must be maintained in accordance with ICH-GCP.  
The Principal Investigator must ensure compliance with GCP Guideline from every person 
involved in the conduct of the clinical trial at the site.  
Essential documents and study data must be re tained for 25 years following the completion of 
the trial at the center (25 years post final analysis, last data collected, or closure notification to 
IRB, whichever is later), or until notified by the Sponsor that documents no longer need to be 
retained. 
In accordance with GCP 4.9.7, upon request by the m onitor, auditor, IRB or regulatory authority, 
the Investigator/institution must make all required trial-related records available for direct access.  
The Sponsor will inform the Investigator/Institution as to when the essential documents no 
longer need to be retained.  
15.6. On-Site Monitoring/Auditing 
In addition to the routine review of case report forms and supporting documents sent to the 
central office, site monitoring will be conducted at participating centers in the course of the study as part of the overall quality assurance program . The monitors/auditors will require access to 
patient medical records to verify the data, as  well as pharmacy, essential document binders, 
standard operating procedures (including elect ronic information) and ethics documentation.

1 BBI-608 administration will begin 2 days prior to the FOLFIRI infusion on day 1 of cycle 1. These two days are referred to as  run-in day 1  and run-in day 2 . 
The run-in day  period may be extended by up to 3 additional calendar days. Run-in day 1  should occur within 2 calendar days of patient randomization on 
study Arm 1. 
2 Medical history must include date of diagnosis including histological documen tation of malignancy, documentation of RAS status of tumor, prior anticancer 
therapy and prior date(s) of disease progression.  
3 FOLFIRI administration should proceed acco rding to institutional standard practice (with  respect to pre-treatment laboratory ev aluation, clinical assessment, 
pre-medication, and monitoring during and after  infusion). Addition of bevacizumab to the FOLFIRI regimen, per Investigator cho ice, will be permissible. 
4 Laboratory investigations should be perfor med within 3 days prior to FOLFIRI admi nistration on Day 1 of every 14-day Cycle of  protocol treatment or within 
3 days prior to each FOLFIRI infusion. Labor atory testing performed as part of standard  of care prior to patient signature of t he study consent will be 
acceptable as baseline lab work as long as testing is performed ≤ 14 days prior to randomization. Laboratory  testing performed as part of pre-treatment 
assessments within 3 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 will be acceptable as Cycle 1 Day 1 lab work and will not need to be repeated.  
5 Tumor measurement and evaluation by RECIST 1.1 criteria. The same method of assessme nt and the same technique should be used to identify and report each 
lesion at baseline and at reassessment duri ng treatment. Tumor evaluations will con tinue until progressive disease is documente d (as described in Section 9). 
For patients who remain on protocol therapy after objective diseas e progression has been documented, no further imaging assessm ents are mandated, but where 
these occur as a component of care, tumor measurements and asse ssment must be reported. Tumor assessments shoul d be obtained wi thin +/- 5 days of protocol 
specified schedule. Qualifying scans performed as part of standard of care prior to patient signature of the study informed con sent will be acceptable as baseline 
scanning as long as scanning is performed ≤ 21 days prior to randomization.  
6 Sample collections should be performed at baselin e and at Day 1 of Cycle 3 after randomization. 
7 A sample will be collected following protocol treatment discontinu ation if discontinuation occurs prior to 4 weeks of therapy .  
8 In women of childbearing potential only. The minimum sensitivity of  the pregnancy test must be 25 IU/L or equivalent units of  HCG. Baseline pregnancy test 
should be done within 5 days of randomization. 
9 In women of childbearing potential only a negative pregnancy tes t must be demonstrated every 4 weeks until 4 weeks after the administration of the final dose 
of protocol therapy.

Day 1 of Cycle 13 (+/- 3 days) af ter randomization for as long as patient remains on Protocol therapy or until deterioration to  ECOG PS 4 or hospitalization for 
end of life care. 
13 EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires will be co llected in the post-protocol discontinuation period only if the patient discontinues protocol treatment prior to 24 
weeks of therapy and has an ECOG PS of less than 4 and has not been hospitalized for end of life care. 
14 These assessments may occur within a ±7-d ay window, and after the first visit at which  the patient has been off protocol tre atment for 4 weeks, patients will 
be assessed every 8 weeks for survival and any protocol trea tment related adverse events. Med ical history at post-progression f ollow up must include post-
protocol treatment cancer therapies. 
15 After the first visit at which  the patient has been off protocol treatment fo r 4 weeks, patients will be assessed for surviv al every 8 weeks until deterioration to

91 APPENDIX 5.  QUALITY OF LIFE ASSESSMENT 
Introduction 
The assumption that control of symptoms will automatically improve quality of life is probably 
true but hasn't yet been tested, especially in determining how certain symptoms may or may not 
affect quality of life. Current literature reveals interesting things; 2 in particular are: 
x additional and useful information may be obtained from quality of life measurements 
x a growing consensus that the goal of medical care today for most patients is the preservation 
of function and well-being in everyday life. 
We have reached the stage where the collecti on of information about psychological distress, 
social disruption, emotional trauma and painful side-effects is not only necessary but a routine 
component in many protocols. 
Quality of life data can be used in a variety of ways: 
x to try to achieve the best possible outcome for patients 
x to evaluate the extent of change in the quality of life of an individual or group across time 
x to evaluate new treatments and technologies 
x to support approval of new drug applications 
x to try to provide the best value for health care dollars 
x to compare costs and benefits of various fina ncial and organizational aspects of health care 
services 
In the future, approval of not only drugs but also  new therapies or methods of delivery will most 
likely be based on a combination of quality of li fe, survival, response, and adverse event data. 
Instructions for Administration of a Quality of Life Questionnaire 
The instructions below are intended as a guide for the administration of the Quality of Life 
questionnaire. 
Preamble 
Quality of life data are collected for research purposes and will usually not be used for the 
patient’s individual medical care. The assessment is in the form of a self -report questionnaire. 
Therefore, it must be completed by the patien t only, without translation, coaching or suggestions 
as to the "correct" answer by relatives or health care personnel. 
The usual scheduled times to obtain the questionnaires are as follows: 
x pre-randomization or pre-registration (baseline) 
x during treatment 
x during follow-up 
The information provided by the patient in the co mpleted questionnaire is confidential and 
should not be discussed with or shown to anyone  who is NOT mentioned in the consent form 
signed by the patient. 
Study CanStem303C (Protocol Amendment 6.0)                    Amendment Date: 25 September 2018  
CONFIDENTIAL 
92 If a particular question has not been answered, please document the reason(s) in the appropriate 
space on the appropriate case report form. If th e whole questionnaire has not been completed, 
please document the reason(s) on the appropriate case report forms. 
Pre-treatment Assessment 
It should be explained to the patient that the purpose of the questionnaire is to assess the impact 
of treatment on different areas of the patient's li fe, e.g.: psychological distress, social disruption, 
side-effects, et cetera. 
Study staff should collect the quest ionnaire as soon as it has been completed, check to see that 
each question has been answered and gently re mind the patient to answer any inadvertently 
omitted questions. If a patient states that s/he prefers not to answer some questions and gives a 
reason(s), the reason(s) should be noted on the questi onnaire by the patient. If a specific reason is 
not given, this also should be noted on the questionnaire by the patient. 
Assessments During Treatment 
The quality of life questionnaire should be given to the patient before being seen by the doctor, 
and prior to treatment on the day of treatment, as  required by the schedule in the protocol. If the 
patient does not have a doctor visit scheduled, or if it was not possible for the patient to complete 
the questionnaire before being seen by the doctor, s/he should still complete the questionnaire 
prior to treatment. 
Assessments During Follow-up 
The quality of life questionnaire should be given to the patient before being seen by the doctor, 
for as long as the patient continues on Protocol therapy, as required by the schedule at 
approximately: 
x 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 weeks or until deterioration to ECOG PS 4 or hospitalization for end of 
life care  
x the first regularly scheduled 4-week assessmen t at which the patient has been off study 
therapy for a minimum of 28 days  (±3 days) if study therapy di scontinuation occurred prior 
to 24 weeks and until deterioration to ECOG PS 4 or hospitalization for end of life care 
A patient may, on occasion, be reluctant to comple te the questionnaire because they feel unwell. 
In that case, you may express sympathy that things are below par, but state that this is exactly the 
information we require if we are to understand more about how quality of life is affected. You may also remind them that it takes only a few minutes to complete. 
It defeats the whole purpose of the assessment if it is delayed until the patient feels better!
  
x What If . . .  
 The patient should complete the questionnaires  at the clinic. The exception is that the 
design of some trials may require the patient to take the questionnaire home with them 
after leaving the clinic, and complete it on the specific day, because a return visit to the 
clinic is not scheduled. 
 There may be circumstances when the pati ent does not complete the questionnaire as 
required in the clinic. Three situations are desc ribed below. In these cases, it is beneficial 
if quality of life data can still be collected.

CONFIDENTIAL 
93  The patient leaves the clinic before the quest ionnaire could be administered, or someone 
forgets to give the questionnaire to the patient.  
x Contact the patient by phone informing him or her that the questionnaire was not completed. 
Ask the patient if s/he is willing to complete one: 
 If yes, mail a blank questionnaire to the patient, and make arrangements for return of the 
questionnaire in a timely fashion. Record the date it was mailed, and the date received on the questionnaire. 
 If this is not feasible, then ask the patient if s/he is willing to complete a questionnaire 
over the phone. If the patient agrees, read out the questions and range of possibilities, and 
record the answers. Make a note on the questionnaire that the questionnaire was completed over the phone. 
 If no, note the reason why the questionnaire was not completed on the appropriate case 
report form. 
x The patient goes on an extended vacation for several months and won't attend the clinic for 
regular visit(s). 
 Ensure that the patient has a supply of questionnaires, with instructions about when to 
complete them, and how to return them. If it is known beforehand, give the patient blank 
questionnaires at the last clinic visit; if th e extended absence is not known in advance, 
mail the blank questionnaires to the patient. Written instructions may help ensure that the 
patient stays on schedule as much as possible.  
x The patient does not want to co mplete the questionnaire in clinic. 
 Should the patient not wish to answer the qu estionnaire in the clinic but insists on taking 
it home and failing to comply with the patient's wishes is likely to result in the questionnaire not being completed at all, th en the patient may take the questionnaire 
home with instructions that it is to be completed the same day. When the questionnaire is 
returned, the date on which the questionnaire was completed should be noted and a comment made on the questionnaire as to why the patient took it away from the clinic 
before completion.

97 APPENDIX 6.  DECISION RULES AND MULTIPLICITY 
CONTROL PROCEDURE FOR ADAPTIVE DESIGN 
To address multiplicity induced by the analysis  of several endpoints (primary and key secondary 
endpoints) at several decision points (interim a nd final analyses) in several patient populations 
(General Population and STAT3(+) Subpopulation), a mult iplicity adjustment will be utilized to 
control the overall Type I error rate (familywise error rate) in this trial in the strong sense at a 
1-sided D=0.025. This multiplicity adjustment is constructed by applying the closed testing 
principle in conjunction with the combinati on function approach. The key components of the 
multiplicity adjustment are defined below a nd a detailed description of this multiplicity 
adjustment will be provided in the SAP. 
Hochberg-based Gatekeeping Procedure 
The first component of the multiplicity adjustment that accounts for the first 2 sources of multiplicity (analysis of several endpoints in several patient populations) relies on a Hochberg-
based gatekeeping procedure. This procedure is defined using the mixture-based approach 
developed in Dmitrienko and Tamhane [ 2011, 2013 ] and later enhanced in Kordzakhia et al. 
[2018b ]. This gatekeeping procedure will be appl ied to the 8 null hypotheses of no effect based 
on the 4 endpoints that are evaluated in the 2 patient populations:  
x Family 1: Hypothesis H
10 (null hypothesis of no OS effect in the General Population) and 
Hypothesis H20 (null hypothesis of no OS effect in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation). 
x Family 2: Hypothesis H30 (null hypothesis of no PFS effect in the General Population) and 
Hypothesis H40 (null hypothesis of no PFS effect in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation). 
x Family 3: Hypothesis H50 (null hypothesis of no DCR effect in the General Population) and 
Hypothesis H60 (null hypothesis of no DCR effect in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation). 
x Family 4: Hypothesis H70 (null hypothesis of no ORR effect in the General Population) and 
Hypothesis H80 (null hypothesis of no ORR effect in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation). 
The hypotheses will be organized into 2 branches (i.e. the null hypotheses in the General 
Population [ H10, H30, H50 and H70] and the null hypotheses in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation 
[H20, H40, H60 and H80]), and tested sequentially within each branch.  
Key features of the Hochberg-based gatekeeping procedure include: 
x The gatekeeping procedure accounts for the clinically relevant logical restrictions (i.e. for the 
fact that the null hypotheses are organized into  branches and tested sequentially within each 
branch).  
x The gatekeeping procedure utilizes powerful Ho chberg-type tests (regular and truncated 
Hochberg tests) for testing the hypotheses with in each family. These tests account for 
positive correlations between the test statistics within each family, which is induced by the 
fact that the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation is nested within the General Population. The regular 
and truncated Hochberg tests cont rol the Type I error rate within  each family since if the test 
statistics within each family follow a bivar iate normal distribution with a non-negative 
pairwise correlation (Sarkar [ 2008 ]).

98 x The gatekeeping procedure uses truncated Hochberg tests in the first 3 families because they 
serve as gatekeepers for other families. The regular Hochberg test is applied in Family 4 since it is the last family in the sequence. The truncated Hochberg tests used in Families 1, 2, 
and 3 will be defined using a pre -specified truncation parameter J=0.8.      
To define the regular and trunc ated Hochberg tests, consider, for example, Family 1 which 
includes the hypotheses H
10 and H20. Let p1 and p2 denote the corresponding 1-sided p-values 
and let p(1) < p(2) denote the ordered p-values. Finally, let D1 denote the 1-sided significance level 
applied within this family ( D1 may not be equal to D=0.025). The regular Hochberg test relies on 
the following 2-step testing algorithm: 
x Step 1: The test rejects both H10 and H20 if p(2) ≤ D1. 
x Step 2: If p(2) >D1, the test rejects the hypothesis corresponding to the smaller p-value if p(1) 
≤D1/2. 
The truncated Hochberg test utilizes th e following 2-step testing algorithm: 
x Step 1: The test rejects both H10 and H20 if p(2) ≤ (J+(1-J)/2)D1. 
x Step 2: If p(2) > (J+(1-J)/2)D1, the test rejects the hypothesis corresponding to the smaller p-
value if p(1) ≤ D1/2. 
Interim Analysis Decision Rules 
This section defines the decision rules that will be applied at the interim analysis. 
Futility Stopping and Patient Population Selection Rules 
The 2 decision rules will be applied simul taneously based on the observed hazard ratios: 
x ܴܪ଴: Hazard ratio in the General Population 
x ܴܪା: Hazard ratio in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation 
x ܴܪି: Hazard ratio in the pSTAT3(-) Subpopulation 
The resulting decision rules are defined as fo llows using appropriate values of the thresholds 
denoted by c1 through c4: 
x Case 1: If Condition 1 ( ܴܪା > c1) is met and Condition 2 ( ܴܪ଴ > c2) is met, terminate the trial 
at the interim analysis due to lack of efficacy 
x Case 2: If Condition 1 ( ܴܪା > c1) is met and Condition 2 ( ܴܪ଴> c2) is not met, continue the 
trial and perform the final analysis in the General Population only 
x Case 3: If Condition 1 ( ܴܪା > c1) is not met and Condition 3 ( ܴܪି > c3) is met: Continue the 
trial and perform the final analysis in the pSTAT3+ Subpopulation only 
x Case 4: If Condition 1 ( ܴܪା > c1) is not met, Condition 3 ( ܴܪି > c3) is not met and Condition 
4 (ܴܪା/HR - > c4) is met: Continue the trial and perform the final analysis in the General 
Population only

CONFIDENTIAL 
99 x Case 5: If Condition 1 ( ܴܪା > c1) is not met, Condition 3 ( ܴܪି > c3) is not met and Condition 
4 (ܴܪା/ܴܪି > c4) is not met: Continue the trial and perform the final analysis in the General 
Population as well as the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation.  
Here c1= c2= c3=1 in the Conditions 1 to 3 and c4= 0.9 for the Condition 4.  
These patient population selection rules are base d on the influence and interaction conditions 
introduced in Millen 2012 . 
Event Count Adjustment Rule 
Within each patient population (the General Population or the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation), 
conditional power (CP) is defined as the probability of establishing a significant OS effect at the 
final analysis conditional upon the interim analysis data at a 1-sided D=0.025. Conditional power 
is computed within each patient population using the population-specific ha zard ratio observed at 
the interim analysis before an event count adju stment. A closed-form expression for conditional 
power [ Dmitrienko 2017 ] is given below:

where 
 
Z is the 1-sided log-rank test statistic [ Jennison and Turnbull, 2000 ] computed at the interim 
analysis within the selected patient population and c = 1.96 is the significance level to be applied 
at the final analysis. m1 and m2 denote the number of OS events at the interim analysis and at the 
original final analysis. θ is the observed effect size (log -hazard ratio) at the interim analysis.  
The event count adjustment rule will be defined by identifying an optimal balance between the 
competing goals of increasing conditional power and reducing the number of events. The 
resulting approach leads to an event count adju stment rule that minimizes the average number of 
events within each patient population. The even t count adjustment may also consider other 
factors including potential clinical benefits and operational feasibility. 
If the final analysis is performed in the General Population as well as the pSTAT3(+) 
Subpopulation, the target number of events in th e trial will be determined by the number of 
events in the General Population or the pS TAT3(+) Subpopulation whichever comes last. 
Adaptive Design 
A multi-stage adaptive design will be utilized in  this Phase 3 trial. The decision rules employed 
in the adaptive design will be applied along with the gatekeeping procedure defined earlier in 
this section using the combination function approach [ Cui 1999  and Brannath  2002 ]. The 
combination function approach will be applied using the weighted inverse-normal combination 
function to address the third source of multiplicity (evaluation of the treatment effect at several 
decision points). The joint application of th e combination function approach and gatekeeping v1m1

[2018a ], and Sugitani et al. [ 2018 ]. 
Combination Function Approach for General Population 
For the General Population, the combination function approach remains the same as previous version of 
protocol.  The test statistics for evaluating the significan ce of the treatment effect or p-values will 
be computed from the data collected up to the interim analysis (Stage 1) and after the interim analysis (Stage 2). The stage-wise p-values for  the primary endpoint (OS) will be obtained from 
the increments of the log-rank test statistics using the general approach developed in Shen and 
Cai [ 2003 ] and Wassmer [ 2006 ]. The increments of the log-rank test statistics that correspond to 
the 2 trial stages are defined as follows:

x ݇ଵଵ and ݇ଶଵ:  the number of events at the interim anal ysis and final analysis for the General 
Population.   
The 1-sided stage-wise p-values referred as the Stage 1 and Stage 2 p-values for testing the null 
hypothesis ܪଵ଴, will be computed from these log-rank test statistics as

where )(x) denotes the cumulative distribution func tion of the standard normal distribution.  
The two stage-wise test statistics are independent of  each other under the null hypothesis of no treatment 
effect of ܪଵ଴ and thus the final treatment effect p-value can be found by combining the stage-wise p-values, 
i.e.,

where ݓଵ and ͳെݓଵ are the pre-defined stage weights assigned to Stages 1 and 2 for the null hypothesis 
ܪଵ଴.   
Combination Function Approach for pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation 
At the interim analysis, based on preliminar y assessments of the ongoing CSS study, patients 
with specimens that were within the stability window of 6 months are included for pSTAT3 
subpopulations designations.  Due to the availabili ty of additional patients with pSTAT3 results 
within the final CSS window [See Section 9.1.7   for detailed explanations], the test statistics at 
the final analysis for the primary and the key secondary endpoints in the pSTAT3(+) 
subpopulation will be computed across two subsets of patients data, i.e., Subset 1 of the patients

101 with pSTAT3 positive status within specimen age up to 6-months (including both Stage 1 pre-
interim analysis data and Stage 2 post- interim an alysis data), and Subset 2 (Stage 3) of patients 
with pSTAT3 positive status with specimen age f or longer than 6 months and but within the final 
CSS window.  Figure 3  presents the data that will be used  for the primary and the key secondary 
endpoints in the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation at the final analysis.  
Figure 3: Data in Final Analysis of the pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation 
 
Subset 2 data may also be treated as Stage 3 data for the pSTAT3(+) subpopulation 
For the pSTAT3(+) subpopulation, the statistics test for evaluating the significance of the 
treatment effect or the corresponding p-values in terms of overall survival (OS) at the final 
analysis will be computed from the following three stages of data from the two subsets of 
patients defined above.  The three stages of data are:  
x Stage 1 (Subset 1 Stage 1) Data: OS data collected up to the interim analysis from Subset 
1. 
x Stage 2 (Subset 1 Stage 2) Data: OS data collected  after the interim analysis from Subset 
1. 
x Stage 3 (Subset 2) Data: OS event data from Subset 2. 
The final treatment effect p-value for the nul l hypothesis of OS in the pSTAT3(+) subpopulation 
can be computed by combining the stage-wise p-values from the three parts of the data.   
Since Subset 1 and Subset 2 are two mutually exclusive sets of patients, Subset 2 data may also 
be treated as Stage 3 data for the pSTAT3(+) s ubpopulation to describe multi-stage combination 
function approach.   
Subset 1 Stage 1 and Stage 2 p-values for the primary endpoint (OS) in the pSTAT3(+) subpopulation will 
be obtained from the increments of the log-rank test statistics in a similar fashion as conducted for the 
General Population:

102 x ݇ଵଶ and ݇ଶଶ: the number of events at the interim analysis and final analysis for the 
pSTAT3(+) subpopulation with specimen age up to the 6-month stability window (Subset 1).   
Furthermore, let ܼଷଶכ denote the 1-sided log-rank test statistic for the pSTAT3(+) subpopulation in Subset 
2.  To ensure the test statistic ܼଷଶכ be independent of the stage wise test statistics ܼଵଶכ and ܼଶଶכ under the null 
hypothesis of no treatment effect (Magir r et al., 2016), the test statistic ܼଷଶכ needs to be computed based on 
the data available by the analysis cutoff date (a pre-determined calendar date) for Subset 2 (See 
Section 9.1.7   for details of the analysis cut dates).   
The stage-wise p-values for the pSTAT3(+) subpopulation are defined as follows: 
 ݌ଶൌͳെʣሺܼଵଶכሻǡݍଶൌͳെʣ ሺ ܼ ଶଶכሻǡݎଶൌͳെʣ ሺ ܼ ଷଶכሻǤ (5)

ܼଷଶכ is independent of the stage wise test statistics ܼଵଶכ and ܼଶଶכ under the null hypothesis of no treatment 
effect.  As a result, the final treatment effect p-value for the null hypothesis ܪଶ଴ can be computed by 
combining the stage-wise p-values, i.e.,

where ݓଶ and ͳെݓଶ are the pre-defined weights assigned to Stages 1 and 2 and, in addition, ݒଶ and ͳെݒଶ 
are the pre-defined weights assigned to Stages 1+2 and 3 for the null hypothesis ܪଶ଴.  
Combination Function Approach for Key Secondary Endpoints  
The stage-wise test statistics for PFS are defined in the same manner. To define the stage-wise 
test statistics for DCR and ORR, the log-rank test needs to be replaced by the Z test for 
proportions and the number of events need to be replaced by the numbers of patients. The 1-sided stage-wise p-values for PFS, DCR, and ORR are defined as follows: 
x Hypothesis H
30: Let p3 and q3 denote the 1-sided p-values computed from the null 
distributions of the stage-wise test statisti cs (Stage 1 and 2) for PFS in the General 
Population. 
x Hypothesis H40: Let p4 and q4 and ݎସ denote the 1-sided p-values computed from the null 
distributions of the stage-wise test statistics (Subset 1 Stage 1, 2 and Subset 2) for PFS in the 
pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation. 
x Hypothesis H50: Let p5 and q5 denote the 1-sided p-values computed from the null 
distributions of the stage-wise test statisti cs (Stage 1 and 2) for DCR in the General 
Population. 
x Hypothesis H60: Let p6 and q6 and ݎ଺denote the 1-sided p-values computed from the null 
distributions of the stage-wise test statistics (Subset Stage 1, 2 and Subset 2) for DCR in the 
pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation. 
x Hypothesis H70: Let p7 and q7 denote the 1-sided p-values computed from the null 
distributions of the stage-wise test statisti cs (Stage 1 and 2) for ORR in the General 
Population.

103 Hypothesis H80: Let p8 and q8 and ݎ଼denote the 1-sided p-values computed from the null 
distributions of the stage-wise test statistics (Subset Stage 1, 2 and Subset 2) for ORR in the 
pSTAT3(+) Subpopulation.To apply the combination function principle, the stage-wise p-values 
for OS, PFS, DCR, and ORR will be combined using an appropriately defined weighted inverse-
normal combination function.  
The inferences for the 8 hypotheses correspondi ng to OS, PFS, DCR, and ORR will be 
performed at the final analysis using the composite p-values that are defined as follows: 
x Hypothesis H10: The composite p-value is defined as ݏଵൌܿଶሺ݌ଵǡݍଵሻ. 
x Hypothesis H20: The composite p-value is defined as  ݏଶൌܿଷሺ݌ଶǡݍଶǡݎଶሻǤ

x Hypothesis H80: The composite p-value is defined as ݏ଼ൌܿଷሺ݌଼ǡݍ଼ǡݎ଼ሻ 
If the interim analysis outcome will be the treat ment effect is evaluated only in the General 
Population at the final analysis and thus the hypotheses H20, H40, H60 and H80 are dropped after 
the interim analysis, the corresponding Stage 2 and Stage 3 (Subset 2) p-values (i.e. q2, q4, q6, q8, 
r2, r4, r6 and r8) , will be set to 1. Similarly, if the treatment effect is evaluated only in the 
pSTAT3(+) subpopulation at the final analysis and thus the hypotheses H10, H30, H50 and H70 are 
dropped after the interim analysis, the corresponding Stage 2 p-values (i.e., q1, q3, q5 and q7), will 
be set to 1.  
Finally, to compute the multiplicity adjusted p-values for the hypotheses of interest at the final 
analysis, a closed family associated with th ese null hypotheses needs to be introduced. The 
closed family contains 28 - 1= 255 intersections. Let H(I) denote an arbitrary intersection 
hypothesis from the closed family, which is associated with the index set I. A local p-value, also 
known as the intersection p-value, will be computed for the intersection hypothesis H(I) as 
shown below using the composite p-values defined above (i.e. s1 through s8). 
To ensure that the final gatekeeping procedure is consistent with the logical relationships among 
the null hypotheses, the corresponding restrictions need to be imposed on the hypotheses within 
each intersection. These restrictions ensure, for example, that the hypothesis H30 cannot be 
rejected if the hypothesis H10 is not rejected. Let I* denote the restricted index set which accounts 
for the logical relationships among the null hypotheses for the intersection hypothesis H(I). It is 
easy to show that, for any intersection hypothesis H(I) in the closed family, there can be at most 
two indices left in the restricted index set I* and therefore it is sufficient to consider the following 
2 cases: 
Case 1. Suppose that there are 2 indices in the restricted index set I* that are denoted by i and j, 
i.e., I* = {i, j}. If the corresponding hypotheses are included in the same family, the local p-value 
for this intersection hypothesis is given by:

where s(i) and s(j) denote the ordered p-values, i.e., s(i) < s(j). If the corresponding hypotheses are 
included in 2 different families and the index i corresponds to the more important family, the 
local p-value for this intersection hypothesis is given by:

In this case, the local p-value for the intersection hypothesis is simply given by: 
 
 ݌ሺܫሻൌݏ௜ (9) 
 
The resulting intersection p-values will be utilized for computing the multiplicity-adjusted 
p-values for the 8 null hypotheses at the final analysis. Per communication from FDA on July 23, 
2019 , it was suggested to sponsor to introduce a small penalty for the interim analysis because of the unblinded analysis of the efficacy data even  though the interim analysis were not to stop 
for efficacy. Therefore, a small penalty for th e interim analysis (1-sided alpha of 0.0001) is 
introduced here and  a null hypothesis will be rejected if the intersec tion p-values for all 
intersection hypotheses containing this particular null hypothesis are less than or equal to a 1-
sided D=0.0249. 
A detailed description of the computation of the intersection p-values will be provided in the 
SAP. 
The proposed decision rules in the adaptive design  ensure overall Type I error rate control with 
respect to the primary and key secondary endpoints.  The Type I error rate control is maintained 
even if the target number of events is increased or a decision to restrict the patient enrollment to 
the subpopulation of pSTAT3(+) patients is made at the interim analysis.

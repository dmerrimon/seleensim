AMENDMENT RATIONALE AND SUMMARY:  
 
This amendment adjusts timing of consent and enrollment visits to minimize the time 
lapse in between these two occurrences (~3 months). After careful review, waiting about three months between consent and enrollment can askew data and cause patient behavioral changes.  
 
1. Edited exclusion criteria in section 3.2.2 to exclude patients with no computers or 
Bluetooth capabilities as those are required for the study.  
2. Edited schema in section 4.1 and changed “Day on enrollment” to “Baseline Visit”  
3. Edited section 4.2 to include:  
a. The possibility of contacting physician -identified patient’s via telephone 
to assess interest and obtain verbal consent.  
b. In-person interactions will now allow coordinator to approach possible 
subjects to introduce the study prior to consent 
c. A third phone call to remind patient of fasting prior to the post-intervention visit 
d. Clarification that all subjects will now receive reminder emails to sync Fitbit and log into UNC CHART  
4. Edited section 4.3 to reflect re-adjustment of timing of consent & enrollment visits so these can occur on the same day.  
5. Removed mentions of GPAQ show cards and Appendix 2 and 3 in the protocol 
(section 4.3 and section 5.1)

 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Study Synopsis  
Overweight and obese endometrial cancer (EC) survivors at UNC -CH will be approached for tailored 
feedback  fitness i ntervention. We aim to enroll 36 evaluable women (18 in each arm) to evaluate if receipt 
of weekly tailored feedback  messages can improve phy sical activity in EC survivors. We anticipate 
enrolling 39 participants to be able to evaluate 36. We hypothesize women receiving the feedback  message 
intervention will increase step counts from baseline more than 2,000 steps  compared to women in the non-
intervention arm. 
1.2 Background 
In 2016, approximately 60,050 new cases of EC will be diagnosed with 10,470 women dying from EC 
(1). EC incidence in the United States has been increasing largely due to a combination of an aging population and increasing adolescent and adult obesity. In our recent multi -institutional analysis of 1400 
EC patients treated over 5 years, 66% of our EC pati ents were obese, and 85% were overweight/obese (2). 
Obesity, diabetes, and insulin resistance contribute to the development of EC through hormonal alterations resulting in an estrogen dominant sta te, as well as through hyperinsulinemia and elevated serum glucose 
levels causing increased cellular proliferation and tumor growth (3-5). In addition to driving cancer 
development, obesity is associated with an increased risk of death in EC patients (6-9). Morbidly obese 
women with EC have a 6.25- fold increased risk of death from EC as compared to their non- obese 
counterparts (7). Fortunately, many ECs are diagnosed at an early stage and able to be fully treated via 
hysterectomy +/ - radiation. As a result, three years following their diagnosis, EC patients are more likely 
to die from cardiovascular causes due to significant medical co -morbidities than from EC (10).  
  
EC Survivor Knowledge and Readiness. Given the strong relationship between EC  and obesity, we 
recently conducted a survey study of EC survivors to assess their knowledge of the relationship between 
EC and obesity (11). We found that only 46% of responders knew of the link between obesity and EC. 
There is evidence to suggest that the time of cancer diagnosis represents a “teachable moment” where patients are more motivated to make behavioral change (12, 13) . Indeed, we found that majority (70%) of 
women desired to live a healthier lifestyle after their EC diagnosis (11). Despite this reported desire, only 
52% of patients attempted weight loss and only 48% of patients attempted to increase physical activity. Survivors who did not attempt weight loss cited a lack of time, money or knowledge of how to lose weight. Survivors were most likely to attempt behavioral change 3 to 6 months following their diagnosis.   Physical Activity and Weight Loss. Weight loss is attained through a combination of physical activity 
and diet. Specifically, an individual must increase one’s metabolic expenditure and reduce caloric intake in order to maintain weight loss. Modest sustained weight loss of approximately 10 kg has been shown to result in improved health outcomes (14). While both diet and physical activity are critical to sustained 
weight loss, physical activity appears to be particularly important to improving cardiovascular health. In 
fact, increasing levels of physical activity and fitness have been shown to have health benefits, even in the absence of weight loss in obese patients (15, 16). Further, increasing physical activity by 2000 steps per 
day (or a 20 minute walk at moderate pace) is associated with a 10% reduction in long- term cardiovascular 
events (defined as cardiovascular mortality, stroke, or myocardial infarction) (17). Thus, in EC survivors 
with significant risk of cardiovascular mortality, we will focus on increasing physical activity as the primary intervention of our study.

 Activity Trackers and Physical Activity. It has been well reported that step -based physical activity 
programs can effectively and safely increase physical activity in s edentary individuals (18-20). Activity 
trackers represent the ideal accelerometer as they can track steps, calories, heart rate, and other parameters 
overtime that can be used by researchers or providers to monitor activity through web- based interfaces. 
Further, activity trackers have the added advantage of allowing women to perform self -monitoring of their 
behavior change, which has been shown to be mor e effective in similar populations (21-23).  
 CHART and Tailored Feedback.  The Carolina Health Assessment and Resource Tool or CHART has 
been successfully ut ilized in a variety of settings to facilitate behavior change. CHART has available 
modules for wearable activity trackers, physical activity and weight. The modules provide users with individual assessment and tailored feedback to promote behavior change. Further, the CHART wearables module has been applied effectively to provide weekly tailored feedback in both AA men (iMOVEIt) and childcare providers (CARE2bFit). Both studies showed improved self -monitoring compliance and modest 
changes in physical activi ty. Men using wearables had about 600 more steps per day, while women in the 
CARE2bfit program increased their MVPA by 60% (12 to 20 minutes per day) through the middle three weeks of the study, but decreased back to week 1 levels as the program concluded. This tool has not been 
previously evaluated in EC patients, who appear highly motivated following their cancer diagnosis. Thus, we propose a physical activity intervention in the EC survivor population, using weekly tailored feedback to increase steps per  day using a wearable activity tracker .  
 
1.3 Purpose and Rationale 
Given that overweight and obese women diagnosed with EC are more likely to die from cardiovascular 
causes of death than from EC, weight loss and physical activity in the EC survivor population is critical. 
We have previously shown that EC survivors are motivated to make behavioral change following their 
cancer diagnosis, but have a low success rate of increasing physical activity and losing weight without intervention. Tailored feedback  interventions have been shown to be helpful in motivating behavioral 
change in other populations. Thus, we propose a t ailored feedback and activity tracker  intervention to 
increase physical activity in EC survivors.   
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  AND ENDPOINTS   
2.1 Primary Objective: To assess if a tailored feedback  fitness intervention can increase physical activity 
in EC survivors from baseline to 12 weeks post-baseline.  
2.2 Exploratory Objective(s):  
2.2.1 To determine the acceptability of the fitness intervention in EC survivors through completion 
survey.  
2.2.2 To assess if a tailored feedback  message fitness intervention  can (1) decrease BMI, (2) reduce 
waist to hip (W/H) ratios, (3) improve quality of life (QOL) and (4) improve serum metabolic 
markers (insulin, glucose, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels) in EC survivors.

 4.0 STUDY PLAN  
5.0 Schema  
 
This is a randomized controlled pilot study of 39 total participants to ensure 36 evaluable datasets (n=18 
per arm) of overweight or obese patients with endometrial cancer. The primary purpose of this study is 
to evaluate the change from baseline of daily steps in women randomized to the tailored feedback  
message fitness intervention. We anticipate  a patient ’s active participation will last approximately 12 
weeks .  
 
5.1 Duration of Study  
Patients enrolled in this study will participate for approximately 12 weeks. The participants will be 
consented at the end of their cancer treatment.  The participant will remain on study until their next clinic 
visit (~3 months).   
 There will be  up to three in-person interactions with the patients in this study : during a clinic visit where 
the study is introduced, on the day of the baseline visit,  and at the time of their 3-month follow up or 
post-intervention visit.  Patients will be approached by the study coordinator for participation in this study during routine clinic visits .   If a provider identifies eligible patients  in advance of their scheduled 
visit and notifies the study coordinator, the study coordinator will contact the patient via telephone prior to their clinic visit to introduce the study and assess interest. If the patient is interested, the study coordinator will obtain a telephone consent.  At the next scheduled visit, the study coordinator will 
obtain the patient’s signed  consent and provide a  physical hardcopy of their signed consent form to the 
patient  prior to initiating  any study activities .

There wi ll also be three phone call s from the study team: prior to the baseline visit  to remind  the patie nt 
to fast for blood collection, at the end of week 1 to ensure successful use of the fitness tracker , and prior 
to the post- intervention visit to remind the patient to fast again . For all subjects, study staff plans to send 
out email reminders so they can sync their Fitbits in time and log into UNC CHART to ensure data quality.  
5.2 Study Details  
Women with endometrial cancer, at the end of  cancer treatment, will b e recruited from the Gynecologic 
Oncology clinic at UNC -CH (see inclusion/exclusion criteria above). The standard care of a woman 
diagnosed with endometrial cancer is to undergo treatment with hysterectomy followed by possible adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy in high risk or advanced stage cancer. Following completion of therapy, a patient is seen by her oncologist every 3 months in the first 2 years following treatment for 
cancer surveillance. We aim to identify women within 6 months of treatment completio n, generally at the 
initial surveillance visit. Women meeting enrollment criteria will be approached for consent. Enrolled women will receive a Fitbit fitness tracker and be instructed in how to use UNC CHART . Study staff will 
spend time with each particip ant to help them access CHART , learn to see messages, and set-up and use 
of the fitness tracker. All participants will keep the fitness tracker after completion of the study as token of appreciation for their participation.   At the baseline visit, patient ’s baseline height and weight will be obtained. Blood pressure and baseline 
heart rate will also be documented . Baseline BMI will be calculated. In addition to BMI, the W/H ratio 
will be evaluated. The W/H ratio is defined as the waist circumference in cen timeters divided by the hip 
circumference in centimeters. W/H may be a better predictor of cardiovascular morbidity than BMI as it takes into account abdominal adiposity (25). The proper technique for measurement of the waist and hip 
circumference is to have the subject stand with both feet together and arms at the side without bulky clothing. Measurements should be taken at the end of expiration and be repeated twice using st retch -
resistant measuring tape. Both measurements should be within 1cm of each other and the average value used. The waist measurement is taken midway between the last palpable rib and the top of the iliac crest. The hip measurement is taken at the widest portion of the buttock with the tape parallel to the floor (26). 
W/H ratio at baseline will be calculated .  
 After t he above measurements and vitals are taken, p atients will complete an enrollment survey  including 
the GPAQ survey to measure baseline activity  and baseline FACT -G assessment  (27, 28) . Pre-intervention 
FACT -G total score and sub- scale scores (physical well -being, social well -being, emotional well -being 
and functional well -being) will be compared to post -interventi on scores. Finally, baseline fasting glucose, 
insulin and LDL will be obtained at the time of study baseline activities . Blood and urine will be collected 
and stored for potential future metabolomic profiling.  Patients will then be randomized to either receive 
or not receive tailored feedback messages through UNC CHART. Participants randomized to the message 
arm will begin receiving encouragement and reminder UNC CHART messages to increase physical 
activity  weekly based on the CHART algorithm (Appendix 1).  Participants on the feedback  arm will 
receive 1 message per week during the 3-month study period.  
 For the first week after initiating the study , each patient’s baseline step count will be obtained from the 
fitness tracker. The mean step count over these 7 days will represent the patient’s baseline step count. After the baseline week is completed , the study team will contact patients to ensure successful use of 
technology.

 At the time of next follow up visit, the patient will undergo repeat weight, height, waist circumference, 
and hip circumference assessment. Heart rate and blood pressure will also be recorded at the follow up 
visit.  The patient will complete a post- intervention acceptability survey and complete a post -intervention 
FACT -G assessment . Post- intervention fasting glucose, insulin, and LDL will be performed. Urine and 
blood will also be banked via the Tissue Procurement Facility (TPF) at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) for future  metabolomic profiling . 
5.3 Expected Risks  
5.3.1 Physical Harm:  The risk of physical injury related to increasing physical activity in sedentary 
individuals is low. Similar trials have been conducted in high- risk coronary artery disease 
patients without adverse events. Patients with untreated cardiac symptoms (angina, palpitations) or poorly controlled pulmonary comorbidities (such as COPD or asthma) will be excluded. There is a potential for musculoskeletal or joint injury with increased physical activity. However, there are no reported injuries in multiple large randomized trials  (29-31).  
 
5.3.2 Blood Drawing:  Patients will need to undergo blood draws at baseline and post -intervention. 
Risks to blood draws are minimal and include pain and discomfort, infection and 
hematoma/bruising. Thus, women have little increased risk secondary to blood collection. Blood work will be obtained by trained staff  trained hospital staff  at the time of clinic visits.  
 
5.3.3 Urine Collection: Patients will need to undergo urine collection at baseline and post-
intervention. Risks to urine collection are minimal and include a small risk of infection. Thus, 
women have little increased risk secondary to urine collection. 
 
5.3.4 Breach of Confidentiality: The major risk to participants  included in this study is data security 
and confidentiality. Data will be stored in a secure, password -protected server  accessible solely 
to trained study staff. The Study Coordinator will be trained and certified in research ethics and 
HIPAA tenets . All data and specimens will be given a unique research ID that will be blinded to 
investigators with the exception of the Study Coordinator, who will function as an honest broker. 
UNC CHART does not contain any identifying information, subjects are identified through study ID. Subjects must log on to UNC CHART to receive message, UNC CHART will not have email or smart phone contact information.  
5.4 Removal of Patients from Protocol  
Patients will be removed from the protocol if musculoskeletal injury is incurre d. Patient will also be 
removed from the protocol at patient request. The patients will receive a phone call following week 1 to 
assess for adverse events, but will not be contacted in weeks 2 -12 to minimize bias from the Hawthorne 
effect of repetitive pho ne calls while on trial.  Patients will be instructed to contact study personnel if 
any concern for injury or adverse event related to trial enrollment and be removed from study.

7.0 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
7.1 Definition  
As defined by UNC’s IRB, unanticipated problems involving risks to study subjects or others (UPIRSO) refers to any incident, experience, or outcome that: 
• Is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;
 
• Is related or possibly related to a subject’s participation in the research; and  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) related to the research than was previously known or recognized.

 7.2 Reporting  
Any UPIRSO  that occurs during the conduct of this study and that meets all three criteria  listed in 6.1 
must be reported to the UNC IRB using the IRB’s web- based reporting system.    
 
8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Study Design  
This is a randomized, single -center, tailored feedback message intervention trial. The project will use 
fitness trackers to measure increase in physical activity from baseline in women randomized to receive 
weekly motivational feedback messages.  A control group will receive a fitness tracker but no feedback 
message reinforcement.  The primary objective of the study is to detect a 2,000 mean daily step increase 
from baseline in patients undergoing the feedback message intervention. Therefore, patients will be 
randomized, 1:1 using a 6-block scheme.   Exploratory objectives include gathering  data on the acceptability of the intervention, as well as desired 
frequency, timing, and content of messages for use in a larger trial.  Additionally, outcomes that will be the goal of a larger trial will be explored.  These endpoints include: BMI, waist/hip ratio, QOL as measured by FACT -G, and serum metabolic markers (fasting insulin, glucose, and LDL). 
8.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
Prior studies and systematic reviews have shown participant standard deviations in daily steps of approximately 1300 -1800 steps/day (20, 30, 32). Furthermore, previous studies measuring the impact of 
similar interventions on patient fitness levels have observed a patient step count change score standard deviation of approximately 1700 steps/day (29), where change score is defined as the change in step count from baseline to a particular week post -baseline. To determine whether there is a significant increase in 
physical activity among patients receiving the feedback  messaging intervention v ersus those that do not 
receive the intervention, we will compare participant change scores between the each arm in our study.  Assuming a participant change score standard deviation of 1800 steps/day, we estimate that 15 women will provide 80% power to de tect a 2000 -step difference in change score between arms (30), utilizing a 
two-sided Wilcoxon Two- Sample test with an alpha of 0.05. Within each arm, we will have sufficient 
power with n = 15 subjects to determine whether change scores within an arm are significantly different from zero, and we estimate that we will  have >95% power to detect a change score of at least 2000 
steps/day using a two -sided Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, assuming an alpha of 0.05 and a patient change 
score standard deviation of 1800 steps/day. We will also perform similar tests utilizing change  scores 
computed at 4 weeks and 8 weeks post -baseline to determine whether these effects appear earlier on during 
the intervention period. We will also directly examine linear trends in daily step count with respect to time in days, as well as the overall three month average change in step count from baseline, via linear mixed 
models.  Prior similar fitness intervention noted a 5% attrition rate in a large trial over 6 months time (29). 
To make a conservative estimate we will allow for 20% attrition and thus aim to enroll 39 total  patients  
to obtain 36 evaluable datasets  (18 patients in each arm).  All power calculations were computing using 
G*Power software version 3.1.9.2 (33). 
8.3 Data Analysis Plans  
Our primary objective will be measured by comparing patients baseline step counts (defined as the mean step count recorded by the fitness tracker for each participant in the first 7 days following enrollment) to week 12 (final week of study participation ) step counts. The week 12 step counts will also be the mean 
step count recorded by the fitness tracker over 7 days in a participant’s  final week on the study. The

 mean change in steps in the intervention group will be compared to the no-intervention group using a 
Wilcoxon Two- sample test.   
 
For our exploratory objectives: 
Acceptability of the intervention will be measured, as previously reported, using the results of a post -
intervention Likert scale survey (29). At stu dy conclusion, patients randomized to the feedback messaging 
arm will complete a post -intervention survey regarding the acceptability of the invention. Question #1 of 
the post-intervention survey will ask patients about the acceptability of the interventio n using a 5-point 
Likert scale. The completion survey will also include information about desired frequency of messages, desired content of messages, and timing of messages. The information obtained in this portion of the study will allow improvements to b e made in our intervention prior to implementation of a larger randomized 
trial. The acceptability of the intervention will be defined as the proportion of patients answering favorably (very helpful or somewhat helpful) to question #1 on the completion survey. We aim to have 80% acceptability. Previous surveys of adults have shown 81% to find mobile health interventions acceptable (34). We will report the proportion of subjects reporting favorable responses to question #1 on the 
completion survey and the corresponding 95% CI. 
 
Finally, we will look for decrease in BMI, improved W/H ratio, improved QOL, and improved serum metabolic markers. These data will be preliminarily evaluated in this pilot study, but will represent the 
primary endpoints of interest in the randomized trial to be conducted following completion of this pilot . 
Basic descriptive and comparative statistics will be performed to evaluate BMI, QOL, W/H ratio and insulin/glucose/LDL levels as exploratory endpoints at each time point, in addition to the change in each 
exploratory endpoint between time points. All com puted descriptive statistics would be stratified by study 
arm. 
 
8.4 Data Management /Audit  
Data will be collected and stored in an Excel spreadsheet and stored on the departmental J drive in a 
password- protected  document for security.  
 As an investigator initiated study, this trial will also be audited by the Lineberger Cancer Center audit committee every six or twelve months, depending on the participation of affiliate sites.  
9.0 STUDY MANAGEMENT  
9.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval and Consent  
It is expected  that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance with federally 
mandated regulations.  The IRB should approve the consent form and protocol. 
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the  applicable 
regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
   
Before enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required by the FDA Regulations and local or state regulations. Once this essential information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing an IRB -approved consent form.

Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by the patient and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion. 
9.2 Required Documentation  
Before the study can be initiated at any site, the following documentation must be provided to the Office of Clinical & Translational Research (OCTR)  at the University of North Carolina. 
• A copy of the official IRB approval letter for the protocol  
• A copy o f the IRB -approved consent form 
9.3 Registration Procedures  
All subjects must be registered with the Lineber ger Comprehensive Cancer Center, and entered into the 
web based clinical research platform, Oncore
®. 
9.4 Adherence to the Protocol  
Except for an emergency s ituation in which proper care for the protection, safety, and well-being of the 
study patient requires alternative treatment, the study shall be conducted exactly as described in the approved protocol.   
9.4.1 Emergency Modifications  
UNC investigators may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an 
immediate hazard(s) to trial subjects without prior UNC IRB approval.  
 
For any such emergency modification implemented, a UNC IRB modification form must be completed  
by UNC Research Personnel  within five (5) business days of making the change.   
9.4.2 Single Patient/Subject Exceptions  
Eligibility single subject exceptions are not permitted for Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center 
Investigator Initiated Trials under any circumstances. Other types of single subject exceptions may be allowed if proper regulatory review has been completed in accordance with Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Single Subject Exceptions Policy . 
9.4.3 Other Protocol Deviations/Violations  
According to UNC’s IRB, a protocol deviation is any unplanned variance from an IRB approved 
protocol that:  
• Is generally noted or recognized after it occurs  
• Has no substantive effect on the risks to research participants  
• Has no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan or the value of the data collected  
• Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the investigator(s).  
 
An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation if  the variance meets any of the following 
criteria:  
• Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more research participants.  
• Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study. 
• Results from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the investigator(s).

If a deviation or violation occurs please follow the guidelines below:  
 
Protocol Deviations: UNC personnel will record the deviation in OnCore®  (or other appropriate 
database set up for the study), and report to any sponsor or data and safety monitoring committee in accordance with their policies.  Deviations should be summarized and reported to the IRB at the time of continuing review.  Protocol Violations: Violations should be reported by UNC personnel within one (1) week of the investigator becoming aware of the event using the same IRB online mechanism used to repor t UPIRSO .   
 
Unanticipated Problems  Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPIRSO : 
Any events that meet the criteria for “Unanticipated Problems” as defined by UNC’s IRB (see section 
6.1) must be reported by the Study Coordinator using the IRB’s web-based reporting system.   
9.5 Amendments to the Protocol  
Should amendments to the protocol be required, the amendments will be originated and documented by the Principal Investigator at UNC.  It should also be noted that when an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design or the potential ris k to the patient, a revised consent form might be 
required.    The written amendment, and if required the amended consent form, must be sent to UNC’s IRB for approval prior to implementation.   
9.6 Record  Retention  
Study documentation includes all Case Report Forms, data correction forms or queries, source documents, Sponsor-Investigator correspondence, monitoring logs/letters, and regulatory documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, IRB correspondence and approval, signed patient consent forms).  Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities and all reports 
and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical research study.  
 Government agency regulations and directives require that all study documentation pertaining to the conduct of a clinical trial must be retained by the study investigator.  In the case of a study with a drug seeking regulatory approval and marketing, these documents shall be retained for at least two years after the last approval of marketing application in an International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
region.  In all other cases, study documents should be kept on file until three years after the completion and final study report of this investigational study.

Test Product, Dose,  and Mode of Administration:   
OPK -8800 3 and placebo  are supplied for once -weekly SC injection.   OPK -88003  or 
placebo  will be  initially administered for 4 weeks at 20 mg QW  followed by  4 weeks at 40 
mg QW  followed by 70 mg QW for 22 weeks .  There are  no restrictions on the time of day 
each dose is given but it is advisable to administer SC injections on the same day and time 
of the week for the full 30 -week treatment period .  Study drug should not be administered 
within four days of the previous injec tion.   
Duration of Treatment:   
OPK -8800 3 or placebo will be administered for 30 weeks.   Each subject may participate in 
the study for up to 36 weeks  (including screen ing phase and follow -up).  
Efficacy Assessments : 
The primary efficacy measure is HbA1c  (absolute change from baseline) .  Secondary 
efficacy measures include: body weight (mean change from baseline and % of subjects 
with > 5% loss from baseline to endpoint), F PG, number and % subjects achieving HbA1c 
≤6.5. 
Safety Assessments:  
Safety assessments include all AEs , vital signs, ECG monitoring,  and development of anti -
drug antibodies  (ADA) . 
Statistical Methods : 
Sample size: A total of 110 subjects  will be randomized  at a ratio 1.75:1  to OPK -88003 
(70 subject s) and placebo ( 40 subject s).  48 subject s in the active arm and 27 subject s in 
the placebo arm will provide at least 90% power to detect superior glycemic control over 
placebo represented by -0.8% in HbA1c l evels a fter 30 weeks of treatment .  This assumes 
a commo n standa rd deviation (SD) of 1.0 % and a two-sided alpha of 0. 05.   
Efficacy :  The primary efficacy outcome of HbA1c change from baseline to the 30 -week 
endpoint will be performed on the mITT analysis set.  The primary efficacy outcome will 
be analyzed using linear  contrasts from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)  model with 
treatment  arm and BMI strata  as factors and the baseline HbA1c value as a covariate .  An 
additional supportive analysis of the p rimary efficacy outcome will be  a mixed -model 
repeated -measures (M MRM) .  The factors in the model will be BMI strata , treatment 
group, baseline value, visit, and the treatment group by visit interactions. .  Additional

 covariates may be added and will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan ( SAP). 
The mean percent we ight change from baseline a t the 30 week  endpoint  will be analyzed 
using similar dose response models as the primary analysis.  A logistic regression analysis 
will be performed for the percent of subjects with 5% or greater body weight loss with 
treatment and HbA1c and BMI strata as fixed effects, and baseline weight as a covariate.   
Comparisons between treatment groups for the number and percent of subjects achieving 
HbA1c ≤6.5 will be performed for responses a fter 30 weeks treatment with LOCF based 
on a l ogistic regression model with a factors for treatment group and BMI strata and 
baseline HbA1c as a covariate.  
Study Duration and Dates:  
The trial is expected to commenc e recruitment during Q1 2018  and recruitment is expected 
to take approximately 5 months.

 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive disease characterized by insulin resistance 
and loss of β-cell function.  Obesity is a major contributor to the progression of insulin 
resistance in T2DM.  Correlations between adiposity and insulin resistance have been 
reported in both adults and children.  Thus,  there is a need for the development of therapies 
that target both body weight and poor glycemic control.  
1.1.1 Incretins 
Incretin mimetics class of glucose -lowering drugs offer an alternative approach to the 
treatment of T2DM with moderate efficacy in lowering glycosylated hemoglobin A1c 
(HbA1c) and favorable weight loss.  Glu cagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1), an endogenous 
incretin hormone, regulates postprandial glycemia by stimulating insulin secretion, inhibiting 
glucagon secretion, promoting satiety and reducing  weight gain via both peripheral and 
central activation of the glucagon -like protein-1 receptor (GLP-1R) (Campbell & Drucker 
2013).   
While fasting plasma levels of endogenous GLP -1 are normal in subjects with T2DM, they  
are diminished post -prandially (Baggio & Drucker 2007 ).  GLP-1 is rapidly degraded by the 
protease dipeptidyl peptidase -IV (DPP-IV) resulting in a ha lf-life of approximately 1 -2 
minutes in both healthy and subjects with T2 DM (Deacon et al 1995).  Since the 
glucoregulatory actions of GLP -1 remain intact in patients with T2DM, current therapeutic 
strategies have focused on analogs with improved metabolic stability and reduced clearance.  
1.1.2 Oxyntomodulin 
Oxyntomodulin (OXM) is a 37 -amino acid peptide hormone that is released postprandially, 
along with GLP-1, from the L-cells of the small intestine in proportion to energy intake.  
OXM reduces body weight in obese patients as a result of enhanced satiety an d increased 
energy expenditure ( Wynne et al 2010).  The satiety-inducing effects of OXM are believed to 
be mediated through the activation of the GLP -1R, since its anorectic effects in rodents are 
blocked by co-administration of the GLP-1R antagonist exendin (9 -39) and are not observed 
in Glp1r-/- mice (Baggio et al 2004, Sowden et al 2007, Wynne et al 2010).  Other effects of 
OXM, including further improvement of β -cell function and increased energy expenditure 
have been attributed to the glucagon receptor ( GcgR) pathway (Kosinski et al 2012).  
Chronic infusion of OXM had superior w eight loss and comparable glucose lowering to 
OXMQ3E (an OXM analog which has no significant GcgR agonist activity) in diet induced 
obese (DIO) mice (Kosinski et al 2012).  Moreover, OXM improves glucose tolerance and 
stimulates insulin secretion in mice ( Maida et al 2008) further suggesting a role for OXM in 
glucose homeostasis.

 1.1.3  OPK -88003  
OPK -88003  is a long -acting  polyethylene -glycol (PEG) -conjugated (PEGylated) synthetic 
peptide analog of mammalian OXM .  Similar to native OXM, OPK -88003  binds and 
activates both the GLP -1R and the GcgR.  In addition to the well -documented insulin 
secretion -promoting and glucose -lowering effects of GLP -1R agonists, OPK -88003  may 
have additional benefits via its action on the GcgR, including effects on satiety and weight 
loss.  Among currently available therapies for T2DM, GLP -1 agonists are most effective in 
glycemic control with favorable effects on body weight and without the risk of 
hypoglycemia.   However, the weight lo ss with GLP -1 agonists is modest due to dose -
dependent gastrointestinal (GI) side effects.  OPK -88003  is designed to improve upon 
existing GLP -1 agonists by offering both non-inferior glycemic control and superior weight 
management.   
1.2 Nonclinical Studies  
Nonclinical studies support that OPK -88003  may be safely administered to subjects with 
T2DM.  The toxicity profile of OPK -88003  has been characterized in rat s and monkey s using 
sub-chronic and chronic repeat -dose toxicity , and safety pharmacology studies.  The 
nonclinical testing program has followed a standard development pathway for a chronically 
used biological product.   
Safety pharmacology evaluations including central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular  
(CV) , and respiratory assessments were performed  in monkeys at doses up to 5 mg/kg.  The 
no observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL ) for effects on CNS, CV, and respiratory safety 
pharmacology in the monkey was 5 mg/kg.  Because OPK -88003  is a synthetic peptide, no 
genetic toxicity studies were conducted.   
OPK -88003 -related changes in both rat and monkey repeat -dose toxicity studies (4 and 26 
weeks in duration) were generally consistent with, or secondary to, typical GLP -1R agonist 
pharmacology.  In the 4 -week studies, OPK -88003  was injected SC twice -weekl y (BIW) 
with doses of 1.5 to 15 mg/kg and 0.5 to 5 mg/kg in rats and monkeys, respectively.  
Important findings were limited to reversible pharmacodynamic (PD) reductions in food 
consumption, with secondary decreases in body weight at all doses in rats and  the high -dose 
in monkeys.  The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) and NOAELs for target organ toxicity 
were 15 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively.   
In the 26 -week studies, SC OPK -88003  doses of 0.3 to 3.0 mg/kg and 0.5 to 5.0 mg/kg BIW  
were evaluated in rats and m onkeys, respectively.  The primary effects were dose -dependent 
decreases in food consumption with secondary decreases in body weight gain.  The NOAELs 
for target organ toxicity in chronic repeat -dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys were 3 
mg/kg and 1. 5 mg/kg, respectively.

 1.3 Previous Human Experience  
OPK -88003 has been investigated for the treatment of patients with T2DM and 
accompanying unhealthy body weight as a once -weekly (QW) subcutaneous (SC) 
administrati on.  Cumulatively, 402 subjects  have receive d OPK -88003  to date in the clinical 
program .  Single and multiple ascending doses up to 60 mg QW were tested in a two -part, 
phase 1 double –blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, clinical pharmacology trial DPO -101.  
Doses ranging from 10 mg to 50 mg per we ek were tested in a 24 -week double -blind (for the 
first 12 weeks), randomized, placebo - and active comparator (2  mg exenatide ER) -controlled 
phase 2 trial XNAA.  Supratherapeutic multiple SC doses of 40 mg once daily for 7 days and 
titrated doses of 15 to 60 mg over 6 days were tested in a double -blind, placebo controlled 
clinical pharmacology study XNAB.  
Clinical data from the phase 1 trial DPO -101 indicated that QW SC administration of OPK -
88003 produced an improvement in HbA1c and fasting glucose and res ulted in progressive 
decrease in body weight.  Changes from baseline in body weight after 5 weeks of dosing in 
T2DM and obese non -diabetic patients ranged from -1.55 kg to -2.23 kg, compared with        
-0.81 kg in the placebo group for dose levels between 25 mg to 60 mg.  Gluc ose tolerance 
and fasting plasma  glucose (F PG) were significantly improved in  subjects with T2DM.  
In the phase 2 trial , XNAA administration of OPK -88003 at 10, 15, 30 and 50 mg doses QW 
for 6 m onths in subjects with T2DM resulted in dose -dependent effects on blood glucose and 
body weight reduction.  Statistically significant reduction in mean HbA1c (up to 1.43%) was 
observed for all doses at 12 and 24 weeks.  OPK -88003 significantly decreased Hb A1c levels 
versus placebo and was non -inferior to 2 mg exenatide ER at the 30 mg and 50 mg doses 
(p=0.994 and 0.628, respectively).  Greater reductions in FBG with OPK -88003 resulted in 
similar 7 -point self -monitored blood glucose (SMBG) profile values com pared to treatment 
with exenatide ER and lower values compared to placebo.  
OPK -88003 also produced a dose -dependent weight loss of up to 3.3 kg by week 24.  In 
comparison to placebo and exenatide ER, OPK -88003  50 mg resulted in statistically 
significant p ercent change in body weight from baseline at 12 (p<0.001 and p=0.011, 
respectively) and 24 (p= 0.007 and p=0.05, respectively) weeks.  At least twice as many 
OPK -88003 -50 mg (35.5%) subjects  lost ≥5% of their body weight compared to placebo 
(11.8%) (p=0.0 04) and exenatide ER (18.3%) (p=0.025) by week 24.   
Safety findings were consistent with what would be expected from a GLP -1 agonist effect.  
The most frequent OPK -88003 dose -related adverse events (AEs) have been GI symptoms, 
including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and decreased appetite.  Most of the events were single 
episodes, mild in severity, transient and self -limited.  These events occurred most commonly 
after the first dose and the incidence then declined to near control levels by the fourth weekly 
dose.  Rates of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were dose -dependent with moderate 
tolerability at the highest dose of 50 mg in study XNAA.   
Some injection site reactions (rash/redness) with OPK -88003 treatment were observed 
although the incidence was lower than for exenatide ER and the severity of the reactions

 tended to be mild or moderate with very few  severe reactions reported in 3.21% of subjects 
(9/280).  In addition, in almost all cases the reactions decreased in severity over time.  
Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) development was <4%.   
There was no evidence of a hypoglycemia -promoting effect of OPK -88003.  Potential 
pancreatic AEs occurred in 10 subjects with 11 events requiring adjudication.  Of these, only 
one event in the OPK-88003 treatment group was adjudicated to be an actual pancreatic 
event.   
Mean heart rate (HR) increased with OPK-88003 by approximately 5 beats per minute (bpm) 
in study XNAA compared to placebo, although the differences were not statistically 
significant.   
Additional safety parameters including SAEs, other treatment emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), other laboratory measurements and other vital signs were not different between 
treatment groups or were modified in a favorable direction by OPK -88003 treatment (notably 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure).   
In study XNAB, an increase in supine and standing pulse rate was observed 48 and 72 hours 
following single doses, that returned to predose values at 7 days post dose.  Mean supine and 
standing pulse rate increased an d then generally remained high up to at least 7 days after the 
final dose following repeated doses and  returned to predose values by follow -up.  The 
increases in pulse rate for individual subjects were not associated with AEs.  There was no 
indication of prolongation of QTc interval.   No additional novel safety findings, other than 
the expected increase in rate of nausea and vomiting were observed at surpatherapeutic doses 
of OPK-88003.  
1.4 Rationale for the Study  
Equivalent effects on HbA1c  and greater weight loss effects were observed for OPK -88003 
compared to exenatide  ER in the phase 2 trial XNAA.   These findings are consistent with the 
hypothesis that the additional glucagon activity associated with OPK -88003 provides 
equivalent glycemic control and superi or weight loss compared to GLP-1 modulation alone.  
Since it has been demonstrated that additional weight loss can be obtained by increasing the 
dose of GLP-1 agonists (Davies et al 2015), it seems likely that increasing the dose of OPK-
88003 will demonstrate additional weight loss benefits.  
XNAA investigated the dose -response relationship of OPK-88003 versus placebo and 
positive control exenatide ER , and established that QW injections over 24 weeks could 
reduce HbA1c by up to 1.43 % and weight by up to 3.3 kg.  The severity of the OPK -88003 
AE profile observed so far, including the 50 mg QW dose tested in the phase 2 trial, does not 
outweigh the anticipated favorable benefits on glucose and body weight.  Thus, the benefit -
risk balance of OPK-88003 supports additional clinical testing of OPK -88003 at doses higher 
than 50 mg QW.

 There was also a dose -dependent increase in GI side effects  with higher OPK -88003 doses  in 
prior human studies , however, these effects were transient in nature .  In efforts to optimize 
OPK -88003  for glucose control and body weight reduction, it is likely that dose escalation 
could be key for reducing GI side effects  through gradual up -titration of doses to target dose  
levels .  Other GLP -1 agonists, such as liraglutide QD  (once daily)  and semaglutide QW , 
show that when slow dose  escalation is implemented, higher doses are achieved and the rates 
of patients reporting GI disorders can be significantly reduced.  In the multiple ascending 
dose portion of the phase 1 trial in diabetic s DPO -101, GI tolerability of OPK -88003 was 
improved with the use of a titration regimen for 60 mg QW.  Thus, it is reasonable to 
anticipate that a slower dose -escalation regimen will exhibit improved tolerability t o nausea 
and vomiting at dose levels higher than the 50 mg dose administered in the previous phase 2 
trial (XNAA).  As such, for this trial, a slow dose -titration schedule over 8 weeks will be 
employed to help mitigate the gastrointestinal AEs.  
1.4.1  Rationale for Dose Selection  
Study  DPO -203 will include OPK -88003 target dose  of 70 mg administered weekly .  Based 
on data from  subjects  with T2DM in study XNAA, the 70 mg QW dose is anticipated to 
produce maximal reduction in fasti ng glucose and HbA1c and yield a greater weight loss 
than the 50 mg QW dose from the dose -range finding phase 2 trial.  
The 70 mg QW dose level will be administered using a fixed dose escalation schedule over 8 
weeks.  Plasma levels of OPK -88003 reach stead y state over 5 weeks with the accumulation 
ratio for Cmax and area under the curve ( AUC ) up to 2.6 -fold.  Thus, it is reasonable to apply 
slow dose titration with dose escalation every 4 weeks.  For the first 4 weeks of dose 
escalation subjects will receiv e 20 mg followed by 4 weeks of 40 mg administered QW.  
Safety and tolerability from the previous phase 2 trial support evaluation of the dose levels 
planned for the 8 -week dose escalation period.  
A population PK model with a first order absorption and fir st order elimination, along with 
inter-individual variability for all PK parameters was used to simulate the proposed 70 mg 
QW dose.  This dose is 33% higher (for  Cmax and AUC) when compared to the 50 mg dose 
that had acceptable safety and tolerability over 24 weeks.  Simulated PK exposures derived 
from XNAA modeling in conjunction with the phase 1 XNAB trial with supratherapeut ic 
exposures and nonclinical safety margins  support a multiple dose of 70 mg, administered 
QW,  in the targeted population.  
OPK -88003 at the target level of 70 mg QW dose at steady state following dose titration 
(week 30) is predicted to have mean Cmax value of 3755 ng/mL and AUC value of 560

 µg•h/mL based on population  PK modeling  of the proposed titrated dosing regimen 
(20 mg/40  mg/70  mg QW) .  In the c linical pharmacology  trial XNAB  multiple SC doses of 
40 mg administered daily for 7 days resulted in supratherapeutic exposures.  The geometric 
mean  Cmax of OPK -88003 after 7 days of dosing was 11700  ng/mL with the corresponding 
AUC of 1789 µg•h/mL.  The exposures from study XNAB were  three -fold higher than the 
modelled exposures with currently proposed titrated dosing regimen , for both Cmax and AUC.  
Supratherapeutic exposures in XNAB study persisted for approximately three  weeks after the 
last dose  due to the long terminal half -life of OPK -88003.  The once -a-day dosing regimen 
resulted in high rates of moderately severe nausea and vomiting t hat required concomitant 
medication, however most events resolved within a week after the last dose.  The intensity 
and/or duration of these events is expected to be reduced by  a slow dose titration in the 
current study.  In previous OPK -88003 trials,  there were no safety concerns reported based 
on clinical laboratory evaluations and ECGs and n o severe or serious AEs (SAEs)  at 
supratherapeutic exposures . 
The safety data from the human studies confirm dose -related, monitorable AEs related to GI 
tolerability.   Most of the events were single episodes, mild in severity, transient, and self -
limited.  These events occurred most commonly after the first dose and the incidence then 
declined to near control levels by the fourth dose, consistent with a GLP -1R agonist effect.   
Further more , studies of molecules with similar mechanism demonstrate improved tolerability 
with slow dose titration and longer duration of dosing and have not demonstrated new, 
unexpected toxicities with longer duration of dosing.  
The toxicology program for OPK -88003 provided continuous plasma exposure in rats and 
monkeys with a BIW dosing schedule and supports the proposed dosing regimen.  The safety 
margins for the 70 mg dose based on the exposures (AUC) derived from  population PK 
modeling in hu mans and the NOAELs for organ toxicity  as determined  in rats (3 mg/kg) and 
monkey s (1.5 mg/kg)  after chronic dosing  correspond to exposure multiples of 0. 7-fold and 
10-fold, respectively .   
Taking into consideration clinical efficacy and tolerability, QW doses of 70 mg are expected 
to be tolerated with slow dose -escalation and produce glycemic control and weight loss 
benefits.  The data from this trial together with the data from the previous phase 2 trial will 
enable robust benefit -risk characterizations in T2DM and will form the basis to assess the 
effect of dose escalation on OPK -88003 efficacy, safety and tolerability, and support the 
selection of dose(s) and dose regimen to be included in phase 3  trials .

Approximately 200 subjects are expected to  be screened and 110 subjects will be randomized 
to OPK -88003 and placebo in a 1.75:1 ratio.   
After randomization, the subjects will follow a fixed dose escalatio n that includes a dose 
escalation over 8 weeks .  The target dose  of 70 mg QW will be reached after receiving 20 mg 
for 4 weeks followed by 4 weeks of 40 mg QW.  A safety review of  the 70 mg QW dose 
level will be performed  by the DSMB , after which the targe t level may be reduced to 60 mg 
QW.  The study duration for individual subjects  will be up to 36  weeks .  Blinding will be 
maintained throughout the study.  
The design for study DPO -203 is illustrated in Figure 1.

Study procedure timing is outlined in the Schedule  of Events  (Appendix 1 ).  Eligibilit y of 
subjects will be based on the results of a  screening medical history, phys ical examination, 
vital signs and clinical laboratory tests.  At visit 2, e ligible subjects  will be randomized (V2) , 
receive training on study drug preparation and injection technique and conduct of routine 
SMBG , and receive their first dose of  study drug .  Subjects  will return  for 11 study visits ,  
during the 30-week treatment period .  A final safety follow -up visit 
occur s four weeks after the treatment period  (V14) .  Subjects  who develop ADA  will be 
asked to return to the clinic  approximately four months after the  last dose for an additional 
blood draw.

 Throughout the entire study, subjects  treated with metformin will remain on the same dose 
they were receiving at visit 1 , unless a temporary increase in dose is needed to treat 
hyperglycemia (see section 6.11). 
3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group  
This phase 2 trial is designed to establish the effect of a dose-escalation  regimen on  safety , 
tolerability  and efficacy of 70 mg QW OPK -88003  in subject s with T2DM, relative to  
placebo.  The study duration, target population and efficacy endpoints are typical of phase 2 
trials  and are consistent with FDA guidance1.  A four-week follow -up after the treatment 
period will ensure an adequate ti me to assess reversibility of any clinical or laboratory 
abnorma lities.  Subjects who develop ADA w ill have one additional follow -up assessment 
approximately  four months post last dose .   
This clinical study  will enroll subjects with inadequate glycemic control based on HbA1c 
values ranging from 7.0% to 10.5%, inclusive.  Similar ranges of screening HbA1c have been 
used in numerous studies of T2DM treatments.  
Subjects treated with diet and exercise alone or in combination with stable metformin 
monotherapy (≥1000 mg/day), will be enrolled.  Subjects on a second oral anti -
hyperglycemic medication (OAM) may be also be eligible if the second OAM was 
discontinued 3 months or more prior to visit 1.  Stable metformin treatment for at least 3 
months is required to minimize baseline glucose drift prior to study entry.  
3.3 Study Duration and Dates  
The study duration for individual subjects  will be up to 36 weeks and will consist of four 
phases: screening (up to 2 weeks prior to first dose), dose esca lation (8 weeks), target 
dose/ maintenanc e (22 weeks) and follow -up (4 weeks).   
The trial is expected to commence recruitment  during Q 1 2018.  Recruitment for this trial is 
expected to take approximately 5 months.

 5 DISCONTINUATIONS  
5.1 Discontinuation of Study Drug  
5.1.1 Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug  
After randomization, the investigator may decide to temporarily discontinue study drug, for 
example, due to an AE or a clinically significant laboratory value.  Every effort should be 
made by the investigator to maintain subjects in the study and to restart study drug promptly 
as soon as it is safe to d o so.  The dates of study drug discontinuation and re -start will be 
documented.  If a subject misses more than four doses of study drug throughout the course of 
the study or two consecutive doses during the dose escalation phase , they should be 
discontinued from the study (see section 5.2).  
Subject noncompliance with study drug regimen  should not be recorded as temporary  
discontinuation of study drug  (see section 7.11). 
5.1.2 Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Permanent discontinuation of the study drug during the dose escalation and maintenance 
phase should be considered by  the investigator, after consultation with the sponsor  
designated medical monitor, when the subject meets the following conditions:  
 Abnormal liver tests:  
o Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >8  x ULN 
o ALT or AST >5 x ULN for more than 2 weeks 
o ALT or AST >3 x ULN and (total bilirubin level >2  x ULN or INR >1.5) 
o ALT or AST >3 x ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper -
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%  compared to 
baseline) 
 AEs: 
o Confirmed pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer (see section 8.3.5)  
o Estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 
o Any severe injection site  reaction or two or more moderate injection site reactions 
occurring a week or more apart  (see section 8.3.1) 
o Any study drug related systemic hypersensitivity reaction (see section 8.3.2) 
o Any nonfatal major CV events (see section 8.3.6)

Confidential   
   
   
 o Any SAE or clinically significant event (CSE) judged to be related to study drug  A 
CSE is defined as a moderate to severe AE, abnormal clinical sign, or clinical 
laboratory finding that may pose a risk to the wellbeing of the subject.  A CSE will be 
determined by the investigator, and may include findings that do not fulfil the criteria 
for SAEs (Appendix 2).   
o Any other TEAE, SAE or clinical significant lab oratory value for which the 
investigator believes that permanent study drug discontinuation is the appropriate 
measure to be taken.  
 Serum calcitonin with an absolute value of ≥ 50 pg/mL on repeat testing  
 The subject intentionally or repeatedly takes more than the prescribed dose of study 
medication. 
Subjects who are permanently discontinued from study drug will be discontinued from the 
study (see section 5.2).   
5.2 Discontinuation of Subjects  
If the investigator site identifies a subject who did not meet eligibility criteria but was 
inadvertently randomized, the sponsor-designated medical monitor  must be contacted.   
If the sponsor or designee identifies a subject who did not meet enrollment criteria and who 
was inadvertently randomized, the investigator site will be notified.  A discussion must occur 
between the sponsor-designated medical monitor and the investigator to determine whether 
the subject may continue in the study.   Inadvertently randomized subjects may be maintained 
in the study when the sponsor agrees with the investigator that it is medically appropriate for 
that subject.  The investigator must obtain documented approval from  the sponsor to allow 
the inadvertently enrolled subject to continue in the study.  
A subject will be discontinued from the study in the following circumstances:  
 The subject requests to be withdrawn from the study . 
 The subject is permanently discontinued from study drug (see section 5.1.2).   
 The subject misses more than four doses of study drug  over the course of the study , or 
misses two consecutive doses of study drug during the dose escalation p hase.   
 Enrollment in any other interventional clinical trial.   
 The sponsor stops the study or stops the subject’s participation in the trial for medical, 
safety, regulatory or other  reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulations and good 
clinical practice (GCP) .

Protocol DPO-203 V3, 09 October 2018 Page 29 of 81 
 
Confidential   
   
   
  The investigator decides it is in the best interests of the subject not to continue in the 
study.   
 The subject and/or blinded study staff become unblinded to the  subject’s treatment 
assignment.   
 Any medication for weight loss is given for more than one week.   
 If the subject, for any reason requires treatment for greater than one week with another 
therapeutic agent that has been approved for treatment of diabetes.  A change in dose of 
metformin is not allowed , unless a temporary increase in dose is needed to treat 
hyperglycemia (see section 6.11).  However, a change to an equivalent dose strength of 
metformin from immediate -release to extended -release (or vice versa) formulations is 
allowed.   
Subjects discontinued from the study will be requested to complete an early termination  (ET) 
visit as soon as possible (section 9.5).  Subjects will be requested to complete a follow -up  
visit (see section 9.5) four weeks after their final dose .   
5.3 Discontinuation of Study Sites  
Study site participation may be discontinued if the sponsor or its designee, the investigator, 
or the institutional review board (IRB) of the study site judges it necessary for medical, 
safety, regulatory, or other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and GCP.    
5.4 Discontinuation of the Study  
The study will be discontinued if the sponsor or its designee judges it necessary for medical, 
safety, regulatory, or other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and GCP.   
6 STUDY TREATMENT(S)  
6.1 Randomization 
Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized to treatment at visit 2 (day 1). 
via the Interactive Response Technolog y system (IRT).  Randomization will be stratified 
using the following variables: screening HbA1c (<8.5%, ≥8.5%) and baseline BMI (<30, ≥30 
kg/m2).  The randomization to the treatment arms w ill be 1.75:1 for the active and placebo 
groups, respectively.   Following randomization, study drug will be dispensed in a double -
blinded manner. 
6.2 Description of Treatment(s)  
OPK-88003 and matching placebo are provided in single-use 2 mL glass vials with blue flip-
off lid, an aluminum seal and a rubber stopper (septum).

 maintained at each site.  If temperature excursions  occur  during shipping  or storage at site , 
study drug  should not be dispensed, and the investigator or designee should contact the  
sponsor’s designee  as soon as possible for further instruction.  
Once study drug is dispensed the subject will be instructed to t ransport  the vials in the 
provided cool container and store refrigerated  at home .  Subjects  will be instructed to return 
all used and unused vials  in cool bags  to the study  site for study drug accountability.  
The investigator or their designee(s) will maintain st udy drug accountability records 
throughout the course of the study  from receipt of study drug until final reconciliation and 
return to the sponsor .  Specifically, the investigator or their designee will confirm that all 
study drug s and supplies are receive d intact and in the correct amounts per the shipping 
forms.  A study drug accountability and dispensing log will be maintained on site to record 
the study drug disp ensed to subjects , including d ates, quantity received and  returned vial 
numbers .  The invest igator should ensure that the study drug  is used only in accordance with 
the protocol.  
The sponsor’s  designee will routinely verify the inventory  of study drug supplies throughout 
the course of the study.  All used and unused  cartons/vials  of study drug ar e to be retained at 
the site until the sponsor ’s designee has performed a complete verification.  
Any discrepancies identified will be indicated with a specific explanation of each 
discrepancy.  The investigator (or designee) must return all used and unused  study drug  in 
accordance with the sponsor’s instructions, and a copy of the clinical supplies return 
documentation will be returned to the sponsor or designee.  Drug accountability records, 
clinical drug supply receipts, and returns must be maintained by the investigator.  
6.5 Treatments Administered  
This trial will evaluate 20 mg and 40 mg dose escalation and 70 mg target dose of OPK -
88003 QW over a 30 -week treatment period.  Treatment allocation will be assigned by the 
IRT.  The group randomized to  OPK -88003 will initially receive  20 mg QW for four weeks, 
followed by 40 mg QW for four weeks.  Once eight  weeks of dose escalation are complete, 
subjects will receive a target dose of 70 mg QW OPK -88003 for 22 weeks.  The control  
group will receive  matched placebo SC injections  QW for 30 weeks .   
Site staff will train the subject  on correct storage, preparation and administration of study 
drug, aiming for subject self -administration .  The s ubject will administer the study drug  at the 
study site visits as per schedul e of events under supervision of an unblinded site personnel 
(eg, research nurse)  to ensure injection technique is satisfactory.  The subject will administer  
doses QW at home , with assistance if necessary.  
Prior to injection, if the vial is frozen it should be allowed to thaw/ equilibrate  for a minimum 
of 1 hour and a maximum of 4 hours at room temperature.  If the vial is refrigerated it should 
be allowed to equilibrate for a minimum of 30 minutes and a maximum of 4 hours at room 
temperature.

 Detaile d study drug handling and dosing instructions  will be provided to support subject 
dosing.  
All injections will be administered SC into the abdominal wall (or other site s if approved by 
the investigator).  Instructions  for rotation of injection sites and as sessment of potential 
injection site reactions will also be provided.   
The investigator or their designees are responsible for the following:  
 explaining the correct use of the study drug  to the subject  
 verifying that instructions are followed properly  
 maintaining accurate records of study drug  dispensing and collection, and the return  of all 
used and unused medication to the sponsor or designee at the end of the study  
Subjects will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if they have  any 
questions or issues concerning the injection  of study drug  or if they have any other study -
related concerns so the issue/question can be assessed in a timely manner to ensure subject’s 
safety.  
All subjects should be observed for allergic reaction foll owing study drug  administration for 
at least 1 5 minutes at visits 2, 3, 4 and 5 .   
6.6 Materials and Supplies  
6.6.1  Study Drug  Supplies  
Study drug cartons containing OPK -88003  or placebo for SC injection  will be supplied to 
study sites .  Ancillary supplies including  needles and syringes  will be provided  separately .  
Study drug vials must always be stored in a secure location with access limited to designated 
study s taff members.   
6.6.2  Laboratory Supplies  
The sponsor or assigned designee will supply vacutainers, blood col lection tubes, labels, 
boxes with labels for storage of serum and plasma samples and all necessary shipping 
supplies/containers , as specified in the laboratory manual .  The investigator will supply 
centrifug e equipment.  The investigator will ensure that a ll biohazard wastes are disposed of 
in accordance with investigator , site standard operating procedures ( SOPs ) and local 
regulations.  
6.7 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject  
There are no rest rictions on the time of day each dose is administered , but it is advisable to 
administer the SC injections on the same day and time of the week.  If a subject misses  a 
dose on the scheduled day, then they should administer the dose as soon as possible and then

 resume their regular schedule.   Study drug should not be administered within four days of the 
previous injection.   
6.8 Blinding 
OPK-88003 and placebo injections are identical in appearance  in order to maintain a double -
blind status.  An unblinded site staff member will be available to support subject dosin g as 
needed.  Study drug will be managed using IRT.  Each user will have a unique username and 
passcode to access the system.   In case of an emergency, when knowledge of the treatment 
assignment for the subject is essential for the clinical management or w elfare of the subject, 
the investigator may unblind the subject ’s treatment assignment.  Prior to unblinding, the 
investigator should make every effort to contact the sponsor or designee before proceeding 
with the unblinding process , if possible.  If a subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded 
without sponsor or designee’s prior knowledge, the sponsor must be notified immediately.    
Each site will be provided with a sealed envelope containing a six -digit code that can be  
entered into the IRT to unblind a subject’s treatment assignment.  In order to preserve the 
double-blind of the study, a minimal number of sponsor personnel will  have access to the 
randomization scheme and treatment assignments before the study is  complete.   
6.9 Concomitant Therapy  
Treatment with medications that are excluded in the entry criteria is not permitted.    
The only concomitant anti -hyperglycemic medication permitted during this trial is 
metformin.  Subjects treated with metformin upon entering this trial should remain on the 
same dose throughout the course of the trial, unless hyperglycemic criteria are met  (see 
section 6.11).  If a subject switches from the immed iate-release formulation of metformin to 
the sustained-release formulation, the change will be on a milligram per milligram basis.    
Doses of anti-hypertensive and lipid -lowering agents should remain stable during the study 
unless necessary to protect subj ect safety.   
Doses of other prescription medications ( eg, thyroxine, estrogen or progesterone 
replacement, selective estrogen receptor modulators) for treatment of concurrent medical 
conditions should remain stable during the study whenever possible.    
Anti-emetic drugs that do not increase QTc ( eg, cyclizine, meclizine) may be used to treat 
nausea and vomiting, but they should not be used prophylactically.    
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (including aspirin and acetaminophen), cough 
suppressants, antihistamines, vitamin/mineral supplements, antibiotics and topical ointments 
may be used and are not restricted by the stable dosing requirements listed above.

 design ated medical monitor .  Any additional medication used during the course of the study 
must be documented.   
6.10 Restrictions  
Meals  – Subjects  shall fast for at least 8 hours overnight prior to each visit where fasting labs 
are drawn or  measurements  are taken.  
Alcohol  – Alcohol will not be permitted at least 8 hours pr ior to the study visit .  
Blood donation  – Study subjects should be instructed not to donate blood or blood products 
during the study and for 8 weeks following study  completion . 
Contraception  – Male subjects  or their female partners of child -bearing potential must use 
reliable contraception during intercourse thro ughout the treatment period and for three  
months after the last dose of study drug  (as the risk of OPK -88003  to the unborn fetus is 
unknown).   Females must not be of childbearing potential due to surgical sterilization 
(hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy  or tubal ligation) or menopause.  
Acceptable contraception includes male sterilization (with the appropriate post -vasectomy 
documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate), oral, injected or implanted hormonal 
methods of contraception, intrauterine  device or implant, and barrier methods of 
contraception (condom or occlusive cap, diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal 
foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.  The use of barrier contraceptives should always be 
supplement ed with the use of a spermi cide. 
6.11 Evaluation and Treatment of Hyperglycemia  
Routine fasting (at least 8 hours) SMBGs and central laboratory FPG values will be used to 
determine the requirement for additional  medication.   If any fasting SMBG value exceeds the 
specified limit  (Table 1), the subject will be instructed to contact the investigational site and 
asked to perform  fasting SMBG on t hree consecutive days  (see section 7.5).   
If fasting SM BG value s exceed the specified limit for three  consecutive days , an unscheduled  
visit should be performed to assess FPG  by the central laboratory .   
Table 1 Threshold Glucose Levels   
Study Period  Threshold value  
Baseline to week 8  >270 mg/dL (15 mmol/L)  
Week 8 to week 12  >240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L)  
Week 12 to week 30  >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)  
Values must be recorded on three consecutive days  
If the SM BG values are confirmed by central laboratory FPG measurement, then an 
additional therapeutic intervention should be considered at the discretion of the investigator

 for subjects  who are fully compliant with the assigned therapeutic regimen, in the absence of 
any acute condition that raises blood glucose.   Any subject who requires additional glucose -
lowering therapy for more than one week should be discontinued (see section 5.2). 
7 STUDY PROCEDURES  
7.1 Medical History  and Physical Examination  
Physical examination will be performed by qualified personnel.  A detailed medical  history  
will be obtained at screening (V1).  
7.2 Height and Weight,  
Height is measured once, at screening.   
Body weight  will be measured on fasting  (minimum 8 
hours)  subjects .  Duplicate measurements of weight will be performed using digital scales  
and following emptying of any bowel/bladder contents.  Subject s will change into a light 
hospital gown for weight measurements .  Scales will be 
calibrated at least monthly using standard weights, and records of calibration wil l be kept in 
the study binder.   
  Detailed instructions 
will be provided in a study manual.  
7.3 Electrocardiography  (ECG)  
ECG and vital sign measurements will precede blood draws and study drug administration 
when scheduled at the same time.   
ECGs will be obtained in a quiet environment after remaining  in supine rest  for at least 5 
minutes .  Subjects will remain supine  but awake during ECG collection .  Triplicate  ECGs 
(when required) will be obtained within a 5 -minute window and at approximately 1 -2 minute 
intervals.   Collection of more ECGs (more replicates) than expected at a particular timepoint 
is allowed when neede d to ensure high quality records.   
ECGs  may be obtained at additional times when deemed clinically necessary.   
ECGs will be digitally recorded and printed on paper.  The printed paper ECG will be used  
for “real time” ECG assessment by the investigator (or  designee) who will be  responsible for 
the overall interpretation, determination of the clinical significance and  subject eligibility 
based on the ECG findings.  ECG interpretation categories are: Normal  ECG, Abnormal 
ECG – not clinically significant, Abno rmal ECG – clinically significant.   
The printed  ECGs will be retained in the subject’s records at the site.  All digital ECG  
records will also be submitted to the cardiovascular core lab, that will perform the digital  
ECG analysis and interpretation in this study using standard methodology.   If the central

 reviewer identifies an abnormality, per the study alert criteria, the investigator will be  
notified to review the ECG and report any AEs as necessary.    
The following variables will be reported: HR, RR , PR, QRS, QT, QTcB, and QTcF intervals.    
Any treatment emergent clinically significant ECG finding should be reported as an AE in 
the eCRF.   
7.4 Vital Signs (Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate ) 
Vital signs will include only supine blood pressure and pulse rate (after a minimum of 5 
minutes rest), and will be assessed following 12 -lead ECG (if scheduled) an d prior to any 
blood draws or study drug  administration.  The values for blood pressure and pulse rat at 
each time point will be the average of at least three measurements. 
7.5 Fasting Self-Monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG) Levels 
Subjects will be provided and trained on use of a glucometer, necessary glucose testing 
supplies and study diaries  at baseline visit (V2 ), and will be instructed on how to recognize 
symptoms of hypo- and hyperglycemia.   Subjects will be asked to demonstrate competent use 
of the glucometer at or before their first dosing visit .  Results from SMBG will be recorded in 
the subject diary (section 7.7.2). 
All subjects will be instructed to perform fasting SMBG at least three times a week using a 
portable glucometer .  Subjects will record SMBG readings in their diaries.   It will be the 
investigator’s responsibility to remind subjects  during study visits to perform their routine 
fasting SMBGs.   
Subjects will be requested to  perform additional SMBG measurements at any time that they 
develop symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia.   If subjects experience hy poglycemic 
symptoms or glucose value ≤70 mg/dL ( ≤3.9 mmol/L) they should record the SMBG value  
and symptoms in their diary and take SMBG measurements every 15 min utes until either the 
symptoms subside or the blood glucose value reaches >70 mg/dL(>3.9 mmol/L).   
Subjects who have an out of range SMBG reading  (hyperglycemia, see Table 1) will perform 
fasting SMBG prior to breakfast on three consecutive days and report the values to the 
investigator via email or phone if possible on the day each measurement was taken .  The 
investigator will review the results  in a timely manner and if possible on the same day as the 
results were received from the subject.   
Subjects who develop/have persistent uncontrolled hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia should 
contact the clinic.  Subjects will be requested to visit the clinic for further testing and 
appropriate medical management  at the investigator’s discretion.

 7.6 Lifestyle Counseling 
At visit 2, subjects will have a lifestyle counseling session (either in a group or individually) 
with a qualified diabetic educator in accordance with local standards .  Subject lifestyle 
counseling sessions will focus on diet, physical activity and behavioral stra tegies to achieve a 
500-700 kcal/day energy deficit  (AmDA 2018 4, AmDA 2018 7).  The sessions will occur 
approximately every four weeks during the dosing period.  
The goals of the counseling session are: 
 To promote and support healthful eating patterns, emphasizing a variety of nutrient -dense 
foods in appropriate portion sizes, to improve overall health  
 To address individual nutrition al needs based on personal and cultural preferences, health 
literacy and numeracy, access to healthful foods, willingness and ability to make 
behavioral changes, and barriers to change  
 To maintain the pleasure of eating by provid ing non-judgmental messages about food 
choices 
 To provide an individual with diabetes the practical tools  for developing healthy eating 
patterns rather than focusing on individual macronutrients, micronutrients, or single 
foods.  
Subjects will be encouraged to increase their physical activity.  Activities should progress in 
intensity, frequency and/or duration to at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity 
exercise.  The subject’s average daily level of physical activity will be reviewed as part of the 
lifestyle counseling. 
7.7 Diary Completion 
Subjects will complete two separate diaries during study participation.  The diaries will be 
dispensed at visit 2 following randomization, and instructions on diary completion will be 
provided. 
7.7.1 Lifestyle Diary 
Subjects should complete a 3-day food intake diary pri or to visits 4, 5, 9, 10, 11 , 12 and 13, 
when lifestyle counseling will be provided (see section 7.6).  Subjects will also document 
how much physical activity was p erformed. 
The days recorded in the diary should be in the week prior to the counseling visit and ideally 
include one weekend day.  Information in the lifestyle d iaries will be reviewed during the 
counseling as specified in the schedule of events, and not e ntered into the EDC.

 Subjects that miss more than four doses of study drug over the course of the study, or miss 
two consecutive doses of study drug during the dose escalation phase are considered non -
compliant.  A subject will also be considered non-compliant if he or she is judged by the  
investigator to have intentionally or repeated ly taken more than the prescribed amount of 
study drug.  Subjects that are noncompliant will be discontinued from the study (see section 
5.2). 
7.12 Concomitant Medication Assessments  
Medications ongoing at the time of visit 1 as well as any new medication added during the 
course of the study will be recorded in the source document and eCRF as concomitant 
medications.   
8 SAFETY EVALUATIONS  
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of subjects who have entered this trial 
and for alerting the sponsor or its designee of any event that seems unusual, even if this event 
may be considered an unanticipated benefit  to the subject. 
The investigator remains responsible for following through an appropriate health care option, 
AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the trial or that caused the 
subject to discontinue before completing the trial.  The subject should be followed until the 
event is resolved or deemed to be chronic .  Frequency of follow -up evaluation is at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
In addition to records of observations made at specific times, unexpected signs and 
symptoms and concomitant medications will be recorded in the clinical trial records 
throughout the study.  
8.1 DSMB 
A sponsor-appointed medical monitor will oversee subject safety in this study.  An 
independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) consisting of one  statistician and 
three clinicians with appropriate expertise will monitor the study at regular  intervals, and 
may make recommendations for changes to the conduct of the trial to reflect  safety concerns.  
Specific responsibilities and activities of the DSMB will be defined in the  charter to be 
ratified at the organizational meeting of the DSMB.   The DSMB will also perform an 
assessment of the tolerability of the 70 mg dose level (see section 8.10.2).   
8.2 Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with this treatment.

 All subjects will be monitored, evaluated and queried for AEs at each visit.  Subjects may be 
asked to self -report AEs verbally during visits and they will be encouraged to self -report AEs 
in their diaries between visits.  All AEs, inc luding SAEs occurring after the subject  signs the 
ICF through the subject’s final visit will be reported and monitored.  AEs that occur 
following first administration of study drug  are TEAEs.  Any clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory results, physical examination findings, ECGs, and vital signs will be reported as 
AEs.  Unless related to protocol  procedures as deemed by the investigator, cli nically 
significant  findings  reporte d prior to  administration of  first dose  of study drug  are 
exclusionary.   All AEs will be reported to the sponsor  via eCRF .   
All AE/SAEs will be followed through to resolution or until the investigator assesses the 
AE/SAEs  as resolved, chronic or irreversi ble.  The investigator is not obliged to follow -up 
with subjects for AEs or SAEs that begin after study completion, however if an SAE is 
reported to the investigator after a subject has completed the study, and it is ‘ possibly  related’ 
to the study drug, then the investigator will report it to the sponsor.  
8.2.1  Severity  
The intensity of the AE will be rated by the investigator as mild, moderate or severe using the 
following criteria:  
 Mild: Symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social and functional 
activities  
 Moderate: Symptoms causing greater than minimal interference with usual social and 
functional activities  
 Severe: Symptoms causing inability to perform usual social and functional activities  
It should be noted tha t the clinical severity and seriousness of an AE are not synonymous, eg, 
a severe headache is not classified as serious until it meets the required elements as an SAE.  
The maximum severity att ained for each AE reported will be recorded in the eCRFs.  
8.2.2  Relationship  
The investigator decides whether he or she interpret the observed AEs as either related to 
disease, to the study medication, study procedure or other concomitant treatment or 
pathologies.  To assess the relationship of the AE to the study drug, the following 
terminologies are defined:  
 Related : the temporal sequence of the event relative to administration of the study drug is 
reasonable, it cannot be explained by the disease or other drugs, dechallenge (if 
performed) is positive and pharmacologically /pathologically plausible, rechallenge (if 
performed) is positive, or the event shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge 
of the study drug or product class  
  
OPK-88003 OPKO Ireland Global Holdings Ltd.  
Protocol DPO-203 V3, 09 October 2018 Page 43 of 81 
 
Confidential   
   
   
  Possibly related: the temporal sequence of the event relative to administration of the 
study drug is reasonable, and is unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs, 
dechallenge (if performed) is positive  
 Unlikely related: the temporal sequence of the event relative to administration of the 
study drug is reasonable, the event could also be explained by disea se or other drugs, 
dechallenge (if performed) is positive or uncertain, rechallenge (if performed) is negative   
 Not related: the temporal sequence of the event relative to administration of study drug 
is not reasonable, disease or other drugs provide plausible explanations, dechallenge (if 
performed) is negative or ambiguous  
All “related”, and “possibly related” AEs and SAEs will be defined as related to study drug 
in this study. 
8.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The AEs of special interest (AESIs) of varying clinical significance will be used to determine 
the tolerability of OPK -88003 doses selected for this clinical trial.  All AESIs that meet the 
definition of an SAE (section 8.9) must be reported as an SAE.  
8.3.1 Injection Site Reactions  
Injection site reactions will be collected.  Assessment of severity, duration and relatedness to 
study drug will be recorded.  
8.3.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions 
All hypersensitivity reactions will be collected.  Study drug should be temporarily 
discontinued in any individual suspected of having a severe or serious 
allergic/hypersensitivity reaction to study drug.  Study drug may be restarted if, in the 
opinion of the investigator, the event was not related to study drug and when/if it is safe to do 
so.    
8.3.3 Hypoglycemia 
Fasting SMBG and central laboratory FPG values will be reviewed for hypoglycemi c 
episodes as defined in the study manual.  All episodes (documented symptomatic, 
asymptomatic or probable symptomatic hypoglycemia) will be recorded as an AE; those 
falling within AmDA classification Level 3 (see Table 3) will be recorded as an SAE.  For 
each event, assessment of severity, duration and relatedness to study drug will be recorded.

Level 2 <54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L)  Sufficiently low to indicate serious, clinically 
important hypoglycemia  
Level 3 No specific glucose 
threshold Hypoglycemia associated with severe cognitive 
impairment requiring external assistance for recovery  
AmDA 4 2018   
Subjects should be asked about symptomatic  and asymptomatic hypoglycemia  at each visit, 
and trained on treatment of hypoglycemia .   
8.3.4 Nausea, Vomiting and Diarrhea  
Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea events will be collected.  For each event, assessment of 
severity, duration and relatedness to study drug will be recorded.   
8.3.5 Acute Pancreatitis  
Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an acute inflammatory process of the pancreas that may also 
involve peripancreatic tissues and/or remote organ systems.  The diagnosis of AP requires 
two of the following three features: 
 Abdominal pain, characteristic of acute pancreatitis (generally located in the epigastrium 
and radiates to the back i n approximately half  of the cases; the pain is often associated 
with nausea and vomiting)  
 Serum amylase and/or lipase ≥3 x ULN 
 Characteristic findings of AP on computed tomography  (CT) scan or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) 
If a subject experiences severe or serious abdominal pain or if acute/chronic pancreatitis is 
suspected, administration of study drug should be temporarily discontinued.  If AP is 
suspected, appropriate labora tory tests (including levels of amylase and lipase) should be 
obtained.  These laboratory tests may be obtained locally but, if possible, a serum lipase and 
amylase should also be sent to the central laboratory (for capture of data in the clinical trial 
database) at the time of presentation.  If serum amylase and/or lipase values are confirmed ≥3 
x ULN, imaging studies, such as abdominal CT scan with or without contrast, MRI, or 
abdominal ultrasound, to include pancreas and gallbladder, should be performed.  If 
diagnostic testing does not support the diagnosis of acute or chronic pancreatitis then study 
drug may be resumed as soon as it is safe to do so in the judgment of the investigator.   If 
diagnostic testing supports the diagnosis of acute or chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer,

 the subject must permanently discontinue study drug .  A review of the subject’s concomitant 
medications should be conducted to assess any potential causal relationship with pancreatitis.  
8.3.6 Cardiovascular Events  
Deaths (CV and non -CV), nonfatal myocardial infarction s (MIs), and nonfatal strokes that 
occur during the treatment phase or follow-up phase will be reviewed by the sponsor -
designated medical monitor.  Investigative sites will also be asked to  report any cases of 
transient ischemic attack (TIA) or hospitalization for unstable angina to the sponsor-
designated medical monitor, to ensure that all true stroke and MI events are captured.  C V 
event definitions will be based on the Standardized Definitions for Cardiovascular and Stroke 
Endpoint Events in Clinical Trials2 and the ESC/ACCF/AHA/WHF Expert Consensus 
Document Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction3.  
8.3.7 Electrocardiography (ECG) Findings  
Any treatment emergent clinically significant ECG finding should be reported as an AE in 
the eCRF. 
If a clinically significant increase in the QT/corrected QT (QTc) inte rval from baseline or 
other clinically significant quantitative or qualitative change from baseline is identified, the 
subject will be assessed by the investigator for symptoms (for example, palpitations, near 
syncope, syncope) and to determine whether the  subject can continue in the trial.  The 
investigator or qualified designee is responsible for determining if any change in subject 
management is needed and must document his/her review of the ECG printed at the time of 
evaluation from at least one of the replicate ECGs from each time point.   
8.4 Liver Function Monitoring  
If a study subject experiences elevated ALT or AST >3  x ULN or elevated total bilirubin >2  
x ULN, clinical and laboratory monitoring should be initiated by the investigator  (Appendix 
3).  Details for hepatic monitoring depend upon the severity and persistence of observed 
laboratory test abnormalities.  To ensure subject safety and comply with reg ulatory guidance, 
the investigator will consult with the sponsor-designated medical  monitor regarding 
collection of specific recommended clinical information and follow -up laboratory tests.    
8.5 Serum Creatine Kinase Monitoring  
If a study subject experiences CK >5 x ULN that suggests muscle damage, the subject should 
be evaluated for any muscle -associated symptoms as well as any clinical signs of myalgia,

 generalized weakness, or darkened urine.  Additional clinical and laboratory monitoring 
should be initiated by the investigator, in consultation with the sponsor -designated medical 
monitor.  Laboratory monitoring should include repeat CK testing as well as assessment of 
coagulation factors (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, INR), urine 
myoglobin, cardiac troponin I, and additional testing as clinically indicated.    
8.6 Serum Calcitonin Monitoring  
Serum calcitonin ≥20 pg/mL at screening is exclusion ary (see section 4.2).  The subject will 
be referred to a thyroid specialist for futher evaluation  and will be discontinued from 
screening. 
Any treatment-emergent serum calcitonin value ≥20 pg/mL will be reviewed by the DSMB 
along with relevant supplementary d ata (eg, demographics and medical history, concomitant 
medications, supplemental laboratory tests and relevant AE data).  The DSMB will provide 
recommendations to the investigator for individual subjects, including diagnostic procedures, 
treatment, and continuation of the study drug according to a pre -specified algorithm:  
 Calcitonin >ULN and <20 pg/mL  
The investigator shall evaluate factors potentially leading to calcitonin elevation.  
Calcitonin sampling shall be performed at intervals indicated in the pro tocol with no 
further action unless levels rise to ≥20 pg/mL.  If the value is the final one in the trial, the 
subject shall be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation.  
 Calcitonin ≥20 pg/mL and ≤50 pg/mL  
Calcitonin sampling shall be perform ed at intervals indicated in the protocol with no 
further action unless levels rise to ≥50 pg/mL.  No impact on continuation of trial 
treatment.  If the value is the final one in the trial, the subject shall be referred to a 
thyroid specialist for further evaluation. 
 Calcitonin ≥50 pg/mL  
If calcitonin is confirmed to be ≥50 pg/mL, then the DSMB shall recommend the study 
investigator remove the subject from study treatment.  The subject shall be referred to a 
thyroid specialist for further evaluation.  
8.7 Treatment Discontinuations  
If a subject’s treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must clearly 
report (via eCRF) the circumstances and data leading to  discontinuation of treatment.

 8.8 Pregnancies  
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to study drug  should be 
reported.  Data on fetal outcome and breast -feeding will be collected for regulatory reporting 
and drug safety evaluation.   Pregnancies and female partner pregnanci es will be followed 
until 6 weeks following delivery to determine the outcome.  
8.9 Serious Adverse Events  (SAEs)  
The collection of SAEs begins after the subject has signed  the ICF.  SAEs occurring after the 
subject has received study drug are treatment -emergen t SAEs (TESAEs).  
An SAE is defined  by the investigator or sponsor as any AE resulting in any of the following 
outcomes:  
 death  
 life-threatening AE  
 in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 a persistent or significant disability /a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions    
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive  treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Planned surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical  condition 
has worsened during the course of the trial.  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not 
listed in the IB or are not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
8.9.1  Reporting Serious Adv erse Events  
8.9.1.1  Initial Report  
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent until 30 days following the last 
administration of study drug  must be reported to Medpace Clinical Safety  within 24 hours  of 
the knowledge of the occurrence (this refers to any  AE that meets any of the aforementioned 
serious criteria).  All known SAEs that the investigator considers related to study drug 
occurring after the 30 -day follow -up period  must be reported to the sponsor.

 To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically in the EDC system for the study.  
When the form is completed, Medpace Safety personnel will be notified electronically and 
will retrieve the form.   
If the event meets serious criteria and it is not p ossible to access the EDC system, send an 
email to Medpace Safety (email address listed below) or call the Medpace SAE hotline 
(phone number listed below), and fax the completed paper SAE form to Medpace (fax 
number listed below) within 24 hours of awarene ss.  When the EDC system becomes 
available, the SAE information must be entered within 24 hours of the system becoming 
available.  
Safety Contact Information:  
Medpace SAE Reporting Phone Line:  
Telephone: +1 -800-730-5779, dial 3 or +1-513-579-9911, dial 3  
Facsimile: +1 -866-336-5320 or +1-513-570-5196  
e-mail: medpace -safetynotification@medpace.com  
The investigator is responsible for informing his or her IRB of any SAEs at that site.   
Subject s who experienc e one or more SAEs will receive treatment and follow -up evaluations 
by the investigator, or they will be referred to another appropriate physician for treatment and 
follow -up.  Withdrawal from the study and all therapeutic measures will be at the discretion 
of the investigator .  The investigator must contin ue to follow the subject until resolution or 
until the condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent im pairment) 
or the subject is deceased .   
8.9.1.2  Follow -up Reports  
Within 24 hours of receipt of follow -up information, the investiga tor must update the SAE 
form electronically within the EDC system and submit any supporting documentation (eg, 
subject discharge summary or autopsy report) to Medpace Clinical Safety using the contacts 
listed above for initial reporting.  
8.10 Safety Monitoring  
8.10.1  Safety Monitoring  
A study level safety review will be conducted to monitor and assess safety data collected 
during the study.  Specifically, any signs or trends indicating potential underlying safety 
issues will be identified.  The safety review will be sc heduled regularly and reviewed by the  
sponsor-designated medical monitor.  More details will be provided in the safety monitoring 
plan (SMP)  including the type of safety data, frequency of review, and unblinding plan if 
necessary.  
The s ponsor -designated medical monitor  will routin ely review:

  trends in safety data laboratory analytes  
 serious and non-serious AEs including AESIs (see section 8.2) 
 reported pancreatiti s and major CV events  
8.10.2 Assessment of Tolerability   
The safety and tolerability of the 70 mg QW dose level will be assessed by the DSMB 
following completion of visit 7 (2 weeks of dosing) by at least 10 subjects randomized to 
OPK-88003.  If five or more of those subjects experience severe vomiting or severe nausea  
defined as an SAE, then the dose of OPK-88003 will be reduced to 60 mg for all subjects 
including those receiving 70 mg at the time of safety review.  Only members of DSMB will 
gain access to safety data.  Members of the DSMB will not have access to efficacy  data for 
this assessment.  Study team and site personnel will remain blinded.

 of recorded data and its analysis.  The sp onsor’s a udit observations and findings will be 
documented and communicated to appropriate study person nel and management.  An  
inspection may be conducted by regulatory authorities  including FDA .  The investigator  must 
allow direct access to study  documents during any inspection or audit .  
Routine m onitoring visits will be performed to evaluate study conduc t, data integrity, 
protocol, and GCP compliance.  Source documents, eCRFs, laboratory reports and any other 
additional study documents will be reviewed to ensure that they are accurate and complete.  
Each investigator is responsible for the accuracy, comple teness, legibility, and timeliness of 
the data reported.  All source documents are to be completed in a neat, legible manner to 
ensure accurate interpretation of data.  
10.1 Data Quality Assurance  
To ensure accurate, complete, and reliable data, the sponsor or its representatives will do the 
following:  
 provide instructional material to the study sites, as appropriate  
 provide study start-up training to instruct the investigators and study coordinators ,  
protocol training , instructions on  eCRF  completion  and study procedures  
 make periodic visits to the study site  
 be available for consultation and stay in contact with the study site personnel by mail, 
telephone, and/or fax  
 review and evaluate eCRF data and use standard computer edits to detect errors in data 
collection  
 conduct a quality review of the database  
In addition, the sponsor or its representatives wi ll periodically check a sample of  subject  data 
recorded against source documents at the study site.  Investigators will maintain study 
records in a s ecure location upon completion of  the study and the file archive location will be 
provided to the sponsor or its representatives.  
To ensure the safety of participants in the study, and to ensure accurate, complete, and 
reliable data, the investigator will  keep records of laboratory tests, clinical notes, and subject 
medical records in the subject  files as original source documents for the study.  If requested, 
the investigator will provide the s ponsor, applicable regul atory agencies, and applicable I RBs 
with direct access to original source documents.

 11 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Determination of Sample Size  
A total of 110 subjects  will be randomized  at a ratio 1.75:1  to OPK -88003  (70 subjects ) and 
the corresponding placebo arm ( 40 subjects ) in an effort to o btain 56 subjects completing in 
the active arm and 32 subjects completing in the placebo arm .  A sample size of 48  subjects  
in the active arm and 27 subjects  in the placebo arm will provide at least 90% power of 
detecting superior glycemic control over pla cebo r epresented by -0.8% in HbA1c leve ls at 
week 30.   This assumes a common SD of 1 .0% and a two-sided alpha of 0. 05.  The 
assumptions are based on variability in previously obtained HbA1c results from the OPK -
88003  phase 2 trial XNAA .  
11.2 Planned Statistical Methods  
11.2.1  General Considerations  
Statistical analysis of this trial will be the responsibility of the sponsor or its designee.  
Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require a protocol 
amendment only if the study d esign is modified in a way that it significantly affects the safety 
of the subjects , the scope of the investigation or scientific quality of the study .  Any other 
change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol and the justification for makin g 
the change will be described in the statistical analysis plan ( SAP) or clinical study report 
(CSR ).  Only results of exploratory analyses that are potentially relevant to subject safety 
will be reported in the fina l CSR.  Additional exploratory analyses of the data  (eg, secondary 
endpoint efficacy) may be performed as deemed appropriate and may  or may  not be reported 
in the final CSR.  
A clinical SAP will be finalized prior to database lock .  The SAP  will describe  statistical 
methodolog ies, and the statistical programming specifications  and will list  planned tables and 
listings.  The SAP will describe study  variables and population  demographics , anticipated 
data transformations and manipulations and other details of the analyses not provided in the 
clinical protocol.  
Data from screen failures will not be presented.   The number of screen failures will be listed.   
Data from enrolled subjects will be presented in data listings  arranged  by treatment group.   
All pre-dose and post -dose assessments , includi ng repeat assessments,  will be included in the 
data listings.   
Continuous data will be presented with number of observations (n), mean, and median , 
standard deviation (SD) , minimum and maximum.  Frequencies and percentages will be used 
for summarizing dis crete (categorical) data.  The denominator for all percentages, unless 
otherwise stated, will be the number of dosed subjects in a given group.

 Data that are reported as missing will be presented as unknown (UNK) in the data listings 
and treated as missing  in all data summaries.  No imputations for missing data will be made  
unless otherwise specified for endpoint derivation .   
Data handling, tabulation of descriptive statistics and calculation of inferential statistics will 
be performed using SAS® for clini cal data     The version s used 
will be reported in the final CSR.  
11.2.2  Analysis Populations  
The intent -to-treat ( ITT) population is defined as all randomized subjects .  Statistical 
analyses (including the primary analysis) will be conducted on the modified ITT (mITT) 
population.  The mITT population is defined as all randomized subjects  who received  at least 
one dose of study drug and have at least one post-baseline measu rement  for the primary 
outcome .   
The safety population is defined as all randomized subjects  who have received at least one 
dose of  study drug .  All s afety analyses will be per formed on the safety population.  
Some efficacy measures will also be analyzed o n the per-protocol (PP)  dataset.  The per -
protocol (PP) population is defined as all randomized subjects who were compliant with 
study drug and completed the protocol and is a subset of the mITT population  and include 
subjects who meet the following additi onal criteria:   The PP population will include all 
subjects in the mITT population who complete the 30-week, double -blind treatment period 
without any significant deviations from the protocol procedures.  The PP population will be 
used to assess robustness  of the primary analysis results.   A final listing of all subjects to be 
excluded from the PP population will be completed prior to unblinding the study database.  
No adjustments for multiplicity will be performed .  All tests of treatment effects will be 
conducted at a two -sided alpha level of 0.05 and/or two - sided 95% confidence interval (CI), 
unless otherwise stated.  
The baseline value used for the analyses will be the last scheduled baseline value obtained 
for each subject  prior to  first IP dose admini stration .  Any measurem ents/events that occurred 
after the subject  started rescue therapy will not be included in t he efficacy analyses.  
11.2.3  Subject Disposition  
Frequencies and percentages of all randomized, discontinued , and complet ed subjects  in the 
study will be presented for each of the treatment groups.  A summary of discontinuations will 
be presented by treatment group and by visit.  The reasons for discontinuations will be 
summarized by treatment group.  Discontinuation rates will be compared  among the

 11.2.4  Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group.  
Categorical variables will be summarized by frequencies and percentages.  For categorical 
variables, comparisons between treatment groups will be assessed using a Pearson Chi -
Square test.  For continuous variables, comparisons between the treatment groups will be 
performed using a one -way Analysis of Variance (ANOV A) with treatment as the fixed 
effect.  
11.2.5  Study Drug Exposure, Compliance, and Concomitant Therapies  
Exposure to each therapy during the treatment period of the trial will be calculated for each 
subject and summarized by treatment group.  
Listings and summary of concomitant therapies will be listed and summarized  by subject.  
Treatment compliance for the mITT population will be listed and summarized .  Subjects that 
miss more than four doses of study drug over the course of the study, or miss two 
consecutive dose s of study drug during the dose escalation phase are considered non -
compliant.  The frequency and percentage of  subjects  who are compliant  will be  summarized 
and analyzed by treatment group.  
11.3 Outcomes Analysis  
11.3.1  Primary Outcome Analysis  
The primary efficacy outcome of HbA1c absolute change from baseline to the 30 -week 
endpoint will be performed on the mITT analysis set .  Endpoint for each subject is defined as 
the week 30 measurement.  If the week 30 measurement is missing, the last valid pos t-
baseline observation (last observation carried forward [LOCF]) algorithm will be applied to 
impute the missing week 30 value.   
This change from baseline to week 30 in HbA1c will be analyzed using linear contrasts from 
an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment arm and BMI strata as factors 
and the baseline HbA1c value as a covariate.  The least -squares means, standard errors, and 
the 2 -tailed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each treatment group and for comparison to 
placebo will be presen ted.  Additional covariates may be added and will be detailed in the 
SAP.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be repeated on the PP population.  
11.3.1.1  Supportive Analysis of Primary Outcome  
The change from baseline in HbA1c at each scheduled visit without LOCF wil l be analyzed 
using a mixed -model repeated -measures (MMRM).  The factors in the model will be BMI 
strata, treatment group, baseline value, visit, and the treatment group by visit interactions.  
No imputation will be performed.  The least -squares means for change from baseline at each

 visit will be estimated and compared between treatment groups.  Additional covariates may 
be added and will be detailed in the SAP.  
11.3.2  Secondary Outcome Analyses  
The change from baseline of body weight and FPG will be calculated u sing the similar 
ANCOVA model used for the primary endpoint analysis.  The corresponding baseline will be 
used in the model instead of the baseline HbA1c levels.  The ANCOVA model will also 
include a term for the HbA1c stratification group.  
A logistic reg ression analysis will be performed for the percent of subjects with 5% or 
greater body weight loss with treatment and HbA1c and BMI strata as fixed effects, and 
baseline weight as a covariate.   
The number and percentage of subjects achieving HbA1c ≤6.5% w ill be summarized for each 
treatment group at each post -baseline visit.  Comparisons between treatment groups will be 
performed for responses at week 30 with LOCF based on a logistic regression model with 
factors for treatment group and BMI strata and base line HbA1c as a covariate.  Odds ratios, 
95% CIs (Wald), and p -values will be presented.   
11.3.3  Other Outcome Analyses  
The p roportion of subjects wh o discontinued due to hyperglycemia in each gr oup will be 
analyzed using a logistic regression analysis with fixed effects of treatment and strata.   
In addition to change from baseline in weight,  
will be listed and summarized.  
11.4 Safety  Analysis  
The safety population will be used for safety analyses.  Safety measures will include vital 
signs, body weight, hypoglycemia episodes, AEs, laboratory measures (including ADAs ), 
ECGs, injection site reactions,  hypersensitivity reactions,  major CV, pancreat ic, and GI  
events .  Summary statistics will be presented by treatment for the safety measures.

 Additional analysis, such as concentration -safety lab plots, may be performed if warranted 
upon review of the data.    
11.4.1  Adverse Events  
Safety of a ll subject s will be monitored during the treat ment period and queried at each  visit 
for AEs.  AEs will be listed by subject, actual term, preferred term, severity, and relationship 
to the treatment.  AEs will be summarized as TEAEs; defined as events that are newly 
reported after randomization or reported to worsen in severity from baseline).  The incidence 
of subjects with at least one TEAE and the incidence of TEAEs by preferred term and system 
organ class will be presented by treatment group.  The frequency and perc ent of TEAEs will 
be presented.  The incidence of  subjects with at least one TEAE assessed as related to the 
investigational drug will be summarized by treatment group, in  addition to the incidence of 
these TEAEs by preferred term.  In addition, a summary of TEAEs by severity will be 
presented descriptively by treatment group.    
Reported CV and pancreatic AEs will be listed by subject , and if there are a sufficient 
number of cases they may be summarized by treatment group.    
All SAEs will be listed by subje ct.  If a sufficient number of SAEs are reported, incidence 
summaries similar to incidence of TEAEs will be included.    
Discontinuations due to TEAEs will be listed by subject and summarized by treatment group.    
11.4.2  Adverse Events  of Special Interest  
11.4.2.1  Hypogly cemic Episodes  
The incidence of total hypoglycemic episodes will be presented for each visit (incidence 
between visits) and overall.  Listings of severity  of hypoglycemic episodes will be presented 
by visit for each subject.   
11.4.2.2  Other A dverse Events of Speci al Interest (AESIs)  
Hypersensitivity reactions, injection site reactions, pancreatitis, major  CV and GI  events, 
such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are defined as additional AESIs.   Descriptive statistics 
for these AESIs  will be presented by treatment group and visit.   
11.4.3  Vital Signs  
All vital signs will be listed for the safety  populat ion.  Descriptive statistics for the actual 
measurements and changes from baseline for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse 
rate w ill be presented by treatment arm and visit.  Corresponding figures may be presented.

measurements for individual subjects will be presente d by visit.  An additional listing will be 
presented for all laboratory measurements that are outside the normal range.    
Descriptive statistics for the laboratory analyses will be presented by treatment group and 
visit, including safety follow -up visits.    
Laboratory analyses with categorical responses will be summarized by visit and treatment 
group using frequency and percentage.    
Shift tables will be evaluated at the worst post-baseline observation (as applicable for a lab) 
will be compared to the basel ine observation by examining the proportion of subjects whose 
test values are within and outside the reference ranges.    
11.4.5  Evaluation of Immunogenicity  
The frequency of ADA  will be determined  by the specialized  laboratory other than central 
laboratory using a validated assay .  If a neutralization assay is performed, the frequency of 
neutralizing antibodies will be determined.    
11.4.6  Evaluation of Electrocardiography ( ECG ) 
A listing of the individual and averaged ECG measurements by subject will be produced.  
This listing will include the time elapsed between the onset of ventricular depolarization and 
the end of ventricular repolarization (QT) corrected values described below.    
Descriptive statistics for the absolute measurements, outliers, and changes from baseli ne for 
selected ECG parameters will be presented by treatment arm and visit.  These include the 
ECG heart rate, and the following intervals: QT and QT corrected for heart rate using 
Fridericia’s formula (QTcF).

12.6 Electronic Case Report Forms  (CRFs)  and Study Records  
This study will utilize an electronic data capture system for the management of clinical 
data.   Data capture and management will be consistent with applicable ICH/GCP guidelines.   
All data collected during the study for subjects will be recorded in an individual, subject -
specific electronic case report forms (eCRF) as part of an electronic data capture (EDC) 
system.   Access to the electronic system will be restricted and users will only be able to 
access the system via authorized individual accounts.   The sponsor or designee will provide 
training to the investigative site on the EDC system and eCRFs.  Site staff will complete 
eCRFS promptly.  As electronic data capture will be utilized, instructions, training records, 
and a log will be maintained to identify the designated site personnel who can enter data 
and/or sign off on an eCRF.  
A subject eCRF must be completed f or each subject who signs a consent form and undergoes 
randomization.    
To ensure the quality of the clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review will be performed by the sponsor or designee on subject data entered or 
integrated into the EDC system.  During the review, subject data will be checked for 
consistency, omissions, and any apparent discrepancies.  In addition, the data will be 
reviewed for adherence to the protocol, and ICH/GCP.   Moreover, all data from extern al 
sources, eg, central laboratory and PD processing/analysis will be reconciled with subject 
eCRF data.  To resolve any questions arising from the Data Management review process, 
data queries and/or data clarification notifications will be generated via t he EDC system for 
completion and resolution.  
The investigator will sign and date the indicated places on the eCRF via the EDC system’s 
electronic signature.  These signatures will indicate that the investigator reviewed the data on 
the eCRF, the data queri es, and the data clarifications and agrees with the content.

 The investigator is responsible for ensuring protocol and study compliance by all study staff 
members.  Deviations from protocol will be documented in subjects’ study records.  
The sponsor  requires that all protocol deviations be reported to the IRB as per site’s 
institutional regulations .  In addition, the investigator is responsible for adhering to his/her 
IRB’s  protocol deviation reporting requirements.  
12.8 Retentio n of Data  
The investigator/institution will maintain all CRFs and all source documents that support the 
subject data collected, and all study documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential 
Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial .  The investi gator/institution will take 
measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents.  
Essential documents must be retained until at least two years after a marketing application is 
approved for the drug; or, if an application is not appro ved for the drug, until two years after 
shipment and delivery of the drug for investigational use is discontinued and FDA has been 
so notified.  These documents will be retained for a longer period if required by the 
applicable regulatory requirements or b y an agreement with the sponsor.  It is the 
responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these 
documents no longer need to be retained.  
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws fr om the 
study, the responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person 
who will accept the responsibility.  The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and 
address of the new custodian.  Under no circumstances shall the investigator relocate or

 d. Height is measured only at screening (V1).  
e. Vital signs (triplicate supine blood pressure and pulse rate , after minimum 5 minutes  rest) will be assessed following 12 -lead ECG and prior to any 
blood draws or study drug  administration.  
f. Serum chemistry will include: albumin, ALP, AL T, AST, BUN, calcium, creatinine, creatine kinase, potas sium, sodium, total and direct bilirubin, total 
protein, uric acid, lipase and amylase. Hematology will include: Hct, Hgb, MCHC, MCV, platelet count, RBC and WBC with differential.   
g. Subjects who do not have a screening calcitonin should be tested at their n ext visit  
h. Urinalysis will include glucose, leukocyte esterase, occult blood, pH and protein.  
i. Serum pregnancy/FSH  will be tested at the investigator’s discretion.  
l. ECGs will be obtained in a quiet environment after at least 5 minutes in supine rest .  Subjects will remain supine but awake during ECG collection. 
Consecutive replicate ECGs will be obtained at approximately 1 -2 minute intervals  within a 5 minute window .  X1 single ECG; X 2 triplicate ECG.  
m. Lifestyle counseling  will include lifestyle diary revi ew. Subject s will complete a 3 -day lifestyle  diary prior to visits.   
n. Subjects will receive training on study drug injection technique, routine SMBG  and glucose testing supplies . 
o. Subject s will perform SMBG prior to breakfast at least three times a week using a portable glucometer.  Subjects will perform additional SMBG as per  
section  7.5 and ma y be asked to attend an unscheduled  visit if needed.   
p. There are no restrictions on the time of day each dose is given but it is advisable to administer SC injections on the same day and time o f the week for 
the full 30 week treatment period.   All subjects should be observed for allergic reactions following study drug  admi nistration for at least 1 5 minutes  at

 Appendix 2.  Clinically Significant Events 
Table 5 summarizes the type and severity of symptoms, clinical signs, and clinical laboratory 
findings that may qualify as a CSE and lead to discontinuation (see section 5.1.2).  They are 
intended as a guideline to the investigator, not as a set of absolute criteria.  The underlying 
principle is to define a level of moderate -to-severe abnormality in safety find ings that could 
cause harm to health, and would preclude further dosing of a subject who experiences this 
effect.  Safety parameters not included in this table may be interpreted in a similar fashion 
according to investigator judgement.

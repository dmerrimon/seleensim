 1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY A ND/OR SC HEMA  
 
Study Objective  
 
• The primary  objective of this study is to perform  a randomi zed study to determine 
whether  patients  treated  for relap sed ovary, fallopian  and primary peritoneal  with 
extended  infusion carboplatin  have lower  rates  of hypersensitivity reactions compared 
to those treated with standard  infusion carbopla tin. 
 
Study Population  
 
• Eligible  patients (relap sed fallopian,  ovary and primary  peritoneal cancer), who will be 
re-treated  with a carbop latin-contain ing regimen.  
 
Number  of Patients:  
 
•  Appro ximately 150 patients  will be enrolled  in order to obtain the 114 evaluable 
patients  that are requir ed to determine  the primary  endpoint  of the study. 
 
Study Design:  
 
• This is a randomi zed, non-blinded  trial, with a 1:1 randomi zed to the standard and 
experiment al treatment  arms. 
 
Therapeutic  Intervention:  
 
• All patients  receive standardi zed premedi cation with dexamethasone 20mg PO the 
night  before  and morning  of treatment,  montelu kast 10mg  PO once daily for the three 
days prior to carboplatin  treatment,  and ranitidine  50mg  IV (or famotidine  20mg  IV) 
and diphen hydramine  50mg IV prior to treatment  to control  for the contrib ution of 
premedi cation  in preventing  hypersensitivity reactions (see Section 5.6.3  for further 
detail s). 
• Randomi ze between  standard  (30-minute)  carboplatin  infusion or an extended  (3- 
hour carbop latin) infusion. Extended  infusion carboplatin  is given in three  steps, 1% 
of total dose administered  over the 1st hour,  9% of total dose admini stered  over the 
2nd hour,  and the remaining  90% administered  over the 3rd hour.  Randomi zation  is 
stratified  by prior carbop latin (yes/no) and concurrent paclitaxel/docetaxel (yes/no). 
• Dose of carboplatin  (AUC)  for each patient  in each arm is determined  by treating 
physician. 
• Concomitant  treatment  with paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetre xed, gemcitabine, 
liposomal  doxorubi cin and bevacizumab in both arms  is determined  by the treating 
physician. 
• Cycles are repeated  every 28 days if carboplatin  is given in combination  with liposomal 
doxorubi cin. Carboplatin  given alone  or with gemcitabine,  paclitaxel, docetaxel or 
pemetre xed may be administered  on a 21 or 28 day cycle, at the discretion  of the 
Investigator.  Patients  are treated for 5 to 8 cycles, at the discretion  of their treating  
physician.

2.0 OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS 
 
Primary  Endpoint:  
1.  Determine  the rate of hypersensitivity reaction in each group  
 
Secondary  Endpoint s: 
1.  Determine  the rate of successful planned  treatment  complet ion of carboplatin in each 
group  
2.  Perform  a cost-identif ication  analysis of extended  infusion carboplatin  to estimate  the 
cost per hypersensitivity reaction prevented.  
3.  Perform  exploratory  analyses to correlate  hypersensitivity rate to history of atopy, 
prior drug allergie s, number  of lifetime platinum  cycles, durat ion since last platinum, 
and concomitant  chemotherapy  agent  
 
3.0 BACKGROUND A ND RATIO NALE 
 
Epithelial  ovarian  cancer is the second most common  gynecologic  malignan cy and accounts 
for almo st 22,000  incident cases and 16,000  deaths per year.1  Early  symptoms of ovarian 
cancer are often  absent or non-specific and 7 5% of patien ts present with ad vanced (Stage I II 
or IV) disease. These patients  are offered  maximal tumor  debulking followed  by intravenous 
or  intraperitoneal  platinum  and  taxane  chemotherap y.  Following  this  combination  of

 therapie s, 50% of patients  achieve a complete  remission and an additional  30% a partial 
remission.2 Of the patients  in CR, 15% remain  disease free for 5 years and are considered 
cured.  The remaining  patients  will relapse and require  further  palliati ve chemotherap y. 
  
Relap sed ovarian  cancer is distinct from most solid tumors  in that it often  retains  sensitivity to 
chemotherap y, specifically platinum s, over multiple  relap ses. The most important  progno stic 
factor in relapsed ovarian cancer is platinum  sensitivity (defined as relapse ≥ 6 months  since 
last platinum). Patients  with recurrent  platinum -sensitive ovarian  cancer are usually retreated 
with carboplatin  either  alone  or in combination with  paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetrexed, 
gemcitabine or  liposomal  doxorubi cin. The se patients  can maintain  platinum  sensitivity over 
multiple  recurren ces spanning  many  years and be successfully retr eated repea tedly with 
carboplatin -based chemotherapy.  Unfortunatel y, patien ts can develop hypersensitivity 
reactions  (HSRs) when they are retreated  with carbopla tin. The se reactions  present with 
significant heterogeneit y. In some patients  HSRs  occur immediately  upon initiati on of the 
infusion while in others  the reactions o ccur after at least half the treatment volume  has been 
given. Delayed reactions  (reactions that occur after carboplat in has been  completed  infused) 
are very rare. This diversity sugge sts multiple  immu nologi cal and non-immunologi cal 
mechanisms may be involved. The symptomatology of  carbopl atin HSRs  is similarly 
heterogeneou s. Some  patients  will develop mild manife stations in cluding  flushing, rash, 
diaphore sis, urti caria or hyperten sion. Other  patients  will present with severe symptoms 
including  potentially  life-threateni ng bron chospasm, chest pain,  shortne ss of breath, 
hypoten sion or cardiac  arrest. 
 
Carboplatin  HSRs  rarely  occur during the fir st course of therapy.  Patients  typically react early 
in their second course of therap y, most commonly during  their 7th to 9th lifetime  cycle of 
carboplatin .3 Reactions, howe ver, can occur at anytime.  Estimates  of the frequen cy of 
carboplatin  HSRs  are fairly consistent across multiple  publi cations. Markman et al have 
report  an incidence of 27%.4 Polyzos et al report an incidence of 16%.5 Morgan  et al report 
an incidence of 44%.6 The variation  in these rates  likely reflects the different  treatment 
experien ce of each patient populat ion as well as differen ces in the use of pre-medications. 
Carboplatin  infusion rates may also play a role. Retro spective studies have sugge sted a 
number of risk factors for carboplatin  HSR including a history of prior drug allergie s, a lifetime 
platinum  exposure of  ≥8 prior cycles, and a treatment inter val ≥12 months  since last 
platinum.7-8 None  of these risk factors has been validated  prospectively. The  choice of 
chemotherapy agent  admini stered  in combination  with carboplatin  may also impa ct the 
likelihood  of a HSR. For example,  a recent randomi zed phase III trial demon strated a  HSR 
rate in patients retreat ed with concurrently  paclitaxel or liposomal  doxorubi cin of 18% versus 
5%, respectively.9 
  
Several Investigators  have developed desensitization re gimens  in order  to re-challenge 
patients  who have previously rea cted to platinums. Like many  antibiotic  desensitization 
regimen s, these strategies typically involve administering e scalating  aliquots  of carboplatin 
slowly  with premedi cation .10-11 These procedures are labor-inten sive and  are typically 
perfor med over six or more hours  under  close observation  in a monito red setting  such as an 
inten sive care unit. Many desensitization regim ens utilize skin testing to risk stratify  patients 
prior to re-challenge .12  All these techniques  require  the expertise of allergists familiar with

 managing  chemotherapy HSRs and the chance of a second reaction is high.  Castels et al 
have repor ted on their experien ce at a specialized chemotherapy de sensitization unit at the 
Dana  Farber  Cancer Center. In their series  30-40% of patients  will experien ce a second HSR 
upon  re-challenge. Although  these second reactions are generally  mild, a small percentage 
will be severe and life threatening.  Centers  specialized in managing  chemotherapy  HSRs 
typically treat through  repeated  reactions.  However, many women  do not have access to 
these services. As a result, many p atients  will not successfully complete  a planned course of 
carboplatin  after de veloping  an initial HSR and  may ha ve inferior  clinical outcomes.13 What  is 
therefore  most needed  is an effective strategy  to prevent patients  who are continuing to 
benefit  from platinum  chemotherapy  from developing HSRs  in the first place. 
 
The Gynecologic  Medical Oncology (GMO) service at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering Can cer 
Center  (MSKCC)  has developed  3-hour extended  infusion carbopl atin regimen  that is a 
modifi cation  of the standard  12-step desensitization pro tocols used at several center s. 
Carboplatin  is admini stered either  a single agent or a carboplatin -containing  combination 
treatment.  Patients  are premedi cated with dexametha sone 20mg  the night  before  and 
morning  of chemotherapy, monte lukast 10mg  once daily for the three  days preceding 
treatment,  and ranitidi ne 50mg  IV (or famotidine  20mg  IV) and diphenhydramine  50mg  IV 
prior to carboplatin.  Carboplatin  is given in the following  manner:  1% of the total dose over 
the 1st hour,  9% of the total dose over the 2nd hour, and  the remaining  90% over the 3rd hour. 
In contra st to the complex  and lengthy  desensitization protocols often used in post-HSR 
platinum  re-challenge, this  3-hour extended  infusion can be easily admini stered  in the 
outpatient  clinic setting.  This extended infusion regimen  is now the accepted standa rd of care 
at MSKCC to re-challe nge patients  who have developed  a prior HSR to carboplatin.  
 
Several physicians in the GMO  have piloted  using this regimen  before  women  develop 
HSRs. A retro spective review of this experien ce has been publi shed.14 This review identi fied 
707 patien ts who had received retreatment  with second-line or  greater  carboplatin  betwe en 
January  1998  and December 2008.  Of these a total of 174 patients (25%)  received 
proph ylactic extended  infusion schedule.  A total of 117 carboplatin  HSRs  were  identified 
among  the entire  cohort of 707 patients. Only  6 patients  (3.4%) who received the  extend ed 
schedule  versus 111 patients (21%)  who received the standard schedule developed  an HSR. 
Using the Fisher exact test, there  was a significant relationship between  the use of the 
extended  regimen and a reduced incidence of HSRs  (P< 0.001).  Moreover, only  20% of 
patients  who developed  a HSR on standard  infusion were re-challenged with  extended 
infusion carboplatin  and of these only 57% were  able to complete  treatment.  The end result 
is that only 11.4%  of patients  who experien ced a carboplat in HSR were  able to successfully 
complete  a  planned  course  of  therap y.  This  reinfor ces  the  importan ce  of  developing 
strategies  to prevent platinum  HSRs. 
 
To date,  no center  has reported  prospectively on the prophylactic use of extended  infusion 
carboplatin regimen  to reduce in incidence of HSRs. This will be the first prospective 
randomi zed clinical trial to compare standard  to proph ylactic extended  infusion carboplatin  in 
women  with  recurrent  ovarian  cancer.  The  results  of  this  prospective  tria l,  positive  or 
negati ve, will define  the be st practice for retreating  women  with ovarian  with platinum  agent s. 
The implications of this strategy  are not limited to patients  with ovarian  cancer. Several other

 cancer types can respond  repeatedly  to platinu m-based chemotherapy in cluding  BRCA+ 
breast cancer and endometrial cancer. In addition, colon cancer patien ts are routinely given 
platinum -based chemo therapy  in the adju vant setting  and are then  retreated with platinum  on 
recurren ce and can develop HSRs. The results of this study may therefore  inform  the design 
of future  clinical trials for these diseases. 
4.0 OVERVI EW OF STUDY D ESIGN/INTER VENTION  
 
4.1     Design  
 
This is a non-blinded  randomi zed study compar ing standard  30-minute  infusion carboplatin 
to extended  3-hour infusion carbopla tin in women with recurrent,  ovary, fallopian  tube,  and 
primary  peritoneal  cancer who will be treated  with a carboplat in-containing  chemotherapy 
regimen.  
 
4.2     Interventi on 
 
All patients  will receive identi cal chemotherapy  premedi cations  including  dexametha sone 
20mg  the night  before  and morning  of infusion, montelu kast 10mg  once daily for three  days 
prior to carboplatin i nfusion, and ranitidi ne 50mg  IV (or famot idine 20mg  IV) and 
diphenh ydramine 50 mg IV before  carboplatin  infusion. Patients  who are intolerant  to 
diphenh ydramine  50mg  IV can be dose reduced to 25mg  IV or changed  to hydroxyzine 25mg 
PO at the discretion  of the Investigator. Patients  will be randomi zed to  receive standard 
infusion carboplatin  or  extended  infusion carboplatin  in  a  1:1  manner.  Patients  will  be 
stratified b ased on history of prior carboplatin  exposure (yes/no) and concurrent  paclitaxel or 
docetaxel treatment  (yes/no). Patients may receive carbop latin alone  or in combi nation with 
paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetre xed, gemcitabine or  liposomal  doxorubi cin at the discretion  of 
the Investigator.  Patients  may also receive concurrent  bevacizumab  in addition  to single - 
agent  carboplatin  or a carboplatin  doublet,  at the discretion  of the Investigator. Carboplatin 
dose will be decided by the Investigator. Carboplatin  will be administered on  day 1 of each 
cycle. If carboplatin  is admini stered alone  or in combination  with paclitaxel, docetaxel, 
pemetrexed or gemcitabine, ea ch cycle will last 21 days. If carboplat in is given alone,  with 
gemcitabine  or with p aclitaxel or docetaxel or pemetre xed, each cycle will last either 21 or 28 
days, at the discretion  of the Investigator. Patien ts will receive between  5 and 8 cycles, as is 
the standard  of care, the exact number to be determined  by their treating  doctors. 
 
The goal of this study is to accrue 57 patients  to each arm for a total of 114 evaluable 
patient s. With an anticipated accrual rate of 5-6 patients  per month,  this study should take 
18-24 months  to complete enrollment.  Patients  will be followed until they receive their last 
dose of carboplatin.

9.1 Chemothera py Administration  
 
Carboplatin  Dosing: 
 
Eligible  patients will be randomi zed in a 1:1 manner  to receive carbopl atin by either standard 
infusion (Arm  A) or extended  infusion (Arm B). Carboplatin d osing will follow  the 
Gynecologi cal Medi cal Oncology  and MSKCC  institution al guidelines. Dose reductions, 
modifi cations, and treatment  interruptions  will be decided by the Investigator.  Carboplatin  will 
be admini stered as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Arm A: 
Per standard  MSKCC carboplatin  protocol: 100% of carbop latin dose is admini stered  in 
250mL  of D5W over 30 minute s. Spike infusion bag with secondary  set (Braun  #V1921),  do 
not prime.  
 
Arm B: 
Per desensitization MSKCC  carboplatin  protocol: Bags  1 and 2 are prepared  by the 
chemopharma cy. Bag 1 contains  10% of the total dose in 100 mL of D5W  and Bag 2 
contains wi th 90% of the total dose in 250mL  of D5W.  10 mL (1% of total dose) of Bag 1 is 
infused over the first hour.  If there  is no evidence of hypersensitivity reaction, the remaining  
90 mL (9% of total dose) of Bag 1 is infused over the second hour. If the re is still no evidence 
of hypersensitivity reaction, Bag 2 containing  90% of total dose in 250 mL is infused over the 
third hour.  Spike infusion bag with IMED  Alaris  2420  tubing.

 Patients  treated on Arm B or who are crossed over to Arm B who  experien ce a 
hypersensitivity reaction of any grade  will be discontinued  from study. 
Please see Section 5.6.3 for details  on the required premedi cation s. 
Concurrent  Chemother apy and Bevacizumab:  
Patients  treated  on  either  Arm  may  receive  concurrent  chemotherapy  with  paclitaxel, 
docetaxel, pemetre xed, gemcitabine, liposomal  doxorubi cin or bevacizumab  in addition  to 
carboplat in. The decision to use these medi cations will be left to the discretion  of the treating 
physician. Bevacizumab may  be admini stered  with either  single  agent carbopla tin or any 
carboplatin  doublet.  The following  table  describes the recommended  dosing, infusion time 
and schedu le for each agent. Modifi cation  of all parameters  are permitted  at the discretion  of 
the Investigator. The cycle length of any liposomal do xorubi cin-containing regimen  will be 28

Principal or Co-Principal In vestigator  must be consulted.  If a patient’s  Day 1 is 
delayed/interrupted, Day  8 and Day 15 treatments (if appli cable)  should  be scheduled 
accordingl y. 
 
For the secondary  endpoint  of determining  the rate of successful treatment  completion  in 
each arm, we will define  successful treatment  completion  if a patient  completes at  least 5 
cycles of carboplatin  treatment. If the patient comes off for progre ssive disease before cycle 
5 then the patient  would  be considered  inevaluable  for this endpoint.  If a patient  comes  off for 
any other  reason before cycle 5 then the patie nt would  count as a "failure" when  calculating 
treatment  completion  rates. Discontinuation of non-carboplatin chemotherapy  will not be 
considered  “failure.”  Treatment completion  rates  will be calculated  on evaluable  patients.

11.8 Management of Adverse Events 
 
 
All of the therapeutic  agents in this trial are commer cially available  and have FDA appro ved 
or NCCN  Compendia li sted for the treatment  of recurrent epithe lial ovarian  cancer. All 
treatment  combinations are  used in routine  clinical practice. As a result, the adverse events 
associated with  these treatments will not be collected as part of this protocol. The 
manage ment of all non-hypersensitivity ad verse advents including  dose reductions  or 
treatment  delays of all agents  described  in Section 5 are allowed  at the discretion of the 
treating  Investigator.

 Adverse events collected as part of this proto col include toxicities related to the routine  use 
of premedi cations  and allergi c/anaphylaxis hypersensitivity reactions related  to carboplatin 
infusion (the primary e ndpoint for  this study). These adverse events will be graded  using the 
CTCAE  Version 4.0 (see Appe ndix A).  These adverse events will be attributed  to 
premedi cations  and  carboplatin  in  the  following  manner:  Definite,  Probable,  Possible, 
Unlikely,  and  Unrelated.  Please  note  that  hypersensitivity  rea ctions  to  carbop latin  are 
typically easy to recognize clinically and occur during  the time of carboplatin infu sion. Per 
institutional proto col, carboplatin  will not be infused concurrently with other  chemotherapy  or 
biologic  agents (bevacizumab).  It is therefore  unlikely there  will be difficulty distinguishing 
carboplatin  reactions  from paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetre xed, gemcitabine, lipo somal 
doxorubi cin or bevacizumab rea ctions  as these will be temporally  separated.  Only reactions 
attributed  as definite,  probabl y, possible or unlikely related  to carboplat in will count  towards  
the primary  endpoint,  hypersensitivity rate. 
 
Serious  adverse events (SAE)  will be reported  as described in Section 17.2.  A SAE  is 
defined  as: 
• Is fatal or life-threateni ng 
• Is disabling 
• Results in hospitalization or prolon gation of hospitalization 
• Results in a congenital  anomaly  or occurren ce of malignan cy 
• Jeopardi zes the participant and may require  medical intervention  to prevent one of 
the outcomes  above 
The defini tion of serious  adverse event (experien ce) also includes  important  medi cal event. 
Medi cal and scientif ic judgment  should  be exercised in  deciding  whether  reporting  is 
appropriate  in  other  situatio ns,  such  as  important  medical  events  that  may  not  be 
immediately  life-threat ening or result in  de ath or hospitalization  but may jeopa rdize the 
patient  or  may  require  intervention to  prevent one  of  the  other  outcomes  listed in  the 
definition  above. These should  also usually be considered  seriou s. Examples  of such events 
are inten sive treatment  in an emergen cy room  or at home  for allergic  bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or  development  of drug 
dependen cy or drug abuse. The definition  of “related”  is an adverse event that is attributed 
as definitely, probably  or possibly related  to the premedication and/or  carbopla tin given as 
part of this proto col. A life-threaten ing adverse event implies an  immediate  risk of death from 
the reaction as it occurred. Life-threatening do es not include a reaction that, had it occurred 
in a more  serious  form,  might  have  caused death. For example,  drug-induced he patitis  that 
resolved without  evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered  life-threaten ing even 
though  drug induced hepatitis  can be fatal.  
 
Hypersensitivity Precautions  and Management:  
MSKCC guidelines  for monitoring  and management  of hypersensitivity reactions will be 
observed for all patien ts treated  on study as described  in the link below.

 12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THE RAPEUTIC RE SPON SE/OUTCOME ASS ESSMENT  
 
Two  outcomes  will  be  assessed:  the  rate  and  grade  of  hypersensitivity  rea ctions  to 
carboplatin  and successful completion  of planned treatme nt. These out comes  are defined  as 
follow s: 
 
Rate  of Hypersensitivity Reactions  to Carboplatin:  All allergic or anaph ylactic reactions  to 
carboplatin  of any grade  will be counted as an event with  exception  of reactions  attributed  as 
definitely  not related  to carboplatin.  
 
Successful Completion  of Planned  Therap y: For the secondary endpo int of deter mining the 
rate of successful trea tment  completion in  each arm, we will define  successful treatment 
completion  if a patient  completes  at least 5 cycles of carboplatin  treatment.  If the patient 
comes  off for progre ssive disease before  cycle 5 then the patient  would  be considered 
inevaluable for  this endpoint.  If a patient  comes  off for any other  reason before  cycle 5 then 
the patient  would  count as a "failure"  when  calculating treatm ent completion rate s. 
Discontinua tion of  non-carboplatin chemotherapy will  not be considered  “failure.”  Treatment 
completion  rates  will be calculated  on evaluable  patient s. 
 
13.0    CRITER IA FOR  REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
 
Premature  Withdrawals:  
 
Patients  who discontin ue participation in the clinical study on their own or patients  who are 
withdrawn  by the Investigator, for  reasons other than those listed below will be defined  as 
premature  withdrawal s. For  the purpose of this study, they will not be considered to have 
experien ced a hypersensitivity reaction but will be considered a “failure”  when  calculating 
planned  treatment  completion  (defined as discontinuation of  carbopla tin treatment prior  to 5 
cycles for reasons other  than disease progre ssion, see Section 12.0 for further  detai ls). 
 
Criteria  for Stopping  Therap y: 
 
• Hypersensitivity Reaction: According to Schema  in Section 1.0 and Crossover in 
Section 9.1 
• Substantial  non-complian ce with the requirements  of the study 
• Any adverse event which, in the Investigator  or treating  physician’s opinion, requires 
termination  from the study 
• Progre ssion of the underlying cancer unless, at the discretion of the Investigator, 
continued  treatment  on the study is deemed  appropriate  
• Reque st by the patient  or a legal  representati ve/relati ve to stop the treatment  
• The patient  uses illicit drugs or other  substances that may, in the  opinion  of the 
Investigator,  have a reasonable  chance of contributing  to toxicity or otherwi se 
interfering  with results 
• The development  of a second malignan cy that requires  treatment,  which would 
interfere  with this study 
• The patient  is lost to follow-up 
• Treatment  delay  of greater  than 30 days 
• Developm ent of an intercurrent  illness or situation which would,  in the judgment  of the

 Investigator,  affect assessments  of clinical status and study endpoints  to a significant 
degree  
 
Criteria  for Study  Withdrawal:  
• Patient  decides to discontinue  participation  in the study. Data generated  during  their 
participation  in the protocol will be analyzed unless the patient specifically opts to 
withdraw  research authorization.  
 
 
14.0 BIOS TATISTICS  
 
This is a randomi zed non-blinded study with the primary  objective to determine  whether 
patients  treated with extended  infusion carboplatin ha ve lower  rates  of hypersensitivity 
reaction (HSR) compared to  those treated  with standard  infusion carboplatin. Ple ase refer  to 
Section 15.2 for details regarding  randomi zation. Patients  in second or third line treatment 
setting  are eligible.  We expect appro ximately 80% and 20% of patien ts to be in these two 
groups  respectively. A HSR is defined as any allergic  or anaph ylactic reaction, regardle ss of 
grade,  judged unlikely, possibly, potentially  or definitely  attributed  to carboplatin  while  on 
study. 
Assuming  type I error  =10%,  power  80%,  one-sided test aiming  to show a decrease from 
20% to 5% in HSR rates, the study would  require  57 pts in each arm using a test for 
binomial  proportion s. Study accrual will be completed  in approximately  two years assuming  
50 pts are accrued per year. Discontinuation  from treatment  prior to 5 cycles is anticipated to 
occur very infrequently  and therefore  patients  with early  discontinuations  will be included in 
the analysis of the primary  endpoint.  
 
Since previous use of carboplatin  might affect the HSR rates, randomi zation will be stratified 
by previous use of carboplatin  (yes/no). The percentage  of patients  who get at least 1 cycle 
of carbopla tin upfront  is 65%,  thus we expect each arm to have 37:20 pts in previous 
carboplatin ( yes/no) group s. In addition  patients will be stratified  based on concurrent 
paclitaxel  or  docetaxel  use  (yes/no).  Patients  may  receive  carboplatin  alone  or  in 
combination with  paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetre xed, gem citabine,  liposomal doxorubicin and 
bevacizumab  at the discretion  of the Investigator. No analysis is planned within  the taxol 
stratifi cation factor since we expect this percentage of patien ts to be small (5-10%).  
 
We will employ continuous  significant testing with a significance level=12%  to moni tor acute 
reactions  (defined  as a allerg ic or anaph ylactic rea ction of any grade excluding those 
attributed  as defin itely not related to carboplatin) with in each arm separate ly and the 
correspond ing stopping  boundaries  are provided in the table  below:

For the secondary  endpoint  of determining  the rate of successful treatment  completion  in 
each arm, we will define  successful treatment  completion  if a patient  completes at  least 5 
cycles of carboplatin  treatment. If the patient comes off for progre ssive disease before cycle 
5 then the patient  would  be considered inevaluable  for this endpoint  and will not be included 
when  calculating  the  secondary  endpoint,  rate  of  successful treatment  comple tion. If  a 
patient  comes off for any other  reason before cycle 5 then the patient would count as a 
"failure"  when calculating treatment  complet ion rates. Discontinu ation of non-carboplatin 
chemotherapy will  not be considered “failure.”  Treatment  completion  rates  will be calculated 
on evaluable  patient s. The rates  in the two arms will be compared  using two-sample te st for 
binomial proportion s. 
 
The analysis of the primary  and secondary endpoints  will include the 114 evaluable  patients 
that were  randomi zed to each arm prior to crossover. Patients  who cross over from Arm A to 
B will be  reported  separately  both in terms  of HSR experien ce and whether they were able  to 
complete  5 cycles in each arm. 
 
We will perform exploratory  analyses to correla te HSR rate  within  each arm separately  to the 
following: history of drug, food and environm ental allergies, history of asthma and history or atopic 
dermatitis (eczema), number  of lifetime  platin um cycles, duration  since last platinum, and 
concomitant  chemotherapy  agent.  
 
Finall y, we will also perform a cost-identifi cation anal ysis to assess the direct medi cal costs 
associated with each treatment  arm. We will capture  the use of all services admin istered at 
MSKCC from trial registration  to completion  of the last cycle of carboplatin.  HSRs occur 
during  chemotherapy  infusion and are mana ged immedia tely within  the medi cal center  and 
as a result, we anticipate that  surveying costs outside of MSKCC will be unnecessary. 
Because the average  age of the patients  enrolled  is anticipated to  be 60, health  service 
utilization will be multiplied by  unit cost values obtained from  Medi care reimb ursement 
schedules  for outpatie nt and inpat ient services. Costs will be summed  and average  direct 
medi cal costs estimated for  each group.  Because cost data are often  skewed,  we will first 
examine  the distribution  of each cost endpoint  and apply  a non-parametric statistical analysis 
or other  method of handling  skewed data as appropriate.  The assessment  of direct med 
costs will allow us to perform a limited  cost-effectiveness analysis, estimating the incremental 
cost per HSR.

written  consent/verbal  script and a completed  Eligibility  Checklist must be faxed to PPR. 
 
15.2    Randomi zation  
 
Patients  will be randomi zed (1:1)  to either  Arm A: standard 30 -minute infu sion carboplatin  or 
Arm B: extended  3-hour infusion carboplatin.  After  all eligibility  criteria is established and 
after consent is obtained, patie nts will be registered through  the Proto col Participant 
Registration (PPR)  system and randomi zed using the Clinical Research Databa se (CRDB). 
Randomi zation  will be accompli shed by the method  of random  permut ed block, and patients 
will be stratified by prior history of  carboplatin  exposure (yes/no) and concurrent  paclitaxel or 
docetaxel use (yes/no). 
 
Pharma cy will view the patient’s  randomization  assignment  in CRDB.  The results will not be 
blinded.  
 
16.0 DATA  MANAGEMENT ISSU ES 
 
A Research Study  Assistant (RSA)  will be assigned  to the study. The responsibilities of  the 
RSA include proje ct complian ce, data  collection, abstraction and entry, data reporting, 
regulatory  monitoring,  problem  resolution  and prioriti zation, and coordinate  the activities  of 
the proto col study team.  The data collected for  this study will be entered  into a secure 
databa se (Clinical Research Datab ase – CRDB).  Sour ce documentation will  be available  to 
support  the electronic patient  record. The following adverse events will be recorded: allerg ic 
hypersensitivity reactions/anaph ylaxis, mood  disturban ce, insomnia,  and hypergl ycemia. 
These will be graded  using CTCAE Version 4.0 and attributed  as Definitel y, Probabl y, 
Possibly, Unlikely or Unrelated  to study treatment.  Labo ratory data  will be tabulated  and 
summari zed by descriptive statistics, as well as on the basis of MSKCC  specified norm al 
range s.

 16.1    Quali ty Assurance  
 
Weekly registration  reports will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals and completene ss of 
registration data.  Routine  data quality reports  will be generated  to assess missing data and  
inconsistencies. Accrual rates  and extent and accuracy of evaluations  and follow-up will be  
monitored  periodi cally throughout  the study period  and potential  problems will be brought  
to the attent ion of the study team  for discussion and action. Random -sample data quality and 
proto col complian ce audits  will be condu cted by the study team,  at a minimum  of two times 
per year, more frequently  if indicated. 
 
16.2    Data  and Safe ty Moni toring  
 
The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center 
were  appro ved by the National  Cancer Institute in Septe mber 2001.  The plans  address the 
new policies set forth by the NCI in the document  entitled  “Policy of the Natio nal Cancer 
Institute  for Data  and Safety  Monitoring of  Clinical Trials” which can be found  at: 
http:// cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/inde x.html . The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC were 
established and are monitored  by the Office of Clinical Research. The MSKCC Data and 
Safety  Monitoring Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at: 
http:// mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/inde x.htm. 
 
There  are several different  mechanisms by which clinical trials are monitored  for data,  safety 
and qualit y. There  are institution al processes in place for quality  assurance (e.g.,  proto col 
monitoring,  complian ce  and  data  verification  audit s,  therapeutic  response,  and  staff 
education  on clinical research QA) and depar tmental  procedures  for quality  control, plus 
there  are two institutio nal committ ees that are responsible for monitoring  the activities of our 
clinical trials program s. The commit tees: Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee (DSMC)  for 
Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data  and Safety  Monit oring Board  (DSMB) for Phase III 
clinical trials, report  to the Center’s  Research Council and Institution al Review Boar d. 
 
During  the proto col development and  review process, each proto col will be assessed for its 
level of risk and degree  of monitori ng required. E very type of proto col (e.g., NIH sponsored, 
in-house sponsored,  industrial sponsored,  NCI cooperati ve group,  etc.) will be addre ssed 
and the monitoring  procedures  will be established at the time of proto col activation.  
 
17.0 PRO TECTION OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
 
Participation in  this trial is voluntar y. The patien ts will be explained  the extent of the risks, 
benefit s, toxicities/side effects, alternati ves/options  for treatment,  finan cial costs/burden s, 
and the voluntary  nature  of the study. All patients  will be required  to sign a statement  of 
informed  consent, which must conform  to IRB guideline s. 
 
Inclusion of Women  and Minoritie s: Because this proto col requires  patients to have ovarian, 
fallop ian tube or primary  peritoneal carcinoma  it will enroll exclusively women.  Patients  of all 
races will be accepted  into the protocol. Mem orial Sloan -Kettering Can cer Center  has filed 
forms  HHS 441 (civil rights), HHS (handi capped individual), 639-A (sex discriminat ion), and 
680 (age discriminatio n); we also take due notice of the NIH policy concerning  inclusion of 
women  and minorities  in clinical research popula tions.

postmenopau sal must be tested for pregnan cy within  14 days of the first dose of study 
medi cation.  
 
Inclusion of Children  in Research 
 
This proto col does  not include children younger  than the age of 21. Ovary, fallopian  tube and 
primary  peritoneal  carcinoma rarely  occur in this age group.  
 
Benefit s: It is possible that this treatment  will result in fewer hypersensitivity reactions  or 
shrinkage of the tumor  or in a stabilization of an otherw ise progre ssing disease. It is not 
known,  of course, whether these or any other  favorable  events will occur. It is not known 
whether  this treatment  will affect the overall survival of the patient s. 
 
Costs: The patient  will be responsible for the costs of standa rd medi cal care, including all 
drug admini stration  fees and all hospitalizations, even for compli cations  of treatment.  
Incentives: No incentives will be offered to patie nts/subjects for participation in the study. 
Alternati ves:  For  patients  with  advanced  ovarian,  fallopi an  tube  or  primary  peritoneal  
carcinoma  who choose not to participate  in this study a range  of standard  options are 
available   including   standard   infusion   carboplatin,  paclitaxel,   d ocetaxel,   gemcitabine, 
liposomal   doxorubi cin,   pemetre xed,   topot ecan,   etoposide,   vinorelbine,   bevacizumab, 
palliati ve surgery  or best supportive care. Patients  may also be eligible  for other 
investigatio nal studies. 
 
Confidential ity: Every effort will be made  to maintain  patient confident iality. Research and 
hospital records are confidenti al. Patient’s  name  or any other  personally  identif ying

Who might benefit financially from this research?
Research studies like this one are designed to determine whether rehabilitation based video 
games are beneficial and enjoyable for persons poststroke.  Rutgers University owns a patent on some of the technology used in the video games being studied.  Dr. Deutsch, the primary investigator in this study, is an inventor of the video games being studied. If these video games were to be commercialized Dr. Deutsch and Rutgers (who owns the patent) would receive a part of the profits from any sales of the video games.

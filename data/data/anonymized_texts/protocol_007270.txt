IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0960 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/26/2020   1. ABSTRACT  (provide a one -paragraph summary of the current seed  project)  
Veterans  with co-morbid  chronic  pain and PTSD  utilize  healthcare  services  at a higher  rate than those  with pain 
or PTSD alone. Unfortunately, there are no integrated treatments for Pain and PTSD. Moreover, non - 
pharmacological treatments for pain such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy are useful in only about 50% of 
cases. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be an effective treatment for pain, and has been 
recently used to ameliorate PTSD symptoms. Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE) is highly effective in treating 
PTSD symptoms. Therefore, we propose to (a) integrate & (b) gather feasibility data for h ome-based tDCS + 
PE for Pain and PTSD with 15  Veterans.  
2. PRIMARY HYPOTHESES AND SPECIFIC AIMS  (provide an NIH -style set of primary hypotheses about the 
project outcomes, and the specific aims that will be  accomplished)  
Chronic pain is one of the most preval ent health conditions among Americans, affecting about a third of the 
general population1. In Veterans, chronic pain is even more common, with a prevalence of about 50%2,3,4,5. For 
instance,  the pain-related  fibromyalgia  diagnosis  is part of Gulf War Syndr ome and is highly  comorbid  with other 
common military service -related health problems such as Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)6. Moreover, 
lack of effective, integrated, and available alternative treatments for chronic pain contributes to the opioid 
epidemic7.Combat  veterans  are more  likely  to develop  PTSD  than civilians,  with 20-30% of Vietnam -era Veterans, 
15-25% of Operation De sert Storm Veterans, and 11 -25% of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi 
Freedom, and Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) Veterans experiencing significant PTSD symptoms8,9 The 
number of veterans with chronic pain and PTSD is expected to grow given the return of personnel from recent 
OEF/OIF/OND conflicts9,10. Veterans with co -morbid chronic pain and PTSD utilize healthcare services at a 
higher rate than those with pain or PTSD alone, leading to an increased burden on healthcare systems 
throughout the Un ited States. Furthermore, opioid medications have been used more frequently to treat chronic 
pain among OEF and OIF Veterans with PTSD, and these Veterans are more likely to incur harmful 
consequences during the course of their care due to these  medication s12. 
The Overall  Aim of the present  proposal  is to integrate,  refine  and investigate  the feasibility  (e.g.,  pilot testing, 
recruitment, attrition, assessment) of tDCS for treating chronic pain with a best practices evidence -based 
treatment for PTSD (i.e., Prolonged Exposure: PE) in 15 veterans, a group for which both pain and PTSD are 
particularly  problematic.  
SA1: Integrate the home -based tDCS+PE Treatment . The investigative team is comprised of Pain, PTSD, and 
salivary biomarker experts who will integrate tDCS into the 12 session PE treatment protocol.  
H1: The 12 session  PE protocol  will yield itself well to tDCS  component  integration  based  on participant  feedback.  
SA2: Test the feasibility  of both the integrated  intervention  and key study  design  features,  including  translational 
research features such as biomarker assessment in a non -randomized trial with 15 Veterans assessed at 
baseline and post -treatment . Feasibility of the home -based tDCS+PE intervention will be measured in terms of 
recruitment  metrics,  assessment  burden,  successful  biomarker  collection,  specification  of biomarker  relationship 
to hypothesized mechanisms of change, treatment attrition, rates of missing data at each measurement time 
point, participant satisfaction, and ratings of treatment face validity. Post treatment key informant interviews will 
be conducted where suggestions for treatment enhancement and satisfaction will be systematically collected 
and analyzed.  
H2 is given in terms of Specific Pre -Defined Milestones for Success, including : 75% of Veterans experiencing 
chronic pain and PTSD who enroll will complet e at least 8 sessions of the integrated treatment, and both 
completers and dropouts will offer actionable suggestions in exit interviews for improving the delivery of the 
intervention. SA2) Feasibility metrics will be acceptable for recruitment rate (two p er month), treatment 
completion of 8 sessions (75%), assessment completion (90%), and good to excellent satisfaction (95%).  
3. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  (provide evidence for the importance of the scientific/clinical problem, 
and how this project will address the problem, including new knowledge to be  gained)  
Chronic Pain: Chronic pain is common in Veterans, with a prevalence of about 50%2,3,4,5. Moreover, pain is 
highly comorbid with other common military service -related health problems such as Posttraumatic S tress 
Disorder (PTSD)6. Pain is an exceedingly costly condition, with estimates from the Institute of Medicine at $560 
to $635 annually for healthcare costs, disability days, and lost wages in the United States10. Moreover, lack of 
effective,  integrated,  and available  alternative  treatments  for chronic  pain is a contributor  to the opioid  epidemic7. 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0960 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/26/2020   Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder: PTSD is characterized by intrusion symptoms, persistent avoidance 
behaviors, negative alterations in cognition and/or mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity11. Combat 
veterans are more likely to develop PTSD than ci vilians, with 20 -30% of Vietnam -era Veterans, 15 -25% of 
Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm Veterans, and 11 -25% of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation 
Iraqi Freedom,  and Operation  New Dawn  (OEF/OIF/OND)  Veterans  experiencing  significant  PTSD  sympto ms8,9. 
3.1. Chronic  Pain  and PTSD: 
Potential  for  Mutual  Symptom  Figure 1  
Exacerbation Avoidance of stimuli associated 
with a traumatic event, as well as hypervigilance 
(with  concomitant  increased  pain perception)  are 
diagnos tic features of PTSD. Patients with 
chronic pain often exhibit avoidance behaviors 
secondary to perceived pain related to physical 
activity, leading to inactivity and weakened 
overall health status. Indeed, the presence of 
shared avoidance behaviors may pr edict poor 
outcomes for individuals experiencing  co-morbid 
pain and PTSD12,13. Research focused on 
treatment approaches that address this shared 
avoidance may be fruitful, given the impact that 
co-morbid pain and PTSD have on  veterans.  
Hyperarousal  and hypervigilance  to bodily  sensations  are also found  independently  in chronic  pain and in PTSD, 
although they likely have an additional synergistic effect on maintaining the negative impacts of both conditions 
when they are comorbid12. Additionally, other PT SD symptoms such as numbness and detachment from others 
are also frequently associated with chronic pain14. Figure 1 presents a thematic diagram illustrating the 
interaction between core characteristics of PTSD and comorbid pain targeted in the present  proposal.  
3.2. Transcranial  direct  current  stimulation  (tDCS).  Noninvasive  brain  stimulation,  such  as transcranial  direct 
current  stimulation  (tDCS),  has received  significant  attention  for the treatment  of pain in chronic  conditions  owing 
to its neuromodulatory effects in the central nervous system15.tDCS involves the application of low -amplitude 
direct  electric  current  to the head  in a noninvasive  and painless  manner,  which  modulates  the resting  membrane 
potentials of neurons, alteri ng the excitability of the targeted cortical area. tDCS is categorized as a “non - 
significant risk” device by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration16,17. Hundreds of clinical trials have 
demonstrated tDCS to be safe and well tolerated within the establishe d current intensities and durations18. For 
pain treatment,  stimulation  is typically  delivered  multiple  times  with the anode  electrode  placed  over the primary 
motor  cortex  and with the cathode  electrode  placed  over the supraorbital  region.  In particular,  a panel  of experts 
of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology published evidence -based guidelines in which they 
recommended 20 -minute tDCS using 2 mA electrical current intensity for possible efficacy among populations 
with chronic pain19. Our group and others have shown that this stimulation produces analgesic effects by 
activating afferents or efferents that connect structures involved in pain processing or by facilitating descending 
pain modulation and improves pain system function through  direct effects on the motor, somatosensory, and 
frontal cortices implicated in pain  sensitivity20,21. 
3.3. tDCS may potentiate treatment outcomes achieved from PE. Since tDCS is a noninvasive and safe 
approach  to facilitate  neuroplasticity22, it may enhance  the brain’s  ability  to adaptively  reorganize  in response  to 
other clinical interventions23, including PE. Because the therapeutic effects of PE are at least partially due to 
adaptive  changes  in pain-related  brain  function,  pairing  tDCS  with PE may augment  the adaptive  brain  changes 
that occur with PE and further reduce pain and PTSD  symptoms.  
3.4. Saliva as a non -invasive Biomarker source for innovative Pain & PTSD related measures: Saliva 
contains numerous biomarkers including proteins, peptides, mRNA, DNA, and  miRNA of both human and oral 
microbial origin24,25,26,27. Molecules such as nerve growth factor (NGF), substance P, dehydroepiandrosterone 
(DHEA), opiorphin28 and calcitonin -gene related peptide (CGRP) are secreted in saliva in response to chronic 
stress and pain29,30. For instance, molecules such as cortisol, DHEA, Substance P, norepinephrine, salivary 
alpha amylase and estrogen have long been proposed to be useful in diagnosis of PTSD31,32,33,34. The  following  

IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0960 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/26/2020   are biomarkers  that have  been  proposed  to be indicative  of development  of PTSD  symptoms,  however  not all of 
them  were  tested  in the saliva  (reviewed  in Andrews,  & Neises35): 1) Neuropeptide  Y, released  from sympathetic  
 
neurons  during  chronic  and sustained  stress36 2) CD14,  associated  with TBI, stroke  and microglial  activity37,38  3) 
S100A8,  marker  of microglia  and macrophages  and elevated  in TBI39 4) S100A10,  shown  to be reduced  in level 
in PTSD  when  compared  with controls40,41  5) TNF, a potent  inflammatory  response  initiator  elevated  in PTSD42 
(6) IL -1, associated with local and systemic inflammation, elevated in PTSD43,44 7) IL -6, a pleiotropic cytokine 
elevated  in PTSD45,46  and 8) GS, a key intracellular  signaling  molecule  associated  with depression  and suicide47. 
Recently salivary alpha amylase has been proposed to be a marker for pain in epilepsy48 and cancer49; salivary 
cortisol and sTNFαRII have been to some degree associated with pain intensity and pain unpleasantness in 
healthy individuals50; salivary chromo granin A level increases after massage therapy suggesting it could be a 
marker for reduced pain perception51. Evidence shows the relevance of tDCS and salivary biomarkers. These 
studies show that tDCS stimulates salivary proteomic changes, especially relat ed to inflammation and stress. 
For instance, IL -10, IL -6, TNF -alpha, CRP, Cortisol, and beta -endorphin have been shown to modify after tDCS 
treatment52,53. As the usefulness of these biomarkers has not yet been fully established in PTSD54,34 further 
valida tion is  critical.  
 
4. INNOVATION  
The means  by which  the current  proposal  addresses  a widely  prevalent  problem  (i.e., Pain comorbid  with PTSD), 
and a national crisis (i.e., opioid addiction following pain treatment), is highly innovative, both in terms its 
treatment integration, and in terms of its use of select biomarkers to specify mechanisms of  improvement.  
 
5. METHODS  (describe the primary plan for data collection, measurement tools, and  timelines)  
Design Overview and Project Timeline: The study team will first integrate home -based tDCS into two of the 
early weeks of the 12 week sessions of PE protocol. The reasoning to conduct tDCS in this way related to PE 
are three  folded:  first, controlling  signaling  of pain to engage  into trauma  treatment  may reduce  dropout  from PE; 
second, research shows some cognition improvement with tDCS which may help patients to understand and 
more  adequately  participate  in aspects  PE treatment  particularly  as the complete  understanding  of the rationale 
of PE at the beginning of the treatment is very important to set the stage for treatment expectation and prevent 
dropout,  and finally  the hypothesized  model  of interaction  of chronic  pain and PTSD  symptomatology,  tDCS  may 
help to reduce  avoidance  behavior  modulated  by pain and PTSD  symptoms.  This will be followed  by a repeated 
measures single group design wherein each of the 15 Veteran participants serves as their own control, with 
major assessments of feasibility, clinical and biomarker indices at pre, mid  and post -treatment (week 13), 
complemented by weekly assessments of key pain and PTSD symptoms. The study will also include with open 
ended key informant interviews following treatment with the 15 participants to derive suggestions for improving 
the integ rated  treatment

5.5. Description of the Informed Consent Process: Informed consent will be administered in private UTH 
TRC offices by approved individual trained in human subjects regulations and informed consent procedures. If 
any participants are illiterate, the consent will be read and explained in the presence of a w itness. Teleconsent 
will also be used when the potential participant is unable to come to the office for the first visit of enrollment 
and to address unforeseeable circumstances, such as the current covid19 crisis. The potential participant will 
digitize ( scan or photograph) a version of the consent they sign, or use a digital signature such as that found in 
Adobe to sign the consent document. This digitized document and signature will then be sent via email, or the 
hard copy will be sent via US postal serv ice mail to the person consenting the potential  participant.  
5.6. Attrition and Retention efforts : Will be addressed in the larger proposal derived from this  pilot.  
5.7. Medication Stabilization. Patients will be asked to maintain medications at current dosages for at least 4 
weeks prior to starting the  trial. 
5.8. Participant Payment : All participants will receive $30 for baseline and $30 for midpoint, $30 for the post - 
treatment clinical and biomarker assessments (insufficient time for follow -up), $15 for tDCS turn over and 
assessment,  and $25 for the feasibility  interview.  Transport ation/parking  in the amount  of $12 will be designated 
for the four in person  visits.  
5.9. Treatment: tDCS and PE  Integration:  
Overview  of tDCS : tDCS  is a non-invasive  neuromodulation  technique  that has been  used  to improved  cognitive 
functions. will be administered with a constant current intensity of 2 mA57 for 20 min per session/ 10 sessions 
total daily for 2 weeks (Monday to Friday), the device is a Soterix 1x1 tDCS mini -CT Stimulator (Soterix  Medical 
Inc., NY) with headge ar and 5 _ 7 cm saline -soaked surface sponge electrodes. The sponge electrodes snap 
into the custom headgear, which is secured to the participant’s head for simple and fail -safe electrode 
preparation. This single -position headgear with clearly labeled spon ge markers eliminated room for user error 
and helped conserve the placement of the montage. Participants will administer a stimulation session via the 
Soterix 1x1 tDCS mini -CT Stimulator only after being provided a single -use code to unlock the device by t he 
research staff once proper contact quality is achieved (only the on/off button will be adjustable by the study 
participants; they will not be able to adjust the device settings). After the participant enters the unlock code, the 
screen on the device wil l show a timer that counted down the minutes until the end of the session. After  20 min, 
the device will turn off automatically, and the study staff will instruct the participant to remove the headset and 
discard the sponges and to safely store all materia ls for the next  session.  
Overview of PE : Prolonged Exposure has been extensively researched, including by the present team (see 
Acierno et al.58), and is an effective treatment for PTSD59 that includes the following components: a) psycho - 
education  about  the common  reactions  to traumatic  events  and presentation  of the treatment  rationale  (sessions 
1 and 2), b) repeated in vivo exposure to traumatic stimuli (in vivo exercises are assigned as homework during 
sessions  3 through  11), c) repeated,  prolonged,  imaginal  exposure  to traumatic  memories  (imaginal  exposure  is 
implemented during sessions 3 through 11; patients listen to session audiotapes for homework between 
sessions), and d) relapse prevention strategies and further treatment planning (session 12). The manual for PE 
is publicly  available.  
Integration  of tDCS and PE: Participants  will come  in person  to the clinic  office  to complete  the baseline  visit and 
the in -person training for the use of both home -based self -administered tDCS and the home -based telehealth 
device (iPad) for the PE sessions. They understand  that they will start the sessions of tDCS once they start the 
in vivo and imaginal  exposures  assignments  at home.  They  will self-administer  (under  televideo  supervision)  the 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0960 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/26/2020   tDCS session before doing in vivo and/or imaginal exposures assignm ents. The participants will be remotely 
supervised by trained research staff at each stimulation to ensure the technique is correct and to monitor any 
adverse events. We will provide secure videoconferencing software (e.g., WebEx) and ensure the participan ts 
are comfortable using the telehealth software.

9. Treatment Acceptability : defined as an overall scale rating from 0 to 10 with 0 being ‘ not acceptable, this 
treatment should not be offered to veterans, those in pain, or those with PTSD ’ to ‘completely acceptable’ “ this 
treatment is perfectly suited to veterans and others with Pain and PTSD  symptoms .” 
10. General Pain Information (Major Assessments):  general information about chronic pain will be gathered to 
include location of pain site(s),  duration of chronic pain at each site, current and prior treatment approaches for 
chronic pain, medical visits related to pain management, and past pain  medications.

21. Biomarker Assessments (Baseline, Mid -Point, Post -Treatment and Follow -ups): Salivary lev els of the 
biomarker panel (cortisol, substance P, DHEA, IL -1, and IL -6) using enzyme -linked immunosorbent assays 
(ELISA).  
Saliva Sample Collection (All major assessments) : Saliva samples will be collected through a passive drool 
method at the beginning an d end of Baseline (first week), Mid -Point (week 6), and Post (week 12) -Treatment. 
Saliva will be naturally allowed to accumulate in the oral cavity and the participant will discharge it into the 
specimen tube (2 mL capacity) with lid.

IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0960 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/26/2020   5.12.  Treatment  Providers  / Interviewers  / Consent  Procedures:  Project  therapist  will have  a master’s  degree 
or higher in clinical psychology, counseling, or social work and be certified to deliver PE. All treatment sessions 
will be audio -taped and 15% of these will be randomly selected and rated for adherence. The PI or Research 
Assistant  will conduct  the consent  procedures  and initial  eligibility  (i.e., baseline)  diagnostic  assessments  for the 
study. The Research Assistant will conduct all major assessments. All assessments will be audio -taped and 
study  personnel  will listen  to a randomly  selected  20% to ensure  reliability  of CAPS  diagnosis  over the course  of 
the study. Pilot trials of this assessment battery indicate that major assessments will take between 75 and 90 
minutes.  
5.13.   DATA ANALYSIS PLAN  (provide a detailed description of how the data will be analyzed, 
focusing specifically on how the data analytic approach is suited to answer the study  aims)  
Analysis Sets & Treatment of Missing Data: Participants who terminate early will be asked to compl ete follow - 
up interviews and their data will be included in analyses following intent to treat standards.  
Descriptive  Analyses  Putative  prognostic  variables  that will be investigated  through  these  descriptive  analyses 
include: demographic factors, number/ type of comorbid diagnoses, participation in non -study treatment for 
comorbid psychopathology, medications (by class), and initial (baseline) intensity/severity levels for the primary 
outcome variables: pain severity, pain interference, and intensity of PT SD (PCL), avoidance behaviors, and 
whether non -study treatments were received for psychopathology symptoms. To investigate potential limits on 
generalizability,  we will compare  demographic  characteristics  of those  who decline  to participate  with those  who 
participate.  
Primary Feasibility Analyses Feasibility Hypothesis SA1) 75% of Veterans experiencing Pain and PTSD who 
enroll in the Pilot will complete the integrated treatment (at least 8 sessions) and both completers and dropouts 
will offer actionable  suggestions  in focus  groups  for improving  the delivery  of the intervention.  We will report  the 
% of veterans who complete the integrated tDCS+PE protocol. We will report the rate of treatment completion, 
including a description of number of sessions comple ted prior to dropping out at the patient level (with 12 
sessions completed being 100% treatment complete/not dropout). In addition to overall measures of treatment 
completion (i.e., session attendance), we will also collect measures of treatment adherence,  as measured by 
percent  of returned,  completed  homework  record  forms  for tCBS  and exposure  practices  in terms  of actual  daily 
assignments completed. All these measures will also be reported in terms of Race and Sex. Feasibility 
Hypothesis SA1) Feasibility metrics will be acceptable for recruitment rate (2 per month), treatment completion 
(75%), assessment completion (90%), and good to excellent satisfaction (95%). A key feature of the proposed 
feasibility  study  is demonstration  that recruitment  of eligible  participants  is possible  for a future  large  scale  RCT. 
Thus, we will report all aspects of CONSORT data in addition to the number of referrals obtained each week. 
Finally,  we will report  the overall  % of missing  data at the item level,  and the rate of asse ssment  completion  and 
partial completion at each time point to examine if assessment timing is optimal. SA1 also includes effective 
collection and use of stress biomarker samples. Finally, Descriptive data on rates / scores for satisfaction, 
credibility, a nd acceptability will be  reported.  
 
6. SUMMARY and SPECIFIC AIMS for ENSUING GRANT APPLICATION (Page 6)  
SPECIFIC AIMS  
Overview:  Chronic  pain is among  the most  pervasive  and expensive  health  complaints  in the United  States67,68. 
Veterans, especially those who present with Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), are particularly likely to 
experience  chronic  pain69,70. Moreover,  pain in the form of fibromyalgia  diagnosis  is actually  a component  of Gulf 
War Syndrome, and is highly c omorbid with other common military service -related health problems such as 
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)6. While effective non -pharmacological treatments for each disorder exist 
independently71,72, there  are no integrated  treatments  for Pain and PTSD; this despite  recognition  of the primacy 
of pain complaints  in combat  Veteran  populations69. Moreover,  evidence -based  non-pharmacological  treatments 
for pain, per se, are effective in only about 50% of cases, with recent meta -analysis findings indicating no 
significant maintenance of effects at 6 or 12 -month followup73. Therefore, we propose to (a) refine & (b) gather 
feasibility data for an  integrated mind -body intervention for Pain and PTSD: tCBS+Prolonged Exposure , with 
the prediction that integrating these treatments will enhance overall  efficacy . 
Given its frequent co -occurrence with mental health conditions, pain is often conceptualized  within a 
biopsychosocial model to explain the multiple dynamic and complex influences that impact its presentation and 
exacerbation73. Extending this model to PTSD supports the conceptualization of a mutual maintenance loop 
between  pain and PTSD,  and sugg ests the potential  benefit,  or perhaps,  necessity  of an integrated  treatment  for 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/26/2020   both disorders, as common mechanisms may underlie symptom exacerbations for both Pain and PTSD74. 
Indeed,  integrating  innovative,  non-pharmacological,  non-invasi ve interventions  such  as tDCS  with an evidence - 
based  treatment  for PTSD  may produce  short -term and long-term benefits  in both PTSD  and pain symptoms  by 
addressing shared  mechanisms.  
 
Thus, the Overall Aim of the present proposal is to integrate, refine and investigate the feasibility (e.g., pilot 
testing, recruitment, randomization, attrition, assessment, etc.) of combining a non -pharmacological, non - 
invasive and short technique for t reating pain (tDCS) and a best practices evidence -based treatment for PTSD 
(i.e., Prolonged Exposure: PE) in Veterans. Establishing feasibility will justify future work directed toward 
assessing the ability of the combined treatment to ameliorate the impac t of shared hyperarousal and avoidance 
symptoms (e.g., pain mediated avoidance and anxiety/fear mediated avoidance; hyperarousal driven pain 
intensification). Moreover, standard psychological PROMIS measures of pain and PTSD will be complemented 
by stress -related  salivary  biomarkers  before,  during,  and after treatment  to test feasibility  and relevance  of these 
measures on pain ratings and PTSD symptoms. Whereas PE and the tDCS techniques already exist, the 
integration of these strategies into a treatment of  acceptable duration, interaction and character must first be 
achieved and pilot tested as proposed  here.  
Toward this end, the Specific Aims of the present proposal are to:  
SA1a : Integrate and Pilot the tDCS+PE treatment . The investigative team is comprise d of Pain, PTSD, and 
salivary biomarker experts who will integrate tDCS and PE into a 12 session tDCS+PE treatment which will 
undergo subsequent pilot testing with 15 Veterans with significant ratings of pain and PTSD diagnosis. Post 
treatment key informan t interviews will be conducted where suggestions for treatment enhancement and 
satisfaction will be systematically collected and integrated into the intervention.  
SA1b : Test the feasibility of both the intervention and key study design features . The investigators will evaluate 
the feasibility  of the integrated  tDCS+PE  intervention  in treating  Pain and PTSD  measured  in terms  of recruitment 
metrics,  randomization  processes,  assessment  burden,  salivary  biomarker  collection,  specification  of biomark er 
relationship to hypothesized mechanisms of change, treatment attrition, rates of missing data at each 
measurement time point, participant satisfaction, and ratings of treatment face  validity..  
SA2: Observe a preliminary signal of treatment effects in te rms of Pain and PTSD symptoms . We will derive 
preliminary effect size approximations associated with intervention and comparison conditions in terms of 
primary symptom outcome measures.  
Specific hypotheses include: SA1a) 75% of Veterans experiencing pain a nd PTSD who enroll in the Pilot 
phase  will complete  the integrated  treatment  and both completers  and dropouts  will offer actionable  suggestions 
in focus groups for improving the delivery of the intervention. SA1b) Feasibility metrics will be acceptable for 
recruitment rate (4 per month), successful randomization (100%), treatment completion (75%), assessment 
completion  (90%),  and good  to excellent  satisfaction  (95%).  SA2)  A preliminary  signal  based  on baseline  to post- 
treatment symptom changes for pain and PTSD measures will be  acquired.

Title:   A Phase 2, Multicenter , Randomized, Open -label Trial Assessing the Efficacy and Safety 
of Talimogene Laherparepvec Neoadjuv ant Treatment Plus Surgery Versus Surgery Alone for 
Resectable, Stage IIIB to IVM1a Melanoma
Study Phase:   2
Indication:   Neoadjuvant treatment of talimogene laherparepvec for resectable, stage IIIB to 
IVM1a melanoma .
Primary Objective:   To estimate the tr eatment effect of neoadjuvant talimogene laherparepvec 
plus surgery compared to surgery alone on recurrence -free survival (RFS) .
Secondary Objectives:   The secondary objectives are:
To estimate the effect of neoadjuvant talimogene laherparepvec plus surger y com pared to 
surgery alone on 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year RFS
To estimate the effect of neoadjuvant talimogene laherparepvec plus surgery compared to 
surgery alone on rate of histopathological tumor -free margin (R0) surgical resection
To estimate t he effect of neoadjuvant talimogene laherparepvec on rate of pathological 
complete response (pCR)
To estimate the effect of neoadjuvant talimogene laherparepvec plus surgery compared to 
surgery alone on local recurrence -free survival (LRFS) , regional recur rence -free survival 
(RRFS) ,and distant metastases -free survival (DMFS)
To estimate the effect of neoadjuvant talimogene laherparepvec plus surgery compared to 
surgery alone on 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 5-year, and overall survival (OS)
To estimate response to neoadjuvant talimogene laherparepvec overall and separately in 
injected and uninjected lesions during treatment (Arm 1 only)
To evaluate the safety of neoadjuvant talimogene laherparepvec plus surger y compared to 
surgery alone
Hypotheses:   Formal hypoth eses will not be tested in this trial.  The study will provide an 
estimate of the treatment effect, as measured by the difference in RFS of talimogene 
laherparepvec neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery compared to surgery alone in subjects 
with resectab le, stage IIIB to IVM1a melanoma.
Primary Endpoint:   RFS .
Secondary Endpoints:   The secondary endpoints are:
1-year, 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year RFS
Rate of histopathology tumor -free margin (R0) surgical resection
Rate of pCR
LRFS
RRFS
DMFS
1-year, 2-year, 3-year,and 5 -year, and overall survival
Overall tumor response and tumor response in injected and uninjected lesions (Arm 1 only )

CONF IDENTIA LStudy Design: This is a phase 2, multicenter, ra ndom ized, open -label study to estimate the 
efficacy  of talimogene laherparepvec as a neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery compared 
to surger y alone in subjects with completely resectable stage IIIB, IIIC, or IVM1a melanoma.  
Approximately 150 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive the following:
Arm 1:   Talimogene laherparepvec for 6 doses followed by surgical resection of melanoma 
tumor lesion(s) .
Talimogene Laherparepvec:
Talimogene laherparepvec will be administered by intralesional injection in to the 
injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal tumors initially at a dose of 106 plaque 
forming units (P FU)/mL at day 1 of week 1 followed by a dose of 108 PFU/mL at day 1 
(±3days) of week 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 or until all injectable tumors have disap peared, or 
intolerance of study treatment, whichever occurs first.  Due to the mechanism of action of 
talimogene laherparepvec , subjects may  experience transient growth in existing tumors 
or the appearance of new tumors prior to maximal clinical benefit of talimogene 
laherparepvec .  Subjects who experience growth in existing tumors or the appearance of 
new tumors will be allowed to remain on talimogene lah erparepvec treatment until 
week 12 of therapy unless, in the opinion of the investigator, immediate sur gical resection 
or any other treatment for melanoma is warranted .  If talimogene laherparepvec 
treatment will end p rior to week 12, the investigator or designee should notify the 
sponsor’s medical monitor as soon as possible.
Surgical Resection of Melanoma Tumor Lesions(s):
For subjects who complete 12 weeks of talimogene laherparepvec treatment, surgical 
resection of melanoma lesion(s) will be performed at any time during weeks 13 to 18.  
Refer to Appendix Ffor surgery guidelines. Subjects who stop talimogene laherparepvec 
prior to week 12 due to disappearance of all injectable tumor lesions, intolerance to 
talimogene laherparepvec ,or any other reason will undergo surgical resection of 
melanom a lesion(s) or tiss ues where melanoma was present before achieving complete 
response ( CR)within 1 to 6weeks after the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec.  If 
surgery will be performed prior to week 12, the investigator or designee should notify  the 
sponsor’s medical mon itor as soon as possible.
Arm 2:   Immediate surgical resection of melanoma tumor lesion(s) 
Surgical resection of melanoma tumor lesion(s) will be performed after randomization any
time during weeks 1 to 6.  Refer to Appendix Ffor surgery guidelines.
Randomization will be stratified by disease stage (IIIB nodal versus IIIB in -transit versus IIIC 
nodal versus IIIC in -transit with nodal versus IVM1a) ,planned adjuvant therapy (adjuvant 
systemic therapy [eg, interfero nalpha (INFα ), ipilimumab ] with or without radiotherapy versus
radiotherapy without adjuvant systemic therapy versus none).
Following surgery, adjuvant sy stemic therapy and/or radiotherapy may be administered at the 
investigator ’sdiscretion and per the i nstitutional standard of care.
Subjects will be followed for safety  approximately 30 (+ 15) day s after surgery and for disease 
recurrence (local, regional ,or distant) , subsequent anticancer therapy for melanoma , adverse 
events thought to be potentially rel ated to talimogene laherparepvec (Arm 1 only) ,and survival 
every3 months (±30days) for first 3 years after the end of the safety  follow -upperiod and then 
every6 months (±30days)until death, subject withdraws full consent, or up to 5 year safter the 
last subject is randomized .  Thereafter, subjects randomized to Arm1 who received at least a 
single dose of talimogene laherparepvec will be followed under an ongoing separate registry 
protocol (Study 20120139) for the long -term survival follow -up of subj ects treated with talimogene 
laherparepvec.  The registry protocol will also monitor for late and long -term adverse events 
thought to be potentially related to talimogene laherparepvec and use of subsequent anticancer 
therapy for melanoma .Subjects who after the long -term follow -up period of this study

safety follow -up visit and then ever y 6 m onths ( ±30 days) until distant disease recurrence, death, 
subject withdraws full consent, or up to 5 yearsafter the last subject is randomized ,whichever is 
first.
After the long -term follow -up period of this study has ended, subjects randomized to Arm1 who 
received at least a single do se of talimogene laherparepvec andwho end the study for any 
reason other than death or withdrawal of full consent will be followed for survival under an 
ongoing separate registry protocol (Study 20120139) that is in place for the long -term follow -up of 
all subjects treated with talimogene laherparepvec in clinical trials.  The registry protocol will also 
monitor for late and long -term adverse events thought to be potentially related to talimogene 
laherparepvec and use of subsequent anticancer therapy for m elanom a.  Subjects who after the 
long-term follow -up period of this study (Study  20110266) will elect to participate in the registr y 
study must sign new informed consent form before any registry protocol -specific activities.
Reporting Exposure to Talimogene Laherparepvec (Arm 1 only) :
Reporting potential or known unintended exposure to talimogene laherparepvec, suspected 
related signs or sy mptoms, and detection of talimogene laherparepvec in a subject’s household 
memb er, caregiver, or healthcare provider as specified in Section 9.4.
For a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please 
refer to Section 7and the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2and Table 3).
Statistical Considerations:
The primary  analysis for the primary  endpoint will occur at the later time of either the occurrence 
of approximately 64 events (local , regional ,or distant recurrence of melanoma or death) or 
approximately 2 years after the end of randomization.   An 80% confidence interval ( CI)will be

CONF IDENTIA Lestimated for the RFS hazard ratio (HR) and the between -arm difference ( Arm2 – Arm1) in 
2-year RFS , ie,2-year RFS .  It is assumed that: (i) RFS is exponential over the first 2 years, 
(ii) the 2 -year RFS for Arm1 is about 0.60 ( Eggermont et al, 2008 ), and that there will be a 
10% exponential probability of drop -out by the primary analysis . The average width of the 
2-year RFS 80% CI was 0.20 based on the simulation with an approximately 150 subjects 
randomized 1:1 to the two arms.  
Two interim analyses with no formal stopping rules are planned to evaluate safety and some 
efficacy  endpoi nts (eg, R0 resection rate, pCR rate, response to neoadjuvant treatment) when 
approximately 40 and 75 subjects randomized to talimogene laherparepvec have had the 
opportunity to complete the safety follow -up visit . The primary  analysis for certain seconda ry 
endpoints (eg,response to neoadjuvant treatment, R0 resection rate, pCR rate, and safety ) will 
be performed using the data from the second interim analysis.
An additional third interim analysis with no formal stopping rule is planned to evaluate 
RFS ap prox imately 1 year after the end of randomization.  This analysis will be conducted 
by the Amgen study team.
The primary  analyses for RFS will occur at the later time of either the occurrence of 
approximately 64 events ( local, regional ,or distant recurren ce of me lanom a or death ) or 
approximately 2 years after end of randomization.
The final analyses will occur approximately 5 years after the end of randomization . An additional 
analysis will also occur approximately 3 years after the end of randomization .
Ad hoc analyses for safety or some efficacy  endpoints (eg,response to neoadjuvant treatment, 
R0 resection rate, pCR rate) may be conducted before the planned primary and/or final analy ses
if interim data arerequired for submission to regulator y authoriti es.
All efficacy  analy ses will be descriptive with no formal hypothesis testing. Kaplan -Meier (KM)
estimates and CI will be calculated for RFS, LRFS, RRFS, DMFS, OS landmarks ( 1-, 2-, 3-and 
5-year rates) and quartiles.  Estimates and CIs for between -group differences will also be 
calculated.  An overall between -group difference in RFS, LRFS, RRFS, DMFS, and OS will be 
evaluated with a log -rank test and corresponding proportional hazards model with or without two 
randomization stratification factors. Estimates and exact CIs for binar y endpoints (eg, overall 
tumor response, response in injected and uninjected lesions, R0 rate, pCR) and their associated 
between -group differences will be calculated .
Subject incidence rates of treatment- emergent adverse events (including all adverse events, 
grade ≥ 3 adverse events, fatal adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events of 
interest and events requiring the discontinuation of study drug, local effects on the tumor [ie, pain, 
inflammation and ulceration]) will be summarized.
Theanalyses of tumor tissue or serum biomarkers may be performed after collection of all 
samples during the conduct of the study and therefore may be reported after the primary analysis 
of efficacy  endpoint.

2. BACKGROUND A ND RATIO NALE
2.1 Melanoma and Adjuvant and Neoadjuvant Therapy for Melanoma
Cutaneous melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in men and the seventh most 
common cancer in women in the United States of America (USA), with an estimated 
76, 100 new cases and 9,710 deaths expected in 2014 ( Siegel et al, 2014 ).  In Europe,

Protocol Number:  20110266
Date:  23 March 2018 Page 18of 100
CONFIDENTIA Lthe annual incidence of melanoma is somewhat lower than that in the USA, with a crude 
rate of approximately 14 per 100,000 as compared to 20 per 100,000 in the USA 
(Ferlay et al, 201 3).  In Europe as a whole, 100, 442 new cases of skin melanoma and 
22, 212 deaths from melanoma were estimated in 2012 ( Ferlay et al, 201 3).  The 
incidence of melanoma in Australia is the hig hest in the world, with the age -standardized 
incidence rate of approximately 50 per 100,000 people in 2009 ( Australian Institute of 
Health and Welfare, 2012 ).  The incidence of melanoma is increasing rapidly worldwide, 
with a 270% increase in the USA between 1973 and 2002.  This increase is the most 
rapid of any cancer with the exception o f thyroid cancer in women ( Edwards et al, 2005 ; 
Siegel et al, 2014).  Median age for diagnosis of melanoma (59 years) is significantly 
lower than the median age of diagnosis for the more common solid tumors.  As such, 
melanoma is second only to adult leuke mia in terms of loss of years of potential life per 
adult cancer -related death ( Coit et al, 2013 ).
When discovered in earlier stages and fully excised, melanoma is highly curable with 
10-year overall survival (OS) approaching 95% for stage I and 45- 77% for stageII 
(American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC], 7thedition) melanoma ( Balch et al, 2009 ).  
It is estimated that about 10% of subjects with m elanoma present with 
regionally -advanced disease (stage III) and approximatel y 30% will have nodal and/or 
in-transit metastasis as their first site of recurrence ( Kirkwood et al, 2000; SEER, 201 4).  
While radical resection is a cornerstone of treatment for subjects with stage III 
melanoma (Slingluff et al, 2011; Coit et al, 2013 ), the majority of subjects with cl inically 
detectable nodal metastases and/or in -transit disease wil l experience recurrence, with 
5-year OSof 59% for subjects with stage IIIB disease and 40% for IIIC disease 
(Balch etal, 2009 ).  In one of the latest adjuvant trials utilizing pegylated interferon alpha
(IFNα)- 2b, 4 -year RFS and OS of all subjects with palpable nodal disease 
(N2-N3, AJCC, 7thedition) in the observation gr oup were 33.9 ± 2.6% and 46.8 ± 2.6% 
respectively, dropping sharply with the amount of lymph nodes involved 
(Eggermont etal, 2008 ).
Approximately 20% of subjects with earlier stages of melanoma will develop distant 
cutaneous/subcutaneous or distant nodal metastasis in the absence of visceral disease 
or elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (stage IVM1a) ( Kirkwood et al, 2000).  Stage 
IVM1a melanoma has better prognosis compared with metastases located in any other 
distant anatomic site, with 1 -year OS of 62%, and 5 -year OS approaching 30%

CONFIDENTIA L(Balch etal, 2009 ).  Resection, if feasible, is often recommended for this group of 
subjects ( Sling luff et al, 2011; Coit et al, 2013 ).
High-dose (HD) IFNα ( Intron®A, 2013) or pegylated IFNα ( Sylatron , 2013 ) are the 
FDA-approved systemic therapies that can be considered in subjects after resection of 
stage III melanoma.  Other treatment options recomm ende d by the National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and European Society for Medical Oncology 
(ESMO) Guidelines include participation in clinical trials, or observation 
(Dummer etal,2012 ; Coit et al, 2013).  Even with a higher rate of relapse than stageIII 
disease, there is littleevidence to support adjuvant treatment with IFN α for resected 
IVM1a melanoma.
HD IFNα has shown a modest, but significant RFS benefit when given as adjuvant 
therapy to subjects with melanomas at high risk for recurrence ( Kirkwood et al, 2000 ; 
Kirkwood et al, 1996 ).  A pooled analysis of three major adj uvant trials with HD IFNα 
found an improvement in RFS in subjects with melanomas that are 4 mm or thicker with 
no evidence of lymph node involvement, or stage III melanomas with either lymph node 
involvement and/or in -transit metastases (hazard ratio [HR] 0.77, two -sided p < 0.006, 
median follow -up of 7.2 years), but failed to demonstrate a significant improvement in 
OS (HR 0.93, two- sided p = 0.42) ( Kirkwood et al, 2004).  Major toxicities of HD IFNα 
include flu- like symptoms, auto -immune disorders, hepato toxicity, significant laboratory 
abnormalities, depression, and suicide (Slingluff et al, 2011).  As such, adjuvant HD 
IFNα after resection of stage III melanoma is decreasingly being utilized 
(Coitetal,2013 ) and is not recommended as a standard of care for adjuvant therapy 
according to the guidelines of several professional societies ( Marsden et al, 2010 ; 
Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, 2013 ).
Intermediate -dose regimens of pegylated IFNα, which are more convenient to 
administer and have bee n evaluated in several clinical trials , demonstrated improved 
RFS (HR 0.82, p = 0.011, 95% confidence interval [ CI]: 0.71; 0.96), however there 
wasno effect on DMFS or OS, and toxicity was signific ant with grade 3 adverse 
events in approximately 40% of s ubjects; leading to discontinuation of therapy in 
about one -third of subjects assigned to the treatment arm (Eggermont et al, 2008 ;
Eggermont etal,2005 ).
A recently reported intergroup phase III trial compared a HD IFN α regimen to a 9 -week 
“biochemotherapy” consisting of dacarbazine, vinblastine, cisplatin, intravenous 
interleukin (IL) -2, and subcutaneous IFNα as adjuvant treatment for patients after

CONFIDENTIA Lresection of high -risk stage III melanoma. At a median follow -up of 6 years, 
biochemotherapy improved RFS (HR 0.77, p < 0.02; 90% CI: 0.62-0.96), however there 
was no difference in OS (HR 1.0, p = 0.49, 90% CI: 0.78-1.27) and same 56% of 
subjects were alive at 5 years in both arms of the trial. The biochemotherapy regime n 
was associated with substantial toxicity with grade 3 and 4 adverse events in 36% and 
40% of subjects, respectively ( Flaherty et al, 2012 ).
Several meta -analyses have confirmed a significant effect of adjuvant IFN α on RFS 
andsome demonstrated small but significant improvement in OS ( Wheatley et al, 2007 ; 
Wheatley et al, 2003; Mocellin et al, 2013; Mocel lin et al, 2010 ). In the latest Cochrane 
meta -analysis that included aggregate patient data from 17 randomized c linical trials 
comparing adjuvant IFNα to observation, adjuvant IFNα was associated with improved 
disease- free survival (HR 0.83, p<0.00001, 95% CI: 0.78-0.87) and improved OS 
(HR0.91, p<0.003, 95% CI :  0.85-0.97) ( Mocel lin et al, 2013). The authors 
concluded that 35 participants needed to be treated in order to prevent 1 subject death 
of cutaneous stage II -III melanoma (95% CI: 21-108), confirming modest efficacy of 
adjuvant IFNα ( Mocel lin et al, 2013 ).
A variety of whole -cell based and defined antigen -based melanoma vaccines were 
explored in the adjuvant setting. However, the results of the trials either showed no 
benefit or could possibly be detrimental compared with observation 
(Eggermont etal,2008; Blanchard et al, 2013 ).
Recently, ipilimumab, a cytotoxic lymphocyte associated antigen 4 ( CTLA -4)inhibitor, 
was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the adjuvant 
treatment of patients with cutaneous melanoma with pathologic involvement of regional 
lymph nodes of more than 1 mm who have undergone complete resection, including 
total lymphadenectomy ( Yervoy , 2015 ).This approval was based on results of a 
randomized double- blind phase 3 trial conducted in 951 patients with completely 
resected stage IIIA (> 1 mm nodal involvement ), IIIB ,and IIIC melanoma 
(EORTC Study 18071). Patients with in -transit metastases were excluded. Ipilimumab 
improved recurrence -free survival (primary endpoint) in this trial from 17.1 months to 
26.1 months (HR0.75; 95% CI 0.64– 0.90; p=0.0013). Resu lts of OS and distant
metastasis -free survival (secondary endpoints) are pending. Fifty-two percent of 
patients randomized to the ipilimumab arm discontinued treatment because of toxicity, 
5patients (1%) died because of ipilimumab -related toxicities. Forty -six percent of

CONFIDENTIA Lpatients in the ipilimumab arm experienced grade 3 adverse events 
(37% immune -related), and 8% grade 4 (6% immune -related) (Eggermont et al, 2015 ).
Neoadjuvant therapy, the benefit of which has been demonstrated in several operable 
cancers ( Bosset et al, 2006 ;  Rastogi et al, 2008 ; Vergote et al, 2010 ), has potential 
advantages over adjuvant therapy in subjects with locally -advanced disease which 
include down -sizing of the primary tumor, consequently increasing the probability of 
negative margin resection, and early systemic exposure to potentially effective therapy 
through intact blood and lymphatic vessels.  Moreover, neoadjuvant therapy allows 
real-time assessment of antineoplastic effects of the therapy in vivo on tumor cells, 
tumor mic roenvironment and the immune system, and permits prospective and 
sequential collection of tissue samples for biomarker studies.
This investigational approach for preoperative treatment of subj ects with 
locally -advanced melanoma was utilized in several phas e2 trials where the subjects 
were treated by intravenous high -dose IFNα ( Moschos et al, 2006) or by 
biochemotherapy ( Buzaid et al, 1998 ; Koy anagi et al, 2005; Lewis et al, 2006 ).  
Ninety -two subjects with histologically -proven stage III nodal melanoma were enrolled in 
the phase 2 study to receive 2 cycles of preoperative biochemotherapy followed by 
surgery and 2postoperative cycles of biochemotherapy ( Lewis et al, 2006).  Treatment, 
which included cisplatin, dacarbazine, vinblastine, and IL -2 and IFNα, was administered 
in the inpatient setting and included growth factors and blood pressure support.  
Common adverse events were hematological grade 3 and 4 toxicities ,electrolytes 
grade 3 toxicities ,and nausea and vomiting . Nearly 40% of subjects required do se 
reductions and 40% had treatment delays.  Among fifty subjects with measurable 
disease, complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rates were 4% and 22%, 
respectively (assessed by W orld Health Organization [ WHO]criteria [ WHO handbook for 
reporting results of cancer treatment, 1979]).  Half of the subjects (50%) had stable 
disease (SD) and 8% had tumor progression.  At the time of surgery, 26% of  subjects 
with measurable disease had pCR.  In another neoadjuvant trial, 20 subjects with 
palpable regi onal lymph node metastatic melanoma we re treated by preoperative 
high-dose IFN for 4 weeks followed by surgery and postoperative subcutaneous IFN for 
48weeks ( Moschos et al, 2006 ).  CR was noted in 1 (5%) subject and 10 subjects (50%) 
had PR.  At the time of surgery, 15% of subjects had pCR.  Immunohistoche mical 
analysis of pre -and post -treatment tumor biopsies revealed increases in peritumoral 
CD4+ T-lymphocytes and endotumoral monocyte -derived dendritic cells after the

CONFIDENTIA Ltreatment with high -dose IFNα.  Clinical responders compared with non -responders 
demonstrated a trend toward greater increases in endotumoral monocyte -derived 
dendritic cells ( Moschos et al, 2006 ).
Limited clinical experience with neoadjuvant temozolomide administered for 6 weeks for 
two 8- week cycles to 19 patients, while well tolerated resulted in objective response in 
3patients only (2 had CR and 1 had PR), stable disease in 4 patients, and tumor 
progression in 12 patients while on treatment ( Shah et al, 2010 ).
2.2 Talimogene Laherparepvec Background
Talimogene laherparepvec is an intralesionally -delivered oncolytic immunotherapy 
comprised of a genetically engineered herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1) that 
selectively replicates in tumor s (Talimogene Laherparepvec Investigator’s 
Broch ure,2015 ).  The neurovirulence factor ICP34.5 and the ICP47 -encoding gene are 
functionally deleted in the virus, while the gene for human granulocyte macrophage 
colony -stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is inserted. The ICP34.5 functional deletion allows 
the virus to replicate selectively in tumors.  The role of ICP47 is to block antigen 
presentation to major histocompatibility complex class I and II molecules by blocking the 
transporter associated with antigen processing 1 and 2. This deletion also allows the 
increas ed expression of the US11 gene.  This promotes virus growth in cancer cells 
without decreasing tumor selectivity.
Additionally, the virus contains the coding sequence for human GM -CSF, a pleiotropic 
cytokine involved in the stimulation of cellular immune r esponses by promoting the 
generation of dendritic cells from blood monocytes ( Demir et al, 2003 ; Lonial, 2004 ; 
Conti and Gessani, 2008 ).  Dendritic cells have the capaci ty to capture antigens, 
migrate in response to chemotactic stimuli, and induce prolifer ative responses and 
Th1cytokine production in CD4+ and CD8+ T -lymphocytes ( Hart, 1997 ; Steinman, 2001 ; 
Ikeda et al, 2004 ; Paul, 2007 ).  Th1 -type cytokines have the capacity to produce 
proinflammatory responses, eradicate tumors, and perpetuate autoimmune responses 
(Nishimura et al, 2000; Ikeda et al, 2004 ; Knutson and Disis, 2005 ).
The postulated dual mechanism of action of talimogene laherparepvec comprises : 
1)adirect oncolytic effect achieved by infection and replication of the virus in tumor 
tissue r esulting in tumor cell lysis and local release of tumor antigens, and 
2)enhancement of a systemic immune response by expression of GM -CSF i n the tumor 
microenvironment to recruit and activate antigen presenting cells.  Clinical data currently 
available have provided evidence of talimogene laherparepvec’s efficacy in subject s with

CONFIDENTIA Lunresectable metastatic melanoma ( Talimogene Laherparepvec Investigator’s 
Brochure ,2015 ).  In particular, a high rate of CR was achieved (16% )in the 
phase 2study with talimogen e laherparepvec in stage lllC to IV melanoma 
(Senzer etal,2009 ; Talimogene Laherparepvec Investigator’s Brochure 2015 ). 
Moreover , responses were observed in both injected and uninjected sites, including 
visceral sites.  Responses were seen most often in earlier stage disease, including 
stage lllB/C and stage IVM1a, and in disease with lower visceral burden.
In the open -label, randomized, phase 3 study in 436 subjects with stages lllB, lllC, and 
IVunresectable melanoma, intralesional talimogene laherparepvec or subcutaneous 
GM-CSF were administered at least until week 24, or CR, clinically significant disease 
progression, intolerable side effects, 12 months of therapy without an objective 
response, or withdrawal of consent (Study 20110263; OPTiM).  If sub jects were in 
response (CR or PR) at 12 months, they wer e treated in both arms up to 18 months or 
disease progression (PD), whichever was earlier. The primary endpoint of the OPTiM 
study wasdurable response rate (DRR) , defined as the rate of subjects wit h an objective 
response (CR or PR) by central review lasting continuously for 6 months and starting 
any time within 12 months of initiating therapy. Secondary endpoints included OS, best 
response, modified PFS , tumor burden and safety.
Primary analysis of the OPTiM Study showed a statistically significant difference 
between the DRR among subjects treated with talimogene laherparepvec 
(16% ; 95% CI:  12%, 21%) versus those treated with GM -CSF (2%; 95% CI :  0%, 5%) 
(p-value <0.0001) ( Andtbacka et al, 2013 ).At the same analysis median modified PFS 
was 8.2 (95% CI, 6.5 ,9.9) months in the talimogene laherparepvec arm versus 
2.9(95% CI, 2.8, 4.0) months in the GM -CSF arm (HR=0.42; 95%CI=0.32 , 0.54). An 
improvement that closely approached statistical significance was seen in the

HR of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.00) ,p = 0.051 . Median OS of subjects treated with

(Kaufman et al, 2014). Survival at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months in the talimogene 
laherparepvec arm was estimated to be 74%, 50%, 39% and 33%, respectively, and 
69%, 40%, 3 0% and 21% in the GM -CSF arm, respectively. In exploratory subset

of talimogene laherparepvec objective responders and 48% of talimogene laherparepvec 
durable responders exhibited “interval progression”, which is transient locoregional or 
distant progression including appearance of new lesions, before ultimately achieving 
response (Kaufman et al, 2013 ). When investig ator-reported response rates (decrease

Recently ,talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic ) was approved inthe USA for the local
treatment of unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal lesions in patients with 
melanoma recurrent after initial surgery (with limitation of use: Imlygic has not been 
shown to improve overall survival or have an effect on visceral metastases) 
(Imlygic Prescribing Information, 2015 ),in Europe for the treatment of adults with 
unresectable melanoma that is regionally or distantly metastatic ( stage IIIB, IIIC ,and 
IVM1a) with no bone, brain, lung or other visceral disease
(Imlygic Summary of Product Characterist ics, 2015 ), and in Australia as monotherapy
for the treatment of melanoma in patients with unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, 
or nod al lesions after initial surgery (Imlygic Prescribing Information, 2015 ). 
Refer to the latest version of Talimogene Laherparepvec Investigator’s Brochure for 
additional information.
2.3 Rationale
The main purpose of the study is to estimate the ability of talimo gene laherparepvec 
administered prior to surgery to increase RFS in subjects with resectable stage IIIB to 
IVM1a melanoma.
It is expected that neoadjuvant treatment with talimogene laherparepvec will improve 
both local and distant control by achieving high er rates of tumor -free ( negative )margin 
surgical resection (R0), and will decrease distant metastasis rate through systemic 
effects on micrometastatic disease.
Since talimogene laherparepvec is assumed to work via activation of the immune system
and infiltrating T cells have also been shown to be prognostic for melanoma 
(Erdag etal,2012 ), it is important to understand whether the number and type of tumor 
infiltrating and peripheral immune cells impact drug efficacy. Therefore , tumor and blood 
samples wi ll be collected before and at the end of the talimogene laherparepvec 
treatment to investigate the relationship between the activities of the immune system, 
such as cytotoxic CD3+/CD8+ and CD8+/CD45R0 T -lymphocytes, tumor antigen 
specific T cells, regulato
ry T cells and myeloid- derived suppressor cells measured both 
in the tumor and /orin the peripheral blood, and response to the treatment.  Additionally, 
a number of immune -related biomarkers, such as antibodies to melanoma antigens and
expression of immune- stimulatory and immune -inhibitory molecules (eg CTLA-4,

CONFIDENTIA Lprogram cell death -1 [PD-1], program cell death- 1 ligand 1 [PD -L1] and others) in tumors 
or tumor infiltrating T -cells will be assessed to determine any association with clinical 
outcomes .
Moreover, tumor biopsy samples will be assessed for mutations effecting viral 
replication, such as double- stranded RNA -activated protein kinase (PKR)that cells 
activate to protect themselves from viral infection andwhose activity may predict clinical 
response to treatment with talimogene laherparepvec.  Also, safety of talimogene 
laherparepvec, especially related to postoperative complications will be evaluated.
2.4 Clinical Hy potheses
Formal hypotheses will not be tested in this trial.  The study will provide an estim ate of 
the treatment effect, as measured by the difference in RFS of talimogene laherparepvec 
neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery compared to surgery alone in subjects with 
resectable, stage IIIB to IVM1a melanoma.
3. EXPERIMENTA L PLA N
3.1 Study  Design
This i s a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, open -label study to estimate the efficacy of 
talimogene laherparepvec as a neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery compared to 
surgery alone in subjects with resectable stage IIIB, IIIC, or IVM1a melanoma .  
Approxima tely 150 subjects with completely resectable melanoma and at least one 
injectable lesion will be randomized 1:1 to receive the following:
Arm 1: Talimogene laherparepvec for 6 doses followed by surgical resection of 
melanoma tumor lesion (s).
Talim ogene Laherparepvec :
Talimogene laherparepvec will be administered by intralesional injection into the 
injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal tumors initially at a dose of 
106plaque forming units ( PFU)/mL at day 1 of week 1 followed by a dose of 
108PFU/mL at day 1 (±3days) of week s4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 or until all injectable 
tumors have disappeared, or intolerance of study treatment, whichever occurs 
first.  Due to the mechanism of action of talimogene laherparepvec , subjects may 
experience transient growt h in existing tumors or the appearance of new tumors 
prior to maximal clinical benefit of talimogene laherparepvec . Subjects who
experience growth in existing tumors or the appearance of new tumors will be 
allowed to remain on talimogene laherparepv ec treatment until week 12 of 
therapy unless, in the opinion of the investigator, immediate surgical resection or

CONFIDENTIA Lany other treatment for melanoma is warranted.   If talimogene laherparepvec 
treatment will end prior to week 12, the investigator or designee should notify the 
sponsor’s medical monitor as soon as possible.
Surgical Resection of Melanoma Tumor Lesions(s) :
For subjects who complete 12 weeks of talimogene laherparepvec treatment, 
surgical resection of melanoma lesion(s) will be performed at any time dur ing 
weeks 13 to 18.Subjects who stop talimog ene laherparepvec prior to week 12

laherparepvec ,or any other reason will under goadequate surgical resection of 
melanoma lesion( s)or tissue where melanoma was present before achieving 
CR,within 1 to 6weeks after the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec .  If 
surgery will be performed prior to week 12, the investigator or designee should 
notify the sponsor’s medical monitor as so on as possible .  Refer toAppendix F
for surgery guidelines.
Arm 2: Immediate surgical resection of melanoma tumor lesion(s) 
Surgical resection of melanoma tumor lesion(s) will be performed after enrolment
anytime during weeks 1 to 6. Refer to
 Appendix Ffor surgery guidelines.
Randomization will be stratified by disease stage (IIIB nodal versus IIIB in- transit versus
IIIC nodal versus IIIC in- transit withnodal versus IVM1a ),planned adjuvant therapy 
(adjuvant systemic therapy [ eg,INFα , ipilimumab ]with or without radiotherapy versus
radiotherapy without adjuvant systemic therapy versus none ).
Following surgery, adjuvant systemic therapy and/or radiotherapy may be administered 
at the investigator ’sdiscretion and per the institutional standard of care.
Subjects will be followed for safety approximately 30 (+ 15) days after surgery and for 
disease recurrence (local, regional ,ordistant ), subsequent anticancer therapy for 
melanoma , adverse events thought to be potentially related to t alimogene 
laherparepvec ,and survival every 3 months (±30days) for first 3 years after the end of 
the safety follow -upperiod and then every 6months (±30days) until death, subject 
withdraws full consent, or up to 5 year safter the last subject is random ized, which is 
first.  Thereafter, subjects randomized to Arm1 who received at least a single dose of 
talimogene laherparepvec will be followed under an ongoing separate registry protocol
(Study 20120139) for the long- term survival follow -up of subjects t reated with talimogene 
laherparepvec.  The registry protocol will also monitor for late and long -term adverse
events thought to be potentially related to talimogene laherparepvec and use of

5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT
Before subjects begin participat ion in any st udy-specific activities/procedures, Amgen 
requires a copy of the site’s written institutional review board /independent ethics 
committee (IRB/IEC )approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and all other 
subject information and/or recruitment material , if applicable (see Section 11.2).All
subjects must personally sign and date the informed consent form before 
commencement of study -specific activities /procedures.
Upon confirmation of eligibility, the site staff will use the Interactive Voice Response 
(IVR) system to randomize a subject.  The investigator is to document this decision and

CONFIDENTIA Ldate in the subject’s medical record and in/on the enrolment case report form(CRF).A 
subject is considered enrolled upon randomization in the IVR system.
Each subject who enter sinto the screening period for the study (defined as the point 
when the subject signs the informed consent) receive sa unique subject identification 
number before any study -related activit ies/proced ures are performed.  The subject 
identification number will be assigned by the IVR system. This number will be used to 
identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study 
documentation related to that subject.
Subjects who are determined no teligible after screening must be screen- failed in the 
IVR system and the reason for the screen failure provided. Subjects who do not meet all 
eligibility criteria may be rescreened once at the discretion of the investigator. If a 
subject is being rescree ned, he or she may need to reconsent to the study to ensure that 
the IRB/IEC approved main consent form is signed within 28 days of randomization. 
Subjects who are determined not eligible after rescreen must be screen -failed in the IVR 
system and the reason for the screen -failure provided. Subjects may be randomized 
only once into this study.
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical 
study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, includi ng if a subject is 
rescreened. This number will not necessarily be the same as the randomization number 
assigned for the study.

talimogene laherparepvec will be up to 4.0 mL of 106PFU/mL.  The second injection up 
to 4.0mL of 108 PFU/mL, should be administered 21 (+5) days after the initial injection 
(ie, no sooner than day 22 but should not be delaye d more than 5 days after the 21 -day 
time point).  Subsequent injections up to 4.0 mL of 108 PFU/mL should be given every 
14(±3) days until week 12, all injectable tumors have disappeared, or intolerance of 
study treatment, whichever occurs first.
The maximum volume of talimogene laherparepvec administered at any dose is 4.0 mL 
for any individual lesion.  The maximum dose in any treatment is 4.0 mL.  Investigators 
are encouraged to use the maximum amount whenever lesions allow.  Dose reduction 
for adverse events is not allowed.  However, if in the course of administration of 
talimogene laherparepvec the subject cannot tolerate the full dose due to an 
injection -related adverse event such as pain, the total volume given should be recorded, 
and the reason for intolerance should be documented as an adverse event.
The recommended volume of talimogene laherparepvec to be injected into the tumor(s) 
is dependent on the size of the tumor(s) and should be determined according to the 
injection volume guideline in Table 1 .  The tumor size assessment for the injection 
should be done by clinical exam using a ruler or caliper for cutaneous lesions and 
palpable and protruding subcutaneous and nodal lesions, or by measurements under 
ultrasound of deep -seated subcutaneous and nodal lesions.

CONFIDENTIA LAll reasonably injectable lesions (cutaneous , subcutaneous, and nodal disease that can 
be injected with or without ultrasound guidance) should be injected with the maximum 
dosing volume available on an individual dosing occasion ( Table 1 ).  On each treatment
day, prioritization of injections is recommended as follows:
any new injectable tumor that has appeared since the last injection
by tumor size, beginning with the largest tumor 
any previously uninjectable tumor(s) that is now injectable
It is recommended that each lesion should receive the maximum amount possible to 
inject due to tumor properties at each visit before moving on to the next lesion, using the 
prioritization model above and the injection volume guideline based on tumor size per 
Table 1 . Lesions should be injected until the maximum volume per day (4.0 mL) has 
been reached or there are no further injectable lesions, whichever comes first.
A subject will be treated with talimogene laherparepvec until week 12, all injectable 
tumors have disappeared, or intolerance of study treatment, whichever occurs first.  Due 
to the mechanism of action, subjects may experience transient growth in existing tumors 
or the appearance of new tumors prior to maximal clinical benefit of talimogene 
laherparepvec.  Therefore, subjects will be allowed to remain on talimogene 
laherparepvec treatment until week 12 of therapy unless, in the opinion of the 
investigator, immediate surgical resection or any other treatment for melanoma is 
warranted.   If talimogene laherparepvec t reatment will end prior to week 12, the 
investigator or designee should notify the sponsor’s medical monitor as soon as 
possible.
The dose, start date, and lot number of talimogene laherparepvec are to be recorde d on 
the CRF.
6.2.1.2 Dosage A djustments ,Delay s, Rules for Withholding or Restarting , 
Permanent Discontinuation
Dose reductions of talimogene laherparepvec are not permitted, other than with respect 
to a reduction in the volume injected due to a disease response.
If a subject experiences any of the following treatment -related toxicities, talimogene 
laherparepvec administration should be delayed until the toxicity has resolved to at least 
CTCAE grade 1 or has returned to baseline:
grade 2 or greater immune -mediate d adverse events, with the exception of vitiligo
grade 2 or greater allergic reactions
any other grade 3 or greater hematologic or non -hematologic toxicity 
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec
Protocol Number:  20110266
Date:  23 March 2018 Page 37of 100
CONFIDENTIA LSubjects who are receiving talimogene laherparepvec may not receive systemic 
antiherpetic drugs (eg, acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir), but may receive a topically 
administered antiherpetic drug more than 20 cm from a talimogene laherparepvec 
injection site. Dosing should be permanently discontinued if, in the opinion of the 
investigator, the subject develops clinical evidence of any systemic herpes infection 
(such as encephalitis or disseminated infection).
If the subject requires corticosteroid dosing of >10 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent) 
for related toxicities, talimogene laherparepvec dosin g must be withheld until the 
corticosteroid dose has decreased to <10 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent).
All necessary supportive care therapies shall be available to subjects except for those 
listed in Section 6.8.  Talimogene laherparepvec treatment should be continued based 
on the potential benefit/risk assessment of the subject.
If talimogene laherparepvec treatment is delayed by >1 week, that dose will be deemed 
to have been missed and the subject will proceed to the next scheduled treatment visit.
If talimogene laherparepvec dosing is delayed by more than 4 weeks from the date of 
the planned dose (ie, approximately 6 weeks from the previous dose) due to the 
occurrence of an adverse event that is considered related to talimogene laherparepvec, 
the subject must be permanently withdrawn from tali mogene laherparepvec treatment.
If talimogene laherparepvec dosing is delayed by more than 4 weeks from the date of 
the planned dose (ie, approximately 6 weeks from th e previous dose) for reasons other 
than treatment -related toxicity, the case must be reviewed by the Amgen medical 
monitor in conjunction with the investigator to determine if the subject can resume 
talimogene laherparepvec therapy.
Talimogene laherparepve cis to be permanently discontinued for subjects meeting any of 
the following criteria:
The subject, for any reason, requires treatment with another anticancer therapeutic 
agent for treatment of the study disease (other than the exceptions noted in 
Section 6.5).  In this case, discontinuation from the treatment occurs immediately 
upon introduction of the new agent.
A grade 2 or greater immune- mediated adverse event (with the exception of vitiligo)
or allergic reactions attributed to t alimogene laherparepvec that would require a dose 
delay of greater than 4 weeks from the date of the pl anned dose (ie, approximately 
6weeks from the previous dose).
Note: immune -mediated glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, and pneumoni tis,and 
exacerbation of psoriasis have been observed in subjects receiving talimogene 
laherparepvec in clinical trials.  Most of these subjects had a history of other 
autoimmune disease and/or prior treatment with agents that offered plausible 
alternative etiologies, however, immune -mediated adverse events can potentially 
involve any organ system.

CONFIDENTIA LAny other t alimogene laherparepvec -related non -hematologic or hematologic 
toxicities grade 3 or greater occur that, in the opinion of the investigator, would 
require a dose delay of greater than 4 weeks from the date of the planned dose 
(ie,approximately 6 weeks from the previous dose).
The subject develops clinical evidence of any systemic herpes infection (such as 
encephalitis or disseminated infection).
A fema le subject becomes pregnant or fails to use acceptable method(s) of effective 
contraception (for those subjects who are able to conceive) while on talimogene 
laherparepvec treatment .
A female subject -breast feeds a child while on talimogene laherparepvec treatment.
Concurrent medical illness that, in the judgment of the investigator, would make 
continued treatment with t alimogene laherparepvec dangerous for the subject.

A signed and dated IRB -approved informed consent must be obtained before any 
study -specific procedures are performed.  Procedures that are part of routine care are 
not considered study -specific procedures and may be us ed at screening to determine 
eligibility.  All subjects will be screened for eligibility before randomization .  Only eligible 
subjects will be randomized into the study.
During treatment, assessments and procedures can be performed within 3 days of the 
planned visit.  It is recommended that dosing occur on the same day of the week (eg, if 
first dose is administered on Monday, all subsequent doses should be administered on a 
Monday), however a ±3- day dosing and study procedure window is allowed.

7.2.4 Long -term Follo w-up
All randomized subjects will be contacted by telephone, or clinic visit, to assess survival 
status , collect adverse events deemed by the investigator to be p otentially related to 
talimogene laherparepvec (Arm 1 only), and, if applicable, commencement of any 
subsequent anticancer melanoma therapy .  Follow -up will occur every 3 months 
(±30days) for 3 years following the safety follow -up visit and then every 6 months 
(±30days) until death, subject withdraws full consent, or up to 5 year safter the last 
subject is randomized , which is first .
Radiographic tumor imaging, clinical tumor assessments, and tumor response 
assessments, will be performed as documented i n Section 7.2.2 every 3 months 
(±30days) for 3 years following the safety follow -up visit and then every 6 months 
(±30days) until distant disease recurrence, death, subject withdraws full consent, or up 
to 5yearsafter the last subject is randomized ,whichever is first .  Local and regional 
recurrences will be reported until appearance of distant recurrence, or end of study, 
whichever is first. Local recurrence is defined as histologically or cytologically co nfirmed 
reappearance of melanoma in the area of up to 2 cm from the scar from the surgical

(excludes local recurrence) is defined as histologically, cytologically ,or radiographically 
confirmed reappearance of melanoma in the regional lymph node basin. New in -transit 
melanoma metastas esin the regional lymphatic drainage will be reported as regional 
recurrence. Histological or cytological confirmation of new in -transit metastases is 
recommended but is not required. Distant metastases exclude local and regional 
recurrence and will include distant cutaneous/subcutaneous metastases, distant nodal 
metastases ,or visceral ,central nervous system , brain, orbone metasta ses.
After the long -term follow -up period of this study has ended, subjects randomized to 
Arm1 who received at least a single dose of talimogene laherparepvec andwho end the 
study for any reason other than death or withdrawal of full consent will be followed for 
survival under an ongoing se parate registry protocol (Study 20120139) that is in place 
for the long -term follow -up of all subjects treated with talimogene laherparepvec in 
clinical trials.  The registry protocol will also monitor for late and long -term adverse 
events thought to be potentially related to talimogene laherparepvec and use of 
subsequent anticancer therapy for melanoma. Subjects who after the long -term 
follow -up period of this study (20110266) will elect to participate in the registry study 
must sign new informed consent form before any registry protocol -specific activities . 
7.2.5 Reporting Exposure to Talimogene Laherparepvec

with the subject is suspected t o have been exposed to tal imogene laherparep vec 
(eg,have or who have had signs or symptoms suspected to be herpetic in origin or was 
accidentally exposed to talimogene laherparepvec), report the potential or known 
unintended exposure to talimogene laherparepvec, suspected related signs or 
symptoms, and detection of talimogene laherparepvec in a subject’s household member, 
caregiver, or healthcare provider as specified Section 9.4.
7.3 Biomarker Development
Biomarke rs are objectively measured and evaluated indicators of normal biologic 
processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic 
intervention.  In oncology, there is particular interest in the molecular changes underlying 
the oncogenic processes that may identify cancer subtypes, stage of disease, assess 
the amount of tumor growth, or predict disease progression, metastasis, and responses 
to investigational product .

respond positively or negatively to talimogene laherparepvec.
7.3.1 Blood Samples
Blood samples are to be collected for biomarker development at time points designated 
in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 andTable 3) and as described in
Section 7.2.2 .
Blood samples (both cells and plasma) will be analyzed for changes in the immune 
system before and during treatment that correlate with cl inical response.  Tumor 
antigen -specific cytotoxic T cells will be enumerated in blood samples by assays which 
count T cells thatbind or secrete cytokines in response to tumor antigen specific 
peptides such as the enzyme -linked immunosor bent spot ( ELISPOT )or tetramer assay.  
Changes in circulating immune cells will be characterized by flow cytometry to 
enumerate the number of immune cell subsets such as T cells, B cells and NK cel ls.  
Tcell subsets will also be characterized for activat ion markers such as HLA -DR and 
CD25.  Additional assays which may be performed on blood samples include measuring 
antibody responses to melanoma antigens, changes in circulating cytokine levels before 
and during treatment, and RNA transcript profiling of c irculating blood cells.
Refer to the Laboratory Manual for detailed collection and handling procedures for blood 
samples for biomarker development.
7.3.2 Tumor Tissue Samples
Archived Tumor Tissue Sample:
A block of formalin- fixed paraffin -embedded tumor tissue collected prior to the study is to 
be sent to the central laboratory along with the corresponding pathology report as 
described in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 andTable 3 ) and in Section 7.2.2 .
The tumor block is to be carefully selected by a pathologist or a skilled experienced 
histology associate to include generous tumor tissue using the Pathology Report as a 
guide.   In the event that m ultiple tumor blocks with generous tumor tissue are available, 
the most recent block should be submitted.  In lieu of a block, approximately 
20unstained sections on charged slides from the same block can be submitted.  
Analyses of tum or-specific mutations or epigenetic changes may be performed 
(eg,somatic mutations) on tumor tissues.
Refer to Laboratory Manual for specific instructions on tumor block/slide preparation.

CONFIDENTIA LTumor Biopsy  Samples:
On-study biopsies will be collected, as described in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2and Table 3 ) and in Section 7.2.2 , to characterize the mechanism of systemic
action of talimogene laherparepvec.  Refer to the Laboratory Manual for specific 
instructions on tumor biopsy procedures.
Immunohistochemistry at a central laboratory will be used to measure the number of 
infiltrating CD8+ T cells in tumor biopsy samples collected before and after treatment as 
well as in archival tumor samples. Tissue slides will be stained for CD8+ cells and 
scanned to create a digital image. Image analysis software will be used to exclude 
areas of adjacent normal tissue, necrotic tissu e and large blood vessels and to define 
the region of interested which will be measured in square millimeters (mm2). Within the 
region of interest, the image analysis software will measure the number of CD8+ T cells 
and report the number of CD8+ T cells p er square millimeter (#CD8+ cells/mm2).   In 
addition to CD8 +cells, a variety of other tumor infiltrating immune cell markers may be 
explored by immunohistochemistry such as CTLA-4, FoxP3, PD-1, PD -L1, IDO, 
granzyme, and others.  The tumor samples will als o be analyzed for mutations or other 
changes within the PKR pathway , that could make tumor cells more susceptible to
talimogene laherparepvec viral replication.
7.4 Pharmacogenetic Studies
If the subject consents to the optional pharmacogenetic portion of this study, DNA 
analyses on blood samples may be performed.  These optional pharmacogenetic 
analyses focus on inherited genetic variations to evaluate their possible correlation to the 
disease and/or responsiveness to the therapies used in this study .  The goa ls of the 
optional studies include the use of genetic markers to help in the investigation of cancer 
and/or to identify subjects who may have positive or negative response sto talimogene 
laherparepvec .  No additional samples are collected for this part of the study.  DNA may 
be extracted from blood of subjects who consent to pharmacogenetic analyses,.
7.5 Sample Storage and Destruction
Any blood or tumor samples collected according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2and Table 3 ) can be analyzed for any of the tests out lined in the protocol and 
for any tests necessary to minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to 
ensure analytical methods produce reliable an d valid data throughout the course of the 
study .  This can also include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, 
incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.

If informed consent is provided by the subject, Amgen cando additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand the
cancer, the dose response and/or prediction of response to talimogene laherparepvec, 
characteriz ation of antibody response, and characteriz ation of aspects of the molecule 
(eg, mechanism of action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be 
documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  
Samples can be retained for up to 20 years.
Since the evaluations are not expected to be available in time to benefit the subject 
directly or to alter the treatment course, the results of qPCR testing from swabs of cold 
sores, vesicles, and other lesions suspected to be herpetic in origin will not be provided 
unless requested by the investigator or the subject.  Results may not be available until 
the end of the study.  Results of biomarker development or other exploratory studies are 
not placed in the subject’s medical record and are not to be made available to the 
subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other third parties, except as 
specified in the informed consent.
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by 
contacting th e investigator.  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining 
blood or tumor samples and any other components from the cells can be located and 
destroyed.  Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are 
completed.  However, information collected from samples prior to the request for 
destruction, will be retained by Amgen.
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or d erivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the 
request of the subject through the investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as 
appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentat ion with a certain sample type no 
longer justifies keeping the sample).  If a commercial product is developed from this

9. SAFETY DA TA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING
9.1 Adverse Events
9.1.1 Definition of A dverse Events
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial 
subject.  The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the 
investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record.
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre- existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition (eg, diabetes, migraine 
headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration, and/or has an 
association wi th a significantly worse outcome.  A pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened during the study or involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery 
or a medical procedure while on study ,is not considered an adverse event.

Protocol Number:  20110266
Date:  23 March 2018 Page 59of 100
CONFIDENTIA LIf the severity of a n adverse event worsens from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record a single event for each increased level of severity on the Adverse 
Event Summary CRF.  The investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events 
until stabilization or reversibility.
For situations when an adverse event or serious adverse event is due to melanoma ,
report all known signs and symptoms.   Death due to disease progression in the absence 
of signs and symptoms should be reported as the primary tumor type (eg, met astatic 
pancreatic cancer).
Note:   The term “disease progression” should not be used to describe the adverse 
event.  
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally acceptable representative request sto withdraw from protocol -required therapies
or the study due to an adverse event ,refer to Section 8.1for additional instructions o n 
the procedures recommended for safe withdrawal from protocol -required therapies or 
the study.
9.1.2 Definition of Serious A dverse Events
A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the 
following serious criteria:
fatal
life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)
requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
congenital anomaly/birth defect
other medically important serious event
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).
If an i nvestigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, or ev ents that necessitate 
an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.

CONFIDENTIA LThe criteria for grade 4 in the CTCAE grading scale differs from the regulatory criteria for 
serious adverse events. It is left to the investigator’s judgment to re port these grade 4 
abnormalities as serious adverse events.
9.2 Reporting of A dverse Events
9.2.1 Reporting Procedures for A dverse Events That do not Meet Serious 
Criteria
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the 
investiga toror reported by the subject that occur after randomization through the safety 
follow -up visit (ie, 30 [+ 15] days after surgery) are reported using the applicable CRF
(eg, Adverse Event Summary).
The investigator must assign the following adverse event a ttributes:
Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms),
Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved) ,
Severity [and/or toxicity per protocol],
Assessment of relatedness to talimogene laherparepvec or surgery , and
Actio n taken.
The adverse event grading scale used will be the CTCAE version 3.0.   The grading 
scale used in this study is described in Appendix A.  The investigator must assess 
whether the adverse event is possibly related to talimogene laherparepvec or surgery .  
This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  Is there a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by talimogene 
laherparepvec or surgery ?
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any 
study -mandated activity and/or procedure (including any screening procedures ).  This 
relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is there a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by a study activity and/or 
procedure”?
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory 
findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment 
or adjus tment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  W here applicable,

CONFIDENTIA Lclinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event.
The investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility. 
9.2.2 Reporting Procedures for Serious A dverse Events
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the informed 
consent through the s afety follow -up (ie, 30 [+ 15] days after surgery) are recorded in the 
subject’s medical record and are submitted to Amgen .  All serious adverse events must 
be submitted to Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the 
event via the ap plicable CRF.
After the protocol -required reporting period defined above, the investigator does not 
need to actively monitor subjects for serious adverse events.  However, if the 
investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event after this protocol -required 
reporting period, the investigator willreport the event to Amgen within 24 hours following 
the investigator’s knowledge of the event .  Serious adverse events reported outside of 
the protocol -required reporting period willbecaptured within the safe ty database as 
clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited reporting.
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the 
serious adverse event , the information is to be reported to Amgen via an electronic 
Serious Adverse Event (eSAE) Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event .  See Appen dixBfor a sample of the Serious 
Adverse Event W orksheet /eSAE Contingency Report Form . For EDC studies where the 
first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to Amgen via the eSerious 
Adverse Event Contingency Report Form, the data must be entered into the EDC 
system when the system is again available.
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
talimogene laherparepvec or surgery .  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” 
response to the question:  Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been 
caused by talimogene laherparepvec or surgery ?

been caused by a study activity/procedure”?
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization 
or reversibility.
New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be 
submitted to Amgen .  All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to 
Amgen within 24 hours following knowledge of the new information.  The investigator
may be asked to provide additional follow -up information, which may include a discharge 
summary or extracts from the medical record.  Information provided about the serious 
adverse event must be consistent with that recorded on the applicable CRF (eg, Adverse 
Event Summary CRF).
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapies because of a 
serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to Amgen.
Amgen will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators /institu tions, and IRBs/ IECs 
in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and good 
clinical practice (GCP) .
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/ IEC of  serious adverse events occurring 
at the site and other adverse even t reports received from Amgen, in accordance with 
local procedures and statutes.

9.4 Reporting of Exposure to Talimogene Laherparepvec
If ahousehold member, caregiver, or healthcare provider who has had close contact 
with a subject treated with talimogene laherparepvec on this study is suspected to have 
been exposed to talimogene laherparepvec (eg, have or who have had signs or 
symptoms suspected to be herpetic in origin or who have been accidentally exposed to 
talimogene laherparepvec) , while the subject is taking talimogene laherparepvec, report 
the exposure to Amgen as specified below.  In addition to reporting an unintended 
exposure case during the study treatment, investigators should monitor for potential 
exposure cases that occur after the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec through 
30(+15)days after the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec.
Any potential or known unintended exp osure should be reported to Amgen within 
24hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event of exposure.  Amgen will seek to 
follow up with the exposed individual, if necessary, to collect more information about the 
exposed individual contact with clini cal trial subject, signs and/or symptoms related to 
the exposure, medical history, and/or outcome of the exposure.  If the exposed individual 
is reporting sign or symptoms suspected to be related to talimogene laherparepvec 
exposure, the exposed individual may be asked to have a swab taken to evaluate for the 
presence of talimogene laherparepvec in the lesion.

CONFIDENTIA L10.1.1.2 Secondary  Endpoint
Efficacy  Endpoints:
1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 5 -year RFS: The Kaplan -Meier (K -M) estimate of RFS rate at 
1-year, 2years , 3yearsand 5 years
Rate of histopathology tumor -freemargin (R0) surgical resection
Rate of pathological complete response (pCR)
Local recurrence -free survival (LRFS) : Time from randomization to the date of the 
first of local dise ase recurrence or death due to any cause.   Local recurrence is 
defined as histologically or cytologically confirmed reappearance of melanoma in the 
in the area of up to 2 cm from the scar from the surgical excision or at the edge of 
the skin graft if that was used for closure
Regional recurrence -free survival (RRFS) :Time from randomization to the date of 
the first of regional disease recurrence or death due to any cause.  Regional 
recurrence excludes local recurrence and is defined as histologically, cytologically ,or 
radiographically confirmed reappearance of melanoma in the regional lymph node 
basin. New in -transit melanoma metastases in the regional lymphatic drainage will 
be reported as regional recurrence.  Histological or cytological confirmation of new 
in-transit metastases is recommended but is not required.
Distant metastases free survival (DMFS) : Time from randomization to the date of the 
first of distant metastases or death due to any cause. Distant metastases exclude 
local and regional recurr ence and will include distant cutaneous/subcutaneous 
metastases, distant nodal metastases ,or visceral ,central nervous system , brain, or
bone metastases.
Overall survival (OS) : Time from randomization to death due to any cause
1-year, 2-year, 3 -year and 5-year survival : The Kaplan- Meier (K -M) estimate of the 
survival rate at 1-year, 2years, 3yearsand 5 years
Overall tumor response and tumor response in injected and uninjected lesions 
(
Arm1 only):  The tumor response is evaluated up to the surgical re section.  The 
overall tumor response is per the modified W HO ( Appendix D).  For tumor response 
in injected and uninjected lesions both subject -level and lesion -level response will be 
assessed.  The subject -level i njected and uninjected responses will be based on the 
tumor burden of only injected index lesions including injected new measurable 
lesions, or the tumor burden of only uninjected index lesions including uninjected 
new measurable lesions, respectively.  Th e lesion -level response will evaluate the 
change of the area of each individual lesion.  For the tumor response based on the 
tumor burden of a subset of lesions (injected/uninjected lesions) or individual lesions, 
a response is achieved if the percentage o f tumor burden reduction from baseline is 
at least 50%.  The related endpoints, such as time to response, may also be 
evaluated if appropriate.

10.1.2 Analysis Sets
Intent to Treat A nalysisSet
The primary analysis of all efficacy endpoints of the study will be conducted on the intent 
to treat analysis set defined as all randomized subjects who were randomized to either 
treatment arm.  All subjects will be analyzed according to their treatm ent randomiz ation.
Safety  Analysis Set
The safety analysis set will include all subjects who received talimogene laherparepvec
or surgical resection of melanoma tumor lesion(s) .  The safety analys es will be 
performed by treatment received.
Efficacy  Analysi sSet
The efficacy analysis set will include all subjects in Arm 1 who received at least one 
dose of talimogene laherparepvec andsurgical resection of melanoma tumor lesion(s)
and all the subjects in Arm2 who received surgical resection of melanoma tumor
lesion(s) .  In addition, all subjects in the efficacy analysis set must have achieved 
histopathologic tumor -free margin (R0) status after surgery and should not have any 
important protocol deviation swhich may affect the efficacy endpoints. The efficacy 
analysis set may be used for sensitivity analysis of efficacy endpoints if needed.
10.1.3 Covariates and Subgroups
Besides the stratification factors ,the following covariates may be used to examine 
efficacy and safety in subgroups or in multivariate analyses:
Region, if applicable (USA or non -USA)
Age at baseline: < 50, ≥ 50; < 65, ≥ 65; < 75, ≥ 75 years
Number of measurable tumors at baseline

10.2 Sample Size Considerations
All analyses will be descriptive with no formal hypothesis testing.  The primary objective 
of the study is to estimate the treatment effect, as measured by the hazard ratio of RFS, 
of talimogene laherparepvec neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery ( Arm1) compared 
to surgery alone ( Arm2) in subjects with resectable, stage IIIB to IVM1a melanoma.
Approximately 150 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive Arm1 vs Arm2 stratified 
by:(i) disease stage (IIIB nodal vs IIIB in -transit vs IIIC nodal vs IIIC in -transit with nodal 
vs IVM1a) ,and (ii) planned adjuvant therapy ( adjuvant systemic therapy [ eg,INFα , 
ipilimumab ]with or without radiotherapy vs radiotherapy without adjuvant systemic 
therapy vs none ).
Primary efficacy analysis o fRFS will be based on the Intent to Treat Analysis Set . An 
overall between -group difference in RFS will be evaluated with a log -rank test and 
corresponding proportional hazard model without stratification. The Kaplan -Meier (KM) 
method will be use d to estimate 1-year, 2-year, 3 -year, 5 -year, and overall RFS.  
Subjects who are not confirm ed to be disease -free post -surgery (ie, who do not have an 
R0surgical outcome) or who withdraw prior to surgery will be considered a failure a day 
after randomization for RFS.
The primary analysis for the primary endpoint will occur at the later time of either the 
occurrence of approximately 64 events ( local, regional ,or distant recurrence of 
melanoma or death ) orapproximately 2 years after the end of randomization . An 
80% CI will be estimated for the hazard ratio of RFS.  In addition, an 80% CI will also be 
estimated for the between- arm difference ( Arm2 – Arm1) in 2 -year RFS, ie, 2-year 
RFS.  It is assumed that: (i) RFS is exponential over the first 2 years, (ii) the 2- year RFS 
for Arm1 is about 0.60 ( Eggermont et al, 2008 ), and that there will be a 10% exponential 
probability of drop -out by the primary analysis.  Simulations were used to evaluate the 
following parameters assuming possible true 2-year RFS values of 0.05, 0.10, 
and0.15:  (i) the average 2-year RFS 80% CI and its width, (ii) the probability that the 
2-year RFS 80% CI is above 0, and (iii) the average number of events at the primary 
analysis.  The possible true 2-year RFS values were translated to a RFS hazard ratio 
(HR) ( Arm2 relative to Arm 1) and the HR 80% CI and the probability of it being

Designees
As this is an open -label study, the investigators/ site personnel and the trial participating 
subjects will know the treatment assignments.
10.4 Planned A nalyses
10.4.1 Interim A nalyses
Two interim analyses with no formal stopping rules are planned to evaluate safety when 
approximately 40 and 75 subjects randomized to talimogene laherparepvec have had 
the opportunity to complete the safety follow -up visit .A Data Review Team (DRT) 
independent of the talimogene laherparepvec product team will review the first interim 
analysis (seeSection 10.4.2 ).  The DRT will also review some efficacy endpoints 
(eg, R0 resection rate, pCR rate, response to neoadj uvant treatment).
Thetalimogene laherparepvec product team will review the second interim analysis 
because it will occur after all subjects have been already treated ,have completed safety 
follow -up
, and no additional interventions that may influence safe ty or efficacy of the 
investigational product are planned after this time point .  The talimogene laherparepvec 
product team will also review some efficacy endpoints (eg, R0 resection rate, pCR rate, 
response to neoadjuvant treatment).

CONFIDENTIA LAn additional third i nterim analy sis with no formal stopping rule is planned t o 
evaluate RFS approximately  1year after the end of randomization.  This analysis 
will be conducted by  the Amgen study  team .
Ad hoc analyses for safety or some efficacy endpoints (eg,response to ne oadjuvant 
treatment, R0 resection rate, pCR rate) may be conducted before the planned primary 
and/or final analyses if interim data arerequired for submission to regulatory authorities.
These ad hoc analyses will be executed by the talimogene laherparepv ec product team.
10.4.2 Data Review Team (DRT)
The DRT will consist of one Amgen biostatistician and twoAmgen clinicians (one from 
Clinical Development and one from Global Safety )who collectively have experience in 
oncology clinical research and in the conduct and monitoring of randomized clinical 
trials. In addition , the DRT may include one or more external clinical expert(s) ( eg, a 
surgical oncologist in melanoma) not directly involved in the conduct of the study. The 
DRT will be supported by a statistician internal to Amgen but independent of the 
talimogene laherparepvec product team .  The DRT will review unblinded safety data at 
the first interim analys is. This independent DRT will be governed by a study -specific 
DRT charter.
10.4.3 Primary Analysis
The primary a nalyses for RFS will occur at the later time of either the occurrence of 
approximately 64 events ( local, regional, or distant recurrence of melanoma or death ) or 
approximately 2 years after end of randomization .The primary analysis for certain 
secondary endpoints will be performed using the data from the second interim analysis 
(eg, resp onse to neoadjuvant treatment, R0 resection, pCR , exploratory correlative 
endpoints related to neoadjuvant treatment outcomes , and safety).
10.4.4 Final A nalysis
The final analys es will occur approximately 5 years after end of randomization .
10.4.5 Additional A nalysis 
An additional analysis will also occur approximately 3 years after end of randomization .
10.5 Planned Methods of A nalysis
10.5.1 General Considerations
All analyses will be descriptiv e with no formal hypothesis testing.
In principle, mean, standard deviation, median, first and third quartiles, minimum and 
maximum will be calculated for continuous variables; frequency and percent will be

CONFIDENTIA Lcalculated for binary and categorical variables. Graphical summaries of the data may 
also be presented.
Analyses of tumor tissue or serum biomarkers may be performed after collection of all 
samples during the conduct of the study and therefore may be reported after the primary 
analysis of efficacy endpo int.
The primary analysis for efficacy endpoints will be performed on the Intent to Treat
Analysis Set by randomized treatment. Some of the analysis will be repeated on the
Efficacy Analysis Set by treatment actually received. Safety analys es will be conducted 
on the Safety Analysis Set.
10.5.2 Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint
An overall between -group difference in RFS will be evaluated with a log -rank test and 
corresponding proportional hazards model without stratification. A log-rank test and 
proportional hazard smodel with stratification by the two randomization factors will be 
also conducted .If warranted due to actual adjuvant therapy, these analyses will be 
repeated stratifying on actual rather than planned adjuvant therapy and/or adjuvant 
therapy containing sel ected types of immunotherapy. Multivariate proportional hazards 
models may be used to explore the prognostic and/or predictive value of baseline 
factors.
10.5.3 Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints
KM estimates will be calculated for RFS, LRFS, RRFS, DMFS, OS landmarks 
(1-,2-, 3-and 5 -year rates) and quartiles.  Greenwood’s formula ( Kalbfleisch and
Prentice, 1980 ) for standard error will be used to calculate CIs for each group and 
between -group differences in landmark KM rate estimates.  CIs for quartiles of each 
group will be estimated per Brookmeyer and Crowley ( Brookmeyer and Crowley ,1982 ) 
and bootstrap methods will be used to estimate CIs for between -group differences.  For 
each group the equal -precision band method will be used to calculate a simultaneous 
confidence band for RFS, LRFS, RRFS, and DM FS over the interval from 1to 5years 
(Nair, 1984).  An overall between -group difference in RFS, LRFS, RRFS, DMFS, and OS 
will be evaluated with a log-rank test and corresponding proportional hazard model with 
or withou tstratification by the two randomization factors.  If warranted due to actual 
adjuvant therapy, these analyses will be repeated stratifying on actual rather than 
planned adjuvant therapy and/or adjuvant therapy containing selected types of 
immunotherapy. Multivariate proportional hazards models may be used to explore the 
prognostic and/or predictive value of baseline factors.

CONFIDENTIA LThe Clopper -Pearson method ( Clopper and Pearson , 1934 ) will be used to calculate 
exact CIs for binary endpoints (eg, overall tumor response , response in injected and 
uninjected lesions, R0 rate, pCR).  Wilson’s score method with continuity correction 
(Newcombe, 1998 ) will be used to calculate an approximate exact CI for between -group 
differences in binary rates. Multivariate logistic models may be used to explore the 
prognostic and/or predictive value of baseline factors.
10.5.4 Safety  Endpoints
Subject incidence rates of treatment -emergent adverse events (including all adverse 
events, grade ≥ 3 adverse events, fatal adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse 
events of interest and events requiring the discontinuation of study drug, local effects on 
the tumor [ie, pain, inflammation and ulceration]) will be summarized.  The Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be us ed to code adverse events to a 
system organ class (SOC) and a preferred term within the SOC. The CTCAE 
version 3.0 will be used to grade severity of adverse events.  In addition ,clinically 
significant laboratory changes and clinically significant changes in vital signs will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics. Summary statistics will also be provided for 
concomitant medications, adjuvant therapy, dose delay, study drug discontinuation, 
overall exposure, and changes in ECOG performance status.  Tabl es and/or narratives 
of deaths through 30 days after the latter of the last dose of talimogene laherparepvec or 
surgery will be provided.  The incidence of subjects with herpetic lesions found to be 
positive for talimogene laherparepvec DNA per qPCR in swa b samples collected from 
lesions suspected to be herpetic in origin and the rate of positive lesions (if any) will be 
calculated.    Potential or known unintended exposure to talimogene laherparepvec, 
related suspected signs or symptoms, and detection of t alimogene laherparepvec in a 
subject’s household member, caregiver, or healthcare provider will be reported.
When appropriate ,the safety data during the talimogene laherparepvec monotherapy 
period before surgical resection will be summarized separately fr om the safety data after 
surgical section, which will be summarized by treatment actually received.

In addition, all original source documents supporting entries in the CRFs must be 
maintained and be readily available.
Retention of study documents will be governed by the Clinical Trial Agreement.
12.3 Study  Monitoring and Data Collection
The Amgen representative (s)and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for 
contacting and visiting the investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, 
upon request, inspecting th e various records of the clinical study (eg, CRFs and other 
pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is respected.
The Amgen clinical monitor is responsible for verifying the CRFs at regular intervals 
throughout the study to verify adherence t o the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and 
consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical 
research.  The clinical monitor is to have access to subject medical records and other 
study -related records needed to verify the entries on the CRFs.
The investigator agrees to cooperate with the clinical monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in 
completing CRFs, are resolved.
In accordance with ICH GCP and the sp onsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected 
for audit by representatives from Amgen’s Global R&D Compliance and Audit function 
(or designees).  Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, protocol -required therapy
storage areas, laboratories) and revi ew of study -related records will occur to evaluate

CONFIDENTIA Lthe study conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory 
requirements.
Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:
All source documentation supporting entries int o the CRFs must be maintained and 
readily available.
Updates to CRFs will be automatically documented through the software’s “audit 
trail”.
To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review is performed on subject data received at Amgen.  During this 
review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent 
discrepancies.  In addition, the data arereviewed for adherence to the protocol and 
GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review 
process, and/or data queries are created in the EDC system database for site 
resolution and subsequently closed by the EDC system or by an Amgen reviewer.
The investigator signs only the Investigator Verification Form fo r this electronic data 
capture study.  This signature indicate sthat investigator inspected or reviewed the 
data on the CRF, and the data queries, and agrees with the content.
Amgen (or designee) will perform self -evident corrections to obvious data errors in the 
clinical trial database, as documented in the Study Specific Self Evident Corrections 
Plan.  Examples of obvious data errors that may be corrected by Amgen (or designee) 
include deletion of obvious duplicate data (eg, same results sent twice with t he same 
date with different visit -week 4 and early termination) and clarifying “other, specify” if 
data are provided (eg, race, physical examination).  Each investigative site will be 
provided a list of the types of corrections applied to study data at the initiation of the trial 
and at study closeout.
12.4 Investigator Responsibilities for Data Collection
The investigator is responsible for comply ingwith the requirements for all assessments 
and data collection (including subjects not receiving protocol- require d therapies) as 
stipulated in the protocol for each subject in the study.  For subjects who withdraw prior 
to completion of all protocol -required visits and are unabl e or unwilling to continue the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 and Table 3),the investigator can search publically 
available records [where permitted]) to ascertain survival status.   This ensures that the 
data set(s) produced as an outcome of the study i s/are as comprehensive as possible.
12.5 Language
CRFs must be completed in English.  TRADENAMES®(if used) for concomitant 
medications may be entered in the local language.  Consult the country -specific 
language requirements.

12.6 Publication Policy
To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, Amgen encourages the formation of 
a publication committee consisting of several investigators and appropriate Amgen staff,
the governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication Charter .  The 
committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other investigators and to 
collaborate with authors and Amgen staff as appropriate as defined in the Publication 
Charter .  Membership on the committee (both for investigators and Amgen staff) does 
not guarantee authorship .  The criteria described below are to be met for every 
publication.
Authorship of any publ ications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis 
of the Recommendations for Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly 
Work in Medical Journals (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors).
All publications (eg, man uscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to Amgen for review.  The Clinical Trial 
Agreement among the institution, investigator , and Amgen will detail the procedures for, 
and timing of, Amgen’s rev iew of publications.

CONFIDENTIA LAppendix D.  Modified World Health Orga nization (WHO) Response Criteria
A modified version of the W orld Health Organization ( WHO) response criteria 
(WHOhandbook for reporting results of cancer treatment, 1979 ) will be employed in this 
study. Because cutaneous melanoma lesions may be irregular ly shaped, W HO criteria 
using longest perpendicular diameters rather than Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors ( RECIST )using single dimension measurement are preferred for evaluating 
tumor response.
Method of Measurement of Melanoma Tumor Lesions
Clinical Examination Using Caliper : All measurements will be determined using a 
ruler or calipers and reported in metric notati on (mm) and will be recorded 
bi-dimensionally. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial and ≥10mm in at least 2 dimensions as assessed using calipers 
(eg,superficial cutaneous melanoma lesion ). (Note: When a lesion can be evaluated by 
both, clinical examination and imaging, radiographic imaging evaluations should be 
preferred since it is more objective).
CT scans (or MRI): Computed tomography (CT) scans by contrast -enhanced or spiral 
scan (or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan) will be performed to evaluate tumor 
response for nodal/soft tissue disease (including lymph nodes) .  Measurabi lity of lesions 
on CT scans is based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  W hen 
CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable 
lesion should be the greater of either at least 10 mm or twice the slic e thickness.  MRI is 
acceptable to assess disease extent if used throughout the study.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  A 
switch from contrast enhanced CT to noncontract CT or to MRI (or vice versa) should 
not preclude response assessment if, in the judgment of the site radiologist, there is no 
significant difference in the assessment by changing modalities.  This may occur if a 
subject has developed a medical contraindication to intravenous contrast for CT scans 
while on trial.  This change would require the preapproval of the sponsor ’smedical 
monitor.
Positron Emission Tomography  (PET)/CT Scans:   If a combined PET/CT scan is 
performed at the discretion of the investigator, the CT portion of that exam should not be 
substituted for the dedicated CT exams required by this protocol.  The PET portion of the 
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec
Protocol Number:  20110266
Date:  23 March 2018 Page 91of 100
CONFIDENTIA LCT may introduce additional data which may bias the investigator assessment of 
respon se if it is not routinely or serially performed.   However, if the investigator or the 
site radiologist can document that the CT performed as part of a PET/CT is of identical 
diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with intravenous and oral contrast) then th e 
CTportion of the PET/CT can be used for tumor measurements.
Ultrasound: Ultrasound may be used to assess superficial palpable lymph nodes and 
subcutaneous lesions where ultrasound provides a more accurate measure than clinical 
measurement, CT or MRI .  In addition, ultrasound can be useful to confirm the complete 
disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical examination.  However, 
if ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size it must not be used as a method 
of measurement. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, 
confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.
Measureable Disease 
Measurability is defined by the ability to measure a lesion bi -dimensionally with surface 
area determined by multiplying the longest diameter by the diameter perpendicular to the 
longest diameter as defined below.  An individual lesion measure is therefore provided 
by the product of a tumor’s longest diameter and the diameter perpendicular to that.
All measurements will be dete rmined using a ruler or calipers and reported in metric 
notation (mm) and will be recorded bi -dimensionally.
Definitions of Measurable and Nonmeasurable:
At baseline (the last assessment on or prior to the first dose of talimogene laherparepvec 
[Arm1] or prior to surgery [ Arm2]), tumor lesions will be categorized as follows: 
measurable or 
nonmeasurable but evaluable 
Measurable Lesions:
Measurable lesions are defined at baseline as lesions that can be accurately and serially 
measured in at least 2 dimen sions and for which the longest diameter in at least 
2dimensions is:
≥ 10 mm as measured by CT scan, MRI, or ultrasound for nodal/soft tissue disease 
(including lymph nodes)
≥10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam for superficial cutaneous or 
subcutaneous melanoma lesion as measured by caliper
multiple superficial mela noma lesions which in aggregate have a total diameter of 
≥10 mm

Protocol Number:  20110266
Date:  23 March 2018 Page 92of 100
CONFIDENTIA LNonmeasurable Lesions:
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm by 
CT/MRI/ultrasound for nodal/soft tissue disease [including lymph nodes] or < 10mm 
caliper measu rement by clinical exam for superficial cutaneous melanoma lesion) and 
other truly nonmeasurable lesions are considered nonmeasurable and characterized as 
nonindex lesions.  This will include any measurable lesions beyond the maximum 
number of 10 lesions t hat were not chosen as index lesions.
Lesions with Prior Local Treatment:
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiate area, or an area subject to other 
loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated pro gression in the lesion.
Coalescing or Splitting Lesions:
Coalescing lesions:  When two or more lesions merge and at least one is an index 
lesion, the largest index lesion prior to merging should be measured and reported during 
the tumor response assessment . All other merged lesions should be reported as 
0mm x 0 mm (for lesions previously reported as Index or New Measurable Lesions) or 
absent (for lesions previously reported as Non -Index or New Non -Measurable Lesions).
If two or more non -index lesions merge, the apparently larger lesion should be reported 
as present, and smaller lesion( -s) should be reported as absent. The indication that the 
lesion coalesced with the specified lesion( -s) should be provided for each merged lesion.
Splitting lesions:  When an index lesion splits into two or more lesions the largest 
measurable part of the split lesion will be measured for the current assessment with the 
indication that the lesion split from the specified lesion, and followed for future 
assessments. The rem aining lesions will be measured as new lesions with an indication 
that the lesion split from the specified lesion. In this case, appearance of a new lesion 
from a previous lesion that split will not be considered disease progression solely due to 
appearance of a new lesion (may be consider ed disease progression due to > 25% 
increase in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all index tumors 
since baseline, or the unequivocal appearance of a new tumor, other than the product of 
the split tumor, since the last response assessment time point).
When an non -index lesion splits into two or more lesions, the apparently larger lesion will 
be reported as a non-index lesion. All other smaller lesi ons will be reported as new 
non-index lesions with an indication that the lesion split from the specified lesion. In this 
case, appearance of a new lesion from a previous lesion that split will not be considered

disease progression due to > 25% increase in the sum of the products of the 
perpendicular diameters of all index tumors since baseline, or the unequivocal 
appearance of a new tumor, other than the product of the split tumor, since the last 
response assessment time point ).
Measureable Tumor A ssessment/Burden:
Baseline Documentation of “Index Lesions”:
All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to randomization and 
never more than 4 weeks (ie, 28 days) prior to randomization .
At baseline, up to 10 measurable cutaneous, nodal, or soft tissue lesions will be chosen 
to measure over the course of therapy.  The distribution of these index lesions should be 
representative of the subject’s overall disease status.  Index lesions should be selected 
on the basis of their size (lesions with longest bi -dimensionally perpendicular diameters) 
and suitability for accurate repeated measurements by imaging techniques (CT, MRI or 
ultrasound) and/or other method such as clinical exam.
The sum of t he products of the largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions will 
be calculated and reported.
If a subject has multiple small superficial cutaneous melanoma lesions at baseline ( each 
lesions is less than 10 mm in at least 2dimensions ) which in aggregate have a total 
diameter of ≥ 10 mm in at least 2dimensions , up to 10 largest lesions that were included 
in this measurement will be reported as ”Index Lesion s”, and the sum of the products of 
the two largest perpendicular diameters of these lesions will be calculated and reported 
for tumor response assessments.
Baseline Documentation of “ Nonindex Lesions”: 
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including any measurable lesions that were not 
chosen as index lesions will be identified as nonindex lesions .  
Nonindex lesion sshould 
be recorded and assessed qualitatively over the course of therapy.
Follo w-up “Index Lesions” :
At each subsequent tumor assessment, the sum of the products of the two largest 
perpendicular diameters of the index lesions are added together to provid e the total 
tumor burden.

Protocol Number:  20110266
Date:  23 March 2018 Page 94of 100
CONFIDENTIA LFollo w-up “Nonindex Lesions” :
Nonindex disease measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed 
as “present”, “absent”, or in rare cases “unequivocal progression”.
Follo w-up “New Lesion s”:
At tumor assessment, if new measurable lesions have appeared they should be added 
to sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of the index lesions to 
provide the total tumor burden. For non measurable new lesion they should be followed 
as nonindex lesion as“present”, “absent”, or in rare cases “unequivocal progression”.   If 
a new lesion(s) that appears in between scheduled tumor response assessments 
disappear(s) before the next scheduled assessment, there is no need to include this 
lesion for tumor response evaluation. 
Response Criteria
Evaluation of Objective Response:
The subject response will be assessed based on the response of the index lesions and 
nonindex lesion, and presence or absence of new lesions. Conf irmation of complete or 
partial response is not required. The overall response is derived from time point 
response assessments as described in Table 1 , Table 2, and Table 3 .

CONFIDENTIA LAppendix F.  Surgery Guidelines
The decision to perform surgery on subjects with stage IIIB, IIIC or IV M1a melanoma 
(dermal, subcutaneous or non -regional lymph node metastases) is a complex clinical 
decision making process that must be based on good clinical judgment thatmay include
consulting with other relevant medical specialities, and considering patient’s 
preferences . Eligible subjects for surgical resection must have metastatic disease that in 
the judgment of the investigator is deemed completely surgically resectable Eligible 
subjects may either present with a primary melanoma and evidence of concurrent 
dermal, subcutaneous or clinically palpable lymph node metastasis, or may have 
previously had a primary melanoma and subsequently develop recurrence. Subjects 
who present with metastasis from an unknown primary melanoma are also eligible to 
participate.   
1) Definition of IIIB or IIIC Metastasis: Eligible subjects with stage IIIB or IIIC 
melanoma have histopathologically confirmed melanoma metastasis in:
a) the dermis or subcutaneous tissue at, or close to the site of a primary 
cutaneous melanoma, an d/or
b) the lymphatic channels (satellite, in -transit, or intralymphatic metastasis) 
draining a primary cutaneous melanoma site, and/or
c) the regional lymph nodes draining a primary cutaneous melanoma site
2) Definition of IVM1a Metastasis: IVM1a means metastasis to distant skin, 
subcutaneous tissues, or lymph nodes. Subjects eligible for the protocol must 
have melanoma metastasis to a skin or soft tissue site beyond the potential 
lymph drainage basins of the primary site, or to lymph nodes beyond the 
potential l ymph drainage pathways regional to the primary site.
3) Surgical Margins : The goal of surgery is to completely resect all metastases with 
adequate margins to avoid local recurrence. The surgeon should always attempt 
to get negative margins and be well beyon d the palpable tumor. In subjects with 
dermal or subcutaneous metastasis, wide margin resection beyond 2 cm is 
usually not indicated, but the surgeons should always consider appropriate 
margins of resection to achieve both a clinically and microscopically negative 
resection. If the metastasis is in the subcutaneous tissue, the underlying fascia 
should be excised with the specimen. If the margins are found to be positive on 
pathological examination during the surgery, an additional resection, if feasible,
of skin and subcutaneous tissue should be performed. Debulking surgery in 
which the tumor is shelled out invariably leads to prompt recurrence and is of 
little benefit to the subject.
4) Handling of Surgical Specimen(s): It is recommended that surgeon will mark the 
lesion (s)(or the area if CR was achieved) with the suture that was injected with 
talimogene laherparepvec. Complete surgery report and surgical pathology 
report have to be recorded in CRF. For additional information on handling of 
surgical specimen srefer to Laboratory Manual.

CONFIDENTIA LGuidelines for Lymphadenectomy
1) Axillary Dissection: A complete axillary lymph node dissection should include all 
three levels of node -bearing axillary tissue. The borders of dissection include 
superior along the axillar y vein from the thoracic inlet (Halsted's ligament) to the 
latissimus dorsi tendon. The medial border is the intercostal and serratus 
anterior muscles on the chest wall. The lateral border is the edge of the 
latissimus dorsi muscle, and the inferior border is the fourth intercostal space. 
The dissection should extend to the subscapular muscle. All fat and lymphatic 
tissue should be resected from the axilla and the long thoracic and thoracodorsal 
neurovascular bundle should be preserved unless involved w ith tumor . The 
pectoral minor muscle may be transected or removed if necessary to assure 
complete dissection of Level III nodes. Drainage of the resection bed with a 
closed suction drain is recommended. The minimum number of nodes assessed 
from the axil lary region is 15.
2) Inguinal Dissection: Borders of dissection should be superior :  along the lower 
abdomen 5 cm above and parallel to the inguinal ligament, inferior to the apex of 
the femoral triangle, medially along the medial border of the adductor mag nus 
muscle, and laterally along the lateral border of the sartorius muscle. The fatty 
tissue and lymphatic tissue overlying the femoral vessels and nerve are removed 
up to the inguinal ligament. Removal of the node of Cloquet is recommended. 
Drainage of the resection bed with a closed suction drain is recommended. The 
minimum number of nodes assessed from the superficial inguinal region is 8. A 
deep groin dissection is required if inguinal nodes are (a) clinically positive 
(palpable) and there are 3 or more positive inguinal nodes, (b) positive matted 
nodes or (c ) the node of Cloquet is microscopically positive by either hematoxylin 
and eosin staining or immunohistochemistry. A deep groin dissection of the 
common and external iliac, hypogastric, and ob turator nodes should be 
performed by entering the retroperitoneal space either through a separate 
incision through the abdominal musculature above and parallel to the inguinal 
ligament, or by transecting the inguinal ligament. Drainage of the resection bed 
with a closed suction drain is recommended. The minimum number of nodes 
assessed from the deep groin region is 4.
3) Popliteal Region: The popliteal fossa lymph node dissection should contain the 
lymph nodes bordered laterally and superiorly by the biceps femoris muscle and 
medially and superiorly by the semimembranous and semitendinosus muscles.
The inferior margins are the lateral and medial heads of the gastrocnemius 
muscles. The roof of the fossa is bordered by the popliteal surface of the femur 
and popliteus muscle and the floor is bordered by the fascia lata, superficial 
fascia and skin. Usually ligation of the lesser saphenous vein is necessary for 
complete excision of the lymph nodes in this site. Drainage of the resection bed 
with a closed suct ion drain is recommended. The minimum number of nodes 
assessed from the popliteal region is 3.

CONFIDENTIA L4) Neck Dissection : Either a classic radical or modified neck dissection preserving 
the spinal accessory nerve and sternocleidomastoid muscle are acceptable. In 
subjects who present with a primary melanoma on the anterior scalp, face or ear 
and concurrent palpable biopsy proven neck lymph node metastasis, a 
lymphoscintigraphy is recommended to assess possible drainage to the 
superficial parotid gland. If there is evidence of drainage to parotid lymph nodes, 
a superficial parotidectomy is required to remove the parotid nodes along with 
the neck lymph nodes. The borders of the neck dissection are inferior to the 
clavicle, superior to the mandible, mastoid and tail of the parotid gland, posterior 
to the anterior border of the of the trapezius muscle, and anterior to the strap 
muscles. Contents of the digastric triangles should be resected and the spinal 
accessory nerve preserved as long as there are no metastases in the upper 
jugular nodes. Drainage of the resection bed with a closed suction drain is 
recommended. The minimum numbers of nodes assessed from the neck region 
are as follows: (a) anterior cervical, including suprahyoid, jugulardigastric is
15;(b) poste rior cervical, including supraclavicular is 15. Selected neck 
dissection could be considered in some circumstances, such as metastasis to 
submental nodes or very low cervical nodes from a medial shoulder primary 
melanoma.

Protocol Title:  A Phase 2, Multicenter, Randomized, Open-label Trial Assessing 
the Efficacy and Safety of Talimogene Laherparepvec Neoadjuvant Treatment Plus 
Surgery Versus Surgery Alone for Resectable, Stage IIIB to IVM1a Melanoma 
 
Amgen Protocol Number 20110266 
 
Amendment Date: 22 April  2016 
 
Rationale:  
The Superseding Amendment 2 was written to:  
• Correct the numbering of the exclusion criteria in Amendment 2 
• Update sponsor contact  
The key protocol changes are:  
• Secondary objective 
An objective of regional recurrence-free survival (RRFS)  was added to the following 
secondary objective “To estimate the effect of neoadjuvant talimogene laherparepvec 
plus surgery compared to surgery alone on local recurrence- free survival (LRFS) and 
distant metastases -free survival (DMFS) ” to better characterize patterns of recurrences 
of melanoma, which include not only local and distant, but also regional  recurrences.  
• Secondary endpoint 
Regional recurrence-free survival was added to the secondary endpoints in parallel to 
this addition to the secondary ob jective. 
• Distant metastases free survival  
The efficacy endpoint of DMFS was clarified by specifying what DMFS includes and excludes.  
• Adjuvant ipilimumab information 
Information on adjuvant ipilimumab use was added to the Introduction because 
ipilimumab was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) for the adjuvant treatment of patients with cutaneous melanoma with pathologic 
involvement of regional lymph nodes of more than 1 mm who have undergone complete 
resection, including total lymphadenectomy . 
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec 
Protocol Number:  20110266  
Date:  22 April  2016 Page 2 of 25 
CONFIDENTIAL    • Marketing information on talimogene laherparepvec 
Marketing information on talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic ) was added to the 
Introduction to update the background section because it was recently approved by 
regulatory authorities for specified indications in the US, Europe, and Australia. 
• Randomization stratification 
Stratification by adjuvant i nterferon use was replaced with adjuvant systemic therapy to 
include interferon al pha (INFα) and ipilimumab since ipilimumab has been FDA 
approved to reduce the risk of melanoma returning after surgery and other systemically 
active therapy may also be approved for this indication.  
• Number of sites 
The number of sites was changed from 40 to 50 to achieve the enrollment goal. • Safety follow -up 
The 30-day safety follow -up was modified to specify that subjects will be followed for 
local, regional, and distant disease recurrence and for melanoma and adverse events 
thought to be potentially related to talimogene laherparepvec to align with the schedule 
of assessment in the Registry Study 20120139.   The protocol was also changed to 
specify that subjects who participate in 20120139 must sign a new informed consent 
form. 
• Measurable disease inclusion criterion  
Inclusion criterion 106 was clarified to specify that the measurement of the lesion 
diameter “in at least 2 dimensions” is ≥ 10 mm to align with other talimogene 
laherparepvec studies .  Also, measurement using ultrasound for superficial lymph nodes 
and subcutaneous lesions was added. 
• Serum lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) level inclusion criterion 
Inclusion criterion 108 was changed as follows:  Serum LDH level ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of 
normal (ULN) for s tages IIIB and IIIC melanoma and ≤ 1.0 x ULN for Stage IVM1a 
melanoma within 28 days prior to randomization, since LDH is not a staging component 
for Stage III melanoma. • Serum alb umin inclusion criterion 
Inclusion criterion 109 was modified to include serum albumin ≥  2.5 g/dL to align with 
other talimogene laherparepvec studies .

Protocol Number:  20110266  
Date:  22 April  2016 Page 3 of 25 
CONFIDENTIAL    • Autoimmune disease exclusion criterion  
Exclusion criterion 204 was expanded to clarify symptomatic autoimmune disease to 
align with the same criterion in other talimogene laherparepvec  monotherapy studies.  
• Clinically significant immunosuppression 
The definition of clinically significant immunosuppression was updated in exclusion 
criterion 205 to align with other talimogene laherparepvec  monotherapy studies.  
• Tumor vaccine exclusion criterion 
Exclusion criterion 212 (prior therapy with tumor vaccine) was deleted to align with other  
talimogene laherparepvec  monotherapy studies.  
• Viral transmission during sexual contact e xclusion criterion 
The criterion (216) to exclude sexually active subjects and their partners unwilling to use 
male or female latex condoms to avoid potential viral transmission during sexual contact 
was added as a condition of marketing approval and to align with other talimogene 
laherparepvec  studies.  
• Talimogene laherparepvec vials 
Each vial contains a minimum of 1.0 m L talimogene laherparepvec  at either 106 PFU/mL 
or 108 PFU/mL concentrations.  The description of the two vial concentrations as green 
cap and blue cap, respectively, were deleted since they no longer apply.  
• Treatment procedures 
The following statement was added to stress the need to report adjuvant therapies, if 
planned, via Interactive Voice Response ( IVR):  If adjuvant therapy (systemic and/or 
radiation therapy; approved or investigational) is planned, this should be reported via IVR at randomization. 
• Reporting of potentially talimogene laherparepvec related adverse events 
during long-term follow -up 
Adverse events  deemed by the investigator to be potentially related to talimogene 
laherparepvec (Arm 1 only) and use of subsequent anticancer therapy for mel anoma will 
be collected during long- term follow -up to align this protocol with all other talimogene 
laherparepvec studies.  
• Activated PTT  
Activated thromboplastin time was added as an alternative to PTT in screening 
laboratory tests because it may be an alternative test of choice for testing coagulation.

Date:  22 April  2016 Page 4 of 25 
CONFIDENTIAL    • Physical examination and ECOG performance status 
Required physical examination and ECOG performance status was added at weeks 4 
and 8 to report any change in a patient’s performance status.  
• Oral and genital swab bing after surgery 
Oral and genital swabbing for  real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and 50% 
Tissue Culture Infective Dose (TCID50) assay  testing was removed from the safety 
follow -up visit because identical information is currently being collected in 
Study  20120324.  
• Safety Follow -up p rocedures 
Surgical safety evaluation and recording of subsequent anticancer therapy for melanoma 
were added to safety follow -up procedures to align the schedule of assessment in the 
Registry Study 20120139. 
• Pregnancy and lactation reporting 
Reference to Amgen’s global Pregnancy and Lactation Surveillance Program s was 
deleted and replaced by Amgen Global Patient Safety to al ign with current company 
practice.  
• Statistical considerations 
RRFS analysis was added to meet the addition of RRFS to the secondary objectives. 
The protocol was modified to clarify that a DRT will review the first interim analysis and 
the talimogene laherparepvec product team will review the second interim analysis , 
since the second analysis  will be performed after all subjects in Arm 1 have been 
enrolled.  The DRT and talimogene laherparepvec product team  will also review some 
efficacy endpoints (eg, R0 resection rate, pCR rate, response to neoadjuvant treatment). 
Ad hoc analyses, executed by the talimogene laherparepvec product team, for safety or 
some efficacy endpoints may be conducted before the planned primary or final analyses  
if interim data are required for submission to regulatory authorities.  
• Sample size 
In the statement regarding s ubjects who are not confirmed to be disease- free 
post-surgery or who withdraw prior to surgery, failure was changed from at 
randomization to “a day after randomization” for RFS.  With this change, the number of 
subjects at risk at the earliest possible time (randomization +1 day) would not change

CONFIDENTIAL    due to non-melanoma subjects, and would reduce the impact on the Cox model, 
Kaplan-Meier, and log-rank test results.  
• Trial integrity document  
The mention of using a Trial Integrity Document was deleted to comply with current 
standard operating procedures .  
• Index lesions 
Language was added to Appendix D (d ocumentation of i ndex lesions) to clarify the 
recording of aggregate lesions and to  align with other talimogene laherparepvec  
monotherapy studies.  
• Definition of p rogressive disease for measurable disease  
The definition of progressive disease (PD) was changed to clarify that PD includes the unequivocal appearance of a new measurable lesion since the last response assessment time point, to align with other talimogene laherparepvec studies.  
• Appendix F 
Appendix F was modified to state that the decision to perform surgery may include 
consulting with other relevant medical spec ialties  and consider ation of a patient’s 
preferences , to provide guidance on the decision making proces s of resection of 
melanoma.
 
• Administrative 
Minor text clarifications, additions, and corrections as well as  typographical and 
formatting changes were made throughout the protocol.  The key sponsor contact 
information was updated to align with current personnel and the talimogene 
laherparepvec  Investigator Brochure reference was updated to the current version.  New 
references were added as needed for newly added text.

respectively (Flaherty et al, 2012).  
  
Add: Recently, ipilimumab, a a cytot oxic lymphocyte associated 
antigen 4 (CTLA -4 inhibitor ), was approved by the United States 
Food and Drug Administration for the adjuvant treatment of 
patients with cutaneous melanoma with pathologic involvement 
of regional lymph nodes of more than 1 mm who  have undergone 
complete resection, including total lymphadenectomy ( Yervoy™, 
2015).  This approval was based on results of a randomized 
double-blind phase 3 trial conducted in 951 patients with 
completely resected stage IIIA (> 1 mm nodal involvement), IIIB , 
and IIIC melanoma (EORTC 18071).  Patients with in-transit 
metastases were excluded.  Ipilimumab improved recurrence-free 
survival (primary endpoint) in this trial from 17.1 months to 26.1 months (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.64 –0.90; p=0.0013).  Results of OS 
and distant metastasis-free survival (secondary endpoints) are pending.  Fifty -two percent of patients randomized to the 
ipilimumab arm discontinued treatment because of toxicity, 5 patients (1%) died because of ipilimumab-related toxicities.  
Forty -six perc ent of patients in the ipilimumab arm experienced 
grade 3 adverse events (37% immune-related), and 8% grade 4 
(6% immune -related)  (Eggermont et al, 2015 ).

not been shown to improve overall survival or have an effect on 
visceral metastases) (Imlygic™ Prescribing Information, 2015), in 
Europe for the treatment of adults with unresectable melanoma that is regionally  or distantly metastatic ( stage IIIB, IIIC, and 
IVM1a) with no bone, brain, lung or other visceral disease 
(Imlygic™ Summary of Product Chara cteristics, 2015), and in 
Australia as monotherapy  for the treatment of melanoma in 
patients with unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal 
lesions after initial surgery (Imlygic™ Prescribing Information,

Section:  7.2.4  Long -term Follow -up 
  
Add: All randomized subjects will be contacted by telephone, or clinic visit, 
to assess survival status , collect adverse events deemed by the 
investigator to be potentially related to t alimogene laherparepvec 
(Arm 1 only),  and, if applicable, commencement of any subsequent 
anticancer melanoma therapy.  
  
Add: Radiographic tumor imaging, clinical tumor assessments, and tumor 
response assessments, will be performed as documented in 
Section 7.2.2 every 3 months ( ±30 days) for 3 years following the 
safety follow -up visit and then every 6 months ( ±30 days) until distant 
disease recurrence, death, subject withdraws full consent, or  up to 
5 years after the last subject is randomized, whichever is first.  Local 
and regional recurrences will be reported until appearance of distant recurrence, or end of study, whichever is first.  Local 
recurrence is defined as histologically or cytologically confirmed 
reappearance of melanoma in the area of up to 2 cm from the scar from the surgical excision or  at the edge of the skin graft if that 
was used for closure.  Regional recurrence (excludes local recurrence) is defined as histologically, cytologically, or 
radiographically confirmed reappearance of melanoma in the 
regional lymph node basin.  New in -transit melanoma metastases

Distant metastases exclude local and regional recurrence and will 
include distant cutaneous/subcutaneous metastases, distant nodal metastases, or visceral, central nervous system, brain, or  
bone metastases.  
  
Add: After the long -term follow -up period of this study has ended, subjects 
randomized to Arm 1 who received at least a single dose of 
talimogene laherparepvec and who end the study  for any reason 
other than death or withdrawal of full consent will be followed for 
survival under an ongoing separate registry protocol  (Study 20120139) 
that is in place for the long-term follow -up of all subjects treated with 
talimogene laherparepvec in clinical trials.  
  
Add: The registry protocol will also monitor for late and long -term adverse 
events thought to be potentially related to talimogene laherparepvec and use of subsequent anticancer therapy for melanoma.   
Subjects who after the long-term follow -up period of this study  
(20110266) will elect to participate in the registry study must sign 
new informed consent form before any registry protocol- specific 
activities.

CONFIDENTIAL    Amendment 2 
Protocol Title:  A Phase 2, Multicenter, Randomized, Open- label Trial Assessing 
the Efficacy and Safety of Talimogene Laherparepvec Neoadjuvant Treatment Plus 
Surgery Versus Surgery Alone for Resectable, Stage IIIB to IVM1a Melanoma  
 
Amgen Prot ocol Number 20110266  
 
Amendment Date:  31 March 2016 
 
Rationale:  
The key protocol changes are :  
• Secondary objective  
An objective of r egional recurrence -free survival (RRFS)  was added to the following 
secondary objective “ To estimate the effect of neoadjuvant talimogene laherparepvec 
plus surgery compared to surgery alone on local recurrence- free survival (LRFS) and 
distant metastases -free survival (DMFS) ” to better characterize patterns of recurrences 
of melanoma , which include not only local and distant, but also regional  recurrences.   
• Secondary endpoint  
Regional recurrence -free survival was added to the secondary endpoints in  parallel to 
this addition to the secondary ob jective.  
• Distant metastases free survival  
The efficacy endpoint of DMFS was clarified by specifying what DMFS includes and 
excludes.  
• Adjuvant ipilimumab  information 
Information on adjuvant ipilimumab use was added to the Introduction because 
ipilimumab was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) for the adjuvant treatment of patients with cutaneous melanoma with pathologic 
involvement of regional lymph nodes of more than 1 mm who have undergone complete 
resection, including total lymphadenectomy . 
• Marketing information on talimogene laherparepvec  
Marketing information on talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic™) was added to the 
Introduction to update the background section because it was recently approved by 
regulatory authorities for specified indications in the US, Europe, and Australia.  
Product:  Talimogene Laherparepvec  
Protocol Number:  20110266  
Date:  31 March 2016  Page 2 of 25 
CONFIDENTIAL    • Randomization stratificat ion 
Stratification by adjuvant i nterferon use was replaced with adjuvant systemic therapy to 
include interferon alpha ( INFα ) and ipilimumab since ipilimumab has been FDA 
approved to reduce the risk of melanoma returning after surgery and other systemically 
active therapy may also be approved for this indication.  
• Number of sites  
The number of sites was changed from 40 to 50  to achieve the enrollment goal. 
• Safety follow -up 
The 30- day safety follow- up was modified to specify that subjects will be followed for 
local, regional, and distant  disease recurrence and for melanoma and adverse events 
thought to be potentially related t o talimogene laherparepvec to align with the schedule 
of assessment in the Registry Study 20120139.   The protocol was also changed to 
specify that subjects who participate in 20120139 must sign a new informed consent 
form. 
• Measurable disease inclusion crit erion  
Inclusion criterion 106 was clarified to specify that the measurement of the lesion  
diameter “in at least 2 dimensions” is ≥ 10 mm to align with other talimogene 
laherparepvec studies .  Also, measurement using ultrasound for superficial lymph nodes 
and subcutaneous lesions was added.  
• Serum lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) level inclusion criterion  
Inclusion criterion 108 was changed as follows:  Serum LDH level ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of 
normal (ULN) for s tages IIIB and IIIC melanoma and ≤ 1.0 x ULN for Stage IVM1a 
melanoma within 28 days prior to randomization, since LDH is not a staging component 
for Stage III melanoma. 
• Serum al bumin inclusion criterion  
Inclusion criterion 109 was modified to include serum albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL  to align with 
other talimogene laherparepvec studies . 
• Autoimmune disease exclusion criterion  
Exclusion criterion 204 was expanded to clarify symptomatic autoimmune disease to 
align with the same criterion in other talimogene laherparepvec  monotherapy studies.  
• Clinically significant immunosuppression  
The definition of clinically significant immunosuppression was updated in exclusion 
criterion 205 to align with other talimogene laherparepvec  monotherapy studies.

CONFIDENTIAL    • Tumor vaccine exclusion criterion  
Exclusion criterion 212 (prior therapy with t umor vaccine) was deleted to align with other  
talimogene laherparepvec  monotherapy studies.  
• Viral transmission during sexual contact exclusion criterion  
The criterion (216) to exclude sexually active subjects and their partners unwilling to use 
male or fem ale latex condoms to avoid potential viral transmission during sexual contact 
was added as a condition of marketing approval and to align with other talimogene 
laherparepvec  studies.  
• Talimogene laherparepvec vials 
Each vial contains a minimum of 1.0 mL tal imogene laherparepvec  at either 1 06 PFU/mL 
or 108 PFU/mL concentrations.  The description of the two vial concentrations as green 
cap and blue cap, respectively, were deleted since they no longer apply.  
• Treatment procedures  
The following statement was added to stress the need to report adjuvant therapies, if planned, via Interactive Voice Response (IVR ):  If adjuvant therapy (systemic and/or 
radiation therapy; approved or investigational) is planned, this should be reported via IVR at randomization.  
• Report ing of potentially talimogene laherparepvec related adverse events 
during long- term follow -up 
Adverse events  deemed by the investigator to be potentially related to t alimogene 
laherparepvec (Arm 1 only) and use of subsequent anticancer therapy for melanoma will 
be collected during long -term follow -up to align this protocol with all other talimogene  
laherparepvec studies. 
• Activated PTT  
Activated thromboplastin time was added as an alternative to PTT in screening 
laboratory tests because it may be an alternative test of choice for testing coagulation.  
• Physical examination and ECOG performance status  
Required physical examination and ECOG performance status was added  at weeks 4 
and 8 to report any change in a patient’s performance status. 
• Oral and genital swabbing  after surgery  
Oral and genital swabbing for real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR) and 50% 
Tissue Culture Infective Dose (TCID50) assay  testing was removed from the safety

CONFIDENTIAL    follow -up visit because identical information is currently being collected in 
Study  20120324.  
• Safety Follow -up procedures 
Surgical safety evaluation and recording of subsequent anticancer therapy for melanoma 
were added to safety follow -up procedures to align the schedule of assessment in the 
Registry Study 20120139.  
• Pregnancy and lactation reporting  
Reference to Amgen’s global Pregnancy and Lactation Surveillance Program s was 
deleted and replaced by Amgen Global Patient Safety to al ign with current company 
practice.  
• Statistical considerations 
RRFS analysis was added to meet the addition of RRFS to the secondary objectives.  
The protocol was modified to clarify that a DRT will review the first interim analysis and 
the talimogene laherparepvec product team will review the second interim analysis , 
since the second  analysis  will be performed after all subjects in Arm 1 have been 
enrolled.  The DRT and talimogene laherparepvec product team  will also review some 
efficacy endpoints (eg, R0 resection rate, pCR rate, response to neoadjuvant treatment).  
Ad hoc analyses, executed by the talim ogene laherparepvec product team,  for safety or 
some efficacy endpoints may be conducted before the planned primary or final analyses  
if interim data are  required for submission to regulatory authorities.  
• Sample size  
In the statement regarding s ubjects who are not confirmed to be disease- free 
post-surgery or who withdraw prior to surgery, failure was changed from at 
randomization to “ a day after randomization” for RFS.   With this change, the number of 
subjects at risk at the earliest possible time (randomization +1 day) would not change due to non- melanoma subjects, and would reduce the impact on the Cox model, 
Kaplan- Meier, and log- rank test results.  
• Trial integrity document  
The mention of using a Trial Integrity Document was deleted to comply with current 
standard operating procedures .

CONFIDENTIAL    • Index lesions  
Language was added to Appendix D  (documentation of i ndex lesions) to clarify the 
recording of aggregate lesions and to  align with other talimogene laherparepvec  
monotherapy studies.  
• Definition of progressive disease for measurable disease  
The definition of progressive disease (PD) was changed to clarify that PD includes the 
unequivocal appearance of a new measurable lesion since the last response 
assessment time point, to align with other talimogene laherparepvec studies.  
• Appendix F 
Appendix F was modified to state that the decision to perform surgery may include 
consulting with other relevant medical spec ialties  and consider ation  of a patient’s 
preferences , to provide guidance on the decision making process of resection of 
melanoma.  
• Administrative  
Minor text clarifications, additions, and corrections as well as  typographical and 
formatting changes were made throughout the protocol.   The key sponsor contact 
information was updated to align with current personnel and the talimogene 
laherparepvec  Investigator Brochure reference was updated to the current version.  New 
references were added as needed for newly added text.

Add: Recently, ipilimumab, a a cytot oxic lymphocyte associated 
antigen 4 ( CTLA -4 inhibitor ), was approved by the United States 
Food and Drug Administration for the adjuvant treatment of patients with cutaneous melanoma with pathologic involvement 
of regional lymph nodes of more than 1 mm who  have undergone 
complete resection, including total lymphadenectomy ( Yervoy™, 
2015).   This approval was based on results of a randomized 
double- blind phase 3 trial conducted in 951 patients with 
completely resected stage IIIA (>  1 mm nodal involvement), II IB, 
and IIIC melanoma (EORTC 18071).   Patients with in- transit 
metastases were excluded.   Ipilimumab improved recurrence- free 
survival (primary endpoint) in this trial from 17.1 months to 26.1 
months (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.64–0.90; p=0.0013).   Results of OS and 
distant metastasis -free survival (secondary endpoints) are 
pending.   Fifty-two percent  of patients randomized to the 
ipilimumab arm discontinued treatment because of toxicity, 5 
patients (1%) died because of ipilimumab- related toxicities.   
Forty -six percent  of patients in the ipilimumab arm experienced 
grade 3 adverse events (37% immune- related), and 8% grade 4 
(6% immune -related)  (Eggermont et al, 2015 ).

CONFIDENTIAL    Add: Coalescing or Splitting Lesions:  
Coalescing lesions:  When two or more lesions merge and at 
least one is an index lesion, the largest index lesion prior to 
merging should be measured and reported during the tumor 
response assessment.  All other merged lesions should be 
reported as 0 mm x 0 mm (for lesions previously reported as Index or New Measurable Lesions) or absent (for lesions 
previously reported as Non- Index or New Non -Measurable 
Lesions).  If two or more non- index lesions merge, the apparently 
larger lesion should be reported as present, and smaller lesion( -s) 
should be reported as absent.  The indication that the lesion 
coalesced with the specified lesion( -s) should be provided for 
each merged lesion.  
Splitting lesions:  When an index lesion splits into two or more 
lesions the largest measurable part of the split lesion will be measured for the current assessment with the indication that the 
lesion split from the specified lesion, and followed for future 
assessments.  The remaining lesions will be measured as new lesions with an indication that the lesion split from the specified 
lesion.  In this case, appearance of a new lesion from a previous 
lesion that split will not
 be considered disease progression solely 
due to appearance of a new lesion (may be considered disease progression due to > 25% increase in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all index tumors since baseline, or 
the unequivocal appearance of a new tumor, other than the product of the split tumor, since the last response assessment 
time point).  
When an non- index lesion splits into two or more lesions, the 
apparently larger lesion will be reported as a non- index lesion.  
All other smaller lesions will be reported as new non -index 
lesions with an indication that the lesion split from the specified lesion.  In this case, appearance of a new lesion from a previous 
lesion that sp lit will not
 be considered disease progression solely 
due to appearance of a new lesion (may be considered disease 
progression due to > 25% increase in the sum of the products of

Study Title: A Phase II Multi-Center Study ofBGB324 in Combination with Pembrolizumab 
in Patients with Previously Treated Advanced Adenocarcinoma of the Lung 
Investigational Products: 
• BGB324 (now called by the INN name bemcentinib throughout the protocol): a
potent selective small molecule inhibitor of Axl, a surface membrane protein
kinase receptor
• Pembrolizumab: a humanized monoclonal antibody against the programmed death
receptor- I (PD- 1)
Phase of Development: Phase II 
Number of Sites: Up to approximately 20 sites. Additional sites may be added as required to 
meet the enrolment needs of the clinical trial. 
Number of Patients: 
Up to 48 evaluable patients will be enrolled in cohort A, 29 evaluable patients in cohort B and 
29 evaluable patients in coho1t C. Approximately 133 patients will be screened in order to 
identify up to 106 patients who meet all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria and who are 
evaluable for response. This assumes a 25% screen failure rate, given the need for patients to 
provide a fresh tissue biopsy sample.

This is an open-label, multi-center, single aim, phase II sh1dy to assess the anti-himor activity 
and safety of bemcentinib when given in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with 
previously treated, advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung. 
The sh1dy will enroll three cohorts of patients with previously treated, advanced 
adenocarcinoma of the lung: Cohort A will consist of patients who received a maximum of one 
prior line of platintim-containing chemotherapy and no prior immunotherapy of any kind. 
Cohort B will consist of patients who received a maximtim ofone prior line of an anti-PD-(L)l 
therapy (monotherapy). Cohort C will consist of patients who received a maximum of one prior 
line of therapy with an anti--PD-(L)l therapy in combination with a platinum-containing 
chemotherapy. 
Pembroliztimab has not previously been combined with bemcentinib in patients (in any 
indication) and therefore, in coho1t A, a safety nm-in will include a total of 12 patients. The 
internal Data Review Committee (DRC) will conduct a review of the safety data from the first 
6 patients who have had the potential to be followed for at least 6 weeks (minimtim 2 cycles), 
and then again after a further 6 patients (12 patients in total) have had the potential to be 
followed for at least 6 weeks. The DRC will consider the emerging safety profile, together with 
the number of patients requiring a bemcentinib dose reduction and the number of patients 
requiring either bemcentinib or pembroliztimab or both to be permanently discontinued. The 
DRC will consider whether a revised bemcentinib dose (dose level -1) is appropriate for new 
patients entering the shldy. 
Cohort A will utilize a 2-stage, single-aim, Simon's 2-stage design1 with a single interim 
(Stage 1) analysis and a final (Stage 2) analysis. The interim (Stage 1) analysis will be 
conducted for DRC when 22 patients are evaluable (EE) for Objective Response Rate (ORR). 
If 3 or fewer responses are observed in up to 22 patients, the cohort will be te1minated in favor 
of the null hypothesis for futility, and no ftuther paiticipants will be recruited. When at least 4 
patients have an observed response at the interim analysis, up to a ftuther 26 patients may be 
evaluated (Evaluable for Efficacy (EE)), for a total of 48 evaluable (EE) patients (see Section 
8.1), taking the overall risk-benefit of the combination into consideration. 
Recmitment for coho1t A will be halted after 22 evaluable patients have been entered and 
whilst the Stage 1 interim analysis is conducted for DRC review. Recmitment will 
recommence if the decision is made to continue to the maximum of 48 (EE) evaluable patients. 
An additional cohort B will assess the anti-tumor activity and safety of bemcentinib when 
given in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the 
lung with a maximum of one prior line of an anti-PD-(L) 1 therapy (monotherapy).

Cohort B  will utilize a single -arm, Simon’s 2- stage design with an interim ( Stage 1 ; null 
hypothesis for futility) and an interim ( Stage 2 ; once all patients have been treated and/or 
followed up for at least 12 months) analysis. The interim (Stage 1) analysis will be conducted

Bemcentinib will be administered orally once daily. On the first 3 days of administration, the 
bemcentinib dose will be a 'loading' dose of 400 mg on Days 1, 2 and 3. From Day 4 onwards, 
patients will receive a daily dose of 200 mg daily. If the DRC recommend dose level -1 for 
new pat� fter or during the safety nm� dose ofbemcentinib will reduce to a loading 
dose of- on Days 1, 2 and 3 and to- from Day 4 onwards. 
A fixed dose of 200 mg pembrolizumab will be given by intravenous (IV) infusion over 
30 minutes every 3 weeks in all patients. The 3-weekly dosing pembrolizumab dosing schedule 
will be used to define 3-week treatment cycles throughout the treatment period of the study. 
The bemcentinib and pembrolizumab dose levels selected for this study are summarized in 
Table 2.

Dosing of both dmgs will commence on Day 1. On days when both bemcentinib and 
pembrolizumab are given, pembrolizumab will be given first and patients will be observed for 
1 hour for infusion or other adverse events (AEs). Bemcentinib may then be administered. 
Bemcentinib and pembrolizumab will be given until disease progression (note that in the 
absence of clinical deterioration, treatment can continue and disease progression should be 
confumed after 4 weeks) or until an tmacceptable toxicity has occuned which necessitates 
treatment withdrawal (Section 6.6), or until 106 weeks (35 cycles), equivalent to 24 
calendar months. If it is decided at the Stage 1 interim analysis of any cohort that the 
cohort is to be closed for recruitment, then pa1ticipants who have stable disease, even in the 
absence of pa1tial response (PR) or complete response ( CR), will continue to be treated. 
NB: Paiticipants who are still on study treatment after 35 cycles and continue to show benefit 
from the sh1dy treatment will be offered access to bemcentinib (e.g., under expanded excess 
program or roll over sh1dy) outside the shldy, after discussion with the sponsor, prior to study 
closure. 
Patients who discontinue bemcentinib treatment (for reasons other than disease progression) 
may be able to continue with pembrolizumab (monotherapy) until 106 weeks (that is, 
35 completed cycles ofpembrolizumab, equivalent to 24 calendar months). 
Patients who discontinue pembrolizumab (for reasons other than disease progression) may be 
able to continue with bemcentinib (monotherapy) upon approval by the Sponsor until study 
closure.

If a tumor assessment scan is suggestive of progressive disease, but the patient has an absenceof clinical de terioration, a confirmatory scan after  4 weeks (this may be an unscheduled scan)
will be made in order to rule out a pseudo or false progression caused by an inflammatory 
immune response. In the absence of clinical deterioration, treatment with both bemcentinib 
and pembrolizumab can continue unt il disease progression is confirmed. 
As per RECIST 1.12, objective response should be confirmed by a repeat scan performed at 
least 4 w eeks later . 
For the safety run-in, a  DRC, consisting of Principal Investigators, the Sponsors ’ medical 
monitors (BerGenB io and Merck), and invited experts as required, will review all patient safety 
data after 6 patients have been enrolled and followed up for 6 weeks  (2 cycles), and then aga in 
after a further 6 patients (total 12 patients) have had the potential to be followed for 6 weeks . 
At each of these safety reviews, the DRC will consider the rate of bemcentinib dose reductions 
and the rate of permanent discontinuation from bemcentinib a nd/or pembrolizumab. The DRC 
will consider if a revised dose (dose level -1) for b emcentinib i s appropriate. 
Additionally, a review of emerging safety dat a from the whole bemcentinib program will be 
made 6- monthly. 
The Sponsor  may request ad -hoc DRC meetings at any time during the study to assess the  
safety data and review the need for dose modifications. For more details on the dose 
modification rules for bemcentinib and pembrolizumab, please refer to Section 6.6.1 and 
Section 6.6.2. 
Study P rocedures an d Assess m
ents 
Please refer to Schedule of Study Assessments - Table 4 , Table 5 , and Table 6  for full details 
of all study assessments. For patients who have stopped bemcentinib, but continue with 
monotherapy pembrolizumab, there will be an adjusted list of s tudy assessments.  
The study will consist of a Screening period, Treatment period (made up of consecutive, 
3-week cycles), a Post Treatment Visit, and Follow -up Assessments.  Patients must provide
informed consent prior to commencing the study screening pro cedures. All patients are
required to have a fresh (newly acquired) tumor biopsy taken at Screening and are required to
provide sufficient tumor specimens to enable both Axl kinase and PD -L1 expression to be
measured.
Tumor specimen s are therefore to be  submitted in  sufficient quantity to allow for PD -L1 
immunohistochemistry ( IHC) and Axl IHC analysis (see the Pathology Manual). Samples with 
limited tumor content (<100 viable tumor cells) , cytology, cell block, decalcified or formalin 
fixed but previously f rozen , frozen sample, plastic embedded, bone, bone marrow, clot  and 
fine needle aspirates are inadequate for defining tumor PD -L1 and Axl status. 
Axl expression can only be obtained from a fresh (newly acquired) tumor tissue sample . PD-L1 
expression can be  determined from either a fresh (newly acquired) or archival sample.  In all 
cases, the tumor tissue must not have been previously irradiated. 
Different testing laboratories will be used for Axl kinase and PD- L1 expression.

The fresh (newly acquired) tumor tissue sample will be either newly obtained core needle 
biopsy (minimum gauge 18) or a newly obtained excisional biopsy.  
The following tumor tissue alternat ives are available (all options require fresh tumor tissue 
sample ); however,  if there  is insufficient fresh tumor tissue available, the 3rd option below 
allows the submission of archival tissue in addition to the fresh tissue sample:  
•Where only a core needle biopsy is used, a minimum of 4 core ( with 1 -cm tumor in
each co
re) biops y samples are required.  These should be placed in formalin and
processed into 2 single paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks (2 cores in one block and
2 cores in the other block) within  24-48 hours.
•Alternatively, where only a  newly obtained excisional biopsy sample is used, this
biopsy should be processed into 2 paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks within 24-48hours.
•Alternatively , 2 core  (with 1 -cm
  tumor in each core)  needle (fresh tumor ) biopsies or a
single newly obtained excisional biopsy sample can be submitted (processed into one
FFPE block) , together with either an archival (FFPE) tumor tissue block or  a minimum
of 10 unstained slides each 5 µm  cut from the archival tumor sample block.
If archival  tumor tissue  blocks are to be sent, it is suggested that a minimum of 10 unstained 
slides each 5  µm cut from the archival tumor sample  block must be sent (rather than  sending 
the whole archival block) and clearly labelled  as having come from an archival block. 
The first dose of study drug must be administered within 4 weeks of commencing the Screening 
assessments.  A tumor assessment  scan by computed tomography (CT)  (preferred method), or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis is required during the 
Screening period. X -ray and bone scans can be used where appropriate (for example, for 
symptomatic sites that are negative on a bone scan) for disease status are required during the 
Screening period. 
Recording of AEs and concomitant medications, plus laboratory screens including ECGs will be performed at each study visit. During Cycle 1, patients will have study visits on Days 1, 2, 
3 and 4, then on Days 8 and 15.  From Cycle 2 Day 1, study vi sits will be reduced to every 
3 weeks.  
ECG assessments will be performed in triplicate pre -dose and at 6 hours a
 fter the bemcentinib  
dose on D ay 1, Cycle 1  and then repeated pre -bemcentinib  dose on Days 2, 3 and 4 ( Cycle 1)  
and then at every visit thereafter . 
Furthe r tumor assessment  scans  w ill be performed in all patients every 9 weeks for the first 46 
weeks and then 12 weekly thereafter until progression (which may be confirmed) . On each 
occasion, tumor assessments will include scans  of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Additional 
anatomy should be imaged based on signs and symptoms of individual patients. Disease 
response will be evaluated at these time points according to RECIST 1.12. If either or both of 
the study treatments are stopped for any reason other than confirmed progression, tumor assessment  scans  will continue ever y 12 weeks until confirmed progression.

Blood sampling for peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC) and relevant Axl signaling and 
inhibition biomarker analysis will be performed at Screening, Cycle 1 Day 4 and 8 and every 
study visit thereafter until Cycle 9 Day 1. 
Blood sampling for bemcentinib  pharmacokinet ic analysis will be performed on blood samples 
taken pre-dose on: 
•Cycle 1, Days 1 and 3 as follows: pre-dose and at 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours post dose;
•Cycle 1, pre-dose on Days 2, 4, 8 and 15;
•Cycles 2 and 3, pre-dose (study days 22 and 43 respectively).
Blood sampli

samples taken
 pre-dose on Cycle 1, Days 1 to 4, 8 and 15 and then pre-dose at Cycles 2 and 3 
(study days 22 and 43 r espectively).  These samples will be frozen and stored centrally for 
future reference and analysis.  
Patients with tumor amenable to r epeat sampling may have additional fresh biopsies taken on 
up to 2 occasions post -dose at time points agreed between the Inv estigator and the Sponsor.  
Where possible, efforts will be made to obtain follow up biopsy material where a patient has 
responded to treatment or has progressed on treatment. 
Further details on sample collection and handling for all PK and biomarker assess ments are 
des
cribed in the Lab oratory  Manual.  
Patients who discontinue bemcentinib  treatment  (for reasons other than disease progression) 
may be able to continue with (monotherapy) pembrolizumab until 106 weeks (that is, 35 
completed cycles of pembrolizuma b). These patients will no longer be required to have the 
following assessments from 6 weeks after the discontinuation of bemcentinib  (unless clinically 
indicated):  
•ECG ;
•Echocardiogram (or Multi Gated Acquisition Scan ( MUGA));
•Opti
onal tumor biopsy (for example at subsequent progression);
•Biomarker sampling .
The Post Treatment Visit will occur 30 days after the patient has discontinued both treatments on study. Pati 
ents who withdraw from either or both study treatment s prior to disease 
progression will continue to have tumor assessment  scans on study every 12 weeks until 
disease progression is documented (and confirmed, if necessary). The date of disease 
progression will be captured.  
Patients will continue to have their survival status checked every 12 weeks until either the 
patient dies
 or the study ends. Telephone contact is acceptable.

Statistical Methods and Sample Size  
Evaluable for safety (E S): An evaluable patient  will have received at least one combination 
dose. 
Evaluable for efficacy  (EE) : An evaluable for s afety (ES) patient who has at least one 
on -treatment scan  as per protocol schedule. 
Cohort A  will follow a k -stage s ingle arm design with k =2, being a  Simon’s 2- stage design1. 
In this design with k =2, there are two analyses: an interim (Stage 1 ) analysis for DRC review 
and a final (Stage 2; once all patients have been treated and/or followed up for at least 24 
months) analysis.  At the interim analysis , the response rate is evaluated in a fixed number ( m) 
of patients using a predefined decision rule to determine if the study should stop for futility (in 
the situation where the null is confirmed) . If the null hypothesis is not confirmed, a further 
fixed number of patients ( l) are assessed for response and a final analysis is performed on all 
(m+l) patients. In both interim and final analyses, the response rate will be presented together 
with the associated exact  90% confidence interval (CI).  
The rationale for a null hypothesis of p 0=0.15 is based on previously published analysis from 
495 patients with NSCLC  (Keynote 001), who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab, 
where an ORR of 19.4% (95% CI 16.0-23.2) was observed for pembrolizumab monotherapy.  
The median duration of response was 12.5 months. Of these 495 patients, 394 patients were 
previously treated and likely to be a similar patient population to that being considered for this 
study. An ORR of 18.0% (95% CI 14.4 to 22.2) was observed in these previously t reated  
patients.  
The ORR of pembrolizumab in combination with bemcentinib  is expected to be at least as high 
as this in an unselected patient population, and considerably higher in patients with positive 
(≥1%) PD -L1 expression. 
With p 0=0.15 and p 1=0.30, the interim (Stage 1) analysis  will be  conducted with m =22 
evaluable for efficacy patients (EE). If 3 or fewer responses are observed in up to 22 patients, 
the cohort will be terminated in favor of the null for futility . Otherwise, up to a further 26 
patients may be evaluated, for a maximum total of 48 evaluable patients.  If a total of 12 or 
more responses are seen in up to 48 evaluable patients (25%), then the null will have been 
rejected in favor of the alternative; otherwise, the nu ll will not have  been rejected.  
Up to 48 evaluable patients may therefore be enrolled to cohort A . It is expected that 
approximately 64 patients will be screened in order to identify 48 evaluable patients who meet 
all the inclusion and exclusion criteria and who are evaluable for response in cohort A. 
Cohort B  will follow a k -stage single arm design with k =2, being a Simon’s 2- stage design as 
above.  
The rationale for a null hypothesis of p 0=0.05 is based on historic response rates to standard 
second and later line si ngle agent chemotherapy such as docetaxel. In a phase III trial enrolling 
patients who had previously failed platinum -containing chemotherapy, 373 patients received 
either 100 mg/m2 or 75 mg/m2 docetaxel. An ORR of 10.8 and 6.7%, respectively, was 
observed in these patients3.

The ORR of pembrolizumab in combination with bemcentinib is expected to be at least as high 
as this in patients who progressed on first - or second line immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.  
With p 0=0.05 and p 1=0.20, the interim (Stag e 1) analysis  will be conducted with m =13 
evaluable for efficacy patients (EE) . If 1 confirmed response is observed after the 13th patient 
has been followed-up for 24 weeks , a subgroup of the DRC will meet to confirm continuation 
to Stage 2. If 0 responses are observed in up to 13 patients, the cohort will be terminated in 
favor of the null for futility. Otherwise, up to a further 16 patients may be evaluated (in Stage 
2), for a maximum total of 29 (EE) evaluable patients. Once 16 (EE) evaluable patients have 
been enrolled in Stage 2, an interim analysis (Stage 2; once all patients  have been treated and/or 
followed up for at least 12 months ) and a final analysis ( at the time  of study complet ion – see 
Section 8.6 for details) will be performed.
 If a total of 4 or more responses (either at Stage 2 
interim analysis or at final analysis) are seen in up to 29 evaluable patients
 (13.8%), then the 
null w ill ha ve been r ejected
 in favor of the alternative; otherwise , the null will not ha ve been 
rejected.  
Up to 29 evaluable patients may therefore be enrolled to cohort B. It is expected that 
approximately 36 patients will be screened in order  to identify 29 patients who meet all the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria and who are evaluable for response in cohort B. 
Demographic and clinical characteristics at entry will be summarized  using appropriate 
descriptive statistics.  PD-L1 and Axl expression will be summarized  for the ES . 
Cohort C  will be similar to coho rt B in terms of size and design. It will follow a k -stage single

100 mg/m2 or 75 mg/m2 docetaxel. An ORR of 10.8 and 6.7%, respectively, was observed in

Informed Consent must be obtained using the current version of the PIS/I CF prior to commencing Screening. Re-consenting of patients is permitted on approval by the Sponsor 
• From C2 onwards a tolerance window of +/-3 days is permitted . Other tolerance windows for specific study assessments are described in the footnotes below. 
• On dosing days, assessments should be performed prior to dosing unless specified otherwise. 
• (X) denotes an optional sample or a sample which is not taken at every cycle;� denotes a study visit with multiple samples. Please refer to Footnotes . 
Additional assessments may be carried out at any point in the study where clinically indicated . 
Footnotes: 
A 
pregnancy test is required within 3 days prior to CID!. A negative pregnancy test may be confirmed by urine or blood test. Where a urine test is positive or equivocal, a 
blood test must be performed to confirm the result. Patients requiring confirmation of post-menopausal status will have FSH levels assessed at Screening. Where applicable , 
and in accordance with local regulations , a pregnancy test should be conducted at each cycle (or monthly). 
2 Vital signs will include temperature, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate. On pembrolizumab dosing days, vital signs will be taken 
both pre-<lose and at the end of infusion. 
3 Physical examination includes height at Screening and weight at Screening and the start of each cycle. After Screening, further assessments may be symptom-directed. 
4 Coagulation parameters may be assessed from the Hematology sample. 
5 Thyroid function testing may be assessed from the Clinical 
chemistry sample. 
6 For each ECG assessment, triplicate 12-lead ECGs must be taken less than 5 minutes apart, with the patient having rested for at least JO minutes in the supine position prior 
to assessment. Time points are relative to bemcentinib dosing: Cl DI pre-<lose and 6 hours post dose; D2 pre-<lose; D3 pre-<lose; D4 pre-dose. Samples should be 
contemporaneously with bemcentinib PK blood sampling time-points . All other time-points are pre-dose unless clinically indicated. If a patient has bemcentinib interrupted 
for 14 days for QTc prolongation or 12 weeks for immune-related toxicities, an ECG will be conducted twice weekly for the following 2 weeks once a patient restarts daily 
dosing. If a patient permanently discontinues bemcentinib (but continues pembrolizumab ), the last ECG will be performed at the next pembrolizumab administration. 
7 Tumor assessment scans will be performed at Screening , then every 9 weeks for the first 46 weeks, and then every 12 weeks thereafter (+/-7 days). A tumor response or 
disease 
progression should be confirmed no less than 28 days after the initial finding. If treatment administration is misaligned with weeks (e.g., because of treatment delay), 
the tumor assessment scans schedule should be maintained by week number. The schedule of disease assessments is every 12 weeks once a patient has stopped (one or both 
study treatments) or completed their treatment in the absence of progression. These may continue into Follow Up. 
8 Fresh tumor tissue taken within 3 months of first dose (provided the patient has not received any further chemotherapy or immunotherapy, or other anti-cancer therapy in the 
intervening period and that sufficient tumor tissue is available) from all patients at Screening is mandatory, and optional at up to 2 time points during participation in the 
clinical trial ('on-study' biopsy). Where possible, these optional samples should be taken at the point of tumor response or progression. Suitable archival biopsy material may 
also be obtained at Screening . Please refer to protocol Section 5. 3 .13, the Laboratory or Pathology Manual 
for full details on biopsy sample collection , time-points, processing, 
storage and shipment. Jfa patient discontinues bemcentinib (but continues pembrolizumab) , there is no requirement for the optional 'on study' biopsy. 
9 Blood samples will be collected at Screening (or DI pre-<lose), D4, D8, then at every study visit up to and including C9 DI to prepare PBMC and serum samples for relevant 
Axt signaling and inhibition biomarker assessment. Please refer to the Laboratory Manual for full details on biomarker sample collection, time-points, processing, storage 
and shipment. 
10 Pembrolizumab dose of200 mg will be administered every 3 weeks (timing window +/-3 days). Each dose will be infused over 30 minutes (timing window -5/+ 10 minutes) 
11 Bemcentinib will be taken orally once daily. On visits when pembrolizumab and bemcentinib are given on the same day, pembrolizumab must be given first and the patient 
observed for I h prior to administration ofbemcentinib. 
12 a) The maximum PK sampling time points for the measurement ofbemcentinib in blood will be: CJ DI pre-dose, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours; D2 pre-dose; D3 pre-dose, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours; 
D4 pre-<lose; and then pre-<lose at CID8, CID15, C2Dl and then C3Dl. Samples should be taken contemporaneously with the ECG assessments on CJ Dl-4. All sample 
times are approximate, but every effort must be made to take PK samples at specified times.

b) The maximum PK sampling time points for the measurement of pembrolizumab in blood will be: Cl DI pre-dose; D2; D3; D4; and then at CID8, CIDJ5, C2DI 
pre-pembro dose and then C3DI pre-pembro dose. All sample times are approximate but every effort must be made to take PK samples at specified times 
c) All sample times are approximate and every effort must be made to take PK samples at specified times. Actual sampling times must be recorded in order to assess result 
relative to bemcentinib or pembrolizumab dose. Please refer to the local Laboratory Manual for full details on PK sample collection, time-points, processing, storage 
and shipment. 
13 DI of next cycle would be "D22" of the previous cycle. 
14 A Post Treatment Visit is to 
be conducted up to 30 days (+/-3 days) from last dose of study drug. AEs and concomitant medications must be assessed to 30 days. Some
AEs must be assessed for longer (see Section 7.4.3 and Section 7.5). Other assessments may be carried out between 7-30 days from last dose . Tumor assessment scans and 
disease assessment is only required when part of next scheduled disease assessment is (where patient has not yet progressed) or to confirm response or progression. 
15 Tumor assessment scans and disease assessment will continue every 12 weeks from last dose of study drug where patient has not yet progressed or to confirm response 
or progression. An assessment of disease status, survival status and details of any anti-cancer therapies received after last dose of study drug will also be collected. 
Survival status can be collected by telephone. 
16 Echocardiogram (or MUGA) will be conducted every 6 months whilst a patient receives bemcentinib. If a patient discontinues bemcentinib (but continues pembrolizumab ), 
a final echocardiogram (or MUGA) will be conducted only if one is scheduled in the following 6 weeks. 
17 Demography- race, ethnicity, gender, age (birth month and year). 
18 Hematology and Clinical Chemistry to be assessed at a suitable time prior to administration of study treatment(s). 
19 Participants who are still on study treatment after 35 cycles and have not experienced radiological progression may continue to receive bemcentinib under the BGBC008 
protocol upon approval by the Sponsor , if the investigator believes that continuation of study treatment is in the best interest of the patient 
20 Treatment visits after every 3 weeks (or 21 days)

1 INTRODUCTION 
This is an open- label, Phase II, S imon 2- stage design1 study of the anti -tumor activity and safety 
of bemcentinib , an Axl kinase inhibitor, when given in combination with pembrolizumab, the 
humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) which targets the programmed death receptor -1 (PD -1) 
protein in patients with previously treated, advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung  (cohort A).  
Cohort B will assess the anti- tumor activity and sa fety of bemcentinib when given in combination 
with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung who have been 
previously treated with any anti -PD-(L)1 therapy.  Twenty -nine evaluable patients will be enrolled. 
Cohort C will assess the anti- tumor activity and sa fety of bemcentinib when given in combination 
with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung who have been previously treated with any anti -PD-(L)1 ther apy in combination with a platinum -containing 
chemotherapy. 29 evaluable patients will be enrolled.  
1.1 Non-S mall C ell L ung C ancer 
L
ung cancer has been the most common cancer worldwide for several decades. It is estimated that 
there were 1.8 mill
ion new cases  of lung cancer in 2012 (13.0% of total incidence). Lung cancer 
is also the leading cause of cancer death worldwide (19.4%), with only 15% of patients alive 5 years after diagnosis
5. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85 to 90% of lung 
cancer s6. 
Surgery is the preferred treatment approach for NSCLC patients with early -stage disease, al though 
over 60 to 65% of patients present with Stage IIIb/IV disease, which is unsuitable for resection. Chemotherapy with a platinum -based doublet is standard of care for patients with advanced 
NSCLC. Patients with Stage IV disease typically die from their disease, with overall median survival of 8 to 10 months and only 33% of these patients are still alive 1 year from diagnosi s
7. 
Docetaxel and pemetrexed are used as second -line chemotherapy offering an improvement in 
median and 1- year survivals compared with best supportive care. Specific targeted therapies have 
been developed for the treatment of advanced NSCLC including the vascular endothelial growt h 
factor inhibitor bevacizumab and the EGFR inhibitors erlotinib, gefitinib and cetuximab. The 
immunotherapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab, that target the programmed cell death receptor PD-1, represent an alternative therapy in patients following progress ion after first line 
chemotherapy . In patients with NSCLC, there is a progressive decline in response to repeated lines 
of therapy, primarily due to development of biologic resistance within the underlying tumor and a 
progressive decline in patient perform ance status (PS) resulting from treatment- related and 
disease- related morbidities (National Comprehensive Cancer Network Treatment Guidelines 
Version  4, 2014). 
1.2 Rationale for Study BGBC008 
Bemcentinib  is a pote
nt selective  small molecule inhibitor of Axl, a  surface membrane protein 
kinase receptor that is over -expressed in many metastatic solid tumors and has been identified as 
a marker of a poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC. 
Axl is a member of the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that 
regulate multipl
e cellular processes.  These include cell survival, proliferation, and migration. Mer

and Axl share the natural ligand Gas6, which binds Axl with 3- 10 fold greater intensity than Mer8. 
The role of these RTKs in normal physiology appears related to clearance of apoptotic cells, 
cytokine secretion, platelet aggregation, erythropoiesis, and natural killer cell differentiation and maturation
9,10,11,12. The oncogenic potential of Axl has been attributed to autocrine and paracrine 
functions. In addition to signaling through canonical PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways, Axl may 
also mediate tumor -stromal cell interactions, resulting in modification of the inflammatory  
response and angiogenesis13,14. Recently, Axl has also been implicated in epithelial- to-
mesenchymal transition (EMT), which promotes metastasis and giving cells the ability to migrate through extracellular matrix and intravasate into blood vessels
15. 
In NSCLC, Axl expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes, lymph node involvement, and higher disease stage
16. Axl and Gas6 ligand have been detected at high levels in more  than 
50% of NSCLC cell lines17. Further suggesting a major role in NSCLC biology, Axl is also among 
the most highly phosphorylated ( i.e., activated) receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) in NSCLC cell 
lines and tumors18,19.  
It has been reported that Axl mediates resistance to immunotherapy and chemotherapy in a variety of cancer types, including NSCLC
20, breast cancer21 and esophage al adenocarcinoma22. EMT is a 
common mechanism of resistance to chemotherapy, including resistance to docetaxel. Axl 
activation causes EMT23, while inhibition of Axl can reverse mesenchymal phenotype, thereby 
restoring drug sensitivity. 
Pembrolizumab [Keytruda (US)], a humanized monoclonal antibody against the programmed 
death receptor -1 (PD -1) protein, has been developed by Me
rck & Co for the treatment of patients 
with cancer.  Pembrolizumab is approved for treatment of patients with melanoma in several 
countries; in the US and EU it is approved for the treatment of patients with advanced (unresectable 
or metastatic) melanoma in adults.  Pembrolizumab has also been approved for treatment of 
patients with NSCLC in several countries; in the US it is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumor s express PD -L1 using a tumor proportion score (TPS) of 
50% or greater, and as determined by an FDA -approved test and who have disease progression on 
or after platinum -containing chemotherapy. Patients with NSCLC driven by EGFR mutations or 
ALK genomic rearrangements should also have disease progression on FDA -approved therapy for 
these molecular targets prior to receiving pembrolizumab. 
As described above, EMT is the process consisting of multiple biochemical changes by which 
polarized  epithelial cells gain a mesenchymal c 
ell phenotyp e, leading to increased migration and 
invasive prope rties.  In cancer, EMT is a hall mark of invading cells and consequently cancer / 
metastases.  It is increasingly understood that cancers are recognized  by the immune system and, 
under some circumstances, the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors24. However, 
if elimination is incomplete, the tumor may evolve mechanisms to avoid or attenuate the immune 
system.  In the tumor microenvironment, PD -L1 expressed on tumor cells binds with PD -1 on 
activat ed T-cells reaching the tumor. This delivers an inhibitory signal to those T -cells, preventing 
them from killing the tumor  cells, and thus, protecting the tumor from immune elimination25.  
A strong association between EMT status and an inflammatory tumor m icro-environment with 
elevation of multiple ta
rgetable immune checkpoint molecules, including PD -L1, PD1, PD -L2, 
BTLA, CTLA -4 etc.  has been shown26. Multiple agents, including pembrolizumab, that target

these checkpoint molecules, are in development for a range of cancers that are considered to have 
highly immunogenic microenvironments. More recently, the increasing role of immtme checkpoint 
blockade has led to rapidly growing interest in resistance mechanisms to these agents and, perhaps 
expectedly given Axl's role in immune evasion, emerging data show that increased Axl expression 
is a component of an anti-PD-I resistance program in non-responders27.
Bemcentinib has been shown to potentiate the effect of PD-1 /PD-Ll inhibition and to enhance 
tumor leukocyt e infiltration in a lung cancer syngeneic model in C57B l/6 mice (Section 1.3 and 
the bemcentinib Investigator's Brochure [IB]). There is, therefore, a strong scientific rationale for 
combination of bemcentinib with pembrolizumab in advanced NSCLC cancer. The proposed 
population will have advanced disease and therefore, the combination of bemcentinib with 
pembrolizumab is expected to increase the response rate and prolong the duration of response.

Bemcentinib inhibits the growth and smvival of hunor cell lines derived from a range of solid and 
leukemic tumors. 
In the syngeneic Lewis Ltmg (LL/2) ltmg carcinoma model, bemcentinib significantly potentiated 
the effect of anti-mP D-l+anti-mPD-Ll antibody treatment and reduced hunor growth and 
enhanced smvival compared to anti-mPD-l+anti-mPD-Ll treatment alone. Anti-mPD-l+anti­
mPD-Ll treatment induced EMT in the syngeneic LL/2 model. This induction of AxlAXL, 
vimentin, N-cadherin and PD-Ll was prevented by treatment with bemcentinib. Bemcentinib

1.3.2 Non-clinical toxicology ofBemcentinib PD-L1 
To suppo1t clinical studies with bemcentinib a series of animal toxicology and safety studies, 
including 28-day repeat dosing sh1dies in rodents and monkeys and a single dose telemetered 
cardiovascular (CV) safety sh1dy in monkeys, have been conducted. Comparisons of the data 
reported in the rodent and monkey studies indicate that primates are more sensitive to bemcentinib 
on a per body weight basis.

1.4.1 Safety Summary and Reference Safety Information 
The reference safety info1mation is based on a cut-off date of 30 July 2019 (consistent with 1B 
v.13.0) for ongoing clinical studies BGBC003, BGBC004, BGBC007, and BGBC008. For
investigator-led studies BGBIL005 and BGBIL006 only exposure and SAE data are included up
to the cut-off date of 30 July 2019. Please refer to the latest edition of the 1B for the most up-to­
date safety info1mation during the conduct of this clinical study.
1.5 Rationale for Bemcentinib Dose and Schedule Selection 
To date, the bemcentinib clinical program has utilized two different fo1mulations. Formulation 1, 
consisting ofbemcentinib API, was used in the healthy volunteer study (Study BGBC00l) and the 
first study of bemcentinib in patients (Study BGBC003 in patients with AML). From Study 
BGBC004 onwards, a blended fo1mulation including standard excipients, known as Fo1mulation 
2 has been used. 
Daily dosing with - bemcentinib has been perfo1med in patients with NSCLC and 
relapsed/refracto1y AML. Serial specimens of myeloid blasts have been collected from patients 
with AML. Paired biopsies have not been taken from patients with NSCLC. In myeloid blasts 
samples collected from patients who have completed 21-days of therapy exhibit reduced levels of 
phospho-Axl, phospho-Akt and phospho-ERK. All of these changes are consistent with inhibition 
of intracellular signaling pathways which are driven by signaling through Axl. Fmther evidence 
of Axl modulation in patients treated at this dose level is evident in the accompanying increase in 
soluble Axl which is closely related to the average concentration achieved. Increased levels of 
soluble Axl occurs downstream of increased sheddase activity following inhibition of intracellular 
MAPK signaling. These observations suggest that a daily dose of - bemcentinib has 
significant impact on inllibiting Axl signaling in patients. 
In Study BGBC00l, 32 subjects received doses ofbemcentinib in the range under 
fasted conditions, of which seven also received the same dose ofbemcentinib under fed conditions. 
The tmax and the apparent te1minal elimination t½ were generally comparable between fed and 
fasted conditions; tmax ranged fro� and t½ ranged from (except in 
one subject where t½ was reliably estimated as-). There was an increase in systeinic 
exposure to bemcentinib in three subjects, no appreciable change in three subjects and an apparent 
reduction in systeinic exposure in one subject when bemcentinib was given with food compared 
to under fasted conditions. 
Overall, Cmax and AUCo-48h under fed conditions were greater, respectively 
compared to fasted conditions; however, the 95% CI of the ratio (fed/fasted) included 100%, 
indicating that the apparent effect of food was not statistically significant. The elimination of

bemcentinib  was slow with a t ½ of longer than 24 hours. A consequence of this prolonged t ½ is the 
delay in the time taken to achieve steady state, which is estimated to be appro ximately two weeks 
following the initiation of BGB324 administration. Such a delay would not be therapeutically 
acceptable in patients with advanced cancers.  
The proposed starting dose and dosing schedule for clinical studies of bemcentinib in patients was  
ther
efore based on a one- compartment model, incorporated a lag time and no weighting to 
available clinical pharmacokinetic ( PK) data.  According to this model it was anticipated that the 
application of a loading dose (on Days 1, 2 and 3)  would enable a rapid achievement of therapeutic 
levels of bemcentinib , and subsequent maintenance daily dosing would maintain optimum 
exposures whilst preventing wide changes in systemic concentration during therapy. The simulated 
mean plasma concentration -time profile of b emcentinib following a loading dose of  on 
Day 1  and D ay 2 and  daily thereafter as a maintenance dose is presented in  Figure 3.

Systemic exposure from Fo1mulation 1 in Study BGBC003 is markedly lower than that from 
Fo1mulation 2 in Sh1dy BGBC004. Fmthermore, systemic exposure from Formulation 1 is lower 
than that from F 01mulation 2 in Sh1dy BGBC003. Between-patient variability in systemic exposure 
to bemcentinib appeared to be lower after administration of Fo1mulation 2 (in shldy BGBC004) 
compared to Fo1mulation 1. The lower variability may be associated with enhanced solubility of 
bemcentinib in Fo1mulation 2, a fo1mulated product with solubilisers and particle size 
considerations. This will enable a product with a dissolution profile suitable for oral administration 
intended for immediate release in the stomach in the fasted state. The difference in systemic 
exposure between the two formulations could also have occtmed as a result of administering 
bemcentinib in the fed or fasted state. For 
Study BGBC008 the sta1ting dose will be 400 mg loading 
dose on Days 1, 2 and 3, followed by a daily maintenance dose of 200 mg. Bemcentinib will be 
administered on an empty stomach, at approximately the same time each day; antacids are not used 
for at least 2 hours after intake ofbemcentinib (see IB for details). 
1.6 Pembrolizumab Background and Clinical Trials 
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
with high specificity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor, thus inhibiting its 
interaction with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-Ll) and programmed cell death ligand 2 
(PD-L2). Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor 
blocking activity for PD-1. Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in 
clinical development as an intravenous (IV) immunotherapy for advanced malignancies. 
Keytmda TM (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of 
indications. For more details on specific indications refer to the Investigator's brochure (IB). 
1.6.1 Rationale for pembrolizumab dose selection 
The planned dose ofpembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W). Based on the 
totality of data generated in the Keytmda development program, 200 mg Q3W is the appropriate 
dose of pembrolizumab for adults across all indications. As outlined below, this dose is justified 
by:

•Clinical data from 8 randomized studies in melanoma and NSCLC indications
demonstrating flat dose - and exposure -efficacy relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to
10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W), representing an approximate 5 to 7.5-fold exposure range
(refer to the IB) ,
•Population PK analysis showing that both fixed dosing and weight -based dosing pr ovides
similar control of PK variability with considerable overlap in the distributions of exposures,supporting suitability of 200 mg Q3W,
•Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in benefit -risk including 
 overall survival
at 200 mg Q3W across multiple indications, and
•Pharmacology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferredfrom PK data
) and tumor (inferred f rom physiologically based  PK [PBPK] analysis) at 200
mg Q3W.
Among the 8 randomized dose -comparison studi es, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled with 
melanoma and non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), covering different disease settings (treatment 
naïve, previously treated, PD -L1 enriched, and all -comers) and different treatment settings 
(monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy). Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B2, KN001 Cohort D, KN002, KN010, and KN021), a nd 
3 studies compared 10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B3, KN001 Cohort F2 and KN006). All of these studies demonstrated flat dose - and exposure -response relationships 
across the doses studied representing an approximate 5- to 7.5- fold difference in exposure. The 
2 mg/kg (or 200 mg fixed- dose) Q3W provided similar responses to the highest doses studied. 
Subsequently, flat dose -exposure- response relationships were also observed in other tumor types 
including head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, confirming 200 mg Q3W as the appropriate dose independent of the tumor type. These findings are consistent with the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab , which acts by interaction with 
immune cells, and not via direct binding to cancer cells.  
Additionally, pharmacology data clearly show target saturation at 200 mg Q3W. First, PK data in KN001 evaluati
ng target -mediated drug disposition (TMDD) conclusively demonstrated 
saturation of PD -1 in systemic circulatio n at doses much lower than 200 mg Q3W. Second, a PBPK 
analysis was conducted to predict tumor PD -1 saturation over a wide range of tumor penetration 
and PD -1 expression. This evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab  at 200 mg Q3W achieves 
full PD -1 saturati on in both blood and tumor. 
Finally, population PK analysis of p embrolizumab , w hich characterized the influence of body 
weight and other participant covariates on exposure, has shown that the fixed- dosing provides 
similar control of PK variability as weigh t-based  dosing, with considerable overlap in the 
distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. Supported by these PK characteristics and  given that fixed- dose has advantages of reduced dosing complexity 
and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed- dose was selected for evaluation 
across all pembrolizumab protocols.

Patients may withdraw their consent to further treatment on study or withdraw their consent to any 
further parti
cipation in any further assessments at any time without stating a reason and without 
prejudice to further treatment.  
Patients who have withdrawn their consent  to receive furt her treatment , but not withdrawn their 
consent to further participation in the study are expected to continue in  follow- up to enable 
assessment of the duration of their response, stable disease or ti me to progression, and their 
survival status.  
Patients who discontinue bemcentinib  treatment (for reasons other than disease progression) may 
be able to continue with (monotherapy) pembrolizumab until 106 weeks (that is, 35 completed cycles of pembrolizumab, equivalent to 24 calendar months).  
Patients who discontinue pembrolizumab (for reasons other than disease progression) may be able 
to continue with b
emcentinib  (monotherapy) upon approval by the Sponsor until Study Closure . 
A Post Treatment Visit should be performed 30 +/ -3 days after the  last dose of study treatment 
(bemcentinib  and/ or pembrolizumab), to enable follow up safety assessments and further tumor 
assessment where required.   
The Investigator may discontinue either or both the study treatment s at any time.  Exam ple reasons 
for discontinuing a study treatment are:  
•Patient withdrawal of consent to further treatment and/or further participation in the study.
•Disease progression (although, treatment can continue if progression is suspected in the
absence of clinical deterioration – progression is to be confirmed no less than 4 weeks after
the initial observation).
•The patient experiences a toxicity, considered related to bemcentinib, including those
necessitating a bemcentinib dose delay of 12 weeks (Section 6.6.1), where the
re-introduction of bemcentinib (including a dose reduction of bemcentinib), is not
considered suitable.
•The patient experiences a toxicity, considered to be related to treatment with
pembrolizumab which necessitates pembrolizumab treatment withdrawal (Section 6.6.2 ).
•Other toxicities or events, unrelated to bemcentinib or pembrolizumab, that would, in the
Investigator’s opinion, prevent the patient from continuing on st udy treatment(s).
•Treatment non-co mpliance. (All documentation concerning the patient must be as
complete as possible). Withdrawals due to non-attendance of study visits must be
followed-up by the Investigator to obtain the reason for where possible. For further
information on treatment non-co mpliance, please see also Section 3.5 ).
•Pregnancy.
A patient is defined as ‘lost to follow -up’ only if every effort has been made to contact the patient 
and determine the patient’s willingness to continue with all or some of the study assessments 
(irrespective of whether the patient is st ill receiving study treatment).

Patients who are unwilling to continue to receive further treatment should be encourage d to 
continue to be follow -up to enable assessment of the duration of their respons e, stable disease or 
time to progression, and their survival status.  
The Sponsor reserves the right to request the withdrawal of study treatment from a patient due to 
protocol violation or other significant reason. 
3.4 Permitted Cessation of Pembrolizum ab Treatment on S tudy  
Note that Investigators may wish to stop pembrolizumab treatment per local treatment practice for 
patients who
 have attained a confirmed complete response (CR) that have been treated for at least 
24 months with pembrolizumab and had at leas t 2 treatments with pembrolizumab beyond the date 
when the initial CR was declared.  Patients will remain on study and continue to receive 
bemcentinib  treatment and continue disease assessments.  
Once pembrolizumab treatment has been stopped for this reason, it cannot be restarted on study. 
3.5 Definition of Evaluable Patient, Acceptable Compliance, and Replacement of 
Patients  
Evalu
able for safety (ES):  An evaluable pat ient will have received at least one combination dose . 
Evaluable for efficacy (EE): An evaluable for safety patient  who has at least one on-treatment 
scan per protocol schedule. 
Patients will be replaced if they are considered to be non -evaluable fo r efficacy . 
Patients who have failed screening (usually because they have failed one or more of the inclusion or exclusion cri
teria) will not receive study treatment and are not considered evaluable. 
Treatment non -compliance f or this study will be defined as follows: 
•For bemcentinib: missing more than 7 doses in any 21-day period (other than a dose delay
for toxicity management (Section 6.6.1)
•For pembrolizumab: Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical
events or logistical reasons not related to study therapy (for example, elective surgery,
unrelated medical events, patient vacation etc). Patients should be placed back on study
therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled interruption. The reason for the interruption should
be documented in the patient’s study notes.
3.6 Procedures for Patient Cessation of Study Treatment 
When a patient stops or discontinues one or both of their study treatments , the reason f or cessation 
will be recorded in the patient file and the Case Rep ort Form (CRF).  Patients must complete a post 
treatment visit and continue with their scans and assessments of disease (if the patient has not already progressed) and/or survival status. 
3.7 Study or Site Termination 
If the Sponsor or
 their representatives, Investigator, or Competent Authority officials discover 
conditions during the
 study that indicate that the study or site involvement should be terminated,

this action may be taken after appropriate consultation with the Sponsor and the Investigator.  
Conditions that may warrant termination of the study or involvement of a study site include, but 
are not limited to: 
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to patients enrolled inthe study.
• The de
cision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue  testing, evaluation,
or development of the study drug.
• Failure of the Investigator(s) to comply with pertinent clinical trial regulations.
• Submissi
on of knowingly false information from the research facility to the Sponsor,
study monitor, or
 Competent Authority.
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.
Study termi
nation and follow -up will be p erformed in accordance with applicable local 
regulations.

4 STUDY DESIG N 
This is an open- label, multi- center, single arm, phase II study to assess the anti -tumor activity and 
safety of bemcentinib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with previously treated 
advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung. 
The study will enroll t hree cohorts of patients with previously treated, advanced adenocarcinoma 
of the lung: Cohort A  will consist of patients who received a maximum of one  prior line of 
platinum- containing chemotherapy and no prior immunotherapy of any kind. Cohort B  will consist 
of patients with a maximum of one prior line of an anti-PD-(L)1 therapy (monotherapy) . Cohort 
C will consist of patients who received a maximum of one prior line of therapy with an anti -PD-
(L)1 t herapy i n combination with a platinum-containing chemotherapy.
Cohort A  will utilize a 2- stage , single- arm design, Simon’s 2- stage design1 with a single interim 
(Stage 1)  analysis and a final (Stage 2) analysis. The interim (Stage 1)  analysis will be conducted 
for the Data Review Committee (DRC) when 22 patients are evaluable (EE)  for Objective 
Response Rate ( ORR ). If 3 or fewer responses are observed in up to 22 (EE) patients, the cohort 
will be terminated in favor of the null hypothesis for futility, and no further participants will be 
recruited. When at least 4 patients have an observed response at the interim analysis, up to a further 
26 patients may be evaluated (EE), for a total of 48 evaluable (EE) patients (see Section 8.1), 
taking the overall risk benefit of the combination into account. 
Cohort B will utilize a single -arm, Simon’s 2-stage design with 2 interim  analyses  and a final 
analysis. The interim analysis f or Stage 1 w ill be conducted for DRC review when 13 pa tients are 
evaluable (EE) for ORR. If 0 responses are observed in up to 13 ( EE) patients, the cohort will be 
terminated in favor of the null hypothesis for fut ility, a nd no further participants will be recruited. 
When at least 1 patient has an observed response at the interim (Stage 1) analysis, up to a further 
16 patients may be evaluated, for a total of 29 (EE) patients (see Section 8.1), taking the overall 
risk-benefit of the combination into consideration. The interim analysis for Stage 2 will be 
conducted once all patients have been treated and/or followed up for at least 12 months. The 
final analysis for cohort B will occur at the time of study completion – see Section 8.6 for details. 
Cohort B will assess the anti-tumor activity and safety of bemcentinib when given in 
combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung with 
a maximum of one prior line of a n anti-P D-(L)1 t herapy (monotherapy).  
Cohort C will utilize a single -arm, Simon’s 2-stage design with 2 interim  analyses  and a final 
analysis. The i nterim analysis  for Stage 1 will be conducted for DRC review when 13 pa tients are 
evaluable (EE) for ORR. If 0 responses are observed in up to 13 (EE)  patients, the cohort will be 
terminated in favor of the null hypothesis for futility, and no further par ticipants will be recruited. 
When at least 1 patient has an observed response at the interim analysis, up to a further 16 
patients may be evaluated, for a total of 29 (EE) patients (see Section 8.1), taking the overall 
risk-benefit of the combination into consideration. The interim analysis for Stage 2 will be 
conducted once all patients have been treated and/or followed up for at least 12 months. The final 
analysis for cohort C will occur at the time of study completion – see Section 8.6 for details. 
Cohort C will assess the anti-tumor activity and safety of bemcentinib when given in 
combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung with a 
maximum of one prior line of treatment with an anti-P D-(L)1 therapy in combination with a 
platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Bemcentinib  will be administered orally once daily.  On the first 3 days of administration, the 
bemcentinib  dose will be a ‘loading’ dose of 400 mg on Days 1, 2 and 3. From Day 4 onwards, 
patients will receive a daily dos e of 200 mg. A dose of 200 mg pembrolizumab will be given by 
intravenous (i.v.) infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks in all patients. The 3 -weekly 
pembrolizumab dosing schedule will be used to define 3 -week treatment cycles throughout the 
treatment perio d of the study. 
The bemcentinib  and pembrolizuma b dose levels selected for this study are summarized in Table 9.

Dosing of both drugs will commence on Day 1. On days when both bemcentinib and 
pembrolizumab are given, pembrolizumab will be given first and patients will be observed for 
1 hour for infusion and other adverse events. Bemcentinib may then be administ ered. 
4.1 Cohort A -Safety Run-In 
Pembrolizumab has not previously been combined with bemcentinib in patients (in any indication) 
and therefore, a safety nm-in will include a total of 12 patients. The internal DRC will conduct a 
review of the safety data from the first 6 patients who have had the potential to be followed for at 
least 6 weeks (minimum 2 cycles), and then again after a further 6 patients (12 patients in total) 
have had the potential to be followed for at least 6 weeks. At each of these safety reviews, the DRC 
will consider the rate of bemcentinib dose reductions and the rate of permanent discontinuation 
from bemcentinib and pembrolizumab. 
The DRC will consider whether to recommend a lower dose of bemcentinib ( dose level -1) for 
� tients. Dose level -1 is defined as - bemcentinib on Days 1, 2 & 3, followed by 
- from Day 4 onwards.
For the safety nm-in reviews, each patient will have had the potential to receive (as a minimum):
•2 cycles ofpembrolizumab.
•Bemcentinib at- for 3 days, followed by- daily for~ 6 weeks.
The DRC will consist of Principal Investigators, the Sponsors' (BerGenBio and Merck) medical 
monitors, and invited expe1ts as required, will review all patient safety data, including SAEs, AEs, 
laborato1y and ECG results, dosing info1m ation, including dose reductions and pe1manent 
discontinuations. 
4.2 End of Stage 1 -Efficacy Analysis and Review of Emerging Risk-Benefit Profile 
For coho1t A, the DRC will meet to review the ORR after 22 patients have been followed up for 
at least 24 weeks The DRC will document the ORR and, if it favors the null hypothesis for futility, 
will recommend if the study should proceed to evaluate up to a farther 26 patients. For cohort B, 
after 1 response has been confiimed, a subgroup of the DRC will meet to confirm continuation to 
Stage 2 and evaluation of 16 farther patients. An interim analysis (for Stage 1) will be conducted

after 13 evaluable patients have at least 1 on treatment scan and are evaluable (EE) for ORR . This 
data will be reviewed by the DRC. For cohort C, after 1 response has been confirmed, a subgroup 
of the DRC will meet to confirm continuation to Stage 2 and evaluation of 16 further patients. 
An interim analysis (for Stage 1) will be conducted after 13 evaluable patients have at least 1 
on treatment scan and are evaluable (EE) for ORR. This data will be reviewed by the DRC. 
See Section 8.2 for more information on the DRC. 
Where there is a suggestion of an immune response leading to a false categorization of disease 
progression, results from later tumor assessment scan time points may be used for the objective 
response assessment following the 2-stage single-arm design. The Sponsor may request ad-hoc 
DRC meetings at any time during the study to assess the safety data and review the need for dose 
modifications. For more details on the dose modification rules for bemcentinib 
and pembroli zumab, please refer to Section 6.6.1 and Section 6.6.2 .

4.3 Duration of Treatment  
Bemcentinib and pembrolizumab will be given until disease progression (in the absence of clinical 
deterioration, treatment can continue and disease progression should be confirmed after 4 weeks) 
or until an unacceptable toxicity has occurred which neces sitates treatment withdrawal 
(Section 6.6), or until 106 weeks (35 cycles) equivalent to calendar months. If it is decided at the 
Stage 1 analysis of any cohort that  the cohort is to be closed for recruitment, then pa rticipants who 
have s table d isease , even in the absence of PR or CR, w ill continue to be treated.  
NB: Participants who are still on study treatment after 35 cycles and continue to show benefit from 
the study treatment will be offered access to bemcentinib (e.g., under expanded excess program or 
roll over study) outside t he study, after discussion with t he sponsor, prior to study closure. 
Patients who discontinue bemcentinib treatment (for reasons other than disease progression) may 
be able to continue with (monotherapy) pembrolizumab until 106 weeks (that is, 35 completed 
cycles of pembrolizumab, equivalent to 24 calendar months).  
Patients who discontinue pembrolizumab (for reasons other than disease progression) may be able 
to continue with be mcentinib ( monotherapy) upon approval by the Sponsor until Study Closure .

5 STUDY SCHEDULE 
The study consists of a Screening period, Treatment period, Post Treatment Visit and Follow -up 
period.  Patients will attend the clinic for Screening period assessments up to 28 days before 
receiving the first dose of study treatment.  The Post Treatment Visit will occur 30 days (+/ - 3 days) 
after the patient has discontinued both study treatments. All patients will continue in follow -up 
visits and continue to have their disease assessed and scanned (unless progression of disease has 
already been confirmed) and for sur vival status.  
The study schedule will continue in keeping with the Study Assessment  calendar. P atients will be 
required to visit the study sites for each study visit (which includes each pembrolizumab dose).  
From Cycle 1 Day 8 onwards, a tolerance window of +/ - 3 days is permitted relative to Day 1. 
Pembrolizumab that cannot be given wi thin these tolerance windows will be treated as a missed 
dose, although it is acceptable to have a pembrolizumab dose interruption for up to 3 weeks for 
reasons other than toxicity. See Section 6.6.2 for details on pembrolizumab related toxicity dose 
interruption, including the duration of dose interruption. 
It is important that the calendar schedule for tumor  assessment relative to Cycle 1 day 1 is 
maintained (subject to permitted tolerance windows). If treatment administration is misaligned 
with weeks (e.g. because of treatment delay), the tumor assessment schedule should be maintained 
by week number ( Table 3 , Table 4 , Table 5  and Table 6 ). The schedule of disease assessment is 
every 12 weeks once a patient has stopped one or both or completed their (combination) treatment 
in the absence of progression. Assessments requiring spe cific timing relative to the bemcentinib 
or pembrolizumab dose are described in the footnotes to Schedule of Study Assessments -  Table 4, 
Table 5 , and Table 6 . 
5.1 Schedule of Study Assessments  
This section provides a list of study assessments described by visit. All procedures and assessmen ts 
should be conducted pre -dose unless otherwise specified. A summary of this information is also 
provided in Schedule of Study Assessments - Table 4 , Table 5  and Table 6  and associated 
footnotes. Additi
onal assessm
ents may be conducted as clinically indicated.

5.3 Description of Study Interventions and Assessments  
Details of the procedures to be followed for specified study assessments are provided. Additional 
assessments may be carried o
ut as clinically indicated.  
5.3.1 Demography and m edical h istory  
There will be a baseline assessment of demography (gender, race, ethnicity age (birth month and 
year), and medical history conducted a t Screening to confirm eligibility and to record significant 
medical history, including smoking history, PD -(L)1 st atus on diagnosis (cohort B and C patients 
only) and concurrent illnesses in the CRF. Concurrent illnesses recorded at Screening (excluding 
the primary disease under evaluation), that worsen in severity or frequency from  the time of signing 
the consent for m, but before treatment allocation need to be reported as an adverse event if the 
event causes the patient to be excluded from the trial or is a result of a protocol specific intervention 
(Section 7.1). 
5.3.2 Pregnancy an d FSH t est 
Female patients of reproductive potential will have a pregnancy test carried out at Screening.  This 
test must be carrie
d out within 3 days prior to first study drug administration. A urine test is 
acceptable; however, a positive or equivocal uri ne test must be confirmed by a blood test. Patients 
confirmed as pregnant will be excluded from parti cipation in the clinical study.  
Female patients of reproductive potential will continue to have a pregnancy test before each cycle 
of pembrolizumab or at leas
t monthly. 
Female patients who require documented confirmation of post -menopausal status will have  their 
FSH levels assessed at Screening.  Where post -menopausal status is not confirmed, patients will be 
required to undergo pregnancy testing per protocol to confirm suitability to proceed to dosing. 
5.3.3 ECOG p erformance s core 
ECOG PS will be assessed at the times given in Schedule of Study Assessments - Table 4, Table 5 
and Table 6. Details of the ECOG PS categories are presented in Appendix A. Patients must be 
confirmed as ECOG PS 0 or 1 at Screening in order to be eligible for study participation. 
5.3.4 Vital signs 
Vital sign parameters will be taken at the times given in Schedule of Study Assessments -  Table 4, 
Table 5  and Table 6 . The date and time of collection will be recorded in the source data and on the 
CRF. 
Vital sign  parameters w ill consist of  measurements of  temperature, r esting  heart rate, s eated bl ood 
pressur e and  respiratory r ate. 
If any clinically significant findings are identified during the assessment of vital signs, the 
Investigator will record it as part of the medical history prior to start of dosing and as an AE post 
dose, where the finding represents a change from baseline. Findings identified prior to start of 
dosing must be checked against the study exclusion criteria (see Section 3.2).

5.3.5 Physical exam 
A physical examination, including measurement of weight, will be taken at the times given in 
Schedule of Study Assessments - T
able 4 , Table 5  and Table 6 . The patient’s height will be 
measu
red at Screening.  The patient
’s weight will also be assessed at Screening and at the start of 
every cycle.  Height and body weight will be obtained while the patient is wearing light clothing 
(without shoes). 
A full physical examination will include assessment of the following categories: head, eyes, ears, 
nose, throat, heart, lungs, abdomen, skin, muscul
oskeletal, extremities, neurological , lymph nodes, 
and ‘other’. After the Screening assessment, the physical examination may be reduced to a symptom- directed assessment.  
If any clinically significant findings are identified during the physical examination, the Investigator will record it as part of the medical
 history prior to start of dosing and as an adverse event post 
dose, where the finding represents a change from baseline. 
5.3.6 Clinical chemistry , hematology, coagulation and urinalysi s 
Blood and urine samples for determination of  clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation and 
urinalysis parameters will be taken at the times given in Schedule of Study Assessments – Table 4, 
Table 5  and Table 6  and prior to administration of study treatment . The date and time of collection 
will be recorded in the source data and on the CRF. 
All testing  will be  performed a t each s ite’s loc al laborator y. Coagulation  parameters m ay be 
assessed from  the hematology s ample. 
Copies of  laboratory a ccreditation  certificates an d reference ranges w ill be obtained from  each 
study site prior to the analysis of their first patient sample. 
The laboratory variables to be measured are described in Appendix E. 
If any clinically significant findings are identified from the safety lab assessments, the Investigator 
will record it as part of the medical history prior to start of dosing and as an AE post dose, where 
the finding represents a change from baseline. Findings identified prior to start of dosing must be 
checked against the study inclusion and exclusion criteria ( Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 ). 
5.3.7 Thyroid f unction t est 
Blood samples for thyroid function testing will be taken at the times given in Schedule of Study 
Assessment Table 4 , Table 5  and Table 6 . The date and time of collection will be recorded in the 
source data and on the CRF. 
The thyroid as
sessment panel should include:  
• Triiodothyronine (T3) or Free Triiodothyronine (FT3)
• Free thyroxine (FT4)
• Thyroid stim
ulating hormone (TSH)
.
All testing will be performed at each site’s local laboratory. This assessment may be 
performed from the clinical chemistry sample (see Section 5.3.6). Copies of laboratory

certificates and reference ranges will be obtained from each study site prior to the analysis of their 
first patient sample. Laboratory variables to be measured are described in Appendix E. 
If any clinically significant findings are identified, the Investigator will record it as part of the 
medical history prior to start of dosing and as an AE post dose, where the finding represents a 
change from baseline. Findings identified prior to start of dosing must be checked against the study 
inclusion criteria (see Section 3.1 ). 
5.3.8 Echocardiography or MUGA  
An echocardiography or MUGA assessment will be performed at Screening, and after every 6 
months (every 8 cycles thereafter i.e., Cycle 9, Day 1; Cycle 17, Day 1; Cycle 25, day 1; Cycle 33, 
Day 1) until the end of 2 years. 
Clinically significant findings identified prior to start of dosing must be checked against the 
study e xclusion criteria (Section 3.2 ). 
Patients who discontinue bemcentinib, but continue with monotherapy pembrolizumab, will stop 
undergoing an echocardi ogram or MUGA assessment. Their final echocardiogram/MUGA 
assessment will occur if their next scheduled assessment is within the next 6 weeks (of 
discontinuing be mcentinib) . 
5.3.9 Electrocardiogram  
A resting 12- lead ECG will be performed at the times given in Schedule of Study Assessments - 
Table 4 , Table 5  and Table 6 . Each assessment time point must be performed in triplicate  before 
starting treatment with bemcentinib.  
All 12- lead ECG s should be recorded while the patient is in the supine position. ECGs will be 
recorded at 25 mm/sec. All efforts should be made to ensure that an identical ECG machine is used 
to collect traces for individual patients. The Investigator or designated physician will review the 
ECG results. 
If any clinically significant findings are observed on the ECG, the Investigator will record it as 
part of the medical history prior to the start of dosing, and as an AE post dose where the finding 
represents a change from baseline. Clinically significant findings identified prior to start of dosing 
must be c hecked against the study exclusion criteria (Section 3.2 ). 
Note that the average value of the three assessments performed at each time point should be 
applied, except at Screening, where both the Screening and pre -dose Cycle 1 Day 1 assessments 
should be combined. Patients may be excluded based on the initial triplicate assessment at 
Screening.  
Patients who discontinue bemcentinib but continue with monotherapy pembrolizumab will stop 
undergoing an ECG. 
Patients who ha ve a bemcentinib interruption of for 14 days due to QTc prolongation or 12 weeks  
for immune -related toxicities  (see Table 12  and Table 13 ) will require an ECG twice weekly for 
the 2 weeks following rec om
mencement of bemcentinib daily dosing.  This is to ensure cardiac 
safety monitoring whilst bemcentinib r eturns to stead state.

5.3.10 Tumor Assessment Scans 
Efficacy endpoints in this study, including ORR, DoR, PFS will all be based on tumor assessment 
scan e val
uation by R ECIST 1.12. 
RECIST assessments will be performed at the times given in Schedule of Study Assessments - 
Table 4 , Table 5 , Table 6  and Table 7  using contrast -enhanced CT (preferred method) or MRI 
assessments of chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Additionally, x-ray and bone scans will be used as 
appropriate.  Additional anatomy should be imaged based on signs and symptoms of individual 
patients at baseline and follow-up. 
Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before start of study treatment, 
and ideally should be performed as close as possible to the start of study treatment. The Screening 
scan assessments must confirm the patient has measurable disease per RECIST 1.12 (see Inclusion 
Criteria Section 3.1 ). 
For each patient, the same modality used at Screening must be used serially throughout the duration 
of study participation. All  scan procedures will be performed according to standard local scan 
protocols to ensure consistency across study assessments. 
All radiological and non-radiological (e.g., MRI) s cans will be  reviewed by t he local s ite 
investigator; and if possible, stored electronicall y (de- identified w ith the  patient ’s not es) at site .  
A maximum of 5 target lesions , maximum of 2 per organ,  must be selected at baseline. All target 
lesions are measurable. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (longest diameter 
for non-nodal lesions or short axis for nodal lesions), but in addition should be those that lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. All remaining lesions present at baseline are 
considered non target, irrespective of whether they are measurable. 
Disease assessments will be performed as per the schedule described in  Table 4  and Table 5  – that 
is, every 9 w eeks ±7 days for the first 46 w eeks relative to the date of first treatment administration 
and then every 12 w eeks ±7 days thereafter until confirmed objective disease progression as 
defined by RECIST 1.12 (irrespective of a delay to treatment or the reason for stopping treatment 
or subsequent therapy). 
Any other sites at which new disease is suspecte d should also be adequately imaged at a follow-up 
visit. 
If an unscheduled assessment is performed and the patient has not progressed, ever y attempt should 
be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their scheduled visits. 
In addition to performing further scans where clinically indicated, scans also should be performed, 
as appropriate, to confirm response or disease progression. 
5.3.11 Disease as sessment 
A disease asses sment according to RECIST 1.12 will be performed and recording in the CRF 
whenever a tumor assessment scan is made during the Treatment period, Post Treatment Visit or 
during Follow Up Visits.

5.3.12 Biomarkers  
Evaluation of biomarkers will be performed at the time points described in Schedule of Study 
Assessments -  Table 4 , Tab
le 5, Table 6  and Table 7 . 
Blood samples will be collected at these time points to prepare PMBC and blood samples for 
assessm
ent of Axl inhibition and other relevant markers including sAxl such as MAPK signaling 
pathway intermediates  (ERK/pERK) , pAxl expression and T -cell populations, Akt, pAkt, 
SLFN11, Bcl2, and Puma. 
Full details of the blood volumes required, plus requirements for sample collection, handling and 
shipment to the assigned 
central laboratory, will be described in Laboratory  Manu al for the study. 
5.3.13 Tumor Sample Requirements  
All patients are requ
ired to have a fresh (newly acquired) tumor biopsy. This can be taken up to 3 
months before treatment
 starts provided the patient has not received any further chemotherapy or 
immunotherapy, or other anti -cancer therapy in the intervening period and that sufficient tumor 
tissue is available.  
Tumor specimens are to be submitted in sufficient quantity to allow for PD -L1 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Axl IHC analys is (see the Path ology Manual). 
Samples with limited tumor content (<100 viable tumor cells), cytology, cell block, decalcified or 
formalin fixed but previously frozen, frozen sample, plastic embedded, bone, bone marrow, clot 
and fine needle aspirates are inadequate for de fining tumor PD -L1 and Axl status. 
Axl expression can only be obtained from a fresh (newly acquired) tumor tissue sample. PD -L1 
expression can be determined from either a fresh (newly acquired) or archival sample. In all cases, 
the tumor tissue must not have been previously irradiated. 
Different testing laboratories will be used for Axl kinase and PD- L1 expression. 
The fresh (newly acquired) tumor tissue sample will be either newly obtained core needle biopsy 
(minimum gauge 18) or ne wly obtained excisional biopsy. 
The following tumor tissue alternatives  are a vailable (all options require fresh tumor tissue sample ; 
however, if there  is insufficient fresh tumor tissue available, the 3rd option below allows the 
submission of archival tissue in addition to the fresh tissue sample ): 
•Where only a core needle biopsy is used, a minimum of 4 core (with 1 -cm tumor in each
cor
e) biopsy samples are required. These should be placed in formalin and processed into
2 single paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks (2 cores in one block and 2 cores in the ot her
block) within 24-48 hours.
•Alternatively, where only a newly obtaine d excisional biopsy sample is used, this biopsy
should be processed into 2 paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks within 24-48 hours.
•Alternatively , 2 core (with 1 -cm tumor i n each core) needle (fresh tumor ) biopsies or a
single newly obtained excisional biopsy sample can be submitted (processed into one FFPE

10 unstained slides each 5  µm cut from the archival tumor sample block. 
If an archival tumor tissue block is to  be sent, it is suggested that  a minimum of 10 unstained slides 
each 5  µm cut from the archival tumor sample block  must be sent (rather than  sending the  whole 
archival block) and clearly labelled  as having come from an archival block. 
Optional ‘on study’ tumor tissue (fresh tiss ue) biopsies can be conducted on up to 2 separate 
occasions on suitable lesions (for example, lesions that have progressed). Separate patient consent 
is required for these ‘on study’ biopsies.

6.1 Preparation and Dosing of Study Treatments 
Fmther details on preparation and administration of both bemcentinib and pembrolizumab are 
provided in the Pha1macy Manuals. 
6.1.1 Bemcentinib 
Bemcentinib is provided in bottles containing a specified number of capsules per bottle to dispense 
to the patients. Patients will be asked to take the specified number of capsules for their prescribed 
dose on an empty stomach at a regular time each day with water. Patients should not eat for at least 
one hour following bemcentinib. Rescue treatment with antacids, proton pump inhibitors and 
histamine receptor 2 inhibitors can be initiated, provided they are taken in the evening. On 
pembrolizumab dosing days, patients will be asked not to take their bemcentinib dose before 
coming into the clinic. On these days, pembrolizumab will be administered first, and the patient 
observed for 1 hour after the end of infosion (for infosion and other AEs), prior to taking their 
bemcentinib dose (on an empty stomach and with water). 
6.1.2 Pembrolizumab 
Pembrolizumab will be administered at a dose of 200 mg (two vials) given as a 30-minute i.v. 
infusion through an intravenous line containing a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein-binding 0.2-
5 micron in-line or add-on filter. Dosing will be on Day 1 of each 3-week treatment cycle. 
Trial treatment of pembrolizumab may be administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled 
Day 1 of each cycle due to administrative reasons 
Sites should make eve1y effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible. 
However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window between -5 minutes 
and +10 minutes is pe1mitted i.e., infusion time may be 30 minutes -5 min/+ 10 min. 
6.2 Treatment Compliance 
The patient will be asked to bring all bottles, including the empty ones, with them to each study 
visit to check compliance and for the Dmg Accountability and Dose Log to be completed in the 
eCRF.

6.5 Method of Enrolling Patient to Study Treatment 
Dming Screening, patients will be allocated a unique screening number from RA VE once written, 
info1med consent has been obtained. Patients will be identified by this number throughout the 
study. Once a Subject Number has been assigned, it cannot be used again. 
6.6 Dose Modifications 
Note that 4 toxicities have been identified as being potentially overlapping with both bemcentinib 
and pembrolizumab -diaIThea, rash, renal toxicity and increased ALT ancVor AST. Please see 
Section 6.6.3 for the management of these toxicities. 
Other toxicities can be managed as described in Section 6.6.1 and Section 6.6.2 . 
6.6.1 Bemcentinib dose modification for toxicity 
As the study involves bemcentinib given in combination with pembrolizumab, the guidance of 
dose modification of bemcentinib for related toxicities was harmonized with pembrolizumab. If a 
patient experiences diug related toxicity that requires treatment with bemcentinib to be intem1pted, 
a delay of up to 12 weeks is pe1mitted to allow for resolution of toxicity. If, after a 12-week 
intem1ption, treatment-related toxicity has not resolved, treatment with bemcentinib needs to be 
discontinued pe1manently or ftuther dosing of bemcentinib should be discussed with the medical 
monitor. 
See Table 11 for detailed guidance on the dose modification ofbemcentinib. 
If treatment with bemcentinib is intem1pted, the relevant toxicity must have resolved to � Grade 1 
or baseline for treatment to recommence. 
Dose reduction of bemcentinib from 200 mg to 100 mg daily dose is allowed. Following dose 
reduction of bemcentinib to 100 mg daily dose, if the toxicity is resolved or rehuned to baseline, 
the dose ofbemcentinib can be increased to 200 mg daily.

•Patients require an ECG twice weekly for 2 weeks after recommencing bemcentinib following an interruption
(see Section 5.3.9 )
Treatment with bemcentinib can cause QTc prolongation. In order to reduce the risk of QTc 
prolongation, all effo1ts should be made to maintain the patient's semm potassium levels at 
>4 nunol/L during treatment with bemcentinib and for 2 weeks following completion of therapy
(at an unscheduled visit, if required). Serum calcium and magnesium should be measured and
reasonable effo1ts made to maintain at n01mal levels throughout the sh1dy treatment. Patients with
an average QTc of �480 ms should be closely monitored until the QTc falls below 480 ms;
electrolytes should be measured and coITected as necessa1y.
If a patient experiences QTc prolongation, bemcentinib dosing should be modified as outlined 
in Table 12, however, it is strongly advised to discuss any event of QTc prolongation with the 
medical monitor. Treatment with bemcentinib should be permanently discontinued in the 
presence of ventricular aIThythmia.

6.6.2 Pembrolizumab  dose modifications 
Adverse events (both non-serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab exposure may 
represent an immunologic etiology. These  immune -related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after 
the first dose or several months after the last dose of pembrolizumab  treatment  and may affect 
more than one body system simultaneously. Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment 
is critical to reduce complications. B ased on existing clinical study data, most irAEs were 
reversible and could be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of 
corticosteroids,  and/or other supportive care. For suspected irAEs, adequate evaluation must be 
ensured to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Additional procedures or tests such as 
bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin photography may be included as part of the evaluation. Based 
on the severity of irAEs, pembrolizumab must be withheld or permanently discontinued, and 
corticosteroids should be administered as per Table 13 below. See Section 6.11 for supportive 
care guidelines, including use of corticosteroids.

Table 13: Dose Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune -related AEs Associated with Pembrolizumab   
General instructions:  
1.Severe and life- threatening irAEs should be treated with IV corticosteroids followed by oral steroids. Other immunosuppressive treatment should
begin if  the irAEs are not controlled by corticosteroids.
2.Pembrolizumab must be permanently discontinued if the irAE does not resolve or the corticosteroid dose is not ≤10 mg/day withi n 12 weeks of
the last pembrolizumab treatment.
3.The cortic osteroid taper should begin when the irAE is ≤ Grade 1 and continue at least 4 weeks.
4.If pembrolizumab has been withheld, pembrolizumab may resume after the irAE decreased to ≤  Grade  1 after  corticosteroid taper.

Four tox1c1t1es are identified as potentially overlapping with both bemcentinib and 
pembrolizumab: dianhea, rash (including de1matitis, pruritus), renal toxicity (renal failure, semm 
creatinine elevation, nephritis) and increases in ALT and AST. 
See also, Suppo1tive Care Guidelines for Pembrolizumab -Section 6.11. 
6.6.3.1 Dose modifications for diarrhea 
Patients may continue with baseline anti-dianheal medications throughout the study treatment with 
pembrolizumab and bemcentinib. If a patient experiences an increase in dianheal symptoms after 
staiting bemcentinib they may increase the dose of anti-dianheal medication such as loperamide 
during the first week of treatment only. Sta1ting ti·eatment with loperamide is also acceptable 
during this period. Thereafter any increased dianheal symptoms should be reported to the 
investigator immediately and further medication should not be given. See Table 14.

6.8 Permitted and Restricted Concomitant Medications  
In general, m edications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not 
allowed during the ongoing trial. Treatment with antacids, proton pump inhibitors and histamine 
receptor 2 inhibitors can be initiated  as rescue therapy after patients have been receiving 
bemcentinib  for one week, provided they are taken in the evening. 
If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccination specifically prohibited during the 
trial, disc
ontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required. The investigator should 
discuss any questions regarding this with the Sponsor Clinical Director. The final decision on any 
supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the patient's primary physician.  
However, the decision to continue the patient on trial therapy or vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the investigator, the Sponsor and the patient. 
6.9 Acceptable Concomitant Medications  
All treatments that the Investigator considers necessary for a patient’s welfare may be administered 
at the discretion of the Investigator in keeping with the community standards of medical care. A ll 
concomitant medication will be recorded on the CRF including all prescription, over-the-counter , 
herbal supplements, and i.v.  medications and fluids. If changes occur during the trial period, 
documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the C RF. 
All concomitant medications received within 30 days before the first dose of trial treatment and 
30 days after the last dose of trial treatment should be recorded. Concomitant medications 
administered after 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs and 
Events of Clinical Interest (ECIs) as defined in Section 7.4.3.2. 
6.10 Prohibited C oncomitant Med ications whilst r eceiving P embrolizumab  
Patients are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the Screening and Treatment 
period (including retreatment for post-complete response relapse) of  this trial: 
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy;
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol;
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol;
• Investigational agents other than bemcentinib  and pembroli zumab;
• Radiation therapy:
o Note:  Radiation t herapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be
considered on an exceptional case by case basis  after consultation with Sponsor.
The patient must have clear measurable disease outside the radiated field.
Administration of palliative radiation therapy will be considered clinicalprogression for the purposes of determining PFS. Note: Treatment with
pembrolizumab and bemcentinib  must have been discontinued at least one week
prior to radiotherapy and should not be restarted within one week of completingradiotherapy.
• Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while
participatin
g in the trial.  Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the
following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and

typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed 
virus vaccines and are allowed.  However, intranasal influenza vaccines ( e.g., Flu - 
Mist®) are live attenuate d vaccines, and are not allowed; 
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an
event of clinic
al interest of suspected immunologic etiology. The use of physiologic
doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor:
o Note: Inhaled steroids are allowed for management of asthma.
Patients who, in the assessment by the investigator, require the use  of any of the aforementioned 
treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  Patients may receive other 
medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.  
The Exclusion  Criteria describes ot her m edications t hat ar e pro hibited in th is trial. 
There are no prohibited therapies during the Follow Up period once the patient has discontinued 
both tr eatments. 
6.11 Supportive Care Guidelines an d Rescue Medications for Pembrolizumab 
Patients should receive appropriate s upportive care measures as deemed necessary by the treating 
investigator.  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs  with potential 
immunologic etiology are outlined below. Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of 
oral or i ntravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti- inflammatory agents 
if symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids.  
Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the 
steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such 
as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care.  
The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to 
be related to pembrolizumab. 
Note: If after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator does not 
need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined below). Refer to Section 6.6 for 
dose modification. 
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin 
photography as part of evaluation of the event. 
6.12 Infusion G uidelines f or Pembrolizumab

6.13.1 Diet 
Patients should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE such as 
diarrhea, nausea or vomiting. 
6.14 Contraception 
Pembrolizumab and bemcentinib may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero. Furthermore, it is 
not known if pembrolizumab has transient AEs on the composition of sperm. For this trial, male 
patients will be considered to be of non-reproductive potential if they have azoospemlia (whether 
due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical condition). 
Female patients will be considered of non-reproductive potential if they are either: 
OR 
OR • postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an alternative
medical cause; in women <45 years of age a high FSH level in the postmenopausal
range may be used to confum a post-menopausal state in women not using ho1monal
contraception or ho1monal replacement therapy. In the absence of 12 months of
amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.);
• have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or
bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion, at least 6 weeks prior to screening;
• has a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing.

Female and male patients of reproductive potential must agree use highly effective methods of 
contraception while receiving study drug and for 120 days after the last dose of study drug by 
complying with one of the following highly effective methods‡: 
•Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associatedwith inhibition of

•practice absti
nence from heterosexual activity†
†Abstinence (r
elative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if 
it is consiste
ntly employed as the patient’s preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered 
acceptable by local regulatory agencies and Institutional Review Board ( IRB)/Institutional Ethics 
Committee ( IECs ). Periodic abstinence e.g ., calendar, ovulation, sympto- thermal, post -ovulation 
methods, etc. and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
‡If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by local regulations/guidelines, then it does 
not qualify as an ac
ceptable method of contr aception for patients participating at sites in this 
country/region. 
Patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the 
fetus  (
unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. In order to participate in t he 
study, patients of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study period up to 120 days  after the last dose 
of trial therapy. If there is any question that a patient of childbearing potential will not reliably 
comply with the requirements for contraception, that patient should not be entered into the study.

6.14.1 Use in pregnancy 
If a patient inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with study medication, the patient 
will immediately be re
moved from the study.  The site will contact the patient at least monthly and 
document the patient’s status until the pregnancy has bee n completed or terminated.  The outcome 
of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience e.g ., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -
threatening complication to the mother or new-born. The study Investigator will make every effort 
to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus

7 ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
7.1 Assessment of Safety  
Progression of the cancer unde r study is not considere d an adverse event unless it is considered to 
be drug-related by the investigator. 
All AEs that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment allocation  must be 
reported by the investigator if they cause the subject to be excluded from the t rial or  are the result 
of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of 
usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. 
From the time of treatment allocation through 30 days following cessation of treatment, all 
AEs must be reported by the investigator . Such events will be recorded at each examination on 
the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets. 
The reporting timeframe for AEs meeting any serious criteria is described in Section 7.4.3. The 
investiga tor will make every attempt to follow all subjects with non -serious  AEs  for outcome. 
From the time of treatment allocation through 90 days following cessation of treatment, all 
SAEs  (including serious events of special  interest) must be reported by the investigator.  
Where a patient has initiated a new cancer treatment, the time period is 30 days after cessation of 
treatment. See Section 7.4.3.1 and Section 7.4.3.2 . 
The reporting timeframe for a new pregnancy is described in  Section 7.5. 
7.2 Adverse Event D efinition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the product.  
An AE can therefore be any unf avorable or unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally 
associated with the use of the IMP whether or not cons idered related to the IMP.  This includes any 
occurrence that is new, an exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening of the character, 
frequency or severity of a known condition) or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, 
including clinically signi ficant laboratory test abnormalities. 
Suggested cr iteria for  the assessment  of clinical significanc e for  laboratory abnormalities ar e as 
follows. 
The laborator y abnormality: 
•is clearly consistent with the pattern of the patient’s underlying disease or dise ase
progression;
•is accompanied by clinical symptoms;
•requires study drug dose modification or interruption or permanent discontinuation of
study treatment;
•requi
res more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.;
•requires a ch ange in concomitant m edication, therapy, or treatment.
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome ( e.g., alkaline 
phosphatase
 and bilirubin 5X ULN associated with cholecystitis), only the diagnosis ( e.g., 
cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the AE CRF. If the clinically significant laboratory

BGBC008 / PN -531 – NSCLC Version 1 1.0 26 January 2022  93 of 126 
abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded as an 
AE or SAE on the CRF.  If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical 
term, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE or SAE. For example, an elevated serum 
potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.”  Observations of the same 
clinically significant laboratory abnormality f rom visit to visit should not be repeatedly recorded 
as AEs or SAEs on the CRF, unless their severity, seriousness, or etiology changes. 
For all AEs, a diagnosis should be recorded on the CRF rather than individual signs and symptoms 
(e.g., record only liv
er failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated 
transaminases) wherever possible.  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot 
be medically characterized as a single syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual si gn 
and/or symptom should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently 
established, the reported event term should be updated to reflect the medical diagnosis. 
Note that AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separ ated in time or me dically 
significant should be recorded as independent events on the CRF. For example, if a severe 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to a renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on 
the CRF.  
A pre -existing medical condition  which is pres ent at the start of the study and described in the 
Medical History CRF, should only be recorded as an AE or SAE if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on the AE CRF, it is important to convey the concept that the pre -existing condition has changed by including 
applicable descriptors (e.g ., “more frequent headaches”).  
Surgical procedures or other therapeutic interventions themselves are not AEs, but the condition for which the sur
gery/intervention is required is an AE and should be documented accordingly. 
Planned surgical measures and the condition(s) leading to these measures are not AEs, if the condition(s) wa
s (were) known before the period of observation and did not worsen during study. 
In the latter case, the condition should be reported as medical history. 
During clinical trials, AEs can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open- ended 
questioning, e
xamination, or evaluation of a patient. To prevent reporting bias, patients should not 
be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs. Symptoms and signs of exacerbation or worsening of the patient’s primary disease will not be 
captured as AEs
. Progression of the disease under study ( i.e., NSCLC ) will not be captured as an 
AE unless it is considered to be drug-related by the Investigator. 
7.3 Importance of Adverse Event Reporting  
Timely and com
plete reporting of safety information assists BerGenBio in identifying any 
untoward medica
l occurrence, thereby allowing: 
• safety of study patients;
• a greater
 understanding of the overall safety profile of the investigational drug;
• recognition of
 dose-related investigational drug toxicity;
• appropriate
 modification of study protocols;
• improvement
s in study design or procedures; and

• adherence to worldwide regulatory requirements.
7.4 Evaluating Adverse Events
Following the patient’s written consent to participate in the study, AEs occurring after consent, 
but before treatment, and during treatment and within 30 days after cessation of treatment 
are collected in accordance with Section 7.1 , Section 7.4.3 and Section 7.5 . 
All identified AEs must be accurately recorded and described on the appropriate AE page of the 
eCRF. If known, the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder should be recorded, rather than 
its individual symptoms. The following information should be captured for all AEs: date of 
onset and resolution, severity of the event (see definitions in Section 7.4.1), Investigator's opinion 
of the relationship to IMP (see definitions in Section 7.4.2) and assessment whether the event was 
serious or 
non-serious (see definitions in Section 7.4.3). In addition, treatment required for  the 
AE, action taken with IMP, information regarding resolution/outcome. 
7.4.1 Assessment of severity  
All AEs (including SAEs) are to be accurately recorded on the AE page of the patient’s eCRF.  
Each event will be graded f
or severity using the classifications of NCI CTCAE v 5.0. For events 
not addressed in the NCI CTCAE v5.0, classifications the following grading will apply: 
• Mild (Grade 1)  - Mild; asymptomatic or mild  symptoms; clinical or diagnostic
observations only; intervention not indicated.
• Moderate (Grad e 2) - Moderate; minimal,  local or non-invasive intervention
indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental activity of daily living.
• Severe (Grade 3)  - Severe or medic ally significant but not immediately life -
threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated;
disabling; limiting self -care activity of daily living.
• Life-threatening (Grade 4)  - Life-threatening c onsequences; urgent
intervention indicated.
• Death (Grade 5)  - Related to adverse ev ent.
7.4.2 Assessment of relationship
All AEs (including SAE
s) will be assessed for the relationship of the AE to both pembrolizumab 
and bemcentinib  study drug using the
 following definitions: 
• Not/unlikely related  - The AE is not relat ed if exposure to the investigational product
has not occurred, OR the occurrence of the AE is not reasonably related in time, OR
the AE is considered unlikely to be related to use of the investigational product because
there are no facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship AND  there
is a possible alternative explanation.
• Possibly related  - The administrati on of the investigational product and AE are
considered reasonably related in time AND  the AE could be explained by causes other
than exposure to the investigational product.
• Probably related  - Exposure to the inves tigational product and AE are reasonably
related in time AND  the investigational product is more likely than other causes to be
responsible for the AE OR  is the most likely cause of the AE.

• Definitely related  - There is a reasonable temporal sequence between exposure to the
investigational product and the AE, OR  the event follows a known or expected
response pattern to the investigational product, AND  is confirmed by improvement on
stopping the dosage of the investigational product. It may also be confirmed by
reappearance upon repeated exposure where this is medically and ethically acceptable.
The relationship of the study treatment to an AE will be determined by the Investigator and 
subsequently revi
ewed by the m edical monitor. 
For reporting and data analysis purposes, AEs reported with a causality assessment of “Definitely”, “Probably”, and “P
ossibly” are to be considered as “having a reasonable causal  relationship” to 
study drug. In case of disagreement between the Investigator and the Sponsor’s m edical monitor, 
the more conservative assessment will determine the reportability of the case.  
7.4.3 Immediate reporting of AEs and e vents of c lini cal interest to t he Sponsor  
7.4.3.1 Serious adv erse events  
An SAE  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose (including overdose): 
• Results i
n death.
• Is life -thre
atening:
o “Life- thr
eatening ” means that the patient was at immediate risk of death at the
time of the SAE; it does not refer to an SAE that hypothetically might havecaused death if it were more severe.
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization:
o This means 
 that hospital inpatient admission or prolongation of hospital stay
were requir
ed for the treatment of the SAE or that they occurred as a
consequence of the event.
o Visits to a hospital by ambulance or to the emergency room without admissionwill not be re 
garded as hospitalization unless the event fulfils  any other of the
serious criteria .
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity:
o “Persiste
nt or significant disability or incapacity” means a permanent or
significant
 and substantial disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal
life functions.
• Is a congenital anom aly or birth de fect.
• Is an important medical event:
o Medical a
nd scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether
expedited repor
ting is appropriate in situations where none of the outcomes
listed above occurred. Important medical events that may not be immediately
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the
patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listedin the definition above should also usually be considered serious. Examples ofsuch events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in anemergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not resultin inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drugabuse.

Note: In addition to the above criteria, AEs  meeting either of the below criteria, although not 
serious per International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) definition, are reportable to the Sponsor 
in the same timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local requirements.  
Therefore, these events are considered serious by the Sponsor for collection purposes.  
• Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study);
• Is associated with an overdose.
All patient
s with SAEs must be followed up for outcome. 
For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment allocation, any SAE , 
or follow up to a S
AE, including death due to any cause other than progression of the cancer under 
study, that occurs to any patient  must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor if it causes the 
patient  to be excluded from the trial, or is the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including 
but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.
 
For the  time period beginning at treatment allocation through 90 days following cessation of 
treatment, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the patient  initiates new anticancer 
therapy, whichever is earlier, any serious adverse event, or follow up to a  SAE , including death 
due to any cause other than progression of the cancer under study, whether or not related to the Sponsor's product, must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor either by electronic media or paper.  Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines. Paper 
reporting procedures can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent).
 
Additionally, any serious adverse event, considered by an investigator who is a qualified physician to be related t o the Sponsor's product that is brought to the attention of the investigator at any time 
following consent through the end of the specified safety follow -up period specified in the 
paragraph above, or at any time outside of the time period specified in the  previous paragraph also 
must be reported immediately to the Sponsor. 
All patients  with SAEs  must
  be followed up for outcome. 
7.4.3.2 Events of c linic al interest  
Selected non -serious and S AEs are also known as Events of Clinical Interest (ECI) and must be 
reported to the Sponsor. For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment allocation, any ECI, 
or follow up to an EC
I, that occurs to any subject must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor 
if it causes the subject to be excluded from the trial or  is the result of a protocol -specified 
intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.
 
For the time period beginning at treatment allocation through 30 days following cessation of treatment, any ECI, or follow up to an ECI, whether or not related to the Sponsor’s product, must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor, either by electronic media or paper . Electronic 
reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines. Paper reporting procedures 
can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent).

Law Criteria held in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent).
7.4.4 Reporting SAEs and ECis 
Adverse events classified as SAEs or ECis must be recorded on the designated eCRF page and 
require expeditious handling and reporting to the Drug Safety group at INC to comply with 
regulato1y requirements. 
The Principal Investigator (or designee) will notify INC within 24 hours of identifying an SAE or 
ECI, whether related or um-elated to investigational drug, by completing the SAE form and faxing 
the eCRF pages and any available suppo1ting documentation to INC (see below for contact details). 
When an overdose or diug misuse of either of the investigational products occurs with an adverse 
outcome, the Investigator should only complete the designated AE or SAE eCRF page. 
Expeditious handling and repo1ted may be appropriate. 
In the case of pregnancy, a separate 'pregnancy' and 'pregnancy outcome' form is used. However, 
the 
patient should be withdi·awn from sh1dy treatment and appropriate follow up agreed with the 
Sponsor.

7.4.5 Assessment of E xpected  Adverse Events  
The Sponsor will assess all SAEs whether they are expected or unexpected.  An unexpected AE is  
any adverse drug event considered to be at least possibly related to bemcentinib  or pembrolizumab 
where the outcome, specificity, or severity of which is not consistent with those noted in the current 
IB for bemcentinib , or the Summary of Product Characteristics ( SmPC ) or Prescribing Information 
for pembrolizumab. 
7.5 Reporting of Pregnancy or Lactation 
Although pregnancy a
nd lactation are not considered AEs , it is the respon sibility of investigators 
or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a patient (spontaneously reported to them) 
that occurs during the trial.  
Pregnancies and lactations that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment 
allocation/rand
omization must be reported by the investigator if they ca use the patient to be 
excluded from the trial or  are the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not 
limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, pla cebo treatment or a procedure.  
Pregnancies and lactations that occur f rom the time of f irst dose of study treatment through to 120 
days following cessation of Sponsor’s product, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the 
patient initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, must be reported by the investiga tor. 
All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy.  
Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal  death, intrauterine death, miscarriage, and stillbirth must be reported as 
serious events (as Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome 
(health of infant) must also be reported.
 
Pregnancies are to be reported using the same procedures/transmission methods as SAEs: the same fax numbers / email address / same SAE cover sheet.  A study specific pregnancy for will be 
provided for pregnancy reporting.  
7.6 Definition of Misuse and Overdose  
Bemcentinib
 overdose is defined as any dose exceeding the loading dose (  of bemcentinib. 
For this trial, a pembrolizumab  overdose  will be defined  as ≥1000  mg (5 times the dose) of 
pembrolizumab.  No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of 
pembrolizumab. In the event of overdose, the subject should be obser ved closely for signs of 
toxicity. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. 
If the pharmacy discovers that an overdose has or may have been administered, they should contact 
the Study Investigator immediately. The Study Investigator will determine if the overdose is 
an Event of Clinical Interest (see Section 7.4.3.2). 
7.7 Investigational Product Complaints 
Pharmaceutical technical complaints associated with the investigational product mu st be reported 
to t
he Sponsor immediately. The same reporti ng timelines as for SAEs apply.

7.8 Reporting SAEs to the IRB or IEC  
The Investigator must comply with the applicable regulatory requirements related to the reporting 
of SAEs to the 
IRB or local Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC).  All SAEs that are related and 
unexpected must be reported by the Investigator (or alternative responsible person where specified in study delegation log) to the IEC/IRBs responsible for the study.  
In such cases, the D rug Safety group wi
 ll send the Principal Investigator a Council for International 
Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) or MedWatch form describing the event, for t hem to 
report to their IEC/IRB. Other SAEs ( i.e., expected or unr
 elated SAEs) should be reported per the relevant institution’s 
procedures. The Principal Investigator should also comply with the IEC/IRB procedures for reporting any other 
safety inform
ation. Where required, submission of Safety Updates by the Principal Investigator to 
Competen t Authorities should be handled according to local regulations. The Principal 
Investigator must inform the Sponsor or their designated Clinical Research Organization ( CRO ) 
regarding these local requirements. Periodically (at least annually), the IB will be updated to 
include new and relevant safety information. 
Until such time that an AE becomes identified in the bemcentinib  IB, it should be cons idered 
unexpected in regard to bemcentinib  causality, regardless of whether the AE has been the patient 
of a previous Safety Update.  
7.9 Follow Up Information on an SAE 
Collection of
 complete information concerning SAEs is extremely important. Thus, follow -up 
inf
ormation that becomes available as the SAE evolves, as well as supporting documentation ( e.g., 
hospital discharge summaries and autopsy reports), should be collected subsequently, if not 
available at the time of the initial report, and immediately sent using the same procedure as the 
initial SAE report.  The original SAE form(s) must be kept on file at the study site. The Sponsor 
will also review SAE reports for missing information and send queries to the site for resolution as appropriate. 
Appropriate diagnostic tests should be performed and therapeutic measures, if indicated, should 
be instituted.  A 
ppropria te consultation and follow -up evaluations should be carried out by the 
Principal Investigator (or designee). An SAE is followed until it is considered resolved, returns to baseline, is chronically ongoing, or is explained by the Principal Investigator.  
7.10 Sponsor Report
 ing of SAEs 
The Sponsor is responsible for reporting serious, study drug- related AEs/ex periences to the 
Competent Authorities of the countries, the concerned IRBs/IECs participating in the clinical trial 
and the study Investigators. The Sponsor  has assigned the drug safety group at INC to act on their 
behalf for safety submissions on this clinical study. 
The Sponsor (or their delegated m edical monitor) wi ll determine whether expedited reporting is 
necessary for SAEs depending on the assessment of seriousness, expectedness, and relationship.

In case of disagreement between the Investigator and the Sponsor’s medical m onitor reNogarrwadiy ng
causal relationship, the mor e conservative a ssessment will determine the r eportability of the c ase. 
The Sponsor, or  their delegated CRO, will prepare Development Safety Update Reports (DSUR) 
and send the DSUR to the European Competent Authority(ies) and the US Authority(ies) where 
the trial is approved within the regulatory timeframe appropriate for the outcome 
of their assessment (see Section 7.10.1 and Section 7.10.2). The assigned CRO will send the 
DSUR to the concerned IRB/IECs. 
7.10.1 Expedited rep orting 
The Sponsor (or delegate) is responsible for the ongoing safety evaluation of the IMP. The assigned 
drug safety group is responsible for ensuring that expedited reports are made to all concerned 
Investigators, to the concerned IRB/IECs (where required), and to the relevant regulatory 
authorities of all adverse drug reactions that are both serious and unexpected, and of findings that 
could adversely affect the health of patients, impact on the conduct of the trial, or alter the 
Competent Authority’s authorization to continue the trial. 
In accordance with the US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21 CFR Part 312.32, the European 
Directive 2001/20/EC, and the ICH Guidelines for Clinical Safety Data Management Definitions 
and Standards for Expedited Reporting, the Sponsor must submit written documentation in the 
form of an Investigational new drug (IND) Safety Report or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reaction (SUSAR) report s, respectively. The Sponsor should submit to the Regulatory Authority 
all safety updates and periodic reports, as required by applicable regulatory requirements. 
The dr ug safety group wil l assign a case num ber to be used in al l future correspondenc e regarding 
the eve nt. 
All events qualifying as IND Safety Reports/SUSARs will be reported to the relevant regulatory 
authorities, IRB/IECs, and Investigators by the drug safety group. IND Safety Reports/SUSARs 
are required to be reported within 7 calendar days for life -threatening events and those resulting in 
death or 15 calendar days for all others. These timeframes begin with the first notification of the 
IND Safety Reports/SUSARs to the drug safety group from the Investigator. 
7.10.2 Non -expedited rep orting 
All SAEs that do not requir e expedite d reporti ng wil l be de scribed in t he interim safety reports.

8 DATA EVALUATION:  CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES  
8.1 Statistical Considerations, Interim Analysis and Sample Size  
The study will employ a k -stage single -arm design, an approach derived from basic statistical 
theory28. For cohort A, i f p denotes the true tumor response rate with drug, the null and alternative 
hypotheses to be assessed in this trial are: H 0: RR=p 0 vs H 1: RR=p 1 (p0 <p 1), with p 0=0.15  and 
p1=0.30.  To test these hypotheses, this trial is a k -stage single -arm design with k =2, being a 
Simon’s 2- stage desig n1. In this design with k =2, there are two analyses: a single interim (Stage 1)  
and a final  (Stage 2)  analysis. At the interim analysis , the response rate is evaluated in a fixed 
number ( m) of patients using a predefined decision rule to determine if the study should stop for 
futility. If the study is not stopped for futility, a further fixed number of patients ( l) are assessed 
for response , and a final analysis is performed on all (m+l ) patients. In both interim and final  
analyses, the response rate will be presented together with the associated exact  90% CI. 
With p 0=0.15 and p 1=0.30, the interim (Stage 1) analysis  will be conducted with m =22 for efficacy 
patients  (EE) . If 3 or fewer responses are observed in these 2 2 patients, the cohort  will be 
terminated in favor  of the null for futility. Otherwise , a further 26 patients may be evaluated, for a 
total of 48 evaluable patients . If a total of 12 or more responses are seen in 48 evaluable patients 
(25%), then the null will have been rejected in favor  of the alternative; otherwise, the null will not 
have been rejected.  
Based on 500,000 trial simulations, this design provides an overall power of 80.1% to test the 
stated null and alternative hypothesis with a 1-sided Type I error rate of 0.049. Under the null , the 
probability of correctly stopping for futility at S tage 1 i s 57.7%.  
For cohort B  and C, if p denotes the true tumor response rate with drug, the null and alternative 
hypotheses to be assessed in the se cohorts  are: H 0: RR=p 0 vs H 1: RR=p 1 (p0 <p 1), with p 0=0.05 
and p 1=0.20. To test these hypotheses, both B  and C cohorts  are the k-stage single -arm design with 
k=2, being a Simon’s 2- stage desig n1. In this design with k =2, there are three a nalyses: an i nterim 
analys is for Stage 1,  an interim analysis for Stage 2 and a final  analysis  (for both Stage 1 and 
Stage  2). A t the interim a nalysis  (Stage 1) , the response rate is evaluated in a fixed number (m ) of 
patients using a predefined decision rule to determine if the study should stop for futility. If the 
study is not stopped for futility, a further fixed number of patients ( l) are assessed for response at 
a second interim analysis (Stage 2). A final analysis is performed on all (m+l) patients at the time 
of study comple tion – see Section 8.6 for details. For both interim analyses and final analysis, the 
response rate will be presented together with the associated exact 90% CI. 
With p 0=0.05 and p 1=0.20, the interim (Stage 1)  analysis  will be conducted with m= 13 for efficacy 
patients  (EE) . If 1 confirmed response is observed before the 13th patient has been followed-up for 
24 w eeks a subgroup of the DRC will meet to confirm continuation to Stage 2. If 0 responses are 
observed in these 13 patients, the cohort  will be terminated in favor of the null for futility. 
Otherwise , a further 16 patients may be evaluated, for a total of 29 evaluable  patients.  Once 
16 (EE) evaluable patients have been enrolled i n Stage 2, an interim (Stage 2; once all pati e nts 
have been treated and/or followed up for at least 12 months) analysis and a final analysis (at the 
time of study completion – see Section 8.6 for details) will be performed. If a total of 4 or more 
responses (either at Stage 2 interim analysis or at final analysis)  are seen in 29 evaluable patients

(13.8%), then the null will have been rejected in favor of the alternative; otherwise , the null will 
not have been reje cted.  
Based on 500,000 trial simulations, this design provides an overall power of 80% to test the stated

8.2 Data
 Review Committee  
8.2.1 Cohort A - 
Sa fety Run -In 
Pembrolizumab has not previously been combined with bemcentinib  in patients (in a ny indication) 
and therefore a safety run -in will include a total of 12 patients. 
A Data Review Committee (DRC), consisting of Principal Investigators, the Sponsors’ (BerGenBio and
 Merck) medical monitors, and invited experts as required e.g., statistician, PK or 
PD specialist, will review all patient safety data after 6 patients have been enrolled and followed up for 6 weeks (2 cycles) and then again after a further  6 patients (total 12 patients) have had the 
potential for 6 weeks follow-up. At each of these safety reviews, the DRC will consider the rate of 
bemcentinib  dose reductions and the rate of permanent discontinuation from bemcentinib  and 
pembrolizumab. 
Each patient will have had the potential to receive (as a minimum): 
• 2 cycles of  pembrolizuma
 b.
• Bemcentinib  at  for 3 days, fol lowed by  daily for ~6 weeks. 
At the 1st safety run -in (based on 6 patients) the DRC will evaluate the need for dose modification 
for individual patients, or bemcentinib  loading or daily  dose modification. A rate of >66% (4 or 
more) of patients requiring treatment to be dose reduced  (bemcentinib ) or permanently 
discontinued (either bemcentinib  or pembrolizumab, or both) will considered as a significant rate.  
The 2nd safety run -in (based on the 12 patients)  the DRC will again  evaluate the need for dose 
modification for individual patients, or bemcentinib  loading or daily  dose modification. A rate of 
>40% (5 or more) of patients requiring treatment to be dose reduced ( bemcentinib ) or permanently
discontinued (either bemcentinib  or pembrolizumab, or both) will considered as a significant  rate.
During the safety run -in reviews, the  DRC will have the option to recommend a lower dose of 
bemcentinib  (dose level -1) for new patients. Dose level -1 is defined as  bemcentinib  on 
Days 1, 2 and 3 followed by  from Day 4 onwards. Additionally, a review of emerging safety data from the whole bemcentinib  program will be
  made 
6 monthly. 8.2.2 Cohort A - End
  of Stage 1 – Efficacy Analysis  
Recruitment for Cohort A will be halted after 22 evaluable p atients have been entered, and whilst 
the interim ( Stage 1 ) analysis is conducted. Recruitment will recommence if the decision is made 
to continue to the maximum of 48 (EE) evaluable patients.

The DRC will meet to review the overall risk / benefit profile of the combination, together with 
the ORR when 22 patients have been  followed up for at least 24 months – and therefore, will have 
data from at least 2 post- treatment tumor assessment scans. The DRC will document the ORR , and 
if it favors the null hypothesis for futility, will recommend if the study should proceed to evaluate up to a further 26 patients.  This recommendation will take into account the statistically  driven 
endpoint, in the context of on- going safety data  review of the combination approach, as well as the 
quality of the response e.g., available data on DoR and PFS, where possible. 
Appropriate representatives of the Sponsor and the coordinating personnel may also attend and minute DRC mee
tings.  Recommendati ons of the DRC will be documented and sent to the sites.

In cohort B aft
er 1 response ha s been confirmed , a subgroup of the DRC will meet to confirm 
continuation to Stage 2 and evaluation of 16 further patients. An  interim analysis  (Stage 1) will be 
conducted after 13 evaluable patients have at least 1 on- treatment scan.  This data will be reviewed 
by the DRC.

analysis, including the management of missing values and the handling of data for patients lost to 
follow- up or missing other important information. The SAP will also outline protocol deviation 
criteria. Any deviations to the planned analyses specified or populations defined within the SAP 
will be justified in writing and presented within the final clinical study report.  It will also describe 
the rules the handling of missing data points for the primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints.  
The SAP will fully describe the efficacy analyses and descriptive summaries that will be undertaken for bot

A single clinical study report (CSR) will be generated. The SAP will be finalized and signed before 
the database lock. An addendum (or addenda) to report SAEs from patients remaining on treatment 
at the time of Last Patient Last Visit (Section 8.6 ) until study closure will be written. 
The main data analyses intended for this trial are briefly described in this section. The SAP will 
provide full details of all planned data analyses for the primary, secondary and exploratory 
objectives of the study. 
8.4 Population 
The efficacy objectives will include all evaluable patients  (EE)  that have received at least one dose 
of bemcentinib and/or pembrolizumab and have measurable disease at entry according to the 
Investigator Site Assessment and who meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria  and have at least 
1 on- treatment scan.  
For all safety obj ectives, t he safety s et, consisting  of all patients (ES) who  have received at l east 
one dose of bemcentinib a nd/or pembrolizuma b, will be used. 
For some objectives (pharmacokinetics and biomarker) a subgroup of patients of the safety set 
with r espective baseline  and p ost-baseline measurements w ill be used.  
Patients who signed a consent form and were screened but did not recei ve any treatment will be 
listed if they reported an adverse event in the time after consent and before treatment allocation 
(see Section 7.1). All AEs that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment 
allocation must be reported if they cause the patient to be excluded from the trial, or are result of 
protocol-s pecific intervention, including but not limited to, washout or discontinuation of usual 
therapy, diet, placebo t reatment or a procedure (Section 7.1 ) 
8.5 RECIST 1.1 and D isease A ssessment  
Efficacy endpoints in this study, including ORR, DoR, and PFS, will all be based on tumor  
assessment  scan  evaluation by RECIST 1.12. 
RECIST assessm ents will be performed usi ng contrast -enhanced CT/MRI assessments of chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis. Additionally, x- ray and bone scans will be used as appropriate. Additional

anatomy should be imaged based on signs and symptoms of individual patients at baseline and 
follow-up. Baseline assessments should be perfo1med no more than 28 days before strut of study 
treatment, and ideally should be perfo1med as close as possible to the sta1t of sh1dy treatment. 
All radiological and non-radiological (e.g., MRI) scans will be reviewed by the local site 
investigator; and if possible, stored electronically (de-identified with the patient's notes) at site. 
A maximum of 5 target lesions, maximum of 2 per organ, must be selected at baseline. All target 
lesions are measurable. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (longest diameter 
for non-nodal lesions or short axis for nodal lesions), but in addition should be those that lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. 
All remaining lesions present at baseline are considered non tai·get, irrespective of whether they 
are measurable. 
Disease assessments will be perfo1med eve1y 9 weeks ±7 days for the first 46 weeks relative to the 
date of first treatment administration and then eve1y 12 weeks ±7 days thereafter until confomed 
objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.12 (iiTespective of the reason for stopping 
treatment or subsequent therapy). 
Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be adequately imaged at follow-up. 
If an unscheduled assessment was perfo1med and the patient has not progressed, eve1y attempt 
should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their scheduled visits. This schedule is 
to be followed in order to ininimize any unintentional bias caused by some patients being assessed 
at a different frequency than other patients. 
Table 20 provides the RECIST 1.12 evaluation and definitions of disease response (based on target 
lesions (TL)): 
Table 20: RECIST 1.1 Evaluation and Definitions of Disease Response 
Complete Disappearance of all TLs since baseline. Any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs 
Response (CR) must have a reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. 
Putial Response At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters ofTLs, taking as reference the baseline 
<PR) sum of diameters 
Stable Disease Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD 
(SD) 
Prngression of At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters ofTLs and an absolute increase of at least 
disease (PD) 5 mm, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is 
the smallest on studv). 
Not Evaluable Only relevant if any of the TLs were not assessed or not evaluable or had a lesion 
(NE) intervention at this visit. Note: if the sum of diameters meets the progressive disease criteria, 
oro!lI'essive disease overrides not evaluable as a TL resoonse 
The objective response must be confomed by a repeat scan perfo1med at least 4 weeks later. 
Details of any new lesions will also be recorded with the date of assessment. The presence of one 
or more new lesions is assessed as progression, however, in the absence of clinical deterioration, 
treatment can continue. The suspected disease progression should be confirmed after 28 days. 
A lesion identified at a follow up assessment in an anatoinical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.

The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: i.e., not attributable to differences in scanning 
technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than 
tumor. 
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumor 
assessments should be continued until the new lesion has been confinned. If repeat scans confinn 
there is a new lesion, then the progression date should be declared using the date of the initial scan. 
Disease progression requires confirmation. The confomato1y scan should occur preferably at the 
next scheduled visit and no earlier than 4 weeks after the initial assessment of progression of 
disease (PD) in the absence of clinical deterioration. 
The overall visit response will be derived using the algorithm shown in Table 21:

8.5.1 Immune-related RECIST and confirmation of progression 
RECIST 1.12 will be adapted to accotmt for the unique tumor response characteristics seen with 
treatment of pembrolizumab. lmmtmotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab may produce 
antitumor effects by potentiating endogenous cancer-specific immtme responses. The response 
patterns seen with such an approach may extend beyond the typical time course of responses seen 
with cytotoxic agents and can manifest a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden 
or even the appearance of new lesions. Standard RECIST may not provide an accurate response 
assessment of immtmotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab. Therefore, RECIST 1.12 will be 
used with the following adaptations: 
If radiologic ( or non-radiological) scan suggests that the patient has progressive disease (initial 
PD), tumor assessment should be repeated 2:4 weeks later in order to confom PD with the option 
of continuing treatment per below while awaiting radiologic confirmation of progression. 
• If repeat scan shows <20% tumor burden compared to nadir, stable or improved
previous new lesion (if identified as cause for initial PD), and stable /improved non­
target disease (if identified as cause for initial PD), treatment may be continued /
resumed.
• If repeat scan confoms PD due to any of the scenarios listed below, patients will be
discontinued from study therapy.

In determining whether the tumor burden has increased or decreased, site study team should 
consider all target lesions as well as non -target lesions. 
Scenarios where PD is confirmed at repeat scan : 
• Tumor burden re
mains ≥ 20% and at least 5 mm absolute increase compared to nadir;
• Non-target dise
as e resulting in initial PD is worse (qualitative);
• New lesion resulting in initial PD is worse (qualitative);
• Additional new
 lesion (s) since las t evaluation.
In patients who have shown  radiological PD , it is at the discretion of the treating physician whether 
to continue a patient on study treatment until a repeat scan  is obtained. When feasible, patients 
should not be discontinued from their study treatment until progression is confirm ed. When 
clinically stable, patients may  continue pembrolizumab  beyond RECIST 1.12 progression with 
continued assessment of response. iRECIST refl ects that some patients can have a transient tumor 
flare after the start of immunotherapy, but with subsequent disease response. Patients that are 
deemed clinically unstable are not required to have repeat scan  for confirmation of progressive 
disease and best medical practice is to be applied . For the purpose of this decision process, lack of 
clinical stability is defined as: 
•Unacceptable toxicity
•Clinical signs
 or symptoms indicating clinically significant disease progression
•Decline in per
formance status
•Rapid disea
se progression or threat to vital organs or critical anatomical sites (e .g., CNS
metastas
is, respiratory failure due t o tumor compression, spinal cord compression)
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention.
8.6 Completion and Closure of the Study  
The study will be
 completed when either: 
•The DRC recommends early termination following the review of the ORR and risk-
benefit at
othe in
terim ( Stage 1 ) analys is of cohort A or
othe interim (Stage 1) analysis of cohort B or
othe interim (
Stage 1)  analysis of  cohort C.
Or 
• Once all  patients have  been followed up for at least 24 months (i.e., LPLV)  (unless the
patients have died or withdrawn from the study due to other reasons before this time) .
At this point, the database lock  will occur and final analyses will be performed (study
completion) and the results will be reported in the final CSR.
At the time of  study completi on there may  be patients continuing on study treatment, any 
remaining patients continuing to show benefit from  the study treatment  will be offered  access to 
bemcen tinib (e.g., under expanded excess program  or roll over study) outside the study, after 
discussion with the sponsor, prior to study closure.

For patients ongoing on the study treatment beyond study closur e, only limited  data will be  
collected . An addendum (or addenda) to the CSR s will be generated to report any outstanding 
safety data.  
Study start is defined by the first patient to enter screening, however, the First Patient In (FPI) is 
when the firs
t patient receives  the first dose of study drug. 
Last Patient In  (LPI) is the la st (EE) eva luable patient enrolled  in the study (C1D1). 
LPLV is defined as the last visit of the last  evaluable pati ent (EE)  enrolled in the study (i.e., 
when all the enrolled  patients have been followed for at least 24 months).  
Study completion is defined by the date of LPLV  and includes a ll data for the final analysis of all 
evaluable patients  (EE) .  
Study closure is defined by st udy completion , when all patients have completed their study visits 
and have been withdrawn from the study and the CSR has been produced (excluding any CSR 
addendum for safety data). 
8.7 Demographic, Medical History, Prior Medication and Other Baseline 
Characteris
tics 
Demographic characteris tics, medical history, prior medication and other baseline data will be

ORR  is defined as the percentage of patients with a CR or PR (out of the number of EE patients ), 
a 90% CI for the overa ll ORR will be calculated assuming an exact binomial distribution.  
A patient who has discontinued both treatments, and subsequently responds having received a 
subsequent anti -ca
ncer treatment may be excluded from the subset of responding patients (these 
patients are evaluable though). Such patients will contribute to the time to progression and death 
Kaplan Meier plots. 
Objective response should be  confirmed by repe at scan after  at least  28 days  (at least 4 weeks 
later) . 
The ORR will further be explored as follows: 
• By PD-L1 status, using a Chi square or Fishers Exact Test;
• By Axl status (+ve or –ve) , using a Chi squar e or Fishers Exact Test; and
• Summarized  in a table of  PD-L1 by Axl expression status to explore the ORR in each
of the four quadrants (++, + -, -+, --). That is, patients will be allocated into one of the
4 groupings: where both Axl and PD -L1 are positive; where there is one positive and
one negative and where there are both Axl and PD-L1 negative.
If the PD -L1 expression status is provided as a TPS or in one of 3 possible categories (<1%, 1 -49% 
and ≥50%), the
 patient will be regarded as PD -L1 positive if their TPS is ≥1%  
A patient with Axl posit ive disease is  defined as one with an expression level of 1+ or greater 
according to IHC staining intensity, although other cut offs may be considered. For each patient, the best percentage change in tumor volume will be illus
 trated in a ‘waterfall’ 
plot. 8.12 Secondary Objectives

8.12.2 Efficacy 
8.12.2.1 Duration of
 re sponse 
The DoR will only be calculated for patients that have an objective response. The duration of 
re
sponse is calculated from the date of the first documented response until the date of progression 
or death ; patients who continue to respond at the date of data cut -off (LPLV ) will be censored 
using the same date used to censor for the PFS time.  Median DoR and respective 95% CIs will be 
presented . 
8.12.2.2 Disease contro l rate  
Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of patients with a PR, CR or with stable disease (out of
 number EE evaluable).  A 95% CI for the DCR will be calculated using an exact 
binomial distribution.  
A Kaplan Meier plot of the duration of response will be presented along with the median duration of response. Des
criptive statistics will be used as required, including 95% CIs. 
8.12.2.3 Progression f ree survival and overall survival 
Kaplan Meier plots of the time to progression and death will be presented, along with the me dian 
progression free survival  (PFS) , median overall survival (mOS), and overall survival  (OS), as well 
as the estimated survival at 12 months. Descriptive statistics will be used as required, including 
95% CI. 
PFS is measured from the da te of the 1st dose of the 1st cycle until the date of progression (the date 
on which the progression is initially observed ) or the date of death (whichever is earlier). 
A sensitivity summary of PFS using the first date that a progression is considered (irr espective of 
whether confirmed) will additionally be conducted. Patients who have not progressed or died 
before the date of data cut -off (last patient, last visit) will be censored at their last clinical 
evaluation .

OS is defined as the time from the date of enrolment tmtil the date of death (from any cause and 
inespective of any subsequent anti-cancer treatment given). Patients who remain known to be alive 
at the date of data cut-off (LPL V) will be censored at their date last known to be alive. The 
estimated stuvival at 12 months will be read from the Kaplan Meier OS curve. Patients who are 
lost to follow-up will be censored at the point last known to be alive; however, if2::2% of patients 
are in this category, a sensitivity sununa1y will be produced to illustrate the overall survival 
assuming the patient died at the date last known in the trial. If possible, the date of death may be

8.12.3 Pharmacokinetics 
The analysis plan for PK assessment for bemcentinib in the study will be pa1t of the SAP. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated for each patient using a fully validated version of 
WinNonlin Pro (Version 6.3 Phoenix™, Pharsight®), or later version as appropriate. The following
parameters will be derived, where appropriate, from the individual plasma concentration versus 
time profiles.

The PD-Ll and Axl expression stah1s will be available at the time of the database lock and will 
be utilized in the final analysis of the sh1dy, as described in Section 8.11. 
However, results from other biomarkers (for example, for the assessment of Axl signaling and 
inhibition) and the development of a radiomic signature as a response prognostic biomarker might 
not be available at the time of the data-cut analysis but are intended to be completed before the 
closure of the sh1dy or before the CSR is 
written at sh1dy completion (whichever is later) -see 
Section 8.6. A separate analysis plan and report (addendum to the CSR) for biomarker analysis 
will be written. All samples will be destroyed 5 years after shldy completion.

9 QUALITY ASSURANCE  
9.1 Data Recording  
The 
Investigator will be responsible for the recording of all data on the CRFs provided, as certified 
by the Investi
gator’s signature and date on the designated pages.  All study data will be collected 
using an eCRF within a fully validated and CFR 21 Part 11- compliant electronic data capture 
system.  All data will be entered into the eCRF by the site staff.  These data will then be source- data 
verified and reviewed by the study monitor (or Clinical Research Associate) before data cleaning 
by Data Management is performed.  All queries will be raised and resolved within the electronic 
data capture system.  During entry, programmatic checking of the data will be performed and  once 
saved into the database, more complex progra mmatic checks will also be performed.  During the 
conduct of the study, all system users will have real -time access to the data.  The level of access to 
the data and study privileges will be determined by their user role.  
After all queries have been resolved , the SAP approve d and signed, and any summary/analysis 
populations approved, the database will be locked and the data released for summary and analysis. All summary and analysis of the data will be performed using SAS
® version 9.3 and/or WinNonLin 
Pro (Ve rsion 6.3 PhoenixTM, Pharsight®), or later . 
9.2 Study Monitoring  
Study monitors w
ill be responsible for the monitoring of the study. 
The study monitor will review the progress of the study on a regular basis to ensure adequate and accurate data colle
ctions.  Monitoring site visits to review the eCRF(s), patient case notes, 
administrative documentation, including the Investigator Site File, and to perform drug accountability will be performed throughout the study at appropriate intervals. 
At each s tudy monitoring visit, the Investigator will make available all re cords perta
 ining to the 
study. To allow sufficient time to assemble documentation for the Study Monitor, monitoring visits 
will be confirmed in advance of planned visits. 9.3 Clinical Study Audi t 
The Sponsor, Spons
or representative, or external regulatory agency may at any time during or after 
completion of the
 study conduct a GCP audit at any trial site. Prior notice will be given to each 
site selected for audit in advance of a planned audit.  
9.4 Clinical Study Report  
The results
 of the study will be presented in an integrated Clinical Study Report according to ICH 
guidelines. 9.5 Dat
a Retention and Availability 
The Investi
gator is required to maintain copies of all essential study documentation, including the 
Site Study File,
 a disc containing all eCRF data (including the full audit trail and all data queries), 
signed informed consent forms, and records for the receipt and disposition of study medications, 
for a specified period required by ICH GCP, or longer if required by local or regulatory authorities.

U.S. Federal laws require that an Investigator maintain all study records for the indication under 
investigation for two years following the date a Product Licensing Application is approved or, if no application is to be filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until two years after the investigation is discontinued and the FDA is notified. 
European laws require that the Investigator maintain all study records (excluding the patie nts’ 
medical file
s) for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the trial, or for at least 
two years after the granting of the last marketing authorization in the European Community (EC) 
and where there are no pending or contemplated marke ting applications in the EC, or for at least 
two years after the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. 
During the study, the Investigator must make study data accessible to the study monitor(s), the 
Sponsor (or a th
ird-party auditor assigned by the Sponsor), and relevant IEC/IRBs and regulatory 
agencies.  The Investigator must ensure the availability of source documents from which the 
information in the eCRF was derived. 
9.6 Curricula Vitae and Financial Disclosure of Inv estigators 
A
ll Principal Investigators will be required to provide a current signed and dated curriculum vitae, 
a completed F
DA Form 1572 (required in the USA; in the EU, if applicable) and a financial 
disclosure statement (required in the USA; in the EU,  if applicable).  Sub- investigators may also 
be required to provide a current curriculum vitae and a financial disclosure statement according to 
the regulations of the countries involved. 
9.7 Protocol Modifications 
No modification of the protocol should be implemented without the prior written approval of the 
Sponsor or the Sponsor’s representative. Any such changes which may affect a patient’s treatment 
or informed consent, especially those increasing potential risks, must receive prior approval by 
the IRB/IEC (Section 10). The exception to this is where modifications are necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to trial patients, or when the change involves only logistical or 
administrative aspects of the trial (e.g., change in monitor, change in telephone number). Other 
administrative revisions which may impact the clinical portion of a study will be duly reported to 
the IRB/IEC by the Principal Investigator.

approval to the relevant IEC/IRBs and to the relevant competent authorities prior to 
implementation.  Exceptions are cases of changes made to protect patient safety, which will be 
implemented immediately.  
If an amendment substantially alters the trial design, increases the potential risk to the patients, affects the tr
eatment of the patient, or might otherwise influence the willingness of the patient to 
participate in the trial, then the information sheet must be revised and submitted to the relevant IEC/IRB and  to the relevant competent authorities, for review and approval. When a patient is 
currently undergoing trial procedures and is affected by the amendment, then the patient must be asked to consent again using the new information sheet. 
10.3 Informed Consent  
The principle
s of informed consent in the Declaration of Helsinki and GCP guidelines will be 
implemented be
fore any protocol- specific procedures or  interventions are carried out.  
All patients will be informed that participation is voluntary and that they can cease their study 
treatment(s
) and/or their further participation to any further study assessments at any time without 
necessarily giving a reas on and without any penalty or loss of benefits to which they are entitled. 
Patients will be provided with a consent form pri or to the commencement of any procedures or 
investigations: 
i. The Consent to participate in the study will include information about the patient’s disease,alternative tr 
eatment options, the study treatments  and their duration, study design and
study assessments and procedures , risks, side effects and potential benefits of

i.Inform ation to explain that on-study blood s amples will be collected for the
purpose of relevant Axl signaling and inhibition biomarkers  and immune profiling
The patient must give consent to participate prior to enrolment in the trial.  This consent mus t be 
given in writing. The Inve stigator who conducts the informed consent discussion must also sign.  
The Investigator may delegate this responsibility to a suitably qualified member of the study team (e.g., Sub- Investigator) if permitted by local regulations.  This delegation of responsi bility must be 
recorded in the Site Study File.  By giving signed consent, the patient will confirm that his or her 
participation is voluntary and that he or she will follow the instructions of the Investigator and answer the questions asked.  Signatures must be personally dated 
The signed and dated consent form (s) will be ke
 pt by the Investigator. Prior to participation in the 
trial, the patient should receive a copy of the signed and dated written informed consent form (s).  
The consent form s must include a ll elements required by law, local regulations, GCP and ICH 
guidelines including consent to allow the Sponsor, Sponsor representative, or external regulatory auditor to review the patient’s medical records.  This gives permission to examine, analyze, verify,

5 Benefits/Risks  of Study Device  and Study Procedures  
 
5.1 Anticipated Clinical Benefits  
 
There might  not be direct  benefits  to the subjects  in this study,  however  participation in a new study  may contribute 
to scientific research information that may be used in the development of new contact lens products.  In addition, 
subjects will receive an examination of the front of their eyes.  
5.2 Anticipated Adverse Device Effects  
 
Ocular complications that may occur during the wearing of contact lenses include discomfort, dryness, aching or 
itching eyes, burning, grittiness, excessive tearing, discharge, hyperemia and variable or blurred vision.  More 
serious risks may include photophobia, iritis, corneal edema or eye infection. Although contact lens -related 
infections  are very infrequent,  the possibility  does  exist. The incidence of infection due to daily-wear  soft lenses  is 
0.035%.1 Almost  always  an infection will occur  only in one eye. This risk is assumed by 35-million  Americans  who 
currently wear contact lenses.  
5.3 Risks  Associated  with Participation in the Clinical Investigation  
 
This is considered a non- significant risk study based on United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
guidelines due to the daily wear nature of the study. The risks associated with the investigational contact lenses have been estimated in accordance with ISO 14971.  A synopsis of risks associated with this device are discussed 
within the Package Insert. Risk controls to reduce the risk as far as possible have been implemented and any residual  risks will be further mitigated  through close evaluation by the investigators  under  this clinical protocol  and 
communicated via informed consent.  
5.4 Risks  of Clinical Procedures to be Utilized in the Study  
 
Routine, non- invasive procedures will be conducted in this study.  Routine clinical procedures include auto- 
refraction,  auto-keratometry,  visual  acuity,  anterior  ocular  health  assessment, and contact  lens fitting  will be used. 
In addition, standard research procedures such as high magnification imaging of the lens fit may be made using 35 mm or digital cameras, in vivo confocal microscopy, and/or specular microscopy.

CV-23-86 Clinical  Investigation  Plan (CIP)  Page 12 of 69 
Feasibility  CIP Template  v1.6:  07-NOV -2022   5.5 Possible Interactions with Concomitant Medical  Treatments  
 
The use of contact lenses can interact with concomitant topical, ocular and/or systemic medical treatments, 
therefore only healthy  subjects  who are not currently  taking concomitant  medical  treatments  will be included in this 
study.  Artificial tears,  re-wetting  drops,  and lubricating agents  are not considered medical  treatments.  Only those 
products approved for the use with contact lenses can be used according to their indication under this protocol.  
5.6 Steps That  will be Taken  to Control or Mitigate the Risks  
 
The following Information for Safety for contact lens wear during the clinical study will be reviewed with each subject:  
Hands should be washed and dried prior to touching the lenses for insertion or removal. If inserting the lenses yourself, they should be checked  for tears  and/or whether they are inside out prior to  insertion.  Eye 
rubbing should be avoided.  Contact  lenses  should  never  be worn  while  swimming  or in any other  hazardous 
environment.  The contact  lenses  are not to be slept  in during  the study  or worn  overnight.  Contact  lens care 
solution will be provided by the Investigator and should be used according to manufacturer instructions.  
 
Additionally, the contact lens should not be used if there is an active ocular inflammation, any eye disease or systemic disease that may affect contact lens wear, or if there is any known allergic reaction to a known ingredient in the lens or lens care solution. 
 
The risks associated with contact  lens wear  are known to increase  with the following  and will be 
communicated to the subject in the safety instruction pamphlet.  
• Overnight  wear/sleeping with lenses  
• Exposure of lenses  or lens case to water  
• Smoking  
• Exposure to aerosols  or noxious  stimuli  
• Unclean hands  for insertion/removal  
• Exposure to water  (such as using water  to rinse  a lens)  
• Swimming  
• Use of lens care solution  with daily disposable lens wear 
• Cosmetic  use 
• Eye rubbing 
• Insertion of an inverted lens 
• Insertion of the wrong  lens into the wrong eye 
• Use of tools  to either  remove  the lens from the blister pack  or to insert  the lens onto the eye 
• Sharing contact  lenses  with others  
• Improper  storage 
• Use of a lens from a damaged blister pack

Feasibility  CIP Template  v1.6:  07-NOV -2022   5.7 Rationale for Benefit-Risk Ratio  
 
The knowledge gained from this study  may lead to important  conclusions  regarding the ocular  response and 
performance  of new contact lens  materials and designs. The  potential risks  for participating in this study are 
minimal, therefore the benefit -risk ratio is acceptable.

Feasibility  CIP Template  v1.6:  07-NOV -2022   24 Any sign and/or  symptom  for which  temporary  lens discontinuation  for > 1 day 
is recommended (if not already classified)  reporting  as per 
requirements  
20 Other  sign and/or  symptom  warranting  classification  as a non-significant 
adverse event  
 
Normal  or adaptive  s ymptoms  
Transient  symptoms  such  as end-of-day dryness,  lens awareness,  itching  or burning or other  discomfort  may occur 
with contact lens wear and may occasionally reduce wearing time. These are not reported as adverse events 
unless in the investigator’s opinion they are unexpected in nature,  severe or have a high rate of occurrence.  
 
This clinical study  will also ascertain satisfaction or preference  with subjective attributes  such as comfort,  vision,  or 
lens handling. Responses to these subjective questionnaires will not be considered as Adverse Events.  
8.2 Adverse Events  Management  
 
Treatment of an adverse event will depend on its nature and severity. Based on the clinical judgment of the investigator the subject may be referred to an ophthalmologist for treatment.  
Expenses incurred for medical treatment as part of study participation will be paid by the Sponsor (bills and prescription receipts kept). The subject must be followed until resolution and an Adverse Event Outcome Form (Appendix 1) completed indicating the course of treatment and resolution of the condition.  
8.3 Reporting Adverse  Events  
 
An Adverse Event Notification Form ( Appendix 1 ) will be completed for each adverse event. Whenever possible, 
the adverse event will be photo -documented.  
All potential Serious and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects that are related or possibly related to subject participation will be reported to the Principal Investigator and the Sponsor within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event. The Principal Investigator will report the event to the IRB per the IRB’s reporting requirements.  All fatal or life threatening events will be reported immediately to the IRB. 
Significant and Non- Significant Adverse Events will be reported to the Sponsor as soon as possible, but no later 
than 5 days after the occurrence.

Feasibility  CIP Template  v1.6:  07-NOV -2022   8.4 Discontinuation from the Study  
 
A subject’s  study  participation may be discontinued at any time if, in the opinion of the Sponsor  or the investigator, 
it is in the best interest of the subject. All discontinuations will be fully documented on the appropriate study  forms 
and a discontinuation/exit form will be completed. 
 
9 Device  Deficiency Reporting  
 
9.1 Product Defect  Reporting (Investigator Responsibility)  
 
Product Defect is the terminology typically used in contact lens products  for an unexpected observation related  to 
the identity, quality, durability, reliability, or usability of the product under investigation.  
NOTE: Observations on study products that are anticipated as a part of the device development process are not 
considered to be Product Defects or Device Deficiencies.  
If the Product Defect  is associated with an adverse event,  the investigator  shall report  the Product  defect  via the 
Adverse Event Notification Form (Appendix 1).  
If the Product Defect  is not associated with an adverse event,  the investigator  shall report  the Product Defect  via 
the Clinical Product Defect Notification Case Report Form (Appendix 2). 
If the investigator judges that the Product Defect could have led to a Serious Adverse Event if no preventative 
action was taken, the Product Defect should be reported to the Sponsor via the Product Defect Notification Case Report Form within 24 hours of becoming aware of the defect. The investigator should report to the IRB per their 
reporting requirements.  
All other Product Defects should be reported to CVI as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days after 
occurrence.  
Sponsor  contact  details  for Product  Defect  Notifications are:

Feasibility  CIP Template  v1.6:  07-NOV -2022   9.2 Device  Deficiency Reporting (Sponsor Responsibility)  
 
Device Deficiency is defined as the inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, 
reliability, usability, safety or performance.  
The Sponsor  will review  the Product  Defect  Notification  Case  Report  Form,  gather  additional information if needed 
from the Investigator and determine whether the notification represents a Device Deficiency. Device Deficiencies will be reported as per Internal CVI procedures.  
A summary of Device Deficiencies will be documented  in the clinical study report. If no Device Deficiencies are 
observed in a study, then a statement stating as such will be included in the clinical study report.  
10 Statistical  Design and Analysis  
 
10.1 Statistical Hypothesis  
 
In this confirmatory  study, the primary statistical  hypothesis is that the logMAR visual acuity performance with the 
Test lens will demonstrate there is no statistical difference comparing to the Control lens over one month of lens wear.  
The null and alternative hypotheses  are: 
H
0: μt = μ c 
H1: μt ≠ μc 
Where  μt refers  to the LogMAR  of Test lenses  and μc refers  to LogMAR  of Control  lenses.  
 
 
10.2 Sample Size Calculations  
 
The number of subjects  that has  been  chosen in  this study  is to provide sufficient evidence  to demonstrate the 
study  hypothesis  of “there  is no difference between  the Test and Control”  versus  “there  is a difference  between 
the Test and Control” on visual acuity (LogMAR) measurement. With assumed standard deviation is equal to 
0.06, a sample size of 24 subjects per group will provide adequate power (92%) to detect a visual acuity 
difference of 0.06 (3 letters) at α=0.05 level.  
 
Therefore, for this parallel arm study design with 2:1 ratio, minimum 72 subjects (48 in test arm and 24 in control arm) to complete is required.  To account  for subject  attrition  of 10%,  up to 79 subjects  will be enrolled in this study.

CV-23-86 Clinical  Investigation  Plan (CIP)  Page 25 of 69 
Feasibility  CIP Template  v1.6:  07-NOV -2022   10.3 Statistical Analysis  
 
Statistical  analysis  will be undertaken by the study  biostatistician.  Data  for all subjects  who have completed the trial 
will be included in the analysis.  
Descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation) and/ or frequency of counts for categorical data may be 
produced for primary  and/or second interests. Paired t- test may be used to compare  slit lamp  biomicroscopy,  lens 
fit and subjective scores between study lens types. Where applicable, Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)  or paired analysis  may be used to compare  the variables  between study  visits.  The critical alpha level for 
statistical significance will be set at p ≤  0.05, with adjustment for multiple comparisons. 
10.4 Interim Analysis  
 
An interim analysis is planned to be completed once 30 subjects have completed all visits or on Dec 18, 2023, whichever comes first.  The Sponsor may stop enrollement for this study if there are obvious signs that the Test 
and Control lenses are not performing similarly.  
10.5 Data Management  
 
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the clinical site Principal  Investigator.  The Principal  Investigator  is responsible  for ensuring  the accuracy, completeness,  legibility, 
and timeliness  of the data reported.  All source documents  should be completed in a neat,  legible  manner  to ensure 
accurate interpretation of data.  
The clinical data for this  study  may be entered  by designated  study  site personnel onto paper and electronic  case 
report  forms  (CRFs).  Case  history  and symptoms questionnaires  may be given  to subjects  to complete in paper  or 
electronic form.  
Unless  otherwise documented,  the CRFs  will be considered the source  document.  
 
The Sponsor or Sponsor’s representatives will be authorized to gain access to the source documentation for the purposes of monitoring and auditing the study.  
If study information is collected using an automated piece of equipment, the information may be  recorded directly 
from the instrument display, captured electronically as output, or printed and entered into the CRF. The CRF will become the source document if there is no printout.

Feasibility  CIP Template  v1.6:  07-NOV -2022   10.6 Data Quality Assurance  
 
The CRFs  will be completed at the time of the visit. All clinical data  generated in the study  will be submitted  to the 
Sponsor for quality assurance review and analysis. All forms will be reviewed for completeness and evident 
recording errors will be rectified by contacting the appropriate clinical site. Computerized editing routines will be used to identify missing, invalid, inconsistent, or questionable data entries for verification prior to data analysis. These data issues will be resolved by contacting the relevant clinical site.  
 
11 General  Study  Management  
 
11.1 Monitoring Plan  
 
The Sponsor  will ensure site qualification  of the investigative  site has been  completed  prior to conducting  the clinical 
study in order to ensure that the site facility is adequate, personnel are qualified and resources are satisfactory.  
The protocol will be reviewed by the Principal Investigators prior to enrollment of the first subject. This will involve an overview  of the protocol, which  includes information  on study  objectives,  inclusion and  exclusion criteria,  study 
visits and adverse event reporting. Data collection  forms will also be reviewed and this will provide an opportunity 
to discuss any questions.  
During the course of the  study, a site visit may be conducted to verify that written informed consent was obtained 
using the IRB approved ICF prior to each subject’s participation in the study.  
Findings of non- compliance shall be reviewed with the Investigator and disclosed in a written monitoring 
report/document. The Monitor will report to the Sponsor any findings of non- compliance with signed agreements, 
conditions imposed by the IRB and the requirements of the study protocol. The Sponsor shall then either secure compliance or discontinue shipments  of the  lenses  to the site and may terminate the Investigator’s  participation in 
the investigation, if required. 
Prior  to final data freeze,  a close- out visit/discussion may be warranted  to check  for accuracy  and completeness  of 
records.  The Sponsor  or Sponsor’s  representatives  will be authorized  to gain access to the source documentation 
for the purposes of monitoring and auditing the study. 
11.2 Amendments  
 
Amendments to this Protocol that may affect the rights, safety, or well -being of subjects will require review and 
approval  from IRB before the changes  are implemented in the study. Investigators  at the site will be provided with 
the revised protocol version, the  site trained  and the Protocol Signature Page of the  amended  protocol completed 
prior to enacting the amendments.

Feasibility  CIP Template  v1.6:  07-NOV -2022   11.3 Protocol Deviations  
 
A Protocol Deviation is an instance of failure to follow, intentionally or unintentionally, the requirements of the 
protocol. Investigators will not deviate from the protocol except to protect the rights, safety and well -being of 
human  subjects  or if otherwise  pre-approved  by the Sponsor  in writing  for non-emergency  circumstances. Under 
emergency  circumstances deviations  may proceed  without  prior approval  of the Sponsor  and the IRB. Deviations 
shall be reported to the Sponsor, IRB and the regulatory bodies, as required.  
Significant deviations which require changes to the research protocol or informed consent process/document or other corrective actions to protect the safety, welfare, or rights of patients or others must be reported to the IRB within  ten business  days  of the deviation occurring  (or its discovery). All deviations  shall be reported  to the Sponsor 
within five working days.  
All deviations that occurred during the study will be documented on a protocol deviation form and documented in the final Clinical Study Report (CSR).  
Sponsor  contact  details  for Protocol  Deviations are:

11.4 Suspension or Premature Termination of the Clinical Investigation  
 
The study  may be suspended or prematurely  terminated if there  is sufficient  reasonable cause.  Written  notification, 
documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by the suspending or terminating party to the Investigator, the Sponsor and the Institutional Review Board (IRB), as appropriate. If the study is 
prematurely  terminated  or suspended,  the Investigator  will promptly  inform  the IRB and will provide the reasons  for 
the termination or suspension.  In terminating the clinical investigation,  CooperVision and the Principal  Investigators 
will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subjects interests.  
Circumstances  that may warrant  termination or suspension include,  but are not limited  to: 
• Determination of unexpected,  significant,  or unacceptable risk to subjects  
• Demonstration of efficacy  that would  warrant  stopping  
• Insufficient  compliance  to protocol  requirements  
• Data  that are not sufficiently  complete and/or  evaluable  
• Determination of futility  
Confidential  
CV-23-86 Clinical  Investigation  Plan (CIP)  Page 28 of 69 
Feasibility  CIP Template  v1.6:  07-NOV -2022   The blinding/masking code may be broken and communicated to the Principal Investigator only in the case of an 
emergency,  such as an Adverse Event  that requires  knowledge of the identity  of the investigational  product  in order 
to manage the subjects' condition.  
The study  may resume  once  concerns  about  safety, protocol  compliance or data quality  are addressed and satisfy 
the Sponsor and IRB.  
Subjects  will continue  to receive  follow- up care until they are able to be exited from the study  (in the case of study 
termination)  or are able to resume  participation in the study  (in the case of temporary  study  suspension),  whereupon 
they will also be followed to exit.  
11.5 Record Retention  
 
Following study completion, data will be available in electronic and/or paper format for audit, Sponsor use, or subsequent analysis.  
Documents will be retained in a manner which allows for timely retrieval. Where documents are maintained in an electronic system, the system will be required to be maintained for the life of the document or the documents migrated to a system allowing for the continued retrieval of the document until the retention period has been completed.  
Access to the Network, eQMS or other electronic storage is secured to minimize potential loss or unauthorized changes. Documents will be stored in a manner to prevent loss and damage. 
Applicable hard copy documents will be secured as appropriate and maintained in a manner to prevent loss or 
damage.  
If hard copy records are retained in an archive store, a log of the content of each pallet and box in the archive 
should be kept in order to enable swift record retrieval. This log should contain the pallet and box owning 
department, record type and date range covered.  
The content of archives should be reviewed periodically. The storage of the records in the archive must be 
appropriate and in good condition to ensure that records inside are not damaged.  
Certain Quality/Regulatory Documented Information is noted as having permanent retention periods due to complex regulatory requirements. Permanent records should be held securely. A fireproof room or safe may be used.  
Permanent records may be considered for destruction. Consideration will be based on a documented request 
forwarded  to the site Quality  Assurance leader,  or a member  of the Global  Quality  Systems  team.  The request  must 
be reviewed and approved by the Sponsor prior to any destruction.

windows with visits as required.  
Section  1.2 Schedule of 
Activities, Table  2 - Aveed  
Section  4.1.5.2  Aveed 
Treatment Arm  Added visit windows of ±3 days to the 
Days 106 and EOS Days 107 visits.  Removed visit window from the 
EOS/ET heading and included the 
windows with visits as applicable.  
Section 1.2 Schedule of 
Activities, Table 1Testim 
and Fortesta  Inserted  footnote ‘c’ indicating that 
testosterone values collected at 
Screening will be used for evaluating 
study inclusion.   To provide clarification that Day -1 
testosterone laboratory values are not 
available or needed for Day 1 eligiblity 
assessments.  
Section 1.2 Schedule of 
Acitivities, Table 2 Aveed  Inserted footnote ‘d’ indicating that 
testosterone values collected at 
Screening will  be used for evaluating 
study inclusion.  To provide clarification that Day -1 
testosterone laboratory values are not 
available or needed for Day 1 eligiblity 
assessments.  
Section 4.1 Overall design 
and Synopsis  Added that 618 subjects will be enrolled 
in 3 treatment groups.  Consistency with modified sample size.  
Section  5.2 Subject 
Exclusion Criter ion, #3 Deleted > 5 years when defining stable 
disease . Removed reference to 
oncologic.  Deletion of  > 5 years applied to clarify 
that stable disease is at the discretion of 
the investigator rather than for > 5 
years.  Removed oncologic since this is 
detailed in exclusion criterion 8b.  
Section 5.2 Subject 
Exclusion Criter ion, #8.b  Clarified the exclusion criteria to 
include cancer or a previous history of 
cancer or relapse of cancer within the 
previous 5 years.  Allows PI to determine appropriateness 
of subject for inclusion in study. The 
Prescribing Information  indicates that 
carcinoma of the prostate and breast are 
contraindicated , not testicular cancer 
and other types of malignancies.  
Section  5.2 Subject 
Exclusion Criter ion, #23 
Section  8.1.6  
Electrocardiogram  Revised QTc to QTcF  Updated QTc to QTcF throughout the 
protocol for consistency with the 
method of calculation described in 
Section  7.1  
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 3 
   Section No. and Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
Section  8.1.1  Serum 
Testosterone Assessment  Removed the paragraph regarding blood 
reserve levels.  Reserve samples will no longer be 
collected. Clarified that testosterone 
samples collected at Screening will be 
used for study inclusion. Testosterone 
samples collected at Day -1 will be used 
as a baseline for the study.  
Section  9.1 Sample Size 
Determination  Sample size was recalculated from 243 
per group (total 729) to 206 per group 
(total 618).  Change in sample size was derived 
from a study or oral testosterone 
decanoate ( White 2021 ), demonstrating 
an increase in systolic blood pressure 
with standard deviation of 11.  
Section  10.1.8 , Source 
Documentation  Modified retention of source 
documentation from 2 years to 3 years.  Align with Endo’s internal policies.  
Section 12, References  Added reference to White 2021 . Used to support the  change in standard 
deviation  from 12 to 11  referenced in  
Section 9.1  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment 3  
The inclusion of testosterone metabolites was removed from the description of laboratory testing. 
The projected date for trial completion was revised to December 2022 based on an anticipated 
enrollment of 50 subjects per month at 25 sites.  
Minor changes throughout the protocol amendment included wording changes for clarity, 
correction of minor typographical errors and revision of abbreviations.  
Major changes are listed below.  
Section No. and Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
Section  1.1 Synopsis, Study 
Period  Date of trial completion revised to 
December 2022  Reflects the delay in trial enrollment 
due to the Covid -19 pandemic.  
Section  7.2 Subject 
Discontinuation/Withdrawal 
from the Study  Removed the phrase ‘except the  
collection of AE information’ from the  
last paragraph.  Removed to reflect that once a subject  
withdraws consent, no further  
procedures  can be done.  
Section  9.3.3  Serum 
Laboratory Testing  The mention of testosterone metabolites 
was removed laboratory testing.  Removed the mention of testosterone 
metabolites to reflect that metabolites 
were not planned to be analyzed as total 
testosterone level is being used to 
assess safety, study drug compliance 
and titration.  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment 2  
Rescreening language has been added to allow the assessments performed in the initial screen to 
be used if no more than 30 days have passed since the assessments were performed and the 
assessments are considered valid. The urine drug screen was removed as subjects were having 
positive urine drug screen results from the components of prescribed medications, (ie, Adderall 
for attention deficit disorder [ADD] showed positive for amphetamine). Exclusion criterion # 21 
was modified for clarity.

recorded.  To clarify when vital signs are to be 
taken in relation to the study drug.  
Section  1.2 Schedule of 
Activities,  Table  1 and 
Table  2  Urine Drug Screen was removed from 
the SOA.  Removed because some subjects had 
positive urine drug screen results from 
the components of prescribed 
medications.

Section  2.1 Study 
Rationale  The following text was added:  
The COVID -19 public health 
emergency has disrupted the conduct of 
clinical research throughout the world. 
At Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Endo), 
ensuring the safety of clinical study 
participants is our primary concern. In Language was developed to clarify how 
the Sponsor will proceed during the 
COVID -19 Public Health Emergency.  
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 5 
   Section No. and Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
addition, the integrity of data obtained 
from clinical trials must be ensured.  
In order to ensure subject safety and 
protect data integrity, Endo, in 
accordance with the FDA Guidance on 
Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical 
Products during COVID -19 Public 
Health Emergency  (March 2020, 
updated 02 July 2020), will allow 
virtual visits for safety assessments. 
During a potential travel 
restriction/lockdown due to COVID -19, 
subjects enrolled in the study may 
experience a delay or cancellation of 
important site visits that could  impact 
serum testosterone levels and delay or 
affect the requi red testosterone 
replacement. To avoid any potential 
delay or disruption in the testosterone 
replacement therapy of those subjects, 
as our commitment toward every 
subject’s well -being, Endo may decide 
to temporarily delay the enrollment of 
the subjects int o any of the arms of the 
protocol.  
In addition, any subjects affected by the 
health emergency will be allowed to 
continue in the study and complete 
remaining assessments when the 
investigational sites re -open as follows:  
• Subjects who started this study prior 
to a COVID -19 interruption will be 
allowed to continue in the study and 
complete all remaining assessments, if 
willing to do so in accordance with the 
scheduling outlined in Section 1.2.  
Section  5.2 Exclusion 
Criteria, Exclusion 
Criterion # 21  Was modified to:  
Has a history of substance abuse or is 
taking any substance of abuse ( Note : 
subjects on a stable dose of any 
medications that have been prescribed 
by a healthcare practitioner  for a 
properly documented medical condition 
are exempt).  Subjects who were taking prescribed 
medication were having positive urine 
drug screen testing given the 
components of these medication, 
(ie, Adderall for ADD showed positive 
for amphetamine).  
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 6 
   Section No. and Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
Section  5.5 Screen Failures  The last paragraph was deleted and 
replaced with:  
A subject who does not meet all of the 
eligibility criteria and is considered a 
screen failure may be rescreened once. 
If a subject rescreens within 30 days of 
their original screening date, 
assessments fro m the initial screening 
period may be used as long as they are 
considered to be valid and within 
protocol entry criteria. Any abnormal 
assessments must be repeated. The 
period from the start of rescreening 
related procedures to the study 
treatment must not  exceed 28 days.  Rescreening language has been added to 
allow the assessments performed in the 
initial screen to be used if no more than 
30 days have passed since the 
assessments were performed and the 
assessments are considered valid.  
Section  8.1 Safety 
Assessments  The following paragraph was added:  
In order to ensure subject safety and 
protect data integrity, Endo, in 
accordance with the FDA Guidance on 
Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical 
Products during COVID -19 Public 
Health Emergency  (March  2020, 
updated 02 July 2020), will allow 
virtual visits for safety assessments. 
During a potential travel 
restriction/lockdown due to COVID -19, 
subjects enrolled in the study may 
experience a delay or cancellation of 
important site visits that could  impact 
serum testosterone l evels and delay or 
affect the required testosterone 
replacement. To avoid any potential 
delay or disruption in the testosterone 
replacement therapy of those subjects, 
as our commitment toward every 
subject’s well -being, Endo may decide 
to temporarily delay  the enrollment of 
the subjects into any of the arms of the 
protocol. In addition, should subjects 
be affected by the health emergency, 
they will be allowed to continue in the 
study and complete remaining 
assessments when the investigational 
sites re -open.  Language was developed to clarify how 
the Sponsor will proceed during the 
COVID -19 Public Health Emergency.  
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 7 
   Section No. and Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
Section  8.1.5  Vital Signs  The highlighted  text was added:  
Subjects receiving the Aveed 
injection will have vital signs taken 
before administration of the study 
drug. For all subjects, vital signs will 
be obtained after the subject has been 
seated for 5  minutes (minimum), with 
feet flat on the floor and back 
supported. Site personnel will ensure 
that the same arm and cuff size will be 
used. Vital signs taken will include 
SBP and DBP, pul se rate, respiratory 
rate, and body temperature. The results, 
date, and time for all vital sign 
assessments will be recorded.  To clarify that vital signs must be taken 
before Aveed injection.  
Section  9.1 Sample Size 
Determination  ABPM Population was changed to Full 
Analysis Set . Changed to clarify Sample Sets  
Section  9.2 Analysis 
Populations  This section was updated to the 
following:  
Four analysis populations will be 
considered in the study: the Safety 
Population, the Intent -to-Treat 
Population (ITT), the Full Analysis Set 
(FAS), and the ABPM Population.  
• Safety Population: will include all 
subjects who receive at least 1 
dose/injection of study treatment. All 
safety analyses will be based on the 
Safety Population.  
• Intent -to-Treat Population: (ITT): will 
include all randomized subjects who 
have at least 1 dose/injection of study 
medication. Sensitivity analysis for 
primary and secondary efficacy 
analysis will be based on this 
population to assess the effect due to 
study discontinuation.  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS): will include 
all ITT subjects with valid baseline and 
EoS ABPM assessments, and. All 
primary and secondary efficacy 
analysis will be based on the ABPM 
Population.  
• ABPM Population: will include all 
FAS subjects with at least 85% 
compliance to treatment during the 
study. All primary and secondary 
efficacy analysis will be based on the 
ABPM Population.  Two analysis sets were added to the 
analysis populations.

Section  9.3.1.3  Sensitivity 
Analysis  This section has been added:  
9.3.1.3. Sensitivity Analysis  
Two types of sensitivity analysis will 
be performed: 1) primary and 
secondary analysis based on ABPM 
population, 2) primary and secondary 
analysis based on ITT population to 
account for missing data due to study 
discontinuation.  Added to clarify sensitivity analysis.  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment 1  
The primary purpose of this amendment was to separate descriptions of treatment with 
testosterone gel (Fortesta/Testim) from descriptions and procedures of treatment with 
testosterone solution for injection (Aveed). This change was to clarify both the sche dule of 
treatment of study drugs and the procedures for each arm of the study. Amendment 1 was 
incorporated into the protocol on 19 March 2020.

A total of approximately 618 hypogonadal males will be enrolled across the 3  treatment arms of this 
study. Subjects currently with controlled hypertension and without hypertension will be enrolled. The 
study will consist of a screening phase, followed by a  24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring 
(ABPM) phase (baseline). After baseline BP has been monitored, subjects will be randomly assigned 
to 1 of 3 treatment arms.  
In order to be eligible to participate in the study, at the Screening Visit and on Study Day 1, subjects 
must:  
1. Be male and ≥ 18 years of age at the time of consent.  
2. Have a diagnosis of primary hypogonadism (congenital or acquired) OR hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism (congenital or acquired).  
3. Have a total serum testosterone  at screening < 300 ng/dL based on 2 blood samples obtained at 
10:00 am (± 2 hours) on 2 separate occasions at least 48 hours apart.  
4. Be naïve to androgen replacement or washout of 12 weeks following intramuscular androgen 
injections; 4 weeks following topical, buccal, nasal, or oral androgens. Washout should be 
completed by Study Day -2. 
5. Have a screening BP at rest of less than 140 mm  Hg for SBP and less than 90 mm  Hg for 
DBP.  
Screening will take place between Day -28 and Day -2. Screening assessments will include (but are not 
limited to) informed consent, serum testosterone levels, physical examination, 12 -lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests . After all assessments are 
completed, each subject’s eligibility will be evaluated. Subjects found eligible will be instructed to 
return to the study center on Day -1 for the activities described in the Schedule of Activities (SoA).  
Blood samples will be collected on Day -1 for baseline serum testosterone assessment (day before 
ABPM). All eligible subjects will come to the study center on Day 1 for ABPM. A 24 -hour ambulatory 
blood pressure recorder machine will be attached to the subj ect’s arm, at bicep level. The machine will 
be set to measure BP every 30 minutes for the next 24 hours. Baseline BP will be analyzed (systolic 
and diastolic means) for the overall 24 hour period, daytime (from waking up to bedtime) and night 
time (from re tiring to bed until waking) for each subject. The 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure 
recorder machine must be returned to the study site by the subject on the following day (Day 2).  
After the 24 -hour ABPM is read and determined to be valid (Day 2), each subject will be randomly 
assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment arms:  
• Testosterone undecanoate injection (AVEED)  
• Testosterone gel (FORTESTA)  
• Testosterone gel (TESTIM)  
Fortesta and Testim subjects will be administered the allotted study drug and start application of the 
study drug on Day 2. Subjects will be instructed not to shower, wash, and/or swim within two hours 
after daily study drug application and will be provide d with instructions to continue applying/ 
administering topically the Fortesta or Testim study drug according to the approved PI. Aveed subjects 
will receive an intramuscular injection on Day 2, Day  30 (±  3 days), and Day 100 (± 3 days). For more 
informati on on study treatments, see the Study Operations Manual.

Fortesta and Testim subjects will be instructed to visit the clinic during the Treatment Follow -up Phase 
on Day 16, Day 37, Day 67, and Day 97 (± 3 days). During each of these visits, serum testosterone 
levels will be taken at the designated times (2 hours  prior to Testim application and 2 hours after 
Fortesta application) followed by instructions for titrating dose accordingly if applicable. For subjects 
on the Fortesta arm, if further titration is required after the Follow -up Visit on Day  37, the investig ator 
should refer to the PI for information on when to schedule subsequent follow up visits. The daily dose 
of the study drug will be titrated for each subject, according to approved dosage and administration 
instructions, until the circulating testosteron e concentrations of the subject reaches normal 
concentrations (300 -1000 ng/dL). The appropriate amount of study drug will be dispensed to subjects 
to last until the next follow -up visit. However, if titration is needed, subjects may need to return to the 
clinic in between scheduled follow -up visits for additional drug supply. If additional visits are required 
during the Treatment Follow -up Phase, they may occur as Unscheduled Visits. Subjects will follow the 
same instructions as previously outlined for any Unscheduled Visits as were followed during the 
Treatment Follow -up Phase.  
Laboratory evaluations should be performed as needed during unscheduled visits. Unscheduled visits 
may occur as necessary for the Aveed subjects.  
Fortesta and Testim subjects will be instructed to visit the study center on Day 113 (± 3 days) for blood 
collection for serum testosterone determination and again on Day 114 to be fitted with the ABPM 
device in addition to the other EoS assessments as des cribed in the Testim and Fortesta SoA. 
A 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recorder machine will be attached to the subject’s arm (using the 
same arm as for baseline), at bicep level. The machine will be set to measure BP every 30 minutes for 
the next 24  hours. The 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure recorder machine must be returned to the 
study site by the subject on the following day (Day  115).  
Aveed subjects will be instructed to visit the study center on Day 30 (± 3 days), and Day 100 
(± 3 days) for intramuscular injections and on Day 106 (± 3 days) for a serum testosterone draw. 
Subjects will return to the study center on Day 107 to be fitted with the ABPM device in addition to 
completing the other assessments as listed in the Aveed SoA. A 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure 
recorder machine will be attached to the subject’s arm (using the same arm as the baseline), at bicep 
level. The machine wi ll be set to measure BP every 30 minutes for the next 24 hours. On Day 108 the 
24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recorder machine must be returned to the study site by the subject.  
If a subject is terminated early, an early termination visit will be scheduled and efforts will be taken to 
collect his 12 -lead ECG, blood samples for clinical laboratory tests (including serum testosterone on 
the day prior to ABPM) and 24 -hour ABPM data. EoS activities/assessments are listed in the SoA.  
Disclosure Statement : This is an open -label 3 treatment -arm study in 3 different marketed 
testosterone treatments.  
Number of Subjects (planned) : Approximately 618 subjects will be enrolled across the 3 treatment 
arms.  
Treatment Groups and Duration : All subjects will receive 1 of 3 testosterone treatments. Each 
treatment will be administered according to the applicable PI.  
Data Monitoring Committee : No monitoring committees will be used for this study.

   2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Study Rationale  
This study will allow for a comparison of the safety profiles of 3 different marketed drugs over 
16 weeks of treatment.  
The COVID -19 public health emergency has disrupted the conduct of clinical research 
throughout the world. At Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Endo), ensuring the safety of clinical study 
participants is our primary concern. In addition, the integrity of data obt ained from clinical trials 
must be ensured.  
In order to ensure subject safety and protect data integrity, Endo, in accordance with the FDA 
Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID -19 Public Health 
Emergency (March 2020, updated 02 July 2020), will allow virtual visits for safety assessments. 
During a potential travel restriction/lockdown due to COVID -19, subjects enrolled in the study 
may experience a delay or cancellation of important site visits that could impact serum 
testosterone levels and delay or affect the requi red testosterone replacement. To avoid any 
potential delay or disruption in the testosterone replacement therapy of those subjects, as our 
commitment toward every subject’s well -being, Endo may decide to temporarily delay the 
enrollment of the subjects int o any of the arms of the protocol.  
In addition, any subjects affected by the health emergency will be allowed to continue in the 
study and complete remaining assessments when the investigational sites re -open as follows:  
• Subjects who started this study prior to a COVID -19 interruption will be allowed to 
continue in the study and complete all remaining assessments, if willing to do so in 
accordance with the scheduling outlined in Section  1.2. 
2.2. Background  
Testosterone is the principal androgen produced by the male testes ( Rommerts, 2004 ). It is 
involved in several developmental and physiological processes, including virilization of the male 
reproductive tract, skeletal muscle development, growth in stature, male pattern hair growth at 
the onset of puberty, spermatogenesis in adults and c ontrol of the gonadotropic functions of the 
pituitary by down -regulating the synthesis of luteinizing hormone (LH). It also plays a major role 
in male sexual behavior.  
Male hypogonadism is the result of inadequate production of testosterone by the Leydig cells of 
the testes ( Odell and Swerdloff, 1978 ). Hypogonadism is reflected by serum concentrations of 
testosterone of < 300  ng/dL, with no discernible diurnal pattern ( Surampudi et al, 2014 ). The 
etiology of hypogonadism may be primary or secondary. Primary hypogonadism is associated 
with dysfunction in the testes. Idiopathic primary testicular failure affects approximately 5% of 
the male population. Secondary hypogonadism is due to inadequa te hormonal stimulation of 
functionally normal testes. The causes may be of hypothalamic or pituitary origin, including 
gonadotropin -releasing hormone deficiencies, isolated follicle -stimulating hormone or LH 
deficiencies, acquired gonadotropin deficiencie s, prolactin secreting tumors, severe systemic 
illness, uremia, and hemochromatosis.  
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 24 
   The treatment of males with primary, and in some cases, secondary hypogonadism includes 
administration of testosterone. Numerous clinical studies have confirmed the efficacy of 
testosterone in the treatment of hypogonadism ( Thirumalai et al, 2017 ). The safety of 
testosterone administration is well established ( Lawrence et al, 2017; Reaven, 1995; Malkin et al, 
2003 ). Clinical studies and literature reports have established the physiological and 
pharmacological effects and safety, even of large doses, of testosterone in both hypogonadal and 
eugonadal men ( Ruige et al, 2001 ).  
Recently, however, there has been growing concern over the use of testosterone therapy and the 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease (Clavell -Hernandez and Wang, 2018 ). In a cohort study 
performed by Loo (Loo et al, 2019 ),evidence suggested that during the first 2 years of 
testosterone treatment, men with low testosterone levels were more likely to experience 
cardiovascular events such as ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and myocardial 
infarction. Other s tudies, however, have found that testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) used 
to return testosterone to normal levels in hypogonadal males may actually have a beneficial 
effect on the cardiovascular system ( Elagizi et al, 2018 ). Given the conflicting nature of this 
evidence, the increasing use of testosterone therapy has necessitated a re -evaluation of the safety 
of testosterone products. One avenue for the evaluation of cardiovascular safety during 
testosterone therapy is ambu latory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in subjects receiving 
testosterone treatment.  
ABPM is used to monitor BP over 24 -hours in order to reveal shifts in BP levels that occur at 
various times during the day. According to the European Society of Hypertension ( O’Brien et al, 
2013 ), some of the benefits of frequent BP measurements during the day include the ability to 
monitor BP during sleep, identification of ‘white -coat’ and masked hypertension, and the 
variation of subject BP during a 24 -hour cycle. Of particular importance, ABPM, using a 
validated device coupled with subject training, allows BP monitoring in the home with 
measurements every 30 minutes, thereby providing a much more  accurate picture of the subject’s 
BP at different time points.  
This study is designed to evaluate the effects of 3 different approved testosterone products on the 
ambulatory BP of hypogonadal males after 16 weeks of therapy.  
2.3. Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Adverse events (AEs) associated with TRT include gynecomastia, fatigue, priapism, weight gain, 
decreased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, increased prostate size, difficulty in 
urination, and erythrocytosis (increased hemoglobin and/or hematocri t). Androgens are 
contraindicated in men with carcinoma of the breast or a history of primary hepatic carcinoma, 
known or suspected carcinoma of the prostate, nephrotic syndrome, hypercalcemia, and must be 
used cautiously in men with prostatic hypertrophy.   
Hypogonadism has been treated with administration of exogenous testosterone since it was 
synthesized some 60 years ago. Testosterone is approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) as replacement therapy in men for conditions associated with a def iciency 
or absence of endogenous testosterone. Testosterone is currently available in oral formulation, 
injectable depot solution, pellet implants, transdermal patches, topical gels, and buccal tablets. 
High dose oral formulations (testosterone esters) giv en for prolonged periods are associated with 
an increased incidence of liver disease, including cancer. Depot solutions are administered 
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 25 
   relatively frequently and are considered painful injections. Another issue associated with the 
depot formulation is the mood swings that are produced as a result of the sustained 
supraphysiologic concentrations of testosterone that occur immediately after injection and lower 
than normal concentrations during the time period (a few days) prior to the next scheduled 
injection. Transdermal patches are often associated with a high incidence of inflammation at the 
site of application and pellet implants can resu lt in rejection and infection. Since marked first 
pass metabolic inactivation of testosterone occurs in the liver after oral administration, 
testosterone esters by intramuscular administration have until recently been the mainstay of 
replacement therapy. H owever, significant amounts of testosterone are absorbed and enter the 
systemic circulation when applied to the skin in an appropriate vehicle. This observation was the 
basis for developing testosterone patches to deliver the hormone to scrotal and non -scrotal skin, 
and most recently by a topical testosterone gel (1%). Testosterone 2% gel is currently approved

4. STUDY DESIGN  
4.1. Overall Design  
This is a Phase 4, open -label, randomized, parallel -group, 3 treatment -arm, multicenter study on 
hypogonadal males to evaluate the effect on 24 -hour ambulatory BP after 16  weeks of 
continuous treatment with marketed testosterone products.  
A total of approximately 618 hypogonadal males will be enrolled across the 3  treatment arms  in 
this study. Subjects currently with and without hypertension will be enrolled. The study will 
consist of a screening phase, followed by a 24 -hour ABPM phase (baseline). After a valid 
24-hour ABPM has been confirmed, subjects will be randomly assigned to 1  of 3 treatment arms.  
4.1.1.  Screening  
Screening will take place on multiple days between Day -28 and Day -2. Informed consent will 
be obtained from all subjects prior to any screening assessments. Screening assessments will 
include (but are not limited to) informed consent, serum testosterone levels, physical 
examination, 12 -lead electrocardiogram  (ECG), vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests. After all 
assessments are completed, each subject’s eligibility will be evaluated. Subjects found eligible 
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 27 
   will be instructed to return to the study center on Day -1 for the activities described in the 
Schedule of Activities (SoA).   
4.1.2.  Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (24 Hour)  
Blood samples will be collected on Day -1 for baseline serum testosterone assessment (day 
before ABPM). All eligible subjects will come to the study center on Day 1 for ABPM. A 
24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recorder machine will be attached to the subj ect’s arm, at 
bicep level. The machine will be set to measure BP every 30 minutes for the next 24 hours. 
Baseline BP will be analyzed (systolic and diastolic means) for the overall 24 hour period, 
daytime (from waking up to bedtime) and night time (from re tiring to bed until waking) for each 
subject. The 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure recorder machine must be returned to the study 
site by the subject on the following day (Day 2).  
In this clinical trial, an FDA cleared ABPM device will be used that meets the latest Association 
for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, European Society of Hypertension standards 
and also will have a British Hypertension Society A/A rating. The s ame brand of ABPM device 
will be used for every subject enrolled into the trial and each subject will use the same device at 
both the Day  1 Visit and as applicable, the EoS or Early Termination visit.  
In order to receive study drug on Day 2, the baseline 24 -hour ABPM reading must be reviewed 
by the investigator (or qualified designee) in real time and considered valid. If a subject does not 
have a valid ABPM session (defined as ≥ 70% of expected measurements including 20 valid 
awake [0900 -2100 h] and 7 valid sleep [0100 -0600 h] measur ements) at baseline or at the end of 
study visit the ABPM session may be repeated once in order to obtain a valid ABPM session.  
4.1.3.  Treatment  
After ABPM is complete (Day 2) and determined by the investigator to be valid, each subject 
will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment arms:  
• Testosterone undecanoate injection (AVEED)  
• Testosterone gel (FORTESTA)  
• Testosterone gel (TESTIM)  
Fortesta and Testim subjects will be administered the allotted study drug and start application of 
the study drug on Day 2. Subjects will be instructed not to shower, wash, and/or swim within two 
hours after daily study drug application and will be provide d with instructions to continue 
applying/administering topically the Fortesta or Testim study drug according to the approved PI. 
Aveed subjects will receive an intramuscular injection on Day 2, Day  30 (±  3 days), and Day 100 
(± 3 days). For more informatio n on study treatments, see the Study Operations Manual and 
Table  3. 
Fortesta and Testim subjects will be instructed to visit the clinic during the Treatment Follow -up 
Phase on Day 16, Day 37, Day 67, and Day 97 (± 3 days). During each of these visits, serum 
testosterone levels will be taken at the designated times (2 hours prior to Testim application and 
2 hours after Fortesta application) followed by instructions for titrating dose accordingly if 
applicable. For subjects on  the Fortesta arm, if further titration is required after the Follow -up 
Visit on Day  37, the investig ator should refer to the PI for information on when subsequent 
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 28 
   follow -up visits should be scheduled. The daily dose of the study drug will be titrated for each 
subject, according to approved dosage and administration instructions, until the circulating 
testosterone concentrations of the subject reaches normal concentrations (300 -1000  ng/dL). The 
appropriate amount of study drug will be dispensed to each subject to last until the next follow -up 
visit. However, if titration is needed, subjects may need to return to the clinic in between 
scheduled follow -up visits for add itional drug supply. If additional visits are required during the 
Treatment Follow -up Phase, they may be occur as Unscheduled Visits. Subjects will follow the 
same instructions as previously outlined for any Unscheduled Visits during the Treatment Follow -
up Phase. The timing of blood sample collection will occur 2 hours prior to Testim treatment and 
2 hours after Fortesta treatment, as described in the respective PIs. The investigator will be 
instructed to customize and schedule the treatment follow -up visi ts (and study drug dispensation) 
of each subject according to the study drug characteristics in order to facilitate proper dose 
titration. Once the daily required dose is fixed, subjects will be instructed to continue the same 
dose until they complete the study (for more information on titration and dose treatment 
scheduling, see the Pharmacy Manual). Unscheduled visits may occur as necessary for the Aveed 
subjects.  
4.1.4.  Interim Evaluation  
Not applicable.  
4.1.5.  Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (End of Study)  
4.1.5.1.  Testim and Fortesta Treatment Arm  
Subjects will be instructed to visit the study center on Day 113 (± 3 days) for a serum 
testosterone assessment, and again on Day 114 (± 3 days) to be fitted with the ABPM device in 
addition to completing the other EoS assessments as listed in the Testim a nd Fortesta SoA. 
Subjects will apply the study drug as usual at home before the Day 114 visit. A 24 -hour 
ambulatory blood pressure recorder machine will be attached to the subject’s arm (using the 
same arm as for baseline), at bicep level. The machine will  be set to measure BP every 
30 minutes for the next 24  hours. On Day 115 the 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure recorder 
machine must be returned to the study site by the subject. If a subject does not have a valid 
ABPM session at the end of study visit, th e ABPM session may be repeated once in order to 
obtain a valid ABPM session.  
4.1.5.2.  Aveed Treatment Arm  
Aveed subjects will be instructed to visit the study center on Day 106 (± 3 days) for a serum 
testosterone draw. Subjects will return to the study center on Day 107 (± 3 days) to be fitted with 
the ABPM device in addition to completing the other assessment s as listed in the Aveed SoA. 
A 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recorder machine will be attached to the subject's arm 
(using the same arm as the baseline), at bicep level. The machine will be set to measure BP every 
30 minutes for the next 24  hours. On Day 108 the 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure recorder 
machine must be returned to the study site by the subject. If a subject does not have a valid 
ABPM session at the end of study visit, the ABPM session may be repeated once in order to 
obtain a valid AB PM session.  
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 29 
   If a subject is terminated early, an early termination visit will be scheduled and efforts will be 
taken to collect his 12 -lead ECG, blood samples for clinical laboratory tests (including serum 
testosterone on the day prior to ABPM) and 24 -hour ABPM data. EoS activities/assessments are 
listed in the SoA.  
4.1.6.  Study Duration  
The duration of the study from first subject first visit to last subject last visit will be dependent 
on the ability of the sites to identify and enroll eligible subjects. The entire study is expected to 
require approximately 2  years to complete.  
4.2. Scientific Rationale for the Study Design  
This is an open -label exploratory study designed to investigate the effect of testosterone 
treatment on BP in hypogonadal men.  
4.3. Justification for Dose  
All treatments in this study are with approved, marketed drugs, using the approved doses found 
in the PI.  
4.4. End-of-Study Definition  
A subject is considered to have completed the study if the subject has completed the 2 -day EoS 
visit.  
The EoS is defined as the completion of the final assessment for the last subject enrolled in the 
trial.

6.2. Study Treatment Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
The investigator or designee will confirm that appropriate temperature control conditions have 
been maintained during transit for all study treatments received and any discrepancies are 
reported and resolved prior to study treatment administration.  
The study treatment will be maintained in a monitored, environmentally controlled (in 
accordance with treatment labeling), secure, locked area with restricted access at the study site in 
compliance with standards of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) for Sc hedule III drugs.  
Only subjects enrolled in the study will receive study treatment and only authorized study staff 
will dispense study treatment.  
In accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) requirements, at all times 
the investigator must be able to account for all study treatment furnished to the study site. An 
accountability record must be maintained for this purpose. The investigator must maintain 
accurate records indicating dates and quantity of study treatment received, to whom it was 
administered (subject -by-subject accounting) and accounts of any study treatment accidentally or 
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 34 
   deliberately destroyed. All unused study treatment not involved in immediate subject treatment 
must be maintained under locked, temperature -controlled storage at the study site. At each visit 
subjects must return all used and unused study drug tubes and ca nisters to the study center.  
Investigators should refer to the Pharmacy Manual for complete information regarding 
preparation, handling, storage, and accountability of study treatment.  
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias  
This is an open label study; however, the specific treatment taken by each subject will be 
assigned using interactive response technology (IRT). Subjects will be randomized to receive 
study treatment in a 1:1:1 ratio.  
6.3.1.  Interactive Response Technology  
The investigator or designee will utilize an IRT system to register subjects at screening. Each 
subject’s unique identification (ID) number will be assigned by the IRT system and will be used 
to identify the subject for the duration of the study within all systems and documentation. If the 
subject is not eligible to receive study treatment, or should discontinue from the study, the 
subject ID number will not be reassigned to another subject. Specific instructions for the use of 
the IRT system will  be included in an IRT User Manual.  
The investigator must maintain a subject master log linking the subject ID to the subject’s name. 
The investigator must follow all applicable privacy laws in order to protect a subject’s privacy 
and confidentiality. Information that could identify a subjec t must be masked on material 
received by the sponsor.  
6.4. Study Treatment Compliance  
Prior to beginning the administration of study treatment, subjects and/or their caregiver will be 
trained on dosing and mode of administration and must exhibit proper technique. Subjects will 
be instructed to bring all used and unused tubes and canisters e ach time they return to the clinic.  
Study drug compliance during each study visit/any period will be calculated via weight and/or 
count of containers to determine treatment compliance. Subjects using too much or too little 
study drug should be re -educated on the proper use of study drug. Rep eated noncompliance (less 
than 85% or greater than 100%) should be evaluated for the need to withdraw the subject.  
Accidental or intentional overdoses should be reported to the sponsor/designee promptly (see 
Section  8.3). 
6.5. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
The start and stop date, dose, unit, frequency, route of administration, and indication for all prior 
(taken within the 30 days prior to the Screening Visit) and concomitant (taken from the 
Screening Visit through the EoS/Early Termination Visit) medicatio ns and nondrug therapies 
(eg, blood transfusions, oxygen supplementation, physical therapy, etc) received will be 
recorded.  
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 35 
   In addition, all prior treatments for the disease/condition under study administered in the 
previous 5 years will be recorded with start and stop date, dose, unit, frequency and route of 
administration.  
6.5.1.  Prohibited Medications and Procedures  
Use of known inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole) or inducers (eg, dexamethasone, phenytoin, rifampin, 
carbamazepine) of CYP3A will be prohibited in this study.  
If any prohibited medication is taken during the study, all pertinent information will be recorded. 
The designated study Medical Monitor must be informed immediately so the sponsor may 
determine whether to continue the subject in the study.  
7. DISCONTINUATION FROM STUDY TREATMENT AND 
SUBJECT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Subjects may be discontinued from the study for the following reasons, if deemed appropriate by 
the sponsor or investigator:  
• Entered the study in violation of this protocol.  
• Safety reasons as judged by the investigator and/or sponsor.  
• Severe non -compliance to the protocol as judged by the investigator and/or sponsor.  
• Required the use of an unacceptable concomitant medication (see Section 6.5). 
• Withdrawal of informed consent; any subject who withdraws consent as a result of an 
AE, regardless of severity or investigator’s opinion, must be reported as a 
discontinuation due to an AE.  
• In the investigator’s opinion, it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue.  
• Sponsor decision.  
Subjects who discontinue or are withdrawn from study treatment for any reason, will be 
encouraged to complete the E arly Termination visit  and evaluations and provide any additional 
follow -up information as required by the study, unless the subject specifically indicates that they 
will not participate in any further evaluations. The date of and reason for study treatment 
discontinuation will  be recorded. Subjects will be encouraged to continue in the study for safety 
and complete all assessments in the SOA f or their respective treatment arm (except for study 
drug administration) and final ABPM measurements.  
If a clinically significant cardiac finding is identified (including but not limited to changes from 
baseline in QT interval corrected using Fridericia’s Formula [QTcF]) after the start of study 
treatment, the investigator or a qualified designee will dete rmine if the subject can continue in 
the study and if any change in management is needed.  
Subjects who discontinue from study treatment at any time after the first dose of study drug will 
not be replaced.  
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 36 
   7.2. Subject Discontinuation/Withdrawal From the Study  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or may be withdrawn at 
any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative 
reasons. The date of and reason for withdrawal will be record ed. 
If the subject withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and 
continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. If a subject withdraws 
from the study, the subject may request destruction of any sample s taken and request the samples 
not be tested. The investigator must document this in the site study records.  
A subject may be discontinued from the study for the following medical or administrative 
reasons:  
• Withdrawal by subject (reason must be specified).  
• An AE.  
• Death.  
• A protocol violation (reason must be specified, for example: lack of compliance, use 
of a prohibited concomitant medication, etc).  
• The subject was lost to follow -up.  
• Other reasons (reason must be specified, for example: the subject moved, investigator 
decision, pregnancy of partner [for subjects using Testim or Fortesta] sponsor 
decision to terminate trial, etc).  
If a subject discontinues from the study, all EoS procedures should be conducted as detailed in 
the SoA. The investigator should request that the subject agree to 24 -hour ABPM measurement. 
The date a subject discontinues and the reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the source 
documentation and electronic case report form (eCRF). If, however, a subject withdraws consent, 
no additional procedures are required. This information should be recorded in the source 
documentation and the eCRF.  
7.3. Lost to Follow -up 
A subject will be considered lost to follow -up if the subject repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
The following actions must be taken if a subject fails to return for a required study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and to ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should contin ue 
in the study.  
• Before a subject is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone calls, and 
if necessary, a certified letter to the subject’s last known mailing address; or lo cal 
equivalent methods). These attempts will be documented.  
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 37 
   • Should the subject continue to be unreachable, the subject will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study.  
Subjects who have been lost to follow -up at any time after the first dose of study drug will not be 
replaced.  
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA ( Table  1 and Table  2). Adherence 
to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required 
for study conduct. Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed.  
Urgent safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or 
awareness to determine if the subject should continue study treatment and/or be withdrawn from 
the study.  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential subjects 
meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all 
subjects screened and to confirm eligibility or record reason s for screen failure, as applicable.  
Procedures conducted as part of the subject’s routine clinical management and obtained before 
signing of the informed consent form (ICF) may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes 
provided the procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and were  performed within the time 
frame defined in the SoA.  
The maximum amount of blood collected from each subject over the duration of the study, 
including extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 100 mL. Repeat or 
unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the  samples.  
8.1. Safety Assessments  
All safety assessments will be performed at the time outlined in the SoA. Additional 
(unscheduled) safety assessments may be performed as needed.  
In order to ensure subject safety and protect data integrity, Endo, in accordance with the FDA 
Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID -19 Public Health 
Emergency  (March 2020, updated 02 July 2020), will allow virtual visits for safety assessments. 
During a potential travel restriction/lockdown due to COVID -19, subjects enrolled in the study 
may experience a delay or cancellation of important site visits that could impact serum 
testosterone levels and delay or affect the requi red testosterone replacement. To avoid any 
potential delay or disruption in the testosterone replacement therapy of those subjects, as our 
commitment toward every subject’s well -being, Endo may decide to temporarily delay the 
enrollment of the subjects int o any of the arms of the protocol. In addition, should subjects be 
affected by the health emergency, they will be allowed to continue in the study and complete 
remaining assessments when the investigational sites re -open.  
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 38 
   8.1.1.  Serum Testosterone Assessment  
Blood samples of approximately 100 mL will be collected in this study for analysis of serum 
testosterone from all subjects participating in the study at the times outlined in the SoA ( Table  1 
and Table  2). During the Screening Period, two blood samples will be obtained for serum 
testosterone, at 10 AM (± 2 hours) on 2 separate occasions spaced at least 48 hours apart (± 1 
hour). Testosterone samples collected during the Screening Period will be used for stud y 
inclusion. Testosterone samples collected at Day -1 will be used as a baseline for the study. The 
date and time of each sample collection will be recorded. Detailed instructions of the collection, 
processing, storage, and shipment of these samples will be provided in a separate laboratory 
manual.  
8.1.2.  Medical and Surgical History  
Medical and surgical history will be obtained during the screening period. Medical history will 
include a review of the following systems: general, dermatological, respiratory, cardiovascular, 
gastrointestinal, genitourinary, endocrine, musculoskeletal, hematological, neuropsychological, 
immune (allergies), and head , eyes, ears, nose, and throat. Historical and current medical 
conditions  will be recorded.  
History of tobacco and alcohol use (never, current, former) will also be collected at screening.  
8.1.3.  Physical Examination  
The complete physical examination will include evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, 
neck (including thyroid), cardiovascular system (including assessment of heart, peripheral 
pulses, presence or absence of edema), genitourinary system, lungs, abdomen (including liver 
and spleen, bowel sounds), lymph nodes, musculoskeletal system (including spine, joints, 
muscles),  neurological system (including cranial nerves, reflexes, sensation, strength), skin, 
extremities, and other conditions of note.  
All examinations will be performed by a physician or health professional listed on the Form 
FDA 1572 and licensed to perform physical examinations. The investigator will review all 
physical exam findings for clinical significance. Any physical exam finding  meeting the 
investigator’s or sponsor’s criteria for clinical significance will be recorded as an AE or serious 
adverse event (SAE) as appropriate.  
8.1.4.  Height and Weight  
Height will be collected at screening only. Weight will be collected as outlined in the SoA. Any 
change from the Screening Visit in subject weight that is considered by the investigator to be 
clinically significant will be recorded as an AE (or SAE, if app ropriate).  
8.1.5.  Vital Signs  
Subjects receiving the Aveed injection will have vital signs taken before administration of the 
study drug. For all subjects, vital signs will be obtained after the subject has been seated for 
5 minutes (minimum), with feet flat on the floor and back suppo rted. Site personnel will ensure 
that the same arm and cuff size will be used. Vital signs taken will include SBP and DBP, pulse 
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 39 
   rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature. The results, date, and time for all vital sign 
assessments will be recorded.  
The investigator will review all vital sign values for clinical significance. Any vital sign value 
meeting the investigator’s or sponsor’s criteria for clinical significance will be recorded as an AE 
(or SAE, if appropriate).  
8.1.6.  Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG recording will be conducted at the times indicated on the SoA. The subject 
should be in a supine position for at least 5 minutes before the recording is conducted. Lead 
position will be that of a standard 12 -lead ECG; no additional or special  lead placements will be 
necessary. The ECG recording should include a minimum of 5 heart cycles (beats).  
If the ECG report shows QT prolongation with QTcF ≥ 450 ms, the investigator should repeat 
the ECG within 1 hour. If the initial findings are confirmed, the investigator should exclude the 
subject from study participation.  
The investigator will review all other ECG results for clinical significance. Any ECG result 
meeting the investigator’s criteria for clinical significance will be recorded as an AE (or SAE, if 
appropriate).  
8.1.7.  Clinical Laboratory Determinations  
Clinical laboratory tests will be conducted according to the SoA. Required clinical laboratory 
tests are outlined in Section 10.2. Clinical laboratory tests will be performed by a designated 
central laboratory. The study sites will be provided with instructions on specimen collection, 
preparation, packaging and transport. The results of the tests will be returned to the 
investigational sites.  
Samples for laboratory testing may be collected under fasted or nonfasted conditions. Fasting 
early morning samples are preferred, but a random daytime sample is acceptable. The date and 
time of the sample collection must be documented on the laboratory re port. The investigator 
must review and sign laboratory reports and document the clinical significance of each 
laboratory abnormality. New clinically significant laboratory abnormalities or clinically 
significant changes in laboratory values will be reporte d as AEs (or SAEs, if appropriate).  
Clinical laboratory test data will be reviewed by the investigator, or designee, and additional 
clinical laboratory tests may be ordered at his/her discretion (eg, if the results of any clinical 
laboratory test falls outside the reference range or clinical  symptoms necessitate additional 
testing to ensure safety). Any additional testing will be performed by the designated central 
laboratory or local laboratory if needed to ensure subject safety.  
8.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The definitions of AEs and SAEs can be found in Section 10.3. 
All AEs, including both observed or volunteered problems, complaints, signs or symptoms must 
be recorded, regardless of whether associated with the use of study treatment. This would include 
AEs resulting from concurrent illness, reactions to concurrent me dication use, or progression of 
disease states (excluding the disease under study). A condition present at baseline that worsens 
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 40 
   after initiation of study treatment will be captured as an AE; the onset date will be the date the 
event worsened. The AE should be recorded in standard medical terminology when possible.  
8.2.1.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse 
Event Information  
All SAEs and AEs will be collected by the investigator from the time the ICF is signed through 
the Day 115 EoS visit (Testim and Fortesta) and Day 108 (Aveed); or for 28 days after the last 
dose of study treatment for those who terminate early; this will i nclude any AEs that are ongoing 
at the time of study completion/termination. All ongoing AEs must be followed until resolution 
or for 28 days after the subject’s last study treatment, whichever comes first.  
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in Section  10.3. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 
24 hours of it being available.  
The investigator is not obligated to actively seek AEs and SAEs after conclusion of subject study 
participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including death, at any time after 
the subject has been discharged from the study, the investig ator must promptly notify the sponsor 
to comply with postmarketing reporting requirements for marketed products being used for 
approved indications.  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and submitting SAE reports are provided in Section  10.3. 
8.2.2.  Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and SAEs. Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE 
occurrences.  
At each visit, subjects will be queried regarding any AEs that have occurred since the last visit. 
Subjects will be asked to volunteer information concerning AEs with a nonleading question such 
as, “How do you feel?” Study site personnel will then record a ll pertinent information. The study 
drug compliance record should also be reviewed to detect potential intentional or unintentional 
overdoses.  
8.2.3.  Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each subject at 
subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and nonserious AEs will be followed to resolution, 
stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is l ost to follow -up. Further 
information on follow -up procedures is provided in Section  10.3. 
8.2.4.  Secondary Exposure to Testim and Fortesta  
The FDA has mandated that secondary exposure data be collected on anyone exposed to Testim 
and Fortesta.  
Investigators should explain to all subjects that there is the potential to transfer testosterone to 
another individual when vigorous skin -to-skin contact is made with the application site. 
Investigators should ask every subject about any possible secondar y exposure of other 
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 41 
   individuals due to the potential transfer. All such known secondary exposure must be reported to 
the sponsor within 24 -hours on the Endo Serious Adverse Event (SAE)/Reportable Event form. 
AEs/SAEs that occur due to potential secondary exposure must be proc essed within the same 
SAE reporting timelines as those described in Section  10.3. 
8.2.5.  Pregnancy  
All pregnancies that occur in the partner of a treated participant that are identified during or after 
this study, where the estimated date of conception is determined to have occurred during study 
treatment or within 28 days of the last study treatment need to be reported, followed to 
conclusion, and the outcome reported, even if the participant is discontinued from the study. The 
investigator should report (as outlined above) all pregnancies within 24 hours using the 
Pregnanc y Form. Monitoring of the preg nancy should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy 
and follow -up information detailing the progress and outcome should be submitted on 1 or more 
Pregnancy Form(s) detailing progress, and a Two -Month Follow -up Pregnancy Report Form 
detailing the status of the infant should be submitted.  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that the investigational 
product under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. 
Likewise, elective abortions without complications are not considered  AEs. Any SAEs 
associated with pregnancy (eg, congenital abnormalities/birth defects, or any other serious 
events) must additionally be reported as such using the Serious Adverse Event (SAE)/Reportable 
Event Form (see Section  10.3). Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as 
SAEs.  
8.3. Treatment Overdose  
Study treatment overdose is any accidental or intentional use of treatment in an amount higher 
than the dose indicated by the protocol for that subject. Study treatment compliance should be 
reviewed to detect potential instances of overdose (intentional or  accidental).  
Any treatment overdose during the study should be noted on the study drug eCRF.  
An overdose is not an AE per  se, however all AEs associated with an overdose should both be 
entered on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported using the procedures detailed in Section  10.3, 
even if the events do not meet seriousness criteria. If the AE associated with an overdose does 
not meet seriousness criteria, it must still be reported using the Endo Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE)/Reportable Event Form and in an expedited manner, but should be noted as nonserious on 
the form and the Adverse Event eCRF.

9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND METHODS  
This section provides a general summary of the statistical methods to be used in analyzing study 
data. A more detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed and finalized prior to the 
database lock.  
9.1. Sample Size Determination  
The objective of this study is to determine whether the study drugs have a clinically meaningful 
effect on ambulatory BP in hypogonadal men. The primary endpoint will be the mean change 
from baseline to EoS in 24 -hour average SBP.  
A sample size of 144 for each of the 3 treatment groups ( Aveed, Fortesta, and Testim) achieves 
90% statistical power to exclude an upper bound of 3 -mm Hg threshold SBP increase in 24 -hour 
average systolic ambulatory BP at EoS from baseline using 2 -sided 95% CI with paired t test. 
The SD of 11 mm  Hg is assumed.  
It is assumed that 30% of enrolled subjects will be excluded from the Full Analysis Set 
(ie, subjects who discontinue early from the study, non -valid ABPM measures at baseline or 
EoS, etc), therefore a sample size of 206 for each of the 3 treatment groups  is required.  
9.2. Analysis Populations  
Four analysis populations will be considered in the study: the Safety Population, the Intent -to-
Treat Population (ITT), the Full Analysis Set (FAS), and the ABPM Population.  
• Safety Population: will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose/injection of 
study treatment. All safety analyses will be based on the Safety Population.  
• Intent -to-Treat Population (ITT): will include all randomized subjects who have at 
least 1 dose/injection of study medication. Sensitivity analysis for primary and 
secondary efficacy analysis will be based on this population to assess the effect due to 
study discontinuation.  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS): will include all ITT subjects with valid baseline and EoS 
ABPM assessments. All primary and secondary efficacy analysis will be based on the 
ABPM Population.  
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 43 
   • ABPM Population: will include all FAS subjects with at least 85% compliance to 
treatment during the study. All primary and secondary efficacy analysis will be based 
on the ABPM Population.  
9.3. Statistical Analyses  
9.3.1.  Efficacy Analysis  
9.3.1.1.  Primary Analysis  
The primary endpoint will be the mean change from baseline to EoS in 24 -hour average systolic 
ambulatory BP for each treatment group. This endpoint will be analyzed using an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline and study center, or pooled ce nters (if applicable), 
included as covariates. The mean estimate, and the corresponding 95% 2 -sided confidence 
intervals (CIs) of the estimate, will be provided for each treatment group. If the upper limit of the 
2-sided 95% CI falls below 3.0  mm Hg, it wi ll be concluded that the tested treatment does not 
have statistical significance in increasing of 24 -hour systolic ambulatory BP.  
The mean of hourly systolic ambulatory BP at baseline and EoS will be graphically presented for 
each treatment group. The cumulative distribution function plots will also be plotted for the 
means of the daytime, nighttime, and 24 -hour systolic ambulatory B P at baseline and EoS.  
Descriptive analysis for the changes from baseline at each time point and 24 -hour average for all 
ABPM parameters will be presented for each treatment group.  
The ABPM Population across treatment groups will be further divided into the following 
3 groups: subjects without hypertension, with hypertension untreated, and with hypertension 
treated. In addition, subgroups such as African Americans and the elderly wil l be examined. A 
similar analysis described in the primary analysis will be applied to these subgroups.  
The descriptive statistics, ie, the number and percentage of subjects meeting the following BP 
thresholds will be provided: ≥ 160 mm  Hg SBP, ≥ 100 mm  Hg DBP, ≥ 20 mm  Hg increase from 
baseline SBP and ≥ 15 mm  Hg increase from baseline DBP.  
9.3.1.2.  Secondary Analysis  
All secondary analysis will be summarized by treatment group using appropriate descriptive 
statistics.  
9.3.1.3.  Sensitivity Analysis  
Two type of sensitivity analysis will be performed: 1) primary and secondary analysis based on 
ABPM population, 2) primary and secondary analysis based on ITT population to account for 
missing data due to study discontinuation.  
9.3.2.  Safety Analyses  
Assessment of safety will be based on the incidence of AEs, AEs resulting in discontinuation, 
SAEs, laboratory parameters and vital signs. AE summaries will be provided showing the 
number and percentage of subjects who experienced at least 1 AE. Laboratory  data and their 
change from baseline will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Shift tables to summarize 
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 44 
   change from baseline to post baseline visits will also be presented (eg, normal to high, normal to 
low). Vital signs data and any changes from baseline will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics.  
9.3.2.1.  Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) by 
preferred term within system organ class. The number of AEs and the number of subjects 
reporting AEs will be listed and summarized descriptively by body system, preferred term, 
severity, and causality for each treatment group. Only treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) (events that are new in onset or aggravated in severity following treatment) will be 
included in all summaries. SAEs (including death) will be summarized .  
9.3.3.  Serum Laboratory Testing  
Serum testosterone levels will be summarized by treatment group and time point using 
appropriate descriptive statistics. For more information see the SAP.  
9.4. Interim Analysis  
Not applicable.

   10. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1. Appendix 1: Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight 
Considerations  
10.1.1.  Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
This clinical study is designed to comply with the ICH Guidance on General Considerations for 
Clinical Trials (62 FR 6611, December 17, 1997), Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of 
Human Clinical Trials for Pharmaceuticals (62 FR 62922, November 25, 1997), Good Clinical 
Practice: Consolidated Guidance (62 FR 25692, May 9, 1997) and 21 CFR parts 50, 54, 56 and 
312. 
The study will be conducted in full compliance with ICH E6, the FDA guidelines for good 
clinical practice (GCP) and in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origins in the 
Declaration of Helsinki defined in 21 CFR, 312.120.  
Approval by the IRB/IEC prior to the start of the study will be the responsibility of the 
investigator. A copy of approval documentation will be supplied to Endo along with a roster of 
IRB/IEC members that demonstrates appropriate composition or other docu mentation of 
assurance of appropriate composition per local and national regulations (eg, a Department of 
Health and Human Services Assurance Number will satisfy this requirement for IRBs in the 
United States).  
The study protocol, the ICF, advertisements, materials being provided to subjects, and 
amendments (if any) will be approved to IRB/IECs at each study center in conformance with 
ICH E6, CFR Title 21 Part 56, and any other applicable local laws. The investig ator is 
responsible for supplying the IRB/IEC with a copy of the current Investigator’s Brochure, 
Package Insert, or Summary of Product Characteristics, as well as any updates issued during the 
study. During the course of the study, the investigator will p rovide timely and accurate reports to 
the IRB/IEC on the progress of the study, at intervals not exceeding 1 year (or as appropriate), 
and will notify the IRB/IEC of SAEs or other significant safety findings, per the policy of the 
IRB/IEC. At the conclusio n of the study, the investigator will submit a final report or close out 
report to the IRB/IEC and provide a copy to Endo.  
Any amendment to this protocol will be provided to the investigator in writing by Endo. No 
protocol amendment may be implemented (with the exceptions noted below) before it has been 
approved by the IRB/IEC and the signature page, signed by the investigator , has been received 
by Endo. Where the protocol is amended to eliminate or reduce the risk to the subject, the 
amendment may be implemented before IRB/IEC review and approval. However, the IRB/IEC 
must be informed in writing of such an amendment and approv al obtained within reasonable time 
limits. Deviating from the protocol is permitted only if absolutely necessary for the safety or 
clinical management of the subject, and must be immediately reported to Endo.  
The investigator will be responsible for supplying updated safety and/or study information to 
study subjects as it becomes available.  
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 46 
   10.1.2.  Financial Disclosure  
The investigator and subinvestigators will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial 
information as requested to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial 
certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities. The investigator is 
responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for 
1 year after the completion of the study.  
10.1.3.  Informed Consent Process  
The ICF must be approved by the sponsor and the IRB/IEC before any subject provides consent. 
The investigator will provide the sponsor with a copy of the IRB/IEC -approved ICF and a copy 
of the IRB/IEC’s written approval before the start of the study.  
The ICF must contain all applicable elements of informed consent and the mandatory statements 
as defined by national and local regulations, including confidentiality.  
If appropriate, the ICF will contain a separate section that addresses the use of remaining 
mandatory samples for optional exploratory research. The investigator or authorized designee 
will explain to each subject the objectives of the exploratory research . Subjects will be told that 
they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any time and for any 
reason during the storage period. A separate signature will be required to document a subject’s 
agreement to allow any remaining spec imens to be used for exploratory research. Subjects who 
decline to participate in this optional research will not provide this separate signature.  
At the Screening Visit (and at other time as may be required by the study or when changes are 
made to the consent form), subjects will read the consent form(s) and any privacy authorization 
as required by local and national regulations (such as the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act [HIPAA] authorization form), after being given an explanation of the study. 
Before signing the consent form(s) and the privacy authorization form (if applicable), subjects 
will have an opportunity to ask questio ns about the study and discuss the contents of these forms 
with study site personnel. The consent/assent process shall be recorded in source documents.  
Subjects must assent understanding of and voluntarily sign these forms in compliance with ICH 
GCP and all applicable national and international regulations, before participating in any 
study -related procedures. Subjects will be made aware that they may wit hdraw from the study at 
any time for any reason.  
All versions of each subject’s signed ICF must be kept on file by the site for possible inspection 
by regulatory authorities and the sponsor. Signed copies of the consent form(s) and the privacy 
authorization form, if applicable, will be given to the subje ct.  
The subjects will be made aware of their right to see and copy their records related to the study 
for as long as the investigator has possession of this information. If the subject withdraws 
consent and/or HIPAA authorization, the investigator can no longe r disclose health information, 
unless it is needed to preserve the scientific integrity of the study.  
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 47 
   10.1.4.  Data Protection  
Study subjects will be assigned a unique identifier by the sponsor or designee. Any subject 
records or datasets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; subject 
names or any information which would make the subject identifiable  will not be transferred.  
The subject must be informed that his personal study -related data will be used by the sponsor in 
accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure (in accordance with local 
and/or national law) must also be explained to the subject.  
The subject must be informed that his medical records may be examined by Clinical Quality 
Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the sponsor, by appropriate 
IRB/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities.  
10.1.5.  Committee Structure  
No monitoring committees will be used for this study.  
10.1.6.  Dissemination of Clinical Study Data  
Aggregate results data will be provided to the sites that actively enrolled subjects into this study 
after the clinical study report is finalized.  
Study results and de -identified individual subject data will be released as required by local and/or 
national regulation.  
10.1.7.  Data Quality Assurance  
Steps to assure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified investigators 
and appropriate study centers, review of protocol procedures with the investigators and 
associated personnel prior to start of the study, and periodic monitoring visits conducted by the 
sponsor or sponsor representative. Significant and/or repeated noncompliance will be 
investigated and remedial action instituted when appropriate. Failure to comply with remedial 
actions may result in investigator site termination and regulatory authority n otification.  
The sponsor or its designee will utilize qualified monitors to review and evaluate activities 
conducted at investigator sites.  
The data will be entered into the clinical study database in a timely fashion and will be verified 
for accuracy, following procedures defined by the sponsor (or designee). Data will be processed 
and analyzed following procedures defined by the sponsor (or designee).  
The study will be monitored and/or audited at intervals to ensure that the clinical study is 
conducted and data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the 
study protocol, ICH E6 consolidated guidelines, and other applicable r egulations. The extent, 
nature, and frequency of monitoring and/or audits will be based on such considerations as the 
study objectives and/or endpoints, the purpose of the study, study design complexity, and 
enrollment rate. At the conclusion of a program,  a compliance statement will be generated by the 
sponsor (or designee) listing all audit activities performed during the clinical study.  
All data recordings and source documentation (including electronic health records) must be made 
available to the sponsor (or designee), FDA and any other regulatory agencies that request access 
to study records for inspection and copying, in keeping with n ational and local regulations.  
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 48 
   The investigator shall permit audits and inspections by the sponsor, its representatives, and 
members of regulatory agencies. The investigator should immediately notify the sponsor of an 
upcoming FDA or other regulatory agency inspection.  
10.1.8.  Source Documents  
All subject information recorded in the eCRF will be attributable to source data from the 
investigational site unless otherwise outlined in this protocol.  
Source documents include but are not limited to original documents, data, and records such as 
hospital/medical records (including electronic health records), clinic charts, lab results, subject 
diaries, data recorded in automated instruments, microfilm or magnetic media, and pharmacy 
records, etc. At a minimum, all data required to be collected by the protocol should have 
supporting source documentation for entries in the eCRF, unless the protocol specifies that data 
can be recorded directly on/in the eCRF or other device.  
The investigator shall retain and preserve 1 copy of all data collected or databases generated in 
the course of the study, specifically including but not limited to those defined by GCP as 
essential. Essential documents should be retained until at least 3 years after the last approval of a

Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting  
10.3.1.  Definitions  
An AE is any unfavorable or unintended change in body structure (signs), body function 
(symptoms), laboratory result (eg, chemistry, ECG, X -ray, etc), or worsening of a preexisting 
condition associated temporally with the use of the study medication whethe r or not considered 
related to the study medication. AEs will be captured once a subject has signed the informed 
consent. AEs include:  
• Changes in the general condition of the subject.  
• Subjective symptoms offered by or elicited from the subject.  
• Objective signs observed by the investigator or other study personnel.  
• All concurrent diseases that occur after the start of the study, including any change in 
severity or frequency of preexisting disease.  
• All clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities or physical findings that occur during 
the study.  
A TEAE is any condition that was not present prior to treatment with study medication but 
appeared following treatment, was present at treatment initiation but worsened during treatment, 
or was present at treatment initiation but resolved and then reappeared while the individual was 
on treatm ent (regardless of the intensity of the AE when the treatment was initiated).  
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 50 
   An SAE is defined as an AE that:  
• Results in death.  
• Is immediately life -threatening (there is an immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred; this does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more serious form may 
have caused death).  
• Results in or prolongs an inpatient hospitalization (Note: a hospitalization for elective 
or preplanned surgery, procedure, or drug therapy does not constitute an SAE).  
• Results in permanent or substantial disability (permanent or substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in offspring of a subject using the study 
medication regardless of time to diagnosis).  
• Is considered an important medical event.  
Important medical events are defined as events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes. Examples of important medical events inc lude allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
10.3.2.  Relationship to Study Drug  
The degree of “relatedness” of the AE to the study medication must be described using the 
following scale:  
• Not related  indicates that the AE is definitely not related to the study medication.  
• Unlikely related  indicates that there are other, more likely causes and study 
medication is not suspected as a cause.  
• Possibly related indicates that a direct cause and effect relationship between study 
medication and the AE has not been demonstrated, but there is evidence to suggest 
there is a reasonable possibility that the event was caused by the study medication.  
• Probably related  indicates that there is evidence suggesting a direct cause and effect 
relationship between the AE and the study medication.  
It is the sponsor’s policy to consider “probably related” and “possibly related” causality 
assessments as positive causality. “Not related” and “unlikely related” causality assessments are 
considered as negative causality.  
Assessments will be recorded on the eCRF and must indicate clearly the relationship being 
assessed. For example, an AE that appears during a placebo run -in phase would be assessed with 
respect to the placebo treatment received and/or study procedures condu cted during this phase. If 
the AE continued into an active treatment phase, the relationship would be assessed for the active 
treatment phase only if the AE worsened.  
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 51 
   10.3.3.  Intensity Assessment  
The intensity (or severity) of AEs is characterized as mild, moderate, or severe:  
• Mild  AEs are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and do not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate  AEs introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and 
may interfere with daily activities, but are usually ameliorated by simple therapeutic 
measures.  
• Severe  AEs interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and typically require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment.  
10.3.4.  Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
10.3.4.1.  Reporting Adverse Events  
Throughout the study, AEs will be documented on the source document and on the appropriate 
page of the eCRF whether or not considered treatment -related. This includes any new signs, 
symptoms, injury, or illness, including increased severity of previously e xisting signs, symptoms, 
injury, or illness. Conditions existing prior to screening will be recorded as part of the subject’s 
medical history. The investigator is responsible for assessing the relationship of AEs to the study 
medication; relationship will be classified as not related, unlikely related, possibly related, or 
probably related.  
All AEs will be collected by the investigator from the time of signing the ICF through the 
Day 115 EoS Visit (Testim and Fortesta) and Day 108 (Aveed); or for 28 days after the last dose 
of study treatment in those subjects who terminate early. All ongoing  AEs must be followed until 
resolution or for 28  days after the last dose of study treatment, whichever comes first.  
10.3.4.2.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAE, including death resulting from any cause, which occurs to any subject participating in 
this study must be reported via email or fax by the investigator using the Endo Serious Adverse 
Event (SAE)/Reportable Event Form within 24 hours of first becom ing aware of the SAE. SAEs 
will be collected by the investigator from the time of signing the ICF through the Day 115 EoS 
visit (Testim and Fortesta) and Day 108 (Aveed); or for 28  days after the last dose of study 
medication in those subjects who terminat e early. SAEs that occur within 28 days, following 
cessation of the study treatment, or within 28 days, following premature discontinuation from the 
study for any reason, must also be reported within the same timeframe. If the investigator learns 
of any SA E, including death, at any time after the subject has been discharged from the study, 
the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor to comply with postmarketing reporting 
requirements for marketed products being used for approved indications. Follow -up information 
collected for any initial report of an SAE must also be reported to the sponsor within 24  hours of 
receipt by the investigator.  
All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization of condition, or until follow -up is no 
longer possible.  
All SAEs should be reported via email (safety@endo.com) or fax (610 -968-7135).  
EN3000 -101 Protocol Amendment 4  
28 February 2022  Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 52 
   The sponsor will determine whether the SAE must be reported within 7 or 15 days to regulatory 
authorities in compliance with local and regional law. If so, the sponsor (or the sponsor’s 
representative) will report the event to the appropriate regulatory au thorities. The investigator 
will report SAEs to the IRB/IEC per their IRB/IEC policy.  
10.3.4.3.  Follow -up Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
To fully understand the nature of any SAE, obtaining follow -up information is important. 
Whenever possible, relevant medical records such as discharge summaries, medical 
consultations, and the like should be obtained. In the event of death, regardless of c ause, all 
attempts should be made to obtain the death certificate and any autopsy report. These records 
should be reviewed in detail, and the investigator should comment on any event, lab abnormality, 
or any other finding, noting whether it should be consi dered a serious or non -serious AE, or 
whether it should be considered as part of the subject’s history. In addition, all events or other 
findings determined to be SAEs should be identified on the Endo Serious Adverse Event (SAE)/ 
Reportable Event Form and the investigator should consider whether the event is related or not 
related to study drug. All events determined to be nonserious should be reported on the eCRF.

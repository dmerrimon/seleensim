Confidential       Page 6 of 74  To evaluate the efficacy and safety of niraparib in all patients with prior PARP treatment.  
 To evaluate QTc in a subset of niraparib -treated ovarian cancer patients  
 To assess population pharmacokinetics (PK) and estimate PK parameters for niraparib and 
its major metabolite  
 To explore potential biomarkers related to ovarian cancer and poly(ADP -ribose) 
polymerase (PARP) inhibition (e.g. DNA repair pathways)  
Methodology:  
This study is a multicenter (United States and Canada), open -label, single -arm, Phase 2 study 
evaluating the safety and efficacy  of niraparib in patients with advanced, relapsed, HRD -positive (as 
identified with a centralized HRD test), high -grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or 
primary peritoneal cancer who were previously treated with chemotherapy and experienced a 
response lasting at least 6 months to first -line platinum -based therapy. Patients must have received 3 
or 4 previous chemotherapy regimens.  
In order to determine eligibility, a tumor sample will be sent to a centralized laboratory for t BRCAmut 
and HRD tes ting. Archival or fresh tissue is required in order to enroll in the study. The sample may 
be sent for testing in advance of the protocol -defined screening period in order to facilitate the 
screening and enrollment process. Patients must wait for the resul ts from the on -study centralized 
HRD testing prior to receiving first dose. If g BRCAmut is previously detected, then it is not required to 
wait for tumor HRD test results prior to enrollment; however, archival tumor samples still need to be 
collected for c entral HRD testing and exploratory biomarker analyses. Patients may be eligible for 
enrollment if they have an HRD -positive tumor.  
Blood samples also will be collected for all patients during screening for determination of g BRCAmut 
status. If HRD status is known, then it is not necessary to wait for g BRCAmut testing results for 
enrollment into the study. However, a blood sample still needs to be collected for central g BRCAmut 
testing.  
In order to evaluate exploratory tumor biomarke r changes, an optional fresh biopsy may be done at 
screening and at the end of treatment (EOT) visit.  
Niraparib 300 mg will be administered orally once daily continuously beginning on Day 1 and every 
cycle (28  days) thereafter until the patient discontinu es study treatment. Three capsules of 100 -mg 
strength will be taken at each dose administration. Dose interruption (no longer than 28 days) and 
dose reductions to 2 capsules daily (200 mg), and subsequently to 1 capsule daily (100 mg), will be 
allowed (no further dose reductions will be allowed). Dose interruption and/or reduction may be 
implemented at any time for any grade toxicity considered intolerable by the patient. The timing of 
efficacy or safety evaluations should not be affected by dose interrupti ons or reductions. Patients will 
continue on study medication until disease progression as long as in the investigator’s opinion they 
are benefiting from treatment and do not meet any other discontinuation criteria.  
As of 9 February 2016, the PK QTc sub -study had reached the enrollment target of 12 patients and is 
now closed to enrollment.  
Blood samples will be collected for all patients during screening for the exploratory evaluation of 
circulating biomarkers.  
Niraparib  
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020-C Amendment 5 
Confidential       Page 7 of 74 Clinic visits will be weekly during Cycle 1 an d then every 4 weeks (±3 days) for subsequent cycles. 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; v.1.1) tumor assessment via computed 
tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen/pelvis and clinically indicated areas is 
required every 8 weeks (±7 days) from Cycle 1/Day 1 for 6 months and then every 12 weeks (±7 
days) until progression. Copies of scans will be collected for future central evaluation if needed. 
Cycle timing will not be delayed for treatment interruptions, and tumor asses sment should occur 
according to this schedule regardless of whether study treatment is interrupted.  All adverse events 
(AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected and recorded for each patient from the day 
of signing the informed consent form  until the EOT visit. New SAEs (including deaths) will be 
collected for 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. AESI and SAEs assessed as related to 
study treatment will be reported through the study and post -treatment assessments. All AEs and SAEs  
experienced by a patient, irrespective of the suspected causality, will be monitored until the AE or 
SAE has resolved, any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or normalized, until there 
is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observ ed, until the patient is lost to follow -up, or until the 
patient has died.  
The Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) for this study are myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and secondary cancers (new malignancies other than MDS/AML, 
pneumonitis, and embryo -fetal toxicity. AESIs must be reported to the Sponsor soon as the 
Investigator becomes aware of them.  
The study will be conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practice.  
Number of Patients (Planned):  Approximately 500 patients will be enrolled in the study .  
Main Criteria for Inclusion:  
To be considered eligible to participate in the study, the patient must meet the following main 
inclusion criteria and all other inclusion criteria:  
 Patients must agree to undergo tumor  HRD testing and blood g BRCAmut status testing. 
a. This test result must show that patients have an HRD -positive tumor (see 
Appendix F), defined by the presence of a deleterious or suspected deleterious breast 
cancer gene (BRCA) mutation or be positive for genomic instability.  
      Note:  The study HRD test result must be received prior to study enrollment. The tumor 
sample may be submitted for HRD testi ng prior to the screening period if it appears the 
patient is likely to meet other eligibility requirements. To facilitate early testing, a 
separate informed consent form (ICF) specific for HRD testing will be available to be 
signed prior to testing.  
b. If historic blood gBRCAmut is detected by a central g BRCAmut testing, then tumor 
HRD sample test results are not required prior to enrollment; however, HRD testing 
still needs to be performed.  
Note: If gBRCAmut status is known by a local test, then a fresh sam ple must be submitted 
for centralized gBRCAmut testing. Local gBRCAmut results are not acceptable for 
enrollment. Only patients with centralized g BRCAmut and/or HRD-positive samples can be 
enrolled in this study.  
 Patients must have completed 3 or 4 previou s chemotherapy regimens (eg, gemcitabine, 
doxorubicin, topotecan, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, cisplatin, bevacizumab, or PARP inhibitors 
as single agents or in combination per standard of care).  
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020 -C Amendment 5  
Confidential       Page 8 of 74 a. Patients must have completed their last chemotherapy regimen >  4 weeks prior to 
treatment initiation.  
 Patients must have measurable disease according to RECIST (v.1.1).  
Main Criteria for Exclusion:  
To be considered eligible to participate in the study, the patient must not meet any of the following 
main exclusion criteria or any other exclusion criteria:  
 Patients must not have any known, persistent (> 4 weeks), ≥Grade 3 hematologic toxicity 
during the last cancer therapy.  
 Patients must not have any known, persistent (>4 weeks), ≥Grade 3 fatigue during the last 
cancer therapy.  
 Patients must not have received pelvic radiotherapy as treatment for primary or recurrent 
disease within 1 year of the first dose of study treatment.  
 Patients must not have symptomatic uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases. (To be 
considered “controlled,” central nervous system [CNS] disease must have undergone 
treatment [eg, radiation or surgery at least 1 month prior to study entry]. The patient must 
have no new or progressive signs or symptoms related to the CNS disease and must be  taking 
a stable dose of steroids [as long as these were started at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment] or 
no steroids.) A scan to confirm the absence of brain metastases is not required. Patients with 
spinal cord compression may be considered if they have received definitive treatment for this 
and demonstrate evidence of clinically stable disease for 28 days.  
 Patients must not be considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical 
disorder, nonmalignant systemic disease or active, uncontro lled infection. Examples include, 
but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 90 days) myocardial 
infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior 
vena cava syndrome, small bowel ob struction or other serious gastrointestinal disorder, or any 
psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent.  
 Patients must not have received a transfusion (platelets or red blood cells) within 4 weeks of 
the first dose of study treatment.  
 Patients must not have known history or current diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome 
(MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), or second primary malignancy other than MDS or 
AML.  
Investigational Product, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
Niraparib 300 mg (3  x 100 -mg niraparib capsules) will be administered orally once daily 
continuously. Patients will be instructed to take their dose at the same time of the day, preferably in 
the morning. Patients must swallow and not chew all capsules. The consumption of wa ter and food is 
permissible. The first dose will be administered at the site.  
Duration of Treatment:   Approximately 24 weeks. Patients who are benefitting from treatment will 
have access to study treatment as long as considered acceptable by their treatin g physician or until 
they are discontinued from study treatment or from the study.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Primary Endpoint:  
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020 -C Amendment 5  
Confidential       Page 9 of 74  Investigator -assessed confirmed ORR per RECIST v1.1 in the HRD -positive patients who 
have received 3 or 4 prior lines of anti -cancer therapy and are platinum -sensitive to the last 
platinum -based therapy. Patients with prior PARP inhibitor treatment are exc luded.  
Key Secondary Endpoints:  
 Investigator -assessed confirmed ORR per RECIST v1.1 in all patients who have received 3 or

excluded.  
 Investigator -assessed confirmed ORR per RECIST v1.1 in all patients treated in the study.  
The primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested sequentially to control t he overall 
Type I error rate at 1 -sided 0.025 level.  
 Other Secondary Endpoints:  
 DOR, DCR, PFS, TFST and OS in patient groups included in the primary and key secondary 
endpoints.  
 ORR, DOR, DCR, PFS, TFST and OS in patients who have received 3 or 4 prior l ines of anti -

therapy, in cluding HRD subgroup analysis and platinum -sensitivity (sensitive vs. resistant) 
subgroup analysis. Patients with prior PARP treatment are excluded.  
Safety:  
 Safety of niraparib will be evaluated throughout the trial, including assessment of 
treatment -emer gent AEs, clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, chemistry), vital signs, 
physical examination, and use of concomitant medications  
A subset of approximately 12 patients will undergo intensive, triplicate ECG monitoring to coincide 
with PK evaluation on Cycle1/Day 1  
Pharmacokinetics:  
 Evaluation of the PK of niraparib and its major metabolite; parameters of interest include area 
under the curve (AUC), minimum observed plasma concentration (C min), maximum observed 
plasma concentration (C max), time to maximum concentration (t max), and/or AUC at steady -
state (AUC ss), C min,ss, Cmax,ss, and, if the data allow, oral clearance (CL/F) and oral volume of 
distribution (Vz/F)

Confidential       Page 10 of 74  Efficacy and safety of niraparib in p atients with prior PARP treatm ent. 
Statistical Methods:  
General Analysis Considerations:  
Efficacy analysis will be performed on the following populations:  
 Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population, defined as all dosed patients with measurable disease at 
baseline  
 Response -Evaluable Population, all ITT patients with at least one evaluable post -baseline 
tumor scan  
 PP population, consisting of all patients in the ITT Population enrolled in the study who do 
not have protocol deviations that may significantly impact the interpretation of efficacy 
results.    
Safety analysis will be performed on the Safety Population, defined as all patients who received at 
least 1 dose of study drug.  
All analyses will include summary statistics, including number and percentage for categorical 
variables an d number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for 
continuous variables. Time -to-event analyses will be performed using Kaplan -Meier methods. The 2 -
sided 95% CIs will be provided as appropriate. Exploratory biomarkers may be e valuated with 
efficacy and safety variables.  
All AEs will be listed and tabulated. Physical examination findings, vital signs, and clinical 
laboratory results will be listed and summarized using descriptive statistics; shift tables will be 
presented as app ropriate.  
The PK/PDy relationship between concentrations of niraparib and its major metabolite and efficacy 
and safety measures will be investigated. The exposure to niraparib and its major metabolite will be 
correlated with safety (selected AEs) and effic acy variables.  
Descriptive statistics and categorical analyses of ECG variables will be provided for the subset of 
patients (approximately 12) with intensive ECG collection. A population PK analysis plan will be 
written to describe the analyses of ECG vari ables and PK parameters.  
Sample Size:  
The study protocol initially allowed enrollment of all patients with at least 3 prior lines of anti -cancer 
therapy. In the subsequent protocol amendments, the study enrollment was adjusted to allow only 
HRD -positive pa tients with 3 or 4 prior lines of anti -cancer therapy. This adjustment was made in 
consideration of the evolving role of PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer treatment based on external 
data.  Overall, approximately 500 patients are expected in the study. The  study enrollment is also 
expected to include a minimum number of t BRCAmut patients (≥50) and HRD -positive patients 
(≥150).   
For the primary efficacy endpoint of ORR in HRD -positive patients who have received 3 or 4 prior 
lines of anti -cancer therapy and are platinum -sensitive to the last platinum -based therapy, an 
alternative hypothesis of ORR ≥30% is considered against a null hypothesis of ORR ≤10%.  
For the key secondary efficacy endpoints of ORR tested in broader subgroups to include platinum -
resistant  patients and/or HRD -negative/unknown patients, an alternative hypothesis of ORR ≥25% is 
considered against a null hypothesis of ORR ≤10%.  
The rationale of choosing the null and alternative hypothesis for the primary and the key secondary 
efficacy endpoint s is based on data external from this study. These clinical trials of PARP inhibitors 
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020 -C Amendment 5  
Confidential       Page 11 of 74 (e.g. niraparib, olaparib, and rucaparib) suggest that platinum -sensitivity and/or HRD -positivity 
(including BRCA mutant) play a role in how patients with ovarian cancer respond to treatment. There 
is limited data for the overall HRD -positive population in ovarian cancer treatment. In a rucaparib 
study that included patients who are LOH -positive (another assay evaluating tumor homologous 
recombination deficiency), ORR in t he non -tBRCA /LOH -positive patients with at least 2 prior lines of 
therapy was 17%.1 A recent publication of platinum -sensitive patients with at least 1 prior line of 
therapy presented an ORR of 29% in the non -tBRCA /LOH -positive group.2 Therefore, choice of the 
hypotheses of Ho: ORR ≤10% vs. Ha: ORR ≥30% for the primary efficacy and Ho: ORR ≤10% vs. 
Ha: ORR ≥25% fo r the key secondary analyses would be appropriate for testing the efficacy of 
niraparib treatment in the specified populations.  
It is estimated that 45 patients would provide 90% power for testing the primary efficacy analyses. 
Statistical power for vario us sample sizes are presented below to provide guidance for the key 
secondary hypotheses when tested individually (regardless of sequential testing). The power is 
calculated by assuming the exact binomial distribution using East® software Version 6.4.

As of August 2017, approximately 450 patients were dosed in the study. Approximately 320 patients 
had 3 or 4 prior lines of anti -cancer therapy (~150 HRD positive). Based on a preliminary calculation 
of the platinum -sensitivity to the last platinum -based t herapy, the number of enrolled patients for the 
primary endpoint and the key secondary efficacy endpoints are considered adequate to ensure 
sufficient power for the planned analysis.

1.1. Background:  Poly(ADP -ribose) Polymerase and Homologous 
Recombination Deficiency  
Poly(ADP -ribose)  polymerases (PARP) -1 and -2 are zinc -finger deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA) -binding enzymes that play a crucial role in DNA repair. Upon formation of DNA breaks, 
PARP binds at the end of broken DNA strands, a process that activates its enzymatic activity. 
Activated PARP catalyzes addition of long polymers of ADP -ribose onto PARP and several 
other proteins associated with chromatin, including histones and various DNA repair proteins. 
This results in chromatin relaxation, fast recruitment of DNA repair proteins,  and efficient repair 
of DNA breaks. In this manner, PARP plays a key role in sensing DNA damage and converting 
it into intracellular signals that activate the base excision repair (BER) and single -strand break 
repair pathways.  
Normal cells repair up to 10 ,000 DNA defects daily, and single -strand breaks are the most 
common form of DNA damage. Cells that are unable to repair this burden of DNA damage, such 
as those with defects in the homologous recombination or BER pathways, are at risk for 
accumulating mul tiple lesions that will ultimately trigger apoptosis. They enter the S (DNA 
replication) phase of the cell cycle with unrepaired single - and double -strand breaks. Pre -existing 
single -strand breaks are converted to double -strand breaks as the replication ma chinery passes. 
Accumulated double -strand breaks present during S phase are repaired by homologous 
recombination. Homologous recombination is the preferred repair pathway because it is 
associated with a much lower error rate than other forms of repair. Cel ls unable to perform DNA 
repair via homologous recombination (eg, due to inactivation of genes required for homologous 
recombination, such as breast cancer gene [ BRCA ] 1 or BRCA 2) are at risk for accumulating 
multiple lesions that will ultimately trigger a poptosis. These cells accumulate stalled replication 
forks during S  phase and are more likely to use the error -prone nonhomologous end -joining 
(NHEJ) or alternative ( alt)-NHEJ pathways to repair double -strand breaks in DNA. 
Accumulation of errors in DNA by  NHEJ contributes to mutations that promote the development 
of cancer. Over time, the buildup of excessive DNA errors in combination with the inability to 
complete S phase (because of stalled replication forks) contributes to cell death.  
Treatment with PAR P inhibitors could represent a novel opportunity to selectively kill a subset 
of cancer cells with deficiencies in DNA repair pathways. For example, a tumor arising in a 
patient with a germline BRCA  mutation (g BRCAmut) has a defective homologous recombinat ion 
DNA repair pathway and would be increasingly dependent on NHEJ, alt -NHEJ, and BER for 
maintenance of genomic integrity. PARP inhibitors block alt -NHEJ and BER, forcing tumors 
with BRCA  deficiencies to use the error -prone NHEJ to fix double -strand break s. Non -BRCA  
deficiencies in homologous recombination DNA repair genes could also enhance tumor cell 
sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. The rationale for anticancer activity in a subset of non -gBRCAmut 
tumors is that they share distinctive DNA repair defects w ith gBRCAmut carriers, a phenomenon 
broadly described as “ BRCA ness.”3 DNA repair defects can be caused by germline or somatic 
alterations to the homologous recombina tion DNA repair pathway. In a recent analysis of 
approximately 500 high -grade serous ovarian adenocarcinoma tumors, approximately 50% 
contained homologous recombination defects.4 A subset of these tumors had biologically 
plausible molecular alterations that may make them sensitive to PARP inhibition by nira parib.  
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020 -C Amendment 5  
Confidential       Page 20 of 74 Defects in the homologous recombination pathway might result in specific structural changes in 
DNA. Previously, chromosomal copy number (CN) changes have been reported to be associated 
with BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 mutations.5,6 Recent evidence, however, indicates that evaluation of the 
patterns of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) may 
be more robust than CN changes alone. LOH results in the irreversible lo ss of one of the parental 
alleles. In contrast, CN gains are not necessarily permanent. Therefore, if HRD leaves a footprint 
of genomic alterations, LOH and CN variants may provide a more stable record of those changes 
compared with CN variants alone. In a  recent study, the patterns of genome -wide LOH were 
analyzed in 3 different epithelial ovarian cancer data sets extensively characterized for BRCA 1 
and BRCA 2 defects by evaluating HRD status.7 The HRD analysis is a DNA -based assay that is 
capable o f detecting HRD independent of its etiology based on genome -wide single nucleotide 
polymorphism data. An HRD -(LOH) score was developed, which is strongly associated with 
functional defects in BRCA 1 and BRCA 2. This score also strongly correlated with promot er 
methylation of RAD51C, a gene implicated in the homologous recombination pathway. 
Additional DNA -based algorithms of HRD have been developed based on whole genome tumor 
telomeric allelic imbalance, HRD -(TAI),8 and large -scale state transitions, HRD -(LST).9 In a 
recent study, all 3 HRD algorithms were independently associated with BRCA 1/2 deficiency and 
response to cisplatin treatment in triple -negative breast cancer.10 The arithmetic mean of the 3 
HRD algorith ms was significantly associated with BRCA 1/2 status in a breast all -comers cohort 
and with cisplatin response in a second independent triple -negative breast cancer cohort. The 
final clinical HRD score results from the sum of HRD -LOH, HRD -TAI, and HRD -LST s cores 
and is a single value along a continuous scale from 0 to 100. Analysis of more than 1,000 breast 
and ovarian cancer tumor samples has identified 2 distinct HRD populations, HRD -negative and 
HRD -positive, with 95% of all g BRCAmut tumors with concomita nt LOH at the BRCA  gene in the 
sample classified as HRD -positive.  
Clinical studies have shown that PARP inhibitors are active for recurrent ovarian cancer.11-17 
Clinical anticancer activity has been observed in patients with and without g BRCAmut and in 
patients who are platinum -sensitive and platinum -resista nt. PARP inhibition appears to be most 
active in patients with g BRCAmut platinum -sensitive disease.11,13,15 Additionally, maintenance 
therapy in patients with relapsed, platinum -sensitive ovarian cancer appears promisi ng.16 Of 
patients with a BRCA  mutation, median progression -free survival (PFS) was significantly longer 
in the PARP inhibitor group than in the placebo group (11. 2 months vs. 4.3  months; hazard ratio: 
0.18; p < 0.0001). Similar findings were noted for patients with wild -type BRCA , although the 
difference between groups was smaller (7.4 months vs. 5.5  months; hazard ratio: 0.54; 
p = 0.007). Patient -reported outcomes , including Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – 
Ovarian Symptom Index, did not show a significant difference between the placebo and 
treatment groups, suggesting that maintenance treatment did not decrease functioning or quality 
of life in these pati ents. Patient -reported outcome data beyond progression was not captured, and 
therefore quality of life effects related to subsequent chemotherapy treatments (likely to occur 
sooner in the placebo group) could not be used to assess the benefit of extending PFS on patient -
reported outcomes for patients treated with a PARP inhibitor vs. placebo.

Niraparib is a potent, orally active PARP -1 and -2 inhibitor being developed as an agent for 
tumors with defects in the homologous recombination D NA repair pathway or that are driven by 
PARP-mediated transcription factors.  
Nonclinical data on niraparib in ovarian cancer are discussed in detail in the Investigator’s 
Brochure and described briefly in Section  1.2.1. 
Niraparib clinical data are discussed in detail in the niraparib Investigator’s Brochure and 
described briefly in Section  1.2.2. 
1.2.1. Nonclinical Experience  
In preclinical models, niraparib has been observed to inhibit normal DNA repair mechanisms and 
induce synthetic lethality when administered to cells with homologous re combination defects. In 
a BRCA1-mutant xenograft study, niraparib dosed orally caused tumor regression, which was 
mirrored by >90% reduction in tumor weight compared with the control; in a BRCA2-mutant 
xenograft study, niraparib -dosed mice showed 55% to 60 % growth inhibition, both by tumor 
volume and weight.  
Utilizing patient-derived ovarian xenografts (PDX), niraparib previously demonstrated response 
in both BRCA mutation and BRCA wild-type tumors.18 To better illustrate the anti -tumor effects 
of niraparib in ovarian PDX models,  samples from a collection of high -grade ovarian tumors 
were subjected to HRD analysis to determine the frequency of BRCA mutation and BRCA 
hypermethylation. Single nucleotide polymorphism data were analyzed using all 3 algorithms 
(loss of heterozygosity [LOH], tumor te lomeric allelic imbalance [TAI], and large -scale state 
transitions [LST]). The final HRD score was the sum of the LOH+TAI+LST scores with 
numerical outputs ranging from 0 to 100. Collectively, there was 25% BRCA deficiency in this 
primary tumor collection,  consistent with previous studies in high -grade ovarian cancer.4 Using a 
threshold of 50% tumor growth inhibition as a guide,  in vivo response to niraparib monotherapy 
was observed in 46% of ovarian cancer PDX modes . The response rate to niraparib in BRCA 
wild type, HRD negative models was 36%. The respons e rate in HRD positive models was 52%. 
The response rate to niraparib in BRCAmut models was 80%. These findings are consistent with 
the NOVA clinical study where a PFS benefit was observed in all patient subgroups.  
1.2.2. Clinical Experience  
Clinical safety data  are available for a total of 144 patients who received niraparib as part of 
5 Phase 1 studies conducted to date.  
The common expected drug -related adverse events (AEs) for niraparib have been reported as: 
fatigue, nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, decrease d appetite, neutropenia, vomiting, 
constipation, leukopenia, diarrhea, insomnia, dyspnea, electrocardiogram (ECG) QT prolonged, 
headache, stomatitis, hyponatremia, and alopecia. The majority of these events were effectively 
managed by dose interruption and /or reduction. AEs resulted in treatment discontinuation in 
approximately 15% of patients.  
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and second primary 
malignancies other than MDS/AML have been observed in patients receiving treatment with 
olaparib, rucaparib, and niraparib; given the common mechanism of action among these PARP 
Niraparib  
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020-C Amendment 5 
Confidential       Page 22 of 74 inhibitors, MDS, AML, and second primary malignancies other than MDS/AML therefore 
represent a potential risk to patients receiving niraparib. Guidance on monito ring patients for 
new events of MDS/AML, and second primary malignancies other than MDS/AML and the 
follow-up of patients with these suspected events is provided in Section  6.2.6 and Section 7. 
Currently, there are 5 ongoing Phase 3 niraparib studies. A short description of the relevant 
monotherapy studies (Study PR -30-5010-C [BRAVO] and Study PR -30-5011-C [NOVA]) is 
provided below. 
Study PR-30-5010-C (BRAVO) is a 2:1 randomized, open -label, multicenter, controlled clinical 
study in patients with previously treated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 -negative 
gBRCAmut breast cancer. In this study, patients received treatment wi th niraparib 300 mg once 
daily (QD) or physician’s choice single -agent chemotherapy (eribulin, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, 
or capecitabine). Evaluation of computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), including determination of respons e to treatment and date of progression based 
on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; v.1.1), was conducted by a central 
blinded review committee comprised of 2 radiologists, with an arbiter as necessary. The results 
of the central blinded assessment are used in determination of the primary efficacy endpoint of 
PFS and the study investigators also assess response to treatment and date of progression based 
on RECIST (v.1.1). BRAVO was initiated (first patient consented) on 25  February 2014. 
Following a recent interim analysis of data by the independent data monitoring committee 
(IDMC), the study was closed to further enrollment. A large number of patients in the 
chemotherapy control arm (physician’s choice) did not continue in the trial long e nough to 
receive their first radiological scan, resulting in an unusually high rate of censoring in the control 
arm. It is believed that this is likely associated with the desire of patients who carry germline 
BRCA mutations to be treated with a PARP inhib itor rather than chemotherapy and the increased 
availability of PARP inhibitors. No safety concerns have been noted by the IDMC with respect 
to niraparib. Following closure of enrollment, data analysis and review by the Sponsor is 
ongoing. 
Study PR-30-5011-C (NOVA) is a double -blind, 2:1 randomized, placebo -controlled study of 
maintenance with niraparib compared with placebo in patients with platinum -sensitive ovarian 
cancer who have received at least 2 platinum -based regimens, had a response to their last 
regimen, and have no measurable disease >2 cm and normal cancer antigen 125 (CA -125) (or 
>90% decrease) following their last treatment. In this study, there are 2 independent patient 
cohorts comprising patients who have deleterious g BRCAmut versus those who have a tumor with 
high-grade serous histology but without g BRCAmut (non-gBRCAmut). The study assesses the 
effect of treatment with niraparib 300  mg QD on PFS. Progression is assessed by RECIST 
(v.1.1) and clinical criteria using blinded central review by  2 independent radiologists and an 
arbiter, if necessary, as well as per blinded central clinician review. Results of the blinded central 
reviews are used in determination of the primary efficacy endpoint of PFS. NOVA was initiated 
(first patient consented ) on 10 July 2013. Data from the final primary analysis of the Phase 3 
main study, as well as the QTc substudy, recently became available. The results of the PFS 
primary endpoint for each of the 3 primary efficacy populations in platinum -sensitive patients 
(ie, gBRCAmut cohort, HRDpos cohort, and overall non -gBRCAmut cohort) is shown in Table 1. 
Additionally, the median PFS in patients with HRD negative ( HRDneg) tumors was 6.9 months 
(95% CI: 5.6, 9.6) in the niraparib arm compared to 3.8 months (95% CI: 3.7, 5.6) in the placebo 
arm with an HR of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.361, 0.922) (p=0.0226). The primary data to support the

1.3. Rationale for Current Trial  
Treatment options are limited for patients whose ova rian cancer has progressed following 
multiple lines of prior therapy. At the time that this study was initiated, the absence of an 
approved treatment or standard of care in the recurrent setting represented an unmet need. 
National Comprehensive Cancer Netw ork guidelines recommended treatment with single -agent 
topotecan, doxorubicin, or gemcitabine, however the optimal combination and sequence of these 
agentsis unclear and the exact population who would derive the most benefit from these 
treatments is not we ll defined.  
Collectively, the data from multiple published Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies of PARP inhibitors 
used as monotherapy to treat patients with recurrent ovarian cancer suggest that the agents are 
active in this population, the strongest activity being observed in the platinum -sensitive, 
gBRCAmut subgroup.  
In a Phase 2 study of maintenance therapy in 265 patients with relapsed, platinum -sensitive 
ovarian cancer, daily therapy with PARP inhibitor olaparib, compared with placebo, was 
associated with  a PFS benefit (hazard ratio: 0.35) and prolongation of the median PFS from 
4.8 months to 8.4 months.15 
In a Phase 1/2 study w ith niraparib (PN001), 104 patients with advanced solid tumors who had 
received a median of 5 prior therapies were enrolled, of which 49 were ovarian cancer patients 
(13 platinum -sensitive, 35 platinum -resistant, and 1 platinum -refractory). Of the 49 patie nts, 22 
had confirmed BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutation, of whom 20 were radiologically assessable. Eight 
(40%) of these 20 patients achieved a confirmed partial response (PR) by RECIST and CA -125 
Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria at doses ranging from 80 to 40 0 mg per day. Median 
response duration was 387 days (range: 159 to 518 days). Three (33%) of 9 patients with 
platinum -resistant BRCA -mutant ovarian cancer had PR by RECIST and CA -125 criteria . 
Additionally, a 50% response rate (5 of 10 evaluable patients) was observed at daily doses 
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020 -C Amendment 5  
Confidential       Page 24 of 74 ranging from 290 to 300 mg among patients with BRCA -mutant ovarian cancer who had received 
more than 3 lines of prior chemotherapy.  
Thus, niraparib has demonstrated potential for fulfilling an unmet medical need for the treatme nt 
of patients with relapsed ovarian cancer who have received multiple lines of prior therapy.  
The present study is designed to determine the efficacy and safety of niraparib in these patients 
with a high unmet medical need. Furthermore, the present study will assess if the HRD test c an 
be utilized to identify patients with a higher probability of clinical benefit.

3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This study is a multicenter, open -label, single -arm, Phase 2 study evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of niraparib in patients with advanced, relapsed, homologous recombination deficiency 
(HRD) -positive, high -grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal 
cancer with recurrent disease who were previously treated with chemotherapy and experienced a 
response lasting at leas t 6 months to first -line platinum -based therapy. Patients must have 
received 3 or 4 previous chemotherapy regimens (including, but not limited to, gemcitabine, 
doxorubicin, topotecan, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, cisplatin, bevacizumab, or PARP inhibitors as 
single agents or in combination per standard of care). The study will assess by ORR whether 
treatment with niraparib will benefit HRD positive patients who received 3 or 4 prior anti -cancer 
therapies and are platinum -sensitive to the last platinum -based th erapy. As secondary objectives, 
niraparib efficacy (ORR, DOR, DCR, PFS, TFST, and OS) will be assessed in patients who have 
received 3 or 4 prior lines of anti -cancer therapy by platinum -sensitivity to the last platinum -
based therapy; and in all treated pa tients regardless of prior lines of anti -cancer therapy.  
In order to determine eligibility, a tumor sample will be sent to a centralized laboratory for 
immediate HRD testing. Archival or fresh tissue is required in order to enroll in the study. The 
sample  may be sent in advance of the protocol -defined screening period in order to facilitate the 
screening and enrollment process. Patients must wait for the results from the on -study centralized 
HRD testing prior to enrollment, unless they have previously dete cted g BRCA  mutation. Blood 
samples also will be collected for all patients during screening for determination of g BRCAmut 
status.  If HRD status is known, then it  is not necessary to wait for HRD testing results for 
enrollment into the study, however confir matory HRD testing still needs to be performed.  
In order to evaluate tumor markers, an optional fresh biopsy may be done at screening and at the 
end of treatment (EOT) visit.  
Niraparib 300 mg will be administered orally QD continuously beginning on Day 1 a nd every 
cycle (28 days) thereafter until the patient discontinues study treatment. Three capsules of 
100-mg strength will be taken at each dose administration. Dose interruption (no longer than 
28 days) and dose reductions to 2 capsules daily (200 mg), an d subsequently to 1 capsule daily 
(100 mg), will be allowed (no further dose reductions will be allowed). Dose interruption and/or 
reduction may be implemented at any time for any grade toxicity considered intolerable by the 
patient. The timing of efficacy  or safety evaluations should not be affected by dose interruptions 
or reductions.  Patients will continue on study medication until disease progression as long as in 
the investigator’s opinion they are benefiting from treatment and do not meet any other 
discontinuation criteria.  
Blood samples for measurements of plasma levels of niraparib and its major metabolite will be 
obtained on Cycle 1/Day 1 predose and 2 hours postdose, Cycle 2/Day 1 predose and 2 hours 
postdose, Cycle 4/ Day 1 predose, and Cycle 8/ D ay 1 predose. At selected sites, a subset of 
approximately 12 patients will undergo intensive, triplicate ECG monitoring to coincide with PK 
evaluation on Cycle1/Day 1. Triplicate ECGs should be performed between 2 and 5 minutes 
apart and should be perform ed prior to blood draws for PK. These patients will have triplicate 
ECGs and PK samples taken predose and at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8  hours postdose. Patients will be

Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020-C Amendment 5 
Confidential       Page 27 of 74 supine and rested for approximately 2 minutes before ECGs are recorded. The average of the 
triplicate measures will be used for analysis. This subset of patients will undergo all other 
assessments in the study. As of 9 February 2016, the PK QTc sub -study had reached the 
enrollment target of 12 patients and is now closed to enrollment.  
Blood samples will be collected for all patients at screening for the exploratory evaluation of 
circulating biomarkers.  
Clinic visits will be weekly during Cycle 1 and then every 4 weeks (±3 days) for subsequent 
cycles. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIS T; v.1.1) tumor assessment via CT 
or MRI of the abdomen/pelvis and clinically indicated areas is required every 8 weeks (±7 days) 
from Cycle 1/Day 1 for 6 months and then every 12 weeks until progression. Copies of scans 
will be collected for future centra l evaluation if needed. Cycle timing will not be delayed for 
treatment interruptions, and tumor assessment should occur according to this schedule regardless 
of whether study treatment is interrupted. All AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be 
collected and recorded for each patient from the day of signing the screening informed consent 
form (ICF) until the EOT visit. New SAEs (including deaths) will be collected for 30 days after 
the last dose of study treatment. All AEs and SAEs experienced by a pa tient, irrespective of the 
suspected causality, will be monitored until the AE or SAE has resolved, any abnormal 
laboratory values have returned to baseline or normalized, until there is a satisfactory explanation 
for the changes observed, until the patien t is lost to follow-up, or until the patient has died. The 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) for this study are MDS, AML, secondary cancers 
(new primary malignancies other than MDS/AML), pneumonitis, and embryo -fetal toxicity. 
AESIs must be report ed to the Sponsor as soon as the Investigator becomes aware of them 
(Section 6.2.5.3). 
Approximately 500 patients will be enrolled in the study at a pproximately 60 sites . The study 
will be conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP).

4.3. Patient Withdrawal and Replacement  
Patients who are benefitting from treatment will  have access to study treatment as long as 
considered acceptable by their treating physician or until they are discontinued for one of the 
reasons noted below (Section  4.3.1 and Section 4.3.2). 
Niraparib  
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020-C Amendment 5 
Confidential       Page 32 of 74 4.3.1. Discontinuation from Treatment  
Patients may be discontinued from study treatment at any time. Specific reasons for 
discontinuing treatment are given below.  
 Any treatment-related National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE; v.4.03) Grade 3 or 4 events (see separate guidelines for 
platelets below) that have not reverted to CTCAE Grade 1 or better within 28 days of 
dose interruption. 
 At the Investigator’s discretion, following dose interruption (no longer than 28 
days), patients may be considered for dose reductions (to a maximum of 2 dose 
reductions [ie, a minimum dose of 10 0 mg once daily (QD)]). If upon rechallenge 
with study treatment at the lowest allowable dose any CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 AEs 
recur, the patient must be discontinued.  
 In the case of thrombocytopenia, following the first occurrence, resumption of therapy 
may occur at the same dose or 1 dose level lower when the platelet count has resolved 
to ≥100,000/µL. Subsequent occurrences should trigger dose reduction upon 
resumption of therapy. If the platelet count has not reverted within 28 days of 
interruption to ≥ 100,0 00/µL on first or subsequent occurrence, the patient should be 
discontinued. 
 Disease progression according to RECIST (v.1.1) or clinical criteria by Investigator  
 Risk to patients as judged by the Investigator and/or Sponsor  
 Severe noncompliance with the pr otocol as judged by the Investigator and/or Sponsor  
 Patient request 
 Patient becomes pregnant  
 Sponsor decision to terminate study  
Patients who discontinue from treatment will continue to receive post -treatment assessments as 
part of the study unless they are discontinued from the study (Section  4.3.2). 
4.3.2. Discontinuation from the Study  
Patients may be discontinued from the study for any of the following  reasons: 
 Withdrawal of consent by the patient, who is at any time free to discontinue their 
participation in the study, without prejudice to further treatment  
 Death from any cause  
 Patient lost to follow -up 
 End of the study (when responder or discontinuati on status for all patients is known)  
If a patient is lost to follow -up or withdraws from study treatment, attempts should be made to 
contact the patient to determine the reason for discontinuation. For patients who are lost to 
follow-up, at least 3 documen ted attempts, including one via certified mail, should be made to 
contact the patient before considering the patient lost to follow -up.

All patients who enter into the screening period of the study (defined as the point at which the 
patient signs the main study ICF) or agree to pre -screening HRD testing (defined as the point at 
which the patient signs the screening ICF) will receive a unique patient identification number. 
This number will be used to identify the patient throughout the  study and must be used on all 
study documentation related to that patient. The patient identification number must remain 
constant throughout the entire study; it must not be changed at the time of enrollment.

Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020-C Amendment 5 
Confidential       Page 34 of 74 5. STUDY MEDICATION  
5.1. Identity 
Niraparib ([3S]-3-[4-phenyl] piperidine [tosylate monohydrate salt]) is an orally available, 
potent, highly selective PARP -1 and -2 inhibitor. The excipients for niraparib are lactose 
monohydrate and magnesium stearate.  
5.2. Administration 
Niraparib 300 mg (3 x 100 -mg niraparib capsules) will be administered orally QD continuously. 
Patients will be instructed to take their dose at the same time of the day, preferably in the 
morning. Patients must swallow and not chew all capsules.  The consumption of water and food 
is permissible. 
Study treatment will be dispensed to patients on Cycle 1/Day 1 and on Day 1 of every cycle (28 
days) thereafter until the patient discontinues study treatment. The first dose will be administered 
at the site. 
Details on the administration of niraparib can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.3. Dose Modification  
Dose interruption and/or reduction may be implemented at any time for any grade toxicity 
considered intolerable by the patient.  
Treatment must be interrup ted for any nonhematologic CTCAE (v.4.03) Grade 3 or 4 AE that the 
Investigator considers to be related to administration of niraparib. If toxicity is appropriately 
resolved to baseline or Grade 1 or less within 28  days of interruption, the patient may res tart 
treatment with niraparib but with a dose level reduction according to Table 2 if prophylaxis is not 
considered feasible. If the event recurs at sim ilar or worse grade, treatment should be interrupted 
again and, upon resolution, a further dose reduction must be made. No more than 2 dose 
reductions will be permitted (ie, to a minimum dose of 100 mg QD).  
If the toxicity requiring dose interruption has not resolved completely or to CTCAE Grade 1 
during the maximum 4 -week (28-day) dose interruption period, and/or the patient has already 
undergone a maximum of 2 dose reductions (to a minimum dose of 100 mg QD), the patient 
must permanently discontinue trea tment with niraparib.

The dose interruption/modification criteria for hematologic parameters will be based on blood 
counts and are outlined in Table 3. 
If the hematologic toxicity has not recovered to the specified levels within 4 weeks (28 days) of 
the dose interruption period, and/or the patient has already undergone a maximum of 2 dose 
reductions (to a minimum dose of 100 mg QD), the patient must permanently discontinue  
treatment with niraparib.  
In the case of thrombocytopenia, following the first occurrence, resumption of therapy may 
occur at the same dose or 1 dose level lower when the platelet count has resolved to 
≥100,000/µL. Subsequent occurrences should trigger do se reduction upon resumption of therapy. 
If the platelet count has not reverted within 28 days of interruption to ≥  100,000/µL on first or 
subsequent occurrence, the patient should be discontinued.  
If dose interruption or modification is required at any po int on study because of hematologic 
toxicity, weekly blood draws for complete blood count (CBC) will be monitored until the AE 
resolves, and to ensure safety of the new dose, weekly blood draws for CBC will be also required 
for an additional 4 weeks after the AE has been resolved to the specified levels, after which 
monitoring every 4 weeks may resume.  
Any patient requiring transfusion of platelets or red blood cells (1 or more units) or 
hematopoietic growth factor support must undergo a dose reduction upon  recovery if study 
treatment is resumed.  
It is strongly recommended that the patient be referred to a hematologist for further evaluation 
(1) if transfusions are required on more than 1 occasion or (2) if the treatment -related 
hematologic toxicities have n ot recovered to CTCAE Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks. If a 
diagnosis of MDS/AML is confirmed by a hematologist, the patient must permanently 
discontinue study treatment.

considered17,18 For patients taking anticoagulation or antiplatelet drugs, consider the risk/benefit of interrupting 
these drugs and/or prophylactic transfusion at an alternate threshold, such as ≤ 20,000/μL.  
For major surgery while on treatment, up to 28 days of study treatment interruption is allowed.  
Once the dose of study treatment has been reduced, any re -escalation must be di scussed with the 
medical monitor.  
All dose interruptions and reductions (including any missed doses), and the reasons for the 
reductions/interruptions, are to be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
5.4. Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
Niraparib  will be packed in high -density polyethylene bottles with child -resistant closures.  
The label text of the study treatment will comply with Good Manufacturing Practice and national 
legislation to meet the requirements of the participating countries. The stu dy treatment will be 
open -label and non -patient -specific.  
All study treatment supplies must be stored in accordance with the Pharmacy Manual 
instructions and package labeling. Until dispensed to the patients, the study treatment will be 
stored in a securel y locked area, accessible to authorized personnel only.  
5.5. Study Treatment Accountability  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for maintaining accurate dispensing records of the 
study treatment throughout the clinical study. The study treatment account ability log includes 
information including the enrollment number, amount and date dispensed, and amount and date 
returned to the pharmacy, if applicable. Product returned to the pharmacy will be stored under 
the same conditions as products not yet dispense d but will be marked as 'returned' and kept 
separate from the products not yet dispensed.  
All dispensing and accountability records will be available for Sponsor review. The study 
monitor will assume the responsibility to reconcile the study treatment acco untability log. The 
pharmacist will dispense study treatment for each patient according to the protocol and 
Pharmacy Manual, if applicable.  
Niraparib  
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020-C Amendment 5 
Confidential       Page 37 of 74 5.6. Previous and Concomitant Medications  
Any medication the patient takes other than the study treatment, including herbal and other 
nontraditional remedies, is considered a concomitant medication. All concomitant medications 
must be recorded in the eCRF. The following information must be recorded in the eCRF for each 
concomitant medication: trade name or generic name i f trade name is not available, route of 
administration, start date, stop date, frequency, dosage, and indication. Any changes in the 
dosage or regimen of a concomitant medication must be recorded in the eCRF.  
At screening, patients will be asked what medic ations they have taken during the last 30 days. At 
each subsequent study visit, patients will be asked what concomitant medications they are 
currently taking or have taken since the previous visit.  
Niraparib has been associated with QT prolongation when c o-administered with medications 
known to cause QTc prolongation. Therefore, Investigator should be advised to use caution with 
drugs listed in Appendix D. Additionally, niraparib has potential to induce cytochrome P450 
(CYP)1A2 and is a substrate for P -glycoprotein (P-gp); therefore, Investigator should be advised 
to use caution with drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 (see Appendix A) or drugs that are inhibitors 
or substrates of P-gp. The niraparib safety profile includes risk for thrombocytopenia; therefore, 
Investigator should be advised to use cautio n with anticoagulation and antiplatelet drugs.  
5.6.1. Prohibited Medications and Other Study Restrictions  
An increased risk of infection by the administration of live virus and bacterial vaccines has been 
observed with conventional chemotherapy drugs. Effects wit h niraparib are unknown; therefore, 
live virus and bacterial vaccines should not be administered to patients 4 weeks before or during 
the study (defined by the time of first dose).  
No other anticancer therapy is permitted during the course of the study tre atment for any patient. 
Temporary steroid use will be permitted for treatment of AEs or for prophylaxis. Of note, topical 
steroids are permitted without limitation. The patient can receive a stable dose of corticosteroids 
during the study as long as these were started at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment, per exclusion 
criteria above. If the patient disconti nues study treatment, this restriction no longer applies, 
however the patient will remain enrolled in the study for the purpose of collecting subsequent  
outcomes. Palliative radiotherapy (excluding the pelvic region and/or palliative radiotherapy 
encompassing >20% of the bone marrow within 1 week of the first dose of study treatment) is 
allowed for pre-existing small areas of painful metastases that canno t be managed with local or 
systemic analgesics as long as no evidence of disease progression is present.  
Prophylactic cytokine (granulocyte colony -stimulating factor) should not be administered in the 
first cycle of the study but may be administered in sub sequent cycles according to local 
guidelines. 
Patients who are blood donors should not donate blood during the study and for 90 days after the 
last dose of study treatment.

6.1. Efficacy Variables  
6.1.1. Primary Efficacy: Objective Response Rate 
The ORR is defined as the proportion of patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial 
response (PR) as assessed by the Investigator per RECIST (v.1.1) ( Appendix B).  
6.1.2. Secondary Efficacy  
6.1.2.1. Duration of Response  
Duration of response is defined as the time from first documentation of CR or PR until the time 
of first documentation of disease progression (PD) as assessed by the Investigator  per RECIST 
(v.1.1) or clinical criteria ( Appendix B).  
Because of the pelvic location of the primary tumor and the frequent occurrence of peritonea l 
disease, imaging may not always be reliable for documentation of PD. Criteria other than 
RECIST may be applicable to define PD; thus, PD may also be determined if at least 1 of the 
following criteria is met:  
1. Additional diagnostic tests (eg, histology/cytology, ultrasound techniques, endoscopy, 
positron emission tomography) identify new lesions or determine existing lesions qualify 
for unequivocal PD AND CA -125 progression according to Gynecologic Cancer 
Intergroup criteria 
2. Definitive clinical signs and symptoms of PD unrelated to nonmalignant or iatrogenic 
causes ([a] intractable cancer -related pain; [b] malignant bowel obstruction/worsening 
dysfunction; or [c] unequivocal symptomatic worsening of ascites or pleural effusion) 
AND CA-125 progression according to Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria.  
Abnormal CA-125 levels on-study do not represent disease progression; however, they may 
prompt imaging if clinically indicated. PD will not be diagnosed in case of CA -125 progression 
in the absence of at least 1 of the criteria defined above.  
The Investigator will describe why PD was diagnosed in the eCRF.  
The date of PD is defined as the earliest time point when one of the PD criteria is met. If 
CT/MRI shows existing (baseline) lesions that only e quivocally suggest PD and additional 
diagnostic tests are required to determine unequivocal PD, the official date of PD will be the date 
PD was unequivocally determined. Alternatively, with new lesions (except ascites and effusions) 
that are initially equi vocal that are later unequivocally determined, the date of progression will 
be the date the lesion was initially identified.  
6.1.2.2. Disease Control Rate  
Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of patients achieving CR, PR, or stable disease 
(SD) as assessed by the Investigator per RECIST (v.1.1) ( Appendix B). 
Niraparib  
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020-C Amendment 5 
Confidential       Page 39 of 74 6.1.2.3. Progression-Free Survival 
Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the earlier date of 
assessment of progression or death by any cause in the absence of progression as assessed by the 
Investigator per RECIST (v.1.1) or clinical criteria ( Appendix B). PFS evaluation will be 
performed as described by the SAP.  
6.1.2.4. Overall Survival 
OS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose to the date of death by any cause. 
Following the treatment discontinuation visit, survival status will be collected for all patients 
using acceptable means including telephone contact. New malignancy information will also be 
collected as part of this assessment.  
As part of OS assessment, information will be collec ted on subsequent anticancer therapies 
following study treatment. Using source documentation (including clinic notes), the following 
information will be collected:  
 Name (and/or class)  
 Start date 
 Dose-limiting toxicities 
 Best response (CR, PR, SD, PD)  
 Progression date 
6.1.2.5. Time to First Subsequent Therapy (TFST)  
Time to first subsequent therapy (TFST) is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the 
date of first subsequent therapy or death, whichever occurs first. Using source documentation 
(including clinic notes) the same information will be collected as described in Overall Survival 
(Section 6.1.2.4).  
6.2. Safety Variables  
Safety parameters evaluated during the conduct of the study include: treatment -emergent AEs 
(TEAEs), clinical laboratory (hematology and chemistry), vital signs, physical examination, and 
use of concomitant medications.  
6.2.1. Definitions 
Adverse event:  An adverse event is any untoward me dical occurrence that occurs in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or 
not considered related to the product.  
Adverse events may include the onset of new illnes s and the exacerbation of pre -existing medical 
conditions. An AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including 
baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.  
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020 -C Amendment 5  
Confidential       Page 40 of 74 A treatment -emergent adverse event  will be defined as any new AE that begins, or any 
preexisting condition that worsens in severity, after at least 1 dose of study treatment has been 
administered.  
Serious adverse event:   A serious adverse event  is defined as any untoward medical occur rence 
that, at any dose:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening  
 Note: This means that the patient is at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe  
 Requires i npatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 Any AE that prolongs hospitalization will be considered an SAE.  
 Exception:  Planned hospitalization (eg, for observation, protocol compliance, 
elective procedures, social reasons, disease  progression, etc.) will not be 
considered an SAE; however, the reason for the planned hospitalization should be 
captured in medical history.  
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Is an import ant medical event(s)  
 An important medical event may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or require intervention to 
prevent one of the above outcomes. Examples of such events are intensive  
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
6.2.2.  Assessment of Adverse Events  
Each AE will be assessed by the Investigator with regard to the following categories.  
6.2.2.1.  Intensity  
Investigators should assess the severity of AEs according to CTCAE. In general, CTCAE 
(v.4.03) severity grades are:  
Grade 1:   Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observ ations only; 
intervention not indicated  
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL). (Instrumental ADL refer 
to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or c lothes, using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.)  
Niraparib  
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020-C Amendment 5 
Confidential       Page 41 of 74 Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL. (Self-care ADL refer to bathi ng, dressing and undressing, feeding 
self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.)  
Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5: Death related to AE  
A distinction should be made between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria above in Section  6.2.1. For example, a mild degree 
of gastrointestinal bleeding requiring an overnight hospitalization for monitoring purposes may 
be considered an SAE but is not necessarily severe. Similarly, an AE that is severe in intensity is 
not necessarily an SAE. For example, alopecia may be assessed as severe  in intensity but may 
not be considered an SAE.  
6.2.2.2. Causality 
The Investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the study treatment and the AE. 
One of the following categories should be selected based on medical judgment, considering the 
definitions and all contributing factors:  
 Related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs in a plausible 
time relationship to treatment administration, and which concurrent disease or other 
drugs or chemicals cannot explain. The response t o withdrawal of the treatment should 
be clinically plausible.  
 Likely related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the treatment, unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or ot her drugs or chemicals  
 Unlikely to be related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
temporal relationship to treatment administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable, or in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide likely 
explanations 
 Unrelated: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little 
or no temporal relationship with treatment administration. Typically explained 
by extraneous factors (eg, concomitant disease, environmental  factors, or 
other drugs or chemicals).  
6.2.3. Collecting and Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs, regardless of the source of identification (eg, physical examination, laboratory 
assessment, ECG, reported by patient), must be documented in the eCRF.  
All AEs and SAEs will be collected and recorded in the eCRF for each patient from the day of 
signing the screening ICF until the EOT visit (see Table 4 for schedule of events). New SAEs 
(including deaths) will be collected for an additional 30 days after the last dose of study 
treatment. All AEs and SAEs experienced by a patient, irrespectiv e of the suspected causality, 
will be monitored until the AE or SAE has resolved, any abnormal laboratory values have 
Niraparib  
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020-C Amendment 5 
Confidential       Page 42 of 74 returned to baseline or normal levels, until there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes 
observed, until the patient is lost to fo llow-up, or until the patient has died.  
If an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE after the 30 -day follow-up period post treatment 
discontinuation and considers the SAE related to investigational product, the Investigator should 
report the SAE to the Spon sor according to timelines for reporting SAEs described in this 
section. 
Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by the study patient, or discovered by the 
study staff during physical examinations or by asking an open, non -leading question such as:  
“How have you been feeling since you were last asked?”  The Investigator will document the 
nature of the AE, date of onset of the AE (and time, if known), date of outcome of the AE (and 
time, if known), severity of the AE, action taken with study treatmen t as a result of the AE, 
assessment of the seriousness of the AE, and assessment of the causal relationship of the AE to 
study treatment and/or study procedure.  
All AEs should be recorded individually in the patient’s own words (verbatim) unless, in the 
opinion of the Investigator, the AEs constitute components of a recognized condition, disease, or 
syndrome. In the latter case, the condition, disease, or syndrome should be named rather than 
each individual symptom.  
Concomitant illnesses that existed before  entry into the study will not be considered an AE 
unless the illness worsens during the treatment period. Pre -existing conditions will be recorded in 
the eCRF on the Medical History or appropriate page as well as on the SAE Report Form 
medical history sec tion. 
6.2.4. Reporting Disease Progression  
The event of disease progression is an efficacy criterion and is therefore not considered an AE. If 
AEs/SAEs occur in relation to disease progression, the AEs/SAEs must be reported per AE/SAE 
reporting requirements described in Section  6.2.3 and Section 6.2.5. 
6.2.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator must report all SAEs within 24  hours of becoming aware of the initial SAE or 
any follow-up information regarding the SAE.  
For all SAEs, an SAE report form must be completed by the Investigator for all  initial and 
follow-up SAEs. A follow -up SAE report must be completed each time an Investigator becomes 
aware of any additional information regarding the SAE. For the follow -up SAE Report Form, the 
following fields must be completed on each form:  follow -up number, site number, 
patient/subject number, protocol number, and the SAE term(s) and date of awareness. Only the 
appropriate field(s) on the SAE Report Form where the Investigator received additional or 
updated information should be completed. Previousl y provided information does not have to be 
entered on the follow -up SAE Report Form.  
Initial and follow-up SAE reports and any additional supporting documentation (eg, hospital 
reports, consultant reports, death certificates, autopsy reports, etc) included  with the SAE report 
should be sent to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of the Investigator/site awareness or 
receipt. If supporting documentation is provided, the Investigator should highlight all relevant 
and pertinent information. Also, any add itional SAE documentation must be a clear photocopy 
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020 -C Amendment 5  
Confidential       Page 43 of 74 with the patient’s personal identifiers removed. The Investigator must sign and date all SAE 
forms.  
The minimum information required for an initial SAE report is as follows:  
 Name of person sending the rep ort (ie, name, address of Investigator)  
 Patient identification (screening number, initials [if permitted by local data 
privacy regulations], NOT patient name)  
 Protocol number  
 Description of SAE  
 Causality assessment  
After receipt of the initial report, the Sponsor (or designee) will review the information and, if 
necessary, contact the Investigator to obtain further information.  
SAE REPORTING CONTACT INFORMATION  
Email:  
Fax:  
6.2.5.1.  Submission and Distribution of Ad verse Events/Serious Adverse Events  
Per regulatory requirements, if an SAE is required to be submitted to a Regulatory Authority a 
copy of this report (CIOMS or MedWatch 3500A) will be distributed to the Investigators/site. 
The Investigator/site will submit a copy the report to their respective institutional review board 
(IRB) or independent ethics committee (IEC) per local requirements.  
6.2.5.2.  Pregnancy  
Pregnancies occurring in patients/subjects enrolled in a study must be reported and followed to 
outcome.  
Pregnancy alone is not regarded as an AE unless there is a possibility that the study treatment 
may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Elective abortions 
without complications should not be considered AEs unless they were therapeutic abortions. 
Hospitalization for normal delivery of a healthy newborn should not be considered an SAE. 
Pregnancy is not considered an SAE unless there is an associated serious outcome. Spontaneous 
abortions should always be reported as SAEs.  
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE Report Form (eg, maternal 
serious complications, therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
congenital anomaly, birth defect) and reported within 24 hours in accordance with the procedure 
for reporting SAEs.  
The Investigator should complete the Initial Pregnancy Notification report form and forward it to 
the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the pregnancy. If there is an 
associated serious outcome, the n both the Initial Pregnancy Notification report form and SAE 
report form should be completed.

Niraparib  
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020-C Amendment 5 
Confidential       Page 44 of 74 The Investigator should follow -up with the patient/subject until delivery or termination of 
pregnancy even if the patient was withdrawn from the clinical study o r if the clinical study has 
finished. At that time, the Pregnancy Outcome report form should be completed and submitted to 
the Sponsor within 24 hours after the Investigator becomes aware of the pregnancy outcome.  
In the event the pregnancy outcome occurs following the end of the study and database lock, the 
Investigator will report the pregnancy outcome to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours after 
the outcome of the pregnancy is known to the Investigator in accordance with the procedure for 
reporting SAEs (see Section 6.2.5). 
6.2.5.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
MDS, AML, secondary cancers (new malignancies other than MDS/AML), pneumonitis, and 
embryo-fetal toxicity are Adverse of Special Interest (AESIs). AESIs must be reported to the 
Sponsor and recorded as such on the eCRF and on an SAE form; the SAE form must be 
submitted within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware as noted for SAEs in 
Section 6.2.5.  AESI monitoring must occur during the study, during long -term follow-up and 
after study discontinuation.  
6.2.6. Clinical Laboratory Assessment 
The following laboratory variables will be determined in accordance with Table 4 (schedule of 
events): 
 Complete blood count:  
 Hemoglobin 
 Platelets 
 Mean platelet volume (optional*)  
 Mean corpuscular volume  
 White blood cell count  
 Differential white cell count  
 Serum chemistry assessments for safety include:  
 Sodium 
 Potassium 
 Calcium 
 Magnesium 
 Chloride 
 Glucose 
 Creatinine 
 Total bilirubin 
 Gamma glutamyltransferase  
Niraparib  
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020-C Amendment 5 
Confidential       Page 45 of 74  Alkaline phosphatase  
 Aspartate aminotransferase  
 Alanine aminotransferase  
 Urea or blood urea nitrogen  
 Total protein 
 Albumin 
 Lactate dehydrogenase  
 Amylase 
 Serum CA-125 
 Serum pregnancy testing  
These tests will be performed by the local laboratory at the clinical site.  
Any laboratory values assessed as clinically significant should be recorded as an AE or SAE. If 
SAE criteria are met, the SAE should be recorded and reported according to the SAE reporting 
process (see Section  6.2.5). 
Hematological testing may occur more frequently than is specified in Table 4 when additional 
testing is medically indicated per Investigator judgment. Additional tests may be performed at a 
laboratory facility other than the study site, but test results must be reported to the study site, the 
study site must keep a copy of test results with the patient’s study file, and the results must be 
entered into the electronic data capture system.  
For any suspected case of MDS/AML or second primary malignancies other than 
MDS/AMLreported while a patient is receivi ng treatment or being followed for post -treatment 
assessments, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy testing must be completed by a local 
hematologist. Testing completed as part of standard of care is sufficient as long as the methods 
are acceptable to the Spons or's Medical Monitor. The study site must receive a copy of the 
hematologist’s report of aspirate/biopsy findings, which must include a classification according 
to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria,19 and other sample testing reports related to 
MDS/AML or secondary cancer (new malignancies other than MDS/AML) . Report data will be 
entered into EDC on the appropriate eCRF pages and the site must keep a copy of all reports 
with the patient’s study file.  
* Note:  Although mean platelet volume collection is optional, it is highly encouraged, especially 
for patients with high -grade thrombocytopenia.  
6.2.7. Physical Examination and Vital Signs  
Physical examinations, including height (screening only), weight, and vital signs (blood pressure 
[BP], pulse, and temperature), will be performed in accordance with the schedule of events 
(Table 4). 
Any physical examination or vital sign findings assessed as clinically significant should be 
recorded as an AE or SAE. If SAE criteria are met, the SAE should be recorded and reported 
according to the SAE reporting process (see Section  6.2.5). 
Niraparib  
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020-C Amendment 5 
Confidential       Page 46 of 74 6.2.8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status  
Performance status will be assessed using the ECOG scale (see Appendix C) in accordance with 
the schedule of events ( Table 4). The same observer should as sess performance status each time.  
6.2.9. Additional Safety Assessments  
All patients will undergo a single ECG assessment at the screening visit ( Table 4). The ECG 
assessment should be performed prior to any blood draws for PK or other laboratory evaluations. 
Patients will be supine and rested for approximately 2 minutes before ECGs are recorded. ECGs 
may be archived for future central evaluation if needed.  
A subset of approximately 12 patients will undergo intensive, triplicate ECG monitoring to 
coincide with PK evaluation on Cycle1/Day 1 (see Section  6.4 for time points). This subset of 
patients will undergo all other assessments in the study.  
Any ECG findings assessed as clinically significant should be recorded as an AE or SAE. If SAE 
criteria are met, the SAE should be recorded and reported according to the SAE reporting 
process (see Section  6.2.5). 
6.3. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics consist of those variables that are assessed at 
screening/baseline.  
6.3.1. Patient Eligibility  
Compliance with inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed as outlined in Section  4.1 and 
Section 4.2. 
6.3.2. Patient Demography  
Patient demography consists of:  
 Age at screening 
 Race 
 Ethnicity 
 Sex 
6.3.3. Disease History 
For disease history, the following will be documented:  
 Date of first diagnosis  
 Tumor type 
 Stage at time of initial diagnosis  
 Histology and grade of disease at diagnosis and most recent biopsy if additional biopsy 
performed 
 Date of start of first treatment

 Date of last dose of first treatment  
 Dates of start of all subsequent treatments  
 Agents in all subsequent treatments  
 Dates of last dose of all subsequent treatments  
 Best response and toxicities (including hematologic events) for each prior treatment 
 Date of recurrence for each treatment  
 ECOG performance status  
 Collection of hematologic events during prior therapy  
6.3.4. Medical and Surgical History  
Major medical and surgical history (including medication history), including history of prior 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, or anemia within 1 year prior to signing the main 
study ICF, will be collected. Details of any prior invasive malignancy will be collected. Medical 
and surgical history will be obtained by interviewing the patient or by reviewing his/her medical 
records. 
6.3.5. Previous and Concomitant Medications  
Previous and concomitant medication will be documented as described in Section  5.6. 
Medications will be coded using World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
classification. 
6.4. Pharmacokinetics  
Plasma samples for population PK assessment will be analyzed for co ncentrations of niraparib 
and its major metabolite. A population PK modeling approach will be used to describe plasma 
concentrations of niraparib and its major metabolite in patients. In the analysis, a number of 
covariates will be evaluated to determine i f they contribute to differences in the PK estimates 
among individuals. Parameters of interest include area under the curve (AUC), minimum 
observed plasma concentration (C min), maximum observed plasma concentration (C max), and/or 
AUC at steady-state (AUCss), Cmin,ss, Cmax,ss, and, if the data allow, oral clearance (CL/F) and 
oral volume of distribution (Vz/F).  
In addition, the PK/pharmacodynamic relationship between concentrations of niraparib and its 
major metabolite and efficacy and safety measures will b e investigated. The exposure to 
niraparib and its major metabolite will be correlated with safety (selected AEs) and efficacy 
variables. 
For all patients, blood samples for measurements of plasma levels of niraparib will be obtained 
on Cycle 1/Day 1 predose (within 30 minutes) and 2 hours postdose (±15 minutes), Cycle 2/Day 
1 predose (within 30 minutes) and 2 hours postdose (±15 minutes), Cycle 4/Day 1 predose 
(within 30 minutes), and Cycle 8/Day 1 predose (within 30 minutes). If niraparib is not 
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020 -C Amendment 5  
Confidential       Page 48 of 74 administer ed, collection of predose blood sample is required, however postdose sample 
collection is not required.  
At selected sites, a subset of approximately 12 patients will undergo intensive, triplicate ECG 
monitoring to coincide with PK evaluation on Cycle1/Day 1. These patients will have triplicate 
ECGs taken prior to the PK blood draw predose and at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours postdose.  
The time of last dose prior to PK blood draw should be recorded.  
Complete instructions for collection, processing, shipping, and h andling of samples are detailed 
in the Laboratory Manual.  
6.5. Blood and Tissue Samples  
Blood samples will be collected for all patients during screening for determination of g BRCAmut 
status.  
Blood samples will be collected for all patients during screening for the exploratory evaluation of 
circulating markers.  
Tumor samples, archival and/or fresh biopsy, for all patients will be collected prior to study 
treatment initiation for the evaluation of tumor markers of niraparib sensitivity or resistance, 
such as those related to DNA repair deficiency, including centralized HRD and t BRCAmut status 
testing. Centralized HRD testing must be completed prior to enrollment. If historic blood 
gBRCAmut is detected by a central g BRCAmut testing as part of screening, then tu mor HRD 
sample test results are not required prior to enrollment, however the test should be performed for 
all enrolled patients. Sites are encouraged to send tumor samples for HRD testing as soon as a 
patient is considered for enrollment in this study.  
Details on blood and tissue sample collection can be found in the Laboratory Manual.  
DNA from the blood and tumor samples will be stored and may be used at a later time for 
biomarker testing including potential to bridging to candidate companion diagnostic a ssays.  
The testing of markers related to tumor immunology may be conducted from tissue or blood.

described and justified in the final clinical study report.  
8.1. Analysis Populations  
Efficacy analysis will be performed on the following populations:  
 Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population, defined as all dosed patients with mea surable disease at 
baseline.  
 Response -Evaluable Population, defined as all ITT patients with at least one evaluable 
post-baseline tumor scan.    
 Per-protocol (PP) population, consisting of all patients in the ITT Population who do not 
have protocol deviat ions that may significantly impact the interpretation of efficacy 
results. A detailed specification of the PP population will be provided in the SAP.  
Safety analysis will be performed on the Safety Population, defined as all patients who received

8.3. Efficacy Analyses  
8.3.1.  Primary Efficacy Parameter  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the investigator -assessed co nfirmed ORR per RECIST v1.1 in 
the HRD -positive patients who have received 3 or 4 prior lines of anti -cancer therapy and are 
platinum -sensitive to the last platinum -based therapy. Patients with prior PARP inhibitor 
treatment are excluded. The alternative h ypothesis of ORR ≥30% will be tested against a null 
hypothesis of ORR ≤10%. The rationale of the hypothesis and the power calculation are detailed 
in section 8.8. The response rate and 95% confidence interval along with a one -sided p -value for 
testing the null hypothesis based on the binomial distribution will be provided.  
8.3.2.  Secondary Efficacy Parameters  
The following key secondary efficacy endpoints are defined:  
 Investigator -assessed confirmed ORR per RECIST v1.1 in all patients who have 
received 3 or 4 prio r lines of anti -cancer therapy and are platinum -sensitive to the last

The response rate and 95% CI along with a one -sided p -value for testing the null hypothesis 
based on the binomial distribution w ill be provided for each key secondary endpoint. The 
primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested sequentially to control the overall 
Type I error rate at 1 -sided 0.025 level.  
Other secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed descriptively  including:  
 DOR, DCR, PFS, TFST and OS in patient groups included in the primary and key 
secondary endpoints.  
 ORR, DOR, DCR, PFS, TFST and OS in patients who have received 3 or 4 prior lines

For all patients, as appropriate, blood samples for measurements of plasma levels of niraparib 
and its major metabolite will be obtained on Cycle 1/Day 1 and on Cycle 2/ Day 1 at the 
following time points:  0 (predose, within 30 minutes) and 2 hour s (±15 minutes) postdose. In 
subsequent cycles, blood samples for measurement of plasma levels of niraparib will be obtained  
on Cycle  4/Day 1 and Cycle 8/Day 1 predose (within 30 minutes) only.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters including AUC, C min, tmax, Cmax, AUC ss, Cminss, Cmaxss, and, if the 
data allow,  CL/F and Vz/F, will be determined.  
In addition, the PK/pharmacodynamic relationship between concentrations of niraparib and its 
major metabolite with efficacy and safety measures will be investigated, and expo sure (AUC, 
and/or C max) determined for niraparib and its major metabolite will be correlated with safety 
(selected AEs)  and efficacy variables.  
Descriptive statistics and categorical analyses of ECG variables will be provided for the subset of 
patients (ap proximately 12) with intensive ECG collection. A separate population PK analysis 
plan will be written to describe the analyses of ECG variables and PK parameters.  
8.6. Biomarker Analyses  
Efficacy in the biomarker subgroups, such as t BRCA  and HRD or HRR gene mut ations, will be 
explored and analyzed descriptively.  
8.7. Post-Treatment Analyses  
Descriptive summary statistics will be used to summarize post -treatment data (ie, subsequent 
anticancer therapy and any new malignancy).  
8.8. Determination of Sample Size  
The study pr otocol initially allowed enrollment of patients with at least 3 prior lines of anti -
cancer therapy. With subsequent protocol amendments, the study enrollment was adjusted to 
allow only HRD -positive patients with 3 or 4 prior lines of anti -cancer therapy. T his adjustment 
was made in consideration of the evolving role of PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer treatment 
based on external data. Overall, approximately 500 patients are expected in the study. The study 
enrollment is also expected to include a minimum n umber of t BRCAmut patients (≥50) and HRD -
positive patients (≥150).  
For the primary efficacy endpoint of ORR in HRD -positive patients who have received 3 or 4 
prior lines of anti -cancer therapy and are platinum -sensitive to the last platinum -based therapy,  
an alternative hypothesis of ORR ≥30% is considered against a null hypothesis of ORR ≤10%.  
For the key secondary efficacy endpoints of ORR tested in broader subgroups to include 
platinum -resistant patients and/or HRD -negative/unknown patients, an alterna tive hypothesis of 
ORR ≥25% is considered against a null hypothesis of ORR ≤10%.  
The rationale of choosing the null and alternative hypothesis for the primary and the key 
secondary efficacy endpoints are based on data external from this study; these clinic al trials of 
PARP inhibitors (e.g. niraparib, olaparib, and rucaparib) which suggests that platinum -sensitivity 
and/or HRD positivity (including BRCA mutant) play a role in how patients with ovarian cancer 
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020 -C Amendment 5  
Confidential       Page 61 of 74 respond to treatment. There is limited data for th e overall HRD -positive population in ovarian 
cancer treatment. In a rucaparib study that included patients who are LOH -positive (another 
assay evaluating tumor homologous recombination deficiency), ORR in the non -tBRCA /LOH -
positive patients with at least 2  prior lines of therapy was 17%.1 A recent publication of 
platinum -sensitive patients with at least 1 prior line of therapy presented an ORR of 29% in the 
non-tBRCA /LOH -positive group.2 Therefore, choice of the hypotheses of Ho: ORR ≤10% vs. 
Ha: ORR ≥30% for the primary efficacy and Ho: ORR ≤10% vs. Ha: ORR ≥25% for the key 
secondary analyses would be appropriate for testing the efficacy of ni raparib treatment in the 
specified populations.  
It is estimated that 45 patients would provide 90% power for testing the primary efficacy 
analyses. Statistical power for various sample sizes are presented below to provide guidance for 
the key secondary hy potheses when tested individually (regardless of sequential testing). The 
power is calculated by assuming the exact binomial distribution using East® software Version 
6.4.

As of August 2017, approximately 450 patients were dosed in the study. Approximately 320 
patients had 3 or 4 prior lines of anti -cancer therapy (~150 HRD positive). Based on a 
preliminary calculation of the platinum -sensitivity to the last platinum -based t herapy, the number 
of enrolled patients for the primary endpoint and the key secondary efficacy endpoints are 
considered adequate to ensure sufficient power for the planned analysis.

the Sponsor. Data collection processes and procedures will be reviewed and validated to ensure 
completeness, accuracy, reliability, and consistency. A complete audit trail will be mainta ined of 
all data changes. The Investigator (or designee) will cooperate with the Sponsor’s 
representative(s) for the periodic review of study documents to ensure the accuracy and 
completeness of the data capture system at each scheduled monitoring visit.  
Electronic consistency checks and manual review will be used to identify any errors or 
inconsistencies in the data. This information will be provided to the respective study sites by 
means of electronic or manual queries.  
The Investigator (or designee) will  prepare and maintain adequate and accurate study documents 
(medical records, ECGs, AE, and concomitant medication reporting, raw data collection forms, 
etc.) designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each patient receiving study 
treatment.  
The Investigator will allow Sponsor representatives, contract designees, authorized regulatory 
authority inspectors, and the IRB to have direct access to all documents pertaining to the study.  
9.3. Archiving Study Documents  
Essential clinical documents  will be maintained to demonstrate the validity of the study and the 
integrity of the data collected. Master files should be established at the beginning of the study, 
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020 -C Amendment 5  
Confidential       Page 63 of 74 maintained for the duration of the study, and retained according to the appropriate regu lations. 
According to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, essential documents 
should be retained for a minimum of 2  years after the last approval of a marketing application in 
an ICH region and until there are no pending or contempl ated marketing applications in an ICH 
region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development 
of the study treatment.  
9.4. Good Clinical Practice  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ICH for GCP and the De claration of 
Helsinki (2008). The clinical study will also be carried out in accordance with national and local 
regulatory requirement(s).  
9.5. Informed Consent  
Before each patient is enrolled in the clinical study, written informed consent will be obtained 
from the patient according to the regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country. 
As part of this procedure, the Investigator must explain orally and in writing the nature, duration, 
and purpose of the study, and the action of the study treatm ent in such a manner that the patient 
is aware of the potential risks, inconveniences, or AEs that may occur. The patient should be 
informed that he/she is free to withdraw from the study at any time. The patient will receive all 
information that is requir ed by regulatory authorities and ICH guidelines. The Investigator (or 
designee) will provide the Sponsor with a copy of the IRB/IEC -approved ICF prior to the start of 
the study.  
The ICF must be signed and dated; one copy will be given to the patient and th e Investigator will 
retain a copy as part of the clinical study records. The Investigator will not undertake any 
investigation specifically required for the clinical study until written consent has been obtained. 
The terms of the consent and when it was ob tained must also be documented.  
Depending on local site requirements, patients may sign a screening ICF prior to the screening 
period to facilitate early HRD testing only. This ICF should allow HRD testing procedures only. 
The informed consent process and documentation of informed consent will be the same for the 
screening ICF as for the main ICF.  
If a protocol amendment is required, then the ICF may need to be revised to reflect the changes 
to the protocol. If the ICF is revised, it must be reviewed and ap proved by the responsible 
IRB/IEC and signed by all patients subsequently enrolled in the clinical study as well as those 
currently enrolled in the clinical study.  
9.6. Protocol Approval and Amendment  
Before the start of the study, the study protocol and/or oth er relevant documents will be approved 
by the IEC/IRB/Competent Authorities, in accordance with local legal requirements. The 
Sponsor must ensure that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the first patient 
is enrolled in the study.  
This protocol is to be followed exactly. To alter the protocol, amendments must be written, 
receive approval from the appropriate personnel, and receive IRB/IEC/Competent Authority 
approval prior to implementation (if appropriate). In the United States and Cana da, following 
Niraparib   
Clinical Study Protocol PR -30-5020 -C Amendment 5  
Confidential       Page 64 of 74 approval, the protocol amendment(s) will be submitted to the IND under which the study is being 
conducted. Administrative changes (not affecting the patient benefit/risk ratio) may be made 
without the need for a formal amendment. All amendmen ts will be distributed to all protocol 
recipients, with appropriate instructions.  
9.7. Patient Confidentiality and Data Protection  
All clinical study findings and documents will be regarded as confidential. Study documents 
(protocols, Investigator’s Brochures, and other material) will be stored appropriately to ensure 
their confidentiality. The Investigator and members of his/her research team (including the 
IRB/IEC) must not disclose such information without prior written approval from the Sponsor, 
except to th e extent necessary to obtain informed consent from patients who wish to participate 
in the trial or to comply with regulatory requirements.  
The anonymity of participating patients must be maintained. Patients will be specified on study 
documents by their enrollment number or birth date, not by name. Documents that identify the 
patient (eg, the signed informed consent document) must be maintained in confidence by the 
Investigator.  
9.8. Study Monitoring  
Monitoring and auditing procedures approved by the Sponsor w ill be followed in order to 
comply with GCP guidelines. On -site checking of the eCRFs for completeness and clarity, cross -
checking with source documents, and clarification of administrative matters will be performed.  
The study will be monitored by the Spon sor (or designee). Monitoring will be done by personal 
visits from a representative of the sponsor (site monitor) who will review the eCRFs and source 
documents. The site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to protocol 
design and regulatory requirements by frequent site visits and by communications (letter, 
telephone, and fax).  
All unused study treatment and other study materials will be returned to the Sponsor after the 
clinical phase of the study has been completed.  
9.9. Audits an d Inspections  
Regulatory authorities, the IRB/IEC, and/or the Sponsor’s clinical quality assurance group, or its 
designee, may request access to all source documents, eCRFs, and other study documentation for 
on-site audit or inspection. Direct access to th ese documents must be guaranteed by the 
Investigator, who must provide support at all times for these activities.  
9.10. Ethical Considerations  
The study will be conducted in accordance with ethical principles founded in the Declaration of 
Helsinki. The IRB/IEC w ill review all appropriate study documentation in order to safeguard the 
rights, safety, and well -being of the patients. The study will only be conducted at sites where 
IRB/IEC approval has been obtained. The protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, informed con sent, 
advertisements (if applicable), written information given to the patients, safety updates, annual 
progress reports, and any revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB/IEC by the 
Investigator.

Confidential       Page 69 of 74 APPENDIX  B. RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID 
TUMORS (RECIST), V.1 .1 
Response Criteria by RECIST v.1.1  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diame ters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that i s the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progressions).  
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither su fficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study  
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalizatio n of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of 1 or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits  
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression  of existing non -target lesions. Unequivocal progression  should not normally trump 
target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase.   
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the 
treating ph ysician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from t he start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measu rement and confirmation criteria.

*** In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non -target lesions may be accepted as disease progression.  
Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence 
of disease progression at tha t time should be reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

* ‘Non -CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non-target disease since SD is increasingly used as

measured is not advised  
 
Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overal l response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest meas urements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
Duration of stable disease :  Stable dis ease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

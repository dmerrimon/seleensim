STUDY DESIGN 
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double- blind trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety  of 
neoadjuvant treatment with pamrevlumab  or placebo in combination with either G/NP  or 
FOLFIRINOX in  the treatment of locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer su bjects. 
Approximately 280 subjects will be enrolled . 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
Confidential Page 7 of 82 STUDY PERIODS  
Screening Period (up to 30 days) : 
Subjects will be evaluated per the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine eligibility 
for participation in this trial.  During screening, a  central review board (including radiologists 
and surgeons) will confirm if  subjects have locally advanced, unresectable disease prior to 
enrollment.  This c entral review  board will also  review each subjects’ baseline CT scan to 
determine the degree of superior mesenteric artery (SMA ) encasement and whether or not they 
have unreconstructible disease for the purposes of stratification at randomization.  The central 
review board will also ev aluate subjects’ baseline PET scan to determine SUVmax. Protocol 
assessments will be completed during screening visits in accordance with Schedule of Assessments (SOA) to establish a baseline profile, including : demographics, medical history, 
clinical status and disease stage for each subject.  Subjects determined to be eligible for 
participation will be  enrolled in the trial and  randomized to study treatment.  Investigators will 
choose the chemotherapy treatment regimen (either G/NP or FOLFIRINOX), in collab oration 
with their subjects, during the screening period. 
Randomization: Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two study treatment arms; pamrevlumab 
with G/NP or FOLFIRINOX or placebo with G/NP  or FOLFIRINOX. Subjects will be 
stratified at randomization by  chemotherapy treatment regimen (G/NP or FOLFIRINOX),  SMA 
encasement  (> or ≤ 180 degrees ), unreconstructible disease and geographic region. 
Neoadjuvant Treatment Period (~24 -30 weeks): 
Subjects will receive up to 6 cycles of study treatment. Subjects’ clinical status and safety will 
be regularly evaluated. Efficacy assessments will be performed routinely to evaluate subjects’ quality of life and disease state.  CT scans will be performed approximately every 8 weeks and 
evaluated by central imaging until disease progression is noted.  If disease progression occurs 
during the neoadjuvant treatment period, subjects will be discontinued from study treatment and continue in the follow-up period. RECIST response will be e valuated by central radiology. 
Eligibility Assessment for Surgical Exploration:  
Eligibility for surgical exploration will be evaluated for all subjects who complete  study 
treatment.  To be considered eligible for surgical exploration a subject must meet at least one of 
the four protocol-defined criteria and have no contraindication to surgery, as outlined below: 
The protocol- defined criteria  for surgical eligibility  are: 
•Reduction in CA19-9 level ≥ 50%
•FDG- PET SUV
max decrease by ≥ 30% at EOT when compared to baseline
•Partial response [PR],  complete response [CR], or stable disease [SD] per
RECIST  1.1 at EOT
•Meet the definition of resectable or borderline resectable per NCCN®
Versio
n 2.2018
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
Confidential Page 8 of 82 Contraindications to surgical eligibility  are: 
•Development of distant metastases or local progression per RECIST 1.1
•Performance status of  Karnofsky score ≤ 50
•Unreconstructible disease as determined by central radiolog ical/surgical review
•Other conditions that are considered by PI or surgeon to be contraindications to
surgery
The site will be required to provide information  to the central review board  following the 
subject’s EOT visit (i.e. CT scan, PET scan, CA19 -9 values) .  The central review board will 
determine RECIST response, PET SUVmax response, unreconstructible disease and NCCN status.  CA19 -9 response will be determined by the central lab.  The site will provide additional 
information to the central review board following the subject’s Safety Follow- up Visit (i.e. 
subject performance status and a summary of any existing medical conditions/contraindications).  Considering all the information provided, the central review 
board (to include  radiologists, surgeons and oncologists) will then determine  whether or not a 
subject is eligible for surgical exploration per protocol.  The central review board will  provide 
their assessment of surgical eligibility to the site  within 5 business days of receipt of all 
required information (approximately 1 week after the Safety F ollow- up Visit ). After the 
recommendation from central review  board is received at the site, the PI  and surgeon will make 
the final decision as to whether or not a subject will undergo surgery. All instances of 
discordance between the determination of eligibility for surgical exploration by the central review board and the action taken by the site with regards to surgical exploration will be 
documented in the clinical database.  
Subjects who undergo surgical exploration within the protocol specified window will be followed for surgic al complications and outcomes per protocol.  Tissue samples will be 
collected during resection and provided to central pathology. 
Subjects who  do not undergo surgical exploration (e.g. subjects who did not complete treatment 
or do not meet any of the protocol defined criteria or had a contraindication to surgery ) will 
continue in the Follow-up period and receive treatment as per standard of care (SOC)  for each 
institution . 
Surgery: 
Surgery will occur at least 4 weeks after the last dose (allowing for a wash -out period from 
treatment) and  only after receipt of the recommendation from the central review board with 
regards to surgical eligibility.  Surgery will occur no longer than 8 weeks after the last dose.  
An outcome of R0 or R1 will be considered a ‘Re section Achieved’ while an outcome of R2 or 
partial  resection will be considered a  ‘Resection Not Achieved’.  Final surgical outcomes for all 
‘Resection Achieved’  subjects will be determined by the central pathology lab.  The 
sponsor/sites remain blinded to the central pathology la b assessments until their final analysis . 
If a subject undergoes surgical exploration, but the surgeon is unable to perform resection (e.g. 
due to identification of metastases or extensive vascular involvement), it will be conside red a 
‘Resection Not Attempted’.  
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
Confidential Page 9 of 82 Surgery will be performed in accordance with institutional standards and SOPs.  Surgeons  
performing surgery for this study will be trained on the protocol , including criteria for surgical 
exploration. All subjects who undergo surgical exploration will be followed for surgical safety 
for 90 days (+/- 3 days) post discharge. 
Safety Follow -up: 
All subjects randomized will have a safety follow -up visit approximately 28 days after the last 
dose of study treatment and a final safety follow -up phone call at 60 days post last dose. 
However, if the investigator becomes aware of a ny serious adverse event  that m ay be possibly 
related to study treatment after this protocol-required reporting period, the investigator may  
report the event to FibroGen within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the 
event. 
Follow-up Period: Subjects will be followed for disease progres sion (if not previously detected) or recurrence 
following resection (local or distant recurrence).  For subjects who complete treatment without 
evidence of disease progression and do not undergo resection, CT scans will continue to be 
performed approximately every 8 weeks and evaluated by central imaging until progression is 
detected (per RECIST 1.1).  For subjects who undergo resection, follow-up CT scans to 
evaluate recurrence of disease will be evaluated by central imaging and performed approximately; every 4 months up to 2 years post- resection and  every 6 months from 2 years to 
5 years post- resection .  The investigator may perform an “off schedule” CT scan at any time 
post resection if recurrence of disease is suspected  clinically; these scans will be su bmitted  to 
central imaging for review and confirmation of recurrence/disease progression.   Subjects in 
follow -up will also be followed  for any additional anti- cancer therapy received  for their 
pancreatic cancer . All subjects will be followed  for survival (until death ) or until study closure 
(expected when the last subject  to complete treatment reaches 18  months post -treatment). 
Guidance was provided to all sites regarding conduct of this clinical trial during the COVID -19 
global pandemic.  Details are also captured within the body of the protocol.

DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established . A DMC charter will 
establish  the rules,  meeting  frequency, and scope of responsibilities  of the committee . 
STATISTICAL METHODS  
Sample Size Calculations : 
The study is planned to enroll approximately  280 subjects with 1:1 randomization ratio to the 
two treatment arms. This sample size is estimated based on the assumption that the median OS 
for the pamrevlumab arm and the placebo arm are 24 and 16.3 months, respectively. This 
improvement represents a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.68.  With this HR, 233 deaths will provide at 
least 80% power with a significance level of 0. 05. With the enrollment of approximately 280 
subjects, 233 deaths are estimated by the end of the Follow-up period. 
Based on the treatment effect on EFS has a hazard ratio 0.60, then 161 events would be required to provide 75% power when using a stratified log- rank statistic with (one -sided) 0.005 
false positive error rate.  
Statistical Analysis Methods:  
Event free survival (EFS) will be used as a surrogate endpoint for OS at a pre- planned interim 
analysis. A hierarchical approach for analysis is described .  If the interim analysis of the effect 
of pamrevlumab on EFS is statistically significant at two -sided p=0.01, then that alpha will be 
carried forward to the final analysis of OS, which then would be conducted at the two-sided 
p=0.05 level.  If the effect of pamrevlumab on EFS is not statistically significant at two -sided 
p=0.01, then the final  analysis of pamrevlumab’s effect on OS would be conducted at the two -
sided p=0.04 level.  
At the time approximately 161 EFS event s occur in the trial (or more depending on completion 
of accrual) , the DMC will conduct an  interim look of OS  for lack of benefit analysis, using an 
O’Brien -Fleming monitoring boundary, if the  EFS analysis reject s the nu ll hypotheses at an 
alpha level of 0.01. Following the completion of the interim analysis for EFS/OS, p rocedures 
will be in place to avoid pre- judgment of OS data by properly maintaining its confidentiality 
until final OS analysis is complete or unless there  is agreement with the Regulatory agency to 
do otherwise. 
All efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the ITT or PP population and safety will be 
analyzed using the safety population. 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 13 of 82  The OS, event -free survival (EFS), and progression -free survival (PFS)  endpoints will be 
analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard model adjusting for randomization stratification 
factors.  
The exploratory endpoints of mean change from baseline during the treatment period in 
physical function by EORTC -QLQ-C30, mean change from baseline during the treatment 
period in abdominal pain by NCI- PRO- CTCAE, m ean change from baseline during the 
treatment period in fatigue by NCI- PRO- CTCAE will be analyzed using a MMRM model. All 
analyses will be adjusted  by the randomization factors.  
Resection rate will be analyzed using Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for 
randomization stratification factors.   
Continuous variables will be presented by descriptive statistics: n, mean, standard deviation  or 
standard error, median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be presented by 
counts of subjects and percentage. Two -sided 95% confidence intervals will be included for the 
key efficacy parameters. 
Safety Analyses:  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized  by treatment arm. Treatment -
emergent deaths, serious TEAEs, TEAEs with grade 3 or 4 per CTCAE criteria, and TEAEs 
leading to study or treatment discontinuation will be summarized separately.  
Surgical complications, clinically significant changes from baseline in vital signs, laboratory 
tests, and ECG s will be assessed . 
Human anti- human antibody data will be summarized in a separate report.  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the applicable regulatory requirement(s), including the archiving of essential documents.

Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 20 of 82  2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Description of Pamrevlumab 
Pamrevlumab is a recombinant fully human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG) kappa monoclona l 
antibody that binds to connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and is being developed for 
treatment of diseases in which tissue fibrosis has a major pathogenic role. These diseases include 
liver fibrosis due to hepatitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, certain fibrotic cancers a nd 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Pamrevlumab (MW ~150 kDa) is produced by 
mammalian Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) fed -batch cell culture system. Pamrevlumab contains 
1,326 amino acids and binds with high affinity to domain 2 of CTGF (dissociation consta nt: 
Kd=0.1–0.2 nM). 
2.2. Locally Advanced Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer 
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis; the median OS is 5 to 8 months and 5-year survival is 8.2% ( SEER, 2018). This positions PDAC to have the worst 
outcome of all gastrointestinal cancers and the fourth leading cause of cancer related mortality.  
The incidence of PDAC increased by 1.2% annually between 2000 and 2012, likely due to increasing incidences of obesity and type II diabetes mellitus in the US and worldwide (American Cancer Society, 2016). 
Pancreatic cancer has notably been resistant to chemotherapy.  Gemcitabine alone has been 
shown to improve PFS and OS and was approved for use in locally advanced and metastatic 
pancreatic cancer in 1996 ( Burris 1997).  Most clinical studies in PDAC focus on patients with 
metastatic disease and have demonstrated only modest improvements in OS.  Recently approved 
therapies include nab -paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine, which improved OS by 1.8 
months compared with gemcitabine alone, and FOLFIRINOX [oxaliplatin, irinotecan, 5 -FU, and 
leucovorin]) alone, which improved OS by 3.7 months compared to gemcitabine  (Von Hoff 2013; Conroy 2011).   
In general, surgical resection offers patients the best chance at long -term survival (5 year 
survival 27%) and possibly a cure, but the majority of patients present with advanced unresectable disease at the time of diagnosis. A large meta -analysis of available therapies from 
1996 to 2009 reported that neoadjuvant therapy increased the resectability rate in unresectable 
and borderline resectable patients to 30%, with the increase of median OS from 10.2 months to 
20.5 months ( Gillen 2010).  This data provides a strong rationale for neoadjuvant therapy 
followed by resection in order to improve OS in LAPC. However, no SOC exists for neoadjuvant 
therapy in patients with LAPC.  
Recent trials in LAPC have explored the effects of single agent chemotherapy in combination 
with radiotherapy on OS ( Mukherjee 2013). A 6 -months treatment with standard- of-care 
chemotherapy alone or chemo- radiation in patients with LAPC only led to a 6% surgical 
resection rate in treated patient s, with a median follow-up of 36.7 months, the median overall 
survival from the date of the first randomization was not significantly different between 
chemotherapy at 16.5 months and chemoradiotherapy at 15.2 months ( p = 0.83). Although the 
LAP07 trial fa iled to show a survival benefit with the use of radiation therapy ( Hammel 2016), 
other trials (e.g., ECOG 4201 [ Loehrer 2011]) have led to the opposite conclusion. In terms of 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 21 of 82  treatment, there has also been an increased interest in combination chemotherapi es followed by 
surgery with curative intent (Dean 2016, Hammel  2016) for LAPC patients.  
In the LAPACT trial, the neoadjuvant therapy with gemcitabine/nab- paclitaxel was used in 110 
LAPC patients for 6 cycles. The resection rate established in this trial was 15%, and 1  year OS 
rate was 72% (long term OS not reported to date). This trial establishes benchmark resection rate 
for LAPC patients following combination therapy with gemcitabine/nab -paclitaxel  
(Hammel 2018 ). 
Significant progress has been  made in recent years with systematic chemotherapies of LAPC. In 
a study using a nab -paclitaxel plus gemcitabine combination, 77% of 177 patients had at least a 
50% reduction in CA19-9 levels, and CA19-9 response was found to be an independent 
prognostic factor for OS ( Reni 2017). In the LAPACT study , serum CA19-9 concentrations 
decreased after 6 cycles of chemotherapy in most patients and 15 % of them underwent curative-
intent surgery  (Philip 2020) . In a meta -analysis about FOLFIRI NOX in LAPC, the authors 
reported a median OS of 24.2 months; in addition, 25 (9%) of patients could have a  surgical 
resectio n, of whom 78 (4%) had an R0 resection (Suker 2016). 
In LAPC, a novel endpoint is needed that would have considerable reliability in predicting the effects on OS of both neoadjuvant therapies and surgical resection.  Surgery has not only a therapeutic role in LAPC, but also a diagnostic role in our proposed definition of EFS, in that it is used to assess local disease-free status at the end of induction therapy.  However, to achieve sensitivity as well to the presence and the impact of microscopic distal disease, the proposed definition of EFS is based on time to detected disease, either through surgery for local disease or, in a manner analogous to ‘DFS in the adjuvant setting,’ through subsequent detection of local or distal disease by CT, or to death.  
The LAPC patient population represents a high unmet need as no standard of care has been 
established in prospective, randomized trials. At the same time, increasing efficacy of 
neoadjuvant therapies in LAPC justifies revisiting study endpoint in order to bet ter reflect 
treatment efficacy beyond effects on duration of OS.  Based on our nonclinical tumor model data 
and clinical data we believe that pamrevlumab with its antifibrotic mechanism of action and when combined in a neoadjuvant setting with SOC chemotherapy, may provide the unique 
opportunity to impact both event-free survival in LAPC and OS.  
2.2.1. Relevance of Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF) in Pancreatic Cancer 
Connective tissue growth factor is a secreted glycoprotein produced by fibroblasts and 
myofibroblasts, endothelial cells, activated stellate cells, and other cell types.  Its expression is 
induced by a variety of regulatory modulators, including TGF-β and vascular endothelial growth 
factor, as well as environmental conditions such as hypoxia, pressure, and increased tissue 
stiffness.  Cellular functions modulated by CTGF include secretion and/or organization of 
extracellular matrix, cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, migration, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition.  Thes e biological activities are associated with aberrant tissue repair 
(i.e., fibrosis) and tumorigenesis. Elevated CTGF expression is detected in many tumor types, in particular, PDAC and invasive breast carcinoma ( Wenger 1999, Xie 2001).  Among 19 samples 
of pancreatic tumors, 15 showed an average 59 -fold increase of CTGF expression, compared 
with a 4.5- fold increase observed in chronic pancreatitis ( Wenger 1999). CTGF was identified as 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 22 of 82  an invasion- specific gene in PDAC ( Ryu 2001) and is highly expressed withi n the neoplastic 
epithelium ( Iacobuzio-Donahue 2002).  In any specific tumor, CTGF can be expressed by PDAC 
tumor cells, by stellate or stromal cells within the tumor, or by both cell types (Hidalgo 2012, 
Wenger 1999, Iacobuzio-Donahue 2002, Frazier 1997, H artel 2004).  
2.3. Rationale  
2.3.1. Nonclinical Studies  
FibroGen has evaluated the efficacy/pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and nonclinical safety of pamrevlumab per ICH guidelines to support the clinical development of pamrevlumab in pancreatic cancer.  Pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in various tumor models to 
evaluate pamrevlumab as a modulator of tumor cell survival, chemoresistance, and tumor cell invasion/migration. The pharmacokinetics of pamrevlumab have been characterized following single oral doses in rat s, rabbits, and monkeys and after repeated oral doses in toxicity studies in 
mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. The nonclinical safety of pamrevlumab was evaluated in repeated dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and monkeys. Cross -Reactivity studies with 
pamrevlumab have been conducted with mouse and human tissues. The potential effects of 
pamrevlumab on wound healing have been evaluated in an abdominal wound healing model in 
rats. 
Summaries of all completed, nonclinical studies supporting the pancreatic canc er indication can 
be found in the current version of the  Investigator’s Brochure. 
2.3.2. Clinical Studies  
Pamrevlumab is in clinical development for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The Sponsor has conducted 2 clinical studies in pancreatic cancer: Study FGCL -MC3019-028 (Study 028) was 
completed in June 2014 and Study FGCL-3019-069 (Study 069) in which the study treatment and surgery periods have been completed and analyzed. 
The results of Study 028, an open label study, indicate that pamrevlumab can be safely combined 
with gemcitabine and erlotinib without increased toxicity in advanced Stage 3 and Stage 4 
pancreatic cancer patients. The efficacy results (including positive drug -biomarker activity) show 
potential survival benefit with pamrevlumab treatment, combined with gemcitabine and erlotinib, 
particularly in subjects with higher Day 15 pamrevlumab Cmin values. These results underscore 
the potential validity of combined treatments that target both stroma and cancer cells in PDAC. Finally, the results also in dicate the potential value of CTGF as a predictive biomarker and 
support further evaluation of pamrevlumab in combination with chemotherapy in a properly controlled and adequately powered study comparing SOC chemotherapy to SOC plus pamrevlumab.  
The encouraging results from Study 028 led to the initiation of the Phase 1/2 study, Study 069, using gemcitabine/nab- paclitaxel +/ - pamrevlumab in a neoadjuvant setting. 
In Study 069, the addition of pamrevlumab to gemcitabine and nab- paclitaxel appears to 
positively impact eligibility for surgical exploration and resection rates in the treatment arm when compared to control. Seventy- one percent (17/24 patients) were eligible for surgical 
exploration in the treatment arm compared to 15% (2/13 patients) in the control arm. Thirty -three 
percent (8/37 patients) were resected in the treatment arm (4 -R0, 4- R1) compared to 8% (1/13 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 23 of 82  patients) in  the control arm (1 -R0). The expanded criteria used to determine surgical eligibility 
by inclusion of CA 19.9 and PET response allowed patients who otherwise would not be eligible 
to undergo surgical exploration. 
In this ongoing study, the TEAEs have been similar to what was seen in the previous pancreatic 
cancer study with pamrevlumab (Study 028) and are consistent with what has been observed in 
pancreatic cancer patients treated with gemcitabine and nab -paclitaxel.  To date, there are no 
apparent safety si gnals associated with the addition of pamrevlumab to gemcitabine and nab-
paclitaxel, and the triple combination appears to be well tolerated by subjects with LAPC. 
The improved eligibility for surgical exploration and resection rates in the treatment arm when 
compared to the control, provide direct rationale for the development of a larger Phase 3 study. 
Summaries of all completed, clinical studies supporting the pancreatic cancer indication can be 
found in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure. 
2.3.3. Dose Rationale 
Analysis of data from a dose finding study FGCL-3019- 028 (Study 028) supported the dose 
regimen used in the Phase 1/2 study FGCL-3019- 069 (Study 069). In Study 028, pamrevlumab 
was tested in combination with gemcitabine and erlotinib in subjects with Stage 3 or 4 pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma.  
The efficacy analyses indicated potential survival benefit, particularly in those subjects with 
greater pamrevlumab Day 15 C min values.  Highe r pamrevlumab C min values lower baseline 
CTGF levels (<median) were associated with longer median OS and higher 1 -year OS rates, 
prolonged PFS, and CA19-9 reductions in this study population. For example, a Day 15 C min 
level ≥ 150 µg/mL compared to < 150  µg/mL was associated with statistically significantly  
longer OS (9.0 vs 4.4 months [p=0.0244]) and a greater proportion of subjects surviving to at 
least 1 year  (34.2% vs 10.8% [p=0.0258]). 
The analysi s of final data showed that a pamrevlumab  dose of 35 mg/kg given biweekly resulted 
a mean Day 15 C min values of > 150 µg/mL (mean ± SD of 169 ± 47 µg/mL). The next dose 
level (45 mg /kg biweekly) did not increase the mean Day 15 C min values (mean  ± SD of 166 ± 63 
µg/mL).  Therefore, a dose of 35 mg/kg biweekly is supported based on these efficacy analyses.  
Additionally, a dose justification evaluation was performed with data from Phase 1 dose 
escalation studies as well as data from FGCL -3019- 028 and FGCL -3019-069 using exposure-
efficacy analysis.  The summary of the exposure- efficacy analysis is below : 
Justification for Pamrevlumab Dose of 35 mg/kg Q2W for LAPC 
• A regimen of pamrevlumab of 35 mg/kg Q2W increases the percent of subjects 
eligible for surgery  and achieving resection in LAPC.  
• Exposure- response models for resection predicts that increasing the dose to 45  mg/kg 
Q2W only increases the probability of resection by 2% while decreasing the dose to 25 mg/kg Q2W decreases the probability by 4% 
 
 
 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 24 of 82  Secondary Evidence from Study 028 (88% M etastatic)  
• The dose-response (1-yr OS) model predicts that OS plateaus beyond 25 mg/kg. The 
dose-response model predicts that increasing the dose from 35 to 45 mg/kg Q2W only 
increases the probability of 1 -yr OS by 1%, while decreasing the dose to 25 mg/kg 
Q2W d ecreases the probability by 4%. 
Safety A ssessment  
• No relationship between reported serious TEAEs and exposure when pamrevlumab was combined with Gemcitabine and E rlotinib (Study 028)  
• No relationship between reported serious TEAEs when pamrevlumab was combined with Gemcitabine and Nab -paclitaxel (Study 069) 
Based on the above, the dose regimen and duration for this study is the same as previously 
evaluated in Study FGCL-3019-069 (35 mg/kg Q2W) .  This dose will be administered  in 
combination with either the  G/NP or FOLFIRINOX treatment regimen.   
2.3.4. Safety  Summary  
In Study 028, pamrevlumab was tested in combination with gemcitabine and erlotinib in chemotherapy naïve subjects with Stage 3 an d 4 pancreatic adenocarcinoma. All 75  subjects 
were included in the Safety population and at least 1 TEAE was reported for each. A total of 65 
subjects had ≥ 1 TEAE following the first dose of pamrevlumab but prior to the administration of other study drugs.  The most frequently reported TEAEs after the administration of pamrevlumab 
and prior to gemcitabine and erlotinib were nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, decreased 
appetite, and fatigue. The most common TEAEs reported following the administration of 
chemotherapy were : fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. There was no 
apparent imbalance between the cohorts or dose dependent effect in the type or severity of TEAEs . 
In Study 069, 37 subjects were enrolled in an overall 2:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms; pamrevlumab with gemcitabine plus nab -paclitaxel (Arm A) or gemcitabine plus nab -paclitaxel 
alone (Arm B).  Twenty -four subjects were randomized to Arm A and 13 subjects were 
randomized to Arm B. All 37 subjects were included in the Safety population. Overall, a total of 36 subjects had at least 1 TEAE; 24 subjects in Arm A and 12 subjects in Arm B.  The most 
common TEAEs reported in Arm A vs. Arm B were : fatigue (75.0% vs 76.9%), nausea (70.8% 
vs 53.8%), alopecia (66.7% vs 53.8%), edema peripheral (58.3% vs 38.5%), decreased appetite (50% vs 38.5%) and diarrhea (50.0% vs 53.8%). 
The only TEAE assessed by the Investigator as possible related to pamrevlumab but not to 
gemcitabine/nab -paclitaxel was an influenza like illness in one subject that was Grade 1 and non -
serious.  The majority of TEAEs reported are listed as an adverse drug reaction in the product 
labeling for gemcitabine and/or nab- paclitaxel.  
There were no notable changes in laboratory results, vital signs, electrocardiograms, or physical 
findings. Overall, TEAEs were typical of those observed in subjects with the underlying medical condition and/or typical of adverse reactions associated with gemcitabine and nab -paclitaxel. To 
date, there are no apparent safety signals associat ed with the addition of pamrevlumab to

4.1. Overall Study Design 
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double- blind trial to evaluate the  efficacy  and safety of  
neoadjuvant treatment with  pamrevlumab or placebo in combination with either G/NP  or 
FOLFIRINOX,  in the treatment of locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAPC) 
subjects. Approximately 280 subjects will be enrolled in th is trial, across approximately 
100 study centers in the following locations: North America , Europe  and Asia Pacific. 
Investigators will hav e the option to choose between prescribing either G/NP or FOLFIRINOX 
prior to randomization.  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the addition of either pamrevlumab  or placebo to 
the prescribed chemotherapy treatment regimen (G/NP or FOLFIRINOX) . Subjects will be 
stratified at randomization  by chemotherapy treatment regimen (G/NP or FOLFIRINOX),  SMA 
encasement  (> or ≤ 180 degree) , unreconstructible disease and geographic region. 
This trial has five  study periods:  
• Screening  
• Neoadjuvant Treatment 
• Evaluation for Surgical Exploration  
• Surgery 
• Follow-up 
In the screening period, subjects will be evaluated per the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria to 
determine  eligibility for participation  in this trial.  Protocol assessments will be completed during 
the screening period in accordance with SOA (see Appendix 1) to establish a baseline profile, 
including: demographics, medical history, clinical status and disease stage for each subject.  
During screening, a central review board  (including radiologists and surgeons) will confirm 
subjects have locally advanced, unresectable disease prior to enrollment.  This central review 
board will also review each subjects’ baseline CT scan to determine the degree of SMA 
encasement and whether or not they have unreconstructible disease for the purposes of 
stratification at randomization.  See Section  7.1.1 for details.  
In the Neoadjuvant Treatment period, randomized subjects will receive up to  6 cycles 
(~24-30 weeks)  of study treatment. Subjects’ clinical sta tus and safety will be evaluated  
regularly along with e fficacy assessments to evaluate subjects’  quality of life and disease state as 
described in Section  7 and the SOA (Appendix 1). If disease progression is noted during the 
treatment period, subjects will be discontinued from study treatment.  Subjects who discontinue treatment early  for any reason will complete End of Treatment (EOT) visit and continue in the 
Follow-up period. Subjects who complete study treatment will be evaluated to determine 
eligibility for surgical exploration and may undergo surgical resection prior to continuing in the 
Follow-up period. 
For overall Safety Follow -up, all subjects enrolled will have a safety  follow -up visit 
approximately 28 days after the last dose of study treatment and a final safety follow -up phone 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 29 of 82  call at approximately 60 days post last dose . For details regarding safety follow - up and 
reporting, see Section  8. 
Eligibility for surgical exploration will be evaluated for all subjects who complete study 
treatment ( i.e. at least 11 of 13 planned doses of pamrevlumab or placebo and at least one dose  of 
pamrevlumab or placebo in each cycle and no withdrawal of treatment due to AE or other 
reasons ). The site will be required to provide information following the subject’s EOT visit (i.e. 
CT scan, PET scan, CA19 -9 values) and Safety Follow-up V isit (i.e. performance status and a 
summary of any existing medical conditions/contraindications) to the central review board  (to 
include radiologists, surgeons and oncologists) who will then determine whether or not a subject 
is eligible for surgical exploration per protocol. The central review board will provide their 
assessment of surgical eligibility to the site  within 5 business days of receipt of all the required 
information (approximately 1 week after the Safety Follow -up Visit).  After the recommendation 
from central review board has been received by the site, the PI and surgeon will make the final 
decision as to whether or not a subject will undergo surgery. All instances of discordance 
between the determination of eligibility for surgical exploration by the central review board and 
the action taken by the site with regards to surgical exploration will be documented in the clinical 
database.  See Section  7.1.3 for details.  
Subjects who  do not undergo surgical exploration (e.g. did not complete study treatment, do not 
meet any of the protocol -defined criteria for surgical eligibility or have a contraindication to 
surgery, or site decision not to proceed with surgery ) will continue in the Follow -up period and 
be followed for progression, survival and additional anti- cancer therapies.  
Surgery will occur a t least 4 weeks after last dose (allowing for a wash -out period from 
treatment) and only after receipt of the recommendation from the central review board with 
regards to surgical eligibility.  Surgery will occur no longer than 8 weeks after the last dose.  
An outcome of R0 or R1 will be considered a  ‘Resection Achieved’ while an outcome of R2 or 
partial  resection will be considered a  ‘Resection Not Achieved’.  Final surgical outcomes (R0 
and R1)  for all ‘Resection Achieved’ subjects will be determined by the central pathology lab.  
The sp onsor/sites remain blinded to the central pathology lab assessment until their final 
analysis. 
If a subject undergoes surgical exploration, but the surgeon is unable to perform resection (e.g. 
due to identification of metastases or extensive vascular involvement), it will be considered as 
‘Resection Not Attempted’.  
All subjects who undergo surgical exploration within the protocol specified window will have 
tissue collected and sent to central pathology for review and  will be followed for surgical 
complicati ons for 90 days post discharge. 
In the Follow-up period, all  subjects will be followed for disease progression  (if not previously 
detected ) or recurrence (local or distant ) following resection.  Subjects will be followed for 
survival and any additional anti- cancer therapy received  for their pancreatic cancer  until the last 
subject to complete treatment has been followed for approximately 18 months post- last dose (i.e. 
at this time it is expected that 233 death events will have occurred to support final analysis of 
OS).  Subjects may  receive second line therapy at t he investigator’s discretion.  
A schematic overview of the study is provided in Figure 1. A detailed overview of assessments 
and the timing of assessments is provided in Appendix 1 and 2. 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 30 of 82  4.1.1. Estimated Study Duration  
It is anticipated that enrollment will be complete within 3 -4 years from first subject enrolled. All 
subjects will complete up to 6 cycles of study treatment and at least 60 days of safety follow-up 
post last dose . All subjects will be followed in the Follow -up Period until the total number of 
deaths reported reaches 233 or the sponsor terminates the study .  It is anticipated that 233 deaths 
will occur by the time the last subject to complete treatment has been followed for approximately 
18 months. Therefore, some subjects could remain on study for approximately 6 years.

4.1.2. Randomization 
Approximately 280 subjects will be prescribed treatment with either G/NP or FOLFIRINOX, 
and then randomized 1:1 to receive either pamrevlumab or placebo, resulting in approximately 
140 subjects per treatment arm.  Each subject will receive a unique study ID number in the 
screening and randomization process.  Details are outlined in the randomization plan. 
Subjects will be stratified at randomization according to the following factors:  
• Chemotherapy treatment regimen (G/NP or FOLFIRINOX) 
• SMA encasement (> or ≤ 180°) 
• Unreconstructible disease (y es or no) 
• Geographic r egion ( North America /Europe or Asia  Pacifi c) 
Each region represents a specific surgical skills or general surgical outcomes and as subjects are 
randomized, the Interactive Response System (IXRS) will assign the treatment arms dynamically to ensure an equal distribution of subjects in both treatment groups across each region. Countries 
will be assigned to one of the two regions based on their general standard of care and surgical 
performance.

Arm B: placebo + either G/NP  or FOLFIRINOX  
4.2. Blinding  
This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The Investigator, study site staff, subjects, and 
selected Sponsor study team and designees are blinded to study drug assignment. 
4.2.1. Maintenance of Blinding  
The study blind will be maintained for all parties specified above throughout the study with the 
excep tion of the scenarios outlined in  Section  4.2.2 . and 4.2.3. Pamrevlumab and placebo will be 
identical in appearance, packaging, a nd labeling in order to maintain the study blind.  
4.2.2. Planned and Unplanned Unblinding of Treatment Assignment  
Investigators, study site staff and subjects will remain blinded to treatment assignments until study completion. 
Any unplanned, intentional or unintentional, breaking of the blind should be reported and 
documented. Breaking the blind (for a single subject) should be considered only when knowledge of the treatment assignment is deemed essential by the Investigator for the subject’s 
care. All P rincipal Investigators are granted access to the IRT system and assigned a role which 
will allow them to rapidly unblind a patient in the event of an emergency.  It is not required to 
discuss this action with the sponsor (or designee) prior to its execution.   
4.2.3. Unblinding of Treatment Assignment for Interim Analysis  
Details regarding the maintenance of the blind for the study team, sites and other staff during the 
interim analysis will be provided in a Data Access Plan.

6.1. Study Treatment
Study t reatment is administered over a 28 -day cycle, for up to six cycles. If dosing delays occur 
due to AEs or scheduling conflicts, for example, it is accept able to extend a single treatment 
cycle to a total of 42 days and the neoadjuvant treatment period by an additional 6 weeks.  
Therefore, t he total duration of the neoadjuvant treatment period could be approximately 24-30 
weeks.   
Information regarding storage, handling, preparation and administration  of pamrevlumab can be 
found in the FG-3019 Investigator’s Brochure and the study IP Manual . This information for the 
chemotherapy agents, gemcitabine, nab -paclitaxel  and FOLFIRINOX, can be found in the 
package inserts for the products. 
6.1.1. Pamrevlumab (FG -3019) or Placebo  
The dose, route, infusion rate and schedule for the administration of pamrevlumab is provided in 
Table  1. 
Table  1: FG-3019 (or Placebo): Dose, Route, and Administration 
Agent  Dose  Route  Frequency  Infusion Rate

after completion of chemotherapy 
infusions  
Note:  DO NOT ADMINSITER FG -3019 AS AN IV PUSH OR BOLUS INJECTION, OR CONCURRENTLY 
IN THE IV LINE WITH OTHER AGENTS.  
Dosing for pamrevlumab (or placebo) will be based on the weight obtained on Day 1 of each 
dosing Cycle (i.e. Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1, etc). The total dose of pamrevlumab (or 
placebo) is not to exceed 4.1g. Subjects weighing more than 117kg will receive the maximum allowable dose of 4.1g. The volume of fluid infused must not exceed 410mL. 
If split visit scheduling is implemented, the subject may be scheduled for a visit  one day prior to 
dosing to complete study procedures per SOA .  In these instances, it is acceptable to use the 
weight collected the day prior to dosing to calculate the dose. 
6.1.2. Gemcitabine and Nab -paclitaxel  
The dose, route, and schedule for administration of gemcitabine and nab -paclitaxel used in both 
treatment arms  is provided in Table  2.

The dose, route and schedule for administration of FOLFIRINOX used in both treatment arms is 
provided in Table 3.  The regimen below represents full dose FOLFIRINOX.  Modified 
FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX) may be administered at the investigator’s discretion.  
Typically, for mFOLFIRINOX, the Irinotecan dose is reduced by 25% and the fluorouracil bolus dose is reduced by 20%.  Th is mFOLFIRINOX regimen has been associated with good 
tolerability and comparable efficacy when compared to the full dose ( Cavanna et al  2019) .  
Investi gators may also administer a mFOLFIRINOX regimen per their institutional guideline s.  
The different chemotherapy agents used in the FOLFIRINOX regimen are administered in the

6.1.4.1. Dose Om issions and Modified Schedules  (Gemcitabine plus Nab -paclitaxel)  
Day 1 Dose  
If both chemotherapy agents (G  + NP) are held on Day 1 of the cycle, dosing with 
pamrevlumab or pla cebo should be delayed.  The cycle will not be considered to start until 
the day the study treatment is actually administered to the subject (ie,  1-2-3- Rest, X -1-2-3-
Rest, 1 -2-3-Rest, etc).  If only one chemotherapy agent is held (G or NP) on Day 1, dosing 
with pamrevlumab or placebo should be administered.   
Day 8 Dose  
In Cycle 1, if one or both chemotherapy agents are held  on Day 8, dosing with pamrevlumab 
or placebo should continue on schedule.  The Day 8 visit may also be delayed and given in 
combinati on with chemotherapy if the investigator feels the subject will be able to tolerate 
chemotherapy treatment at a later date.  Any delay of more than two weeks should be 
discussed with the medical monitor.  In all subsequent cycles (2 -6), dosing with 
pamrevl umab or placebo does not occur on Day 8 visit so the c ycle continues per protocol 
with one dose of chemotherapy not given/missed  (ie, 1 -2-3- Rest, 1 -X-3- Rest,  1-2-3- Rest).  
Day 15 Dose  
If chemotherapy agents are held or missed  on Day 15 of the cycle, dosing with pamrevlumab 
or placebo should continue on schedule followed by a week of rest to complete the 28-day 
cycle if the investigator feels this is safe and in the subject’s best interest .  However, the Day 
15 visit may also b e delayed and given in combination with chemotherapy if the investigator 
feels the subject will be able to tolerate chemotherapy treatment at a later date.  Any delay of more than two weeks should be discussed with the medical monitor.   
If all chemotherapy agents are withdrawn  (permanently discontinued), dosing with pamrevlumab 
or placebo must also be withdrawn.  Subjects will be discontinued from study treatment and continue in the Follow-up Period. 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 39 of 82  6.1.4.2. Dose Omissions and Modified Schedules  (FOLFIRINOX)  
Day 1 Dose  
If all chemotherapy agents are held or missed on Day 1 of the cycle, dosing with 
pamrevlumab or placebo should be delayed.  The cycle will not be considered to start until 
the day the dose is actually administered to the subject (ie,  1-2-3- Rest, X -1-2-3- Rest, 1 -2-3-
Rest, etc).   If only some chemotherapy agents are held on Day 1, dosing with pamrevlumab 
or placebo should be administered.   
Day 8 Dose (Cycle 1 only) Pamrevlumab or placebo is administered on Day 8 of Cycle 1 only.  Delays to the Day 8 dose 
in Cycle 1 should be discussed with the medical monitor. 
Day 15 Dose  If chemotherapy agents are held or missed on Day 15 of the cycle, dosing with pamrevlumab 
or placebo should continue on schedule followed by a week of rest to complete the 28-day 
cycle if the investigator feels this is safe and in the subject’s best interest.  However, the Day 15 visit may also be delayed and given in combination with chemotherapy if the investigator 
feels the subject will be able to tolerate chemotherapy treatment a t a later date.  Any delay of 
more than two weeks should be discussed with the medical monitor.   
If all chemotherapy agents are withdrawn (permanently discontinued), dosing with pamrevlumab or placebo must also be withdrawn.  Subjects will be discontinued from study treatment and 
continue in the Follow-up Period. 
6.1.4.3. Dose Modifications 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to modify the doses of gemcitabine and/or nab- paclitaxel  in 
accordance with the product package insert  guidelines for managing toxicities .   
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to modify the doses of FOLFIRINOX or mFOLFIRINOX in 
accordance with local or institutional guidance for managing toxicities.   
Chem otherapy doses may be further modified, withheld or withdrawn at the investigator’s 
discretion in the interest of subject safety and tolerability.    
Dose modifications for pamrevlumab are not allowed.  However, if an infusion reaction is 
suspected the inf usion may be slowed, temporarily stopped or completely stopped before the full 
dose is administe red (s ee Section 6.2.6 for details) . 
6.1.5. Treatment Compliance  
All treatments are administered at the investigational site by qualified personnel and documented 
in the corresponding case report form (CRF).  
Subjects must receive at least 11 doses of pamrevlumab or placebo to be considered as having 
completed all treatment cycles.  Only one dose of pamrevlumab/placebo may be omitted per 
treatment cycle an d no more than two doses total for a subject to be considered compliant and as 
having completed all cycles of treatment.  If two consecutive doses of pamrevlumab/placebo are omitted or more than two doses total within the treatment period are omitted for a  subject, they 
will be considered as having not completed all cycles of treatment due to non -compliance with 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 40 of 82  study drug.  Delays of more than 2 weeks or interruptions (missed doses) that exceed two 
consecutive doses should be discussed with the medical monitor.   
6.1.6. Concomitant Medications  
6.1.6.1. Permitted Concomitant Medications  
Regular supportive care as clinically indicated is permitted during this trial.  
6.1.6.1.1. COVID- 19 Vaccines  
FibroGen recommends a time separation between the administration of a COVID -19 vaccine and 
blinded study drug (pamrevlumab or placebo) of at least 48 hours.  While there are not safety 
concerns anticipated with the co -administration of pamrevlumab and COVID -19 vaccines, the 
time separation may allow for better interpretation of any adverse events  and their relationship to 
the vaccine or study drug.    
6.1.6.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Pamrevlumab  should not be administered to subjects with a history of allergic or anaphylactic 
reaction to human, humanized, or chimeric monoclonal antibodies. 
Gemci tabine, nab- paclitaxel  or FOLFIRINOX agents  should not be administered to subjects with 
a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to these products or their excipients. Radiation therapy  and/or chemotherapy other than that prescribed per protocol is not allowed 
during the neoadjuvant treatment period and prior to surgical exploration. 
Certain d rugs that inhibit or induce CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 should be used with caution during 
study therapy administration.   Specifically those outlined below: 
CYP2C8 and  CYP3A4 
Inhibitors   CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 
Inducers  
Ketoconazole   Rifampicin  
Imidazole antifungals   Carbamazepine  
Erythromycin   Phenytoin  
Fluoxetine   Efavirenz  
Gemfibrozil   Nevirapine  
Clopidogrel   
Cimetidine   
Ritonavir   
Saquinavir   
Indinavir   
Nelfinavir   
 
If a subject is taking a CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer listed above as a chronic medication (i.e. long term use to manage an element of their medical history) at the time they are being screened for the trial and they cannot switch to  a different medication, they should be 
excluded from the trial.  Additionally, the use of the CYP inhibitors an inducers listed above should be avoided and only used with caution during the study for all patients receiving treatment with Nab -paclitaxel  or FOLFIRINOX.    
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 41 of 82  Live vaccines are prohibited for subjects receiving the G/NP or FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy 
regimen during study therapy administration and for 3 months after the last dose of study 
therapy. 
Interactions between the gemcitabine , nab- paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX and concomitant 
medications are described in their respective package inserts.   
With regards to restrictions or recommendations related to chemotherapy agents, the sponsor’s 
expectation and guidance is that each site follow the product label over the protocol as labels can 
vary by product, country, manufacturer, etc. and offer the most up to date guidance for 
investigators to safely manage the treatment of their patients.  
6.1.6.3. Contraception Requirements  
A non- clinical study evaluating the potential effects of pamrevlumab on embryo -fetal 
development has not been conducted. No adverse effects of pamrevlumab administration were observed in a study of rat male and female fertility.  This study also includes tr eatment with 
chemotherapy agents which are potentially genotoxic. 
Therefore, female subjects of childbearing potential are required to use highly effective  
contraception methods during the conduct of the study and for 6 months after the last dose of 
study drug. 
Male subjects with partners of childbearing potential are required to use highly effective  
contraception methods during the conduct of the study and for 6 months after the last dose of 
study drug. 
Investigators should counsel male subjects on the con servation of sperm prior to treatment due to 
the possibility of irreversible infertility/testicular damage due to the therapy with nab -paclitaxel 
and gemcitabine as noted in the SmPCs. 
Additionally, investigators should counsel subjects on any additional c ontraceptive requirements 
outlined in the SmPCs for the prescribed chemotherapy agents. 
A woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post- menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization  methods 
include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. (CTGF, 2014) 
6.2. Study Drug Materials and Management 
This section of the protocol provides information and instruction regarding pamrevlumab 
(or placebo).  Similar information for the chemotherapy agents can be found in the package inserts for those products. Additional details regarding study drug material and management can 
be found in the Study Investigational Product (IP) Manual. 
6.2.1. FibroGen Investigational Product (Pamr evlumab ) or Placebo  
Pamrevlumab is a fully human IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to CTGF and is 
formulated as solution for administration by IV infusion.  
Matching placebo is formulated as solution to be administered in a manner that is identical to 
pamrevlumab infusion. 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 42 of 82  6.2.2. Formulation  
Pamrevlumab is supplied in single- use glass vials containing either 10 mL or 50 mL of a sterile, 
preservative -free solution (100 mg pamrevlumab/vial or 500 mg pamrevlumab/vial, 
respectively).  The solution is composed of 10 mg/mL pamrevlumab, 1.60 mg/mL L- histidine, 
3.08 mg/mL L-histidine HCl, 8.01 mg/mL sodium chloride, and 0.05 mg/mL polysorbate 20, 
resulting  in a solution with a tonicity of approximately 290 mmol/kg and a pH of 6.0. 
The placebo formulation is of identical composition as the pamrevlumab formation, except for 
the absence of pamrevlumab.  
6.2.3. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
Labels will be prepared and will comply with Good Manufacturing Practice and local regulatory 
guideli nes. 
6.2.4. Study Drug Storage  
Vials of pamrevlumab and placebo must be stored refrigerated (2°C to 8°C), in a temperature - 
controlled and monitored environment, in the carton provided and protected from light, and in a securely locked area to which access is lim ited to appropriate study personnel. Documentation of 
the storage conditions must be maintained by the site for the entire period of study participation. 
Details regarding the reporting of temperature excursions can be found in the study IP Manual. 
6.2.5. Study D rug Preparation  
Pamrevlumab  or placebo is infused undiluted after pooling the contents of the calculated number 
of vials in an empty infusion bag (total volume of fluid must not exceed 410 mL), according to 
the Dose Preparation Instructions in the Investigational Product (IP) Manual.  
Once prepared, the IP infusion is stable at room temperature for up to 6 hours. Otherwise, if 
prepared IP is not used immediately it should be stored and refrigerated at 2 -8ºC (to prevent 
microbial growth, as it does not contain preservatives) and used within 48 hours or be discarded.   
Pamrevlumab  or placebo infusion solutions are administered by IV infusion, using an infusion 
set with a 0.2 µm in- line filter.  
6.2.6. Study Drug Administration  
Pamrevlumab/placebo infusion should be administered over 1 hour ± 15 minutes. Subjects 
should be carefully monitored for reaction during the first infusion with a physician available as needed. Subjects will remain at the study site for 1 hour after the end of the infusion for clinical 
observation.  The post-infusion observation period may be reduced to 30 minutes if the subject 
has had no infusion-related AEs for three consecutive infusions. The IV access should remain in place and be maintained per site procedures until the end of this post treatment observation 
period. If a subject has an infusion reaction, the infusion rate may be slowed or temporarily 
stopped, depending on the severity of symptoms. If a subject experiences an infusion reaction and continues pamrevlumab dosing, a physician must be immediately available during 
subsequent infusions and observation periods until the subject does not have any infusion 
reaction for three sequential infusions.  
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 43 of 82  Pamrevlumab will be administered in a hospital or ambulatory setting with adequate facilities for 
managing medical emergencies for at least three infusions to confirm the subject does not have 
an infusion reaction. The study site must have trained staff and medications for the treatment of 
acute reactions, including anaphylaxis, immediately available. There is no specific treatment for a pamrevlumab overdose or infusion reaction. Signs and symptoms should be managed with 
appropriate standard of care treatment.  
Premedication, such as antihistamines, corticosteroids or nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) are not normally administered before infusions of pamrevlumab.  
Premedication may be used for subjects who experience infusion reactions at the discretion of 
the investigator after discussion with the Medical Monitor.  
6.2.7. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
All study drug provided by the Sponsor should be retained at the site until otherwise instructed in 
writing by the Sponsor (or designee). The Sponsor (or designee) will perform drug accountability 
and reconciliation for all study drug received at the site prior to approving study drug return/destruction.  Upon completion of accountability/reconciliation or upon completion of the 
study or termination of the investigational site, all used, unused, partially used study drug, and all study drug that was not dispensed will be shipped to a destruction site designated by the Sponsor (or designee) for destruction.  Study drug may be destroyed on site according to local/institutional 
policies by the pharmacy/authorized staff with approval from Sponsor (or designee). Please refer to the IP  Returns Instruction Manual for additional information on study drug accountability.

 Confidential Page 44 of 82  7. ASSESSMENTS OF EFFICACY  
7.1. Study Assessments  
A signed and dated IRB/IEC-approved informed consent must be obtained before any study-
specific assessments are performed. Assessments that are part of routine  care are not considered 
study- specific and may be used at screening to determine eligibility. All subjects will be 
screened for eligibility before enrollment. Only eligible subjects will be enrolled into the study 
and randomized. 
During the COVID- 19 global pandemic, all sites were approved to conduct study assessments 
(i.e. physical exams, AE/CM review, etc) via telehealth visits if this was the only feasible option 
available.  
7.1.1. Screening Period  
All screening procedures must be performed within 30 days of Cycle 1 Day 1. Study procedures 
to be performed during the screening period can be found in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Appendix 1 ).  In order to avoid unnecessarily repeating study screening procedures (i.e. C T 
scans that would increase radiation exposure risk, delays due to COVID, etc) short extensions  
(up to 14 days maximum) to the screening window may be granted with prior approval from the Medical Monitor.    
Sites must confirm that all inclusion criteria (s ee Section  5.1) have been met and no exclusion 
criteria (see Section  5.2) have been met prior to maki ng a request for randomization.  A 
diagnostic biopsy is required for histological confirmation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).  Central laboratory samples will be collected and the results will be used to determine 
eligibility.  CT scans will b e sent to the central review  board for evaluation to confirm subjects 
have locally advanced unresectable disease. If the site has performed additional staging procedures per SOC (i.e. laparoscopy or staging MRI) that indicate metastatic disease, these 
results may also be considered  by the site  in the final determination of eligibility.  
All subjects will be entered in IXRS and those who are eligible for participation will be 
randomized in the trial. All randomized subjects will be entered in the clinical database (EDC).  
7.1.1.1. Role of Central Review in Determining Eligibility for Participation and Defining 
Stratification Factors  
A central review board (to include radiologists and surgeons) will confirm  subjects have locally 
advanced unresectable disease prior to enr ollment through a review of the CT scan 
(per RECIST  1.1 and NCCN Version 2.2018) collected during screening. If available, any 
additional clinical data (i.e. MRIs, biopsy results , and  historical CT scans) should be provided to 
the central review board at baseline as supplemental information to the central readers regarding 
any possible metastatic tumors on the screening scan.
  The results provided by the central review 
board will be used to determine eligibility.  
The c entral review board will provide an assessment of  SMA encasement and unreconstructible 
disease to the sites during screening to support stratification at randomization for any subje cts 
determined to be eligible . 
Process details surrounding the central review can  be found in the Imaging Manual. 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 45 of 82  7.1.2. Neoadjuvant Treatment Period  
All subjects will be treated with  pamrevlumab or placebo in combination with gemcitabine and 
nab-paclitaxel  or FOLFIRINOX for up to six 28- day cycles.  Study procedures are described 
below and will be performed in accorda nce with the SOA (see Appendix 1).  Subjects who 
complete study treatment will undergo evaluation to determine their eligibility for surgical 
exploration (see Section  4).  CT scans will be performed approximately every 8 weeks and 
evaluated by central imaging until disease progression is noted.  If disease progression is noted during the neoadjuvant treatment period, subjects will be discontinued from study treatment.  
Subjects who discontinue treatment early (see Section  5.3) will complete an EOT visit and 
continue in the follow-up period. 
7.1.3. Safety Follow- up 
All subjects enrolled will have a safety follow-up visit approximately 28 days after the last dose 
of study treatment and a final safety follow-up phone call approximately 60 days post last dose 
of study treatment. After the protocol- required reporting period (60 days after the last dose), the 
investigator does not need to actively monitor subjects for serious adverse events (SAEs). 
However, if the investigator becomes aware of a SAE that may be possibly related to study 
treatment after the protocol- required re porting period, the investigator may report the event to 
FibroGen as outlined in Section  8. SAEs reported outside of the protocol- required reporting 
period will be captured within the safety database only as clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited reporting. 
7.1.4. Determination of Eligibility for Surgical Exploration  
To be considered eligible for surgical exploration, a subject must meet at least  one of the four 
protocol-defined criteria and have no contraindication to surgery as outlined below: 
The protocol- defined criteria  for surgical eligibility  are: 
• Reduction in CA 19-9 level ≥ 50%  
• FDG-PET SUVmax decrease by ≥ 30% at EOT when compared to bas eline  
• Partial response [PR], complete response [CR] or stable disease [SD] per RECIST 1.1 
at EOT  
• Resectable or borderline resectable per NCCN
® Version 2.2018 
Contraindications to surgical eligibility are: 
• Development of distant metastases or local progression per RECIST 1.1 
• Performance status of Karnofsky score ≤ 50 
• Unreconstructible disease as determined by central radiological/surgical review  
• Other conditions that are considered by the PI/surgeon to be contraindications to 
surgery 
The central revi ew board (to include radiologists, surgeons and oncologists) will review  
information provided by the site and determine whether a subject is eligible for surgical exploration per protocol. The  PI/surgeon will ultimately decide whether a subject will underg o 
surgery. See Section  7.1.4.1 for details.
 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
Confidential Page 46 of 82  Subjects who do not undergo surgical exploration (e.g. subjects who did not complete study 
treatment, do not meet any of the protocol- defined criteria for surgical eligibility  or have a 
contraindication to surgery at the time of evaluation) will co ntinue in the Follow-up period.  
All subjects who do undergo surgical expl oration within the protocol specified window will be 
followed for surgical safety and outcomes. 
7.1.4.1. Role of Central Review  in Determination of Eligibility for Surgical Exploration  
CT and PET scans collected at EOT  will be evaluated by the central review board to confirm 
whether a subject has met t he protocol- defined criteria  for RECIST  1.1, SUVmax , 
NCCN Version 2.2018 criteria response and/or whether they have unreconstructible disease. The 
site will also provide the central review board with CA19 -9 values to c onfirm response per the 
protocol defined criteria.  
Additionally, th e site will provide the central review board with  required information for their 
assessment of the subject’s performance status and a summary of existing 
conditions/contraindications follow ing the Safety Follow -up Visit . Conditions that may be 
contraindications to surgery will be reported to the central review board through the Safety 
Follow-up visit.  Medical co -morbidities that occur after the Safety Follow -up visit and preclude 
surgery will not be provided to the central review board, and therefore will not be considered in 
the determination of surgical eligibility,  but will be considered by site in their decision making 
process regarding surgical exploration . These co -morbidities will be documented in the clinical 
database.  
The central review board will provide their assessment of surgical eligibility  to the site within 
5 business days of receipt of all required information (approximately 1 week after the Safe ty 
Follow- up Visit ). After the recommendation from the central review board is received at the site, 
the PI/surgeon will make the final decision as to whether or not a subject will undergo surgery. 
All instances of discordance between the determination of eligibility for surgical exploration by 
the central review board and the final action taken by the site with regards to surgical exploration 
will be documented in the clinical database.  
Figure 2 provides an overview of the central review process. Details can be found in the 
Central Imaging Protocol and Study Reference Manual.

 Confidential Page 47 of 82  Figure  2: Central Review Schema for Determination of Eligibility for Surgical 
Exploration 
 
7.1.5. Surgical Exploration/Surgical Resection  
 
Surgery will occur at least 4 weeks after last dose (allowing for a wash -out period from 
treatment) and only after receipt of the recommendation from the central review board with regards to surgical eligibility.   
An outcome of R0 or R1 will be considered a ‘Resection Achieved’ while an outcome of R2 or partial  resection will be considered a ‘Resection Not Achieved’.  Final surgical outcomes (R0 
and R1)  for all ‘Resection Achieved’  subjects will be determined by the central pathology lab.  
The sponsor/sites remain blinded to the central pathology lab assessment until their final 
analysis. 
If a subject undergoes surgical exploration, but the surgeon is unable to perform resection (e.g. 
due to identification of metastases or extensive vascular involvement), it will be considered a 
‘Resection Not Attempted’.  
Surgery will be performed in accordance with institutional standards and SOPs. All s urgeons 
performing surgery for this study will be trained on the protocol. All subjects who undergo 
surgical exploration  within the protocol specified window will have tissue samples collected and 
sent to central pathology and will be followed for surgical complications for 90 days post 
discharge. 
7.1.6. Follow- up Period  
All subjects will be followed for disease progres sion (if not previously noted) or recurrence 
(local or distant) following resection, survival and any additional anti- cancer therapy received  
during the Follow-up period. Follow- up visits (telehealth visits or phone calls are acceptable) 
should occur  approximately every 3 months post last dose.   
For some subjects, CT scans may continue to be performed and submitted for central review 
during the follow-up period.  F or subjects who complete treatment without evidence of disease 
progression and do not undergo resection, CT scans will continue to be performed approximately 

Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
Confidential Page 48 of 82  every 8 weeks (±14 days) and evaluated by central imaging until progression is detected (per 
RECIST 1.1).  For subjects who undergo resection, follow- up CT scans to evaluate recurrence of 
disease will be evaluated by central imaging and performed approximately; every 4 months up to 2 years post-resection and every 6 months from 2 years to 5 years post-resection.  The investigator may perform an “off schedule” CT scan at any time post resection  if recurrence of 
disease is suspected clinically; these scans will be submitted to central imaging for review/confirmation of recurrence/disease progression.  CT scans conducted post resection 
during the Follow-up Period may be performed within 1 month (i.e. ± 30 days) of the suggested 
intervals above. 
All s ubjects will be followed  for survival (until death) or until the last subject to complete 
treatment has been followed for approximately 18 months post-last dose (i.e. at this time it is 
expected that 233 death events will have occurred to support final analysis of OS). Subjects may 
receive second -line therapy at the investigator’s discretion.  
7.1.7.  Missed Visits  
Study treatment may be withheld/interrupted due to safety reasons, resulting in a “missed” visit. 
Study visits may be delayed for a total window not to exceed + 6 weeks over the course of the 
treatment period . Adjustments to the dosing schedule for pamrevlumab/placebo should be 
discussed with the study Medical Monitor as outlined in Section 6.1.3. If a visit is missed and not rescheduled, it will be captured accordingly in the clinical database.  
7.1.8. Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visit s/assessments may be required at the discretion of the investigator.  
Unscheduled visit data will be captured accordingly in the clinical database.  
7.1.9. Early Withdrawal from Treatment 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment during the neoadjuvant treatment period  should 
be strongly encouraged to complete the final efficacy evaluations scheduled for the EOT visit as 
specified  in the SOA ( Appendix 1). These subjects must be followed for safety for at least 60 
days following the ir last dose of study drug. Discontinued subjects will continue in the Follow-
up period and be followed for progression (if not previously noted), survival and additional anti-
cancer therapies for pancreatic cancer . 
7.2. Assessments

During screening, a serum pregnancy test will be performed by the central lab for any females of child -bearing potential (WOCBP) .  For WOCBP, s erum or urine pregnancy tests should be 
performed approximately monthly thereafter at the site level per the SOA in Appendix 1. 
Local lab results may be used to evaluate subject condition prior to dosing.  
7.2.4.2. Local Laboratory Evaluations 
Whenever possible, and as outlined above, central lab samples should be collected/used for the 
purposes of this trial.  However, during the COVID-19 global pandemic, all sites were approved 
to use local labs if it was not possible to collect/use central labs (i.e. due to local/site restrictions or due to lab kit shortages).  Any instance in which local labs were used will be documented in 
the clinical database and local lab results will be captured.   Sites using local labs must submit 
their local lab ranges for reference.  
7.2.4.3. Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  
Additional samples will be collected to evaluate PK, HAHA, HAHA-N A and CTGF in 
accordance with 
the SOA in Appendix 1.  The central laboratory will manage the storage of 
these samples while 
analysis will be  performed at the specialty  lab specified in the central lab 
manual. 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
Confidential Page 51 of 82  7.2.4.3.1. Pharmacokinetics  
Plasma samples will be collected in all subjects for evaluation of C max and C min trough levels of 
pamrevlumab (FG -3019) according to the SOA in Appendix 2. A central laboratory will measure 
plasma FG -3019 levels using a validated assay. For the analysis of C max and C min data, it is 
critical to accurately record the dosing time and date in addition to the sampling collection time 
and date. 
7.2.4.3.2. Human Anti -Human A ntibodies (HAHA) and Connective Tissue Growth Factor 
(CTGF)  
Plasma samples will be collected for evaluation of human anti- human antibodies (HAHA)  and 
connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)  in all subjects according to the SOA in Appendix 1.  
Central labora tories will measure HAHA and CTGF  level using validated assay s. 
HAHA- NA samples will be collected from all subjects at the Safety Follow -up visit.  These 
samples will undergo evaluation for neutralizing antibodies for all s amples/subjects with 
positive/spe cific HAHA results. The prevalence and duration of binding and neutralizing 
antibodies and the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics 
markers, efficacy, and safety of pamrevlumab  will be assessed .  
7.2.4.3.3. Pharmacodynamics and Biomarkers (Blood and Tumor Tissue)  
Tumor tissue will be collected from all resected subjects for histological analysis and 
examination of nucleic acids.  Plasma samples wil l be collected from all subjects according to the 
SOA in Appendix 1 to support the exploratory analysis of protein and nucleic acid markers. Final 
decisions about the specific markers to be evaluated in tumor tissue or plasma samples collected for exploratory analysis will be made at the time of analysis and will be b ased on the review of 
medical literature, additional data regarding FG- 3019’s mechanism of action, preliminary results 
and availability of material for assay.  Details regarding the collection and storage of tumor tissue 
will be outlined in the Central Path ology Manual. 
7.2.5. Performance Status  
7.2.5.1. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
These scales and  criteria are used by  doctors and  researchers to assess how a patient's disease is 
progr
essing,  to asses s how t he disease affects the daily living  abilities of the p atient, and to 
determine appropriate treatment and prognosis (Oken, 1982). T he ECOG pe rformance scale will 
be used to evaluate subject’s performance status during screening and throughout the trial. S ee 
Appendix 1. 
7.2.5.2. Kar
nofsky  Performance Scale Index  
The Karnofsky Performance Scale Index is an assessment tool for functional impairment 
(Appendix 3 ). It can be used to assess the prognosis in individual patients. In most serious 
illnesses, the lower the Karnofsky score, the worse the likelihood of survival ( Boeck, 2007). The 
Karnofsky performance scale will be used to evaluate subject’s performance at  EOT only. 
Karnofsky performance scores will  be evaluated by the central review team in determination of 
eligibility  for surgical exploration  per protocol.

Confidential Page 52 of 82  7.2.6. Carbohydrate Antigen 19- 9 (CA 19 -9) 
CA 19 -9 is a tumor marker that is used primarily in the manageme nt of pancreatic cancer   
(Poruk, 2013). CA 19 -9 levels will be measured at baseline and regularly throughout the study. 
CA 19 -9 results will be evaluated by the central laboratory.  CA19 -9 results will be evaluated by 
the central review team in determination of eligibility for surgical exploration per protocol. 
7.2.7. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron E mission Tomography (PET) Scan 
Studies have shown FDG- PET may be useful in treatment response assessment and may have 
potential in guiding the management of patients with PDAC ( Yeh, 2018).  An FDG- PET scan 
will be performed at baseline and EOT to evaluate SUVmax  and metabolic tumor volume  in the 
primary pancreatic tumor. If a subject discontinues treatment early, an EOT PET scan is required 
unless the baseline PET was performed less than 8 weeks from EOT.  All PET scans will be 
performed  and evaluated in accordance with the central imaging protoco l. PET scans  will be 
evaluated by the central review team in determin ation of eligibility for surgical exploration  per 
protocol. 7.2.8. Computer Tomography (CT) Scan 
CT scans will be performed  using pancreatic protocols and in accordance with the central 
imaging charter  until progression. Central imaging will conduct RECIST reads on all CT scans 
collected during screening , the neoadjuvant treatment period and follow-up as outlined in the 
SOA ( Appendix 1).   
Baseline CT scans (collected during the screening  period) will be evaluated by the central 
radiological/surgical review team to  confirm subjects have locally advanced, unresectable 
disease prior to enrollment.  Central radiological/surgical review  team  will also  review each 
subjects’ baseline CT scan to determine the degree of SMA encasement and whether or not they 
have unreconst ructible disease for the purposes of stratification at randomi zation. 
All CT scans collected during the study will be evaluated by the central review team for 
progression per RECIST  until progression is noted .  EOT CTs, f or subjects who complete all 6 
cycles of treatment, will be evaluated at EOT by the central review team in determination of 
eligibility for surgical exploration per protocol.  
If a subject cannot tolerate a contrast CT  or other reasons, MRIs may be performed.  If MRIs are 
performed  during screening or the neoadjuvant treatment period due to contrast intolerance  or 
other reasons, they will be sent to central imaging for review.    
7.2.9. Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs)  
Patient reported ou tcome (P RO) data w ill be  collected in a ll subjects to e valuate the  mos t 
important patient reported s ymptoms, tre atment related symptoms a nd functional impacts th at 
may be  responsive to treatment. EORTC- QLQ-C30 and PRO CTCAE™ questionnaires will be 
administered as specified in the SOA (prior to dosing in all applicable instances) 
(see 
Appendix 1) .  
At t
he study outset, all PRO data was being captured as direct entry by the subject via electronic 
device (ePRO).  During the COVID-19 global pandemic, all sites were approved to use paper versions of the PRO/QOL questionnaires.  Use of paper questionnaires will be documented and 
the results will be transcribed into the clinical database.  
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 53 of 82  7.2.9.1. EORTC- QLQ -C30 
EORTC QLQ-C30 is a health related quality of life questionnaire (HRQOL) developed to assess 
the quality of life of cancer patients.  EORTC QLQ-C30 Version 3.0 is the most recent version 
and will be used for this study. This questionnaire will be collected on Day 1 of each treatment cycle (prior to dosing), at EOT and the Safety Follow-up visit.  
7.2.9.2. PRO -CTCAE™  
The following symptoms from the PRO- CTCAE™ library will be included in a symptom 
specific patient questionnaire : decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain 
and fatigue. This questionnaire will be collected on Days 1, 8 and 15 in the first three treatment cycles (Cycles 1 -3), on Days 1 and 15 in the last three treatment cycles (Cycles 4- 6) and at the 
EOT and Safety Follow-up Visit.  
7.2.10. Surgical Outcomes and Complications  
All subjects that undergo surgery within the protocol specified window (at least 4 weeks after the 
last dose and no longer than 8 weeks after the last dose) will be followed for surgical outcomes 
and complications for 90 days after their discharge. Surgical safety will be assessed by the collection of surgical outcomes measures and surgical complications that occur during this 
timeframe . 
7.2.10.1. Surgical Complications  
All surgical complications  that occur  will be collected  and graded in severity according to the 
Clavien -Dindo C lassification  (Appendix 4) .  
7.2.10.2. Surgical Outcomes  
The following surgical outcomes will be measured: 
• Type of procedure/resection 
• Resection outcome 
•  >10 lymph nodes  
• Operative time >10 hours 
• Length of hospital stay 
• Estimated blood loss (EBL) at time of surgery  
• Transfusions; units of blood 
• Return to operating room within 30 days

 Confidential Page 54 of 82  8. ASSESSMENT S OF SAFETY  
8.1. Background 
Adverse event reports from investigators are the critical building blocks to the development of 
the safety profile of the Study Drug. Subjects will be asked non-leading que stions in general 
terms to determine the occurrence of AEs, according to the schedule outlined in Appendix 1. In 
addition, all AEs reported spontaneously during the course of the study will be recorded. The 
investigator must immediately (within 24 hours of awareness) report to the sponsor or designated safety management vendor all SAEs, regardless of whether the investigator believes they are 
related to the study d rug. 
8.2. Definitions  
8.2.1. Definition of an Adverse Event (AE) 
An adverse event is defined as any untowa rd medical occurrence in a clinical trial  subject. The 
event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  The investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the 
subject as defined in the study protocol are recorded in the subject’s medical record. The 
definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition. Worsening 
indicates that the pre -existing medical condition (eg, diabetes, migraine headaches and gout ) has 
increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration, and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome. A pre-existing condition that has not worsened during the study or involves an 
intervention such as elective surgery or a medical procedure while on study, is not considered an 
adverse event.  (Section  8.3.1).  
8.2.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death,  
• A life -threateni ng AEs (i.e., if in the view of the investigator or sponsor, the subject 
was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event). Life -threatening does not 
refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe,  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions,  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect, or 
• Is considered a medically important event not meeting the above criteria, but which 
may jeopardize a subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the other criteria listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home, and blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization. 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 55 of 82  Please note that death is an outcome, not an event; the primary cause of death would be the 
adverse event.  
Surgical procedures, per se, are not SAEs. The condition requiring the surgical procedure, 
however, may be an SAE. 
Scheduled or pre -planned hospitalization or prolongation of a hospitalization due to standard of 
care assessments and procedures (including elective procedures) do not warrant reporting as 
adverse events unless resulting observations are deemed by the Investigator to meet the definition of an adverse event. 
8.3. Procedures for Eliciting, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events 
8.3.1. Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The safety  reporting period begins after the subject has signed the informed consent and ends 60 
days after the last dose of study drug. Only  SAEs  need to be reported following consent and prior 
to first dose .  While both AEs and SAEs need to be reported from first dose through 60 days post 
last dose.   The investigator should notify FibroGen of any death or other SAEs occurring after a subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this 
study ( Section  8.3.5).  Pregnancy reporting requirements are outlined in Section  8.3.6. 
Adverse events will be followed until resolved, stable, or until the subject’s last study visit or 
subject is lost to follow -up. 
8.3.2. Adverse Event Eliciting/Reporting  
During the AE reporting period, study site personnel will actively seek information from each 
subject at each visit to collect  any AE occurring since the previous visit. All AEs will be 
collected in response to a general question about the subject’s well -being and any possible 
changes from the baseline  or previous visit, but shall not be specifically solicited. There will be 
no directed questioning or solicitation  for any specific AE. This does not preclude the site from 
collecting and recording any AEs reported by the subject to site personnel at any other time.  
Whenever  possible, diagnoses should be recorded when signs and symptoms are due to a 
common etiology, as determined by qualified medical study staff. The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining  whether a n abnormal value in an individual 
study subject represents a clinically  significant change from the subject’s baseline values. In 
general, abnormal laboratory  findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's 
judgment) are not to be recor ded as adverse events. However, laboratory value changes that 
require treatment  or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where 
applicable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the  adverse 
event. The investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility.  
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 56 of 82  The following attributes must be assigned to each AE: 
• Description (Investigator’s verbatim term describing the event) 
• Dates of onset and resolution 
• Severity  
• Relationship to study drug 
• Outcome 
• Action taken regarding study drug 
• Other treatment required  
• Determination of “seriousness”  
8.3.3. Assessing Adverse Event Severity  
AEs, including abnormal clinical laboratory values, should be graded using the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for AE (CTCAE) v 5.0 guidelines. For terms not 
specified as part of NCI CTCAE, the following guidelines should be used to determine grade: 
All AEs will be assessed for severity using the following criteria:  
• Grade 1, Mild: Asymptomatic or mild symptoms which the subject finds easily 
tolerated. The event is of little concern to the subject and/or of little -or-no clinical 
significance; intervention not indicated. 
• Grade 2, Moderate:  The subject has enough discomfort to c ause interference with or 
change in some of their age- appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (e.g., 
preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing 
money); local or noninvasive intervention indicated. 
• Grade 3, Severe:  The subject is incapacitated and unable to work or participate in 
many or all usual activities. The event is of definite concern to the subject and/or poses substantial risk to the subject’s health or well- being; likely to require medical 
interven tion and/or close follow -up, including but not limited to hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization. 
• Grade 4, Life- threatening:  The subject was at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred.  
• Grade 5, Death : Fatal AE.  
8.3.4. Assessing the Adverse Event’s Relationship to Study Drug  
Most of the information about the safety of a drug prior to marketing comes from clinical trials; 
therefore, AE reports from investigators are critically important. The assessment of whether an 
AE is causally related to the study drug(s) using an evidence- based approach is critical in order 
to appropriately describe the safety profile of study drug(s). Default reporting of individual 
events as possibly related is uninformative and does not meaningfully contribute t o the 
development of the study drug’s safety profile. 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 57 of 82  The investigator must provide an evidence- based assessment of the relationship of the AE to 
study drug in accordance with the guidance below. Absence of an alternative cause would not 
normally be considered sufficient evidence to assess an event as related to study drug.  
• Related:  
− Any event for which there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the study drug may have caused the event. For example, an unanticipated medical condition 
occurs which resolves with study drug interruption and re- occurs with re -
administration of study drug; another example is a typical drug- related medical 
condition such as a rash that occurred shortly after first dose of study drug. 
• Not Related:  
− The event represents a pre- exist ing underlying disease that has not worsened on 
study 
− The event has the same characteristics of a known side- effect associated with a 
co-medication  
− The event is an anticipated medical condition of anticipated severity for the study population 
− The most plau sible explanation for the event is a factor that is independent of 
exposure to study drug 
8.3.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by  the 
investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the informed  consent/assent 
through 60 days after the last dose of pamrevlumab are  recorded in the subject’s medical record 
and are submitted to FibroGen. All SAEs  must be submitted to FibroGen within 24 hours 
following the investigator’s  knowledge of the event via the SAE report form. Additionally, 
pamrevlumab  related SAEs  (including deaths) that occur after the safety follow -up visit through 
the end of the long- term follow -up will be reported.  
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol required therapies because of a serious 
adverse event, this information must be submitted to FibroGen. FibroGen will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and central IRBs/IECs in compliance with all reporting 
requirements according to local  regulations and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). 
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adverse events following the protocol-required reporting period or after end of study. However, these serious adverse events 
can be reported to FibroGen. In some countries (e.g. European Union [EU] member states), 
investigators are required to report serious adverse events that they  become aware of after end of 
study. If serious adverse events are reported, the investigator is to report them to FibroGen  
within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event. Se rious adverse events 
reported outside of the protocol- required reporting period will be captured within the safety  
database as clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited  reporting; these cases will not be 
included in the clinical study report. 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 58 of 82  To report an SAE, the investigator must complete an SAE Report Form and fax or email the 
completed form to the Sponsor or its designated safety management vendor. 
Full details of the SAE should also be recorded on the medical records and in the CRF. The 
following minimum information is required:  
• Subject number, sex and age 
• The date of report 
• A description of the SAE (event, seriousness of the event) 
• Causal relationship to the study drug 
Follow-up information for the event should be sent promptly. 
For each SAE o bserved, the investigator should obtain all of the information available about the 
event, including (but not limited to): hospital discharge diagnoses, hospital discharge note, death 
certificate, appropriate laboratory findings (including autopsies and biopsy results), and clinical 
examinations (including radiological examinations and clinical consultations).  
8.3.5.1. Reporting Serious Adverse Events to the Institutional Review 
Board / Independent Ethics Committee  
The investigator is responsible for notifying his/her Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics 
Committee (EC) of SAEs in accordance with local regulations. The Sponsor, or its designated 
safety vendor, will provide a copy of expedited safety reports to the investigator that it intends to submit to global regulatory authorities. 
8.3.5.2. Deaths  
The investigator will report the fatal event to the Sponsor’s medical monitor. The investigator 
must provide a causal assessment of the relationship of the event to the study drug according to 
the guidance in Section  8.3.5. 
If the death occurred within the AE collection and reporting period (signed ICF to 60 days after last dose) and meets the reporting criteria, the investigator must submit the SAE Report Form in the same manner as described above in Section  8.3.5. If the investigator becomes aware of a 
death occurring after the AE reporting period and considers it related to study drug, it will be 
reported as an SAE. 
8.3.6. Pregnancies: Reporting and Follow -up of Subjects  and Female Partners of 
Subjects  
The outcome of all pregnancies for a female study participant or female partners of a male study 
participant should be followed up and documented as described. If a female subject or a partner  
of a male subject becomes pregnant while the subject is receiving study treatment or within 6 
months after the last dose o f study treatment, a  Pregnancy Report Form must be completed and 
submitted to Sponsor or designated safety management vendor within 24 hours of the 
investigator becoming aware of the pregnancy. The investigator must follow -up to completion of 
the pregnancy to ascertain its ou tcome (e.g., spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, 
ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) and whether any AEs occur during the pregnancy or birth. The outcome of the pregnancy must be reported by the investigator on a 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 59 of 82  Pregnancy Outcome Report Form, which should be sent to the Sponsor and/or its designated 
safety vendor within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the outcome. 
Pregnancy itself is not an AE unless there is a suspicion that the investigational product unde r 
study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Pregnancies are 
followed up to outcome even if the subject was discontinued from the study. Congenital 
abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as 
SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs. 
If a lactation case occurs while the female subject is taking protocol -required therapies or within 
60 days after the last dose of study treatment , report the lactation case to FibroGen. In addition to 
reporting a lactation case during the study, investigators should monitor for lactation cases that 
occur after the last dose of protocol- required therapies through 6 months after the last dose of 
pamrevlumab.  Any lactation  case should be reported to FibroGen’s Safety within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s knowledge of event. 
8.3.7. Abnormal Laboratory Findings 
An abnormal laboratory finding in absence of any other signs or symptoms is not necessarily an 
AE. The investigator must review and assess all results provided by the central laboratory 
throughout the study in a timely manner, and determine whether any abno rmal laboratory values 
are clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant (NCS), and whether there are  
associated signs and symptoms. Laboratory abnormalities should be considered clinically significant when they occur after taking study medication, reflect a meaningful change from the screening value(s), and require active management (e.g., abnormalities that require study 
treatment dose modification, discontinuation, more frequent follow -up assessments, etc.).  
Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will be reported as AEs. If the abnormal 
laboratory finding is accompanied by signs or symptoms, re port the signs and symptoms as the 
AE in lieu of the abnormal laboratory value. If a diagnosis is available, report the diagnosis.  
8.3.8. Disease Progression  
Disease progression assessed by radiographs or other methods should not be reported as an 
adverse event, unless the outcome is fatal during the safety reporting period. Deaths related to 
progression of the underlying disease outside of the safety reporting period should be recorded on the corresponding page of the CRF (unless the patient has withdrawn consent). 
8.3.9. Special Reporting Situations  
Special reporting situations  include: 
• Overdose (any dose greater than 4.1g) 
• Suspected abuse/misuse  
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure 
• Medication error (e.g. incorrect dose administered) 
• Drug -drug interactions 
Report special situations to FibroGen Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of 
the event.  See Study Reference Manual for detailed reporting instructions.

 Confidential Page 60 of 82  8.3.10. Safety Monitoring  
8.3.10.1. Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) 
In addition to routine safety monitoring, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) 
will be established  to review safety data on an ongoing basis. A DMC charter will establish  the 
procedures , meeting  frequency, and scope of responsibilities  of the committee.  The DMC will 
be comprised of individuals with relevant expertise who are external to the study and are not 
directly involved with the study conduct.   
The sponsor proposes to convene the DMC within 21 days after the first 10 su bjects have 
received at least 3  cycles of investiga tional drug in combination with the FOLFIRINOX regimen 
to specifically evaluate the safety of this combination . After this initial DMC  meeting  and if no 
additional signal has been identified in addition to what is seen with FOLFIRINOX, the DMC 
will meet approx imately every 6 months during the study, in accordance with the DMC Charter.  
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 61 of 82  9. STATISTI CS 
9.1. Sample Size Determination  
The study is planned to enroll approximately  280 subjects .  All subjects will be prescribed either 
gemcitabine plus nab- paclitaxel (G/NP) or FOLFIRINOX prior to randomization, and then will 
be randomized with 1:1 randomization ratio to the addition of either pamrevlumab or placebo.  
This sample size is estimated based on the assumption that the median OS for the pamrevlumab 
arm and the placebo arm is 24 and 16.3 months, respectively. The assumptions of overall 
survival are based on the FGCL-3019-069 study results for G/NP + pamrev lumab  and G/NP 
alone.  This improvement represents a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.68.  With this HR, 233 deaths will 
provide at least  80% power when using a test statistics with a 2-sided  significan ce level of 5%. 
With the enrollment of approximately 280 subjects, 233 deaths are estimated by the end of the 
follow -up period. 
If the treatment effect on EFS has a hazard ratio 0.60, then 161 events would be required to 
provide 75% power when using a stratified log- rank statistic with (one -sided) 0.005 false 
positive error rate.  
For the assessment of OS, all  patients will be followed for approximately 18 months after the last 
subject enrolled  completes treatment which will occur about 48 months after the start of the trial, 
to achieve 233 events, (i.e., deaths ). With 233 events, the trial would have at least 80% power to 
detect a hazard ratio of 0.68, when using a stratified log-rank statistic having ( two-sided) 
significance level of  5%.  
9.2. Analysis Populations 
9.2.1. Intent to Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT Population is d efined as all randomized subjects regardless of whether or not study 
treatment is  received.   The primary analysis of efficacy will be based on the ITT population. 
Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment randomized. 
9.2.2. Per Protocol (PP)  Popula tion 
The Per Protocol (PP) Population is defined as all subjects who have completed the 6-cycle study 
treatment, had baseline and at least one post- baseline tumor assessment . 
9.2.3. Safety Population 
The Safety Population is defined as all randomized subjects who have received study medication. 
The primary analysis of safety will be based on the Safety population.  Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment received.  
 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 62 of 82  9.3. Statistical Analysis  
9.3.1. General Considerations 
 
After approximately 233 deaths are reached, the final analysis for the primary endpoint and 
secondary endpoints will be conducted.  A gate-keeping strategy will be employed to ensure 
overall control of the type I error rate. The secondary efficacy hypotheses will be relevant only if 
the primary efficacy null hypothesis is first rejected.  
 
Following the rejection of the primary efficacy null hypothesis, each secondary hypothesis will 
be tested.  Each treatment effect testing will be relevant only if the preceding tests have been 
rejected at the same 5% level of significance (two -sided) as for the primary endpoint. The testing 
order for the secondary endpoints is as the order listed in section 3.2.3 of the protocol. 
A hierarchical approach will be implemented.  If the analysis of t he effect of pamrevlumab on 
EFS is statistically significant at two -sided p=0.01, then that alpha will be carried forward to the 
final analysis of OS, which then would be conducted at the two-sided p=0.05 level.  If the effect 
of pamrevlumab on EFS is not statistically significant at two -sided p=0.01, then the final 
analysis of pamrevlumab’s effect on OS would be conducted at the two-sided p=0.04 level.  
When the interim analysis of EFS is conducted (i.e. when approximately 161events have 
occurred), an inte rim look of OS will also be conducted at that time by the DMC for lack of 
benefit analysis. T he final analysis of OS will occur when 233 OS events have occurred, which is 
estimated  to occur approximately 48 months into the trial.  
The sponsor likely will pursue a regulatory submission for an accelerated approval  if the effect 
of pamrevlumab on EFS at the interim analysis  is statistically significant at two -sided p=0.01.   
After the interim a nalysis,  to protect the integrity of the OS data for the final analysis, 
confidentiality of the emerging OS data will be maintained  (Fleming 2018). 
A Data Access Plan  describes the strategy for maintaining confidentiality of the emerging OS 
data until fina l database lock of the FG CL-3019-087 trial. 
9.3.2. Subject Enrollment and Disposition  
The number (%) of subjects who completed or discontinued the study and reasons for early 
discontinuation will be summarized by treatment for subjects in the ITT  population. 
9.3.3. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for subjects in the ITT population. 
9.3.4. Efficacy Analyses 
9.3.4.1. Analysis of Overall Survival ( Primary Endpoint )  
Overall survival (OS ) is defined as t he time from randomization until death from any cause and 
is measured in the intent- to-treat population.  
For subjects who are alive at data cut or at study closure, the recorded date of last known alive, 
last contact date, or the date of the last clinic v isit is defined as the censoring date for OS.  
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 63 of 82  The OS will be summarized using the Kaplan -Meier method. The Cox proportional hazard 
model including treatment and stratification factors: chemotherapy treatment regimen, SMA 
encasement, unreconstructible disease and geographic region, will be used to compare the 2 
treatment arms and to estimate the h azard ratio  and the corresponding 95% confidence interval.  
9.3.4.2. Analysis of Event -free Survival (EFS)  (Surrogate Endpoint  for Accelerated 
Approval) 
The EFS endpoint wou ld be a composite time -to-event endpoint, the event being ‘treatment 
failure’ defined as the earliest occurrence of:  
a) Failure to achieve disease- free status locally after completion of neoadjuvant treatment 
and/or after surgery (i.e., resection failure or progression that precludes surgery); or  
b) Local or distant recurrence; or 
c) Death  
For subjects who did not have the event at data cut or at study closure, the latest date of the following events will be defined as the censoring date: last post -basel ine CT, last post- baseline 
PET scan, the last known record of ‘Not progress ed’, surgical exploration, date of surgery 
cancellation.   EFS will be summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional 
hazard model  including treatment and stratification factors: chemotherapy treatment regimen, 
SMA encasement, unreconstructible disease and geographic region  will be used to compare the 
treatment effect and to estimate the  hazard ratio  and corresponding 95% CI. 
9.3.4.3. Analysis of Progression -free Survival (PFS)  
PFS is defined as the time from randomization until disease progression or death, whichever 
occurs first  (FDA Guidance, 2018).  
For subjects who did not have progression at data cut or at study closure, the latest date of the following events will be defined as the censoring date: last post -baseline CT, last post -baseline 
PET scans, the last known record of ‘Not Progressed’. 
PFS will be summarized descriptively using the Kaplan -Meier method. The Cox proportional 
hazard model  including treatment and stratification factors: chemotherapy treatment regimen, 
SMA encasement, unreconstructible disease and geographic region will be conducted to compare 
treatment effect and to estimate the h azard ratio  and corresponding 95% CI. 
9.3.4.4. Analysis of Best Overall Objective Res ponse Rate (ORR)  
Best overall objective response rate (ORR) is one of the secondary endpoints where objective 
response is defined as a complete response ( CR) or partial response ( PR) according to RECIST 
1.1. Objective response will be based on the best overall response recorded from Day 1 until 
centrally -assessed progressive disease ( PD), death, or first administration of anti- tumor treatment 
(other than study medication), whichever occurs first. Patients who receive anti -tumor treatment 
other than the study medication prior to reaching a CR or PR, or who die, progress, or drop out for any reason prior to reaching a CR or PR will be counted as non- responders in the assessment 
of ORR. P atients without a post- baseline tumor assessment will be considered to be non -
responders. 
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 64 of 82  ORR will be summarized by using the analysis of the difference between two proportions for the 
ITT Population and PP Population. Normal approximation method will be used as the sample 
size is larger than 30. Estimation and 95% CI for the ORR for the two arms will be computed 
and difference of the two proportions and its 95% CI will be estimated by SAS PROC FREQ procedure. The p- value for testing the difference of the two proportions will be used for 
hypothesis testing for treatment comparison.  
9.3.4.5. Analysis of Physical Functioning  by EORTC- QLQ -C30 
The physical functional scale will be scored according to the EORTC- QLQ -C30 scoring 
manual.  For functional scale, the scoring will not be affected if there are at least half of the items 
from the scale answered. All the items that are completed will be used to calculate the raw score then through a linear transformation to a standardized score for the scale . The standardized score 
range from 0 to 100; a higher score represents a higher ("better") level of functioning, or a higher ("worse") level of symptoms. If there are more than half of the items from the scale that are missing, then the scale score at the visit will be set to missing.  
Difference between treatment arms in mean change from baseline Physical Functional score at 
selected visits during the treatment period will be assessed using a MMRM model, with adjustment for randomization stratification factors. The unstructured covariance will be applied 
first. If the algorithm for unstructured covariance pattern does not converge then heterogeneous Toeplitz structure will be used. If this second model does not converge then the (homogeneous) Toeplitz structure will be tried, and  if all of these covariance structures failed to converge then 
the compound symmetry will be used. 
9.3.4.6. Analysis of Abdominal Pain and Fatigue Score  by NCI -PRO -CTCAE 
The abdominal pain and fatigue scales will be scored according to the scoring manual.  
Differen ce between treatment arms in mean change from baseline of the abdominal pain and 
fatigue scores at selected visits during the treatment period will be assessed using a mixed effect 
model for repeated measurements (MMRM), with adjustment for randomization stratification factors.  
The unstructured covariance will be applied first. If the algorithm for unstructured covariance pattern does not converge then heterogeneous Toeplitz structure will be used. If this second model does not converge then the (homogeneous) Toeplitz structure will be tried, and if all of these covariance structures failed to converge then the compound symmetry will be used. 
9.3.5. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
The plasma concentrations of the PK samples will be determined by a validated assay, and a p lan 
for population PK as well as exposure- response analysis will be provided.  
9.3.6. Safety Analyses 
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized  by treatment arm. Treatment -
emergent  deaths, serious TEAEs, TEAEs with grade 3 or 4 per CTCAE criteria, and TEAEs 
leading to study or treatment discontinuation will be summarized separately. Surgical 
complications will be summarized by treatment arm.  
Clinically significant changes from baseline in vital sign s, laboratory tests, and ECGs will be 
identified. 
Human anti- human antibody data will be summarized in a separate report.  
Pamrevlumab  Protocol FGCL-3019-087 A5.0 
 Confidential Page 65 of 82  9.3.7. Sensitivity  Analyses 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess overall survival (OS) by center or groups of 
centers which are considered to have similar surgical practices. Overall survival (OS) analysis 
will also be conducted per protocol population. 
If there is a large discrepancy between the two arms in the number of patien ts who undergo 
surgery, additional analyses to investig ate the reasons for the discrepancy  will be performed .  
A sub -group analysis will be performed to evaluate the differences in efficacy and safety 
between treatment arms in each subgroup . 
9.4. Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis is planned to evaluate EFS as a surrogate endpoint for accelerated approval 
and will be completed when approximately 161 EFS events have occurred. Statistical 
significance occurs when the estimated hazard ratio is 0.667.  When 161 EFS events are 
available at approximately 24 months into the trial, enrollment will be complete (i.e., 280 patients).   
At the time of this EFS analysis, an interim look of OS will be performed  by the DMC for lack 
of benefit analysis, using an  O’Brien -Fleming monitoring boundary as a reference. .   
After the inte rim analysis, to protect the integrity of the OS data for the final analysis, 
confidentiality of the emerging OS data will be maintained.  (Fleming 2018) Details surrounding 
the planned Interim Analysis will be described in the Interim Analysis Plan (IAP).  
 
9.5. 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will include detailed analysis methods, statistical models, 
definitions, as well as data handling  rules.  The SAP will be finalized prior to database lock.

12.1. Source Documents 
Source documents are original documents, data, and records necessary for the reconstruction and 
evaluation of the clinical study. The investigator or designee will prepare and maintain adequate 
and accurate source documents. These documents are designed to record all observations and 
other pertinent data for each subject enrolled in this clinical study. Source documents must be 
adequate to reconstruct all data transcribed onto the CRFs and resolved queries.  
12.2. Direct Access to Source Documents 
The investigator must provide direct access to source data and source documents for trial -related 
monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory authority inspection. Direct access includes 
examining, analyzing, verifying, and reproducing any records and reports that are important to 
the evaluation of the study. The investigator is obligated to inform and obtain the consent of the 
subject to permit such individuals to have access to his/her study- related records, including 
personal information and medical records. 
12.3. Data Collection, Handling, and Verification  
All required data will either be entered onto CRFs by authorized site personnel or will be provided as a data transfer from authorized service providers (such as laboratory results from a 
central laboratory). Data will be entered or uploaded into a validated, clinical database compliant 
with 21 CFR Part 11 regulations. 
All subject data will be reviewed by Sponsor and/or designee. Data that appear inconsistent, 
incomplete or inaccurate will be queried for site clarification.  
Medical history, adverse events and medications will be coded using industry standard 
dictionaries (e.g., MedDRA and World Health Organization Drug [WHODrug]) Dictionary. 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing, verifying, and approving all subject data ( i.e. CRFs 
and queries) throughout the duration of the study and prior to study completion, ensuring that all 
data are verifiable with source documents.  
12.4. Protocol Deviations 
Unless the re is a safety concern, there should be no deviations or violations of the study protocol. 
In the event of a safety concern, the Investigator or designee must document and explain the 
reason for any deviation from the approved protocol. The Investigator ma y implement a 
deviation from, or a change to, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study 
participants without prior IRB/IEC approval.  Immediately after the implemented deviation or 
change, the Investigator must submit a report explaining the reasons for the protocol violation or deviation to the IRB/IEC, FibroGen, and to the regulatory authorities, if required. 
During the COVID- 19 global pandemic, sites may have deviated from the protocol due to 
local/site restrictions that were beyond their control.  A study specific memo was issued to all 
sites providing guidance for conducting this clinical trial during COVID.  Protocol deviations related to COVID will be captured in the final protocol deviation listing.

CBC = complete blood c ount; CT = computer to mography; ECOG = Eas tern Cooperative Oncology Group; E KG = electrocardiogram; EOT =  end of treatment; 
FDG PET = [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. 
a .All visits (including the EO T visit) should occur within ±2 days of protocol specified time point during the neoadjuvant treat ment period. The Safety Follow-up and
the Surgical Follow-up visit should occur within ±3 days of the  specified time point . Visit windows should be calculated based  on the previous study visit date, NOT
Cycle 1 Day 1.
b.All screening activ ities should be conducted within 30 days pri or to Day 1 Cycle 1.  A diagnosti c biopsy, which may be perform ed per SOC, is required for
histological or cytological confirmation of PDAC.
c.Subjects who complete 6 cycles of study treatment or discontinu e early will undergo an End of Tre atment visit approximately 2 weeks following their last dose. All
final efficacy assessments will be performed. Subjects who comp lete 6 cycles of treatment will be evaluated by the central rev iew team to determine eligibility for
surgical exploration.
d.All surgeries will occur within 4-8 weeks from the subjects’ last dose. Surgery will be perform ed in accordance with instituti onal standards and SOPs. Surgeons
performing surgery for this study will be trained on the protoc ol. Tumor tissue will be collected during surgical resection an d provided to central pathology for
determination of s urgical outcome.
e.All subjects who undergo surgical exploration will be followed for surgical safety for 90 days ( ± 3 days) post discharge, in a ccordance with the ins titutions’ standard
of care. A clinic visit should be  scheduled to re view surgical complications (if any) and collect CA19-9.
f.All subjects will be  followed in Long Term Follow-up for progression, survival and any additional anti-can cer therapy (follow- on treatment for pancreatic cancer)
until the last subject to complete treatment has been followed for 18 months post-last dose. It is recommended that Long Term Follow-up be conducted approximately
every 3 months.
g.Medical history includes smoking history.
h.Height is coll ected during screening only.
i.ECOG to be evaluated at baseline, Day 1 of each treatment Cycle , and EOT. Karnofsky scores will be evalu ated at EOT only.
j.A full physical exam is required during screening and on Day 1 of each treatment cycle.
k.A 12-lead EKG will be performed during screening, on Day 1 of e ach cycle and EOT.
l.A serum pregnancy test  is required for all females of childbear ing potential during screening. The central lab will provide re sults for the screening serum pregnancy
test. Additionally, any female of childbearing potential must h ave a nega tiv e serum or urine p regnancy test conf irmed at the s ite on Day 1 of each cycle (prior to study
drug administration) and at EOT.
m.Dosing for pamrevlumab (or place bo) will be based on the weight  obtained on Day 1 of each dosing cycle (i.e., Cycle 1 Day 1, C ycle 2 Day 1. An additional dose of
pamrevlumab or placebo to be administered on Day 8 of Cycle 1 o nly. Pamrevlumab (or placebo) to be infused over 1 hour (± 15 m inutes) following infusion of
chemotherapy agents.

Confidential Page 78 of 82  o.If a subject discontinues treatment early, an EOT PET scan is required unless the baseline PET was performed less than 8 weeks from EOT.
p.A baseline CT scan will  be conducted during the screening period and approximately every 8 weeks thereafter until disease progression is detected by
central imaging review:
•For subjects who complete 6 cycles of treatment, the EOT scan  will be evaluated by the central review board in determination of surgical eligibility.
•If a subject completes 6 cycles of treatment without evidence of disease progression, but does not undergo surgical exploration, CT scans should
continue to be collected approximately every 8 weeks and submitted for central review until progression is detected (per RECIST 1.1).
•If a subject undergoes surgical exploration and resection, CT scans should be conducted approximately every 4 months following for up to 2 yearspost-resection and approximately every 6 months from 2-5 years post -resection.
•If recurrence of disease is suspected clinically at any time during the post -resection follow -up, a CT scan may be performed “off schedule” and
submitted to central imaging for review/confirmation of progression/recurrence.
q.All PRO
s to be collected prior to dosing where applicable. PRO-CTCAE™ questionnaire will be administered on Days 1, 8 and 15 of Cycles 1-3 and
Day 1 and 15 of each treatment cycle thereafter and at the EOT and Safety follow -up visits.
r.Adverse events and concomitant medications are collected from Day 1 of the study  through 60 days following a subject ’s last dose of study treatment.
Serious adverse events should be collected/reported from the signing of Informed Consent through 60 days following the subject’s last dose of study
treatment.   A Safety Follow -up visit must be conducted ~28 days post -last dose and a final safety follow-up contact (via phone) must be conducted ~60
days post -last dose.  Additionally, pamrevlumab related SAEs (including deaths) that occur after the safety foll ow-up visit through the end of the long-
term follow -up will be reported.
s.Eligibility for surgical exploration per protocol will be determined by a central review board.  However, ultimately, the decision to operate on a subject
lies with the site PI/surgeo n. See Section  7.1.4 for details.
t.Tumor tissue will only be collected during resection.  Surgical outcomes of R0, R1 and R2 will be determined by central pathological review of tissuesamples collected per the study specific pathology protocol during surgical resection. Tissue collected during resection may also be evaluated  for
exploratory analysis  (i.e. review of slides or digital images for purposes other than determining resection outcome) .

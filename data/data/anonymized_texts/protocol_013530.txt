 SYNOPSIS  
TITLE  A Phase II Randomized Controlled Trial of Genomically Directed 
Therapy After Preoperative Chemotherapy in Patients with Triple 
Negative Breast Cancer  
STUDY PHASE  Phase II  
OBJECTIVES  Primary Objective:  
To compare 2 -year disease -free survival (DFS) in participants with 
confirmed triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with a 
genomically directed therapy or standard of care  following preoperative 
chemotherapy  
 
Secondary Objectives:   
• To compare overall DFS and 1 -year DFS  
• To determine 5 -year overall survival (OS)  
• To collect archived tumor specimens and genomic DNA to 
explore potential correlates of recurrence and toxicity.  
• To describe the toxicities associated with genomically directed 
therapies in this population  
 
Exploratory Objectives:  
• To describe the evolution of genomically directed therapies 
during the course of the study  
• To evaluate the drug specific effect on both effi cacy outcomes 
(DFS and OS) and toxicity.  
 
STUDY DESIGN  Sequencing:  
DNA from archived tumor samples collected at the time of surgery 
(residual disease post neoadjuvant chemotherapy) will be extracted and 
sequenced. The resulting sequencing data will be interrogated for known 
genomic drivers of sensitivity or resistance to existing FDA approved 
agents.  
 
Cancer Genomics Tumor Board (CGTB):  
Realizing that optimal treatment recommendations cannot be made based 
on sequencing data alone, the CGTB will be respo nsible for the final 
treatment recommendation. The CGTB will consider the genomic data 
along with the participant’s prior treatment history, ongoing toxicities, 
and comorbidities. Preference will be given to the treatment identified by 
the sequencing data unless a significant clinical or safety contraindication 
exists for that therapy. All participants and treating investigators will be 
blinded to sequencing results and CGTB deliberations until the time of 
relapse.

 STUDY DESIGN  Participants with a CGTB tr eatment recommendation:  
Participants with a CGTB recommendation will be randomized to 
Experimental Arm A (genomically directed monotherapy) or Control 
Arm B (standard therapy).  
 
Experimental Arm A (genomically directed monotherapy)  
Participants randomized to Experimental Arm A will receive an FDA 
approved drug at standard dose for four cycles (12 -16 weeks total 
duration, depending on cycle length).  Clinical and laboratory monitoring 
and dose -reductions will follow the FDA package insert guidelines. 
Detaile d information about the drugs expected to be recommended most 
commonly can be found in Appendix A.  
 
Control Arm B (standard therapy)  
Recently, a randomized phase III trial of over 900 HER2 -negative 
participants demonstrated an improvement in DFS and OS for the 
addition of 8 cycles of capecitabine in the post -neoadjuvant setting. The 
hazard ratios were also significant in the triple nega tive subgroup. Thus, 
capecitabine can be considered a standard option in this setting. As this 
represents only a single trial (with prior data not demonstrating benefit 
for the addition of capecitabine in the neoadjuvant nor adjuvant settings 
in unselected  participants), observation can be considered an option as 
directed by the treating physician. While not recommended, other 
therapies can be used as deemed appropriate by the treating physician.  
 
Participants with no CGTB recommendation:  
Participants may have no CGTB recommendation either because 1) 
sequencing did not identify a matched drug or 2) the matched drug was 
contraindicated. These participants will be assigned  to Control Arm B 
and treated as described above for Control Arm B. As the outcome of 
participants without an ‘actionable’ genomically directed therapy may 
differ, the primary analysis will include only participants randomized  to 
Control Arm B.  
NUMBER  OF 
PARTICIPANTS  Total number REQUIRED to be randomized  and evaluable for efficacy  = 
136 
 
Estimated number with technical failure in sequencing = 5  
 
Estimated number of participants expected to have no CGTB  
recommendation  = 30  
 
Estimated total number of participants to be enrolled = 192 
 
Maximum number of participants to be enrolled = 200

 ELIGIBILITY  1. Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of 
personal health information.  
NOTE:   HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed 
consent or may be obtained separately.  
NOTE:  Central pathology review may be conducted any time after 
definitive surgery. Consenting participants may be pre -registered to 
the study and proceed with central pathology review before full 
eligibility has been confirmed. However, ALL of the eligibility 
criteria must be met and formal study registration completed prior to 
submission of the sample for sequencing.  
2. Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.  
3. ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1 within 14 days prior to study 
registration.  
4. Women and men of childbearing p otential must be willing to use an 
effective method of contraception (e.g. hormonal or barrier method 
of birth control; abstinence) from the time consent is signed until 4 
weeks after protocol therapy discontinuation.  
5. Women of childbearing potential must h ave a negative pregnancy 
test within 30 days prior to study registration.  Women should be 
counseled regarding acceptable birth control methods to utilize from 
the time of screening to start of treatment.  If prior to treatment after 
discussion with the su bject it is felt by the treating physician there is 
a possibility the subject is pregnant a pregnancy test should be 
repeated.  
NOTE:   Women are considered not of childbearing potential if they 
are surgically sterile (they have undergone a hysterectomy, bil ateral 
tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy), or they are 
postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months.  
6. Women must not be breastfeeding.  
7. Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed triple negative 
(ER-/PR-/HER2 -) invasive breast cancer, c linical stage I -III at 
diagnosis (AJCC 6th edition) based on initial evaluation by physical 
examination and/or breast imaging prior to study registration.  
NOTE:   ER, PR, and HER2 status will be confirmed by central 
pathology review prior to randomization.  ER and PR will be 
considered negative if ≤ 1 0% of cells stain weakly positive. HER2 
will be considered negative if scored 0 or 1+ by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) or 2+ by IHC associated with a 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) ratio of < 2.0 or < 6 copies 
per cell.  
8. Must have completed preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy.  
NOTE:  Acceptable preoperative regimens include an anthracycline 
or a taxane, or both. Participants who received preoperative therapy 
as part of a clinical trial may enroll. Parti cipants may not have 
received adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery prior to 
randomization. Bisphosphonate use is allowed.

Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 27APR 2018         Page 6 of 56 
 9. Must have completed definitive resection of primary tumor. For those 
that do not require radiotherapy, the most recent surgery for brea st 
cancer must have been completed at least 14 days prior, but no more 
than 84 days prior, to study registration.  
NOTE: Negative margins for both invasive and ductal carcinoma in 
situ (DCIS) are desirable, however participants with positive margins 
may enr oll if the treatment team believes no further surgery is 
possible and participant has received radiotherapy. Participants with 
margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible. 
Either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery (including 
lumpectomy or partial mastectomy) is acceptable.  
10. Must have significant residual invasive disease at the time of 
definitive surgery following preoperative chemotherapy.  Significant 
residual disease is defined as at least one of the following:  
• Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) classification II or III 6 
• Residual invasive disease in the breast measuring at least 2 cm. 
The presence of DCIS without invasion does not qualify as 
residual disease in the breast.  
• Residual invasive disease in the breast measuring at least 1 cm 
with any lymph  node involvement (does not include metastases 
in lymph node which are only detected by 
immunohistochemistry).  
• Any lymph node involvement that results in 20% cellularity or 
greater regardless of primary tumor site involvement (includes 
no residual disease in the breast).  
11. Must have an FFPE tumor block with tumor cellularity of 20% or 
greater.  
NOTE:  Prior to registration, the tumor cellularity will be confirmed 
by central pathology review. Percent values will be double -checked at 
Paradigm (a Next Generation S equencing Company).  
12. BREAST RADIOTHERAPY  
• Whole breast radiotherapy is required for participants who 
underwent breast -conserving therapy, including lumpectomy or 
partial mastectomy. Participants must have completed 
radiotherapy at least 14 days prior (but no  more than 84 days 
prior) to study registration.  
• Participants with a primary tumor > 5 cm or involvement of ≥4 
lymph nodes who require a mastectomy must also have 
radiotherapy pre - or post -operatively at the discretion of the 
treating physician.   For part icipants with primary tumors ≤ 5 
cm or with < 4 involved lymph nodes, provision of post -
mastectomy radiotherapy is at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  Registration must occur within 84 days of the 
completion of the last local therapy.  
• For radiati on required prior to surgery, the participant must 
register within 84 days of surgery.  Also, participants in this 
BRE12 -158 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 27APR 2018         Page 7 of 56 
 situation would not be required to have additional post -
mastectomy radiation therapy.  
• For those participants who do not require radiation, re gistration 
must be within 84 days of surgery.    
13. No stage IV (metastatic) disease, however no specific staging studies 
are required in the absence of symptoms or physical exam findings 
that would suggest distant disease.  
14. No treatment with any investigational agent within 30 days prior to 
study registration.  
15. No history of chronic hepatitis B or untreated hepatitis C.  
16. Adequate laboratory values must be obtained within 14 days prior to 
study registration.  
• Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9.0 g/dL  
• Platelets ≥  100 K/mm3  
• Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 K/mm3  
• Calculated creatinine clearance of ≥ 50 cc/min using the 
Cockcroft -Gault formula  
• Bilirubin  ≤ 1.5   ULN (except in participants with 
documented Gilbert’s disease, who must have a total bilirubin 
≤ 3.0 mg/dL)  
• Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) ≤  2.5  ULN  
• Alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT)  ≤ 2.5  ULN  
17. Left ventricular ejection fraction within norma l limits obtained within 
30 days prior to study registration.  
NOTE:  Participants with an unstable angina or myocardial infarction 
within 12 months of study registration are excluded.  
18. No clinically significant infections as judged by the treating 
physician.  
19. Must consent to allow submission of adequate archived tumor tissue 
sample from definitive surgery for genomic assessment of tumor.  
20. Must consent to collection of whole blood samples for genomic 
analysis.  
21. No clinically significant arrhythmia or baseline ECG  abnormalities in 
the opinion of the treating physician.  
22. No active second malignancy (except non -melanomatous skin cancer 
or incidental prostate cancer found on cystectomy): Active second 
malignancy is defined as a current need for cancer therapy or a high  
possibility (> 30%) of recurrence during the study. Previous 
contralateral breast cancer is allowable unless it meets “active” 
criteria as stated above.

 STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  
 Sample Size Justification  
The primary endpoint for this trial is 2 -year DFS. In order to detect an 
improvement in the fraction of participants  free from disease at 2 -year 
from 40% in the Control Arm B to 63.2% in the genomically directed 
Experimental A rm A (corresponding to an HR=0.5), 136 participants  will 
have 80% power to detect a difference in DFS using a two -side log -rank 
test with 0.05 level of significance (calculation done using nQuery 
Advisor 7.0) and assuming exponential survival.  
 
Here, we have assumed a three -year accrual time period, and each 
participant  will subsequently be followed for two years. This three -year 
accrual period will ensure the ability to recruit 192 participants . 
Considering other factors, such as no drug calls and failed sequencing, 
we will ultimately register 136 participants  who w ill be randomized into 
one of two Arms.  
 
Participant  Characteristics  
The participant  characteristics will be summarized in each treatment 
group for demographics, baseline disease characteristics, and medical 
history.  The two treatment groups will be compa red using standard 
methods such as t -tests and chi -square tests.  
 
Analysis of Primary Objective  
The comparison of DFS between the two groups will be made using an 
unstratified Kaplan -Meier analysis with a log -rank test to evaluate for 
differences.  A speci fic comparison of 2 -year DFS will be made using a 
two-sample test based on the complementary log -log transformation as 
suggested in Klein, et al. As a supportive analysis, a stratified log -rank 
test will be done using the stratified randomization factors: 1) 
neoadjuvant anthracycline versus not and 2) lymph node involvement at 
time of definitive surgery versus not. In addition, sensitivity analyses 
using Cox regression may be carried out to identify prognostic factors 
and provide adjusted estimates of the t reatment group differences in DFS.  
 
Analysis of Secondary Objectives  
As support for the primary objective, overall DFS and 1 -year DFS will be 
compared using the same techniques above.  One -year DFS will be tested 
using the test described above for 2 -year D FS. Toxicity  variables will be 
tabulated separately for the two groups. Five-year OS will be compared 
between treatment groups using the same methodology as DFS. In 
addition , characteristics of tumor specimens and genomic DNA will be 
correlated with recurrence and toxicity. Continuous measures will be 
correlated with binary variables (e.g. recurrence and toxicity) using 
maximal chi -square tests and continuous variables using P earson or 
Spearman correlations. Binary variables such as tumor and genomic 
characteristics will be correlated with recurrence and toxicity using chi -
square or Fisher’s Exact test. All of the correlative analyses are 
BRE12 -158 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 27APR 2018         Page 9 of 56 
 exploratory and are designed to complem ent efforts in other trials using 
this approach.  
 
In the secondary analysis, the participant s without an actionable mutation 
in Control Arm B will be compared to the rest of participant s in Control 
Arm B. Here our hypothesis is that these participant s may have different 
disease biology. We will also compare the entire control Arm B 
(randomized and non -randomized) to Experimental Arm A. This analysis 
assumes that those participant s randomized into Control Arm B and those 
participant s without actionable mutat ions have similar disease biology, 
and thus there is no participant  selection bias. The secondary analyses 
will look at DFS, OS, and other toxicity outcome. We will also run the 
drug specific analysis using frailty model.  
 
Analysis of Exploratory Objective s 
During the period required for accrual, it is expected that the ability to 
recommend genomically directed therapies will evolve. Changes may 
occur as data from ongoing  correlative studies reach the level of evidence 
required to enter the selection algori thm and/or as new therapies are FDA 
approved and thus available for recommendation. To explore the impact 
of this evolution, sequencing data from all participants  will be reanalyzed  
and represented along with the initial clinical information to the CGTB 
within 1 month of completion of the enrol lment. CGTB 
recommendations for optimal therapy will be compared with the initial 
recommendations and the proportion with a change in recommendation 
will be reported.  
 
Another exploratory analysis will evaluate each s pecific drug’s effect on 
efficacy parameters  (i.e. DFS) and toxicity. Because the number of 
participants receiving a specific drug is expected to be relatively small, 
we will analyze  this using a frailty model for DFS. In this model, we 
allow different dru g effects to share the same variance estimate in order 
to gain power. This analysis will be implemented in R package, coxph 
function. The dru gs’ effect on toxicity will be analyzed  with the 
generalized linear mixed effect model, implemented in SAS PROC 
GLIMMIX or GENMOD.  
 
The other exploratory analysis will depend on the results of sequencing. 
Similar to the drug specific analysis, we will use either the frailty model 
or the generalized linear mixed model to analyze clinical outcomes.

 1 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
1.1 Primary (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy for breast cancer  
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has a well -established role in the management of both early -stage and 
locally advanced breast cancer. Providing treatment prior to definitive surgery not only improves 
the abilit y to achieve breast conservation, but also allows determination of in vivo  sensitivity to 
therapy and offers an ideal platform for clinical research. Although many will experience 
shrinkage in tumor volume with neoadjuvant therapy, at the time of surgery o nly about 33% of 
patients will experience a pathologic complete response (pCR) with complete lack of invasive 
tumor tissue in the surgical specimen. Long -term follow -up of neoadjuvant studies consistently 
demonstrates significantly improved survival in ind ividuals with pCR, with comparatively inferior 
outcomes in those with residual disease at surgery1-4 The impact of residual disease is more 
striking in patients with triple negative (ER -/PR-/HER2 -) disease compared to patients with other 
molecular phenotyp es5. Unfortunately, patients with triple negative disease who have substantial  
(Miller -Payne classification6 1 or 2 or residual cancer burden classification II or III7) residual 
disease at the time of surgery have a dismal prognosis with only 35 -40% remain ing free of 
recurrence at 2 years4,8. In short, the presence of viable invasive tumor after appropriate 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy reflects inherent resistance and portends an exceedingly high risk of 
subsequent recurrence.  
 
Recently, a phase III trial, CREATE -X16, randomized over 900 HER2 -negative patient s with 
residual disease in the breast or lymph node involvement after completion of standard neoadjuvant 
therapy to 8 cycles of capecitabine at 2500 mg/m2/day (2 out of 3 weeks) vs. no additional 
therapy . Approximately 64% of the population had hormone receptor positive disease and 36% 
had triple negative disease. The trial data was presented at the 2015 San Antonio Breast 
Conference (Toi et al.) after 2 years follow -up from the time of last patient rando mized. The DSM 
committee terminated the trial early after the trial results had met a planned interim analysis of 
benefit for the addition of capecitabine. The capecitabine arm demonstrated an improvement in 
DFS from 74% in the control arm to  82% in the ca pecitabine arm (HR=0.70; p=0.005) .  The 
addition of capecitabine also improved  OS from 89.2% to 94% (HR=0.60; p<0.01) . The hazard 
ratios were highly significant in the triple negative subgroup  (HR=0.58; 95% CI=0.39 -0.87) .  
Thus, capecitabine can be conside red a standard option in this setting  for triple negative breast 
cancer . As this represents only a single trial (with prior data not demonstrating benefit for the 
addition of capecitabine in the neoadjuvant nor adjuvant settings), observation can also be 
considered an option after discussion of risk to benefit ratio with the patient.   
 
1.2 Rationale for genomically directed approach  
Currently, many of the therapies delivered in the neo -adjuvant and adjuvant setting for breast 
cancer are non -specific cytotoxic a gents that are not selected based on specific characteristics from 
the tumor. Increasingly, molecular aberrancies have opened the door for potential design and use  
of drugs to capitalize on dysregulated pathway s. Examples  of successful drugs matched to 
aberrancy include  various categories of aberrancy : over-expression  (e.g. trastu zumab for HER2 
overexpression9), translocation (e.g. imatinib for BCR -ABL  translocation10) and point mutation 
(e.g. vemurafenib for BRAF activating mutation; V600E11). In general, the therapeutic index for 
these targeted approaches has been exceptionally high. This proposal will attempt to capitalize on 
this basic philosophy by matching an expansive list of FDA -approved agents with molecular 
aberrancies determined by cutting edge assessment of the tumor using massively parallel 
sequencing.

 This study will capitalize on an exceptional setting to test a genomic approach  and will enrich for 
participants  who have already been exposed to standard non -specific chemotherapy i n the 
neoadjuvant setting with substantial residual disease. This patient population, by defi nition, is 
resistant to traditional  non-specific cytotoxic chemotherapy.  Also, by nature of the high risk of 
relapse, they are clearly in need of additional (and h opefully superior) targeted therapy. Since 
these participants  have already received standard therapy, the concern for  a “high -risk” patient not 
receiving potentially life -saving therapy will not be  an issue. Further, since all drugs used in this 
proposal a re FDA -approved and will be used as single agents, there should be no toxicity concerns 
beyond those side effects that  are well recognized . From a genomic standpoint, the use of these 
agents in a relatively early point in the tumor’s life (i.e. adjuvant se tting) will minimize som e 
intrinsic concerns such as genom ic drift.12 This proposal , then, sets out to optimally test the 
hypothesis that a  genomically directed therapy will improve outcome  over standard of care in a 
population that needs a better standard . 
 
1.3 Use of next generation ( massively parallel) sequencing to identify therapeutic targets  
Paradigm is a non-profit joint venture between  the University of Michigan and the International 
Genomics Consortium  (IGC) . Paradigm ’s cancer diagnostic test, PCDx  (which will be the 
platform implemented in this protocol) is a  sophisticated and comprehensive CLIA next -
generation sequencing cancer diagnostic test available for cancer analysis on formalin fixed 
paraffin sections. PCDx uses a custom analysis on the PGM Ion Torrent platform to provide 
patients and physicians with a blueprint of the underlying mechanisms of a patient’s disease 
through next -generation sequencing for mutations, copy number variants ( CNV ), mRNA and 
chromosomal changes including allelic burden , potential treatment approaches, assessment of 
level of evidence, and comprehensive invento ry of relevant clinical trials.  This clinical decision 
support tool and analysis is run in a CLIA compliant lab and reports both paper and electronic 
results in  approximately  4-5 working days.  
 
The PCDx test identifies all actionable classes of genomic alterations in hundreds of cancer -
related genes having a 1 or 2 level of evidence including:  
• DNA Copy Number Variants (e.g. MYC)  
• Base Substitutions  
• Insertions  
• Deletion s (e.g. EGFR)  
• Chromosomal Rearrangements (e.g. EML4 -ALK)  
• mRNA Expression  
• Splice Varia nts 
• Isoforms  (e.g. ERCC1, KIT)

The Paradigm panel queries greater than 500 genetic regions of interest . This includes evaluation 
of tens of thous ands of genomic abnormalities, driver mutations , and  changes associated with 
clinical trials . This panel has a near -perfect ability to detect DNA mutations due to a high depth of 
coverage;  typically over 3000 . This platform also includes a proprietary lib rary creation 
technique that almost completely eliminates the risk of DNA damaged during the FFPE process 
from generating false mutation calls. This was validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas project 
(TCGA) and is the only capture enrichment technology allow ed into TCGA. Copy number assays 
are also sequenced with high coverage, allowing excellent sensitivity; t ypically able to detect a 
change of a single chromosome copy . 
 
The PCDx results report with recommended agent will be sent to Hoosier Cancer Research 
Network, Inc. (HCRN)  for disbursement to the CGTB.  
 
1.4 Expected actionable mutations/pathways with recommended agents  
We have performed an in silico  study to predict the most commonly identified and the relative 
diversity  of compounds likely to be identified u sing this approach . To do this, we used 72 cases of 
triple -negative breast cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) , a publically available 
resource of cancer genomics data . For each of these 72 cases we collated the data regarding 
somatic mutations, copy number variation, and differential gene expression (compared to a panel 
of 20 normal breast tissues) and submitted this data through the Paradigm PCDx informatics 
pipeline. F or each case, a comprehensive report was generated associating genomic aberrancies 
with potential therapeutics. The report may list any of the following: 1) FDA -approved, 
compendia recommended drug; 2) FDA -approved drug off compendia for breast cancer; 3) Drug 
that is FDA -approved, but with clinical evidence of the biomarker only sufficient to reach the level 
for consideration of a clinical trial; 4) Biomarker that has a high level of evidence connected with 
a drug that is not yet FDA approved.  
 
Approximate ly 82% of the reports generated from these 72 in silico  cases were able to either select  
an FDA -approved drug , or highlight a pathway for which an FDA -drug could be selected. Table 1  
provides the 14 drugs that were identified from these cases with an actio nable mutation or 
pathway. Appendix  A summarize s the detailed  information for these 14 drugs. To maximize 
consistency, we have established  recommen ded agents  for the commonly identified  biomarkers 
(Table 1). Specifically, there is the potential for multipl e drugs to be linked to a specific genetic 
aberration. For example, if COX2 is upregulated, there are multiple potential NSAIDs that could 

BRE12 -158 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 27APR 2018         Page 16 of 56 
 be recommended. To max imize hom ogeneity, we will select a preferred  agent in these  cases (e.g. 
COX2 overexpression sh ould result in use of celecoxib if this genetic aberration is considered to 
be highest priority).

The drugs listed in Table 1 will be dosed according to the FDA -approved package inserts ( See 
Appendix A ). While the drugs listed here will likely comprise a large number of our expected 
drug recommendations , the nature of this trial makes it impossible to anticipate the optimal 
genomic target for all participants . Thus, if the genomic data identifies a less  common actionable 
mutation/pathway not included in Appendix A , the Sponsor investigator must obtain approval of a 
protocol exception from  the local IRB per local institutional policy . If the same genomic change s 
(and drug ) are recommended for a second pat ient, we will conclude that this represents a  recurrent 
aberrancy rather than a sporadic event . With this knowledge , the protocol will be amended to add 
the mutation/pathway and resulting drug.  
 
1.5 Cancer Genomics Tumor Board  (CGTB)  
Realizing that optimal treatment recommendations cannot be made based on sequencing data 
alone, the CGTB will be responsible for the final treatment recommendation.  
The CGTB includes a diverse group of members with specific areas of expertise including:  
 
• Sponsor Investigator  (Schneider)  
• Genomics/informatics expert (Radovich)  
• Breast medical oncologist with clinical trial expertise (Miller)  
• Director of the I ndiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center (IUSCC)  Phase I 
Program (O’Neil)  
• Ethics and supportive care (Helft)  
 
BRE12 -158 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 27APR 2018         Page 17 of 56 
 If it becomes necessary to replace a CGTB member, a new member with similar experience and 
expertise will be recruited. At least three members of the CGTB will meet to review the 
sequencing report and relevant clinical data for each participant .  If only tw o permanent members 
of the CGTB are available to meet, an ad hoc  member ( other medical oncologist with clinical  trial 
expertise) may fill in as the third required member. Assuming there are available cases, t he review  
will take place during  a standing week ly meeting . Optimal therapy recommendations will be made 
by consensus. Although the participants  will be de -identified during the CGTB deliberations, their 
underlying comorbidities and medical history may reveal the identity to the treating physician. To 
avoid the potential that knowledge of the sequencing data might influence the treating 
investigator’s approach (especially if randomized to Control Arm B), any CGTB member who is 
also the treating physician will be recused and excluded from those discussion s. 
 
Hoosier Cancer Research Network  will provide the CGTB with the Paradigm PCDx sequencing 
results report , recommended agent , and summary of the participant’s relevant  clinical data.  The 
CGTB will consider the genomic data along with the participant’s prior treatment history, ongoing 
toxicities, and comorbidities. Preference will be given to the treatment identified by the 
sequencing data unless a significant clinical or safety contraindication exists for that therapy. For 
example, if TOP2A is identified for a participant who previously received anthracycline -based 
neoadjuvant therapy, the CGTB would not recommend additional doxorubicin  due to excess 
potential for toxicity and lack of enthusiasm for re -treatment with the same drug. Similarly, if a 
particip ant has persistent neuropathies, a drug known to cause substantial neuropathy would not be 
recommended . 
 
If more than one actionable mutation/pathways drug is identified  (this occurred  in 30% of cases in 
our preliminary data set), the  CGTB  will make the final recommendation  for a single drug based 
on the following  criteria : 1) Strength of the data that demonstrates an  association  between the 
genomic aberration and the selected drug ; 2) Participant’s prior exposure to therapies;  and 3) Co-
morbidities or persistent toxicities.  
 
All participants  and treating investigator s will be blinded to sequencing results and CGTB 
deliberations until the time of relapse.  Reports will automatically be made available to the treating  
investigator at that time . 
 
1.6 Protocol therapy  
All participants  for whom the CGTB recommended an optimal therapy will be randomized to 
Experimental Arm A or Control Arm B. If there is a technical failure in sequencing, no actionable 
mutations/pathways are identified, or the CGTB cann ot make a treatment recommend ation , 
participants  will be assigned to Control Arm B.  Based on our preliminary data;  we suspect this 
will happen for 18% of our population. Participants who are assigned to Control Arm B will not 
be included in the primary analyses.  
 
Participants in Experimental Arm A will begin protocol therapy within 10 working days of 
randomization.  
 
  
BRE12 -158 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 27APR 2018         Page 18 of 56 
 Experimental Arm A (genomically directed monotherapy)  
For participants  randomized to Experimental Arm A, HCRN  will send the CGTB treatment 
recommendation to the treating investigator  in a secure  email message . Drug specific details for 
the top 14 most commonly expected drugs can be found in Appendix A . After discussion of th e 
drug specific information and expected toxicities, participants  will be asked to provide additional 
consent to proceed with protocol therapy.  
 
Consenting participants  will receive the CGTB recommended therapy in accordance with the FDA 
label  for 4 cycles ( 12-16 weeks  depending on cycle length). For oral drugs administered 
continuously, 3 weeks will be considered one cycle. Dose reductions, modifications, or 
discontinuation  will be in accordance with the FD A label and standard clinical practic e. 
 
Control Arm B (standard therapy)  
Those randomized to Control Arm B (and those with no drug call who are assigned to Control 
Arm B) will follow the direction of their treating physician. Recently, a phase III trial, CREATE -
X16, randomized over 900 HER2 -negative patient s with residual disease in the breast or lymph 
node involvement after completion of standard neoadjuvant therapy to 8 cycles of capecitabine at 
2500 mg/m2/day (2 out of 3 weeks) vs. no additional therapy. Approximately 64% of the 
population  had hormone receptor positive disease and 36% had triple negative disease. The trial 
data was presented at the 2015 San Antonio Breast Conference (Toi et al.) after 2 years follow -up 
from the time of last patient randomized. The DSM committee terminated t he trial early after the 
trial results had met a planned interim analysis of benefit for the addition of capecitabine. The 
capecitabine arm demonstrated an improvement in DFS from 74% in the control arm to 82% in 
the capecitabine arm (HR=0.70; p=0.005).  T he addition of capecitabine also improved OS from 
89.2% to 94% (HR=0.60; p<0.01). The hazard ratios were highly significant in the triple negative 
subgroup (HR=0.58; 95% CI=0.39 -0.87).  Thus, capecitabine can be considered a standard option 
in this setting  for triple negative breast cancer. As this represents only a single trial (with prior data 
not demonstrating benefit for the addition of capecitabine in the neoadjuvant nor adjuvant 
settings), observation can also be considered an option after discussion of risk to benefit ratio with 
the patient. While not recommended, other therapies can be used as deemed appropriate by the 
treating physician.

consent is signed until 4 weeks after protocol therapy discontinuation.  
 
5. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 30 days prior 
to study registration.  Women should be counseled regarding acceptable birth control 
methods to utilize from the time of screening to start of treatment.  If prior to treatment 
after discussion with the subject it is felt by the treating physician there is a possibility the 
subject is pregnant a pregnancy test shou ld be repeated.

without invasion does not qualify as residual disease in the breast.  
• Residual invasive disease in the breast measuring at least 1 cm with any lymph node 
involvement (does not include metastases in lymph node which are only detected by 
immunohistochemistry).  
• Any lymph node involvement that results in 20% cellularity or greater regardless of

12. BREAST RADIOTHERAPY  
• Whole brea st radiotherapy is required for participants who underwent breast -
conserving therapy, including lumpectomy or partial mastectomy. Participants must 
have completed radiotherapy at least 14 days prior (but no more than 84 days prior) to 
study registration.  
• Participants with a primary tumor > 5 cm or involvement of ≥4 lymph nodes who 
require a mastectomy must also have radiotherapy pre - or post -operatively at the 
discretion of the treating physician.   For participants with primary tumors ≤ 5 cm or 
with < 4 in volved lymph nodes, provision of post -mastectomy radiotherapy is at the 
discretion of the treating physician .  Registration must occur within 84 days of the 
completion of the last local therapy.  
• For radiation required prior to surgery, the participant must  register within 84 days of 
surgery.  Also, participants in this situation would not be required to have additional 
post-mastectomy radiation therapy.

 4 PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION   
All participants must be registered thr ough HCRN’s electronic data capture (EDC) system . A 
subject is considered registered when an “On Study ” date is entered into the EDC system  
 
Subjects must be registered prior to starting protocol therapy and begin therapy within 10 days  of 
randomization.  
 
NOTE: Central pathology review may be conducted any time after definitive surgery. Consenting 
participants  may be pre -registered to the study and proceed with central pathology review before 
full eligibility has been confirmed. However , ALL of the eligibility criteria must be met and 
formal study registration completed prior to submission of the sample for sequencing.  
Blinding :  The protocol therapy  is not blinded to the participant or the  treating  investigator . 
However, all participants  and treating investigators will be blinded to sequencing results and 
CGTB deliberations until the time of relapse.  
 
5 TREATMENT PLAN  
If a subject randomizes to Arm B (control group), medications are not covered by the study and 
would be handled similarly to  standard of care medication administration.  
 
5.1 Pre-medication  
It is strongly recommended that all participants  receive adequate anti -emetics , hydration, and 
supportive care  as directed by the FDA package insert . 
 
5.2 Drug Administration  
All drugs will be administered in accordance with the FDA -label including dose, route, and 
frequency. Dose modifications will be based on the FDA -label  and standard clinical practice . 
Participants  will receive four cycles of therapy. As cycle length may va ry, the total duration of 
therapy may range from 12 -16 weeks. The following conventions will be followed when 
considering cycle length:  
 
Treatment administered  Cycle length  
every 4 weeks  4 weeks  
every 3 weeks  3 weeks  
Weekly  3 weeks  
continuous oral  3 weeks  
 
See Appendix A  for detailed information on the most commonly expected  drugs.  
 
All therapy in Experimental Arm A will be based on the participant’s actual weight unless the 
FDA package insert recommends a fixed dose. The actual weight at screening should be used for 
calculating body surface area (BSA). The BSA may be recalculated based on the actual weight at 
the start of each treatment cycle but recalculation and dose adjustment is only required  if a 
participant’s weight changes by ≥ 10%.  
 
  
BRE12 -158 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 27APR 2018         Page 23 of 56 
 5.3 Missed doses  
In general , participants  should be encouraged to comply with the FDA -recommended treatment 
schedule. However, if IV treatment is missed for reasons other than toxicity ( e.g. participant  
vacation, family emergency, etc.), participants  able to resume treatment within 2 weeks should 
receive the full planned number of cycles. If a delay of more than 2 weeks is required, the missed 
IV treatment should be omitted (i.e. not made up) and participants  should proceed with the next 
cycle as orig inally scheduled. For those participants  receiving oral agents, missed doses should not 
be made up and should continue for the duration planned at the outset of therapy.  
 
5.4 Supportive Care  
The use of supportive care including antibiotics, blood transfusions , etc. will be permitted as 
clinically indicated and according to institutional guidelines.  
 
5.5 Concomitant Medications  
Medications known to interact with the recommended drug will be considered by the CGTB at 
time of drug selection. If a participant  is taking a drug with a significant interaction risk , and that 
drug is deemed important for the participant ’s ongoing health, the selected therapy will be 
considered contra indicated  by the CGTB . Bisphosphonate use is allowed.  
 
6 DOSE MODIFICATIONS   
The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 will be used to 
grade adverse events.  
 
Participants  enrolled in this study will be evaluated clinically and with standard laboratory tests 
before and at regular intervals during their parti cipation in this s tudy as specified in section 7.  
Schedule of Events.  
 
Participants  will be evaluated for adverse events  different in type and/or severity from what would 
be expected from the approved drug labeling , serious adverse events, and adverse events requiring 
protocol therapy  interruption or discontinuation at each study visit for the duration of their 
participation in the study. As the agents used in this study are FDA approved with well-defined 
safety profi les, only serious adverse events, and adverse events resulting in dose modification 
and/or treatment discontinuation will be entered to the database and analyzed.  
 
For participants  in Experimental Arm A, all doses should be modified as outlined in the FDA -
approved package insert  (See Appendix A ). 
 
Participants  in Experimental Arm A discontinued from the treatment phase of the study for any 
reason will be evaluated at least 30  days (± 7) after the last dose of protocol therapy .

8 CRITERIA FOR DISEASE EVALUATION  
DFS is d efined as the duration of time from randomization to time of a D FS event, defined as local 
failure (invasive), regional failure, distant failure, contralateral breast cancer (invasive or non -
invasive), or death from any cause. The diagnosis of local or dis tant recurrence should  ideally be 
pathologically confirmed , however if biopsy if not possible, radiology confirmation by CT, MRI, 
or PET scan is acceptable.  
 
9 BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES  
HCRN  will provide sample collection  kits and shipping supplies for tissue  sample submissions  
and for blood  samples  collected for genomic and correlative studies . All sample labels will only 
include the HCRN  participant study ID#, date/time of collection and sample type. No personal 
identifiers will be included.  Refer to the CLM  associated with this protocol for collection, 
processing, labeling , and shipping instructions.  
 
9.1 Central Pathology Review  
Analysis by an American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and College of American 
Pathology (CAP) expert panel suggests that approxi mately 20% of ER, PR, and HER2 tests 
performed in community laboratories are inaccurate with a fairly equal distribution of false 
positive an d false negative results. T he ASCO/CAP guidelines seek to improve test quality and 
BRE12 -158 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 27APR 2018         Page 29 of 56 
 reliability . As such, ER, PR , and HER2 status will be confirmed by central pathology review prior 
to randomization.  
• ER and PR will be considered negative if ≤ 1% of cells stain weakly positive.  
• HER2  will be considered negative if scored 0 or 1+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or 2+ 
by IHC associated with a fluorescence in situ  hybridization (FISH) ratio of  < 2.0 or < 6 
copies per cell . 
 
Additionally central pathology review will confirm the cellularity of the residual disease sample (>  
20% required for eligibility).  If the sample fails to meet the percent value required , a new sample 
(if available) will be requested  from the participating site.  
 
Formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tissue from the residual disease removed at the time of 
definitive surgery (mandato ry) is required to be submitted for central pathology review . The 
estimated timeframe to complete the central pathology review and provide a results report is 5-7 
working days. Once the central pathology review is complete  and participant  eligibility is 
confirmed , formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tissue will need to be sent to Paradigm.  
Paradigm will  double -check the cellularity percent values and complete the genomic sequencing. 
Refer to the CLM  for collection, labeling and shippin g instructions . 
 
NOTE: Central pathology review may be conducted any time after definitive surgery. Consenting 
participants  may be pre -registered to the study and proceed with central pathology review before 
full eligibility has been confirmed. However , ALL of the eligibility criteria must be met and 
formal study registration completed prior to submissio n of the sample for sequencing.  
 
9.2 Samples for genomic sequencing  
Prior to registration , the tumor cellularity will be confirmed by central pathology review . Percent 
values will be double -checked at Paradigm (a Next Generation Sequencing Company). A 
minimum of 20% tumor cellularity is needed to initiate the next generation sequencing analysis. 
Paradigm will use a proprietary tumor enrichment technology called L aser Capture Enrichment 
(LCE) that allows the macroscopic and microscopic isolation of populations of cells such as 
cancer cells to be separated from the non -malignant populations. The LCE technology has been 
validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas project (T CGA) and is the only capture enrichment 
technology allowed into TCGA. Paradigm can provide the mutational next generation sequencing 
analysis when the cellularity is equal to or above 20% tumor nuclei. LCE will be used to enrich 
above the 20% tumor cellula rity cut point. Above 50% tumor nuclei, the full Paradigm analysis of 
mutation, copy number abnormality, chromosomal aberrations , and mRNA can be performed in 
totality on formalin fixed paraffin sections.  When the tumor cellularity is between 20% and 50% 
tumor nuclei than some subset of the Paradigm analysis can be performed and thus all samples 
above 20% will be sent.

11 ADVERSE EVENT  MANAGEMENT  
Adverse events will be collected and reported as described below for the Experimental Group 
(Arm  A) only.  Arm B subjects are undergoing treatment that is considered standard of care, 
recording and reporting of adverse events will no t be done . 
 
11.1 Definitions of Adverse Events  
 
11.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant  or clinical trial subject administered an 
investigational product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
treatment.  An adverse event (AE) can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational product.  
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if they induce 
clinical signs  or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic testing.  
 
11.1.2  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence resulting in one or more of the 
following:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (defined as an event in  which the participant  was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appro priate medical 
and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant  or may require intervention (e.g., 
medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition 
above).  Examples of such events include, but are not limited  to, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
not resulting in hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
11.1.3  Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event not mentio ned in the package insert or the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with the package insert.  
 
11.2 Adverse Event (AE) Reporting  
Adverse events will be recorded from the time of consent and for at least 30 days after final 
protocol treatment. As the agents used in this study are FDA -approved and have a well -defined 
safety profile, only serious adverse events, and adverse events resulting in dose modification 
and/or treatment discontinuation will be reported. All AEs considered related to trial med ication 
BRE12 -158 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 27APR 2018         Page 32 of 56 
 will be followed until resolution, return to baseline, or deemed clinically insignificant, even if this 
occurs post -trial. 
 
11.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting  
 
11.3.1  Study Center (Site) Requirements for Reporting SAEs  
Treating i nvestigators and other site personnel must report any SAEs occurring during the course 
of the study within 24 hours  of discovery of the event.  This includes events both related and 
unrelated to the product.  
 
The definition of “related ” being that there is  a reasonable possibility the drug caused the adverse 
experience.  
 
Table 1 5: Relationship of adverse event to the investigational agent  
Unrelated  The Adverse Event is clearly not related to the agent(s)  
Unlikely  The Adverse Event is doubtfully related  to the agent(s)  
Possible  The Adverse Event  may be related  to the agent(s)  
Probable  The Adverse Event is  likely related to the agent(s)  
Definite  The Adverse Event is clearly related  to the agent(s)  
 
The completed SAE Report ing Form (see Study Procedure  Manual) must be emailed to 
safety @hoosiercancer.org  at HCRN  within 24 hours  of discovery  of the event.  The treating 
investigator is responsible for informing the IRB and/or the Regulatory Authority of the SAE as 
per local requirements.  
 
The original copy of the SAE Report ing Form  along with  the email cover sheet and/or fax 
confirmation sheet must be kept within the study binder at the study site.  
 
Follow -up information should be emailed to safety @hoosiercancer.org  at HCRN , using a new 
SAE Report ing Form stating that this is a follow -up to the previously reported SAE and giving the 
date of the original report. Each re -occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event 
should be reported as a follow -up to that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow -up 
information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated , 
and whether the participant continued or with drew from study participation.  
 
11.3.2  Death and Immediately Life -Threatening Events  
Any death and immediately life -threatening event from any cause while a participant is receiving 
protocol therapy  or up to 30 days after the last dose of protocol therapy , or any death and 
immediately life -threatening event occurring more than 30 days after protocol therapy  has ended 
but which is felt to be treatment related must be reported within 24 hours of discovery  of event .  
All deaths must be reported primarily for the purposes of SAE reporting; however, deaths due 
unequivocally to progression are not SAEs.  
 
Your local IRB should be notified and their reporting procedure followed.  The completed SAE 
Reporting Form should be emailed to safety @hoosiercancer.org  at HCRN  within 24 hours  of 
discovery  of the event.

 11.3.3  HCRN  Requirements for Reporting SAEs  
HCRN  will voluntarily report to the FDA , regardless of the study site of occurrence, any SAE that 
is reasonably related  (i.e. possible, probable, definite) to the protocol therapy and different in type 
and/or severity from what would be expected from the approved drug labeling  (unexpected) . 
Unexpected fatal or life -threatening experiences associated with the protocol therapy will be 
voluntarily reported to the FDA as soon as possible but in no event later than 7 calendar days after 
initial receipt of the information by HCRN . All other serious  unexpected experiences associated 
with the use of the protocol therapy will be voluntarily reported to the FDA no later than 15 
calendar days after initial receipt of the information by HCRN .

12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Table 1 6: Data Sets for Protocol Endpoints  
Data Set/Endpoint  Criteria  
Disposition  All participants registered into the study  
General safety  All participants in Experimental Arm A receiving at least one dose of any 
protocol therapy  
Efficacy  All participants (Experimental Arm A receiving at least one dose of any protocol 
therapy and Control Arm B) with at least one post-Randomization disease 
evaluation   
Participants  will be included in the analysis for the treatment to which they were randomized.  
 
12.1 Sample Size  Justification  
The primary endpoint for this trial is 2 year DFS. In order to detect an improvement in the fraction 
of participants  free from disease at 2 -year from 40% in the Control Arm B to 63.2% in the 
genomically directed Experimental A rm A (corresponding to an HR=0.5), 136 participants  will 
have 80% power to detect a difference in DFS using a two -side log -rank test with 0.05 level of 
significance. The power calculation was calculated and validated by SAS, R, and nQuery and 
based on SAS (Tabl e 17).

 Here, we have assumed a three -year accrual time,  and each  participant will subsequently be 
followed for two years. This three -year accrual period will ensure the ability to recruit 192 
participants . Considering other factors, such as no drug calls and failed sequencing, we will enrol l 
136 eligible participants  who will be randomized into one of two Arms . 
 
12.2 Participant Characteristics  
Participant  characteristics will be summarized by treatment group for demographics, baseline 
disease characteristics, and medical history.  The two treatment groups will be compared using 
standard methods such as t -tests and chi -square tests.  
 
12.3 Analysis of Primary Obj ective  
The comparison of DFS between the two groups will be made using an unstratified Kaplan -Meier 
analysis with a log -rank test to evaluate for differences.  A specific comparison of 2 -year DFS will 
be made using a two -sample test based on the complement ary log -log transformation as suggested 
in Klein, et al15. As a supportive analysis, a stratified log -rank test will be done using the stratified 
randomization factors: 1) neoadjuvant anthracycline versus not and 2) lymph node involvement at 
time of defini tive surgery versus not. In addition, sensitivity analyses using Cox regression may be 
carried out to identify prognostic factors and provide adjusted estimates of the treatment group 
differences in DFS.  
 
Participants who are assigned  to Control Arm B will  not be included in the primary analyses.  
 
12.4 Analysis of Secondary Objectives  
As support for the primary objective, overall DFS and 1 -year DFS will be compared using the 
same techniques above.  One -year DFS will be tested using the test described above for 2 -year 
DFS. Toxicity  variables will be tabulated separately for the two group s. Five-year OS will be 
compared between treatment groups using the same methodology as DFS. In addition , clinical and 
demographic characteristics of tumor specimens and genomic DNA will be correlated with 
recurrence and toxicity. Continuous measures will be correlated with binary variables (e.g. 
recurrence and toxicity) using maximal chi -square tests and continuous variables using Pe arson or 
Spearman correlations. Binary variables such as tumor and genomic characteristics will be 
correlated with recurrence and toxicity using chi -square or Fisher’s exact test . All of the 
correlative analyses are exploratory and are designed to compleme nt efforts in other trials using 
this approach.  
 
In the secondary analysis, the participant s without an actionable mutation in Control A rm B will 
be compared to the rest of participant s in Control A rm B. Here our hypothesis is that these 
participant s may h ave different disease  biology . We will also compare the entire  control A rm B 
(randomized and non -randomized) to Experimental A rm A. This analysis assumes that those 
participant s randomized into Control A rm B and those participant s without actionable mutati ons 
have similar disease  biology , and thus there is no participant  selection bias. The secondary 
analys es will look at DFS, OS, and other toxicity outcome. We will also run the drug specific 
analysis using frailty model.

 12.5 Analysis of Exploratory Objective s 
During the period required for accrual, it is expected that the ability to recommend genomically 
directed therapies will evolve. Changes may occur as data from ongoing correlative studies reach 
the level of evidence required to enter the selection algorith m and/or as new therapies are FDA 
approved and thus available for recommendation. To explore the impact of this evolution, 
sequencing data from all participants  will be reanalyzed  and represented along with the initial 
clinical information to the CGTB with in 1 month of completion of the study enrol lment. CGTB 
recommendations for optimal therapy will be compared with the initial recommendations and the 
proportion with a change in recommendation will be reported.  
 
Another exploratory analysis will evaluate ea ch specific drug’s effect on the participant  efficacy 
outcome (i.e. DFS) and toxicity. Because the number of participants receiving a specific drug 
treatment is expected to be relatively small, we will analyze  using a frailty model for DFS. In this 
model, we allow different drug effects to share the same variance estimate, in order to gain power. 
This analysis will be implemented in R package, coxph function. The drug effects on the toxicity 
will be analyzed  with the generalized linear mixed effect model, i mplemented in SAS PROC 
GLMMIX or GENMOD.  
 
The other exploratory analysis will depend on the results of sequencing. Similar to the drug 
specific analysis, we will use either the frailty model or the generalized linear mixed model to 
analyze clinical outcome s. 
 
13 TRIAL MANAGEMENT  
 
13.1 Quality Controls and Quality Assurance  
 
13.1.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
This study will have a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that will review and monitor 
study progress, toxicity, safety and other data from this trial. The DSMB is separate from the 
IUSCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) referred to below. The board is chaired 
by an independent medical oncologist external to this trial. Questions about participant safety or 
protocol performance will be addressed wi th the Sponsor investigator, statistician , and study team 
members. Should any major concerns arise; the DSMB will offer recommendations regarding 
whether or not to suspend the trial.  
 
The DSMB will meet twice a year to review accrual, toxicity, response , and reporting information. 
The DSMB will meet annually after the last participant is off treatment and has completed the end 
of treatment evaluation. Information to be provided to the DSMB may include: participant accrual, 
treatment regimen information, adv erse events , and serious adverse events reported by category, 
summary of any deaths on study, audit , and/or monitoring results.  
 
The DSMB will provide a recommendation to the team after all information is reviewed. This 
information should also be provided to the IRB at the time of continuing review for the trial.  
 
13.1.2  Data Safety Monitoring Committee  
HCRN will provide the DSMC with data summary reports as requested.  The DSMC will also 
review DSMB reports regarding this study.

 13.1.3  HCRN Oversight Act ivities  
This trial is subject to auditing and/or monitoring. The HCRN  data management team provides 
safety oversight for all HCRN  trials. Specific data and safety monitoring tasks conducted by 
HCRN  include:  
• Review all adverse events requiring expedited rep orting as defined in the protocol  
• Notify participating sites of adverse events requiring expedited reporting  
• Provide trial accrual progress and safety information to the sponsor -investigator  
• Provide data summary reports to the sponsor -investigator  
• Submi t data summary reports to the Data Safety Monitoring Board per their Charter.  
 
13.1.4  Study Monitoring  
For-cause monitoring visits to the trial sites may be made periodically during the trial.  Source 
documents will be reviewed for verification of agreement with data as submitted via the data 
collection system.  The  treating investigator/institution guarantee access to source documents by 
HCRN or its designee and appropriate regulatory agencies.  
 
The trial site may also be subject to quality assurance audit by appropriate regulatory agencies.  
 
It is important for the treating investigators and their relevant personnel to be available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits and for sufficient time to be devoted to the process.  
 
13.2 Data Ha ndling and Record Keeping  
 
13.2.1  Case Report Forms  and Submission  
This study will utilize electronic case report form (eCRF) in the Electronic Database Capture 
(EDC) system .  The EDC system is a comprehensive database used by HCRN and , properly used , 
is complian t with Title 21 CFR Part 11. Access to the data through the EDC system is restricted by 
user accounts and assigned roles. Once logged into the EDC system with a user ID and password, 
EDC defines roles for each user, which limits access to appropriate data.  User information and 
passwords can be obtained by contacting HCRN at 317 -921-2050.  
 
Generally, clinical data will be electronically captured in the EDC system  and correlative results 
will be captured in the EDC system  or other secure database. If procedures on the study calendar 
are performed for standard of care, at minimum, that data will be captured in the source document. 
Select standard of care data will also be captured in the EDC system , according to study -specif ic 
objectives. Detailed guidelines for eCRF completion can be found in the eCRF Instructions . 
 
The completed dataset is the sole property of HCRN and should not be made available in any form 
to third parties, except for authorized representatives of approp riate Health/Regulatory Authorities, 
without written permission from HCRN.

 13.2.2  Record Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from Health Authorities/ HCRN , the treating  investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participants  (sufficient information to link 
records; e.g., hospital records), all original signed informed consent forms, copies of all eCRFs, 
and detaile d records of drug disposition. To comply with international regulations, the records 
should be retained by the  treating investigator in compliance with regulations.  
 
During data entry, range and missing data checks will be performed on -line.  The checks to be 
performed will be documented in the Data Management Plan for the study.  A summary report 
(QC Report) of these ch ecks together with any queries resulting from manual review of the eCRFs 
will be generated for each site and transmitted to the site and the site monitor. Corrections will be 
made by the study site personnel. This will be done on an ongoing basis.  
 
13.3 Confide ntiality  
There is a slight risk of loss of confidentiality of subject information. All records identifying the 
participant will be kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws and/or 
regulations, will not be made publicly available . 
 
Information collected will be maintained on secure, password protected electronic systems. Paper 
files that contain personal information will be kept in locked and secure locations only accessible 
to the study team. Samples that are collected will be identified by a participant study number 
assigned at the time of registration to the trial. Any material issued to collaborating researchers 
will be anonymized and only identified by the participant study number.  
 
Participants will be informed in writing t hat some organizations including the treating i nvestigator 
and his/her research associates, HCRN, IRB, or government agencies, like the FDA, may inspect 
their medical records to verify the information collected, and that all personal information made 
available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in accordance with local data 
protection laws.  
 
If the results  of the study are published, the participant’s identity will remain confidential.  
 
13.4 Changes to the Protocol  
Study procedures w ill not be changed without the mutual agreement of the sponsor -investigator  
and HCRN . 
 
If it is necessary for the study protocol to be amended, a new version of the study protocol 
(amended protocol) will be generated by HCRN  and must be approved by each participating site 
IRB, and if applicable, local regulatory authority.  Local requirements must be followed.  
 
If a protocol amendment requires a change to the Informed Consent Form, then the IRB must be 
notified.  Approval of the revised Written Informed Con sent Form by the IRB is required before 
the revised form is used.  
 
The Sponsor investigator is responsible for the distribution of these documents to his or her IRB, 
and to the staff at his or her center.  The distribution of these documents to the regulat ory authority 
will be handled according to local practice.

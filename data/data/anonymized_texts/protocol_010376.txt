Trial site(s) Multi -centre trial conducted in approximately  30 countries
Clinical phase Phase II
Trial rationale The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy  and safet y of three 
oral doses of BI 690517 over 14 weeks, alone and in combination 
with empagliflozin, in male and female patients with diabetic and 
non-diabetic CKD. The results of this trial will be c rucial for the 
decision about further development of BI 690517 and will support 
the dose selection for future trials
Trial objective(s) The main objectives of the trial are to demonstrate the efficacy  of BI 
690517, alone and in combination with empagliflo zin, and to 
characterise the BI 690517 dose -response relationship in patients 
with diabetic and non -diabetic CKD b y assessing 3 doses and 
placebo
Trial endpoints The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in log 
transformed Urine Albumin Creatinine Ratio (UACR) measured in 
First Morning Void urine after 14 weeks.
Secondary endpoints:
UACR respon se I, defined as a decrease of at least 30% absolute 
change in First Morning Void urine of UACR from baseline 
to 14 weeks.
UACR respon se II, defined as a decrease of at least 15% absolute 
change in First Morning Void urine of UACR from baseline to 14 
weeks
Trial design Randomised, double -blind, parallel dose group, placebo -controlled 
clinical trial to investigate the effect of three doses of BI 690517 
alone and in combination with empagliflozin over 14 weeks in

Statistical m ethods Amixed -effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) will be used 
to obtain adjusted mean change s from baseline for the treatment 
effects of continuous endpoints. This MMRM model will include 
fixed effect of treatment as categorical variable, and fixed effect of 
baseline at each visit as continuous variable. Visit will be considered 
as repeate d measures with an unstructured covariance structure for 
the within -patient variability . For dose -finding, predicted average 
response for each dose group and the estimated covariance matrix 
from the MMRM will be used in the multiple comparison 
procedures a nd modelling (MCPMod) analy sis. Several possible 
dose-response patterns will be evaluated in the MCPMod to identify  
the best -fitting model and optimal dose for further development.

1Additional visits may have to be scheduled -for example, in case of dose reduction due to potassium elevation or when an ACTH Challenge test is required for patients whose cortisol level is ≥3 µg/dL (82.8 nmol/L )
and< 11 µg/dL ( 303.5nmol/L )with suggestive signs or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency .
2As UACR and eGFR may not be regularly tested, where allowed sites may pre -screen patients by sending a spot urine sample to measure UACR and/or a blood sample to measure eGFR to their local lab. This is 
optional and requires a specific approved pre -screeni ng informed consent. Pre -screening results will not be collected in the CRF or used to determine final eligibility in this trial.  Pre -screening can be performed at any 
point prior to screening.  The full consent form must be signed before screening ( Visit 1) procedures are performed .The Screening Period should be no more than 21 days from first screening procedure to first 
randomisation . Screening assessments may be conducted over more than one day. The Randomised run -in Period may start as soon as all sc reening procedures have been performed and laboratory results have been

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020received and reviewed. Therefore the 21 days prior to Visit 2 that are indicated in the flow chart may be less. Sc reening procedures may be repeated once during the screening period if the patient is not eligible for a 
transient medical condition (e.g. elevation of certain lab parameters due to an acute infection). 
If the patient currently does not fulfil all inclusion/exclusion criteria but may, in the op inion of the investigator, fit the criteria later on, the patient is allowed to be rescreened once, as long as screening into this 
trial is still open. Re -screening examinations will only be performed after a written informed consent has been taken again f rom the patient. I RT must be contacted to register the re -screening and obtain a new 
patient number.
If screening is not completed within 21 days, the patient will be a screen failure. I RT should be contacted to record the screen failure. I f appropriate th e patient may be re -screened (see above).
3Visit 5 should be no more than 7 days after Visit 4. Where the patient does not meet the additional inclusion criteria 13 and 14 based on lab tests performed at Visit 4, the eGFR and potassium cannot be re -tested and 
the patient should permanently discontinue the study. In case of unexpected delay of Visit 5, a repeat safety sample must be taken to obtain potassium and eGFR results needed to confirm eligibility for the Treatment 
Period.
4In case a patient needs or wishes to terminate all trial treatment prematurely and if the patient agrees, the patient should undergo the procedures for End of Treatment (EoT). Please see section 6.2.5 for details.
5Follow -up Visit 1 (FUp1) must always take place at least 7 days after the EoT visit.
6These visits can either be performed at the I nvestigational site or at the patient’s home. All local approvals for this must be in place and confirmed by the sponsor.  Consent for home visits must also be o btained from 
the patient. See section 6.2.2 for further details.
7There are various ways that Telemedicine contacts (phone call or video call) can be used during this trial:
1. Telemedicine contact to provide support for patient’s urine sampling. Before the patient does their first UACR sampling at home the investigational site staff should contact the patient to ensure 
the patient is comfortable with the sampling process. The other timepoints marked as ‘(X)’ are suggested times to contact the patient if they are shipping samples directly from home to ensure they 
understand the instructions given to them. The site may, at their discretion, offer support with further home sampling accord ing to the individual needs of a patient. 
2. Visit 3 must be performed as telemedicine contact for all patients, unless they prefer to come to the trial site instead.
3. Phone/ video calls may also take place at any other time if needed to support the patient.
8Informed consent must be obtained before the f irst screening assessment. It can be obtained on the day of the screening visit or within 4 weeks prior to the first screenin g assessment. The consent discussion should 
include showing the patient the home sampling kits and explaining this procedure.
9 AllECGs will be done prior to the daily dose and evaluated by the investigator or a designee. See section 5.2.4 .
10ACTH Challenge test is required for all patients at screening , and for all patients whose morning serum cortisol level at EoT (or at the time of premature discontinuation of BI  690517 / placebo) is< 18 µg/dL (496.6
nmol/L ).  After the start of BI  690517 / placebo treatment at Visit 5 , if morning serum cortisol level is≥ 3µg/dL (82.8 nmol/L )and< 11 µg/dL  (303.5 nmol/L) and the patient shows suggestive signs or symptoms of 
adrenal insufficiency , an ACTH Challenge test should be performed as soon as possible .  Serum cortisol basal sample must be performed before ACTH -injection (0.25 mg). I njection time must be recorded and has to 
be done within 4 hours of the patient’s usual waking time . Post -dose samples for serum cortisol must be taken 30 (± 5) minutes after the injection, to ensure patients have normal adrenal fu nction. The time for the post 
ACTH -injection blood samples must be recorded in the patient’s medical record . See section 5.2.5.1.
11Patients do not need to be fasted for the blood sampling for the safety laboratory. See section 5.2.3 .
12eGFR at clinic visits will be determined from serum creatinine analysed by the central laboratory. To confirm eligibility, th e eGFR at screening will be used.
13
14Lab samples for serum cortisol m ust be collected within 4 hours of the patient’s usual waking time .
15Post-dose serum cortisol should be taken 1 hour (+/ -10 minutes) after drug administration.
16See  Flow Chart for samples and timings. For further instructions see section 6.1.
17The pharmacogenomics samples may be collected at Visit 5 or anytime afterwards.
18Optional biobanking samples will only be collected if the patient has signed the biobanking informed consent separate from th e main consent for the trial. See section 5.5.
19A pregnancy test is required for all women of child -bearing potential. This will be a serum pregnancy at Screening (Visit 1). Thereafter a urine pregnancy test will be performed . A home pregnancy test may be used 
at the Visit 3 timepoint.  I f urine pregnancy test is not acceptable to local authorities , a blood test can be done at a local laboratory. More frequent pregnancy testing should be done if required by local regulation and /or 
authority or per investigator judgment .
20To confirm eligibility, at visit 1, UACR measured in spot urine (midstream u rine sample) by the central laboratory will be used. Should the first test for UACR at screening not match inclusion criteria due to UACR 
variability, this can be repeated once. If the second result does not meet the eligibility criter ia the patient should be screen failed. 
21Please refer to FMV and 24 -hour Urine Sampling Flowchart .
22Patients will need to complete a paper diary at home in the 2 days prior to  to record times of tr ial drug intake .  Patients will also need to record start and stop times for 24 -hour urine
samples in a paper diary before Visit 5 and EOT .

kit dispensed at the visit.
24All AEs, SAEs and AESI  will be collected from informed consent until FUp1 (end of residual effect period). Please see section 5.2.6.2.1 .
25After FUp1 until the individual patient’s end of trial, the investigator should report any cancers of new histology and exace rbations of existing cancer, all trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESI s. 
Please see section 5.2.6.2.1.
26After the individual patient’s end of trial, the investigator does not need to actively monitor the patient for new AEs but s hould report any occurrence of cancer and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment 
related AE SIs of which the investigator may become aware of by any means of communication, e.g. phone call. Those AEs should be reported on the BI  SAE form, but not on the CRF.
27In the case of premature discontinuation during the Randomised Run -in Period ,FUp1.1, FUP1.2 and FUp2 do not need to be conducted .  
28At Visit s 4and5, only compliance to Empagliflozin/placebo will be calculated.  At Visits 6, 7, 8, 9 and EOT, compliance will be calculated for both Empagliflozin/placebo and BI  690517/placebo.

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 20201. INTRODUCTION
1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Chronic Kidney  Disease (CKD) is the leading cause of kidney  damage and end-stage kidney  
disease (ES KD). The 5- year survival rate of dialysis patients is 35%, which decreases to onl y 
25% in diabetic dial ysis patients. As a result, CKD puts a large burden on healthcare s ystems 
worldwide, e.g. in the U.S. costs per patient exceed $75,000 annually . In addition to direct 
renal consequences, reduced kidney  function is also a major trigger for cardio- vascular 
events. Overall, around 12% of the general population in Europe have 
CKD stages 3 to 5 [ R19-1388 ], with considerable variation across countries, ranging from 
4.1% to 25.5% [ R19-1184 ].
Diabetes is the main cause of CKD in most countries, accounting for 40% or more of new 
cases [ R19-0901]. As glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declines, there is a linear increase in 
mortality , with 2- to 5-fold increases in patients with GFR <45 mL /min/1.73 m² compared 
with patients with GFR >60 mL /min/1.73m² [ R14-4475]. Declining kidney  function is 
associated w ith an increasing risk for coronary  heart disease, stroke, and heart failure [ R15-
5158 ;R15-2265 ]. Diabetic nephropath y is the leading cause of kidney  damage and end -stage 
kidney  disease (ES KD), a ccounting for >40% of patients on dialy sis. 
At present, onl y a limited number of therapeutic options are available to delay kidney  
function decline in patients with CKD. Angiotensin- converting enz yme inhibitors (ACEis) 
and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can reduce albuminuria and slow the rate of 
progression in proteinuric diabetic kidney  disease . However, in clinical trials in patients with 
diabetic nephropathy , the relative risk reduction for the composite primary  endpoint of all -
cause death, ES KD and doubling of serum creatinine in trials was only moderate (16% in the 
RENAAL trial and 19% in the IDNT trial) [ R02-0327 ; R02-2101]. 
Recently , the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 ( SGLT -2)inhibitor empagliflozin has been 
shown to reduce the risk of kidney  disease progression in people with ty pe 2 diabetes. An 
exploratory  anal ysis of the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial indicated that empagliflozin 
reduced the incidence of the composite outcome of doubli ng of creatinine, the need to start 
kidney replacement therapy , or renal death by  46% (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 -0.75). These 
benefits were similar regardless of baseline ACEi or ARB use and there was no evidence of 
an increased risk of h yperkalaemia or acute k idney  injury [P16-06807 )]. Inthe EMPEROR -
Reduced trial, which was conducted in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction, empagliflozin reduced the risk of the exploratory  composite renal endpoint ( chronic 
dialy sis, kidney  transplant, or sustained reduction in eGFR) b y 50% in the overall trial 
population and was consistent on 
patients with and without CKD at baseline. Cardio- Kidney  
benefits of e mpagliflozin are currentl y being investigated in patients with CKD and a high 
risk for progression in the ongoing EMPA -KIDNEY study [P18-10838].
Increasing evidence is indicating that SGLT -2 inhibitors are likely  to become a new treatment 
option for patients across a broad range of 
CKD phenotypes . The SGLT -2 inhibitor 
canagliflozin has received FDA approval for the treatment of patients with diabetic kidney  
disease and albuminuria >300 mg/g . In the CREDENCE trial, canagliflozin provided a

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020relative risk reduction of 30% for the composite endpoint of doubling of serum creatinine, 
ESKD or renal/CV death on top of standard of care [ R19-1356 ]. A large -scale clinical 
outcome trial (DAPA -CKD) evaluating the SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in patients wi th 
CKD (with or without type 2 diabetes and albuminuria >200 mg/g ) was stopped earl y due to 
overwhelming efficacy . Data reported in August 2020 showed that dapagliflozin resulted in 
39% relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite primary  endpoint ( ≥50% eGFR 
decline/ESKD/renal or CV death). Dapagliflozin also resulted in 39% RRR for composite 
secondary  endpoint of CV death and HF hospitali sation and 31% RRR for all- cause mortality
[R21-1080].
Current guideline recommendations have started to incorporate this new evidence b y 
recommending SGLT2i with proven benefits as an integral part of the treatment regimen for 
patients with ty pe 2 diabetes and CKD or CV risk [ P20-09106]. Recommendations for non -
diabetic kidney  disease are likely  to follow soon in the light of the new and upcoming 
evidence. Despite this advance, the residual renal and cardiovascular risks for patients remain 
unacceptabl y high for patients with CKD, warranting continued efforts to provide new 
treatments, particularly  for fast -progressing patients (with GFR reductions 
>3ml/min/1.73m²/y ear) that are at considerably  increased risk.

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 20201.2.2 Empagliflozin
Empagliflozin is indicated for reduction of blood glucose in patients with Type 2 Diabetes 
Mellitus (T2DM), and for cardiovascular (CV) death risk reduction in patients with T2DM 
and established CV disease.
Mode of action
Empagliflozin is an orally available SGLT -2 inhibitor, promoting urinary  glucose excretion. 
Empagliflozin also reduces blood pressure, arterial stif fness and measures of my ocardial 
workload, likely  through various mechanisms, as well as improving other CV risk factors 
(e.g. uric acid, visceral fat mass, albuminuria; [ P15-00589, P15 - 09541]).
Key pharmacokinetic characteristics
In humans, empagliflozin predominantly  showed linear pharmacokinetics both after single
oral doses and at stead y-state. Empagliflozin was rapidly  absorbed, reaching peak levels at
approximately  1.5 h, followed by  a biphasic decline with the terminal elimination half -life
ranging from 10 to 19 h. 
Drug interaction
!oclinically  relevant pharmacokinetic interactions areanticipated with BI 690517 (see
section 1.2.1 ).

Empagliflozin has been studied as part of a global development program including more than 
20,000 patients with ty pe 2 diabetes treated in clinical studies of which more than 13,000
were treated with empagliflozin, either alone or in combination with metformin, a 
sulfony lurea, a PPARγ agonist, dipeptidy l peptidase -4 (DPP -4) inhibitors, or insulin.
In the EMPA -
REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin was shown to be superior in reducing the 
primary  endpoint, a composite of CV death, non- fatal my ocardial infarction (MI), or non-
fatal stroke 
driven by  38% reduction of CV death compared to placebo on top of standard of 
care in patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease. An 
improved overall survival driven by  a reduction in CVdeath was also observed. 
Empagliflozin reduced the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure and the composite of 
cardiovascular death or hospitali sation for heart failure compared with placebo. The risk of 
new or worsening nephropathy (including onset of macroalbuminuria, doubling of serum 
creatinine, and initiation of renal replacement therapy  (i.e. haemodialy sis)) was reduced in 
the empagliflozin group compared to placebo. 
In the EMPEROR- Reduced study in patients with HFrEF with LVEF<40%, with or without 
T2DM , empagliflozin significantly  reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation 
due to heart failure compared with placebo. Additionally , empagliflozin significantly  reduced 
the risk of recurrent hospitalisation due to heart failure, and signific antly reduced the rate of 
eGFR decline .
In completed clinical studies, empagliflozin was well tolerated in non-diabetic healthy
volunteers, patients with ty pe 2 diabetes, and patients with heart failure (NYHA class II -IV) 
and reduced ejection fraction wit h or without diabetes mellitus. The frequencies of overall 
AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation and SAEs were similar to placebo. There was an 
increase in frequency  of genital infections with the use of empagliflozin. Empagliflozin 
treatment also i ncreased urination and thirst. There was a small increase in total cholesterol, 
low density  lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high -density  lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 
and no significant changes of LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio and in trigl ycerides. In addition, 
incre ases in haematocrit, haemoglobin and red blood cell were observed with empagliflozin. 
No clinically  relevant changes in electroly tes, including potassium, were observed with 
empagliflozin. No changes to heart rate and no QTc prolongation have been observed . The 
safet y profile of empagliflozin in patients with kidney impairment and decreased eGFR down 
to 15 mL /min/1.73m2was consistent with that reported in patients with normal kidney  
function; there is no experience in patients with end -stage 
kidney  disease and in patients on 
dialy sis.

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 20201.3 RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL
The renin -angiotensin- aldoste rone s ystem (RAAS) play s a key  role in the development and 
progression of kidney  disease in patients with diabetic and non -diabetic CKD. Aldosterone is 
a key  element of the RAAS and exerts its effects primarily  via the mineralocorticoid receptor 
(MR). In patients with CKD and t ype 2 diabetes, treatment with the MR antagonist (MRA) 
finerenone in the FIDELIO DKD trial resulted in lower risks of CKD progression and 
cardiovascular events than placebo [ R20-3706 ]. However, use of MRAs, particularl y in 
patients with reduced kidney  function, is limited by  the risk for hy perkalaemia associated 
with MRAs.
BI 690517 is a potent and highl y selective inhibitor of human aldosterone sy nthase (ASI). It 
is under development f or the treatment of CKD in patients with and without diabetes. 
While MRAs block only  MR-dependent aldosterone effects, BI 690517 acts to lower the 
circulating aldosterone level, thereb y decreasing both MR -dependent and MR -independent 
effects of aldosteron e. It is expected that this dual mechanism will lead to greater therapeutic 
benefit with less effect on MR- mediated electrolyte regulation ( potassium ( K+)effects). BI 
690517 therefore has the potential to slow or even stop the progression of CKD and may  also 
have beneficial extra -renal effects on the cardiovascular s ystem.
The main aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy  and safet y of three oral doses of BI 
690517 alone and in combination with empagliflozin over 14 weeks versus placebo in male 
and female patients with CKD as adjunctive to ACEi or ARB treatment. PK and PD will also 
be investigated as a further endpoint. The results of this trial will be crucial for decisions 
about further development of BI 690517 and will support the dose selection for future trials.
In keeping with the assumption that SGL T2i will become an integral part of the standard of 
care for patients with CKD in the upcoming years, the proposed study has been designed to 
provide data on the effects of BI690517 with and witho utcombination of 
empagliflozin. There is a strong h ypothesis that the kidney -protective mode of action of both 
drugs is complementary in nature .While empagliflozin mainly impacts the tubular 
sodium handling leading to a reduced intraglomerular pressure
via modulating 
thetubuloglomerular feedback mechanism, BI 690517 additionally exerts anti -fibrotic and 
and-inflammatory  effects by  ameliorating the deleterious effects of aldosterone. All three 
aspects are playing a pivotal role in kidney  disease progression, providing a good reason to 
believe that the combination of both drugs might result in sy nergistic effects on slowing 
kidney  disease progression .
The proposed phase II study  design will allow to understand the treatment effects of BI 
690517 alone and in combination with empagliflozin which is mimicking the expected 
standard of care for the treatment of CKD and will allow an evaluation of the potenti al to 
further develop the combination of both drugs in phase III.

1.4.1 Benefits
Potential benefits of treating patients with CKD with BI 690517 result from the prediction of 
slowing progression of the disease and 
risk reduction of cardiovascular events, which is only  
partially  achieved by  current standard of care. Treatment with BI 690517 will potentially  
result in decreased progression towards dial ysis or kidney  transplantation due to 
slowing /preventing the progression of kidney damage, which may  directl y translate into 
relevant improvements for patients’ morbidity , mortality , and quality  of life. Bey ond that, it 
may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in the target population. The potential advantage 
of BI 690517 is the red uction in circulating and local aldosterone with its potentially  harmful 
effects on heart and vascular tissue.
Potential benefits of 
SGLT2i treatment include a reduction in albuminuria and slowing of 
the annual decline in estimated glomerular filtration r ate in people with t ype 2 diabetes. 
Additionally ,cardio -kidney  outcome trials have shown clinically  meaningful benefits of 
SGL T2i treatment in albuminuric CKD patients with and without diabetes. Therefore, 
empagliflozin may  have beneficial effects on kidn ey disease progression and cardiovascular 
risk. The EMPA -KIDNEY study  is extending the current knowledge as it is assessing 
clinical benefits in patients with diabetic and non
-diabetic CKD irrespective of the presence 
of albuminuria.
The combination of BI 690517 and empagliflozin, which have complmentary  modes of 
action, have the potential to have s ynergistic effects on slowing kidney  disease progression 
in patients with CKD.
Patients may  also benefit from more frequent clinical monitoring as a result of be ing part of a 
clinical trial.

1.4.3 Discussion
Based on pre -clinical results, BI 690517 has the potential to slow progression of kidney  
damage, delay  end stage kidney  disease (ES KD) and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events 
such as cardiovascular death, my ocardial infarction, stroke and hospitalisation for heart 
failure, in patients with CKD. Based on results of completed clinical trials, empagliflozin also 
has the potential to slow the progression of CKD and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.
A placebo arm for each treatment (empagliflozin and BI 690517) is needed to allow for a true 
assessment of the effects of BI 690517 given with or without empaglifl ozin on the UACR in 
patients with CKD. All patients will be on stable background standard of care therap y of at 
least either ACEi or ARB, and patients will onl y be enrolled in the trial if treatment with 
SGL T2i is not required (see section 3.3.1), therefore the inclusion of placebo treatment is 
considered to be ethically  justifiable.
Patients will be carefull y monitored for side effects during the trial. The Sponsor will 
continuously  assess the risks and benefits of the trial based on accumulating clinical data 
from all clinical trials with BI 690517 and empagliflozin. Any  significant change in risk-
benefit ratio will be communicated to Investigators and patients.
It cannot be excluded that hitherto unknown AEs will be detected in this trial, but given the 
well characterised mode of action and the careful monitoring throughout the trial, the sponsor 
feels that the risks to participating patients are minimized and justified when compared with 
the potential benefit that a successf ul clinical development of BI 690517 could provide to the 
treatment of CKD .
Overall, in the context of the unmet medical need and the anticipated effect on progression of 
CKD in humans and based on the safety profile of BI 690517, the benefit- risk evaluati on of 
this compound, as well as empagliflozin, is considered favourable for the intended trial 
population.

Run-in Period.  Patients will be randomised equally  to receive either empagliflozin 10 mg or 
placebo matching to empagliflozin 10 mg in a 1:1 ratio and will continue taking the assigned 
study  treatment f or 8 weeks.  After 8 weeks of treatment in the Run- in Period, patients will 
enter the Treatment Period. Patients who received empagliflozin in the Run -in Period will be 
randomised equall y into one of four parallel dose groups  in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (see Figure 3.1: 1) 
to receive one of 3 doses of BI 690517 (3 mg QD, 10 mg QD or 20 mg QD) in combination 
with empagliflozin, or empagliflozin alone (empagliflozin plus placebo matching to BI 
690517) .  Patients who received placebo i n the Run -in Period will be randomised equally  into 
one of four parallel dose groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive one of 3 doses of BI 690517 (3 
mg QD, 10 mg QD or 20 mg QD) or placebo. Patients will continue receiving the assigned 
treatment for 14 weeks .
The study  will be blinded to both empagliflozin and BI 690517.  As the BI 690517 film 
coated tablets of the different dose strengths (3 and 10 mg) and empagliflozin have different 
dimensions, in order to minimise possible observer bias and ensure the stud y is blinded 
across dose groups the patients will each take 4 tablets a day  during 
the Treatment Period, as 
described in section 4.1.4.
Eligible patients will be randomi sed to treatment using a stratification algorithm that help s 
ensure balance between the treatment groups with respect to prognostic variables such as
eGFR and UACR .A target of approximately  30% of patients will be randomi sed during the 
run-in period in each of the disease t ypes: diabetic kidney  disease and non-diabetic kidney  
disease .  Patients with diabetes may  have diabetic kidney  disease , non- diabetic CKD
aetiologies , or a combination ; for the purpose of categorising diabetic status
,they will be 
class ified as having diabetic kidney  disease.
From the star t of the screening until the end of the trial, at various time points patients will 
collect their First Morning Void urine for UACR analy sis. These timepoints are listed in the 
FMV and 24-hour Urine Sampling Flow Chart .First morning void urine will be collected 
before the dail y dose of study medication. 24-hour urine samples will also be collected prior 
to the start of the Treatment Period and at EOT. T he patient will be equipped with urine 
collection containers to collect 24 -hour urine and First Morning Void urine .
To decrease the burden on patients, where local regulations allow, samples taken at home 
between visits or when a home visit occurs will be shipped from the patient’s home to a 
central laboratory  for anal ysis. Where this is not possible alternative arrangements will be 
made, e.g. samples taken to the investigational site. Samples taken directly prior to a ph ysical 
visit at the site will be taken to the site to be processed b y the site staff. 
Beyond anal ysis for safety , urine and blood samples in this trial will serve for biomarker 
analysis including UACR.
Following the Treatment Period, or at the time trial treatment in the Run- in Period or the 
Treatment Period is permanently  discontinued, patients will ha ve an End of Treatment (EoT) 
visit.This will be followed by a 4-week follow -up period off-treatment . A first follow -up 
visit (FUp1) at least 7 day s later is considered as the end of the Residual Effect Period (REP).

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020Until the end of REP all AEs and changes to concomitant medication need to be collected, 
documented and reported.   Patients who discontinue prematurel y during the Run -In Period 
must attend FUp1 at least.  All other patients should be encouraged to complete the full 
follow -up period.
During the follow -up period the patient will not be treated with trial medication, but should, 
if possible, continue with any  background treatment they  are on, and will collect additional 
urine at home. After the 4- week follow -up period the patient will have a final visit where 
again blood and urine samples will be collected. With the conclusion of this visit the trial 
participation is complete for the individual patient.
A rise in serum potassium and a drop in eGFR under treatment with BI 690517 cannot be 
excluded. Therefore ,patients will be monitored closely  (weekl yfor 2 weeks ) after starting 
treatment with BI 690517 or matching placebo , and regularl y thereafter . 
In order to be able to address future scientific questions, patients will be asked to voluntarily  
donate biospecimens for banking (please see section 5.5). If the patient agrees, banked 
samples may  be used for future biomarker research and drug development projects, e.g. to 
identify  patients that are more likely  to benefit from a treatment or experience an adverse 
event (AE), or to gain a mechanistic understanding of drug effects and thereby  better match 
patients with therapies.
3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING T HE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
This trial has been designed to assess efficacy  and safet y of BI 690517 alone, and in 
combination with empagliflozin, as like ly initiated in clinical practice.  It also allows the 
opportunity  to find the optimal dose of BI 690517 to be used for future development, on its 
own and / or as a fixed dose combination with empagliflozin.
Patients will initially  start on 8 weeks of empagliflozin or placebo in the Randomised Run-in 
Period and will then receive 14 weeks of treatment with BI 690517 or placebo in the 
Treatment Period in addition to the empagliflozin or placebo treatment.  It is important that 
patients run in on empagliflozin first, before starting treatment with BI 690517, for safety  
reasons since both drugs have potentiall y similar haemod ynamic effects.  8 weeks of 
empagliflozin treatment is considered sufficient to reach stable haemody namic levels, before 
starting with BI 690517. 
A parallel group design was chosen to investigate three different dose regimens of BI 690517 
alone and 
in combination with empagliflozin .  The first parallel group will investigate three 
different dose regimens of BI 690517 and placebo.  The second parallel group will

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020investigate thre edifferent dose regimens of BI 690517, in combination with empagliflozin, 
versus empagliflozin+placebo . Placebo is used to control for observer and subject bias, and 
randomisation to control for assignment bias.
The study  design involves two randomi sations.  The first run-in randomi sation to 
empa gliflozin andplacebo is required for two purposes.  First ly, the run-in randomi sation
will ensure an equally  distributed patient population to the empa gliflozin and placebo groups 
followed b y second randomi sation to treatment groups.   Secondly , a staggered approach
starting empagliflozin during the run-in period, followed by later initiation of BI 6 90517 was 
chosen to enhance patient safet y.  Both ,empagliflozin and BI 690517 , have 
a haemody namic 
effect which 
leads to an acute eGFR decrease . Staggered treatment initia tion is planned to 
reduce such effect .
UACR was chosen as primary endpoint (First Morning Void collection) and secondary 
endpoint (responder rate) because it was shown in previous phase II trials by  others in CKD 
that it is sensitive, differentiating different doses, broad in its dy namic range and reaching a 
stable plateau within a reasonable time after start of treatment. It has been accepted b y 
authorities as dose finding biomarker in CKD. 
Furthermore, the change in UACR correlates 
with long -term clinical and patient relevant outcomes.
Since U ACR is a parameter that varies intra- individually  over time, multiple measurements 
are required at treatment period baseline and during the treatment period especiall y towards 
the end of treatment where a stable response to the drug should be achieved. UACR 
measurements will therefore be collected on 2 consecutive days at 3 timepoints (6 
measurements in total) from Week -2 to Week 0 for treatment period baseline , and from 
Week 12 to Week 14 during the treatment period. Sequential collection of urine duri ng a 4 -
week follow -up period may  deliver exploratory  results of response stability and potential 
rebound effects.
 
In order to detect and mitigate the potential risk of adrenal insufficiency  and Cushing’s 
syndrome, several measures will be implemented.  An ACTH Challenge test will be 
performed at screening to exclude patients with adrenal insufficiency .  Serum cortisol will be 
measured at all visits from Visit 5 until EoT and a further ACTH Challenge test will be 
performed ifadrenal insufficiency is suspected.  Furthermore, free cortisol will be measured 
in 24 -hour urine just prior to the start of BI 690517 treatment and at the e nd of BI 690517 
treatment to determine whether BI 690517 increases cortisol levels
. Patients with adrenal 
insufficiency  or Cushing’s sy ndrome will be discontinued from treatment with BI 
690517.
A data monitoring committee ( DMC) will be establis hed to review safet y data at regular 
intervals.  For further details see section 8.7.

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 20203.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
It is expected that at least 552 patients will be randomised to the Randomised Run- in Period 
from approximately  200 sites. Investigators are expected to be nephrologists, 
endocrinologists or general practitioners. Screening of patients for this trial is competitive, 
i.e. screening for the trial will stop at all sites at the same time once a sufficient number of 
patients has been screened. Investigators will be notified about screening completion and will 
then not be allowed to screen additional patients for this trial. Patients already in screening at 
this time will be allowed to continue to randomisation if eligible .
A minimum of 552 patients 
willbe randomi sed to the Run- in Period to ensure that at least 
480 will complete the study  treatment in order to preserve the trial power by increasing 
sample size .If,during the study  conduct, the drop out rate is higher than projected, 
recruitment may  continue until the required number of patients complete treatment.
A log of all patients enrolled into the trial (i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be 
mainta ined in the Investigator Site File (ISF) irrespective of whether they have been treated 
with investigational drug or not.
The investigator will make every  effort to avoid the inclusion of a patient who does not meet 
all the inclusion criteria and/or meets at least one exclusion criterion. Should such an error 
nevertheless occur, this patient might be immediately  excluded from the clinical trial based 
on individual benefit- risk assessment by  the investigator. The sponsor or delegate will be 
informed as soon as possible.
3.3.1 Main diagnosis for trial entry
Chronic kidney  disease.
Iftheinvestigator judges that the participant must receive empagliflozin (or any  other SGLT -
2 or SGL T-1/2 inhibitor )in the context of prevailing local, national or international guidance , 
the patient should not be included in the trial due to the risk the patient may be assigned to 
placebo alone in the trial .
No potential participant currentl y being treated with empagliflozin (or other SGL T
-2 or 
SGL T-1/2 inhibitor) should be take n off this therapy  to meet the eligibility  criteria.
Please refer to section 8.3.1 (Source Documents) for the documentation requirements 
pertaining to the in -and exclusion criteria.

Permanent Discontinuation
An individual patient will permanentl y discontinue all randomised trial treatment if:
1.The patient develops Acute Kidney  Injury  as per clinical judgement by  the 
investigator .
The Kidney  Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) d efinition 
[R17-2439 ](see section 3.3.3 )is going to be used for guidance .
2.The patient experiences a drop in eGFR1:
≥ 30% from the last measurement of eGFR before the first dose of 
empagliflozin / placebo up to Visit 6 ; and/or
≥ 40% at an y time since the last measurement of eGFR before the first dose of 
empagliflozin/placebo 
3.The patient progresses to end stage kidney disease defined by  either a kidney  function 
decline below an eGFR1of <15 mL/min/1 .73 m2and/or requires renal replacement 
therap y by kidney transplant or dialysis.
4.The patient wants to discontinue trial treatment. The patient will be asked to explain 
the reasons but has the right to refuse to answer. 
5.The patient has repeatedly shown to be non -compliant with important trial procedures 
and, in the opinion of the investigator, the safet y of the patient cannot be guaranteed 
as he / she is not willing or able to adhere to the trial requirements in the future. 
6. The patient needs to take concomitant medication that is not permitted, see section 
4.2.2 . However, if the patient needs to modify  a dose, where a stable dose is permitted 
only, this will not automatically require a discontinuati on. In this case the sponsor can
be consulted.
7.The patient can no longer receive trial treatment for medical reasons such as surgery , 
serious or severe Drug Induced Liver Injury  attributable to the trial drug (see section
5.2.6.1.4 ), other adverse events, or other diseases. 
8.The patient requires treatment for cancer. Some exclusions apply  e.g. for Basal Cell 
Carcinoma –please discuss with sponsor.
9. A female patient becomes pregnant. The patient will be followed up until birth or 
otherwise termination of the pregnancy . The data of the patient will be collected and 
reported in the clinical trial report until last patient last visit and any  events thereafter 
will be reported in the BI Pharmacovigilance database. See section 5.2.6.2.3.
10.The patient does not meet the additional inclusion criteria (see section 3.3.2 ) or the 
additional exclusion criteria (see section 3.3.3 ) assessed before second random ization 
(start of Treatment Period).
An individual patient will permanentl y discontinue BI 690517 / placebo if:
1.The patient’s serum potassium measures ≥ 6.0 mmol/L  by central or any  local 
laboratory , or ≥ 5.6 mmol/L  if down- titration is considered inappropriate. 
                                                
1Where the eGFR drop occurs before the start of BI 690517 / placebo in the Treatment Period (i.e., at Visit 5) , 
but the result is not available until after the patient starts BI 690517/placebo treatment , the patient must still 
permanently discontinue all randomised study treatment , including BI 690517 / placebo .

top of empagliflozin or matching placebo. The target doses of BI 690517 used for this trial 
will be 3 mg QD, 10 mg QD and 20 mg ( 2 x 10mg) QD. 
In health y volunteer phase I trials, doses ranging from 0.7 to 80 mg QD were tested. 
 
 
.In the Phase 1c MRD stud y 1378- 0008, three doses of BI 690517 (3 
mg, 10 mg and 40 mg QD) were tested over 28 day s of treatment.  
There was a numerical 
increase with dose for the change from baseline in serum potassium level. Since the increase 
of serum potassium tends to increase with dose, it is expected that 20 mg dose would have 
less hy perkal aemia cases compared to 40 mg dose. Therefore, to enhance patient safet y 
during this trial, it is proposed to investigate 3, 10 and 20 mg (QD) doses. The other 
important factor in selection of 20 mg dose was supp ression of aldosterone.  The 40 mg dose 
resulted in a substantial suppression ofaldosterone, and it is expected that the lower 20 mg 
dose willresult in less aldosterone 
suppre ssion,reducing the risk of h yperkal aemia.
Down titration (dose reduction) may  be considered based on serum potassium levels (see 
section 4.2.1.1 ).
4.1.3 Method of assigning patient s to treatment groups
After the assessment of all in- and exclusion criteria at visit 2, each eligible patient will be 
randomised into the Randomised Run -in Period according to a randomisation plan.  Patients 
will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio via Interactive Response Tec hnology  (IRT) to either receive 
empagliflozin 10 mg QD or placebo matching to empagliflozin 10 mg QD in a blinded 
manner.

Treatment P eriod via IRT according to a ra ndomisation plan.  Patients will be randomised in 
a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive one of three doses of BI 690517 (3 mg QD, 10 mg QD or 20 mg 
QD) or placebo, in a blinded manner, in addition to the blinded treatment assigned during the 
Run-in Period
. 
Randomisat ion codes will be generated using validated software and kept blinded to the trial 
team, sites and patients. An Interactive Response Technology  (IRT) s ystem will be used to 
screen patients, perform drug assignment, manage initial/ re -supply  ordering of dru g supplies 
and handle emergency  un-blinding.
The investigator will receive all necessary  instructions from the sponsor to access the IRT. 
Detailed IRT functions and procedures will be documented in the User Requirement 
Specifications mutually  agreed b y the sponsor and the I RT vendor. Note that the medication 
number is different from the patient number (the latter is generated during screening via the 
IRT S ystem).
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
At Visit 2, all eligible participants will be randomised into the Run -In period to receive either 
empagliflozin 10 mg or matching placebo in a blinded manner.  The patient will be dispensed 
enough medication for the duration of the Randomised Run -in Period. 
The first dose of 
empagliflozin /placebo will be administered at Visit 2.  1 tablet will be taken daily  for the 8 -
week duration of the run- in period .  
At Visit 5 (start of the Treatment Period), participants will be be randomised into the 
Treatment period to receive one of three doses of BI 690517 (3 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg QD) or 
placebo and this will be given in addition to the empagliflozin or placebo assigned in the run -
in period .  During the Treatment period, both empagliflozin/placebo and BI 690517/placebo 
medication will be dispensed at visits 5, 7, 8 and 9. The medication will be administered 
during the visit on the day s of study  visits.  At the visits where medication is not dispensed 
(Visit 4, Visit 6 and E oT), medication will be administered from the kits dispensed at the 
previous visit.  
At all other visits medication may be administered from the kits dispensed at 
the current visit.
Empagliflozin or matching placebo will be dispensed in wallets of 35 tablets to cover 28 day s

the investigator may  still decide to continue trial treatment. Where permitted by  loca l law and 
regulations, trial medication may  be shipped directly  to the patient ’s home. Shipment of trial 
medication from the site to the patient’s home will also be allowed to support regular visits 
performed at the patient’s home

4.1.5 Blinding and procedures for unblinding
4.1.5.1 Blinding
Patients, investigators and every one involved in trial conduct or analy sis or with any  other 
interest in this double -blind trial will remain blinded with regard to the randomised treatment 
assignments until a snapshot after Last Pa tient Last Visit Primary  Endpoint (L PLVPE), with 
the exception of the Trial Pharmacometrician, PK programmer and Trial Bioanal yst. This 
snapshot will be taken after the last patient completes the EoT Visit, and will be used to 
obtain efficacy , safet y, and PK/PD results, to guide further development plans for BI 690517.
At the timepoint of unblinding of this snapshot, patients and investigators will continue to be 
blinded and will remain so until after database lock when the database is declared read y for 
final anal ysis according to the sponsor’s SOPs. Further details regarding the timepoint of 
unblinding the database for anal ysis are documented in the TSAP. The access to the 
randomisation code will be kept restricted until its release for anal ysis.
The randomisation codes will be provided to bioanalytics before the last patient completed 
the trial to exclude placebo samples from the PK anal ysis. Bioanal ytics will not disclose the 
randomisation code or the results of their measurements prior to the L PLVPE snapshot .
In order to expedite the population PK and PK -PD anal yses and ensure timely  delivery  of 
PK/PD results after database lock and to provide PK data to DMC for consideration when 
evaluating safety  of the trial , specific data must be unblinded and the treatment information 
must be made available to selected individuals. The unblinding procedure and logistics 
specific to this purpose will be provided in a separate document. It should be noted no PK/PD 
results wil l be communicated to the project and trial team prior to the LPLVPE snapshot .
4.1.5.2 Unblinding and breaking the code
Emergency  unblinding will be available to the investigator via IRT. It must only  be used in 
an emergency situation when the identity  of the trial drug must be known to the investigator

participants. The reason for unblinding must be documented in the source documents and/or 
appropriate CRF page.
Due to the requ irements to report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(SUSARs), it may  be necessary  for a representative from BI’s Pharmacovigilance group to 
access the randomisation code for individual patients during trial conduct. The access to the 
code wil l only  be given to authorised Pharmacovigilance representatives for processing in the 
PV database s ystem and not be shared further. 
4.1.6 Packaging, labelling , and re -supply
The investigational medicinal products will be provided by  BI or a designated CRO. The y 
will be packaged and labelled in accordance with the principles of Good Manufacturing 
Practice (GMP).  Re- supply  to the sites will be managed via an IRT s ystem, which will also 
monitor expiry  dates of supplies available at the sites.
Synacthen®(or equi valent) is either provided b y the site or where this is necessary  through 
the sponsor. Where Sy nacthen®is provided b y the sponsor, supplies will be managed viathe 
IRT s ystem.
For details of packaging and the description of the label, refer to the ISF.
4.1.7 Storage conditions
Drug supplies will be kept in their original packaging and in a secure limited access storage 
area according to the recommended storage conditions on the medication label. A 
temperature log must be maintained for documentation.
If the storage conditions are found to be outside the specified range, the Clinical Research 
Associate CRA (as provided in the list of contacts) must be contacted immediatel y.
4.1.8 Drug accountability
The investigator or designee will receive the investigational drug s delivered by  the sponsor or 
delegate when the following requirements are fulfilled:
Approval of the clinical trial protocol b y the IRB / ethics committee,
Availability  of a signed and dated clinical trial contract between the sponsor or delegate and 
the investigational site,
Approval / notification of the regulatory  authorit y, e.g. competent authorit y,

OTHER TREATMENTS , EMERGENCY PROCEDURES , 
RESTRICTIONS
4.2.1 Other treatments and 
emergency procedures
Patients sh ould keep their existing therapies as stable as possible, particularly their therap y 
with either ACEi or ARB, from screening at Visit 1 until the end of follow -up at Visit 
Follow -up 2 (FUp2).
New therapies should only be initiated if necessary for medical reasons. Please see the 
inclusion / exclusion criteria ( sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 respectivel y) and Table 4.2.2.1: 1 for 
full details of restrictions.
If a patient has an adverse event that the Investigator believes may  be related to trial 
medication (either empagliflozin and/or BI  690517) then the Investigator may interrupt the 
medication . Trial treatment may  be restarted at any  time after a temporary  reason for 
treatment discontinuation if medically  justified (see section 3.3.4.1 ). 
Background therapies (ACEi/ARB) or an y other standard of care medications are not 
considered part of the clinical trial supplies, and therefore will not be provided.
There are no special emergency  procedures to be followed.
4.2.1.1 Management of serum potassium elevation

evaluation should be performed to make individual treatment decisions if a prompt 
intervention is required. For BI 690517 the dose might be adjusted to keep potassium levels 
in an acceptable range. The investigator should consider whether a down -titration is

the patient goes back to sleep after urinating earl yin the morning e.g. at 4am, this void does 
not need to be collected and this does not need to be documented. This applies also to an y 
urinations earlier during the night in patients who have nocturia. (However, if the patient is 
an earl y riser and gets up ‘for good’ e.g. at 4am, this would qualify  astheir FMV.) Of course, 
there may  be cases when a patient might go back to bed after their usual rising time. In those 
cases, the void after the usual rising time constitutes the first morning void.
After the s creening period, UACR will be determined on two consecutive days to average 
biological variability  at the timepoints indicated in the FMV and 24 -hour Urine Sampling 
Flow chart . On each collection day  a sample must be obtained from the patient’s FMV.  
Intake of trial medication in the morning should alway s occur after the FMV has been

sampling time points on how to collect and store their urine sample s. Further collection and 
sample storage instructions are given in the laboratory  manual in the I SF and instructions to 
the patient.
Urinary  albumin and creatinine will be anal ysed at a central laboratory  using routine 
validated methods.

ASSESSMENT OFSAFETY
5.2.1 Physical examination
A complete ph ysical examination will be performed at the time points specified in the Flow 
Chart . It includes at a minimum general appearance, neck, lungs, cardiovascular s ystem, 
abdomen, extremiti es, and skin.
Measurement of height and body  weight will be performed at the time points specified in the 
Flow Chart .
The results must be included in the source documents available at the site. 
5.2.2 Vital s igns
Vital signs will be evaluated at the time points specified in the Flow Chart , prior to blood 
sampling.
This includes sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate (electronically  or by 
palpation count for 1 minute) in a seated position after 5 minutes of rest. The blood pressure 
at screening will be performed in triplicate, and a mean of the 3 measurements will be used to 
confirm eligibility .  BP measurements should be recorded to the nearest 1 mmHg. The results 
must be included in the s ource documents available at the site.

Safety  laboratory  parameters to be assessed are listed in Table 5.2.3: 1 . For the sampling time 
points please see the Flow Chart .
A central laboratory  will be used for safet y analyses.The respective reference ranges will be 
provided in the I SF. 
Patients do not have to be fasted for the blood sampling for the safet y laboratory. 
Instructions regarding sample collection, sample ha ndling / processing and sample shipping 
are provided in the Laboratory  Manual in the ISF. Where samples are collected by  the patient 
directly , appropriate instructions in lay  language will be provided.
The central laboratory  will send reports to the investigator. It is the responsibility  of the 
investigator to evaluate the laboratory  reports. Clinically  relevant abnormal findings as 
judged b y the investigator will be reported as adverse events (please refer to section 5.2.6).
Lab tests may  need to be repeated in case of required medical follow -up due to an adverse 
event or if a test was not successful due to incorrect specimen handling or storage. Should a 
patient not fulfil all lab requirements to take part in the trial due to a transient medical 
condition, the patient may continue in the screening phase but not be randomised at Visit 2 
until the re -test of the lab result has shown eligibility  of the patient. Ineligible lab parameters 
may only be re-tested once during the scree ning period.
In case the criteria for hepatic injury  are fulfilled, a number of additional measures will be 
performed (please see section 5.2.6.1 and the DILI Checklist provided in the eDC s ystem). 
The amount of blood taken f rom the patient concerned will be increased due to this additional 
sampling.
The central laboratory  will transfer the results of the anal ysis to the sponsor or del egate.
The CKD -EPI Equation is used for reporting eGFR based on serum creatinine (see appendix 
section 10.2).

cortisol level is < 18 µg/dL  (496.6 nmol/L ) .
In these cases, the ACTH Challenge test should be performed as soon as possible.
A serum cortisol basal sample must be taken before the ACTH injection (iv or im 0.25 mg 
Synacthen®; anequivalent product may be used if Sy nacthen®is not authori sedlocally or 
provided b y the sponsor ). The injection time must be recorded. Serum cortisol will be 
determined 30 (±5) minutes after the injection. The time for the post -ACTH injection blood 
samples must be recorded. The ACTH Challenge test can be performed by a local or central 
laboratory .
Patients will be monitored closely  for at least 30 minutes after the injection.
Alternative conduct of the ACTH test is allowed only if it is in accordance with the local 
practice of diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency . If adrenal insufficiency  is diagnosed with an 
alternative conduct of ACTH test, the details of the ACTH test should be documented in the 
AESI  report to the sponsor.
In this trial, the S ynacthen ®(or equivalent product )for the ACTH challenge test is 
considere d as auxiliary medicinal product ( AxMP ).  In some countries, however, (for 
example, German y)it is considered as investigational medicinal product (IMP) for regulatory  
reasons. For a more detailed description of Sy nacthen®please refer to the current Summa ry 
of Product Characteristics (SmPC).

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 20205.2.6 Assessment of adverse events
5.2.6.1 Definitions of AEs 
5.2.6.1.1 Adverse event
An AE is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessaril y have to have a 
causal re lationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, 
whether considered related or not.
The followin g shoul d also be recorded as an AE in the CRF and BI SAE form (if applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions 
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory  test results, if they  
are judged clinically  relevant by  the investigator.
If such abnormalities already  exist prior to trial inclusion ,they will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
5.2.6.1.2 Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE ,which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria :
-results in death,
-is life -threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have 
caused d eath if more severe ,
-requires in
patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation
- results in persistent or signif icant disability  or incapacity ,
-is a c ongenital anomal y /birth defect,
-is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judg ement which may  jeopard isethe patient and may  require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
abov e definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospitalisation or development of dependency  or abuse. 
For Japan only : An event that possibly  leads to disability  will be handled as ‘deemed serious 
for an y other reason’ and, therefore, reported as an SAE .

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 20205.2.6.1.3 AEs considered “Alway s Serious”
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by  their nature, can alway s be 
considered to be “serious” even though they  may  not have met the criteria of an SAE as 
defined above.
The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC sy stem. A copy  of the latest 
list of “Alway s Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should alway s be 
reported as SAEs as described in section 5.2.6.2.
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as 
described in section 5.2.6.2, subsection s “AE Collection” and “ AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines”.
5.2.6.1.4 Adverse events of special interest
The term adverse events of special interest (AESI) relates to an y specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern fo r prospective safet y monitoring 
and safet y assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from 
other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the sponsor’s 
Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see 
section 5.2.6.2.2 .
The following are considered as AESIs:
1)Potential Severe DILI
2) Events leading to lower limb amputation (LLA)
3)Ketoacidosis
4)Cushing’s s yndrome
5)Adrenal insufficiency
Potential Severe DILI
A potential severe Drug Induced Liver Injury  (DILI) that requires follow -up is defined by  the 
following alterations of hepatic laboratory  parameters: 
An elevation of AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and / or ALT (Alanine 
Aminotransfe rase) ≥3-fold ULN combined with an elevation of total bilirubin ≥2-fold 
ULN measured in the same blood sample, or in samples drawn within 30 day s of each 
other, or
ALT and / or AST elevations ≥10-fold ULN.
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury  alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities after the start of study  treatment need to be followed up according to the “DILI 
checklist” provided in the eDC sy stem.

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020In case of clinical sy mptoms of h epatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results 
(ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are 
analy sed, if necessar y, in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of 
hepatic injury  alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed.
Events leading to lower limb amputation (LLA)
Any event leading to a lower limb procedure of a mputation, auto -amputation or disarticulation 
as defined below is considered as an AESI.
Amputation is a resection of a limb through a bone. Disarticulation is a resection of a limb 
through a joint. Auto -amputation is a spontaneous separation of non -viable portion of the 
lower limb.
Not included in this definition are debridement (removal of callus or dead tissue), procedures 
on a stump (like stump revision, drainage of an abscess, wound revision etc.) and other 
procedures (e.g., nail resection or removal) without a concomitant resection of a limb 
(amputation or disarticulation). (International Working Group of Diabetic Foot, 2015).
Each lower limb amputation, disarticulation, or auto- amputation should be reported separately . 
The SAE report should include the date of the procedure, the level of amputation or 
disarticulation, the medical condition(s) leading to the procedure and if the patient had some of 
theknown risk factor(s) for lower limb amputation.
Ketoacidosis
Ifmetabolic acidosis, ketoacidosis or DKA is suspected further investigations should be
done according tomedical judgement andtheclinical course until adiagnosis ismade 
and/or the patient is recovered.
Due to its mechanism of action, empagliflozin may potentially modify the clinical
presentation of ketoacidosis which may occur at lower plasma glucose levels in patients 
with DM and potentially also in non- diabetic patient population. Thediagnosis of
ketoacidosis inthese patients can be based on arterial pH ≤ 7.30, serum bicarbonate levels
< 15mmol/L andmeasurement ofserum beta-hydroxybutrate levels. Other diagnostic 
criteria which can support thediagnosis ofketoacidosis areurine ketones andanion gap
>10mmol/L .
Investigators should note that not all criteria mentioned above need toapply for the 
diagnosis of ketoacidosis, andclinical judgment should alsobetaken intoconsideration.
5.2.6.1.5 Intensit y (severit y) of AEs
The intensity  (severit y) of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is / are easily  tolerated .
Moderate: Sufficient discomfort to cause interference with usual activity .
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities.

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 20205.2.6.1.6 Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judg ement should be used to de termine the relationship between the adverse event 
and the BI  investigational comp ound ( BI 690517 / empagliflozin / placebo ), considering all 
relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -
challenge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and 
relevant history . 
Arguments that may  suggest that there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be :
The event is consistent with the known pharmacology  of the trial drug.
The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class.
A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced.
No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre -
existing or concomitant diseases, or co -medications).
The event is t ypicall y drug-related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens- Johnson sy ndrome).
An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is reduced).
Arguments that may  sugge st that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days /weeks 
of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the trial 
drug concerned) .
Continuation of the event despite the withdrawal of the medication, taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged 
despite removing the original trigger.
There is an alternative explanation , e.g. situations where other drugs or underly ing 
diseases appear to provide a more likel
y explanation for the observed event than the 
drug concerned.
Disappearance of the event even though the trialdrug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.
5.2.6.2 Adverse event collection and reporting
5.2.6.2.1 AE Collection
The investigator shall maintain and keep deta iled records of all AEs in the patient files.
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by  the 
investigator :
• From signing the informed consent onwards until the follow- up visit 1 all AEs (non -
serious and serious) and all AESI s.

cancers of new histology  and exacerbations of existing cancer , all trial drug related SAEs 
and alltrial drug related AESI s.
•After the individual patient’s end of thetrial: 
the investigator does not need to activel y monitor the patient for new AEs but should 
report any occurrence of cancer and trial drug related SAEs and trial drug related AESIs 
of which the investigator may become aware of by any means of communication, e.g. 
phone call . Those AEs should be reported on the BI SAE form ( see section 5.2.6.2.2 ), but 
not on the CRF.
5.2.6.2.2 AE reporting to the sponsor and timelines
The investigator must report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the AE and SAE eCRF pages immediatel y (within 24 hours )of 
becoming aware of the event. The same timeline applies if follow-up information becomes 
available. In specific occasions, the investigator could inform the s ponsor upfront via 
telephone. This does not replace the requirement to complete the AE and SAE eCRF pages .
With receipt of an y further information to these events, theSAE eCRF page (s)has to be 
updated . For follow -up information the same rules and timeline apply  as for initial 
information. All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient ’s end of 
trialmust 
be followed up until they have resolved, have been assessed as “chronic” or “stable” , or no 
further information can be obtained.
In exceptional cases when the EDC is unavailable for longer than 24 hours, the following 
applies:
The investigator must report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are releva nt for the 
existing SAE or AESI , on the BI SAE form immediately (within 24 hours) to the sponsor ’s
unique entry  point (country  specific contact details will be provided in the ISF ).
Once the EDC is available again, information from the BI SAE form should b e entered in the 
applicable eCRF pages.
5.2.6.2.3 Pregnancy
In rare cases, pregnancy  might occur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled in the 
clinical trialand has taken trial medication, the investigator must report any drug exposure 
during pregna ncy in a trial participant immediately  (within 24 hours) by  means of Part A of 
the Pregnancy Monitoring Form to the sponsor’s unique entry  point.
Similarly , potential drug exposure during pregnancy  must be reported if a partner ofa male 
trialparticipant becomes pregnant. This requires written consent of the pregnant partner.
Reporting and consenting must be in line with local regulations. The ISF will contain the trial 
specific information and consent for the pregnant partner.
The outcome of the pregnanc y associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy must be 
followed up and reported to the s
ponsor’s unique entry  point on the Pregnancy  Monitoring

Urine –exploratory  biomarkers
Urine samples for exploratory  biomarkers will be taken from the urine sample collected for 
safet y at the timepoints shown in the Flow Chart .
Plasma aldosterone and cortisol and their precursors
Blood will be drawn into a K -EDTA blood collection tube at multiple time points as 
indicated in the PK and aldosterone profile Flow Chart .
Plasma
Blood will be drawn into a K -EDTA blood collection tube at the time points indicated in the 
Flow Chart .
Serum
Blood will be drawn into a serum separation tube at the time points indicated in the Flow 
Chart .
All urine, plasma and serum samples remaining at the end of the study  will be destro yed no 
later than the sign -off of the separate biomarker report no more than two years after the last 
patient has completed the trial .
Detailed instructions for biomarker sampling, including handling and shipment of samples 
will be provided in the la boratory  manual in the ISF.
5.4.2 Pharmacogenomic biomarkers
Pharmacogenomics investigates genetic variations to explain and to predict an individual’s 
response to drugs. Therefore, a blood sample for pharmacogenomic testing will be taken from 
each participant .In case of unexplainable variability  in aldosterone level or of PK or PD 
parameters, DNA may  be extracted from these samples and used for exploratory  analy sis of 
variants of the aldosterone sy nthase gene and genes involved in Absorption, Distribution, 
Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) of drugs. It is not intended to include these data in the 
final report. However, the data may  be part of the report if necessary . All remaining samples 
will be discarded no later than 2 years after the last patient has complete d the trial .
Detailed instructions for pharmacogenomics sampling, including handling and shipment of 
samples will be provided in the laboratory  manual in the I SF.
5.4.2.1 Method of sample collection
One blood sample will be taken from an arm vein in a PAXgene blood DNA drawing tube at 
the time point indicated in the Flow Chart .

Genomic DNA will be extracted from blood samples according to standard molecular 
genetics methods and analy sed b y Drug Metaboli sm Enzy mes and Transporters (DMETTM) 
analysis or other standard genot yping technologies.
5.5 BIOBANKING
Participation in biobanking is voluntary and not a prerequisite for participation in the trial. 
Biobanking will only  occur after a separate biobanking informed consent has been given in 
accordance with local ethical and regulatory  requirements.
In some countries, for example China, biobanking samples willnot be collected due to 
regulatory  reasons.
5.5.1 Methods and timing of sam ple collection
Sampling will be performed at the time points specified in the Flow Chart .
Plasma banking: Blood will be drawn into a K -EDTA blood collection tube.
Serum banking: Blood will be drawn into a serum separation tub e.
Urine banking: Urine will be taken after tubes for exploratory  biomarkers (see section 5.4. 1) 
have been filled. The urine will be taken from the urine sample collected for safet y.
As no genetic testing is planned, no dedicated sample will be taken for the analysis of DNA 
and no DNA will be extracted from an y of the biobank ing s ample d described above .
For all biospecimens collected, detailed instructions on sampling, preparation, processing, 
shipment and storage are provided in the laboratory  manual. Samples will be stored at an 
external biobanking facility  contracted b y the sponsor.

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020The scheduled measurements are appropriate to assess drug induced changes in kidney  
function with regard sto alb uminuria (UACR), and safet ywise in vital signs, standard 
laboratory  values, and ECG. While UACR is widely accepted as a PD marker for efficacy  in 
kidney  trials, safet y lab, vital signs and ECG are standard to examine the safety of the 
investigational produ ct and to descriptively  identify  differences between different doses and 
placebo.
 
Therefore, the appropriateness of all measurements applied in this trial is given.
6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
All visits should be scheduled according to the Flow Chart . Each visit date in the Randomised 
Run-in Period (with its window) is to be c ounted from Day  -56 ( first randomisation) . All 
visits in the Treatment Period and Follow -up Period are to be counted from Day  1 (second 
randomisation) . If an y visit has to be rescheduled, subsequent visits should follow the 
original visit schedule. The tri al medication packs contain sufficient medication to allow for 
time windows.
All trial visits should be initiated preferentiall y in the morning. Patients should be instructed 
to not take their dose of the study  medication at home in the morning of schedule d visit day s 
as they  will be dosed whilst at the study  site.
Patients do not need to come fasted to study  visits, but their fasting status will have to be 
recorded in the CRF for  From the first  
the patient 
should only  drink water and eat no food unless it is medically  needed.
Unscheduled visits will be possible at the discretion of the investigator at any time in order to 
check the safet y of the patient or to provide trial medication e.g .following an interruption. 
If the reason for removal of a patient from treatment is an adverse event or a clinically  
significant laboratory  test result, the patient must be followed
-up until complete resolution or 
stabilisation of the event or until follow- up is agreed adequate b y the Investigator and 
sponsor.
In the event of force majeure or other disruptive circumstances (e.g. pandemic, war) the 
investigational plan as per this clinical trial protoc ol may  not be feasible at a site. With the 
consent of the patient, sponsor and investigator may agree on alternative, back -up or rescue 
methodology  which may  include but will not be limited to virtual (remote) patient visits and 
assessments, home healthcare nurse visits, and direct -to-patient shipments of trial treatment. 
Such alternative measures will be mentioned in the patient information leaflet. The 
implementation of these measures will depend on patient’s consent, operational feasibility ,

original plan will be precisely  documented.
6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS
Study  measurements and assessments should be performed according to the Flow Chart . All 
assessments should be performed before stud y drug administration , with the exception of the 
post-dose PK and aldosterone profile samples.
Where the following assessments occur at a visit they should be performed in the following 
order:
Vital signs 
ECG 
Blood draws including trough PK and plasma aldosterone –other PK and plasma aldosterone
samples are drawn after drug administration (see PK and aldosterone Flow Chart). Post dose -
serum cortisol at Visit 5 is also drawn after drug administration.
There will be h ome sampling without a visit at Week -4(‘Visit’ 3.1 during Randomised Run -
in), Weeks 12 and 13 (‘Visits’ 9.1 and 9.2 respectively , during the Treatment Period) , and at 
Weeks 16 and 17 (‘Visits’ FUp1.1 and FUp1.2 respectivel y, during the Follow -up Period
). 
The patient will be required to collect urine samples for UACR over two consecutive days 
according to the FMV and 24 -hour U rineSampling Flow Chart at these times.
In this stud y the following visits may be performed as Telemedicine Contacts and Home 
Visits if all local approvals are in place. These contacts are used to help support patients with 
protocol procedures and compliance (see section 6.2.1 and 6.2.2):
Telemedicine Contact: Visit 3 
Home Visit s: Visits 4, 6, 9, FUp2
All other visits must be performed at the Investigational Site. The only exception to this is in 
the event of force majeure or other disrupting circumstances where physical patient visits to 
the sites may  not be feasible or may  need to be restricted to ensure patient safet y. Based on a 
thorough assessment of the benefits and risks, the following vi sits may  be performed at the 
patient’s home orremotely , e.g. via telephone and/or internet- based means of 
communication:
Visit 2 (first randomisation) – may be performed as a home visit only
Visit 5 (second randomisation) –may be performed as a home visit only
Visits 7 and 8 (Treatment Period) – may be performed as a home and/or remote visit
EoT – may be performed as a home and/or remote visit
FUp1
–may be performed as a home and/or remote visit
Where Visit 2 and/or Visit 5 are conducted as a home vi sit, e ligibility  assessment and 
randomisation must be performed prior to the visit to allow time for the study  medication to 
be shipped to the patient’s home.
All deviations from the original schedule of visits and procedures will be documented and the 
implications considered for the anal ysis of the trial data.

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020If blood sampling for central lab at the trial site is not possible, safety  lab analy ses can be 
performed at a local lab. The results of the lab tests must be transferred to the investigator 
who e nsures medical review and proper documentation in the eCRF. Minimum required 
safet y lab parameters are listed in table 5.2.3: 2.Urine pregnancy  tests (for women of 
childbearing potential only , where required according to the Flow Chart ) may  be done at 
local lab / local doctor, or at home.   
In the event of elevated potassium > 5 mmol/L , if the patient is unable or unwilling to return 
to the investigational site , the BI 690517 or matching placebo should be temporarily  
interrupted until the patient can return to the investigational site.
If remote 
visits and/or lab assessments cannot be performed within the time window for the 
visit, or if patient safet y cannot be guaranteed, allrandomised study  medica tionneeds to be 
interrupted until the visit and lab assessments can be conducted .
6.2.1 Telemedicine Contacts
Telemedicine contacts may be via a straightforward phone call between the patient and an 
appropriatel y qualified member of the Investigational Site or via a video call . They should be 
performed as indicated in the Flow Chart but may  also be performed at any  time during the 
course of the trial to support patients with the home sampling and/ or following up on AEs or 
trial medication compliance. 
In the event of force majeure or other disrupting circumstances , where a patient is not able or 
willing to come to the site for a trial visit, t he following assessments can be done remotel y: 
collect and assess adverse events, concomitant therapies, assess trial medication compliance 
and review safet y laboratory  results.
6.2.2 Home Visits
Hom e visits (i.e. by  a nurse or phy sician) can be used to reduce the burden of participation on 
patients, and also to encourage participation following the COVID -19 or similar pandemic in 
case a patient is otherwise not able to travel to the site. They  may beperformed at the visits
indicated in the Flow Chart , unless the patient prefers to attend the Investigational Site for the 
visit.
To support visits performed at the patient’s home , direct shipment of the trial medication wi ll 
be managed b y the site directl y, for example via a courier, as permitted b y local regulations.
All unused trial medication from the previous visit(s), including empt y package material ,will 
be shipped from the patient’s home to the site via courier . If needed , the laboratory  kits and 
ancillary  materials required by  the nurse may  also 
be shipped to the patient prior to the visit.
Where country  regulations allow, samples taken at home will be shipped from the patient’s 
home to a central laboratory  for anal ysis. Where this is not possible alternative arrangements 
will be made, e.g. samples taken to the investigational site.

Investigator as to whether a telemedicine con tact is needed to support this assessment or even 
if the patient should attend the site.
Home visits may  be performed either b y an appropriately  qualified member of the 
Investigational Site team or by  a CRO working on behalf of the sponsor. Where a CRO is 
used all source information will be made available/ transferred to the Investigational Site and 
should be reviewed b y an investigator .
In the event of force majeure or other disrupting circumstances , where a patient is not able or 
willing to come to the s ite for a trial visit , the following assessments can be done at the 
patient’s home: collection of blood and urine samples to be sent to the central lab, vital signs, 
weight, collection and review of paper diaries, collection of adverse events and concomitant 
therapies, assessment of trial medication compliance.
6.2.3 Screening and run -in period(s)
Screening Period
No trial procedures should be done unless the patient has consented to taking part in the trial. 
Once informed consent is obtained, the patient is considered to be enrolled in the trial. The 
patient should be recorded on the enro llment log and be registered in the IRT sy stem as a 
screened patient before any  other activities are performed. The screening period begins once 
the first screening procedure has been performed . Patients who do not start the Randomised 
Run- in Period should be registered as a screen failure in the IRT s ystem. Patients who do not 
fulfil all eligibility
 criteria for a reason that later resolves and allows eligibility  criteria to be 
met, may  be re -screened. Re -screening will only  be allowed once.
The footnotes to the Flow Chart provide details about when screening procedures may  be 
repeated and when re -screening is allowed.
During the screening visit, demographics information will be collected. This includes:
age on the day  of informed consent (in y ears)
Sex (male, female in order to describe the participant `s sex at birth), 
For women: confirmation of childbearing potential in order to cha racteri se the patient 
population and as a basis for contraception requirements 
Ethnicity  and race in order to sufficientl y characteri se the patient population ,to 
support possible subgroup anal ysesif needed and to support the calculation of the 
kidney  function via the CKD EPI  formula, unless not acceptable according to local 
regulations.
Randomised Run -in Period
The Randomised Run- in Period is 8 weeks. At the start of this period, patients will be 
randomised to receive empagliflozin or matching placebo. All visit procedures should be 
completed as indicated in the Flow Chart .

The Treatment Period is 14 weeks. During this period, patients will receive one of three doses 
of BI 690517 or placebo, in combination with Empagliflozin or matching placebo assigned 
during the run- in period. All visit procedures should be completed as indicated in the Flow 
Chart .
6.2.5 Early discontinuation of Treatment
Patients who discontinue empagliflozin/placebo prematurel y during the Run -In Period and 
who do not withdraw their informed consent; and patients who discontinue both 
empagliflozin /placebo andBI 69 0517/placebo during the Treatment Period and who do not 
withdraw their informed consent, should return for an End of Treatment (EoT) visit.
If the patient prematurel y discontinues empagliflozin /placebo during the Run- In Period :
If the patient has stopped taking empagliflozin/placebo the day  of a scheduled visit or 
one day  prior, the scheduled visit should be performed as an EoT Visit. Empagliflozin 
PK and safet y samples should be collected. Biomarker , BI 690517 PK, aldosterone
and optional biobanking samples do not need to be collected .
If early  discontinuation does not coincide with a scheduled visit , the patient should 
return for an EOT visit.  PK, aldosterone , biomarker and optional biobanking samples 
do not need to be collecte d, but all safet y assessments must be performed as indicated 
in the Flow Chart .
The 24- hour urine sample prior to EOT does not need to be collected.
If the patient prematurel y discontinues empagliflozin/placebo andBI 690517/placebo during 
the Treatment Period :
If the patient has stopped taking trial drugs the day of a scheduled visit or one day  
prior, the scheduled visit should be performed as an EoT Visit. All samples including 
PK, aldosterone profile and all biom arkers should be collected in addition to safet y 
samples. 
If the earl y discontinuation does not coincide with a scheduled visit, the patient should 
return for an EoT Visit. PK , aldosterone ,biomarker and optional biobanking samples 
do not need to be colle cted, but all safet y assessments must be performed as indicated 
in the Flow Chart .
After the Eo Tvisit, all patients will start the off-treatment Follow -up Period (see section 
5.2.6 ).
6.2.6 Follow -upperiod and trialcompletion
The Follow -up Period is 4 weeks and consists of twovisits , FUp1 and FUp2, with two
intermediate home sampling timepoints. P lease see the Flow Chart for timelines and visit 
details.  No study medication is taken during the Follow -up Period.

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020The Residual Effect Period (REP) in this study  is 7 day s, therefore visit FUp1 should be 
performed no earlier than 7 day s after the End of Treatment Visit.
Other follow up visits and assessments should be scheduled relative to the EoT visit i.e., t here 
will be home sampling without visit at 2 weeks and 3 weeks after E oT,and FUp2 should be 4 
weeks after E oT.
Patients who prematurel y discontinue during the Run -In Period should have FUp1 as a 
minimum
. Patients randomised to the Treatment Period should be encouraged to complete all 
visits and procedures in the FUp period. If the patient does not wish to complete all visits or 
procedures, they  should have FUp1 as a minimum.
For patients who prem aturely  discontinue during the Run -In Period, aldosterone samples do 
not need to be taken at FUp1 or FUp2.
For patients who have not had  
collected at EOT, these samples do not need to be taken at FUp1 and/or FUp2.
Participation in this trial is concluded once FUp 2has been completed. Additional visits may  
be scheduled for continued safet y monitoring after the FUp2 visit i f needed in the opinion of 
the investigator. Abnormal assessments or lab values judged clinicall y relevant by the 
investigator will be monitored until they return to a medicall y acceptable level. 
7. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF
SAMPLE SIZE
In this stud y, the primary endpoint is the change from baseline in log transformed UACR 
measured in First Morning Void urine after 14weeks. The purpose of this trial is to 
demonstrate clinical activity  of BI 690517 and to determine the optimal dose for phase III. 
The methodology  for dose finding employ ing both multiple comparison procedures and 
modelling techniques (MCPMod) will be applied to the 
3 groups of patients with BI 690517 
and placebo
. In addition, MCPMod will be used to characterise the BI 690517 dose -response 
relationship separatel yin(1) patients on a background medication of placebo , and (2)on 
background medication of empagliflozin.
Dose effects will be assessed separatel y on each background ther apy because both 
empagliflozin and BI 690517 have a haemod ynamic effect which leads to an acute eGFR 
decrease. It will be important to assess the effects of both drugs alone, and in combination 
with a s taggered treatment initiation .

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 20207.1 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
For the primary  endpoint, t he null hy pothesis is that the dose -response curv e is flat across the 
3 BI 690517 doses and the placebo, whereas the alternative h ypothesis of a non- flat dose -
response curve indicates a clinical benefit of BI 690517 in at least one of the doses. The null 
hypothesis of a flat dose -response curve across the 3 BI 690517 doses and the placebo will be 
assessed in the following order: (1) in all patients (regardless of background therapy ), (2) in 
patients on a background medication of placebo, and (3) on background medication of 
empagliflozin .
The MCPMod procedure allows for simultaneous evaluation of different potential dose 
response patterns, while protecting the overall probability  of Ty pe I error (one -sided α of 5%, 
which corresponds to two- sided α of 10% ). The pre-specified models and their parameters 
used for this test will be outlined in section 7.2.3.
7.2 PLANNED ANALYSES
7.2.1 General considerations
The following anal ysis sets will be defined for statistical analy ses:
Entered Set (ES): This patient set includes all patients who signed informed consent. The ES 
will be used for the anal ysis of patient disposition.
Randomised Set (RS): This patient set includes all entered and randomised patients based on 
the treatment groups they were randomised to at the randomisation prior to the Treat ment 
Period, regardless of being treated b y BI 690517 or not. The RS will be used for the analy ses 
of protocol deviations as well as demographics and baseline characteristics.
Treated Set (TS): This patient set includes all patients who received at least one dose of BI 
690517 or matching placebo. The TS is based on actual treatment patients have received and 
will be used for safet y analyses.
Full Anal ysis Set (FAS): This patient set includes all randomised patients who had at least 
one baseline measuremen t of UACR at week 6, 7, or 8 and at least one post- baseline 
measurement. The FAS will be the main anal ysis set for the analy sis of efficacy .
The pharmacokinetic set (PKS): This patient set includes all patients in the TS who provided 
at least one PK parame ter that was not excluded because of protocol deviations relevant to 
the statistical evaluation of PK endpoints as defined in section 5.3.
Further anal ysis sets will be defined in the TSAP, if needed.

The expected intercurrent events of interest in this trial are restricted to the Treatment Period 
and are defined as:
Premature treatment discontinuation of BI 690517
Down -titration of BI 690517
Use of SGLT2i as concomitant medication 
Death
The strategies for handling intercurrent events in this trial are summarised in Table 7.2.2: 1 .
Table 7.2.2: 1 Summary  of strategies for handling intercurrent events
Estimand strategy  Treatment Intercurrent event handling

treatment-BI690517discontinuation:  include data prior to 
study  medication discontinuation
-Down -
titration of BI 690517: include data prior 
to down- titration
-
Death: include data prior to death
-Use of SGLT2i: include all available data

data
-Down -titration of BI 690517: include 
all available 
data 
- Death: include data prior to death
-Use of SGLT2i: include all available data
The primary  approach will include all data prior to the intercurrent event, so any  data 
collected after the intercurrent event will be excluded from the primary  analy sisexcept for 
the use of SGLT2i as concomitant medication . Patients will be analy sed acco rding to their 
randomised treatment. The anal ysis period for the primary  approach starts from 
randomisation to the Treatment Period until either intercurrent event or EoT at week 14, 
whichever comes first. This approach is analogous to a hy pothetical appro ach with respect to 
BI690517.
Supplementary  1 approach will include all data collected even after intercurrent event, except 
for death. Every  attempt will be made to follow up with patients who discontinue treatment 
prematurel y until the end of their plan ned stud y participation. Patients will be anal ysed 
according to their randomised treatment. The analy sis period for the supplementary  1 
approach starts from randomisation to 
the Treatment Period until EoT at week 14. This 
approach is anal ogous to the treat ment policy  appro ach.
Handling of intercurrent events that are not listed will be decided b y blinded review based on 
the general principle outlined and will be documented in the TSAP.

The primary  objectives are to demonstrate a non-flat dose response curve, quantify  the 
treatment effect, and evaluate the dose -response relationship. The primary  analy sis will be 
performed on the FAS.
For dose finding, multiple comparison procedures and modelling techniques (MCPMod) will 
be applied. The primary  estimand of interest is the treatment effect using the primary  
approach ( Table 7.2.2: 1 ). 
Treatment effect
The primary  anal ysis will first address a dose -response relationship between doses of BI 
690517 and place bo by  adopting a nMMRM in groups testing the treatment of BI 690517.
Reduction in log transformed UACR from baseline will be used as the response variable in 
the MMRM. 
This model will include fixed effect of treatment at each visit as categorical variabl e, and 
fixed effect of log transformed baseline UACR at each visit as continuous variable. Visit will 
be treated as repeated measure with an unstructured covariance structure for the within -
patient variability .

treatment period.
The estimates will be produced for each background the rapy separatel y, and for all patients 
combined. For the combined anal ysis, the individual estimates are weighted by  the number of 
patients randomi sed at the second randomi sation. To pe rform multiple comparison in the 
MCPMod across doses, predicted average response for each dose group and the standard 
errors from the MMRM will be used for the MCPMod anal ysis.The M

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020A non- flat dose -response relationship is established if for the primary  endpoint, the null 
hypothesis of no dose effect (i.e., a flat dose- response curve) is rejected for at least one of the 
pre-specified dose -response models with respect to the one- sided t ype I error at 5% after 
multiple comparisons adjustment. 
Dose finding
The second primary  objective is to determine the therapeutic dose. The trial will characterise 
the dose -response curve for BI 690517 by  assessing 3 doses and placebo. The response is the 
change from baseline in log transformed UACR measured in First Morning Void urine after 
14 weeks of treatment with BI690517 or matching placebo. Patients will be evaluated by  the 
dose group they  were assigned to at r andomisation for primary  anal ysis in the MCPMod 
analysis.
The anal yses for dose -finding will be performed using MCPMod whereb y several possible 
dose response models (patterns) will be evaluated to identify  the best -fitting model or subset 
of models (refer toFigure 7.5: 1). If efficacy is established, the statistically  significant (best 
fitting) model(s) from the candidate set will be refitted to the data to generate new estimates 
for all model parameters from the data. The final model will be obtained via model averaging 
across the significant models based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The target 
dose(s) can be estimated from that model by  incorporating information on the minimum 
clinically  relevant effect and accounting for safet y. Doses within the dose range investigated 
(0 to 20 mg, total dail y dose) will be considered.

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 20207.2.4 Secondary objective analyses
Descriptive statistics will be provided for the proportion of patients responding to UACR. An 
adjust ed multiple imputation method will be used formissing UACR meas urement s, after 
which the response variable s will be determined. As a sensitivity  anal ysis, patients missing 
Week 14 data will be imputed as non -responders.
All secondary  endpoints will be display edfor all patients and with each background 
medication separatel y.  
7.2.6 Safety analyses
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA). Standard BI summary  tables and listings will be produced. All adverse events 
with an onset between start of treatment and end of the REP, a period of 7 day s after the last 
dose of trial medication, will be assigned to the on-treatment period for evaluation.
All treated patients will be included in the safet y analysis based on their actual treatments. In 
general, safet y anal yses will be descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No 
hypothesis testing is planned.
Statistical analy sis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment -emergent 
adverse events, i.e. all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end of the 
REP. Adverse events that start before first drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will 
also be considered as ‘treatment- emergent’. Adverse events will be summari sed by  the 
treatment 
at which the subject was randomised, and the treatment at the onset of AE for the 
drug-related AE. 
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated b y system 
organ class and preferred term after coding according to the cur rent version of the Medical 
Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA).
Summary  of participants with down- titration due to AE will be provided separatel y. Adverse 
event of special interest (AESI) and other specific AEs with collection of additiona l 
information in the eCRF (which include hyperkalaemia) 
will be summarised as well. 
Analy sis of serum potassium will further include change from baseline, the incidence of 
serum potassium levels of 5.6 mmol/L  or higher and higher than 6.0 mmol/L.

be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be summarised . Treatment 
groups will be compared descriptivel y with regard to distribution parameters as well as with 
regard to frequency  and percentage of patients with abnormal values or clinically  relevant 
abnormal values.
Vital signs, ph ysical examinations, or other safet y-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the course of the trial and at the end -of-trial evaluation will be assessed with 
regard to possible changes compared to findings before start of treatment.
Further details will be provided in the TSAP.
7.2.7 Other Analyses
Deta ils on the further analy ses will be described in TSAP if needed.
7.2.8 Interim Analyses
No interim anal ysis is planned but a Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC)will be in place 
with tasks as described in section 8.7.
7.3 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA
In the primary  anal ysis of continuous endpoints, missing data will not be imputed. As a 
sensitivity  anal ysis, missing UACR data will be imputed using an adjusted multiple 
imputation model (refer to Section 7.2.3.1).   Data from this multiple imputation will be used 
to compute responder endpoints.
Missing or incomplete AE dates will be imputed according to BI standards. Handling of 
missing data for secondary  endpoints as well as for sensitivity  anal ysis will be described in 
the TSAP.
Handling of missing PK data will be performed according to the relevant internal procedures. 
PK parameters that cannot be reasonabl ycalculated based on the available drug 
concentration -time data will no t be imputed.
7.4 RANDOMISATION
BI will arrange for the creation of the randomi sation scheme and the packaging and labelling 
of trial medication. Patients will be randomised to double -blind treatment. Approximately  
equal numbers of patients will be randomised to each treatment group. The randomis ation list 
will be generated using a validated sy stem, which involves a pseudo -random number 
generator so that the resulting randomisation scheme will be both reproducible and non -

codes will be controlled and documented.
In this stud y, patients will undergo a 2 -step randomisation, with the first randomisation 
performed prior to the Randomised Run -inandthe second randomisation performed prior to 
the Treatment Period. Patients must fulfil the criteria (as described in section 3.3.2 ) in order 
to be randomised into the Treatment Period.  In order to ensure a balance of patients between 
treatment groups, the trial will use stratified randomisation according to prognostic variables
eGFR (< 45 and ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2), UACR (≤ 750 and >750 mg/g) .At the first step, 
patients will be randomis ed to the treatment of empagliflozin or matching placebo in a 1:1 
ratio for 8 weeks. At the second step, patients will be randomised to the Treatment Period in a 
1:1:1:1 ratio for the treatment of 3 doses of BI 690517 ( 3 mg QD, 10 mg QD, and 20 mg QD) 
and matching placebo for 14 weeks, on the top of empagliflozin or match ing placebo from 
the first randomisation. 
7.5 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE
The sample size calculation is conducted assuming effect size of BI 690517 versus placebo, 
(0, 0.10, 0.20, 0.35) for (placebo, BI 690517 3 mg, BI 690517 10 mg, BI 690517 20mg total 
daily  dose) in log transformed UACR measured in morning void urine after 14 weeks of trial 
treatment from baseline. The pre -specified models in Figure 7.5: 1 are used for testing null 
hypothesis. The following models have been selected as the candidate set of possible dose 
response patterns based on current expectation. Assuming the following dose groups will be 
tested: placebo, active BI 690517 3 mg, 10 mg, a nd 20 mg in terms of total daily  dose.
Emax: 80% of the maximum effect is achieved at 10 mg.
Exponential: 15% of the maximum effect is achieved at 10 mg.
Linear: No assumption is needed.

trialand the investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of any  
diagnostic tests. In this case ,the investigator must make at least one documented attempt to 
retrieve previous medical records. If this fails ,a verbal history  from the patient, documented 
in their medical records, would be acceptable.
If the patient is not compliant with the protocol , any  corrective action e.g. re -training must be 
documented in the patient file.
For theCRF, data must be derived from source documents, for example:
Patient identification : sex, yearof birth (in accordance with local laws and regulations
)
Patient participation in the trial(substance, trialnumber, patient number, date patient was 
informed)
Dates of patient ’s visits, including dispensing of trialmedication
Medical history  (including trialindication and concomitant diseases, if applicable)
Medication history
Adverse e vents and outcome events (onset date (mandatory ), and end date (if available))
Serious adverse events (onset date (mandatory ), and end date (if available))

documented medical evaluation (in validated electronic format, if available)
Completion of patient’s p articipation in the trial”(end date; in case of premature 
discontinuation document the reason for it).
Prior to allocat ion of a 
patient to a treatment into a clinical trial, there must be 
documented evidence in the source data (e.g. medical records) that the trialparticipant 
meets all inclusion criteria and does not meet an y exclusion criteria. The absence of 
records (either medical records , verbal documented feedback of the patient or testing 
conducted specific for a protocol) to support inclusion / exclusion criteria does not make 
the patient eligible for the clinical trial.
ECG results ( origi nal and copies of printouts)
Source documentation for telemedicine visits
Source documentation for visits performed at the patient’s home
Historical kidney -related data
8.3.2 Direct access to source data and documents

Section to be changed Flow Chart, FMV and 24 -hour Urine Sampling Flow Chart, 
3.1
Description of change Extended the maximum screening time window to first 
randomisation from 14 to 21 day s throughout the protocol.
Rationale for change More time is needed to allow screening procedures to be 
repeated where permitted and will give sufficient buffer for 
IMP to be delivered to the site.

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020Description of change Addition of serum cortisol sample at Visit 1, pre and post 
dose Visit 5, Visit 6, Visit 7, Visit 8, Visit 9, EoT, FUp1 and 
FUp2.
Addition of ACTH Challenge Test (if required) at Visit 5, 
Visit 6, Visit 7, Visit 8, Visit 9 and EoT.
Addition of 24- hour urine samples at Visit 5 and E oT.
Added ‘and 24 -hour urine ’ to‘Train the patient on FMV 
sampling’ .
Addition of ‘Dispense urine container for 24 -hour sampling’ 
at 
Visits 4 and 9.
Footnote 1: ACTH Challenge Test added as an example of a 
reason for additional visit.
Footnote 10 : Clarification of when ACTH Challenge Test is 
required added . 
Footnote 14: added that lab samples for serum cortisol must 
be collected before 10am.
Footnote 15: added the timing of the post -dose serum 
cortisol sample relative to drug administration.
Footnote 22 (previously  #20): Added requirement to collect 
start and stop times for 24 -hour urine on paper diary .
Rationale for change Serum cortisol samples added to detect and mitigate the 
potential risk of adrenal insufficiency .  
ACTH Challenge Test added (if required based on cortisol 
levels ) to investigate potential adrenal insufficiency during 
the study .
24-hour urine samples collected to measure urinary  free 
cortisol to determine whether BI 690517 may increase 
cortisol levels (Cushing’s 
syndrome) . 24-hour u rine 
collection times need to be recorded b y the patient on a 
paper diary .
Section to be changed Flowchart
Description of change Footnote 19 (previously  #17): added “ More frequent 
pregnancy testing should be done if required by  local 
regulation and /or authority  or per investigator judgment.”

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020Rationale for change In some countries pregnancy testing is required more 
frequentl y.
Section to be changed Flowchart
Description of change The text in footnote 20 (previously  #18) about pre -screening 
for UACR has been moved to footnote 2.  In addition, eGFR 
has been added as a test that patients can be pre -screened for 
if consent is given.
Rationale for change The text about eGFR has been added as this is not alway s 
done regularly , and patients could potentially  fail screening 
for this.  Allowing pre -screening for eGFR means fewer
unnecessary  screening procedures for patients who would 
not be eligible due to eGF R.
The UACR pre -screening text has been moved as it is more 
appropriate to have all screening text together.
Section to be changed Flowchart
Description of change Addition of “post -dose” in the split column header of Visit 
5. 
Removal of plasma aldosterone sample at Visit 2, paper 
diary  handout at Visit EoT and FUp1 and collection / review 
of paper diary  at Visit FUp 1 and FUp2.
Footnote 4: add ed‘all trial’ to the sentence ‘In case a patient 
needs or wishes to terminate [all trial] treatment 
prematurel y…’
Footnote 3: added eGFR to potassium as another safet y 
parameter that must be repeated in case of an unexpected 
delay  of Visit 5.
Footnote 10: In the following sentence 'in the patient’s 
medical record' was added: The time for the post ACTH -
injection blood samples must be recorded in the patient’s 
medical record.
Rationale for change Clarifications and corrections to ensure consistency with 
other sections of the protocol.   
eGFR and potassium are both critical parameter s for start of 
treatment with BI 690517. 
There will be no requirement to record the time of post 
ACTH- injection blood samples taken in the clinical 
database, as there is no analy sis done with it. Instead 
adherence to the protocol is going to be monitored b y 
reviewing the medical records at the site.

Rationale for change Correction
Section to be changed 3.1 Overall Trial Design
Description of change Removal of diabetes as a prognostic variable for 
stratification.
Rationale for change This was erroneously  left in the original protocol by  mistake.  
A third stratification factor would result in too small strata 
and was therefore not further pursued. Instead for the 
purpose of classify ing diabetic status patients with diabetes 
will be classed as having diabetic kidney  disease
Section to be changed 3.1 Overall Trial Design
Description of change The following sentence:
‘To decrease the burden on patients, where country 
regulations allow, samples taken at home between visits will 
be shipped from the patient’s home to a central laboratory

Section to be changed 3.1 Overall Trial Design
Description of change 24-hour urine samples added at Visit 5 and EOT
Rationale for change 24-hour urine samples will be collected to measure urinary  
free cortisol to determine whether BI 690517 may  increase 
cortisol levels.
Section to be changed 3.2 Discussion of Trial Design
Description of change Measures to detect and mitigate the potential risk of adrenal 
insufficiency  and Cushing’s syndrome added.
Rationale for change BI 690517 has the potential to affect cortisol levels so these 
measures are required to mitigate an y risks.
Section to be changed 3.3.2 I nclusion criteria and Clinical Trial P rotocol S ynopsis
Description of change Added ‘of legal adult age (according to local legislation)’ to 
inclusion criterion 2.
Rationale for change Clarification that patients must be the legal age of consent as 
well as 18 or over to enter the trial
Section to be changed 3.3.2 I nclusion criteria
Description of change Re-numbering of additional I nclusion criteria assessed prior 
to second randomisation from 1. and 2. to 13. and 14.
Rationale for change To enable all inclusion criteria to be distinct in trial sy stems.
Section to be changed 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria
Description of change Added “ Patients who must or wish to continue the intake of 
restricted medications (see section 4.2.2.1 )or any  drug 
considered likel y to interfere with the safe conduct of the 
trial are also excluded.” to exclusion criterion #2

001-MCS -40-106_RD -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020Description of change Addition of exclusion criterion number 6: Treatment with 
biotin (Vitamin B7, Vitamin H, or coenzyme R) at daily  
doses ≥ 5 mg (including food supplements) within 72 hours 
of Visit 1 or planned during the trial.  
Rationale for change Intake of higher biotin doses has an influence on certain lab 
results and may  display  false results, e.g. for serum 
pregnancy  tests and some hormone tests.
Section to be c hanged 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria
Description of change For exclusion criterion 7 (previousl y #6) , instead of an 
increase in serum cortisol of 200 nmol/L  at 30 minutes post -
injection, an absolute cortisol value of < 18 µg/dL (496.6
nmol/L )will be used as the diagnostic threshold for adrenal 
insufficiency .
Rationale for change ACTH Challenge test to be performed in accordance with 
the Cosy ntropin label and current U.S. guidelines, where the
threshold for exclusion of adrenal insufficiency  should be an
absolute cortisol value of >18 µg/dL 30 minutes post -
injection.
Both c onventional and SI units are specified to align with 
central laboratory  reporting .
Section to be changed 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria
Description of change For exclusion criterion 10 (previousl y #9), ‘Serum cortisol < 
5µg/dL (138.0 nmol/L )’ added to ‘An y clinical significant 
laboratory  abnormality ’.
Rationale for change Patients with serum cortisol < 5 µg/dL are at greater risk of 
adrenal insufficiency
 and should not be included in the trial.
Section to be changed 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria
Description of change For exclusion criterion 16 (previousl y #15) , ‘at the time of 
screening’ added to ‘Any documented active or suspected 
malignancy ’and ‘confirmed’ added to ‘ history  of confirmed 
malignancy  within two years prior to Visit 1.’
Rationale for change To clarify  that the suspected malignancy  is at the time of 
screening and not within two y ears prior to Visit 1 , and that 
any history  of malignancy  is confirmed.
Section to be changed 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria and 4.2.2.1 Restrictions 
Description of change For exclusion criterion 21 (previousl y #20), removal of ‘for 
an oral agent which is not specified in any  other exclusion 
criteria, or less that 12 months prior to Visit 1 since ending 
another investigational device or drug trial(s) for a biological 
agent which is not specified in exclusion criteria or

1’ also removed from Concomitant medication Restrictions 
table 4.2.2.1: 1.
Rationale for change It is not necessary  to exclude patients who were on a trial for 
a biological agent more than 30 day s, up to 12 months, prior 
to Visit 1.
Section to be changed 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria
Description of change Footnote 4 Definition of AKI according to KDIGO changed 
from 
‘Increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times, which is known 
or presumed to have occurred within the prior 7 day s’ to 
‘Increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times baseline, which 
is known or presumed to have occurred within the prior 7 
days’
Rationale for change The word ‘baseline’ was omitted in error
Section to be changed 3.3.4.1 Discontinuation of trial treatment
Description of change An individual patient will permanentl y discontinue all 
randomised trial treatment if:
1.The patient develops Acute Kidney  Injury  as per 
clinical judgement by  the investigator and/or 
according to t he Kidney  Disease: Improving Global 
Outcomes (KDIGO) definition [ R17-2439] (see 
section 3.3.3 ).
was changed to:
The patient develops Acute Kidney  Injury  as per 
clinical judgement by  the investigator . The Kidney 
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 
definition [ R17-2439 ] (see section 3.3.3 )should be 
used for guidance .
Rationale for change The definition of AK I according to KDIGO cannot alway s 
be applied in an outpatient setting, therefore AKI should be 
primarily  judged b y the investigator based on clinical 
presentation, and KDIGO can be used for guidance.
Section to be changed 3.3.4.1 Discontinuation of trial treatment
Description of change Added patients who develop Cushing’s sy ndrome, adrenal 
insufficiency  (including cortisol level <18 µg/dL 30 min (±5 
min) after ACTH application) , or cortisol levels < 3 µg/dL 
(
82.8 nmol/L ) at any  point in the trial should be withdrawn 
permanentl y from BI 690517 / placebo.
Added requirement to permanently  discontinue patients who 
permanentl y discontinue empagliflozin/placebo during the 
randomised run -in period.

home.’
Rationale for change IMP shipments to the patient’s home are required to allow 
for home health care visits as permitted by  the Flow Chart.
Section to be changed 4.2.1.1 Management of serum potassium elevation
Description of change Added ‘episode of’ to the following sentence:
For an y episode of increased potassium level above 5.0 
mmol/L , a clinical evaluation should be performed to make

episode of h yperkalemia and may  appl y more than once per 
patient.
Section to be changed 4.2.1.2 Management of eGFR decrease
Description of change New section
Rationale for change Further eGFR monitoring is required after the start of the 
double -blinded treatment with BI 690517 / placebo, if the 
eGFR decreases b y >15% since the last visit. The decision 
about continuing or discontinuation of the study  drug should 
be based on the crit eria specified in section 3.3.4.1 and the 
overall assessment of the patient’s status. 
Section to be changed 4.2.1.3 Management of serum cortisol d ecrease
Description of change New section added
Rationale for change If a patient’s serum cortisol level is ≥ 3 µg/dL  (82.8 nmol/L) 
and < 11 µg/dL ( 303.5 nmol /L),an ACTH test should be 
performed. If cortisol levels are < 3 µg/dL (82.8 nmol/L) 
patient should be withdrawn. This is to detect and mitigate 
the potential risk of ad renal insufficiency .

In the Investigator’s opinion, one or more of the following 
underly ing kidney  disease causes:
Diabetic kidney  disease. These patients must have ty pe 
2 diabetes mellitus and their treatment (including GL P1 
receptor agonist) should be unchanged or changes 
deemed minor (according to investigator’s judgement) 
within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 and until f irst 
randomisation. 
Hypertensive kidney  disease
Chronic glomerulonephritis defined as one of the 
following:
oIgA nephropathy, 
oMembranous nephropathy
oFocal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)
to:
In the Investigator’s opinion, any  kind of diagnosed chronic 
kidney  disease5.Patients with diabetic kidney  disease must 
have t ype 2 diabetes mellitus and their treatment (including 
GLP1 receptor agonist) should be unchanged or changes 
deemed minor (according to investigator’s judgement) 
within 4 weeks prio r to Visit 1 and until first randomisation. 
5Diagnosis can be reached by standard clinical method, no 
biopsy  required.
Rationale for change Broaden criteria to allow enrolment of patients with other 
non-diabetic kidney  diseases
Section to be changed 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria
Description of change Additional exclusion criterion: ‘Patients with known hepatic 
cirrhosis (Child Pugh A, B or C), or other liver disease 
causing impaired liver function according to investigator’s 
judgement.’ to be reviewed a t screening (exclusion #24) and 
also prior to the second randomisation (exclusion # 2 6).
Rationale for change  
No dedicated trial in patients with liver 
impairment has been done. Expe rience from other 
compounds metabolised mainly  by UGT2B7 enz ymes show 
that in patients with cirrhosis and liver impairment the 
exposure may  increase up to 4 -fold, therefore these patients 
should be excluded. T hese patients were to be excluded by  
exclusion criteria 10 (abnormal laboratory  value) but is 
clarified with this additional criteria.

a substantial suppression of aldosterone, and it is expected 
that the lower 20 mg dose will result in l essaldosterone 
suppre ssion,reducing the risk of hyperkalaemia .’
Rationale for change Clarification that the 40 mg dose causes substantial 
suppression of aldosterone instead of total suppression and 
that 20 mg dose causes less aldosterone suppression.

specialized in nephrology ) involved in this study , observed 
actual distribution of diabetic kidney  disease vs. non- diabetic 
kidney  disease is approximately  70% vs. 30%. Therefore,
the trial is unlikely  to reach 40% of non- diabetic kid ney 
disease patients within the required recruitment time, and 
reducing the minimum required from 40% to 30% will not 
affect study  primary  objectives or main outcomes since the 
study outcomes are combined for both disease t ypes.
Section to be changed 3.3 Selection of Trial Population
Description of change If a patient has been randomised in error (did not meet all 
inclusion criteria or met one or more exclusion criteria), the 
sponsor or delegate should be contacted immediately . Based 
on an individual benefit -risk assessment a decision will be 
made whether continued trial participation is possible or not.
Was changed to:
The investigator will make every  effort to avoid the 
inclusion of a patient who does not meet all the inclusion 
criteria and/or meet s at least one exclusion criterion. Should 
such an error nevertheless occur, this patient might be 
immediately  excluded from the clinical trial based on 
individual benefit- risk assessment by  the investigator. The 
sponsor or delegate will be informed as soo n as possible.
Rationale for change It should be the investigator who determines the benefit -risk 
assessment in case a patient is randomised in error, and not 
the sponsor.

Description of change ‘Systemic’ and ‘or before first randomisa tion’ was added to 
exclusion criteria #11: ‘Any  systemic immunosuppression 
therap y or immunotherapy in the last 3 months prior to 
Visit 1 or before first randomisation. This also applies to 
systemic steroids except oral prednisolone 
≤10 mg or 
equivalent.’
Rationale for change To allow local immunotherap y (e.g., cyclosporine eye drops) 
which does not have impact on study  endpoints; and 
clarification that sy stemic immunosuppression or 
immunotherapy  is not allowed bef ore first randomisation.
Section to be changed 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria
Description of change The following was added to exclusion criterion # 19: 
‘Patients who are unable to comply  with trial procedures’
Rationale for change Clarification to exclude patients who are unable to comply  
with trial procedures
Section to be changed 3.3.4.1 Discontinuation of trial treatment
Description of change Footnote #1 (associated with eGFR drop) added: ‘ Where the 
eGFR drop occurs before the start of BI 690517 / placebo in 
the Treatment Period (i.e., at Visit 5), but the result is not 
available until after the patient starts BI 690517/placebo 
treatment, the patient must still permanently  discontinue all 
randomised study  treatment, including BI 690517 / pl acebo.’
Rationale for change Clarification
Section to be changed 3.3.4.1 Discontinuation of trial treatment
Description of change ‘and should continue with scheduled study  visits.’ has been 
added to the sentence ‘ If one of the stud y medications (either 
empagliflozin/placebo or BI 690517/placebo) is permanentl y 
discontinued during the Treatment Period / after the second 
randomisation at Visit 5, the patient may  continue to receive 
treatment with the other study  medication ’.
Rationale for change Clarification
Section to be changed 4.1.5.1 Blinding
Description of change ‘Patients, investigators and every one involved in trial 
conduct or analy sis or with any  other interest except the 
Trial Pharmacometrician, PK programmer and Trial 
Bioanal yst in this double -blind trial will remain blinded with 
regard to the randomised treatment assignments until the 
database is declared ready  for anal ysis according to the 
sponsor’s SOPs. ’

Visit Primary  Endpoint (LPLVPE), with the exception of the 
Trial Pharmacometrician, PK programmer and Trial 
Bioanal yst.This snapshot will be taken after the last patient

snapshot, patients and investigators will continue to be 
blinded and will remain so until after database lock when the 
database is declared ready  for final analy sis according to the 
sponsor’s SOPs .’
‘Bioanaly tics will not disclose the randomisation code or the 
results of their measurements until the database lock
.’

results of their measurements prior 
to the L PLVPE 
snapshot .’
‘It should be noted no PK/PD results will be communicated 
to the project and trial team prior to database lock.’
Was changed to:
‘It should be noted no PK/PD results will be communicated 
to the project and trial team prior to the LPLVPE snapshot .’
Rationale for change To allow an earlier start of anal ysis, data will be unblinded 
after the last EoT visit instead of database lock
Section to be changed 4.1.6 Packaging, labelling, and re- suppl y
Description of change ‘(or equivalent)’ added to ‘Sy nacthen®(or equivalent) is 
either provided b y the site or where this is necessary  through 
the sponsor.’
Rationale for change Clarification
Section to be changed 4.2.1.3 Management of serum cortisol decrease
Description of change ‘from BI 690517 / placebo added to the sentence, ‘If, during 
the trial, cortisol level is < 3 µg/dL ( 82.8 nmol/L) the patient 
must be withdrawn from BI 690517 / placebo.’

  This change will not compromise the 
integrit y of the trial or introduce bias.
Section to be changed 4.2.2.1 Concomitant medication restrictions
Description of change For  ‘or 
deemed minor in the opinion of the investigator ’ added to 
the sentence ‘Stable dose permitted if used prior to entry , 
change should be avoided’ in the columns ‘During run -in 
and Treatment Period’ and ‘In the Follow -up Period’ and ‘in 
the opinion of the investiga tor’ added in the columns ‘Prior 
to trial (Visit 1)’ and ‘During screening (prior to first

Section to be changed 5.2.3 Safet y Laboratory  Parameters
Description of change Sentence added: Ineligible lab parameters may  only  be re -
tested once during the screening period.’
Rationale for change Clarification that screening procedures should not repeatedly  
be retested until an eligible result is obtained.
Section to be changed 5.2.5.1 ACTH Challenge test
Description of change Paragraph added: Alternative conduct of the ACTH test is 
allowed only if it is in accordance with the local practice of 
diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency . If adrenal insufficiency  is 
diagnosed with an alternative conduct of ACTH test, the 
details of the ACTH test should be documented in the AESI 
report to the sponsor.
Rationale for change Clarification that alternative methods of diagnosing adrenal 
insufficiency  are accepted if it is in accordance with local 
practice since some countries do not use the S hort Sy nacthen 
test as standard.

Section to be changed 5.2.6.1.4 Adverse events of special interest
Description of change Clarification that lab findings constituting a hepatic injury  
only need to be followed up according to the DILI checklist 
after the start of stud y treatment.
Rationale for change Clarification
Section to be changed 5.5 Biobanking
Description of change Paragraph added: ‘In some countries, for example China, 
biobanking samples will not be collected due to regulatory  
reasons.’
Rationale for change Correction.  This should have been added in Amendment 1 
(see Appendix 11.1) but was missed from the section in 
error. Since Amendment 1, other countries will not be 
collecting biobanking samples so the sentence h as been 
updated.
Section to be changed 6.2.3 Screening and run- in period(s)
Description of change ‘after discussion with the sponsor’ removed from the 
sentence ‘ Patients who do not fulfil all eligibility  criteria for 
a reason that later resolves and allows eligibility  criteria to 
be met, may  be re -screened after discussion with the

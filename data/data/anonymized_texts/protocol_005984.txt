7 1. Introduction 
1.1 Background 
The treatment approaches for myeloma have  undergone dramatic transformation 
over the past decade with the introduction  of several new classes of effective 
drugs, often used in combination to  achieve the maximum response. Prior 
treatment approaches in transplant- eligible patients consisted of a defined 
duration of induction therapy with a doublet followed by a single stem cell 
transplant (SCT) and observ ation, yielding a median of 2-3 years of myeloma 
disease control. The current approach ty pically includes an  induction therapy 
utilizing a triplet combination that in cludes a proteasome inhibitor and an 
immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), followed by a single SCT and post-transplant maintenance with or without a brief consolidation phase.
1-3 This change in 
strategy has led to a near doubling of the progression free survival (PFS) in this 
patient group. Sequential approaches as well as newer drug combinations also 
have led to unprecedented depth of res ponse in myeloma, with a substantial 
majority of patients achieving a complete  response (CR) or better to therapy. 
However, patients continue to relapse de spite reaching a CR, reflecting the 
inadequacy of this measurement in dete cting a substantial burden of residual 
tumor cells. As a result, it became ap parent that newer, more sensitive 
approaches to tumor burden assessment are needed and this led to the development of flow cytometry or Next-Generation Sequencing based 
approaches, which can detect tumor bu rden to a sensitivity of 1 in 10
5 to 106 
cells. 
New International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria : Given 
the impact of minimal residual diseas e (MRD) results on the outcomes in 
myeloma and more importantly, the relati ve lack of sensitivity of conventional 
electrophoretic methods of protein meas urement, the IMWG recently updated the 
response criteria to inclu de MRD assessment (Table 1).4 The revised criteria, 
including either one of the two most prevalent methods as equally acceptable, 
instead focuses on the level of tumor burden that defines MRD negativity. While 
there is early data showing that 10-6 provides a better outcome compared with 10-
5, the latter was selected for the definiti on given the importance of having access 
to techniques that can be used ev erywhere. The revised criteria also 
incorporated imaging, given that dis ease can be present outside the marrow 
space and this can have an impact on the outcomes as shown by the French trial 
(IFM2009), where both PET negativity and marrow MRD negativity at 10-5 had a 
better outcome than either being positi ve. Finally, the concept of sustained MRD 
as an additional measure of response stabil ity has been introduced as part of the 
MRD criteria.

survival than MRD+ cases (35 v 110 
months; P <0.005).  
In addition, a recent meta-analysis of  several studies highlights the impact of 
MRD negativity on PFS and overall surv ival (OS), both in all patients as well as in 
those patients in a conventional CR.18 In this analysis of published literature 
(1990-2016), 14 studies (n  = 1273) provided data on the impact of MRD on PFS, 
and 12 studies (n  = 1100) provided data on the impact of MRD on OS. Results 
were reported specifically in patient s who had achieved conventional CR in 5 
studies for PFS (n  = 574) and 6 studies for OS (n  = 616). Achievement of MRD-
negative status following treatment was associated with a significant 
improvement in progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.36-0.48; N = 1273). Overall survival was also significantly prolonged in MRD-
negative patients (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.46-0.71; N  = 1100). In looking specifically 
at CR patients, there was improvement in  PFS (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.34-0.56; 
P < .001) as well as OS (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.33-0.67; P  < .001). 
All these studies clearly show the progno stic value of achieving MRD negativity 
with the current therapies. Based on this  prognostic potential, the FDA has 
recently approved the next-generation sequ encing (NGS) assay to detect MRD, 
in patients with multiple myeloma (M M). However, it remains unclear if MRD 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
11 should be the target of therapy and if th erapeutic decisions c an be based on the 
MRD status of individual patients. The co ntinuing improvements in therapy and 
consequent deep respons es has led to an urgency in defining the role of MRD in 
myeloma. 
1.2 Rationale for the Trial 
The mainstream adoption of MRD represen ts years of work demonstrating the 
clinical relevance of achieving an MRD state after any given therapy. The 
available data demonstrate the prognostic value of this response state and its 
potential for a regulatory endpoint given the long period of time required to reach 
median progression and overall survival with the new therapies used in MM. So, 
two important questions with respect to  MRD in MM have been answered: First, 
for a given patient achieving MRD negative status with therapy will translate to better outcomes and can be used for prognost ication. Second, and for a group of 
patients, a higher proportion of patients achieving MRD will translate to better 
survival thus allowing for co mparisons of different types of therapy, lending itself 
to be a valid regulatory endpoint. The most  significant question for the patient 
and the physician in the clinic, however, is to determine what to do with the MRD 
result for a given patient, as the achieve ment of MRD is a composite outcome of 
the therapy employed and the disease biology for a given patient. Our goal is to 
prove that if a patient is MRD positive, c hanging therapy to convert this patient to 
MRD negative status will translate to a be tter outcome for the given patient, thus 
taking biology out of the equation. Th is requires carefully designed phase III 
trials, as is the case with the current tria l design. The current trial will be able to 
ask critical questions as to whether acti ng on the MRD status will improve the 
depth of response, prolong disease control and most importantly overall survival 
for a given patient. 
Also, this trial design will give us a uniqu e opportunity to study the kinetics of 
relapse from MRD in patients with MM. Th is information is crucial as we make 
progress in the field. Once we achieve a high proportion of MRD negative state 
with the improved therapies, the question wh ich will need to be addressed is the 
timing of retreatment for disease recurrence: whether this should be started at the reemergence of MRD positivity or at the time of biochemical relapse? This 
study by virtue of the design and serial MRD as sessment and imaging 
assessment will provide the necessary information that will drive the design of 
future studies. It is possible that early inter vention in these patients, at the time of 
MRD conversion, may have a better long-t erm impact, akin to the hypothesis 
currently being studied in smold ering multiple myeloma (SMM). 
The fundamental question that this trial is designed to address can be stated very 
clearly - Does esca lating therapy based on the MRD positive status after a 
defined duration of therapy alter the outcomes in patients with myeloma? This is 
the most important question we face in this disease today.4,19 If the MRD is 
negative, do we stop therapy? If the MRD is positive, do we escalate therapy? The former question is going to be addressed through a clinical trial of daratumumab and lenalidomide vs. lenalido mide maintenance that is being 
planned through the cooperative groups. The study that we propose will 
complement this trial and help answer t he second question. In order to answer 
this question with certainty, we requir e a homogenous group of patients who 
have received similar treatments, in who m we can test the MRD status using a 
well-defined method, and who can then be ra ndomized to either continue with the 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
12 same treatment or alter the treatmen t approach. The control arm treatment 
should be considered the standard of ca re (SOC) in the population being studied. 
Among patients with myeloma who are eligible  to undergo autologous peripheral 
blood stem cell transplant, the current SO C is to initiate therapy with a triplet 
combination (typically an IMiD and a proteasome inhibitor containing 
combination) and continue for three to fo ur cycles, followed by autologous SCT 
and lenalidomide maintenance, typically  continued until progression.1-3,20,21 
Lenalidomide maintenance as SOC:  Maintenance approaches have become 
SOC in myeloma, both in the transplant  and non-transplant setting. While the 
maintenance approach in the non-transplan t setting remains less well defined, 
multiple phase III trials as well as a meta- analysis of the three largest trials have 
clearly shown OS and PFS improvement wit h lenalidomide maintenance post-
autologous stem cell transplant.1-3,20,21 Lenalidomide was recently approved by 
FDA for use in the maintenance setting based on these data. 
Unanswered question regarding duration of maintenance:  However, 
significant confusion remains in terms of th e ideal duration of maintenance in this 
setting. The original French trial limited the duration to 2 years due to concerns 
about second primary malignancies. The US trial continued until progression – 
this is one of the reasons often quoted for the difference in the survival 
outcomes. An ongoing clinical tria l (E1A11, ENDURANCE) is asking this 
question in the non-transplant setti ng. Understanding the impact of MRD 
negativity on the outcomes and how t hat interacts with the duration of 
maintenance will be critical to impr ove our understanding of this question. 
Assessing for MRD status at the end of 1 year of maintenance and randomizing 
the patients to either continuing the current therapy or intensifying the therapy by 
adding another drug class to lenalidomide will pr ovide a clean design to answer 
this clinically important question.  
We elected to utilize next generation flow cytometry (NGF) using the Euroflow 
approach for MRD assessment.4,22 The main reason for selecting this approach, 
instead of an NGS based approach for this  trial, is the ability to interpret the 
assay without having a baseline specimen, which we believe will be difficult given 
that the patient is enrolled on trial at around the end of 12-18 months of therapy (induction, SCT and 6-12 months of ma intenance) and marrow will have small 
numbers of plasma cells. 
The proposed design has several unique strengths. The natural history of 
patients receiving lenalidomide maintenance for one year or indefinitely is well 
known based on several large clinical tria ls. The expected MRD status at the end 
of one year of maintenance has been defined recently in a large French randomized trial of VRD induction followed by transplant and one year of lenalidomide maintenance, where MRD assessment was systematically 
undertaken in a majority of patients. The control arm of  indefinite lenalidomide 
maintenance is fully supported by the avai lable data from phase III trials as well 
as a recent meta-analysi s of the phase III trials whi ch demonstrated an overall 
survival outcome improvement with the maintenance approach compared with observation. A similar study in the US (IFM/DFCI) essentially replicates the 
design of the French trial with a cr ucial difference being lenalidomide 
maintenance is indefinite until progressio n ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Evaluation of the OS 
benefit for escalating therapy in pati ents with persistent MRD will immediately 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
13 make the results highly relevant for clinical practice, and will transform MRD 
assessment from a prognostic tool  to an important clinical tool. 
Finally, we will use a double blind, plac ebo-controlled design, allowing for an 
unbiased estimate of the clinical bene fit and the impact on PRO metrics. 
We plan to evaluate multiple secondary endp oints in this trial including several 
exploratory approaches. In addition to standard response rates and PFS, we will 
explore the ability of an additional agent to produce MRD negativity in patients 
who have not been able to achieve MRD neg ativity while taking a single drug for 
12 months. This will provide important  information regarding the clonal 
heterogeneity and the differential effect of two classes of drugs on two clones, as 
can be learned from the accompanying genetic studies.  This trial will prove to be 
a rich resource in asking some important future exploratory questions regarding the biology of the disease. 
1.3 Choice of Intervention 
Ixazomib in myeloma:  Ixazomib is the first oral pr oteasome inhibitor to enter 
clinical practice and is currently ap proved for use in combination with 
lenalidomide in patients with relapsed my eloma. Ixazomib citrate (MLN9708), 
which has been formulated for oral (PO) ad ministration, is a small molecule 
proteasome inhibitor.23-25 It is the citrate ester of t he biologically active boronic 
acid form, ixazomib (MLN2238). In water or aqueous systems, ixazomib citrate 
rapidly hydrolyzes to ixazomib. Sim ilar to bortezomib, ixazomib potently, 
reversibly, and selectively inhibits the 20S proteasome. However, in contrast to 
bortezomib, it has a shorter dissociation ha lf-life (t1/2) that may contribute to 
increased tissue distribution. Bortezomib has a slowly reversible dissociation rate 
from the red blood cell proteasome, while ixazomib demonstrates a more rapidly 
reversible dissociation rate from the bl ood but sustained effects on bone marrow 
and tumor proteasomes suggesting better tissue distribution. Ixazomib has been 
studied in several phase I and phase I/II st udies evaluating both twice-weekly 
and weekly dosing sche dules. In the twice-weekly dos ing schedule, ixazomib is 
given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day  cycle; in the week ly dosing schedule, 
the drug is given on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. To date, the development of oral ixazomib has focused on multiple myeloma [relapsed and/or 
refractory and newly diagnosed] and a rela ted plasma cell d yscrasia, systemic 
light chain (AL) amyloidosis. 
In Study C16005, ixazomib was  given weekly (Days 1, 8, and 15), in combination 
with lenalidomide (Days 1-21), and dexameth asone (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22) in a 
28-day cycle.
26 Patients with newly diagnosed MM  were enrolled and treated with 
oral ixazomib (days 1, 8, and 15) plus  lenalidomide 25 mg (days 1-21) and 
dexamethasone 40 mg (days 1, 8, 15, 22) for up to twelve 28-day cycles, then 
maintenance therapy with ixazomib (same schedule) every 28 days until 
progression. Patients could undergo stem cell collection after three cycles and 
discontinue for autologous stem  cell transplant (ASCT) after six cycles. Overall, 
65 patients were enrolled, 15 in Phase I and 50 in Phase II. Patients received a median of six cycles (range 1-19) with 27 (42%) remaining on treatment as of November 2012. Of those who have undergone stem cell mobilization, a median yield was 11.3 x 10
6 CD34+ cells/Kg (range 5-28). Ixazomib maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) was established as 2.97 mg/m2 and RP2D was selected as 2.23 
mg/m2; RP2D translates to a 4.0 mg fixed dose based on population PK results. 
Among the 64 evaluable patient s, the overall response rate was 92%, including 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
14 55% Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)  and 23% CR. Median time to first 
response was 0.92 months (range 0.89-6.44) . Importantly, in this trial, 25 patients 
continued on maintenance ixazomib with no ad ditional toxicity or toxicity-related 
discontinuation, but with increasing depth of response with time. Given the data 
on proteasome inhibitor –IMiD combinations in myeloma, adding ixazomib to 
lenalidomide allows us to utilize an effectiv e agent, and allows us to do a double-
blind study which is critical for evaluat ion of patient reported outcomes. 
The combination of ixazomib and lenalido mide has been studied as maintenance 
therapy post autologous SCT.27 This phase II trial enrolled 64 patients with a 
median age of 60 (range 39-74); 34 remain ed on therapy as of May 2017 having 
received a median of 28 cycles (range 1-51). Best overall response included stringent Complete Response (sCR 7.8%),  CR (26.5%), VGPR (53%) and PR 
(10.9%). 29 patients had an improvement in  their best overall response from their 
baseline response. The m edian PFS had not been reached with a median follow 
up of 37.8 months; estimated 2-year PFS is  81%. 30 patients are off study: 16 
due to progressive disease (PD), 3 at PI discretion, and 11 due to consent withdrawal. 22 patients had G1/2 peripher al neuropathy (PN); 6 patients had G3 
PN. 16 patients required a dose reduction to 2.4 mg for PN (8), neutropenia (3), 
hearing loss (2), rash (1), thromboc ytopenia (1) and 4 patients discontinued 
ixazomib for neuropathy (2 ), neutropenia (1), and thrombocytopenia (1). 15 
patients had a dose reduction of Len to 10 mg for 21 days of a 28-day cycle, while 9 patients had a dose redu ction to 5 mg for 28 days. 
We selected ixazomib as the intervention in this trial for several reasons: 
1. Ixazomib appears to be at least as effe ctive when used in combination with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed myeloma, when 
comparing the results of the C16005 tr ial with the published data with VRd. 
Patients coming on this trial would ha ve received on average four cycles of 
bortezomib containing regimen (VRd or VCd) as induction prior to stem cell 
transplantation, and hence would be relati vely PI naïve. To further allay the 
concerns of the steering committee, we have now excluded any patient who 
progressed on a bortezomib-containing regimen pre-SCT or were primary refractory. This is likely to be a small population considering the high 
response rate with VRd and VCd.
24 
2. Ixazomib has the added advantage of being taken orally, and making it more 
convenient and acceptable for a patient  who has been on oral maintenance 
for a year and now may be hesitant to co me back in weekly for an injectable 
medication. An integrat ed analysis of ixazom ib maintenance across 4 
different studies was presented recent ly demonstrating a continued increase 
in depth of response with continued treatment, with excellent tolerability.28 
The phase III trial of ixazomib maintenance versus placebo was recently announced to show a PFS benefit for ixazomib. 
3. The oral nature of the medication also allows us to do a placebo-controlled 
trial (Takeda has agreed to provide this),  which will allow us to make a true 
estimate of the impact of therapy es calation on quality of life and patient 
reported outcomes. 
4. The combination of ixazomib and lena lidomide as maintenance was studied 
in a phase II trial by investigators at  MD Anderson and the results presented 
recently points toward this regimen bei ng effective and well-tolerated in the 
setting of post-transplant maintenance.
27 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
15 5. Most importantly, this design will  nicely complement the SWOG maintenance 
trial, which is examining a de-escalat ion of a daratumumab + lenalidomide-
based maintenance in the setting of no residual disease. This study will 
evaluate a PI and IMiD combination aski ng an equally relevant question of 
escalating therapy in face of resid ual disease. Given th e three important 
therapeutic classes of current t herapies, examining both a PI and IMiD 
combination as well as a monoclonal an tibody (MoAb) + IMiD in this MRD 
guided treatment setting is important. 
6. Finally, use of ixazomib as the add-on for escalating treatme nt will also keep 
other important classes of drugs, especially daratumumab (or anti-CD38 MoABs), in reserve for use at the time of the first relapse. 
1.4 Patient Reported Outcomes Component 
1.4.1 Background 
Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) th at measure the impact of disease 
and treatment on well-being from a physical, functional, emotional and 
social perspective are an importan t part of the benefit equation. 
Health-related quality of life  (QOL) assessments have been 
incorporated into prior phase III multiple myeloma clinical trials and 
have been very useful in putting the re sults of these phase III trials in 
perspective. In fact, one of the earlie st studies to address this was the 
phase III trial comparing an early SCT to a delayed SCT.43 It was 
concluded that an early SCT was  preferable based on the QOL 
estimates analyzed, which was defin ed as the time without symptoms 
and toxicity (Q-TWiST). More recently, there has been increased interest in assessing QOL among pa tients with MM given significant 
improvement in survival observ ed as well as the availability of 
different treatment options. A phase III trial of thalidomide 
maintenance evaluated QOL using the EORTC QLQ-C30 instrument 
in combination with a disease specific module. Assessments were performed every 2 months to 6 months  then Q3 monthly to 5 years. A 
change score of 10 points from ba seline was defined as clinically 
relevant. While PFS was prolonged with maintenance therapy, there was significant worsening of all the QOL parameters studied.
35 In 
another phase III trial comparin g three different bortezomib 
combinations as upfront therap y for transplant ineligible patients 
(bortezomib-dexamethasone, bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone, bortezomib-melphal an-prednisone, followed by 
bortezomib maintenance therapy), patient-reported QOL was 
recorded also using the EO RTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire.
44 Decline in 
QOL parameters were observed in the early phases of therapy in all 
groups with recovery over time. These results demonstrate the feasibility of conducting health- related QOL assessments in the 
context of multicenter clinical trials as well as its value in reaching the 
eventual conclusions. Intensifying therapy and/or prolonging duration 
of therapy comes at a price economically due to patient financial 
burden and clinically due to sub-optim al tolerability, both of which may 
impact QOL. Research exploring fact ors contributing to medication 
adherence and the impact of side effects and symptom burden from 
the patient perspective, however, is limited. 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
16 1.4.2 Rationale 
Patients and physicians often deci de to alter therapy based on a 
variety of factors including patient age, patient and physician 
preference, response status, and toxicity from ongoing therapy. As we explore the concept of increasing the rate of MRD negativity by 
intensifying the therapy, it is important to assess the impact that the 
intervention has on PROs. With a comprehensive PRO evaluation, we 
will elucidate potential advantages and expand understanding at key 
clinical decision points. We hypothes ize that adding ix azomib will not 
be associated with significantly worse treatment-related QOL compared with continuing on le nalidomide monotherapy given the 
oral, intermittent nature of ix azomib therapy. Furthermore, we 
hypothesize that longerper iods of ixazomib ther apy will lower risk of 
disease progression and will  may y ield improved QOL.  For this trial, 
we have chosen specific time points for primary comparison between arms, however, with limited QOL rese arch in this setting we have yet 
to determine whether these are appropriate. Towards that end, it is also important to assess tim ing of QOL changes afforded with 
relatively frequent longitudinal QOL assessment. Beyond comparing 
treatment arms, we will evaluate th e relationship between conversion 
from MRD-positive to MRD-negative status and change in QOL with the hypothesis that responders have  comparatively better QOL than 
non-responders, a favorable outcome for the intervention arm. This assessment will have clinical translat ional value, as this will be one of 
the considerations as we move towa rds an MRD directed strategy in 
the clinic. Lastly, poor medicati on adherence as well as increased 
incidence and/or severity of patient reported adverse events are 
expected to be associated with lower QOL. 
QOL assessments performed every three months during the first year 
post randomization will provide valua ble longitudinal data to quantify 
the impact of the different m aintenance approaches on patient QOL. 
Similar measurements during year 2 will provide an insight into the 
effects of disease recurrence on QO L measurements, as there will be 
an increasing proportion of patients on the control arm who will start to 
demonstrate biochemical recurrences . To interpret these maintenance 
QOL analyses, we will capture act ual treatment received over the 
given period and monitor patient- specific barriers to medication 
adherence. As well, we will measur e the impact of symptom burden 
and treatment-related side effects from a patient perspective. Assessing PROs during main tenance will, therefore, be of critical 
importance to the evaluation of the over all benefit of this therapeutic 
strategy and its clinical utility . PRO metrics, unfortunately, depend 
heavily on patient perspe ctive that can be altered in different ways by 
the burden of therapy and the response to therapy. A placebo-controlled design such as the one proposed, however, enables an 
unbiased assessment of the true impa ct of altering therapy based on 
the MRD status. 
1.4.3 Design 
Chosen PRO instruments are designed  to capture potential side-
effects from treatment intervention,  the impact of disease recurrence, 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
17 behavior towards taking treatment, and health-related quality of life. 
The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) 
(http://www.facit.org ) and the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of 
the Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) 
(https://healthcaredeliver y.cancer.gov/pro-ctcae/ ) measurement 
systems will be utilized. Specifically , general health-related quality of 
life will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy – General (FACT-G) including 2 subscales [physical well-
being (PWB) and functional  well-being (FWB)].39 We will add a 
treatment-specific tool to evalua te neurotoxicity along with the 
disease-specific multiple myeloma assessment.40,70 These 
instruments have been validated and ha ve been incorporated into our 
prior phase III MM treatment trials (E1A05, E1A06) as well as current 
phase III trials (E1A11, E3A06).31,41 More recently, data from E1A05 
showed the FACT-MM was feasible fo r use in clinical trials to 
measure myeloma-related function s and demonstrated acceptable 
psychometric properties. 
NCI PRO-CTCAE items will evaluate treatment-emergent side effects 
expected with ixazomib and lenalido mide. This will be coupled with 
routine provider initiated and prot ocol specific interval toxicity 
assessment to inform a more compre hensive assessment, both as it 
concerns intensity and frequency, of perceived and experienced side 
effects from therapy. Furthermore, side effects from prolonged therapy with lenalidomide and ixaz omib perceived by a patient and 
captured with the NCI PRO-CTCAE may be different than when 
assessed by a provider , an analysis that has not been performed yet 
in former clinical trials invol ving these agents. Considering the 
importance of reliable compliance with  prescribed oral therapy as it 
concerns therapeutic benefit, unde rstanding treatment adherence is 
important. Aside from tabulating comp liance with continuous, protocol 
specific lenalidomide and ixazom ib therapy based on patient 
medication calendars, medication taki ng behavior will be evaluated 
with the Adherence Starts with Knowledge (ASK-12).
42,43 The timing of 
PRO measurements will be consistent  with office visits primarily 
during treatment, and will vary based on the instrument. 
1.5 Imaging Component 
1.5.1 Background 
Advanced imaging modalities have co ntributed significantly to our 
understanding of disease biology in multiple myeloma and is an 
integral component of the diagno stic criteria, differentiating 
asymptomatic precursor stages from ac tive disease. Multiple different 
modalities have been used in myeloma studies and provide complementary information. 
18F-FDG PET/CT allows simultaneous 
assessment of the bone, as well as presence of extramedullary 
lesions. MRI allows better assessment of the soft tissue and marrow 
involvement, especially with the us e of diffusion-weighted images. 
Both baseline assessments, as well as follow-up imaging, also have 
an important prognostic role and appear to be associated with the 
survival of patients with MM. Myeloma  cells, while they tend to be 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
18 primarily marrow-based, can be found in the extramedullary 
compartment, including the periphera l blood. As a result, imaging 
plays an important role in assessing  response to th erapy as well as 
identifying disease progression, bo th inside and outside the marrow. 
In fact, functional im aging assessment using 18F-FDG PET/CT is an 
integral part of minimal residual  disease assessment in myeloma in 
addition to following foci of extramedullary disease identified prior to 
start of treatment. Ongoing studies continue to explore new modalities 
as well as novel tracers to better identify the tumor cells. 
1.5.2 Rationale 
There is much to be learned in ter ms of the added value of imaging to 
the assessment of disease respons e and outcomes using traditional 
protein-based disease assessments. The value of PET-CT and MRI 
as tools for assessment of MRD has been assessed in the IFM2009 
trial (IMAJEM).25 That study was able to demonstrate an inferior 
survival outcome associated with pe rsistent positivity even in the 
presence of MRD negativity in the marrow. While MRI changes were observed with therapy, PET-CT appear ed to be more useful in the 
setting of response assessment. Oth er large retrospective studies 
have also examined the value of PET -CT. This trial provides a unique 
opportunity to assess the prognostic impact of PET positive lesions at 
the end of a year of maintenance, and how that may be impacted by the randomized intervention. It also provides a unique opportunity to examine the incremental value of PET-CT to marrow-based MRD 
testing and the impact of discrepa nt findings in the marrow and the 
extramedullary compartment. Another area that has not been studied well is the kinetics of relapse, especially in the extramedullary 
compartment. This trial, which will be  enriched in a group of patients 
at higher-than-average risk of relapse (MRD-positive), will allow us to 
study the kinetics of extramedulla ry relapse in the context of 
biochemical relapse. Impor tantly, this will give us  a unique opportunity 
to validate the currently propos ed criteria for PET-CT assessment.
29  
1.5.3 Design 
18F-FDG PET/CT is currently considered  a standard imaging modality 
for initial assessment, as part  of MRD assessment and for 
identification of relapsed di sease. Patients in th is trial will undergo 
baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT, as well as 18F-FDG PET/CT at 12 and 24 
cycles from study entry, in ad dition to those done for MRD 
confirmation. The serial imaging studies will be centrally reviewed, allowing us to complete the aims proposed.

Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Investigator Registration Procedures 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
policy require all individuals co ntributing to NCI-sponsored trials to register and to renew 
their registration annually. To register, all individuals must obtain a Cancer Therapy 
Evaluation Program (CTEP) Identity an d Access Management (IAM) account at 
https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/iam . In addition, persons with a registration type of 
Investigator (IVR), Non-Physician Investigat or (NPIVR), or Associate Plus (AP) must 
complete their annual regi stration using CTEP’s web -based Registration and Credential 
Repository (RCR) at https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/rcr . 
RCR utilizes five person registration types. 
x IVR — MD, DO, or international equivalent; 
x NPIVR — advanced practice providers (e.g ., NP or PA) or graduate level 
researchers (e.g., PhD); 
x AP — clinical site staff (e.g., RN or CR A) with data entry access to CTSU 
applications such as the Roster Update Ma nagement System [RUMS], OPEN, Rave, 
acting as a primary site cont act, or with consenting privileges; 
x Associate (A) — other clinical site staff involved in the conduct of NCI-sponsored 
trials; and 
x Associate Basic (AB) — individuals (e.g., pharmaceutical company employees) with 
limited access to NCI-supported systems. 
RCR requires the following registration documents: 
Documentation Required IVR NPIVR AP A AB 
FDA Form 1572 D D    
Financial Disclosure Form D D D

training, employment, license, 
and certification) D D D   
GCP training D D D   
Agent Shipment Form (if 
applicable) D     
CV (optional) D D D   
An active CTEP-IAM user account and appro priate RCR registration is required to 
access all CTEP and Cancer Tr ials Support Unit (CTSU) webs ites and applications. In 
addition, IVRs and NPIVRs must list all clinic al practice sites and IRBs covering their 
practice sites on the FDA Form 1572 in RCR to allow the following: 
x Added to a site roster 
x Assigned the treating, credit, consenting, or drug shipment (IVR only) tasks in OPEN 
x Act as the site-protocol PI on the IRB approval 
x Assigned the Clinical Investigator (CI) ro le on the Delegation of Tasks Log (DTL) 
In addition, all investigators act as the Site -Protocol PI (investigator listed on the IRB 
approval), consenting/treating/drug shipment in vestigator in OPEN, or as the CI on the Rev. Add3 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023

Trials Network (NCTN) and NCI Communit y Oncology Research Program (NCORP) 
Research Bases after March 1, 2019, all U.S. -based sites must be members of the NCI 
Central Institutional Review Board (NCI CIRB). In addition, U.S.-based sites must accept 
the NCI CIRB review to activate new studies at the site after March 1, 2019. Local IRB 
review will continue to be accepted for studie s that are not reviewed by the CIRB, or if 
the study was previously open at the site unde r the local IRB. International sites should 
continue to submit Research Ethics Board (REB) approval  to the CTSU Regulatory 
Office following country- specific regulations.  
Sites participating with the NCI CIRB must submit the Study Specific Worksheet for 
Local Context (SSW) to the CIRB using IRB Mana ger to indicate their intent to open the 
study locally. The NCI CIRB’s approval of th e SSW is automatically communicated to the 
CTSU Regulatory Office, but sites are required to contact the CTSU Regulatory Office at 
CTSURegPref@ctsu.coccg.org  to establish site preferences for applying NCI CIRB 
approvals across their Signatory Network. Site  preferences can be set at the network or 
protocol level. Questions about  establishing site preferen ces can be addressed to the 
CTSU Regulatory Office by email or  calling 1-888-651-CTSU (2878). 
In addition, the Site-Protocol Principal Inve stigator (PI) (i.e. the investigator on the 
IRB/REB approval) must meet the following cr iteria in order for the processing of the 
IRB/REB approval record to be completed: 
x Holds an active CTEP status; 
x Active status at the site(s) on the IRB/REB approval ( applies to US and Canadian 
sites only ) on at least one participating organization’s roster;

4.3.5 Imaging Submission Using Tr ansfer of Images and Data 
Transfer of Images and Data (TRI AD) is the American College of 
Radiology’s (ACR) image ex change application. TRIAD provides sites 
participating in clinical trials a se cure method to transmit images. 
TRIAD anonymizes and validates the images as they are transferred. 
TRIAD Access Requirements: 
x A valid CTEP-IAM account.  
x Registration and Credential Reposit ory (RCR) registration type of: 
Associate (A), Associate Plus (AP), Non-Physician Investigator 
(NPIVR), or Investigator (IVR) re gistration type. Refer to the CTEP 
Registration Procedures section for instructions on how to request 
a CTEP-IAM account and complete registration in RCR. 
x TRIAD Site User role on an NCTN or ETCTN roster. 
All individuals on the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core provider 
roster have access to TRIAD and ma y submit images for credentialing 
purposes, or for enrollments to which the provider is linked in OPEN. 
TRIAD Installation: 
To submit images, the individual holdi ng the TRIAD Site User role will 
need to install the TRIAD application on their workstation. TRIAD installation documentation is available at https://triadinstall.acr.org/triadclient/ . 
This process can be done in parallel to obtaining your CTEP-IAM 
account and RCR registration. 
For questions, contact TRIAD Technical Support staff via email 
TRIAD-Support@acr.org  or 1-703-390-9858. 
Image Submission and Quality Assurance Review: 
Standard of Care (SOC) 18F-FDG Whole Body PET/CT imaging 
should ideally use the same scanner and should be used consistently across all imaging time points for the same patient 
if possible. If the same scanner is not available, equipment that 
most closely approximates the baseline scanner should be used. 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
34 For 18F FDG PET CT imaging time from 18F-FDG injection to 
beginning of PET CT acquisition will be 60 minutes +/- 10 
minutes. This is to be adhered to for all PET CT scanners and 
study time points. 
Upon arrival at the PET  facility for their 18F-FDG Whole Body scan, 
confirm that the patient is properly  prepared for the imaging study per 
institutional guidelines inclu ding but not limited to: 
The patient is fasting for at least 4 hours but should be hydrated with 
plain water. 
The time between injection of 18F-FDG and imaging should be 60 
minutes +/- 10 minutes. 
The patient’s  weight and height are measured and recorded (not 
verbally relayed by the subject). 
The pre-injection blood glucose level is  in accordance with institutional 
guidelines (typically < 200 mg/dL, measured ideally within one hour of 
18F-FDG injection). If the serum glucose  is out of the expected range, 
the study should be rescheduled. The referring physician or primary physician of the subject should be contacted to optimize blood 
glucose control.  
In diabetic patients, insulin inject ion is not administered for at least 6 
hours before the injection of 
18F-FDG. In patients on oral anti-diabetic 
medications, these drugs must be  taken as planned before the 
injection of 18F-FDG. 
The patient should be off steroids for at least 24 hours and if on 
intravenous glucose/dext rose, they should be stopped for 6 hours. 
All imaging time points for repeat PET imaging should ideally use the 
same scanner and the same imaging  parameters as used for the 
baseline PET study. 
There are several sources for SOC guidelines for 18F-FDG Whole 
Body PET/CT scans. For this study, the following should serve as the 
minimum requirement to be used locally: http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/47/6/1059.long . 
All imaging time points should be submitted to the ACR Core 
Laboratory via TRIAD for Image Quality Assurance (IQA) review. Imaging should be submitted within three (3) business days from 
the time of acquisition to ensure rapid review and prompt 
feedback of any discrepancies from the Core Lab.  
Upon image receipt, a Core Lab Imaging Technologist will perform an 
IQA review of the image data to ensu re that all imaging is intact and 
has been submitted in its entirety (i.e., primary PET AC, PET NAC 
and CTAC series), the recommended imaging parameters were 
followed, and the exam is of adequate  image quality. In the event that 
an exam is deemed non-co mpliant or is missing critical DICOM tags 
used for SUV analysis (i.e., weight, height and time of injection), a Core Lab Imaging Technologist will i ssue a query within the Medidata Rev. Add1 
Rev. Add1 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
35 Rave data management system. Sites are expected to resolve data 
queries within seven (7) business days. 
NOTE:  Please refrain from anonymizing the DICOM header of 
any exam prior to uploading into the TRIAD 
application.  Custom DICOM editing can exclude an exam 
from the final analysis, due to  the omission of technical 
data elements. These elements include, but are not limited to, the study date, scanner station name, scanner serial 
number, patient height and weight and any scan 
acquisition parameter. TRIAD has been uniquely configured to locate and scrub all PHI from the exam’s DICOM header, during the image transfer to ensure the anonymity of our trial patients. 
4.4 Emergency Unblinding 
The information provided below is for the use by a physician, nurse, CRA or 
pharmacist treating the patient. These co ntact numbers should not be used by 
patients. Patients should be instructed to call their doctor’s office in the event of an emergency or adverse event that may resu lt in the need to unblind the patient. 
In the event of an emergency or se vere adverse reaction necessitating 
identification of the medication for the welfare of the patient, please contact the

5.3 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
All adverse events described throughout  this protocol and all reportable 
adverse events on this protocol will be graded using the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. 
All appropriate treatment areas should  have access to a copy of the CTCAE 
version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.ht
m). 
Clinician graded CTCAE is the AE (adverse event) safety standard. PRO-CTCAE 
items are to complement CTCAE reporting.  Patients will respond to PRO-CTCAE 
items but no protocol directed action will be taken. PRO-CTCAE is not intended 
for expedited reporting, real time  review or safety reporting. 
5.3.1 Purpose 
Adverse event (AE) data collection and reporting, which are a 
required part of every clinical trial, are done so investigators and regulatory agencies ca n detect and analyze adv erse events and risk 
situations to ensure the safety of the patients enrolled, as well as 
those who will enroll in future st udies using similar agents. 
5.3.2 Routine Reporting of Ad verse Events (Medidata Rave) 
Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times 
during a trial using the Medidata Rave clinical data management 
system. Please refer to Section 4.3.3  of the protocol for more 
information on how to access the Medidata Rave system and the 
EAA171 forms packet for instructions on where, when and what 
adverse events are to be reported routinely on this protocol.  
Symptomatic Adverse Events reported by patients through PRO-
CTCAE are not safety reporting and may be presented with other 
routine AE data. Rev. Add1 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
38 5.3.3 Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events (CTEP-AERS) 
In addition to routine reporting, ce rtain adverse events must be also 
reported in an expedited manner for timelier monitoring of patient 
safety and care. The remainder of this section provides information 
and instructions regarding expedit ed adverse event reporting. 
5.3.4 Terminology 
x Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence associated 
with the use of an agent in humans, whether or not considered agent related. Therefore, an AE can be ANY unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or 
not considered related to  the medicinal product. 
x Attribution:  An assessment of the relationship between the adverse 
event and the protocol treatmen t, using the following categories. 
ATTRIBUTION DESCRIPTION 
Unrelated The AE is clearly NOT  related  to protocol 
treatment. 
Unlikely The AE is doubtfully related  to protocol 
treatment. 
Possible The AE may be related  to protocol treatment. 
Probable The AE is likely related  to protocol treatment. 
Definite The AE is clearly related  to protocol treatment. 
x CAEPR (Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks 
List):  An NCI generated list of reported and/or potential AEs 
associated with an agent currently under an NCI IND. Information contained in the CAEPR is compiled from the Investigator’s Brochure, the Package Insert, as well as company safety reports. 
x CTCAE:  The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
provides a descriptive terminology that is to be utilized for AE 
reporting. A grade (severity) is provided for each AE term. 
x Hospitalization (or prolongation of hospitalization): For AE 
reporting purposes, a hospitalizati on is defined as an inpatient 
hospital stay equal to or greater than 24 hours. 
x Life Threatening Adverse Event:  Any AE that places the patient at 
immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred. 
x Serious Adverse Event (SAE): Any adverse event occurring at any 
dose that results in ANY of the following outcomes: 
x Death 
x A life-threatening  adverse event  
x Inpatient hospitalization or prol ongation of existing hospitalization 
(for ≥ 24 hours).  
x A persistent or significant incap acity or substantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions.  
x A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Rev. Add3 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
39 x Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be 
life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the ou tcomes listed in this definition. 
x SPEER (Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting):  A 
subset of AEs within the CAEPR that contains a list of events that are 
protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting. If an AE meets the reporting requirements of the protocol,  and it is listed on the SPEER, it 
should ONLY be reported expediti ously if the grade being reported 
exceeds the grade listed in the pa rentheses next to the event. 
5.3.5 Expedited Adverse Ev ent Reporting Procedure 
The Rave Cancer Therapy Evaluat ion Program Adverse Event 
Reporting System (CTEP-AERS) Integr ation enables evaluation of 
Adverse Events (AE) entered in Rave to determine whether they require expedited reporting and facilitates entry in CTEP-AERS for those AEs requiring expedited reporting.  Sites must initiate all AEs for 
this study in Medidata Rave. 
Sites must initiate all AEs for this study in Medidata Rave. Pre-treatment AEs: AEs that occur after informed consent is signed 
and prior to start of treatment ar e collected in Medidata Rave using 
the Pre-treatment Adverse Event form. Pre-existing medical 
conditions (formerly referred to as baseline AEs) identified during 
baseline assessment are not cons idered AEs and therefore should 
not be reported on the Pre-treatment Adverse Event form. If these pre-existing conditions worsen in severity, the investigator must 
reassess the event to determine if an expedited report is required. 
Whether or not an expedited report is required, the worsened event 
should be reported as a routine AE. 
Treatment-emergent AEs: All AEs that occur after start of treatment 
are collected in Medidata Rave, using the Adverse Event form, which is available for entry at each treatm ent course or reporting period and 
is used to collect AEs that start dur ing the period or persist from the 
previous reporting period. AEs that occur 30 Days after the Last 
Administration of the Investigati onal Agent/Intervention are collected 
using the Late Adverse Event form. 
Prior to sending AEs through the rules  evaluation process, site staff 
should verify the following on the Adverse Event form in Rave: 
x The reporting period (course/cycle) is correct and 
x AEs are recorded and complete (no missing fields) and the form is 
query free. 
NOTE:  The CRA reports AEs in Rave at the time the Investigator 
learns of the event. 
NOTE:  If the CRA modifies an AE, it must be re-submitted for 
rules evaluation. Rev. Add1 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
40 Upon completion of AE entry in Medidata Rave, the CRA submits the 
AE for rules evaluation by completing the Expedited Reporting 
Evaluation form. Both NCI and protocol-specific reporting rules 
evaluate the AEs submitted for ex pedited reporting. A report is 
initiated in CTEP-AERS using info rmation entered in Medidata Rave 
for AEs that meet reporting requirements. The CRA completes the 
report by accessing CTEP-AERS vi a a direct link on the Medidata 
Rave Expedited Reporting Evaluati on form. Contact the CTSU Help 
Desk at 1-888-823-5923 or by email at ctsucontact@westat.com  if 
you have any issues submitting an expedited report in CTEP-AERS. 
In the rare occurrence that internet connectivity is lost, a 24-hour 
notification is to be made to CTEP by telephone at: 
x (301-897-7497). 
Once internet connectivity is rest ored, the 24-hour notification that 
was phoned in must be entered immediately into CTEP-AERS using 
the direct link from Medidata Rave. 
Additional information about the CT EP-AERS integration is available 
on the CTSU members’ website:

reported as follows: 
1. Complete a Second Primary Form in Medidata Rave within 14 
days. 
2. Report the diagnosis expeditiou sly by initially reporting it 
PROMPTLY upon learning of the secondary malignancy on the 
Adverse Event Form or Late Adverse Event Form in the 
appropriate Treatment Cycle or Post Registration folder in Medidata Rave. Once the adverse event is entered into Rave, the Rules Engine on the Expedited Reporting Evaluation Form will confirm whether or not the seco nd primary requires expedited 
reporting. The CTEP-AERS report must then be initiated directly 
from the Expedited Reporting Evaluation Form in Medidata Rave. 
Do not initiate the CTEP-AERS report via the CTEP-AERS 
website. 
Report under a.) leukemia seconda ry to oncology chemotherapy, 
b.) myelodysplastic syndrome, c. ) treatment related secondary 
malignancy or d) Neoplasms Other , malignant (grade 3 or 4) 
NOTE:  When reporting attribution on the AE form, assess 
the relationship between the secondary malignancy and the current protocol treatment ONLY (and NOT relationship to anti-cancer agent received either before or after protocol treatment).  
NOTE: We encourage all sites to confirm the Rules Engine 
assessment with the Second Primary reporting requirements outlined in this section.  
3. Report the diagnosis via http://ctep.cancer.gov . 
4. Upload a copy of the pathology report to ECOG-ACRIN via 
Medidata Rave and submit a copy to NCI/CTEP confirming the 
diagnosis.

2 Myocardial infarction and cerebrova scular accident (stroke) have been observed in multiple myeloma 
patients treated with lenalidomde and dexamethasone. 
3 Graft vs. host disease has been observed in subjec ts who have received lenalidomide in the setting of 
allo-transplantation. 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
55 4 Infection includes all 75 sites of infection under the INFECTIONS AND INFESTATIONS SOC. 
5 The rare adverse event of rh abdomyolysis has been observed with lenalidomide. The reports of 
rhabdomyolysis were confounded by concurrent use of statins and de xamethasone, concurrent viral 
and bacterial infections, trauma, and serotonin syndr ome. Statins, infections, trauma, and serotonin 
syndrome are known risk factors for rhabdomyolysis. 
6 There has been an increased frequency of sec ondary malignancies (SPM) including ALL, AML, and 
MDS, and certain other types of cancers of the skin and other organs in multiple myeloma (MM) 
patients being treated with melphalan, prednisone, an d lenalidomide post bone marrow transplant. The 
use of lenalidomide in cancers other than MM, shows that invasive SPMs occurred in a small number of 
patients. Patients treated with lenalidomide should be cl osely followed for the occurance of SPMs. 
7 Serious tumor flare reactions have been observed in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 
and lymphoma. 
8 A decrease in the number of stem cells (CD34+ cells) collected from patients treated with >4 cycles of 
lenalidomide has been reported. 
9 Significantly increased risk of deep vein thrombos is (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and arterial 
thrombosis has been observed in patients with multiple myeloma receiving lenalidomide with 
dexamethasone. 
10 Gastrointestinal hemorrhage includes: Anal hemo rrhage, Cecal hemorrhage, Colonic hemorrhage, 
Duodenal hemorrhage, Esophageal hemorrhage, Esophageal varices hemorrhage, Gastric 
hemorrhage, Hemorrhoidal hemor rhage, Ileal hemorrhage, Intr a-abdominal hemorrhage, Jejunal 
hemorrhage, Lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage, Oral  hemorrhage, Pancreatic hemorrhage, Rectal 
hemorrhage, Retroperitoneal hemorrhage, and Upper  gastrointestinal hemorrhage under the 
GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS SOC. 
11 Gastrointestinal obstruction includes: Colonic obstruction, Duodenal ob struction, Esophageal 
obstruction, Ileal obstruction, Jejunal obstruction, Obstruction gastric, Rectal obstruction, and Small 
intestinal obstruction under the GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS SOC. 
12 Osteonecrosis of the jaw has be en seen with increased frequency when lenalidomide is used in 
combination with bevacizumab, docetaxel (Taxotere®),  prednisone, and zolendronic acid (Zometa®). 
NOTE : While not observed in human subjects, lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, 
caused limb abnormalities in a developmental  monkey study similar to birth defects 
caused by thalidomide in hum ans. If lenalidomide is used during pregnancy, it may 
cause birth defects or embryo-fetal deat h. Pregnancy must be ex cluded before start 
of treatment. Prevent pregnancy during treatm ent by the use of two reliable methods 
of contraception. 
NOTE:  In a trial of first line treatment of pa tients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 
single agent lenalidomide (CC- 5013) increased the risk of death as compared to 
control arm (chlorambucil). 
NOTE:  In two randomized trials of  patients with multiple myeloma (MM), the addition of MK-
3475 (pembrolizumab) to a thalidomide a nalog plus dexamethasone, resulted in 
increased mortality. Treatment of patients  with MM with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking 
antibody, such as MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) , in combination with a thalidomide 
analog, such as lenalidomide, is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials. 
NOTE:  In a clinical trial in patients with Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), there was an increase 
in early deaths (within 20 weeks); 12.9% in  the lenalidomide (CC-5013) arm vs. 7.1% 
in the control arm. 
Adverse events reported on lenalidomide (C C-5013) trials, but for which there is 
insufficient evidence to suggest that there was a reasonable possibility that lenalidomide 
(CC-5013) caused the adverse event:

58 5.5 Dose Modifications 
NOTE: Dose modifications are based on adverse events, which are possibly, 
probably or definitely related to drug. More than one dose reduction per 
cycle may occur. 
Patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 AE’s that  are possibly, probably or definitely 
related to a particular agent(s) requiring dose modifications as per the tables 
below will have that particular agent(s) held until resolution of the AE. If AE 
improves to baseline or ≤ grade 1 prior to next scheduled dose, treatment should 
be restarted with a one dose level redu ction for the causative drug for the 
remainder of the cycle. The next cycle wil l then continue with this reduced dose 
level. Patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 AEs that are possibl y, probably or 
definitely related to a particular agent(s) which occur on or after the last treatment day of a cycle, will have that particul ar agent(s) reduced by one dose level 
beginning with the next cycle. 
NOTE:  If the AE is attributed to a specif ic drug, only that drug needs dose 
reduction. If the AE is possibly a ttributed to more than one agent, the 
more likely agent can be first reduced, and then the other drug if the toxicity recurs. If both drugs are equally likely to have contributed to the toxicity, reduce the ixazomib/placebo first. 
Once a patient ’s dose has been reduced, no dose -re-escalation is permitted 
unless it is clear that the drug was not re sponsible for the toxicity that led to the 
dose reduction. 
A delay of up to 14 da ys is allowed between cycles . Any delay beyond 14 days 
should be discussed with the study chair.  If treatment has been delayed for > 8 
weeks due to treatment related toxicity, th e patient will go off study treatment. A 
treatment delay of greater than 14 days, but no longer than 60 days, is allowed if 
the delay is unrelated to study treatment. 
If ixazomib/placebo is held for toxicity, the patient may restart drug during the 
same cycle provided there are ad ditional doses left in the cycle. 
If there is a delay in obtaining lenalidomide for start of a new cycle, the cycle can 
be delayed until it is available in order to allow all drugs to be started at the same time. However, if the cycle has already started, treatment may continue and 
lenalidomide should be started when it becomes available and continue for the 
remaining days of lenalidomide as per cycle. 
PRO-CTCAE data should not be used for determining dose delays or dose 
modifications or any other protocol directed action.

* Creatinine clearance calculation can be made us ing standard methods, but the same method 
should be used for the entire duration of the study. 
5.6 Supportive Care 
5.6.1 All supportive measures consiste nt with optimal patient care will be 
given throughout the study. 
5.6.2 Oral hydration 
Patients are encouraged to drink at l east 6 to 8 cups of liquid per day. 
5.6.3 Disallowed concurrent treatment 
The following treatments are not permitted during the trial: 
x Any other investigational treatment 
x Any other systemic anti-neoplas tic therapy including, but not 
limited to, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy or monoclonal 
antibody therapy 
x Any external beam radiotherapy 
5.6.4 Nausea and/or vomiting 
Standard anti-emetics including 5- hydroxytryptamine 3 serotonin 
receptor antagonists are recommend ed for emesis if it occurs once 
treatment is initiated; prophylactic anti-emetics may also be considered at the physician’s disc retion. Dexamethasone should not 
be administered as an anti-emetic. Fluid deficit should be corrected 
before initiation of study drug and during treatment. 
5.6.5 Blood products and growth factors 
Blood products and growth factors sh ould be utilized as clinically 
warranted and following institutional  policies and recommendations. 
The use of growth factors should follow published guidelines of the 
Journal of Clinical Oncology, Vol 24, No 18 (June 20), 2006: pp. 2932-
2947. Erythropoietic agents, or ot her agents that may increase the 
risk of thrombosis, such as estrog en containing therapies, should be 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
63 used with caution after making a bene fit-risk assessment in patients 
receiving lenalidomide. 
5.6.6 Diarrhea 
Diarrhea should be managed accordin g to clinical practice, including 
the administration of antidiarrheals such as loperamide once 
infectious causes are excluded. F luid intake should be maintained to 
avoid dehydration. Fluid deficit should be corrected before initiation of 
treatment and during treatment. Additional doses of loperamide at 2 
mg every 2-4 hours until diarrhea free (maximum 16 mg/day). 
In the event of Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, the following supportive 
measures are allowed: hydration, octreotide, and antidiarrheals. 
If diarrhea is severe (requiring intravenous rehydration) and/or 
associated with fever or severe ne utropenia (Grade 3 or 4), broad-
spectrum antibiotics must be prescribed. Patients with severe diarrhea 
or any diarrhea associated with severe nausea or vomiting should be 
hospitalized  for intravenous hydration an d correction of electrolyte 
imbalances. Please monitor patie nts carefully for development of 
ileus. 
5.6.7 Herpes Zoster prophylaxis 
Patients may be at an increased risk of infection including reactivation 
of herpes zoster and herpes si mplex viruses. Prophylaxis with 
acyclovir 400 mg PO BID should be  used for all patients while on 
study therapy and for 3 months  beyond the end of therapy. 
5.6.8 Prohibited medications 
Prohibited enzyme inducers 
x Systemic treatment with any of the following metabolizing enzyme 
inducers should be avoided, unle ss there is no appropriate 
alternative medication for the pati ent’s use. (Rationale: If there 
were to be a drug-drug interaction with an inducer, ixazomib/placebo exposur e would be decreased) 
Strong CYP3A inducers 
x Including Rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, carbamazepine, 
phenytoin, and phenobarbital 
Additional strong CYP3A in ducers can be found at: https://drug-
interactions.medicine.iu.edu/main-table.aspx  
Excluded foods and dietary supp lements include St. John’s wort.  
5.6.9 Erythematous Rash with or without Pruritus 
Rash with or without pruritus has been reported with ixazomib, 
primarily at the higher doses tested and when given with agents 
where rash is an overlapping toxicity. The rash may range from limited 
erythematous areas, macular and/or small papular bumps that may or may not be pruritic over a few areas of the body, to a more generalized eruption that is predomin ately on the trunk or extremities. 
Rash has been most commonly char acterized as maculopapular or 
macular. To date, when it does occur, rash is most commonly 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
64 reported within the first three cycl es of therapy. The rash is often 
transient, self-limiting, and is typica lly Grade 1 to 2 in severity. Rash 
can also be seen with lenalidomide , and usually responds to dose 
interruption and dose decrease. 
Symptomatic measures such as antihistamines or corticosteroids (oral 
or topical) have been successful ly used to manage rash and have 
been used prophylactically in subsequent cycles. The use of a topical, IV, or oral steroid (e.g., prednisone ≤10 mg per day or equivalent) is 
permitted. Management of a Grade 3 rash may require intravenous 
antihistamines or corticosteroids. Administration of ixazomib/placebo 
(and/or other causative agent if given in combination) should be 
modified per protocol and re-initiat ed at a reduced level from where 
rash was noted (also, per protocol). 
In line with clinical practice, dermatology consult and biopsy of Grade 
3 or higher rash or any SAE in volving rash is recommended. 
Prophylactic measures should also be considered if a patient has 
previously developed a rash (e.g., us ing a thick, alcohol-free emollient 
cream on dry areas of the body or oral or topical antihistamines). A 
rare side effect is Stevens-Jo hnson Syndrome, a severe and 
potentially life-threatening rash ma rked by skin peeling and mouth 
sores, which should be managed  symptomatically according to 
standard medical practice. Punch biopsies for histopathological analysis are encouraged at the di scretion of the investigator. 
5.6.10 Thrombocytopenia 
Blood counts should be m onitored regularly as out lined in the protocol 
with additional testing obtained acco rding to standard clinical practice. 
Thrombocytopenia may be severe but has been manageable with 
platelet transfusions according to standard clinical practice. Ixazomib/placebo and lenalidomide adm inistration should be modified 
as noted as per dose modification  recommendations in the protocol 
when thrombocytopenia occurs (see Section 5.5). Therapy can be 
reinitiated at a reduced level upon re covery of platelet counts. A rare 
risk is thrombotic thrombocytope nic purpura (TTP), a rare blood 
disorder where blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the 
body characterized by thrombocytopeni a, petechiae, fever, or possibly 
more serious signs and symp toms. TTP should be managed 
symptomatically according to standard medical practice. 
5.6.11 Neutropenia 
Blood counts should be m onitored regularly as out lined in the protocol 
with additional testing obtained acco rding to standard clinical practice. 
Neutropenia may be severe but has been manageable. Growth factor 
support is not required but may be considered according to standard 
clinical practice. Ixazomib/placebo administration shou ld be modified 
as noted as per dose modification  recommendations in the protocol 
when neutropenia occurs. Therapy  can be reinitiated at a reduced 
level upon recovery of ANCs. 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
65 5.6.12 Fluid deficit 
Dehydration should be avoided si nce ixazomib may cause vomiting, 
diarrhea, and dehydration. Patients s hould be encouraged to maintain 
adequate fluid intake. Acute renal failure has been reported in patients treated with ixazomib, commonly in the setting of the previously noted 
gastrointestinal toxicities and dehy dration. Fluid deficit should be 
corrected before initiation of st udy drug and as needed during 
treatment to avoid dehydration. 
5.6.13 Hypotension 
Symptomatic hypotension and orthostatic hypotension with or without 
syncope have been reported with ixaz omib. Blood pressure should be 
closely monitored while the patient is on study treatment and fluid 
deficit should be corrected as needed, especially in the setting of 
concomitant symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or 
anorexia. Patients taking medications and/or diuretics to manage their blood pressure (for either hypo- or hypertension) should be managed according to standard clinical prac tice, including considerations for 
dose adjustments of their concomitant  medications during the course 
of the trial. Fluid deficit should be corrected before initiation of study 
drug and as needed during treatment to avoid dehydration. 
5.6.14 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome 
One case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, which 
ultimately resolved, has been reporte d with ixazomib. This condition is 
characterized by headache, seizur es and visual loss, as well as 
abrupt increase in blood pressure . Diagnosis may be confirmed by 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If the syndrome is diagnosed or 
suspected, symptom-directed treatm ent should be maintained until 
the condition is reversed by control of hypertension or other instigating 
factors. 
5.6.15 Transverse Myelitis 
Transverse myelitis has  also been reported with ixazomib. It is not 
known if ixazomib causes transverse myelitis; however, because it happened to a patient receiving ixazomib, the possibility that ixazomib may have contributed to transver se myelitis cannot  be excluded. 
5.6.16 Thromboprophylaxis 
All patients should be on at leas t 81 mg ASA daily while receiving 
lenalidomide. If they are unable to take ASA or are at high risk of VTE 
per investigator assessment, full dose anticoagulation is 
recommended. 
5.7 Duration of Therapy  
Patients will receive prot ocol therapy unless: 
x Extraordinary Medical Circumstances: If at any time the constraints of this 
protocol are detrimental to the patient' s health, protocol treatment should be 
discontinued. In this event submit for ms according to the instructions in the 
EAA171 Forms Completion Guidelines. 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
66 x Patient withdraws consent. 
x Patient experiences un acceptable toxicity. 
x Non-protocol therapies are administered. 
x Patient experiences disease progression. 
5.8 Duration of Follow-up 
For this protocol, all patients, includin g those who discontinue protocol therapy 
early, will be followed for response until progression, even if non-protocol therapy 
is initiated, and for survival for 10 ye ars from the date of randomization. All 
patients must also be followed through completion of all protocol therapy. Rev. Add3

67 6. Measurement of Effect 
6.1 Response Considerations 
The International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response criteria will 
be adapted to assess response to therapy in this trial.4,44 Since patients are 
entering the study at end of defined dura tion of therapy, and baseline disease 
parameters may not be known, we will limi t the assessments to categories that 
are independent of baseline values (i.e., MRD negative, sCR, CR, and VGPR as defined below). 
6.1.1 Terms and Definitions 
6.1.1.1 M-Protein 
Synonyms include M-spike, monoclonal protein, myeloma 
protein, monoclonal paraprotein, M-component. 
6.1.1.2 Free Light Chain (FLC) Estimation 
Currently carried out using the serum FLC assay (Freelite, 
The Binding Site Limited, UK). Patients with kappa/lambda FLC ratio < 0.26 are defined as having monoclonal lambda FLC and those with ratios > 1. 65 as having a monoclonal 
kappa FLC. The monoclonal light chain isotype is 
considered the involved FLC isotype, and the opposite 
light chain type as the uninvolved FLC type. 
6.1.1.3 Response Terms: 
Only the following response terms will be used in this 
study: Sustained MRD negative (MRD-), Flow MRD-, 
Sequencing MRD-, Imaging Plus MRD-, stringent complete 
response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good 
partial response (VGPR), and progression (PD). Partial response or stable response categories are not being used 
in the current study. 
See Section 6.2 for definitions. 
6.1.1.4 Response Evaluation and Confirmation 
In order to assess hematologic response categories of 
sCR, CR and VGPR, assessment of serum M-protein, serum immunoglobulin free ligh t chain and urine M-protein 
will need to be performed as applicable. Confirmation of these results must be made by verification on two 
consecutive determinations. 
A second confirmatory bone marrow is not required to 
confirm response in any case. 
Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these 
response requirements; however , if radiographic studies 
were performed there should  be no evidence of 
progressive or new bone lesions. 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
68 6.1.1.5 Bone Progression 
Caution must be exercised to av oid rating progression or 
relapse on the basis of vari ation of radiologic technique 
alone. Compression fracture does not exclude continued response and may not indicate progression. 
When progression is based on skeletal disease alone, it 
should be discussed with the st udy chair before removing 
the patient from the study. 
6.1.2 Monoclonal Protein Considerations 
Serum M protein level is quantita ted using densitometry on serum 
protein electrophoresis (SPEP) except in cases where the SPEP is felt to be unreliable. 
x M- proteins migrating in the β-region (usually IgA M-proteins) 
x Cases in which the M-protein is so large and narrow on agarose 
(some specimens > 4 g/dL) that they underestimate the actual 
immunoglobulin level (by greater than 1500 mg/dL) due to technical staining properties of the agarose gel 
x Cases in which there are multiple peaks of same M-protein 
(aggregates or dimers) 
If SPEP is not available or felt to be unreliable (above examples) for 
routine M-protein quantitation, then quantitative immuno globulin levels 
derived from nephelometry or turbidometry can be accepted. However, this must be explicitly reported at baseline, and only nephelometry can be used for that patient to assess response. SPEP 
derived M-protein values and quantitative nephelometric 
immunoglobulin values cannot be used interchangeably. 
Urine M-protein measurement is estimated using 24-hour urine 
protein electrophoresis (UPEP) only.  Random or 24-hour urine tests 
measuring kappa and lambda light chain levels are not reliable and 
are not allowed. 
6.2 Response Categories 
6.2.1 IMWG MRD Negativity Category 
Requires a complete response as defined in Section 6.2.2 . MRD tests 
should be initiated only at the time  of suspected complete response. 
MRD requires no known evidence of  progressive or new bone lesions 
if radiographic studies were performed. However, radiographic studies 
are not required to satisfy these re sponse requirements except for the 
requirement of 18F-FDG PET if imaging MRD-negative status is 
reported. 
6.2.1.1 Sustained MRD Negative 
MRD negativity in the marrow (NGF or NGS, or both) and 
by imaging as defined below, confirmed minimum of 1 year 
apart. Subsequent evaluations can be used to further 
specify the duration of negativity (e.g., MRD-negative at 5 
years) 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
69 6.2.1.2 Flow MRD Negative 
Absence of phenotypically aberra nt clonal plasma cells by 
NGF on bone marrow aspira tes using the EuroFlow 
standard operation procedure for MRD detection in multiple myeloma (or validated equivalent method) with a 
minimum sensitivity of 1 in 10
5 nucleated cells or higher 
6.2.1.3 Sequencing MRD Negative 
Absence of clonal plasma ce lls by NGS on bone marrow 
aspirates in which presence of a clone is defined as less 
than two identical sequencing reads obtained after DNA sequencing of bone marrow as pirates using the ClonoSEQ 
platform (or validated equivalent method) with a minimum sensitivity of 1 in 10
5 nucleated cells or higher 
6.2.1.4 Imaging Plus MRD Negative 
MRD negativity as defined by NGF or NGS plus 
disappearance of every area of increased tracer uptake 
found at baseline or a preceding PET/CT or decrease to less than mediastinal blood pool  SUV or decrease to less 
than that of surrounding normal tissue 
6.2.2 Standard IMWG Response Category 
6.2.2.1 Stringent Complete Response (sCR) 
CR as defined below plus all of the following: 
x Normal serum FLC ratio at two consecutive times and  
x Absence of clonal cell s in bone marrow by 
immunohistochemistry or 2- to 4- color flow cytometry.
a 
x Presence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the κ/λ 
ratio. An abnormal κ/λ ratio by immunohistochemistry 
requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An abnormal ratio reflecting pres ence of an abnormal clone 
is κ/λ ratio of  4:1 or 1:2. 
6.2.2.2 Complete Response (CR) 
Patients who have complete disappearance of an M-
protein and no evidence of myeloma in the bone marrow are considered to have complete response. To be considered CR, patients must  meet all of the following 
criteria: 
x Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine 
x Disappearance of any so ft tissue plasmacytomas 
x ≤ 5% plasma cells in bone marrow 
x If the only measurable disease is FLC, a normal FLC 
ratio of 0.26-1.65 
6.2.2.3 Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) 
x Serum M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not 
quantifiable on electrophoresis AND 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
70 x Urine M-protein < 100 mg/24 hours  
6.2.2.4 Progression (PD) 
Patients will be considered to have met progression if one 
of the following criteria is met. The investigation that 
qualified as progression should be repeated and verified 
on a subsequent occasion only if treating physician deems 
it clinically necessary. 
Increase of ≥ 25% from lowest value reported in 
x Serum M-component and/or (the absolute increase 
must be ≥ 0.5 g/dL). 
x Urine M-component and/or (the absolute increase must 
be ≥ 200 mg/ 24 hours. 
x Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M 
protein levels: the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels. The ab solute increase must be 
> 10 mg/dL. 
x If the only measurable disease is bone marrow, bone 
marrow plasma cell percentage: the absolute % must be ≥ 10%. 
x Development of new bone lesions or soft tissue 
plasmacytomas or ≥ 50% increase from nadir in the 
size (SPD) of existing bone  lesions or soft tissue 
plasmacytoma or ≥ 50% increase in the longest 
diameter of a previous lesion > 1cm in short axis. Plasmacytoma measurements should be taken from 
the CT portion of the PET/CT, or MRI scans, or 
dedicated CT scans where applicable. For patients with only skin involvement, skin lesions should be measured with a ruler. Measurement of tumor size will be determined by the sum of the products of the 
maximal perpendicular diameters of measured lesions 
(SPD). 
6.2.2.5 Clinical Relapse 
One or more of the following direct indicators of increasing 
disease and/or end-organ dysf unction that are considered 
related to the underlying plasma cell proliferative disorder 
with no alternate explanation: 
x Development of new soft tissue plasmacytomas or 
bone lesions on skeletal survey, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging 
x Definite increase in the size of existing plasmacytomas 
or bone lesions. A definite increase is defined as a 
50% (and at least 1 cm) incr ease as measured serially 
by the sum of the products of the cross-diameters of the measurable lesion 
x Hypercalcemia (>11.5 mg/dL; >2.875mM/L) 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
71 x Decrease in hemoglobin of more than 2 g/dL (1.25mM) 
or to less than 10 g/dL 
x Rise in serum creatinine by more than or equal to 2 
mg/dL (≥177mM/L)  
6.3 Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Patient reported outcomes assessments are required for English-speaking 
patients. 
6.3.1 PRO Instruments 
FACT  
Health-related QOL will be assessed with three instruments: 1) the 
FACT-General (G) functional well-being (FWB) and physical well-
being (PWB) subscales.39 Each FACT-G subscale has 7 items. The 
14 items are based on a 5-point Liker t scale (0-4) resulting in a score 
ranging from 0 to 56 points with a higher score indicating better health-related QOL; 2) The FACT/GOG -Neurotoxicity Trial Outcomes 
Index (FACT/GOG-Ntx TOI) comprised of the FWB and PWB subscales plus the neurotoxicity subscale which has 11 items, 
summing to a score of 0-100;
70 and 3) the FACT-Multiple Myeloma 
Trial Outcomes Index (FACT-MM TOI) comprised of the FWB and PWB subscales plus the multiple  myeloma subscale which has 14 
items, summing to a score of 0-112 for the instrument.
40 The 
anticipated time to complete is roughly 8-10 minutes. 
NCI PRO-CTCAE  
NCI PRO-CTCAE items will be administered to allow patients to self-
report symptomatic adverse events experienced on treatment. In its 
current version (dated 6/22/2018), there are 80 symptomatic AE terms included in the PRO-CTCAE item library  which draw directly from the 
CTCAE, the standardized safety assessment lexicon for cancer 
clinical trials. Items correspond to 5 attributes measured [frequency 
(F), severity (S), interference (I), presence/absence (P) and amount (A)] based on multiple choice ques tions. Response for each attribute 
except P which is binary is on a 5-point Likert scale with 5 indicating 
‘almost constantly’ frequency, ‘v ery severe’ severity, ‘very much’ 
amount or ‘very much’ interference. For each attribute, recall is the 
past 7 days. Attributes measured fo r each symptomatic AE varies and 
comprise the PRO-CTCAE item library. 
For this study, 23 symptomatic AEs summing to 38 items have been 
selected as presented below. Th ere are 10 symptomatic AEs which 
are assessed using one item, 11 symptomatic AEs which are 
assessed using two items, and 6 symptomatic AEs which are 
assessed using three items. The type s of items in order of prevalence 
include severity (n=18 symptoma tic AEs), interference (n=9 
symptomatic AEs), frequency (n=7  symptomatic AEs), present/not 
present (n=4 symptomatic AE), and amount (none). The anticipated time to complete should be approximately 10 minutes. Rev. Add3

Adherence Starts with Knowledge Scale  
The Adherence Starts with Knowledge Scale (ASK-12) will be used to 
assess the likelihood th at a patient is taking oral medications per 
protocol.43 The 12-item questionnaire was derived from the 
predecessor ASK-20 usin g a study population of 112 patients with 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
73 asthma, congestive heart failure or diabetes.42 In this study, the ASK-
12 had good internal consistency (Cronbach’s coefficient alpha=0.75), 
and test-retest reliability (intra class correlations (ICC)=0.79). The 
ASK-12 which elicits the same type of information as the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) al so demonstrated convergent 
validity through strong correlation with MMAS-4 (Spearman 
correlation r = 0.74; p < 0.001). The ASK- 12 titled ‘Taking Medicine -
What Gets in the Way?’ is segmented into three sections: 
inconvenience/forgetfulness (3 item s), treatment beliefs (4 items) and 
behavior (5 items). Response for each  item is on a 5-point Likert scale 
(1-5) with the total score ranging from 12-60 and a higher score representing less likelihood of me dication adherence. The anticipated 
time to complete is roughly 3-4 minutes. 
6.3.2 Patient-Reported Outc omes Assessment Schedule 
PRO time-points overlap with protocol-specified clinic visits. The NCI 
PRO-CTCAE will be assessed at bas eline and the beginning of each 
cycle on study therapy up to tw o-years. The FACT-G (PWB+FWB), 
Ntx and MM are first administered at  baseline prior to starting 
treatment for evaluation of change longitudinally. The FACT-G 
(PWB+FWB), Ntx and MM then will be administered every three cycles for the first 24 cy cles (beginning of cycles 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 
22 and 25) and every six cycles ther eafter up to completion of 48 
cycles (beginning of cycles 31, 37, 43, 49), and at treatment 
discontinuation prior to completing 48 cycles. During long-term follow-
up, there will be 4 quarterly assessments for one year. The ASK-12 
will be assessed every six cycles on treatment up to completion of 48 
cycles (beginning of cycles 7, 13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, and 49).

6.3.3 Patient-Reported Outcomes Additional Instructions 
All questionnaires will be administered  as a paper survey, with the aim 
that the patient completes question naires at the time of scheduled 
study clinic visits. 
The patient should be instructed to respond to the questionnaires in 
terms of his or her experience during  the timeframe specified on each 
questionnaire. 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
75 The patient should be asked to read the instructions at the beginning 
of each questionnaire and complete all the items. It is permissible to 
assist the patient with the question naires as long as the staff person 
does not influence the patient’s responses.  
The questionnaires must be reviewed by the protocol nurse or 
research coordinator as soon as the patient completes them to ensure 
all items were marked appropriately. If more than one answer was marked, the patient should be asked to choose the answer which best 
reflects how he or she is feeling.  If a question was not answered, the 
patient should be asked if he or she would like to answer it. The patient should always have the option to refuse. If the patient cannot complete a questionnaire, or if the patient refuses to complete a questionnaire, the reason should  be noted according to the 
instructions in the EAA171 Forms Completion Guidelines. 
If appointments on the scheduled date are missed, the questionnaires 
will be mailed electronically to participants who will be asked to 
complete the questionnaires  and return answers by electronic mail to 
the clinic. After 7 days, clinic or research staff may contact 
participants by telephone and ask participants to complete the 
questionnaire over the telephone re ading their answers to the staff 
person. This approach will approximate the completion of PROs in clinic as closely as possible. 
NOTE:  When delivering questionnaires to patients by electronic 
mail or over the telephone, please document the process 
of distribution and completion carefully and thoroughly in 
the medical record in case of an audit review. 
PRO-CTCAE items will be administered sometimes coincident with 
other study PRO measures following procedures for PRO administration as described abov e. PRO-CTCAE items will be 
administered prior to clinic  visits, or prior to participant’s discussion of 
disease status and treatment side effects with health-care professionals. This is model ed after NCI PRO-CTCAE study 
procedures employed in other cl inical trial validation studies. 
Clinicians will be instructed to co mplete clinician-rated treatment 
toxicities (CTCAE) prior to reviewing PRO-CTCAE ratings. This will 
minimize the extent to which PRO- CTCAE responses introduce a bias 
to clinician CTCAE ratings. PRO-CTCAE are currently undergoing validation and thus exploratory in nature, therefore, at this point should not be used to inform clinic ian CTCAE ratings. Clinicians will 
be instructed to review PRO-CTCA E items after clinician toxicity 
ratings have been completed to  identify any patient-reported 
symptoms and toxicities that warrant clinical attention. Supportive care measures to manage treatm ent toxicities are described in 
Section 5.6.

8.1.2 Classification 
Proteasome inhibitor 
8.1.3 Mode of Action 
Ixazomib/placebo is a reversib le proteasome inhibitor. 
Ixazomib/placebo preferentially binds and inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of the beta 5 sub unit of the 20S proteasome. It induced 
apoptosis of multiple myeloma cell lines in vitro. 
8.1.4 Storage and Stability 
Storage:  Store ixazomib/placebo capsules between 2º – 30ºC (36º – 
86ºF). Ixazomib/placebo should remain in the blister and carton provided until use. Do not freeze or store above 30°C. 
If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return 
ixazomib/placebo capsules to 2º – 30ºC (36º – 86ºF) and quarantine 
the supplies. Provide a detailed re port of the excursion (including 
documentation of temperature monitoring and duration of the excursion) to PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov  for determination of 
suitability. 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
80 Stability:  Stability studies are ongoing. 
8.1.5 Dose Specifics 
Ixazomib/placebo will be administered at a dose of 4 mg on days 1, 8, 
and 15 of each cycle. 
8.1.6 Preparation  
No specific preparation is required. NOTE:  Ixazomib/placebo is an antic ancer drug. As with other 
potentially toxic compounds, caution should be exercised 
when handling ixazomib/plac ebo. It is recommended to 
wear gloves and protective garments during preparation when dispensed in clinic. Pl ease refer to published 
guidelines regarding the proper handling and disposal of anticancer agents. 
8.1.7 Route of Administration 
Ixazomib/placebo will be administered orally. 
8.1.8 Method of Administration 
Take capsule(s) on an empty stomac h, 1 hour before or 2 hours after 
food. Swallow whole capsules with water. Do not open or break 
capsules. 
Missed or delayed dose can be taken only if the next scheduled dose 
is ≥ 72 hours away. A missed dose should not be taken within 72 
hours of the next scheduled dose . If vomiting occurs after taking a 
dose, the patient should not repeat  the dose. Resume dosing at the 
time of the next scheduled dose. 
8.1.9 Availability 
Clinical Supplies:  Ixazomib (NSC 767907) and matching placebo will 
be provided free of charge by Takeda and distributed by the 
Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB), Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), Divi sion of Cancer Treatment and 
Diagnosis (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI). 
Ixazomib and matching placebo will be supplied in blister cards 
containing 3 capsules each. 
Each blinded, patient-specific blister card will be labeled with: 
x the protocol number (i.e., “EAA171”)  
x the blister card number (i.e., “blister  card 1 of 2” or “blister card 2 
of 2”)  
x the number of capsules (i.e., “3 capsules ”) 
x the patient ID number (e.g.,"99999", which represents the unique 
patient identifier assigned at registration) 
x the patient initials (i.e., first initi al, middle, last initial [e.g., "FML"])

x a Julian date 
The Julian date indicates the day the bottle was labeled and shipped 
and is composed of the last two digits  of the calendar year (e.g., 2019 = 
19, 2020 = 20) and a day count (e.g., January 1 = 001, December 31 = 365). For example, a bottle labeled  and shipped on January 1, 2019 
would have a Julian date of ‘19001’ and a bottle labeled and shipped on 
December 31, 2019 would have a Julian date of ‘19365’. The Julian 
date will be used by PMB for reca lls. When a lot ex pires, PMB will 
determine the last date the expired lot was shipped and will recall all bottles (i.e., both Ixazomib and Placebo) shipped on or before that date thus eliminating any chanc e of breaking the blind.  The Julian Date – 
Order number (e.g., 21352-0003) fr om the patient-specific label 
must be used as the Lot number on the NCI Oral DARF.  
BLINDED AGENT ORDERS: No blinded starter supplies will be 
available for this study. 
Patients will be registered and rand omized through OPEN and assigned 
patient ID number. This number must recorded by the registering 
institution at the time of registration for proper clinical supply dispersion. 
Once a patient has been register ed, ECOG-ACRIN will electronically 
transmit a clinical drug request for that patient to the PMB. This request 
will be entered and tr ansmitted by ECOG-ACRIN the day the patient is 
registered and will be processed by  PMB the next business day and 
shipped the following business day. If a patient is registered on Monday, 
ECOG-ACRIN would enter a clinical drug request for that patient on 
Monday and PMB would process that request on Tuesday and ship the 
drug on Wednesday. Sites could expect to receive their order 
approximately Thursday or  Friday. Shipments to United States sites can 
be expedited (i.e., receipt on Thursday in example above) by the 
provision of an express courier a ccount name and number to ECOG-
ACRIN at the time the patient is registered/randomized. 
The initial patient-specific supply will  be enough to complete 8 weeks of 
treatment (2 x 3-capsule blister cards). The supplies will be sent to the registering investigator / drug ship ment investigator at the time of 
registration and should arrive with in 5 to 7 business days. Subsequent 
orders for blinded, patient-specific supplies must be requested by the Principal Investigator (or his/her au thorized designee[s]) for EAA171 at 
each participating institution using the PMB On-line Agent Order Processing (OAOP) program. The assi gned patient ID number (e.g., 
999999) and the patient initials (e.g ., "FML") should be entered in the 
"Patient or Special Code" field. A se parate order is re quired for each 
patient ID number (e.g.,  999999) being ordered. All drug orders should Rev. Add3 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
82 be shipped directly to the physician responsible for treating the patient. 
Requests can be placed 6 weeks after the last shipment is received. 
DOSE ADJUSTMENTS: Starter supplies for dose reductions will 
not be provided.  If the patient is dose reduced from the original 4 mg or 
placebo dose, an agent request must be submitted by the site through 
the OAOP application. Ixazomib /placebo 3 mg and 2.3 mg dose 
adjustments will be orde red through OAOP only at  the time of the dose 
reduction. The patient-specific blister cards of the dose adjusted 
supplies will be enough to complete 8 weeks of treatment (2 x 3-capsule 
blister cards). Requests for addi tional supplies can be placed 6 weeks 
after the last shipment is received. 
Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) policy requires that agent 
be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be treated. 
The CTEP-assigned protocol number an d patient ID must be used for 
ordering all CTEP-supplied investig ational agents for this study. The 
responsible investigator must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through 
an annual submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), NCI BioSketch, Agent Shipment Form  (ASF), and Financial Disclosure 
Form (FDF). 
Active CTEP-registered investigat ors and investigator-designated 
shipping designees and ordering desi gnees must submit agent requests 
through the PMB Online Agent Order Processing (OAOP) application. 
Access to OAOP requires the establ ishment of a CTEP Identity and 
Access Management (IAM) account and the maintenance of an “active” 
account st atus and a “current” password. For questions about drug 
orders, transfers, return s, or accountability, ca ll or email PMB at any 
time. Refer to the PMB's website for specific policies and guidelines 
related to agent  management. 
Transfer of Ixazomib/Placebo:  Ixazomib/placebo may not be 
transferred from one patient to anothe r patient or from one protocol to 
another protocol. PMB does not perm it the transfer of agents between 
institutions (unless prior approval from PMB is obtained). Ixazomib/placebo supplied for this study may not be used outside the 
scope of this protocol. To obtain an  approval for transfer, investigators 
should complete and submit to the PMB ( PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov ) 
a Transfer Investigational Agent Fo rm available on the NCI home page 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ) or call the PMB at  240-276-6575. The 
participating institution should also  inform the ECOG-ACRIN of the 
transfer by transferring the patient in TUMS. 
Return of Ixazomib/Placebo:  At the completion of accrual and 
treatment, all unused (unopened) blister packs of ixazomib/placebo 
must be returned to the PMB.  When it is necessary to return study drug 
(e.g., unused blister packs remainin g when the protocol is closed to 
accrual and treatment at a participating clinical site, unopened expired blister packs, or supplies remaining af ter a patient goes off of protocol 
treatment), investigators should return the ixazomib/placebo to the PMB 
using the NCI Return Agent Form available on the NCI home page 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ).

83 Supplies remaining from dispensed bl ister cards should be documented 
on the patient-specific NCI Investigational Agent Accountability Record 
Form for Oral Agents. On the correct dispensing row, document the date 
returned and the quantity, then destroy on site in accordance with institutional policy. 
Agent Inventory Records:  The investigator, or a responsible party 
designated by the investigator, must maintain a careful record of the receipt, dispensing and final disposition of all agents received from the 
PMB using the appropriate NCI Investigational Agent (Drug) 
Accountability Record (DARF) availa ble on the CTEP forms page. Store 
and maintain separate NCI Investigat ional Agent Accountability Records 
for each patient, agent, strength, form ulation and ordering investigator 
on this protocol. Please note that the Julian Date – Order number 
(e.g., 21352-0003) from the patient- specific label must be used as 
the Lot number on the NCI Oral DARF. 
Questions about drug orders, transf ers, returns, or accountability 
should be addressed to the PMB by calling (240) 276-6575 Monday 
through Friday between 8:30am and 4:30pm Eastern Time. You may 
also contact the PMB via e-mail at PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov . 
8.1.10 Side Effects  
See Section 5.4.1  for the Comprehensive Adverse Event and 
Potential Risks (CAEPR) list.  
8.1.11 Potential Drug Interactions 
Ixazomib/placebo is metabolized by  CYP3A4 (42.3%), 1A2 (26.1%), 
2B6 (16%), 2C8 (6%), 2D6 (4.8%), 2C19 (4.8%), and 2C9 (<1%). Co-
administration of ixazomib/placebo with clarithromycin did not result in 
a clinically significant change  in the systemic exposure of 
ixazomib/placebo. Co-administrat ion of ixazomib/placebo with 
rifampin decreased ixazomib/pla cebo Cmax by 54% and AUC by 
74%. Therefore, avoid concomitant administration of ixazomib/placebo 
with strong CYP3A4 inducers (such as rifampin, phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, and St. John’s Wort) .  
Ixazomib/placebo is neither a time-dependent nor a reversible inhibitor 
of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4/5. Ixazomib/placebo did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4/5 activity or 
corresponding immunoreactive protein levels. Ixazomib/placebo is not 
expected to produce drug-drug inte ractions via CYP inhibition or 
induction. 
Ixazomib/placebo is a low affinity su bstrate of P-gp. Ixazomib/placebo 
is not a substrate of BCRP, MRP2 or hepatic OATPs. 
Ixazomib/placebo is not an in hibitor of P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, or MATE2-K. Hence, ixazomib/placebo is not ex pected to cause transporter-
mediated drug-drug interactions. 
8.1.12 Patient Implications 
There are no human data available regarding the potential effect of 
ixazomib/placebo on pregnancy or de velopment of the embryo or Rev. Add3 
Rev. Add3

84 fetus. Based on clinical data, ixazomib/placebo caused embryo-fetal 
toxicity in pregnant rats and rabb its at doses resulting in exposures 
that were slightly higher than those observed in patients receiving the 
recommended dose. Patients should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with ixazomib/placebo. Patients of childbearing potential and patients who are sexually active with a partner of childbearing 
potential must use effective contracept ive measures during and for 90 
days following treatment. 
It is not known whether ixazomib/p lacebo or its metabolites are 
present in human milk. Many drugs are present in human milk and as a result, there could be a potenti al for adverse events in nursing 
infants. Patients should discont inue nursing while receiving 
ixazomib/placebo.

Immunomodulatory Agent 
8.2.3 Mode of Action 
Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analog, is an immunomodulatory agent 
with a spectrum of activity that is still under investigation. Some of its 
effects include inhibition of inflamma tion, inhibition of angiogenesis, 
inhibition of hematopoetic tumor cell proliferation, modulation of stem 
cell differentiation and upregulation of T cell and NK cell responses. 
8.2.4 Storage and Stability 
Storage:  Store capsules at room temperature (25°C). Excursions are 
permitted (to 15-30°C). 
Stability:  Refer to the package labeling for expiration date. 
8.2.5 Dose Specifics 
Lenalidomide will be administered at a dose of 10 mg on days 1-28. 
8.2.6 Preparation 
No preparation is required. Only a one cycle (28- day) supply may be dispensed at one time. 
8.2.7 Route of Administration 
Take lenalidomide by mouth with or without food. Do not crush, chew

Periodic monitoring of digoxin levels is recommended during 
coadministration with lenalidomide. 
Monitor patients receiving concomitant  warfarin per standard practice 
guidelines. 
Lenalidomide is not a substrate of human CYP enzymes, nor is it an 
inhibitor or inducer. 
8.2.11 Nursing/Patient Implications 
Risks Associated with Pregnancy 
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a 
known human teratogenic active subs tance that causes severe life-
threatening birth defects. An embryofetal development study in animals indicates that lenalidomide  produced malformations in the 
offspring of female monkeys who rece ived the drug during pregnancy. 
The teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans cannot be ruled out. 
Therefore, a risk minimization plan to prevent pregnancy must be 
observed. 
Definition of patient of childbearing potential A patient of childbearing potential is anyone, regardless of sexual 
orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets 
the following criteria: 1) has achiev ed menarche at some point, 2) has 
not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or 3) has 
not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i .e., has had menses at any time in the 
preceding 24 consecutive months). 
Before starting study drug: 
Patients of Childbearing Potential: 
x Patients of childbearing pot ential must have two negative 
pregnancy tests (minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL) prior to Rev. Add3 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
86 starting study drug. The first pre gnancy test must be performed 
within 10 to 14 days prior to the st art of study drug and the second 
pregnancy test must be performe d within 24 hours prior to the 
start of study drug. The patient may not receive study drug until the Investigator has verified that  the results of these pregnancy 
tests are negative. 
Male Patients: 
x Must agree to use a latex co ndom during sexual contact with 
partners of childbearing potential while participating in the study and for at least 28 days following discontinuation from the study 
even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. 
All Patients: 
x Only enough lenalidomide for one cycle of therapy may be 
dispensed with each cycle of therapy.  
x If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study 
patient or the partner of a male pat ient during study participation, 
lenalidomide must be immediately discontinued.

9.1 Study Design 
This is a randomized phase III study with the primary aim to evaluate whether 
intensifying maintenance therapy based on MRD positive status after 
approximately 1 year post ear ly stem cell transplant lenalidomide maintenance 
results in prolonged overall survival (OS).  OS will be compared between patients 
with MRD positive status (n=510) ra ndomized to either ixazomib-lenalidomide

89 9.3 Statistical Analysis Plan 
9.3.1 Primary Clinical Analysis 
The primary analysis will be on an intention to treat (ITT) basis 
considering the randomized treatme nt assignment irrespective of 
treatment received. OS will be es timated using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) 
method and compared using a stratified log-rank test. Stratified cox 
proportional hazards regression will  produce a treatment hazard ratio 
(HR) estimate (ixazomib-lenalidomide /placebo-lenalidomide). Interim 
analyses for efficacy will be conduc ted. The design incorporates a 
group sequential monitoring plan with  6 interim analyses (IA) and one 
final analysis for the OS comparison between arms. Based on accrual and failure rate assumptions in the sample size calculation (Section 9.4), interim analyses are expected to  occur from 3y to 5.5y after 
randomization and the final analysis at  full information (179 deaths) is 
expected to occur after 6y of follow -up. Critical values as presented 
below in Table 1 are based on the Lan-DeMets error spending rate 
function corresponding to th e truncated version of O’Brien -Fleming 
boundaries to preserve the overall type I error rate. At each interim 
analysis, the null hypothesis of equal OS on the two arms will be 
tested against the 1-sided alternative of increased OS on the ixazomib-lenalidomide arm. The p-va lue from a 1-sided stratified log-
rank test will be compared to th e level of nominal significance 
associated with these critical values . If the boundary is crossed at an 
IA, there is sufficient evidence of efficacy to stop the study in favor of 
the alternative hypothesis. The DSMC  then would consider stopping 
the study early.

7 6.0 100% 179 2.0858 0.0185 
Coupled with the interim analysis for early stopping for superiority of 
ixazomib-lenalidomide (Arm A), the st udy will be monitored for harm 
and inefficacy. At 35% information, the DSMC may consider stopping the study early for harm if the lower bound of a 95% confidence interval for the HR is above 1.0.  Interim inefficacy monitoring is 
planned to start after approximately 47% of full information becomes 
available with repeated analysis at each semi-annual DSMC meeting. 
The Linear 20% Inefficacy Boundary (LIB20), an approach described 
by Freidlin et al, will be used.
71 The study may be stopped if there is 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
90 not at least a small trend in favor of the alternative hypothesis starting 
at this time. Specifically, at each interim analysis, if the estimated HR 
is larger than the cutoff value give n in the LIB20 boundary (Table 2), 
the DSMC then would consider stoppin g the study early for lack of 
efficacy.

9.3.2 Secondary Clinical Analyses 
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) 
An important secondary aim is to evaluate whether a response-
adapted strategy translates into superior progression-free survival for patients switching to more-intensive treatment. PFS will be estimated using the KM method and compared us ing the stratified log-rank test. 
Median PFS on the control arm is a ssumed to be 18 months based on 
results from recent clinical trials. Assuming exponential distribution of 
failures, this study is design to detect a 44% increase in median PFS 
to 26 months on the experiment al arm. This corresponds to a 
treatment HR approximating 0.70 [monthly hazard rate 0.0385 versus 0.0267]. At 1-sided 2.5% type I error, there is approximately 90% 
power using a log-rank test to de tect this HR given 510 patients 
uniformly accrued over 3.5y with full information of 319 PFS events at 4.5y (accrual end plus one year). The actual timing of this PFS analysis will depend on accrual. The analysis will not be done before 
one year after the last patient is randomized.
 No interim analyses for 
the PFS comparison will be conducted. The study team will also not 
consider or declare the experiment al arm to be a success based on 
the PFS endpoint alone. 
Response 
Response will be tabulated by cate gory. Response rates (sCR, CR, 
VGPR) will be compared using the chi-squared test for proportions. It 
is hypothesized that the ixazomib- lenalidomide arm will have higher 
response rates. Ineligible patients are excluded from the analysis and 
unevaluable patients are counted in  the denominator. Sensitivity 
analyses will exclude unevaluable pa tients from the rate calculations. 
Given 255 patients per arm, there is over 90% to detect a difference 
of 15% in VGPR rates at 1-sided 2. 5% significance assuming a 52.5% 
overall VGPR rate. 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
91 Toxicity 
We will monitor the toxicities ex perienced by all treated patients. 
Interim analyses of toxicity are pe rformed twice yearly for all ECOG-
ACRIN studies. Expedited reporting of certain adverse events is required, as described in Section 5.3. We are specifically interested in 
comparing the rates of worst grade 3 or higher non-hematologic 
treatment-related events using the ch i-squared test for proportions. It 
is likely that the ixazomib-lenalido mide arm will have moderately 
higher toxicity rates than the plac ebo-lenalidomide arm. The grade 3 
or higher treatment-related non-hematologic rate on the placebo-lenalidomide arm is estimated to be around 36% based on reported 
toxicity rates on the lenalidomide arm of the CALGB maintenance trial. Assuming 1-sided 2.5% sign ificance, there is 84% power to 
detect a difference in grade 3 or higher treatment-related non-
hematologic rates of 13% (ixazomib-lenalidomide arm 49% rate) with all enrolled patients treated. The maximum width of a 95% CI for a rate of a given toxicity on either treatment arm is 13%. As exploratory, global grade 3 or higher treatment-related non-hematologic rates will 
be evaluated within age subgroups di chotomized at 65 years. We also 
plan to examine comprehensively adverse events experienced by study participants using the Tox- T method which has been validated 
as a tool to assess adverse events in other NCTN trials.
46 
9.3.3 Exploratory Clinical Endpoints 
Time to Progression and Duration of Response 
TTP and DOR in each arm will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. 
Treatment Exposure 
Treatment exposure to the oral medications lenalidomide and 
ixazomib will be quantified using patient medication calendars. 
Cumulative dose, dose intensity, and relative dose intensity will be 
calculated overall and by cycle. Dat a will be summarized by treatment 
arm with descriptive statistics and graphically over time. Treatment 
duration in each arm will be es timated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. Patients will be classified  into dichotomous groups based on 
a 75% relative dose intensity cutoff (< 75% vs ≥ 75% represents poor 
vs good treatment adherence). The proportion of patients with poor 
lenalidomide treatment adherence will be compared between arms 
using the chi-squared test for propor tions. In addition, multivariable 
logistic regression analysis will be conducted to identify the baseline 
factors associated with calculated good treatment adherence. We will 
conduct one interim anal ysis to monitor treatment adherence to 
ixazomib. Specifically, the treatment adherence rate at 18 months will 
be measured by ixazomib relative do se intensity at or exceeding 75% 
(“good” treatment adherence). This anal ysis is expected to occur at 
2.5 years from randomization when 72 patients (29% of target 
accrual) have reached potentially 18  months of assigned ixazomib 
therapy. If the treatment adherence rate is at least 80% we would 
consider this acceptable while a tr eatment adherence rate of 65% is 
considered evidence that adherence to ixazomib is unacceptable. If Rev. Add3 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
92 54 or more patients achieve targ et treatment adherence exceeding 
75% over 18 months, then the study will continue. If the true treatment 
adherence rate is 65%, the prob ability of concluding treatment 
adherence is acceptable is 0.05 (type I error). If the true treatment adherence rate is 80%, the prob ability of concluding treatment 
adherence is acceptable is 0.88 (power). 
9.3.4 Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) Endpoints 
PRO compliance and completion rates will be tabulated at each 
collection time point and overall se parately for the FACT-G (FWB and 
PWB subscales), FACT-Ntx, FACT-MM, ASK-12 and PRO-CTCAE instruments. 
Health-Related Quality of Life (QOL) 
To assess the impact of treatment  and disease on health-related 
QOL, there are two co-primary endpoints: change in FACT/GOG-Ntx 
TOI from baseline to end of cycle 12 post-randomization (beginning of cycle 13 assessment) and change in  FACT-MM TOI from baseline to 
end of cycle 24 (beginning of cycle 25 assessment) post randomization. The FACT-G (FWB and PWB subscales), Ntx and MM 
will be administered at the beginning (day 1)of every 3 cycles for the 
first 24 cycles (beginning of cycles 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22 and 25) and 
every 6 cycles thereafter (up to com pletion of 48 cycles of therapy 
(beginning of cycles 31, 37, 43 , and 49), or at treatment 
discontinuation prior to completion of 48 cycles of therapy. During long-term follow-up/post-treatment end, there will be four quarterly 
assessments for 1 year. We hypoth esize that treatment with ixazomib 
will not result in a significant difference in the FACT/GOG-Ntx TOI 
over the first 12 cycles and that improved PFS will result in higher 
FACT-MM TOI scores by end of 24 cycles. All patients who receive at 
least one dose of study drug and  complete the QOL assessment at 
both time points are eligible. Power calculations are based on t-tests 
comparing the two treatment arms for the change in score with a 2-
sided 0.05 alpha split between these comparisons. In an unselected group of MM patients being treated with oral therapy (n=118), the FACT-MM TOI had a standard deviation (SD) of approximately 21 points. The FACT-Ntx TOI has a reported SD of 14-16.
70 We propose 
using a general effect size measure of half standard deviation to 
establish the minimally important difference (MID).47,69 We therefore 
will establish a MID of 10 for the FACT-MM TOI and 8 for the FACT-Ntx TOI. We assume 90% and 81% of pa tients are alive by year 1 and 
2, respectively, as well as a 10% dr op-out rate resulting in potential 
patients of n=414 and n=373 for each analysis. Sensitivity for the 
proportion assumed to submit the questionnaire at both time points (compliance rates of 60% and 80 %), allowing for a range of 
instrument variability and assuming different correlation (0.6, 0.4) 
between repeated measures was perfo rmed (Table 3). The difference 
in the FACT-Ntx TOI mean change score  over 12 cycles of treatment 
between the ixazomib-lenalidomide arm and the placebo-lenalidomide 
arm that can be detected with 80% power at 2-sided 0.025 
significance level ranges from 3.7-6.9 points as shown below. The 
difference in the FACT-MM TOI mean change score over 24 cycles of 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
93 treatment between the ixa-lenalidomide arm and the placebo-
lenalidomide arm that can be detec ted with 80% power at 2-sided 
0.025 significance level ranges from 5.8-10.0 points. All of the 
scenarios show the target MID for each comparison or smaller can be detected with satisfactory power and thus we will be able to show a 
significant difference in  QOL if it occurs.

Sensitivity analysis will be cond ucted to retain patients who 
discontinued treatment early and mi ssing their FACT-Ntx TOI score 
after 12 cycles of treatment (b eginning of cycle 13 assessment) using 
their QOL score at early treatment discontinuation for the analysis. For the FACT-MM TOI analysis a fter 24 cycles of treatment 
(beginning of cycle 25 assessme nt) the long-term follow-up 
assessment closest to 2 years from randomization will be used if 
patients are not on treatment. Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, 
median, range) will be used to eval uate the distribution of levels and 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
94 changes for the set of health-related QOL evaluations including the 
FACT/GOG-Ntx TOI, FACT-MM TOI and FACT-G (FWB and PWB 
subscales). Levels and ch anges will also be assessed graphically. 
Linear mixed effects models will be used to perform repeated 
measured regression analysis with the assumed covariance matrix maximizing Akaike information criteria. Models with treatment, 
assessment time, and treatment by  assessment time interaction with 
and without other predictors will be fit. If there is substantial 
missingness, we will analyze th e data according to the methods 
described in Schluchter and Schluc hter, Greene and Beck. These 
methods consider missingness in formative by jointly modeling 
longitudinal QOL score and survival time to dropout. 
There are two key secondary health-related QOL analysis comparing 
treatment arms: Time to worseni ng of the FACT/GOG-Ntx TOI and 
time to improvement of the FACT-MM TOI. Time to worsening of the FACT/GOG-Ntx TOI and time to improvement of the FACT-MM TOI will be analyzed with the KM method and compared using the log-rank test. We will establish significance as alpha=1.67% based on 
Bonferroni adjustment (5% divide d over 3 comparisons). We will 
provide rates on each arm includi ng exact binomical 95% confidence 
intervals for the FACT/GOG-Ntx TOI  recovery rate and FACT-MM TOI 
response rate. 
As exploratory, correlation between time to worsening of symptoms 
with PFS and OS will be assessed with Kendall’s Tau adjusted for 
censored observations. 
Finally, we will eval uate whether patients with poor treatment 
adherence based on medication calendars and lower likelihood of 
medication adherence based on ASK -12 scores have lower QOL 
scores [the FACT/GOG-Ntx TOI, FACT-MM TOI and FACT-G (FWB 
and PWB subscales)] after 12- and 24-cycles of treatment. Linear 
regression analysis at these 2 ti me points separately will be 
conducted with QOL score as outcome and treatment adherence group as the main effect adjustin g for baseline QOL score along with 
other disease and demographic characteristics. 
PRO-CTCAE 
Analyses related to the PRO-CT CAE are exploratory. Descriptive 
statistics will be used to summar ize selected PRO-CTCAEs tabulated 
at each cycle overall and by arm. We will map PRO-CTCAEs with provider reported AEs and evaluat e differences in incidence and worst 
severity. PRO-CTCAE ratings will furt her be evaluated in relation to 
patient bother by treatment side effects (FACT- GP5 item, “I am 
bothered by treatment side effects”) to  identify the toxicities that are 
most highly associated with tr eatment tolerability issues. 
Medication Adherence Scale 
Analyses related to the ASK-12 are ex ploratory. Descriptive statistics 
will be used to summarize ASK-12 sc ores tabulated every 6 cycles on 
study therapy. The ASK-12 is repo rted to have a mean (standard 
deviation) of 27.5 (7.2). Differences between arms will be evaluated Rev. Add3 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
95 based on the t-test (or Wilcoxon rank su m test). Patients will also be 
classified into high versus lo w likelihood of medication adherence 
groups according to tertile distribu tions (lowest tertile vs second and 
top). The relationship between likeli hood of medication adherence and 
calculated treatment adherence dic hotomous groups will be evaluated 
in 2x2 tables. In addition, multivar iable logistic regression analysis will 
be conducted to identi fy the baseline factors associated with low 
likelihood of medication adherence  over 12- and 24-cycles of 
treatment. 
9.4 Sample Size Considerations 
OS will be estimated based on the KM method and compared between arms 
using the stratified log-rank test. All su rvival estimates are from randomization, 
which would be ~18 months from start of  initial therapy. Median OS for the 
control arm was estimated to be 5.5 year s (y) considering expe ctations in this 
setting for an unselected cohort as well as  results from the previously mentioned 
meta-analysis according to post-treatment MRD status.3 Based on the log-rank 
test, there is approximately 80% power at 1-sided 2.5% significance to detect a difference in 4y OS from 60.4% to  72.2% reflecting an approximate 35% 
reduction in hazard [treatment HR=0.65 ] assuming 510 patients uniformly 
accrued over 3.5y and 179 deaths  at full information (6y). 
9.5 Projected Accrual 
This study aims to screen 840 patients to pre-registration Step 0 at an accrual 
rate of 20 patients per month/240 patients  per year for an accrual duration of 
3.5y. With an allowance of 15% for patien ts not yielding high quality specimens 
for MRD analysis, it is expected that 714 patients will have MRD measured. MRD 
status is anticipated to be split 75% pos itive/25% negative resulting in 536 MRD 
positive patients and 178 MRD negative pati ents. Some drop-out (5%) between 
marker evaluation and enrollment  to Step 1 treatment is also anticipated resulting 
in an estimated 510 patients randomiz ed to Arm A or Arm B with 1:1 allocation. 
Patients with MRD negative disease status  based on NGF and immunofixation 
results will not be registered to the treatment phase. 
9.6 Randomization Scheme 
Patients are randomized in equal allo cation to ixazomib-lenalidomide or placebo-
lenalidomide and stratified by molecular ri sk status by International Myeloma 
Working Group (IMWG) criteria: standard  or high risk, prior lenalidomide 
maintenance dose: 5 mg,10 mg, or >10 mg, prior maintenance duration: < 12 
months or > 12 months. Treatment will  be assigned using permuted blocks within 
strata with dynamic balancing by main ECOG-ACRIN institution.33 
9.7 Gender and Ethnicity 
Based on observed data from E1A11 the anticipated accrual in subgroups 
defined by gender and race is expected to parallel the newly diagnosed setting 
as follows: Rev. Add1

The accrual targets in indiv idual cells are not large enough for definitive

accrual to the study will not be ext ended to meet individual subgroup accrual 
targets. 
Study Monitoring 
This study will be monitored by th e ECOG-ACRIN Data Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC). The DSMC meets twic e each year. For each meeting, all 
monitored studies are reviewed for safety  and progress toward completion. When 
appropriate, the DSMC will also review int erim analyses of outcome data. Copies 
of the toxicity reports prepared for the DS MC meetings are included in the study

100 11. Laboratory Research Studies 
These analyses will be performed at the Hematology Laboratory at Mayo Clinic 
Rochester, MN under the dire ction of Dr. Shaji Kumar . 
11.1 Assessment of Minimal Residual Disease  
11.1.1 MRD – Next Generation Flow Cytometry Methods 
Next generation flow cytometry (NGF) MRD assessment is conducted 
with multiparameter flowcytometry. The reagents for the MRD assessment will utilize the MM  MRD kit (cytognos # MM-MRD, 
Salamanca). Analysis will follow th e Euroflow approach using Infinicyt 
software as outlined by Flores-Montero et al.
 22 The methodology has 
been described before and will be used without additional modification. Briefly, it utilizes an 8-color flow approach using two 
tubes, one with cytoplasmic light chains assessment on permeabilized 
cells. Four milliliters (ml) BM aspirate  will be lysed using a fixative free 
erythrocyte lysing solution (# CYT-BL (10X), Cytognos, Salamanca, Spain). Per manufacturers guidelines , up to two ml of marrow will be 
suspended in 50 ml of freshly made 1X lyse and gently mixed for 15 minutes. After centrifugation, the supe rnant is aspirated and the pellet 
resuspended in 2 ml of Staining Buffer (SB - PBS /0.09% Azide /0.5% 
BSA). The tube is then filled to 50 ml with staining buffer and 
centrifuged. Two ml of SB are used to resuspend one pellet and combined with the pellet in the se cond tube. The cell suspension is 
transferred to a 12 X 75 tube. Afte r centrifugation, the supernant is 
aspirated and the pellet is resuspended in 0.5 ml of SB. The 
suspension is diluted with SB not to exceed 10
7 per ml. Up to 10 
million cells are added to tube 1 and tube 2. Both tubes are stained for 
30 minutes at room temperature, in  the dark with multi epitope CD38 
FITC/CD138 V450/CD45 Percp 5.5 /CD19 PE-Cy7 in both tubes for 
plasma cell (PC) gating. To determine PC phenotype both tube 1 and 
2 contain CD27-BV510 and CD56-PE;  tube 1 also includes CD117 
APC and CD81 APC C750. After incu bation, tube 1 is resuspended 
for 10 minutes in BD FACs Lyse. Th e pellet is resuspended in 0.5 ml 
SB and held until run on the flow cytometer. Tube 2 is further processed for cytoplasmic light chain staining (Kappa APC /Lambda 
APC-C750) with a fix and perm step. After centrifugation, the pellet is 
resuspended in 0.5 ml SB and held un til run on the flow cytometer. 
The bone marrow quality will be determined by assessing for expected normal marrow cells. Normal and neoplastic plasma cells will be reported as percentage of all CD38/138/45 gated cells. The report will include the total number of cells analyzed, PC 
immunophenotype (including clonality),  and plasma cell (normal and 
abnormal) percentages and event (abnormal plasma cell) count to determine MRD negative or positive status.

102 12. Imaging Correlative Studies 
12.1 18Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT 
Advanced imaging modalities are playing an increasingly important role in the 
diagnosis, risk stratification and response assessment of myeloma. 18F-FDG 
PET/CT allows simultaneous assessment of the bone marrow, as well as 
presence of extramedullary lesions. Both  baseline assessments as well as follow 
up imaging have an important prognostic ro le and appear to be associated with 
survival. Myeloma ce lls, while they tend to be pr imarily marrow based, can be 
found in the extramedullary compartmen t, including the peripheral blood. As a 
result, imaging plays an important role in assessing response to  therapy, as well 
as in identifying disease progression, both inside and outside the bone marrow. 
In fact, functional imaging assessment using 18F-FDG PET/CT is an integral part 
of minimal residual disease assessment in myeloma, in addition to following foci 
of extramedullary disease identified prior to start of treatment. 
12.1.1 Imaging Schedule 
All registered patients from both the ixazomib/lenalidomide arm and 
the placebo/lenalidomide arm are expected to undergo 18F-FDG 
PET/CT as SOC at the following time points: 
x Prior to initiation of randomized  study mandated therapy [referred 
to as the baseline scan]. The baseline scan can be done prior to 
study registration, as long as it is within 8 weeks of pre-registration 
step 0 
x After completion of 12 cycles of study mandated therapy (± 6 
weeks) [referred to as the year 1 scan] 
x After completion of 24 cycles of study mandated therapy (± 6 
weeks) [referred to as the year 2 scan] 
All 18F-FDG PET/CT images are to be submitted via TRIAD as 
outlined in Section 4.3.5 . 
12.1.2 Criteria for defining abnormal 18F-FDG PET/CT 
The primary 18F-FDG PET/CT reading will be performed using IMWG 
PET criteria, where a negative PET is described as disappearance of 
every area of increased tracer uptake found at disease sites on the baseline 
18F-FDG PET/CT, or a preceding 18F-FDG PET/CT, or 
decrease to less than that seen  in mediastinal blood pool SUV.4 
However, other criteria including IM PETUS and IMAJEM trial criteria 
will also be applied as exploratory a nalyses to determine if a better 
reading scheme can be established with respect to accuracy in the 
prediction of patient outcome.29,45 
12.1.3 Imaging Aims and Statistics 
There are three imaging aims in this correlative study, which will be 
based on central review of the acquired 18F-FDG PET/CT scans, and 
which are distinguished into primary and secondary. 
Imaging aims which involve patient outcomes (overall survival or 
progression-free survival) will be conducted at full information. In Rev. Add3 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
103 addition, reporting of imaging aims will not be done prior to reporting 
of the respective primary or secondary therapy endpoints. 
12.1.3.1 Primary imaging aim 
[1] To evaluate the association between baseline 18F-
FDG PET/CT and patient outcomes. 
The primary imaging aim consists of evaluating the 
association between baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT and patient 
outcomes, and seeks to address the question of whether 
abnormal 18F-FDG PET/CT findings at baseline (i.e., after 
approximately 1 year of lenalidomide maintenance following an early stem cell transplant) are prognostic of poorer progression-free surviv al (PFS) and overall survival 
(OS). The potential association will be analyzed using both 
quantitative and qualitative 
18F-FDG PET/CT parameters. 
Quantitatively, the association between baseline SUV-
based quantitative 18F-FDG PET/CT parameters (SUVmax, 
SUVpeak, MTV, TLG) and PFS will be analyzed through Cox regression. PFS will be defined as the time from 
randomization until the earlier  of progression or death due 
to any cause. SUV-based quantitative 
18F-FDG PET/CT 
(qPET) parameters will be analyzed as continuous covariates, and adjustment wi ll be made for potential 
confounders, including patien t age and the randomization 
stratification factors. In ad dition, we will formally test 
whether this association diffe rs by study arm through a 
statistical interaction term between the qPET parameter 
and study arm. If this interaction is not significant at the 
0.05 level, then a single overall hazard ratio will be estimated for the entire stud y cohort. We assume that up 
to 10% of patients may not receive the 
18F-FDG PET/CT at 
baseline or may have an uninterpretable scan. Standardizing each qPET parameter to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1, and assuming the R-square of each qPET parameter with other covariates is no more than 0.4, the proposed sample size of 510 patients (459 evaluable) 
has power of 82% to detect a hazard ratio as low as 1.25 
per standard deviation increase in the qPET parameter, when the progression event rate is 0.6. If the observed progression event rate over th e duration of the trial is 
higher than 0.6, the power will correspondingly increase 
(e.g., power=85% for a progression event rate of 0.65). A 
two-sided Cox regression with a type I error rate of 0.05 
was used for this computatio n (PASS 16). In addition, for 
further clinical utility, we will explore estimating an optimal 
threshold for each baselin e qPET parameter using 
recursive partitioning in a conditional inference framework, 
with 95% confidence interval derived using the bootstrap 
technique.
50 Finally, since a marker displaying an 
independent, strong association may not necessarily 
contribute meaningfully to impr oved classification, we will Rev. Add3 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
104 also examine the ability of each baseline qPET parameter 
to serve as a prognostic marker in discriminating patients 
which progress within 2 years and 3 years of the start of 
study mandated therapy using time-dependent (cumulative sensitivity/dynamic specificity) ROC analysis.
51,52 Area 
under the time-dependent ROC curve [AUC(t)] will be 
estimated using the NNE method proposed by 
Heagerty.53,54 
Qualitative criteria are descr ibed in protocol Section 12.1.2 . 
These criteria will be used to dichotomize the baseline 18F-
FDG PET/CT scans as either negative or positive, where analyses using the IMPETUS and IMAJEM criteria are considered exploratory. The association between a 
positive/abnormal baseline 
18F-FDG PET/CT scan and 
PFS will be assessed through Kaplan-Meier curves with the log-rank test. An adjusted analysis will also be conducted using a Cox regres sion model, with adjustment 
for potential confounders, including patient age and the 
randomization stratification fa ctors. In addition, we will 
formally test whether this asso ciation differs by study arm 
through a statistical interaction term between 
18F-FDG 
PET/CT positivity and study arm.  If this interaction is not 
significant at the 0.5 level, then a single overall hazard ratio will be estimated for th e entire study cohort. It is 
anticipated that between 50-70% of patients will have a 
positive 
18F-FDG PET/CT scan at baseline. Assuming 60% 
of patients have a positive 18F-FDG PET/CT scan at 
baseline, the proposed sample size of 510 patients (459 
evaluable) yields 87% power at a type I error rate of 0.05 
to detect a difference in median PFS between 18F-FDG 
PET/CT-positive and 18F-FDG PET/CT-negative patients 
as low as 7 months (19 vs . 26 months, respectively, 
assuming 3 years of accrual time and 4.5 years of patient follow-up; PASS 16). 
Similar analyses will be conducted for the OS outcome. OS 
will be defined as the time from randomization until death 
or the date last known alive. 
The 
18F-FDG PET/CT images will be collected centrally 
and archived for future research analysis. All data and results will be anonymized. 
12.1.3.2 Secondary imaging aims 
[2] To compare overall survival (OS) with the addition 
of ixazomib to lenalidomide among baseline 
18F-FDG 
PET/CT-positive and 18F-FDG PET/CT-negative 
subgroups. 
This secondary imaging aim consists of a subgroup 
analysis of the trial primary en dpoint, and will assess for 
heterogeneity of treatm ent effect by baseline 18F-FDG 
PET/CT status. If such heterogeneity is detected, this 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
105 would suggest that the effectiven ess of ixazomib treatment 
could be increased by targeting patients with the 
appropriate baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT status.55 
Heterogeneity of treatment effe ct will be assessed at full 
information, using a two-sided st atistical test for interaction 
between study arm (ixazomib/lenalidomide vs. 
placebo/lenalidomide) and baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT 
status (positive/abnormal vs. negative) in a Cox regression 
model.56,57 If the statistical test for interaction is not 
significant at the 0.05 level, we will conclude that there is 
not sufficient evidence for het erogeneity of treatment 
effect; if the statistical test for interaction is significant, 
estimated treatment hazard ratios for OS (ixazomib arm vs. 
placebo arm) will be reported  separately for baseline 18F-
FDG PET/CT-positive and 18F-FDG PET/CT-negative 
subgroups, along with the co rresponding 95% confidence 
intervals. OS will be defined as the time from randomization until death or  the date last known alive. 
We anticipate between 50-70% of patients will have a 
positive 
18F-FDG PET/CT scan at baseline. Sensitivity of 
the findings will be examined by adjusting the Cox model 
for patient age and the randomization stratification factors. 
[3] To compare the change in quantitative 18F-FDG 
PET/CT parameters over time with the addition of 
ixazomib to lenalidomide. 
This secondary imaging aim consists of comparing the 
change in 18F-FDG PET/CT parameters over time across 
study arms and seeks to address the question of whether adding ixazomib to lenalidomide results in sharper 
decreases in 
18F-FDG uptake (as measured by 18F-FDG 
PET/CT) compared to lenalid omide plus placebo, thus 
giving evidence of greater disease control. 
The difference in qPET parameters from the baseline 18F-
FDG PET/CT to the year 1 18F-FDG PET/CT will be 
reported by study arm. An analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model will be used to test for a treatment effect 
on each qPET parameter, where the baseline qPET parameter value and an indicator for study arm are included as covariates, with the qPET parameter at year 1 
as the model outcome.
59-61 Sensitivity of the findings will be 
examined by additionally adjusting the ANCOVA model for 
the randomization stratification factors (, as this would be expected to further improve precision of the study arm comparison.
62 
In addition, longitudinal profil es of each qPET parameter 
from the baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT through the year 2 18F-
FDG PET/CT will be compared across study arm through 
an appropriately construc ted linear mixed model.63 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
106 Assuming that up to 15% of patients may not have either 
the baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT scan performed or the year 
1 18F-FDG PET/CT scan performed, or may have one or 
more of these scans uninterpretable, the proposed sample size of 510 patients (434 ev aluable, 217 per study arm) 
has power of 80% using ANCOVA at a type I error rate of 
0.05 to detect a difference in year 1 mean SUVmax 
between arms as low as 2.0, with only moderate 
correlation between the baseline and year 1 SUVmax (R-
squared=0.45) and common standard deviation as large as 10.0 (PASS 16). Larger correlation between baseline and year 1 SUVmax and/or smaller standard deviation of SUVmax would result in greater power.

Appendix V 
 
Instructions for Reporting Pregnancies on a Clinical Trial 
What needs to be reported? 
All pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive  or inconclusive pregnancy 
test regardless of age or disease state) of a fe male patient while she is on ixazomib/placebo 
or lenalidomide, or within 28 days of the female patient’s last dose of ixazomib/placebo or 
lenalidomide must be reported in an expediti ous manner. The outcome of the pregnancy 
and neonatal status must also be reported. 
How should the pregnancy be reported? For this study, a pregnancy, suspected preg nancy (including a positi ve or inconclusive 
pregnancy test) must be initially reported on the Adverse Event Form or Late Adverse Event 
Form in the appropriate Treatment Cycle or Post  Registration folder in Medidata Rave. Once 
the adverse event is entered into Rave, the Rules Engine on the Expedited Reporting 
Evaluation Form will confirm whether or not the pregnancy requires expedited reporting. The 
CTEP-AERS report must then be initiated dire ctly from the Expedited Reporting Evaluation 
Form in Medidata Rave. Do not initiate the CTEP -AERS report via the CTEP-AERS website. 
When does a pregnancy, suspected pregna ncy or positive/inconclusive pregnancy 
test need to be reported? 
An initial report must be done within 24 hours of the Investigator’s learning of the event, 
followed by a complete expedited CTEP-AERs re port within 5 calendar days of the initial 24-
hour report. 
What other information do I need in orde r to complete the CTEP-AERs report for a 
pregnancy? 
x The pregnancy (fetal exposure) must be reported as a Grade 3 “Pregnancy, puerperium 
and perinatal conditions – Other (pregnancy)” under the System Organ Class (SOC) 
“Pregnancy, puerperium and  perinatal conditions”  
x The pregnancy must be reported within the ti meframe specified in the Adverse Event 
Reporting section of the protocol for a grade 3 event. 
x The start date of the pregnancy should be repor ted as the calculated date of conception.  
x The potential risk of exposure of the fetus to the investigational agent(s) or 
chemotherapy agent(s) should be  documented in the “Descript ion of Event” section of 
the CTEP-AERs report.  
What else do I need to know when a pregnancy occurs to a patient? 
x The Investigator must follow the female pa tient until completion of the pregnancy and 
must report the outcome of the pregnanc y and neonatal status in CTEP-AERs accessed 
via Medidata Rave.  
x The decision on whether an individual female patient can continue protocol treatment will 
be made by the site physician in collabo ration with the study chair and ECOG-ACRIN 
Operations Office – Boston. Please contact the ECOG-ACRIN Operations Office – 
Boston to ask for a conference call to be set up with the appropriate individuals.   
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
119 x It is recommended the female patient be re ferred to an obstetrician-gynecologist, 
preferably one experienced in reproductive to xicity for further evaluation and counseling.  
How should the outcome of a pregnancy be reported? The outcome of a pregnancy should be reported as an amendment  to the initial CTEP-AERs 
report if the outcome occurs on the same cycle of treatment as the pregnancy itself. 
However, if the outcome of the pregnancy occurred on a subsequent cycle, a new and 
separate CTEP-AERs report should be initiated (via Medidata Rave) reporting the outcome 
of the pregnancy. 
What constitutes an abnormal outcome? An abnormal outcome is defined as any pregnancy that results in the birth of a child with 
persistent or significant incapacity or substant ial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions (formerly referred to  as disabilities), co ngenital anomalies, or birth defects. For 
assistance in recording the grade or categor y of these events, please contact the CTEP 
AEMD Help Desk at 301-897-7497 or aemd@tech-res.com , for it will need to be discussed 
on a case by case basis.   
Reporting a Pregnancy Loss 
A pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE as “ A death in utero. ” 
For this study, it must be initially reported on the Adverse Event Form or Late Adverse Event 
Form in the appropriate Treatment Cycle or Post  Registration folder in Medidata Rave. Once 
the adverse event is entered into Rave, the Rules Engine on the Expedited Reporting 
Evaluation Form will confirm whether or not the adverse event requires expedited reporting. 
The CTEP-AERS report must then be initiated directly from the Expedited Reporting Evaluation Form in Medidata Rave. Do not init iate the CTEP-AERS report via the CTEP-
AERS website. The pregnancy loss must be reported as a Grade 4 “Pregnancy loss ” under 
the System Organ Class (SOC) “ Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions” . 
A pregnancy loss should NOT be reported as a Grade 5 ev ent as currently CTEP-AERs 
recognizes this event as a patient’s death.  
Reporting a Neonatal Death A neonatal death is defined in CTCAE as “ A newborn death occurring during the first 28 
days after birth ” that is felt by  the investigator to be at least possibly due to the 
investigational  agent/intervention. However, for this prot ocol, any neonatal death that occurs 
within 28 days of birth, without regard to caus ality, AND any infant death after 28 days that 
is suspected of being related to the in utero  exposure to ixazomib/placebo or lenalidomide, 
must be initially reported on the Adverse Event Form or Late Adve rse Event Form in the 
appropriate Treatment Cycle or Post Registrati on folder in Medidata Rave. Once the event 
is entered into Rave, the Rul es engine on the Expedited Reporting Evaluation Form will 
confirm whether or not the event requires expedi ted reporting. The CTEP-AERS report must 
then be initiated directly from the Expedi ted Reporting Evaluation Form in Medidata Rave. 
Do not initiate the CTEP-AERS report via the CTEP-AERS website. The neonatal death must be reported as a Grade 4 “ Death neonatal ” under the System Organ Class (SOC) 
“General disorder and administration site conditions”.  
A neonatal death should NOT be reported as a Grade 5 event as currently CTEP-AERs 
recognizes this event as a patient’s death.  Rev. Add1

Appendix VI 
 
Lenalidomide Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable 
Birth Control Methods 
1.1. Risks Associated with Pregnancy 
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human 
teratogenic active substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. An 
embryofetal development study in animals indicates that lenalidomide produced 
malformations in the offspring of fem ale monkeys who received the drug during 
pregnancy. A teratogenic e ffect of lenalidomide in hum ans cannot be ruled out. 
Therefore, a pregnancy prevention program must be followed.  
1.1.1. Definition of a Patient of Childbearing Potential 
A patient of childbearing potential is anyone  who: 1) has achieved menarche at 
some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterec tomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) 
has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy 
does not rule out childbearing potential) fo r at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., 
has had menses at any time in th e preceding 24 cons ecutive months). 
1.1.2. Definition of a Patient Not of Childbearing Potential 
Patients who do not meet the above definition of a patient of childbearing 
potential should be classified as Pati ent Not of Childbearing Potential. 
1.2. Counseling  
1.2.1. Patients of Childbearing Potential  
For a patient of childbearing potential, lena lidomide is contraindicated unless all 
of the following are met (i.e., all patient of childbearing potential must be counseled concerning the following risks and requirements prior to the start of 
lenalidomide): 
x Patients understand the potential te ratogenic risk to the unborn child 
x Patients understand the need for effectiv e contraception, without interruption, 
28 days before starting lenalidomide, th roughout the entire duration of 
lenalidomide, during dose interruptions an d for at least 28 days after the last 
dose of lenalidomide 
x Patients understand and agree to inform the Investigator if a change or stop 
of method of contraception is needed 
x Patients must be capable of complyin g with effective contraceptive measures 
x Patients are informed and unders tand the potential consequences of 
pregnancy and the need to notify her st udy doctor immediately if there is a 
risk of pregnancy 
x Patients understand the need to commenc e lenalidomide as soon as it is 
dispensed following a negative pregnancy test 
x Patients understand and accept the need to undergo pregnancy testing 
based on the frequency outlined in this plan (Section 1.4 below) and in the 
Informed Consent Rev. Add3 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
122 x Patients acknowledge that they und erstand the hazards lenalidomide can 
cause to an unborn fetus and the nece ssary precautions associated with the 
use of lenalidomide. 
The Investigator must ensure that a patient of childbearing potential: 
x Complies with the conditions of the pregnancy preventio n plan, including 
confirmation that they have an adequate level of understanding 
x Acknowledges the aforementioned requirements. 
1.2.2. Patients Not of Childbearing Potential  
For a patient not of childbearing potential, lenalidomide is contraindicated unless 
all of the following are met (i.e., all patien ts not of childbearing potential must be 
counseled concerning the following risks and requirements prior to the start of 
lenalidomide): 
x Patients acknowledge they understa nd the hazards lenalidomide can cause 
to an unborn fetus and the necessary precautions associated with the use of lenalidomide. 
1.2.3. Males  
Traces of lenalidomide have been found in  semen. Patients taking lenalidomide 
must meet the following conditions (i.e ., all males must be counseled concerning 
the following risks and requirements prior to the start of lenalidomide): 
x Male patients understand the potential tera togenic risk if engaged in sexual 
activity with a pregnant partner or a partner of childbearing potential. 
x Male patients understand the need for th e use of a condom even if they have 
had a vasectomy, if engaged in sexual  activity with a pregnant partner or a 
partner of childbearing potential. 
x Understand the potential teratogenic risk if the patient donates semen or 
sperm. 
1.3. Contraception  
1.3.1. Patients of Childbearing Potential  
Patients of childbearing potential enrolled in this protocol must agree to use two 
reliable forms of contraception simultaneou sly or to practice complete abstinence 
(True abstinence is acceptable when this is  in line with the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abs tinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal or post-ovulation meth ods] and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception.) from heterose xual contact during the following time 
periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting lenalidomide; 
2) while taking lenalidomide; 3) during do se interruptions; and 4) for at least 28 
days after the last do se of lenalidomide. 
The two methods of reliable contraceptio n must include one highly effective 
method and one additional effective (barrier) method. If the below contraception methods are not appropriate for the patient  of childbearing potential, they must 
be referred to a qualified provider of contraception methods to determine the 
medically effective contraception method appropriate to the patient. The following 
are examples of highly effective a nd additional effective methods of 
contraception: 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
123 x Examples of highly effective methods: 
x Intrauterine device (IUD) 
x Hormonal (birth control pills, inje ctions, implants, levonorgestrel-releasing 
intrauterine system [IUS], medroxyprogesterone acetate depot injections, ovulation inhibitory progesterone -only pills [e.g., desogestrel]) 
x Tubal ligation 
x Partner’s vasectomy  
x Examples of additiona l effective methods: 
x Male condom 
x Diaphragm 
x Cervical Cap 
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with 
multiple myeloma taking lenalidomi de and dexamethasone, combined oral 
contraceptive pills are not recommended. If a patient is current ly using combined 
oral contraception the patient should switch to another one of the highly effective 
methods listed above. The risk of veno us thromboembolism continues for 4 to 6 
weeks after discontinuing combined oral  contraception. The efficacy of 
contraceptive steroids may be reduced du ring co-treatment with dexamethasone. 
Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated with 
an increased risk of infecti on at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal 
bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered particularly in patients with neutropenia. 
1.3.2. Male Patients  
Male patients must practice complete abstinence (True abstinence is acceptable 
when this is in line with the preferred a nd usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic 
abstinence [e.g., calendar, ov ulation, symptothermal or post-ovulation methods] 
and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.) or agree to use a 
condom during sexual cont act with a pregnant partner or a partner of 
childbearing potential while taking lenalidom ide, during dose interruptions and for 
at least 28 days after th e last dose of lenalidomide,  even if they have undergone 
a successful vasectomy. 
1.4. Pregnancy Testing  
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitiv ity of 25mIU/mL must be 
performed for patients of childbearing potential. 
Patients of childbearing potential must have two negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of 
at least 25mIU/mL) prior to starting lenal idomide. The first preg nancy test must be 
performed within 10 to 14 days prior to the start of lenalidomide and the second 
pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours prior to the start of lenalidomide. The 
patient may not receive lenalidomide until the st udy doctor has verified that the results of 
these pregnancy tests are negative. 
Patients of childbearing potential with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have 
pregnancy tests weekly for the first 28 days of study participation and then every 28 
days while taking lenalidomide, at study disconti nuation, and at Day 28 following the last 
dose of lenalidomide. 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
124 Patients of childbearing potential with irregu lar menstrual cycles must agree to have 
pregnancy tests weekly for the first 28 days of study participation and then every 14 
days while taking lenalidomide, at study discontinuation, and at Days 14 and 28 
following the last dose of lenalidomide. 
1.5. Pregnancy Precautions for Lenalidomide Use  
1.5.1. Before Starting Lenalidomide  
1.5.1.1 Patients of Childbearing Potential 
Patients of childbearing potential must have two negative pregnancy 
tests (sensitivity of at least 25mIU/mL) prior to starting lenalidomide. 
The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10 to 14 days prior to the start of lenalidomide and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours prior to the start of lenalidomide. The 
patient may not receive lenalidomide until the study doctor has 
verified that the results of these pregnancy tests are negative. 
Patients of childbearing potentia l must use two reliable forms of 
contraception simultaneously, or practice complete abstinence (True 
abstinence is acceptable when this  is in line with the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the patient. Pe riodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal or post -ovulation methods] and withdrawal 
are not acceptable methods of contraception.) from heterosexual contact for at least 28 days before starting lenalidomide. 
1.5.1.2. Male Patients  
Male patients must agree to practice complete abstinence (True 
abstinence is acceptable when this  is in line with the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the patient. Pe riodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal or post -ovulation methods] and withdrawal 
are not acceptable methods of contraception.) or agree to use a condom during sexual cont act with a pregnant partner or a partner of 
childbearing potentialwhile taking lenalidomide, during dose 
interruptions and for at least 28 days after the last dose of 
lenalidomide, even if he has under gone a successful vasectomy. 
1.5.2. During and After Study Participation  
1.5.2.1 Patients of Childbearing Potential  
x Patients of childbearing potentia l with regular or no menstrual 
cycles must agree to have pregnan cy tests weekly for the first 28 
days of study participation and then every 28 days while taking lenalidomide, at study discontinuation, and at Day 28 following the 
last dose of lenalidomide. 
x Patients of childbearing potentia l with irregular menstrual cycles 
must agree to have pregnancy tests weekly for the first 28 days of study participation and then every 14 days while taking 
lenalidomide, at study discontinuation, and at Days 14 and 28 following the last dose of lenalidomide. 
x At each visit, the Investigator must confirm with the patient of 
childbearing potential that they are continuing to use two reliable 
ECOG-ACRIN EAA171 
Cancer Research Group Version Date: January 4, 2023 
125 methods of birth control if not co mmitting to complete abstinence, 
or confirm commitment to complete abstinence. 
x If a patient of childbearing potential considers the need to change 
or to stop a method of contracept ion, the Investigator must be 
notified immediately. 
x Counseling about pregnancy precaution s and the potential risks of 
fetal exposure must be conducted at a minimum of every 28 days. 
x If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a patient, 
lenalidomide must be immediately discontinued. 
x Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a patient 
misses their period or if her pr egnancy test or their menstrual 
bleeding is abnormal. Lenalidomide must be discontinued during this evaluation. 
x Patients must agree to abstain from breastfeeding while taking 
lenalidomide and for at least 28 da ys after the last dose of 
lenalidomide. 
1.5.2.2. Male Patients  
x Must practice complete abstinence (True abstinence is acceptable 
when this is in line with the pref erred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient. Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal or post-ovulation  methods] and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contrac eption.) or use a condom during 
sexual contact with a pregnant partn er or a partner of childbearing 
potential while taking lenalidomide, during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days after the last dose of lenalidomide, even if he 
has undergone a successful vasectomy. 
x Must not donate semen or sper m while receiving lenalidomide, 
during dose interruptions or for at least 28 days after the last dose 
of lenalidomide. 
x Counseling about pregnancy precaution s and the potential risks of 
fetal exposure must be conducted at a minimum of every 28 days. 
x If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in the partner 
of a male patient while taking lenalidomide, the Investigator must be notified immediately. 
1.5.3. Additional Precautions 
x Patients should be instructed to ne ver give lenalidomide to another person. 
x Patients should be instructed to retu rn any unused capsules to the study 
doctor. 
x Patients should not donate blood while  receiving lenalidomide, during dose 
interruptions and for at least 28 days after the last dose of lenalidomide. 
x No more than a 28-day lenalidomide supply may be dispensed with each 
cycle of lenalidomide.

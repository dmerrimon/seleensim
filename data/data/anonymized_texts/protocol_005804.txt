Combined with Pembrolizumab in Subjects with Selected Hyaluronan -High Solid Tumors  
Study Objectives  
Dose Escalation   
Primary : 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of  PEGylated recombinant human hyaluronidase 
(PEGPH20) c ombined with pembrolizumab  (Keytruda®) (PEGPEM ) in subjects with 
relapsed/refractory non- small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) and relapsed/refractory 
gastric adenocarcinoma.

administered with pembrolizumab in subjects with relapsed/refractory NSCLC and 
relapsed/refractory gastric adenocarcinoma.  
Secondary : 
• To asses s the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of PEGPH20 when given in combination with 
pembrolizumab in subjects with relapsed/refractory NSCLC or  relapsed/refractory 
gastric adenocarcinoma.  
• To obtain an early assessment of the antitumor activity of PEGPEM, as assessed by 
objective response rate ( ORR ), duration of response (DOR), disease control rate 
(DCR) and progression- free survival (PFS) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors  (RECIST ) v1.1, and overall survival (OS) in subjects with 
relapsed/refractory NSCLC or  relapsed/refractory gastric adenocarcinoma.  
Exploratory:  
• To assess the PK of pembrolizumab when given in combination with PEGPH20 in subjects with relapsed/refractory NSCLC or relapsed/refractory gastric adenocarcinoma.

Study Design  
This Phase 1b study of PEGPEM  will consist of 2 portions:  
• A Dose Escalation portion in s ubjects with relapsed/refractory Stage  IIIB or IV 
NSCLC after failing at least 1 previous platinum- based chemotherapy regimen (refer 
to Inclusion C riteri on #2) and subjects with relapsed/refractory locally advanced or 
metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma after failing at least 1 previous chemotherapy 
regimen  for locally advanced or  metastatic disease. 
• Followed by a Dose Expansion portion in:  
− Previously untreated, HA -high subjects with Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC   
− Previously treated, HA -high subjects with relapsed/refractory Stage IIIB or IV 
NSCLC having failed no more than 1 previous platinum -based chemotherapy 
regimen (refer to Inclusion C riteri on #3) for locally advanced or metastatic disease 
and 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 of 112  06 November 2017  − HA-high subjects with relapsed/refractory locally advanced or metastatic gastric 
adenocarcinoma having failed no more than 2 previous chemotherapy regimens  
for locally advanced or metastatic disease.  
Note:  In Dose Expansion, s ubjects will be selected for enrollment whose tumors are HA -high, 
using a co -developed investigational diagnostic assay . Subjects will be tested retrospectively for 
PD-L1 expression levels . 
Since PEGPH20 has not been evaluated in clinical studies in combination with pembrolizumab, 
this study will have a D ose E scalation portion to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PEGPEM 
treatment before the D ose E xpansion portion is initiated. The D ose E scalation portion will also 
be used to determine the dose of PEGPH20 to be evaluated in the D ose E xpansion portion. 
The treatment period  will consist of 21 -day cycles.  
In Dose Escalation, PEGPH20 will be administered on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of each 21- day 
cycle (i.e. 3 doses/cycle)  and pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg every 21 days) on Day 1 of each cycle 
(i.e. 1 dose/cycle), 4- 6 hours after the completion of PEGPH20 administration  (per Protocol 
Amendment 2) . 
In Dose Expansion, 200 mg of pembrolizumab will be administered every 21 days ( per Protocol 
Amendment 3 [see Section  4.6.4 for additional details ]) and the dosing schedule will be as 
follows:  
• PEGPH20 will be administered on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of each 21- day cycle (i.e. 
3 doses/cycle) and pembrolizumab (200 mg every 21 days) on Day 1 of each cycle (i.e. 1 dose/cycle), 4- 6 hours after the  completion of PEGPH20 administration. 
In Dose Expansion, an independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will review all available 
safety data from the firs t 3 NSCLC subjects and first 3 gastric adenocarcinoma subjects who have 
completed Cycle 1, to determine if the safety and tolerability profile of the PEGPEM combination is acceptable (refer to the DMC charter for additional details) . The DMC will also 
continue to periodically review safety data to protect subject welfare and identify potential safety 
signals. 
Treatment in both portions of the study will continue until death, withdrawal of consent from the 
study, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity;  however , subject s with asymptomatic 
disease progression will be allowed to continue the study treatment at the Investigator ’s 
discretion despite evidence of increasing tumor burden or appearance of new lesions for up to 
6 weeks if the subject  is “clinically stable .” Clinically stable is defined as : 
• Absence of symptoms and signs indicating clinically significant  progressive disease  
(PD) (including worsening of laboratory values) indicating disease progression;  
• No decline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG)  performance status; and  
• Absence of rapid progression of disease or of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (e.g., cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention. 
Dose interruptions and modifications of s tudy treatment are permitted.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 6 of 112  06 November 2017  In single -agent studies of PEGPH20 and the combination study with  gemcitabine  (GEM ), the 
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was musculoskeletal events (MSEs) of myalgia and muscle 
cramping. In clinical studies HALO- 109-102, HALO -109-201 and HALO -109-202, 
dexamethasone was administered per protocol to attenuate the severity of  MSEs . Since this study 
uses an immunotherapeutic agent  and dexamethasone may suppress an immune response , it 
should only be used w hen prescribed by the Investigator  and following a discussion with the 
Sponsor . 
Piroxicam and toradol have been invest igated in an animal model of MSE s and may be helpful in 
decreasing the severity of MSEs  in subject s (internal Halozyme report) . Piroxicam (20 mg) will 
be administered  at least 1- 2 hours prior to PEGPH20 administration on the day of dosing (timing 
will be at the Investigator’s discretion based on the piroxicam manufacturer’s Prescribing 
Information and subject’s convenience)  to minimize the s everity of MSEs . Prophylactic use of a 
proton pump inhibitor  is mandated  for all subjects  while receiving PEGPH20 (e.g. 20 mg 
omeprazole daily or over -the-counter [OTC] equivalent) . 
Toradol may be given for severe pain as recommended in the Toradol P rescri bing Information. 
Toradol  should not be administered concurrently with piroxicam as per the Prescribing 
Information, as  it is contraindicated to administer t oradol simultaneously with other nonsteroidal  
anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) because of the cumulative risk of inducing ser ious 
NSAID- related side effects.  
To help minimize  MSEs,  prescribed medication such as narcotics, muscle relaxants and other 
analgesics (with the exceptions of steroids), OTC  drugs and physical therapy can be used at the 
Investigator’s discretion. 
All NSCLC subjects will be given enteric- coated 81 mg of aspirin/day and all gastric 
adenocarcinoma subjects will be given enoxaparin 40 mg/day  (pre-filled syringes of enoxaparin 
are allowed ), for prophylaxis of thromboembolic (TE) events, given the high incidence seen in 
these tumor types. Subjects who experience any TE event requiring full -dose anticoagulants 
while on study will  discontinue treatment with PEGPH20. T reatment with pembrolizumab,  
however, may continue at the Investigator ’s discretion . 
In gastric adenocarcinoma subjects , if enoxaparin is discontinued for any reason, PEGPH20 will 
also be discontinued. Treatment with pembrolizumab, however, may continue at  the 
Investigator’s discretion. Subjects who discontinue PEGPH20 and pembrolizumab treatment will have an End of 
Treatment Visit and enter lo ng-term follow -up for survival. 
Subjects will be assessed for adverse events (AEs) and clinical laboratory evaluations as graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03. 
In both portions of the study, tumor response and progression will be assessed by the Investigator 
at the end of Cycle 2, Cycle 4 and then at the end of every fourth treatment cycle thereafter (i.e., 
Week 3 of Cycles 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and beyond) based on RECIST  v 1.1 criteria  (Eisenhauer 2009
; 
Appendix C ) and irRC ( Nishino 2013;  Nishino 2014;  Appendix E ). Tumor assessment scans 
(CT/MRI of chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other areas of known or newly suspected disease) should 
be performed at Screening (within 28 days prior to first dose of study drugs) and obtained any 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 of 112  06 November 2017  time on or after Day 15 (of Cycles 2, 4, 8,  12, 16 and every fourth treatment cycle thereafter) to 
allow enough time for the scan to be reviewed locally prior to the subject’s next scheduled dosing 
visit.  
A CT/MRI brain scan must be performed at Screening (within 28 days prior to first dose of study 
drugs), to assess potential central nervous system disease and/or metastases.  
For the duration of the study (i .e., post -baseline), CT/MRI of the brain will be performed if 
clinically indicated, and within a target of 1 week after a subject achi eves a com plete response 
(CR). For NSCLC subjects with a history of treated brain metastases, brain scans will be performed at tumor assessment time points.  
To determine the best overall response, a confirmatory scan must  be performed no sooner than 
28 days after th e initial scan that showed a response (Partial Response [PR] or Complete 
Response [CR])  based on RECIST v1.1 and irRC . A confirmatory scan should also be performed 
to confirm disease progression based on irRC no sooner than 28 days after the initial scan that 
showed progression. 
Phase 1b Dose Escalation Portion  
This portion of the study is a single -arm, dose escalation study of PEGPH20 in combination with 
pembrolizumab. Using a standard 3+3 dose escalation design, approximately 3 to 6 subjects in 
each cohort will receive PEGPH20 + pembrolizumab. PEGPH20 will be administered on Day 1, 
Day 8 and Day 15 of each 21- day cycle to consecutive cohorts in increasing dose levels (1.6, 2.2, 
2.6, 3.0, and 4.0 µg/kg). Pembrolizumab will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle, 4 -6 hours 
after the dose of PEGPH20. If the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) is not reached at 4.0 µg/kg, 
higher doses may be evaluated. If ≥2 subjects experience a DLT at the 1.6 µg/kg dose level , 
Cohort - 1 will be opened and subject s will be dosed at 1.0 µg/kg on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15 of 
each 21 -day cycle. The RP2D of PEGPH20 will be the MTD determined in Dose Escalation or 
the Sponsor may decide to choose a dose lower than the MTD and which has completed 
evaluation in Dose Escalati on and is found to be safe and tolerable to evaluate in Dose 
Expansion. 
The number of cohorts studied and number of subjects exposed to a given dose level will depend 
on the doses tested. It is anticipated that up to 5 dose levels will be studied for a tot al of 
approximately 30 subjects exposed to study medication. The dose allocation for 5 cohorts of subjects assigned to the 5  preselected dose levels  and the - 1 cohort assigned to the presel ected 
dose of 1.0 µg/kg (if ≥2  subjects experience a DLT at 1.6  µg/kg dose level ) is shown as an 
example in Table S -1
. The study medication dosing and treatment schedule are shown in 
Table S -2. 
Safety d ata from all subjects dosed will be reviewed to determine the R P2D. Dose escalation will 
be guided by safety data from each subject during the 21 days following their first dose of PEGPH20. Intra -subject dose escalation to the next PEGPH20 dose studied may be allowed if the 
Investigator deems it in the best interest o f the subject and after discussion with the Sponsor and 
provided the next PEGPH20 dose studied has been determined not to have exceeded the MTD . 
• If none of 3 subjects  in a given cohort experience a DLT within 21 days of starting 
treatment, enrollment and dosing may proceed at the next planned dose level. 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 112  06 November 2017  • If 1 of 3 initial subjects  at a given dose level experiences a DLT within the first 
21 days of treatment, 3 additional subjects will be  enrolled and dosed at the same dose 
level. If ≤1 of 6 subjects experience s a DLT, dose escalation may continue to the next 
planned higher dose.  
• If ≥2 subjects at a given dose level experience a DLT within the first 21 days of 
treatment, that dose level wi ll be considered to have exceeded the MTD and dose 
escalation will be stopped. If the previous dose level did not already have 6 subjects treated with ≤1 DLT, enrollment and dosing will then resume in the previous dose 
level with additional subjects up to a total of 6 subjects. The highest dose level at 
which no more than 1 of 6 evaluable subjects has experienced a DLT in the first 3 weeks of treatment will be considered the MTD for the PEGPEM combination. The RP2D will be based on the overall safety profil e. 
• If ≥2 subjects at the 1.6 µg/kg dose level experience a DLT within the first 21 days of treatment,  Cohort - 1 will be opened at a lower dose level of 1.0 µg/kg. 
Note:  Additional subjects may be enrolled in each cohort to further assess the tolerability of 
PEGPEM and determine an acceptable safety profile prior to the enrollment in the next dose level and expansion portion of the study. 
Definition of DLT  
DLTs will be as sessed for each subject during the 21 days following their first PEGPH20 dose 
and will be defined as any of the following:  
• Any treatment -emergent Grade ≥3 toxicity that is considered related to either 
PEGPH20 or pembrolizumab or  the combination of PEGPH20 and pembrolizumab 
(nausea, vomiting, musculoskeletal events and diarrhea will be considered DLTs only if they reach ≥ Grade 3 despite adequate supportive care measures).  
• Grade 3 MSEs are considered DLTs only if they do not reduce  to ≤ Grade 2 within 
48 hours despite therapeutic intervention. 
• Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions related to PEGPH20 or pembrolizumab dosing 
will not be considered DLTs (hypersensitivity reactions are generally not related to the dose level of a drug since they can occur even  upon a low level of exposure).  
To be considered evaluable for DLT assessment, subjects must receive 1 of the 3 full planned doses of PEGPH20 and 1 complete dose of pembrolizumab in Cycle 1 . Subjects who experience 
a DLT within the first 21 days of treatment and withdraw from the study will be considered 
evaluable for DLT and will not be replaced. Subjects who withdraw within the first 21 days for 
reasons other than a DLT will be considered not evaluable and will be replaced. Any PEGPH 20 
treatment -related AE that results in interruption or reduction of either PEGPH20 or 
pembrolizumab may be considered a DLT at  the Investigator’s discretion.  
The Sponsor and the participating investigators will meet as soon as practical , post completion of 
a cohort, and no more than 10 business days after the end of the last cohort to determine an 
acceptable dose for the D ose E xpansion portion after reviewing all available safety data from 
Cycle 1 from all subjects in the Dose Escalation  portion.

Study Medication  
For this study, study medication will include PEGPH20 and pembrolizumab.  
PEGPH20:  PEGPH20 drug product is supplied as an aqueous solution containing 0.3 mg/mL 
PEGPH20 with 10 mM succinic acid, 130 mM NaCl and 10 mM methionine at pH  6.2. Each vial 
contains 1.2 mL (0.36 mg) of PEGPH20 drug product. PEGPH20 drug product is provided as a 
refrigerated formulation and should be s tored at 2°C to 8° C before use.  
PEGPH20 mixing instructions will be provided to sites in the pharmacy manual . PEGPH20 will be 
administered on Day 1 , Day 8 and Day 15 of each 21- day cycle as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 10 
minutes, approximately 1 mL/minute (a window of  +2 minutes is allowed, i.e., infusion can be 10 to 
12 minutes). The dose for the escalation portion will depend on the escalation process. The PEGPH20 
dose for the expansion portion will be the MTD established in the escalation portion  or a dose  lower  
than the MTD  and which  has complete d evaluation  in Dose Escalation and found to be safe and 
tolerable.  
Pembrolizumab: In Dose Escalation, p embrolizumab 2 mg/kg will be administered as an IV infusion over 
30 minutes  every 21 days on Day 1 of each cycle , 4-6 hours after the completion of PEGPH20 
administration  (Keytruda® US Prescribing Information  2015) . In Dose Expansion , 200 mg of 
pembrolizumab will be administered as an IV infusion over 30  minutes every 21  days on Day 1 of each 
cycle, 4 -6 hours after the completion of PEGPH20 administration  (see Section  4.6.4  for additional 
details ). 
Refer to pembrolizumab Prescribing I nformation for a description of the drug ( Keytruda® US 
Prescribing Information 2017) . 
Study Duration  
The study will consist of a n optional  prescreening period for HA -testing  in Dose Expansion ( per 
Protocol Amendment 3), a s creening period of up to 28 days, a treatment period (21- day cycles), 
a 30-day post -treatment period (after last dose) for collection of AEs and long-term follow -up. 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 112  06 November 2017  Subjects will be allowed to continue treatment on study until unacceptable toxicity or dis ease 
progression. Subjects with asymptomatic disease progression however, will be allowed to 
continue the study treatment at the Investigator ’s discretion despite evidence of increasing tumor 
burden or appearance of new lesions for up to 6 weeks if the subject  is clinically stable.  
Clinically stable is defined as: 
• Absence of symptoms and signs indicating clinically significant PD (including 
worsening of laboratory values) indicating disease progression;  
• No decline in ECOG performance status; and  
• Absence of rapid progression of disease or of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (e.g., cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention. 
Disease progression will be defined by the presence of 1 or both of the following, based on the  
Investigator ’s assessment:  
• Disease progression documented by CT scan/MRI scan based on RECIST v1.1.  
• Clinical tumor -related progression that is well documented in the absence of radiological scans 
demonstrating disease progression.  
Investigators may also disc ontinue study treatment if it is no longer in th e best interest of the 
subject.  
Subjects who discontinue treatment  with PEGPH20 and pembrolizumab  will be followed every 
12 weeks for survival until death, withdrawal of consent, or lost to follow -up.

Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 of 112  06 November 2017  Pharmacokinet ic Assessments  
Plasma PEGPH20 and serum pembrolizumab concentrations will be measured as specified in the Study 
Schedule of Events.  
Biomarker and Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
The treatment effect of PEGPEM will be evaluated based on pre-  and post -treatment measurement of 
HA in plasma and tumor  as well as change in potential biomarkers of pembrolizumab and/or PEGPH20 
activity in plasma and tumor biopsies , blood flow as measured  by DCE -MRI, and tumor metabolism as 
measured by PET/CT.  
Statistical Methods  
Planned Total Sample Size  
In the dose escalating portion, there may be up to 5  dose levels for a total of approximately 
30 subjects.  
In the D ose Expansion portion, approximately 51 subjects will  be enrolled (approximately 30 with HA- high  
tumors in NSCLC cohort and approximately 21 with HA -high tumors in the gastric adenocarcinoma 
cohort).  
KEYNOTE -001 study data presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2016 ( Hui 2016) showed 
that when treated with pembrolizumab alone, treatment naïve subjects who  had evaluable PD -L1 Tumor 
Proportion Score [TPS] levels had an ORR of 29%  and previously treated subjects who  had evaluable PD -L1 
TPS levels had an ORR of 21% . Under the assumption that no more than 40% of the subjects enrolled in 
this study will be treatment naïve, ORR in the combined NSCLC population is expected to be 
approxi mately 24% when treated with pembrolizumab alone. A 20% improvement in ORR is considered 
clinically meaningful when PEGPH20 is added to pembrolizumab. Under these conditions, 30 NSCLC 
subjects would provide approximately 80% power at the hypothesized ORR o f 44% when the null 
hypothesis H0:  ORR ≤24% is tested against H1: ORR >24% using an exact one -sided binomial test at a 10% 
significance level.  
KEYNOTE -012 study data showed that the ORR in PD -L1 positive gastric cancer subjects is about 22% 
(Muro  2016) . Since subjects will not be selected based on PD -L1 expression levels prospectively in this 
study, in order to accom modate all subjects (irrespect ive of PD -L1 expression levels), a conservative ORR 
of 15% is assumed with pembrolizumab treatment alone and it is further assumed that the addition of 
PEGPH20 to pembrolizumab will lead to a clinically meaningful improvement of 20% in ORR to 35%.  
Under th ese assumptions, 21 subjects will provide approximately 80% power at the hypothesized ORR of 
35% when the null hypothesis H0:  ORR ≤15% tested against H1:  ORR >15% using an exact one sided 
binomial test at a 10% significance level.  
Analysis Populations  
Safe ty Population : All subjects wh o receive any study medication. The Safety Population will be used for 
subject disposition, de mographics and safety analyses.  
DLT Evaluable Population: All subjects who receive at least 1  of the 3 full planned dose s of PEGPH20 and 
1 complete dose of pembrolizumab  in Cycle 1 and  have been followed for the first 21 days of treatment 
or have experienced a DLT during the initial 21 days (Cycle 1) of the study.  The DLT Evaluable Population  
will be used for DLT analysis.

Analyses  
Analysis of Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics w ill be summarized using safety population by dose level for 
subjects in the D ose Escalation portion and separately for all subjects in the D ose Expansion  portion . The 
following demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized: age, race, height,  weight, 
medical history, disease characteristics, and treatment history.  
Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy analyses will be conducted using the Efficacy Evaluable Population. ORR and DOR will also be 
analyzed using Tumor  Response Evaluable population.  
The pr imary efficacy endpoint of the study is PEGPEM treatment effect on ORR  based on RECIST v1.1 . 
The statistical hypothesis tests for the primary endpoint are as follows:  
• NSCLC cohort: H 0: ORR ≤ 23%; H 1: ORR > 23% 
• Gastric adenocarcinoma  cohort: H 0: ORR ≤ 15%; H 1: ORR > 15% 
The hypothesis tests will be conducted using the one -sided exact binomial test at the significance 
level of 0.1.  
ORR will be calculated as the number of subjects with a confirmed CR or PR divided by the number of 
subjects in the analysis population  multiplied by 100 . The exact 80 % confidence interval of ORR will also 
be constructed. DCR and i ts exact 80% CI will be calculated. Median DOR, PFS and OS  and their  
corresponding 80% confidence interval s will be estimated using the Kapla n-Meier method.  
Safety Analyses  
All safety parameters will be summarized using the Safety Population.  
All AEs will be presented in incidence tables coded by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Preferr ed Term and System Organ Class. Additionally, separate AE incidence tables, coded by 
MedDRA term, will be presented by: 1) toxicity grade (severity) graded by the CTCAE and 2) relationship to study medication (PEGPH20 and pembrolizumab).  
All AEs, serious adverse events, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and deaths occurring during 
the study will be summarized.  
Laboratory parameters  and vital signs and the corresponding change from baseline over time will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics.

Note : Each treatment cycle is 21 days. Dose interruption and modifications are permitted.  
a The 28 -day screening window will begin when the subject signs the study ICF (i.e., signature on the prescreening ICF does not initiate the screening window).  
b In Dose Escalation –  Available tissue from the primary or a metastatic lesion is required. A formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) block or 5 -10 unstained, 
consecutive co re biopsy slides of 1 tumor tissue block (refer to Inclusion Criterion #4 for more details) are required to send to the central laboratory. Note:  Fine 
needle aspirates or brushing biopsies will not be acceptable.  
 In Dose Expansion –  Available tissue from  the primary or a metastatic lesion is required. An FFPE block or 10- 15 unstained, consecutive tumor tissue  slides of 
1 tumor tissue block (refer to Inclusion Criterion #4 for more details) are required to send to the central laboratory. Note:  Fine needle aspirates or brushing 
biopsies will not be acceptable. Archived resection specimens from the primary tumor without radiologic evidence of metastasi s at the time of resection are not 
suitable to establish histological confirmation and require new tumor tiss ue of a metastatic site. Tumor tissue must be sent to central laboratory to assess HA 
status for eligibility into the D ose Expansion portion of the study.  
c If these procedures are performed as part of standard -of-care prior to the subject’s signing of the  Informed Consent Form, the results may be used for screening 
purposes provided the procedures were performed within the screening window.  
d Optional procedure. PET/CT and DCE -MRI scans will be sent to the Central Imaging Vendor for analysis if they are co nducted.  DCE -MRI scans must be 
obtained within 14  days prior to Day 1 (first dose of study medication).  
e To be performed within 7 days prior to Day 1 (first dose of study medication).  
f   Blood samples will be collected for baseline testing of thyroid hormones ( free T3, free T4; and TSH ).

Note : Visit window is ±2 days of the specified times.  
a See Section  8.2 for details on individual assessments.  
b Subjects should return to the study site for an End of Treatment Visit within approximately 7 days after  determination of PD or within 7 days after treatment 
discontinuation of PEGPH20 and pembrolizumab for other reasons.  
c After the End of Treatment Visit, subjects will enter long -term follow -up during which information on the subject’s survival and subsequ ent anti- cancer 
therapy will be obtained by the site every 12 weeks . Long term follow -up will continue until the subject dies, is lost to follow -up, or withdraws consent.  
d Vital signs will be done pre dose on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of all cycles and End of Treatment Visit. On all other days, vital signs will be collected for 
clinically significant AEs.  
e 12-lead ECG will be done at end of treatment and on an as needed basis when clinically indicated.  
f Tumor assessment scans (CT/MRI of chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other areas of known or newly suspected disease) will be obtained and evaluated locally  for 
response evaluation based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  (RECIST) v  1.1 criteria  and irRC at the end of Cycle 2, Cycle 4 and then at the end 
of every fourth treatment cycle thereafter (i.e., Week 3 of Cycles 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and beyond). Scans will also be sent to the Central Imaging Vendor (CIV) to be 
stored for possible central review  at a later date, if needed. Scans may be obtained any time on or after Day 15 (of Cycles 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and every fourth 
treatment cycle thereafter) to allow enough time for the scan to be reviewed locally prior to the subject’s next scheduled dosing vis it. For subjects who are 
withdrawn from the study due to clinical disease progression , a CT /MRI  scan should be requested as soon as possible after clinical progression is determined.  
g CT/MRI  should only be done if radiologic progressive disease was not documented in the previous CT /MRI  scan.  
h A confirmatory scan should be performed no sooner than 28 days after the initial scan that showed a response based on RECIST v1.1 (PR or CR) or irRC. A  
confirmatory scan should also be performed to confirm disease progression based on irRC no sooner than 28 days after the init ial scan that showed progression.  
i CT/MRI of the brain will be performed for the duration of the study (i.e ., post-baseline), if clinically indicated, and within a target of 1 week after a subject 
achieves a complete response (CR). For NSCLC subjects with a history of treated brain metastases, brain scans will be perform ed at tumor assessment time 
points.  
j Optional PET/CT will be performed at selected sites. The CIV will analyze PET/CT scans if they are conducted.  
k Optional DCE -MRI will be performed at selected sites. The CIV will analyze PET/CT and DCE -MRI scans if they are conducted.  
l On Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycle 2, measurement s of total bilirubin, ALP, AST , and ALT  (as part of blood chemistry) must be obtained 
prior to  dosing (within 48 hours is acceptable) . Local laboratories may be used for these measurements. Dosing can only take place if total bilirubin, ALP, AST 
and ALT values  are within the ranges specified in the In clusion Criteria.  If a subject has any of these values outside the specified ranges on Day 1 of Cycle 2 , the 
Investigator should discuss further dosing plans for the subject with the Spons or. 
m Blood samples will be collected for testing of thyroid hormones (free T3, free T4, and TSH]) on Day 1 of Cycle 2 and every third cycle thereafter (i.e., Day 1 of 
Cycles 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, etc.).  
n Plasma samples for PEGPH20 immunogenicity will be dra wn prior to PEGPH20 dosing on day 1 of every cycle and end of treatment.  
o Optional post -dose tumor biopsy should be done at the end of Cycle 1 (on or after Day 18) but prior to 1st PEGPH20 dose in Cycle 2.  
p Piroxicam (20 mg) will be administered at least  1-2 hours prior to PEGPH20 administration on the day of dosing (timing will be at the Investigator’s discretion 
based on the piroxicam manufacturer’s Prescribing Information and subject’s convenience) , to minimize the severity of MSEs . Prophylactic use of  a proton pump 
inhibitor  is mandated for all subjects  while receiving PEGPH20 (e.g. 20 mg omeprazole daily or over -the-counter [OTC] equivalent) .  
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 112  06 November 2017  q  PEGPH20 will be given in increasing doses (1.6, 2.2, 2.6, 3.0 and 4.0 µg/kg) in combination with 2 mg/kg pembrolizumab in the Dose Escalation portion of 
the study. If ≥2 subjects experience a DLT at the 1.6 µg/kg dose level, Cohort -1 will be opened and subjects will be dosed at 1.0 µg/kg. In the Dose Expansion 
portion of the study, PEGPH20 will be given at the RP2D identified in the Dose Escalation  portion of the study with 200 mg pembrolizumab.  
r  All NSCLC subjects will be given enteric -coated 81 mg of prophylactic  aspirin/day and all gastric adenocarcinoma sub jects will be given prophylactic 
enoxaparin 40 mg/day (pre-filled syringes of enoxaparin are  allowed) , for prophylaxis  of TE events,  given the high incidence seen in these tumor types .

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35 of 112  06 November 2017  4. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
4.1. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer  
Lung cancer accounts for about 27% of all cancer deaths and is by far the leadi ng cause of cancer 
death among both men and women. An estimated 158,040 deaths (86,380 in men and 71,660 in 
women) are expected to occur in 2015 in the United States (US) alone . Although the incidence 
rate has been declining in recent times for both men and women, the American Cancer Society’s 
estimates that 221,200 new cases of lung cancer (115,610 in men and 105,590 in women) will be diagnosed in the US in 2015 ( American Cancer Society  2015) . 
Lung cancers are broadly classified into two types: small cell lung cancers (13%) and non- small 
cell lung cancers (NSCLC) (83%) for the purposes of treatment  (American Cancer Society  2015) . 
NSCLC, which arises from the epithelial cells of the lung of the central bronchi to terminal alveoli, is the most common type of lung cancer. The main types of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma 
(approximately 50% of cases), squamous cell (approximately 30% of cases), large cell 
(approximately 10% of ca ses) and bronchia l alveolar carcinoma (now classif ied as 
adenocarcinoma in situ).  
The prognosis for NSCLC is poor  (Jemal 2011) , and at least 50% of patients treated for early 
stage disease will go on to experience progression or relapse to advanced disease  (Sculier 2009 ). 
Seventy percent of patients present with advanced stage disease, for which the response rate to 
current standard combination chemotherapy is only 20% to 25%, and median survival is 10 to 
12 months  (Gupta 2014) . Clearly a plateau has been reached with traditional chemotherap y and 
further progress will depend upon identifying novel methods to target tumor cells . 
Harnessing the human immune system to target lung cancer could result in the development of effective treatment options against lung cancer and potentially enhance the  effect of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy.  
4.2. Gastric adenocarcinoma  
Gastric cancer was the world’s third leading cau se of cancer mortality in 2012 and was 
responsible for 723,000 deaths  worldwide  that year ( Bass  2014) . Although its incidence and 
mortality has declined since then , the American Cancer  Society estimates that  there will be 
24,590 new cases of gastric ca ncer reported in the US in 2015 along with 10,720 deaths  
(American Cancer Society  2015) . Gastric  adenocarcinoma  is a malignant epithelial tumo r, 
originating from glandular epithelium of the gastric  mucosa. Ninety percent of all tumors of the 
stomach are malignant, and gastric adenocarcinoma comprises 95% of the total number of 
malignancies  (Dicken  2005) . 
The survival rates for gastric cancer are among the worst of any solid tumor  (Yang  2011) . For 
early -stage cancer, surgical resection remains the mainstay  of curative -intent treatment 
(Wang  2015) . Despite the success of modern chemotherapy in the treatment of large bowel 
cancers, t he 5-year survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer is 3.1% . The role of surgery 
is also limited  in advanced gastric cancer  as only 23% of stage IV gastric cancer patients 
receiving a palliative gastrectomy  are alive one year after surgery  (Yang  2011) . 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 of 112  06 November 2017  Current management strategies and treatments are limited primarily by lack of specificity to the 
cancer cells and b y general treatment toxicities that limit full delivery of anticancer agents 
(Wang  2015). For these reasons, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed.  
4.3. Hyaluronan and Malignancy  
Hyaluronan (HA) is a high- molecular -mass polysaccharide found in the extracellular matrix of 
tumors. Accumulation of HA in several malignant disease s is associated with aggressive tumor 
type, cancer progression/metastasis , and poor prognosis ( Toole 2008;  Sironen 2011) . Interaction 
of pericellular HA and CD44 has been shown to influence drug resistance  (Misra 2003). Local 
aberrations of HA metabolism have been reported in many solid tumor malignancies, where 
elevated  levels of HA frequently correl ate with poor prognosis in tumors such as pancreatic 
(Kultti 2012;  Whatcott 2011), breast ( Auvinen 2000), gastric ( Setälä 1999 ), colorectal 
(Ropponen 1998), ovarian ( Anttila  2000) , prostate  (Bharadwaj 2009)  and lung carcinoma  
(Chow  2010) . Further information about HA in lung cancer is provided in Section 4.6.3. 
4.4. PEGylated Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase PH20 
Halozyme, Inc. (Halozyme) has developed an investigational new molecular entity, PEGylated recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (PEGPH20), which uses a novel mechanism of action 
to systemically target tumors that accumulate HA. In preclinical models, both tumor xenografts 
in immunocompromised mice and autochthonous tumors from genetically engineered 
KrasLSL -
G12D/þ; Trp53LSL-R172H/þ; Cre (KPC) mice, depletion of HA from the tumor microenvironment  
(TME)  has been shown to inhibit the growth of tumors character ized by accumulation of HA 
(Thompson 2010;  Jiang 2012;  Provenzano 2012;  Jacobetz 2013 ). 
The PH20 recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) enzyme is a soluble domain of the endogenous human PH20 glycoprotein, devoid of its carboxy- terminal, lipid anchor attachment 
site. To increase the plasma half -life and enable systemic therapeutic exposure not possible with 
existing recombinant human PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme developed a PEGylated version of PH20. Like rHuPH20, PEGPH20 removes HA from the extra cellular matrix by depolymerizing 
the substrate ( Thompson 2010). In ma ny different tumor types tested in murine xenograft 
models, response to PEGPH20 has been shown to be more robust for tumors characterized by 
higher HA accumulation ( Jiang 2012). PEGPH20 has a terminal plasma half -life of 
approximately 3.2 hours in rodents and 50 hours in monkeys. In humans, data from 2 subjects 
dosed with 50 μg/kg PEGPH20 in Study HALO- 109-101 demonstrated a plasm a half -life of 
2.5 to  4.8 hours for the initial phase and 26 to 49 hours (1 to  2 days) for the term inal phase (as 
compared with < 5 min for  rHuPH20  intravenous (IV) hyaluronidase [ Wolf  1982] ). The increased 
plasma half -life of PEGPH20 makes sustained depletion of tumor -associated HA feasible. 
4.4.1. PEGPH20 and C hemotherapy  
Enzymatic HA depletion from the TME, with PEGPH20 either alone or in combinati on with 
chemotherapy, represen ts an innovative potential treatment that could provide improved 
therapeutic outcomes for patients ( Pillwein 1998;  Baumgartner 1998;  Klocker 1998), based on a 
reduction in interstitial fluid pressure, and the subseque nt vascular decompression, increased 
blood volume, and concomitantly  enhanced drug penetration into HA -rich tumors ( Spruss 1995, 
Brekken 1998;  Eikenes 2005;  Thompson 2010), and on the reduction of tumor HA levels, which 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 112  06 November 2017  was reported to reduce in vitro tumor cell proliferation, motility , and invasion, and to reduce the 
growth of implanted tumors ( Shuster 2002;  Simpson 2002;  Kim 2004;  Nishida 2005;  
Udabage  2005;  Li 2007;  Thompson 2010;  Provenzano 2012;  Jacobetz 2013 ). 
In the autochthonous KPC pancreatic model, PEGPH20 treatment induced fenestrations and 
interendothelial junctional gaps in pancreatic endothelia ( Jacobetz 2013 ). Independent studies in 
the same model reported that the increased vascular perfusion observed when PEGPH20 is given 
in combination with gemcitabine (GEM) persisted for weeks after therapy ceased, suggesting 
that the TME was permanently remodeled following PEGPH20 treatment ( Provenzano 2012;  
Provenzano 2013). In mouse pancreatic xenografts, PEGPH20 treatment induced translocation of 
E-cadherin  and β -catenin to the plasma membrane of cancer cells, suggesting at least a partial 
reversal of the classic epithelial -mesenchymal transition (EMT) observed during the progression 
of malignancy ( Kultti 2014 ). Finally, in NSC LC patient -derived xenografts (PDx) the antitumor 
effect of PEGPH20 in combination with docetaxel (Doc) (Taxotere®) was evaluated  
(Halozyme Report  13036 ). In HA -high PDx tumors, PEGPH20 enhanced the effect of Doc, 
increasing tumor growth inhibition from 52.5% for Doc alone to 115% for PEGPH20 plus Doc, while concomi tantly increasing survival by 50% (35d for Doc alone vs 70d for PEGPH20 plus 
Doc).  
4.5. Clinical Experience with PEGPH20 and Clinical Development Plan  
PEGPH20 is being developed as an investigational, novel therapeutic agent for use in combination with chemothe rapy or other agents for the treatment of patients with cancers that 
accumulate HA. As of  13 February 2016, approximately 238 subjects had been exposed to at 
least 1 dose of PEGPH20 in 6 Sponsor clinical studies: in 2 Phase 1 studies as a single agent (HAL O-109-101 and HALO -109-102), in combination with chemotherapy in a Phase 1b study in 
pancreatic cancer (HALO -109-201), in combination with chemotherapy in a Phase 2 study in 
pancreatic cancer (HALO -109-202), in combination with chemotherapy in a Phase 1b s tudy in 
lung cancer (HALO -107-201) and in combination with a n immunotherapeutic drug 
pembrolizumab in this Phase 1b study in lung cancer (HALO- 107-101). The clinical 
development program also includes a n ongoing Phase 3 study of PEGPH20 in combination with 
chemotherapy in HA -high subjects with pancreatic cancer . 
4.5.1. Phase 1 Study HALO -109-101 
This study enrolled 14 subjects with advanced malignancies (including one subject with NSCLC) who experienced disease progression after previous therapy. This study was ame nded due to the 
observation of severe musculoske letal events (MSEs) and was closed due to these events and 
inability to dose escalate . 
4.5.2. Phase 1 Study HALO -109-102 
This study was initiated to evaluate the safety profile of PEGPH20 using the regimen of once or twice weekly PEGPH20 administration. Dexamethasone (pre - and post -PEGPH20 doses) was 
added to the regimen to alleviate musculoskeletal toxicities. PEGPH20 doses administered ranged from 0.5 to 5.0 μg/kg either once or twice weekly (Days  1 and 4) schedule  for the first 
cycle (4 weeks) and once per week for subsequent cycles. In addition, subjects received 4 or 
8 mg dexamethasone 1 hour prior to and 8 to 12 hours after PEGPH20 administration. A total of 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 of 112  06 November 2017  26 subjects enrolled in this study, six were treated at 3.0 µg/kg once weekly and 15 received 
3.0 µg/kg twice weekly schedule. The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) was determined to be 
3.0 µg/kg once or twice weekly.  
4.5.3. Phase 1b Study HALO -109-201 
This study was initiated to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose  (RP2D)  of PEGPH20 in 
combination with GEM ( Gemzar®) in subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer. A total of 
28 subjects were treated with PEGPH20 administered by IV infusion twice per week for the first 
4 weeks, then weekly for three weeks, followed by one week rest. GEM was administered at  
1000 mg/m2 intravenously over 30 minutes once per week for 7 weeks followed by one week 
rest. Dexamethasone was used 1  hour pre and 8 hours post PEGPH20 dosing. From Cycle 2 
onward, PEGPH20 and GEM were administered once weekly for three weeks in a 4 -week cycle.  
4.5.4. Phase 2 Study HALO -109-202 
This is an ongoing Phase 2 multicenter, o pen-label, randomized study which 
enrolled/randomized a total of 279 subjects with Stage IV previously untreated pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDA) who are receiv ing either PEGPH20 combined with nab- paclitaxel ( NAB ) 
plus GEM  (PAG  treatment) or NAB plus GEM  (AG treatment ). The study is blinded to the 
Sponsor .  
In April 2014, the HALO -109-202 Data Monitoring committee (DMC) reported an imbalance in 
TE events with a higher incidence in subjects treated with PAG than AG therapy alone (28.4% vs. 14.8%, respectively). Based on these findings, the study was placed on a temporary clinical hold. All 29 ongoing subjects in the PAG group stopped PEGPH20 therapy and remained on AG  
therapy alone. In June 2014, the temporary clinical hold was lifted and the study protocol was amended to: (1) include concomitant use of prophylactic enoxaparin for all subjects, (2) requirement to discontinue PEGPH20 permanently after a TE event occurre d, and (3) exclude 
subjects with evidence of DVT or pulmonary embolism as well as those subjects determined to be at high risk of TE events  s. Stage  1 of this study includes subjects who were enrolled prior to 
the clinical hold (N  = 146 randomized). Stage  2 is ongoing and includes subjects enrolled after 
the clinical hold and subsequent protocol amendment (N  = 133 randomized). 
A data analysis was performed as of a data cut of 16  December  2016. Interim safety and efficacy 
data from this study are presented in Section 4.5.7 Safety  and Section  4.5.8 Efficacy . 
4.5.5. Phase 1b Study HALO -107-201 
This was a Phase 1b/2, randomized, multicenter s tudy of PEGPH20 in s ubjects with r ecurrent  
previous ly treated locally a dvanced or m etastatic NSCLC  receiving either PEGPH20 combined 
with Doc  or Doc alone.   
The study was designed to have  a Phase 1b D ose Escalation portion and a Safety Evaluation 
portion, in all comers (i.e., subjects not selected based on HA status), and a Cohort Expansion portion in prospectively selected HA -high subjects  followed by a Phase 2 portion.  
In the Phase 1b Dose Escalation  portion, approximately 3 to 6 subjects/ cohort were to receive 
PEGPH20 at each increasing dose level (1.6, 2.2, 2.8 and 3.0 µg/kg) once/cycle in combination with standard dosing of docetaxel (75  mg/m
2 every 21 days). Additional Safety Evaluation (in up 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 112  06 November 2017  to 20 subjects) and Cohort Expansion portions (in up to 50 subjects) were to further evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of PEGPH20 in combination with docetaxel (PDoc) treatment before 
initiating Phase  2. Safety and preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) results from all subjects dosed 
in Phase  1b were to be used to determine the RP2D for the Phase 2 portion. In Phase 2, 
approximately 188 subjects prospectively selected for high HA level s were planned to be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive PDoc at the PEGPH20 dose selected in Phase 1b or docetaxel alone (Doc; 75 mg/m
2 once in each 21 -day cycle).  
This study was terminated during the Dose Escalation portion due to evolving standard -of-care 
in the NSCLC treatment landscape.  At the time of termination , 16 subjects had been enrolled in 
the Dose Escalation portion, of which 15 were dosed at 3 different dose levels  of PEGPH20   
(1.6, 3.0, and 2.2 µg/kg). Results are pending analys is at the time of  writing this protocol 
amendment . TE event data are given in Section  4.5.7.2. Additional information is provided in the 
PEGP H20 Investigator’s Brochure . 
4.5.6. Phase 3 Study HALO -109-301 
This is an ongoing randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter study of PEGPH20 
(3.0 μg/kg) in combination with NAB (125 mg/m2) plus GEM (1000 mg/m2) (PAG treatment) 
compared with placebo pl us NAB and GEM (AG treatment) in 420 and up to 570 subjects with 
HA-high S tage IV previously untreated PDA.  
Eligible subjects are randomized in a double -blind fashion to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 
2:1 ra tio for PAG:AG. Randomization is stratified by geographic region (North America, 
Europe, and Others).  
The Treatment Period consist s of 4-week treatment cycles (28 days), with Week 4 of every cycle 
being a rest week (i.e., no treatment is given). PEGPH20 or  placebo  is administered as an IV 
infusion twice weekly for Weeks 1 to 3 of Cycle 1, then once weekly for Weeks 1 to 3 of Cycle 2 
and beyond; NAB and GEM  is administered as IV infusions once weekly for Weeks 1 to 3 of all 
treatment cycles.  
4.5.7. Safety  
In more than approximately 238 subjects exposed to PEGPH20, either in the monotherapy or 
combination setting  in Sponsor clinical studies , the most frequently reported adverse events  
(AEs) are fatigue, cytopenia (anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia), gastrointestinal events 
(nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea), and peripheral oedema. In addition to these common AEs, 
both MS events (primarily muscle spasms and myalgias) and thromboembolic ( TE) events are 
considered identified risks of PEGPH20. Each of thes e AEs remain manageable with supportive 
therapy, considering the low rate (14%) of discontinuation due to any study drug related AE. Please refer to the Inves tigator’s B rochure for additional safety information.  
4.5.7.1. Musculoskeletal Events  
Prior to the initiation of study HALO -109-102, MSEs had been as severe as Grade 3/4; however, 
since the use of pre-  and post -dose prophylaxis with dexamethasone  in studies of PEGPH20 in 
combination with chemotherapy, the majority are Grade 1/2 in severity and, in general, have  not 
led to treatment discontinuations.  Since this study uses an immunotherapeutic agent  and 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 112  06 November 2017  dexamethasone may suppress an immune response , it should only be used when prescribed by 
the Investigator and following a discussion with the Sponsor . 
Piroxicam and toradol have been investigated in an animal model of MSEs and may be helpful in 
decreasing the severity of  MSEs in subject s (internal unpublished Halozyme report). In this 
study, piroxicam will therefore be administered to decrease the severi ty of MSE’s ; toradol  may 
be given for severe pain as recommended in the Prescribing Information (see Section  10.12 for 
additional details).  
4.5.7.2. Thromboe mbolic Events  
Thromboembolic events and their sequelae have been observed in clinical studies evaluating PEGPH20 monotherapy and combination therapies.  
In the 2 completed Phase 1 studies of PEGPH20 monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid 
tumors  (HALO- 109-101 and HALO -109-102; N  = 40), TE events were observed in 1 subject  
who experienced embolism . 
In the Phase 1b Study HALO- 107-201 in NSCLC, which was di scontinued early by the Sponsor 
in August  2016 due to the changing treatment landscape for NSC LC, up to the date of study 
discontinuation, 4 of 15 (27%) treated subjects experienced a TE event , including deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT) and superficial thrombophlebitis.  
In completed Study HALO -109-201 of PEGPH20 in combination with gemcitabine in pancreatic 
cancer, the incidence of TE events was approximately 2 8%, the majority being of venous origin.  
Regarding the Phase 2 Study HALO -109-202 in pancreatic cancer, as discussed in Section  4.5.4, 
an imbalance was observed in the rate of TE events between the PAG and AG treatment arms 
(28.4% vs. 14.8%)  in Stage 1 of the study that  led to the implementation of risk mitigation 
measures , including the exclusion of high- TE event risk subjects and the administration of 
enoxaparin prophylaxis in all subjects . The majority of the TE events were of venous origin 
(DVT and pulmonary embolism ); however, arterial events were also reported. It is widely 
accepted that pancreatic cancer is a tum or type with a high TE event background rate. Published 
studies have reported a  TE event incidence in these patients  ranging from 17% to 57.7% 
(Khorana 2004;  Bapat  2016
). 
Since the implementation of the aforementioned measures in Stage 2 of HALO -109-202, the 
incidence of TE events has decreased considerably compared with that observed in Stage 1. Based on an analysis as of a data cutoff of 16 December 2016, the TE rate in the PAG and AG groups , respectively, decreased from 43% and 25% in Stage 1 (no enoxaparin prophylaxis) to 
10% and  6% in Stage 2 (with enoxaparin 1 mg/kg/day prophylaxis ). Additional details are 
provided in the PEGPH20 Investigator’s Brochure. 
While the rate of TE events in pancreatic cancer is reported to be highest among malignancies 
(Pelzer  2015), rates of TE events in NSCLC and gast ric cancer have also  been reported to be 
elevated ( Chew  2008 an d Khorana  2012, respectively ). Based on these data,  the following safety 
measures  will be taken to safeguard subjects : 
1. Subjects with a history of or presence of a pulmonary embolism at baseline will be 
excluded from this trial . 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 112  06 November 2017  2. All NSCLC s ubjects will be given enteric- coated  81 mg of prophylactic aspirin/day and 
all gastric adenocarcinoma subjects will be given prophylactic enoxaparin 40 mg /day for 
TE event prophylaxis , given the high incidence seen in t hese tumor types , and closely 
monitored. PEGPH20 will be discontinued for subjects who e xperience any TE requiring 
full-dose anti coagulation while on study. Treatment with pembrolizumab, however , may 
continue as deemed appropriate by the Investigator . 
3. In gastric adenocarcinoma subjects , if enoxaparin is discontinued for any reason, 
PEGPH20 will also be discontinued. Treatment with pembrolizumab, however, may 
continue as deemed appropriate by the I nvestigator. 
4. Sites will report any TE event to the Sponsor immediately and no later than  24 hours of 
awareness.  
4.5.8. Efficacy  
In the Phase 1b  study (HALO -109-201) in subjects with pancreatic cancer , responses were 
assessed by an independent centra l radiologist. Partial Response (PR)  was reported in 10 of the 
24 subjects  who received PEGPH20 at either  the 1.6 or 3.0 µg/kg dose level. In addition, 
subjects who had HA high in tissue biopsies experienced better responses (5/6 subjects), which correlated with prolonge d progression- free survival ( PFS; 219 days) and overall survival ( OS; 
approximately 395 days). PRs  were seen in 4 of the 11  subjects who had lower HA in tissue 
biopsies. The PFS and OS in the low -HA group were 108 days and 174 days, respectively  
(Hingorani 2015).  Further details about efficacy in early studies are provided in the PEGPH20 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
Halozyme has developed, in collaboration with a leading diagnostic company, Ventana Medical Systems , Inc., a novel c o-developed investigational diagnostic  assay (VENTANA HA RxDx 
assay [RxDx]) to identify subjects who might benefit most, based on HA tumor content, from the 
administration of PEGPH20 in conjunction with other cancer therapeutics. This assay uses an 
affinity -histochemistry -based staining method to evaluate HA levels in tumor biopsi es.  
For Phase 2 HALO -109-202, a data analysis was performed as of a data cut of 
16 December  2016. Tumor samples from were collected and analyzed in a  
prospective -retrospective fashion using the RxDx assay. As of the data cutoff date, of the 
279 subjects comprising the ITT Population, 97% (270/279) of subjects in the Stage  1 + Stage 2 
combined were off treatment. Efficacy results for the combined Stage 1 + Stage 2 ITT HA -high 
Population (n = 84 [49 PAG, 35 AG]) indicate a statistically significant 77% impr ovement in 
PFS, with a median of 9.2 months for PAG vs. 5.2 months for AG (HR: 0.51; p- value: 0.048). 
Despite the limitations of the Stage  1 data set due to the clinical hold (e.g., subjects discontinuing 
PEGPH20 and continuing on AG alone), there was a 35% improvement in median OS  which was  
11.5 months with PAG  vs. 8.5 months with AG (HR: 0.96). 
Based on the data from the Stage 2 population in HA -high subjects (median PFS and OS 
4.5 months and 7.8 months, respectively) vs. HA -low subjects (7.2 months and 10.2 months, 
respectively) within the AG group, HA -high tumors may have a worse prognosis when treated 
with the standard of care AG therapy, suggesting that high levels of HA are a potential negative prognostic biomarker in PDA and supporting the rationale for the addition of PEGPH20 treatment to anti- cancer therapies in PDA. The substantial improvements seen with PAG, 
compared with AG, in both median PFS and median OS in the Stage 2 HA -high population 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 112  06 November 2017  confirm the hypothesis of HA being a potential predictive biomarker for subject selection for 
PEGPH20 treatment. Additional details are provided in the PEGPH20 Investigator’s Brochure.  
4.5.9. Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
Subjects enrolled in the Phase 1 studies received PEGPH20 at doses ranging from 0.5 to 
50 μg/kg with or without dexamethasone. Blood samples were collected at scheduled time 
points , and plasma was analyzed for PEGPH20 concentrations. PK analysis suggests that a linear 
PK model adequately described the available PEGPH20 plasma concentration versus time 
profiles. The maximum plasma concentrations were estimated to be between 0.4 and 1.0 hours 
after dosing. Subjects dosed with 50 μg/kg PEGPH20 in Study HALO- 109-101 demonstrated a 
plasma half -life of 2.5  to 4.8 hours for the initial phase and 26 to 49 hours (1 to 2 days) for the 
terminal phase. Estimates for initial distribution volume were consistent with expectations for therapeutic macromolecules. The prolonged plasma half -life of PEGPH20 makes sustained 
depletion of tumor -associated HA feasible. Clinical ex perience to date (largely involving 
combination therapy with GEM ) indicates that the linear PK characteristics of PEGPH20 given 
alone are maintained in combination therapy. Details of the PK characteristics of PEGPH20 are provided in the PEGPH20 Investigat or’s Brochure.  
4.6. Study Rationale  
Therapy with m Abs directed against multiple check -point receptors involved in the immune 
response (e.g. cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -associated protein 4 [CTLA -4], programmed cell 
death‑1 [PD -1] and PD -1 ligand 1 [PD -L1]) has changed the treatment paradigm for advanced 
melanoma and NSCLC. However, when used as single agents, in advanced pre viously treated 
NSCLC  patients , these compounds have low er response rates (<25%) and may have considerable 
systemic toxicity  (Brahmer  2012;  Brahmer  2014;  Garon  2015) . These compounds are currently 
either approved or in development by pharmaceutical companies for numerous indications including NSCLC, renal cell cancer, head and neck cancer and lymphom a. The rationale for 
combining PEGPH20 with such immunotherapies is based on nonclinical data indicating that addition of PEGPH20 to such therapies leads to increased accessibility of natural killer (NK) cells to HA -high tumor cells in vitro  and in vivo , increased accessibility of antibodies to HA -high 
tumor cells (e.g. trastuzumab [Herceptin
®]), increased antibody- dependent killing of HA -high 
tumor cells in vitro  (e.g. trastuzumab and cetuximab [ErbituxTM], increased antibody-  and NK -
dependent tumor growth inhibition in xenograft models  (Singha  2015) , increased tumor growth 
inhibition of anti -CTLA4 in a syngeneic murine colon cancer model ( unpublished internal 
report ) and increased accumulation of a salmonella -based therapeutic and neutrophils in 
orthotopic pancreatic tumors  (Manuel  2014) . 
This Phase 1b study will test the safety and early biological activity of PEGPH20 combi ned with 
the immunotherapeutic m Ab pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) (the combination is hereafter referred 
to as PEGPEM) in subjects with HA -high solid tumors. 
4.6.1. Pembrolizumab for T reatment of NSCLC  
Platinum- based c hemotherapy, with or without  maintenance t herapy, subsequently followed by 
second -line cytotoxic chemotherapy, is standard treatment for most patients  with advanced   
non-small cell lung cancer, with a median survival  of approximately 1 year. One hallmark of 
cancer is immune evasion,  in which the immune system does not mount an effective antitumor 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 112  06 November 2017  response. PD -1 is a negative costimulatory receptor  expressed primarily on the surface of 
activated  T-cells. The binding of PD -1 to one of its ligands, PD -L1 or PD -L2, can inhibit a 
cytotoxic T -cell response. Tumors can co -opt this pathway to escape T -cell–induced antitumor 
activity. Pembrolizumab,  a highly selective, humanized monoclonal  IgG4 kappa isotype 
antibody against PD -1, can disrupt the engagement of PD -1 with its  ligands and impede 
inhibitory signals in T -cells,  with resultant tumor recognition by cytotoxic  T-cells.  
The efficacy and safety  of PD -1 inhibition with pembrolizumab  was assessed  in patients with 
advanced NSCLC in a P hase 1 study in which 495 patients were assigned to recei ve 
pembrolizumab at a dose of either 2 mg or 10 mg per kg of body weight every 3 weeks or 10 mg 
per kg every 2 weeks  (Garon  2015) . The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the 
safety, side -effect profile , and antitumor activity of pembrolizumab. The study also sought to 
define and validate an expression l evel of the PD -L1 that is associated with the likelihood of 
clinical benefit.  
Among all the patients, the ORR observed was 19.4%, and the median duration of response (DOR) was 12.5 months. The median PFS was 3.7 months, and the medi an OS was 12.0 months. 
PD-L1 expression in at least 50% of tumor cells was selected as the cutoff. Among patients with 
a proportion score of at least 50% the response rate was 45.2%. Among all the patients with a proportion score of at least 50%, m edian PFS was 6.3 months; media n OS  was not reached . 
Common side effects attributed to pembrolizumab were fatigue, pruritus, and decreased appetite.  
In conclusion, pembrolizumab ha d an acceptable side- effect profile and showed antitumor 
activity in patients with advanced non- small -cell lung cancer. PD -L1 expression in at least 50% 
of tumor cells correlated with improved efficacy of pembrolizumab.  
4.6.2. Pembrolizumab for T reatment of G astric A denocarcinoma  
Treatment choices for gastric cancer depend on tumor type and stage. The only hope for cure 
currently rests on removal of the malignant tissue either endoscopically or by surgical resection. For advanced disease, treatment is largely palliative and consists of a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Overall, the resul ts of current therapy for advanced disease are 
poor with low 5 years survivals. Immunotherapy provides another dimension to the prevention and management of gastric cancer and offers hope of breaking through current constraints  
(Matsueda 2014) . 
The safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab was assessed in a phase 1b study in patients with advanced gastric cancer in KEYNOTE -012 (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . Using a 
prototype immunohistochemistry assay, PD -L1 expression was assessed in archival tumor 
samples from patients with recurrent/metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroes ophageal junction. Eligible patients with PD -L1 staining in stroma or ≥ 1% of tumor cells 
were enrolled and treated with pembrolizumab 10mg/kg every 2 weeks for up to 24 months or 
until complete response (CR) , disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. AEs were monitored 
and graded per the National Cancer Institute Common T erminology Criteria for Adverse Events  
(NCI CTCAE c4.0 ). Radiographic imaging was performed every 8 weeks. Primary efficacy 
endpoint was ORR assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  (RECIST ) v1.1.  
Of the 162 patient s screened, 65 (40%) were PD -L1 positive . Of these 65 patients, 39 enrolled. 
The number of prior therapies for advanced disease ranged from 0 to 5; 67% received ≥2 prior therapies. Median follow -up duration was 8.8 months (range 6.2- 12.6); 13 patients (33%) remain

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 of 112  06 November 2017  on therapy. Four patients experienced 5 total grade 3 -5 drug- related adverse events: peripheral 
sensory neuropathy, fatigue, decreased appetite, hypoxia, and pneumonitis (n = 1 each). There 
was 1 drug- related death (hypoxia). ORR was 22% (95% CI 10- 39) by central revi ew and 33% 
(95% CI 19- 50) by Investigator  review. Median time to response was 8 weeks (range 7 -16), with 
a median response duration of 24 weeks (range 8+ to 33+). PD -L1 expression level was 
associated with ORR (1 -sided  P = 0.10). The 6- month PFS rate was 2 4%. The 6- month OS rate 
was 69%.  
In conclusion, pembrolizumab demonstrated manageable toxicity and promising antitumor activity in advanced gastric cancer  patients selected for PD -L1 expression using a prototype 
immunohistochemistry assay . These results s upport the ongoing development of pembrolizumab 
for gastric cancer  (Muro  2015) . 
The safety and efficacy of nivolumab, another anti -PD-1 antibody was assessed in 7 patients 
with advanced gastric cancer, unselected for PD -L1 expression, in a multicenter phase 1 trial. No 
objective responses were observed in the gastric cancer patients ( Brahmer  2012).  
4.6.3. Use of PEGPH20 in HA -high T umors  
The degradation of tumor -associated HA is hypothesized to increase the ability of anti -cancer 
agents to penetrate tumor tissue and, therefore increase cytotoxic activity in tumors. In tumors that are rich in HA, as is the case for NSCLC and gastric cancer , tumor tissue may be especially 
sensitive to the HA -degradation by PEGPH20 and thus responsive to an increase in the 
immunotherapeutic effects  of pembrolizumab. Modifying the extracellular environment to 
increase the penetration and efficacy of immunotherapeutics  represents a novel approach to 
treating  NSCLC  and gastric adenocarcinoma in a setting that has demonstrated preliminary  
therapeutic ef ficacy.  
In addition to increasing tumor perfusion, and subsequently increasing the accumulation of 
therapeutics, PEGPH20- mediated HA removal alone has been shown in preclinical models to 
significantly inhibit tumor growth; the magnitude of the PEGPH20 anti tumor activity correlating 
with the magnitude of tumor HA accumulation ( Thompson 2010;  Jiang 2012
). Further, HA 
removal appears to be associated with sustained changes in tumor vascular architecture and a 
reduction of EMT tumor markers (Provenzano 2012;  Jacobetz 2013;  Kultti 2014 ). 
In an investigation of the HA accumulation profile in  human lung cancer using commercially 
available human tissue microarray (n=117, US Biomax ), high levels of HA accumulation were 
found in 29% of NSCLC cancer tissues with the highest levels of (41%) of HA in squamous tumor type (HA  high accumulation [HA -high] was found in 33% of large cell carcinomas and 
11% of adenocarcinomas ; Jiang 2011
). In an investigation of human tissue microarray of gastric 
adenocarcinoma , high levels of HA accumulation were found in 42% of the gastric 
adenocarcinoma tissues  (Jacobetz 2013 ). 
In an investigation of the antitumor activity of PEGPH20 (single -agent and in combination with 
therapeutically relevant drug regimens) in NSCLC HA -high expressing human tumor explant 
models, the antitumor activity of PEGPH20 corresponded to the extent of HA in the tumor, and 
tumor growth inhibition responses were 97% for HA -high tumors, 44% for medi um-HA tumors, 
and 16% for low -HA tumors  (Jiang 2012 ). 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45 of 112  06 November 2017  In an animal  study combining PEGPH20 with cisplatin and GEM  (indicated for the first -line 
treatment of patients with inoperable, locally advanced [Stage IIIA or IIIB], or m etastatic 
[Stage IV] NSCLC ( GEMZAR® Product Insert ), in HA- high patient -derived xenograft  models of 
NSCLC, PEGPH20 administered 24 hours before combination chemotherapy inhibited tumor 
growth by 76.6% (ΔT/ΔC=23.4%, p < 0.01), whereas the combination of cisplatin and GEM  
alone was not significant.  In an animal study combining PEGPH20 with Doc  (indicated for 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of prior platinum- based 
chemotherapy ( Joshi 2014; TAXOTERE® Product Insert ), co-administration of PEGPH20 with 
Doc increased  Doc growth inhibition from 52% (p < 0.01) to 116% (p < 0.0001), and increased 
the median survival time  2-fold (35 days with Doc alone compared with 70 days with Doc plus 
PEGPH20). Further details of these studies are provided in the PEGPH20 Inves tigator’s  
Brochure.  
4.6.4. Rationale for Dose Selection  
Rationale for PEGPH20 Dose Selection  
A dose of 3.0 μg/kg was identified as the MTD for PEGPH20 as either a single agent or in 
combination with GEM in 3 separate trials (2 Phase 1 and 1 Phase 1b clinical study). In the phase 1 trial Study HALO -109-101, PEGPH20 was administered once every 21 da ys. In the 
phase 1 trial , Study HALO- 109-102, PEGPH20 was administered twice per week for the first 
4 weeks followed by once a week for the following 4- week cycles (no washout in week 4). In the 
phase 1b trial , Study HALO -109-201, PEGPH20 was administered twice weekly for the first 
4 weeks, then once weekly for 3  of every 4 weeks for the dur ation of subject participation.  
In an ongoing randomized Phase 2 study in subjects with advanced PDA, PEGPH20 is being 
administered at 3.0 µ g/kg twice weekly for 3 weeks  during the 1
st 4-week cycle, then weekly for 
3 of 4 weeks in subsequent cycles in combination with nab- paclitaxel at 125  mg/m2/week for 
3 of 4 weeks and GEM at 1000 mg/m2 weekly for 3 of 4 weeks.  
Since PEGPH20 has not been evaluated in clinical studies in combination with pembrolizumab, 
this study will have a Dose Escalation  portion in which PEGPH20 will be administered to 
consecutive cohorts in increasing doses  (1.6, 2.2, 2.6, 3.0, and 4.0 µg/kg) selected based on 
clinical judg ment , to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PEGPEM treatment before the D ose 
Expansion portion is initiated. The Dose Escalation  portion will also be used to determine the 
dose of PEGPH20 to be evaluated in the D ose E xpansion portion. 
Rationale for Pembroli zumab Dose Selection  in Dose Escalation  
Standard dosing of pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg) will be administered every 3 weeks in the Dose 
Escalation portion per the Pembrolizumab Prescribing Information ( Keytruda® US Prescribing 
Information  2015) (Protocol Amendment 2) .  
Rationale for Pembrolizumab Dose Selectio n in Dose Expansion  
A dose of 200 mg pembrolizumab will be administered every 3 weeks to NSCLC subjects in the Dose Expansion portion, per the Pembrolizumab Prescribing Information ( Keytruda
® US 
Prescribing Information 2017). The same dosage of pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) will 
also be administered to gastric adenocarcinoma subjects as it is being used in Phase 2 and Phase 
3 gastric adenocarcinoma trials evaluating pembrolizumab as a single agent or in combination

6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1. Overall Stu dy Design and Plan: Description  
This Phase  1b study of PEGPEM will consist of 2 portions:  
• A Dose Escalation portion in subjects with relapsed/refractory Stage  IIIB or IV 
NSCLC after failing at least 1 previous platinum- based chemotherapy regimen (refer 
to Inclusion C riteri on #2) and subjects with relapsed/refractory l ocally advanced or 
metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma after failing at least 1 previous chemotherapy 
regimen  for locally advanced or metastatic disease. 
• Followed by a Dose E xpansion portion in:  
− Previously untreated or treated HA -high subjects with Stage  IIIB or IV NSCLC . 
Previously treated subjects must have failed no more than 1 previous  platinum -based chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced or metastatic disease 
(refer to Inclusion C riterion #3) .  
− HA-high subjects with relapsed/refractory locally advanced or metastatic gastric 
adenocarcinoma  having failed no more than 2 previous chemotherapy regimens  
for locally advanced or metastatic disease.  
Note:  In Dose Expansion, subjects will be selected for enrollment whose tumors are HA -high, 
using a co- developed investigational diagnostic assay  (details in Section  8.2.17.1.3) . Subjects 
will be tested retrospectively for PD -L1 expression levels.  
The study design is depicted in Figure 1.  
Since PEGPH20 has not been evaluated in clinical studies in combination with pembrolizumab, this study will have a Dose Escalation  portion to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PEGPEM 
treatment before the D ose E xpansion portion is initiated. The Dose Escalation  portion will also 
be used to determine the dose of PEGPH20 to be evaluated in the D ose E xpansion portion. 
The treatment period will consist of 21 -day cycles.  
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 49 of 112  06 November 2017  In Dose Escalation, PEGPH20 will be administered on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of each 21- day 
cycle (i.e. 3 doses/cycle) and pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg every 21 days) on Day 1 of each cycle 
(i.e. 1 dose/cycle), 4- 6 hours after the completion of PEGPH20 administration.  
In Dose Expansion, 200 mg of pembrolizumab will be  administered every 21 days ( per Protocol 
Amendment 3 [see Section  4.6.4 for additional details ]) and the dosing schedule will be as 
follows:  
• PEGPH20 will be administered on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of each 21- day cycle 
(i.e. 3 doses/cycle) and pembrolizumab (200 m g every 21 days) on Day 1 of each 
cycle (i.e. 1 dose/cycle), 4- 6 hours after the  completion of PEGPH20 administration.  
In Dose Expansion, an independent DMC  will review all available safety data from the first 3 
NSCLC subjects and first 3 gastric adenocar cinoma subjects who have completed Cycle 1, to 
determine if the safety and tolerability profile of the PEGPEM combination is acceptable  (refer 
to the DMC charter for additional details) . The DMC will also continue to periodically review 
safety data to prot ect subject welfare and identify potential safety signals.  
Treatment in both portions of the study will continue until death, withdrawal of consent from the 
study, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity; however , subject s with asymptomatic 
disease p rogression will be allowed to continue study treatment at the Investigator ’s discretion 
despite evidence of increasing tumor burden or appearance of new lesions for up to 6 weeks if 
the subject is “clinically stable .” Clinically stable is defined as:  
• Absence of symptoms and signs indicating clinically significant PD (including 
worsening of laboratory values) indicating disease progression;  
• No decline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG) performance status; and  
• Absence of rapid progression of disease or of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (e.g., cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention. 
Dose interruptions and modifications of study treatment are permitted.  
In the single -agent studies of PEGPH20 and the combination study with GEM, the DLT s were 
MSEs  of myalgia and muscle cramping. In clinical studies  HALO- 109-102, HALO -109-201 and 
HALO- 109-202, dexamethasone was administered per protocol to attenuate the severity of  
MSEs . Since this study uses an  immunotherapeutic agent , and dexamethasone may suppress an 
immune response , it should only be used when prescribed by the Investigator  and following a 
discussion with the S ponsor ( Section  10.12.4) . 
Piroxicam and toradol have been investigated in an animal model of MSE s and may be helpful in 
decreasing the severity of MSEs  in subject s (internal unpublished Halozyme report) . Piroxicam 
(20 mg) will be administered  at least 1- 2 hours prior to PEGPH20 administration on the day of 
dosing (timing will be at the Investigator’s discretion based on the piroxicam manufacturer’s Prescribing Information and subject’s convenience) , to minimize the severity of MSEs . The 
prophylactic use of a proton pump inhibitor  is mandated for all subjects  while receiving 
PEGPH20 (e.g. 20 mg omeprazole daily or over -the-counter [OTC] equivalent). 
Toradol may be given for severe pain as recommended in the Toradol Prescribing Information (Section  10.12.1). Toradol should not be administered co ncurrently with piroxicam as it is 
contraindicated in the Prescribing Information to administer toradol simultaneously with other 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 50 of 112  06 November 2017  nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) because of the cumulative risk of inducing 
serious NSAID -related side effects.  
To help minimize MSEs,  prescribed medication such as narcotics, muscle relaxants and other 
analgesics (with the exceptions of steroids), OTC  drugs and physical therapy can be used at the 
Investigator’s discretion. 
All NSCLC subjects will be given enteric- coated 81 mg of prophylactic aspirin/day and all 
gastric adenocarcinoma subjects  will be given prophylactic enoxapari n 40 mg/day (pre -filled 
syringes of enoxaparin are allowed) , for prophylaxis of TE events, given the high incidence seen 
in these tumor types ( Section  10.12.2) . PEGPH20 will be discontinued for subjects who 
experience any TE requiring full -dose anti coagulation while on study. Treatment with 
pembrolizumab, however , may continue as deemed a ppropriate by the Investigator. 
In gastric adenocarcinoma subjects, if enoxaparin is discontinued for any reason, PEGPH20 will 
also be discontinued. Treatme nt with pembrolizumab, however, may continue as deemed 
appropriate by the Investigator. 
After discontinuing study treatment (PEGPH20 and pembrolizumab) , subjects will have an End 
of Treatment V isit and will enter the long -term follow -up for survival.  
Subjects will be assessed for AEs  and clinical laboratory evaluations as graded by the 
CTCAE  v 4.03. 
In both portions of the study, tumor response and progression based on RECIST  v 1.1 criteria 
(Eisenhauer 2009;  Appendix C ) and irRC ( Nishino 2013;  Nishino 2014;  Appendix E ) will be 
assessed by the Investigator  at the end of Cycle 2, Cycle 4 and then at the end of every fourth 
treatment cycle thereafter (i.e., Week 3 of Cycles 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and beyond). Scans may be 
obtained any time  on or  after Day 15 (of Cycles 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and every fourth treatment cycle 
thereafter) to allow enough time for the scan to be reviewed locally prior to the subject’s next 
scheduled dosing visit. A  confirmatory scan must be performed no sooner than 28 days after the 
initial scan that showed a response ( PR or CR)  based on RECIST v1.1 ( to determine the best 
overall response ) and irRC . A confirmatory scan should also be performed to confirm disease 
progression based on irRC no sooner than 28 days after the init ial scan that showed pr ogression.

This portion of the study is a single -arm, dose escalation study of PEGPH20 in combination with 
pembrolizumab subjects with relapsed/refractory NSCLC after failing at least 1 previous 
platinum -based therapy (refer to Inclusion C riterion #2) and subjects with relapsed/refractory 
gastric adenocarcinoma after failing at least 1 previous chemotherapy regimen. Using a standard 
3+3 dose escalation design, approximately 3 to 6 subjects in each cohort will receive PEGPH20 
+ pembrolizumab. PE GPH20 will be administered on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of each 21 -day 
cycle to consecutive cohorts in increasing dose  levels  (1.6, 2.2, 2.6, 3.0, and 4.0 µg/kg) . 
Pembrolizumab  will be administered  on Day 1 of each cycle, 4- 6 hours after  the dose of 
PEGPH20 . If the MTD is not reached at 4.0 µg/kg, higher doses may be evaluated. If ≥2 subjects 
experience a DLT at the 1.6 µg/kg dose level , Cohort - 1 will be opened and subject s will be 
dosed at 1.0 µg/kg on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of each 21- day cycle. The RP2D of PEGPH20 
will be the MTD determined in Dose Escalation or the Sponsor may decide to choose a dose 
lower than the MTD and which has completed evaluation in Dose Escalation and is found to be 
safe and tolerable to evaluate in Dose Expansion.  
The number of cohorts studied and number of subjects exposed to a given dose level will depend on the doses tested. It is anticipated that up to 5 dose levels will be studied for a total of 
approximately 30 subjects exposed to study medication. The dose allocation for 5 cohorts of 
subjects assigned to the 5  preselected dose levels  and 1 cohort assigned to the preselected dose of 
1.0 µg/kg ( if ≥2  subjects experience a DLT at 1.6 µg/kg  dose level ) is shown as an example in  
Table 4. The study medication dosing and treatment schedule  are shown in Table 5.  
Safety data from all subjects dosed will be reviewed to determine the RP2D. Dose escalation will be guided by safety data from each subject during the 21 days following their first dose of 
PEGPH20. Intra -subject dose escalation to the next PEGPH20 dose studied may be allowed if 
the Investigator deems it in the best interest of the subject and after discussion with the Sponsor 
and provided the next PEGPH20 dose studied has been determined not to have exceeded the MTD . 
• If none of 3 subjects  in a given cohort experience a DLT within 21 days of starting 
treatment , enrollment and dosing may  proceed at the next planned dose level. 
• If 1 of 3 subjects  at a given dose level experiences a DLT within the first 21 days of 
treatment, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled and dosed at the dose level at which the DLT occurr ed. If ≤1 of 6 subjects experience a DLT, dose escalation will continue 
to the next planned higher dose.  
• If ≥2 subjects at a given dose level experience a DLT within the first 21 days of treatment, that dose level will be considered to have exceeded the MT D and dose 
escalation will be stopped. If the previous dose level did not already have 6 subjects 
treated with ≤1 DLT, enrollment and dosing will then resume in the previous dose 
level with additional subjects up to a total of 6 subjects. The highest dose level at which no more than 1 of 6 evaluable subjects has experienced a DLT in the first 
3 weeks of treatment will be considered the MTD for the PEGPEM combination. The 
RP2D will be based on the overall safety profile.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 53 of 112  06 November 2017  • If ≥2 subjects at the 1.6 µg/kg dose level experience a DLT within the first 21 days of 
treatment,  Cohort - 1 will be opened at a lower dose level of 1.0 µg/kg. 
Note:  Additional subjects may be enrolled in each cohort to further assess the tolerability of 
PEGPEM and determine an acceptabl e safety profile prior to the enrollment in the next dose 
level and expansion portion of the study.

DLTs will be assessed for each subject during the 21 days following their first PEGPH20 dose and will be defined as any of the following:  
• Any treatment -emergent Grade ≥3 toxicity that is considered related to either 
PEGPH20 or pembrolizumab or the combination of PEGPH20  and pembrolizumab 
(nausea, vomiting, musculoskeletal events and diarrhea will be considered DLTs only if they reach ≥ Grade 3 despite adeq uate supportive care measures).  
• Grade 3 MSEs are considered DLTs only if they do not reduce to ≤ Grade 2 within 48 hours despite therapeutic intervention. 
• Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions related to PEGPH20 or pembrolizumab dosing 
will n ot be considered DLTs (hypersensitivity reactions are generally not related to 
the dose level of a drug since they can occur even upon a low level of exposure).  
To be considered evaluable for DLT assessment, subjects must receive 1 of the 3  full planned 
doses of PEGPH20 and 1 complete dose of pembrolizumab in Cycle 1 . Subjects who experience 
a DLT within the first 21 days of treatment and withdraw from the study will be considered evaluable for DLT and will not be replaced. Subjects who withdraw within the first 21 days for reasons other than a DLT will be considered not evaluable and will be replaced. Any PEGPH20 
treatment -related AE that results in interruption or reduction of either drug (PEGPH20 or 
pembrolizumab) may be considered a DLT at the Investigator ’s discret ion. 
The Sponsor and the participating Investigato rs will meet as soon as practical , post completion of 
a cohort, and no more than 10 business days after the end of the last cohort to determine an 
acceptable dose for the D ose E xpansion portion after reviewing all available safety data from 
Cycle 1 from al l subjects in the Dose Escalation  portion.

6.1.3. Study Duration  
The study will consist of a S creening period  of up to 28 days , a treatment period  (21-day cycles) , 
a 30-day post -treatment period (after last dose) for collection of AEs and a long- term follow -up. 
Subjects will be allowed to continue treatment on study until disease progression (as defined in 
Section  6.1.4) or unacc eptable toxicity.  Subjects with asymptomatic disease progression 
however, will be allowed to continue the study treatment at the Investigator’s discretion despite 
evide nce of increasing tumor burden or appearance of new lesions for up to 6 weeks if the 
subject is clinically stable.  
Investigators may also discontinue study treatment if it is no longer in the best interest of the subject. Subjects who discontinue treatment  with PEGPH2 0 and pembrolizumab will be 
followed every 12 weeks for survival until death, withdrawal of consent, or lost to follow -up.

Clinical tumor -related progression that is well documented in the absence of scans demonstrating 
radiographic disease progression. 
Radiographic disease progression is based on the  analysis of CT /MRI  scan s by the  Investigator . 
Investigators should continue study treatment until disease progression (not including 
asymptomatic disease progression in clinically stable subject s [see Section  6.1 for definition of 
clinically stable] ) has occurred, but may discontinue study treatment if there is documented 
clinical disease progression and/or unacceptable toxicity and/or study treatment  is no longer in

received, responses) will be obtained by the site once every 12 weeks . Long- term follow -up will 
continue until the subject dies, is lost to f ollow -up, or withdraws consent. 
8.1.3. Procedures for Study Treatment Discontinuation  
In the event of study treatment disco ntinuation, the subject should be instructed to report to the 
clinic as early as possible after the decision to discontinue  study treatment has been made or for 
the next scheduled clinic visit . When the subject returns to the clinic , all End of Treatment 
procedures should be conducted (see Section  8.1.2.3) . The Investigator  will make his or her best 
efforts to perform these procedures.  
8.2. Study Assessments  
8.2.1. Informed Consent  
The Investigator  or designee must present and explain the study protocol t o prospective study 
subjects  before  screening . The Investigator  or designee must be available to answer any 
questions the subject  may have regarding the study protocol and procedures . The Investigator  or 
designee must explain that the subject  is not obliged to enter the study and is free to withdraw 
from it at any time for any reason . If new safety information becomes available and results in 
significant changes in risk/benefit assessment, the ICF should be reviewed and updated if 
necessary . Under thi s circumstance, all subjects , including those already being treated, should be  
given the new information, given a copy of the revised ICF, and allowed to re -evaluate their 
consent to continue in the study.

8.2.1.1. Prescreening I nformed Consent  in Dose Expansion  
In accordance with local policies and institutional guidelines, subjects may provide consent for 
their tumor tissue to undergo HA test ing on a separate, prescreening ICF. Note: If the subject 
provides consent to participate in the study and undergoes the remaining screening procedures, 
the 28- day screening window will begin when the subject signs the study ICF (i.e., signature on a 
prescreening ICF does not initiate the screening window).  
8.2.2. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
The inclusion/exclusion criteria ( Sections 7.1 and  7.2) must be reviewed at s creening to ensure 
that the subject qualifies for the study. S ubjects  may be enrolled into the study if all selection

ECGs including clinical significance will be evaluated by the Investigator  and recorded in the 
eCRF.  
8.2.11. Hematology, Blood Chemistry , Glucose, Thyroid  Hormones , Coagulation 
Parameters, and Urinalysis  
Hematology, blood chemistry, blood glucose, thyroid hormone s, coagulation  parameters , and 
urinalysis will all be analyzed by the central  laboratory . In addition, local laboratories may be 
used if immediate clinical decision making is required  (e.g., for measurement of  liver function, 
including total bilirubin, ALP, AST and ALT prior to dosing [wi thin 48 hours is acceptable]  
during Cycle 1 through Day 1 of Cycle 2 [Table 2 and Section  8.1.2] ). For study analysis and 
reporting purposes , only values derived from the central laboratories will be utilized. The 
Investigator  must evaluate all results outside the reference range and determine the clinical 
significance (clinically significant or not clinically significant) . 
• Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell (WBC) 
count, neutrophils ( ANC ), lymphocytes (absolute), monocytes (absolute), eosinophils 
(absolute), basophil s (absolute), granulocyte s (absolute), mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, and platelet count. 
• Blood c hemistry: glucose, blood urea nitrogen ( BUN) , albumin, t otal bilirubin , 
alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT , electrolytes (including sodium, potassium, calcium, 
magnesium, chloride, and bicarbonate), and creatinine . 
• Since the pemb rolizumab Prescribing Information ( Keytruda® US Prescribing 
Information  2017) advi ses monitoring of patients for hyperglycemia or other signs 
and symptoms  of diabetes, blood glucose will be monitored throughout the study as 
either part of the chemistry panel or as a single assessment ( see Schedule of Events 
Table 1 and  Table 2).  
• Since the pembrolizumab Prescribing Information ( Keytruda® US Prescribing 
Information  2017) advi ses monitoring of patients for changes in thyroid function at 
the start of treatment and periodically during treatment, the thyroid hormones free triiodothyronine (T3); free total thyroxine (T4), and thyroid stimulating hormone 
(TSH) will be monitored throughout the study (see Schedule of Events Table 1 and  
Table 2) . 
• Coagulation: international normalized ratio  (INR), prothrombin time  (PT), and partial 
thromboplastin time  (PTT) . 
• Urinalysis: protein, glucose, ketones, blood, specific gravity, nitrite, pH, and 
leukocytes . 
8.2.12. Pregnancy Test  
A serum or urine human chorionic gonadotropin test to determine whether a female subject is 
pregnant should be collected for all WOCBP . A woman is c onsidered of childbearing potential, 
i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless permanently sterile. 
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 71 of 112  06 November 2017  cause. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and 
bilateral oophorectomy. The pregnancy test will be done by the local laboratory within 7 days 
before Day 1 (first dose of study medication). Pregnancy tests will be performed approximately every month at the beginning of each treatment cycle (Cycles 2 and beyond) during the study. 
8.2.13. Contraception  
Highly effective methods of contraception for participating WOCBP should be used during the 
study treatment and up to 4 months  following the last dose of any study medication, and include 
the following:  
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)  
• Progestogen- only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
(oral, injectable, implantable)  
• Intrauterine device  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner  
Participating men can be fertile or vasectomized. Fertile men are advised to use effective 
methods of contraception during the study and until 3 months after administration of the last 
dose of any study medication. 
8.2.14. Immunogenicity  
A blood sample will be col lected from all subjects who receive PEGPH20 and analyzed to 
determine if PEGPH20 is eliciting a humoral immune response. Initial anti -drug antibodies 
(ADA)  testing will be done using a multi- tiered approach per the G uidance, and 
immunocompetition will be performed to confirm an initial positive response in the screening 
assay. Any s amples confirmed as positive in the ADA assay will then be assayed for neutralizing 
antibodies.  
Refer to the Prescribing information of pembrolizumab for information related to 
immunogenicity of pembrolizumab ( Keytruda® US Prescribing Information 2017) .
 
8.2.15. Imaging/Radiologic Evaluation  
CT/MRI  with contrast evaluations will be performed for all subjects in accordance with each 
site’s Standard of Care Lung or  Gastric Adenocarcinoma CT /MRI  imaging protocol s (include 
chest, abdomen, pelvis contrast -enhanced CT /MRI ). CT/MRI  scans  of other areas of known or 
newly suspected disease  must also be obtained. In the event that the subject is intolerant to any 
contr ast agents needed for imaging, local/institutional guidelines should be f ollowed for imaging 
evaluation.  
All scans will be evaluated locally for disease assessment using RECIST v1.1 and irRC , and sent 
to the CIV for storage and possible analysis at the end of the study.  
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 72 of 112  06 November 2017  For study eligibility, the Investigator must determine the presence of 1 or more tumors based on 
CT/MRI  scans performed within 28 days of Day 1. For subject eligibility in the Dose Escalation  
portion subjects need only have evaluable disease (evaluable dis ease may include measurable 
lesions, although not required, but also may include such lesions as bone metastasis or pleural effusions that can’t be measured but can be evaluated). For subject eligibility in the D ose 
Expansion portion measurable disease mus t be determined using RECIST v1.1 
(Eisenhauer  2009; Appendix C ). 
During the study, CT /MRI  scans for objective tumor assessment ( based on RECIST v1.1 and 
irRC) will be performed at the end of Cycle 2, at  the end of Cycle 4, and at the end of every 
fourth treatment cycle thereafter (i.e., Week 3 of Cycles 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and beyond). CT /MRI  
scans should be performed after the last dose in each cycle to allow time for reading of the scans 
by the  Investigator prior to start  of subsequent cycles. For subjects who are withdrawn from the 
study due to clinical disease progression, a CT /MRI  scan should be requested as soon as 
possible. At the End of Treatment Visit, a CT /MRI  scan is only required if radi ographic disease 
progression was not documented in the previous CT /MRI  scan.  
Note: For disease assessment, if a CT/MRI scan is taken at screening then the same modality of scanning must be used for the subject throughout the course of the study.  
A CT/MRI b rain scan must  also be performed at Screening (within 28 days prior to first dose of 
study drugs), to assess potential CNS disease and/or metastases.  
For the duration of the study (i .e., post -baseline), CT/MRI of the brain will be performed if 
clinically indicated, and within a target of 1 week after a subject achi eves a complete response 
(CR). For NSCLC subjects with a history of treated brain metastases, brain scans will be performed at tumor assessment time points.
 
Additional optional imaging using PET/C T and DCE -MRI will be performed at selected sites 
only to assess treatment effects of pembrolizumab based on tumor blood flow and metabolic activity. Details about the conduct of these assessments are provided in a separate manual.  
8.2.16. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Plasma samples  will be collected  to assess the potential effects of pembrolizumab on the PK of 
PEGPH20 (as specified in Table 3) . Additionally, s erum samples will be collected  to potentially 
assess the PK of pembrolizumab  as an exploratory endpoint . Post -dose PK time points should be 
relative to the stop time of the P EGPH20 infusion. If samples are collected from a central line, 
the line should be flushed with saline prior to collecting the PK samples. Samples should not be 
collected from the same line used to administer PEGPH20. Actual sampling times must be 
recorded.  Initial testing will be done during the study; however, samples will be stored for 
possible re -analysis if deemed necessary and for potential future testing of  other biomarkers that 
may be found to be relevant . 
If a subject discontinues PEGPH20 therapy, P EGPH20 PK samples will not be collected from 
that subject. However, if that subject continues on pembrolizumab therapy at the discretion of the Investigator, pembrolizumab PK samples must be collected.  
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 73 of 112  06 November 2017  8.2.17. Biomarker Assessments   
This study will collect samples  for biomarker assessments in all subjects (where not prohibited 
by local regulations). Sample types collected include tumor samples and plasma samples. Any 
sample or derivatives (such as deoxyribonucleic acid [ DNA] , ribonucleic acid [ RNA] , and 
protein) ma y be stored for up to 15 years after study completion to assist in any research related 
to PEGPH20 or cancer, and for potential diagnostic development.  
In addition, biomarkers identified in other clinical studies may also be assessed in the biomarker 
sampl es collected from subjects enrolled in this study. The decision to perform other biomarker 
assessments may be based on the clinical outcome of this study and/or the signals observed in other clinical studies or other information available at that time.   
Refer to the Laboratory Manual for detailed instructions on the processing, storage, and shipping of samples.  
8.2.17.1.1. Tumor Biopsies  
Tumor tissue needs to meet specific tissue sample requirements as follows (see Laboratory 
Manual):  
• A tumor tissue in FFPE  block or 5- 10 unstained, consecutive core biopsy slides from 
1 tumor tissue block are preferred but not mandatory for subjects eligible for the Dose Escalation  portion. 
• A tumor tissue in FFPE block or 10- 15 unstained, consecutive tumor tissue  slides 
from 1 tumor tissue block are mandatory for subjects eligible for the D ose E xpansion 
portion, that meet specific tissue sample requirements (see Laboratory Manual). 
Archived resection specimens from the primary tumor without radiologic evi dence of 
metastasis at the time of resection are not suitable to establish histological 
confirmation and require new tumor tissue of a metastatic site.  
• Fine needle aspiration and/or brushing biopsy are not acceptable.  
The pathology report as well as any m olecular pathology reports (e.g., for ALK or EGFR 
mutational status in NSCLC and HER2 status in gastric cancer) must be provided. Specific sampling and processing instructions will be outlined in a separate laboratory manual. The tumor 
biopsy, whether a bl ock or unstained slides, must be sent to the appropriate laboratory as soon as 
possible after it is obtained; however, it should not be sent prior to the subject signing the ICF (or 
prescreening ICF if used  in Dose Expansion) . Tumor biopsy samples will be utilized for analysis 
of HA, PD- L1 expression levels (retrospectively) , and other exploratory biomarkers.  
An optional post -dose biopsy will be collected at the end of Cycle 1 for all subjects who provide 
separate informed consent. The sample will be analyzed for tumor HA , PD-L1 expression, and 
other exploratory biomarkers in comparison with the pre -dose sample to evaluate PEGPH20 
and/or  pembrolizumab effects.  
8.2.17.1.2. Plasma Hyaluronan and Exploratory Biomarkers  
Plasma HA is an indicator of PEGPH20 pharmacological activity. Baseline and post -dose HA 
levels in plasma samples will be analyzed to evaluate the PEGPH20 treatment effect , and assess 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 74 of 112  06 November 2017  drug exposure . In addition, plasma samples may be analyzed for explora tory biomarkers of 
PEGPH20 and/or pembrolizumab a ctivity.  
8.2.17.1.3. Tumor -Associated Hyaluronan  and Tissue -Based Biomarkers  
Tumor tissu e available at Screening and  collected optionally  during the study will be sent to a 
central laboratory and tested for HA levels using a  co-developed investigational diagnostic a ssay 
(VENTANA RxDx) . This assay uses an affinity -histochemistry -based staining method to 
evaluate HA levels in tumor biopsies.  
Expression of exploratory biomarkers will also be assessed.  
For screening purposes, the result for e ach subject screened (i.e., eligible/ineligible based on HA 
level) will be sent to the sites to determine eligibility of subjects to enter the study. 
8.2.17.1.4. Tumor -Associated PD -L1 Expression in Gastric Adenocarcinoma  
Tumor tissue  available from gastric adenocarci noma subjects at screening and  collected 
optionally during the study will be tested for PD -L1 expression levels  retrospectively . 
8.2.17.1.5. Tumor -Associated PD -L1 expression  in NSCLC 
Tumor tissue available from NSCLC subjects at screening and  collected  optionally during the 
study will be tested retrospectively for PD -L1 expression levels.  
8.3. Study Drug  Administration  
Each treatment cycle is 21 days ( 3 weeks ). 
In Dose Escalation, PEGPH20 will be administered on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of each 21- day 
cycle (i.e. 3 doses/cycle) and pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg every 21 days) on Day 1 of each cycle 
(i.e. 1 dose/cycle), 4- 6 hours after the  completion of  PEGPH20 administration.  
 
In Dose Expansion, PEGPH20 will be administered on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of each 21- day 
cycle (i.e. 3 doses/cycle) and pembrolizumab (200  mg every 21 days) on Day 1 of each cycle 
(i.e. 1 dose/cycle), 4- 6 hours after the  completion of PEGPH20 administration.  
Treatment in both portions of the study will continue until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent from the study. 
If a dose of PEGPH20 i s missed on Day 1 of  cycle  2 or beyond, the cycle will continue as 
scheduled. If it is known that pembrolizumab will be missed or held on Day 1, PEGPH20 shoul d 
also be held and the cycle will not start until the first dose of pembrolizumab is administered. 
This will require planning such that the dose of PEGPH20 can be given before the pembrolizumab dose is set to resume.

8.3.1.1. PEGPH20 Administration  
The PEGP H20 dose will be individually calculated for all dosing visits according to the subject’s 
screening weight. In calculating the dose, there will be no downward adjustment to “ideal” body 
weight. Doses should be re -adjusted if the subject’s weight changes by >10%. If the subject’s 
weight changes by ≤10%, no adjustment is necessary unless the site has a standard procedure to 
adjust doses based upon current weight. The dispensing pharmacist will verify the dose accuracy 
with a qualified study staff member. The appropriate dose will be diluted as per the instructions provided in a separate pharmacy manual.  
After completion of pre -dose activities, PEGPH20 will be administered as an IV infusion over 
10 minutes, approximately 1 mL/minute (a window of +2 minutes is allowed, i.e., infusion can be 10 to 12 minutes), under observation by qualified clinic staff. The volume and/or duration of 
PEGPH20 administration may change at the discretion of the Sponsor, based upon safety 
information. The study nurse or alternate designee by the Investigator  will record the time the 
infusion was started and stopped. A saline flush should follow IV delivery of the complete 
PEGPH20 dose as per standard of car e for flushing IV lines. Only a peripheral line should be 
used for the administration of PEGPH20 (heparin flushes should not be used on the same line as 
PEGPH20), but heparin flushes may be used for central lines as per standard of care. In the event 
that peripheral venous access cannot be obtained, the central line may be used. If this happens, 
ensure the line is flushed with saline (minimum of 10 mL) prior to administering PEGPH20 and after administering PEGPH20. Ensure the PEGPH20 administration is not done immediately 
before or after the central line has been flushed with a heparin flush (i.e., ensure the line is flushed with a heparin flush no earlier than 1 hour before or after the PEGPH20 administration).  
8.3.1.2. Hypersensitivity to PEGPH20  
In the event of a  hypersensitivity reaction, the PEGPH20 infusion should be stopped and the 
symptoms should be treated as necessary. Halozyme should be contacted immediately (see study 
manual for contact information) . 
At the Investigator ’s discretion and after discussion w ith the Sponsor, a re -challenge for the next 
visit may be done if the reaction is not considered anaphylaxis and is ≤  Grade 2. Any subject 
with anaphylaxis or a ≥Grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction/infusion reaction should be discontinued from the study. In the event of a ≤Grade 2 hypersensitivity/infusion reaction, the 
Sponsor and Investigator  will agree on how subsequent injections will be administered. In 
general, a re -challenge should be done after pre -medication with a combination of IV 
diphenhydramine, IV H2 blockers (such as famotidine), and IV dexamethasone. If the 
hypersensitivity reactions are experienced at the re- challenge, the subject should be discontinued 
from the study. 
8.3.1.3. PEGPH20 Dose Modification Guidelines  
PEGPH20  dose adjustment s are allowed b ased on toxicities that are deemed related, possibly 
related , or probably related to PEGPH20 . See Table 6 for guidelines.

Refer to the current Keytruda® US Prescribing Information for the identified risks associated 
with pembrolizumab treatment.  
8.3.2.3. Pembrolizumab Dose Ad justment and Toxicity Management  
Dose adjustments (reduction, interruption, and discontinuation)  and toxicity management  should 
be undertaken per the  current  Keytruda® US P rescribing I nformation.  
8.4. Excluded  Concomitant Medications and Study Restrictions  
Concurrent chronic use of IV heparin is prohibited; h owever, for acute TEs , IV heparin may be 
used. PEGPH20 administration must be stopped during this period. Use  of megestrol acetate is 
prohibited. 
Any other anti -cancer agents  or investigational agents  are prohibited while  the subject is on 
study. After treatment is discontinued  and a subject enters long- term follow -up, the subject  will 
not have any restrictions (i.e., when being followed every 12 weeks to collect survival and anti -
cancer therapy data).  
The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting pembrolizumab 
should be avoided because of their potentia l interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and 
efficacy of pembrolizumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after starting pembrolizumab to treat immune -related adverse reactions (see 
Section  8.3.2.2).  
8.5. Treatment Compliance  
Trained medical personnel are to administer the IV study treatments . Treatment compliance will 
be monitored by the review of drug accountability records and study treatment administration data, which will be recorded in the subject ’s medical record and eCRFs . 
8.6. Randomization and Blinding  
This is an open- label, non- randomized study.  
A subject will be registered in the centralized IWRS and will be assigned a unique subject 
identification number. The subject’s identification number will be used on all of that subject’s eCRFs and SAE forms (if applicable). Any subject identification number s that are assigned will 
not be reused even if the subject does not receive treatment.

9.1. Study Drug  Description  
9.1.1. PEGPH20  
The investigational material in PEGPH20 is a PEGylated, neutral- pH-active human 
hyaluronidase PH20 produced by r ecombinant DNA technology. rHuPH20 degrades HA under 
physiologic conditions and acts as a spreading factor in vivo. 
PEGPH20 is a multi- site PEGylated enzyme generated by conjugating N -hydroxysuccinimidyl 
ester of methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) -butanoic acid (MSBA30K or PEG) and PH20. 
Chemical Name  
PEGPH20 (PEGylated recombinant human hyaluronidase: 36- 482-hyaluronoglucosaminidase 
PH20 [human])  
Structural Formula  
The structure of PEGPH20 is represente d in Figure  2. 
Figure 2:  Structure of PEGPH20  
 
The empirical formula for P is rHuPH20: C 2327H3565N589O667S20 and PEG: C 1371H2737NO 686. 
PEGPH20 is a multi- site PEGylated enzyme. Its measured molecular weight is generally 
between 100,000 and 270,000 Da.  
9.1.2. Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab is a human programmed death receptor -1-blocking antibody indicated for the 
treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melano ma; patients with metastatic NSCLC 
whose tumors express PD -L1 as determined by an FDA -approved test and who have disease 
progression on or after platinum -based  chemotherapy (patients with EGFR or ALK genomic 
tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA -approved therapy for these 
aberrations prior to receiving pembrolizumab); and patients with recurrent or metastatic head and 
neck squamous cell carcinomas with disease progression on or after platinum -based 
chemotherapy.  
Pembrolizumab will be considered investigational for the purpose of this study since the combination of pembrolizumab with PEGPH20 has not been indicated as yet for the treatment of  
the populations studied in this trial.

9.4.1. PEGPH20  
Instructions for preparing PEGPH20 can be found in the pharmacy manual.  
9.4.2. Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab will be prepared and administered according to local site standard of care and 
the appropriate package insert.  
9.5. Study Drug Accountability  
The Investigator , pharmacist , or qualified designee is responsible for  making an inventory of 
study drug(s)  upon their receipt . All used and unused study drug supplies  should be retained until 
final reconciliation  or as indicated by Halozyme , or as per Institution policy. The study drug is to 
be administered/prescribed by the P rincipal Investigator  (PI) or appropriately qualified site 
personnel named on the delegation of authority  log. Under no circumstances will the I nvestigator  
allow the study drug to be used other than as directed by this protocol . Although appropriate 
personnel may be designated to administer/dispense drug and maintain dr ug accountability 
records, the PI is  ultimately responsible for all drug accountability.  
The Investigator  or designee must maintain accurate records of the receipt  and disposition of 
study drug supplies . Documentation of drug disposition should identify the subject receiving the 
drug, the amount and date of the dose, and any unused drug. This documentation is required in 
addition to drug accountability information recorded on e CRFs . A copy of the reconciled drug 
inventory record will be provided to Halozyme or its designee, and the study si te will retain the 
original  record . 
After study drug is reconciled by the study monitor, drug may be destroyed as per Institutional Policy, or returned to the country specific drug depot as per country regulations . If u sed study 
medications cannot be store d until drug accountability has been performed as per clinic/institution 
policy, the S ponsor should be notified in advance, and reconciliation procedures will be agreed 
upon. 
10. SAFETY ASSESSMENT S 
Safety parameters monitored and recorded during this study inc lude AEs ; medical history ; 
concomitant medications ; immunogenicity, hematology, blood chemistr y (including glucose) , 
thyroid hormone levels, coagulation, and urinalysis results ; physical examination findings ; vital 
signs ; ECG  results ; pregnancy test results ; and ECOG P erformance S tatus.  
10.1. Management of Thromboembolic Events  
TE events have been identified in the pancreatic cancer clinical studies with PEGPH20. While 
pancreatic cancer is considered to be one of the most thrombogenic malignancies, it is necessary 
to manage any potential risks in subjects  with NSCLC  and gastric adenocarcinoma. All NSCLC 
subjects will be given enteric- coated 81 mg of aspirin/day and all gastric adenocarcinoma 
subjects will be given enoxaparin 40 mg /day in this study, for prophylaxis of TE event s, given 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 82 of 112  06 November 2017  the high incidence seen in these tumor types . PEGPH20  will be discontinued for s ubjects who 
experience any TE requiring full -dose anticoagulation while on study. Treatment with 
pembrolizumab, however , may continue as deemed appropriate by the Investigator. If in gastric 
adenocarcinoma subjects, enoxaparin is discontinued for any reason, PEGPH20 will be 
discontinued. Treatment with pembrolizumab, however, may continue as deemed appropriate by 
the Invest igator. Subjects who discontinue PEGPH20 and pembrolizumab treatment will have an 
End of Treatment Visit and enter lo ng-term follow -up for survival. 
Any anticoagulation therapy received by the subjects must be documented in the applicable eCRF pages.  
10.2. Adver se Event Definitions 
An AE is any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a pharmaceutical product (i.e., study drug), whether or not considered related to the 
pharmaceutical product . 
The recording of AEs (except for procedure- associated SAEs) will begin at the start of the 
administration of the first dose of a study drug and continue until 30 days after the  last dose of 
study drug. P rocedure -associated SAEs, will be recorded starting after the subject signs  the 
informed consent for the study. AEs should include  the development or increased severity of an 
undesirable medical condition or the worsening of a pre -existing medical condition during or 
following exposure to study drug, regardless of relationship to study drug. Only the highest severity will be recorded for a single AE in the eCRF. 
An SAE is any AE that:  
• Results in death . 
• Is life -threatening.  
A life -threatening SAE is any AE  that places the subject at immediate risk of death 
from the reaction as i t occurred, as assessed by the Investigator . This definition does 
not include a reaction that might have caused death if it occurred in a more severe 
form.  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization.  
• For the purposes of this pr otocol, any hospital admission will be considered inpatient 
hospitalization, regardless of duration. An emergency room visit without hospital admission will not be recorded as a SAE under this criterion, nor will cases of 
elective hospitalization for admin istration of chemotherapy, hospitalization for social 
admissions, or hospitalization for a procedure scheduled before study enrollment . 
However, unexpected complications that occur during elective surgery should be recorded as AEs and assessed for seriousn ess. 
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions . 
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
• Is any other important medical event , 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 83 of 112  06 November 2017  Other medical events may be considered SAEs when, based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes in the SAE definition. Examples include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization of the 
subject, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
10.3. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Report a ll SAEs to the designated safety contact IMMEDIATELY AND NO LATER THAN 
24 HOURS OF AWARENESS , i.e., knowledge, discovery or notification of the SAE . Enter the 
study- specific SAE/ AE of special interest information into the ED C and send any other available 
pertinent information (e.g., hospital records, laboratory results, etc.) to the designated safety contact (contact information is provided in the study reference binder).  
If additional follow -up information is required or becomes available for a previously reported 
SAE/ AE of special interest, entry of the new  information into the EDC shoul d be completed and 
submitted IMMEDIATELY AND NO LATER THAN 24 HOURS OF AWARENESS . For 
hospitalizations, all attempts to obtain the hospital record should be documented in t he study file. 
10.4. Reporting Adverse Events of Special Interest  
10.4.1. Thromboembolic Events  
TE events are considered AEs of special interest in the current trial.  All TE events, regardless of 
type of event, severity, or seriousness , must  be reported  to the Sponsor IMMEDIATELY AND 
NO LATER THAN 24 HOURS OF AWARENESS . Details regarding timelines for the 
reporting of such events are available on the  AE of Special I nterest  form (guidance regarding 
completion of associated eCRF pages  will be provided to t he study sites ). Complete the study-
specific AE of Special Interest form and send to the designated safety contact (contact 
information is provided in the study reference binder).  
The current version of the  NCI CTCAE  (i.e. Version 4.03 [14 June 2010]) should be utilized 
when grading TE e vents. Table 7 denotes the most commonly reported TE events and the 
associated grading scale per CTCAE Version 4.03 (14  June 2010). If the CTCAE is updated 
during the study, the current  version of the CTCAE  (i.e. Version 4.03 [14 June 2010])  should be 
used.

10.4.2. Disease -Related Events That Are Endpoints  
For the purposes of this study in subjects with NSCLC  and gastric adenocarcinoma, progression 
of the subject’s underlying disease (“disease progression”) is an efficacy assessment and should 
generally not be reported as an AE or SAE . However, if the Investigator  determines that there is 
evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the event and the study medication, immediately report the event to the safety contact and record as an AE or SAE.  
Death resulting from disease progress ion is a  study endpoint, and generally should not be 
reported a s a SAE . This event  must be recorded in the eCRF and will be reviewed by the 
Sponsor periodically for increased frequency in the treatment group. However, if the Investigator  
determines that th ere is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the event and the 
study medication, immediately report the event as an SAE. 
10.5. Adverse Events  
Events that occur before the first administration of study drug are not considered AEs, by 
definition ( Secti on 10.2); record these events on the Medical History e CRF.  However, as noted 
in Section 10.2, any study procedure -associated events occurring after the subject’s signing of 
the informed consent for the study (including prior to the administration of study drug) should be 
recorded if the event is considered serious.  
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 86 of 112  06 November 2017  The Investigator  or a qualified designee will question and examine subjects for evidence of AEs . 
Subjects should not be asked about specific AEs . Instead, they should be asked general questions 
(e.g., “How have you been fee ling since your last visit?”) . Record all AEs in the eCRF .  
For an event to be recorded as an AE, the onset must occur during or after the subject’s first 
exposure to study drug (except for study procedure -associated SAEs) , and no later than 30 days 
after the last study drug dose . However, there is no limit on reporting SAEs considered 
reasonably related to study drugs  (i.e., assessed as “Yes, Related,” “Probably Related,” or 
“Possibly Related,” Section 10.5.2); these should be submitted as SAEs per Section  10.3, even if 
they are first identified during the long- term follow -up period. The Investigator  should follow all 
AEs that are considered reasonably related to study drug until resolution or stabi lization . All 
other AEs should be followed until resolution or stabilization or until the End of Treatment V isit, 
whichever occurs first.  
Wherever possible, record syndromes rather than individual signs or symptoms to avoid duplication and to facilitate me aningful interpretation of data . For example, a subject presenting 
with rhinitis, fever, and headache should be reported as having “flu- like symptoms,” without 
independently recording each accompanying sign. When no clearly recognizable clinical syndrome c an be described, record individual clinical signs and symptoms. In addition, “disease 
progression” or “death” should not be reported as an AE or SAE term; instead the underlying 
cause of the disease progressi on or death should be reported.  
All AEs that occ ur during the study should be treated appropriately to protect and ensure the 
subject’s well -being. If such treatment constitutes a deviation from this protocol, Hal ozyme must 
be notified and the Investigator  should comply with applicable  IRB/EC reporting requirements.  
The Investigator  is responsible for determining whether or not an AE is severe enough to require 
the subject’s removal from treatment. A subject may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment because of an AE . If either occurs, the s ubject must receive app ropriate medical care, and the 
Investigator  must strongly encourage the subject to return to the study site for the final protocol -
specified visit and assessments, and to continue returning to the study site for follow -up 
evaluations  until the AE resolves or stabilizes . All AEs, serious or not, that result in permanent 
withdrawal from study treatment should be immediately reported to Halozyme ( Section 10.3).  
Halozyme will conduct reviews of all available AEs to determine dose escalation steps, to determine the optimal pembrolizumab schedule at the end of Dose Escalation , and at a minimum 
of once every 3 months during Dose Expansi on. 
10.5.1. Classification of Adverse Events by Severity  
The Investigator  must categorize the severity of each AE usin g the NCI CTCAE  v4.03 ( Table 6) . 
It is important to distinguish between AE seriousness and severity; these terms are not 
interchangeable . Severity is a measure of intensity , whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria 
in Section 10.2. 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 87 of 112  06 November 2017  10.5.2. Classification of Adverse Events by Relationship to Study Drug  
For each AE, the Investigator  must document whether there is a reasonable possibility that the 
event was caused by administration of PEGPH20  or pembrolizumab. The Investigator  should 
make this decision after careful consideration of the following questions:  
• Does the AE follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study 
drug?  
• Can the AE be reasonably explained by the know n characteristics of the subject’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other therapy?  
• Do the AE symptoms disappear or decrease on cessation of study drug or reduction in 
study drug dose? (There are exceptions when an AE does not disappear on 
discontinuation of the drug, yet drug relatedness clearly exists [e.g., bone marrow depression, fixed drug eruptions, tardive dyskinesia, etc.])  
• Does the AE reappear or worsen when the study drug is re -administered?  
• Does the AE follow an expected response  pattern based on the established 
pharmacologic and toxicologic effects of the study drug?  
• Does the AE follow an expected response pattern based on the known effects of other products in the same class? 
For this assessment, the Investigator  will classify e ach AE as one of the following:  
• Yes, Related:  The AE is definitely related to study drug administration.  
• Probably Related:  There is a high degree of certainty that the AE is related to study 
drug administration. 
• Possibly Related:  The AE could be related either to study drug administration or to 
concurrent disease/medication.  
• Unlikely Related:  There is a high degree of certain ty that the AE is NOT related to 
study drug administration. 
• Not Related:  The AE is clearly due to other causes (e.g. concurrent medication, 
underlying disease, etc.).  
For the purposes of expedited reporting to regulatory authorities, AEs assessed as “Yes, 
Related,” “Probably Related,” or “Possibly Related” will be considered suspected adverse 
reactions.  
10.6. Abnormal Laboratory Results  
Abnormal laboratory results may occur in the context of an AE that is a clinical syndrome (e.g., 
elevated BUN and creatinine in  the setting of an AE of renal failure, or elevated AST/ALT in the 
setting of an AE of hepatitis) . In these cases, do not record the abnormality itself as an AE.  
However, in the absence of an AE that encompasses an observed abnormal laboratory result, report the abnormality as an AE if the Investigator  judges it to be clinically significant for the 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 88 of 112  06 November 2017  subject.  Changes in trial dosing or study discontinuation resulting from an abnormal laboratory 
value not associated with an AE should also be captured as an AE . 
If test results lead to a change in trial dosing or discontinuation from the trial, significant  
additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy, and/or requires medical/surgical 
intervention and/or is considered to be an AE by the Investigator or S ponsor as an abnormal 
objective test finding, it should be reported as an AE. 
10.7. Pregnancy  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that the study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness of the contraceptive medication . Ref er to the pembrolizumab 
Prescribing Information for the s ummary  of risks  in this specific population. Based on its 
mechanism of action, pembrolizumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should therefore  use highly effective contraception 
during treatment with pembrolizumab and refrain from breast feed ing for 4 months after the last 
dose of pembrolizumab. Pregnancy  within 120 days of study drug discontinuation in a subject 
must be reported to the designated safety contact (contact information is provided in the study 
reference binder) IMMEDIATELY AND NO  LATER THAN 24 HOURS OF 
AWARENESS . Complete the study- specific Pregnancy Report Form with all available 
information and submit the form with pregnancy test results and any other pertinent information. Also, within 24 hours, complete the eCRF with all avail able AE, demographic, medical history, 
concomitant medication, and study drug administration information. As additional information 
on a previously reported pregnancy becomes available, a follow -up Pregnancy Report Form 
should be prepared with the new information and submitted to the safety contact. 
Subjects who become pregnant during the study will not receive any additional study drug and 
will be withdrawn from the study. The Investigator  must strongly encourage these subjects to 
return to the study site for the final protocol -specified visit and assessments . In addition, the 
Investigator  will monitor the pregnancies of subjects exposed to study drug or the partner of a 
male subject who may become pregnant while that subject is on study until final resolution 
(delivery, miscarriage, or early termination) . Follow -up should occur monthly and should be 
documented in the study file . A follow -up Pregnancy Report Form must be completed for each 
follow -up contact with the subject or the partner of a male subject who became pregnant while 
that subject is on study and submitted to the S ponsor’s designated safety contact . Report a 
spontaneous miscarriage, therapeutic abortion, stillbirth, or congenital anomaly as a n SAE 
(Section 10.3).  
10.8. Overdose  
PEGPH20 and pembrolizumab will be administered by IV infusion at a qualified and experienced clinical study site. The potential for drug overdose is therefore minimal. However, should an overdose occur, the infusion should be stopped immediately. A blood PK plasma 
sample should be taken as soon as possible, with a notation of the time of sampling relative to the time of cessation of the infusion. The Investigator  should also monitor the subject with 
appropriate blood counts and blood chemistry tests, and should also provide supportive therapy, as necessary. Contact the Halozyme Medical Monitor, or designee, WITHIN 24 HOURS.  
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 89 of 112  06 November 2017  There are no data regarding PEGPH20 overdose in humans . However, the likelihood of 
significant MSEs  (such as pain, spasms, and weakness ) increases with increasing PEGPH20 
dose. An overdose  and AEs  should be treated as per standard medical practice. There is no 
known antidote for PEGPH20. 
Overdose of pembrolizumab should be managed per the  Prescribing Information. 
Dosing details should be captured in the eCRF . If the subject receives a dose of a study drug that 
exceeds protocol specifications and the subject is symptomatic, then the symptom(s) should be 
documented as AEs in the eCRF and, if serious, submitted to the S ponsor’s designated safety 
contact on an SAE Report Form . Do not record the overdose as an AE if the subject is not 
symptomatic.  
10.9. Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent DMC will review all available safety data from the first 3 NSCLC subjects and 
first 3 gastric adenocarcinoma subjects who have completed Cycle 1  in Dose Expansion to 
determine if the safety and tolerability profile of the PEGPEM combination is acceptable  (refer 
to the DMC charter for additional details) . The DMC will also continue to periodically review 
safety data to protect subject welfare and identify potential safety signals . 
10.10.  Unblinding  
No part of the  study is blinded. 
10.11.  Reporting Safety Information to the Regulatory Authorities and to 
the Institutional Review Board  
The Sponsor will determine if SAEs are suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs), and if so will expedite reporting to Regulatory Authorities according to applicable Clinical Trials Regulations.  
The Sponsor and/or a designated agent may provide written safety reports or other safety- related 
communications to the Investigator . The Investigator  will ensure that these reports are reviewed 
and processed in accordance with regulatory and IRB/EC requirements and archived in the site’s study file . 
At the completion or early  termination of the study, the Investigator  will submit a fina l report to 
the IRB/EC within the applicable time frame.  
10.12.  Concomitant Medications  
Any medication received during the study, other than a designated study drug (PEGPH20 or pembrolizumab), is regarded as concomitant medication. Record concomitant medications taken 
after the subject signs the ICF during the S creening period (≤28 days prior to Study Day 1) 
through 30 days after the End of Treatment Visit on the Concomitant Medications eCRF. 
Update information on concomitant medications, including medication used to treat an AE, at 
each visit according to the study schedule of events. At each visit, ask subjects if there have been 
any changes in their prescription or non- prescription medications since their last visit.  
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 90 of 112  06 November 2017  Subjects may receive medications during the s tudy including, but not limited to, antibiotics, 
analgesics, antipyretics, etc., when clinically indicated. Prohibited medications are identified in 
Section  8.4. 
Piroxicam and toradol  used to decrease the severity of musculoskeletal symptoms should be 
docum ented and recorded in the eCRF . Prescribed medication such as narcotics, muscle 
relaxants and other analgesics (with the exceptions of steroids), OTC drugs and physical therapy can also be used at the Investigator’s discretion and should be documented and recorded in the 
eCRF. Dexamethasone may be used at the Investigator ’s discretion and following a discussion 
with the S ponsor , and shoul d be documented and recorded in the eCRF . For additional details, 
refer to Table 6.  
Enoxaparin and any other anticoagulants should also be documented and recorded in the eCRF.  
10.12.1. Piroxicam and Toradol  
Refer to the current piroxicam and toradol Prescribing Information for prescribing information and toxicity profile.  
Piroxicam and toradol have been investigated in an animal model of MS events and may be helpful in decreasing the severity of MSEs in subjects. Piroxicam (20 mg) will  be administered at 
least 1- 2 hours prior to PEGPH20 administration on the day of dosing ( timing will be at the 
Investigator’s discretion based on the piroxicam manufacturer’s Prescribing Information and subject’s convenience)  to minimize the severity of MSEs. T he prophylactic use of a proton pump 
inhibitor  is mandated for all subjects  while re ceiving the  study drug (e.g. 20 mg omeprazole 
daily or OTC  equivalent). 
Toradol should not be administered concurrently with piroxicam as it is contraindicated in the 
Toradol Prescribing Information to administer toradol simultaneously with other NSAIDs 
because of the cumulative risk of inducing serious NSAID -related side effects . If piroxicam is 
used chronically, consideration should be given to begin a n H2 blocker to decrease the risk of 
gastric irritation.  
If side effects are observed following administration of NSAIDs, the dosing of piroxicam may be 
adjusted at the Investigator’s discretion upon discussion with the Sponsor.  
10.12.2. Enoxaparin  
Refer to the current enoxaparin Prescribing Information for prescribing information and toxicity profile.  
All gastric adenocarcinoma subjects with or without a history of DVT will be given enoxaparin 
40 mg /day (pre-filled syringes of enoxaparin are allowed), for prophylaxis of TE events, given 
the high incidence seen in this tumor type . PEGPH20 will be d iscontinued for subjects who 
experience any TE requiring full -dose anticoagulation while on study. Treatment with 
pembrolizumab, however , may continue as deemed appropriate by the Investigator.  
If in gastric adenocarcinoma subjects, enoxaparin is discontinued for any reason, PEGPH20 will also be discontinued. Treatment with pembrolizumab, however, may continue as deemed appropriate by the Investigator. 
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 91 of 112  06 November 2017  10.12.3. Aspirin  
All NSCLC subjects will be given enteric- coated 81 mg of aspirin/day for prophylaxis of T E 
events, given the high inc idence seen in this tumor type. 
10.12.4. Dexamethasone  
As this study uses  an immunotherapeutic agent and dexamethasone may suppress an immune 
response, it should only be used when prescribed by the Investigator  and following a discussion 
with the Sponsor . Dexamethasone may be used to attenuate musculoskeletal symptoms that may 
occur in subjects treated with PEGPH20 and/or pembrolizumab if prescribed by the Investigator  
(and following a discussion with the Sponsor). In this situation dexam ethasone may be given 
orally, int ramuscularly, or intravenously.  
Refer to a current dexamethasone Prescribing Information for prescribing information and 
toxicity profile.  
11. STATISTICS  
11.1. Statistical Methods  
In general, continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (N, mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) . Categorical variables will be presented 
using frequencies and percentages. Dose escalation data summaries will be presented by 
PEGPH20 dose level. All statistical analyses and data listings will be performed using SAS version 9.3 or higher  (Cary, NC).  
11.1.1. Randomization and Blinding  
This is a multicenter, op en-label, non- randomized study. 
11.1.2. Sample Size 
In the dose escalating portion, there may be up to 5 dose level s for a total  of approximately 
30 subjects.  
In the Dose Expansion portion, approximately 51 subjects with HA- high tumors will be enrolled 
(30 with HA- high tumors in NSCLC cohort and 21 with HA- high tumors  in the gastric 
adenocarcinoma cohort). 
KEYNOTE -001 study data presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2016 
(Hui 2016) showed that when treated with pembrolizumab alone, treatment naïve subjects who  
had evaluable PD -L1 Tumor Proportion Score [TPS] levels had an ORR of 29% and previously 
treated subjects who  had evaluable PD -L1 TPS levels had an ORR of 21%. Under the assumption 
that no more than 40% of the subjects enrolled in this study wil l be treatment naïve, ORR in the 
combined NSCLC population is expected to be approximately 24% when treated with 
pembrolizumab alone. A 20% improvement in ORR is considered clinically meaningful when PEGPH20 is added to pembrolizumab. Under these condition s, 30 NSCLC subjects would 
provide approximately 80% power at the hypothesized ORR of 44% when the null hypothesis 
H0: ORR  ≤24% is tested against H1: ORR >24% using an exact one -sided binomial test at a 10% 
significance level.  
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 92 of 112  06 November 2017  KEYNOTE -012 study data showed that the ORR in PD -L1 positive gastric cancer subjects is 
about 22% ( Muro  2016) . Since subjects will not be selected based on PD -L1 expression levels 
prospectively in this study, in order to accom modate all subjects (irrespective of PD -L1 
expression levels), a conservative ORR of 15% is assumed with pembrolizumab treatment alone 
and it is further assumed that the addition of PEGPH20 to pembrolizumab wil l lead to a 
clinically meaningful improvement of 20% in ORR to 35%.Under these assumptions, 21 subjects 
will provide approximately 80% power at the hypothesized ORR of 35% when the null hypothesis 
H0: ORR  ≤15% tested against H1:  ORR  >15% using an exact one  sided binomial test at a 10% 
significance level.  
11.1.3. Analysis Populations  
11.1.3.1. Safety Population  
All subjects who receive any study medication. The Safety Population will be used for subject 
disposition, de mographics and safety analyses.  
11.1.3.2. DLT Evaluable Population  
All subjects who receive at least 1 of the 3 full planned doses of PEGPH20 and 1 complete dose of pembrolizumab in Cycle 1 and have been followed for the first 21 days of treatment or have 
experienced a DLT during the initial 21 days (Cycle 1) of the study. The DLT Evaluable 
Population will be used for DLT analysis.  
11.1.3.3. PK Analysis Population  
All subjects who receive any PEGPH20 and have measurable PEGPH20 concentrations in at least 1 sample collected for PK analysis. PK Analysis Population will be used for PK analysis.  
11.1.3.4. Efficacy Evaluable Population  
All HA- high subjects who receive at least 1 dose of the RP2D of PEGPH20 and at least 1 dose of 
pembrolizumab. The efficacy evaluable population will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
11.1.3.5. Tumor Res ponse Evaluable Population  
Subjects in the Efficacy Evaluable Popul ation who have at least one post -baseline tumor 
assessment. Tumor Response Evaluable Population will also be used for overall tumor response analysis.  
11.1.4. Subject Disposition  
Subject disposition data  (including analysis populations) will be summarized. 
Subject disposition will be tabulated with number of subjects enrolled, receiving study treatment, on study treatment, discontinuation from treatment, and reasons for discontinuing treatment. 
Enrollment  by center, major protocol deviati ons will also be summarized.  
Halozyme, Inc.  Protocol HALO -107-101 Amendment 4 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 93 of 112  06 November 2017  11.1.5. Analysis of Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized using safety population by dose 
level  for subjects in the Dose Escalation  portion and separately for all subjects in the Dose 
Expansion portion. The following demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized: 
age, race, height, weight, medical history, disease characteristics, and treatment history.  
11.1.6. Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy analyses will be conducted using the Efficacy Evaluable Population. ORR and DOR 
will also be analyzed using Tumor Response Evaluable population.  11.1.6.1. Analyses of the Primary ORR Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is PEGPEM treatment effect on ORR  (based on 
RECIST v1.1) . The statistical hypothesis tests for the primary endpoint are as follows:  
• NSCLC cohort: H
0: ORR ≤ 23%; H 1: ORR > 23% 
• Gastric adenocarcinoma cohort: H 0: ORR ≤ 15%; H 1: ORR > 15% 
The hypothesis tests will be conducted using the one -sided exact binomial test at the significance 
level of 0.1.  
ORR will be calculated as the number of subjects with a confirmed CR or PR divided by the 
number of subjects in the analysis  population multiplied by 100. The exa ct 80% confidence 
interval of ORR will also be constructed.  
11.1.6.2. Analyse s of Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints  
Median DOR, PFS and OS will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method.  
• DOR is defined as the time from the date on which objective response (CR or PR) is first 
determined until the first date on which radiographic disease progression is determined, 
and will only be calculated for subjects with a confirmed objective response. Subjects 
achieving a  confirmed  objective response who do not have radiographic disease 
progression will be censored at the date of the last available post -baseline evaluable 
tumor assessment. DOR will be analyz ed using Kaplan- Meier methods.  
• PFS, defined as the time from first dose date  until the first occurrence of either 
radiographic or clinical disease progression as determined by the  Investigator  or death 
from any cause before discontinuation from treatment. PFS for surviving subjects without 
disease progression will be censored at t he date of the last available post -baseline 
evaluable tumor assessment. Surviving subjects without any post -baseline disease 
assessment will be censored on Day 1.  
• OS is defined as the time from first dose date until death from any cause. OS data from 
survi ving subjects will be censor ed at time of the last contact.  
• DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR, PR, or stable disease, and 
will be analyzed  using the same method as ORR.

study medication, such as number of dos es, relative dose intensity, and dose change s. 
11.1.7.1. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
For PEGPH20 noncompartmental and compartmental PK modeling will be performed. The AUC, the C
max, and T 1/2 will be summarized from noncompartmental analysis along with 
descriptive st atistics. Other PK analyses may  be performed and population PK parameters 
including T 1/2, VD, and CL will be evaluated and repor ted if the data are sufficient.  
11.1.7.2. Plasma Hyaluronan  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize measured plasma concentrations of HA.  
11.1.7.3. Exploratory Analyses  
Descriptive summaries will be provided for all explorato ry analysis data, which include  
estimation of ORR, DOR, DCR , and PFS based on RECIST v1.1 and irRC , by P D-L1 expression 
levels, changes in tumor blood flow as measured by DCE -MRI  and changes in tumor metabolism 
as measured by PET/CT , and  changes in potential biomarkers in plasma and tumor biopsy and 
their c orrelation to study endpoints. For pembrolizumab, noncompartmental and compartmental 
PK modeling will be performed. The AUC, C max, and T 1/2 will be summarized from the 
noncompartmental analysis along with descriptive statistics.  
11.1.8. Safety  Analyses  
All safety parameters will be summarized using the Safety Population by dose level will be 
descriptive in nature . No inferential statistical tests will be c onducted for safety parameters.  
All AEs will be presented in incidence tables coded by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) Preferr ed Ter m and System Organ Class.  
Additionally, separate AE incidence tables, coded by MedDRA term, will be presented by: 
1) toxicity grade (severity) graded by the CTCAE and 2) relationship to study medication 
(PEGPH20 and pembrolizumab).  
All AEs, SAEs , AEs leadi ng to treatment discontinuation, and deaths occurring during the study 
will be summarized.  
In addition, subjects who experienced TE will be summarized by SMQ te rm and MedDRA

TUMORS (RECIST  1.1) 
Target Lesion Response Evaluation:  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR)  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters  of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum  on study thus far, nadir (this  includes the  baseline  
sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increas e of 20%, 
the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.  
Stable Disease (SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify 
for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study  
Non-Target Lesion Response Evaluation:  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker 
level. All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non -PD Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits . 
Progressive Disease (PD)  Unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  
Overall Response Evaluation:  
Target Lesion Response  Non-Target Lesion  
Response  New Lesions  Overall 
Response

1994 Revisions to Classification of Functional Capacity and Objective Assessment of Pat ients 
with Diseases of the Heart  
Functional Capacity  Objective Assessment  
Class I. Patients with cardiac disease but without 
resulting limitation of physical activity . Ordinary 
physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, 
palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.  A. No objective evidence of cardiovascular 
disease.  
Class II. Patients with cardiac disease resulting in 
slight limitation of physical activity . They are 
comfortable at rest . Ordinary physical activity 
results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspne a, or anginal 
pain.  B. Objective evidence of minimal cardiovascular 
disease.  
Class III. Patients with cardiac disease resulting in 
marked limitation of physical activity. They are 
comfortable at rest . Less than ordinary activity 
causes fatigue, palpitatio n, dyspnea, or anginal 
pain.  C. Objective evidence of moderately severe 
cardiovascular disease.  
Class IV. Patients with cardiac disease resulting in 
inability to carry on any physical activity without 
discomfort . Symptoms of heart failure or the 
anginal syndrome may be present even at rest . If 
any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is 
increased.  D. Objective evidence of severe cardiovascular 
disease.

Immune -respo nse related criteria (irRC) based on bidimensional measurements of measurable 
lesions were first introduced by Wolchok et al in 2009. This protocol will adopt a modified 
version of the criteria based on unidimensional measurements of measurable lesions, as 
described by Nishino et al  in 2013 and  2014 , as follows:  
At the baseline tumor assessment, the sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of all identified index lesions (2 per organ, up to 5 in total) will be calculated. At each subsequent tumor assessment, the SLD of the index lesions and of new measurable lesions (2 per organ, up to 5 in total) are 
added together to provide the total tumor burden = SLD
index lesions + SLD new, measurable lesions . Total 
tumor burden will be used to assess the immune related response as described in the table below.  
Immune -Response Related Criteria  
Index Lesions (Baseline 
Measurable Lesions)  Up to 2 per organ, up to 5 in total  
(see RECIST 1.1 for guidelines on measurable lesions)  
• ≥10 mm in the longest diameter for all except for lymph nodes  
• ≥15 mm in short axis for lymph nodes  
New Lesions (Measurable)  
 Up to 2 per organ, up to 5 in total  
• ≥10 mm in the longest diameter for all except for lymph nodes  
• ≥15 mm in short axis for lymph nodes  
Tumor Burden  SLD index lesions + SLD new, measurable lesions  
If a lymph node qualifies and chosen as a new measurable lesion for 
tumor burden calculations, its short axis length is included in the sum  
(SLD new, measurable lesions ) 
Immune Related Response 
Assessment  PD: ≥20% increase in tumor burden from nadir  
PR: ≥30% decrease in tumor burden from baseline  
SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD  
CR: Disappearance of all  lesions including non- index lesions and new 
non-measurable lesion s, lymph nodes must be <10 mm in short axis)  
Confirmation  Confirmation is required for CR, PR and PD by a consecutive 
observation not less than 4 weeks apart

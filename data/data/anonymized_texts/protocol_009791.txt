1.1 Study Design
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of AUY922 when administered 
intravenously on a once-weekly schedule at 70 mg/m2 in adult NSCLC patients with advanced 
disease and EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. The design will be a Simon two-stage phase 2 
study, with 10 patients enrolled to the first stage and an additional 19 patients enrolled to the second stage provided we observe at least 1 partial or complete response or stable disease lasting  3 months in the first stage. Additional safety and tolerability assessments of AUY922 will be 
evaluated as secondary objectives. Pre- and post-treatment biopsy specimens, if available, will also be analyzed to determine which exon 20 EGFR mutations may be most sensitive to Hsp90 
inhibition and explore potential mechanisms of resistance to treatment.  
1.2 Primary Objectives 
To evaluate the overall response rate to AUY922 in patients with advanced NSCLC and exon 20 insertion mutations in EGFR. 
1.3 Secondary Objectives 
xTo estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the study
population
xTo determine the safety and tolerability of AUY922
xTo explore variance in clinical outcome between different types of exon 20 EGFR
mutations
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Study Agent: AUY922
2.1.1 Heat Shock Proteins 
Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are molecular chaperones, which play a vital role in the maintenance of the proteome. HSPs assist in the structural folding and stabilization of a broad range of proteins within the cells, which are commonly referred to as “client proteins.” Without active HSPs, these client proteins become misfolded and subject to ubiquitination and degradation within the proteasome. 
HSP90, an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone, is the most abundant form of HSPs that 
accounts for 1-2% of all proteins within the cell ( Welch and Feramisco 1982
). There are vast 
majority of client proteins within the cell that is dependent upon HSP90 ( Pratt and Toft 2003 ), 
some summarized in Table 1, and the list keeps growing every year with more than 200 client proteins identified up to date ( Li, Zhang, and Sun 2009
). HSP90 consist of three domains, a 24-
28 kDa NH 2-terminal region, 33-44 kDa middle region, and a 11-15 kDa COOH domain ( Banerji 
2009 ). The primary functions of these domains are ATP binding, client protein binding and 
dimerization, respectively (Banerji 2009 ). HSP90 forms multi-chaperone complex with a variety

stabilization, a process that is ATP-dependent ( Pratt 1998 ). Pratt and Toft, in their 2003 review 
article, have elegantly suggested a mechanism involving 5 proteins ( Pratt and Toft 2003 ). The 
co-chaperones HSP40 and HSP70 forms a unit which couples with HSP90 through the co-chaperone HOP. In this conformation the complex is able to bind to the client protein and the structure is stabilized by the entry of p23 that binds to HSP90. Recently, it has been discovered that HSP90 binding to p23 is possible through the Sgt-1 co-chaperone. HSP90 and Sgt1-CS couples through the N-domain of HSP90 and forms a closed complex that later interacts with p23/sba1 ( Zhang, et al 2008
).

Most tumors do not depend de novo on a single protein abnormality, but on multiple pathway 
driven processes with redundancies that enable a number of proteins to activate the same pathways for proliferation ( Erlichmann 2009
). Due to the multitude of client proteins that HSP90 
affects, HSP90 inhibitors simultaneously have th e potential to disrupt multiple targets in parallel 
signal transduction pathways by inactivating a large number of oncoproteins, with their crucial targets varying in different cell types. Thus HSP90 inhibitors are expected to have broad utility 
in oncology. It has been shown that in many tumors HSP90 is either overexpressed and/or exclusively complexed into an activated state with its co-chaperones ( Kamal, et al 2003
). Many 
of the HSP90 client proteins are key regulators in cell proliferation, survival and apoptosis. Moreover, oncoproteins are often expressed as mutant forms which depend on HSP90 for proper folding and stability more than their wildtype counterparts. Furthermore, cancer cells present an environment of cellular stress that requires a high level of intact chaperoning activity. By inhibiting HSP90, it is believed, cancer cells will be deprived of key oncogenic proteins for their survival, giving potential HSP90 inhibitors a wide range of molecular targets within cancer cells; a desired outcome in aggressive tumor types such as advanced non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This concept is supported by pre-clinical studies, where HSP90 inhibitors induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a variety of hematological and solid malignancies including lymphomas, sarcomas and NSCLC cell lines.

This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.There are several HSP90 inhibitors currently in development, and 17-AAG (an analogue of 
geldanamycin, which is a naturally occurring antibiotic) has been the most studied. It should also be noted that geldanamycin has been the choice of agent to identify HSP90 client proteins in
vitro . Pre-clinical work with 17-AAG has shown activity in a wide range of cancer models. In 
osteosarcoma cell lines 17-AAG significantly down regulated cellular proliferation markers such as pAKT, p44Erk, p-mTOR, cyclinD-1 and other proteins ( Gazitt, et al 2009
). Growth were 
inhibited, and VEGFR expression was suppressed when 17-AAG was applied to a variety of neuroblastoma cell lines ( Jayanthan, et al 2008
). Synergistic effects of 17-AAG has also been 
shown with radiation in esophageal and NSCLC cell lines ( Kim 2009 , Wu 2009 ). 
17-AAG has been studied extensively in the clinic. It has shown to prolong stable disease inpatients with melanoma, lung, prostate and renal cancers ( Solit and Rosen 2006
). Combination
treatment has shown beneficial in some settings, where in a combination study with trastuzumaba partial response where reported in a HER2 positive breast cancer patient ( Modi, et al 2006
). In
combination with paclitaxel, a partial response was observed in a lung cancer patient who hadpreviously responded to erlotinib ( Solit and Rosen 2006
). Responses has also been reported in
hematological settings where 17-AAG has shown a partial response in one patient in a 14 patientphase 1 study in multiple myeloma ( Mitsiades, et al 2005
).
17-DMAG (alvespimycin) is a hydrophobic derivate of 17-AAG that is water soluble with goodbioavailability. 17-DMAG does not have the stability and solubility problems as seen with17-AAG. In vitro  studies have shown DMAG to be potent, especially in combination with
radiotherapy in NSCLC cell lines, NCI-H460 and A549 ( Kol, et al 2008
). In the clinic, partial
responses has been observed in a hormone refractory prostate cancer patient and in a melanomapatient in a 25 patient phase 1 study ( Pacey, et al 2009
). Combination treatment with 17-DMAG
and trastuzumab achieved a partial response in a heavily pretreated HER2 positive metastaticbreast cancer patient in a 21 patient phase 1 study ( Miller, et al 2007
).
With CNF 1010, an oil-in-water nanoemulsion of 17-AAG, 3 minor responses were observed in 
patients with melanoma, gastric and duodenal cancers ( Saif, et al 2006 ). In a phase I study with 
the novel HSP90 inhibitor IPI-504, decreased uptake of 18F-FDG in PET scans was observed in 7 
out of 18 patients with progressive GIST following imatinib and sunitinib treatment, and 6 
patients experienced stable disease for  4 treatment cycles (Demetri, et al 2007 ). A recent 
phase 2 study in advanced NSCLC showed prolonged disease stabilization and partial responses in patients with EGFR wild type, EGFR activating mutations, and EML4-ALK translocation kinase after receiving IPI-504 bi-weekly with a one week rest ( Sequist, et al 2010
). 
Collectively, all these data confirm that targeting HSP90 in various tumors to have anti-
neoplastic effect. 
2.1.2 AUY922
2.1.2.1 Mechanism of action 
AUY922, an isoxazole derivative, inhibits the ATPase activity of HSP90 by competitively binding to the ATP binding pocket of the N-Terminal, which causes the dissociation of client proteins, resulting in their ubiquitination and degradation within the proteasome through a cascade of events. This translates into an anti-tumor effect in non-clinical in vitro and in vivo  
studies (please see the current AUY922 Investigator’s brochure for details). Binding of AUY922

ADP-bound confirmation and prevents the step-wise binding of p23 described above, a process that is ATP dependent. This results in the chaperone complex dissociating and the relocation of the protein heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1) to the nucleus of the cell where it binds to the promoter region of the heat shock genes, named heat shock elements (HSE), and induces the transcription of stress-inducible proteins, including HSP70 and HSP27, up to 100 to 1000 fold concentrations in comparison to unstressed base-line levels ( McCollum, et al 2008
). 
2.1.2.2 In vitro pharmacology 
The ATPase activity of AUY922 was measured in a special fluorescence polarization assay and the drug was demonstrated to have potent HSP90 binding activity (IC
50: 30 nM). 
At the cellular level, AUY922 inhibition of HSP90 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In turn, this inhibits the proliferation of a range of tumor and non-tumor cell lines at low nanomolar concentrations. In studies involving the breast cancer cell line BT-474, AUY922 was shown to have strong antiproliferative activity (GI
50: 2.8 nM). The anticancer activity of AUY922 was also 
evaluated in 46 primary human tumor samples of 11 different human tumor types (bladder cancer, colon, liver, NSCLC, small cell lung, mammary, ovary, pancreatic and renal cancer, melanoma, pleuramesothelioma) and 3 preparations of hematopoietic stem cells in vitro  using a 
clonogenic assay. Recent work completed at UCLA by Dr. Garon and colleagues has shown that AUY922 inhibit a wide range of NSCLC cell lines including ones with EGFR mutations and KRAS mutations at concentrations below 100 nM ( Garon, et al 2009
). 
As explained in more detail in the introduction section, a key step in the functioning of HSP90 is the formation of a complex with the co-chaperone protein p23. This action is driven by the binding of ATP to the complex. In the presence of an ATP competitive inhibitor such as 17-AAG, the HSP90-p23 complex was shown to dissociate (Georgakis and Younes 2005
). In 
BT-474 breast cancer cells, AUY922 was shown to destabilize the HSP90-p23 complex in a concentration dependent manner and this mechanistically demonstrated the compound’s ability 
to disrupt HSP90 activity. 
With the inhibition of the HSP90 target, the downstream effects of AUY922 inhibition were 
examined. It was found that a variety of client proteins had been degraded, and a number of signaling pathways disrupted. The effect of AUY922 on the cellular content of several client proteins were analyzed in BT-474 tumor cell and the compound was shown to affect both ErbB2 and p-AKT in a dose dependent manner, confirming that inhibition of HSP90 catalytic activity induces destabilization of HSP90 client proteins, and leads to their degradation within the proteasome. 
2.1.2.3 In vivo  pharmacology 
The anti-tumor effect of AUY922 was evaluated in a number of tumor xenograft models. AUY922 was administered intravenously (i.v.) on a three times weekly schedule to the NSCLC cancer xenograft model NCI-H1975. Efficacy in this experiment was assessed by dividing the change in tumor volume with the change in the vehicle group. The experiment demonstrated a cytostatic effect at a dose level of 50 mg/kg, reaching a Treatment vs Control (T/C) ratio of 21 %. In another xenograft model, A549 cell lines, the same dose and treatment schedule was less potent but still showed cytostatic effect with a T/C ratio of 45. For more information about

Investigators Brochure. 
2.1.2.4 Preclinical safety of AUY922 
The preclinical safety profile of AUY922 was studied in rat and dog toxicology studies. Two separate dosing schedules were utilized during toxicology studies. During the 2-week studies in rats and dogs, AUY922 was administered i.v. every other day. During the 4-week studies AUY922 was administered in a once- weekly i.v. schedule. 
The main significant findings from both set of toxicology studies in both species were cytotoxic 
and inflammatory reactions in the intestine, bone marrow, adrenal glands, and lymphoid tissue. A moderate risk of local irritation at the injecti on site was also noted in rats. All toxicities were 
reversible. However, there is a risk that patients may experience GI toxicities such as diarrhea following AUY922 treatment. Hence, patients should be followed closely by the diarrhea management plan. No ocular histopathological changes were determined. 
In vitro  cardiac safety studies demonstrated a pre-clinical signal for QT prolongation, however 
no effects, such as QTc prolongation or proarrhythmia, were observed in the GLP dog and 
monkey telemetry studies in vivo . Due to potential cardiac toxicity, patients in ongoing clinical 
studies are undergoing extensive cardiac monitoring. These safety parameters will be monitored in the current study using an intensive ECG and vital signs monitoring schedule. Due to the potential risk of local irritation the infusion site should be monitored carefully during the time of infusion, if a peripheral line is used for the infusion of the study drug. 
For a detailed description and results of the pre-clinical safety studies please refer to the current 
AUY922 Investigator’s Brochure. 
2.1.3 Clinical experience 
There are several studies assessing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of AUY922 in both solid and hematological malignancies. Detailed information on safety, efficacy, and PK data from patients treated at dose levels from 2 to 70 mg/m
2 can be found in the current AUY922 
Investigator’s brochure. Below is a brief summary of the relevant clinical experience thus far. 
CAUY922A2101: A Phase I study of AUY922 in patients with advanced solid tumors 
The FIH phase I study [CAUY922A2101] to determine safety and tolerability of AUY922 as a 
single agent in adult patients with solid malignancies, has been completed. A total of 101 patients were treated with AUY922 at increasing dose levels from 2 mg/m
2 to 70 mg/m2. Of the 
patients enrolled in the two highest dosing cohorts (i.e., 54 and 70 mg/m2), 5 DLTs were 
reported. Grade 3 asthenia and grade 3 diarrhea were reported in two patients in the 54 mg/m2 
cohort. In the 70 mg/m2 cohort, two patients reported grade 3 visual symptoms and one patient 
experienced grade 3 diarrhea. Based on the available safety profile, the 70 mg/m2 dose 
administered intravenously once weekly was declared as the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) (Samuel 2010
). 
The most common adverse events in the highest dosing cohorts, regardless of AUY922 relationship, included diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, decreased appetite, asthenia, abdominal pain, anemia, night blindness, dyspnea, pyrexia, constipation, headache, and hypokalemia. Most toxicities were associated with either the gastrointestinal or visual system.

CONFIDENTIAL 
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.In the highest dose cohorts of 54 mg/m2 and 70 mg/m2, patients reported grade 1-3 visual 
symptoms including but not limited to: delayed dark to light adaptation, blurred vision, floaters 
and flashes in peripheral vision, dark or black spots, darkening of visual field, reduced night vision, decreased peripheral vision, decreased color vision and dry eye syndrome. Per investigator follow-up, all visual symptoms suspected to be related to AUY922 resolved after discontinuation or dose reduction of AUY922 treatment. 
 
CAUY922A2206: A Phase 2 Study of AUY922 in NSCLC Patients 
 
As of April 2012, 121 patients with NSCLC have been treated on this phase 2 study examining the activity of AUY922 in patients with defined molecular subtypes of NSCLC who had received prior chemotherapy. The molecular groups included were those with EGFR mutations, those 
with KRAS mutations, those with EML4-ALK  rearrangements, and those that were wild-type for 
all 3 driver mutations. Patients were treated at 70mg/m
2 and the primary outcome was rate of 
partial response (PR) and prolonged stable disease (SD; >18 weeks) within each molecular subgroup. Interestingly, the EGFR mutant subgroup had a 20% response rate and the ALK 
rearranged group had a 29% response rate on this phase II study (Garon, 2012), supporting further study of AUY922 in both of these molecularly-defined patients groups.  The most frequent adverse events (AEs, all grades) were visual AEs (77%), diarrhea (74%), and nausea (46%). Overall 7% of patients had a grade 3 or 4 AE involving visual symptoms; most commonly photopsia (20%), visual impairment (19%), vision blurred (18%), night blindness (17%), and visual acuity reduced (17%). These effects were all reversible upon discontinuation of drug. 
2.1.4 Pharmacokinetics of AUY922 
As of February 18
th, 2010, preliminary PK data are available from 100 patients in the first dose 
escalation clinical trial for AUY922 [CAUY922A2101]. PK profiles of AUY922 and its inactive 
metabolite BJP762 obtained on Days 1, 22, and 29 for dose cohorts of 2, 4, 8, 16, 22, 28, 40, 54, and 70 mg/m
2 were assessed by noncompartmental analysis. 
As of February 18th, 2010, preliminary PK data are available from 20 patients from the second 
clinical trial at 8, 16, 30, 45, 60 and 70 mg/m2 [CAUY922A2103]  and 16 patients from the third 
clinical trial at 8, 16, 22, 28, and 40 mg/m2 (CAUY922A1101). 
Following a weekly i.v. infusion (1 hr duration), AUY922 blood concentration followed a bi-exponential decline with a fast phase (t1/2 <10 min) and a slow terminal phase (t1/2~80hr). Peak concentration Cmax occurred at the end of infusion for both AUY922 and BJP762 (Tmax around 1 hr). No apparent drug accumulation for either AUY922 or BJP762 was observed following weekly dosing. AUY922 blood Cmax increased proportionally with dose, though blood AUC was less than dose-proportional. The observed nonlinear blood AUC of AUY922 with dose was likely caused by saturable distribution of AUY922 to red blood cells (RBC). The increase in the exposure ratio of BJP762/AUY922 reached a maximum at a dose of 28 mg/m
2. The dose 
dependent exposure ratio of BJP762 to AUY922 was also observed, possibly due to the nonlinear distribution of AUY922 to RBC, and the linear distribution of BJP762 to RBC. Both AUY922 blood CL and Vss increased with dose. At 70mg/m
2, the Vss value was over 1000 L, 
suggesting extensive distribution of AUY922 to the tissues. The observed dose-dependent

PK results of AUY922 observed thus far are generally consistent between three studies [CAUY922A2101], [CAUY922A2103] , and CAUY922A1101. 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of AUY922 was determined in an open-label, single-center, phase I study following a single intravenous administration of 30 mg [
14C]AUY922 in healthy male volunteers [CAUY922A2105]. Mass balance was achieved in 
this study with   93.8% of the administered radioactivity being recovered in the excreta of all 
four patients after 13 days. In feces, 73.0 - 78.7% of the dose was recovered while 15.1 - 23.5% of the dose was recovered in the urine. The most prominent biotransformation pathways for AUY922 in humans was direct glucuronidation at the 2-hydroxy position on the 2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-phenyl ring of AUY922 to yield M29.7/BJP762 and conversion of the isoxazole ringto a dihydro-pyranone ring by isoxazole ring-opening followed by re-cyclization through the 2-hydroxy group in the adjacent 2,4-dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-phenyl ring to yield M29.1/BGX833.Unchanged AUY922 in urine and feces accounting for 0.39-1.16% and 4.82-27.5% of dose,respectively. The higher total radioactivity exposure observed in blood relative to plasmasuggested that the drug-related radioactivity was significantly distributed to blood cells. Incontrast to AUY922, metabolite BJP762 does not distribute to blood cells to any significantdegree.
2.2 Study Disease: EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC 
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cause of cancer mortality in men and women in the U.S. Approximately 170,000 Americans will be diagnosed with NSCLC this year and approximately half of them will have advanced or metastatic disease at presentation, which is not curable. Chemotherapy and biologically targeted agents can extend survival modestly for these patients; however, discovery of novel ways to prolong the disease course is a top research 
priority. 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway plays a central role in the 
neoplastic transformation of NSCLC and promotes cancer cell survival, metastasis, and angiogenesis. The predominance of EGFR signaling in NSCLC makes the pathway an attractive candidate for the development of targeted therapeutics. In the last eight years, the FDA has approved two drugs in this class for salvage treatment of NSCLC, gefitinib (Iressa ®, formerly known as ZD1839) and erlotinib (Tarceva ®, formerly known as OSI-774). Both are small molecule orally-bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of the EGFR TK domain. Erlotinib improves survival compared to placebo when administered after failure of first line or second line chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC and is currently approved for that indication (Shepherd, 2005). Gefitinib received accelerated approval for salvage treatment of NSCLC based on response to treatment and symptom improvement in phase II clinical trials, but then a randomized placebo-controlled trial failed to demonstrate a survival benefit and gefitinib is no longer available in the US. (Thatcher, Lancet 2005).

CONFIDENTIAL 
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.Our group and others described somatic mutations in the EGFR gene that sensitize NSCLC 
tumors to TKIs, present in about 10% of unselected US patients with NSCLC but in up to 50% 
of never-smoking NSCLC patients. (Lynch 2004 and Paez 2004). EGFR mutations confer a state of “oncogene addiction” on the molecular biology of the tumor, such that the critical downstream signaling pathways are solely controlled by EGFR and are therefore highly susceptible to cell death by blockade of EGFR. Multiple randomized trials have now confirmed a progression-free survival benefit when patients with EGFR mutations are treated with genotype-directed strategies like using first-line gefitinib or erlotinib compared to standard chemotherapy. (Mok 2009, Mitsudomi 2010, Rosell 2012). This targeted strategy has evolved to being considered standard of care for patients with EGFR mutations. (Ettinger 2012). 
 Though EGFR mutations primarily consist of overlapping deletion mutations in the LREA region of exon 19 or the point substitution mutation L858R in exon 21, though there are several less common EGFR mutations, for example exon 20 insertion mutations of EGFR . This class of 
EGFR-mutants seems to have an EGFR-addicted biology, but have historically reaped little benefit from EGFR-directed therapy due to the low affinity of this mutation for direct EGFR inhibitors, especially erlotinib and gefitinib (Yasuda, 2011). Identifying alternative targeted therapeutic options for exon 20 EGFR  mutation-positive patients is a priority.  
2.3 Rationale
 EGFR is a client of Hsp90 and there is strong pre-clinical evidence that Hsp90 inhibition may be preferentially effective in cancers with EGFR mutations (Shimamura, 2008 and 2012). However, 
other Hsp90 inhibitors have disappointingly failed to show significant activity in EGFR 
mutation-positive NSCLC patients, though most of the patients on these studies were treated after acquiring resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Sequist, 2010 and Wong, 2011).  
 
As discussed above, in the ongoing phase II [ CAUY922A2206] study of AUY922 in NSCLC, 
there has been a 20% response rate among patients with EGFR mutations, the highest response to 
Hsp90 inhibition seen in this patient group to date. At least one of the EGFR-mutant responders 
had an exon 20 insertion mutation, an 80 year-old woman with advanced NSCLC who had been treated with first-line erlotinib and had not responded but rather experienced progressive disease after about 4 months of therapy. She went on AUY922 as second-line therapy and achieved a partial response on her first restaging with a 35% reduction in tumor burden, improving to a 42% decrease on her confirmation of response scans 6 weeks later. This type of marked response to therapy and clinical benefit in an EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation-positive patient is atypical, 
provocative, and deserving of further study. This is the basis of the current trial.  AUY922 will be administered intravenously at a dose of 70 mg/m
2 on a weekly schedule. This 
dose and schedule is the established MTD from study [ CAUY922A2101 ] and has demonstrated 
partial responses across a range of genotypes in NSCLC in the ongoing phase II protocol [CAUY922A2206 ].

x ECG should be reviewed by a clinician to verify QTcF is not prolonged >500ms 
 
5.2 AUY922 Administration
5.2.1 How AUY922 is supplied 
Novartis supplies AUY922 in individual vials and/oramber-colored, glass ampoules. Vials will 
also be available.  Each vial is 20mL, each containing nominally 50 mg AUY9222 (calculated as free base).  The storage conditions for study drug will be described on the medication label. The vials/ampoules should be stored safely and separately from other drugs. Please see handling instructions. 
Dosage Forms:
Vials:  20 mL vials, each containing nominally 50 mg AUY922 (calculated as free base). 
Glass ampoules : 10 mL amber-colored, glass ampoules, each containing 10 ml of a 5 mg/ml 
active drug substance in 5% aqueous glucose solution. 
 
5.2.2 Preparation and storage for AUY922 
AUY922 is intended for IV infusion and should be diluted to the appropriate concentration (according to patient body surface area) in a 500ml infusion bag containing 5% dextrose or glucose (with a maximum infusion volume of 500 ml) prior to administration. Note that concentrations within the range of 
0.006 mg/ml up to 0.28 mg/ml are acceptable. The drug may be 
administered using a central line or via peripheral vein. If a peripheral line is used, the injection site should be monitored carefully during the time of infusion and at subsequent follow-up visits. 
Please follow the preparation instruction provided below.

5.3  Administration of AUY922 
x AUY922 will be administered to patients through a 0.2 μm in-line filter.  
14. Once the AUY922 Concentrate for Infusion has been compounded in the 
infusion bag, it should be administered immediately. 
15. The infusion set has to be flushed with a carrier solution (5% dextrose) prior 
administration of the infusion solution. 
16. From a microbiological point of view, the aseptic techniques, in-use storage 
time (60 minutes) and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the person who is 
administering the infusion (e.g. hospital pharmacist / nurse). 
17. From a chemical - and physicochemical point of view, in-use stability of 
AUY922 infusion solution has been demonstrated for a maximum of 6 hours at room temperature and at 2-8°C (opening of the Vials until end of infusion). 
18. Carefully inspect the final infusion solution prior to administration. The final 
infusion solution should be a clear solution free from any particles.  
19. The final infusion solution must be administered through an integrated or 
additional 0.2 μm in-line filter.

5.4 Definition of Dose-Limiting Toxicity 
N/A 
 
5.5 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines 
 In general, the use of any concomitant medication/therapies deemed necessary for the care of the patient is permitted with the following exceptions:  
x Therapeutic doses of warfarin sodium (Coumadin®) are not permitted. 
x Preliminary in vitro  metabolism studies suggest that AUY922 is a moderate CYP2C9, 
2C8, 2C19, and CYP3A4 inhibitor. Therefore, drugs known to be metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 should be used with caution because of the inherent potential risk of either reduced activity or enhanced toxicity of the respective concomitant medication and/or AUY922 with preliminary in vitro 
metabolism studies. Patients using concomitant medications known to be metabolized by these cytochrome p450 isoenzymes will not be excluded from the study. However, the patients must be carefully monitored for potentiation of toxicity due to individual concomitant medications. 
x Please refer to a list of known medications that are substrates, inhibitors, and inducers 
of CYP2C9, CYP2C8, 2C19, and 3A4/5 enzymes and avoid co-administration with 
AUY922 in For the most updated information, please also visit the following website:

If, after a patient has been enrolled, he/she requires the concomitant use of any of the medications which may cause QT prolongation, then the patient must be discontinued from the study. Excluded medications which may cause QTc prolongation are also listed and updated in web address: qtdrugs.org/medical-pros/drug-lists/drug-lists.htm . The investigator should 
instruct the patient to notify the study site about any new medications he or she takes after the start of the study drug.  
5.6 Duration of Therapy 
 
Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until one of the following criteria applies: 
x Disease progression.  
x Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, 
x Unacceptable adverse event(s), 
x Participant decides to withdraw from the study, or 
x General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant 
unacceptable for further treatment in the opinion of the treating investigator . 
 
Patients may continue to receive AUY922 beyond RECIST-defined progression at the 
discretion of the treating physician if they are continuing to show clinical benefit. 
 
5.7 Duration ofFollow Up  
 
Participants will be followed for survival every 3 months after removal from study or 
until death, whichever occurs first. Participants removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event. 
 
5.8 Criteria for Removal from Study
 
Participants will be removed from study when any of the criteria listed in Section 5.5 applies. The reason for study removal and the date the participant was removed must be documented in the study-specific case report form (CRF). Alternative care options will be discussed with the participant. 
 
In the event of unusual or life-threatening complications, participating investigators must immediately notify the Principal Investigator (or Protocol Chair), Dr. Lecia Sequist, at

Dose delays and modifications will be made using the recommendations in this section of the 
protocol. Toxicity assessments will be done using the CTEP Version 4.0 of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) which is identified and located on the CTEP website at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
.  
 If possible, symptoms should be managed symptomatically. In the case of toxicity, appropriate medical treatment should be used (including anti-emetics, anti-diarrheals, etc.). 
 
All adverse events experienced by participants will be collected from the time of the first dose of study treatment, through the study and until the final study visit. Participants continuing to experience toxicity at the off study visit may be contacted for additional assessments until the toxicity has resolved or is deemed irreversible. 
 
6.1 Anticipated Toxicities 
 The preclinical safety evaluation showed that the toxicity profile of AUY922 is dominated by cytotoxic and inflammatory reactions in the intestine, bone marrow and lymphoid tissue, as well as a moderate risk of local irritation at the injection site. The observed changes were reversible in the animal experiments. Nevertheless, there is  a probability that patients may experience diarrhea 
following treatment with AUY922. Safety pharmacology studies revealed no effects on CNS or respiratory functions.  Based on in vitro  and in vivo  data, a potential for cardiovascular toxicity, such as QTc 
prolongation or proarrhythmia could not be completely excluded. In vitro  cardiac safety studies 
demonstrated a pre-clinical signal for QT prolongation, however, no effects on QT or QTc were observed in the GLP dog and monkey telemetry studies in vivo . Due to potential cardiac toxicity 
patients in ongoing studies are undergoing careful cardiac monitoring.  No potential for genotoxicity ( in vitro  and in vivo) or phototoxicity ( in vitro ) was found in the 
preclinical safety studies conducted so far. Patients treated with this medication have had reversible ocular toxicities, see below.  In conclusion, main target organs for AUY922 are the intestine, bone marrow and lymphoid tissue. There may be a risk of QTc prolongation, of visual changes, and of a local irritative effect.  The cardiac safety parameters can be monitored in the clinic using an intensive ECG and vital signs monitoring schedule, see Section 6.2.3. Detailed instructions for the observation and treatment of diarrhea and visual toxicities are also provided in this study protocol, Sections 6.2 and 6.3. If a peripheral line is used for the infusion of the study drug, the injection site should be monitored carefully during the time of infusion.

Dose modification instructions for general adverse events are found in Section 6.3.  
6.2.1 Diarrhea Management 
 In previous studies, AUY922 was shown to induce gastrointestinal toxicities in some patients and therefore there is a substantial risk  that patients will develop diarrhea. 
Proactively look for occurrence of diarrhea after start of AUY922 treatment. Call patients at home, if necessary, to detect diarrhea early during the first 8 weeks. If no problems occur, instruct the patient to call if and when a problem does arise. 
General suggestions: 
x Stop all lactose-containing products, and alcohol 
x Stop laxatives, bulk fiber (i.e Metamucil
®, Procter & Gamble), and stool softeners 
(docusate sodium; Colace, Roberts) 
x Drink 8 to 10 large glasses of clear liquids per day (i.e water, Pedialyte® (Ross),Gatorade 
(Quaker), broth) 
x Eat frequent small meals (bananas, rice, applesauce, Ensure®, toast) 
x Stop high-osmolar food supplements such as Ensure Plus and Jevity Plus (with fiber) 
It is recommended that patients be provided loperamide tablets and that patients are instructed on 
the use of loperamide at cycle 1 in order to manage signs or symptoms of diarrhea at home. 
Patients should be instructed to start oral lope ramide (initial administration of 4 mg, then 2 mg 
every 4 hours (maximum of 16 mg/day) at the first sign of loose stool or symptoms of abdominal pain. At the beginning of each cycle, each patient should be specifically questioned regarding any experience of diarrhea or diarrhea related symptoms.   
Treatment of diarrhea grade 1 or 2
Diarrhea grade 1 or 2 will be treated with lopera mide (initial administration 4 mg, then 2 mg 
every 4 hours (maximum of 16 mg/day) or after each unformed stool). 
 
24 hours after the start of diarrhea, if: 
Diarrhea resolved 
x Continue dietary modifications 
x Gradually add solid foods to diet 
x Discontinue loperamide after 12-hour interval without diarrhea 
x See Section 6.3 for dose modification recommendations upon re-initiation of 
AUY922

x Continue dietary modifications 
x Gradually add solid foods to diet 
x Discontinue loperamide and/or other agents after 12-hour interval without diarrhea 
x See Section 6.3 for dose modification recommendations upon re-initiation of AUY922 
 
Diarrhea unresolved 
x If persistent diarrhea (CTCAE grades 1 or 2) after 2x 24 hours with high dose 
loperamide and opiates, admit to hospital and follow recommendations for grade 
3/4 diarrhea until resolved.  
 
If diarrhea has progressed to CTCAE grades 3 or 4, begin measures outlined below 
 
Treatment of diarrhea grade 3 or 4
Severe diarrhea grade 3 or 4 may be treated with hospitalization, high dose loperamide (initial 
4 mg, then 2 mg every 2 hours) and addition of opium tincture or dihydrocodeine tartrate tablets/injections. Additionally, intravenous fluids and antibiotics may be given as needed with monitoring of the patient’s condition to rule out other causes for diarrhea. Observe for response.  
24 hours after the start of diarrhea, if diarrhea is unresolved: 
x Administer subcutaneous octreotide (100-500 ȝg TID) 
x Consider intravenous fluids and antibiotics as clinically indicated.  
x If grade 3 or 4 diarrhea persists, patients should receive opium tincture or 
dihydrocodeine tartrate by subcutaneous or intra-muscular injection.  
x If grade 3 or 4 diarrhea persists despite opium tincture or dihydrocodeine, 
subcutaneous octreotide (500-1000 ȝ g TID) should be administered.  
x See table 5 for dose modifications secondary to diarrhea.

x Endoscopic examinations may be considered only if absolutely necessary. The bowel is 
likely to be fragile with evidence of colitis and thus great care and caution must be 
exercised in undertaking these invasive procedures. 
6.2.2 Ocular Toxicity Management 
 Weekly administration of AUY922 may cause visual symptoms. The visual symptom descriptions from ongoing phase studies have included slow dark-light adaptation or photophobia, blurred vision, floaters and flashes in peripheral vision, dark or black spots, darkening of vision, decreased peripheral vision, color vision disturbances, and dry eye syndrome. The visual symptoms were mostly reported the day after the second or third infusion and typically resolved within a week or two weeks post dose. All visual symptoms were reversible; in some patients the events resolved with omission of a dose or after discontinuation of AUY922 treatment.  The standard recommendation for managing visual toxicities with AUY is to hold the drug if toxicities are grade 2 or higher. See Section 6.3 for dose reduction guidelines.  Standard ophthalmologic assessments will be required at baseline and follow-up exams will be conducted at the time when visual symptom(s) are reported (if any), at the beginning of cycle 3 if no visual symptom(s) are reported, and at study discontinuation.  
The following standard ophthalmologic assessments are required: 
1. Visual acuity test 
2. Intraocular pressure test 
3. Slit-lamp test 
4. Dilated fundus test 
5. Color-vision (Ishihara-plate) test 
 Additional assessments or tests may be conducted as clinically indicated. Visual symptoms will be graded using NCI CTCAE 4.0. However, for the acuity test (Snellen charts) the following grading should be applied.

In telemetry studies in monkeys, no clear effects on the QTc interval have been observed following administration of AUY922. But based upon in vitro and in vivo data, a potential for 
cardiovascular toxicity, such as QTc prolongation or proarrhythmia with AUY922 could not be excluded; therefore, cardiovascular monitoring will be conducted throughout the study.  As part of the screening process, patients will be required to undergo either a MUGA or transthoracic echocardiogram to assess left ventr icular ejection fraction (LVEF). Patients will be 
closely monitored by ECG throughout the study, see schedule below. If cardiac changes are observed during monitoring, please refer to Section 6.3 for dose modifications.

6.3 Dose Modifications/Delays 
 
If the patient experiences unacceptable toxicities, treatment with the study drug should be suspended until the toxicities return to   CTCAE grade 1 (or baseline). Dose modification may 
be required upon treatment resumption, see below.   Patients whose treatment is interrupted or permanently discontinued due to an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value should be followed at least once a week for 4 weeks, and subsequently at 4-week intervals, until resolution or stabilization of the event, whichever comes first. If a patient requires a dose delay of >21 days from the intended day of the next scheduled dose, then the patient must discontinue the study. All patients will be followed for adverse events and serious adverse events for 28 days following the last dose of AUY922.

Toxicity will be assessed using the NCI-CTC for Adverse Events, version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0)  For patients who are unable to tolerate the protocol-specified dosing schedule, schedule adjustments are permitted. This includes the ability to skip a week of dosing if needed up to once per cycle.  Dose reduction levels are listed in Table 4 and specific instructions for holding drug, reducing doses, and managing toxicities are listed in Table 5. Only two dose level reductions are allowed per patient.

7. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES  
Patients with available tumor tissue will have EGFR exon 20 analyzed by direct sequencing 
if they have not already had this testing. The purpose of this is to know the exact exon 20 mutation for all patients on the study, variations in outcome by mutation type can be explored. Some of the participating institutions use direct sequencing already as their clinical test to identify these patients, while some use a sizing assay that does not provide the exact insertion or insertion/deletion mutation. Patients without available tumor tissue will be eligible to participate in the study and will not have to undergo a biopsy.

4. Standard ophthalmologic assessments will be required at baseline and follow-up exams will be conducted at the time when visu al symptoms are reported (if any), at 
cycle 3 day 1 if no visual symptoms are reported, and at study discontinuation. There is a +/- 7 day window allowed for eye exa m at Cycle 3 day 1 
5. One should aim to administer AUY922 on the same day each week, but there is a +/- 2 day window allowed to account for holida ys, inclement weather, transportation 
difficulties, etc. For patients who are unable to tolerate the protocol-specified dosing schedule, schedule adjustments are per mitted. This includes the ability to skip a 
week of dosing if needed up to once per cycle. Patients who continue treatment beyond progression can skip up to two infusions per cycle if needed after discussion 
between the treating MD and the overall PI of the study. 
6. A CT scan with contrast of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed on patients at baseline (screening) -30 to -1 da ys prior to study drug administration. The 
same type of imaging modality (CT with contrast or MRI) used at screening must be used for all subsequent follow-up assessments. Follow-up CT/MRI scans will be performed every 6 weeks (±7 days) from registration. 
7. In the event that a patient is discontinued from treatment for any reason other than disease progression, an end of treatmen t CT/MRI is recommended to be performed 
if the last scan was conducted ≥  4 weeks previously. Such patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than disease progression should be re-stag ed 
every 12 weeks (±7 days) until start of another anti-cancer treatment. 
8. Patients will be followed for survival every 3 months after discontinuing the trial. Follow-ups may be conducted over the te lephone. 
9. If available, tumor samples will be sequenced for EGFR exon 20 mutation. 10. For patients who miss a D1 visit of any cycle (as allowed per protocol,) any missed day 1 assessments (for example, coagulation studies and urinalysis) will be performed at the next clinic visit.

9.MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT
9.1 Treatment Efficacy 
For the purposes of this study, participants should be re-evaluated for response every 
6 weeks. Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) (Eisenhauer et al., 2009). Changes in the diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria.
9.1.1 Disease Parameters 
Measurable disease
. Measurable disease is the presence of at least one (1) lesion 
that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter >
20 millimeters (mm) using conventional techniques (CT, MRI, x-ray) or 
>10 mm with spiral CT scan. Measurable lesions must be at least 2 times the 
slice thickness in mm. All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters  
(or decimal fractions of centimeters). 
Reminder: A lesion in a previously irradiated area is not eligible for measurable 
disease unless there is objective evidence of progression of the lesion prior to study enrollment. Lesions in previously irradiated areas must be clearly identified as such. 
  
Malignant lymph nodes
. To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be  15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT 
scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease
.
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with  10 to < 15 mm short axis, are 
considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses identified by physical exam that are not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques, and cystic lesions are all considered non-measurable. 
AUY922 in EGFR exon 20 Insertion Patients 
September 29, 2016 
 
Page 36 of 54 
CONFIDENTIAL 
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.Target lesions . 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Lesions must be accurately measured in 1 dimension with a minimum size of 10 mm by CT or MRI (slice thickness no greater than 5 mm), 20 mm by chest x-ray. Nodes must have a short axis  15 mm. The short axis should be included in the sum of the lesions in the 
calculation of response. Nodes that shrink to < 10 mm are considered normal. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size, be representative of all the involved organs, and should be lesions that can be followed with reproducible repeated measurements.  
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as 
CT or MRI can be considered target lesions if the soft tissue component  meets 
the definition of measurability as defined above. Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as target lesions. However, if non-cystic lesions are present, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. Lesions in previously irradiated areas or areas subject to other loco-regional therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression of that lesion.  Non-target lesions
.
All other lesions, including small lesions < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes measuring   10 mm to < 15 mm in short axis, as well as truly non-measurable 
lesions, which include leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, 
abdominal masses identified by physical exam that are not measurable by 
reproducible imaging techniques.  
9.1.2 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
The same method of assessment (CT or MRI) and the same technique should be 
used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Spiral CT should be performed using a 5 mm  contiguous 
reconstruction algorithm.  
9.1.3 Response Criteria  
9.1.3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 Complete Response (C R)
:
Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph node must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.

September 29, 2016 
 
Page 37 of 54 
CONFIDENTIAL 
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.Partial Response (PR) :
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. 
 Progressive Disease (PD) :
 At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study with at least a 5 mm 
absolute increase in the sum of all lesions. The appearance of one or more new lesions* denotes disease progression. 
 Stable Disease (SD):
 
 Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. 
Unknown (UN):
 Assessment of target lesions cannot be made due to 
insufficient or unevaluable data. In this case, a concise explanation must be given. 
Note : If tumor response data is missing for target lesions, the overall 
assessment must be UN unless there is new disease that would result in 
an overall assessment of PD. However, if there is missing or unevaluable data for non-target lesions, but data is available for all target lesions, the overall response for that time point will be assigned based on the sum LD of all target lesions. Additionally, the assessment of CR cannot be made if there is missing or unevaluable data for non-target lesions. In this case, the overall assessment would be PR. 
*Definition of New Lesion: The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (ex: new bone lesions may be 
healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow-
up scan in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size, etc.), follow-up evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD 
is confirmed, progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was discovered. 
9.1.3.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR):
 Disappearance of all non-target lesions. All 
lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size ( < 10 mm short axis).   
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD):  Persistence of one or 
more non-target lesions.

CONFIDENTIAL 
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new 
lesions* (new lesions must be > slice thickness) and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and /or overall level of substantial worsening that merits discontinuation of therapy. A useful test that can be applied when assessing non-targets for unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease. 
Unknown (UN):
 Assessment of non-target lesions cannot be made due 
to insufficient or unevaluable data. In this case, a concise explanation must be given. 
 
*Definition of New Lesion: The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (ex: new bone lesions may be healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow-up scan in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size, etc.), follow-up evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD 
is confirmed, progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was discovered. 
 
9.1.3.3 Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started). The participant's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Note :   Participants with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
reported as "symptomatic deterioration". Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 
 
9.1.4 Duration of Response 
Duration of overall response : The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrence or PD is objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started. 
Duration of overall complete response: 
The duration of overall CR is measured 
from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that 
recurrent disease is objectively documented. 
Duration of stable disease : Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started. 
 
9.1.5 Progression-Free Survival 
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of objective disease progression.

10. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
 
10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)
 
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or 
experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the study. 
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests. 
10.1.2 Serious adverse event (SAE)
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and 
regardless of causality that:  
x Results in death 
x Is life-threatening. Life-threatening means that the person was at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not 
include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more sever form. 
x Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (i.e., the event required at least a 24-hour hospitalization or prolonged a hospitalization beyond the expected length of stay). Hospitalization admissions and/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to 
study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before 
the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned). 
x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
x Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or

CONFIDENTIAL 
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.x Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and require medical  or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of 
such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Events notconsidered to be serious adverse events are hospitalizations for: 
x routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures 
x elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that did not worsen 
x emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious 
criteria outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission 
x respite care 
 
10.1.3 Expectedness 
 
Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.' 
 
10.1.3.1 Expected adverse event
 
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered expected
 when it appears in the 
Investigator’s Brochure or is included in the informed consent document as a potential risk. 
 
10.1.3.2 Unexpected adverse event
 
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected
 when it 
varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the Investigator’s Brochure or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk. 
10.1.4 Attribution 
 
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event 
and the study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows: 
 
x Related – The AE is clearly or may possibly be related to the study 
treatment.

Page 42 of 54 
CONFIDENTIAL 
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.x Unrelated – The AE is unlikely or clearly not related to the study 
treatment. 
10.2 Procedures for AE and SAE Recording and Reporting 
 
Reporting Participating investigators will assess the occurrence of AEs and SAEs at all 
participant evaluation time points during the study.  
 
All AEs and SAEs whether reported by the participant, discovered during questioning, directly observed, or detected by physical examination, laboratory test or other means, will be recorded in the participant’s medical record and on the appropriate study-specific case report forms. 
 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the CTEP NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting, and can be found on the CTEP website at: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic applications/ctc.htm
.  
 
10.3 Reporting Requirements 
 
Each participating investigator is required to abide by the reporting requirements set by 
the DF/HCC. The study must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations, local safety reporting requirements, and reporting requirements of the principal investigator.  
10.4 Reporting to the Study Sponsor 
10.4.1 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
 
All serious adverse events that occur after the initial dose of study treatment, during treatment, or within 30 days of the last dose of treatment must be reported 
to the DF/HCC Overall Principal Investigator Dr. Sequist (who is the Study 
Sponsor) on the local institutional SAE form. This includes events meeting the criteria outlined in Section 10.1.2, as well as the following: 
 
x Grade 2 (moderate) and Grade 3 (severe) events that are unexpected and at least possibly related/associated with the intervention. 
 
x All Grade 4 (life-threatening or disabling) events that are unexpected or 
not specifically listed in the protocol as not requiring reporting. 
 
x All Grade 5 (fatal) events while the participant is enrolled and actively participating in the trial OR when the event occurs within 30 days of the 
last study intervention.

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints 
 
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of AUY922 when administered intravenously on a once-weekly schedule at 70 mg/m2 in adult NSCLC patients with advanced disease and EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. The design will be a Simon two-stage phase 2 study, with 10 patients enrolled to the first stage and an additional 19 patients enrolled to the second stage provided we observe at least 1 partial or complete response or stable disease lasting  3 months in the first stage. 
 The Primary Objective is: 
x To evaluate the overall response rate to AUY922 in patients with advanced NSCLC and exon 20 insertion mutations in EGFR. 
 Secondary Objectives include: 
x To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the study 
population 
x To determine the safety and tolerability of AUY922 
x To explore variance in clinical outcome between different types of exon 20 EGFR 
mutations 
 
13.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate 
 
A Simon two-stage design will be used. In this design we will consider a rate of response plus SD lasting  3 months that is no greater than 5% as evidence that AUY922 is ineffective 
as a monotherapy in patients with exon 20 insertion mutations in EGFR, and 20% will be the 
target rate of effectiveness. In other words, Ho=0.05 and Ha=0.20. 
AUY922 in EGFR exon 20 Insertion Patients 
September 29, 2016 
Page 49 of 54 
CONFIDENTIAL 
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.This design requires that 10 patients will be initially enrolled (the first stage of the Simon 
design). If there are no responses or patients with SD lasting  3 months in these 10 patients 
then AUY922 will be considered ineffective in EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation patients. If 
at least 1 PR or SD lasting   3 months is noted, then an additional 19 patients will be enrolled 
(the second stage of the Simon design). 
If the total number of responses plus SD lasting  3 months in the entire set of 29 patients is 
4 or more, then AUY922 will be considered for further evaluation, likely in a randomized 
setting. If the number of responses of PR or SD lasting  3 months is 3 or fewer in the entire 
set of 29 patients, then AUY922 will be considered potentially ineffective and further investigation may be unwarranted. 
Using this design, if AUY922 is actually not effective, there is a 0.047 probability of 
concluding that it is (the target for this value was 0.050, the D-level). If the drug is actually 
effective, there is a 0.199 probability of concluding that it is not (the target for this value was 0.200, the beta-level [80% power]). The power and D-level are slightly different from the 
nominal values due to the discrete nature of the binomial distribution of response. 
Among the three participating clinics (MGH, DFCI and BIDMC), we expect to enroll 
approximately 1.5 patients per month. Therefore, assuming full enrollment to 29 patients, accrual should be complete within 20 months. 
13.3 Patient Disposition 
A detailed description of patient disposition will be provided. It will include: 
xA definition of patient enrollment
xA summary of data regarding patient discontinuation of study treatment
xA summary of data regarding patient inclusion and exclusion in efficacy and safety
analyses
13.4 Patient Characteristics 
Patient characteristics will include a summary of the following: 
xPatient demographics
xBaseline disease characteristics
xBaseline tumor molecular characteristics
xSignificant medical history and co-morbidities
xConcomitant therapies
xOther characteristics as appropriate
13.5 Safety of Treatment 
A summary of the adverse events and their attributed relatedness to treatment will be provided. All patients will be included in the safety analyses

Response rate will be assessed as per RECIST, see Section 9.1. Results will be reported with 
95% confidence intervals. All patients will be evaluable for response rate. 
13.7 Analysis of Progression-Free and Overall Survival 
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) will be defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of objective disease progression or death. Overall survival (OS) will be defined as the duration of time from start of treatment until death. Analysis will be performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. All patients will be evaluable for survival endpoints. 
14. PUBLICATION PLAN
At the end of the study, the results will be analyzed and a manuscript submitted for peer review 
within 24 months of the end of data collection.

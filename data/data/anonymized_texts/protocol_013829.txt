1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
This is a single  institution  phase  II trial designed  to assess  the therapeutic  activity  of CMVpp65  
specific  T-cells (CMVpp65 -CTL)  for the treatment  of CMV  infection  or persistent  CMV  viremia  after 
allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation.   T-cells for infusion  will be generated  from the 
seropositive  transplant  donor  by sensitization  using  autologous  dendritic  cells loaded  with a pool of 
overlapping  synthetic  peptides  spanning  the sequence  of CMVpp65.  
2.0 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
Primary  Objectives:  
1. To assess in a single  arm Phase  II trial, the therapeutic  activity  of transplant  donor  derived  
CMVpp65 -CTL for the treatment  of clinically  overt  CMV  infection  or CMV  viremia  that is persistent  
despite  2 weeks  of treatment  with antiviral  agents  such  as Ganciclovir  and /or foscarnet.  
2. Determine  the risk of inducing  GvHD  or increasing  its severity  by adoptive  transfer  of transplant  
donor  derived  CMVpp65 -CTL. 
Secondary  Objectives:  
 
1. Determine  the individual  efficacy  of transplant  donor  derived  CMVpp65 -CTLs  in decreasing  viral 
load by quantitating  the level of CMV  DNA in the blood  of patients  following  adoptive  transfer.  
2. Examine  the dynamics  of in-vivo proliferation  and survival  of adoptively  transferred  donor  derived  
CMVpp65 -CTLs  by sequentially  quantitating  the alterations  in frequency  and specificity  after 
adoptive  transfer.  
3. Determine  the degree  to which  treatment  with CMVpp65 -CTLs  can eliminate  or reduce  the exposure  
to antiviral  agents  such  as ganciclovir  and fosrcarnet  and thus reduce  the associated  morbidity  from 
organ  specific  toxicity  of antiviral  agents.  
3.0 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
 
Reactivation  of latent  cytomegalovirus  infections  remains  a major  cause  of morbidity  and mortality  
following  allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplants  (HSCT).   Although  prophylactic  or 
preemptive  treatment  with ganciclovir  or foscarnet  has reduced  the incidence  and mortality  of early 
CMV  infections  in HLA-matched  recipients  (1,2 ), in 6-30% of cases,  treatment  may be hampered  or 
cannot  be sustained  due to complicating  myelosuppression  or nephrotoxicity  (3,4 ).  Prolonged  anti- 
viral treatment  may also delay  the recovery  of virus -specific  immune  responses,  leading  to a 
significant  incidence  of late onset  disease.   After 3 months  of treatment  with ganciclovir,  late CMV  
infection  was reported  by Boeckh  et al. in 17.8%  of 146 seropositive  recipients  of HLA-matched  
unmodified  marrow  transplants  (5,6).   These  late infections  were  lethal  in 46% of cases,  and were  
asscociated  with persistent  deficiencies  in absolute  numbers  of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and CMV - 
specific  T-cells (5,6).   In our own study  of 255 recipients  of HLA-matched  CD34+E- T-cell depleted  
HSCT  who did not receive  post transplant  immunosuppression,  the cumulative  incidence  of CMV  
reactivation  among  seropositive  patients  was similar  to that reported  following  unmodified  HSCT  
(58%  vs 40-60%),  and only 12% developed  clinically  overt  disease  (7).  Similar  to findings  reported

for unmodified  allo HSCTs,  deficiencies  of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were  significantly  associated  with 
disease  (6,7).  
CMV  infections  are particularly  dangerous  in seropositive  recipients  of HLA non-identical  HSCT.  For 
example,  while  the overall  mortality  of CMV  infections  in recipients  of HLA-matched  HSCT  has been  
reduced  to 3-5%, (9,10)  mortality  rates  of 13-16% have been  reported  among  recipients  of HLA- 
haplotype  disparate  Tcell depleted  grafts  (11). Similarly,  for seropositive  recipients  of HLA partially  
matched  immunologically  naïve  cord blood  transplants,  the cumulative  incidence  of clinically  
significant  CMV  disease  has been  reported  to be as high as 29%,  with mortality  rates  of 6% to 9% 
despite  treatment  with antiviral  drugs  (12-14). 
 
Adoptive  Immunotherapy  for CMV  
Healthy  seropositive  individuals  contain  high frequencies  of CMV  and EBV-specific  CD4 [+] and CD8 
[+] T-cells,  ranging  from 0.4 - 3% of the total T-cell population,  that play a critical  role in controlling  in 
these  latent  viral infections  (8). The potential  of virus-specific  T-cells to control  CMV  and EBV 
infections  was initially  suggested  by the close  correlation  between  reconstitution  of CMV  and EBV 
virus-specific  CD8+  cytotoxic  T-cells and the potential  of allogeneic  HCT recipients  to clear  CMV  and 
EBV-induced  disease  (15-17). Subsequently,  we and others  have demonstrated  that adoptive  
transfer  of in vitro generated  transplant  donor -derived  virus specific  T-cells can clear  life-threatening  
clinical  CMV  infections  and induce  durable  remissions  of clonal  EBV-induced  lymphomas  emerging  
after allogeneic  HSCT  (18-30).  Our group  provided  the first demonstration  of the potential  of DLI to 
treat EBV lymphomas  in 1994  (25). Since  then,  we have been  conducting  a trial of transplant  donor  
derived  EBV-specific  T-cells in the treatment  of biopsy  proven  monoclonal  EBV lymphomas  post 
allogeneic  HSCT.  In our initial  experience,  three  weekly  infusions  of 106  EBVCTL/Kg  recipient  weight  
have induced  durable  CRs in 13/19  (68%)  patients  treated  (22,23).  
 
Riddell  et al.(26)  were  the first to demonstrate  the feasibility  and clinical  efficacy  of CMV  specific  T- 
cells for the prophylaxis  and treatment  of CMV  reactivation  in post transplant  patients.  In this study,  
14 patients  with persistent  CMV  viremia  or those  at high risk were  treated  with 4 escalating  weekly  
doses  of CMV -specific  CD8+  T-cell clones  (107, 3x 107, 108  and 109/m2) using  donor  peripheral   
blood  mononuclear  cells (PBMC)  sensitized  with autologous  CMV  infected  fibroblasts.   All 14 
patients  responded  by clearing  the viremia,  and none  of the patients  developed  GvHD.   Subsequent  
clinical  trials have demonstrated  clearance  of CMV  viremia  in recipients  of HLA matched  or one 
antigen -mismatched  related  or unrelated  donor  HSCT  treated  for persistent  CMV  viremia  
unresponsive  to antiviral  drugs  with infusion  of  5 x 105  – 1 x 106  CMV  specific  T-cells/kg   or 103- 104 
CMVpp65  responsive  IFNγ+   T-cells/kg  (21,27 -29).  Thus  studies  by Peggs  et al (21), and Einsele  et 
al (27), used  1 x 105/kg (Peggs)  or 3.3 x 105/kg(Einsele ) CMV  specific  T-cells for treating  CMV  
viremia  or infections  in recipients  of matched  related  or unrelated  HSCT  and demonstrated  
successful  clearance  of CMV  viremia  and reconstitution  of CMV  specific  immune  reponses  in 19/24  
treated  patients,  with no grade  2 or greater  GvHD.   Micklethwaite  et al (28) prophylactically  infused  5 
x 105CMVpp65 -CTL/kg    for prevention  of CMV  infections  in 12 recipients  of HLA matched  or 1 allele  
mismatched  related  or unrelated  HSCT  with only 4/12 patients  developing  transient  CMV  viremia   
and no increased  incidence  of GvHD  in this prophylaxis  trial. Feuchtinger  et al (29) treated  18 
patients  after allo-SCT from HLA–mismatched/  haploidentical  or HLA–matched  unrelated  donors   
with 2 x 104 IFNγ+   polyclonal  CMVpp65 -CTL /kg, 15/18  cleared  CMV  and there  was no reported

GvHD  in any of the cases.  
 
 
T-cells used  in these  studies  were  sensitized  against  CMV  using  PBMC  or autologous  dendritic  cells 
(DCs)  loaded  with viral lysate  (21,27),  or autologous  DCs transduced  with CMVpp65   (28), A third 
approach  employs  the isolation  of interferon -γ+  T-cells CliniMACS  using  IFNγ capture  microbeads  
(Miltenyi   Biotec)  (29). 
 
Our phase  I trial of transplant  donor -derived  CMVpp65  peptide  specific  T-cells (05-065) has 
completed  accrual  and required  follow  up and is being  readied  for publication.   Overall,  8/10 
evaluable  patients  that had failed  ganciclovir  and/or  foscarnet  durably,  cleared  CMV  viremia  after 
single  doses  of 0.5, 1 or 2 x 106 CMVpp65 -CTLs/kg;  all 46 patients  treated  with 3 weekly  doses  of 1 
x 106/kg CMVpp65  CTLs  cleared  CMV  viremia.   Elimination  of CMV  was consistently  correlated  with 
increments  in circulating  CMVpp65 -CTL of the same  epitope  specificity  and Vβ usage  as the infused  
CMVpp65 -CTL. Detectable  numbers  of CMVpp65  CTLs  were  sustained  for 2-4 months.   Acute  
toxicities  were  rare, no patient  developed  de novo GvHD.  
We now propose  a single -armed  Phase  II trial to evaluate  transplant  donor  derived  derived  
CMVpp65CTL  in the treatment  of CMV  infections.  This study  will allow  us to evaluate  the ability  of 
this treatment  modality  to prevent  or limit the use of anti-viral drugs  with their associated  toxicities  in 
patients  treated  with donor  derived  CMVpp65  T-cells.  
 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is a single -arm non-randomized  single  institution  phase  2 trial, designed  to evaluate  the 
therapeutic  activity  of CMVpp65 -CTLs  generated  from seropositive  HSCT  donors  when  adoptively  
transferred  into transplant  recipients  with persistent  CMV  infection  or viremia.  
Patients  eligible  for this trial will be consenting  recipients  of related  or unrelated  HSCT  who have an 
active  CMV  infection  or persistent  CMV  viremia  for ≥ 2 weeks  despite  treatment  with anti-viral 
agents  or who cannot  be maintained  on anti-viral therapy  due to treatment  related  toxicity.  
Patients  will be treated  with CMVpp65 -CTLs  derived  from their transplant  donor.  These  will be 
patients  with CMV  seropositive  transplant  donors  who have previously  provided  leukocytes  for 
generation  of CMVpp65 -CTL and for whom  such  CMVpp65 -CTL are available.  
CTLs  for infusion  will be generated  by repeated  sensitization  of donor  derived  T-cells over 28 days 
using  autologous  dendritic  cells (DCs)  or EBV transformed  B cells loaded  with a pool of 138 
synthetic  peptides  spanning  the sequence  of CMVpp65.  (confer  section  5.0 and appended  Standard  
Operating  Procedures).  
Concurrent  Therapy  : Antivirals  and Immunosuppression  
 
All patients  receiving  anti-viral drugs  may be maintained  at their current  doses  during  treatment  with 
CTLs.  Patients  can continue  treatment  with rapamycin  and calcineurin  inhibitors.   However,  steroid

doses  must  be adjusted  so that:  Patients  are receiving  no more  than 0.3 mg/kg  of prednisone  or its 
equivalent.  
Characterization  and Monitoring   of CMV  Infections  and T-cell Responses:  
 
Prior to and at specific  intervals  following  infusion  of CMVpp65 -CTL, patients  wil be monitored  for : 
1) vital signs  and clinical  and radiologic  responses  at sites of CMV  infection,  2) level of circulating  
CMV  DNA by PCR,  and levels  of CMVpp65 -CTL in the blood  as measured  by quantitation  of CTL 
precursor  frequencies,  CMVpp65 -specific  IFNγ+ T-cells (35 ), or epitope  specific -T-cells binding  
HLA-peptide  tetramers  (36).  The CMVpp65 -CTL infused  will also be characterized  as to TCR Vβ 
usage  and the sequence  of immunodominant  T-cells defined  so as to be able to track  disposition,  
and longevity  of these  T-cells post infusion.   Patients  will also be monitored  for any toxicities  as 
described  in section  11.0.  
4.3 Intervention  
 
The T-cells to be infused  will be selected  based  on criteria  mentioned  in section  4.0 from our bank of 
GMP  grade  CMVpp65 -CTL.  T-cells will be administered  by bolus  intravenous  infusion.   In this  
phase  II trial, patients  will be treated  at doses  of 1 x 106 CMVpp65 -CTL/kg/dose/week  for 3 weeks.  
Patients  will be observed  for the following  3 weeks.   Additional  3 week  courses of CMVpp65 -CTL 
may be administered  if levels  of CMV  DNA in blood  are still detectable  despite  disease  stabilization  
or improvement.  
The rationale  for the doses  of T-cells proposed  for treatment  stems  not only from our Phase  I trial  
but also from our own studies  of quantitating  doses  of unselected  T-cells required  to induce  GvHD  
and the doses  of EBV –CTLs  required  to induce  regressions  of EBV lymphomas  following  allogeneic  
HSCT.   Our studies  of the incidence  of GvHD  in recipients  of T-cell depleted  matched  or 1 allele  
mismatched  HSCT  suggest  that  a dose  of ≥ 105 allo cytotoxic  T-cell (CTLp)/kg,  as quantitated  by 
limiting  dilution  analyses,  represents  the threshold  dose  for development  of grade  II or greater  GvHD  
(39).  In-vitro sensitization  of T-cells against  CMV  or EBV for a period  of 28 days results  in 
preferential  proliferation  of antigen  specific  T-cells with simultaneous  depletion  of alloreactive  T-cells 
by at least 100 fold (34).  Therefore,  in the doses  of CMVpp65 -CTL proposed  for treatment  in this 
trial (1x 106/kg x 3 T-cells /kg), the doses  of potentially  alloreactive  T-cells administered  would  be 
estimated  to be below  the GvHD  threshold.   In practice,  the CMVpp65CTL  after this culture  period   
do not contain  detectable  allocytoxic  activity  against  patient  or fully allogeneic  PHA blasts.   Indeed,  
this lack of alloreactivity  is a release  criterion  that must  be met to use the cells for treatment.  
Our clinical  experience  also confirms  this. In our Phase  I trial of CMVpp65CTL,  no patient  developed  
GVHD.  Similarly,  none  of the 19 patients  with EBV lymphomas  in our study  developed  GvHD  when  
treated  with EBV specific  T-cells sensitized  for 4 weeks  with irradiated  autologous  EBV BLCLs  at 
doses  ranging  from 15-150 x 105 T-cells/kg  (21).  Rooney  et al (19 ), also observed  no cases  of 
GvHD  among  39 patients  treated  prophylactically  with transplant  donor  derived  EBV specific  T-cells 
generated  by a similar  technique  over a dose  range  of 3.3 – 33 x 105  T-cells /kg. 
Thus,  based  on our own experience,  as well as data from published  series,  the risk of GvHD  is 
expected  to be very low, and the doses  of infused  CMVpp65 -CTLs  will provide  enough  numbers  of 
CMV  reactive  T-cells to produce  effective  responses  against  CMV  infection.

5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS  
 
5.1 Donors  of CMV -Specific  T-cells  
 
The CMV -specific  T-cell lines to be used  for treatment  in this protocol  and to be maintained  
cryopreserved  under  GMP  conditions  in the Adoptive  Immune  Cell Therapy  Facility  at MSKCC,  will 
be derived  fromthe  groups  listed  below:  
 
1. Normal,  HLA-typed,   CMV -seropositive  donors  of allogeneic  hematopoietic  progenitor  cell 
allografts,  who previously  consented  and gave blood  or leukocytes  to establish  CMV -specific  T- 
cells to be used  to treat a CMV  infection  were  it to develop  in the patient  to whom  they donated  a 
hematopoietic  cell graft.  Once  that patient  has reconstituted  immune  function  and is no longer  at 
risk for CMV,  the donors  will be asked  for consent,  in writing,  for the use of these  T-cells to treat 
CMV  in a patient  other  than the patient  for whom  they were  originally  intended.  
 
2. Normal,  HLA typed,  CMV -seropositive  related  and unrelated  hematopoietic  cell transplant  donors  
who consent  to provide  blood  or blood  white  cells to make  CMV -specific  T-cells for treatment  of 
CMV  in the recipient  of their transplant  will also be asked  whether  the CMV -specific  T cell line 
generated  can be used  for another  patient,  at such  time as the transplant  recipient  is no longer  at 
risk for this complication.  
 
3. Normal,  HLA typed,  CMV -seropositive  volunteer  blood  donors  whose  T cells may add to the HLA 
diversity  of the T cells available  in the Adoptive  Immune  Cell Therapy  Bank.  
 
Adequate  health  for donation  as determined  by institutional  (related  donor)  or NMDP  (unrelated  
donor)  guidelines.   Normal  donors  will be evaluated  for evidence  of prior sensitization  to CMV  by 
CMV  serology.  They  will also be typed  for HLA A, B, C, DR and DQ. 
 
Clinical  studies  for donors  are obtained  within  1 week  of blood  donation  and include  CBC  with 
differential  and platelet  count.  Results  of tests  must  be within  a range  that would  not preclude  
donating  blood  or undergoing  leukapheresis.  Infectious  disease  markers  will be performed  as per 
each  department’s  guidelines  or at the discretion  of the treating  attending.  
For prospective  transplant  donors,  an informed  consent  will be obtained  and up to 2 blood  samples  
will be collected:  
 
i. An initial  donation  of 25 ml blood  (heparin  ACD)  to be used  for establishing  a B cell line 
transformed  with the B95.8  laboratory  strain  of EBV.   This EBV+  B cell line (EBV  BLCL)  will 
be used  as an antigen  presenting  cell for T-cell sensitization.   When  loaded  with the pool of 
CMVpp65  peptides,  the EBV BLCL  efficiently  sensitize  T-cells from the same  donors  against  
CMV  as well as EBV.  
 
The establishment  of the EBVBLCL  line requires  4-5 weeks  of in-vitro culture.  Therefore,  for 
recipients  of unrelated  or HLA disparate  HSCT   who are at high risk for severe  CMV  infection  
in the first 2-3 months,  this blood  sample  should  be collected  prior to the donation  of the 
hematopoietic  progenitor  cell transplant  whenever  possible.

ii. A donation  of a single  standard  2 blood  volume  leukapheresis  collected  in standard  ACD 
anticoagulant  is required  for the isolation  of adequate  numbers  of T-cells and feeder  cells 
required  for T-cell sensitization  and extended  culture  in vitro.  If a leukapheresis  is not 
possible,  a unit of whole  blood  is acceptable.  
 
In addition  to providing  for isolation  of T-cells for sensitization  with CMVpp65  peptide  loaded  
APCs,  this blood  donation  also provides  autologous  feeder  cells essential  to sustain  T-cell 
growth  without  the risk of stimulating  the growth  of alloreactive  T-cells capable  of inducing  
GvHD.  
 
This donation  of a leukapheresis  or a unit of blood  is obtained  from unrelated  HSCT  donors.  
 
In order  to limit the number  of donations  required  of any donor,  each  donor  will be informed  of, and 
asked  to consent  to, two other  potential  uses of the blood  cells in the donation.  They  include  
 
1. The making  of T-cells reactive  against  Epstein  Barr virus to treat treat lethal  
lymphomas  caused  by this virus in HSCT  recipients.  
2. The making  of T-cells reactive  against  a protein  called  W T-1, that is expressed  by 
malignant  blood  cells.  
 
Such  T-cells could  be used  under  separate  protocols,  to treat EBV associated  
diseases  (IRB 95-024) and /or to treat or prevent  leukemia  recurrence  (IRB 07-055) 
in the patient  receiving  the HSCT.  
 
In the event  that the T-cells isolated  and generated  from a given  donor  are not used  
by the intended  HSCT  recipient,  if the donor  so consents,  they will be cryopreserved  
and maintained  under  GMP  conditions  in the Adoptive  Immune  cell Therapy  Facility  
at MSKCC.  
These  stored  T-cells may be used  for the treatment  of other  patients  with CMV  or 
EBV infections/malignancies  (IRB 11-130) that express  HLA alleles  shared  by the 
donor.  
Generation  of  Antigen  Presenting  cells (Dendritic  cells and EBV BLCL  ) and Peptide  Loading  of 
APCs  
 
The DCs to be used  for T-cell sensitization  are generated  from PBMCs  isolated  from blood  
leucocytes  by Ficoll -Hypaque  gradient  separation  and enriched  for monocytes  by adherence  to 
plastic  sterile  tissue  culture  plates  or by positive  selection  with CD14  clinical  grade  microbeads  
(miltenyi)  if the frozen/thawed  PBMC  is used.   The monocytes  are then re-suspended  at a 
concentration  of 1 x 106  cells/ml  in RPMI  supplemented  with 1% heat inactivated  autologous  serum  
(if available)  or prescreened  heat inactivated  human  AB serum  (Gemini)  clinical  grade  GMCSF  
(2000  IU/ml)  and interleukin -4 (1000  IU/ml).   The cultures  are be supplemented  with these  cytokines  
on days 2 and 4 in fresh  medium as  indicated  by cell growth.   On days 5 or 6, 5 ng/ml  of TNFα , 2.5 
mg/ml  of IL-1β, 75 µg/ml of IL-6 and 0.5µg/ml PGE -2 are be added  for 48 hours  to induce  maturation  
of dendritic  cells.  Thereafter,  the dendritic  cells are be washed,  adjusted  to a concentration  of 1 x

106/ml, and loaded  with the pool (25µg complete  pool/ml)  of overlapping  CMV -pp65  synthetic  
peptides  (Invitrogen,  Boston  Massachussetts) in serum  free medium  at 37ºC  for 3 hours  and used  
for T-cell sensitization  as described  below.  
EBV transformed  B cells are be generated  as described  previously  (33 ), adjusted  to a concentration  
of 1 x 106/ml, and loaded  with 25µg CMVpp65  peptide  pool/ml  in serum free medium  at 37ºC  for 3 
hours  and used  for T-cell sensitization.  
 
Generation  of CMVpp65  Specific  T-cells 
 
T-cells will be generated  as described  in published  reports  and detailed  in the appendices  (34). 
Briefly,  CD3+  enriched  T-cell fractions  are initially  isolated  by ficoll-hypaque  gradient  separation  of 
peripheral  blood  leucocytes.   Thereafter,  monocytes  are depleted  by adherence  to the plastic  tissue  
culture  flasks  or by immunoadsorption  using  clinical  grade  CD14  immunomagnetic  microbeads  
(Miltenyi  Biotechnology,  Gmbh,  Gladback,  Germany)  if done  from frozen/thawed  PBMC.   The CD56+ 
NK+  cells and B cells are then removed  by immunoadsorption  to immunomagnetic  beads  coated  with 
clinical  grade  mouse  monoclonal  antibody  specific  for CD56  and CD19  respectively  (CliniMACS  
CD56  reagent,  Miltenyi  Biotechnology,  Gmbh,  Gladback,  Germany).   Aliquots  of 1 x 106 T-cells /ml 
will then be stimulated  with 0.5 x 105/ml autologous  irradiated  monocyte - derived  DC or with EBV 
BLCL  previously  loaded  with a pool of 138 synthetic  overlapping  pentadecapeptides  spanning  the 
sequence  of CMV  pp65.   The stimulated  T-cells will then be cultured  in modified  Yssel’s medium  
supplemented  with 5% pre-screened  heat inactivated  human  AB serum  in sterile  flasks  at 37ºC,  with 
5% CO2 in air.  The culture  will be re-stimulated  with the peptide  loaded  DCs or EBV BLCL  at an 
effector  to target  ratio of 10:1 at 7 day intervals  for 21-28 days.   Clinical  grade  IL-2 (Chiron)  will be 
added  to a concentration  of 10-80 IU/ml  every  3 days,  beginning  on day 7 and IL-15 weekly  at the 
dose  of 10ng/ml  (stimulation  with DCs does not potentiate  significant  expansion  of T-cells.  The 
earlier  initiation  of cytokine  stimulation  at higher  doses  permits  generation  of higher  numbers  of T- 
cells to meet  the dose  requirements  in the protocol.   IL-15 has been  described  as a potent  stimulator  
of T-cell expansion  in-vitro. After 21-28 days in culture,  the T-cells will be harvested,  counted  and 
tested  for potency,  specificity  and lack of alloreactivity,  microbiological  sterility,  and for levels  of 
endotoxin  (confer  appended  Standard  operating  procedures).   If a sufficient  number  of T-cells is 
obtained,  the T-cells will then be aliquoted  into sterile  vials in calculated  doses  tested  as detailed  
below  and cryopreserved  for subsequent  administration  to the recipient  of the donor’s  HSCT  or for a 
third party  recipient  if consented  for treatment  of CMV  infection  or persistent  viremia.   If additional  
numbers  of T-cells are required,  the pre-generated  CMVpp65 -CTLs  will be further  expanded  using  
OKT3,  IL2 and autologous  feeders  as described  in our currently  active  clinical  trial using  WT1  CTLs  
(IRB#07 -055) 
The dendritic  cells,  EBV BLCL  and T-cell lines will be generated  in the designated  Adoptive  Immune  
Cell Therapy  facility  of MSKCC  under  controlled  GMP  conditions.  
Characterization  of CMVpp65 -specific  T-cells 
 
Depending  on their growth,  T-cell cultures  will be evaluated  after 21-28 days of culture  for the 
proportion  of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and content  of CD3- CD56+  NK cells and CD20+  Cells.   They  
will also be evaluated  for their content  of CMVpp65  specific  IFNγ+   CD8+/CD4+ T-cells in response  to 
short   secondary  stimulation  with autologous  PBMC  loaded  with CMVpp65  peptide  pool.  Specificity

will also be ascertained  by demonstration  of the absence  of significant  responses  to secondary  
stimulation  with unloaded  donor  and recipient  PHA blasts,  as well as fully allogeneic  EBV BLCL.  
The matrix  of pentadecapeptide  subpools  approach  described  by our laboratory  (34) will be used  to 
identify  specific  epitopes  inducing  IFNγ responses  with the CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells.   The T-cells will 
also be tested  for their capacity  to lyse both CMVpp65  peptide  loaded  targets  and CMV -infected  
donor  and patient  PHA blasts.   In addition,  a panel  of single  HLA matched  EBV BLCL,  both loaded  
and unloaded  with CMVpp65,    will be used  as targets  for in-vitro cytotoxicity  to determine  the HLA 
restriction  of the CMV  specific  T-cells generated  (34, 36). 
T- cell cultures  providing  the required  dose  of CMVpp65 -CTLs  and lacking  more  than background  
responses  to unloaded  donor  and recipient  cells will be cryopreserved  for use in adoptive  
immunotherapy.   Immediately  prior to cryopreservation,  T-cells will be tested  by standard  techniques  
for microbiological  sterility,  absence  of mycoplasma,  and absence  or acceptably  low levels  of 
endotoxin  (confer  appended  standard  operating  procedures).  T-cells will be considered  acceptable  
for administration  if: 
1. They  are microbiologuically  sterile,  free of mycoplasma  and contain  ≤ 5 EU of endotoxin/kg  
recipient  weight/dose/hour  infusion  of T-cell culture  
2. The T-cells can specifically  lyse CMV -peptide  loaded  donor  and /or host APCs.  
3. The T-cells do not lyse unmodified  PHA blasts  of the transplant  recipient  or, if not evaluable,  
PHA blasts  from a fully allogeneic  blood  donor  above  levels  of cytotoxicity  detected  against  
autologous  PHA blasts.  
4. Whenever  possible,  aliquots  of these  T-cells will be saved  to determine  the T-cell receptor  
Vβ repertoire  of T-cells reactive  against  specific  epitopes.  
Unused  T-cells will be maintained  cryopreserved  under  GMP  conditions  in the Adoptive  Immune  Cell 
Therapy  facility  at MSKCC  after the patient’s  transplant,  after which  they will be used  (i) as 3rd party  
CMV  or EBV specific T-cells if consented  to by the donor,  for the treatment  of other  patients  such  as 
recipients  of cord blood  HSCT,  or marrow  or PBSC  HSCT  from seronegative  donors,  or donors  who 
are either  not available  or did not consent  to provide  leukocytes  for generation  of CMV -specific  CTLs  
(ii) for research  on viral immunity.  
 
6.1 CRITERIA  FOR SUBJECT  ELIGIBILITY  
 
Patients  eligible  for this trial will be consenting  recipients  of related  or unrelated  stem  cell allografts  
who have an active  CMV  infection  or persistent  CMV  viremia  despite  2 weeks  of antiviral  therapy  or 
who cannot  be maintained  on antiviral  agents  due to therapy  related  toxicity.   If the eligibility  criteria  
are met and a patient  is determined  to derive  benefit  from infusion  of CMVpp65 -CTLs,  a standard  
treatment  consent  will be obtained  and the patient  enrolled  and treated  on this clinical  trial. 
6.2 Subject  Inclusion  and Exclusion  Criteria  
 
6.2.1  Patient  Inclusion  Criteria  
 
1. Each  patient  must  satisfy  at least one of the following  criteria:

induction  therapy  with antiviral  drugs.  
Or 
b. The patient  has developed  CMV  viremia  as attested  by viral culture,  or detection  of levels  
of CMV  DNA in blood  or body fluids  while  receiving  prophylactic  doses  of antiviral  drugs  to 
prevent  CMV  infection  post transplant.  
Or 
c. The patient  is unable  to sustain  treatment  with antiviral  drugs  due to drug associated  
toxicities  (e.g. myelosuppression  [ANC<  1000 µl/ml without  GCSF  support]  or nephrotoxicity

7.1 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
7.2 Recruitment  Procedures  
 
7.2.1  Patient  Recruitment  
 
Patients  undergoing  allogeneic  HSCT  who are eligible,  will be recruited  to this trial under  the 
supervision  of the allogeneic  marrow  transplant  services  in Medicine  and Pediatrics.  
Prior to receiving  treatment,  some  patients  may undergo  diagnostic  and/or  other  testing  of their 
tissue,  if available,  to determine  if their CMV  infected  cells are likely to respond  to treatment  with 
CMV  specific  T cells.  Alternatively,   blood  samples  may be required  for research  tests  to ascertain  
that the CMV -specific  T-cells do not contain  any cells that could  react  against  the patient.  These  
patients  will sign a separate  pre-treatment  consent.  
Eligible  patients  will be interviewed  prior to enrollment  on this study,  to explain  the purpose  and the 
involved  treatments  and procedures.   The risks and benefits  of participating  in the trial and 
receiving  CMVpp65 -CTL infusions  will be presented  and discussed.  These  explanatory  
discussions  will include  a participating  investigator  and the patient.   A non-participating  family  
member  or research  nurse  should  be involved  whenever  possible.

7.1.2a  Donors  in Group  1 (Historical  Donors)  
 
Because  historical  donors  were  only under  the care of MSKCC  for the period  in which  they 
donated  cells for their primary  recipients  and have since  returned  home,  they will be mailed  a copy 
of the consent  form to review  during  the consent  discussion,  which  will occur  over the phone.  If 
they agree  to 3rd party  use of their cells,  the consent  will be signed  and sent back via MSKCC  
provided  pre-paid/addressed  envelope.  
 
The registration  process  is outline  in section  15.1.  
 
7.1.2b  Donors  in Groups  2 & 3 (Prospective  and Volunteer  Donors)  
 
A similar  but separate  discussion  that occurs  with patients  will also take place  with the prospective  
donors  of the T-cells,  defining  the risks of blood  and/or  white  cell donations  required  for the 
generation  of the T-cells to be used  for adoptive  immunotherapy,  and the clinical  indications  for 
which  the T-cells will be used.   Following  this discussion,  the donor  will be asked  to sign a written  
consent  to donate  the blood  cells to be used  to generate  CMVpp65 -CTLs  for adoptive  
immunotherapy.  
7.2 Inclusion  of Women  and Minorities  
 
Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  has filed form HHS 441 (re: Civil Rights),  form HHS 641 
(handicapped  individuals),  and form 639-A (re: Sex Discrimination).   In selecting  patients  for study  
in the projects  proposed  in this protocol,  we have taken  due notice  of NIH/ADAMHA   policies  
concerning  inclusion  of women  and minorities  in clinical  research  populations.   We expect  that the 
study  population  will be fully representative  of the range  of patients  seen  at Memorial  Hospital  
without  exclusion  as to age, gender,  or ethnic  background.   Based  on a January  1, 2001 - 
December  2005  analysis  of patient  populations  on allogeneic  transplant  protocols  at this Center,  
the racial  distributions  were  24% African  American,  Hispanic  or Asian,  and 76% Caucasian.  The 
gender  distribution  was 41% female  and 59% male.  The protocol  is open  to all patients   
irrespective  of gender  or ethnic  background.  The population  of patients  transplanted  reflects  the 
distribution  of the patients  in our tri-state  referral  area.  However,  it is anticipated  that the 
distribution  of patients  by race and ethnicity  will be the same  for patients  receiving  marrow  or 
PBSC  transplants,  but that a higher  proportion  of individuals  from minority  racial  groups  will be 
accrued  to the cord blood  transplant  protocols,  both because  of the greater  HLA disparity  
permissible  and the concerted  efforts  of these  banks  to obtain  donor  units from populations  
underrepresented  in the NMDP.   Given  the highly  specific  patient  population  that is subject/eligible  
for this treatment,  the trial will be registered  under  clinical  trials.gov  to enable  other  transplant  
centers  to review  and refer patients  for treatment.   No other  specific  outreach  efforts  are planned  
for accrual.  
 
Pregnant  women  are excluded  from this study.   There  are no age restrictions  for this study,  and 
eligible  children  will be enrolled  if appropriate  consents  are obtained  from parents  and /or 
guardians.

Prior to T cell infusion,  eligible  and consenting  patients  will be clinically  assessed  for their general  
condition  and for extent  of CMV  infection.  Tests/exams  will be obtained  within  3 days of infusion  
(whenever  possible).  Certain  tests  may be omitted  at the discretion  of the treating  physician:  
 
 
• Clinical  history  and Physical  examination  
• Chest  x-ray (not necessary  if CT scan  is done)  
• CT scan  is not required  prior to treatment,  but should  be done,  whenever  possible,  within  3 
days of T cell infusion  
• Ophthalmologic  exam  for CMV  retinitis,  if clinically  indicated  
• Colonoscopy  for CMV  colitis,  if clinically  indicated  
• ECHO  and/or  EKG,  if clinically  indicated  
• CBC  with differential  
• Comprehensive  Panel  
• Cultures  of affected  body fluids  or tissues  will be obtained  whenever  possible  
• CMV  viremia  will be assessed  by quantitation  of CMV  antigen+  blood  leukocytes  and by 
quantitation  of CMV  DNA in the blood  by realtime  quantitation  PCR.  
• Lymphocyte  immunophenotype  (BMT  short  panel)  and T cell responses  to PHA and Candida  
Albicans  
 
In addition,  T cell responses  to CMV  will be evaluated  in Dr. O’Reilly’s  laboratory  by: 
• Assessment  of T cell proliferation  in response  to CMV  antigens  and 
• Quantitation  of T cells generating  IFNγ in response  to stimulation  with a pool of CMV  
pentadecapeptides   and 
• In patients  expressing  HLA-A0201,  B0701  or B0801  T cells binding  CMV  peptide  – HLA A2, 
B7 or A24 tetramers  
• Analysis  of TCR Vβ repertoire  will also be performed  
 
 
9.1 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
 
This is a single  institution   phase  II trial designed  to assess  the therapeutic  activity  of primary  
donor  derived  CMVpp65  specific  T-cells (CMVpp65 -CTL)  for the treatment  of CMV  infection  or 
persistent  CMV  viremia  after allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation.   The T-cells will 
be generated  from healthy,  CMV  seropositive  donors  by sensitization   in vitro with autologous,  
cytokine -activated   monocytes  loaded   with a pool of overlapping   synthetic   peptides   spanning  
the sequence  of CMV  protein  pp65.  
9.1 Treatment with CMVpp65   Specific  T-cells  
 
Eligible  patients  who consent  to enter  this trial and for whom  CMV -pp65  CTLs  are available,  will 
receive  3 weekly  infusions  of CMV -pp65  CTLs.  The T cells will be administered  immediately  after 
thawing.  The final product  is cryopreserved  in a volume  of 1-2 ml. This will be drawn  up in a sterile  
syringe  containing  30 ml of normosol  for intravenous  administration  and administered  by slow 
intravenous  infusion  ideally  over approximately  5 minutes.  
 
In this phase  II trial, patients  will be treated  at doses of 1 x 106  CMVpp65 -CTL/kg/dose/week  for 3 
weeks  (+/- 20% variability  of total dose).  Patients  will be observed  for the following  3 weeks.  
Additional  3 week  courses of CMVpp65 -CTL may be administered  if levels  of CMV  DNA in blood  are 
still detectable  despite  disease  stabilization  or improvement.

If the planned  dose  of CMV  peptide  sensitized  T-cells is not achieved,  but the cells generated  exhibit  
required  levels  of CMV  specific  cytotoxic  activity  and meet  all other  release  criteria,  the T-cell 
product  may be administered  at a lower  dose  level.  
 
In certain  cases,  in order  to avoid  refreezing  of the final product  to achieve  a specific  dose  level,  
which  may affect  viability,  variability  of each  dose  may exceed   +/-20%.  In such  cases,  care will be 
given  to ensure  that the total combined  volume  of the 3 doses  does not exceed  the planned  dose.  
 
 
9.2 Subject  Stratification  
 
Subjects  will include  patients  treated  with CMVpp65 -CTLs  derived  from their transplant  donor.  
These  will be patients  with CMV  seropositive  transplant  donors  who have previously  provided  
leucocytes  for generation  of CMVpp65 -CTL and for whom  such  CMVpp65 -CTL are available.  
9.3 Selection  of CMVpp65 -CTL 
 
Patients  will be treated  with CMVpp65 -CTL generated  from their transplant  donor.  
 
10.0 EVALUATION  DURING  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
The timing  of evaluations  below  is approximate.  The schedule  of tests  described  should  be adhered  
to whenever  possible.  However,  in certain  situations,  particularly  late after treatment,  circumstances  
may preclude  assessments  at the times  specified,  at which  point they may be held the discretion  of 
the treating  physician:  
 
• Patients  will be evaluated  clinically  by vital signs  pre-infusion,  post,  and at approximately  1, 
2, 3, and 4 following  initiation  of each  infusion  of CMV -specific  T-cells 
 
• The patient  should  be followed  weekly  for the first 8 weeks  post-initial  infusion  with CMV - 
specific  T-cells,  then monthly  until 6 months  post initial  infusion.  Patients  will receive  interim  
history,  review  of systems,  and physical  exam  (including  GvHD  evaluations)  on the day of 
infusions,  and on days 1, 8 and 15 whenever  possible.  
 
• Patients  should  be monitored  by CBC  and comprehensive   metabolic  panels   weekly  for the 
first 8 weeks  post-initial  infusion  with CMV -specific  T-cells,  then approximately  monthly  until 
6 months  post initial  infusion.  
 
• Tests quantitating  CMV  viremia  by CMV  DNA copies  per milliliter  of blood  should  be obtained  
weekly  for the first 8 weeks  post-initial  infusion  with CMV -specific  T-cells,  then approximately  
monthly  until 6 months  post initial  infusion  
 
• Quantifications  of T cells generating  IFNγ in response  to pooled  CMV  pentadecapeptides  or 
T cells specific  for single  pentadecapeptides  known  to be contained  in the T cells infused  
should  be measured  weekly  for the first 8 weeks  post-initial  infusion  with CMV -specific  T- 
cells,  then monthly  until 6 months  post initial  infusion.  If the T cells infused  are known  to 
contain  T cells that can bind specific  CMV  peptide/HLA  tetramers,  these  T cells will also be 
quantitated.

• When  possible,  pre-initial  infusion  and at week  4 and month  6 post initial  infusion,  if >1% of 
the circulating  T cells are found  to be reactive  against  specific  epitopes  by either  assay,  
these  CMV -pp65 -reactive  T cells will, if possible,  be characterized  as to their T cell receptor  
Vβ repertoires,  to determine  whether and to what degree,  the T cells expanding  in vivo 
resemble  (and,  therefore,  are likely to be derived  from)  the CMV -specific  T cells infused  at 
the time of adoptive  transfer  
 
• If there  are clinical  indications,  research  samples  may be collected  testing  for cytokines.  
 
• Flow Cytometry  7 panel  to enable  quantification  of CD4 and CD8 T cell number  may be 
obtained  prior to the first infusion,  on day 14, week  4, and week  8 post-initial  infusion  with 
CMV -specific  T-cells,  then monthly  until 6 months  post initial  infusion  
 
• T cell populations  and their responses  to mitogens  and to candida  albicans  antigen  should  
be obtained  pre-initial  infusion  and may also be monitored  at approximately  2, 4, and 6 
months  post initial  infusion  as a measure  of general  immune  function.  
 
• Patients  with CMV  pneumonia  should  be monitored  by at least daily measurements  of blood  
gases  and/or  O2 saturations  until normalized  and weekly  chest  films together  with CT scans  
at pre-infusion  and approximately  every  2-4 weeks  until clear.  
 
• Ophthalmologic  evaluations  will be made  to document  responses  of CMV  retinitis.   These  
evaluations  will ideally  be done  every  2 weeks.  
 
• Patients  with known  CMV  enteritis  should  be monitored  by approximately  three  times  weekly  
measurements  of 24 hour stool volumes,  stool guaiacs  and cultures  for CMV.   If acceptable  
to the patient,  colonoscopy  should  be repeated  approximately  three  weeks  after the dose  of 
T cells to assess  response.  
 
• If the CMV  infection  affects  the CNS,  lung, or abdominal  organs,  and virus has been  
detected  (e.g.:  in pleural  or peritoneal  fluids),  appropriate  tissue  and/or  CSF may be collected  
(if indicated  and possible)  and tested  for the presence  of CMV  and CMV  specific T-cells.  
These  tests  should  occur  between  3-6 weeks  post initiation  of treatment,  whenever  possible.

3 Prior  to and at specific  intervals   following  infusion  of CMVpp65 -CTL,  patients  will be monitored  for levels  of 
CMVpp65 -CTL  in the blood  as measured  by quantitation  of CTL precursor  frequencies,   CMV  pp65 -specific  
IFNγ+  T-cells (35), or epitope  specific -T-cells  binding  HLA-peptide   tetramers  and their Vβ usage  (36).   The 
third party  T-cells will also be monitored  by analysis  of CMVpp65  IFNγ+  T-cells as to their genetic  origin.  
 
11.0   TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
In this study,  we will be capturing  and tracking  Grade  3-5 toxicities  which  occur  within  30 days following  
an infusion  of CMV  infusion  CTLs  and are potentially  attributable  to treatment  on study.  We will also 
be capturing  and tracking  graft vs host disease  occurring  at any time point post-infusion.  Patients  who 
might  subsequently  receive  donor  lymphocytes,  boosts,  or a secondary  transplant  will be evaluable  
up until that time point.  Toxicities  which  are attributable  to underlying  malignancy  and/or  were  present  
prior to initiation  of therapy  will not be tracked.  Please  see section  17.2 for Serious  Adverse  Event  
reporting.  
 
1. Acute  T oxicities  and Transfusion  Reactions.  The infusion  of CMV -peptide  specific  T-cells 
might  cause  an acute  transfusion  reaction  or an allergic  reaction  to the cell infusion  manifested  by any 
one or all of the following  clinical  signs  and symptoms:  fever,  shaking  chills,  difficulty  breathing,  a drop 
in the blood  pressure,  skin rash or swelling  of the mucus  membranes  in the mouth  or vaginal  tract,  or 
impairment  of kidney  function.  Based  on prior experience  with infusions  of T-cells at our own and other  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 12 -086 A(23)  
Approval date: 22 -Oct-2019  
Page  19 of 30  
  
 
 
institutions,  the risk of such  immediate  toxicities  is anticipated  to be small.  However,  each  patient  will 
be closely  monitored  for vital signs  and clinical  symptoms  prior to and following  T-cell infusion.  
Reactions  will be treated  as clinically  indicated.  
2. Specific  Immune   Reactions.   The CMV  peptide -specific  T-cells are expected  to migrate  to 
sites where  CMV  infected  cells are concentrated,  and to begin  to kill these  CMV  infected  cell 
populations.  These  cells may be concentrated  in the lung, liver, retina/central  nervous  system,  or 
intestinal  tract.  While  it is expected  that the small  doses  of T-cells administered  will take time to 
replicate,  and will exert  their antiviral  effects  over a time period  of days to weeks,  it is possible  that 
these  cells could  concentrate  in an infected  tissue  and cause  more  severe  inflammation  as they attack  
virus infected  cells.  This could  transiently  increase  the severity  of a pneumonia  or a CMV  –induced  
encephalitis,  retinitis,  hepatitis  or intestinal  infection,  and could  even be life-threatening.  Additionally,  
patients  with pre-existing  pulmonary  conditions  maybe  at increased  risk for development  of pulmonary  
toxicity  including  diffuse  alveolar  hemorrhage.  For patients  treated  for drug resistant  CMV -retinitis  , 
these  T cells could  potentially  cause  partial  or complete  blindness.  If this were  the case,  
immunosuppressive  drugs  might  be required  to halt such  a reaction,  and eliminate  the T-cells.  Were  
this required,  the antiviral  activity  of the T-cells would  be removed  and the infection  could  progress  in 
the absence  of any specific  resistance.  
3. Graft  versus  Host  Disease.  The CMV  peptide -specific  T-cells have been  cultured  for over 4 
weeks.  During  this time,  T-cells reactive  against  other  antigens,  including  alloantigens  that might  be 
expressed  by tissues  in the patient,  die off and are deleted.  The T-cells to be infused  will be tested  
and shownto have no significant  activity  against  normal allogenic  cells prior to their infusion.  However,  
there  is a finite risk that small  numbers  of alloreactive  T-cells could  be transferred  in the T-cell 
inoculum,  which  could  cause  Graft  versus  Host Disease  (GvHD).This  immune  reaction  against  the 
host can cause  skin rash,  hepatitis,  and enteritis.  In its most  severe  form,  it can be fatal. Were  
moderate  to severe  GvHD  (Grade  2-4) to develop,  the patient  will be treated  with high doses  of 
glucocorticosteroids.  Additional  immunosuppressive  agents  may be used  if the GvHD  does not 
respond  to steroid  treatment.  
4. Infection.  There  is a potential  that transfusions  of white  cells or T-lymphocytes  may also serve  
as vectors  of serious  infection.  All precautions  to maintain  sterility  will be taken.  
5. Autoimmune  Hemolytic Anemia. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia has been reported in 2 
out of 75 (2.6%)  patients  treated  with CMV  peptide -specific  T-cells in prior phase  1 and phase  2 
clinical  study  experience.  Both SAEs  were  grade  3 events.,  and one event  was considered  possibly  
related  to CMV  peptide -specific  T-cells while  the other  was considered  to be unrelated.   Patients  
who develop  autoimmune  hemolytic  anemia  should  be managed  per institutional  standard.  
Discussion  with the medical  monitor  is encouraged.  
 
 
11.1 Donor  Toxicity/Side  Effects  
 
Risks  of blood  donation  are minimal  and include:  minor  discomfort  at site of blood  draw,  some  
bleeding  and/or  bruising,  and lightheadedness.  
Risks  of Leukapheresis  include:  The agent  used  to prevent  clotting  of blood  during  a leukapheresis  
may cause  low levels  of calcium in the blood  and result  in the lack of feeling  or tingling  of fingertips  
or around  mouth,  which  normally  last only a short  time,  and can, potentially,  progress  to cramps.  
This is normally  treated  with a calcium  supplement.  
 
Other  leukapheresis  side effects  include:  
- Pain

- Bruising  at the needle  insertion  sites 
- Dizziness  
- Nausea  
- Fainting  due to temporary  lowering  of the blood  pressure  (rare)  
- Infection  (rare)  
 
Platelet  count  may drop during  the leukapheresis  and will be measured  after the collection.  If platelet  
count  falls enough  to place  the donor  in danger  of bleeding,  count  will be checked  daily until it 
returns  to normal.  
 
The leukapheresis  requires  that a needle  be placed  in a vein in each  arm. About  15% of the time,  we 
are unable  to use the donor’s  arm veins.  The donor  may be asked  to go through  a minor  surgical  
procedure  to place  a central  line. The donor  will be asked  to sign another  consent  form if a central 
line needs  to be put in. 
 
12.0   CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
The primary  endpoint  of this study  is to assess  whether  the infusion  of the CMVpp65 -CTLs  has 
therapeutic  activity  in curing  CMV  infections  in recipients  of HSCT.  This study  specifically  will evaluate  
the therapeutic  efficacy  and persistence  after infusion  of CMVpp65 -CTLs  derived  from the HSCT  
transplant  donor  for the treatment  of CMV  infections.  The second  clinical  end point of this study  is the 
evaluation  of GvHD  induction  after infusion  of donor  derived  CMVpp65 -CTLs.   . 
 
The responses  of CMV  infections  will be clinically  monitored  as detailed  under  section  10. Responses  
to adoptively  transferred  T-cells are usually  not observed  until the T-cells have had time to expand  
within  the transplant  recipient,  a period  of at least 3 days,  and as many  as 18-21 days after the T-cell 
infusion.  Accordingly,  initial  patient  responses  will be scored  at weekly  intervals,  from day 7-day 21 
post the initial  infusion.  Final responses  will be captured  in CRDB  and scored  between  days 28-42 
post the final infusion.  Outcome  responses  will be captured  post-first cycle  and post final-cycle  of 
infusions  of CMV  specific  T cells.  Best response  observed  in the full course  of treatment  will also be 
recorded  as a distinct  entity.  
 
Clinical  responses  will be considered  complete  if all manifestations  of CMV  disease  have resolved  
and/or  the patient  no longer  has detectable  CMV  DNA by PCR.  
 
A partial  response  will be defined  as a 2xLog 10 reduction  in the level of CMV  DNA detected  in the 
patients  blood  and/or  improvement  in clinical  parameters  of CMV  infection  such  that the patient  is 
symptom -free. 
 
Stable  disease  will be defined  as no change  in the clinic  severity  of disease  in any organ.  
 
Progressive  disease  will be defined  as disease  progression  by clinical  and radiologic  parameters,  
ascribable  to CMV  infection  in any affected  organ,  with unchanged  or increased  levels  of CMV  DNA.  
 
Graft  versus  Host Disease  initially  developing  after 10 days post T-cell infusion  will be considered  to 
be potentially  ascribable  to the T-cell infusion.  Graft  versus  Host Disease  will be diagnosed  and 
clinically  graded  using  the standard  criteria  of the IBMTR/NMDP  Consensus  Panel.  Whenever,  
possible,  the diagnosis  will be confirmed  by biopsy  of skin or other  involved  organ,  using  the 
pathological  criteria  of Woodruff  et al.  Patients  with preexisting  GvHD  of grade  1 severity  not requiring  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

systemic  steroids,  or patients  with a prior history  of GvHD  who have resolved  this process  sufficiently  
so that they no longer  require  parenteral  steroid  treatment  will be considered  to have developed  an 
exacerbation  or worsening  of GvHD  ascribable  to the T-cell infusion  if they redevelop  clinical  evidence  
of grade  2 or greater  GvHD  7 or more days after a dose  of T-cells.  
 
 
For the evaluation  of toxicities,  the NCI Standard  Toxicity  Scale   4.0 will be employed.  
 
13.0     CRITERIAFOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
In accordance  with the Declaration   of Helsinki,   ICH Good  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines,   and the 
US FDA Regulations,   a patient  has the right to withdraw  from the study  at any time for any 
reason  without  prejudice   to his/her  future  medical  care by the physician  or at the institution.   The 
Investigator   also has the right to withdraw  patients   from the study  (see below).  Should  a patient  
(or a patient’s   legally   authorized   representative)   decide  to withdraw,  all efforts  will be made  to 
complete  and report  the observations   as thoroughly   as possible.  
 
A complete  final evaluation  should  be made  at the time of the patient’s  withdrawal,  the Study  Status  
Outcome  form in the case report  form should  be completed  with an explanation  of why the patient  is 
withdrawing,  and an attempt  should  be made  to perform  a follow -up evaluation.  
 
Patients  may be removed  from study  if one or more  of the following  events  occur:  
• Significant  noncompliance  on the part of the patient  
• Refusal  of the patient  to continue  treatment  or observations  
• Unacceptable  toxicity  (i.e.: grade  3-4 toxicity  related  to CMV  CTL infusion).  Removal  for unacceptable  
toxicity  does not necessarily  preclude  continued  follow -up. 
• Progressive  disease  that in the Investigator’s   opinion   requires   therapeutic   intervention   that would  
interfere  with the interpretation  of results  from the study  
• Decision  by the Investigator  that termination  is in the patient’s  best medical  interest  
• Unrelated  medical  illness  or complication  
• Lost to follow -up. 
 
14.0     BIOSTATISTICS 
 
A phase  2 trial design  will be applied  to determine  the efficacy  and safety  of CMV  specific T cells for 
the treatment  of marrow  transplant  patients  with CMV.  The endpoint  of this study  is complete  
response,  defined  as the clearance  of the CMV  infection  3-7 weeks  following  completion  of the last 
cycle  of CMV  CTLs.  The evaluation  of treatment  efficacy  will be assessed  for patients  receiving  CMV  
specific  T cells from their transplant  donor.  It is anticipated  that accrual will be completed  within  3 
years.  
A two-stage  design  with a maximum  of 39 patients  will be employed.  The study  design  discriminates  
between  population  response  rates  of 0.50 and 0.70.  In the first stage,  23 patients  will be enrolled  in 
the study.  If 11 or fewer  complete  responses (CRs)  are observed,  then the trial will be stopped.  If at 
least 12 complete  responses  are observed,  then 16 additional  patients  will be accrued.  At the 
conclusion  of the trial, if 23 or fewer  CRs are observed,  we will conclude  that the treatment  is not 
sufficiently  active.  This design  has power  0.90 for a population  CR rate equal  to 0.70 using  a one- 
sided  test with type 1 error equal  to 0.10.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 12 -086 A(23)  
Approval date: 22 -Oct-2019  
Page  22 of 30  
  
 
The probability  of a complete  response  and the proportion  of patients  requiring  ganciclovir  or foscarnet  
will be computed.  
Following  approval  of Amendment  22, additional  accrual  on study  is anticipated  to be 2-3 patients  per 
year,  for an additional  3 years,  for a target  accrual  of approximately  7 additional  patients.  As the 
accrual  will be lower  than the originally  targeted  accrual  number,  there  will be no hypothesis  test for 
efficacy  analysis  and the efficacy  analysis  is to estimate  the complete  response  (CR)  rate with its 80% 
confidence  interval.  For example,  with 9 CR observed  among  a total of 15 subjects,  the estimate  of 
CR rate is 60% with the 80% Clopper -Pearson  exact  confidence  interval  of  (40.4%,  77.4%).  
The effects  of infusing  activated  CMV -specific  T-cells on the general  immune  function  of the host will 
be assessed  by recording  CD4+ and CD8+, CD3+ T-cells,  NK cells and B-cells prior to and one week  
following  each  course  of cell infusions  and 1, 2 and 4 months  following  completion  of the second  
course  of cells.  In addition,  the levels  of CMV   DNA and T cells generating  IFNg  in response  to 
the CMV  pentadecapeptides  will be measured  weekly  for the first 8 weeks  and then monthly  until 6 
months  post infusion.  Nonparametric  smoothing  will be used  to estimate  the population  trajectory  of 
these  response  curves  over time.   In addition,  a generalized  estimating  equation  approach  will be used  
to model  the relationship  between  the immunologic  reconstitution  factors  and complete  response.  
In order  to reduce  patient  risk, the study  design  includes  early termination  in the event  of excessive  
graft versus  host disease  during  the accrual  period.  The stopping  rule for excessive  GvHD  and the 
corresponding  power  calculation  will be applied  separately  for the two donor  groups.  In the event  that 
the stopping  boundary  is crossed  for one of these  groups,  the study  will continue  accrual  in the other  
group.

16.1 DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUES 
 
This is a single  institution  trial and all patients  will be treated  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  
Center.  
 
A Clinical  Research  Coordinator  (CRC)  will be assigned  to this study.  The responsibilities  of the 
CRC  include  project  compliance,  data collection,  abstraction  and entry,  data reporting,  regulatory  
monitoring,  problem  resolution  and prioritization,  and coordinate  the activities  of the protocol  study  
team.  The data manager  will also monitor  laboratory  compliance  through  out the study.  Laboratory  
data will be tabulated  and summarized  based  on MSKCC  normal  ranges.  
 
The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into the MSKCC  Clinical  Research  Data Base  
(CRDB).  
 
16.2 Quality Assurance 
 
Registration  reports  will be generated  by the CRC  on a regular  basis  to monitor  patient  accruals  and 
completeness  of the registration  data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  
missing  data and inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow - 
up will be monitored  periodically  throughout  the study  period  and potential  problems  will be brought  
to the attention  of the study  team  for discussion  and action.  
 
Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by the study  team,  at 
a minimum  of two times  per year,  more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plan utilized  for this study  must  align with the MSK DSM Plan,  
where  applicable.  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  were  approved  by the 
National  Cancer  Institute  in August  2018.  The plans  address  the new policies  set forth by the NCI in 
the document  entitled  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  for Data and Safety  Monitoring  of 
Clinical  Trials.”  
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by which  clinical  studies  are monitored  for data,  safety  and 
quality.  At a departmental/PI  level there  exists  procedures  for quality  control  by the research  
team(s).  Institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  include  protocol  monitoring,

compliance  and data verification  audits,  staff education  on clinical  research  QA and two institutional  
committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials programs.  The 
committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the 
Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  trials,  report  to the Deputy  
Physician -in-Chief,  Clinical  Research.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its level of 
risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  
 
The MSK DSMB  monitors  phase  III trials and the DSMC  monitors  non-phase  III trials.   The DSMB/C  
have oversight  over the following  trials:  
 
• MSK Investigator  Initiated  Trials  (IITs;  MSK as sponsor)  
• External  studies  where  MSK is the data coordinating  center  
• Low risk studies  identified  as requiring  DSMB/C  review  
 
The DSMC  will initiate  review  following  the enrollment  of the first participant/or  by the end of the year 
one if no accruals  and will continue  for the study  lifecycle  until there  are no participants  under  active  
therapy  and the protocol  has closed  to accrual.  The DSMB  will initiate  review  once  the protocol  is 
open  to accrual.  
 
 
 
17.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSKCC’s  Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.   The use and disclosure  of 
protected  health  information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  
Authorization  form.   A Research  Authorization  form must  be completed  by the Principal  
Investigator  and approved  by the IRB and Privacy  Board.  
 
The consent  indicates  that individualized  de identified  information  collected  for the purposes  of 
this study  may be shared  with other  qualified  researchers.  Only researchers  who have received  
approval  from MSK will be allowed  to access  this information  which  will not include  protected  
health  information,  such  as the participant’s  name,  except  for dates.  It is also stated  in the 
Research  Authorization  that their research  data may be shared  with others  at the time of study  
publication.  
 
 
17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
 
All SAEs  must  be submitted  in PIMS.  If an SAE requires  submission  to the HRPP  office  per 
IRB SOP  RR-408 ‘Reporting  of Serious  Adverse  Events’,  the SAE report  must  be submitted  
within  5 calendar  days of the event.   All other  SAEs  must  be submitted  within  30 calendar  
days of the event.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 12 -086 A(23)  
Approval date: 22 -Oct-2019

The report  should  contain  the following  information:  
 
• The date the adverse  event  occurred  
• The adverse  event  
• The grade  of the event  
• Relationship  of the adverse  event  to the treatment(s)  
• If the AE was expected  
• Detailed  text that includes  the following  
o An explanation  of how the AE was handled  
o A description  of the participant ’s condition  
o Indication  if the participant  remains  on the study  
• If an amendment  will need  to be made  to the protocol  and/or  consent  form 
• If the SAE is an Unanticipated  Problem  
 
 
17.2.1  
 
17.2.2  Definition  of SAE 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  
hospitalization  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospitalization  may be considered  serious  when,  based  upon  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or participant  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
 
Note: Hospital  admission  for a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  starts  investigational  
treatment/intervention.   SAE reporting  is required  for 30-days after the participant’s  last 
investigational  treatment/intervention.  Any event  that occur  after the 30-day period  that is 
unexpected  and at least possibly  related  to protocol  treatment  must  be reported.  
 
Please  note:  Any SAE that occurs  prior to the start of investigational  treatment/intervention  
and is related  to a screening  test or procedure  (i.e., a screening  biopsy)  must  be reported.  
 
The SAE report  should  be completed  as per above  instructions.   If appropriate,  the report  will 
be forwarded  to the FDA by the IND Office

18.1 INFORMED  CONSENT  PROCEDURES  
 
Before  protocol -specified  procedures  are carried  out, consenting  professionals  will explain   
full details  of the protocol  and study  procedures  as well as the risks involved  to participants  
prior to their inclusion  in the study.  Participants  will also be informed  that they are free to 
withdraw  from the study  at any time.  All participants  must  sign an IRB/PB -approved  consent  
form indicating  their consent  to participate.  This consent  form meets  the requirements  of the 
Code  of Federal  Regulations  and the Institutional  Review  Board/Privacy  Board  of this Center.  
The consent  form will include  the following:  
1. The nature  and objectives,  potential  risks and benefits  of the intended  study.  
2. The length  of study  and the likely follow -up required.  
3. Alternatives  to the proposed  study.  (This  will include  available  standard  and 
investigational  therapies.  In addition,  patients  will be offered  an option  of supportive  
care for therapeutic  studies.)  
4. The name  of the investigator(s)  responsible  for the protocol.  
5. The right of the participant  to accept  or refuse  study  interventions/interactions  and to 
withdraw  from participation  at any time.  
Before  any protocol -specific  procedures  can be carried  out, the consenting  professional  will 
fully explain  the aspects  of patient  privacy  concerning  research  specific  information.   In 
addition  to signing  the IRB Informed  Consent,  all patients  must  agree  to the Research  
Authorization  component  of the informed  consent  form.  
Each  participant  and consenting  professional  will sign the consent  form.  The participant  must  
receive  a copy of the signed  informed  consent  form.  
 
Participants  enrolled  to the “historical  donor”  arm are, frequently,  no longer  under  the care of 
MSKCC.  This is because  the primary  patients,  for whom  their donations  were  initially  
intended,  have completed  treatment  and are no longer  at risk for CMV.  Donors  who fall into 
this category  will be mailed  a copy of the consent  form to review  during  the consent

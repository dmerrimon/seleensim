1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
This is a pilot study  evaluating  the ability  of 11C-choline  (11C-CH) PET imaging  to evaluate  
11C-CH distribution  in the head  and to distinguish  pseudo -progression  from true tumor  
progression  in high-grade  gliomas  treated  with radiation.    Distinguishing  true tumor  progression  
from pseudo -progression  in gliomas  remains  a challenge  with conventional  gadolinium -enhanced  
MRI and FDG  PET.   Radiographic  and FDG  PET changes  in pseudo -progression  are often  
indistinguishable  from those  related  to true tumor  progression.  Thus,   current  advanced  imaging  
techniques  are not sufficient  in distinguishing  these  two processes.  With a more  accurate  and an 
earlier  understanding  of the pathology  of evolving  radiographic  changes  following  treatment  of 
high-grade  gliomas,  more  effective  treatment  decisions  could  be made  earlier  on in the course  of 
treatment  and may lead to improved  patient  outcomes.  
 
Here we propose  to study  the biodistribution  of 11C-CH using  PET imaging  and to obtain  
pilot data as to whether  11C-CHcan  differentiate  lesions  primarily  composed  of recurrent  tumor  
versus  inflammation  associated  with treatment.   11C-CH PET is a nuclear  imaging  modality  that 
has been  used  for the detection  of proliferating  cells as opposed  to inflammation.7    This is 
particularly  relevant  to brain  tumors,  where  11C-CH has a very low background  uptake,  
contributing  to high sensitivity  for identifying  neoplasia.  
 
In this small  plot study  of 6 patients,  we seek to determine  the uptake  and biodistribution  
of 11C-CH with the purpose  of correlating  SUV measures  with evolving  MRI findings  consistent  
with a diagnosis  of tumor progression  versus  pseudoprogression.  
Our central  hypothesis  is that 11C-CH PET imaging  will delineate  those  lesions  with 
a large  fraction  of tumor  cells,  consistent  with true progression,  from  those  with 
inflammatory  cells  as seen  in pseudo -progression.   This pilot study  will not be considered  
definitive,  but rather  will be used  to gather  preliminary  data in support  of a larger,  
definitive  study.  
 
The 11C-CH will be used  in this trial, strictly  in concordance  with the requirements  of the 
Radioactive  Drug  Research  Committee  (RDRC).  The RDRC  permits  the study  of up to 30 human  
subjects  with a research  radiotracer  prior to an IND application  provided:  (1) the radiotracer  is not 
a first in man study,  (2) the agent  is administered  at doses  below  that which  will produce  a 
pharmacologic  effect  and (3) the projected  radiation  dose  falls within  defined  limits;  namely  <3cGy  
for eyes,  bone  marrow  and testes  per injection  and <5 cGy per annum;  for all other  organs  <5cGy  
per injection  or <15 cGy per annum.   This trial will investigate  the distribution  of a research  agent.  
The trial is intended  to discover  where  the agent  distributes  within  the head  (RDRC  justification),  
as well as address  objectives  1 and 2. The individual  patient  results  from this study  will not be 
used  for disease  diagnosis  or to assess  treatment  response  or to change  treatment  decisions.

2.0 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
2.1 Primary  Objective:  
 
(a) To determine  the distribution  of 11C-CH in high-grade  glioma  lesions  with MRI findings  
concerning  for pseudoprogression  vs true tumor   progression  following  radiotherapy  
(with or without  concurrent  therapy).  
(b) To investigate  the correlation  between  11C-CH SUV measures  and MRI follow -up 
outcomes  in patients  with high-grade  glioma  lesions  with changes  concerning  for 
pseudoprogression  vs true tumor  progression  following  treatment  with radiation  (with 
or without  concurrent  therapy).  
 
Hypothesis : 11C-CH PET imaging  has high uptake  in “true tumor  progression”  (recurrent  tumor)  
relative  to evolving  treatment  related  inflammatory  changes  following  radiation  and/or  
chemotherapy   (“pseudo -progression”) . 
 
 
3.0     BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
W hat is post-treatment  gliom  a “ps eudo -progres  s ion”? Glioma  pseudo -progression  occurs  in 28- 
66% of all glioblastoma  (GBM)  patients  undergoing  chemoradiation  and typically  presents  as an 
increased  area of contrast  enhancement  and surrounding  T2/FLAIR  hyperintense  signal. [1] These  
findings  are often  indistinguishable  from those  related  to true progression  of tumor  on standard  
MRI. The radiographic  changes  of pseudo -progression  range  from mild to dramatic,  may or may 
not result  in neurologic  symptoms,  and typically  occur  within  3-6 months  of standard  combined  
radiation  and temozolomide  therapy.[ 1, 2] Patients  with tumors  harboring  promoter  methylation  of 
the repair  enzyme  O-6-methyl  guanine  DNA  methyltransferase  (MGMT)  appear  to be at greater  
risk for pseudo -progression,  with up to 91% (21 of 23 patients)  of such  patients  developing  early  
radiographic  changes  in one study.[ 3] The pathophysiology  of glioma  pseudo -progression  is not 
fully  understood.   It  is  most   likely  induced   by  a  pronounced   local  tissue   reaction   with  an 40-60% develop

inflammatory  component,  edema,  and abnormal  vessel  permeability  causing  new or increased  
contrast  enhancement  on MR imaging  examinations.  Most important,  there  may be an association  
between  the incidence  of pseudo -progression  and increased  survival,  suggesting  pseudo - 
progression  represents  an active  “inflammatory”  response  against  the tumor. [3] 
 W hy is it c linic ally im portant  to diff erentiat  e bet ween  “true progres  s ion” and “ps eudo -pro gres s ion”. 
Differentiating  between  true progression  and pseudo -progression  provides  critical  information  to 
guide  patient  management  decisions.  In patients  with pseudo -progression,  the imaging  findings  
represent  treatment -related  inflammatory  changes  secondary  to a robust  response  to therapy  and 
continued  treatment  is appropriate  and beneficial.  For patients  in whom  pseudo -progression  is 
suspected,  continued  therapy  with close  monitoring  is recommended  as the  contrast  
enhancement  will typically  remain  stable  or improve.[ 4] For patients  who are symptomatic  from a 
growing  lesion  in an eloquent  portion  of the brain,  observation  is not feasible,  and the prompt  
diagnosis  of tumor  progression  versus  pseudo -progression  is imperative  to ameliorate   and 
prevent  further  disability.  Tumor  recurrence  needs  to be managed  more  aggressively  to prevent  
growth,  and early identification  of recurrence  could  impact  a patient’s  overall   prognosis   and 
survival.  An accurate  assessment  of treatment  response  is also fundamental  in clinical  trials and 
is becoming  increasingly  relevant  with the growing  interest  in immunotherapies  for high-grade  
gliomas.  
Diagnosis  of pseudo -progression . Distinguishing  pseudo -progression  from tumor  progression  
radiographically  remains  a challenge.  Conventional  gadolinium  enhanced  MRI is currently  the 
standard  method  of evaluating  response  to chemoradiation,  and the Macdonald  Criteria  are the 
most  widely  used  response  assessment  guidelines  for high-grade  gliomas .[5] These  are based  on 
2D tumor  measurements  on MRI, in conjunction  with clinical  assessment,  and corticosteroid  dose.  
The Macdonald  Criteria  define  tumor  progression  as any increase  of >25%  in the size of the 
contrast -enhancing  lesion,  but are limited  as only the enhancing  portion  of the tumor  is measured.  
The revised  RANO  criteria  attempt  to address  this and account  for the nonenhancing  component  
of the tumor  in assessing  response. [6] They  are also more  stringent  in defining  true progression  
within  12 weeks  after radiation  only with pathologic  confirmation  or with the presence  of a new 
lesion  outside  the radiation  field. Comparing  these  two criteria,  it is clear  that tumor  progression  is 
“over -diagnosed”  using  the Macdonald  criteria,  resulting  in a subsequent  diagnosis  of pseudo - 
progression  of 24% for Macdonald  and 13% for RANO  criteria. [7] Even  with the modified  criteria,  
current  imaging  techniques  are not sufficient  in reliably  distinguishing  tumor  progression  from 
treatment  related  changes.  Although  limited  retrospective  data suggest  perfusion  MR may be 
useful,  its sensitivity  is comparable  to FDG-PET,  which  is low or disputed  in some  studies. [4, 8- 
12] Furthermore,  most  studies  utilize  the first MRI following  chemoradiation  to determine  
radiographic  progression,  limiting  our understanding  of the timeline  of treatment -related  
inflammatory  changes.  Indeed,  some  investigators  have considered  pseudo -progression  up to 6 
months  post-radiation,  with one study  demonstrating  33% of pseudoprogression  cases  occurring  
3-6 months  following  treatment  initiation  [13], highlighting  the poorly  defined  measures  used  in the 
diagnosis  of this entity.[ 13-15] 
Choline  Metabolism : Choline  is a quaternary  (hydrophilic)  amine  and is an “essential”  nutrient  that 
must  be obtained  from the diet. Choline  is predominantly  utilized  for the synthesis  of essential  
lipid components  of cell membranes  (e.g.,  phosphatidylcholine  (PtdylC)  and sphingomyelin),  the 
production  of potent  lipid mediators  (such  as platelet -activating  factor  and 
lysophosphatidylcholine),  and for the synthesis  of the cholinergic  neurotransmitter  acetylcholine  
(ACh).  PtdylC  is the most  important  metabolite  of choline  and accounts  for approximately  one-half 
of total membrane  lipid content  and is the largest  fraction  of choline  metabolites. [16] 
Choline  is initially  transported  into the cell and then phosphorylated  by choline  kinase,  forming  
phosphocholine  (PCho).  Choline  transporters  and choline  kinase  are frequently  overexpressed  in 
malignancy.[ 17-23] PCho  is  readily  detected  by  31P  magnetic   resonance  spectroscopy  (MRS),

and elevated  levels  of “choline”  (C-NH 3)3 moieties  are detected  by 1H MRS.  These  measures  
have been  used  as surrogate  markers  for tumors,  but elevated  levels  are also found  in many  
rapidly  dividing  cells.  MRS  imaging  of elevated  choline  has been  shown  in numerous  studies  of 
breast,  brain,  and prostate  tumors  and is a marker  of malignancy. [24-29] 
Fluorocholine  imaging : 18F-FCH has demonstrated  utility  for imaging  a variety  of neoplasms,  
including  those  of the  breast,  prostate,  liver and brain.   Imaging  metastatic   and primary  brain  
tumors  with 18F-FCH has also been  demonstrated  (Figs.  1-3, Table  1). The results  summarized  in 
Table   1  demonstrate   that  18F-FCH uptake   in 
primary  brain  tumors  is very high, and most  
important , that uptake  is very low in “benign”  
brain  inflammatory  lesions  (e.g. demylinating  
disease  and radiation  necrosis),  as well as in 
normal  brain  tissue .[30] Table  1. 18F-FCholine   PET data [30]

contrast  enhanced  MRI.  Also note the low background  acti vity in 
non-tumor   normal  brain  regions   [20]. 
 
 
Comparison  to 11C-Choline:  The imaging  characteristics  (e.g.,  tumor/brain)  of 18F-FCH and 11C- 
Choline  are similar  (Fig. 2). Although  there  are advantages  to 18F-FCH,  including  the longer  
physical  half-time of 18F (t1/2=110  min) compared  to 11C (t1/2=20 min) and the slightly  greater  in 
vivo stability  of 18F-FCH[ 31, 32], radiation  exposure  (dosimetry)  is significantly  less with 11C- 
Choline  (approximately  1/5 that of 18F-FCH),  allowing  repetitive  11C-Choline  studies.  In addition,  
11C-CH is produced  frequently  (several  times  each  week)  for prostate  cancer  imaging  studies  at 
MSKCC.  Furthermore,  an IND for 11C-CH PET imaging  has been  approved  for these  studies.

C-Choline  PET scans  were   similar  at  5  and  20 
minutes  post-injection  in a glioblastoma.  However,  the Tumor/Brain  ratio 
(T/B)  of 18 11 
F-FCholine  increased  with  time,  whereas  the  ratio  of C- 
18 
Choline  was constant.   As a consequence,  the T/B ratio of F-FCholine  
at 20 minutes  post-injection  was higher,  ranging  from 13.2 to 21.1 (16.2  
+/- 2.6, seven  cases)  in glioblastoma   [31]. 
 
Comparison  to 18F-FDG . FDG  is avidly  accumulated  by many  tumor  cells and is widely  used  to 
stage  many  malignancies.  FDG  has also been  used  in the past in an attempt  to differentiate  tumor  
recurrence  from radiation  necrosis.  However,  FDG  accumulates  avidly  in inflammatory  lesions,  
where  white  blood  cells and macrophages  have high rates  of glycolysis.  Non-neoplastic  
applications  of FDG-PET were  recently  reviewed  in 16 articles  published  in the Annals  of the New 
York Academy  of Sciences. [33] In fact, there  are many  reports  where  FDG-avid brain  lesions  
have subsequently  been  shown  to be non-malignant  inflammatory  lesions,  including  radiation  
necrosis  with an inflammatory  infiltrate.  [17-23] Reports  on the sensitivity  and specificity  of FDG - 
PET to distinguish  recurrent  tumor  from radiation  necrosis,  involving  363 patients  in 12 studies  
varied  widely  (9 reviewed  in reference  [34], [11, 35]). Since  1988,  sensitivity  and specificity  values  
ranged  from 65-86% and 22-94%,  respectively,  although  a recent  small  (n=25)  dual phase  study  
reported  values  of 90-95% and 95-100%  respectively.[ 11, 34-36] Thus,  FDG-PET is inconsistent  
in identifying  radiation  necrosis  and is less frequently  used  in current  clinical  management.  
Furthermore,  the background  level of FDG  in normal  brain  tissue  is high, which  further  minimizes  
sensitivity  and complicates  its ability  to distinguish  active,  progressive  brain  tumors  from other  
inflammatory  brain  diseases.  
 
Comparison  to 18F-FLT. Comparing  18F-FCH to 18F-fluorothymidine  (FLT)  (and amino  acid uptake)  
may be more  appropriate,  because  both tracers  have relatively  low brain  background.  However,  
there  are no published  head -to-head  18F-FCH and 18F-FLT (or radiolabeled  amino  acid)  
comparisons  for primary  or metastatic  brain  tumors.  A comparison  can be made  between  two 
different  studies  involving  patients  with high-grade  gliomas.  The FLT SUV max and LNR (lesion -to- 
normal  brain  ratio)  values  (1.33  ± 0.75 and 3.54 ± 1.03,  respectively)  were  slightly   lower  
compared  to those  for 18F-FCH.[ 30,37] These  differences  are small  and were  not statistically  
significant.  No comparable  SUV max or LNR values  for FLT uptake  in brain  metastases  or radiation  
necrosis  have been  reported.  FLT has been  reported  to have  low uptake  in inflammatory  lesions,  
and FLT is consistently  better  than FDG  in distinguishing  tumor  from inflammation. [38-40] 
However,  FLT uptake  in BCG -induced  granulomas  was comparable  to that in KDH -8 hepatomas  
(2.2±0.5  vs. 2.6±0.8  lesion/blood).  FLT uptake  in turpentine -induced  inflammation  was slightly 
lower  (1.4±0.2  lesion/blood)  than that in granulomas,  but significantly  above  baseline.[ 40] One 
recent  abstract  reports  a comparison  of FLT- and FDG-PET in differentiating  recurrent  tumor  from 
radiation  necrosis  in 15 patients  with primary  brain  tumors. [41] Sensitivity/specificity  FLT Kimax 
was 91/75%  (p=0.0071),  whereas  sensitivity/specificity  for FDG  SUV max was 82/100%  (p=0.0016);  
visual  distinction  between  recurrent  tumor  and radiation  necrosis  was statistically  significant  for

FDG  (p=.007),  but not for FLT (p=.066).  These  differences  reflect  some  inconsistency  in the 
published  literature.  
 
Comparison  to radiolabeled  amino  acids . Similar  to FLT, many  radiolabeled  amino  acids  (11C- 
methionine  and 18F-fluoroethyltyrosine  [FET])  have relatively  high tumor  and low brain  uptake.  
However,  normal  brain  uptake  of the amino  acids  is higher  than that of 18F-FCH,  whereas  tumor  
uptake  of 11C-Choline  and 18F-FCH is greater  than that of 11C-methionine  and other   amino  
acids. [3] Several  relevant  studies  have  been  reported. [42-47] One recent  study  of 29 patients  (33 
lesions)  using  11C-methionine  to distinguish  brain  tumor  recurrence  from radiation  necrosis, [43] 
reports  a SUV max sensitivity,  specificity,  and accuracy  of 68.2%  (15/22),  72.7%  (8/11)  and 69.7%  
(23/33),  respectively.[ 43] These  values  reflect  those  reported  in other  amino  acid imaging  
studies. [42, 44-47] 
 
Comparison  to MRI perfusion . MRI perfusion  provides  physiologic  information  about  brain  tissue  
biology,  allowing  the in vivo measurement  of increased  tumor  microvascularity  and permeability.  
There  is growing  evidence  that MRI perfusion  can improve  the diagnosis  of bra in tumors  over 
conventional  imaging  alone.  DCE  MRI perfusion  is a T1 technique  with excellent  spatial  resolution  
and is relatively  insensitive  to susceptibility  artifacts  due to hemorrhage  and bone/air  interfaces.  
DCE  MRI perfusion  provides  measurements  of plasma  volume  and Ktrans.  Although  small  
retrospective  and prospective  studies  have suggested  a role for MRI perfusion  in distinguishing  
tumor  progression  from treatment  related  changes,  there  still remains  considerable  overlap  
between  these  two disease  entities. [4, 8-10, 48, 49] There  is an open  protocol  at MSKCC  (IRB 
12-067) comparing  MRI perfusion  and FDG -PET/CT  to distinguish  between  radiation  injury  and 
tumor  progression.  
 
Comparison  to spectroscopy  (MRS) . MRS  in combination  with standard  MRI sequences  is clearly  
better  than MRI alone  in distinguishing  treatment  related  changes  from recurrent  tumor.  Using  1H 
MRS,  resonances  from choline  (C-NH 3)3 moieties  (Cho),  creatine+phosphocreatine  (Cr), N-acetyl - 
aspartate  (NAA),  lactate  (Lac),  and free fatty acids  can be resolved  well enough  to assist  in the 
diagnosis  under  routine  conditions,  and PCho  is readily  detected  by 31P MRS.  These  measures  
and combination  of measures  (e.g.,  Cho/Cr  ratio)  have been  used  as surrogate  markers  of brain,  
breast,  prostate  and other  tumors  in numerous  studies, [24-29] and are considered  to be a marker  
of malignancy.  In contrast,  other  combinations  (e.g.,  Lac/Ch)  have been  used  as a marker  of 
necrosis.  Small  studies  have been  reported  in primary  brain  tumors. [49-54] However,  no large  
comprehensive  efficacy  studies  have been  performed.  
Preliminary  Data. This proposal  is based  on observations  that gliomas  have a much  higher  uptake  
of 18F-FCH and 11C-CH than non-proliferative  brain  lesions  and surrounding  normal  brain  tissue,  
thus providing  a clear  distinction  between  the two processes  (Table  1).[30] MSK has recently  
been  funded  to study  whether  18F-FCH PET imaging  can distinguish  between  post-stereotactic  
radiosurgery  (post -SRS)  induced  radionecrosis  versus  recurrent  tumor  (R21;  IRB-13-199).  The 
results  have been  very encouraging  (see Fig. 3).

resection  based  on clinical  grounds,  prior to enrollment  in the 18F-FCholine  PET study  (protocol  
13-199).  Panel  A shows  foci of high 18F-FCholine  uptake  in the lesion.  Panel  B shows  some  
irregular  18F-FDG   uptake  around  the lesion  (the level of uptake  is between  cortex  and white  
matter),  which  is difficult  to interpret.  The official  reading  attributed  the f indings  to radiation  
necrosis  and less likely  viable  tumor.  Panel  C shows  the lesion  with irregular  contrast  
enhancement.  Panel  D shows  a FLAIR  signal  well beyond  the margins  of contrast  enhancement,  
suggesting  the presence  of significant  brain  edema.  The official  p atho log ic d iag no sis of tissue  
removed  at time of surgery  was consistent  with metastatic  adenocarcinoma.

Investigational  Use of 11C-CH. This study  involves  the use of an investigational  radiotracer  11C- 
CH that will be performed  under  the MSKCC  Radioactive  Drug  Research  Council  (RDRC)  and, 
therefore,  will comply  with the requirements   of the committee   as  specified  on page  4 of the 
protocol.  The purpose  of this research  study  is to discover  where  the agent  distributes  within  the 
head  (RDRC  justification),  and explore  whether  11C-CH can distinguish  between  true tumor  
progression  and psuedoprogression  and evaluate  the biodistribution  of 11C-CH in these  lesions.  
No clinical  decisions  will be made  on the basis  of the 11C-CH PET scan.  A total of 6 patients  will 
be enrolled  on this study.  The administered  activity  of 11C-CH has been  determined  to ensure  that 
the radiation  dosimetry  falls below  the limits  required  by RDRC.  
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
4.2 Design  
This is a non-therapeutic  pilot study  performing  11C-CH PET imaging  of patients  with high-grade  
gliomas  who develop  MRI findings  consistent  with recurrent  tumor  and/or  pseudo -progression  
within  24 weeks  after completion  of treatment  with radiation  (with or without  concurrent  therapy).  
The objective  of this trial is to correlate  11C-CH PET SUV measures  with MRI follow -up  
outcomes.  Each  patient  will be followed  up for at least  11 months  after completion  of the PET 
scan  to confirm  MRI changes  as representing  pseudoprogression  or true tumor  progression.  This 
study  will not be used  to make  a clinical  diagnosis  or to change  treatment  decisions.  Six patients  
will be enrolled  on this study  over a 1 year period.  
4.3 Intervention  
 
This study  will enroll  patients  with a histologically  confirmed  diagnosis  of a high-grade  glioma.  
Eligible  patients  must  have undergone  standard  radiation  (typically  60Gy  in 30 fractions),  with or 
without  concurrent  drug therapy,  and have MRI findings  consistent  with tumor  progression  and/or  
pseudoprogression  within  24 weeks  after completion  of radiation.  Eligible  patients  will undergo   
an 11C-CH PET study  within  2 weeks  of the standard  of care MRI that shows  changes  concerning  
for tumor  progression  vs. pseudoprogression.  All patients  will then be followed  with surveillance  
brain  MRI with and without  contrast  as per standard  of care for a period  of 11 months,  to assess  
further  progression  or stabilization  of the lesion.  Initial  MRI changes  are considered  to represent  
pseudoprogression/treatment  related  changes  if the lesion  stabilizes  or becomes  smaller  without  
a change  in tumor -related  therapy.  Otherwise,  it will be considered  a recurrence  should  there  be 
progessive  radiographic  changes.

6.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
Patients  for this study  will be recruited  by physicians  from the Departments  of Neurology.  
Approximately  300 patients  with high grade  gliomas  treated  with radiation  with or without  
concurrent  therapy  are seen  a year.   Approximately  30-40% will develop  progressive  radiographic  
changes  on MRI brain  concerning  for tumor  progression,  typically  within  the first 24 weeks  
following  completion  of treatment  with radiation.   Of those  patients  approximately  30-40% with 
have pseudoprogression  as opposed  to true tumor  progression.  A small  percentage  of these  
patients  will require  surgical  intervention  for symptom  management.   We expect  to enroll  6 
patients  over a one year period  who require  surgical  resection  of the lesion  for management  of 
progressive  symptoms  or if there  is clinical  need  to establish  a histologic  diagno sis. Additional  
patients  may be enrolled  to replace  a previously  enrolled  patient  should  surgical  resection  not 
yield adequate  tissue  to complete  the histopathologic  metrics  required  for the second  objective  of 
the study.  
All adult patients  ≥18 years  are eligible  for participati on regardless  of sex or race.  Every  effort  will 
be made  to encourage  eligible  women  and minorities  to enroll  in this study.  Prior to study  entry,  
the study  staff will explain  to each  potential  subject  the research  objectives,  risks and benefits  of 
study  participation,  alternative  treatments  available,  and the subjects’  rights  and responsibilities.  If 
the patient  agrees  to participate  in the study,  informed  consent  will be obtained  by a consenting  
individual  on the study.  All patients  must  sign written  informed  consent  prior to being  registered  on 
this protocol.  
The principal  investigator  may also screen  the medical  records  of patients  with whom  they do not 
have a treatment  relationship  for the limited  purpose  of identifying  patients  who would  be eligible  
to enroll  in the study  and to record  appropriate  contact  information  in order  to approach  these  
patients  regarding  the possibility  of enrolling  in the study.  
During  the initial  conversation  between  the investigator/research  staff and the patient,  the patient  
may be asked  to provide  certain  health  information  that is necessary  to the recruitment  and 
enrollment  process.  The investigator/research  staff may also review  portions  of their medical  
records  at MSKCC  in order  to further  assess  eligibility.   They  will use the information  provided  by 
the patient  and/or  medical  record  to confirm  that the patient  is eligible  and to contact  the patient  
regarding  study  enrollment.   If the patient  turns  out to be ineligible  for the research  study,  the 
research  staff will destroy  all information  collected  on the patient  during  the initial  conversation  
and medical  records  review,  except  for any information  that must  be maintained  for screening  log 
purposes.  
In most  cases,  the initial  contact  with the prospective  subject  will be conducted  either  by the 
treatment  team,  investigator  or the research  staff working  in consultation  with the treatment  team.

The recruitment  process  outlined  presents  no more  than minimal  risk to the privacy  of the patients  
who are screened  and minimal  PHI will be maintained  as part of a screening  log. 
 
 
7.0 ASSESSMENT/EVALUATION  PLAN  
7.1 PRE-IMAGING EVALUATION 
The following  tests  and procedures  need  to be performed  within  14 days of study  registration  
unless  stated  otherwise:  
• History  and Physical  exam,  including  Neurologic  exam  
• MRI brain  with/without  contrast  with findings  consistent  with radiographic  progression  
versus  pseudoprogression.  
• Laboratory  studies  obtained  as part of standard  clinical  care 
o Serum  creatinine  
o Serum  pregnancy  test (women  of childbearing  potential)  within  7 days of the 
first PET scan  
 
7.2 11C-CH PET imaging  and injection  
All patients  will undergo  a single  head  PET/CT  scan,  measuring  11C-CHradioactivity.   This 
PET scan  will be performed  within  2 weeks  of the brain  MRI that demonstrates  
radiographic  findings  concerning  for true tumor  progression  vs pseudoprogression.  
Various  metrics  derived  from this data (including  simple  threshold  SUV values)  will be 
assessed  for their ability  to differentiate  between  pseudoprogression  and recurrent  tumor  
as confirmed  by the evolution  of the lesion  on subsequent  standard  of care surveillance  
MRIs.  
 
Radiographic  changes  will be defined  as progression  rather  than pseudoprogression  
within  that 24 week  window  per modified  RANO  criteria.   However,  unlike  the RANO  
criteria,  the protocol  will allow  for a broader  window  of 24 weeks  after completion  of 
radiation  instead  of 12 weeks  to maximize  enrollment.  Progression  can only be defined  
using  diagnostic  imaging  less than 24 weeks  after completion  of radiation  if there  is new 
enhancement  outside  the radiation  field (beyond  the high-dose  region  or 80% isodose  
line) or if there  is unequivocal  evidence  of viable  tumor  or histopathologic  sampling  (ie, 
>70%  tumor  cell nuclei  in areas,  high or progressive  increase  in MIB-proliferation   index  
compared  with prior tissue,  or evidence  for histologic  progression  or increased  anaplasia  
in tumor).   Given  the difficulty  of differentiating   true progression  from pseudoprogression,  
clinical  decline  alone,  in the absence  of radiographic  or histologic  confirmation  of 
progression,  will not be sufficient  for definition  of progressive  disease  in the first 24 weeks  
after completion  of radiation.   Follow -up brain  MRI with and without  contrast  per standard  
of care will be used  in the assessment  of the evolution  of these  lesions.   Further  increase  
in enhancement  in subsequent  MRI warranting  a change  in therapy  per the treating  
physician  will define  progression  unless  proven  otherwise  by a histopatholigcally  
confirmed  diagnosis.   Lesions  that stabilize  or reduce  in size will be deemed  consistent  
with pseudoprogression.  
 
Radiation  Exposure  (dosimetry).  Radiation  exposure  from 11C-CH PET imaging  study  has been  
estimated  and published.[ 55, 56] The critical  organ  exposures  are: kidney  0.64,  bladder  wall 0.36,  
and liver 0.26 cGy/mCi  with all other  organs   receiving   less than 0.25 cGy per mCi injected.  Doses  
to the most  radiation  sensitive tissues  red marrow,   testes  and ovaries   are 0.075,  0.057,  and 0.067  
cGy/mCi  respectively.  The RDRC   requires   that the administered  activity result  in <30mSv  to the 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

radiosensitive  tissues  that include  the lens of the eye, gonads,  bone  marrow,   and GI tract,  and 
<50mSv  for all other  organs   per administration.   Dosimetry  data for lens of the eye was not 
available   (visual   uptake  of F-choline  was not observed   for this organ).    Additionally,  if more  than 
one administration  of the radiotracer  will be given,   then the study  must  ensure  <50mSv  for the 
radiosensitive  organs   and <150mSv  for all other  organs  within  a single  year.   These  factors  taken  
together  influenced  the selection  of a total administered  activity of not more  than 14mCi  for this 
study  in order  to be within  compliance  with the RDRC  dosimetry  regulations.    The organ  dose  
estimates  from this study  are provided   in Table  3. 
 
Radiosynthesis  and Specific  Activity of 11C- CH.   The 11C-CH drug product  will be manufactured   in 
compliance  with the current  Good  Manufacturing   Practices  (cGMP)  requirements   at the MSKCC  
Radiochemistry   and Molecular  Imaging  Probes  Core Facility,  using  the ORA  Neptis  automated  
synthesizer.  The synthesizer  cassettes,  and reagents   and materials  will be supplied  by ABX 
Advanced   Biochemical  Compounds   (Radeberg,   Germany).  11C-choline   injection  contains  30 mCi 
to 400 mCi in approximately   10 ml of 11C-choline   at EOS  (End of Synthesis)  calibration  time in 
aqueous   0.9%  sodium  chloride  solution.   The patient  unit dose  will consist  of 10-20 mCi of 11C- 
choline.  With a molecular  weight  of 104, 20 mCi of 11C-choline   corresponds   to 104 mg/mmol  x 
2x10 -6 mmol  = 200x10 -6  mg = 2x10 -4 mg of administered.   All manufactured   18F-FCH drug product  
batches  will be Quality  Control   (QC) tested  to ensure  conformance   with the acceptance  
specifications  for pH, appearance,   radiochemical   purity,  radiochemical   identity,  radionuclidic   
identity,  endotoxin  levels,   sterilizing  filter integrity,  and residual  solvent   levels   prior to release  for 
patient  administration.  Sterility  testing  will performed   post release.  
 
11C-CH Delivery   to the MITS  Radiopharmacy   from  Radiochemistry   (RMIP)  Core.  11C-CH dose  will 
be delivered   by Radiochemistry   (RMIP)  Core to MITS   Clinical  Radio -pharmacy   in Nuclear    
Medicine.  MITS  Clinical  Nuclear  Pharmacist  receives   the delivery   from  RMIP  Core and ensures    
that the study  drug is handled,  inventoried,   stored  properly,  labeled  and dispensed  as per AU MITS  
Physician  prescription  order.   The  11C-CH dose  will be drawn  and measured  in a Dose  Calibrator  by 
a MITs  Nuclear  Pharmacist  prior to dispensing.  Then,   the syringe  will be placed  in a shielded   
Carrier  and handed   over to AU MD or designee  for administration.  After  the dose  administration  the 
AU MD returns  the Syringe  for Residual  Measurement   by MITS   Nuclear  Pharmacist.  All MITS  
Radiopharmacy   activity will be documented   by MITS   Nuclear  Pharmacist.  
 
PET imaging  Protocol . Patients  will undergo  PET scanning  following   intravenous   administration  of 
up to 10-20 mCi (6-20mCI   to permit  for decay ) of 11C-CH under  the regulation  and approval   of the 
MSKCC  RDRC.   10-20 mCi of 11C-choline   will be administered  intravenously   as a bolus,  followed  
by 10-30 mL of normal  saline  flush,  with the patient  already  placed  on the bed of the scanner  unit. 
Imaging  will begin  approximately  5 minutes  after injection  of 11C-choline.We   will accrue  6 
evaluable   research  subjects  with the purpose  of determining   the biodistribution  within  the evolving  
lesion.  No information   gleaned  from the PET images  or biodistribution  data shall be used  to affect  
patient   management.  
 
Patients  will be set up for a static  single  field of view (15 cm) head  scan  by means  of a scout  and 
low-dose  CT scan.  11C-CH will be administered  as an intravenous   slow bolus  with simultaneous  
initiation  of the scan  sequence.  The patient  will be positioned  in the PET/CT  in the scan  ready  
position  prior to the radiopharmacy   dispensing  the 11C-CH activity. In this way the activity 
administered  to the patient  is within  10% of the prescribed  activity as required  by research  PET 
studies.  11C-CH, for intravenous   bolus  injection,  is a PET imaging  agent  with a half-life  of 20.4 min. 
Prior  studies  have shown  that tracer  uptake  plateaus  within  15-20 minutes  post-injection.  A single  
PET scan  will be performed   for up to a maximum  of 40 min to ensure  capture  of the uptake.  
 
PET Imaging  Analysis .  The procedures   described  above   will yield a number  of parameters   that 
individually   or in specific  combinations   will be assessed  in their ability  to distinguish  treatment  
related  changes   from recurrent   tumor.  A positive  11C-CH PET study,  one which  is believed   to 
indicate  recurrent   tumor,  is one in which  there  are visible  focal “hot spots”  (a focus  of lesion/normal  
white  matter  ratio >1.4)  of 11C-CH.

8.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
The recommended  daily dietary  intake  of choline  is 500mg  per day and the maximum  safe level of 
choline  is 3.5 g/day.  The amount  of 11C-CH to be administered  will be at tracer  micrograms levels,  
which  are orders  of magnitude  below  the safety  limits  for choline.  Therefore  chemical  toxicity  is  
not expected.  No toxicities  associated  with “tracer  doses”  of 11C-CH have been  reported.  The 
dose -limiting  toxicity  is therefore  associated  solely  with the radiation  emissions  emanating  from  
the 11C radiolabel.  The activities  of 11C-CH that shall be administered  will be up to 10-20 mCi 
(approximately  6-20mCi).  The expected  radiation  doses  from this maximum  administration  level of 
20 mCi is given  in total dose  column  of the table below,  which  also includes  the 0.9 cGy 
contribution  from the low-dose  CT (Table  3). Exposure  falls within  the constraints  imposed  by an 
RDRC  protocol.  
While  toxicities  are not anticipated  on this trial, all patients  will have a follow  up toxicity  
assessment  by a member  of the reasearch  team  (MD, NP, or RN), either  in person  or over the 
phone,  1-3 days following  the research  scans.  The participants  will be asked  whether  they have 
suffered  any adverse  events  and these  will be documented.

would  receive  only a  negligibly   small scatter  dose.  
 
 
9.0 PRIMARY  OUTCOMES  
We will assess  11C-CH tracer  biodistribution  within  high-grade  glioma  lesions  with MRI findigns  
concerning  for pseudoprogression  vs. true tumor  progression  after treatment  with radiation.   PET 
imaging  metrics  will be collected;  peak SUV values  in the lesion  and the tumor  to background  
ratio will be compared  to clinical  follow -up outcomes  based  on MRIs.  
We expect  that there  will be low uptake  of 11C-CH in perilesional  normal  brain  tissue  and SUV 
measures  will correlate  with clinical  follow -up outcomes,  thus supporting  more  definitive  
investigation  of 11C-CH PET to noninvasively  distinguish  recurrent  tumor  (true tumor  progression ) 
from necrosis  and inflammation  (pseudoprogression ) in post-treatment  MRI-evolving  brain  
lesions.

11.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
This trial is a pilot study  to determine  the distribution  of 11C-CH using  PET imaging  in progressive  
high-grade  glioma  lesions  suspected  to represent  true tumor  progression  vs pseudo -progression,  
following  treatment  with a course  of radiation.   The purpose  of this trial is to correlate  SUV 
measures  from 11C-CH PET with evolving  changes  on brain  MRI in high-grade  glioma  after 
radiotherapy.  In a small  subgroup  of patients  required  surgery,  tissue  will be analyzed  for 
histopathologic  correlate.  The data gathered  will not be considered  definitive,  but rather  will be 
used  to as preliminary  data in support  of a larger,  definitive  study . 
 
The biodistribution  of 11C-CH will be measured  using  PET as a basis  for dosimetry.  This will be 
performed  with region  of interest  analysis.  The first objective  is to determine  the organ/tissue  
uptake  and tumor  localization  following  intravenous  injection  of 11C-CH in patients  with high-grade  
glioma  with radiographic  progression  concerning  for progression  versus  pseudoprogression  
following  treatment  with radiation  with or without  chemotherapy.  The group  for this analysis  
comprises  6 high-grade  glioma  patients  who appear  to have progression  vs pseudoprogression  
on standard  MRI with contrast.  Standardized  uptake  values  (SUV)  in the brain  will be measured  
and summarized  for each  patient  to describe  the organ  and tissue  uptake  of the tracer.  The mean  
SUV along  with SUVmax  value  will be estimated  in normal  and tumor  tissue,  and lesion -to-normal  
brain  ratio (LNR)  values  will be obtained.  All patients  will then we followed  with surveillance  brain  
MRI per standard  treatment  over a period  of 11 months  for evolving  changes  that will confirm  the 
diagnosis  of progression  versus  pseudoprogression  as defined  in the protocol.

Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by the 
study  team,  at a minimum  of  two times  per year,  more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
 
13.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  
were  approved  by the National  Cancer  Institute  in September  2001.  The plans  address  the 
new policies  set forth by the NCI in the document  entitled  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  
Institute  for Data and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials,”  which  can be found  at: 
http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/condu cting/dsm -guidelines  /page1.

Approval date: 11 -Sep-2019  
Page  18 of 23  
  
 
The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  established  and are monitored  by the Office  of Clinical  
Research.  The MSKCC  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  
Intranet  at: 
http://inside2/clinresearch/Documents/MSKCC%20Data%20and%20Safety%20Monitoring  
%20Plans.pdf  
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by which  clinical  trials are monitored  for data,  
safety,  and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  
protocol  monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and 
staff education  on clinical  research  quality  assurance)  and departmental  procedures  for 
quality  control,  plus there  are two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for 
monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials programs:  the Data and Safety  Monitoring  
Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  Monitoring  
Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III  clinical  trials,  report  to the Center’s  Research  Council  and 
IRB. 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for 
its level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.   Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH 
sponsored,  in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be 
addressed  and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  
activation.  
14.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
Risks:  There  are no expected  additional  risks to the patients  who participate  in this study.  
Patients  will receive  the current  standard  of care for their disease.  PET/CT  is considered  a 
minimal  risk procedure.  FDG  PET/CT  is a standard  diagnostic  test utilized  in the 
management  of patients  with high grade  gliomas.  18F-FCH PET is not standard  but poses  
no risk other  than a very minimal  radiation  exposure  as detailed  above.  No additional  risks 
have been  reported  in patients  receiving  18F-FCH PET scans.  Patients  may experience  
pain and/or  discomfort  related  to the IV catheter,  but they would  commonly  require  IV 
contrast  for their routine  scans  in any case.  
Costs:  The patient  and/or  patient’s  insurance  will be responsible  for all charges,  which  are 
part of the standard  of care.  No financial  reimbursement  or other  financial  incentive  will be 
provided  for patients  to enroll  in this study.  There  will be no charge  for the 18F-FCH 
PET/CT  studies  or the tissue  analysis  of radioactivity  levels.  
Benefits:  We do not expect  patients  to derive  any clinical  benefit  from this clinical  trial. We 
hope  that in the future,  knowledge  from this trial will help better  evaluate  diagnostic  
procedures  for these  diseases.  
All patients  will sign informed  consents  and have all their questions  fully addressed  before  
enrolling  in this study.  During  the informed  consent  process,  it will be made  clear  to the 
potential  patient  that participation  is entirely  voluntary,  and will not impact  the care that 
they receive  at MSKCC.  Potential  patients  will be advised  of alternatives  to the proposed  
study,  including  not participating  in the study.  All the data will be held confidential,  
maintained  in a password  protected  electronic  database,  and comply  with all HIPAA  
guidelines.

14.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  
outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of 
existing  hospitalization  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to 
conduct  normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  
or require  hospitalization  may be considered  serious  when,  based  upon  
medical  judgment,  they may jeopardize  the patient  or participant  and may 
require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in 
this definition  
 
Note: Hospital admission  for a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not 
considered  an SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  starts  investigational  
treatment/intervention. SAE reporting is required for 30-days after the participant’s 
last investigational  treatment/intervention.  Any event  that occur  after the 30-day 
period  that is unexpected  and at least possibly  related  to protocol  treatment  must  
be reported . 
 
Please  note:  Any SAE that occurs  prior to the start of investigational  treatment/intervention  
and is related  to a screening  test or procedure  (i.e., a screening  biopsy)  must  be reported.

All SAEs  must  be submitted  in PIMS.  If an SAE requires  submission  to the HRPP  
office  per IRB SOP  RR-408 ‘Reporting  of Serious  Adverse  Events’,  the SAE report  
must  be submitted  within  5 calendar  days of the event.   All other  SAEs  must  be 
submitted  within  30 calendar  days of the event.  
The report  should  contain  the following  information:  
 
• The date the adverse  event  occurred  
• The adverse  event  
• The grade  of the event  
• Relationship  of the adverse  event  to the treatment(s)  
• If the AE was expected  
• Detailed  text that includes  the following  
o An explanation  of how the AE was handled  
o A description  of the participant’s  condition  
o Indication  if the participant  remains  on the study  
• If an amendment  will need  to be made  to the protocol  and/or  consent  form 
• If the SAE is an Unanticipated  Problem

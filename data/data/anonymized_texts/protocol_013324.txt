Title of Study: An Open -Label Study to Characterize  the Incidence and Severity of Diarrhea in Patients with 
Early -Stage HER2+ Breast Cancer Treated with Neratinib and Loperamide  
Condition or Disease:  HER2 -positive Breast Cancer  
Approximate Values  
Number of Patients  Approximately 750  Duration of Patient  Participation  1 year  
Number of Centers  Approximately 74  Duration of Study  7 years  
Objectives:  
Primary:  The primary objective of this study is to characterize the incidence and severity of diarrhea in patients with 
early -stage HER2 overexpressed/amplified (HER2+) breast cancer treated with neratinib when administered with 
intensive loperamide prophylaxis, after prior treatment with trastuzumab.  
Secondary: The secondary objectives of this study are:  
 To assess the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) and other adverse events of special interest (AESI).  
 To assess the incidence and severity of diarrhea after the administration of an anti -inflammatory agent (for 
patients enrolled under Amendment 3) , a bile acid sequestrant (for patients enrolled under Amendment 4 and 
Amendment  5), or following 2 different dose -escalation regimens of neratinib (for patients enrolled under 
Amendment  6/6.1 and for patients enrolled starting with Amendment 7, respective ly). 
Exploratory:   
Exploratory objectives include:  
 For patients enrolled starting with Amendment 2:  
 To assess patient -reported health outcomes using the EuroQol 5D -5L (EQ -5D-5L) and the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy Breast (FACT -B) questionnaire s. 
 To collect biomarkers of disease from cell -free DNA (cfDNA) to evaluate their relationship to clinical 
recurrence of disease.  
 For patients enrolled starting with Amendment 6:  
 Evaluation of stool bacterial diversity (microbiome)   
 For patients enrolled starting with Amendment 6.1:  
 To assess patient -reported health outcomes using the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL)  
Study Design:  
This is an open -label, Phase  2 study that will investigate the incidence of diarrhea in HER2+ breast cancer patients 
receiving neratinib with intensive loperamide diarrhea prophylaxis , alone and in combination with an anti -inflammatory 
treatment or a bile acid sequestrant  treatment,  who have previously undergone a course of trastuzumab therapy in the 
adjuvant setting.  
Patients will receive:  
 Neratinib 240  mg orally once daily for thirteen (13) 28 -day cycles.  
 Loperamide daily for two (2) 28 -day cycles and then as needed.

Puma Biotechnology Page 4 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL  For patients enrolled under Amendment 3, an anti -inflammatory treatment for 1 cycle and loperamide t o be 
administered daily for two (2) 28 -day cycles and then as needed, thereafter;  
 For patients enrolled under Amendment 4, colestipol for 1 cycle and loperamide to be administered 1 cycle 
and then as needed, thereafter;  
 For patients enrolled under Amendment 5, colestipol for 1 cycle and loperamide to be administered on an as -
needed basis only.  
 For patients enrolled under Amendment 6/6.1, 120 mg neratinib for Week 1 (C1D1 – C1D7), followed by 160 
mg neratinib for Week  2 (C1D8 – C1D14), followed by 24 0 mg neratinib for Week 3 and thereafter (C1D15 
to End -of-treatment [EOT]). Loperamide will be administered on an as -needed basis only.  
 For patients enrolled starting with Amendment 7, 160 mg neratinib for the first 2 weeks  (C1D1 – C1D14), 
followed by 20 0 mg neratinib for the next 2 weeks (C1D15 – C1D28), followed by 240 mg neratinib 
thereafter (C2D1 to End -of-treatment [EOT]). Loperamide will be administered on an as -needed basis only.  
Patients will receive neratinib for 13  cycles (364  days) or until dis ease recurrence (as determined by the Investigator), 
death, unacceptable toxicity, or other specified withdrawal criterion.  
The effect of the anti -inflammatory treatment budesonide  and the bile acid sequestrant, colestipol, on the incidence, 
severity, and  duration of diarrhea will be investigated in sequential patient cohorts using a sample size of approximately 
64 patients per cohort. The anti -inflammatory cohort added in Amendment 3 will be assigned to receive budesonide 
9 mg once daily with or without f ood for 28 days along with neratinib 240 mg /day (13 cycles) and intensive 
loperamide prophylaxis that will continue through the first 2 cycles (total 56 days), and then on an as -needed basis 
thereafter.  
Following the completion of enrollment of the patien ts receiving budesonide, neratinib, and intensive loperamide 
prophylaxis, the next cohort will be evaluated after receiving colestipol 2 g twice daily with or without food for 28 
days, to be taken at least 2 hours after, but at least 4 hours before, nerati nib 240 mg /day (13 cycles) and intensive 
loperamide prophylaxis. For this cohort, intensive loperamide prophylaxis will continue through the first cycle (total 28 
days); for Cycle 2 and beyond, loperamide may be administered as needed (PRN).  
Following com plete enrollment of  the cohort treated with colestipol + intensive loperamide prophylaxis, all patients in 
the next cohort will be evaluated after receiving colestipol and neratinib with loperamide administered on a PRN basis 
only.  
Following complete enro llment of the cohort receiving neratinib + colestipol + loperamide PRN, all patients in the next 
cohort will be evaluated after receiving neratinib administered according to the following dose -escalation scheme: 
120 mg neratinib for 1 week (C1D1 – C1D7), f ollowed by 160 mg neratinib for Week 2 (C1D8 – C1D14), followed by 
240 mg neratinib for Week 3 and thereafter (C1D15 to EOT). Loperamide is to be administered on a PRN basis only.  
Following complete enrollment of all patients in the 120 mg/160 mg/240 mg d ose-escalation scheme, patients enrolled 
in the next cohort will be evaluated after receiving neratinib administered according to a second dose escalation 
scheme: 160  mg neratinib to be taken for the first 2 weeks (C1D1 – C1D14), followed by 200 mg neratin ib to be taken 
for the next 2 weeks (C1D15 – C1D28), followed by 240 mg neratinib daily dose taken thereafter (C2D1 to EOT). 
Loperamide is to be administered on a PRN basis only.  
The Sponsor will regularly review accumulating safety data (by individual sub ject and in aggregate). Early termination 
of a cohort or the study may be permitted if data indicate that anti -diarrheal treatment is ineffective.  
Patients in all treatment groups will continue to complete the remaining 12 treatment cycles.  
The final analy sis will be conducted after all patients have completed 13  cycles of study treatment or have met other 
specified withdrawal criterion (see Section  10). 
The study will end when all patients have been followed up for 28 days after the last dose of neratinib.

Safety Assessments:  
The primary endpoint is the incidence of Grade 3 or higher diarrhea. AEs and AESIs will be graded according to the 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (NCI CTCAE), version  4.0. SAEs and AESIs will be reported 
through 28  days after the las t dose of investigational product and will be followed until resolution or until condition 
stabilizes. Should an Investigator be made aware of any SAEs occurring any time after the reporting period that may be 
causally related to neratinib’s administration , it should be promptly reported. Safety will also be assessed based on 
medical history, vital sign measurements, physical examination findings, electrocardiogram results, MUGA or ECHO, 
and laboratory assessments.  
Other Assessments:  
Patient Reported Health Outcomes Assessments  
The following questionnaires will be used to collect patient -reported health outcomes data:  
1) EQ-5D-5L Health Questionnaire (for patients enrolled starting with Amendment 2)  
2) FACT -B (for patients enrolled starting with Amendment 2)  
3) RSCL (for patients enrolled starting with Amendment 6.1)  
Patient -reported outcomes assessments will be performed at C1D1, C2D1, C4D1, C7D1, C10D1, and C13D28/EOT.  
Biomarkers (for patients enrolled starting with Amendment 2)  
cfDNA  will be obtained from plasma samples collected at Screening, C7D1, C13D28 and/or at time of treatment 
discontinuation, and at disease recurrence; cfDNA will undergo molecular profiling to identify biomarkers of disease 
recurrence.  
Microbiome Evaluation (f or patients enrolled starting with Amendment 6)   
At select study centers, a stool swab will be collected at Screening, C2D1, and C4D1 and/or at time of treatment 
discontinuation if earlier than C4D1 for possible future assessments of microbiome to assess the effect that neratinib 
has on the microbiome (currently in US only).  
Disease Recurrence  
Clinical documentation of recurrence, including recurrence site, radiographic, and/or pathologic procedures will be 
collected at end -of -treatment (EOT).

Puma Biotechnology Page 9 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL Statistical Methods:  
Sample Size:  
The first 120 patients will be under the Original Protocol, Amendment 1, and Amendment 2. The incidence of Grade  3 
or higher diarrhea is assumed to be 15% in this study. A sample size of 120  patients will ensure that the width of the 
95% Clopper -Pearson CI of the incidence of Grade  3 or higher diarrhea is no more than 18.5%. For example, if 18 out 
of the 120 patients are observed to have Grade 3 or higher diarrhea, the incidence and its 95% (2 -sided) CIs will be 
15.0% (9.1 %, 22.7%) where the width of the CI is 13.5%.  
In addition to the analyses of the overall safety population, anti -diarrheal prophylaxis regimen -specific subgroup 
analyses will be performed as needed. Precision of the estimated 95%  CIs for the regimen -specific subgroup(s) will be 
lower than what is provided above for the overall safety population.  
To further investigate treatments, cohorts were added. For patients enrolled under Amendment 3, the effect of 
budesonide + mandatory loperamide prophylaxis o n the incidence, severity, and duration of diarrhea will be assessed.  
For patients enrolled under Amendment 4 and Amendment 5, the effect of colestipol + mandatory loperamide 
prophylaxis (Amendment 4) and colestipol + PRN loperamide (Amendment 5) will be assessed; for patients enrolled 
under Amendment 6/6.1 and under Amendment 7/7.1, the effect of the dose escalation regimen of neratinib will be 
assessed. The incidence of Grade 3 or higher diarrhea will be evaluated. A sample size of 64 patients will ensur e that 
the width of the 95% Clopper -Pearson CI of the incidence of Grade 3 or higher diarrhea is no more than 26%. For 
example, if 7 out of the 64 patients are observed to have Grade 3 or higher diarrhea, the incidence and its 95% (2 -sided) 
CI will be 10.9 % (4.5 –21.2%) where the width of the CI is 17%.  
For each additional cohort, a sample size of 100 patients will ensure that the width of the 95% Clopper -Pearson CI of 
the incidence of Grade 3 or higher diarrhea is no more than 21%. For example, if 15 out o f the 100 patients are 
observed to have Grade 3 or higher diarrhea, the incidence and its 95% (2 -sided) CI will be 15.0% (8.7 –23.5%) where 
the width of the CI is 15%.  
Cohorts will continue to enroll without interruption, in sequence. Thus enrollment may ex ceed initial projections.  
Statistical Analysis : 
The primary endpoint is the incidence of Grade 3 or higher diarrhea. The accompanying 2 -sided 95% Clopper -Pearson 
CIs will be computed.  
Safety:  
All patients who receive a dose of neratinib will be analyzed f or safety.  Treatment emergent AEs, SAEs, and AESIs, as 
well as select laboratory tests will be summarized. Deaths and discontinuation from study treatment will also be 
summarized.  
Exploratory:  
Patient -related outcomes data (scores from the EQ -5D-5L, FACT -B, and RSCL questionnaires) will be summarized 
and plotted over time. Changes from baseline will be provided with both point estimates and CIs.  
Exploratory analyses will be conducted to evaluate the relationship between disease biomarkers identified from 
molecular profiling and indications of clinical disease recurrence.  
Microbiome evaluation from participating sites will be summarized at baseline, C2D1, C4D1, and/or at time of 
treatment discontinuation. No formal statistical analyses are planned of the microbiome data.  
All analyses of exploratory endpoints are descriptiv e and no formal testing is planned.  
Interim Analysis:  
An interim analysis is planned when approximately 120 patients enrolled under the Original protocol, Amendment 1, 
and Amendment 2, have completed at least 2  cycles (56  days) of neratinib with loperamid e prophylaxis. The interim 
analysis will only include those 120 patients enrolled under the Original Protocol, Amendment 1, and Amendment 2. 
Other additional analyses by cohort, in addition to the interim analysis, may be carried out as required.

2.1. Background 
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in women and the leading cause of 
cancer mortality in women worldwide. Breast cancer accounted for approximately 522,000 
deaths worldwide in 2012, and the global incidence of new cases in women was approximately 
1.67 million ( International Agency for Research on Cancer, GLOBOCAN 2012) . 
2
.2. ERBB2 Gene and Cancer 
2.2.1. T he Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Family (ERBB)   
Membe
rs of the epidermal growth factor family of trans-membrane receptors (ERBB family) are 
potent mediators of normal cell growth and development and are expressed in various tissues of 
epithelial, mesenchymal and neuronal origin ( Baselga et al, 2009 ). The ERBB family consists of 
4 closely related type 1 trans-membrane tyrosine kinase receptors: epidermal growth factor 
re
ceptor (EGFR; also known as HER1), ERBB2 (HER2), ERBB3 (HER3), and ERBB4 (HER4).  
Aberrant expression of HER1, HER2, and HER3 are linked to development of many epithelial 
cancers including colorectal, gastric, breast, and head and neck cancers. These membrane-
spanning proteins receive extracellular signals from small peptide-ligand molecules, including 
epidermal growth factor-like molecules, transforming growth factor-α and neuregulins. Under 
normal physiological conditions, activation of the ERBB receptors is controlled by the spatial 
and temporal expression of their ligands ( Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001 ). Ligand binding 
triggers intracellular signaling through a complex and tightly controlled array of signaling 
pathways that together drive and regulate many cellular functions, including cell proliferation 
and organ development and repair. Binding of ligands to extracellular parts of HER1, HER3 and 
HER4 will result in dimerization and initiates a series of signaling cascades that includes 
mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and mammalian target 
of rapamycin (mTOR) ( Garrett and Arteaga, 2011 ).  
Each receptor comprises an extracellular domain at which ligand binding occurs, an alpha-helical 
tra
ns-membrane segment and an intracellular protein tyrosine kinase domain ( Olayioye et al, 
2000). Receptor dimerization is an essential requirement for signaling activity of these receptors 
a
nd can occur between two different ERBB receptors (hetero-dimerization) or between two 
molecules of the same receptor (homo-dimerization) (Olayioye et al, 2000 ; Ferguson et al, 2003). 
ERB
B homodimers weakly perpetuate signals compared with heterodimers ( Yarden and 
Sliwkowski, 2001 ). As the natural ligand for HER2 has not been identified, the receptor is 
presumed to exert its effects via formation of heterodimers with other HER family members and 
it is thought to be the preferred dimerization partner for the other receptors ( Rosen et al, 2010 ). 
In fact, heterodimer formation with HER2 has been shown to increase the affinity of ligand 
binding to the dimerization partner ( Graus-Porta et al, 1997 ). Dimerization of HER3, which lacks 
intrinsic kinase activity, with HER2 induces phosphorylation of HER3, which then activates the 
PI3K and Akt pathways ( Graus-Porta et al, 1997 ).

Puma Biotechnology Page 20 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL 2.2.2.  ERBB2-positive Cancers 
ERBB2 amplification and over-expression have been reported in 18 to 25% of human breast 
cancers and subsets of patients with ovarian and salivary gland tumors ( Slamon et al, 1987 ; 
Vermeij et al, 2008 ; Cornolti et al, 2007 ). Approximately 15 to 20% ( Ahn et al, 2012 ; Saini et al, 
2011) of women with breast cancer are ERBB2-positive, which is associated with aggressive 
disea
se and poor prognosis ( Slamon et al, 1987 ), including enhanced cell proliferation, reduced 
progression-free survival (PFS), and reduced overall survival (OS) (Slamon et al, 1987 ; Zhang et 
al, 2007 ; Badache and Goncalves 2006 ; Slamon et al, 1989 ). Compared with female breast 
cancer, male breast cancer cases are more often hormonal receptor (estrogen 
receptor/progesterone receptor) positive and HER2 negative, but treatment of male breast cancer 
patients follows the same indications as female postmenopausal breast cancer with surgery, 
systemic therapy and radiotherapy ( Ottini et al, 2010 ). These observations have motivated the 
development of therapies targeting HER2. 
2.3. Current Therapies Targeting ERBB Receptors 
2.3.1. T rastuzumab  
Trastuzumab ( Herceptin® Package Insert , Herceptin Summary of Product Characteristics 
[
SmPC] , Herceptin Product Monograph) , the first agent approved for treatment of HER2+ breast 
cancer, is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the juxtamembrane portion of the HER2/neu 
re
ceptor, resulting in inhibition of tumor proliferation ( Goldenberg, 1999 ). While the exact 
mechanism of action is uncertain, Junttila et al (2009)  reported that trastuzumab induced 
diss
ociation of ligand independent HER2-HER3 heterodimers resulting in dephosphorylation of 
HER3 and inhibition of downstream signaling, and Park et al (2010)  reported that the antitumor 
effects of trastuzumab also involved antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity.  
2.3.2. P ertuzumab  
Pertuzumab ( Perjeta® Package Insert )  is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds HER2 at a 
diff
erent epitope of the HER2 extracellular domain (subdomain II) than trastuzumab ( Baselga et 
al, 2012 ) thereby preventing HER2 from dimerizing with other ligand-activated HER receptors, 
most notably HER3 ( Baselga and Swain, 2009 ; Agus et al, 2002 ). The HER2-HER3 heterodimer 
is considered to be the most potent signaling pair ( Agus et al, 2002 ), driving cell proliferation in 
HER2+ cancer ( Lee-Hoeflich et al, 2008 ; Hsieh and Moasser, 2007 ). In recent studies, the 
addition of pertuzumab to combination therapy has led to improvements in PFS in patients with 
HER2+ metastatic brea
st cancer (MBC) and higher response rates in the preoperative setting 
(Murphy and Morris, 2012 ). 
2.3.3. P ertuzumab in Combination with Trastuzumab 
Although treatment with trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy (as compared with 
chemotherapy alone) significantly improves PFS and OS among patients with HER2+ MBC, in 
most patients, the disease progresses ( Nahta and Esteva, 2007 ).  
Because pertuzumab and trastuzumab bind to different HER2 epitopes and have complementary 
mechanisms of action, the combination of these two agents, provide a more comprehensive 
blockade of HER2 signaling and result in greater antitumor activity than either agent alone in 
Neratinib Tablets (PB-272) 25-JUL-2019 
P
rotocol:  PUMA-NER-6201  Amendment 7.1 
Puma Biotechnology Page 21 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL HER2+ tumor models ( Lee-Hoeflich et al, 2008; S cheuer et al, 2009 ). In Phase 2 studies, a 
pertuzumab plus trastuzumab regimen showed activity in patients with HER2+ MBC ( Baselga et 
al, 2010 ; Portera et al, 2008 ) a nd in patients with early breast cancer ( Gianni et al, 2010 ).  
The Clinical Evaluation of pertuzumab and trastuzumab (CLEOPATRA) study assessed the 
efficacy and safety of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel, as compared with placebo 
plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel (control group), as first-line treatment for patients with HER2+ 
MBC who had not received chemotherapy or biologic therapy for their metastatic disease 
(Baselga et al, 2012 ). At the final analysis (median follow-up of 50 months), treatment with 
pe
rtuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel resulted in significant improvement in PFS and OS 
with an unprecedented increase of 15.7 months in median OS, compared with the control group 
(Swain et al, 2014 ). CLEOPATRA findings suggest that targeting HER2+ tumors with two 
anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies that have complementary mechanisms of action results in a 
more comprehensive blockade of HER2 and highlights the clinical importance of preventing the 
ligand-dependent formation of HER2 dimers in order to silence HER2 signaling to the greatest 
extent possible ( Baselga and Swain, 2009 ; Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001 ).  
Pertuzumab received approval in the US in 2012 for use in combination with trastuzumab and 
docetaxel for the treatment of patients with HER2+ MBC who have not received prior anti HER2 
therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease. In 2013, pertuzumab received approval for use 
in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with 
HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory or early-stage breast cancer (either greater than 
2 cm in diameter or node positive) as part of a complete treatment regimen for early breast 
c
ancer. 
2.3.4. Ado -trastuzumab Emtansine  
Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, Kadcyla® Package Insert ) is a n antibody-drug conjugate 
that combines HER2-targeted delivery of the potent microtubule polymerization inhibitor 
emtansine (DM1), a derivative of maytansine, with the antitumor activity of trastuzumab ( Lewis 
Phillips et al, 2008 ; R emillard et al, 1975 ; Cassady et al, 2004 ; Widdison et al, 2006 ; Junttila et 
al, 2011 ). In T-DM1, trastuzumab and DM1 are covalently linked via a stable thioether linker 
(N-
maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, which is thought to limit the exposure of 
normal tissue to DM1 (
Krop et al, 2010 ; Burris et al, 2011 ). Antitumor activity was established 
in a proof of concept Phase 2 study of single-agent T-DM1 in patients with HER2+ MBC, who 
had progressed while receiving HER2-directed therapy ( Burris et al, 2011 ). Furthermore, in a 
single-arm Phase 2 study, T-DM1 demonstrated efficacy in patients with HER2+ MBC who 
previously received all standard HER2-directed therapies (trastuzumab, lapatinib, an 
anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine) ( Krop et al, 2012 ).  
Primary results from the EMILIA study (a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter study of T-DM1 
compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients with HER2+ locally advanced or MBC 
previously treated with a trastuzumab-based regimen and a taxane) showed a significant and 
clinically meaningful improvement with T-DM1 in PFS compared with lapatinib plus 
capecitabine ( Verma et al, 2012 ). Other end points supported T-DM1 as an active and well-
tolerated novel therapy for HER2+ advanced breast cancer. T-DM1 is approved in the US for 
patients with HER2-positive MBC who have previously received trastuzumab and a taxane 
separately or in combination.

Other HER2-targeted agents include lapatinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that 
targets the tyrosine kinase domains of both EGFR and HER2 ( Rusnak and Gilmer, 2011 ). 
Trastuzumab and lapatinib have received approval from the United States (US) Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-
overexpressing breast cancer who have previously been treated with an anthracycline, a taxane, 
and trastuzumab.  
2.4. Neratinib  
Neratinib (PB-272) is a potent irreversible pan ERBB inhibitor. Neratinib is an orally available 
small molecule that inhibits ERBB1, ERBB2, and ERBB4 at the intracellular tyrosine kinase 
domains, a
 mechanism of action that is different from trastuzumab. Neratinib reduces ERBB1 
and ERBB2 autophosphorylation, downstream signaling, and the growth of ERBB1 and ERBB2 
dependent cell lines. Preclinical data suggest that neratinib will have antitumor activity in 
ERBB1- and/or ERBB2-expressing carcinoma cell lines, with cellular IC 50 <100 nM (Rabindran 
e
t al, 2004).  
Neratinib may have advantages over other HER2 inhibitors due to its ability to irreversibly 
inhibit both HER1 and HER2. Breast cancer cells may become resistant to trastuzumab on the 
basis of extracellular domain truncation of HER2 receptor, which can no longer be recognized by 
the antibody ( Xia et al, 2004 ), or because of coactivation of HER1 signaling ( Rampaul et al, 
2005 ; Zaczek et al, 2005 ). However, since neratinib acts on the intracellular tyrosine kinase 
domain, such cells are likely to maintain sensitivity to neratinib ( Mosesson and Yarden, 2004 ). 
A summary of preclinical studies, human pharmacokinetic studies, and previous clinical studies 
of neratinib for treatment of HER2+ breast cancer are provided in the neratinib Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB). 
2.4.1. S afety Profile of Neratinib in Monotherapy and Combination Therapy Studies  
Safety results from completed and ongoing clinical studies conducted in patients with breast 
cancer or other solid tumors show that neratinib is generally well tolerated with a consistent 
safety profile. Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, account 
for the most-frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events. Fatigue, decreased appetite, 
abdominal pain, headache, rash, and hepatotoxicity (abnormal liver function test) have also been 
reported in patients treated with neratinib. Refer to the neratinib IB Version 5.0 for  more detailed 
information regarding benefits and identified and potential risks for patients, as well as for a 
summary of findings from neratinib nonclinical studies that potentially have clinical significance.  
Refer to Appendix 2 (Dose Adjustment Guidelines) for further information regarding the 
manage
ment of neratinib-related toxicities.  
2.4.2. Diar rhea Prophylaxis in Neratinib Clinical Studies 
Although patients in studies 3144A1-201-WW, 3144A2-3003 -WW, I- SPY2 and early cohorts of 
10-005 received standard-of-care diarrhea management on occurrence of diarrhea, the studies did

2.4.3. P reliminary Clinical Activity of Neratinib 
In Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies as a single agent or in combination with other anti-cancer 
a
gents, neratinib has shown anti-tumor activity in patients with HER2-positive/amplified breast 
cancer ( Awada et al, 2013 ; Burstein et al, 2010; C how et al, 2013 ; Saura et al, 2014 ). Analyses 
of the primary efficacy endpoint (disease-free survival, DFS) data from a randomized Phase 3 
Ex
teNET trial (Extended Adjuvant Treatment with Neratinib [3144A2-3004-WW], Chan et. al., 
2015) showed that neratinib reduced the risk of DFS events by 33% compared with placebo in 
wome
n with HER2-positive locally advanced breast cancer who were treated with neratinib for 
1 year after adjuvant trastuzumab. The one-sided p-value from the stratified log rank test was 
0.005 indi
cating that DFS was significantly prolonged for patients randomized to the neratinib 
arm compared with the placebo arm. Furthermore, neratinib resulted in a statistically significant 
improvement in the secondary efficacy endpoint, DFS including ductal carcinoma in situ (DFS 
DCIS). Neratinib reduced the risk of DFS DCIS events by 37% compared with placebo. The 
one-sided-p value from the stratified log rank test was <0.001 indicating that DFS DCIS was 
significantly prolonged for patients randomized to the neratinib arm compared with the placebo 
arm. 
2.5. Study Rationale 
The results shown in Table 1 and Table 2 suggest that the implementation of the intensive 
diar
rhea management has resulted in a lower incidence of Grade 3 diarrhea. The rationale of this 
study is to collect safety data in patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer who have 
completed a prior course of adjuvant trastuzumab in order to expand the safety profile of 
Neratinib Tablets (PB-272) 25-JUL-2019 
P
rotocol:  PUMA-NER-6201  Amendment 7.1 
Puma Biotechnology Page 25 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL neratinib when given concomitantly with intensive antidiarrheal prophylaxis for 2 cycles. As of 
Ame
ndment 4, starting with the group receiving colestipol, intensive loperamide prophylaxis is 
to be administered for 1 cycle (28 days), and then as needed (PRN) during Cycle 2 and 
thereafter. The duration for the administration of intensive loperamide prophylaxis was changed 
from 2 cycles to 1 cycle (28 days) in Amendment 4 since review of data for the incidence of new 
diarrhea indicated that the majority of episodes occur within the first 28 days of starting neratinib 
treatment. 
In Amendment 5, the study will investigate a bile acid sequestrant (colestipol) given in addition 
to the antidiarrheal medication loperamide, administered on a PRN basis, that may be effective in 
further lowering the incidence of Grade 3 diarrhea. The results will guide how to better manage 
ne
ratinib-related diarrhea in this patient population. 
2.5.1. Ne ratinib Dose Escalation Rationale 
Amendments 6 and 6.1, will investigate the effect on the incidence and severity of diarrhea of a 
lower dose of neratinib starting at 120 mg/day with a dose-escalation regimen. This dose 
escalation scheme is based on (1) a logistic regression model using ExteNET data that suggests 
the odds of having Grade 2 or higher diarrhea increase with increasing average daily dose of 
neratinib; and (2) the observation that Grade 3 diarrhea occurs most frequently in the first month 
after neratinib initiation, suggesting intestinal adaptation to neratinib exposure. By starting 
administration of neratinib at the lower dose of 120 mg in the first week (C1D1 to C1D7), 
followed by 160 mg in Week 2 (C1D8 to C1D14), reaching full treatment dose of 240 mg a t 
W
eek 3 and then thereafter (C1D15 to EOT), patients may experience less early and severe 
episodes of neratinib-associated diarrhea and thereby achieve increased tolerability and 
adherence to neratinib treatment. Starting with Amendment 7, the study will investigate the 
effects of an alternate neratinib dose escalation regimen, starting with the introduction of 160 mg 
neratinib for the first two weeks of treatment.  Subsequently, 200 mg neratinib will start for the 
next two weeks, allowing a stepwise approach that leads to reaching full dose neratinib 240 mg. 
By having a longer duration of 2 weeks at each dose level patients have the opportunity to 
acclimate to neratinib, which may increase tolerability and optimize the management of adverse 
effects. Accumulating data from PUMA-NER-6201 suggest that many patients who remain on 
ne
ratinib therapy through the first month are able to remain on neratinib for the complete one 
year treatment course. Gut bacterial biodiversity will be evaluated from a stool swab at 
Screening, C2D1, and C4D1 and/or at time of treatment discontinuation to assess the effect that 
neratinib has on the microbiome. 
2.5.2.  Results of Preclinical Investigations 
A rat model to investigate neratinib-associated diarrhea was developed and histopathology 
showed infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes in the ileum and colon 
(unpublished data on file). This may suggest an inflammatory process that could be ameliorated 
with anti-inflammatory agents. Ongoing investigations into several interventions are proceeding 
in the rat model. 
2.5.3.  Rationale for use of an Anti-inflammatory Agent 
Budesonide will be investigated in the first pilot cohort as a proof-of-principle for the anti-
inflammatory effect. Budesonide has a high glucocorticosteriod (GCS) activity and substantial 
Neratinib Tablets (PB-272) 25-JUL-2019

Puma Biotechnology Page 26 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL first-pass elimination (Package Insert-Uceris® (budesonide) tablets, Santarus, Inc.). The 
formulation contains budesonide in an extended release tablet core. The tablet core is enteric 
coated to protect dissolution in gastric juice which delays budesonide release until exposure to a 
pH ≥ 7 in the small intestine. Upon disintegration of the coating, the core matrix provides 
extended release of budesonide in a time dependent manner. Budesonide has a high 
glucocorticoid effect and a weak mineralocorticoid effect.  
2.5.4. Rat ionale for Use of a Bile Acid Sequestrant 
The bile acid sequestrant colestipol is a lipid lowering agent for oral use, that binds bile acids in 
the intestine forming a complex that is excreted in the feces ( Package Insert-Colestid® 
[colestipol], Pfizer ). This non-systemic action results in a partial removal of bile acids from 
enterohepatic circulation, preventing their reabsorption. The formation of this complex may 
counteract neratinib induced diarrhea by slowing gastrointestinal transit time and by attenuating 
the possible irritant effect of bile acids on inflamed gastrointestinal lumen. Constipation is the 
major single adverse effect of colestipol and most instances are mild and transient. In animal 
model studies investigating neratinib induced diarrhea, initial observations suggest that there is a 
reduction in severe diarrhea when rats were administered a bile acid sequestrant during neratinib 
administration. 
2.5.5. E nrollment 
The projected numbers for enrollment have increased as of Amendment 5. The planned number 
had been 40 patients per additional cohort. Amendment 3 over-enrolled patients due to plans for 
continued investigation to a total of 64 patients. Amendment 4 over-enrolled, exceeding 40 
patients to finally include a total of 136 patients. Amendment 5 though originally planned to  
include 64 patients enrolled 104 patients. Amendment 6 and Amendment 6.1 are currently 
enrolling patients and are projected to enroll approximately 64 patients. Amendment 7 and 
Amendment 7.1 are planned to enroll approximately 100 additional patients. Cohorts will 
continue to enroll without interruption, in sequence. Thus enrollment may exceed initial 
projections.

This is an open-label, Phase 2 study that will investigate the incidence of diarrhea in HER2+ 
br
east cancer patients receiving neratinib with intensive loperamide diarrhea prophylaxis, with 
and without an anti-inflammatory treatment or a bile acid sequestrant treatment and who have 
previously completed trastuzumab therapy in the adjuvant setting.  
Patients will receive:  
 Ne ratinib 240 mg orally once daily with food for thirteen (13) 28-day cycles.  
 L operamide daily for two (2) 28-day cycles and then as needed. 
 F or patients enrolled under Amendment 3, an anti-inflammatory treatment for 1 cycle 
and loperamide to be administered daily for two (2) 28-day cycles and then as 
needed, thereafter; 
 F or patients enrolled under Amendment 4, colestipol for 1 cycle and loperamide to be 
administered 1 cycle and then as needed, thereafter; 
 F or patients enrolled under Amendment 5, colestipol for 1 cycle and loperamide to be 
administered on an as-needed basis only. 
 F or patients enrolled under Amendments 6 and 6.1, 120 mg neratinib for Week 1 
(C1D1 – C1D7), followed by 160 mg neratinib starting for Week 2 (C1D8 – C1D14), 
followe
d by 240 mg neratinib starting at Week 3 and thereafter (C1D15 to EOT). 
Loperamide will be administered on an as-needed basis only. 
 F or patients enrolled starting with Amendment 7, 160 mg neratinib for the first 
2 weeks  (C1D1 – C1D14), followed by 200 mg neratinib for the next 2 weeks 
(C1D15 
– C1D28), followed by 240 mg neratinib thereafter (C2D1 to End-of-
tre
atment [EOT]). Loperamide will be administered on an as-needed basis only. 
Following a 28-day screening period ( Section 9.1), eligible patients will be enrolled. Baseline 
a
ssessments will be performed prior to Cycle 1/Day 1 dosing. Patients will then participate in the 
a
ctive treatment phase, consisting of thirteen (13) 28-day treatment cycles ( Section 9.2). 
Ne
ratinib and loperamide will be administered orally by patients as described in Section 6. 
Ne
ratinib is to be taken continuously, in 28-day cycles, with no rest between cycles.  
The effect of the anti-inflammatory treatment, budesonide and the bile acid sequestrant colestipol 
on the incidence, severity, and duration of diarrhea will be investigated in sequential patient 
cohorts using a sample size of approximately 64 patients per cohort ( Figure 1). The 
a
nti-inflammatory cohort added in Amendment 3 will be assigned to receive budesonide tablets 
9 mg once daily with or without food for 28 days along with neratinib 240 mg/day (13 cycles) 
a
nd intensive loperamide prophylaxis that will continue through the first 2 cycles (total 56 days), 
and on an as-needed basis thereafter.  
Following the planned completion of enrollment of the 40 patients receiving budesonide, 
neratinib, and intensive loperamide prophylaxis (final enrollment was 64 patients), the next

28 days, to be given at least 2 hours after, but at least 4 hours before,  neratinib 240 mg/day 
(13
 cycles) and intensive loperamide prophylaxis. For this cohort, intensive loperamide 
pr
ophylaxis will continue only through the first cycle (28 days); for Cycle 2 and beyond, 
loperamide may be administered as needed (PRN).  
Following complete enrollment of the cohort treated with colestipol and intensive loperamide 
prophylaxis, all patients in the next cohort (approximately 64) will be evaluated after receiving 
colestipol and neratinib with loperamide administered on a PRN basis only. (Note: For 
Amendment 5 and Amendment 6, enrollment into the budesonide cohort and the first colestipol 
c
ohort is complete and the administration of mandatory loperamide prophylaxis is now also 
complete). 
Patients enrolled under Amendment 6/6.1 will be evaluated after receiving neratinib 
administered according to the following dose-escalation scheme: 120 mg neratinib for Week 1 
(C1D1 – C1D7), followed by 160 mg neratinib starting at Week 2 (C1D8 – C1D14), followed by 
240 mg
 neratinib starting at Week 3 and thereafter (C1D15 to EOT). Loperamide is to be 
administered on a PRN basis only.  
Following complete enrollment of all patients in the 120 mg/160 mg/240 mg dose-escalation 
scheme, patients enrolled under Amendment 7/7.1 will be evaluated after receiving neratinib 
a
dministered according to a second dose escalation scheme: 160 mg neratinib to be taken for the 
first 2 weeks (C1D1 – C1D14), followed by 200 mg neratinib to be taken for the next 2 weeks 
(C1D15 
– C1D28), followed by 240 mg neratinib daily dose taken thereafter (C2D1 to EOT). 
L
operamide is to be administered on a PRN basis only. 
The Sponsor will regularly review accumulating safety data (by individual subject and in 
aggregate). Early termination of a cohort or the study may be permitted if data indicate that 
anti-diarrheal treatment is ineffective. 
Patients in all treatment groups will continue to complete the remaining 12 treatment cycles. 
Ana
lyses are further described in Section 12.4.1. Cohorts will continue to enroll without 
int
erruption, in sequence. Thus enrollment may exceed initial projections.

P
atients may be discontinued from investigational product or from the study, as described in 
Section 10 and Section 11 .  
The primary endpoint of the study is the incidence of Grade 3 or higher diarrhea. Secondary 
endpoints include the frequency distribution of the maximum grade incidence of diarrhea over 
time, the incidence and severity of diarrhea by anti-diarrheal treatment exposure; and the 
incidence of SAEs and AESIs. Additional exploratory endpoints consisting of patient-reported 
health outcomes and biomarkers of disease recurrence will be evaluated (for patients enrolled 
starting with Amendment 2). 
An interim analysis is planned when approximately 120 enrolled under the Original Protocol, 
Ame

loper
amide prophylaxis. The analysis will only include those 120 patients enrolled under the 
Original Protocol, Amendment 1, and Amendment 2. Other additional analyses by cohort may be 
carried out as required ( S ection 12.5). The final analysis is planned when all patients have either

450 a
dditional patients will be enrolled at approximately 74 centers. The approximate total 
enrollment will be 750 patients total.   
Patients are anticipated to participate in the study for approximately 1 year. This includes 
1 month for screening, approximately 12 months for the active treatment phase, and safety 
follow

I
NFLAMMATORY, AND BILE ACID SEQUESTRANT 
TREATMENTS  
6.1. Neratinib  
Neratinib will be supplied as 40-mg, film-coated tablets packaged in bottles with desiccant.  
Neratinib (240 mg; provided as six 40-mg tablets) will be self-administered orally by patients on 
a daily b
asis, starting with Cycle 1/Day 1. Neratinib must be taken with food, preferably in the 
morning
; however, neratinib may be taken in the evening. Neratinib will be given continuously 
for one year (364 days) in thirteen (13) 28-day cycles, with no rest between cycles. Patients 
enrolled under Amendment 6 and Amendment 6.1 will receive neratinib at a starting dose of 
120 mg/day with dose escalation (ie, total dose 120 mg daily for Week 1, 160 mg daily for the 
W
eek 2, and 240 mg daily for Week 3 and thereafter, until EOT). Patients enrolled starting with 
Ame
ndment 7 will receive neratinib 160 mg neratinib for the first 2 weeks (C1D1 – C1D14), 
followe
d by 200 mg neratinib for the next 2 weeks (C1D15 – C1D28), followed by 240 mg 
ne
ratinib thereafter (C2D1 to EOT). Daily dosing should continue until a criterion for treatment 
withdrawal is met (see  Section 10).  
F
or patients starting with Amendment 7, patients must use a diary to record intake of neratinib 
for every cycle (see Section 8.5.2).  
6.1.1. Ne ratinib Dose Adjustment 
Neratinib dose adjustment and/or discontinuation and/or management of toxicity should be 
performed according to Appendix 2 and Section 10.1 .  
F
or patients enrolled under the dose-escalation schemes of Amendment 6/6.1, Amendment 7/7.1, 
during
 the dose escalation phase ( 240 mg neratinib), for any patient who experiences Grade ≥ 2 
AE(s) leading to neratinib dose interruption which do not resolve to Grade ≤ 1, a review of the 
pa
tient and the patient’s adverse event profile must occur with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor to 
determine whether the patient should be allowed to continue in the study. 
Recommended dose reductions for the -1 and -2 dose levels of neratinib are listed in Table 3.

Puma Biotechnology Page 37 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL If doses of neratinib are held, study procedures for that cycle will proceed on schedule as 
planned, without any delay. Missed dose(s) of neratinib (ie, any dose that is not administered 
within the protocol-defined administration window) will not be made up. Note: Patients should 
take one dose per calendar day.  The dose adjustment guidelines represent the minimum set of 
measures the Investigator must follow. However, additional measures may be taken, as 
necessary, for certain patients per the Investigator’s medical judgment. All dose 
modifications/adjustments should be documented in the patient’s source file. 
Once the neratinib dose has been reduced for a patient, all subsequent cycles must be 
administered at that dose, unless further dose reduction is required. Dose re-escalation will only 
be permitted if explicitly approved in advance by the Sponsor. Evidence of this approval must be 
contained within the patient’s source file.  
Patients must discontinue the investigational product if a criterion for withdrawal is met (see 
Section 10.1).  
R
eintroduction of the discontinued investigational product at a later time during the active 
treatment phase is not permitted. 
Detailed rules for dose adjustments of neratinib in case of toxicity, including the dose levels to 
which the investigational product should be adjusted, are provided in Appendix 2.

Patients are expected to take loperamide prophylaxis as directed. However, patients may require 
individualization of loperamide prophylaxis dose with the goal of titrating to 1-2 bowel 
movements a day.  
 F or patients who develop diarrhea during Cycles 1-2, loperamide should be increased 
up to a maximum of 16 mg a day (or during Cycle 1 or after, for patients enrolled 
under Amendment 4; thereafter, loperamide may be administered up to 16 mg per 
day, as described above in Section 6.2).  
 I f a patient is unable to tolerate loperamide due to symptomatic constipation, 
loperamide should be held until after the first bowel movement and then resumed at a 
dose reduced by one level.  
 For recurrent symptomatic constipation events, hold loperamide until after the first 
bowel movement and then resume at a dose reduced to the next lower dose level.  
 I f a patient is unable to tolerate once-daily loperamide due to constipation, hold 
loperamide and discuss subsequent loperamide dosing with the Medical Monitor.  
 Ne ratinib dosing should continue if loperamide is held.

6.3. Budesonide 
For patients enrolled under Amendment 3 and who participate in the initial cohort that will 
evaluate budesonide, patients will self-administer oral budesonide at a dose of 9 mg once daily 
with or without
 food, for the first treatment cycle (28 days), to be taken with neratinib and 
intensive loperamide prophylaxis ( Table 6). If a patient experiences an intolerable Grade 2 or 
hig
her AE deemed related to budesonide, dosing of budesonide should be held until the AE 
resolves to Grade 1 or lower and then restarting dosing will be considered. Neratinib and 
loperamide should be continued while budesonide dosing is being held. If the intolerable AE 
recurs, budesonide dosing should be discontinued and neratinib and loperamide continued.

6.6. Drug Accountability and Treatment Compliance* 
The study site must maintain accurate records documenting dates and quantities of 
investigational product: neratinib, loperamide, budesonide, and colestipol received from the 
S
ponsor. Records must also be maintained documenting dates and quantities (ie, pill counts) of 
neratinib, loperamide, budesonide and colestipol received, dispensed (per-patient), and returned 
(per-patient). Such documentation should permit a running log of the receipt and per-patient 
disposition of all investigational products on site. Any investigational products, neratinib, 
loper
amide, anti-inflammatory, or bile acid sequestrant treatments accidentally or deliberately 
de
stroyed must also be documented.  
Throughout the study, reconciliation will be made between the amounts of investigational 
product: neratinib, loperamide, anti-inflammatory, and bile acid sequestrant treatments supplied, 
dispensed, returned, and subsequently destroyed or returned to the Sponsor. All investigational 
products, neratinib, loperamide, anti-inflammatory, and bile acid sequestrant treatments will be 
returned to Sponsor or its representative, or destroyed at the site in accordance with local 
standard operating procedures, as specified in writing by the Sponsor. 
Individual patient dosing compliance should be reviewed and documented at each study visit by 
study site staff. If patient non-compliance is noted, the patient should be re-instructed regarding 
pr
oper dosing procedures in order to continue in the study. If repeated non-compliance is noted, 
additional steps may be taken, including withdrawal of the patient from the study (see 
Section 10.2).

All concomitant medications and concomitant nonpharmacological treatments/therapies will be 
recorded from 30 days prior to the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until the Safety 
F
ollow-up Visit occurring 28 days after the last dose of neratinib. This will include the start date, 
stop d
ate, generic name, route of administration, dose and indication for treatment.  
At screening, patients will be asked what medications they have taken during the previous 
30 days, which medications are ongoing at the time of screening, any medical conditions that 
require medication, and all prior cancer therapies. At each subsequent study visit, patients will be 
asked what concomitant medications they are currently taking.  
7.1. Permitted Concomitant Treatment 
Any palliative and/or supportive care for cancer-related symptoms, which are not otherwise 
specified in the list of prohibited medications ( S ection 7.5), or drugs with potential for drug-drug 
int
eractions ( Section 7.6), or in the associated Appendices ( App endix 4, Append ix 5,  
Appe
ndix 6,  Appendix 9, and Appendix 10), including hormonal therapy (eg, tamoxifen, 
a
romatase inhibitors) is permitted at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Specifically, the following treatments are permitted during the study:  
 Standard therapies for preexisting medical conditions and for medical and/or surgical 
complications. All medication(s) as well as dose and length of therapy should be 
recorded in the case report form (CRF). 
 Adjuva nt endocrine therapy is allowed for hormone receptor-positive disease. 
 B isphosphonates and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors 
(e
g, denosumab), are allowed regardless of indication. 
7.2. Required Loperamide Antidiarrheal Therapy  
Diarrhea is the major dose-limiting toxicity of neratinib with onset typically occurring early in 
the course of treatment (during the first few weeks of treatment). Prior to Amendment 5, primary 
prophylactic use of antidiarrheal medication was m andatory  for all enrolled patients taking 
neratinib; starting with Amendment 5, and continuing in Amendment 6, Amendment 6.1, 
Amendment 7, and Amendment 7.1 primary prophylactic use of loperamide is no longer 
required.  
As noted in Section 6.2, loperamide is the recommended standard therapy to treat diarrhea in this 
stud
y, and it is provided to the sites by the Sponsor. If alternative antidiarrheal medication is 
proposed, this should be discussed with the Medical Monitor and the reason documented in the 
source documents. Second-line antidiarrheal treatments and adjunctive therapies (eg, octreotide 
[SANDOSTATIN®] (or equivalent as approved by the Sponsor) are also recommended for use 
when appropriate. 
The Investigator must review with the patient the Patient Instructions  for the management of 
diar
rhea and the Patient Diary  used by the patient to record daily the number of stools, use of 
loper
amide and/or other an ti-diarrheals, and the use of investigational product for the first 2

umentation of any occurrences of loose stools or diarrhea must be as precise as possible and 
captured in the Patient Diary. For AE recording, documentation of “Intermittent” events of 
diarrhea is limited to Grade 1. If events of Grade 1 diarrhea are separated by 3 days without any 
diar
rhea, then each event must be documented as separate AEs with corresponding start and stop 
dates.  
The entries on the Patient Diary should be reviewed together with the patient. If the patient has 
experienced diarrhea since the last visit, details of the daily number of unformed stools provided 
on the diary help to grade the diarrhea as precisely as possible (per NCI CTCAE v.4.0). Also, the 
daily dose of loperamide (or other antidiarrheals, if applicable) noted on the diary will be 
reviewed and recorded on the CRF. 
Loperamide (along with neratinib) will be dispensed directly by the site on or before 
Cycle 1/Day 1 and during subsequent visits as needed. It is very important to initiate treatment 
with loperamide
 concomitantly with the first dose of neratinib to minimize occurrence and 
severity of diarrhea.  
Intensive Prophylactic dosing instructions (patients enrolled in Amendment 1 to 
Amendment 4)  
 Inform patients that they will experience diarrhea while taking neratinib. 
 Admini ster loperamide:  
 For the first 14 days, loperamide 4 mg (2 tablets/capsules) will be 
se
lf-administered orally by patients three times a day (total 12 mg a day). The 
ini
tial dose of loperamide 4 mg will be self-administered orally with the first dose 
of
 neratinib.  
 After the first 14 days, loperamide 4 mg (2 tablets/capsules) will be 
se
lf-administered orally twice a day (total 8 mg a day) through the first 2 cycles of 
ther
apy (Day 56) from start of neratinib dosing.  
o F or patients in the treatment group receiving colestipol under Amendment 4, 
this regimen would be for the rest of the first cycle of therapy [Day 28], from 
the start of neratinib dosing.  
 Patients enrolled under the Original Protocol can maintain the loperamide 
prophylaxis dose already initiated with a goal of titrating to 1-2 bowel movements 
a day. 
 Thereafter, loperamide will be administered as needed (not to exceed 16 mg per 
da
y)  (during Cycle 2 and beyond for patients in the treatment group receiving 
colestipol under Amendment 4).

Dietetic measures (same as above) 
Pharmacologic treatment 
 Administer loperamide: initial dose of 4 mg (2 tablets/capsules) with the first bout of 
diar
rhea followed by 2 mg (1 tablet/capsule) every 4 hours or after every unformed 
stool
 (maximum 16 mg a day) and continue loperamide at this frequency until

(25-50 µg/h) if dehydration is severe, with dose escalation up to 500 µg SC TID]. 
 Use  IV fluids as appropriate. 
 C onsider prophylactic antibiotics as needed (eg, fluoroquinolones) especially if 
diarrhea is persistent beyond 24 hours or there is fever or Grade 3-4 neutropenia. 
The
 Investigator or designee should contact the Sponsor or the Medical Monitor for advice if at 
any time there is a concern for the appropriate course of action for the management of diarrhea. 
Stool cultures should be done to exclude infectious causes of Grade 3 or Grade 4 diarrhea or 
diar
rhea of any grade with complicating features (dehydration, fever, and/or Grade 3 or Grade 4 
ne
utropenia) per the Investigator’s discretion. Results from occult blood, fecal leukocyte stain, 
Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter, Salmonella , and Shigella  testing, when performed, should 
be
 reported using the appropriate CRF. Colonoscopy with biopsy should be strongly considered 
for
 patients who have significant diarrhea. Results for appearance, histology, pathology, and 
cultures performed should be reported using the appropriate CRF. 
Patients with significant diarrhea who are unresponsive to medical treatment may require 
treatment interruption or dose reduction.  
7.3. Anti-inflammatory Treatment 
For patients enrolled under Amendment 3, the effect of an anti-inflammatory treatment, 
specifically budesonide, will be tested to determine the effect on the incidence, severity, and 
duration of diarrhea. 
Following the completion of Cycle 1 by the first approximately 64 patients in the first treatment 
cohort who receive neratinib and intensive loperamide prophylaxis plus budesonide anti-
inflammatory treatment, the treatment cohort will be evaluated. The Sponsor will regularly 
review accumulating safety data (by individual subject and in aggregate). Early termination of a 
treatment cohort or the study may be permitted if data indicate that anti-inflammatory treatment 
is ineffective. Once enrollment in the cohort testing budesonide is complete, the next cohort will 
begin enrollment, to evaluate the bile acid sequestrant colestipol.  
The Patient Diary will be used by patients to record the daily use of budesonide  treatment. Also, 
the daily dose of the anti-inflammatory treatment noted on the diary will be reviewed and 
recorded on the CRF.

minimize the occurrence and severity of diarrhea. 
Anti-inflammatory dosing instructions:  
 B udesonide  
 For the first treatment cycle, budesonide will be self-administered orally by 
patients at a dose of 9 mg once daily either with or without food, for the first 
treatment cycle, and to be taken with neratinib and loperamide on the intensive 
prophylaxis schedule. Budesonide should be swallowed whole and not chewed, 
crushed or broken.  
7.4. C olestipol (Amendment 4 and Amendment 5)  
For patients enrolled under Amendment 4 and Amendment 5, the effect of the bile acid 
sequestrant, colestipol, on the incidence, severity, and duration of diarrhea will be investigated in 
a treatment cohort of 40 patients. 
Following the completion of Cycle 1 by the first approximately 40 patients in the first cohort 
who receive neratinib and intensive loperamide prophylaxis plus budesonide, patients in the next 
cohort will receive colestipol 2 g, twice daily, for 28 days. The Sponsor will regularly review 
accumulating safety data (by individual patient and in aggregate). Early termination of a cohort 
or the study may be permitted if data indicate that bile acid sequestrant treatment is ineffective 
for the treatment of diarrhea. 
The Patient Diary will be used by patients to record daily the use of colestipol. Also, the daily 
dose of colestipol noted on the diary will be reviewed and recorded onto the CRF. 
Colestipol (along with neratinib and loperamide) will be dispensed directly by the site on or 
before Cycle 1/Day 1 and during subsequent visits as needed. It is important to initiate treatment 
with t
he colestipol concomitantly with the first dose of neratinib to minimize the occurrence and 
severity of diarrhea. 
7.5. Prohibited Concomitant Treatment 
The following treatments are prohibited throughout the duration of the active (treatment) 
stage/phase of the study:  
 Any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy (including palliative radiotherapy), 
surgery related to cancer, anticancer immunotherapy, or other anticancer treatments, 
except hormonal therapy (eg, tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors), including other 
investigational agents.   
 Systemic steroid use, by oral or parenteral route.

Puma Biotechnology Page 49 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL 7.6. Potential for Drug-Drug Interactions 
7.6.1. P otential Drug-Drug Interactions with Neratinib 
Patients should avoid agents known to be strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inducers or 
inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole) for the duration of the active stage/phase of the study. Patients 
should also avoid grapefruit/grapefruit juice and herbal remedies, including St John's Wort. 
Refer to Appendix 4 for a list of inhibitors and inducers of CYP isoenzymes. If unavoidable, 
patie
nts taking such agents should be monitored closely. 
Patients using drugs known to cause QT/QTc prolongation should be monitored closely with 
serial electrocardiograms (ECG) at the Investigator’s discretion. Refer to Appendix 6 for a 
summary of drugs known to have a risk of causing QT/QTc prolongation, potentially causing 
Torsades de Pointes (TdP). 
Patients taking digoxin, a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate with a narrow therapeutic window, 
should be monitored closely. The digoxin dose should be adjusted as needed, since neratinib is 
an inhibitor of P-gp. Co-administration of neratinib with digoxin could result in increased 
digoxin levels and associated digoxin toxicity. Refer to Appendix 5 for a list of substrates and 
inhi
bitors of P-gp. 
Patients taking oral coumarin-derivative anticoagulants (ie, warfarin and phenprocoumon) should 
be monitored closely and their anticoagulant dose adjusted as needed. 
The solubility of neratinib is pH dependent and treatments that alter gastrointestinal pH such as 
proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2-receptor antagonists, and antacids may lower the solubility of 
neratinib. It has been observed that a single 240-mg dose of neratinib combined with 
lansoprazole may decrease neratinib AUC by up to 70%. It is unknown whether separating PPI 
and neratinib doses reduce the interaction. If an H2-receptor antagonist such as ranitidine is 
required, neratinib should be taken at least 2 hours before the next dose of the H2-receptor 
antagonist and 10 hours after the H2-receptor antagonist dosing. If antacids are necessary, the 
antacid dose and the neratinib dose should be separated by 3 hours. 
7.6.2. P otential for Drug-Drug Interactions with Budesonide 
For patients participating in Amendment 3, when taking budesonide with neratinib and 
loperamide during the first 28 days (Cycle 1) there should be close monitoring during the 
concomitant administration with ketoconazole (and itraconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, or 
erythromycin), or any other CYP3A4 inhibitor for increased signs and/or symptoms of 
hypercorticism. Refer to Appendix 9 for contraindications, warnings, and precautions for 
bude
sonide. 
Avoid grapefruit juice, which is a known CYP3A4 inhibitor.  
Since the dissolution of the coating of budesonide is pH dependent, the release properties and 
uptake of the compound may be altered when budesonide is used after treatment with gastric 
acid reducing agents (PPI's, H2-receptor antagonists and antacids).

P
rotocol:  PUMA-NER-6201  Amendment 7.1 
Puma Biotechnology Page 50 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL 7.6.3.  Potential for Drug-Drug Interactions with Colestipol 
For patients participating in Amendment 4, when taking colestipol with neratinib and lopermide 
during the first 28 days (Cycle 1), there should be attention to the time interval between the 
administration of colestipol tablets and any other medication. The interval for colestipol 
administration should be as long as possible from other concomitant medication. Patients should 
take other drugs at least one hour before or four hours after colestipol to avoid impeding their 
administration. Since colestipol is an anion exchange resin, this effect may be related to a strong 
a
ffinity for anions other than the bile acids. In vitro studies have indicated that colestipol binds a 
number of drugs.  
Repeated doses of colestipol given prior to a single dose of propranolol in human trials have 
been reported to decrease propranolol absorption. Patients on propranolol and possibly other 
beta-blockers should be monitored when colestipol is added or deleted from the therapeutic 
regimen.  Effects of the absorption of other beta-blockers have not been determined.  
Studies in humans show that the absorption of chorothiazide as reflected in urinary excretion is 
markedly decreased even when administered one hour before colestipol. The absorption of 
tetracycline, furosemide, penicillin G, hydrochlorothiazide, and gemfibrozil was significantly 
decreased when given simultaneously with colestipol. These drugs were not tested to determine 
the effect of administration one hour before colestipol.   
No lowering effect on blood levels in humans was noted when colestipol was administered with 
any of the following drugs: aspirin, clindamycin, clofibrate, methyldopa, nicotinic acid (niacin), 
tolbutamide, phenytoin or warfarin. Particular caution should be observed with digoxin 
preparations since ther are conflicting results for the effect of colestipol on the availability of 
dig
oxin and digitoxin. The potential for binding of these drugs if given concomitantly is present. 
Discontinuing colestipol could pose a hazard to health if a potentially toxic drug that is 
significantly bound to the resin has been titrated to a maintenance level while the patient was 
taking colestipol.   
Bile acid bind resins such as coletipol may also interfere with the absorption of oral phosphate 
supplements and hydrocortisone.  
A study has shown that cholestyramine binds bile acids and reduces mycophenolic acid 
exposure. As colestipol also binds bile acids, colestipol may reduce mycophenolic acid exposure 
and potentially reduce efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil.   
Refer to Appendix 10 for contraindications, warnings, and precautions for colestipol.

8.2. Safety Assessments 
8.2.1. Clin ical Endpoints and Definitions 
Safety Endpoints: 
 The primary endpoint of the study is the incidence of Grade 3 diarrhea in patients 
with early-stage HER2+ breast cancer.  
 S econdary safety endpoints include the frequency distribution of the maximum grade 
incidence of diarrhea, the incidence and severity of diarrhea by loperamide exposure, 
with and without anti-inflammatory treatment; and the incidence of SAEs and AESIs.  
Refer to the Schedule of Procedures ( Appendix 1) for time points. The following safety 
e
ndpoints will be assessed: medical history, AEs, vital signs, detailed/brief (symptom-guided) 
physical examinations, 12-lead ECGs, LVEF (ECHO or MUGA), and laboratory evaluations. 
AEs and AESIs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE, version 4.0. Serious AEs and 
AESIs will be reported until 28 days after the last dose of the investigational product and will be 
followed until resolution. Should an Investigator be made aware of any SAEs occurring any time 
after the reporting period that may be causally related to neratinib’s administration, it should be 
promptly reported. More details on AEs can be found in Section 13. 
F
or patients starting with Amendment 6.1, the diary used for recording of investigational product 
intake will also be used by patients to document any other study treatment for the first 2 cycles 
(56 days) of the study (see Section 8.5.2 ). In case of diarrhea, it also serves to document the 
number of loose stools per day and use of loperamide/other antidiarrheal treatments taken. 
8.2.2. L aboratory Assessments 
Laboratory testing will be performed in accordance with the Schedule  of Procedures 
(Appe
ndix 1).  
The
 institutional laboratory will analyze all hematology and routine blood chemistry samples 
collected. Samples will be analyzed at a facility meeting Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 
requirements and using methods documented in a methods validation report.

investigational site for patient safety monitoring, and documentation stored with the source 
documents. 
8.2.6. L eft Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) 
MUGA scan or ECHO scans to determine LVEF will be performed in accordance with the 
Schedule of Procedures ( Appendix 1), ie, within 4 weeks before Day 1 of Cycle 1 and at EOT, 
Cycle 13/Day 28.  It is strongly recommended to use the same method of measurement for the 
same patient throughout the duration of the study. 
8.3. Other Study Assessments 
Assessments for health outcomes and biomarkers will only be collected for patients enrolled 
starting with Amendment 2.  
8.3.1.  Health Outcomes Assessments 
The exploratory endpoint of patient-reported health outcomes will be assessed by the EuroQol 
EQ-5D-5L and by the FACT-B questionnaires (for patients enrolled starting with Amendment 2) 
a
nd the RSCL (for patients enrolled starting with Amendment 6.1). 
Health outcomes will be assessed by patient-reported responses to the EQ-5D-5L multi- 
dimensional health status questionnaire ( Appendix 7 ) a nd by the FACT-B ( Appendix 8), and by 
the RSCL (Appendix 11). These assessments will be administered in accordance with the 
Schedule of Procedures ( Appendix 1).  
The
 patient-reported assessments are for the purpose of exploring the subject’s own perceptions 
about their symptoms and health-related quality of life and thus a proxy (ie, a caregiver or study 
personnel) should not complete the questionnaires. Additionally, the investigator must not 
influence the subject’s assessments. Every effort should be made to maintain an unbiased 
assessment. Questionnaires should be administered before any other study procedures on the day 
of the study visit. If questionnaires can only be completed after the study visit, they should be 
administered no later than 5 days from the visit. Both assessments need to be completed on the 
same day. On the day of treatment discontinuation, it is acceptable for questionnaires to be

Puma Biotechnology Page 54 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL performed after study procedures. If assessments were completed within the previous 7 days at a 
regularly scheduled visit, assessments do not need to be administered at the EOT visit. 
EQ-5D-5L: 
The EQ - 5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of general health states 
preferences and provides a simple descriptive profile and index value for health status and 
measures 5 dimensions of health including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
a
nxiety, and general health is measured via a vertical visual analog scale. Applicable to a wide 
range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single 
index value for health status. 
FACT- B: 
The FACT-B (version 4) is a 37-item questionnaire with 5 subscales assessing physical, social, 
e
motional, and functional well-being and additional concerns more specific to women with 
breast cancer. Subjects will be asked to indicate how true a statement had been for them over the 
past 7 days using a 5-point scale as follows: 0, not at all; 1, a little bit; 2, somewhat; 3, quite a 
bit; and 4, very much. All items receive equal weighting. 
Rotterdam Symptom Checklist: 
The RSCL measures both physical and psychological aspects of quality of life (QOL) in cancer 
patients. The instrument assesses symptom-related distress among patients for physical 
symptoms, psychological symptoms, and activities of daily living. The 3 domains are assessed in 
a 4-point scale (not at all, a little, quite a bit, very much) for 38 items. Patients are asked to 
indi
cate the degree to which they have been bothered by the indicated symptoms in the past 
week. 
8.3.2. B iomarkers 
The exploratory endpoint of disease biomarkers will consist of biomarkers of disease recurrence 
(for patients enrolled starting with Amendment 2). 
cfDNA will be obtained from plasma samples collected several times during the study and at 
disease recurrence (if applicable), in accordance with the Schedule of Procedures ( Appendix 1). 
c
fDNA will undergo molecular profiling to identify biomarkers of disease recurrence 
8.3.3. Disea se Recurrence 
Clinical documentation of recurrence, including recurrence site, radiographic, and/or pathologic 
procedures will be collected at end-of-treatment. 
8.3.4. M icrobiome Evaluation (for patients enrolled starting with Amendment 6) 
At select study centers, a stool swab will be collected at Screening, C2D1, and C4D1 and/or at 
time of treatment discontinuation if earlier than C4D1 for possible future assessments of 
microbiome to assess the effect that neratinib has on the microbiome.

Protocol deviations should be reported to the Sponsor (or designee) as they occur or are 
discovered and should be captured in CRFs at the time of monitoring and medical review of data 
line listings. 
8.5. Study Drug Accountability/Patient Diary  
8.5.1. S tudy Medication Accountability  
The study site must maintain accurate records documenting dates and quantities of medicinal 
product received from the Sponsor. On a per patient basis, records must be maintained 
documenting dates and quantities of medicinal product dispensed and returned at each study 
visit. Any medicinal product accidentally or deliberately destroyed must be documented. 
Throughout the study, reconciliation will be made between the amount of medicinal product 
supplied, dispensed, returned, and subsequently destroyed or returned to Sponsor. All medicinal 
products will be returned to Sponsor or its representative, or destroyed at the site in accordance 
with local standard operating procedures (SOPs), as specified in writing by the Sponsor.  
8.5.2. P atient Diary  
A patient diary will be provided by the Investigator for the patient to record daily study 
medication intake for every cycle. The number of stools per day and the use of antidiarrheal 
treatment will also be required to be recorded in the patient diary during the first 2 treatment 
cycles.  
Individual patient dosing compliance should be reviewed at each study visit by study site staff. If 
patient non-compliance is noted, the patient should be re-instructed regarding proper dosing 
procedures in order to continue in the study. If repeated non-compliance is noted, additional 
steps may be taken, including withdrawal of the patient from the study.  
For the first 2 cycles, eDiaries will be implemented, either hand-held or web-based, to collect the 
number of daily bowel movements, neratinib self-administration (number of tablets taken), and 
anti-diarrheal intake (number of loperamide capsules or tablets, and as applicable, the number of 
doses of other anti-diarrheal medications). If the use of an eDiary, either hand-held or web-
ba
sed, is not feasible, the alternative of a paper diary will be considered on a case- by-case basis.  
After 2 cycles, the hand-held or web-based diary will continue to be available to patients, or 
alternatively, they may switch to a paper diary to be completed on a daily basis and returned to 
the clinic (site) for review and evaluation at scheduled study visits.

.2. Active Treatment Phase 
Neratinib will be self-administered by patients daily during each 28-day cycle.  
F
or patients enrolled under Amendment 3, the anti-inflammatory treatment budesonide will be 
administered for 1 cycle during Cycle 1 for patients in this treatment cohort. For patients enrolled 
under Amendment 4, colestipol will be administered for 1 cycle during Cycle 1 (colestipol + 
intensive loperamide prophylaxis), and colestipol will also be administered for patients enrolled 
under Amendment 5 (colestipol + PRN loperamide). All patients enrolled under Amendment 6 
and  Amendment 6.1 will be evaluated after receiving neratinib administered according to the 
following dose-escalation scheme: 120 mg neratinib for Week 1 (C1D1 – C1D7), followed by 
160 mg
 neratinib for Week 2 (C1D8 – C1D14), followed by 240 mg neratinib for Week 3 and 
ther
eafter (C1D15 to EOS). All patients enrolled under Amendment 7 and Amendment 7.1 will 
be evaluated after receiving neratinib administered according to a second dose escalation 
scheme: 160 mg neratinib to be taken for the first 2 weeks (C1D1 – C1D14), followed by 200 
mg
 neratinib to be taken for the next 2 weeks (C1D15 – C1D28), followed by 240 mg neratinib 
da
ily dose taken thereafter (C2D1 to EOT). Loperamide is to be administered on a PRN basis 
only. For both dose escalation regimens, the Investigator or research staff must call patients at 
the end of the first and second weeks of treatment (ie, Day 7 or Day 8, and Day 14 or Day 15) to 
confirm that the patient has increased the dose of neratinib from 120 mg to 160 mg, and from 
160 mg to 240 mg, respectively. 
The following will be performed in accordance with the Schedule of Procedures ( Appendix 1):

10.1. Investigational Product Discontinuation 
Patients must  be discontinued from in vestigational product  under the following circumstances 
li
sted below and in Appendix 2, unless otherwise agreed with the Medical Monitor: 
 I f the patient requires more than 2 dose reductions of neratinib (see Appendix 2).  
 I f neratinib is withheld due to a AESIs/SAEs for >28 days. Patients who are clinically 
benefiting from therapy with neratinib may be resumed on therapy after 28 days if 
a
pproved in advance by the Sponsor. 
 Disea se recurrence. 
 I nitiation of alternative anti-cancer therapy. Any concurrent chemotherapy, 
radiotherapy (including palliative radiotherapy), surgery related to cancer, anticancer 
immunotherapy, or other anticancer treatments including other investigational agents 
(see Section 7.3).  
 P regnancy (see Section 13.4).  
 I nvestigator request. 
 P atient request (ie, withdrawal of consent for treatment). 
 AEs/tox icity. 
Withdrawal due to AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, and 
recorded on the appropriate AE page of CRF. If a patient withdraws due to toxicity, even if 
discontinuation is not otherwise required per protocol guidelines, the withdrawal should be 
classified as withdrawal due to AE. 
10.2. Withdrawal from the Study 
Patients may withdraw from the entire study including follow up at any time without penalty and 
for any reason without prejudice to his or her future medical care. 
Patients may be required to withdraw from the study after discussion with the Sponsor and/or 
Investigator (whenever possible) for the following reasons: 
 At the disc retion of the Investigator. 
 At pa tient’s request (withdrawal of consent for the study) (se e Section 10.3).  
 L ost to follow-up (defined as after three attempts at contact by phone followed by one 
attempt by sending a certified letter). 
 I f the entire study is terminated prematurely as described in Section 11. 
A pa
tient may also be withdrawn from investigational product/study by the Sponsor, Regulatory 
Authorities, or IRBs/IECs.

Puma Biotechnology Page 61 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL 10.3. Procedures for Investigational Product Discontinuation/Study 
Withdrawal 
When a patient is withdrawn from the study, the Investigator will notify the Sponsor. In all cases, 
the reason(s) for premature discontinuation/withdrawal, and the primary reason, must be 
recorded on the CRF. If a patient is prematurely withdrawn from the investigational product or 
the study for any reason, the Investigator must make every effort to perform the evaluations 
described for the EOT visit (performed within 5 days of the last dose of investigational product 
a
s appropriate). If a patient discontinues due to an AE, he/she should be strongly encouraged to 
undergo the EOT assessments and continue to be under medical supervision until symptoms 
cease or the condition becomes stable. 
If a patient is lost to follow-up, or voluntarily withdraws from study participation, every effort 
should be made to determine why a patient is lost to follow-up or withdraws consent. This 
information, including the date, should also be recorded on the patient's conclusion of patient 
pa
rticipation CRF. 
All patients will remain on active study treatment until a cause of early treatment discontinuation 
occurs; these include disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, and withdrawal of consent 
(Section 10), or until study closure.

The Sponsor may suspend or terminate the study or part of the study at any time for any reason. 
Investigational product will be available to patients to complete the 1-year course of treatment as 
described in Section 4.2. 
If the Investigator suspends or terminates the study, the Investigator will promptly inform the 
Sponsor and the IRB/IEC and provide them with a detailed written explanation. The Investigator 
will also return all investigational products, investigational product containers, and other study 
materials to the Sponsor or have them destroyed locally according to Sponsor guidelines. Upon 
study completion, the Investigator will provide the Sponsor, IRB/IEC, and regulatory agency 
with final reports and summaries as required by regulations. For investigational new drug 
application studies, the Investigator must submit a written report to the Sponsor and the IRB/IEC 
within 3 months after the completion or termination of the study.

The statistical considerations summarized in this section outline the plan for data analysis of this 
study. Before database lock, a separate statistical analysis plan will be finalized, providing 
detailed methods for the analyses outlined below.  
Any deviations from the planned analyses will be described and justified in the final integrated 
study report. 
12.1. General Considerations 
12.1.1. Subgroups/Cohorts 
Unless otherwise specified, all analyses will be done by the following cohorts:  (1) the Original 
Protocol, (2) Amendment 1 or Amendment 2, (3) Amendment 3, (4) Amendment 4, (5) 
Ame
ndment 5, (6) Amendment 6 and Amendment 6.1, or (7) Amendment 7 and Amendment 7.1 
by treatment cohort.  
12.2. Study Patients 
12.2.1. Disposition of Patients 
The number and percentage of patients entering and completing the study will be presented. 
Reasons for withdrawal will also be summarized.  
12.2.2. Demographic Data, Medical History, Baseline Characteristics, and Concomitant 
Medications 
Demographic data, medical history, concomitant disease, and concomitant medication will be 
summarized by means of descriptive statistics for continuous variables (n, mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum and maximum) and frequency tables for categorical variables.  
12.2.3. Treatment Compliance 
Duration of treatment will be summarized. In addition, the cumulative dose, dose intensity 
(quantity per time unit) and the relative dose intensity (dose intensity/scheduled dose per time 
unit) will be summarized. The number of patients with dose holds or dose reductions will be 
tabulated. 
12.3. Efficacy Analyses 
Not applicable for this study.  
12.4. Safety Analysis 
All patients who receive a dose of neratinib will be analyzed for safety.

P
rotocol:  PUMA-NER-6201  Amendment 7.1 
Puma Biotechnology Page 64 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL 12.4.1. Statistical Methods 
The primary endpoint is the incidence of Grade 3 or higher diarrhea. The accompanying 
Clopper-Pearson 2-sided 95% CIs will be computed. The primary endpoint will be estimated for 
the overall safety population and, if needed, for subgroups of patients with specific anti-diarrheal 
prophylaxis regimens per protocol.  
12.4.2. Adverse Events 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities MedDRA coding 
system and all AEs will be graded by the Investigator according to the NCI- CTCAE version 4.0.  
Incidence of AEs will be summarized by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT), and 
will be summarized by grade. A patient who experiences the same AE more than once within a 
SOC or preferred term category will be counted only once, using the worst toxicity grade for that 
event. SAEs and AESIs will also be summarized.  
Serious AE and deaths will be provided in a listing. All AEs resulting in discontinuation, dose 
modification, dosing interruption, and/or treatment delay of investigational product will also be 
listed and tabulated by PT.  
12.4.3. Laboratory Results 
Laboratory test results will be collected pretreatment through 28 days after the last dose of 
investi
gational product. Standard reference ranges will be used for missing or discrepant normal 
ranges. 
Mean change from baseline in laboratory test values at each visit will be provided. On-study 
laboratory test abnormalities will be summarized. Shifts in laboratory test values will also be 
summarized.  
12.5. Exploratory Endpoints Analyses 
Exploratory analyses will be conducted on all patients in the safety population who were enrolled 
starting under Amendment 2. 
12.5.1. Health Outcomes Assessments 
Patient-reported health outcomes data (scores on the EQ-5D-5L, FACT-B, and RSCL 
questionnaires) will be summarized and plotted over time. Analyses will be descriptive only; 
changes from baseline will be provided with both point estimates and CIs. 
12.5.2. Biomarkers Analyses 
Exploratory analyses will be conducted to evaluate the relationship between disease biomarker s 
identified from molecular profiling and indications of clinical disease recurrence. No formal 
statistical analyses are planned, however, of biomarker data.

Results of microbiome evaluation from participating sites, if available, will be summarized at 
baseline, C2D1, C4D1, and/or at time of treatment discontinuation if earlier than C4D1. No 
formal statistical analyses are planned of the microbiome data. 
12.6. Interim Analysis 
An interim analysis is planned when approximately 120 patients enrolled under the Original 
protocol, Amendment 1, and Amendment 2, all patients have completed at least 2 cycles 
(56 days) of neratinib with loperamide prophylaxis. The interim analysis will only include those 
120 pa
tients enrolled under the Original Protocol, Amendment 1, and Amendment 2. Other 
additional analyses by cohort may be carried out as required. 
12.7. Determination of Sample Size 
The first 120 patients will be under the Original Protocol, Amendment 1, and Amendment 2.  
The incidence of Grade 3 or higher diarrhea is assumed to be 15% in this study. A sample size of 
120 patients will ensure that the width of the 95% Clopper-Pearson CI of the incidence of 
Gr
ade 3 or higher diarrhea is no more than 18.5%. For example, if 18 out of the 120 patients are 
obser
ved to have Grade 3 or higher diarrhea, the incidence and its 95% (2-sided) CIs will be 
15.0% (9.1%, 22.7%
) where the width of the CI is 13.5%.  
In addition to the analyses of the overall safety population, anti-diarrheal prophylaxis 
regimen-specific subgroup analyses will be performed as needed.  
F
or patients enrolled under Amendment 3, the effect of anti-inflammatory treatment budesonide 
on the incidence, severity, and duration of diarrhea will be assessed. For patients enrolled under 
Amendment 4, the effect of a bile acid sequestrant colestipol was to be assessed, with either 
intensive loperamide prophylaxis, or loperamide given on a PRN basis (Amendment 5); for 
patients enrolled under Amendment 6/6.1, under Amendment 7/7.1, the effect of 2 different 
dose
-escalation schemes of neratinib will be assessed. The incidence of Grade 3 or higher 
diarrhea will be evaluated. For each additional cohort, a sample size of 64 patients will ensure 
that the width of the 95% Clopper-Pearson CI of the incidence of Grade 3 or higher diarrhea is 
no more than 26%. For example, if 7 out of the 64 patients are observed to have Grade 3 or 
higher diarrhea, the incidence and its 95% (2-sided) CI will be 10.9% (4.5–21.2%) where the 
width of the
 CI is 17%. 
For each additional cohort, a sample size of 100 patients will ensure that the width of the 95% 
Clopper-Pearson CI of the incidence of Grade 3 or higher diarrhea is no more than 21%. For 
example, if 15 out of the 100 patients are observed to have Grade 3 or higher diarrhea, the 
incidence and its 95% (2-sided) CI will be 15.0% (8.7–23.5%) where the width of the CI is 15%.

Puma Biotechnology Page 66 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL 13. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND 
REPORTING 
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or causal relationship to 
investigational product will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF. 
1
3.1. Definitions 
13.1.1. Adverse Events 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(inc
luding abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product 
(definition per International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH] E2A and E6 R1). 
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study therapy, must be 
recorded using medical terminology on the AE CRF page. Whenever possible, diagnoses should 
be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (eg, cough, runny nose, 
sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as “upper respiratory infection”). 
All measures required for AE management must be recorded in the source document and 
re
ported according to Sponsor instructions. 
For all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate to both determine the 
outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a SA E 
(see Section 13.3 on SAEs) requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or its designated 
re
presentative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigator to 
determine the causality of the AE.  
Interventions for pretreatment conditions (eg, elective cosmetic surgery) or medical procedures 
that were planned before study enrollment are not considered AE. 
13.1.2. Abnormal Laboratory Results 
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal laboratory test result should be reported as an 
AE are as follows: 
 Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or, 
 Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
(merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, 
does not meet criteria for reporting an AE), and/or 
 Te st result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy, and/or 
 Te st result leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of a SAE, and/or 
 Test result is considered to be an AE by the Investigator or by the Sponsor 
Neratinib Tablets (PB-272) 25-JUL-2019 
P
rotocol:  PUMA-NER-6201  Amendment 7.1 
Puma Biotechnology Page 67 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE, 
even if it did meet one of the above criteria except for when the test result leads to any of the 
outcomes included in the definition of a SAE. Clinically significant laboratory results must be 
recorded in the patient’s CRF. 
13.1.3.
 Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose (ICH E2A and E6 R2): 
 R esults in death. 
 I s life-threatening. 
This means that the patient is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not mean 
that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
 R esults in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
 I s a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but that may jeopardize the patient or require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should 
also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE or SAE term; instead, signs and symptoms 
of clinical sequelae resulting from disease progression will be reported if they fulfill the SAE 
definition. 
13.1.4. Hospitalization 
Any inpatient hospital admission that includes a minimum of an overnight stay to a healthcare 
facility meets the criteria for ‘hospitalization’. Admission also includes transfer within the 
hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor, medical 
floor to a coronary care unit, neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). 
The following are not considered to be hospitalization: 
 Rehabilitation facilities. 
 Hospice  facilities. 
 Respite care (eg, caregiver relief). 
 Skilled nursing facilities. 
 Nur sing homes. 
 Routine emergency room admissions. 
 Same day surgeries (as outpatient /same day/ambulatory procedures).

Puma Biotechnology Page 68 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical AE is 
not in itself a SAE. Examples include:  
 Admis sion for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
work-up of persistent pre-treatment lab abnormality). 
 S ocial admission (eg, patient has no place to sleep). 
 Admini strative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination). 
 P rotocol-specified admission during a study (eg, for a procedure required by the study 
protocol). 
 Optional a dmission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery). 
 Hospit alization for observation without a medical AE. 
 P re-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline 
documentation and/or for the individual patient. 
 Admis sion exclusively for the administration of blood products. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not b e 
reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should 
be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins 
during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting appendectomy 
should be recorded as treatment of the AE. 
13.1.5. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) are events which are serious as per 
the above criteria, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product 
information (eg, IB Version 5.0 ) and are judged by the Investigator or by the Sponsor to be 
related to investigational product. For a non-Sponsored investigational product (eg, a comparator 
product) with a marketing authorization, the expectedness of an AE will be determined by 
whether or not it is listed in the package insert/SmPC. 
13.1.6. Severity Assessment 
Adverse events will be graded by the Investigator according to the NCI CTCAE v.4.0 (Publish 
Date: May 28, 2009, http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html), according to the following 
general categories: 
Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.

P
rotocol:  PUMA-NER-6201  Amendment 7.1 
Puma Biotechnology Page 69 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitaliz ation indicated; disabling; limiting 
self-care activities of daily living.  
Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5:  Death related to AE.  
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not 
necessarily a serious adverse event. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes 
significantly with patient's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it meets 
one of the criteria for SAEs, listed above. 
13.1.7. Causality Assessment 
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the Investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF and report such an 
a
ssessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements, if applicable. A 
suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
investigational product caused the AE. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the 
determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product 
caused or contributed to an AE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship should be provided. If the Investigator does not know whether or not the 
investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to 
investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor (see  Section 13.2). If 
the 
Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational product”, 
this should be clearly documented on study records. 
For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigator to determine the 
causality of the AE (eg, investigational product or other illness). The relationship of the AE to 
the study treatment (investigational product, comparator or placebo [as applicable]) will be 
assessed following the definitions below: 
 ‘N o’ (unrelated): Any event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence 
from administration of investigational product AND is likely to have been produced 
by the patient’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the patient. 
 ‘Y es’ (related): Any reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of investigational product AND follows a known response pattern to 
the suspected investigational product AND recurs with re-challenge, AND/OR is 
improved by stopping the investigational product or reducing the dose. 
In addition, if the Investigator determines an AE is associated with study procedures, the 
Investigator must record this causal relationship on the AE CRF page and report such an 
assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.

Puma Biotechnology Page 70 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL 13.1.8. Special Reporting Situations 
Safety events of interest on the Sponsor’s investigational product that may require expedited 
reporting and/or safety evaluation include, but are not limited to: 
 Overdose of an investigational product. 
 S uspected abuse/misuse of an investigational product. 
 I nadvertent or accidental exposure to an investigational product. 
 Medic ation error that may result from the administration or consumption of the wrong 
drug, by the wrong patient, at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. 
 S uspected transmission via an investigational product of an infectious agent. 
Special reporting situations should be recorded on the AE CRF page. Any special reporting 
situation that meets the criteria of a SAE should be recorded on the SAE form and reported as 
required (se e Section 13.3). 
13.2. Reporting Adverse Events 
For serious and non-serious AEs, the reporting period to the Sponsor (or its designated 
representative) begins from the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is 
obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related 
procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through 28 calendar days after the last 
a
dministration of the investigational product.  
For all AEs with causal relationship to the investigational product, follow-up by the Investigator 
may be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at the level acceptable to the 
Investigator, and the Sponsor concurs with that assessment. 
If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AE reporting period for non-serious AEs ends at 
the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs during the SAE 
reporting period after the last dose of investigational product, irrespective of any intervening 
treatment. 
The Sponsor will evaluate any safety information that is spontaneously reported by an 
Investigator beyond the time frame specified in the protocol. 
13.3. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs, irrespective of relationship to investigational product, must be reported within 
24 hours of discovery or notification of the event to the Sponsor or designated representative 
using
 the SAE form. The SAE form must be signed by the Investigator. In particular, if the SAE 
is fatal or life-threatening, notification to the Sponsor must be made immediately, irrespective of 
the extent of available AE information. This timeframe also applies to follow-up information on 
previously forwarded SAE reports as well as to the initial and follow-up reporting of exposure 
during pregnancy and exposure via breast feeding cases. For SAE reporting information, please 
refer to the Study Contact List which is provided as a separate document. 
Relevant medical records should be provided to the Sponsor or its designated representative as 
soon as they become available; autopsy reports should be provided for deaths if available.

P
rotocol:  PUMA-NER-6201  Amendment 7.1 
Puma Biotechnology Page 71 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL Should an Investigator be made aware of any SAEs occurring any time after the reporting period 
that may be causally related to neratinib’s administration, it should be promptly reported.  
All SAEs that have not resolved by the end of the study, or that have not resolved upon 
discontinuation of the patient's participation in the study, must be followed until any of the 
following occurs: 
 The  event resolves. 
 The  event stabilizes. 
 The  event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available. 
 The  event can be attributed to agents other than the investigational product or to 
factors unrelated to study conduct. 
 I t becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (patient or health 
care practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow-up after 
demonstration of due diligence with follow-up efforts). 
13.4. Pregnancy 
All initial reports of pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor by the investigational staff 
within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the appropriate Exposure In Utero (EIU) 
form. 
For investigational products and for marketed products used as investigational product in 
neratinib studies, an exposure during pregnancy occurs if: 
 A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
directly exposed (eg, environmental exposure) to the investigational product, or the 
female becomes or is found to be, pregnant after discontinuing and/or being directly 
exposed to the investigational product (maternal exposure) for 28 days after last dose 
of or exposure to neratinib. 
 A male partner of a pregnant female has been exposed to the investigational product, 
either due to treatment or environmental exposure, within 3 months prior to the time 
of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy (paternal exposure). 
If any study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study patient’s treatment with the investigational product or exposure as defined above, the 
Investigator must submit this information on an EIU form to the Sponsor (or its designated 
representative). In addition, the Investigator must submit information regarding environmental 
exposure to an investigational product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is 
pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIU 
form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of 
awareness of the pregnancy. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of 
delivery (see following information related to induce termination of pregnancy). 
Follow-up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all exposure during 
pregnancy reports with an unknown outcome. The Investigator will follow the pregnancy until 
completion or until pregnancy termination (eg, induced abortion) and then notify the Sponsor or 
Neratinib Tablets (PB-272) 25-JUL-2019 
P

Puma Biotechnology Page 72 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL its designated representative of the outcome as a follow-up to the initial EIU form. In the case of 
a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the 
event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically 
possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual 
inspection (unless pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the 
findings are reported). 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (eg, 
ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital 
anomaly [including that in a live born, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a 
neonatal death]), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. 
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are classified as SAEs follows:  
 “ Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion. 
 All neona tal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without 
regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be 
reported as SAEs when the Investigator assesses the infant’s death as related to 
exposure to investigational product. 
Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by the 
Investigator. Follow-up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal 
sequelae in the infant will be required. 
13.5. Sponsor Reporting Requirements to Health Authorities and 
IRB/IEC 
The Sponsor assumes responsibility for reporting of AEs including SUSARs according to local 
and international regulations, as appropriate. The Investigator (or the Sponsor where required) 
must
 report these events to the appropriate IRB/IEC that approved the protocol unless otherwise 
required and documented by the IRB/IEC.

The Sponsor of this study may delegate some administrative aspects of this study to a duly 
authorized representative including, but not limited to, study initiation, monitoring, and 
management of SAE reports. 
14.1. Data Collection, Processing, and Monitoring 
14.1.1. Case Report Forms and Source Documentation 
All data captured for the study is planned to be electronic using the Electronic Data Capture 
system. However, if necessary and only if requested by the Sponsor, data capture may be 
performed using paper CRFs. 
eCRFs will be provided by the Sponsor or its representative and should be handled in accordance 
with the instructions provided by the Sponsor or designated representative. 
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining adequate and accurate eCRFs which have been 
de
signed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the clinical investigation. Visit 
data should be entered into the eCRFs within 5 business days. Each eCRF should be completed 
by the Investigator or delegate as stated in the Site Delegation List.  
The site will perform data entry of all eCRFs as per source documents. Completion Instructions 
for eCRFs will be provided for the Study Coordinator’s use. The data should be reviewed, signed 
and dated by the Investigator electronically for accuracy and completeness. Once the site monitor 
has verified the contents of the completed eCRF pages against the source data, queries may be 
raised if the data are unclear or contradictory. These queries must be addressed by the 
Investigator and verified by the clinical research associate (CRA). After all the data issues are 
resolved, these eCRFs may be locked to prevent any further data changes. 
14.1.2. Study Monitoring and Access to Source Documentation 
To ensure compliance with relevant regulations, data generated by this study must be available 
for inspection upon request by representatives of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA), other national authorities (eg, the United Kingdom 
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the German Federal Institute for Drugs 
and Medical Devices, and local health authorities as applicable, the Sponsor and representatives, 
and the IRB/IEC for each study site. The Investigator will permit authorized representatives of 
the Sponsor, the respective national or local health authorities, and auditors to inspect facilities 
and records relevant to this study. 
The Sponsor or representative’s monitor is responsible for verifying the CRFs at regular intervals 
throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and 
consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research. 
Source data to be reviewed during this study will include, but is not restricted to: patient’s 
medical file, patient’s diary cards (if applicable), and original laboratory test, histology, and 
pathology reports. All key data must be recorded in the patient’s hospital notes.

P
rotocol:  PUMA-NER-6201  Amendment 7.1 
Puma Biotechnology Page 74 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL Auditors, IRB/IEC and/or regulatory inspectors will also have access to the CRFs and source 
documents. The ICF will include a statement by which the patient allows the 
monitor/auditor/inspector from the IRB/IEC or regulatory authority access to source data (eg, 
patient’s medical file, appointment books, original laboratory test reports, X-rays, etc.) that 
substantiate information in the CRFs. These personnel, bound by professional secrecy, will not 
disclose any personal information or personal drug information. 
14.1.3. Data Quality Assurance 
During and/or after completion of the study, quality assurance auditor(s) named by the Sponsor 
or the regulatory authorities may wish to perform on-site audits. The Investigators will be 
expected to cooperate with any audit and provide assistance and documentation (including 
source data) as requested. 
The Sponsor’s representatives are responsible for contacting and visiting the Investigator for the 
purpose of inspecting the facilities and, upon request, inspecting the various records of the 
clinical study (eg, CRFs and other pertinent data) provided that patient confidentiality is 
respected. 
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the 
course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing CRFs, are resolved. 
In accordance with ICH E6 Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the Sponsor’s audit plans, this 
study may be selected for audit by representatives from the Sponsor’s (or designee’s) Quality 
Assurance Department. Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, drug storage areas, 
laboratories) and review of study-related records will occur to evaluate the study conduct and 
compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP (ICH E6), US Investigational Drugs (21 CFR§50, §54, 
§56, a
nd §312), EU Clinical Studies Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC), and applicable regional 
regulatory requirements. 
14.1.4. Data Processing 
All data will be entered by site personnel into the electronic data capture system/CRF (as 
detailed in Section 14.1.1 ).  
The data
-review and data-handling document will include specifications for consistency and 
plausibility checks on data and will also include data-handling rules for obvious data errors. 
Query/correction sheets for unresolved queries will be sent to the study monitors for resolution 
with the Investigator. The database will be updated on the basis of signed corrections.  
Previous and concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug 
Reference List, which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification 
system. Medical history and AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) terminology. The versions of the coding dictionaries will be provided in 
the Clinical Study Report (CSR). 
14.1.5. Retention of Data and Study Records 
As described in the ICH GCP Guidelines, ‘essential documents’, including CRFs, source 
documents, ICFs, laboratory test results, and drug inventory records, should be retained by the 
Investigator until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH

Puma Biotechnology Page 75 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or 
at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the 
investigational product. These documents should be retained for a longer period; however, if 
required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by agreement with the Sponsor. The 
Investigator should obtain written permission from the Sponsor prior to the destruction of any 
study document. 
These records should be made available at reasonable times for inspection and duplication, if 
re
quired, by a properly authorized representative of the US FDA in accordance with 
21 CFR §312.68 or other National Regulatory Authorities.

4.2. Ethical Aspects 
14.2.1. Good Clinical Practice and Ethical Conduct of the Study 
This protoc
ol accords with the principles of the World Medical Association Declaration of 
Helsinki as set forth at the 18th General Assembly (World Medical Association Declaration of 
He
lsinki, Helsinki, Finland, 1964) and amendments thereto. The most current amended version 
will be in effect. 
The procedures set out in this study protocol are also designed to ensure that the Sponsor and 
Investigator abide by the principles of the GCP guidelines of the ICH and in keeping with local 
lega
l requirements. 
14.2.2. Informed Consent Responsibilities 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain written informed consent from the patient or 
patient’s legal representative. If informed consent has not been obtained, then no protocol 
required procedures are to be performed on the patient and no patient data are to be transferred to 
the Sponsor. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the source documents for 
each patient. 
The study will be discussed with the patient, and the patient will receive written information and 
an explanation of what the study involves, ie, the objectives, potential benefits and risk, 
inconveniences and the patient’s rights and responsibilities. If applicable, the information will be 
pr
ovided in a certified translation of the local language.  
A signed, IRB/IEC approved ICF must be obtained from patient before any study specific 
procedures can occur. Confirmation of the patient’s informed consent and the informed consent 
process must also be documented in the patient’s medical record. Signed ICFs must remain in 
each patient’s study file and must be available for verification by study monitors at any time. A 
copy of the fully signed ICFs will be given to the patient. 
If the IRB/IEC requires modification of this form, the documentation supporting this requirement 
must be provided to the Sponsor, along with the new version. The Sponsor reserves the right to 
reject these modifications, should they not cover the minimum information required by ICH 
GCP. 
A patient wishing to participate must also provide Authorization for Use and Release of Health 
and Research Study Information prior to any study-related procedures or change in treatment.

P
rotocol:  PUMA-NER-6201  Amendment 7.1 
Puma Biotechnology Page 76 of 114 C ONFIDENTIAL If a patient is not physically or mentally competent to understand and to give their informed 
consent to participate in the study (eg, is blind or illiterate), a legally acceptable representative or 
impartial witness as applicable, may sign the ICF on behalf of the patient. It remains th e 
responsibility of the principal Investigator to assure that the patient is suitable for inclusion in 
this study and will be able to adhere to all study procedures throughout the course of the study. 
The explicit wish of a minor, or mentally incapacitated adult, who is capable of forming an 
opini
on and assessing the study information, to refuse participation in or to be withdrawn from 
the study at any time will be respected by the Investigator. 
If a protocol amendment is required, the ICF may need to be revised to reflect the changes to the 
protocol. If the consent form is revised, it must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate 
IRB/IEC, and signed by all patients subsequently enrolled in the study as well as those currently 
enrolled in the study. 
14.3. Other  Study Administrative Aspects 
14.3.1. Protocol Approval and Protocol Amendment 
The protocol (approved by the Sponsor or its representative) will be submitted to the IRB/IEC 
for review and it must be approved before the study is initiated. Prior to implementing changes in 
the study, the Sponsor will produce a protocol amendment and the IRB/IEC must also approve 
any amendments to the protocol. 
Any change in the study plan requires a protocol amendment. An Investigator must not make any 
changes to the study without IRB/IEC and Sponsor approval except when necessary to eliminate 
apparent immediate hazards to the patients. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent 
immediate hazard to patients may be implemented immediately, but the change must then be 
documented in an amendment, reported to the IRB/IEC within 5 working days, and submitted to 
the appropriate regulatory agency in the required time frame. All protocol amendments must be 
reviewed and approved, by the Sponsor and the Investigator. 
14.3.2. Investigator Responsibilities 
The
 Investigator undertakes to perform the study in compliance with the protocol, ICH 
Guidelines per GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements. A copy of the guidelines will be 
available in the Investigator Site File. 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that adequate time and appropriate resources are 
available at the investigational site prior to commitment to participate in this study. The 
Investigator should also be able to demonstrate a potential for recruiting the required number of 
suit
able patient within the agreed recruitment period. 
The Investigator will maintain a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom the Investigator 
has delegated significant study-related tasks. An up- to-date copy of the curriculum vitae for the 
Investigator and sub-Investigator(s) will be provided to the Sponsor (or its representative) before 
starting the study. 
If the patient has a primary physician, the Investigator should, with the patient’s consent, inform 
the primary physician of the patient’s participation in the study.

E3. 
The Investigator must adhere to the protocol as detailed in this document. The Investigator will 
be
 responsible for enrolling only those patients who have met protocol eligibility criteria. The 
Investigators will be required to sign an Investigator agreement to confirm acceptance and 
willingness to comply with the study protocol. 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to communicate with their local IRB/IEC to ensure accurate 
and timely information is provided at all phases during the study. In particular, the appropriate 
approvals must be in place prior to recruitment, notification of any SAEs during the study must 
take place and the IRB/IEC must be informed of study completion. 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to submit this protocol, the final approved informed 
consent document (approved by the Sponsor or its representative), relevant supporting 
information, all types of patient recruitment or advertisement information (approved by the 
Sponsor or its representative), and any other written information to be provided to the patient to 
the IRB/IEC for review and these must be approved before the study is initiated. Prior to 
implementing changes in the study, the Sponsor will produce a protocol amendment and the 
IRB/IEC must also approve any amendments to the protocol. 
On the approval letter, the study (title, protocol number and version), the documents reviewed 
(protocol, informed consent material, amendments) and the date of review should be clearly 
stated. 
Investigational product supplies will not be released and the patient recruitment will not begin 
until this written approval has been received by the Sponsor or its designee. 
The Investigator is responsible for keeping the IRB/IEC apprised of the progress of the study and 
of any changes made to the protocol as deemed appropriate, and at least once a year. The 
Investigator must also keep the IRB/IEC informed of any serious and significant AEs. 
14.3.3. Patient Responsibilities 
Data collected during this study may be used to support the development, registration or 
marketing of neratinib. All data collected during the study will be controlled by the Sponsor (or 
designee) and the Sponsor will abide by all relevant data protection laws. 
After a patient has consented to take part in the study, their medical records and the data 
collected during the study will be reviewed by representatives of the Sponsor and/or the 
company organizing the research on the Sponsor’s behalf to confirm that the data collected are 
accurate and for the purpose of analyzing the results. These records and data may additionally be 
reviewed by auditors or by regulatory authorities. The patient’s name, however, will not be 
disclosed outside the hospital. They will be known by a unique patient number. The results of 
this study may be used in other countries throughout the world that have ensured an adequate 
level of protection for personal data. 
Written authorization (United States [US] sites only) or written informed consent in accordance 
with current data protection regulations (EU sites only) is to be obtained from each patient prior 
to enrollment into the study, and/or from the patient's legally authorized representative in

Puma Biotechnology Page 90 of 114 CONFIDENTIAL g Vital signs will be measured after resting in a seated position for 5 minutes, prior to dosing, and will include: blood pressure (systolic and diastolic; mmHg), 
resting heart rate (beats per minute), body temperature (°C), respiration rate, weight (kg), height (screening only).  
h Complete blood count (CBC) to include hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hb), platelet count, red blood cell (RBC) count, and white blood cell (WBC) count 
plus differential.  CBCs must be tested at screening and on Day 1 of Cycle 1 (-3 days), Cycle 2 (±5 days), Cycle 3 (±10 days), Cycle 4 (±10 days), Cycle 7 
(±14 days), Cycle 10 (±14 days), as well as on Day 28 of Cycle 13/EOT Visit (±5 days), and as clinically indicated.  Visits for CBC testing should be aligned 
with LFT testing and other routine study visits when possible.  The Cycle 1/Day 1 tests do not need to be performed, if the screening tests were done within 
72 hours of enrollment.  
i Serum chemistry tests include sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or urea, serum creatinine, albumin, lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphorus, and glucose (non-fasting).  The Cycle 1/Day 1 tests do not need to be performed, if the screening tests were done within 
72 hours of enrollment. For Amendment 4 and Amendment 5 patients who will be receiving colestipol, a baseline (occurring at Screen or C1D1) and C2D1 
fasting lipid panel is required to assess total cholesterol, HDL-C, and triglycerides. 
j Liver function tests (LFTs) must include total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).  
LFTs must be tested at screening, and on Day 1 of Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 3, Cycle 4, Cycle 7, and Cycle 10, as well as on Day 28 of Cycle 13/EOT Visit 
(±5 days), and as clinically indicated.  Visits for LFT testing should be aligned with CBC testing and other routine study visits when possible.  LFTs should 
also be tested in patients experiencing Grade 3 or higher diarrhea or any signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity, such as worsening of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash or eosinophilia.  During the evaluation of potential hepatotoxicity, bilirubin should be fractionated and 
prothrombin time should be measured.  Also, liver imaging should be obtained for patients with any signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity and/or Grade 3 or 
higher LFT elevations, or as clinically indicated.  Refer to the guidelines for the management of LFT changes in the main section of the protocol 
(see Appendix 2 ).  
k For patients enrolled starting with Amendment 2 only:  cfDNA will be obtained from plasma samples collected at screening, C7D1, C13D28, and/or at time 
of treatment discontinuation and at disease recurrence; cfDNA will undergo molecular profiling to identify biomarkers of disease recurrence. 
l At selected centers, a small stool swab from toilet paper, inserted into a tube that is provided, will be collected by the patient at Screening, C2D1, and C4D1 
or at time of treatment discontinuation if earlier than C4D1 for possible future assessments of microbiome. The tube is to be inserted into a bag then labeled 
for return in packaging. 
m During trial participation, ECHO or MUGA will be performed at Screening and on Day 28 of Cycle 13/EOT Visit. It is strongly recommended to use the 
same method of measurement for the same patient throughout the duration of the study.  
n Per standard of care, bone scan or positron emission tomography (PET) scan performed within 28 days prior to the date of enrollment; only required if 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is ≥2x upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or there are symptoms of metastatic bone disease. A confirmatory imaging study is 
required if the results from the bone scan are questionable (see Section 5.1 ).  
o Per standard of care, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound of the abdomen and chest performed within 28 days prior 
to the date of enrollment; only required if aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or ALP is ≥2x ULN (see Section 5.1 ).  
p For patients enrolled starting with Amendment 2 only:  Health outcomes assessments consist of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Breast 
Cancer (FACT-B) and the EQ- 5D-5L questionnaires. For patients enrolled starting with Amendment 6.1: the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL) will be 
added to the health outcomes questionnaires that the patient will complete. Questionnaires should be completed before any other study procedures on the day 
of the study visit. At the final or EOT visit, it is acceptable for questionnaires to be completed after study procedures. Questionnaires are to be completed by 
the patient at C1D1, C2D1, C4D1, C7D1, C10D1, and C13D28.  
q Concomitant medications and concomitant nonpharmacologic treatments/therapies are recorded from 30 days before signing of the informed consent form 
until the Safety Follow-up Visit.

Puma Biotechnology Page 91 of 114 CONFIDENTIAL r Patients enrolled starting with Amendment 6 will receive neratinib at a starting dose of 120 mg/day with dose escalation (ie, total dose 120 mg daily for the 
first week, 160 mg daily for the Week 2, and 240 mg daily for Week 3 and thereafter, until EOT. For patients receiving budesonide, loperamide is to be 
administered daily for two (2) 28-day cycles and then as needed (PRN). For patients in Amendment 4, loperamide is to be administered for one 28-day cycle 
and then as needed (PRN) thereafter. For patients enrolled under Amendment 5, Amendment 6, Amendment 6.1, Amendment 7, and Amendment 7.1, 
loperamide is to be administered as needed (PRN) for the entire study. Patients are asked to document administration of neratinib and loperamide on a diary 
on a daily basis (for patients starting with Amendment 6.1, this will be for the first 2 cycles (56 days) of the study; for patients starting with Amendment 7, 
after 2 cycles only neratinib administration is to be recorded, until EOT), and to return this diary to the site at appropriate visits (for patients starting with 
Amendment 6.1, the diary will be collected at C3D1, or at EOT if earlier). Individual patient dosing compliance should be reviewed at each study visit by 
study site staff. Investigators must ensure that patients have loperamide on hand when starting to take neratinib. Loperamide and neratinib will be dispensed 
directly by the study sites on or before Cycle 1/Day 1 and during subsequent visits as needed. Loperamide is the recommended standard therapy to treat 
diarrhea in this study. If alternative antidiarrheal medication is used, the reason must be documented in the source documents.  Acceptable reasons are 
non-tolerance of loperamide or lack of efficacy.  
s The effect of anti-inflammatory treatment (for patients enrolled under Amendment 3 and a bile acid sequestrant, colestipol, (for patients enrolled under 
Amendment 4 and Amendment 5) on the incidence and severity of Grade 3 or higher diarrhea will be investigated in 3 sequential patient cohorts. The first 
treatment cohort will receive budesonide + intensive loperamide prophylaxis, the next cohort will receive colestipol + intensive loperamide prophylaxis, and 
the subsequent cohort will receive colestipol + loperamide on a PRN only basis.  
t From the signing of the informed consent form to 28 days after the last dose, adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) are monitored 
continuously and recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) at every visit.  Patients must be instructed to contact the site to report and discuss the 
severity of diarrhea and the appropriate course of treatment.  Patients must use the diary to document any episodes of diarrhea for the first 2 cycles (56 days) 
of the study.  On this diary, patients also record the baseline number of stools per day, and in case of diarrhea, the number of loose stools per day and use of 
loperamide and/or other antidiarrheals, if applicable. Patients are asked to return this diary to the site at each visit.  Patient instructions for the management of 
diarrhea are reviewed with the patients and handed to the patient at the time of enrollment.  Should an Investigator be made aware of any SAEs occurring any 
time after the reporting period that may be causally related to neratinib’s administration, it should be promptly reported. 
u The Investigator or research staff must call the patients 1, 2, and 3 days after the first dose of neratinib (i) to inquire about potential adverse events, including 
diarrhea; (ii) to provide guidance to the patients for immediate and appropriate management of AEs, including diarrhea as specified in this protocol; (iii) to 
confirm that the patients have loperamide available, in case needed; (iv) to inquire about the first date of neratinib intake; the Investigator/research staff must 
update the eCRF within 3 days of receipt of this information. In addition, for patients enrolled under Amendment 6, the Investigator or research staff must call

Liver Toxicity: 
Guidelines for adjustment of neratinib in the event of liver toxicity are shown in  Table A2.4. 
Abnor
mal values in ALT concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin that meet the 
criteria outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential 
cases of drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered 
important medical events. 
Patients who experience ≥Grade 3 diarrhea requiring IV fluid treatment or any signs or 
s
ymptoms of hepatotoxicity such as worsening of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash or eosinophilia should be evaluated for changes in liver function 
tests. Fractionated bilirubin and prothrombin time must also be collected during hepatotoxicity 
evaluation.

Grade 3 ALT (>5 – 20x ULN)   
OR  
Grade 3 bilirubin (>3-10x ULN)   Hold neratinib  until recovery to ≤ Grade  1 for patients 
with ALT ≤ Grade  1 at baseline OR ≤ Grade  2 for patients 
with Grade  2 ALT at baseline.  
 Evaluate alternative causes.  
 For patients with ALT ≤ Grade  1 at baseline:  Resume 
neratinib  at the next lower dose level if reco very to 
≤Grade  1 occurs within 4 weeks. If Grade  3 ALT or 
bilirubin occurs again despite one dose reduction, 
permanently discontinue neratinib .  
Grade 4 ALT (>20x ULN)  
OR 
Grade 4 Bilirubin (>10x ULN)   Permanently discontinue neratinib . 
 Evaluate alternative  causes.  
ALT > 3x ULN   
AND  
Total bilirubin >2x ULN  
AND  
Alkaline phospatase < 2x ULN  
(potential Hy’s law indicators of drug -induced liver 
damage)   Hold neratinib . 
The patient should return to the investigational site and be 
evaluated as soon as possible, preferably within 48  hours 
from awareness of the abnormal results. This evaluation 
should include laboratory tests, detailed history and 
physical assessment and for oncology studies, the 
possibility of hepatic neoplasm (primary or secondary) 
should be cons idered. In addition to repeating AST and 
ALT, laboratory tests should include albumin, total 
bilirubin, direct bilirubin, PT and alkaline phosphatase. A 
detailed history, including relevant information, such as 
review of ethanol, concomitant medications, r ecreational 
drug and supplement consumption, family history, sexual 
history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced 
patient, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or 
allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected. 
Further test ing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and 
liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted. All cases 
confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the criteria 
mentioned above (i.e., ALT > 3 x ULN associated with 
bilirubin >2  x ULN and alkaline phosphat ase <2  x ULN), 
with no other cause for liver function test abnormalities 
identified at the time should be considered potential Hy’s 
Law cases, irrespective of availability of all the results of 
the investigations performed to determine etiology of the 
abno rmal liver function tests.  
 Contact the Sponsor immediately to discuss next steps, 
including evaluation of alternative causes, and 
management of investigational product.  
 These events must be reported as SAEs.  
NOTE: During evaluation of hepatotoxicity, bilirubin must be fractionated, prothrombin time must be measured, and 
liver imaging should be considered.

PRECAUTIONS FOR BUDESONIDE 
Budesonide  Contraindications  
 Known hypersensitivity to budesonide or any of the ingredients in budesonide tablets  
 
Warnings and Precautions  
Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression - since budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid, follow 
general warnings concerning glucocorticoids:  
When glucocorticoids are used chronically, systemic effects such as hypercorticism and 
adrenal suppressio n may occur. Glucocorticoids can reduce the response of the 
hypothalamus -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis to stress.  In situations where patients are 
subject to surgery or other stress situations, supplementation with a systemic 
glucocorticosteroid is recomme nded. Since budesonide is a glucocorticosteroid, general 
warnings concerning glucocorticosteroids should be followed.   
Transferring patients from systemic glucocorticoids: Risk of impaired adrenal function 
when transferring from glucocorticoid treatment  with higher systemic effects to 
glucocorticoid treatment with lower systemic effects, such as budesonide. Taper patients 
slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to budesonide.  
Care is needed in patients who are transferred from glucocorticosteroid treatment with 
higher systemic effects to glucocorticosteroids with lower systemic effects, such as 
budesonide, since symptoms attributed to withdrawal of steroid therapy, including th ose of 
acute adrenal suppression or benign intracranial hypertension, may develop. 
Adrenocortical function monitoring may be required in these patients and the dose of 
glucocorticosteroid treatment with high systemic effects should be reduced cautiously.  
Immunosuppression: Potential worsening of infections (e.g., existing tuberculosis, fungal, 
bacterial, viral or parasitic infection; or ocular herpes simplex). Use with caution in 
patients with these infections. More serious or even fatal course of chicke npox or measles 
can occur in susceptible patients.  
Patients who are on drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to 
infection that healthy individuals. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more 
serious or even fatal course in  susceptible patients or patients on immunosuppressant 
doses of glucocorticosteroids. In patients who have not had these diseases, particular care 
should be taken to avoid exposure.  
How the dose, route, and duration of glucocorticosteroid administration  affect the risk of 
developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying 
disease and/or prior glucocorticoid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed, 
therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled  intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If exposed to measles, 
prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. See 
prescribing information for VZIG and IG. If chicken pox develops, treatment with 
antiviral agents may be considered.

P
rotocol: PUMA-NER-6201  Amendment 7.1 
Puma Biotechnology Page 109 of 114 CONFIDENTIAL Budesonide  Contraindications  
Glucocorticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or 
quiescent tuberculosis infection, untreated fungal, bacterial, systemic viral or parasitic 
infections.  
 Replacement of systemic glucocorticosteroids with budesonide tablets may unmask 
allergies (e.g., rhinitis and eczema), which were previously controlled by systemic drug.  
 Reduced liver function affects the elimination of glucocorticosteroids, and increas ed 
systemic availability of oral budesonide has been demonstrated in patients with liver 
cirrhosis.  
 Caution should be taken in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, 
peptic ulcer, glaucoma or cataracts, or with a family history of diabetes or glaucoma, or 
with any other condition where glucocorticosteroids may have unwanted effects.

Puma Biotechnology Page 110 of 114 CONFIDENTIAL APPENDIX 10. CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, AND 
PRECAUTIONS FOR COLESTIPOL 
Colestipol  Contraindications  
 Known hypersensitivity to micronized colestipol hydrochloride tablets or any of the 
ingredients in the tablets  
 
Warnings and Precautions  
Because it sequesters bile  acids, colestipol hydrochloride may interfere with normal fat 
absorptions and thus may reduce absorption of folic acid and fat soluble vitamins such a, 
D, and K.  
Chronic use of colestipol hydrochloride may be associated with an increased bleeding 
tendency due to hypoprothrombinemia from vitamin K deficiency. This will usually 
respond promptly to parenteral vitamin K 1 and recurrences can be prevented by oral 
administration of vitamin K 1. 
Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels should be determined periodically based on 
NCEP guidelines to confirm a favorable initial and adequate long -term response.  
Micronized colestipol hydrochloride tablets may produce or severely worsen pre -existing 
constipation. The dosage should be increased gradually in patients to minimize the risk of 
developing fecal impaction. In patients with pre -existing constipation, the starting dose 
should be 2 grams once or twice a day. Increased fluid and fiber intake should be 
encouraged to alleviate constipation a nd a stool softener may occasionally be indicated. If 
the initial dose is well tolerated, the dose may be increased as needed by a further 2 to 4 
grams/day (at monthly intervals) with periodic monitoring of serum lipoproteins. If 
constipation worsens or th e desired therapeutic response is not achieved at 2 to 16 
grams/day, combination therapy or alternate therapy should be considered. Particular 
effort should be made to avoid constipation in patients with symptomatic coronary artery 
disease. Constipation as sociate with micronized colestipol hydrochloride tablets may 
aggravate hemorrhoids.  
While there have been no reports of hypothyroidism induced in individuals with normal 
thyroid function, the theoretical possibility exists, particularly in patients with limited 
thyroid reserve.  
Since colestipol hydrochloride is a chloride form of an anion exchange resin, there is a 
possibility that prolonged use may lead to the development of hyperchloremic acidosis.  
 
Potential for Drug -drug Interactions  
Since col estipol is an anion exchange resin, this effect may be related to a strong affinity 
for anions other than the bile acids. In vitro studies have indicated that colestipol binds a 
number of drugs.  
Repeated doses of colestipol given prior to a single dose of propranolol in human trials 
have been reported to decrease propranolol absorption. Patients on propranolol and 
possibly other beta -blockers should be monitored when colestipol is added or deleted from 
Neratinib Tablets (PB-272)  25-JUL-2019 
P
rotocol: PUMA-NER-6201  Amendment 7.1 
Puma Biotechnology Page 111 of 114 CONFIDENTIAL Colestipol  Contraindications  
the therapeutic regimen.  Effects of the absorption of other beta -blockers have not been 
determined.  
Studies in humans show that the absorption of chorothiazide as reflected in urinary 
excretion is markedly decreased even when administered one hour before colestipol. The 
absorption of tetracycline, furosemide,  penicillin G, hydrochlorothiazide, and gemfibrozil 
was significantly decreased when given simultaneously with colestipol. These drugs were 
not tested to determine the effect of administration one hour before colestipol.  
No lowering effect on blood levels in humans was noted when colestipol was administered 
with any of the following drugs: aspirin, clindamycin, clofibrate, methyldopa, nicotinic 
acid (niacin), tolbutamide, phenytoin or warfarin. Particular caution should be observed 
with digoxin preparations  since ther are conflicting results for the effect of colestipol on 
the availability of digoxin and digitoxin. The potential for binding of these drugs if given 
concomitantly is present. Discontinuing colestipol could pose a hazard to health if a 
potential ly toxic drug that is significantly bound to the resin has been titrated to a 
maintenance level while the patient was taking colestipol.  
Bile acid bind resins such as coletipol may also interfere with the absorption of oral 
phosphate supplements and hydroc ortisone.  
A study has shown that cholestyramine binds bile acids and reduces mycophenolic acid 
exposure. As colestipol also binds bile acids, colestipol may reduce mycophenolic acid 
exposure and potentially reduce efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil.  
Information for Patients  
Micronized colestipol hydrochloride tablets may be larger than pills you have taken 
before. If you have had swallowing problems or choking with food, liquids or other tablets 
or capsules in the past, you should discuss this with your doctor before taking micronized 
colestipol hydrochloride tablets.  
It is important that you take micronized colestipol hydrochloride tablets correctly:  
 Always take on tablet at a time and swallow promptly  
 Swallow each tablet whole. Do not cut, crush , or chew the tablets  
 Micronized colestipol hydrochloride tablets much be taken with water or 
another liquid that you prefer. Swallowing the tablets will be easier if you 
drink plenty of liquid as you swallow each tablet.  
Difficulty swallowing and tempor ary obstruction of the esophagus (the tube between your 
mouth and stomach) have been rarely reported in patients taking micronized colestipol 
hydrochloride tablets. If a tablet does get stuck after you swallow it, you may notice 
pressure or discomfort. If this happens to you, you should contact your doctor. Do not take 
micronized colestipol hydrochloride tablets again without your doctor’s advice.   
If you are taking other medications, you should take them at least one hour before or four 
hours after taking micronized colestipol hydrochloride tablets.  
 
Adverse Reactions  
Gastrointestinal  
The most common adverse reactions are confined to the ga strointestinal tract. 
Constipation is the major single complaint and at times is severe. Most instances of

P
rotocol: PUMA-NER-6201  Amendment 7.1 
Puma Biotechnology Page 112 of 114 CONFIDENTIAL Colestipol  Contraindications  
constipation are mild, transient, and controlled with standard treatment. Increased fluid 
intake and inclusion of additional dietary fiber should be the first step; a stool softener 
may be added if needed. Some patients require decreased dosage or discontinuation of 
therapy. Hemorrhoids may be aggravated.  
Other less frequent gastrointestinal complaints consist of abdominal discomfort 
(abdominal pain and cramping) intestinal gas (bloating and flatulence), indigestion and 
heartburn, diarrhea and loose stools, and nausea and vomiting. Bleeding hemorrhoids and 
blood in the stool have been infrequently reported. Peptic ulceration, cholecystitis, and 
cholelithiasis have been rarely reported in patients receiving colestipol hydrochloride 
granules, and are not necessarily drug related.   
Difficulty swallowing and transient esophageal obstruction have been rarely reported in 
patients taking micronized colestipol hydrochloride.  
Transient and modest elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) and alkaline phosphatase were observed on one or more 
occasions in various patients treated with colestipol hydrochloride.  
Cardiovascular  
Chest pain, angina, and tachycardia have been infrequently reports and are comparable to 
placebo rates in trials  
Hypersensitivity  
Rash has been infrequently reported. Urticaria and dermatitis have been rarely noted in 
patients receiving colestipol hydrochloride granules.  
Musculoskeletal  
Musculoskeletal pain, aches, and pains in the extremities, joint pain and arthritis, and 
backache have been reported.  
Neurologic  
Headache, migraine headache, and sinus headache have been reported. Other infrequently 
reported complaints include dizzine ss, light -headedness, and insomnia.  
Miscellaneous  
Anorexia, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and swelling of the hands or feet, have 
been infrequently reported.

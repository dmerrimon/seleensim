Studied P eriod (years):  
Estimated date first subject enrolled: December 2014  
Estimated date last subject completed: September 2020 Phase of D evelopment:  
3 
Objectives:  
Primary:    
• To evaluate the safety of intravenous ( IV) peramivir (study drug) compared to oral 
oseltamivir in pediatric subjects with acute uncomplicated influenza. 
Secondary:  
• To describe the pharmacokinetics of IV peramivir in pediatric subjects with influenza. 
• To evaluate the effectiveness of IV peramivir compared to oral oseltamivir in pediatric 
subjects with influenza. 
• To evaluate the incidence of influenza complications, specifically otiti s media, sinusitis, 
bronchitis or pneumonia requiring antibiotic use diagnosed after initiation of treatment. 
Methodology:  
Subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria may be enrolled into the study. It is expected 
that most subjects will have the Screening/ Baseline visit and the Day 1 treatment visit on the 
same day.  
A subject’s duration of participation in this study is expected to be 14 days.  
Subjects ≥ 7 years  old will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: 
Treatment Group 1: A single dose of i ntravenous peramivir  
Treatment Group 2: Oral oseltamivir given twice daily (BID) for 5 days  
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 6 (Note: at the date of amendment  3, the dose cohorts  for subjects > 7 years old were  fully 
enrolled and no further subjects > 7 years will be enrolled). 
Subjects < 7 years old will receive a single dose of intravenous peramivir. 
(Note: at the date of amendment 3, the dose cohort for subjects 2- 7 years  old was partially 
enrolled under the previous randomization scheme that allocated subjects to peramivir or 
oseltamivir .  Following FDA feedback, remaining subjects to be enrolled in the 2 to <7 years 
old cohort, the 28 day to < 2 years old cohort, and the birth to < 28-day cohort, will all be assigned to receive treatment with IV peramivir.  
Following treatment on study Da y 1, subjects will undergo follow-up assessments on Days 3, 
7, and 14. The Day 3 visit may be a home visit (performed by a qualified study nurse). Day 7 is required to take place in the clinic, and Day 14 may either be a clinic visit, home visit, or follow-up phone call to the subject/parent/guardian.  
All parents/caregiver s will record the following information in the Subject Diary : 
• Temperature measurements (oral or axillary) will be taken with an electronic 
thermometer provided by BioCryst, approximately every 12 hours until temperature 
normalizes for 48 hours (i.e., temperature without antipyretic is <  99.4 orally in 
children ≥ 6 and < 98.4 axillary in children < 6 years old for 4 measurements).With the 
exception of the baseline measurement, all temperature measurements will be obtained at least 4  hours after, or immediately before, administration of oral acetaminophen or 
other antipyretic medication s, if taken. 
• Date and time of oral oseltamivir dose administration, if applicable.  This should be 
recorded in the Subject Diary twice a day for 5 days.  
• Doses of antipyretic  medication and any medications taken for symptomatic relief , each 
day through the last follow- up assessment . 
• The ability of the child  or adolescent  to return to day care/school and/ or resume their 
normal “pre- illness” daily activity . 
• The child or adolescent’s appetite and eating patterns assessed as normal or reduced/abnormal. 
All parents/caregiver s of subjects 7 years of age and older will record the following additional 
information  in the Subject Diary: 
• Assessment of 7 influenza symptoms [cough, sore throat, nasal obstruction, myalgia 
(muscle aches ), headache, feverishness, and fatigue ] on a 4- point severity scale 
(0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe) twice daily, beginning pre-dose on Day 1 
until symptom resolution or through the last follow -up visit, (whichever comes first). 
All parents/caregiver s of subjects ≥ 4 years  of age to ≤ 6 years of age will record the  following 
additional information in the Subject Diary: 
• Assessment of 7 influenza symptoms [cough, sore throat, nasal obstruction, headache, 
feverishness, fatigue/malaise, and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting or 
diarrhea) ] on a 4-point severity scale (0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe) twice 
daily until symptom resolution or through the last follow -up visit, (whichever comes 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 7 first).  
All parents/caregiver s of subjects ≤ 3 years of age will record the following additional 
information in th e Subject Diary: 
• Assessment of 5 influenza symptoms [cough, rhinitis, feverishness, malaise alternating 
with irritability and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting or diarrhea) ] on a 
4-point severity scale (0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe) twice daily, beginning 
pre-dose on Day 1 until symptom resolution or through the last follow -up visit, 
(whichever comes first).  
An adequate nasal swab specimen  will be collected from all enrolled subjects  at Baseline 
(pre-dose) for virus sub- type identification and quantitative vir ologic assessments and at the 
follow-up assessments on study Days 3, 7, and where possible on Day 14. 
Specimens from all subjects yielding influenza virus will also be assessed for susceptibility to 
neuraminidase inhibitors (Day 1 and last specimen yielding influenza virus on culture). A central laboratory will perform all virologic assessments.  
Plasma samples for determination of drug concentration on subjects randomized to peramivir will be drawn as follows: 
Up to 4 blood samples will be drawn, where possible, during the following time periods, beginning from the end of dosing until release from the site:  
• One time point immediately following completion of the infusion  
• One time point from 30 minutes to 1 hour post-infusion 
• One time point from 1 hour to 3 hours post-infusion  
• One time point from 3 to 6 hours post-infusion 
Note: Subjects ≥ 5 kg will have four 1.0 mL blood draws at the above stated sampling times. Subjects < 5 kg will have two 1.0 mL blood samples; one time immediately following completion of the infusion and one time between 1-3 hours post-infusion. Adverse events and 
concomitant medications will be monitored at each scheduled visit from the Screening/ Baseline assessment to final study visit. Clinical laboratory investigations 
(chemistries, hematology, and urinalysis) will be collected at Baseline and at the Day 7  visit. 
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated through assessments of adverse events, laboratory analyses (clinical chemistry, hematology, an d urinalysis), vital signs and physical 
examinations at the time points indicated in the schedule of assess ments.  
Number of subjects (planned):  
Up to 140 subjects will be enrolled in this study according to the following age groups: 
• Birth to <  28 days: up to 10 subjects will receive  IV peramivir

Criteria for evaluation: 
Safety: 
• Safety will be evaluated through assessments of Adverse Events (AEs), laboratory 
analyses (clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis), vital signs, and physical examinations. A review and summary of safety utilizing all collected assessments will 
be pe rformed by a Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  after each influenza 
season as outlined in the DSMC charter.   
Pharmacokinetic:  
• Plasma peramivir concentrations will be measured by a validated liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS -MS) as say. Concentrations will 
be utilized in determination of population pharmacokinetic parameters. 
Effectiveness:  
• Clinical:  Time to resolution of fever ; time to resolution of influenza symptoms (per 
the age appropriate symptoms); 
• Virologic:  Viral shedding; vi rus susceptibility.  
Statistical methods:  
Sample Size:  
The study is designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of IV administration of peramivir in pediatric subjects with influenza. The sample size is adequate to evaluate these objectives. Descriptive comparison between peramivir and oseltamivir treated subjects will be performed where possible. Formal hypothesis testing will not be performed. 
Safety:  Qualitative analyses will be performed for AE type, frequency and severity, as well as vital 
sign absolute values, clinical laboratory absolute values, and physical examination findings and their respective changes from Baseline for all subjects.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Plasma concentrations and covariates of interest will be evaluated in a meta -population 
analysis using mixed effect modeling techniques to estimate p opulation pharmacokinetic 
parameters in each age group and to identify pharmacokinetically -relevant covariates. Data 
from the completed pediatric study 0918T0633 of IV peramivir in Japan will be included in this analysis . 
Effectiveness : 
Clinical and virologic endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics.

 18 5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Influenza Overview  
Influenza virus is a member of the orthomyxovirus family and causes an acute viral disease of 
the respiratory tract. Typical influenza illness is characterized by abrupt onset of fever, headache, 
myalgia, sore throat, and nonproductive cough ( Cox and Subbarao 1999) ; a  significant minority 
of patients also experience gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea ( Novel 
Swine -Origin Influenza, Dawood et al. 2009 ). Acute uncomplicated influenza is characterized 
bronchoscopically by diffuse inflammation and edema of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi; 
mucosal biopsies show lymphocytic and histiocytic inflammatory infiltrate and desquamation (Walsh, Dietlein et al. 1961).  
While the highest morbidity and mortality occurs in the elde rly, the highest rate of infection 
occurs in children ( Fiore, Timothy et al. 2012). In healthy adults  and children, the illness is 
usually self -limiting , with  resolution of symptoms occurring within 5 to 7 days because immune 
defenses shut down viral proliferation and shedding, clearing infected cells quickly . In acute 
uncomplicated influenza, tissue damage is limited, and secondary infections are uncommon. However, influenza is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in certain at- risk 
populations, and hospital admissions due to influenza- related illness place a seasonal burden on 
health care facilities.  Furthermore, the symptoms of acute uncomplicated influenza are 
themselves debilitating, with return to normal health and activities delaye d for 7 to 11 days 
(Treanor, Hayden et al. 2000, Kohno, Kida et al. 2010) . 
The emergence in 2009 of a novel strain of influenza A (H1N1pdm09), reviewed in ( Neumann, 
Noda et al. 2009), led to the first influenza pandemic since the 1960’s. The well -documented 
morbidity and mortality from the 2009 influenza pandemic, and the emergence of two avian influenza viruses infecting humans in recent years, A/H5N1 ( Writing Committee of the Second 
World Health Organization Consultation on Clinical Aspects of Human Infection with Avian 
Influenza, Abdel-Ghafar et al. 2008) and  A/H7N9 (CDC 2013, Gao, Cao et al. 2013) , serve to 
emphasize the continuing threat that influenza poses to publi c health as a result of emergence of 
new viral strains infecting populations with limited herd immunity to influenza in children. 
Children are subject to a high burden of influenza related disease. Despite the US Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC’s ) recommendation that all children 6 months and older 
get vaccinated against seasonal influenza, in the 2012 - 2013 influenza season only 57% of 
children 6 months to 17 years received vaccination. Coverage was highest in infants and toddlers 
6 months to 23 months at 77%, but declined progressively in each subsequent age group. Only 43% of 13- 17 adolescents received vaccination (CDC 2013).  
Because testing for influenza is not uniformly performed and there are other viruses that can 
cause lower respiratory tract disease, namely respiratory s yncytial  virus and parainfluenza virus, 
it is difficult to know how many children are infected yearly. A population- based surveillance 
study in cohorts of children ≤ 5 years across 3 counties in the United States (US) over the 2004-2009 influenza seasons was performed, capturing the time period when vaccine recommendations were expanded down to infants 6 months and older ( Poehling, Edwards et al. 
2013) . It was estimated that the  rate of hospitalization for influenza was 0.4-1.0 per 
1000 children ≤ 5 years. Confirmed influenza infection in the outpatient setting was present in 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 19 8-17% of enrolled children who presented for a visit. The rate was somewhat higher in children 
seen in th e emergency department (12%) than in an outpatient clinic (10%). Influenza A was the 
predominant pathogen causing 70% of influenza infections. Less than half of the infected 
children had been immunized.  
In Europe, a review of the literature from 1970 to 2011 determined that the incidence of 
influenza was 6.2% in infants ≤ 1 year and 16.7% in all children ≤ 13 years. The rate of hospitalization for influenza was similar to Poehling’s US estimate with varying rates among 
different European countries ranging from 1.5% (for children < 2 years), 0.7% (2- 5 years), and 
0.4% (6-13 years) in Italy to 0.8% (< 3 years), 0% (3-6 years), and 0% (7-13 years) in Finland 
(Antonova, Rycroft et al. 2012). Globally, in 2008, about 90 million new cases of influenza and 
20 million episodes of influenza- associated acute lower respiratory tract infection occurred 
worldwide in children aged 0-4 years. That year, estimated deaths worldwide from influenza in children were 28,000 to 111,500 ( Nair, Brooks et al. 2011). 
Medical resources are highly utilized by children with influenza, due to both initial visits and subsequent complications. Complications of influenza are common, including pharyngitis, otitis media and  febrile seizures. While rates vary, some studies have found that almost half of all 
infections result in bacterial superinfections or seizures ( Antonova, Rycroft et al. 2012) . In 
addition, children miss time from school and parents lose time from work.  An estimated 1 to 6 days of work are lost by parents caring for children ill with an influenza episode ( Neuzil, 
Hohlbein et al. 2002, Heikkinen, Silvennoinen et al. 2004, Antonova, Rycroft et al. 2012) .
 
During pandemic years, the incidence of influenza increases and may affect children more than older patients. More severe illness and young adult age distribution are consistent features of 
pandemic influenza, and are linked to more severe lower respiratory tract involvement. Influenza 
viral pneumonia is more frequent in pandemics ( Oseasohn, Adelson et al. 1959, Rello and Pop-
Vicas 2009)  compared to seasonal epidemics, and more common in children and young adults 
compared to older patients, most likely related to lack of specific immunity to the newly circulating pandemic strain in those age groups. During the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic, 4 times the average number of US children died compared to the previous 5 influenza seasons, rising from an average 82 annually to 344 ( Garg, Fry et al. 2012). 
Despite increased vaccination efforts and expanded vaccination recommendations, seasonal and pandemic influenza remain significant causes of morbidity and mortality in children, particularly in those less than 2 years of age and those with comorbidities.  
5.2. Antiviral therapy for influenza  
Two classes of influenza antiviral agents are currently approved  in the United S tates: 
adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs). Adamantane antivirals include amantadine, 
which is approved to treat influenza in adults and children ≥ 1 year old and rimantadine, 
approved to treat influenza in adults and children ≥ 13 year old. The neuraminidase inhibitors include oseltamivir, which is currently approved for adults and children ≥ 2 weeks of age and zanamivir, an inhaled product, which is approved for adults and children down to age 7.  
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 20 5.2.1. Treatment in adults  
Adamantanes , including amantadine and rimantadine,  are thought to interact with the M2 ion 
channel virus protein. Adamantanes have no activity against influenza B virus. When 
administered within 48 hours of illness onset, amantadine can reduce the severity and shorten the duration of acute uncomplicated influenza A illness among healthy adults. In  recent years 
widespread resistance to adamantanes has been described in viruses of the H3N2 sub- type 
(Bright, Medina et al. 2005), and the influenza A (H1N1pdm09) strain also demonstrated 
adamantane resistance. This class of drugs is currently  not recommended by the CDC for 
treatment of influenza (CDC 2014). 
Neuraminidase inhibitors are a newer class  of drugs with activity against both influenza A and 
influenza B viruses. Approved neuraminidase inhibitors include zanamivir (ZNR), administered 
by inhalation, and oseltamivir  phosphate (OSE), an oral prodrug of the active agent, oseltamivir 
carboxylate ( OSE -C). Neither product is specifically approved for use in hospitalized influenza, 
although oseltamivir is used frequently in both hospitalized adults and children. Influenza neuraminidase is responsible for the release of new viral particles from infected cells and may 
also assist in the spreading of virus through the mucus within the respiratory tract. When administered within 48  hours of illness onset, neuraminidase inhibitors can reduce the severity 
and shorten the duration of acute uncomplicated influ enza illness among  previously healthy 
adults and children. 
There is disagreement on the degree of benefit risk provided by NAIs. A 2012 systematic 
meta -analysis (Hsu, Santesso et al. 2012) supports the conclusion that early treatment with 
neuraminidase inhibitors such as OSE is associated with reduced mortality and reduced rates of 
hospital admission. Another independent meta-a nalysis of 11 randomized clinical trials also 
found that oseltamivir reduced the risk of lower respiratory tract complications and the use of antibiotics (Hernan and Lipsitch 2011) .Mortality benefits were supported by a meta- analysis of 
hospitalized patients with H1N1 pandemic influenza, although the benefit was not seen in 
children ( Muthuri, Venkatesan et al. 2014 ).This is in contrast to 2 Cochran reviews, one 
reviewing both OSE and ZNR ( Jefferson, Jones et al. 2009) and a more recent review focused on 
OSE (Jefferson, Jones et al. 2014) , that found only modest efficacy as measured by time to 
alleviation of symptoms and no reduction in lower respiratory tract complications. The 2014 
review indicated that while there was modest efficacy in healthy adults and children, children with asthma did not benefit. There was no change in the hospital admission rate for adults and 
insufficient data in children. While OSE did appear to reduce the incidence of unverified 
pneumonia in adult s, there was no decrease in the incidence for children. The review also 
asserted that there was no decrease in the common complications of influenza such as bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis.  
The CDC responded ( CDC 2014) by reiterating their recommendation of the use of antiviral 
treatment of patients with influenza in certain populations.  
The CDC recommendation is as follows:  
Antiviral treatment is recommended as early as possible for any patient with confirmed or suspected influenza who is hospitalized; has severe, complicated, or progressive illness; 
or is at higher risk for influenza complications. Persons at higher risk for influenza 
complications recommended for antiviral treatment include: children aged younger than 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 21 2 years; adults aged 65 years and older; persons with chronic pulmonary (including 
asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension alone), renal, hepatic, hematological 
(including sickle cell disease), metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus), or neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions (including disorders of the brain, spinal 
cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy [seizure disorders], 
stroke, intellectual disability [mental retardation], moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury); persons with immunosuppression, 
including that caused by medicatio ns or by human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) 
infection; women who are pregnant or postpartum (within 2 weeks after delivery); 
persons aged younger than 19 years who are receiving long- term aspirin therapy; 
American Indians/Alaska Natives; persons who are morbidly obese (i.e., body- mass 
index is equal to or greater than 40); and residents of nursing homes and other chronic- care facilities.  
It is apparent that the definitions of high risk in this context is empirical, and subject to further modifications as ad ditional risk factors are identified in seasonal and pandemic influenza 
outbreaks. 
5.2.2. Treatment in children  
Adamantane antivirals, although approved for use in children ≥ 1 year old (amantadine) and 
≥ 13 year old (rimantadine) are not recommended for either treatment or prophylaxis due to widespread resistance and lack of activity against influenza B. Zanamivir is approved for 
treatment of influenza in children ≥ 7 years old but is not recommended in those with an 
underlying respiratory disease such as asthma because of the inhaled route of administration. 
Oseltamivir is approved for use in infants as young as 2 weeks of age for the treatment of influenza. 
Prior to the 2009-2010 pandemic, fewer than 1% of children with influenza were treated with 
antiviral agen ts. Even among children hospitalized for influenza, only 2% to 37% ( Garg, Fry et 
al. 2012, Poehling, Edwards et al. 2013)  received an antiviral agent. During the pandemic, 
treatment rates increased markedly and 74% of hospitalized children were treated (Garg, Fry et 
al. 2012). At the time of the pandemic, OSE was approved for children aged ≥ 1 year and ZNR 
was approved for children aged ≥ 7 years. Subsequently, in 2012, OSE received approval for use 
in infants as young as 2 weeks old (Tamiflu® package insert, 2012). It is not clear if these 
increased rates of treatment have been maintained since the pandemic.  
Recommendations regarding the use of antiviral agents were broadened after the H1N1 pandemic. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)  produced guidelines in 
2011 for the use of antiviral agents in influenza. ACIP recommended that antiviral therapy (NAIs 
but not adamantanes) be initiated as soon as possible for any patients with confirmed or 
suspected influenza with high severity, hospit alization or risk of complications. Use of antiviral 
therapy in the outpatient setting when risk factors were not present was left to clinical judgment as long as therapy could be initiated within 48 hours ( Fiore, Fry et al. 2011). 
The most recent American Academy of Pediat rics (AAP) ( Pediatrics 2008 ) guidelines for the 
2013-2014 influenza season are similar to and complement the ACIP’s recommendations. The 
AAP reiterates that oseltamivir remains the drug of choice, simply because zan amivir is difficult 
to administer in children. Any child hospitalized or at increased risk of complications (see 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 22 Section  5.3.1) should receive antiviral therapy, even if influenza is only suspected but not proven 
and even if the patients present later than 48 hours after onset of symptoms. While the AAP 
acknowledges that most patients with uncomplicated influenza do not require treatment due to the self -limited nature of the infection, treatment should be offered to any child who would 
benefit from a decrease in duration of the clinical symptoms (Brady, Byington et al. 2013). 
Just as with adults, the use of antiviral therapy (primarily OSE) in children has been demonstrated to shorten disease duration, improve complications, and reduce hospital stays.  The 
length of illness is significantly reduced by 1.25 to 1.5 days in health children with confirmed 
influenza. Complications, particularly otitis media in children less than 5 year of age, are reduced 
with NAI therapy by 44-85%. Not surprisingly, the use of antibiotics is also reduced when NAIs 
are initiated promptly (Garg, Fry et al. 2012). In children hospitalized with influenza, if OSE was 
started within 24 hours of admission, length of stay was reduced by 18%. Intensive care unit 
(ICU) stay, mortality during hospitalization and readmission within 1 week of discharge were not 
statistically significantly different in OSE -treated and untreated subjects, which indicates that 
further study is needed regarding optimal inpatient treatment of children with influenza (Coffin, 
Leckerman et al. 2011). 
5.2.3. Current need  
Although OSE, an oral neuraminidase inhibitor pro- drug administered twice daily for 5 days, is 
widely used for the treatment of influenza, a need still exists for an effective treatment for adult 
and pediatric influenza patients who present in the urgent care, emergency department and in the 
hospital who may not be able to tolerate an oral or inhaled product, or where compliance with a 
5-day treatment regimen is a concern. Such patients may include those who cannot comply with oral medications, those with poor history of compliance with oral medicines, those with 
gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea associated with influenza that could 
impair absorption of orally administered drugs, and those with gastrointestinal diseases that 
could impair drug absorption.  
5.3. Previous Experience with Peramivir  
BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its partner, Shionogi & Co., Ltd have completed a total of ten Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of peramivir in the treatment of influenza. Seven studies exclusively or predominantly enrolled patients with acute 
uncomplicated influenza, including 1 in children. The remaining 3 studies were conducted in 
subjects who were hospitalized with influenza, 2 of which allowed children or adolescents to 
enroll. A thorough QT/QTc study of single intravenous doses of peramivir in healthy adult 
subjects (Study BCX1812-106) demonstrated that intravenous peramivir at a therapeutic dose of 
600 mg and at a supratherapeutic dose of 1200 mg was not associated with QTc prolongation or other repolarization abnormalities.  
During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, before the peramivir Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) was issued by the US FDA, BioCryst was providing peramivir to subjects under emergency investigational new drug ( EIND ) regulations, by request from US ph ysicians. Ultimately, 
31 patients received peramivir of which 11 were children. The youngest patient was a 3-month-old girl who was critically ill with influenza, requiring mechanical ventilation and ultimately extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). She also went into renal failure and required 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 23 continuous veno- venous hemofiltration. It was noted that cardiac contractility markedly 
improved with peramivir treatment and she ultimately recovered. There were 2 young children 
treated, a 5 -year-old boy and an 8 year old boy, both of whom died. The 5 year old had been 
hospitalized for 16 days prior to initiation of 10 days of peramivir. He was receiving ECMO and 
was comatose with heart failure. The patient died on hospital Day 34 when medical support was 
withdrawn. The 8- year-old boy had numerous underlying medical problems including Noonan 
syndrome with congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension. He had a cardiac arrest at 
the time of hospitalization and was on ECMO when peramivir was initiated on hospital Day 10. 
His respiratory status improved on hospital Day 14 but due to severe cerebral  ischemia, the 
family withdrew medical support and he died on hospital Day 35.  
There were 8 children aged 10-17 treated under the EIND. A 13 year old boy with a history of 
asthma died despite improvement in respiratory and hemodynamic parameters after peramivir treatment. A 14 -year-old girl with asthma and chronic renal failure also died. The 6 other 
patients recovered although they all had respiratory failure and were on mechanical ventilation or ECMO, 5  were receiving vasopressor support, and 2 had renal failure. Therapeutic drug 
monitoring was completed on some of these subjects and the exposure with the 10 mg/kg daily 
dose w as similar to those of adults receiving 600 mg/day  (Hernandez, Adiga et al. 2011). Similar 
to the Japanese pediatric and adolescent experience, no unique safety concerns were identified in 
this series.  
During the 2009 pandemic, the US FDA also issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for 
IV peramivir to tre at suspected or confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection ( Sorbello, 
Jones et al. 2012). Peramivir was provided in response to over 1300 requests, including for 
children and adolescents. While data are not available on the number of critically ill children 
treated u nder the EUA, FDA received adverse event reports on 28 pediatric patients < 18 years.  
In addition to clinical trial experience and emergency use experience, peramivir has been 
approved in Japan for use in children ≥ 28 days old infected with influenza with over 
1,000,000 patient exposures, which includes a large proportion of children. A pediatric post-approval observational safety and effectiveness surveillance study was carried out in Japan 
between October 2010 and February  2012 in a routine pediatric setting and evaluated patients    
< 15 years of age. A total of 1 ,254 patients were evaluated at 1 73 institutions in Japan .  This 
study is described more fully in Section 5.3.3. 
5.3.1. Clinical experience in adults  
The pivotal study for the use of IV peramivir to treat subjects with acute uncomplicated 
influenza is Study 0722T0621, a Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose study that enrolled 300 Japanese adult subjects with confirmed influenza. Both dosages of peramivir 
evaluated (single IV doses of 300 or 600 mg) significantly shortened the time to alleviation of 
influenza symptoms (duration of influenza, the primary endpoint) compared with placebo. 
Studies BCX1812-211, BCX1812-311, and BCX1812-212 provide supportive data for the use of 
single parenteral doses of peramivir to treat influenza in the outpatient setting; in these studies, 
peramivir was administered as a sin gle dose via bilateral intramuscular (IM) injections to 
subjects with influenza. Exposure to peramivir by IM administration is bioequivalent to exposure from IV admin istration (BCX1812-111 and BCX1812-113). 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 24 Study BCX1812-211 was a Phase 2, randomized study that enrolled 344 subjects with acute, 
uncomplicated influenza who received placebo, 150 mg peramivir or 300 mg peramivir as a 
single, divided IM dose. Study BCX1812-311 was similar in design and was planne d as a 
Phase 3 study, but was terminated early after 82 subjects had enrolled and were randomized 2:1 
to receive placebo or 300 mg peramivir in a single, divided IM dose. The study was terminated 
in order to study higher doses using a product with a higher concentration in subsequent studies. These 2  studies had almost identical eligibility criteria, had identical primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints, and were conducted in successive influenza seasons. When the results from studies BCX1812-211 and BCX1812-311 were retrospectively combined in a post- hoc analysis, 
both primary and secondary endpoints for peramivir- treated subjects were improved compared to 
placebo.  
Study BCX1812-212 was a placebo-controlled study of 405 subjects who were randomized 1:1 
to receive either placebo or 600 mg of peramivir as a single divided IM dose. This study was 
conducted during a season in which the dominant circulating strain of influenza A showed 
reduced susceptibility to peramivir, and the results showed a non- significan t trend favoring 
peramivir in the primary endpoint of time to alleviation of symptoms.  
Two additional outpatient studies in adults occurred. Study 0815T0631 was a double-blind, double-dummy study of 1099 subjects from Japan, Taiwan and South Korea who were randomized to receive a single dose of IV peramivir (300 mg or 600 mg) or 5 days of oral OSE 
BID. For the primary endpoint of time to alleviation of symptoms, both peramivir treatment 
regimens were non -inferior to OSE. Study 0816T0632 was a double-blind, non-controlled study 
in high-risk patients with influenza; in this study, the duration of influenza illness was shorter 
among subjects who received 600 mg doses of peramivir compared with those in the 300 mg 
treatment group, although the 90% confidence int ervals (CI) overlapped.  
Hospitalized influenza was studied in BCX1812-201, a randomized, double-blind, trial of 
treatment with OSE  75 mg twice daily for 5 days, or IV peramivir 200 mg once daily, or 400 mg 
once daily. The study enrolled 122 evaluable subjects and employed an exploratory primary 
endpoint of “time to clinical stability .” Compared to oral OSE  given for 5 days, IV doses of 
peramivir 200 mg and 400 mg had similar effects on the novel exploratory endpoint. Among the secondary endpoints, the medi an time to resumption of ability to perform usual activities was 
approximately 4 days shorter for subjects treated with either dose of peramivir compared with 
OSE . Viral titers decreased rapidly among patients with influenza A after treatment with either 
OSE 75 mg twice daily or peramivir 200  mg or 400 mg daily. Among subjects with influenza B, 
numerical trends suggest more rapid reduction in viral titer with peramivir than OSE  and greater 
activity of peramivir 400  mg than peramivir 200 mg.  
During the 2009-2010 pandemic, BCX1812-303, an open- label Phase 3 study of peramivir 
300 mg BID or 600 mg once daily (QD) enrolled 230 evaluable adult and 4 evaluable adolescent 
hospitalized subjects with confirmed or suspected influenza infection. The primary endpoint was 
the reduction in influenza virus titer measured by log
1050% tissue culture infective 
dose (TCID 50). There were no differences in either the mean or median values in the 300 mg BID 
or 600 mg QD treatment groups. By 48 hours after the beginning of peramivir treatment, 86% of all subjects with positive baseline titers in the intent to treat infected (ITTI)population had a 
negative virus titer (80% in the 300 mg BID group and 91% in the 600 mg QD group, as measured by log
10 TCID 50.

 25 BCX1812-301, a P hase 3, m ulticenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled- study of peramivir 
evaluated the efficacy and safety of peramivir administered IV in addition to standard of care 
compared to standard of care alone in subjects who were hospitalized due to influenza. The st udy 
failed to demonstrate a significant difference between treatment with placebo and standard of 
care and treatment with peramivir (600 mg IV, daily for 5 or 10 days) and standard of care for 
the primary endpoint of time to clinical resolution. A futility  analysis was performed,  and the 
study was terminated early at which point 338 evaluable (i.e. ITTI) subjects were enrolled (116 randomized to placebo and 222 randomized to peramivir).  
Safety of various doses of peramivir in acute uncomplicated influenza has been evaluated in 
1453 adults. The most frequently observed treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) across all adult 
subjects with acute uncomplicated influenza treated with various doses of peramivir were 
diarrhea (7.4%), decreased neutrophil count (5.5%), and increased blood glucose (5.0%).  The only events reported in ≥ 2% of subjects treated with peramivir 600 mg and for which the rate 
was greater than placebo were diarrhea (7.6% vs. placebo 7.0%), decreased neutrophil count 
(5.7% vs. placebo 0.0%), hyperglycemia (5.3% vs. placebo 4.8%) and urine leukocytes (2.8% vs. placebo  1.8%). Adverse event rates overall were similar to placebo and OSE. No safety signals 
have emerged from these trials.  
The safety of various doses of peramivir in hospitalized influenza ha s been evaluated in 
355 adults in studies with active or placebo control (BCX1812-201 and 301) and 230 adults in an 
open label study with 2 different peramivir dosing regimens (BCX1812-303). The hospitalized 
population was comprised of acutely ill subject; many critically ill infected with both pandemic and seasonal influenza strains. Overall, peramivir had a favorable safety profile. In controlled 
trials,  the most common adverse events in patients receiving various doses of peramivir with and 
without other NAIs were diarrhea (6.8%), nausea (4.8%), and insomnia (3.9%).The only events 
reported in ≥ 2% of subjects treated with peramivir 600 mg monotherapy (no additional NAI) 
and for which the rate was greater than placebo were constipation (4.0% vs. placebo 2.0%), 
elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (4.0% vs. placebo 0%), insomnia (3.0% vs. 0%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increase  (3.0% vs. placebo 2.0%), hypertension (2.0 vs. placebo 0%) and hypokalemia (1.0% vs. placebo 0%). 
In the open label trial, subjects in both arms receive a total daily dose of 600 mg peramivir (or 
equivalent in those subjects with renal function adjusted dosing). This trial ran from 
October  2009 to October 2010 and enrolled primarily subjects infected with pandemic H1N1 
virus (74% of the ITTI population). A total of 10% of all subjects in the Safety population died. 
Nearly half of all deaths were related to respiratory failure reflecting the severity of the 
pandemic. Most adverse events were attributable to the underlying infect ion and comorbidities 
and no clinically relevant differences in safety outcomes were noted between the two dosing 
regimens. The most common adverse events were constipation (13.0%), diarrhea (12.6%), 
hypokalemia (9.6%), anemia (7.8%), hypotension (7.8%), nausea (7.8%), peripheral edema 
(7.8%), insomnia (7.4%) hyperglycemia (6.1%) hypertension (6.1%) and headache (5.2%). 
5.3.2. Clinical experience in children  
There have been 3 clinical trials that enrolled children. Study 0918T0633 was an open label 
study in acute uncomplicated influenza. In addition, there were 2 studies in hospitalized 
influenza that enrolled children, BCX1812-303 and BCX1812-301.

 26 5.3.2.1. Study 0918T0633 
Study 0918T0633 was a Japanese non- controlled, open-label study conducted in pediatric 
subjects with influenza (either inpatient or outpatient) that ran from September 2009 to 
December 2009. A total of 117 subjects, aged ≥ 28 days to < 16 years, were enrolled of which the ITTI analysis set was 112.  The study excluded children with significant comorbidities such 
as encephalopathy, epilepsy, chronic respiratory disorders, congestive heart failure, immunosuppression and renal failure. Subjects were treated with peramivir 10 mg/kg (maximum dose 600 mg) IV for up to 5 days. This dose was believed to provide children with an adult 
equivalent of 300 to 600 mg peramivir a day. Two subjects received 2 doses, and the rest 
received a single infusion. The primary endpoint was the median time to alleviation of influenza 
defined as mild to no cough or nasal discharge and normal body temperature. Overall the median 
time was 27.9 hours (95% CI  21.7-31.7) with no differences noted between the age groups of 
28 days to < 2 years, 2 to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 16 years of age. Normal 
temperature of < 37.5°C was recovered in a median time of 20.4 hours (95% CI 19.1-20.9). If all 
influenza symptoms, including cough, sore throat, headache, nasal discharge, fever, 
myalgia/arthralgia and fatigue were taken into consideration, the median time to alleviation of symptoms w as 30.5 hours (95% CI 22.6-45.8) with sore throat taking the longest to resolve. The 
median time to resuming activities of daily living (ADLs) was 103.0 hours (95% CI 94.9 hours- 119.6 hours) and ranged from 54.7 hours to 126.8 hours in the consecutive age brackets.  
Adverse events were experienced by 62.4% of subjects. In the various age brackets  (28 days to 
< 2 years, 2 to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 16 years of age) the incidence for AEs ranged from 54.1 to 75% and tended to be higher for patients under 12 years. No deaths occurred but 2 subjects experienced serious adverse events (SAEs):  influenzal pneumonia in one and 
pneumonia and encephalopathy in the other. Both children recovered. Most AEs were mild to moderate (79.5%). Overall, the most frequent TEAEs were decreased neutrophil count (21.4%), diarrhea (16.2%), vomiting (9.4%), and increased eosinophil count (7.7%). Of note, there were 3 subjects (2.6%) who experienced abnormal behavior.  
5.3.2.2. BCX1812-303 
BCX1812-303 was initiated in October 2009 at the request of the FDA due to the 2009 H1N1 
pandemic. Originally allowing children ≥ 12 year old to enroll, by December 2009 the protocol 
was amended to allow children as y oung as 6 to enroll and receive 10 mg/kg day either in a 
single or divided dose. Although at the time there was no clinical data on treating children with 
peramivir, the juvenile animal toxicology studies and the experience with the EIND in which 
11 children, one as young as 3 months old, received peramivir indicated that peramivir was 
generally safe and well tolerated in children. Four adolescents were enrolled; all aged 14-16 years of age. Only 1 subject, a 14- year-old American Indian/Alaskan native girl, was 
positive for influenza (2009 H1N1 strain) and she was randomized to 5 mg/kg (195 mg) twice a day for 5  days. Her time to clinical resolution was 28.8 hours (study mean was 92 hours) and her 
time-weighted changes from Baseline in log
10 TCID 50 at 48 hours was similar to the overall 
mean and median ( -1.51). Her only AEs occurred at follow-up when she developed a mild upper 
lip lesion on study Day 11 and a mild decrease in body temperature on study Day 13. Both events were assessed as unlikely related to p eramivir and both events resolved.  
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 27 Three subjects were found to be negative for influenza. A 16- year-old Asian girl received 5 days 
of peramivir 5  mg/kg (300 mg) bid and experienced no AEs. A 15- year-old Hispanic boy 
received 5  days of 10 mg/kg (600 mg) daily and had no AEs. A 14- year-old white girl had septic 
shock at baseline and required vasopressor support. She received 5 mg/kg (260 mg) BID for 
2 days. Once her influenza results were noted to be negative, her parents withdrew consent and 
she discontinued the study. Her only AE was moderate sedation assessed as unlikely related to peramivir but due to the use of sedative drugs.  
5.3.2.3. BCX1812-301 
BCX1812-301 was initiated in November 2009 as a randomized, double-blind, controlled study 
to evaluate the efficacy  and safety of peramivir administered intravenously in addition to 
standard of care compared to standard of care alone in subjects who are hospitalized  due to 
influenza. Originally allowing children ≥ 12 year old to enroll, by August 2010 the protocol was amended to allow children as young as 6 to be randomized to placebo or 10 mg/kg/day of peramivir for those ≥ 12 to < 18 years and 12 mg/kg/day for those ≥ 6 to < 12 years. Overall 
there were 4 children 6 -11 years old and 11 adolescents 12-17 years old who enrolled. Of these 
children, 9 were randomized to peramivir (2 children and 7 adolescents). One of these subjects 
withdrew consent prior to receiving any peramivir and 1 withdrew consent on study Day 2 at the 
time of hospital discharge.  Of the 8 subjects who received peramivir, all were influenza positive: 
5 tested positive for H2N2 and 3 had the 2009 H1N1 strain. All received OSE  from the time of 
hospital admission as a part of the standard of care, except for 1 subject, a 14 year old boy with a 
history of asthma and epilepsy who received peramivir monotherapy for the first 5 days but did 
not meet the protocol defined criteria for clinical resolution. He received another 5 days of peramivir and also initiated OSE BID  for 5 days on study Day 5.  
The overall  time to clinical resolution in the pediatric population treated with peramivir 
10 mg/kg/day was a mean of 39.6 hours (range 7.9 to 85.2 hours) and time to alleviation of clinical symptoms of influenza was a mean of 81.5 hours (range 38.0 to 121.8). Time to hospital 
discharge, a tertiary endpoint, was a mean of 4.5 days (range 2.0-10.0 days). Although the study 
did not meet its overall primary endpoint and was terminated after a futility analysis, these means compare favorably to the overall results of 53.9 hours mean time to clinical resolution, 
81.3 hours mean time to alleviation of clinical symptoms and 5.3 days mean time to hospital 
discharge.  
Only 2 of the pediatric subjects experienced AEs. A 17 year old boy developed mild phlebitis on 
study Day 3 tha t was assessed by the Investigator as possibly related. He recovered in 1 day 
without sequelae. The other subject was a 16 year old  boy who developed mild nausea and mild 
gastritis on study Day 6. The nausea resolved the same day and the gastritis resolved on study Day 12. He also experienced cystitis on study Days 10-14 and laryngitis on study Days 10 to 28. 
None of the events were assessed as related to peramivir and all the events resolved.  
5.3.3. Post marketing experience in children  
Peramivir hydrate for inj ection was first approved in Japan on 13 J anuary  2010 under the trade 
name Rapiacta® by Shionogi & Co., Ltd. for the treatment of viral infection with influenza type 
A and type B. Marketing authorization for the treatment  of children and infants ≥ 28 days of age 
was obtained in Japan in October, 2010. Since that time 3 post marketing surveillance studies 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 28 have been performed, including one exclusively enrolling pediatric patients. The other 2 studies 
(one in routine use and one in high risk patients) allowed enrollment of subjects ≥ 15 years old 
and any age child respectively.   
The pediatric post-approval observational safety and effectiveness surveillance study was carried 
out between October 2010 and February  2012 in a ro utine pediatric setting and evaluated patients 
< 15 years of age. A total of 1 ,254 patients were evaluated at 1 73 institutions in Japan. The 
safety evaluable population was 1 ,199 and the efficacy evaluable population was 1186. Most 
patients (79.4%) had type A influenza and 13.2% of the patients were considered high risk. 
There were 654 (54.5%) male and 545 (45.5%) female patients in the safety evaluable group. 
Fifty -four patients (4.5%) were < 1 year of age, including 1 patient who was < 4 weeks of age. 
Forty-four percent of the patients (527) were ≥ 1 to < 7 years of age, and 51.4% (616 patients) 
were ≥ 7 to < 15 years of age. A special safety analysis compared patients < 2 years of age and those ≥ 2 years of age, and found that there were no significant di fferences in the incidence of 
AEs or the types of AEs in infants and toddlers versus older children. 
Almost all patients (1008, 84.1%) received peramivir within 1 day of the start of influenza symptoms. Most patients were treated in an outpatient setting, but 138 (11.5%) were hospitalized 
for influenza, and 11 patients had serious influenza, defined as either influenza encephalopathy or the need for mechanical ventilation. Almost all patients (96.7%) received only 1 day of treatment with peramivir.   
A tota l of 92 patients experienced 115 AEs deemed related to peramivir by the prescribing 
physicians. There were no fatal AEs reported. Fourteen of the AEs were serious including 5 SAEs of abnormal behavior, 5 SAEs of neutropenia (2 severe), and individual SAEs of loss of 
consciousness, erythema multiforme, rash, and peripheral edema. The events of erythema 
multiforme  occurred in a child with  ocular pruritus prior to peramivir treatment. After  treatment 
with peramivir , a rash developed on his face, neck, hands, and buttocks. He was treated with an  
anti-allergy medication but symptoms worsened 2 days after receiving peramivir , and the patient 
was diagnosed with exudative erythema multiform e. The event resolved with topical steroids and 
anti-allergy medication  in 4 days.  
Most of the AEs (87.0%) occurred within 3 days after the start of treatment with peramivir. Almost all AEs recovered or improved (93.9%), the rest had unknown outcomes. The AE durations were brief, with 80.9% resolving or improving within 3 days of onset. The most 
common AEs were diarrhea (2.5%) , abnormal behavior (2.3%) , vomiting ( 0.7% ), and nausea 
(0.7%). Over half of the events of abnormal behavior occurred in children with either high risk 
factors or complication of influenza such as seizures or bacterial infections. There were no 
noticeable differences in AE incidence between the various pediatric age ranges. The sole 
enrolled newborn (< 4 weeks of age) did not experience any AEs. Patients aged ≥ 4 weeks to < 1 year had a 9.4% incidence of AEs; t hose ≥ 1 to < 7 years of age had a 7.2% incidence of 
AEs; and children ≥ 7 to < 15 years of age had an 8.0% incidence of AEs.  
The reported adverse events were similar  to events seen during development. There was a lower 
incidence of adverse events and no individual events were reported at an incidence greater than 
that during development. No new safety signals were found as a result of this post-approval 
safety surveillance study.  
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

 29 Effectiveness was assessed by time to alleviation of symptoms, which represented the day when 
all 7 symptoms of influenza (cough, sore throat, headache, nasal congestion, fever, achiness, and 
fatigue) were reported as none or mild. The median  time to alleviation of symptoms was 3 days. 
The median time to resolution of fever was also 3 days. Since the assessment of symptoms and 
temperature was done only once daily, the actual time to resolution may have been less than 
reported.  
In the routine use post-approval observational safety and effectiveness  surveillance study, the 
safety set included 69 children < 15 years old. The AE incidence was 7.3% compared to the adult 
population’s rate of 4.1%, However, there were only 6 AEs reports in total; diarrhe a (3 events), 
vomiting, insomnia, and urticaria. The median time to alleviation of symptoms (same definition 
as used in the pediatric post-approval study) was 3 days and the median time to resolution of 
fever was 2 days. Overall, the adverse events and effectiveness measure was similar to previous investigations. There were no new safety signals found as a result of this post-approval study of routine peramivir use.  
In the high risk post-approval observational safety and effectiveness surveillance study th ere 
were 181 children < 15 years old evaluated of which 26 were < 2 years  old. All the children had 
high-risk co -morbidities. Overall, the incidence of AEs was 7.2% in children < 15 years old. The 
median time to alleviation of symptoms was 3.0 days and the median time to resolution of fever 
was also 3.0 days. Patients ≥ 15 to < 65 years old had an AE incidence of 15.2% and those 
≥ 65 years old had an incidence of 14.0%. The pediatric effectiveness measures were identical to 
both the adult (15 to < 65 years old) and elderly (≥ 65 years old) populations.  
Children < 2 years of age had additional analyses. The only AE in a child < 2 years of age was a 
SAE of neutropenia occurring in a low-birth weight infant with a history of neonatal asphyxia 
and intracranial hemorrhage with resultant hydrocephalus who developed a neutrophil count of 
636/μL 3 days after receiving  peramivir . The event resolved 2 months later without treatment. 
The median time to alleviation of symptoms was 3.5 days and the median time to resolution of fever was 2.0 days in this subgroup of children < 2 years of age. Overall, the adverse events and effectiveness outcomes were similar to previous investigations, despite this being a high risk 
population. There were no new safety signals found as a result of this post-approval study of 
peramivir use in high- risk patients.  
5.4. Rationale for Study  
There remains a significant unmet need for influenza therapies in children. Currently, the only 
available options are oral or inhalation, both of which have limitations, both in terms of 
administration and viral resistance. Peramivir has demonstrated efficacy and safety when used in 
acute uncomplicated influenza in adults. However, there is significant clinical and real world 
experience with pediatric use indicati ng that there is both efficacy and safety when used in  
healthy and high-risk children as young as  28 days . Most children treated to date have been 
Asian, so the current study will provide valuable information in other racial and ethnic groups.  
Because chi ldren bear a larger burden of infection during seasonal influenza and are at greater 
risk for complications during pandemics, new treatments for children are needed. During the last 
pandemic of 2009-2010, the rates of hospitalization, admission to intensive care units, and 
invasive life support were higher than for past seasonal influenza with the highest proportion of 
seriously ill patients being children and young adults ( Dominguez-Cherit, Lapinsky et al. 2009, 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 30 Jain, Kamimoto et al. 2009, WHO 2009) . The approved dose of peramivir in adults is a single 
dose of 600 mg because of improved efficacy without an increase in safety risk . Population 
pharmacokinetic modeling performed by the FDA (July 2009) based on the Shionogi Studies 
0816T0633 (children and adolescents) and 0722T0621 (adults) supports a target dose of 
12 mg/kg/day in children (6 to 12 years) to attain exposures similar to that in adults who receive 
a 600 mg IV dose.  
In order to provide recommendations for dosing in subjects less than 6 months of age, an updated 
population PK model was developed that included all available data from adult and pediatric 
studies, and data from an  interim review of BCX1812-305.  S imulations from this model indicate 
that a dose of 8 mg/kg/day in children from birth to < 6 months of age should provide exposure 
of peramivir similar to that observed in adult subjects and pediatric subjects who have completed 
BCX1812-305. In subjects 6 month of age and older, a 12 mg/kg dose is simulated to attain exposures in pediatric subjects similar to that in adults administered a 600 mg IV dose.   
Simulations indicate that in subjects < 6 months of age, the predicted exposure following an 8 
mg/kg dose will not exceed that of adults.     
There is ample clinical and real world experience with peramivir. A large number of children 
have been treated in post- marketing without new safety signals arising, other than those already 
identified with other NAIs. Events of abnormal behavior have been reported occurring primarily 
in children and the elderly, often in those with underlying neurologic conditions. In addition, 
very rare  hypersensitivity reactions including, anaphylaxis, erythema multiforme and Stevens-
Johnson Syndrome have occurred in the post- marketing setting, although as with all NAIs,  it is 
difficult to know if this is due to concomitant medications, the viral infection, or the NAI. Many studies have reported benefits of NAIs in shortening complications, hospital stays and antibiotic 
use. Overall it is expected that the benefit risk ra tio of peramivir will be favorable in children.

35 5 The screening temperature may be performed per the site’s standard method, which will be recorded. For subsequent visits, the  parent/ guardian  will record oral or axillary temperature with the 
electronic thermometer provided by BioCryst, Thereafter, the parent/caregiver will record temperature in the Subject Diary ap proximately every 12  hours until temperature  is normal for 48 hours 
without antipyretic.  
6 If an IRC is suspected, then a targeted physical examination  and if needed, diagnostic testing will be conducted to record the actual presence/absence of the IRC. 
7 Vital sign measures will include blood pressure  (in children <2 only if clinically indicated) , pulse rate, and respiration  rate. Vital signs will be recorded at Baseline, and vital signs will be taken once 
on remaining study visit days.  
8 Antipyretic medications will be recorded in the Subject D iary by the parent/caregiver daily from Day 1 through Day 14.  
9 Clinical laboratory assessmen ts performed at Baseline are for the purpose of establishing a baseline. Subjects may be enrolled and begin treatment with study drug prior to receiving results.  
10 The severity of age appropriate influenza signs and symptoms  will be re corded by the parent/caregiver in the Subject Diary twice daily, until all symptoms are resolved (Grade 0).  Assessments of 
activities of daily living and eating habits will be recorded once daily until all symptoms are resolved.  
11 On Day 1, the parents/caregivers  of subjects and/or adolescent subjects  are to be provided training by the study staff on complet ing the Subject Diary . Instructions will be reviewed  with the 
adolescent subject or parent/caregiver  at each study visi t.  
12 Swabs for virology analysis will be collected on Day 14 where possible.  
13 Only for those subjects randomized to peramivir. The parents/caregivers  of subjects randomized to the oral oseltamivir arm of the study, will record the date and time of each drug administration, 
from Day 1  until Day 5 (or last scheduled dose).  The first dosing will be administered at the site and documented by the study staff following completion of required predose activities.    
14 A single serum specimen will be collected, where possible, pre- dose on Da y 1 and on Day 7 for analysis of influenza antibody titers. Subjects whose weight is < 10kg do not require a serum 
antibody sample . 
15 Only for those subjects randomized to peramivir. A PK sample will be drawn immediately following the end of study drug infusi on/administration, between 30 minutes to 1 hour post -infusion, 
between 1 and 3 hours post -infusion, and between 3 and 6 hours post -infusion.  Note: Subjects ≥ 5 kg will have four 1.0 mL blood draws at the above stated sampling times. Subjects < 5 kg will 
have two 1.0 mL blood samples; one time immediately following completion of the infusion and one time between 1 -3 hours post -infusion . 
16 Any subject with unresolved moderate or severe intensity influenza symptoms or an unresolved AE and/or treatment -emergent laboratory finding that requires further medical management may be 
evaluated in further follow -up visits, at the Investigator’s d iscretion.  
17   If previous lab results are abnormal and considered clinically significant by the Investigator or significantly changed from baseline, blood specimen collection for clinical chemistry or clinical 
hematology tests as specified in Sections 11.2.1  and 11.2.2  may be drawn. If previous urinalysis lab results are abnormal and considered clinically significant by the Investigator or significantly 
changed from baseline, a uri ne collection for urinalysis may be completed .

c. Proven or suspected concomitant bacterial infection 
d. Other  known concomitant viral infection that is likely to complicate medical course 
such as RSV, parainfluenza virus and adenovirus. Co-infection with rhinovirus and enterovirus is allowed.  
As a note, hospitalization is not an exclusion criterion  when it is the usual practice of the 
treating institution to hospitalize children with influenza. However, the subject must have acute uncomplicated influenza.  
11. Previous participatio n in Study BCX1812-305 or participation in a study of any 
investigational drug or device within the last 30  days . 
12. Subjects who cannot comply with all aspects of the study protocol.  
8.3. Withdrawal Criteria 
Participation in the study is strictly voluntary.  Parents/guardians have the right to withdraw their 
children  from the study at any time and for any reason. A subject’s participation will be 
terminated: 
• At their parent’s/guardian’s request ; 
• At the subject’s request if ≥ 7 years old and able to give assent; in cases where a 
subject is < 7 years of age and expresses a wish to stop the study, the parent/caregiver and the Investigator will use their best judgments to determine what is  in the best interest for 
the child in question; 
• If, in the Investigator’s or Sponsor’s opinion, continuation in the study would be detrimental to the subject’s well- being ; 
• If the subject is not able to comply with the study requirements; 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 
38 • If the Sponsor terminates the study; 
• If a regulatory authority requires that all study activities be halted . 
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the subject’s medical records (source 
documents). If the reason for subject withdrawal is not known, the subject must be followed to 
establish whether the reason was an AE, and if so, this must be reported in accordance with the 
procedures outlined in Section  11.1.2. Vigorous attempts should be made for follow-up of all 
subjects who miss a study visit.  In general, although study drug may be stopped, subjects will be 
encouraged to complete the scheduled procedures. The subject will require a n Early Withdrawal 
Visit if withdrawn from the study prior to scheduled study completion. If a subject’s 
participation in this study is terminated, the responsible Investigator at the site will complete a termination form.  
To the extent possible, all scheduled end- of-study assessments (including the Early Withdrawal 
Visit) should be performed on all participating subjects who withdraw from the study before the 
Day 7 Visit. For subjects who withdraw between Day 7 and Day 14, a telephone assessment 
should be conducted, where possible. 
Subjects withdrawn from the study at any time other than during the screening period will not be 
replaced.

39 9. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
9.1. Study Drug Dose Rationale  
In Study 0816T0633 conducted by Shionogi & Co. Ltd in Japan, 117 pediatric and adolescent  
patients with type A or type B influenza infection who were ≥ 28 days but < 16 years of age , 
were treated with 1 to 5 daily doses of IV peramivir in the outpatient setting.  The dose of 
peramivir used in that study (10 mg/kg of body weight to a maximum of 600 mg) was based on 
pharmacokinetic modeling and target area under the plasma concentration- time curve (AUC). 
Peramivir, administered IV, was generally safe and well tolerated in this population. Plasma 
concentration s from the pediatric patients in this study were found to be within the range of 
plasma concentrations following administration of peramivir  at 300 mg or 600 mg in adult 
patients with influenza, and did not exceed mean plasma concentrations following  administration 
at 800 mg in healthy adults . 
The approved dose of peramivir in adults is a single dose of 600 mg. Population pharmacokinetic 
modeling performed  by the FDA (July  2010) based on the Shionogi Studies 0816T0633 
(children and adolescents) and 0722T0621 (adults) supports a target dose of 12 mg/kg in children (≤ 12 years) to attain exposures similar to  that in adults who receive a 600 mg IV dose. Children 
13 and over can be treated with  600 mg/day, the adult dose. Per CDC, the average weight of a 
13-year-old boy and girl are 45 kg (99 lbs) and 46 kg (101 lbs) respectively. In adult trials of 
peramivir in acute uncomplicated influenza, at least 30 subjects with weights between 40 kg 
(88 lbs) and 50 kg (110 lbs) were treated without additional risk or complication. In addition, 
peramivir elimination is almost exclusively renal. Renal size reaches adult at age 12 and function 
(i.e., glomerular filtration rate) reaches that of an adult by age 2. The population PK model built using interim PK data from BCX1812-305 included a renal maturation factor to account for the development of renal function prior to age 2.  Simulations support a dose of 8 mg/kg from birth 
to less than 6 months of age , and 12 mg/kg in subjects 6 months of age and older.  Subjects < 6 
months of age are not predicted to have higher exposure of peramivir than that of adults.   
9.2. Treatments Admi nistered  
9.2.1. Peramivir  
Peramivir solution for infusion is a clear, iso -osmotic, sterile, nonpyrogenic solution in 200 mg 
per 20 mL (10  mg/mL) single -use glass vials fitted with rubber stoppers and aluminum flip -off 
seals.  The drug product should be stored at  room temperatures up to 30°C. 
Subjects < 6 months of age at time of consent will receive a single dose of IV peramivir at a dose 
of 8 mg/kg . Subjects ≥ 6 months - ≤ 12 years of age at time of consent will receive a single dose 
of IV peramivir at a dose of 12 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 600 mg). S ubjects ≥ 13 years of 
age will receive a single dose of 600 mg IV peramivir  administered as a short IV infusion over a 
minimum of 15 minutes.  Peramivir must be diluted in normal saline  normal saline United States  
Pharmacopeia ( SUP).: 
Because of the risk of vasovagal reactions, particularly in children with needle phobia, it is 
recommended that subjects be in a supine position during peramivir administration. Appropriate post infusion observation should be performed.

Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 
40 9.2.2. Oseltamivir  
Oseltamivir will be provided by the site’s pharmacy as capsules or powder for oral suspension 
and prepared and used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Subjects will be dosed 
according to Table 2 below:  
Table 2: Oseltamivir dose regimen by age

        > 40 kg 75 mg BID for 5 days  Dose may be given as capsules  or an oral suspension may be used by 
subjects who cannot swallow a capsule. 
 
9.3. Randomization and Blinding/ Masking  
Subjects ≥ 7 to 17 years of age will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms, at a ratio of 4:1: 
Treatment Group 1: A single dose of IV peramivir  
Treatment Group 2: Oral oseltamivir given BID for 5 days 
Following approval of amendment 3, all s ubjects < 7 years old will receive a single dose of 
intravenous peramivir.  
As this is an open label study, blinding is not applicable. 
9.4. Study Medication Preparation and Administration  
9.4.1. Peramivir  
The Principal Investigator at each study center will designate a pharmacist (or other qualified 
study staff member) to prepare IV  peramivir as described in a separate study Pharmacy Manual . 
Prior to infusion, an appropriate amount of the peramivir 10 mg/mL stock solution will be diluted in s aline using aseptic techniques with a maximum volume of 100 mL.  Once prepared, 
solutions of peramivir in saline should be refrigerated and infused within 24 hours of preparation.  
In children ≥ 12 months, the total peramivir dose should be diluted to a total volume of 100 mL. For children < 12 months, the following dilution should be followed:

The study drug should be given as soon as possible after enrollment and randomization on 
Day 1. The calendar date and 24-hour clock time (start and end of the IV infusion) will be 
recorded. If the intravenous line used to administer peramivir is also to be used to administer any 
other medications, it should be flushed with at least 5 mL of saline before and after peramivir administration. Peramivir should not be piggy-backed to any other medication being 
administered.  
9.4.2. Oseltamivir  
Oseltamivir will be prepared and administered in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. 
9.5. Treatment Compliance  
Intravenous peramivir will be administered by study staff  or other qualified personnel . Details of 
the infusion (to include date of dose, start time, and stop time) will be recorded by a member of the study staff.  
The first dose of oral oseltamivir will be administered in capsule or oral solution form at the site by study staff or other qualified personnel. Details of the first and all subsequent doses (administered at home by the subject/parent/guardian) will be recorded in the Subject Diary.  Details will include the date and time of drug administration.  
9.6. Overd ose and Toxicity Management  
To date there is no experience with overdose of IV peramivir.  If overdose occurs, subjects should 
receive indicated supportive therapy and evaluation of hematologic and clinical chemistry 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 
42 laboratory tests should be conducted. Pe ramivir is cleared by hemodialysis; the decision to use 
hemodialysis should be addressed on a case- by-case basis  with the Sponsor. 
9.7. Study medication accountability  
The Investigator/pharmacist must maintain accurate records of the disposition of all study dr ug 
received from the Sponsor and administered to the subject (including date and time), and any 
drug accidentally destroyed.  The Sponsor will supply a specific D rug Accountability Form. At 
the end of the study, information describing study drug supplies (e .g., lot numbers) and 
disposition of supplies for each subject must be provided, signed by the Investigator or designee, and collected by the Study Monitor. If any errors or irregularities in any shipment of study 
medication to the site are discovered at any time, the Sponsor Project Manager must be contacted 
immediately.  
At the end of the study, all medication  that was neither dispensed or administered, as we ll as 
packaging materials will be collected with supervision of the monitor and returned to the 
Sponsor or destroyed on site as dictated by the appropriate Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) at the participating site  
9.8. Concomitant Medications  
Administration of a concomitant medication during the study period must be recorded within the 
subject’s medical records.  This includes prescription medications as well as over-the-counter 
medications.  
Medications used for the symptomatic treatment of influenza -related s ymptoms will be 
discouraged for children 2- 5 years of age as per American Academy of Pediatrics guidance and 
the January 2008 FDA public health advisory. Parents/caregivers will be requested to follow package labeling for over -the-counter cold and influenz a symptom relief medications for 
children 2-5. The use of symptomatic medication will be prohibited in children < 2 years of age. 
Antipyretics will be permitted in all age groups.  Parents/caregivers will record the date, time, 
and dose of symptomatic medi cations  and antipyretics  in the Subject Diary . All other 
concomitant medications will be transcribed from the source onto the Case Report Form (CRF) by study staff.  
Use of concomitant medications will be assessed and recorded at Screening/ Baseline, and daily throughout the duration of the study through the study follow-up visit.  
9.8.1. Medications for Chronic Diseases/Conditions  
Subjects with chronic medical conditions may continue to receive prescribed treatments during participation in this protocol. The except ion is high dose steroids > 10 mg/day (see exclusion 
criteria, Section 8.2). 
9.8.2. Antivirals  
There are no known adverse interactions of peramivir with other influenza antivirals (such as oseltamivir, zanamivir, amantadine, and rimantadine); however, their concomitant use  is not 
permitted  during administration of study drug and in the post- treatment follow -up period.  
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 
43 9.8.3. Corticosteroids  
Corticosteroids at dose < 10 mg a day are allowed  during administration of the study drug and 
throughout study participation. 
9.8.4. Antipyretics and Analgesics  
Resolution of fever is a major component of some of the clinical effectiveness endpoints for this 
study.  Accordingly, use of any antipyretics or analgesics with antipyretic properties must be 
carefully controlled and documented. Antipyretics and analgesics may be administered while the 
subject is enrolled in this study. The names and dosages of these medicati ons will be recorded in 
the Subject Diary. To avoid the confounding effects of antipyretic  medications, temperature 
measurements, including those recorded by study staff while in the emergency department or clinic  and those recorded by the subjects during the follow -up period, will be taken, whenever 
possible, at least 4 hours after administration of the antipyretic  medication  or immediately prior 
to administration . Following discharge from the hospital, t he names and dosages of all other 
medications will b e recorded  in the Subject Diary by the parent/ care -giver.  
Temperature measurements that are recorded for the purpose of analyzing effectiveness  in this 
study <  4 hours after administration of the antipyretic  medication, regardless of the dose, will not 
be counted in the eff ectiveness  analyses.  
9.8.5. Antibiotics  
Oral or parenteral antibiotics may be administered , if medically indicated. If such use is a result 
of proven or suspected influenza-related complication, appropriate assessments should be carried out (se e Section  11.4).

44 10. STUDY CONDUCT  
10.1. Overview  
Up to  140 subjects will be enrolled in this study according to the following age groups: 
• Birth to <  28 days: up to 10 subjects, given IV peramivir 
• 28 days to < 2 years:  up to 20 subjects : subjects enrolled after the approval  of amendment 
3 will receive  IV peramivir  
• 2 - < 4 years: up to 10 subjects : subjects enrolled after the approval of amendment 3 will 
receive IV peramivir  
• 4 - < 7 years: up to 30 subjects : subjects enrolled after the approval  of amendment 3 will 
receive IV peramivir  
• 7 - < 1 3 years: up to 40 subjects, randomized 4:1 to IV peramivir or oral oseltamivir  
• 13 - < 18 years: up to 30  subjects , randomized 4:1 to IV peramivir or oral oseltamivir 
 
Once an age cohort is filled, enrollment in that cohort will be closed and communicated with all 
investigators.  
A subject’s duration of participation in this study is expected to be 14 days.   
Subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria may be enrolled into the study. It is expected 
that most subjects will have the Screening/ Baseline Visit and the Day 1 Treatment Visit on the 
same day.  
All s ubjects will receive either a single dose of IV peramivir (600 mg, or12 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg or  
depending on age) or oral oseltamivir, dosed BID for 5 days. Note, as of the approval of 
amendment 3, no additional subjects will be randomized to receive oseltamivir. 
Subjects will undergo follow-up assessments on Days 3, 7, and 14. The Day 3 visit may be a 
home visit (performed by a qualified study nurse). Day 7 is required to take place in the clinic, 
and Day 14 may either be a clinic visit, home visit, or follow-up phone call to the 
subject/parent/guardian.   
All parents/caregiver s will record the following information in the Subject Diary.  
• Temperature measurements (oral or axillary) will be taken with an electronic 
thermometer provided by BioCryst, approximately every 12 hours until temperature 
normalizes for 48 hours (i.e., temperature without antipyretic is <  99.4 orally in 
children ≥ 6 and < 98.4 axillary in children < 6 years old for 4 measurements). With 
the exception of the baseline measurement, all temperature measurements will be 
obtained at least 4  hours after, or immediately before, administration of oral 
acetaminophen or other antipy retic medication s, if taken. 
• Date and time of oral oseltamivir dose administration, if applicable.  This should be 
recorded in the Subject Diary twice a day for 5 days.  
• Doses of antipyretic  medication and any medications taken for symptomatic relief , 
each day through the last follow- up assessment . 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 
45 • The ability of the child  or adolescent to return to day care/school and/or resume their 
normal “pre- illness” daily activity  will be assessed once daily  until the child  or 
adolescent  return s to day care/school and/or resume normal “pre- illness” daily 
activity . 
• The child or adolescent’s appetite and eating patterns assessed as normal or 
reduced/abnormal will be assessed once daily until they return to normal “pre- illness” 
level.  
All parents/caregiver s of subjects 7 years of age and older will record the following additional 
information in the Subject Diary: 
• Assessment of 7 influenza symptoms (cough, sore throat, nasal obstruction, myalgia 
[muscle aches ), headache, feverishness, and fatigue) on a 4- point severity scale 
(0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe) twice daily, beginning pre-dose on Day 1 
until symptom resolution or through the last follow -up visit, (whichever comes first). 
All parents/caregiver s of subjects ≥ 4 years  of age to ≤ 6 years of age will recor d the following 
additional information in the Subject Diary: 
• Assessment of 7 influenza symptoms [cough, sore throat, nasal obstruction, myalgia 
(muscle aches ), headache, feverishness, fatigue/malaise, and gastrointestinal 
symptoms (nausea, vomiting or diar rhea) ] on a 4-point severity scale (0, absent; 
1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe) twice daily, beginning pre-dose on Day 1 until symptom resolution or through the last follow -up visit, whichever comes first. 
All parents/caregiver s of subjects≤ 3 years of age will record the following additional 
information in the Subject Diary: 
• Assessment of 5 influenza symptoms [cough, rhinitis, feverishness, 
malaise/irritability and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting or diarrhea) ] on a 
4-point severity scale (0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe) twice daily, beginning pre-dose on Day 1 until symptom resolution or through the last follow -up 
visit, (whichever comes first). 
An adequate nasal swab specimen  will be collected from all enrolled subjects at Baseline 
(pre-dose) for virus sub- type identification and quantitative vir ologic assessments and at the 
follow-up assessments on study Days 3, 7, and where possible Day 14. 
Specimens from all subjects yielding influenza virus will also be assessed for susceptibility to 
neuraminidase inhibitors (Day 1 and last specimen yielding influenza virus on culture). A central laboratory will perform all virologic assessments.  
Plasma samples for determination of drug concentration on subjects randomized to peramivir will be drawn as follows: 
Up to 4 blood samples will be drawn, where possible, during the following time periods, beginning from the end of dosing until release from the site 
• One time point immediately follow ing completion of the infusion 
• One time point from 30 minutes to 1 hour post-infusion 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 
46 • One time point from 1 hour to 3 hours post-infusion  
• One time point from 3 hours to 6 hours post-infusion 
Note: Subjects ≥ 5 kg will have four 1.0 mL PK blood draws at the above stated sampling 
times. Subjects < 5 kg will have two 1.0 mL  blood samples; one ti me immediately 
following completion of the infusion and one time between 1 -3 hours post-infusion. 
Adverse events and concomitant medications will be monitored at each scheduled visit from the screening/baseline assessment to final study visit. Clinical laboratory investigations (chemistries, 
hematology, and urinalysis) will be collected at baseline and at the final study visit. Safety and 
tolerability will be evaluated through assessments of adverse events, laboratory analyses (clinical 
chemistry, hematology, an d urinalysis), vital signs and physical examinations at the time points 
indicated in the schedule of assessments.  
10.2. Schedule of Assessments  
10.2.1. Screening Period  
The Screening Period begins at the time of consent/assent of the study subject. Subjects whose parents/guardians have provided written informed consent (and assent for subjects ≥ 7 years of 
age or as permitted by local IRB and state requirements) will be assigned a unique study subject 
number and the following screening procedures will be conducted: 
• Evaluation of study eligibility requirements.  
• Urine pregnancy test (females of childbearing potential only).  
• Review of medical history  and concomitant medications. 
• Body temperature (obtained in the site’s usual fashion). 
Eligible subjects will be enrolled . The study pharmacist will prepare an order for study drug as 
defined in Section  11.4, which includes the subject’s study number. 
10.2.2. Treatment Period  
Randomization (prior to the approval of amendment 3) and study drug administration should begin as soon as possible following determination that the subject is eligible for enrollment at 
Screening.  Therefore, it is anticipated that the date of Screening/Baseline and Day 1 (date of 
administration of the first dose of study medication) will be the same day. Day 1 represents the 
first day of dosing. Subjects will receive IV peramivir  in a single dose or oral oseltamivir BID 
for five da ys.  Note, following  the approval of amendment 3, no additional subjects will be 
randomized to receive oseltamivir. 
10.2.2.1. Day 1/Baseline/Pre- Dose  
The following procedures/evaluations will be performed pre -dose at  Baseline on  Day 1 :

Effectiveness  will be evaluated through assessments of body temperature, clinical symptoms of 
influenza, usual daily activities, appetite/eating patterns, incidence of influenza- related 
complications (s ee Section  11.4 for details), influenza virus titers, and changes in viral sensitivity 
to other antiviral drugs. 
10.3.1. Body Temperature  
Body temperature measurements will be recorded once at Screening/Baseline by the site’s 
normal method, and then via an electronic thermometer provided by the Sponsor twice per day 
until temperature normalizes for 48 hours without the use of anti- pyretic medication. Acceptable 
means by which to record body temperature will be oral or ax illary measurements.  Study staff 
will record temperature measurements while the subject is on -site. Parents/care givers  will be 
instructed to measure and record the subject’s body temperature in the Subject Diary , using the 
electronic thermometer provided by the Sponsor. To avoid the confounding effects of antipyretic  
medications, temperature measurements will be taken, whenever possible, at least 4 hours after 
administration of any antipyretic  medication  or immediately prior to dosing. Temperature 
measurem ents that are recorded for the purpose of analyzing eff ectiveness  in this study < 4 hours 
after administration of the antipyretic  medication, regardless of the dose, will not be counted in 
the eff ectiveness analyses.  The method of temperature measurement must be recorded.

Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 
52 10.3.2. Influenza Signs and Symptoms  
Subjects (or parent/guardian) will be asked to provide an assessment of influenza symptom s on a 
4-point severity scale (0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe) beginning pre -dose on Day 1 
until symptom resolution and through the last follow -up visit, (whichever comes first). These 
assessments will be recorded on each day that the medical condition allows. Study staff will 
obtain this assessment pre-dose and post-dose on Day 1, and the subject’s trained parent-
guardian will then obtain it until returning to the site for the final visit. Influenza signs and symptoms vary by age. In addition, younger children may not be able to verbalize specific 
symptoms. Therefore, the assessment of influenza symptoms will be based on the subject’s age, 
as follows: 
• Parent/guardian of subjects birth to ≤ 3 years of age will provide/record an 
assessment of 5 influenza symptoms [cough, rhinitis, feverishness, malaise/irritability 
and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting or diarrhea) ]  
• Subjects ≥ 4 years  of age to ≤ 6 years of age will be asked to provide an assessment 
of 7 influenza symptoms [cough, sore throat, nasal obstruction, myalgia (muscle 
aches), headache, feverishness, and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting or diarrhea) ].  
• Subjects 7 years of age and older will be asked to provide an assessment of 
7 influenza symptoms (cough, sore throat, nasal obstruction, myalgia (muscle aches), 
headache, feverishness, and fatigue).  
During the first visit, the  study s taff will instruct the parent/care giver  on completing these 
assessments and recording responses directly into the Subject Diary. Although the parent/care giver will be recording the responses, the subject should be involved in the assessment of the symptoms.  
10.3.3. Assessment of ability to perform usual daily activities 
If possible, subjects or parents/care givers will be asked to provide a daily assessment of the subject’s  ability to perform usual daily activities using a 0-10 visual analogue scale, where 
0 = Unable to perform usual activities at all, and 10  = Able to perform usual activities fully. The 
parent/care giver  will be asked to record these assessments in the Subject Diary, with appropriate 
input from the subjects, once daily from Day 2 until resolution or the final follow -up assessment, 
whichever comes first.  
10.3.4. Assessment of appetite and eating patterns  
Subjects or parents/caregivers will be asked to provide a daily assessment of the subject’s appetite and eating pattern as either normal or abnormal/reduced.  The parent/ caregiver will be 
asked to record this assessment in the Subject Diary, with appropriate input from subjects, once daily from Day 2  until resolution or the final follow- up assessment, whichever comes first.

Bilateral mid -nasal  swab specimens will be collected for virologic analysis. Samples  will be 
collected at Baseline, Day 3, Day 7, and, where possible, Day 14. 
Virology laboratory tests will include viral sub type characterization from the baseline sample, 
laboratory culture and analysis by log 10 TCID 50, RT-PCR assay,  viral susceptibility to peramivir , 
oseltamivir , and zanamivir, and genotypic ana lysis of primary virus isolates .

54 11. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
Safety will be evaluated through assessments of AEs, laboratory analyses (clinical chemistry, 
hematology, and urinalysis), vital signs, and physical examinations . 
11.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be assessed and recorded at the indicated time points (see  schedule of 
assessments,  Table 1). AEs will be recorded on Day 1, Day 3, Day 7 and Day 14/Early Withdraw 
visits. Adverse events will be graded through use of the Division of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (DAIDS) Tables for Grading Adult and Pediatric Adverse Experiences (see Appendix 1).  Any G rade 3 and Grade 4 clinical AEs or laboratory abnormalities  that are 
judged to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment will be promptly (within 72 hours) reported to the study medical monitor unless the event meets criteria for an S AE, in 
which case they must be reported within 24 hours . Influenza -related complications are not 
considered AEs unless they meet the criteria for SAEs. Full details on recording and reporting AEs are provided in Section  11.1.2. 
11.1.1. Definitions  
11.1.1.1. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject. No causal relationship 
with the study drug or with the clinical study itself is implied. An AE  may be an unfavorable and 
unintended sign, symptom, syndrome, or illness that develops or worsens during the clinical 
study. Clinically relevant abnormal results of diagnostic procedures including abnormal 
laboratory findings (e.g., requiring unscheduled diagnostic procedures or treatment measures, or 
resulting in withdrawal from the study) are considered to be AEs. 
Surgical procedures are not AEs but may constitute therapeutic measures for conditions that 
require surgery. The condition for which the surgery is required is an AE, if it occurs or is 
detected during the study period. Planned surgical measures permitted by the clinical study protocol and the conditions(s) leading to these measures are not AEs, if the condition(s) was 
(were) known before the start of study treatment. In the latter case the condition should be 
reported as medical history.  
Assessment of the age appropriate symptoms of influenza symptoms will be documented and 
analyzed as a measure of effectiveness  of the study treatment. These symptoms will not be 
reported as AEs unless the symptom(s) worsen to the extent that the outcome fulfills the definition of an SAE, which then must be recorded as such. Likewise, a RAT for influenza is 
required at screening in order to determine eligibility f or the study, and therefore a positive RAT 
is not considered an AE. 
AEs are designated as “nonserious” or “serious.”  
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 
55 11.1.1.2. Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is an adverse event that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Is life -threatening (subject is at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe)  
• Requires in -subject hospitalization (formal admission to a hospital for medical 
reasons) or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., there is a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in subject hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Hospitalization , as per the institution’s standard of care (SOC) to treat pediatric influenza is not 
considered an SAE and should not be reported as such. Any adverse event the causes a 
prolongation of an existing hospitalization must be reported as per Section 11.1.5. 
11.1.2. Method, Frequency, and Time Period for Detecting Adverse Events and 
Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Reports of AEs are to be collected from the time the subject consents to participate through the 
follow-up period ending on Day 14. The Investigator or designee must completely and promptly 
record each AE.  The Investigator should attempt, if possible, to establish a diagnosis based on 
the presenting signs and symptoms. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE 
and not the individual sign/symptom. If a clear diagnosis cannot be established, each sign and symptom must be recorded individually. If a final diagnosis is established during evaluation or treatment, the source documents will be updated according ly. 
The Investigator should attempt to follow all unresolved AEs and/or SAEs observed during the study until they are resolved, or are judged medically stable, or are otherwise medically explained.  
11.1.3. Definition of Severity  
All AEs will be assessed (graded) for severity and classified using the DAIDS criteria for grading AEs (see  Appendix 1).  Any  adverse events not covered by the DAIDS criteria will be 
assessed and classified into one of three clearly defined categories as follows:   
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 
56 Mild:  (Grade 1): Transient or mild symptoms; no limitation in activity; no 
intervention required. The AE does not interfere with the participant’s normal functioning level. It may be an annoyance.  
Moderate:  (Grade 2): Symptom results in mild to moderate limitation in activity; no or minimal intervention required. The AE produces some impairment of functioning, but it is not hazardous to health. It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  
Severe:  (Grade 3): Symptom results in significant limitation in activity; medical intervention may be required. The AE produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. 
Life threatening  (Grade 4): Symptoms causing inability to per form basic self -care 
functions OR Medical or operative intervention indicated to prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability, or death  
11.1.4. Definition of Relationship to Study Drug  
The Principal Investigator or medically qualified designee must review each AE and make the 
determination of relationship to study drug using the following guidelines: 
Not Related:  The event can be readily explained by other factors such as the subject’s underlying medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident, and no temporal relationship exists between the study drug and the event. 
Unlikely:  The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration and is readily explained by the subject’s clinical state or by other modes of therapy administered to the subject.  
Possibly Related: There is some temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the study drug and the event is unlikely to be explained by the subject’s medical condition, other therapies, or accident. 
Prob ably 
Related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, and cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state.  
Definitely Related:  The even t follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the medication, follows a known or suspected response pattern to the medication, is confirmed by improvement upon stopping the medication (dechallenge), and reappears upon repeated exposure (r echallenge, if 
rechallenge is medically appropriate).  
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 
57 11.1.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAE must be reported by phone or email to the Sponsor medical monitor and in writing via 
email or fax using the SAE report form within 24 hours  of the Investigator’ s awareness of the SAE. 
In addition, all SAEs must be recorded on the AE CRF in real time. 
All additional follow -up evaluations of the SAE must be reported to BioCryst or its designee as soon 
as they are available.  
The SAE report forms should be sent to the following  email addresses or fax numbers: 
Email: mm@biocryst.com and clinicalsafety@propharmagroup.com  
OR 
Fax: +1 919 226-5888 and +1 866-681-1063 
Immediate reporting should allow BioCryst to take the appropriate measures to address potential new 
risks in a clinical trial. Therefore, the initial report should be submitted by the Investigator within a 
very short period of time and under no circumstances should this period exceed 24 hours following awareness of the SAE.  
The follow-up report should allow BioCryst to determine whether the serious adverse event requires a reassessment of the benefit -risk profile of the study drug in clinical trial, if the  relevant information 
was not already available and provided in the initial report.
 
Any SAEs considered possibly, probably or definitely related to treatment and not in accordance 
with information in the Investigator’s Brochure will be reported to the FDA and other Regulatory Competent Authorities as applicable via the MedWatch / CIOMS reporting system in accordance with FDA and other applicable regulations. 
The Principal Investigator or designee at each site is responsible for submitting the IND safety 
report (initial and follow -up) or other safety information (e.g., revised Investigator’s Brochure) 
to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and for retaining a copy in their files.  
11.1.6. Pregnancy  
Pregnancy is not considered an AE but any pregnancy discovered in a subject during the course 
of the trial must be reported to BioCryst or designee on a pregnancy report form (supplied by 
BioCryst) in the same manner as SAEs (see Section 11.1.5). All pregnancies will be followed to 
an outcome (i.e. miscarriage, elective termination, stillbirth, live birth). Pregnancy outcomes of 
miscarriage, elective termination, stillbirth or birth defect will be considered SAEs and sh ould be 
reported as per 11.1.5. 
11.1.7. Reporting DAIDS Grade 3 or 4 events  
Any DAIDS Grade 3 and Grade 4 clinical AE or laboratory abnormality that is judged to be 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment but does not meet seriousness criteria 
will be promptly (within 72 hours) reported to the study medical monitor via telephone or email .

58 11.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
For any subject that is hospitalized, clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis samples will 
be analyzed by the local labo ratory.  Duplicate samples will not be drawn for analysis by the 
central laboratory.  
11.2.1. Clinical Chemistry Profiles  
Clinical chemistry profiles will include a Chemistry 20 panel (includes sodium, potassium, 
chloride, total CO 2 [bicarbonate], creatinine, gluco se, urea nitrogen, albumin, total calcium, total 
magnesium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein, total creatine ki nase, and uric acid).  
Blood samples for clinical chemistry profiles will be collecte d at Baseline and at the Day  7 
follow-up assessment. Clinically significant results should be reported as AEs. 
11.2.2. Hematology Profiles  
Hematology profiles will include complete  blood count (CBC) with differential. 
Blood samples for hematology profiles will be collected at Baseline, and at the Day  7 follow-up 
assessment. Clinically significant results should be reported as AEs.  11.2.3. Urinalysis  
Routine urinalysis evaluations will include dipstick evaluations for protein, glucose, ketones, 
hemoglobin, and specific gravity. If indicated by dipstick results, the urine should be sent for microscopy.  
Urinalysis will be conducted on urine samples obtained at Baseline, and at the Day  7 follow-up 
assessment. Clinically significant results should be reported as AEs.  
11.2.4. Pregnancy Test (Urine or Serum)  
Females of childbearing potential will be evaluated for pregnancy at Screening/ Baseline and at 
the Day 7 follow-up assessment using a urine pregnanc y test performed local ly.  
11.3. Vital Signs 
Vital sign measurements (blood pressure  (in children < 2 only if clinically indicated), heart rate, 
respiration rate, temperature) will be recorded once at Baseline and once at each follow -up visit. 
11.4. Physical Examination and Influenza -Related Complications 
Assessment  
The Investigator will perform a full physical examination at Baseline, including the subject’s 
height or length  and weight. At each follow-up visit, study personnel will evaluate the subject for 
the presence of clinical signs and/or symptoms of the following influenza- related complications: 
sinusitis, otitis  media , bronchitis and pneumonia. 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 
59 If the Investigator determines that the subject has (or is presumed to have) one of the 
influenza- related comp lications noted above, he/she will note that in the subject’s source 
documents and on the influenza- related complications CRF page. A ny medication used to treat 
the condition must also  be recorded (on the concomitant medication page) . The Investigator will  
promptly provide appropriate treatment for any suspected or proven influenza- related 
complication(s).  Signs and symptoms associated with  influenza- related complications will not be 
reported  on the adverse event  CRF page  unless they meet criteria for an SA E. 
11.5. Safety Oversight  
Since the study is open label, a sponsor- led Data Safety Management Committee (DSMC) will 
oversee safety. A full review and summary of safety utilizing all collected safety assessments 
will occur after each influenza season. This will be described in the separate DSMC charter.

years - < 18 years.  All data collected during the study will be included in data listings.  Unless 
otherwise noted, the data will be sorted first by treatment group, age group, subject number, and 
then by date within each subject number.   
The statistical analyses will be conducted with the SAS
® software package version 9. 2 or higher. 
All analyses will be subject to formal verification procedures.  Specifically, results will be 
verified utilizing independent programming prior to issuance of the draft statistical report.  All 
documents will be verified by the lead statistician to ensure accuracy and consistency of analyses . 
13.1. Data Collection Methods 
The data will be transcribed from the subjects’ s ource documents into  the CRF approved by 
BioCryst. The data collection methods may be either a paper CRF or an electronic CRF, at BioCryst’s discretion. All documentation supporting the CRF data, such as laboratory or hospital records must be readily avail able to verify entries in the CRF.  
To ensure subject confidentiality, any documents (including laboratory reports, hospital records subsequent to SAEs, etc.) transmitted to BioCryst should not carry the subject’s name. 
13.2. Statistical Analysis Plans  
A SAP will  be created and approved prior to the review of any data.  This document will provide 
a more technical and detailed description of the proposed data analysis methods and procedures. 
13.3. Study Hypothesis  
There are no hypotheses to be formally tested in this stud y. 
13.4. Sample Size Estimates  
The study is designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and effectiveness of IV 
administration of peramivir compared to oral oseltamivir in pediatric subjects with acute uncomplicated influenza. The sample size is not based on statistical considerations, rather a sample size of up to 140 subjects (approximately 117 randomized to peramivir) is considered 
adequate to evaluate the stated objectives.

62 13.5. Analysis Populations  
The populations defined for analysis will include the intent- to-treat (ITT)  popula tion, 
intent- to-treat infected (ITTI)  population, safety population, and an exposure-response 
population. Additional analysis populations may be defined to evaluate study results. Any 
additional analysis populations will be defined in the SAP. 
• Intent -To-Treat Population:  The ITT population will include all subjects who are 
randomized. The ITT population will be used for analyses of accountability and demographics.  
• Intent -To-Treat Infected Population:  The ITTI population will include all subjects 
who are enr olled, treated, and have influenza confirmed by RT-PCR. The ITTI 
population will be used for analyses of eff ectiveness . 
• Safety Population: The safety population will include all subjects who received at 
least one dose of study drug. This population will be used for all safety analyses.  
• Exposure- Response Population:  The exposure-response population will include all 
subjects in the ITTI population who have a quantifiable plasma concentration of peramivir  and at least one post -baseline effectiveness assessment . This population 
will be used for all exposure- response analyses.  
13.6. End of Study Analysi s 
A final analysis is planned to occur after the last subject completes or discontinues the study, and the resulting clinical database has been cleaned, quality checked, and locked. 
13.7. General Issues for Statistical Analysis  
13.7.1. Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity  
No adjustments are currently planned.  
13.7.2. Covariates 
Not applicable.  
13.7.3. Planned Subgroups  
Analyses will be displayed by age group and viral subtype at Screening. 
13.7.4. Missing Data 
Every effort will be made to obtain required data at each scheduled visit from all subjects who 
have been randomized. In situations where it is not possible to obtain all data, it may be 
necessary to impute missing data. In assessing the time to event endpoints, subjects who 
withdraw or never achieve resolution/alleviation, mis sing data will be censored using the date of 
subject’s last non- missing assessment.  Additional details on the handling of missing data will be 
presented in the SAP.

63 13.8. Effectiveness  
13.8.1. Effectiveness Endpoints  
All effectiveness endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group, 
age group, and study day/time, if appropriate.  
13.8.2. Effectiveness Analyses  
Time to resolution of fever, defined as a temperature < 99.4 oral or < 98.4 axillary with no 
antipyretic medications taken for at least 12 hours, will be estimated for each age group and 
overall by treatment group using the method of Kaplan-Meier. Subjects who do not achieve 
resolution of fever will be censored at the time of their last assessment.  
Time to resolution of influenza symptoms, define d as the time from initiation of study drug until 
the start of the 21.5-hour period (24 hours- 10%) where all symptoms of influenza are recorded 
as none or mild, will be estimated for each age group and treatment group  using the method of 
Kaplan -Meier. Sub jects who do not experience alleviation of symptoms will be censored at the 
time of the last non -missing symptom assessment. As the number and type of symptoms varies 
by age, the analysis of time to resolution of symptoms will not be presented as an overal l 
assessment.  
Reduction in viral shedding will be assessed as the change from baseline in log 10 TCID 50/mL and 
RT-PCR, and will be summarized for each age  group, treatment group and study visit.  
Changes in virus susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors be tween virus cultured at Baseline 
and the last post-treatment sample from which virus can be cultured will be assessed using virology laboratory tests. Virology laboratory tests will include phenotypic characterizations of influenza virus recovered ( hemagglutinin  and neuraminidase) and viral susceptibility to 
peramivir , and genotypic analysis of primary virus isolates. These analyses will be presented 
separately by age group and viral subtype. 
13.9. Safety Analyses  
Adverse Events  will be mapped to a Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA )-
preferred term and system organ classification.  The occurrence of treatment- emergent AEs 
(TEAEs) will be summarized by age group and treatment group using MedDRA -preferred terms, 
system organ classifications, a nd severity. All AEs will be listed for individual subjects showing 
both verbatim and preferred terms. Separate summaries of treatment -emergent SAEs and AEs 
related to study drug will be generated.  
Descriptive summaries of vital signs and clinical laboratory results will be presented by age 
group, treatment group and study visit.  Laboratory abnormalities will be graded according to the 
DAIDS Table for Grading Adverse Events for Adults and Pediatrics (Publish Date: December 2004 Clarification, 2009, see Appendix 1).  The number and percentage of subjects experiencing 
treatment -emergent graded toxicities will be summarized by age group and treatment group . 
Laboratory toxicity shifts from baseline to post- baseline assessments will be summarized by age 
group and treatment group. 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

64 Previous and concomitant medications will be mapped to a WHO preferred term and drug 
classification.  The number and percent of subjec ts taking concomitant medications will be 
summarized using preferred terms and drug classifications.  
The number and percent of subjects experiencing influenza related complications will be 
summarized by age group and treatment group. 
Subject disposition wi ll be presented for all subjects.  The number of subjects who completed the 
study and discontinued from the study will be provided. The reasons for early discontinuation 
also will be presented.  
13.10.  Exposure Response Analyses  
The data from the PK samples will be  used together with data from prior trials to complete a 
separate exposure-response analysis. The methods for the exposure- response analysis will be 
presented in a separate SAP.

65 14. STUDY ADMINISTRATION 
14.1. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
14.1.1. Regulatory Authority Approvals 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol; Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs ), 
including International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) of Technical Requirements for 
Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Guidelines; FDA regulatory requirements and in 
accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, all applicable 
local laws and regulatory requirements relevant to the use of new therapeutic agents in the 
countries involved will be adhered to. 
The Investigator should submit written reports of clinical study status to their Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)  annually or more frequently if requested by the IRB. A final study 
notification will also be forwarded to the IRB after the study is completed or in the event of 
premature termination of the study in accordance with the applicable regulations. Copies of all contact with the IRB should be maintained in the study documents file. Copies of clinical study 
status reports (including termination) should be provided to BioCryst. 
14.1.2. Institutional Review Board Approvals 
Before initiation of the study at each investigational site, the protocol, the informed consent and 
assent form s, the subject information sheet, and any other relevant study documentation will be 
submitted to the appropriate IRB. Written approval of the study must be obtained before the 
investigational medicinal product is released to the Investigator and the study site may be opened 
for enrollment. Any necessary extensions or renewals of IRB approval must be obtained, in 
particular, for changes to the study such as modification of the protocol, the informed consent and assent  form s, the written information provided to subjects / parents/caregivers  and/or other 
procedures. 
The I nvestigator will report promptly to the IRB any new information that may adversely affect 
the safety of the subjects or the conduct of the study. On completion of the study, the 
Investigator will provide the IRB with a report of the outcome of the study. 
14.1.3. Subject Informed Consent  
Signed informed consent must be obtained from each parent/caregiver prior to performing any 
study- related procedures.  Similarly , subject assent by subjects ≥ 7 years will be obtained from 
each child or adolescent prior to performing any study- related procedures. If the local IRB or 
state requirements limit the age of assent, then assent will be obtained based on those 
requirements but in all cases assent will be obtained for adolescents 14 and older.  Each 
parent/caregiver  should be given both verbal and written information describing the nature and 
duration of the clinical study. The informed consent process should take place under conditions 
where the parent/caregiver  has adequate time to consider the risks and benefits associated w ith 
his/her child’s participation in the study. Subjects will not be screened or treated until the parent/caregiver  has signed an approved informed consent form ( ICF) written in a language in 
which the subject is fluent.  
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 
66 The ICF and assent form  that is use d must be approved both by BioCryst and by the reviewing 
IRB.  The informed consent should be in accordance with the current revision of the Declaration 
of Helsinki, current ICH and GCP guidelines, and BioCryst policy. 
The Investigator must explain to potential subjects and their parent/ caregiver  the aims, methods, 
reasonably anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the trial and any discomfort it may 
entail.  Each parent/caregiver will be informed that they are free for their child not to participate 
in the trial and that they may withdraw consent for their child to participate at any time.  They 
will be told that refusal for their child to participate in the study will not prejudice future 
treatment.  They will also be told that their child’s records may be examined by competent 
authorities and authorized persons but that personal information will be treated as strictly confidential and will not be publicly available. 
Parents/caregivers and s ubjects must be given the opportunity to ask questions. After t his 
explanation and before entry into the trial, consent should be appropriately recorded by means of 
the parent’s/caregiver’s  dated signature.  The parent/ caregiver  should receive a signed and dated 
copy of the ICF , and, if applicable, the assent. The ori ginal signed informed consent should be 
retained in the study files.  The Investigator shall maintain a log of all subjects  for whom consent 
was signed and indicate if the subject was enrolled into the study or reason for non- enrollment.  
14.1.4. Payment to Subjects  
Reasonable compensation to parents/caregivers of study subjects may be provided if approved by 
the IRB responsible for the study at the Investigator’s site. 
14.1.5. Investigator Reporting Requirements  
The Investigator will provide timely reports regarding safety to his/her IRB as required. 
14.2. Study Monitoring  
During trial conduct, BioCryst or its designee will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure 
that the protocol and GCPs are being followed. The monitors may review source documents to 
confirm that the data r ecorded on CRFs is accurate. The I nvestigator and treating institution, if 
applicable, will allow BioCryst monitors or its designees and appropriate regulatory authorities 
direct access to source documents to perform this verification. 
14.3. Quality Assurance  
The trial site may be subject to review by the IRB, and/or to quality assurance audits performed 
by BioCryst, or designee, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. 
It is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.  
14.4. Study Termination and Site Closure  
BioCryst reserves the right to discontinue the trial prior to inclusion of the intended number of subjects but intends only to exercise this right for valid scientific or administrative reasons. After 
such a decision, the Investigator must contact all participating subjects ’ parents/ care givers 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Version 6.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX1812-305 
 
67 immediately after notification. As directed by BioCryst, all study materials must be collected and 
all case report forms completed to the greatest extent possible.  
14.5. Records Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or BioCryst, the Investigator agrees to keep records, including t he identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information 
to link records, case report forms and hospital records), all original signed informed consent and assent  forms, copies of all case report forms and detailed records of treatment disposition. The 
records should be retained by the Investigator according to local regulations or as specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement, whichever is longer.  
If the Investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the study, the study records may be transferred to an acceptable designee, such as another Investigator, another 
institution, or to BioCryst. The Investigator must obtain BioCryst’s written permission before disposing of any records. 
14.6. Confidentiality of Information  
BioCryst affirms the  subject’s right to protection against invasion of privacy. Only a subject 
identification number, initials and/or date of birth will identify subject data retrieved by BioCryst . However, in compliance with federal regulations, BioCryst requires the Investigator to 
permit BioCryst’s representatives and, when necessary, representatives of the FDA or other 
regulatory authorities  to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study.  
BioCryst will ensure that the use and disclosure of protected health information obtained during 
a research study complies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPA A) 
Privacy Rule, where this rule is applicable. The Rule provides federal protection for the privacy of protected health information by implementing standards to protect and guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information of subjects participating in BioCryst -
sponsored Clinical Trials. “Authorization” is required from each research subject, i.e., specified permiss ion granted by an individual to a covered entity for the use or disclosure of an 
individual's protected health information. A valid authorization must meet the implementation 
specifications under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Authorization may be combined in the Informed 
Consent document (approved by the IRB) or it may be a separate document, (approved by the 
IRB) or provided by the Investigator or Sponsor (without IRB approval). It is the responsibility 
of the I nvestigator and treating institution , if applicable, to obtain such waiver/authorization in 
writing from the appropriate individual. HIPAA authorizations are required for U.S. sites only.

 DIVISION OF AIDS TABLE FOR GRADING THE SEVERITY OF   
ADULT AND PEDIATRIC ADVERSE EVENTS  
VERSION 1.0,  DECEMBER, 2004; CLARIFICATION AUGUST 2009  
The Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severi ty of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (“DAIDS AE 
Grading Table”) is a descriptive terminology which can be utilized for Adverse Event (AE) reporting. A 
grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE term. 
This clarification of the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric AE’s provides 
additional explanation of the DAIDS AE Grading T able and clarifies some of the parameters.  
I. Instructions and Clarifications 
Grading Adult and Pediatric AEs 
The DAIDS AE Grading Table includes parameters for grading both Adult and Pediatric AEs.  When a 
single set of parameters is not appropriate for grading specific types of AEs for both Adult and Pediatric 
populations, separate sets of parameters for Adult and/ or Pediatric populations (with specified respective 
age ranges) are given in the Table.  If there is no distinction in the Table between Adult and Pediatric 
values for a type of AE, then the single set of parameters listed is to be used for grading the severity of 
both Adult and Pediatric ev ents of that type.   
Note:  In the classification of adverse events, the term “ severe ” is not  the same as “ serious.” 
Severity is an indication of the intensity  of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe chest 
pain). The term “ serious ” relates to a participant/event outcome or action criteria , usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a participant’s life or functioning.  
Addenda 1-3 Grading Tables for Microbicide Studies 
For protocols involving topical application of produ cts to the female genital tract, male genital area or 
rectum, strong consideration should be given to us ing Appendices I-III as the primary grading scales for 
these areas. The protocol would need to specifically state that one or  more of the Appendices would be 
primary (and thus take precedence over the main Grading Table) for items that are listed in both the 
Appendix and the main Grading Table. 
• Addendum 1 - Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies - PDF 
• Addendum 2 - Male Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies - PDF 
• Addendum 3 - Rectal Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies  -PDF 
Grade 5  
For any AE where the outcome is death, the se verity of the AE is classified as Grade 5.   
Estimating Severity Grade for Parameters Not Identified in the Table In order to grade a clinical AE that is not  identified in the DAIDS AE grading table, use the category 
“Estimating Severity Grade” located on Page 3. 
Determining Severity Grade for Parameters “Between Grades” 
If the severity of a clinical AE could fall under either one of two grades (e.g., the severity of an AE could 
be either Grade 2 or Grade 3), select the higher of the two grades for the AE. If a laboratory value that is 
graded as a multiple of the ULN or LLN falls between two grades, select the higher of the two grades for 
the AE. For example, Grade 1 is 2.5 x ULN and Grade 2 is 2.6 x ULN for a parameter. If the lab value is 
2.53 x ULN (which is between the two grades), the severity of this AE would be Grade 2, the higher of the 
two grades. 
Values Below Grade 1  
Any laboratory value that is between either the LLN or ULN and Grade 1 should not be graded.

VERSION 1.0,  DECEMBER, 2004; CLARIFICATION AUGUST 2009  
Determining Severity Grade when Local Laboratory Normal Values Overlap with Grade 1 Ranges 
In these situations, the severity grading is based on the ranges in the DAIDS AE Grading Table, even 
when there is a reference to the local lab LLN. For example: Phosphate, Serum, Low, Adult and P ediatric > 14 years (Page 20) Grade 1 range is 2.50 
mg/dL - < LLN. A particular laboratory’s normal range for Phos phate is 2.1 – 3.8 mg/dL. A participant’s 
actual lab value is 2.5.  In this case, the value of  2.5 exceeds the LLN for the local lab, but will be graded 
as Grade 1 per DAIDS AE Grading Table .

Hemoglobin (Hgb) 
Comment: The Hgb values in mmol/L have changed because the conver sion factor used to convert g/dL to mmol/L has been 
changed from 0.155 to 0.6206 (the most co mmonly used conversion factor).  For grading  Hgb results obtained by an analytic 
method with a conversion factor other than 0.6206, the result must be converted to g/dL using the appropriate conversion factor 
for that lab.

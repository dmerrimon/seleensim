 1 1. RCT Details  
This section provides a high -level overview of a published RCT that the described real -world evidence study is trying to replicate 
as closely as possible given the remaining limitations inherent in the healthcare databases.  
 
1.1 Title 
Efficacy and  Safety Comparison of Liraglutide,  Glimepiride, and Placebo, All in Combination With Metformin, in Type 2 
Diabetes . The LEAD (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes) -2 study  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). 
 1.2 Intended aim(s)  
To assess whether the glycemic control  achieved by adding  liraglutide to metformin was non-inferior to glimepiride and 
metformin combination therapy  after 26 weeks of tr eatment , in subjects with type 2 diabetes and previously treated with  
oral antidiabetic  therapy .  
 
1.3 Primary endpoint for replication  
Long -term glycemic control defined as change in HbA1c from baseline to the end of follow -up.  
 
1.4 Required power for primary endpoint and noninferiority margin (if applicable)  
The sample size calculation w as based on both HbA1c and body weight endpoints . The assumed standard deviation for 
HbA1c and the coefficient of variance for body weight were 1.2% and 3%, respectively. The c ombined power (calculated as 
the product of the marginal powers for HbA1c and body weight) was at least 85%. Noninferiority of glycemic control with 
liraglutide versus glimepiride was concluded if the upper limit of the two -sided 95% CI for the treatment d ifference was < 
0.4%.  
With a standard deviation of 1.2% for HbA1c and a coefficient of variance of 3% for body weight , it was concluded that at 
least 168 subjects were required to complete the treatment in the  liraglutide and in the  glimepiride , respectively.  Assuming 
a dropout rate of 25% after 26 weeks of treatment, the number of subjects to be randomized was calculated to be 228 in each of the liraglutide and  glimepiride treatment groups.

 2 The HbA1c mean decreases of 1.0% (± 0.1) for both the 1.2 and 1.8 mg /day  liraglutide groups and 1.0% ( ± 0.1) for 
glimepiride group. Treatment difference in HbA1c was 0.0% [ 95% CI: -0.2 to 0.2] for both comparisons liraglutide 1.2 
mg/day versus  glimepiride and liraglutide 1.8 mg/day versus glimepiride  (Nauck M  et al. 2009) .

 4 5. Cohort Identification  
 
5.1 Cohort Summary 
This study will involve a new user, parallel group, propensity score -matched, retrospective cohort design comparing  injectable 
subcutaneous liraglutide  (1.2 or 1.8 mg/day ) to oral glimepiride  (4 mg once daily ). Treatments in both arms are administered in 
combination with metformin (up to 2,000 mg/day ). Patients will be  required to have continuous enrollment during a baseline 
period of 180 days before initiation of liraglutide or glimepiride . The analyses will be restricted to individuals with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus who have been  previously treated with antidiabetic drugs . In the replication, previous anti -diabetic treatment was 
defined as the presence of at least 2 prescriptions for metformin within 6 months before and including cohort entry . 
 
5.2 Important steps for cohort formation  
New use  of liraglutide  (exposure) is defined as no use of the exposure drug  with in 180 days  prior to index date . New use of 
glimepiride  (comparator) is defined as no use of the comparator  drug with in 180 days prior to index date.  Eligible patients are 
required to be new users with respect to both exposure and comparator groups ( i.e., no use of both exposure and comparator 
drugs ) within 180 days prior to index date .  
 
5.2.1 Eligible cohort entry dates  
Liraglutide  indication as an adjunct  to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus  
was approved by FDA on Jan 25, 2010 (the approval of glimepiride  for the same indication was antecedent to 20 10).  
Thus, the initial eligible cohort entry date is the first date after the FDA approval  available in the data .  
The last eligible date  is June 30, 2020, three months before the  end of all available data  in Optum CDM . Since the effects 
of liraglutide and glimepiride on the outcome (i.e., change in HbA1c)  will be estimated  between 56 and 212 days after  
cohort entry  (see Section 6.3), this will allow all eligible patients to contribute to the outcome.  
The database used is Optum CDM because  lab results/values are available in th is database for a subset of labo ratory tests, 
including the A1C tests.  The following eligible cohort entry dates were included:   
 
• Optum CDM: Jan 26, 20 10 – Jun 30, 2020  
 
5.2.2 Specify inclusion/exclusion  criteria  for cohort entry and define the index date  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adapted from the trial as closely as possible. Definitions for all inclusion/exclusion are 
provided in Appendix A and are summarized in the flowcharts below.

 5 Note. Patients who are censored between cohort entry and the beginning of the outcome assessment window (i.e., 0.x-56 
days after cohort entry ) for the reasons reported in the Section  6.3.2 will not contribute to the unmatched or matched 
cohorts.  Further details on the number of  patients who are excluded from the study cohort are reported in the Section  7.

6. Variables  
 
6.1 Exposure -related variables:  
 
Study drug:  
New initiation of injectable subcutaneous liraglutide  (1.2 or 1.8 mg/day ), a glucagon -like peptide -1 receptor agonist . New 
initiation is defined as no use of liraglutide  with in 180 days before treatme nt initiation (washout period).  New users of liraglutide  
are not allowed to receive glimepiride  within 180 days prior to treatment initiation . Concurrent use of metformin is required 
(2,000 mg/day ). 
 
Comparator agent : 
New initiation  of oral glimepiride (4 mg once daily ). New i nitiation is defined as no use of glimepiride  with in 180 days before 
treatme nt initiation (washout period).  New users of glimepiride  are not allowed to receive liraglutide  within 180 days prior to 
treatment initiation . Concurrent use of metformin is required (2,000 mg/day ). 
 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
 
 7 6.2 Preliminary Covariates:  
• Age 
• Gender  
• Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the baseline covariate assessment period, defined as 180 days prior to 
and including index date . 
 
Covariates listed above represent only a small subset of covariates that will ultimately be controlled for in the design and analys is. We use the covariates above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be sufficient overl ap 
between treatment groups to proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has passed the 
initial feasibility analysis and the initial power assessment  and are listed in Table 1 ( Appendix B ).  
 6.3 Outcome variables and study follow -up:  
 
6.3.1 Outcome variables  
 
Effectiveness outcome variables of interest (definitions provided in Appendix A):  
 
§ Primary outcome:  Changes in HbA1c from baseline to 26 weeks of treatment (end of follow -up). 
 
Note . In the trial, HbA1c was also measured at 8, 12, 18 weeks ( ± 3 days)  after randomization . Missing values of HbA1c at 
26 weeks were replaced using last observation carried forward (LOCF) in the intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis  set. 
In the replication, HbA1c at baseline  will be defined as the last recorded HbA1c value measured within 90 days before and 
including cohort entry  date in both groups . HbA1c at the end of follow -up will be  defined as a recorded HbA1c value closest 
to the end of the 26th week and measured between 56 and 212 days ( 8-30 weeks)  after cohort entry .  
 
§ Secondary outcome : -- 
 
6.3.2 Primary analysis and s tudy follow -up 
As-treated  (AT) analysis will be performed as main analysis . The treatment drug will be defined as the index drug assigned on the 
day of cohort entry. Patients will be followed for about 30 weeks ( 212 days) . Compared to the trial  (Nauck M  et al. 2009) , we will 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
 
 8 extend the follow -up and the outcome assessment periods of 4 weeks . The follow -up and outcome assessment  window will start 56 
days after cohort entry date and will continue until the earliest date of the following events:   
§ The first occurrence of the outcome of interest  (measured between 56 and 212 days after cohort entry) , 
§ The date of end of continuous registration in the database  (disenrollment or end of available data),  
§ End of the study period,  
§ Measured death event occurs,  
§ Index drug s discontinuation (liraglutide, gli mepiride or metformin) , 
§ Crossover or addition of drug from the other treatment group,  
§ Addition of any other anti -diabetic medications,  
§ Nursing home admission  
o Nursing home admissions are considered a censoring event because the data sources utilized typically provide little to 
no data on a patient, particularly on drug utilization, after admission. We will utilize this as an exclusion reason for cohorts for the same reason.    
 
Note . To decrease the incidence of missing values of the outcome ( specifica lly, missing of HbA1c values  measured  between 56 -212 
days  after cohort entry ), we required that the eligible  patients  had at least 3 HbA1c measurement s recorded within 365 days before  
and including  cohort entry.  This will increase the probability of includ ing in the final cohort patients who are adherent to a routinely 
HbA1c testing  and, consequently, will decrease the frequency of missing values of the outcome.  Multiple imputation will be used to 
handle missing values in the primary analysis, while complete case  analysis will be applied in a sensitivity analysis.

PRIMARY OUTCOME
INCLUSION CRITERIA
1 Body mass index (BMI) >= 40.0 kg/m2.Measured 180 days prior to and including the day of drug initiation inpatient (any position), outpatient (any 
position):
Morbid obesity diagnosis or BMI >= 40 kg/m2:
ICD 9 diagnosis:: 278.01, 278.03, V85.4x
ICD 10 diagnosis: E66.01, E66.2, Z68.4x
NB. Codes for bariatric surgey, complications of bariatric surgery and prescriptions of drugs for weight loss were not 
included in the measure since this exclusion criterion aims to exclude specifically patients with morbid obesity. Codes for 
obesity during pregnancy were not included because of the exclusion criterion #17.

due to intercurrent illness at the discretion of the investigator).Measured 180 days prior to and including the day of drug initiation:
NDC Generic Name:
Please refer to Insulin  in "Anti-diabetic treatments"
NB. Although the trial excluded patients in treatment with insulin within the 90 days before drug initiation, with real-
world data we are required to be more conservative and to extend the washout period to 180 days. In fact, a 90-day 
washout applied in real world does not  garantee the exclusion of prevalent users (i.e. patients on active insulin therapy) 
from the cohort.

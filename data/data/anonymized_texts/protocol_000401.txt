(ppFEV 1) from baseline at Week 12  
Secondary Endpoints  
• Absolute change in sweat chloride concentrations from baseline at Week  12 
• PK parameters of VX -561, IVA, and relevant metabolites  
• Safety and tolerability, based on the assessment of adverse events (AEs), 
laboratory test results, standard 12 -lead ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry  
  
Number of Subjects  Approximately 88  subjects were planned to enroll in 5 treatment arms (25  mg 
once daily [ qd] VX-561, 50 mg qd VX -561, 150 mg qd VX -561, 250 mg qd 
VX-561, and IVA 150 mg every 12 hours [ q12h ]) in a ratio of 1:2:2:2:1 under the 
original protocol. The 25  mg qd  VX-561 and 50 mg qd VX -561 treatment arms 
were discontinued; 44  subjects had been enrolled and randomized to the 
5 treatment arms at this point. The remaining subjects planned to enroll will be 
randomized 2:2:1 to 3  treatment arms (250 mg qd VX -561, 150  mg qd VX -561, 
and IVA 150 mg q12h).

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 4 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Strength and route of administration : 150-mg film -coated tablet for oral 
administration  
 
Study Duration  Including the Screening Period, each subject will participate in the study for 
approximately 20 weeks  
  
Study Design  This is a Phase 2 study of VX -561 monotherapy. A schematic of the study design 
is shown in Figure 2-1, which is randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, and 
active -controlled. The study will evaluate 4 dose levels of VX -561 in subjects 
with CF who have a gating mutation and were previously taking a stable dose of 
IVA. Randomization will be stratified by ppFEV 1 value at screening (<70 versus 
≥70).  
The original protocol included 25 mg qd VX -561 and 50 mg qd VX -561 treatment 
arms; both treatment arms were discontinued in the current protocol (  
). 
Figure 2-1 VX18 -561-101 Study Design  
 
a Approximately 88  subjects were planned to enroll in 5 treatment arms (25  mg 
qd VX -561, 50 mg qd VX -561, 150 mg qd VX -561, 250 mg qd VX -561, and 
IVA 150 mg q12h) in a ratio of 1:2:2:2:1 under the original protocol. The 
25 mg qd VX -561 and 50 mg qd VX -561 treatment arms were discontinued;  
44 subjects had been enrolled and randomized to the 5 treatment arms at this 
point. The remaining subjects planned to enroll will be randomized 2:2:1 to 
3 treatment arms (250 mg qd VX -561, 150  mg qd VX -561, and IVA 150 mg 
q12h).  
  
Study Rationale  This s tudy is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and PD effect (i.e., change 
in sweat chloride) for a range of VX -561 doses to support VX -561 dose selection 
for future studies, including studies of VX -561 in triple combination (TC) with 
CFTR correctors, su ch as VX -121 and TEZ.  
Subjects will be on stable IVA treatment at baseline and will be randomized to 
study drug treatment groups on Day 1 (VX -561 or IVA). Change in ppFEV 1 from 
IVA baseline is the primary endpoint. However, dose selection of VX -561 for 
future studies may consider the totality of data, including exposure -response 
analyses for efficacy (ppFEV 1) and PD (sweat chloride) endpoints.

Statistical Analyses  The following efficacy analyses will be conducted for ppFEV 1 and sweat chloride:  
The analysis of the absolute chan ge in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 12 will be 
based on a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (including 250 mg qd 
VX-561, 150 mg qd VX -561, and IVA 150 mg q12h treatment arms only). The 
primary results will be the within -group comparison for each VX -561 arm. The 
adjusted mean with a 2 -sided 95% CI will be provided. Between -group estimates 
of each VX -561 arm and IVA arm will also be provided.  
The analysis of the absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at Week  12 
will be conducted similarly to p pFEV 1 (including 250 mg qd VX -561, 150 mg qd 
VX-561, and IVA 150 mg q12h treatment arms only).  
A sequential approach will be used to perform the population PK/PD analyses for 
VX-561. Bayesian estimates of individual PK parameters from the final 
population  PK model will be used to simulate PK profiles for each subject, which 
will be used in exposure -response models to describe changes in sweat chloride 
and ppFEV1 from baseline.  
Safety analyses for all treatment arms (including the 25 mg qd VX -561 and 50 mg  
qd VX -561 treatment arms  that were discontinued ) will be conducted to support 
the dose selection. Descriptive analyses will be provided for the safety data 
comprising AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs, vital signs, and pulse 
oximetry; no statisti cal hypothesis testing will be performed. The PK results for 
VX-561, IVA, and relevant metabolites will be reported with descriptive statistics.  
Sample size  
Based on the initial study design that included 4 dose groups of VX -561 and an 
IVA 150 mg q12h dose  group,  assuming  a within -group SD of 7 percentage points 
and a 10% dropout rate at Week 12: a sample size of 22  subjects in the 50, 150, 
and 250 mg qd VX -561 arms will provide a 95% CI of ± 3.4 percentage points 
around the observed mean absolute change in  ppFEV1 from baseline at Week 12, 
based on 2 -sided, 1 -sample t statistics; a sample size of 11 subjects in the other 
arms will provide a 95% CI of ± 5.4 percentage points around the observed mean.   
Following discontinuation of the 25 mg qd VX -561 and 50 mg  qd VX -561 
treatment arms, the remaining subjects planned to enroll will be randomized in a 
2:2:1 ratio to the 3 current treatment arms with a sample size of approximately 
28 subjects for the 250 mg qd VX -561 treatment arm, approximately 28 subjects 
for th e 150 mg qd VX -561 treatment arm, and approximately 14 subjects for the 
IVA 150 mg q12h treatment arm. The total study sample size including 
discontinued arms and current arms is approximately maintained as planned 
(N = 88). Under the same assumption as th e original design (within -group SD of 
7 percentage points and 10% dropout rate at Week  12): a sample size of 
28 subjects in the 250  mg qd VX -561 and 150 mg qd VX -561 arms will provide a 
95% CI of ± 2.9 percentage points around the observed mean absolute ch ange in 
ppFEV1 from baseline at Week 12, based on 2 -sided, 1 -sample t statistics; a 
sample size of 14 subjects in the IVA 150 mg q12h arm will provide a 95% CI of 
± 4.4 percentage points around the observed mean.  
  
IDMC Reviews  An independent data monito ring committee (IDMC) will conduct safety reviews 
of study data as outlined in the IDMC charter. The planned IDMC reviews (with 
reference to number of subjects and duration of study) will be specified in the 
IDMC charter.

k  Spirometry may be performed pre - or post -bronchodilator at the Screening Visit. At other study visits, spirometry will be done pre -bronchodilator, before the morning dose of 
study drug, and should be performed at approximately the same time at every visit.  
l  The serum β -hCG test is to be performed for all female subjects at Screening. Subsequent urine or serum β -hCG tests are to be performed as indicated for women of 
childbearing potential. A definition of non -childbearing potential is provided in Section  11.5.5.1 . 
m  CFTR  geno typing will be performed for all subjects. If the screening CFTR  genotype result is not received before randomization , a previous CFTR  genotype laboratory report 
may be used to establish eligibility. Subjects who have been randomized and whose screening ge notype does not confirm study eligibility must be discontinued from the 
study.  
n  FSH will be measured for any suspected postmenopausal female subjects with at least 12 months of continuous spontaneous ameno rrhea.  
o  Blood samples will be collected for PK analysis of VX -561 and metabolites or IVA and metabolites. The sample collected at Screening will be collected without regard to 
 time of IVA dosing. On Day 1, samples will be collected before dosing (0  hours) and at 4  hours after dosing (relative to the m orning dose). At Day 15, Week 4, Week 8, and 
 Week  12, a predose sample will be collected before the morning dose. In a subset of subjects (up to approximately 20 subjects), ad ditional samples will be collected at the 
 Week 4 visit at 1, 2, 4, and 6  hours after dosing (relative to the morning dose). At the Washout Visit, a single sample will be collected prior to resumption of I VA. A single 
 sample will be collected at the Safety Follow -up Visit for analysis of IVA for those subjects who resume IVA therapy.  Acceptable PK sampling windows are provided in 
 Table  11-1. At the ETT Visit, a single blood sample for PK analysis will be collected.  
p  Study drug will be administered orally twice daily (Section  9.6). The last dose of study drug will be the morning dose on the Week 12 Visit. S ubjects may resume their prior 
IVA therapy  after the Washout Visit.  
q  All medications taken from 28  days before the Screening Period through the end of the study will be recorded (Section  9.5).

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, chronic disease with serious morbidities and 
frequent premature mortality. At present, there is no cure. CF affects more than 
70,000  individuals worldwide.1 Based on its prevalence, CF qualifies as an orphan dise ase.2, 3  
CF is caused by reduced quantity and/or function of the CFTR protein due to mutations in the 
CFTR  gene. The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel that aids in regulating salt and 
water absorption and secretion and pH balance in sweat glands and multiple organs, including 
the lungs, pancreas, and other gastrointestinal (GI) organs. Despite pro gress in the treatment of 
CF with antibiotics and mucolytics, the predicted median age of survival for a person with CF is 
approximately 40  years.4, 5 Progressive loss of lung function is the leading cause of mortality.6 
There are more than 2000 vari ants described in the CFTR  gene. The most commonly seen 
variants that are clearly associated with CF have been identified (336 to date), but many rare 
cases remain uncharacterized.7  
Based on the understanding of the molecular defects caused by these CFTR  mutations, 
2 complementary approaches have been developed to address the decreased quantity and/or 
function of CFTR in order to enhance chloride transport in patients with C F. Correctors facilitate 
the cellular processing and trafficking to increase the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. 
Potentiators increase the channel -open probability of the CFTR protein delivered to the cell 
surface to enhance ion transport. Depending on the CFTR  genotype of the patient, both 
approaches may be required to ameliorate lung disease in patients with CF.  
The therapeutic activity of CFTR correctors and potentiators has been established with products 
that were developed by Vertex and approved  for the treatment of CF: ivacaftor (IVA) 
monotherapy (Kalydeco®), lumacaftor (LUM) in combination with IVA (Orkambi®), and 
tezacaftor (TEZ) in combination with IVA ( Symdeko™, Symkevi®). Kalydeco, Orkambi, and 
Symdeko are approved to treat CF in patients w ith specific CFTR  genotypes. TEZ and LUM are 
first-generation CFTR correctors that improve the processing and trafficking of mutated CFTR 
protein, resulting in an increase in the quantity of protein at the cell surface. IVA increases the 
open -channel proba bility of the mutated CFTR protein that has been delivered to the cell surface, 
thereby enhancing total chloride transport. For the most common CF -causing mutation, F508del , 
the combined effect of either LUM and IVA or TEZ and IVA is increased quantity and  function 
of F508del -CFTR at the cell surface.  
VX-561 is a deuterated isotope of IVA with a specific pattern of 9  substituted deuteriums. In 
vitro data indicate similar potency of VX -561 in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells relative 
to IVA. Safety pha rmacology and nonclinical toxicology studies of VX -561 demonstrate a 
similar safety profile relative to IVA. Phase 1 clinical studies in healthy subjects have shown that 
VX-561 had a reduced rate of clearance, increased exposure, greater plasma levels at 2 4 hours, 
and a longer half -life compared to IVA, thereby supporting once daily dosing (refer to VX -561 
Investigator’s Brochure). In healthy subject studies to date, the safety profile of VX -561 is 
considered similar to IVA.  

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 15 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   5.2 Study Rationale  
This study is be ing conducted to evaluate the efficacy and pharmacodynamic (PD) effect 
(i.e., change in sweat chloride) for a range of VX -561 doses to support VX -561 dose selection 
for future studies, including studies of VX -561 in triple combination (TC) with CFTR correc tors, 
such as VX -121 and TEZ. Subjects will be on stable IVA treatment at baseline and will be 
randomized to study drug treatment groups on Day 1 (VX -561 or IVA). Change in ppFEV 1 from 
IVA baseline is the primary endpoint. However, dose selection of VX -561 for future studies may 
consider the totality of data, including exposure -response analyses for efficacy (percent predicted 
forced expiratory volume in 1 second [ppFEV 1]) and PD (sweat chloride) endpoints.  
6 STUDY OBJECTIVES   
6.1 Primary Objective  
 To evaluate t he efficacy of VX -561  
6.2 Secondary Objectives  
 To evaluate the PD effect of VX -561  
 To evaluate the pharmacokinetics  (PK) of VX -561, IVA, and relevant metabolites  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of VX -561 
7 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
7.1 Primary Endpoint  
 Absolute cha nge in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 12  
7.2 Secondary Endpoints  
 Absolute change in sweat chloride concentrations from baseline at Week 12  
 PK parameters of VX -561, IVA, and relevant metabolites  
 Safety and tolerability, based on the assessment of adverse events ( AEs), laboratory test 
results, standard 12 -lead ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   9 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION  
9.1 Study Design  
This is a Phase 2 study of VX -561 monotherapy. A schematic of the study design is shown in 
Figure 9-1, which is  randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, and active -controlled. The study 
will evaluate 4 dose levels of VX -561 in subjects with CF who have a gating mutation and were 
previously taking a stable dose of IVA. Randomization will be stratified by ppFEV 1 value at 
screening (<70 versus ≥70). 
The original protocol  included 25 mg once daily ( qd) and 50 mg qd VX -561 treatment arms; 
both were discontinued in the current protocol ( ).  
Figure 9-1 VX18 -561-101 Study Design  
 
a Approximately 88  subjects were planned to enroll in 5 treatment arms (25  mg qd VX -561, 50 mg qd VX -561, 
150 mg qd VX -561, 250 mg qd VX -561, and IVA 150 mg  every 12 hours  [q12h ]) in a ratio of 1:2:2:2:1 under 
the original protocol. The 25  mg qd VX -561 and 50 mg qd VX -561 treatment arms were discontinued; 
44 subjects had been enrolled and randomized to the 5 treatment arms at this point. The remaining subjects 
planned to enroll will be randomized 2:2:1 to 3 treatment arms (250 mg qd VX -561, 150  mg qd VX -561, and 
IVA 150  mg q12h).  
9.1.1  Screening  
Screening Visit assessments are listed in Table  3-1. 
The Screening Period will occur within 28  days before administra tion of study drug. Screening 
assessments will be used to confirm that subjects meet eligibility criteria. The investigator (or an 
appropriate authorized designee at the study site) will obtain informed consent from each subject 
before any study procedures  takes place.  
9.1.1.1  Repetition of Screening Assessment(s)  
Screening assessments may be repeated once to establish study eligibility.  If repeat values of the 
individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and completed within the screening 
window, then the subject is eligible for the study.  
9.1.1.2  Rescreening  
Subjects may be rescreened only once. If a subject is rescreened, all screening assessments will 
be repeated except for CFTR  genotyping, follicle -stimulating hormone  (FSH) level (if serum

rescreened, the new screening window will begin once the first rescreening assessment has been 
initiated.  
9.1.1.3  Extension of Screening Period Window  
The Screening Period window may b e extended by 2  weeks for the following reasons:  
 Repetition of the Screening assessments (Section  9.1.1.1 ) 
 Unexpected operational or logistic delay s, or to meet the eligibility criteria  
 Repetition of spirometry assessment if results are of poor quality  
9.1.2  Treatment Period  
The Treatment Period will last approximately 12 weeks. Treatment Period assessments are listed 
in Table  3-1. Dosing details are in Section  9.6. 
9.1.3  Washout Period  
The Washout Period will last approximately 4  days.  
The study visits during the Washout Period will occur as shown in Table  3-1. 
9.1.4  Follow -up 
Subjects will have a Safety  Follow -up Visit 28  (± 7) days after the last dose of study drug. Safety 
Follow -up Visit assessments are listed in Table  3-1. 
9.1.5  Early Termination of Treatment  OR Early Discontinuation  
If a subject prematurely discontinues study treatment, an Early Termination of Treatment (ETT) 
Visit should be scheduled as soon a s possible after the subject decides to terminate study 
treatment. Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment will also be required to complete the 
Safety Follow -up Visit, approximately 28 (±  7) days after their last dose of study drug. The 
assessments  performed at the Safety Follow -up Visit are listed in Table  3-1. 
Subjects who discontinue from study drug dosing for any reason (except withdrawal of consent) 
will h ave a final PK blood sample drawn as soon as possible after the decision to discontinue 
study drug is made. Additional safety assessments may also be performed at the discretion of the 
investigator, including possible consultation with a specialist consult ant. The Vertex medical 
monitor will be informed about these additional assessments, and any additional data collected 
(e.g.,  as the result of an outside consultation) will be considered part of the study record to 
provide the most complete safety profile of the study drug.  
If the ETT Visit occurs 3  weeks or later following the last dose of study drug, then the ETT Visit 
will replace the Safety Follow -up Visit, and a separate Safety Follow -up Visit will not be 
required.  
If a subject withdraws consent for t he study, no further assessments will be performed, and no 
additional data should be collected. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data and samples 
collected before such withdrawal of consent.  

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 20 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   9.1.6  Lost to Follow -up 
A subject will be considered lost to f ollow -up if both of the following occur:  
 The subject misses 2  consecutive study visits (telephone contact and/or clinic visit) and is 
subsequently unable to be contacted by telephone (3  documented attempts by telephone 
within 2  weeks following the second m issed visit).  
 The subject does not respond within 2  weeks to a registered letter sent  after the 3  attempted 
telephone contacts.  
9.1.7  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
Safety and tolerability data will be reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee 
(IDMC) to ensure the safety of the subjects (Section  12.3.6 ). Procedural details of the IDMC’s 
structure and function, frequency of meetings, and data planned for review will be in the IDMC 
charter. The IDMC charter will be finalized before the first subject is screened.  
9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to assign subjects to tre atment. A 
randomization list will be produced by Vertex Biostatistics or a qualified randomization vendor. 
The Vertex study biostatistician will review and approve the dummy randomization list. The 
final randomization list will be reviewed and approved by a designated unblinded biostatistician 
who is not a member of the study execution team (SET).  
Subjects will be assigned a unique subject number. Only subjects who have completed screening 
assessments and are eligible for participation in the study will be randomized to receive study 
drug during the Treatment Period. Randomization will be stratified by ppFEV 1 (<70 versus ≥70) 
determined during screening.  
Approximately 88  subjects were planned to enroll in 5 treatment arms (25  mg qd VX -561, 50 mg 
qd VX -561, 150 mg qd VX -561, 250 mg qd VX -561, and IVA 150 mg q12h) in a ratio of 
1:2:2:2:1 under the original protocol. The 25  mg qd VX -561 and 50 mg qd VX -561 treatment 
arms were discontinued; 44 subjects had been enrolled and randomized to the 5 treatment arms at 
this point. The remaining subjects planned to enroll will be randomized 2:2:1 to 3 treatment arms 
(250 mg qd VX -561, 150  mg qd VX -561, and IVA 150 mg q12h).  
9.3 Rationale for Study Elements  
9.3.1  Study Design  
Subjects will continue their stable IVA treatment throug h screening, and then be randomized to 
study drug treatment groups on Day 1 (VX -561 or IVA). The efficacy and PD of VX -561 will be 
assessed after 12 weeks of randomized treatment. IVA (150  mg every 12 hours [q12h]) is 
included as a reference arm, but with unequal randomization to provide greater information on 
VX-561 dose -ranging. After the Treatment Period, a 3 - to 5-day Washout Period where subjects 
will take no CFTR modulators is included to collect additional PK and PD data and enable a 
more thorough ev aluation of VX -561 exposure -response relationships.  
Following completion of the Washout Period, subjects will resume their prior therapy with 
commercial IVA.  

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 21 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   9.3.2  Study Population  
The study will enroll subjects with CF with a gating mutation (see Section 8.1) to ensure a 
relatively homogenous population to evaluate the efficacy, PK, and PD of VX -561 across a range 
of doses relative to IVA.  
9.3.3  Study Dr ug Dose and Duration  
VX-561 
Four dose levels of VX -561 will be evaluated to provide a broad range of exposure for 
exposure -response  analyses. The original protocol  included 25 mg qd VX -561 and 50  mg qd 
VX-561 tr eatment arms; both treatment arms were discon tinued  in the current protocol   
. A VX -561 dose regimen of 150 mg qd provides exposure 
similar to IVA 150 mg q12h,  including C max, AUC 0-24h, and C trough. Based on the similarity of 
VX-561 and IVA in vitro potency and efficacy in HBE cells, this dose is predicted to provide the 
same effect as IVA on CFTR potentiation, and thus is also expected to result in a similar PD  (i.e., 
sweat chloride) and efficacy (i.e., ppFEV 1) response. The 250  mg qd dose of VX -561 is included 
to provide a range of exposures to enable a more robust exposure -response analysis.   
The 12 -week treatment  duration is considered sufficient to avoid any  carryover of the efficacy or 
PD effect from stable IVA treatment and avoid the need for an extended washout of IVA before 
the start of the Treatment Period.  
IVA 
The IVA dose regimen of 150 mg q12h is the approved regimen for treatment of CF in subjects 
aged 6 years and older who have 1 mutation in the CFTR  gene that is responsive to IVA based 
on clinical and/or in vitro assay data.  
9.3.4  Rationale for Study Assessments  
The PK assessments and safety assessments are standard measurements for clinical studies in 
drug development.  
The PD and efficacy endpoints being evaluated (sweat chloride and spirometry) are widely 
accepted and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant to the study of individuals 
with CF. Sweat chloride was evaluated in the registr ation study of IVA (Kalydeco), and 
spirometry was evaluated in the registration studies of IVA (Kalydeco) and LUM/IVA 
combination therapy (Orkambi).  
9.4 Study Restrictions  
Study restrictions are summarized in Table  9-1. VX -561 and IVA are metabolized extensively 
via CYP3A. Therefore, use of moderate and strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A, which have 
the potential to alter the exposure of VX -561 or IVA w ill be prohibited.  
A non -exhaustive list of study prohibitions and cautions for medication will be provided in the 
Study Reference Manual.

a See Section  9.5 for guidance on concomitant medications.  
9.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Subjects will abstain from all concomitant medications as described in the exclusion criteria 
(Section  8.2) and Study Restrictions ( Table  9-1). 
All medications taken from 28  days before the Screening Period through the end of the study will 
be recorded with indication, route of administration, and start and stop dates of administration. 
All subjects will be questioned about medications from signing  of the ICF through the Safety 
Follow -up Visit.  
 Subjects must remain on a stable CF medication (and supplement) regimen (other than 
protocol -specified changes in CFTR modulator regimen) for their CF from 28  days before 
the Day  1 Visit through the Safety  Follow-up Visit. Stable CF medication regimen is defined 
as the current medication regimen for CF that subjects have been following for at least 
28 days before the Day  1 Visit. Subjects must not initiate long -term treatment with new 
medication from 28  days b efore the Day  1 Visit through the Safety  Follow -up Visit unless 
discussed and approved by the medical monitor.  
 Subjects may receive doses of prednisone or prednisolone of up to 10  mg/day or equivalent 
(chronically), or prednisone or prednisolone 60  mg/day  for up to 5  days, without prior 
approval of the medical monitor.  
 Information about bronchodilator use during the study will be collected and documented. 
Subjects who are using a bronchodilator must have their spirometry assessments performed 
according to the guidelines provided in Section  11.4. 
9.6 Administration  
Study drug will be administered orally twice daily . Subjects will receive the same number of 
tablets each day to maintain the blind. Additional information is provided in the Pharmacy 
Manual.  
Study drug will be administered with a fat -containing meal or snack, consistent with the 
recommendations for admini stration of Kalydeco12, according to the following guidelines:  
 It is recommended that the dose be taken within 30 minutes of the start of the meal or snack.  
 All study drug doses will be administered q12h to maintain the blind. All doses of study drug 
will be taken at approximately the same time each day. For example, the morning dose could 

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 23 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   be taken at 08:00 every morning and the evening dose could be taken at 20:00 every evening 
throughout the study.  
 The date, amount taken, and time of study drug administratio n, including whether food was 
taken with each dose, will be recorded for the 2  doses before PK sample collection and the 
dose received on the morning of PK sample collection.  
 On days of scheduled visits, the morning dose of study drug will be administered at the site 
after predose assessments have been completed. The meal or snack will be provided by the 
site for the morning dose of study drug.  
 A subject’s morning dose can be delayed by up to 6 hours to accommodate predose 
assessments on clinic visit days.  
 For visits after the Day  1 Visit, subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused study 
drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, as appropriate.  
Missed Doses  
 If a subject misses a dose and recalls the missed dose within 6  hours, the subject should take 
the dose with food. If more than 6  hours have elapsed after the usual dosing time, the subject 
should skip that dose and resume the normal schedule for the following dose.  
9.7 Dose Modification for Toxicity  
If any unacceptable toxic ity arises, individual subjects will discontinue dosing (Section  9.1.5 ). 
No dose modifications for toxicity are allowed.  
9.8 Study Drug Interruption and  Stopping Rules  
The medical monitor should be notified of a discontinuation of study drug or an interruption of 
study drug that lasts >72 hours for any reason and of the resumption of study drug after such 
interruption.  
Subjects with new treatment -emergent  ALT or AST elevations of >3  × ULN, or total bilirubin 
>2 × ULN, must be followed closely, including confirmatory testing performed by the central 
laboratory within 48  to 72  hours of the initial finding and subsequent close monitoring of ALT, 
AST, and bili rubin levels, as clinically indicated.  
If a subject cannot return to the site for confirmatory testing, a local laboratory may be used. 
Local laboratory results must be reported immediately to the medical monitor, and the subject 
must have the tests repeat ed and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 
48 to 72 hours).  
Study drug administration must be interrupted  immediately (prior to confirmatory testing) if 
any of the following criteria are met:  
 ALT or AST >8  × ULN  
 ALT or AST >5  × ULN for more than 2  weeks  
 ALT or AST >3  × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2  × ULN and/or clinical 
jaundice  
A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be 
followed closely for clinical progression.  

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 24 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Study drug administration must be discontinued  if subsequent ALT or AST values confirm the 
initial elevation that satisfied the interruption rule (above), and no convincing alternative 
etiology (e.g.,  acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, alcohol ingestion) is identified, regardless of 
whether transaminase levels have improved.  
All subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases and/or bilirubin 
should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline.  
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation and/or increased bilirubin or clinical 
jaundice has been identified, study drug administration may be resumed once transaminases or 
bilirubin return to baseline or are ≤2  × ULN, whichever is higher.  Regardless of the duration of 
interruption, the medical monitor should be notified prior to resumption of study drug. Upon 
resumption of study drug, transaminases and bilirubin should be assessed weekly until the Safety 
Follow -up Visit. If a protocol -defined transaminase or bilirubin elevation interruption threshold 
recurs with rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by repeat 
testing within 48  to 72  hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardles s 
of the presumed etiology . 
Individuals who develop adverse events (AEs) will be monitored closely; consideration should 
be given to the need for additional safety assessments and possible consultation (e.g.,  with a 
dermatologist, GI specialist, or other s pecialist consultant). Any additional data collected (e.g., as 
a result of an outside consultation) will be considered part of the study record to provide the most 
complete safety profile of the study drug.  
9.9 Removal of Subjects  
Subjects may withdraw from t he study at any time at their own request. Subjects may be 
withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Vertex 
for safety, behavior, noncompliance with study procedures, or administrative reasons. A subject 
who w ithdraws from study drug treatment will continue to be followed unless the subject 
withdraws consent.  
Subjects who discontinue study treatment early should continue to return for study assessments, 
as noted in Section  9.1.5 .  
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact the 
subject. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome. The 
investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all 
unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for a Safety Follow -up Visit, if 
applicable (see Section  9.1.5 ), and follow  up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs.  
Subjects who have been enrolled and whose screening CFTR genotype does not confirm study 
eligibility must be discontinued from the study, even if a previous CFTR genotype laboratory 
report was used to establish eligibility.  
If a subject withdraws consent for the study, no further assessments will be performed. Vertex 
may retain and continue using t he study data and samples after the study ends, and may use the 
samples and information in the development of the study compound, for other drugs and 
diagnostics, in publications and presentations, and for education purposes. If a subject withdraws 
from th e study, the study data and samples collected will remain part of the study. A subject will 
not be able to request the withdrawal of his/her information from the study data. A subject may 

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 25 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   request destruction of the samples collected from him/her during the  study as long as those 
samples can be identified as his/her samples.  
Stopping rules are presented in Section  9.8. 
9.10 Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects  who withdraw or are withdrawn for nonsafety reasons during the study drug treatment 
period(s) may be replaced at Vertex’s discretion.  
10 STUDY DRUG INFORMATI ON AND MANAGEMENT  
Study drug refers to VX -561, IVA, and their matching placebos.  
10.1 Preparation and Disp ensing  
Study drug may be dispensed only under the supervision of the investigator or an authorized 
designee and only for administration to the study subjects.  
10.2 Packaging and Labeling  
Study drug tablets will be supplied in blister cards by Vertex. Study drug  labeling will be in 
compliance with applicable local and national regulations . Additional details regarding 
packaging, labeling, and dispensing will be included in the Pharmacy Manual.  
10.3 Study Drug Supply, Storage, and Handling  
The investigator, or an autho rized designee (e.g.,  a licensed pharmacist), will ensure that all 
investigational product is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions, and in 
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. To ensure adequate records, all study d rugs 
will be accounted for via the drug accountability forms as instructed by Vertex.  
VX-561 and matching placebo will be supplied as light blue film -coated tablets of similar size 
and appearance containing 50 mg VX -561, 25 mg VX -561, and 0 mg VX -561, resp ectively. 
Following discontinuation of the 25 mg qd VX -561 treatment arm, the 25 mg VX -561 tablet and 
matching placebo will no longer be distributed to subjects.  
IVA and matching placebo will be supplied as light blue film -coated tablets of similar size an d 
appearance containing 150  mg IVA and 0  mg IVA, respectively.  
Detailed instructions regarding the storage, handling, and dispensation of the study drug will be 
provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
10.4 Drug Accountability  
The pharmacist or designated study site st aff will maintain information about the dates and 
amounts of (1) study drug received; (2) study drug dispensed to the subjects; and (3) study drug 
returned by the subjects. Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused materials 
associated with  the study drug to the site. These materials will be retained at the site according to 
instructions provided by Vertex or its designee. The study monitor will review study drug 
records and inventory throughout the study.  
If a site uses a site -specific dru g accountability system and/or process, including processes 
associated with the destruction of returned materials, the process must be documented and 
approved by Vertex. The study monitor must review the drug accountability documentation on a 

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 26 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   regular basis . The study monitor will promptly communicate to Vertex any discrepancies he/she 
is unable to resolve with the site.  
10.5 Disposal, Return, or Retention of Unused Drug  
The study site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials returned by the subjects  until 
the study monitor has performed drug accountability. The investigator will ensure that the 
materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional 
policy, and any special instructions provided by Vertex. Destru ction will be adequately 
documented.  
10.6 Compliance  
To ensure treatment compliance, the investigator or designee will supervise all study drug dosing 
that occurs at the site. At each visit, site personnel will review that the subject is compliant with 
study d rug dosing and remind the subject of study drug dosing requirements. Compliance will 
also be assessed by ongoing study drug count.   
If a subject demonstrates continued noncompliance of study drug dosing despite educational 
efforts, the investigator should  consider discontinuing the subject from the study.  
10.7 Blinding and Unblinding  
This will be a double -blind study.  
10.7.1  Blinding  
All subjects, site personnel (including the investigator, the site monitor, and the study team), and 
the Vertex study team will be bli nded to the treatment codes with the exception of the following:  
 Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject 
in the event of a life -threatening medical emergency  
 Any site personnel for whom this informatio n is important to ensure the safety of the subject 
or the male subject’s partner and her fetus in the event of a pregnancy  
 Vertex Global Patient Safety (GPS) and Regulatory Affairs personnel to satisfy serious 
adverse event (SAE) processing and reporting r egulations  
 Vendor preparing the final (production) randomization list who is not part of the study team  
 Vertex IWRS Manager  
 Vertex Clinical Supply Chain  
 IDMC  
 Vendor performing the unblinded analysis of safety data for the IDMC  
 Bioanalytical contract resea rch organization (CRO) analyzing PK samples and Vertex 
Bioanalytical personnel who are not members of the SET but review raw data from the 
Bioanalytical CRO. The Vertex Bioanalytical SET member will continue to be blinded.  
 Vertex Modeling and Simulation pe rsonnel or vendor conducting the population PK and 
PK/PD analyses  

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 27 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated    Vertex medical monitor may, for matters relating to safety concerns, unblind individual 
subjects at any time   
 Vertex Q uality Assurance , for the purposes of any audit or event investigations  
Sweat Chloride and Spirometry Blinding :  
 During the conduct of the study, the Vertex study team will not have access to the spirometry 
results after the morning dose on the Day 1 Visit.  
 Sites, subjects, and their parents/caregivers/companions should not be informed of their 
study -related sweat chloride results during the Treatment Period regardless of whether the 
subject has prematurely discontinued treatment. Sites are blinded to sweat chloride results to 
ensure the study blind in maintained.  
 Subjects an d their parents/caregivers/companions should not be informed of their 
study -related spirometry results during the Treatment Period regardless of whether the 
subject has prematurely discontinued treatment.  
A limited Vertex team (non -study members) may be un blinded and have access to safety, PD, 
and efficacy data for the purpose of conducting ongoing data reviews for planning and enabling 
clinical development, regulatory, and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) decisions.  
10.7.2  Unblinding  
At the initiatio n of the study, study site personnel will be instructed on the method for breaking 
the blind. The unblinding method will be either manual or electronic.  
Unblinding of the individual subject’s treatment by the investigator will be limited to medical 
emergen cies or urgent clinical situations in which knowledge of the subject’s study treatment is 
necessary for clinical management. In such cases, investigators will use their best judgment as to 
whether to unblind without first attempting to contact the medical monitor to discuss unblinding. 
If investigators deem it unnecessary to unblind immediately, they will first attempt to contact the 
medical monitor to discuss unblinding. If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the 
medical monitor, they will use  their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the 
clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding.  
Contact information for the medical monitor (or appropriate backup) will be in a separate 
document.  
If a subject’s treatment assignment has be en unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent 
clinical situation, the medical monitor will be notified within 24  hours of the unblinding event. 
The reason and the date of the unblinding will be documented clearly in the subject’s study file. 
Information a bout the treatment assignment obtained from the unblinding will be maintained in a 
secure location with controlled access and will not be shared with Vertex, the CRO, or any site 
personnel (other than the physician treating the subject).  In addition, the i nvestigator will 
consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding will be considered an SAE, 
according to the regulatory definitions or criteria for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report to 
Vertex GPS or designee, per Section  13.1.2 . 
Vertex GPS or designee will also unblind any SAE reports in compliance with regulatory 
reporting requirements. In addition, Vertex may, for matters relating t o safety, unblind individual 
subjects at any time.

11.3 Pharmacodynamics: Sweat Chloride  
Collection of sweat samples will be performed using an approved  collection device.  
Each collection will occur before study drug dosing. At each time point, 2  samples will be 
collected, 1 from each arm (left and right). Additionally, sweat collections will be performed on 
any single day during screening.  
Sweat samples  will be sent to a central laboratory for testing and interpretation of results. Sweat 
chloride results for individual subjects will not be disclosed to the study sites.  
Specific instructions for collection, handling, processing, and shipping of sweat chlo ride samples 
to the central laboratory will be provided in a separate Laboratory Manual.  

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 29 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   See Section  10.7.1  for information about blinding of sweat  chloride results.  
11.4 Efficacy: Spirometry  
Spirometry will be performed according to the American Thoracic Society Guidelines/European 
Respiratory Society Guidelines.9 
Spirometry will be performed as outlined below:  
Pre-bronchodilator spirometry is defined as spirometry testing performed for subjects who have  
 withheld their short -acting bronchodilators (e.g.,  albuterol and ipratropium bromide 
[Atrovent®]) for more than 4  hours before the s pirometry assessment;  
 withheld their twice daily, long -acting bronchodilator (e.g.,  salmeterol) for more than 
12 hours before the spirometry assessment; and  
 withheld their once -daily, long -acting bronchodilator (e.g.,  tiotropium bromide [Spiriva®]) 
for mor e than 24  hours before the spirometry assessment.  
During the Screening Period, spirometry assessments may be performed pre - or 
post-bronchodilator. At all other visits, all spirometry assessments should be performed 
“pre-bronchodilator”. During the Treatme nt Period, spirometry assessments must be performed 
before the morning dose of study drug at approximately the same time at each visit.  
In the event that a subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator(s), spirometry should be performed 
according to the following:  
 If a subject’s Day  1 Visit spirometry assessment is pre -bronchodilator but, on a subsequent 
visit, the subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator use, a post -bronchodilator spirometry 
assessment will be obtained for that visit only, and the visi t will not be rescheduled.  
 If, on the Day  1 Visit, the subject forgets to withhold his/her dose of bronchodilator, 
spirometry should be performed post -bronchodilator, and all subsequent spirometric 
measurements (according to the schedule of assessments det ailed in Table  3-1) should be 
performed post -bronchodilator.  
 Each spirometry assessment will be recorded in the source documents as pre - or 
post-bronc hodilator.  
If more than 1 spirometry assessment is required at a visit, bronchodilators will be withheld until 
completion of the last scheduled spirometry assessment.  
All sites will be provided with spirometers to be used for all study assessments. Spirome try data 
will be transmitted to a centralized spirometry service for quality review. The investigator's 
assessment of the spirometry results will be used for the screening assessment and determination 
of eligibility.  
See Section  10.7.1  for information about blinding of spirometry results.  
11.5 Safety  
Safety evaluations will include AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, clinical evaluation of vital 
signs, ECGs, physical examinations (PEs), and pulse oximetry .

Additional Tests at Screening : The following additional tests will be performed during screening 
to asses s eligibility:  
 Serum beta -human chorionic gonadotropin (β -hCG) for all female subjects  

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 31 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated    Serum follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) for suspected postmenopausal female subjects 
only. Levels will be within the laboratories range for postmenopausal for subject s to be 
considered of non -childbearing potential.  
Pregnancy Testing (Female Subjects of Childbearing Potential):  
 Serum and urine β -hCG as described in Table  3-1. 
The pregnancy test at screening and Day  1 must be negative before receiving the first dose of 
study drug.  
If a urine pregnancy test is positive, the pregnancy will be confirmed with a serum β -hCG test. If 
pregnancy is confirmed, the procedures outlined in Section  11.5.5.2  will be followed.  
CFTR  Genotype:  CFTR  genotyping will be performed for all subjects (Sections  8.1 and 9.9). 
Additional Evaluations:  Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
For purposes of study conduct, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. 
Local laboratories may be used at the discr etion of the local investigator for management of 
urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically 
significant, it will be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator 
becomes a ware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the 
central laboratory (e.g.,  the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the investigator may base the 
assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value . 
11.5.3  Physical Examinations an d Vital Signs  
A PE of all body systems and vital signs assessment will be performed at screening and select 
study visits. At other visits, symptom -directed PEs and symptom -directed vital signs assessments 
can be performed at the discretion of the investiga tor or healthcare provider . 
A PE includes a review of the following systems: head, neck, and thyroid; eyes, ears, nose, and 
throat (EENT); respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and 
neurological. Breast, anorectal, and ge nital examinations will be performed when medically 
indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as 
AEs.  
The abbreviated PE will include an assessment of the following body systems: head, neck, and 
thyroi d; EENT; cardiovascular system; respiratory system; skin; and abdomen.  
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature, pulse rate, and 
respiration rate. The subject will be instructed to rest for at least 5  minutes before vital si gns are 
assessed.  
11.5.4  Electrocardiograms  
Standard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout. Additional standard 
12-lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The performance of all 
ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines:  
 The subject will be instructed to rest for at least 5  minutes before having an ECG.  
 The test should be performed in the supine position  

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 32 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by the investigator and maintained 
with source documentation. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study 
through the Safety Follow -up Visit will be recorded as AEs.   
See Section  8.2 for information about the ECG assessment for study eligibility.  
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to 
baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >60  msec from the baseline or an absolute 
QTcF value is ≥500  msec for any scheduled ECG, 2  additional ECGs will be performed 
approximately 2  to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF 
values from these repeated ECGs remains above the thres hold value (>60  msec from baseline or 
≥500  msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2  successive 
ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement. Further details 
pertaining to ECGs will be provid ed to sites in the ECG Manual.  
11.5.5  Contraception and Pregnancy  
11.5.5.1  Contraception  
Study participation requires compliance with the contraception guidelines outlined below.  
Contraception for the couple is waived for the following:  
 True abstinence for the subject, w hen this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,  calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. True abstinence must 
be practiced from the Screening Visit through 90  days after the last dose of study drug.  
 If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). If a male subject is assumed to have 
complete bilateral absence of the vas deferens, infertility must be documented before t he first 
dose of study drug (e.g., examination of a semen specimen or by demonstration of the 
absence of the vas deferens by ultrasound).  
 If the female is of non -childbearing potential. To be considered of non -childbearing potential, 
the female must meet a t least 1 of the following criteria:  
o Postmenopausal: Amenorrheic for at least 12  consecutive months and a serum FSH level 
within the laboratory’s reference range for postmenopausal females.  
o Documented hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy/salpingo -oophore ctomy.  
Note: All other females (including females with tubal ligations and females who do not have 
a documented bilateral oophorectomy) will be considered to be of childbearing potential.  
 Same sex relationships.  
For subjects for whom the contraception requ irement is not waived, study participation 
requires a commitment from the subject that at least 1 acceptable method  of contraception is 
used as a couple.  Acceptable methods of contraception are listed in Table 11-3.  

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 33 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Table 11-3 Acceptable Methods of Contraception  
Method  Male Subjects and 
Their Female 
(Non -study) Partners  Female Subjects and 
Their Male 
(Non -study) Partners  
Vasectomy 6 months or more previously, with a documented 
negative postvasectomy semen analysis for sperm  Yes Yes 
Documented tubal ligation 4 weeks or more previously  Yes Yes 
Male or female condom with or without spermicidea Yes Yes 
Female barrier contraception (such as diaphragm, cervical 
cap, or sponge) with spermicide  Yes Yes 
Continuous use of an intrauterine device for at least 90 days 
before the first dose of study drug.    
 Hormone -releasing  Yes Yes 
 Non-hormone releasing  Yes Yes 
Hormonal methods of contraception (oral or patch), if 
successfully used for at least 60  days before the first dose of 
study drug  Yes Yes 
Note: At least 1 acceptable method of contraception must be used by couples not exempt from the contraception 
requirement. Methods of contraception must be in successful use from signing of consent, approximately 28  days 
before the first dose of study drug  (unless otherwise noted), and until 90  days following the last dose of study drug. 
Additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to local regulations and/or requirements.  
a A female condom cannot be used with a male condom due to  risk of tearing.  
 
Additional notes:  
 Male and female subjects who are not sexually active at the time of screening must agree to 
follow the contraceptive requirements of this study if they become sexually active with a 
partner of the opposite sex.  
 Male subjects must not donate sperm from signing consent, throughout the study, and for 
90 days following the last dose of study drug.  
 Female subjects and female partners of male subjects should not plan to become pregnant 
from signing consent through 90  days f ollowing the last dose of study drug. For male 
subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential, the couple should not plan to 
become pregnant during the study or within 90 days after the last dose of study drug, with the 
exception of couples who p lan to become pregnant by  artificial insemination using sperm 
banked by the male subject before the first dose of study drug or sperm from another source.  
 Male subjects whose female partner becomes pregnant through well -documented in vitro 
fertilization (d onated sperm) or banked sperm (collected before the subject received study 
drug), or is otherwise already pregnant before the male subject’s first dose of study drug, 
must be compliant with the contraception requirements. In this scenario, the male subject  and 
his female partner must commit to using a male condom (to ensure there is no exposure of 
the fetus to study drug) from signing consent through 90 days after the last dose of study 
drug.  
 Female subjects should not nurse a child from signing consent through 90  days following the 
last dose of study drug.  

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 34 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated    Unique situations that may not fall within the above specifications may be discussed with the 
Vertex medical monitor or authorized designee  on an individual basis.  
11.5.5.2  Pregnancy  
Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during study 
treatment and for 90  days after the last dose of study drug.  
If a subject, or the female partner of a male subject, becomes pregnant while participating in the 
study, the study drug will be permanently discontinued immediately. The investigator will 
1) notify the medical monitor and Vertex GPS within 24  hours of the site’s knowledge of the 
subject’s (or partner’s) pregnancy, and 2) send the Pregnancy Information Collection Form to 
Vertex GPS.  
A subject (or their partner, if relevant) who becomes pregnant while on study will be followed 
until the end of the pregnancy only if on blinded treatment, or if they have been unblinded and 
have received active drug. The infant will be followed for 1  year after birth, provided informed 
consent is obtained. A separate ICF will be provided to explain these follow -up activities. 
Pregnancy itself is not an AE.  
12 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL PLANS  
This section presents a summary of the planned analyses of safety,  efficacy, and clinical 
pharmacology results. Statistical analysis details on safety and efficacy will be provided in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP), clinical pharmacologic analysis details will be provided in the 
clinical pharmacology analysis plan ( CPAP), and population PK -PD analysis details will be 
provided in the Modeling and Simulation Plan, all of which will be finalized before clinical 
database lock.  
Final analyses will take place after all subjects have completed the study, all data have been 
entered in the clinical study database, and the database has been locked.  
12.1 Sample Size and Power  
The primary objective is to evaluate efficacy of VX -561. The primary efficacy endpoint is the 
absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 12. Based on the initial study design that 
included 4 dose groups of VX -561 and an IVA 150 mg q12h dose group,  assuming a 
within -group SD of 7 percentage points and a 10% dropout rate at Week 12: a sample size of 
22 subjects in the 50, 150, and 250 mg qd VX -561 arms will p rovide a 95% CI of 
± 3.4 percentage points around the observed mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at 
Week 12, based on 2 -sided, 1 -sample t statistics; a sample size of 11 subjects in the other arms 
will provide a 95% CI of ± 5.4 percentage points  around the observed mean.   
Following discontinuation of the 25 mg qd VX -561 and 50 mg qd VX -561 treatment arms, the 
remaining subjects planned to enroll will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to the 3 current treatment 
arms with a sample size of approximately 28 subjects for the 250 mg qd VX -561 treatment arm, 
approximately 28 subjects for the 150 mg qd VX -561 treatment arm, and approximately 
14 subjects for the IVA 150 mg q12h treatment arm. The total  study sample size including 
discontinued arms and current arms is approximately maintained as planned (N = 88). Under the 
same assumption as the original design (within -group SD of 7 percentage points and 10% 
dropout rate at Week 12): a sample size of 28 subjects in the 250  mg qd VX -561 and 150 mg qd 

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 35 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   VX-561 arms will provide a 95% CI of ± 2.9 percentage points around the observed mean 
absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline at Week 12, based on 2 -sided, 1 -sample t  statistics; a 
sample size of 14 subjects i n the IVA 150 mg q12h arm will provide a 95% CI 
of ± 4.4 percentage points around the observed mean.  
12.2 Analysis Sets  
The study will include the following analysis sets:  
 The All Subjects Set  is defined as all subjects who were randomized or received at least 1 
dose of study drug. The All Subjects Set will be used for individual subject data listings and 
disposition summary tables, unless otherwise specified.  
 The Full Analysis Set (FAS)  will include all randomized subjects who carry the intended 
CFTR allele mut ation and have received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Treatment 
Period. The FAS will be used for all PD and efficacy analyses in which subjects will be 
analyzed according to their randomized treatment group, unless otherwise specified.  
 The Safety Se t will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. All safety 
and study drug exposure will be summarized for the Safety Set.  
 The PK Set  will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and for whom 
the primary PK da ta are considered sufficient and interpretable.  
12.3 Statistical Analysis  
This section summarizes the statistical analysis of safety and efficacy data. The Vertex 
Biometrics Department or designee will analyze the safety and efficacy data. Methodological 
and re lated details will be in the SAP.  
12.3.1  General Considerations  
The precision standards for reporting safety and efficacy variables are provided in an internal 
Biometrics document that specifies the programming rules, including the precision for derived 
variables . 
Continuous variables  will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: 
the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value 
(max).  
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages.  
Baseline value , unless specified otherwise, will be defined as the most recent non -missing 
measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug. For ECG, 
baseline will be defined as the most recent pretreatment measurement (or the average of triplicate 
measurements, if the most recent pretreatment measurement is obtained in triplicate) before the 
first dose of study drug. Further details on baseline definition will be provided in SAP.  
Absolute change from baseline  will be ca lculated as Post-baseline  value  − Baseline value . 
Relative change from baseline  will be calculated and expressed in percentage as 
100%  × (Post -baseline value  − Baseline value)/Baseline value . 
Treatment -emergent (TE) Period  will include the time period star ting from the date of the first 
dose of study drug to 28 days after the last dose date of study drug taken in the treatment period, 

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 36 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   or the completion date of study participation, wh ichever comes earlier. The TE Period will be 
used for safety analyses unles s specified otherwise.  
Visit windowing rules:  The analysis visit windows for protocol -defined visits will be in the 
SAP.  
12.3.2  Background Characteristics  
12.3.2.1  Subject Disposition  
The number of subjects in each category (including All Subjects Set, Randomized, FAS, Sa fety 
Set) will be summarized overall and by treatment group.  
The number and percent (based on the FAS) of subjec ts in each disposition category (including 
completed treatment, completed study, and discon tinued treatment or study with a breakdown of 
the re asons for discontinuation) will be summarized overall and by treatment group.  
A listing will be provided for subjects who di scontinued treatment or who discontinued study 
with reasons for discontinuation. A randomizat ion listing of subjects will be provide d. 
12.3.2.2  Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics, medical history, and baseline charact eristics will be summarized overall and by 
treatment group based on the FAS. No statisti cal tests will be done to evaluate baseline 
imbalances between groups.  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will incl ude, but are not limited to age (in years), sex, 
ethnicity, race, weight (kg), height  (cm), body mass index (BMI, in kg/m2), baseline ppFEV 1, 
and baseline sweat chloride.  
Medical history will be summarized by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred 
Term (PT).  
12.3.2.3  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications used will be coded using the World Health Organization -Drug Dictionary 
(WHO -DD) and categorized as the following:  
Prior medication:  any medication tha t started before the date of the first dose of study drug, 
regardless of when the medication ended.  
Concomitant medication:  medication continued or newly received on or after the date of the 
first dose of study drug through the end of the TE Period.  
Post-treatment medication: medication continued or newly received after the TE Period.  
A given medication may be classified as a prior, concomitant medication, or post -treatment 
medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post -treatment; or prio r, 
concomitant, and post -treatment. If a medication has a missi ng or partially missing start/end date 
or time and if it cannot be determined whether it  was taken before the first dose of study drug, 
concomitantly during the TE Period, or after the TE Perio d, it will be considered in all 
3 categories of prior, concomitant, and post -treatment medication.  
Prior medications and concomitant medications  will be summarized descriptively using 
frequency tables by Preferred Name based on the FAS. Post -treatment medi cations will be 
provided separately in an individual subject data listing.  
Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 37 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Details for imputing missing or partial start and/or stop dates of medication will be in the SAP.  
12.3.2.4  Study Drug Exposure and Compliance  
Study drug exposure will be summarized overall a nd by treatment, based on the Safety Set in 
terms of duration of treatment a subject received (in days), defined as: last dose date  – first dose 
date + 1 day, regardless of study drug interruption.  
Study drug compliance will be summarized overall and by treatment group based on the FAS, 
and will be calculated as: 100   [1 − (total number of days of study drug interruption)/(duration 
of study drug exposure in days)].  
In addition, percentage of tablets taken will also be summarized overall and by treatment group 
based on the FAS, and will be calculated as: 100   [(total number of tablets dispensed)  – (total 
number of tablets returned)]/(total number of tablets planned to be taken per day   duration of 
study drug exposure in days).  
12.3.3  Efficacy and Pharmacodynam ic Analyses  
All efficacy and PD analyses described in this section will be based on the FAS, unless specified 
otherwise.  
12.3.3.1  Efficacy: Spirometry  
The efficacy data from the discontinued arms (25 mg qd VX -561 and 50 mg qd VX -561) will not 
be included in the mod el and will be summarized descriptively.  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 12. The 
primary analysis (described below) is based on the within group mean of absolute change from 
baseline for 250 mg qd VX -561, 150 mg qd VX -561, and IVA 150 mg q12h treatment arms.  
The primary analysis will be based on a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
using restricted maximum likelihood. The model will include the absolute change from baseline 
in ppFEV 1 at Day 15, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12 from the current treatment arms (250 mg 
qd VX -561, 150 mg qd VX -561, and IVA 150 mg q12h) as the dependent variable; treatment 
group, visit, and treatment by visit as fixed effects; with continuous baseline ppFEV 1 as 
covaria tes; and an unstructured covariance structure for the within -subject errors. If the model 
estimation does not converge, a compound symmetry covariance structure will be used.  
The primary results obtained from the model will be the within -group treatment ef fect estimate at 
Week 12 for each treatment arm. The adjusted mean with a 2 -sided 95% CI will be presented in 
a table.  
In addition, the adjusted mean and 95% CI of the treatment effect difference between each 
VX-561 arm and the IVA arm obtained from the MM RM model will be provided.  
12.3.3.2  Pharmacodynamics: Sweat Chloride  
The secondary endpoint is the absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at Week  12 and 
will be analyzed similarly to ppFEV 1 for 250 mg qd VX -561, 150 mg qd VX -561, and IVA 
150 mg q12h trea tment arms. Adjusted means and 95% CIs of the average treatment effects at 
Week 12 will be obtained for within -group (for each arm) and between -group comparisons 
(between each VX -561 arm and the IVA arm). Details will be provided  in the SAP.  

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 38 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   12.3.4  Safety Analysis

 Clinical laboratory values (hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation studies, and urinalysis)  
 Standard 12 -lead ECGs  
 Vital signs  
 Pulse oximetry  
Safety endpoints will be analyzed based on the Safety Set (including the 25 mg qd VX -561 and 
50 mg qd VX -561 treatment arms that were discontinued). Only a descriptive analysis of safety 
will be performed.   
All safety data from the TE period wi ll be summarized by treatment group and overall. All safety 
data will be presented in individual subject data listings.  
12.3.4.1  Adverse Events  
AEs will be classified as pretreatment AEs, treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), or post-
treatment AEs  defined as follows:  
Pretreatment AE:  any AE that started before the first dose date of study drug.  
TEAE:  any AE that worsened (either in severity or seriousness) or that was newly developed on 
or after the first dose date of study drug through the end of the TE Peri od.  
Post-treatment AE : any AE that worsened or that was newly developed beyond the TE Period.  
For AEs with completely missing or partially missing start dates, if there is no clear evidence 
that the AEs started before or after study treatment, the AEs wil l be classified as TEAEs.  
Details for imputing missing or partial start dates of AEs are in the SAP.  
AE summary tables will be presented for TEAEs only, overall and by treatment group, and will 
include the following:  
 All TEAEs  
 TEAEs by strongest relationsh ip  
 TEAEs by maximum severity  
 TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation

(i.e., number and percentage of subjects with an event). W hen summarizing the number and 
percentage of subjects with an event, subjects with multiple occurrences of the same AE or a 
continuing AE will be counted once. Only the maximum severity level will be presented in the 
severity summaries, and the strongest r elationship level will be presented in the relationship 
summaries.  
In addition, a listing of individual subject AE data for TEAEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation, SAEs, and deaths will be provided separately. All AEs, including pretreatment 
AEs, will  be in an individual subject data listing.  
12.3.4.2  Clinical Laboratory Assessments

values of the continuous hematology and chemistry results, including coagulation results will  be 
summarized in SI units by treatment group and visit.  
The number and percentage of subjects meeting a threshold analysis criterion during the TE 
Period will be summarized overall and by treatment group. The threshold analysis criterion shift 
from basel ine will also be summarized for selected laboratory parameters. The threshold criteria 
will be provided in the SAP.  
Results of urinalysis and the urine/serum pregnancy test will be in individual subject data listings 
only.  
12.3.4.3  Electrocardiogram  
For treatment -emergent ECG measurements, a summary of raw values and change from baseline 
values will be provided overall and by treatment group at each scheduled visit for the following 
standard 12 -lead ECG measurements: RR (msec), HR (beats per minute [bpm]) , PR (msec), QRS 
duration (msec), QT (msec), and QT corrected for HR intervals (QTc [msec]).  
The number and percentage of subjects meeting a threshold analysis criterion during the TE 
Period will be summarized overall and by treatment group. The threshold  value criteria will be in 
the SAP.  
12.3.4.4  Vital Signs  
For treatment -emergent vital signs measurements, the raw values and change from baseline 
values will be summarized by overall and by treatment group at each scheduled visit: systolic 
and diastolic blood press ure (mm Hg), body temperature (°C), pulse rate (bpm), and respiratory 
rate (breaths per minute).  
The number and percentage of subjects meeting a threshold analysis criterion during the TE 
Period will be summarized overall and by treatment group. The thresh old value criteria will be in 
the SAP.  
12.3.4.5  Pulse Oximetry  
For the treatment -emergent pulse oximetry measurements, a summary of observed values and 
change from baseline values will be provided overall and by treatment group for each part, at 
each scheduled visi t for the percent of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry.

12.3.6.1  Interim Analysis  
Not applicable  
12.3.6.2  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  Analysis  
The IDMC will conduct safety reviews of study data. IDMC analyses will be conducted as 
outlined in the IDMC Charter. The planned IDMC reviews (with reference to number of subjects 
and duration of study) will be specified in the IDMC charter.  
IDM C review will include relevant unblinded safety data. The IDMC may recommend stopping 
the study at any time. The IDMC may also recommend stopping individual dose groups, if there 
are increased safety findings in those groups.  
12.4 Clinical Pharmacology Analysi s 
12.4.1  Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
The PK of VX -561 and IVA will be described using summary statistics. Preliminary review and 
analyses of the drug concentrations may be done before database lock under the conditions of 
masked identifications of the subject concen trations.  
Details of the analyses will be in the CPAP.  
12.4.2  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
A sequential approach will be used to perform the population PK/PD analyses for VX -561. The 
Bayesian estimates of individual PK parameters from the final popula tion PK model will be used 
to simulate PK profiles for each subject. The simulated VX -561 plasma concentrations will be 
used in the response models to describe changes in sweat chloride and ppFEV 1 from baseline. 
Fixed - and random -effect parameter estimates  and the associated asymptotic standard error will 
be estimated. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize Bayesian estimates of individual 
PK/PD parameters obtained from the population PK/PD model.  
Details of the analyses will be described in the Modeling and Simulation Plan.  

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 41 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND ADM INISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting  
13.1.1  Adverse Events  
13.1.1.1  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any un toward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a pre -existing condition (e.g.,  increase in its severity or 
frequ ency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section  13.1.2.1 .  
13.1.1.2  Clinically Significant Assessments  
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to have clinically significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the 
abnormal test result alone (e.g.,  urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, 
the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin).  
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more of 
the following:  
 Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment  
 Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
 A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study  
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the 
study assessment res ults are clinically significant will be made by the investigator.  
A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4  laboratory value 
will be an SAE if the subject’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  
13.1.1.3  Documentation  of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the following times:  
 For subjects who do not enroll: until time of screen failure (e.g.,  screen failure, withdrawal of 
consent)  
 For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follo w-up Visit: through the Safety Follow -up Visit  
 For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow -up Visit, the earliest of  
o 35 days after the last dose of study drug, or  
o the ETT Visit, if that visit is 3  weeks or later following the last dose of study d rug 
(see Section  9.1.5 ) 

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 42 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the CRF and 
source document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled will be 
recorded only in the subject’s source documents. The following data will be documented for 
each AE:  
 Description of the event  
 Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  
 Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  
 Severity  
 Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
 Action taken  
 Outcome  
 Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
13.1.1.4  Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the fol lowing website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  5.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/prot ocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
July 2018 ). AEs of CTCAE Grades  4 and 5 will be documented as “life -threatening.” The 
severity of an AE described by a term that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined 
according to the defi nitions in Table  13-1. 
Table  13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities  
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening (Grade  4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death  
 
13.1.1.5  Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories in Table  13-2. 

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 43 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Table  13-2 Classifications for AE Causality  
Classification  Definition  
Related  There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational 
study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational 
study drug and cau ses other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study  drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such 
as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative et iology will be documented in the subject’s medical record).  
 
13.1.1.6  Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-3.  
Table  13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no oppo rtunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
 
13.1.1.7  Adverse Event Outcome  
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-4. 
Table  13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/resolved with 
sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not recovered/not 
resolved (continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at leas t possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow up)  

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 44 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Table  13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE  
Classification  Definition  
 
13.1.1.8  Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given 
in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical 
therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.  
13.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
13.1.2.1  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
 Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participat ion in the study or occurs after 
participation and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study 
drug)  
 Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred  
 Inpatient hospital ization or prolongation of hospitalization  
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
 Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Important medical event  that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent  1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g.,  an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at ho me)  
If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g.,  surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned 
before the subject signed the ICF, the hospitalization or proce dure will not be considered to 
indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled sooner 
or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly not 
associated with an AE (e.g.,  social hos pitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE.  
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as 
“serious”, which is based on subject/event outcome or  action described above, and is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not 
severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.   

Protocol VX18 -561-101, Version  2.0 Page 45 of 52 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   13.1.2.2  Reporting and Documentation of Seri ous Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the 
Safety Follow -up Visit, regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to Vertex 
GPS within 24 hours of identification . In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety 
Follow -up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS 
within 24  hours of identification .  
For SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable)  through the 
Safety Follow -up Visit, the SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to 
report follow -up information on previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report 
follow -up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health 
authorities.  
Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via:  
Email:  (preferred choice)  
Fax:   
For technical issues related  to submitting the form, contact telephone:  
SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow -up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s)  will 
be recorded on the Vertex Clinical Trial Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred 
to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the 
event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relationship to the investigational study 
drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to s tudy drug(s) will be assessed 
only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity 
assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved 
at the end of the study re porting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of 
regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and 
report the outcome to Vertex using the SAE Form.  
13.1.2.3  Expedited Reporting and Investigator Safety Letters  
Vertex, as study sponsor, is responsible for reporting suspected, unexpected, serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs) involving the study drug(s) to all regulatory authorities, IECs, and 
participating investigators in accordance with ICH Guidelines and/ or local regulatory 
requirements, as applicable. In addition, Vertex, or authorized designee, will be responsible for 
the submission of safety letters to central IECs.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee to promptly notify the local I RB/ IEC of all 
unexpected serious adverse drug reactions involving risk to human subjects.

Clinical Study Protocol Addendum for Cystic Fibrosis, Addendum Version  2.0 Page 2 of 7 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Summary of Changes to Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Study Protocols  
Vertex is currently evaluating several CFTR modulators in  clinical studies for the treatment of 
cystic fibrosis (CF), a serious and life -threatening disease. In completed studies, treatment with 
these CFTR modulators has generally resulted in rapid, robust, clinically meaningful, and 
statistically significant im provements in clinical measures, and are generally safe and well 
tolerated. A dverse events (AEs) seen with these treatments are mostly consistent with common 
manifestations of CF disease or with common illnesses in CF subjects.  
During this COVID -19 pandem ic, the safety of the subjects, investigators, and site personnel 
participating in these clinical studies is Vertex’s first priority, thus it is important to minimize 
any unnecessary risk to COVID -19 exposure through travel to study sites. This addendum 
summarizes the measures taken for ongoing CF clinical studies. These operational adjustments 
were implemented to align with Health Authority guidance ensuring the protection of subjects, 
investigators, and site personnel while maintaining compliance with GCP  and minimizing impact 
to the integrity of the studies. Overall, the benefit -risk of these studies remains favorable.  
Vertex recommends that subjects and sites refer to local guidance regarding travel restrictions. 
There are no operational changes to the s tudy protocols for subjects who can travel to the study 
sites for their visits. However, to ensure continued safety of subjects who cannot  travel to the 
study sites for their visits (for any reason due to COVID -19), specific alternative measures are 
being implemented to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID -19 (see table below). As the 
COVID -19 pandemic evolves, Vertex will continue to assess the need for additional actions to 
ensure the safety of all involved in these clinical studies.  
Addendum Version 2. 0 summarizes additional measures taken for these ongoing CF clinical 
studies (see table below) to ensure continued safety . In addition,  administrative changes were 
made to provide clarifications  (e.g.,  changed Addendum  1 to Addendum Version  1.0) and to  
provide examples of qualified personnel (e.g.,  personnel from site or qualified health care 
agency) who may conduct s afety assessments, as indicated per protocol, during in -home visits.

Assessments  
 
Weight and height /length /stature  may be assessed by subjects or their 
caregivers using medical grade scales and stadiometers, as indicated per 
protocol and per local regulation. Sit es and subjects will receive training and 
guidance as needed on these devices.  
 
Subjects or caregivers will provide these measurements to site personnel by 
telephone or video call. Investigators will review results and contact subjects 
for follow -up as needed. All data will continue to be retained in the subject’s 
source files.  To allow for collection of key data to assess safety and/or 
efficacy while maintaining study integrity and the safety 
of subjects and site personnel.  
 
Addendum  1 allowed for these  assessments to be 
performed by qualified personnel conducting the in -home 
visits. Addendum  2 allows for these assessments to be 
performed by subjects or caregivers.

Addendum Version  1.0, dated 24  April  2020  
Consenting of Subjects  
ICFs may be provided electronically or by post mail to subjects (and/or caregivers, as 
indicated per protocol). The subjects and/or caregivers will review the ICF with an 
appropriately qualified member of the investigator’s team via telephone contact or vi deo call. 
After this review, subjects and/or caregivers will consent (or assent, if applicable), and/or 
reconsent verbally and by signing and dating the ICF and returning it to the site via post mail. 
The signed and dated ICF will then be signed and dated by the investigator.  
 
Subjects participating in select studies may have the opportunity to enroll in longterm 
extension studies. Informed consent (or assent, if applicable), and/or reconsent for subjects 
(and/or caregivers, as indicated per protocol) may be obtained per the same process described 
above, as applicable.  To provide alternative methods of 
obtaining reconsent or consent, as 
applicable, while ensuring subject 
safety.  
VX18 -561-101 Study Drug Shipping  
Study drug may be shipped directly from the site to the subject, as applicable, and if permitted 
by local regulations; subject protected health information will not be released to Vertex.  
 
Reconciliation, return, and destruction of study drug will continu e to occur at the clinical site 
as indicated per protocol and in adherence to local regulations.  To ensure subjects can continue 
treatment with study drug without 
interruption while ensuring their safety.  
 
To clarify that despite these alternative 
measures , reconciliation, return, and 
destruction of study drug will remain as 
indicated per protocol.  
In-home Visits and/or Telephone Contact  
Study visits may be conducted as in -home visits by qualified personnel as requested by 
participating sites on a per -subject basis. In addition, all subjects may be contacted by site 
personnel by telephone or video call, irrespective of in -home visits.  To provide subjects the opportunity to 
continue participation in the clinical 
studies while ensuring their safety by 
minimizing the risk to COVID -19 
exposure through travel.

Safety Assessments and Reporting  
Safety assessments, as indicated per protocol, may be performed by qualified personnel 
conducting the in -home visits  (e.g.,  personnel from site or qualified health care agency) . These 
assessments may include the following, as indicated per protocol, and per local regulation:  
• vital signs  
• pulse oximetry  
• height/length/stature  
• weight  
• physical examination  
(complete or abbre viated)  
• pregnancy test  
(serum or urine)  • urinalysis  
• blood draws for safety test panels 
(chemistry, LFT panel, lipid panel, 
hematology, coagulation).  
Blood and/or urine samples for safety assessments are analyzed as indicated per protocol for 
subjects who  have in -home visits.  
Blood and/or urine samples for safety assessments may be collected and analyzed at local 
laboratories for subjects who do not have in -home visits, but do not complete the assessment 
at the site.  
In addition, safety assessents will be evaluated by telephone. These assessments may include 
the review of the following:  
• AEs 
• signs and symptoms/systems for CF  
• medications  
• planned or unplanned hospitalizations for CF  
• study drug administration  
• outcomes related to PEx  
• outcomes related to antibi otic treatment  
Investigators will review results (in -home and telephone) and contact subjects for follow -up as 
needed.  
All data will continue to be retained in the subject’s source files.  
Any clinically significant finding (e.g., AE, SAE, laboratory abnorm alities) will continue to be 
reported as indicated per protocol.  To assess the safety and tolerability of 
the CFTR modulator evaluated in the 
specific clinical study while ensuring 
subject safety. These safety 
assessments will continue to provide 
safety data while minimizing burden to 
subjects and site personnel.  
 
To clarify that despite these alternative 
measures, all adverse events and 
serious adverse events should be 
reported as indicated per protocol.

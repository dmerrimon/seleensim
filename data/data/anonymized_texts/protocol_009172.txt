  1 Protocol Synopsis  
PREcision Event Monitoring of PatienTs with Heart Failure using HeartLogicTM     
(PREEMPT -HF) 
Study 
Objective(s) The goal of the PREEMPT -HF study is to collect device and clinical 
event data to evaluate extended applications of the HeartLogicTM Heart 
Failure Diagnostic (HeartLogic)  in a broad spectrum of heart failure (HF) 
patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)  or cardiac 
resynchronization therapy defibrillator ( CRT -D). There are no  primary 
safety and/or efficacy endpoints for this study.  
 
Subjects will be followed for approximately 12 months  after the baseline  
visit to collect the required number of  clinical events to  support the study 
objectives . These events are called Reviewable Clinical Events (RCEs), 
and include all -cause hospitalization s and HF outpatient visits.  
 
Clinical event definitions are  as follows:   
• Hospitalization (all- cause) : the subject  is admitted to inpatient 
hospital care and discharged on a different calendar date.  
• HF Hospitalization : the subject  is admitted with 
signs/symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) and receives 
unscheduled augmented HF therapy with oral or intravenous 
medications, ultrafiltration therapy or other parenteral therapy.  
• HF R eadmission (30- day) : the subject is admitted for an 
unplanned hospitalization for any cause with in 30 days post 
discharge from  a HF hospitalization.  
• HF O utpatient V isit: the subject has signs/symptoms of CHF , 
and receives unscheduled intravenous decongestive therapy 
(e.g., IV diuretics, IV inotropes, IV vasoactive drugs, 
ultrafiltration) in a setting that does not involve a hospitalization 
(e.g., emer gency room, HF clinic, primary care clinic , etc. ). 
 
Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the PREEMPT -HF study is to investigate the 
association between HF sensor data and 30- day HF readmissions.   
 
Additional Objectives  
1. Characterize HF sensor  data  for: 
o Association with risk for device VT/VF  therapy  
o Phenomapping of HF events  
o Association with non -HF hospitalizations including

  Method of 
Assigning 
Patients to 
Treatment  There is no randomization as all subjects are assigned to a single group 
and are followed with HeartLogic disabled. The investigator will have 
access to an electronic database which will be used to generate the patient 
ID and all eCRF s for subjects enrolled in the clinical study . 
Follow -up 
Schedule  The required protocol study visits and medical record  reviews are as 
follows: 
• Enrollment  visit  
• Baseline visit  
• Interim medical record review (6 month, does not require a 
clinic visit)  
• Final clinic visit (12 month , or at the point of withdrawal ) 
 
Subjects will exit the study following their f inal clinic  visit.  
Study Duration  The study duration is estimated to be 6 years from first patient enrollment 
to study closure.  
Participant 
Duration  The study duration for each subject is expected to be approximately 12 
months from enrollment to the final clinic visit. A patient can be in the 
study for up to 460 days (15 months) i f the maximum visit windows are 
taken in to account .

  Statistical Methods   
Primary 
Statistical 
Hypothesis  There is no statistical hypothesis.  The primary objective of the 
PREEMPT- HF study is to investigate association between HF  sensor data 
and 30- day HF readmissions.  
Statistical Test 
Method  The following statistical analyses will be used to evaluate the objectives 
of the study:  
 
Primary  Objective   
The difference in sensor trends pre- admission and post -discharge will be 
compared between subjects with and without a 30-day HF readmission. 
The comparison will be evaluated using a two -sample  t-test for each HF  
sensor measurement.  
 
Additional  Objective s 
1. Association with risk for  device VT/VF : will be evaluated using 
an odds ratio. 
2. Phenomapping of  HF events:  will be evaluated using cluster 
analysis . 
3. Association with non- HF hospitalizations including cardiac non-
HF events and non- cardiac events: will be evaluated using a 
paired t -test for each HF S ensor.  
Sample Size 
Parameters  Up to 3750  enrolled subjects  are necessary to  evaluate the primary 
objective. An index HF hospitalization refers to the first HF 
hospitalization during the study follow -up period. A HF hospitalization is 
deemed usable if sensor data is available during the event and sufficient 
follow up time is recorded to determine if a readmission occurs.  
 
A total of 215 usable index HF hospitalizations are required to have at 
least 80% po wer to detect a standardized difference of 0.5 in the mean 
sensor change (admission – discharge) between the groups with and 
without a 30 -day HF readmission . It is expected that of the 215 -usable  
index (first during the study) HF hospitalizations, 43 will be followed by 
a 30- day readmission (20%).  
 
Based on the following assumptions, a total of 215 usable index HF 
hospitalizations are required:  
• 80% Power to detect a standardized mean difference of 0.5 
between groups  
• Two-sided Type I error (alpha) of 0.05 
• 3:1 ratio of group sizes (no- readmission: 30-day HF readmission), 
where the no -readmission group will exclude index HF

  hospitalizations with 31 to 60-day readmissions  
 
Assuming a 20% loss of usable HF events due to proximity to study start 
and exit (completion or withdrawal ), a total of 270 index HF 
hospitalizations are required to obtain 215 usable HF hospitalizations.  
 
Based on the following assumptions, up to 3750 subject enrollments are 
required to obtain the 270 required HF hospitalizations:  
• 9 % index H F hospitalization rate  
• 20% death/withdrawal over  entire length of the study  
• Average of 12 months of sensor data per patient

  3 Introduction 
3.1 Study  Rationale  and B ackground 
Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome with high morbidity, mortality, and 
economic burden1, 2. Chronic HF is persistent, gradually progressive, and punctuated by 
episodes of acute worsening lead ing to hospitalizations3. Therefore,  there remains an unmet 
clinical need to slow the progression of HF and prevent hospitalizati ons. HeartLogicTM, 
available in Boston Scientific cardiac resynchronization therapy devices and defibrillators 
(CRT -Ds and ICDs), combines novel sensor parameters such as heart sounds and respiration 
with other measurements like thoracic impedance, heart r ate, and activity into a HeartLogic 
Index for the early detection of worsening HF4, 5. However, there is limited data on the 
association of  HeartLogic with the risk of HF readmission s and tachyarrhythmia s, or for 
phenotyping the  broad spectrum of HF patients .   
Thus, t he goal of  the PREEMPT- HF study is to collect data aimed at extending Hear tLogic 
applications. Specific study objectives are listed below.  
(1) Associate HF sensor data with  HF 30- day readmission : Hospitalizations due to 
worsening HF are associated with high post -acute re -hospitalization and mortality, 
which in turn has led payers t o impose financial penalties targeted at reducing 
readmissions while improving care quality6. Recent data from fee- for-service 
Medicare beneficiaries indicate that these incentives have reduced readmission rate; 
but, the magnitude of readmission reduction has been modest (from 23.5% in 2008 to 
21.4% in 2014), the rate of decline has slowed, and the mortality has not improved7. 
Readmission risk stratification algorithms developed to date have utilized clinical  and 
patient data8, 9. The ability to further reduce readmissions will require new 
approaches. For example, implantable  device diagnostics have been used to risk 
stratify HF patients for  readmissions10, and pulmonary artery pressure guided H F 
management has been associated with a 59% reduction in 30- day HF readmissions11. 
The PREEMPT- HF study will evaluate the novel HF sensor  parameters for 
readmission detection and patient risk stratification.  In order to evaluate the 
incremental  benefit of sensor data  for readmissions, only patients with HeartLogic 
disabled  will be included in the study. 
(2) Characterize HF sensor data for association with risk of tachy arrhythmias and 
device therapy: Acute HF exacerbations are presumed to trigger atrial and ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias through a number of mechanisms including increased cardiac filling 
pressure and neurohormonal activation12-15; however patient risk assessment  for 
malignant arrhythmias  is subjective and device sensor based algorithms for risk 
stratification  using traditional  device sensors have had only modest accuracy16-19. 
Similarly, a  new onset or worsening of atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmia may 
itself be a trigger for worsening of HF. The PREEMPT- HF study will investigate the 
association between the  HeartLogic Index and patient  risk for  device ventricular 
tachycardia/fibrillatio n (VT/VF)  therapy.

(3) Characterize HF sensor data for  phenomapping of HF events:  Clinical practitioners 
have recognized that HF is comprised of multiple heterogeneous entities  including 
HF with reduced, preserved, and mid- range ejection fraction (HFrEF, HFpE F, and 
HFmEF )20. Similarly, acute worsening HF has been classified by hemodynamic 
profiles incorporating congestion (wet/dry) and perfusion (warm/cold). However, 
physiological measurements underlyi ng clinical classifications exhibit significant 
variation. For example, even though the majority (>80%) of patients admitted for 
worsening HF show clinical signs or  sympto ms of volume overload, there is a wide  
distribution of body fluid and its composition21. Data driven approaches such as 
cluster analysis has been applied to phenotype HFrEF22 and HFpEF23, but continuous 
data collected by implanted devices have not been utilized. The PREEMPT -HF study 
will collect data to investigate machine learning and clustering approaches for event 
classification using HF sensor  data and baseline clinical variables. This type of 
unbiased dense phenotype mapping is known as phenomapping.  
(4) Characterize association of HF sensor data with  non- HF hospitalizations : Due to 
aging and the convergence of cardiac disease and other comorbid conditions, 
approximately 3 out of 4 hospitalizations in HF patients are classified as unrelated to 
HF by event adjudication committees24, 25. Therefore, strategies to reduce 
hospitalizations should consider both cardiac and non- cardiac conditions.  Preliminary 
data from the MultiSENSE  showed that non- cardiac hospitalizations were associated 
with sensor changes including impedance, heart rate, heart rate variability and the 
first heart sound; however additional data are needed in more specific event 
subgroups26. The interrelationship of HF with other disease states is underscored by 
the observation that pulmonary artery pressure driven HF management is associated 
with a reduction in hospitalizations related to respiratory disease27. Data from the 
PREEMPT- HF study will be used to further investigate the relation between diverse 
HF Sensor  measurements and non -HF related events.  
(5) Collect data on patient  sleep incline leading up to and following clinical events : 
Because orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea are hallmarks of worsening 
HF, devices with  HeartLogic are equipped with a Sleep Incline Sensor  to measure the 
subject’s night- time elevation ang le. A cross- sectional analysis of data from the 
MultiSENSE study (N=46 patients in 65 visits) showed that orthopnea symptoms 
were associated with increased sleep incline angle (mean±SEM  of 23.2±2.8 degrees 
vs. 10.7±1.7 degrees)28. The PREEMPT- HF study will extend this analysis to a 
longitudinal assessment of sensor measurements in the vicinity of hospitalization 
events.  
(6) Investigate feasibility of linking study data to administrative claims : The capability to 
cost-effectively develop and test future device diagnostics may be dependent on the 
ability to link broad data sets, and validate knowledge obtained from multiple sources 
using data driven approaches, while ensuring the protection of patient privacy and 
data confidentiality29, 30. The utilization of claims data linked to remote monitoring

  data offer a glimpse into how device features can be evaluated without expensive 
clinical trials31-33. The PREEMPT- HF study aims to assess the feasibility of linking 
claims data with comprehensive device and other study data in applicable 
geographies. For example, in the United States the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS) has instituted an Innovator Research Program to allow 
access to claims data for research34.  
4 Commercial Device Description   
4.1 Device Description  
The PREEMPT- HF study will use Impl anted Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) or Cardiac 
Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillator (CRT -D) device models that are commercially 
approved and contain the HeartLogic HF diagnostic  feature (Figure 1).  For a full description 
of the HeartLogic feature, please refer to the labeling.  
 
The implanted portion of the study system includes the  CRT -D or ICD pulse generator (PG) , 
along with its associated commercially available leads.  For the PREEMPT- HF study, BSC 
CRT -D and ICDs can be associated with leads from any manufacturer.  The models being 
used are shown in Table 4-1, but future device models with the HeartLogic feature may also 
be included as they become commercially available. In addition, a Programmer Recorder 
Monitor (PRM) with appropriate software must be used to interrogate the device ( Model 
2868 Application Software, v4.04 or other compatible version).

4.2 Medical Equipment Description  
The external portion of the system includes the commercially available LATITUDE NXT 5.0 
patient management system (or future versions ) and the PRM . LATITUDE is a remote 
monitoring system  (Figure 2)  that gather s data from the PG and external sensors (blood 
pressure monitor and weight  scale ) and transmits it to a web server.  LATITUDE enables 
physicians to remotely monitor both device and patient status.  The LATITUDE 
communicat or uses wireless telemetry to transfer data from  the implanted  device  and external 
sensors to the web server , which can be accessed by  the study doctor  and Boston Scientific .

  The primary means of device data collection for the PREEMPT- HF study is through the 
LATITUDE patient management system. Therefore,  LATITUDE enrollment is required for 
subject participation in the study, and data transmission via LATITUDE (i.e., referred to  as 
“monitored on LATITUDE” ) must be confirmed at the baseline visit . During the course of 
the study if the subject is away from the communicator, sensor data storage to PG memory 
will continue; however, the next data upload will not occur until the subjec t is within range 
of the communicator. To  ensure timely data transmission, LATITUDE must be programmed 
for scheduled follow -ups to occur every 3 months  or sooner . At the final study visit, the 
investigational site must interrogate the subject’s device using the PRM. This will trigger a 
remote data upload to LATITUDE when the subject returns within range of the 
communicator. 
 
For the PREEMPT- HF study, H eart Failure S ensors must be turned O N. This must be done 
via the PRM. The Heart Failure Sensor s consists of heart sounds (S3 and S3/S1), respiration 
(respiratory rate and rapid shallow breathing index), impedance, heart rate and activity.  
 
Only subjects with Heart Failure Sensor s turned On, Respiratory Sensor turned ON, and 
HeartLogic disabled are eligibl e to participate in the study.  The state where HeartLogic is not  
enabled on LATITUDE is referred to as HeartLogic disabled. In this state, the device will 
continue to collect sensor data, but the HeartLogic Index and Heart Sounds sensor trends will 
not be displayed on the LATITUDE system, and clinicians will not receive HeartLogic alerts. 
Sensor data will be stored in the PG for 365 days after which the earliest data are overwritten. 
The subject must be withdrawn from the study if Heart Failure Sensor s will be turned OFF, 
or if HeartLogic will be enabled . Subjects may remain in the study if the Respiratory Sensor 
or Sleep Incline Sensor are turned OFF ; however, this will be considered as a protocol 
deviation. The Sleep Incline Sensor  measures the subject’s a verage elevation angle over the 
programmed sleep schedule. Sleep schedule can be programmed using the PRM.  
 
Following device implant, the Sleep Incline Sensor requires a minimum of seven ( 7) days for 
initialization, after which sensor calibration must be performed. Initialization may take 
longer if subject  lacks diversity in his/her body orientations during this period. Calibration 
can be performed using a single -position method with the subject in upright posture, or a 
two-position method using both upright and supine postures. A two- position calibration is 
recommended when possible. During calibration, the s ubject must be  fully vertical or 
horizontal when the PRM captures the upright and supine postures respectively.  
 
The i mpedance and sleep incline trends will be visible on LATITUDE even when 
HeartLogic is disabled. Therefore,  information about the subject’s participation in a remote 
monitoring program using these sensors will be  collected at the end of the study and will be 
used for analysis.  
 
Boston Scientific has performed safety risk management activities, design verificat ion and 
design validation test ing to demonstrate that devices with HeartLogic function safely and 
effectively per the design intent.  The products conform to user needs and intended use, all 
system -level requirements have been tested with no uncorrected fai lures, and the risk is

5 Study Objectives  and Endpoints  
The PREEMPT- HF study is  designed to collect device and clinical event data to evaluate 
extended applications of HeartLogic  in a broad sample  of HF  subjects  with an impla ntable 
ICD or CRT -D.  
5.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the PREEMPT -HF study i s to investigate the association between 
HF Sensor  data and 30 -day HF readmissions.   
 
Subjects will be followed for approximately 12 months  to collect the required number of 
clinical events to support the study objectives.  These events are called Reviewable Clinical 
Events (RCEs), and include all -cause hospitalizations and HF outpatient visits  (as defined 
below) .  
 
RCEs require the investigational site to review the subject’s medical records and complete 
the appropriate eCRF ( Figure 3).  
 
Clinical events for the purposes of data analysis are defined as follows:   
• Hospitalization (all- cause) : the s ubject is admitted to inpatient hospital care and 
discharged on a d ifferent calendar date. 
• HF Hospitalization : the subject is admitted with signs/symptoms of congestive 
heart failure (CHF) and receives unscheduled augmented HF therapy with oral or 
intravenous medications, ultrafiltration therapy or other parenteral therap y.  
• HF R eadmission (30- day): the subject is admitted for an unplanned hospitalization 
for any cause with in 30 days post discharge from a HF hospitalization.  
• HF O utpatient V isit: the subject has signs/symptoms of congestive HF , and 
receives unscheduled intravenous decongestive therapy (e.g., IV diuretics, IV 
inotropes, IV vasoactive drugs, ultrafiltration), in a setting that does not involve a 
hospitalization (e.g.:  emergency room, HF clinic, primary care clinic , etc.).

  5.2 Additional Objectives  
Additional objective s of the PREEMPT- HF study are intended to:  
 
1. Characterize HF Sensor  data  for: 
o Association with risk for device VT/VF  therapy  
o Phenomapping of HF events  
o Association with non- HF hospitalizations including cardiac non- HF events 
and non- cardiac events  
2. Collect subject  Sleep Incline S ensor data prior to and following reviewable clinical 
events  
3. Link  study data to third-party  data, such as Center for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services (CMS) administrative claims (US  only).  Association of reviewable clinical 
study events with other sources  will be investigated. Any study data linkage will 
abide by all applicable laws , regulations , and data use agreements, and patients will 
be consented accordingly. 
5.3 Study Endpoints  
PREEMPT- HF is a non- mandated post -market study. Data will be collected in subjects 
treated per usual standard of care procedures. However, the device needs to be  programmed 
with Heart Failure Sensor s ON and HeartLogic disabled. There are no pre -defined endpoints , 
and there are no special clinical evaluations or tests that are not a part of standard of care.  
6 Study Design  
PREEMPT- HF study is a global, multi -center, prospective, non -randomized study. The study 
objective is to evaluate extended applications of HF sensor  measurements in relation to RCEs 
(i.e., all -cause hospitalizations and HF outpatient visits ). Device data will be collected  using 
the LATITUDE remote monitoring system . However, it is critical to report  RCEs  via the 
eCRFs as defined in the study protocol .  
Prior to enrollment, patients who meet the eligibility criteria (Sections 7.2 and 7.3) and agree 
to participate in the study will be asked to sign a Subject  Informed Consent document 
approved by an Institutional Review Board /Ethics Committee , or Competent Authority (as 
applicable per local regulations) . The f ollow -up schedule  for subjects is shown in Table 6- 1, 
and the overall study flow is shown in Figure 4.

All subjects  will be  evaluated at the baseline visit and will be followed until the final in -clinic 
visit (approximately 12 months) . Study visits should be scheduled , if possible, to coincide 
with standard of care visits . At the baseline visit the subject should be provided with a study 
ID card containing contact numbers for site research staff.  The subject should be informed to 
contact site research staff if hospitalized or treated with IV HF therapy , including event s that 
occur  at a non -study hospital or physician’s office.

  An interim medical record review is required at 6 months to capture study clinical events (see 
section 6 ). No subject visit is required . Accurate and comprehensive capture of RCEs is 
critical for the  success of the study. When possible, this medical record review should 
coincide with an in- clinic standard of care visit so that  the investigator can ask the subject 
about any RCEs that may have occurred since the last visit.   
During the final clinic visit (12 months or at the point of withdrawal), a device interrogation 
using the PRM must be performed. This ensures that  the device data will be uploaded  the 
next time the subject is in contact with their LATITUDE system at home.  Once the site has 
confirmed device data transfer  via LATITUDE , the end of study e CRF must be completed . 
There  will be no further data collection for that subject.  Individual subjects are then exited 
from the study , and the Heart Failure Sensor s and  feature can be programmed per clini cian 
discretion . 
6.1 Scale and Duration  
Up to 3750 subjects will be enrolled in United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia Pacific. 
Sites may continue to enroll subjects until notified of enrollment completion. The maximum 
enrollment ceiling per site is  375 subje cts. Enrollments are expected to occur over a period of 
approximately 60 months. Subjects enrolled in the study will be followed for approximately 
12 months. A patient can be in the study for up to 460 days (15 months) if the maximum visit 
windows are take n in to account. The study will be conducted at up to 200  sites globally  and 
the study is expected to be completed in approximately 6 years.  
6.2 Treatment Assignment  
There is no treatment assignment in this study.  
6.3 Treatment and Control  
This is an observational study with no treatment or control groups. All enrolled subjects will 
already be implanted with a commercially available Boston Scientific CRT -D or ICD device.  
For the specific model numbers see Table 4- 1. Devices will have Heart Failure Sensor s 
turned ON, Respiratory Sensor turned ON, Sleep Incline Sensor turned ON , and HeartLogic 
disabled.  
6.4 Justification for the Study Design  
The results of the MultiSENSE study4 were based upon 400 subjects followed for 12 months 
(test cohort).  While this provided sufficient sample size to evaluate HeartLogic performance 
to predict the initial (index) HF event,  it was not sufficient for analyzing HF readmissions.  
Thus, a much larger sample size is needed to obtain sufficient numbers of subjects with HF 
readmissions.  To evaluate HeartLogic for HF readmissions, subjects cannot be treated by 
using the feature, and clinicians must be blinded to HeartLogic Index and alerts. Therefore,  
this study will only enroll subjects who have HeartLogic disabled. D ata from this study will 
be used to evaluate the association of HF sensor  measurements with 30 -day HF readmissions.

  8.2 Withdrawal  
All subjects enrolled in the clinical study (including those withdrawn from the clinical study 
or lost to follow -up) shall be accounted for and documented. If a subject withdraws from the 
clinical study , an “End of S tudy”  eCRF must be completed , with the subject status as 
“withdrawn” .  
Subjects will be classified as “withdraw n” if at least one of the following conditions are met:   
• subject lost to follow -up (Section  8.3)  
• subject classification  of ineligible or attempt ( Section 8.4)   
• clinician  recommendation 
• subject choice  
• device explant , device revision, or lead revision  
All applicable eCRF s up to the point of withdrawal (including the Final Clinic Visit if 
possible) and  the “End of Study” eCRF  must be completed .  
After a subject has been withdrawn from the study , additional study data will no longer be 
collected  after  the point of withdrawal. All open adverse events should be closed or 
documented as chronic. Data collected up to the point of subject withdrawal may be used for 
analysis.  
8.3 Lost to Follow -Up 
A subject will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to re turn for  the final clinic 
visit and is unable to be contacted by the study site staff. 
The following actions need to be taken if a subject  fails to return to the clinic  for the final 
clinic visit:  
• The site will attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit and 
ascertain if the subject wishes to continue in the study. 
• Before a subject is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make 
every effort to regain contact with the subject (3 documented attempts with a 
minimum of one certified letter sent to the subject ). These contact attempts should be 
documented in the subject’s medical record or study file.  
• Should the s ubject continue to be unreachable, he or she must be withdrawn from the 
study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up. 
8.4 Subject Status and Classification

  9.3 Study Candidate Screening  
Subjects will be recruited from the investigator’s pool of patients that have  an ICD or CRT -D 
implant with the  HeartLogic  feature . The investigator has the responsibility of screening 
potential subjects and selecting only those who meet the eligibility criteria. For the purpose 
of this clinical study no screening logs  are required , and the site is not required to report 
screen failures.   
9.4 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention  
Study recruitment  will rely upon the general pool of patients that meet the eligibility criteria 
and have  an ICD or CRT -D implant .  
9.5   Informed Consent   
Eligible s ubjects can be consented for the study any time after the calendar day of the ICD or 
CRT -D implant. Participants who meet all  the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria , and sign and date the informed consent form are cons idered enrolled in the study. No 
procedures or data will be collected prior to signing the informed consent form. Legal 
Authorized Representatives (LAR) must not be used for this study.  
9.5.1 Data Linkage  
The PREEMPT- HF study will also  link study data to third -party  data  sources. The purpose of  
data linkage is to conduct  research to improve  clinical applications  such as  patient 
management and therapy  (both device and non- device), algorithms for patient risk 
stratification and prognos tic evalu ation, health economic evaluation, and clinical trial  
methodologies . Data linkage wi ll focus on disease states and comorbidities common in 
device patients such as heart failure, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, acute coronary 
syndrome, heart valve disorders, respirat ory disease, renal disease, gastrointestinal  disease, 
sleep apnea, infectious disease, etc.  
PREEMPT- HF study data will  be used in combination with internal BSC databases (e.g., 
device tracking database) to obtain, use, and disclose certain protected health  information to 
third -parties.  This may include device serial and model number, implant date,  the hospital 
where the implant procedure was performed , subject last name, date of birth, address zip 
code, and the last four digits of the subject’s  social secu rity number.   
The third -party data sources include  but are not limited to payer administrative claims  and 
health analytics ( e.g., Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Truven, Optum ), 
provider electronic health records (EHRs), pharmacy benefit manage ment  (or other third -
party  administration  of prescription drug programs), clinical registries (used for post market 
surveillance or quality improvement ), biobanks , and government databases ( such as census 
data, or social security death index ).

  The s ubject may withdraw permission for the use and sharing of  personal health information 
at any time  if provided in writing to the study doctor.  Please notify Boston Scientific of any 
subjects that submit in writing their request to withdraw their permission  for the use of 
personal health information.   
Boston Scientific will abide by all applicable laws, regulations, and data use agreements 
associated with data linkage  to third -party data sources. This research could not practicably 
be conducted without acce ss to and use of the protected health information. Additionally, 
Boston Scientific will employ reasonable  administrative,  physical and technical safeguards 
that are designed to protect against data loss, misuse of data , unauthorized access or 
disclosure of data, and alteration or destruction  of data . This includes implementation of  
adequate plans to use only minimum identifiable data needed in a finder file to enable  
linkage , and the removal and destruction of the finder file  after  each  linkage is comple te at 
the earliest opportunity consistent with conduct of research.   
9.6 Enrollment Visit  
Enrollment cannot occur on the same calendar day  of the implant procedure, but m ay occur 
before the patient is discharged  from the hospital where the implant occurred.  
At the enrollment visit the following activities are required:  
• Confirmation of subject consent  
• Confirmation that the subject  meets all the inclusion and none of the e xclusion 
criteria  (Sections 7.2 and 7.3)  
9.7 Baseline Visit  [Day 0 ] 
The baseline visit must be conducted no sooner than seven ( 7) days post -device implant to 
allow for automatic initialization of the Sleep Incline Sensor . Enrollment and baseline visit s 
can be completed on the same day  provided the device has been implanted for at least seven 
(7) days with the Sleep Incline Sensor turned O N. However, the baseline visit must be 
conducted no later than 30 days following enrollment.  
The following information must be gathered and entered into the e CRFs in a timely manner.  
• Subject device information 
o Manufacturer, model and serial number of pulse generator and  active leads  
o Implant date  for all active devices  
o Anatomical locations of pulse generator and leads  
• LATITUDE monitoring  
o Confirm that the subject is monitored in LATITUDE  
o Review in LATITUDE at the patient level that HeartLogic is disabled  
o Confirm scheduled remote  patient monitoring follow -ups are programmed to 
occur at a frequency no less often than once  every three ( 3) months.

  • Sleep Incline Sensor  calibration and data collection : 
*Important:  The device will NOT collect any Sleep Incline data until a body 
calibration has been performed. Calibration is a required step to ensure the PG is 
collecting sleep incline data.* 
o Sleep Incline Sensor  calibrations are performed by the  clinician using the 
PRM . Calibration should be performed using the two- position method for 
increased accuracy.  This requires the patient to sit and to lie down, so the 
calibration must be conducted in a room with adequate facilities.  Care must be 
taken to ensure that the subject is fully vertical or horizontal when the PRM 
captures the upright and supine postures. Once the patient is in position, the 
clinician will run the software on the PRM  for the data collection.  It takes 
approximately 10 seconds of da ta collection for each position.  The entire 
procedure should take about 1- 2 minutes. For patients unable to perform the 
two-position  calibration, a sin gle position may be performed.  
o Regardless of whether the Sleep Incline Sensor  has been calibrated pr ior to the 
PREEMPT- HF Study baseline visit, please re- calibrate. Document the 
calibration in the patient medical record .  
o If the Sleep Incline Sensor is turned ON, but the Sensor initialization is 
incomplete seven ( 7) days after implant, then calibration canno t be performed. 
Please document in the eCRF if initialization failure resulted in the inability to 
calibrate the sensor. If initialization failure occurs, calibration may be 
performed at a subsequent standard of care office visit.  
o Record the details of the sleep incline calibration in  the patient medical record 
as source documentation.

  In addition, subjects located in the United States (US) who own a smart phone may be 
provided with the option to use a geo -location tracking app to  ensure timely reporting of 
hospitalizations. The  app contains the location of all hospitals in the US.  If a subject exceeds 
the pre -specified and programmable amount of time at a hospital, the app will prompt the 
patient to confirm a hospitalization.  In addition, the investigational site will get a noti fication 
that the patient may be hospitalized.  To protect patient privacy, Boston Scientific will not 
receive these notifications.   
9.8 Interim Medical Record Review  [150-210 days ] 
The interim medical record review must be conducted 150 to 210 days following t he baseline 
visit.  It is encouraged to perform the interim medic al record review at the time of an in- clinic  
standard of care visit.  If this review coincides with an in -clinic visit, the subject must be 
asked whether he or she had any reviewable clinical events (RCEs) since the baseline visit. 
As defined in section 5.1 , an RCE is defined as either an all -cause hospitalization, or HF 
outpatient visit. If the subject reports having an RCE at a center not participating in the study, 
every effort  should be made to obtain medical records from the center. An overview of the 
activities and data to be collected is provided below.  
• Review  subject medical records since  the date of the baseline visit and assess for 
RCEs  and reportable AEs   
• If RCEs  are identified during the medical record review (see Figure 3 for details ), 
complete the “ Reviewable Clinical Event”  eCRF .  
o Each newly identified RCE  must have a unique eCRF. For example , if the 
subject had two HF outpatient vi sits for an on- going AE it must be 
captured in two separate “Reviewable Clinical Event” eCRF s. 
o If a single RCE is associated with multiple AEs, only the primary AE (i.e., 
the chief complaint leading to the  clinic/hospital visit) should be 
associated with an  “Reviewable Clinical Event” eCRF . For example, if a 
subject was admitted due to symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding but 
developed worsening HF during the course of hospitalization , the 
gastrointestinal bleeding would be the primary AE, and therefore i t would 
be associated with the “Reviewable Clinical Event” eCRF . A separate 
“Reviewable Clinical Event” eCRF  is not required for the in -patient 
worsening of HF  even if  it is reported as  a separate AE.  
• For hospitalizations, the Principal Investigator must r eview the patient’s medical 
records and classify the primary organ cause in the “Reviewable Clinical Event” 
eCRF  (see Appendix for details ). Appropriate classification is important for event 
subgroup analysis. Classification also triggers the request for medical record 
documentation to be sent to BSC.  
• Supplementary diagnostics data collection: This eCRF sub- folder is created only 
if the invest igational site confirms that the subject is routinely monitored using 
pulmonary artery (PA) pressure data from an implanted commercially -approved 
device, or using serial natriuretic peptides (BNP or NT -proBNP). If the site

entered in the corresponding eCRF:  
o PA pressure readings  
o Serial natriuretic peptide  values  
o Volume status of the subject (hypervolemic, hypovolemic, euvolemic )  
o Treatments initiated  in response to the diagnostic data  
 
**The sponsor retains the right to restrict the total amount of supplemental  data that 
would be collected during the course of the study.  In this event, sites would be 
notified to stop reporting supplemental data, and the data base eCRF may be locked 
for further data entry.**  
9.9 Final Clinic Visit  [ 350-430 days ] 
The final visit must be performed in -clinic  350 to 430 days following the baseline visit. If 
the patient is withdrawn prior to the window for the final clinic visit, please complete the 
final clinic visit at the point of withdrawal.  An overview of the data to be collected at this 
visit is provided below. 
• Review subject medical records since the date of the baseline visit and assess for 
RCEs and reportable adverse events.   
o Collect and report using the same process used in the interim medical record 
review  (See section  9.8).   
• Physical assessment (See Appendix)  
• Blood labs: Ent er the most recent blood lab values since the baseline visit for the 
following.  
o Natriuretic peptides (BNP or NT -proBNP) and date of collection. If serial 
natriuretic peptide data has already been entered in the supplementary 
diagnostics form, the same val ues need not be entered in the final visit eCRF.  
o Creatinine and date of collection  
• Supplementary diagnostics data collection:   
o Collect using the same process as in the interim medical record review  (See 
section 9.8) . 
• Interrogate the device with a PRM . This ensures that the device data will be uploaded 
when the patient returns to within range of the communicator.  
• Confirm that a LATITUDE transmission occu rred in the previous 90 days. If 
transmission has not occurred instruct patient to do a patient initiated interrogation 
when they are in range of  their communicator.  
• Remote monitoring usage:    
o Provide information about the frequency and use of remote monit oring to 
manage the patient’s HF  condition over the past 12 months (e.g. sleep incline, 
weight, blood pressure, arrhythmia burden).

  9.10  Study Completion  
An “End of Study” eCRF must be completed when the subject’s participation concludes for 
one of the  following reasons :  
• The subject completes the final in -clinic visit after 350 days (minimum final clinic 
visit window) . At this point, the subject will exit the study, and device settings can be 
configured per clinician discretion. The subject status will  be “ completed study.”  
• The subject withdraws from the study. At this point, the subject will exit the study, 
and device settings can be configured per clinician discretion, and the subject status 
will be “withdrawn”.   All applicable eCRFs ( including the F inal Clinic Visit if 
possible) and the “End of Study” eCRF must be completed with information up to the 
point of withdrawal . Complete a review of the medical records for RCEs to the point 
of withdrawal, and interrogate the PG (See section 9.9 for visit details). PG 
interrogation ensures that the device data will be uploaded  when the patient returns to 
within range of the communicator . 
• The study is terminated by Boston Scientific.  At this point, the subject will exit the 
study, and device settings can be configured per clinician discretion. The subject 
status will be “withdrawn.”

  10 Statistical Considerations  
10.1 Primary Endpoint  
There are no primary endpoints or formal hypotheses, as the purpose of this study is 
exploratory. The primary objective is to investigate the association between HF Sensor  data 
and 30- day HF readmissions.  
10.1.1 Hypotheses  
There are no formal hypotheses. The purpose of this study is exploratory.  
10.1.2 Sample Size  
Approximately 3750 enrollments will be required for this study. The sample size was 
determined based on the estimated number of HF index hospitalizations and 30- day HF 
readmissions needed to evaluate the primary objective. Final sample size will be de termined 
by an interim analysis  as described in Section  10.9. An index HF hospitalization refers to the 
first HF hospi talization during the study follow -up period. A HF hospitalization is deemed 
usable if sensor data is available during the event and sufficient follow up time is recorded to 
determine if a readmission occurs.  
A total of 215 usable index HF hospitalizations  are required to have at least 80% power to 
detect a standardized difference of 0.5 in the mean sensor change (admission – discharge) 
between the groups with and without a 30-day HF readmission. It is expected that of the 215 
index HF hospitalizations, 43 will be followed by a 30- day readmission (20%).  
A total of 215 usable index HF hospitalizations was determined based on the following 
assumptions:  
• 80% Power to detect a standardized mean difference of 0.5 between groups  
• Two-sided type I error (alpha) of 0.05  
• 3:1 ratio of group sizes (no- readmission :  30-day HF readmission), where the no-
readmission group will exclude index HF hospitalizations with 31 to 60- day 
readmissions 
Assuming a 20% loss of usable HF events due to proximity to study start and exit 
(completion or withdrawal), a total of 270 index HF hospitalizations are required to obtain 
215 usable HF hospitalizations.  
Approximately 3750 enrollments are required to obtain the 270 required index HF 
hospitalizations. This was determined based on the following assumptions:  
• 9 % index HF hospitalization rate  per patient year  
• 20% death/withdrawal rate  throughout duration of study 
• Average of 12 months of sensor data per subject

  10.1.3 Statistical Methods  
The primary objective will be evaluated using a n independen t two sample t -test. A 
comparison of mean sensor value change (admission – discharge) will be made between the 
no-readmission group and the 30- day readmission group. All subjects with a usable index HF 
hospitalization and all subjects with a 30- day HF read mission will be included in the primary 
analysis. Subjects with a 31- 60-day HF hospitalization will be excluded from the analysis. A 
two-sided alpha of 0.05 will be used.  
10.2 Secondary Endpoints  
There are no secondary endpoints.  
10.3 Other Objective s/Measurements  
The additional objectives  are described below along with planned statistical methods and 
analysis data  to be used.  
• Characterize HF sensor s for the association with risk for VT/VF therapy  
o This will be assessed using an odds ratio  
o All subjects with usable sensor and episode data will be included in the 
analysis  
• Characterize HF sensor s for phenomapping of HF events  
o This will be assessed using cluster analysis  
o All subjects with a HF event and usable sensor data will be included in the 
analysis  
• Characterize  HF sensor s for association with non- HF hospitalizations (including 
cardiac non -HF events and non- cardiac events)  
o This will be assessed using a paired t -test 
o All subjects with a non -HF hospitalizations  and usable sensor data will be 
included in the analysis  
• Collect Sleep Incline Sensor  data  leading up to clinical events : Subjects who were 
enrolled in a remote monitoring program using sleep incline data will be excluded 
and sensor data in the remaining patients will be analyzed  using a paired t -test. 
• Link  study data to third -party  data  sources. D ata linkage will be included in the 
analysis to  assess feasibility to link to claims data (see Section 9.5)  and other data 
sources. The  linked data set will be used to compare claims- based events with study 
RCEs , assess the accuracy of claims- based algorithms to identify sensor detected 
events, an d estimate the cost savings from avoidable hospitalizations.  Comparisons 
will be made using paired and un- paired t -tests and receiver operator curve (ROC) 
analyses.

readmission will be included in the primary analysis. Subjects with a 30- 60-day HF  
hospitalization will be excluded from the analysis.  
10.5.2 Additional analyses  
• All subjects with usable sensor and episode data will be included in the analysis of 
characterizing  HF sensor s for the association with risk for device VT/VF therapy  
• All subjects with a HF event and usable sensor data will be included in the analysis of 
characterizing  HF sensor s for phenomapping of HF events  
• All subjects with a non -HF hospitalization and usable  sensor data will be included in 
the analysis of character izing  HF sensor s for association with non- HF 
hospitalizations  
10.6 Control of Systematic Error/Bias  
The purpose of this study is exploratory and to characterize the association of HF sensor  data 
with various clinical events. N o formal tests of hypothesis are p lanned, no claims of safety or 
efficacy are intended, and no adjustment for multiple testing will be performed.  
10.7 Number of Subjects per Investigational  Site 
A single site cannot enroll more than 375 patients.  
10.8 Other Endpoints/Measurements  
There are no endpoints or other measurements captured in this study.  
10.9 Interim Analyses  
An interim analysis is planned after 1000 subjects have been enrolled and have c ompleted all 
required follow -up visits . The purpose of the interim analysis is to verify enrolling rates and 
HF hospitalization rate  and withdrawal rate .

  system compliant with laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of clinical studies 
perta ining to the use of electronic records and signatures. Database backups are performed 
regularly.  
The Investigator provides his/her electronic signature on the appropriate electronic eCRF s in 
compliance with local regulations. A written signature on printou ts of the eCRFs must also 
be provided if required by local regulation. Changes to data previously submitted to the 
sponsor require a new electronic signature by the Investigator acknowledging and approving 
the changes.  
Visual and/or electronic data review will be performed to identify possible data 
discrepancies. Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in the EDC system and will 
be issued to the site for appropriate response. Site staff will be responsible for resolving all 
queries in the database.  
11.2 Data Retention  
The Principal Investigator or his/her designee or Investigational site will maintain, at the 
investigational  site, all essential study documents and source documentation that support the 
data collected on the study subjects in compliance wit h ICH/GCP guidelines. Documents 
must be retained for at least 2 years after the study has been completed . These documents 
will be retained for a longer period of time by agreement with BSC or in compliance with 
other country/regional/ local regulations  
The Principal Investigator or his/her designee will take measures to ensure that these 
essential documents are not accidentally damaged or destroyed. If for any reason the 
Principal Investigator or his/her designee withdraws responsibility for maintaining thes e 
essential documents, custody must be transferred to an individual who will assume 
responsibility and BSC must receive written notification of this custodial change. Sites are 
required to inform Boston Scientific in writing where paper or electronic files  are maintained 
in case files are stored off site and are not readily available.  
12 Deviations  
An Investigator must not make any changes or deviate from this protocol , except to protect 
the life and physical well -being of a subject in an emergency. An investi gator shall notify the 
sponsor and the reviewing IRB/ REB/ EC of any deviation from the investigational plan to 
protect the life or physical well -being of a subject in an emergency, and those deviations 
which affect the scientific integrity of the clinical investigation. Such notice shall be given as 
soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days after the emergency occurred, or per 
prevailing local requirements, if sooner than 5 working days.  
All deviations from the investigational plan, with the reason  for the deviation and the date of 
occurrence, must be documented and reported to the sponsor  using the electronic database 
CRF.   Sites may also be required to report deviations to the IRB /REB/EC, per local 
guidelines and government regulations.

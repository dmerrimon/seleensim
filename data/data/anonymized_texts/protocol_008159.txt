INCAGN01876 , Dosage , and Mode of Administration:    
Phase  1 and Phase  2:  INCAGN01876 will be administered IV over a 30 -minute period on Day 1 of 
each Q2W (ie, 14 days) cycle.  During Phase 2, f ixed doses of INCAGN01876 ( comparable to or less 
than the MTD/PAD determined during dose es calation), may also be explored.  INCAGN01876  will be 
the first drug administered, followed by a 30 -minute wait before starting infusion with the next agent.   
Subjects will continue to receive INCAGN01876 as long as they are deriving benefit and have not met 
any of the Protocol -defined conditions for  treatment withdrawal , or for up to 24 months from the first 
dose of study treatment, whichever occurs first.  
Reference Therap ies, Dosage , and Mode of Administration:  
Dosage and Mode of Administration for Nivolumab:   
In the doublet Treatment Groups A, B, F, and H, nivolumab will be administered IV per the  package 
insert or  institutional guidelines  at a dose of 240 mg Q2W  (eg, 14 days).   
In the triplet Treatment Groups D, E, J, and L, nivolumab will be administered IV per the  package 
insert or  institution al guidelines  at a dose of 3 mg/kg Q2W (eg, 14 days).   
In the concurrent dosing Treatment Groups A, D, F, and J, nivolumab dosing will begin on Cycle 1 
Day 1. 
In the sequenced dosing Treatment Groups B, E, H, and L , nivolumab dosing will begin on Cycle 3  
Day 1. 
Nivolumab will be administered at least 30 minutes after the infusion of INCAGN01876 (when 
applicable).  Subjects will continue to receive nivolumab  as long as they are deriving benefit and have 
not met any of the Protocol -defined conditions for tr eatment withdrawal , or for up to 24 months from 
the first dose of study treatment, whichever occurs first.  
Dosage and Mode of Administration for Ipilimumab:  
Ipilimumab will be administered IV per the  package insert or  institutional guidelines  to subjects i n 
Treatment Groups C, C2 (Phase 2 expansion), D, E, J, and  L, at a dose of 1 mg /kg Q6W (eg, 42 days).  
In the concurrent dosing Treatment Groups C, C2, D, and J, ipilimumab dosing will begin on Cycle 1 
Day 1.  In the sequenced dosing Treatment Groups E and  L, ipilimumab  dosing will begin on Cycle 3  
Day 1 . 
Ipilimumab will be administered at least 30 minutes after the infusion of INCAGN01876  (when 
administered on the same day) .  Ipilimumab will always be administered after INCAGN0 1876 and 
nivolumab.   Subjects  will continue to receive ipilimumab  as long as they are deriving benefit and have 
not met any of the Protocol -defined conditions for treatment withdrawal , or for up to 24 months from 
the first dose of study treatment, whichever occurs first.  
At the sponso r's discretion, once the MTD or PAD of INCAGN01876 has been established with 
ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg Q6W  (eg, 42 days), a higher dose of ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg Q6W  (eg, 42 days) 
and/or 3 mg/kg Q3W  (eg, 21 days) for 4 doses may be tested.

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  Study Schedule/Pro cedures:    
Subjects will have regularly scheduled study visits at the clinical site on Day 1 of each cycle.  
Additional study visits may be required during some cycles to monitor for safety, efficacy
.  Study visits are as follows:  
Screening:   Up to 28 days before enrollment.  Screening will begin at the time that the subject signs 
the informed consent and will continue until the date that the subject is enrolled in the study (Cycle 1 
Day 1). 
Cycle 1 and Cycle 6:  Day 1 and Day 8 (± 1 day).  
All other treatment cycles:   Day 1 (± 3 days).  
Efficacy assessments:  Every 8 weeks (± 7 days).  After 12 months, efficacy assessments will occur 
every 12 weeks (± 7 days) until disease progression is determined.  
End of treat ment:   ± 3 days of withdrawal from study.  
Safety follow -up:  30 days (+ 7 days) and 60 days (+ 7 days) after the last dose of study treatment.  
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, these safety follow -up visits will include AE and concomitant 
medication asse ssment only and may be completed remotely (such as by televisit).  
Disease follow -up:  Subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression will 
continue to be assessed every 8 weeks (± 7 days) for their disease status during the fo llow-up period 
and should continue to have tumor assessments until a new cancer therapy is started, disease 
progression, death, the end of the study, or the subject withdraws consent.  
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, no further disease follow -up assessme nts will be required beyond 
the last safety follow -up visit . 
Survival follow -up:  Once a subject has confirmed disease progression or starts a new anticancer 
therapy, the subject moves into the survival follow -up period and should be contacted every 12 wee ks 
from the last dose of treatment for survival follow -up.  This follow -up may occur through a phone call, 
email, or visit by the subject or the subject's caregiver.  
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, no further survival follow -up assessments will be requi red 
beyond the last safety follow -up visit . 
Estimated Duration of Participation:   Subjects may continue on treatment as long as they are 
receiving benefit and do not meet withdrawal criteria , or for up to 24 months from the first dose of 
treatment, whichever occurs first .  All subjects will be followed for survival.   Study participation, 
including post -treatment follow -up is expected to average approximately 12  to 18 months per 
individual subject.  
Estimated Number of Subjects:  
• Phase 1 Dose Escalatio n – Approximately 90 to 270  evaluable subjects.  
Note:   The minimum number of subjects assumes that the starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg; however, fewer  
subjects would be enrolled if a higher starting dose is used based on available safety data from the 
monothera py study INCAGN 1876 -101. 
Note:   The maximum number of subjects assumes that DLTs are observed in all dose cohorts to a 
maximum of 9 subjects per cohort across all treatment grou ps. 
• Phase 2 Stage 1  – Approximately 264 evaluable subjects . 
•  
• Phase 2 Stage 2  – Approximately 455 evaluable subjects . 
• Phase 2 Expansion Stage (PD -1 refractory SCCHN cohort only) – Approximately 20 evaluable 
subjects  
Note:   Assumes that all treatment groups and all tumor types pro ceed to Stage 2 and expansion s tage 
(for PD -1 refractory SCCHN cohort only).

Statistical Methods:    
In Phase 2, a Simon 2 -stage design will be run for the cervical cance r, gastric cancer, SCCHN and 
PD-1/PD -L1 relapsed melanoma cohorts within  a given doublet or triplet treatment group .  The 
planned Simon 2 -stage designs are summarized in Table  S5, assuming a 1 -sided Type I error of 0.05 
and power of 85% .  Each Simon 2 -stage design will have a stopping rule to allow early termination of 
a particular tum or type withi n the given drug combination at the end of Stage 1 if there is insufficient 
response observed (calculated response rate < p0), while enrolling enough subjects to predict possible 
target responses (≥ p1) worthy of cohort expansion and potentially further  evaluation in future studies.

r1:  If r1 or fewer responses are observed during Stage 1, the study cohort is stopped early for futility.  
n1:  Number of subjects initially enrolled in the Stage 1.  
n2:  Number of subjects enrolled in the Stage 2.  
r:  If r or fewer responses are observed by the end of Stage 2, then no further investigation of the drug combination is 
warranted in the selected tumor type.  
n:  T otal number of subjects.  
p0:  Insufficient response rate.  
p1:  Target response rate.  
For the PD -1 refractory SCCHN cohort in doublet Treatment Group F, a Simon 2 -stage design with an 
expansion stage, summarized in Table  S6, will be used.  With this 3 -stage design,  the 1 -sided Type I 
error is 0.0231 , and the power is approximately 88%.  The PD -1 refractory SCCHN cohort will be 
terminated early for futility at the end of Stage 1 or Stage 2 if there is insufficient response observed.  
At the end of the expansion stage , if there is sufficient response observed , the doublet schedule for the 
PD-1 refractory SCCHN cohort will be declared promising for further investigation; otherwise it is 
considered nonpromising.

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  Integrated Futility Analysis:  
For the cervical cancer, gastric cancer and SCCHN cohorts, when  each subject enrolls in Phase  2, an 
integrated analysis of tumor and dosing  strategies  (including concurrent dosing and INCAGN01876 
run-in Q2W  for 2 doses followed by INCAGN01876 Q2W  in combination with the combining drug [s]) 
will be conducted based on Simon et al ( 2016 ).  Tumor types within a dosing strategy  will jointly be 
analyzed using a Bayesian model before allowing sharing of information across tumor types.  Similar 
sharing wil l be applied separately for dosing strategies  across tumor types.  The purpose of the 
integrated Bayesian analysis is to determine if INCAGN01876 is active within any of the given dosing  
strategies, given tumor types, or given dosing  strategy -tumor type co mbinations.  Enrollment in a 
dosing strategy -tumor type  combination will be terminated if the probability of success is not above  
20% for both analysis approaches.  Collection of response data will be based on investigator 
assessments entered into an interactive response technology  system and analyzed separately from the 
clinical database.  Additional information regarding the futility analysis is detailed in the full P rotocol.  
The proposed designs for each tumor type and treatment combination will be used for any planned 
Simon 2 -stage design in the treatment combination (including concurrent and sequential dosing).  Each 
Simon 2 -stage design is set up to have a 1 -sided Type I error of 0.05 and power of 85%.  The response 
rates for each tumor type within a d rug combination will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals.   
Formal safety reviews, to be held at least every 6 months, will be conducted to review efficacy  and 
safety  data.

4.1. Overall Study Design  
This is an open -label, nonrandomized, Phase 1/2 study to determine the safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of INCAGN01876 when given in combination with immune therapies.  Phase 1 will 
consist of a 3  + 3 + 3 dose escalation  to determine the MTD, or PAD, defined as a dose that 
provides a maximal biochemical effect or an increase in biomarkers of immune activity of 
INCAGN01876 when given in combination with immune therapies.  Subjects with advanced or 
metastatic cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, gastric cancer (including stomach, esophageal , 
and GEJ), HCC, melanoma, Merkel ce ll carcinoma, mesothelioma, MSI -H CRC, NSCLC , 
ovarian cancer, SCCHN, SCLC, RCC, TNBC, and urothelial carcinoma who have progressed 
after treatment with available therapies that are known to confer clinical benefit, or who are 
intolerant to treatment, or who refuse standard of care will be enrol led in Phase 1.  The Phase 2 
expansion will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the recommended dose(s) 
of INCAGN01876 selected in Phase 1 when given in combination with immune therapies.  
Subjects with advanced or metastatic cervica l cancer, gastric cancer (including stomach, 
esophageal, and GEJ), SCCHN, PD-1 refractory SCCHN, and PD -1 or PD -L1 relapsed 
melanoma will be enrolled in Phase 2.  
The sponsor may elect to prioritize (or deprioritize) enrollment to specific treatment groups or 
cohorts based on emerging safety or efficacy data in collaboration with investigational sites.  
Additionally, a lternate dose administration schedules and/or fixed doses  of INCAGN01876 
(comparable to or less than the highest dose levels determined to be safe or pharmacologically

4.1.1.  Phase 1 – Dose Escalation  
A minimum of 3 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in each treatment group beginning with 
INCAGN01876 Dose Cohort 1 (0.1 mg/kg; starting dose).  A higher starting dose of 
INCAGN01876 may be used if safety data are available from the monotherapy study 
(INCAGN  1876 -101) but will not exceed 1 dose level below the highest tolerated dose of 
INCAGN01876 monotherapy.  If a h igher starting dose is used, the dose will be communicated 
to investigational sites with an administrative letter.  
The first 3 evaluable subjects enrolled within an INCAGN01876 dose cohort will be observed 
for the specified DLT observation period before th e next dose cohort begins enrollment.  If 
0 DLTs occur in a cohort of 3 evaluable subjects, a new cohort of 3 evaluable subjects will be 
treated at the next higher dose level.  If 1 of 3 evaluable subjects experience a DLT, that cohort 
will be expanded to 6 evaluable subjects.  If 1 of 6 evaluable subjects experiences a DLT, a new 
cohort of 3 evaluable subjects will be treated at the next higher dose level.  If 2 of 6 evaluable 
subjects experience a DLT, that cohort will be expanded to 9  evaluable subjects.   If ≥ 2 of 3, 3 of 
6, or 3 of 9 evaluable subjects experience DLTs within a cohort, then that dose level will be 
determined to have exceeded the MTD, and the previous dose level will be considered the MTD.  
If only 3  evaluable subjects were treated at the  MTD or PAD, then a minimum of 3 additional 
evaluable subjects will be enrolled before this dose is administered in Phase 2 of the study.

In all cases , investigators may  employ any measures or concomitant medications, after 
discussion with the medical monitor (whenever possible),  necessary to op timally treat the 
subject.  
5.4.4.  Follow -Up of Dose -Limiting Toxicities  
Any DLT should be followed until it resolves to baseline or appears to have stabilized for a 
minimum of 4 weeks  (eg, 28 days) .  During follow -up, subjects should be seen as often as 
medica lly indicated to assure safety.  
5.4.5.  Procedures for Cohort Review and Dose Escalation  
Telephone conferences will be scheduled by the sponsor with study investigators in order to 
review cohort -specific data and overall safety data, to agree on dose escalation, adju dicate 
individual high -grade AEs as potentially dose -limiting, and guide other major study decisions.  
5.4.6.  Criteria and Procedures for Dose Interruptions of Study Drug  
Treatment with INCAGN01876 in combination with standard immune therapies may be delayed 
up to  4 weeks (28 days) to allow for resolution of toxicity.  If an interruption  or 
discontinuation  is necessary, all study treatments should be interrupted  or discontinued .  
Subjects may resume treatment if no medical condition or other circumstance exists tha t, in the 
opinion of the investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for further participation in the 
study.  The treating investigator should contact the medical monitor  to discuss the case of any 
subject whose treatment has been delayed for more than  4 weeks (28 days) before restarting 
treatment.  
Instructions for INCAGN01876 dose interruptions are outlined in Table  7.  Individual decisions 
regarding dose interruptions  of study drug should be made using clinical judgment and in 
consultation with the medical monitor  (whenever possible) , taking into account relatedness of the 
AE to the study drug and the subject 's underlyin g condition.  Adverse events that have a clear 
alternative explanation , or transient (≤ 72 hours) abnormal laboratory values without associated 
clinically significant signs or symptoms , may be exempt from dose -interruption  rules.   
Dose interruptions are permitted in the case of medical/surgical events or logistical reasons not 
related to study therapy (eg, elective surgery, unrelated medical events, subject vacation, and/or 
holidays).  Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 4 weeks (28 day s) of the 
scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the medical monitor.  The reason for 
interruption should be documented in the subject's study record.

5.4.7.  Management of Immune -Related Adverse Events  
INCAGN01876, nivolumab, and ipilimumab are considered immune modulators, and it is 
possible that irAEs (both nonserious and serious) may occur.  Adverse events of a potential 
immunologic etiology or irAEs may be defined as an AE consistent with an immune 
phenomenon associated with drug exposure after all other etiologies have been eliminated .  
Immune -related AEs may be expected based on the nature of the study treatment , their 
mechanism of action, and reported exp erience with these and  other immunotherapies.  Special 
attention should be paid to AEs that may be suggestive of potential irAEs.  An irAE can occur 
shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment.   Suspected irAEs 
should be discussed with the medical monitor when possible.  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the 
treating investigator.  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of drug-related 
AEs with potential immunologic etiology are outlined in  Table  8.  Detailed supportive care 
guidelines for specific irAEs can be in found in Appendix  B.  Nivolumab and ipilimumab are 
approved therapies and have specific irAE management guidelines within their package insert; 
the treatin g investigator may use labeled guidance or institutional guidelines for the management 
of irAEs if preferred.  For each AE, attempts should be made to  rule out other causes, including 
but not limited to metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, w hich might require specific 
supportive care.

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  5.4.9.  Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
The occurrence of unacceptable toxicity not caused by the  underlying malignancy will be 
presumed to be related to study treatment  and will require that the study treatment  be 
permanently discontinued.  Unacceptable toxicity is defined as  follows : 
• Grade 4 or life -threatening AEs, except with approval from the medical monitor.  
• ≥ Grade 2 ocular irAE.  
• Occurrence of an AE that is related to treatment , in the judgment of the investigator 
or the medical monitor, and compromises the subject 's ability to continue 
study -specific pr ocedures  or is considered to not be in the subject 's best interest.  
• Persistent AE requiring a delay of treatment  for more than 4 weeks (28 days)  unless a 
greater delay has been approved by the sponsor.  
5.5. Withdrawal of Subjects  From Study Treatment  
5.5.1.  Withdrawal Criteria  
A subject may choose to withd raw from the study treatment at any time or be withdrawn from 
the study treatment by the investigator or sponsor, if the subject is noncompliant with the study 
requirements.  If permanent discontinuation of any of the study treatments is necessary  
(eg, INCAGN01876, nivolumab, ipilimumab), all study treatments, will be discontinued.  If a 
subject is withdrawn  from study treatment , then every reasonable effort should be made to 
determine the reason for withdrawal, and this information should be recorded in th e eCRF.  
Subjects must  be withdrawn from study treatment  for the following reasons:  
• The subject becomes pregnant.  
• Consent is withdrawn.   Subjects may choose to withdraw from the study at any time 
without penalty of jeopardizing their health care or loss of benefits to which the 
subject is otherwise entitled.  
Note:   Consent withdrawn means that the subject can no longer be followed and no 
additional data can be collected.  Subjects may choose to discontinue study treatment 
and remain in the study to be follow ed for progression and survival.   
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, subjects who wi thdraw consent will no longer 
be followed for progression and survival  beyond the last safety follow -up visit .  
• Further participation would be injurious to the subject 's health or well -being , in the 
investigator's medical judgment.  
• Unacceptable toxicity (see Section  5.4.9 ).  Subjects with unacceptable toxicities must  
be withdrawn from study treatment but will continue in the follow -up phase of the 
study (see Section  6.4). 
• The study is terminated by the sponsor.  
• The study is terminated by the local health authority, IRB, or IEC.

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -201 Am 5  Version 5  22 JAN 2021  
VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  A subject  may be discontinued  from study treatment  as follows : 
• Confirmed radiographic progression of disease per RECIST v1.1 (see Section  7.7.1 ).  
A subject may be granted an exception to continue on treatment with confirmed 
radiographic progression if clinically stable or clinically improved (see Section  7.7.1 ). 
Note :  For unconfirmed progression see Section  7.7.1 . 
• If, during the course of the study, a subject is found not to have met eligibility criteria 
(see Section  3), the medical monitor, in collaboration w ith the investigator, will 
determine whether the subject should be withdrawn from the study.  
• If a subject is lost -to-follow -up or noncompliant with study procedures or study 
treatment in the investigator's opinion, the sponsor should be consulted for instr uction 
on handling the subject.  
5.5.2.  Withdrawal Procedures  
In the event that the decision is made to permanently discontinue the study treatment , the subject 
will be withdrawn , and the EOT visit should be conducted.   Reasonable efforts should be made 
to have th e subject return for a ll applicable f ollow -up visit s (safety and efficacy; see Section  6.4).  
The last date of the last dose of study treatment  and the reason for subject withdrawal will be 
recorded  in the eCRF . 
If a subject is withdrawn from the study  treatment : 
• The study monitor or sponsor must be notified.  
• The reason(s)  for withdrawal from treatment must be documented in the subject's 
medical record and in the eCRF.   
Note:   The reason for withdrawal from treatment may be different than the reason for 
withdrawal from study.  For example, subjects can discontinue treatmen t for disease 
progression or toxicity, but remain in the study  for safety and survival follow -up.   
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, subjects who discontinue treatment will no 
longer be followed for progression and s urvival  beyond the last safety follow -up visit . 
• The EOT visit should be performed.  
• The date of the EOT visit should be recorded in the eCRF and IRT. 
• Subjects must be followed for safety until the time of the follow -up visit or until 
study treatment –related toxicities resolve, return to baselin e, or are deemed 
irreversible, or until the subject begins new anticancer therapy, whichever is longest.  
• Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than disease progression will continue to 
be followed for disease status as outlined in Section  6.4.2 . 
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, subjects who discontinue for reasons other than 
disease progression will no longer be followed for disease status beyon d the last 
safety follow -up visit .

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -201 Am 5  Version 5  22 JAN 2021  
VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  • All subjects who discontinue study treatment will continue to be followed for OS as 
outlined in Section  6.4.3 . 
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, subjects who discontinue study treatment will 
no longer be followed for survival beyond the last safety follow -up visit . 
If the subject discontinues study treatment and actively withdraws consent for collection of 
follow -up data (safety follow -up, disease assessment s, or survival follow -up), then no additional 
data collection should occur; however, subjects will have the optio n of withdrawing consent 
for study treatment but continuing in the follow -up period of the study for safety, efficacy, 
and survival assessments . 
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, subjects who withdraw consent but continue in the 
follow -up period will be f ollowed for efficacy and survival until  the last safety follow -up visit . 
5.6. Concomitant Medications  
All concomitant medications and treatments must be recorded in the eCRF.  Any prior 
medication received up to 28 days before the first dose of study treatment  and 60 days after the 
last dose of study treatment, or until the subject begins a new anticancer therapy , whichever 
occurs first,  will be recorded in the eCRF.  Any addition, deletion, or change in the dose of these 
medications will also be recorded.  Conc omitant treatments/procedures that are required to 
manage a subject 's medical condition during the study will also be recorded in the eCRF.  
5.6.1.  Permitted Medications  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject 's welfare may be 
admini stered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of 
medical care.  All concomitant medications will be recorded on the eCRF, including all 
prescription, over -the-counter, herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids .  If changes 
occur during the study period, documentation of drug regimen, frequency, route, and date may 
also be included on the eCRF.  Note :  The use of bisphosphonates and denosumab are permitted 
in this study.  
5.6.2.  Restricted Medications  
Systemic glucocort icoids for any purpose other than prophylaxis for contrast allergies for 
radiographic procedures, or to modulate symptoms or treat an AE of suspected immunologic 
etiology, are restricted and require medical monitor approval.  The use of physiologic 
cortico steroid replacement therapy may be approved after consultation with the medical monitor.  
Note:   Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.  A short course of steroids (prednisone or 
equivalent) ≤ 10 mg/day may be permitted with medical monitor approval.  
5.6.3.  Prohibited Medications  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criter ia (see Section  3.2) are 
not allowed during the study.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these medications or 
vaccinations specifically prohibited during the study, discontinuation from study treatment  may 
be required.  The investigator should discuss any questio ns regarding this with the medical 
monitor .  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -201 Am 5  Version 5  22 JAN 2021  
VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  and/or the subject 's primary physician.  However, the decision to continue the subject on study 
treatment  requires the mutu al agreement of the investigator, the sponsor, and the subject.  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the screening and treatment 
periods of this study , unless otherwise indicated : 
• Any anticancer medications, including chemo therapy or biologic therapy other than study 
treatment.  
• Any immunological -based treatment for any reason from screening through the safety 
follow -up visit is prohibited.  
Note:   Completed adjuvant therapy (eg, vaccines) with medical monitor approval, inhale d 
or topical steroids, systemic steroids at doses ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalents, and 
immune suppressants are allowed for treatment for immune toxicities as described in 
Section  5.4.7  and Appendix  B, or as prophylaxis for contrast allergy for imaging 
procedures . 
Note:   Allergy sh ots may be permitted after consultation with the medical monitor.  
• Investigational agents other than study treatment.  Use of such medications from 
screening through the safety follow -up visit is prohibited.  
• Concomitant radiation therapy.  
Note:   Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be 
considered on an exceptional case -by-case basis after consultation with the medical 
monitor.  The subject must have clear measurable disease outside the radiated field.  
Administration of pall iative radiation therapy will be considered clinical progression for 
the purposes of determining PFS.  
• Live vaccines within 30 days before the first dose of study treatment  and while 
participating in the study.  Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the 
following:  measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus 
Calmette –Guérin, and typhoid (oral) vaccine.  Seasonal influenza vaccine s for injection 
are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed.  However,  intranasal influenza 
vaccines are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.  
Subjects who, in the assessment by the investigator, require the use of any of the aforementioned  
treatments for clinical management should be removed from the study.  Subjects may receive 
other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.  The exclusion criteria 
describe other medications that are prohibited in this study.  Ther e are no prohibited therapies 
during the post -treatment follow -up period.

a Treatment cycles will be Q2W (14 days ± 3 days).  Alternate dose administration schedules and/or fixed doses of INCAGN01876 ( comparable to or less than the highest dose 
levels determined to be safe or pharmacologically active), may also be explored depending on  safety results.  
b The mandatory safety follow -up visits should be conducted approximately 30  days and 60 days after the last dose of study treatment or before the initiation of a new anticancer 
treatment, whichever comes first.  
c As of Protocol Amendment 5, the safety follow -up visits w ill include AE and concomitant medication assessment only and may be completed remotely (such as by televisit).

e Evaluation window only applies to Cycle 6 Day 1.  
f In Treatment Group B, INCAGN01876 is  only administered on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2.  
g In Treatment Groups B, E, H, and L, nivolumab administration begins at Cycle 3 Day 1.  
h For subjects enrolled into Treatment Groups C and C2 (INCAGN01876 + ipilimumab) and Treatment Groups D and J (INCAGN01876 + n ivolumab + ipilimumab), ipilimumab 
will be administered on Cycle 1 Day 1 and then  Day 1 of every 3rd cycle (Cycle 1, Cycle 4, C ycle 7, etc).  In Treatment Groups E and L ipilimumab administration begins at  
Cycle  3 Day 1 and then continues on Day 1 of every third cycle.  If higher doses of ipilimumab are tested (eg, 3 mg/kg every 3 week s [21 days] for 4 doses), then ipilimumab 
will be administered on Day 1 of each 3 -week (21 -day) cycle for a total of 4 doses.  If the scheduled ipilimumab doses fall on days other than Day 1 of a cycle, the subjects will 
need to be present in clinic for the infusion, and any standard procedures requir ed by the site should be performed.  
i Applicable to all subjects at Cycle 1 Day 8.  At Cycle 6 Day 8, only required if subject is experiencing AEs > Grade 2.  
j All 12 -lead ECGs will be performed with the subject in a recumbent or semirecumbent position after 5 minutes of rest and should not be performed within 15 minutes after a 
blood collection.  ECG s will be collected at screening and at least every 8 weeks, or as clinically indicated per prescribing instructions for nivo lumab, as well as the EOT and 
first safety follow -up visits.  
k The ini tial tumor imaging will be performed within 28 days before the first dose of study treatment.  Images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are required for all subjects.  Scans 
performed as part of routine clinical management are acceptable for use as the scr eening scan if they are of diagnostic quality and performed within 28 days before the first dose 
of study treatment.  The same imaging technique should be used for a subject throughout the study.  Local reading (investigat or assessment with site radiology reading) will be 
used to determine eligibility and for subject management.  
l On-study imaging will be performed at Week 8 and then every 8 weeks (± 7 days) for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks (± 7 days) thereafter.  Imaging should follow 
calendar days starting with Day 1 of INCAGN01876 treatment and should NOT be adjusted for delays in cycle starts.  If imaging  shows disease progression, then another 
imaging assessment should be perfor med at a minimum of 4 weeks but no later than 6 weeks later to confirm progression per mRECIST.  
m If scan was obtained within 4 weeks before the date of discontinuation, then a scan at treatment discontinuation (EOT) is not mandatory.  For subjects who discontinue study 
therapy without confirmed disease progression, a radiologic evaluation should be repeated at the time of treatment discontinu ation (ie, date of discontinuation ± 4 week window).  
n For subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression, every effort should be made to continue mo nitoring their disease status every 8 weeks 
(± 7 days) by radiographic  imaging until 1) start of new anticancer therapy, 2) documented disease progression, 3) death, 4) the end of the study, or 5)  withdrawal of consent, 
whichever occurs first.  
Note :  As of Protocol Amendment 5, no further disease status  follow -up assessment s will be required beyond the last safety follow -up visit.

6.1. Screening  
Screening is the interval between signing the ICF and the day the subject is enrolled in the study 
(eg, Cycle 1 Day 1).  Screening may not exceed 28 days.  Informed consent must be obtained 
before performing any study -specific procedures that are not considered standard of care; 
however, procedures conducted as part of the subject's routine clinical management obtained 
before signing of informed consent may be used for screening or baseline purposes with approval 
of the medical monitor, provide d that the procedure meets the Protocol -defined criteria and has 
been performed in the timeframe of the study.  Assessments that are required to demonstrate 
eligibility may be performed over the course of 1 or more days during the screening process.  
Result s from the screening visit evaluations will be reviewed to confirm subject eligibility before 
enrollment.  Tests with results that fail eligibility requirements may be repeated once  during 
screening if the investigator believes the results to be in error.  For screening assessments that are 
repeated, the most recent available result before enrollment will be used to determine subject 
eligibility.  Additionally, a subject who fails screening may repeat the screening process 1 time  if 
the investigator believes there has been a change in eligibility status (eg, after recovery from an 
infection).  Treatment should start as soon as possible after the date of enrollment.

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -201 Am 5  Version 5  22 JAN 2021  
VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  6.2. Treatment  
The treatment period begins on the day the subject recei ves the first dose of study treatment  
(Cycle 1 Day 1) through the point at which the investigator determines that the subject will be 
permanently discontinued from study treatment, or for up to 24 months from the first dose of 
study treatment, whichever oc curs first .  Cycle 1 Day 1 must be no more than 28 days after the 
subject has signed the ICF  and should be within 3 days of enrollment in the study .  Subjects will 
have regularly scheduled study visits as outlined in Table  10 and toxicities will be monitored 
continuously and will be graded using the NCI CTCAE v4.03 criteria.  
6.3. End of Treatment  
When  the subject permanently discontinues study treatment , the EOT  visit should be conducted.  
If the EOT visit coincides with a regular study visit, the EOT  evaluations will supersede those of 
that scheduled visit, and the data should be entered in the EOT  visit in the eCRF.  The subject 
should be encouraged to return f or the safety and survival f ollow -up visits. 
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, subjects who permanently discontinue study treatment w ill 
no longer be followed for survival beyond the last safety follow -up visit . 
6.4. Follow -Up 
6.4.1.  Safety Follow -Up 
The safety f ollow -up period  is the interval between the EOT visit and the scheduled follow -up 
visit, which should occur 30  days (+ 7 days) and 60 days (+ 7 days) after the last dose of study 
treatment.  Monitoring for the occurrence of new AEs should be continued for at least 60 days 
after the last dose of study treatment or until the start of new anticancer therapy, whichever 
occurs first .  Reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject return for the follow -up 
visits and report any AEs that may occur during th is period .  If a subject is scheduled  to begin a 
new anticancer therapy before the end of the 30-day or 60 -day safety follow -up period, the safety 
follow -up visit should be performed before new anticancer therapy is started.  Once new 
anticancer therapy ha s been initiated, AEs and SAEs will no longer be collected, and the subject 
will move into the survival follow -up period . 
Note:   As of Protocol Amendment 5, the safety follow -up visits will include AE and concomitant 
medication assessment only and may be c ompleted remotely (such as by televisit).  
Note :  As of Protocol Amendment 5, if a new anticancer therapy has been initiated before the 
end of the safety follow -up period, no further survival follow -up assessment will be required 
beyond the last safety foll ow-up visit.  
6.4.2.  Disease Status Follow -Up 
Subjects who discontinue study treatment for a reason other than  disease progression 
(eg, toxicity) will move into the disease status follow -up period and should be assessed every 
8 weeks (± 7 days ), for 12 months.  After 12 months, radiologic assessments will be performed 
every 12 weeks until disease progression is determined.   Every effort should be made to collect 
information regarding disease status until:

Note :  As of Protocol Amendment 5, disease status follow -up will no longer be required beyond 
the last safety follow -up visit  for subjects who discontinue study treatment for a reason other 
than disea se progression.  The last disease status follow -up data will be recorded in the eCRF at 
the time of the last safety follow -up visit .  The last study visit will be the last safety follow -up 
visit.  
6.4.3.  Survival Follow -Up 
Once a subject has received the last dose  of study treatment , confirmed disease progression, or 
starts a new anticancer therapy,  the subject moves into the survival follow -up period and should 
be contacted by telephone, email, or visit at least every 12 weeks  (+ 7 days)  to assess for survival 
status until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first. 
Note :  As of Protocol Amendment 5, survival  follow -up will no longer be required  beyond the 
last safety follow -up visit  for subjects who have confirmed  disease progres sion or start a new 
anticancer therapy .  The last survival follow -up data will be recorded in the eCRF at the time of 
the last safety follow -up visit .  The last study visit will be the last safety follow -up visit.  
6.5. End of Study  
The end of the study will occur when all subjects have completed the last study follow -up visit or 
have discontinued study treatment  and have completed applicable follow -up assessments.  
Additionally, subjects will be considered as having completed the stu dy if they meet any of the 
following criteria:  
• Subject dies and a date of death is available.  
• Subject is known to have died; however, the date of death cannot be obtained.  
(NOTE :  Every effort must be made to obtain the date of death.)  
• Consent is withdrawn for any further contact related to this study.  
− Every reasonable effort should be made to determine the reason a subject 
withdraws prematurely, and this information should be recorded in the eCRF.  
• The study is terminated by the sponsor.  
• The study is terminated by the local health authority or IRB or IEC.  
6.6. Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled study visits may occur at any time if medically warranted.  Any assessments 
performed at those visits should be recorded in the eCRF.

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  7. CONDUCT OF STUDY ASS ESSMENTS AND  PROCEDURES  
Individual study procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to perform these 
procedures at unscheduled timepoints if deemed clinically necessary by the investigator.  
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed  necessary for reasons related to 
subject safety.  In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be potentially sensitive in nature 
(eg, HIV, HCV), and thus local regulations may require that additional informed consent be 
obtained from the subject.  In these  cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in 
accordance with those regulations.  Per Section  3.1, subjects of childbearing potential must ag ree 
to take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy in order to participate in the study 
(Appendix  A). 
7.1. Administration of Informed Consent Form  
Valid informed consent must be obtained from the study subject before conducting any 
study -specific procedures using an ICF approved by the local IRB/IEC that contains all elements 
required by ICH E6 and describes the nature, scope, and possible conse quences of the study in a 
form understandable to the study subject.  Additional consent may also be required per local 
regulatory agencies.  Local and institutional guidelines for ICF content and administration must 
be followed; the original signed ICF mus t be retained by the investigator, and a copy of the 
signed ICF must be provided to the study subject.  The informed consent process for each subject 
must be documented in writing within the subject source documentation.  
7.2. Interactive Response Technology System Procedure  
The site will contact the IRT  to obtain a subject identification number when a subject enters the 
prescreening phase.  Upon determining that the subject is eligible for study entry, the IRT will be 
contacted to obtain the treatment group  assignment.  Additionally, the IRT will be contacted to 
update the subject 's disposition, disease response, and for study drug resupply.  Refer to the IRT 
manual for detailed instructions.   
During Phase 2 of the study, the IRT system will be updated based on the PoS calculations 
discussed in Section  9.6.  Probability of success  calculations will be performed based on 
response data available within the IRT  system and treatment groups may be closed  to subject 
assignment if the Po S for a treatment group -tumor type combination is below the futility 
threshold.  Subjects will be assigned sequentially to treatment groups that are open to assignment 
based on these  PoS calculations.  Periodically, the sponsor will review the disease response data 
within the IRT system for consistency with the clinical database and request changes to resolve 
discrepancies.

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  7.3. Demography and Medical History  
7.3.1.  Demographics and General Medic al History  
Demographic data and a complete medical and medication history will be collected at screening 
by the investigator or qualified designee and will include date of birth, race, ethnicity, medical 
and surgical history, and current illnesses.  Medica l history will include relevant medical or 
surgical treatment within the last 10 years that are considered to be clinically significant  by 
the investigator.  
7.3.2.  Disease Characteristics and Treatment History  
A disease -targeted medical and medication history wil l be collected at screening.  Details 
regarding the subject 's malignancy under study including date of diagnosis, initial and current 
cancer stage, tumor histology, relevant disease characteristics, and prior treatments including 
systemic, radiation, and surgical procedures will be recorded.  
7.4. Prior and Concomitant Medication s and Procedures  
Prior and concomitant medications and procedures will be reviewed to determine subject 
eligibility.  Any medication received or procedure performed within 28 days before  the first dose 
of study treatment,  up to the end of the safety follow -up phase , or until the subject starts a new 
anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first,  will be recorded in the eCRF.  The medication record 
will be maintained after signing the ICF to document concomitant medications, including any 
changes to the dose or regimen.  Concomitant medications include any prescription, 
over-the-counter, or natural/herbal preparations taken or administered during the study period.  
Concomitant treatments and/o r procedures that are required to manage a subject 's medical 
condition during the study will also be recorded in the eCRF.  See Section  5.6 for detai ls 
regarding restricted and prohibited medications.  
7.5. Poststudy Anticancer Therapy Status  
The investigator or qualified designee will review all new anticancer therapy initiated after the 
last dose of study treatment .  If a subject initiates a new anticancer therapy within 30 to 60 days 
after the last dose of study treatment , the 30 -day or 60 -day safety follow -up visit should occur 
before the first dose of the new anticancer therapy.  
Note :  As of Protocol Amendment 5, information on new anticancer therapy will no longer be 
collected beyond the last safety follow -up visit . 
7.6. Safety Assessments  
Nivolumab and ipilimumab are approved therapies ; therefore, the investigator should refer to and 
follow the safety management guidelines as appropriate within the  approved  package insert for 
both compounds.

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  7.6.1.  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be monitored from the time the subject signs the ICF.  Subjects will be 
instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the occurrence of AEs 
throughout the study.  In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects will be asked general, 
nonleading questions such as "How are you feeling?"  All AEs (serious  and nonserious) must be 
recorded on the source documents and eCRFs regardless of the assumption of a causal 
relationship with the study drug.  The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs 
are described in Section  8. 
7.6.2.  Physical Examinations  
Physical examinations must be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed 
physician, physician's assistant, or an advanced regi stered nurse practitioner, as local law 
permits.  Clinically notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the 
judgement of the investigator are to be reported as AEs.  
7.6.2.1.  Comprehensive Physical  Examination  
The comprehensive physical exam ination will include assessment(s) of the following organ or 
body systems:  skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular system; 
abdomen (liver, spleen); extremities; and lymph nodes, as well as a brief neurological 
examination.   The screening physical examination should also include a measurement of height.  
7.6.2.2.  Targeted Physical  Examination  
The targeted physical examination will be a symptom -directed evaluation conducted by the 
investigator or a medically qualified designee.  The ta rgeted physical examination will include 
assessment(s) of the body systems or organs, as indicated by subject symptoms, AEs, or other 
findings.   
7.6.3.  Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, pulse , respiratory rate, and body temperature .  
Blood pressure and pulse will be taken with the subject in the recumbent, semirecumbent , or 
sitting position after 5  minutes of rest.   Weight will also be assessed at each study visit.  
Clinically notable abnormalities that are considered clinically signific ant in the judgment of the 
investigator are to be reported as AEs.   
7.6.4.  Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead ECGs will be performed at the study site with the subject in a recumbent or 
semi recumbent  position after 5  minutes of rest  as outlined in Table  10. 
The 12 -lead ECG  readings  will be interpreted by the investigator at the site  to be used for 
immediate subject management.   Additional 12 -lead E CGs may be performed as clinically 
indicated, or as per the nivolumab prescribing instructions, to manage subject safety.  The 
decision to include  or exclude a subject or withdraw a subject from  the study treatment based on 
an ECG flagged as "Abnormal, Cli nically Significant"  is the responsibility of the investigator, in 
consultation with the m edical monitor, as appropriate.   Clinically notable abnormalities that are 
considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator  are to be reported as  AEs.

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -201 Am 5  Version 5  22 JAN 2021  
VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  In the event that a single QTc is >  470 milliseconds at screening, the subject may enroll if the 
average QTc for the 3 ECGs is <  470 milliseconds  or with approval from the medical monitor .  
For subjects with an intraventricular conduction delay (QRS  interval > 120 milliseconds) at 
screening, the JTc interval may be used in place of the QTc with medical monitor  approval.  In 
addition, the JTc interval should be used for all subsequent assessments.  
7.6.5.  Laboratory Assessments  
A certified laboratory local to  the study site and subject will perform all clinical laboratory 
assessments for safety (ie, blood chemistries, hematology assessments, coagulation tests, 
endocrine function, and urinalysis).  The investigative site will enter the laboratory results and 
laboratory normal ranges into the eCRF.  All local laboratory assessments should be performed 
using standard procedures on the days indicated in Table  11.  Table  12 lists the specific 
laboratory analytes required for each test.  Additional testing may be required by the sponsor 
based on emerging safety dat a.  Additional tests may also be performed if clinically indicated.  
Screening laboratory assessments must be performed within 7 days of Cycle 1 Day 1.  If 
performed more than 7 days before Cycle 1 Day 1, then the tests must be repeated and eligibility 
confirmed before study drug administration on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Laboratory samples collected on 
study Day 1 must be performed before study drug administration.  After Cycle 1, predose 
laboratory procedures can be conducted up to 72 hours before study drug admini stration (within 
the 3 -day study window), and results should be reviewed by the investigator or qualified 
designee and found to be acceptable before a new cycle of treatment is initiated.  
7.6.5.1.  Pregnancy Testing  
A local laboratory serum pregnancy test will be re quired for all women of childbearing potential 
during screening and at EOT.  The serum pregnancy test performed at screening must be 
performed within 72 hours before the first dose of study drug.  Urine pregnancy tests will be 
performed locally as outlined  in Table  11, as medically indicated (eg, in case of loss of menstrual 
cycle , when pregnancy is suspected ), or per country -specific requirements (note t hat 
country -required urine  pregnancy testing will be outlined and communicated to investigational 
sites under separate cover ).  If a urine pregnancy test is positive, then the results should be 
confirmed with a serum pregnancy test.  
If the serum pregnancy  test is negative after a urine test was positive, then the investigator will 
assess the potential benefit/risk to the subject and determine whether it is in the subject's best 
interest to resume study treatment and continue participation in the study.  
7.6.5.2.  Hepatitis Screening Tests  
Hepatitis screening assessments will be performed at the screening visit ( Table  11) to rule out 
hepatitis infection; required analytes are shown in  Table  12.  Generally, hepatitis tests should be 
performed early in the screening process due to the length of time needed to obtain the results.  
Additional tests may be performed if clinically indicat ed.

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  7.7. Efficacy Assessments  
7.7.1.  Modified RECIST v1.1 Assessment Disease  
Modified RECIST will be applied by the site as the primary measure for assessment of tumor 
response and as a basis for Protocol guidelines related to disease status (eg, discontinuation of 
study therapy).  As noted in Section  1.5.4.1 , RECIST v1.1 has been adapted to account for the 
unique tumor responses seen with immunotherapy ( Wolchok et al 2009 ). 
If radiologic imaging shows progressive disease, tumor assessment should be repeated at a 
minimum of 4 weeks, but no later than 6 weeks later to confirm progression, with the option of 
continuing treatment while  awaiting radiologic confirmation of progression.  Table  13 provides 
instructions on how to proceed with treatment based on the subject's clinical status once the 
initial scan showing radiologic evidence of progression is observed.  
Subjects may receive treatment while waiting for confirmation of progression if the y are 
clinically stable as defined by the following criteria:  
• Absence of clinically significant signs and symptoms (including worsening of 
laboratory values) indicating disease progression . 
• No decline in ECOG performance status.  
• Absence of rapid progressio n of disease.  
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention .

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  7.7.1.1.2.  Tumor Imaging During the Study  
The first imaging assessment should be performed 8 weeks after the first dose of 
INCAGN01876 and then every 8 weeks (56 days ± 7 days), for 12 mon ths and then every 
12 weeks thereafter until disease progression is determined.   Imaging assessments may be 
done more frequently if clinically indicated.  Imaging should not be delayed for delays in 
cycle starts . 
Per mRECIST v1.1, response should be confir med by a repeat radiographic assessment not less 
than 4 weeks from the date the response was first documented.  The scan for confirmation of 
response may be performed at the earliest 4 weeks after the first indication of response or at the 
next scheduled s can, whichever is clinically indicated.  
Imaging should continue to be performed until documented disease progression, the start of new 
anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, death, or the end of the study, whichever occurs 
first.  Disease progression  should be confirmed at least 4 weeks, but no later than 6 weeks, after 
the first scan indicating progression in clinically stable subjects.  Subjects who have unconfirmed 
disease progression may continue on treatment until progression is confirmed, provid ed that they 
have met the conditions detailed in Section  7.7.1 .  A central imaging vendor will not be used in 
this study.  
7.7.1.1.3.  Imaging During Follow -Up 
If the subject discontinues study treatment  for reasons other than disease progression, imaging 
assessments should continue at the Protocol -specified interval until documented disease 
progression, the start of new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consen t, death, or the end of the 
study, whichever occurs first.  
Note :  As of Protocol A mendment 5, follow -up imaging to monitor disease status is no longer 
required beyond the last safety follow -up visit  (see Section  6.4.2 ) for subjects who discontinue 
study treatment for reasons other than disease progression.  
7.8. Performance and Quality -of-Life Assessments

Subjects will be provided with a reminder card  at each visit.   The subject reminder cards will 
remind the subject of the date/time of the next visit, as well as any necessary instructions.   
7.11.2.  Data Collection for Survival Follow -Up 
For subjects having entered the survival  follow -up period of the study , the site will u se 
continuing subject  records to supply data on subsequent treatment regimens, tumor assessments 
(if discontinued treatment for a reason other than progression), and OS in the eCRF.  For subjects 
who do not intend to return to the study investigator  for th eir ongoing care, follow -up should be 
maintained by phone contact , patient  records, and public records/databases  at intervals of no 
longer than 12 weeks .  After the final primary analysis is performed,  the follow -up interval for 
subsequent anticancer treat ments and survival may be reduced to every 16 weeks or eliminated 
(see Section  6.4.3 ). 
Note :  As of Protocol Amendment 5, data collection for survival follow -up is  no longer required  
beyond the last safety follow -up visit .  The last survival follow -up data will be recorded in the 
eCRF at the time of the last safety follow -up visit .

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  8. SAFETY MONITORING AN D REPORTING  
8.1. Adverse Events  
8.1.1.  Definitions  
For t he purposes of this Protocol, an AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, that occurs 
after a subject provides informed consent.  Abnormal laboratory values or tes t results occurring 
after informed consent constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are 
considered clinically meaningful, require therapy (eg, hematologic abnormality that requires 
transfusion), or require changes in the study drug(s) . 
8.1.2.  Reporting  
Adverse events that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse 
Events form of the eCRF.  Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent 
should be recorded on the Medical History form in the eC RF.  Monitoring for the occurrence of 
new AEs should be continued for at least 60  days after the last dose of study treatment  or until 
the start of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first.  Adverse events (including laboratory 
abnormalities that con stitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible 
rather than by individual underlying signs and symptoms.   
The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, should no t be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is considered more 
severe than expected for the participant's condition or considered to be treatment -related by the 
investigator.  Additionally, efficacy endpoints as outlined in Section  2.2 will not be reported as 
AE/SAEs, specifically, any event that is related to disease progression of the cancer under study.  
Unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and s afety data will be monitored to ensure the 
safety of the subjects in the study.  Any suspected endpoint that upon review is not progression 
of the cancer under study will be forwarded to Incyte Pharmacovigilance as an SAE within 
24 hours of determination t hat the event is not progression of the cancer under study.  
The severity of AEs will be assessed using CTCAE v4.03 Grades 1 through 5.  If an event is not 
classified by CTCAE, the severity of the AE will be graded according to the scale below to 
estimate t he grade of severity:  
Grade  1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate activities of daily living.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting 
self-care activities of daily living.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death due to AE  
Incyte Biosciences  International S àrl Page  97 of 140 
Protocol INCAGN 1876 -201 Am 5  Version 5  22 JAN 2021  
VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  The occurrence of AEs should be sought by nondirective questioning of the subject during the 
screening process after signing the ICF and at each visit during the study.  Adverse events may 
also be detected when they are volunteered by the subject during the screening process or 
between visits, or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments.  To the 
extent possible, each AE should be evaluated to determine:  
• The severity grade (CTCAE Gr ade 1 to 5). 
• Whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study 
treatment:  suspected (yes) or not suspected (no).  
− Note :  causality assessment for each agent administered per study must be 
indicated.  
• The start and end dates, unless unresolved at final follow -up. 
• The action taken with regard to study drug.  
• The event outcome (eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, 
recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown).  
• The seriousness, as per  SAE definition provided in Section  8.3.1 . 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting 
requirements  (see Section  8.3.2 ). 
All AEs should be treated appropriately.  If an AE is treated with a concomitant medication or 
nondrug therapy, this action should be recorded on Adverse Event form and the treatment should 
be specified on the Prior/Concomitant Medications or Procedures and Non -Drug Therapy form 
in the eCRF.  
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it has resolved or until it is judg ed to be 
permanent; assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to 
treat the event, and the outcome.  
When the severity of an AE changes over time for a reporting period (eg, between visits), each 
change in severity will be reported as a separate AE until the event resolves.  For example, 
2 separate AEs will be reported if a subject has Grade  1 diarrhea, meeting the definition of  an 
AE, that lasts for 3  days before worsening to a Grade  3 severity.  The Grade  1 event will be 
reported as an AE with a start date equal to the day the event met the Grade  1 AE definition and 
a stop date equal to the day that the event increased in sever ity from Grade  1 to Grade  3.  The 
Grade  3 event will also be reported as an AE, with the start date equal to the day the event 
changed in intensity from Grade  1 to Grade  3 and a stop date equal to the day that the event 
either changed severity again or res olved.

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -201 Am 5  Version 5  22 JAN 2021  
VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  8.2. Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE in their own right (considered clinically 
meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require 
interruption of  study treatment ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event form in the eCRF.  
Whenever possible, a diagnosis rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, "anemia" instead 
of "low hemoglobin").  Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for AEs should be 
followed until they have  returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is 
found.  When an abnormal laboratory test result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a 
previously reported AE, it is not necessary to separately record the laboratory test result as an 
additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities that do not meet the definition of an AE should not be reported as AEs.  
A Grade  3 or 4 (severe) AE does not automatically indicate an SAE unless it meets the definition 
of serious, as defined in Section  8.3.1 .  A dose modification for the laboratory abnormality may 
be required (see Section  5.4) and should not contribute to the designation of a laboratory test 
abnormality as an SAE.  
8.3. Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.1.  Definitions  
An SAE is defined as an event that meets at least 1 of the following criteria:  
• Is fatal or l ife-threatening.  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless 
hospitalization is a result of:  
− A routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with 
any deterioration in condition.  
− An elec tive surgery or preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the 
ICF. 
− A treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of  a SAE and not resulting in hospital admission.  
− Any social reasons and respite care, in the absence of any deterioration in the 
subject's general condition.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability, incapacity, or a substantial disruption of 
a perso n's ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Is considered to be an important medical event or a medically significant event that 
may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require hospit alization but 
may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, the event 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
1 of the outcomes listed above.

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  8.3.2.  Reporting  
Every SAE, regardless of suspected causality (eg, relationship to study drug(s) or study 
procedure or disease progression), occurring after the subject has signed the ICF through the last 
study visit (or 60 days after the last dose of study treatment , or u ntil the subject receives a new 
anticancer therapy whichever occurs earlier) must be reported to the sponsor (or designee) within 
24 hours  of learning of its occurrence, unless otherwise specified by the Protocol.   Any SAEs 
occurring more than 60 days afte r the last dose of study treatment  should be reported to the 
sponsor or its designee only if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study drug.   
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Adverse Event form of the eCRF.  
The investigator must assess and record the causal relationship of each SAE to each specific 
study treatment.  The investigator must also complete the Incyte Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form, in English, and send the completed and signed form to the sponso r or designee within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the SAE.  The investigator must provide a causality assessment, 
that is, assess whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that the SAE is related to the 
specific study treatment:  suspected (yes) or not suspected (no).  Refer to the Incyte Reference 
Guide for Completing the Serious Adverse Event Report Form.  
The contact information of the sponsor's study -specific representatives is listed in the 
investigator manual provided to each site.  The origi nal copy of the SAE Report Form and the 
confirmation sheet must be kept at the study site.  
Investigational site personnel must report any new information regarding the SAE within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the information in the same manner that the ini tial SAE Report 
Form was sent.  Follow -up information is recorded on an amended or new SAE Report Form, 
with an indication that it is follow -up to the previously reported SAE and the date of the original 
report.  The follow -up report should include informa tion that was not provided on the previous 
SAE Report Form, such as the outcome of the event (eg, resolved or ongoing), treatment 
provided, action taken with study drug because of the SAE (eg, dose interrupted or 
discontinued), or subject disposition (eg, continued or withdrew from study participation).  Each 
recurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as follow -up to 
that event.  
If the SAE is not documented in the IB for the study drug (new occurrence) and is thought t o be 
related to the sponsor's study drug, the sponsor or its designee may urgently require further 
information from the investigator for reporting to health authorities.  The sponsor or its designee

with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reactions will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics 
committees in accordance with Direct ive 2001/20/EC, or as per national regulatory requirements

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  8.5. Pregnancy  
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that study drug ma y 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication or method.  When a 
pregnancy has been confirmed in a subject during maternal or paternal exposure to study drug, 
the following procedures should be followed in order to ensure subject s afety:  
• The study treatment must be discontinued immediately (female subjects only).  
• The investigator must complete and submit the Incyte Clinical Trial Pregnancy form 
to the sponsor or its designee within 24 hours  of learning of the pregnancy.  
• A serum preg nancy test must be performed to confirm the urine pregnancy test result.  
If a negative serum test does not confirm the urine pregnancy result, then:  
− The investigator will use his or her expert judgment, based on an assessment of 
the potential benefit/risk  to the subject, to determine whether it is in the subject's 
best interest to resume study treatment and continue participation in the study.  
• The EOT visit evaluations must be performed.  
Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety 
evaluation.  Follow -up should be conducted for each pregnancy to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by following 
until the first well -baby visit.  Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy form 
and reported by the investigator to the sponsor or its designee.  Pregnancy follow -up information 
shoul d be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible causal 
relationship to the sponsor's study drug to any pregnancy outcome, as well as follow -up to the 
first well -baby visit or the duration specified in local regulations, whic hever is later.  Refer to the 
Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form.  
Any SAE occurring during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE report form and 
submitted to the sponsor or designee.  
8.6. Warnings and Precautions  
Special war nings or precautions for the study drug, derived from safety information collected by 
the sponsor or its designee, are presented in the Investigator's Brochure.  Additional safety 
information collected between IB updates will be communicated in the form of  Investigator 
Notifications.  Any important new safety information should be discussed with the subject during 
the study, as necessary.  If new significant risks are identified, they will be added to the ICF.

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  8.7. Data Monitoring Committee  
Formal safety data reviews will be conducted by the study team (eg, medical monitor, clinical 
scientist, and biostatistician)  and an independent internal review committee  at least every 
6 months.  Details regarding data monitoring will be addressed in the Data Safety Monitorin g 
Charter . 
8.8. Product Complaints  
The sponsor collects product complaints on study drugs and drug delivery systems used in 
clinical studies in order to ensure the safety of study participants, monitor quality, and facilitate 
process and product improvements.  
All product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and released by the sponsor 
or its designee will be reported to the sponsor.  All product complaints associated with other 
study material will be reported directly to the respective manufact urer. 
The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for reporting a complete description of the 
product complaint via email or other written communication to the sponsor contact or respective 
manufacturer as noted in the packaging information.  Any A E associated with a product 
complaint should be reported as described in Section  8.1.2  of this Protocol.  
If the investigator is asked to return the product for investigation, he/she will return a copy of the 
product complaint communication with the product.

30% 56.1%  
40% 35.0%  
50% 18.9%  
60% 8.8%  
For example, if the true DLT rate is 50% at a given dose level, there is an 18.9% chance that the 
dose would be escalated.  Further, if the true DLT rate is 20%, there is a 78.4% chance that the 
dose would be escalated.  If the MTD is not determined at the highest dose level tested during 
the study, then the MTD is at or above the highest dose level.  The MTD is below the lowes t 
dose level of INCAGN01876 if the Cohor t 1 dose is not well -tolerated.  
9.2.2.  Sample Size for Phase 2  
Phase 2 will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy,  
 of the recommended dose of INCAGN01876 in combinati on with immune therapies as 
part of doublet and triplet drug expansion cohorts.  In Phase 2, a Simon 2 -stage design will be 
run for the cervical cancer, gastric cancer, SCCHN and PD -1/PD -L1 relapsed melanoma cohorts 
within a given doublet or triplet treatm ent group.  A Simon 2 -stage design with an expansion 
stage will be used for the PD -1 refractory SCCHN cohort.  
The sample size for each tumor type within a given doublet or triplet expansion cohort will be 
guided by the Simon 2 -stage design  (except for the PD-1 refractory SCCHN cohort in Treatment 
Group F).  The planned  Simon 2 -stage designs are summarized in Table  19.  Each Simon 2 -stage 
design will have  a stopping rule to allow early termination of a particular tumor type within the 
given treatment combination at the end of Stage 1 if there is insufficient response observed 
(calculated response rate < p0), while enrolling enough subjects to predict possi ble target 
responses (≥ p1) worthy of cohort expansion and potentially further evaluation in future studies.  
The individual Simon 2 -stage designs run for each tumor type within each doublet or triplet 
expansion cohort will have design parameters that are determined by historical response rates.  
The same Simon 2 -stage design parameters will be used for alternative dosing sequences in the 
same tumor type and treatment combination.  For example, the gastric cohorts in Treatment 
Groups F, G, and H will all us e the same Simon 2 -stage parameters.  
In order to determine whether the target response rate ( p1) is likely, an initial number of 
evaluable subjects ( n1 subjects) treated at the MTD or PAD and schedule of INCAGN01876 
within the corresponding doublet or triplet expansion cohort will be enrolled in a cohort 
(Stage  1).  If there are r1 or fewer responses in the cohort, it will be concluded that the true 
response rate is unlikely to be greater than or equal to the target rate, and no more subjects will 
be enrolled in that tumor type in Stage 2.  In the cohorts in which greater than r1 responses are 
observed among the Stage  1 subjects, n2 additional evaluable s ubjects will be treated in Stage  2 
to estimate the response rate.  At the end of Stage 2, if ≤ r subjects have responded among the n 
evaluable subjects, the doublet or triplet schedule will be declared nonpromising for that cohort.

warranted in the study cohort.  
n3:  Number of subjects enrolled in the expansion stage.  
9.3. Level of Significance  
For the primary efficacy endpoints, the 1 -sided Type I error will be controlled at 0.05 for each 
individual cohort expansion.   Note that this level of significance does not account for the 
multiple expansion cohorts.   For other endpoints, confidence intervals  will be reported at a  95% 
confidence level.  
9.4. Statistical Analyses  
9.4.1.  Efficacy Analyses  
9.4.1.1.  Primary Efficacy Analyses  
In Phase 2, the proportion of subjects who meet the objective response criteria (CR + PR) per 
RECIST v1.1 will be summarized by tumor type.  
For the cohorts using a Simo n 2-stage design, if there are no resp onses in each tumor type –
specific doublet or triplet treatment group out of the n1 evaluable subjects specific to that tumor 
type–specific doublet or triplet treatment group (consistent with a calculated response rate < p0) 
at Stage 1, then the study will be stopped for futility, and the null hypothesis is not rejected.  
Otherwise, in the tumor types in which greater than r1 responses among the evaluable Stage 1 
subjects is observed, where r1 is also specific to the tumor type and doublet or triplet expansion 
cohort, an additional n2 evaluable subjects will be treated in Stage 2.  If there are ≤ r responders 
among the evaluable subjects at the end of Stage 2, then the drug will be declared non promising 
for that tumor type within the given doublet or triplet expansion cohort, and the null hypothesis 
is not rejected.  Further investigation of the study drug will be considered interesting (predictive 
of ≥ p1 response rate) if > r responses are obs erved in the first n evaluable subjects.   
For the PD -1 refractory SCCHN cohort using a Simon 2 -stage design with an expansion stage, if 
there is an insufficient number of responses observed at the end of Stage 1  or Stage 2, the cohort 
will be terminated e arly for futility.  If the number of responders observed is > r1 for Stage 1 and 
> r2 for Stage 2, an additional number of evaluable subjects needed for the next stage ( n2 and n3, 
respectively) will be enrolled.  At the end of the expansion stage, if the n umber of responders 
observed is ≤ r among the n evaluable subjects, then the drug will be declared nonpromising for 
the PD -1 refractory SCCHN cohort.  If > r responders are observed, the drug will be declared 
promising for further investigation.

9.4.1.2.  Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Disease control rate, defined as the proportion of subjects who have disease control (CR + PR + 
SD), as per RECIST v1.1 and mRECIST v1.1 will be summarized.  
Progression -free survival, DOR, and duration of disease control will be estimated using the 
Kaplan -Meier method as per RECIST v1.1 and mRECIST v1.1.  Overall survival will be 
estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method.  
In Phase 2, the proportion of subjects who meet the objec tive response criteria (CR + PR) per 
RECIST v1.1 and mRECIST v1.1 will be summarized by tumor type.  
9.4.2.  Safety Analyses  
9.4.2.1.  Adverse Events  
A TEAE is any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a pre -existing event after 
first dose of study drug.  Ana lysis of AEs will be limited to TEAEs, but data listings will include 
all AEs regardless of their timing to study drug administration.  Adverse events will be tabulated 
by the MedDRA preferred term and system organ class.  Severity of AEs will be based on the 
NCI CTCAE v4.03  using Grades 1 through 5 . 
The subset of AEs considered by the investigator to have a relationship to study drug will be 
considered to be treatment -related AEs.  If the investigator does not specify the relationship of 
the AE to study dr ug, the AE will be considered treatment -related.  The incidence of AEs and 
treatment -related AEs will be tabulated.  
9.4.2.2.  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Laboratory test values outside the normal range will be assessed for severity based on the normal 
ranges for the c linical reference laboratory.  The incidence of abnormal laboratory values and 
shift tables relative  to baseline will be tabulated.  
Laboratory data will be classified into Grades 1 through 5 using CTCAE v4.03.   The following 
summaries will be produced for the laboratory data:  
• Number and percentage of subjects with worst postb aseline CTC AE grade (regardless 
of baseline value).  Each subject will be counted only for the worst grade observed 
postbaseline.  
• Shift ta bles from  baseline to the worst postbaseline value using  CTC AE grade.  
• For laboratory parameters where CTC AE grades are not defined, shift tables to the 
worst postbaseline value using the low/normal/high  classifications based on 
laboratory reference ranges.

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  9.6.2.  Integrated Bayesian Futility Analysis  
A second approach to determining whether the treatment is active or not across the cohorts will 
use an integrated  Bayesian analysis  of tumor and dosing  strategies based on Simon  et al ( 2016 ).  
The integrated Bayesian analysis wi ll be used for the cervical cancer, gastric cancer, and SCCHN 
cohorts.   Pooling is performed within dosing strategies and tumor types to determine if 
INCAGN01876 is active within any of the given dosing  strategies, given tumor types, or given 
dosing  strate gy-tumor type combinations.   The first Bayesian pooling analysis  will allow sharing 
of information within a  tumor type  across dosing strategies  based on a joint Bayesian prior.  The 
joint Bayesian prior incorporates the unacceptable and target response rat es from the Simon 
2-stage designs with a parameter indicating the prior probability of homogeneity within the 
tumor types, which controls the degree of information sharing.  A separate analysis will allow 
sharing of information for dosing strategies  across tumor types using a separate joint Bayesian 
prior.  For this analysis, the joint Bayesian prior incorporates the unacceptable and target 
response rates from the Simon 2 -stage designs with a parameter indicating the prior probability 
of homogeneity within the dosing strategies , which controls the degree of information sharing.  
Each time a subject with the tumor type of interest is enrolled, two PoS calculations will be 
performed using the evaluable subjects:  the PoS in tumor type (tumor type i and dosing strategy j), 
PoS 1ij, and PoS within dosing strategy  (tumor type i and dosing strategy j), PoS 2ij. 
Based on the results of the 2 calculated posterior PoS values, a tumor -sequence  pair ( i,j) will be 
considered open for enrollment  if and only if  either  PoS 1ij ≥ 20% or PoS 2ij ≥ 20%.  Otherwise the 
tumor -sequence  pair will be suspended.  
At the end of the study, overall PoS tests will be performed using both PoS 1ij and PoS 2ij.  A 
tumor -sequence  strategy will be considered successful if either PoS 1ij or PoS 2ij > 80%.

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  − The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the safety reports provided by the 
sponsor are review ed and processed in accordance with regulatory requirements 
and with the policies and procedures established by the IRB/IEC.  
• Adhering to the Protocol as described in this document and agreeing that changes to 
the Protocol procedures, with the exception of medical emergencies, must be 
discussed and approved, first, by the sponsor or its designee and, second, by the 
IRB/IEC.  Each investigator is responsible for enrolling subjects who have met the 
specified eligibility criteria.  
• Retaining records in accordanc e with all local, national, and regulatory laws, but for a 
minimum period of at least 2  years after the last marketing application approval in an 
ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in 
an ICH region, or if not a pproved, 2  years after the termination of the test article for 
investigation to ensure the availability of study documentation should it become 
necessary for the sponsor or a regulatory authority to review.  
− The investigator must not destroy any records ass ociated with the study without 
receiving approval from the sponsor.  The investigator must notify the sponsor or 
its designee in the event of accidental loss or destruction of any study records.  If 
the investigator leaves the institution where the study w as conducted, the sponsor 
or its designee must be contacted to arrange alternative record storage options.  
− All eCRF data entered by the site (including audit trail), as well as computer 
hardware and software (for accessing the data), will be maintained or made 
available at the site in compliance with applicable record retention regulations.  
The sponsor will retain the original eCRF data and audit trail.  
10.1.1.  Identification of the Coordinating Principal Investigator  
A coordinating principal investigator will be appointed by the sponsor before the end of the 
study.  As part of his or her responsibilities, the coordinating principal investigator will review 
the final CSR.  Agreement with the final CSR will be documented by the dated signature of the 
coordinating pr incipal investigator.  
10.2. Accountability, Handling, and Disposal of Study Drug  
The investigator is responsible for drug accountability at the study site; however, some of the 
drug accountability duties may be assigned to an appropriate pharmacist or other desi gnee.  
Inventory and accountability records must be maintained and readily available for inspection by 
the study monitor and are open to inspection at any time by any applicable regulatory authorities.  
The investigator or designee must maintain records th at document:

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  • Subject use of the study drug including pill or unit counts fro m each supply 
dispensed.  
The investigational product must be used only in accordance with the Protocol.  The investigator 
will also maintain records adequately documenting that the subjects were provided the specified 
study drug.  These records should incl ude dates, quantities, and any available batch or serial 
numbers or unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product and study subjects.  
Completed accountability records will be archived by the site.  The investigator or designee will 
be expecte d to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially used containers of study drug 
until verified by the study monitor (unless otherwise agreed to by the sponsor).  At the 
conclusion of the study, the investigator or designee will oversee shipment of an y remaining 
study drug back to the sponsor or its designee for destruction according to institutional standard 
operating procedures.  If local procedures mandate on -site destruction of investigational supply, 
the site should (where local procedures allow) maintain the investigational supply until the study 
monitor inspects the accountability records in order to evaluate compliance and accuracy of 
accountability by the investigative site.  At sites where the study drug is destroyed before 
monitor inspection,  the monitors rely on documentation of destruction per the site SOP.  
10.3. Data Management  
Data management will be performed in a validated database via an EDC system.  All data entry, 
verification, and validation will be performed in accordance with the current  standard operating 
procedures of the Data Management Department at the sponsor or its designee.  The database 
will be authorized for lock once all defined procedures are completed.  
The investigator will be provided with access to an EDC system so that an eCRF can be 
completed for each subject.  Entries made in the eCRF must be verifiable against source 
documents; if updates to the database are not possible, any discrepancies should be explained 
and documented.  The investigator will be responsible for revi ewing all data and eCRF entries, 
and will sign and date the designated forms in each subject's eCRF, verifying that the 
information is true and correct.  The investigator is responsible for the review and approval of all 
query responses.  
Protocol deviation s will be identified and recorded in the Protocol Deviation form of the eCRF.  
The study monitor will reference the Monitoring Plan in order to ensure that each issue identified 
is appropriately documented, reported, and resolved in a timely manner in acco rdance with the 
plan's requirements.  
10.4. Data Privacy and Confidentiality of Study Records  
The investigator and the sponsor or its designee must adhere to applicable data protection  laws 
and regulations.  The investigator and the sponsor or its designee are re sponsible for ensuring 
that sensitive  personal  information is ha ndled in accordance with local data protection laws 
(including but not limited to  HIPAA  and GDPR ) as applicable .  Appropriate consent for 
collection, use and disclosure and/or transfer (if app licable) of personal  information must be

subject's initials (subject's initials will only be recorded if  allowable by local regulations) will be 
recorded in the eCRF, where permitted; if the subject's name app ears on any other document 
(eg, laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to the 
sponsor or its designee.  Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in accordance with  
appropriate technical and organizational measures as required by  local data protection laws.  The 
subjects will be informed that representatives of the sponsor or its designee, IRB or IE C, or 
regulatory authorities may inspect their medical records to verify the information collected, and 
that all personal information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence 
and in accordance with local data protection laws.  
10.5. Financial Disclosure  
Before study initiation, all clinical investigators participating in clinical studies subject to FDA 
Regulation Title 21 CFR Part 54 – Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators (ie, "covered 
studies") are required to submit a completed Clinical Investigator Financial Disclosure form that 
sufficiently details any financial interests and arrangements that apply.  For the purpose of this 
regulation, "clinical investigator" is defined as any investigator or subinvestigator who is d irectly 
involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects, including the spouse and each 
dependent child of the clinical investigator or subinvestigator.  These requirements apply to both 
US and foreign clinical investigators conducting covered clinical studies.  
Any new clinical investigators added to the covered clinical study during its conduct must also 
submit a completed Investigator Financial Disclosure Form.  During a covered clinical study, 
any changes to the financial information previous ly reported by a clinical investigator must be 
reported to the sponsor or its designee.  At the conclusion of the covered clinical study, the 
clinical investigators will be reminded of their obligations.  In the event that the clinical 
investigator is not reminded, they nevertheless will remain obligated to report to the sponsor or 
its designee any changes to the financial information previously reported, as well as any changes 
in their financial information for a period of 1 year after completion of the co vered clinical study.  
10.6. Publication Policy  
By signing the study Protocol, the investigator and his /her institution agree that the results of the 
study may be used by the sponsor, Incyte Biosciences International  Sàrl (Incyte), for the 
purposes of national an d international registration, publication, and information for medical and 
pharmaceutical professionals.  Study results will be published in accordance with applicable 
local and national regulations.  If necessary, the authorities will be notified of the i nvestigator's 
name, address, qualifications, and extent of involvement.  The terms regarding the publication of 
study results are contained in the agreement signed with the sponsor or its designee.  A signed 
agreement will be retained by the sponsor or its  designee.  
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings.  If this is foreseen, 
the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor before submission.  
This allows the sponsor to protect proprietar y information and to provide comments.  
The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results.  In accordance 
with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will generally support publication of

coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement.  
Authorship will be determined in line with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
authorship requirements and t he sponsor's internal publication guidelines.  
10.7. Study and Site Closure  
The sponsor or designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor.  Study sites will be closed upo n study 
completion.  A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies 
have been collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.  
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is rea sonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are 
not limited to:  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the Protocol, t he requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines.  
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator.  
• Discontinuation of further study treatment development.

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX  A. INFORMATION REGARDIN G EFFECTIVENESS OF 
CONTRACEPTIVE METHOD S 
For Subjects Participat ing in the Study:  
The following methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used 
consistently and correctly are considered as highly effective birth control methods.  
Such methods include:  
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen contai ning) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation1 
− oral 
− intravaginal  
− transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation1 
− oral 
− injectable  
− implantable2 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)2 
• Intraute rine hormon e-releasing system ( IUS)2 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion2 
• Vasectomized  partner2,3 
• Sexual abstinence4 
 
1  Hormonal  contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the IMP, which may reduce the efficacy of the 
contraception method.  
2  Contraception  methods that in the context of this guidance are  considered to have low user dependency.  
3  Vasectomised  partner is a highly effective method of avoiding pregnancy  provided that partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that th e vasectomized  partner has received medical assessment of the 
surgical success.  
4  In the context of this guidance, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments.  The 
reliability of sexual abstinenc e needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

Endocrinopathies  Note:   Subjects should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of 
hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency (including adrenal crisis), and  hyper - or 
hypothyroidism.  Subjects may present with fatigue, headache, mental status 
changes, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, and hypotension, or nonspecific 
symptoms which may resemble other causes such as brain metastasis or underlying 
disease.  Unless an alternate etiology has been identified, signs or symptoms of 
endocrinopathies should be considered immune -mediated.  
For Grade 2 (mild to moderate new symptoms):  
• In hypophysitis, treat with systemic corticosteroids , per institutional standard 
of care.  When symptoms improve to Grade  1 or less, steroid taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
Note:  These suggested supportive care measures a lso apply to Grade 3 
hypophysitis   
• In hyperthyroidism, nonselective beta -blockers (eg, propranolol) are suggested 
as initial therapy.  
• In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine 
or liothyronine, is indicated per standard of c are. 
Note:   Isolated hypothyroidism may be treated with replacement therapy 
without treatment interruption and without corticosteroids.  
• Evaluate endocrine function and, as clinically indicated, consider pituitary 
scan.  
• For subjects with abnormal endocrine work -up, except for those with isolated 
hypothyroidism, consider short -term, high -dose c orticosteroids 
(eg, methylprednisolone or IV equivalent) and initiate appropriate hormone 
replacement therapy.  
• For subjects with normal endocrine work -up (labs or MRI),  repeat labs/MRI as 
clinically indicated.  
For Grade 3 or 4 (severe or new symptoms, new/worsening  endocrinopathies , 
life threatening):  
• Hypothyroidism may be treated with replacement therapy without treatment 
interruption and without corticosteroids.  
• In hyperthyroidism, t reat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by 
oral corticosteroids.  Consider initiation of systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 
1-2 mg/kg per day of prednisone or equivalent, and initiate appropriate 
hormone replacement the rapy.   Once improving, gradually taper 
immunosuppressive steroids over ≥ 4 weeks.  
• In hypophysitis, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by oral 
corticosteroids.  When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper 
should be started  and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  Replacement of 
appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
• For adrenal crisis, severe dehydration, hypotension, or shock:   immediately 
initiate intravenous corticosteroids with mineralocor ticoid activity.  
• Consult endocrinologist.  
• Consult medical monitor.

DOCUMENT HISTORY  
Document  Date  
Amendment (Version) 1 : 12 JUN 2017  
Amendment (Version) 2 : 22 AUG 2017  
Amendment (Version) 3:  18 DEC 2017  
Amendment (Version) 4:  24 OCT 2018  
Amendment (Version) 5:  22 JAN 2021  
Amendment 5 ( 22 JAN 2021 ) 
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to provide guidance for the management of ongoing 
subjects, as enrollment is complete and sufficient data have been collected for primary and 
secondary endpoint analysis.  
1. Synopsis; Section 5.5.1, Withdrawal Criteria; Section 5.5.2, Withdrawal 
Procedures; Section 6, Study Assessments  (Table 1 0:  Schedule of Clinical 
Assessments); Section 6.3, End of Treatment; Section  6.4.1, Safety Follow -Up; 
Section 6.4.2, Disease Status Follow -Up; Section  6.4.3, Survival Follow -Up; 
Section  7.5, Poststudy Anticancer Therapy Status; Section  7.7.1. 1.3, Imaging During 
Follow -Up; Section 7.11.2, Data Collection for Survival Follow -Up 
Descrip tion of change:   Disease status and survival follow -up data will only be collected 
until the last safety follow -up visit.   Safety follow -up visits will only include AE and 
concomitant medication assessments.  
Rationale for change:  To update the study asses sments as enrollment is complete and 
all ongoing subjects have  either been on study treatment for more than 15 months or are 
in follow -up after treatment discontinuation (for any of the treatment withdrawal criteria 
outlined in Section  5.5). 
2. Section 10.1.1 , Identification of the Coordinating Principal Investigator; 
Section  10.6, Publication Policy ; Section 10.7, Study and Site Closure  
Description of change:   Included the  process for  identification of the coordinating 
principal investigator  and for study and  site closure.  Clarified the policy for study 
publications.  
Rationale for change:  To update applicable sections as per current protocol template . 
3. Incorporation of administrative changes:  Other minor administrative changes have 
been incorporated throughout the Protocol to correct inadvertent inconsistencies or 
improve the readability and are noted in the redline version of the amendment.

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -201 Am 5  Version 5  22 JAN 2021  
VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  • Other relevant sections were updated accordingly and are noted in the redline version 
of the amendment.  
Rationale for change:   A large proportion of patients fail to respond to anti –PD-1 
treatmen t; there are very limited remaining treatment options available.  Combining an 
anti-GITR and an anti –PD-1 treatment may synergistically restore T -cell activation, 
enhance antitumor immunity, and overcome the resistance of tumors to the PD -1 therapy.  
3. Synops is; Section 3.1, Subject Inclusion Criteria  
Description of change:   Addition of a note to inclusion criterion 6c that subjects with 
SCCHN enrolled in Stage 2 of the Phase 2 portion of the study should have progressive 
disease during or within 6 months afte r their platinum -based therapy.  
Rationale for change:  To more closely define the SCCHN population to be enrolled in 
Stage 2 of the Phase 2 portion of the study . 
4. Synopsis; Section 4.3.1, Planned Number of Subjects  
Description of change:   The total number of subjects to be enrolled in the Phase  2 
portion of the study was updated to reflect changes made  to the subject population 
(ie, addition of subjects with PD -1 refractory SCCHN to Treatment Group F) in the Phase 
2 portion of the study.  
Rationale for change:   The sample size is guided by the Simon 2 -stage design for 
cervical, gastric, SCCHN, and PD -1/L-1 relapsed melanoma tumor types within a given 
doublet or triplet treatment group and Simon 2 -stage design with an expansion stage for 
the PD-1 refractory SCCHN cohort in Treatment G roup F.  
5. Synopsis; Section 5.2.2, Standard Immune Therapies  
Description of change:   Update in the infusion times for nivolumab and ipilimumab.  
Rationale for change:   Following recent updates to the recommended infusion times for 
nivolumab and ipilimumab in their respective package inserts, the recommended infusion 
times of nivolumab and ipilimumab have been updated in this study to allow for more 
flexibility with res pect to nivolumab/ipilimumab infusion times as per the respective 
package inserts or institutional guidelines.  
6. Section 1.5.2.5, Subjects With Melanoma Who Have Relapsed After Prior 
Treatment With an Anti –PD-1 or Anti –PD-L1 Therapy  
Description of change:  Reference to melanoma subjects has been added to this section.  
Rationale for change:   Reference to subjects with melanoma has been made to clarify 
that this section describes the rationale for inclusion of melanoma subjects who have 
relapsed after prior tre atment with an anti –PD-1 or anti –PD-L1 therapy.  
7. Section 3.1, Inclusion Criteria; Section 7.10.1, Tumor Biopsies  
Description of change:  Updated the requirements for the amount of previously collected 
formalin -fixed paraffin embedded baseline tumor tissue m aterial.  
Rationale for change:   To allow for more flexibility with respect to the amount of 
available previously collected baseline tumor tissue material required for eligibility.

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -201 Am 5  Version 5  22 JAN 2021  
VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  8. Synopsis; Section 4.1, Overall Study Design; Section 5.2, Study Drugs ; Section 6, 
Study Assessments; Section  7.10.1.1, Tumor Tissue Collection Requirements  
Description of change:   Section 4.1 was updated to include the following changes; other 
relevant sections were updated accordingly.  
• The Phase 2 subject population was up dated to remove endometrial cancer, 
include cervical cancer, and include PD -1 or PD -L1 relapsed melanoma.  
• Language was added to allow for alternate dose administration schedules and/or 
fixed doses of INCAGN01876 comparable to or less than the highest dose levels 
determined to be safe or pharmacologically active in the Phase 2 portion of the 
study.  
• Figure 1 (Overall Study Design) was updated to reflect changes made to the 
subject population and treatment groups.  
• Treatment Group G (run -in with INCAGN01876 × 2  doses followed by 
monotherapy nivolumab) and Treatment Group K (run -in with INCAGN01876 × 
2 doses followed by nivolumab + ipilimumab) were removed from the study.  
Treatment Group E was updated from sequenced INCAGN01876 × 2 doses 
followed by nivolumab an d ipilimumab to a run -in with INCAGN01876 × 
2 doses followed by INCAGN01876 concurrent with nivolumab and ipilimumab.  
• A new Treatment Group C2 (INCAGN01876 + ipilimumab) was added to the 
Phase 2 portion of the study.  
Rationale for change:   The rationale fo r the subject population and fixed dosing are 
described above.  
Removal of Treatment Groups G and K and revision of Treatment Group E to sequenced 
INCAGN01876 × 2 doses followed by concurrent nivolumab and ipilimumab dosing is 
based on emerging clinical and  translational data from the Phase 1 portion of the study.  
Data thus far have not shown sufficient clinical responses or meaningful translational 
changes in immune markers for subjects enrolled in Treatment Group B.  However, a 
clinical response and chang es in immune markers were observed in Treatment Group A 
(concurrent dosing).  Therefore, treatment groups investigating sequential monotherapy 
dosing schedule will no longer be explored in the Phase 2 portion of the study.  
Treatment Group C (INCAGN01876 + ipilimumab) will be expanded in the Phase 2 
portion of the study (as Treatment Group C2).  This is based on emerging clinical and 
translational data from the Phase 1 portion of the study showing clinical responses and 
meaningful translational changes in im mune markers for subjects enrolled in Treatment 
Group  C.

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  13. Section 8.1, Adverse Events  
Description of change:  Clarification was provided regarding reporting of AEs related to 
study disease and/or disease progression.  Adverse events related to study disease or 
disease progression should not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is considered more 
severe than expected for the participant's condition or considered to be treatment -related 
by the investigator.  Additionally, efficacy endpoints as outlined in Section 2.2 will not 
be reported as AE/SAEs, specifically, any event that is related to disease progression of 
the cancer under study.  
Rationale for change:   The original Protocol language was not clear regarding reporting 
of AEs r elated to study disease or disease progression.  
14. Incorporation of administrative changes:   Other minor administrative typographical 
changes have been incorporated throughout the Protocol and are noted in the redline 
version of the amendment.

VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 2 (2 2 AUG 2017)  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to  address clinical trial application review comments 
from the Belgian and Spanish regulatory agencies.  
1. Section 3.1, Subject Inclusion Criteria  
Description of change:   In inclusion criterion 9,  clarification was provided that men and 
women of childbearing potential must take appropriate precautions to avoid pregnancy 
from screening through the safety follow -up period, or as required in the nivolumab and 
ipilimumab pack age insert, whichever is longer.  
Rationale for change:   The Protocol only addressed contraceptive measures that should 
be adopted for the investigational product INCAGN01876 but did not include 
contraceptive measures for the combination drugs nivolumab and  ipilimumab .  
2. Section 5.4.1, Dose Modifications; Section 7.6, Safety Assessments  
Description of change:  Clarification was added that subject safety management 
guidelines as outlined within the respective package inserts for nivolumab and 
ipilimumab should  be followed as appropriate.  
Rationale for change:  To ensure that the approved safety management guidelines for 
nivolumab and ipilimumab are being followed.  
3. Section 6, Study Assessments (Table 10, Schedule of Clinical Assessments); 
Section  7.6.4, Electroc ardiograms  
Description of change:  A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be collected every 
8 weeks during the treatment period.  Additional 12 -lead ECGs may be performed as 
clinically indicated to manage subject safety.  
Rationale for change:  Per the package insert  for nivolumab in Europe, continuous 
monitoring for cardiac adverse reactions  is recommended when nivolumab is given in 
combination with ipilimumab.  
4. Section 7.6.5.1, Pregnancy Testing  
Description of change:  Clarification was provided regarding when urine pregnancy 
testing would be medically indicated (eg, in case of loss of menstrual cycle or when 
pregnancy is suspected), as well as how country -specific requirements for urine 
pregnancy testing would be communicated to investigational s ites. 
Rationale for change:   To clarify when additional urine pregnancy testing would be 
considered medically indicated and how additional urine pregnancy testing requirements 
will be communicated to investigational sites.  
5. Incorporation of administrative c hanges:   Other minor administrative typographical 
changes have been incorporated throughout the Protocol and are noted in the redline 
version of the amendment.

Protocol INCAGN 1876 -201 Am 5  Version 5  22 JAN 2021  
VV-CLIN -000577  CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 1 (12 JUN 2017)  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  
The primary purpose of this amend ment is to  update the sponsor name and address to Incyte 
Biosciences International Sàrl.   
1. Title Page; Document Headers; Section 10.6, Publication Policy  
Description of change:  The name and address of the sponsor were updated from Incyte 
Europe Sàrl to I ncyte Biosciences International Sàrl . 
Rationale for change:  The corporate entity Incyte Europe Sàrl will be merged into 
Incyte Biosciences International Sàrl . 
2. Synopsis; Section 2.1.2, Secondary Objectives; Section 2.2.2, Secondary Endpoints; 
Section 9.4.1 .2, Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
Description of change:  Added secondary objective and defined endpoint of disease 
control rate.  
Rationale for change:   Disease control rate can be an important measure of therapeutic 
activity.  
3. Synopsis; Section 3.1, Subject Inclusion Criteria; Section 4.1, Overall Study Design; 
Section 7.10.1.1, Tumor Tissue Collection Requirements  
Description of change:  Clarification was added to specify that only subjects with 
mucosal or cutaneous melanoma will be enrolled.  Additionally, alternative tumor types 
not listed may be allowed to enroll with approval of the medical monitor.   
Rationale for change:  As described in Section 1.5.1 of the Protocol, tumor types that 
have demonstrated clinical responses following blockage of immune checkpoint 
inhibitors were included in Part 1 of the study.  As data in subjects treated with immune 
modulators continues to emerge, the list of indications provided in the Protocol may not 
be comprehensive; therefore, tumor types not listed may be allowed following review of 
the medical monitor.  
4. Synopsis; Section 3.2, Subject Exclusion Criteria  
Description of change:  The labor atory exclusion criterion for total bilirubin was 
updated to exclude subjects with total bilirubin ≥ 1.2 × ULN.  
Rationale for change:  As the safety of novel combination s of immune therapies are 
being assessed in this study, only subjects with sufficient l iver function should be 
enrolled into this Phase 1/2 study.  
5. Synopsis; Section 4.1, Overall Study Design  
Description of change:  Added language to allow flexibility  in prioritizing enrollment to 
specific treatment groups or cohorts.  
Rationale for change:   Allows the sponsor and investigational sites to prioritize more 
promising treatment groups or cohorts (or deprioritize less promising treatment groups or 
cohorts) based on emerging data.

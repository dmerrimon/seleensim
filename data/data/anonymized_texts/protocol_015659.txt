MYO-0709: A Prospective , Non-Randomized , Unblinded Study Evaluating the Treatment with the Cryo-
Touch III Device For Upper Limb Spasticity  
1. Introduction  
1.1. Background  
Spasticity, common in neurological disorders, is part of the upper motor neuron 
syndrome displaying increased tone, clonus, spasms, spastic dystonia and co -
contractions.  The impact of spasticity on the patient varies from a subtle 
neurological sign to severe spasticity  causing pain and contractures.  Upper limb 
spasticity  (ULS) is the rapid contraction or shortening of the muscles in the arm  
causing abnormal muscle movements in the elbow, wrist and fingers . It has been 
reported that over 1 million Americans with traumatic injury to the brain or spinal 
cord, stroke, multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy  experience ULS .  Tightly 
clenched fist s, twisted wrist  and elbow joint s, and fixed  arms in flexed positions 
result in extreme discomfort, pain and spasm.   A nonsurgical, minimally invasive , 
effective approach to pain associated with ULS is desirable . 
Myoscience , Inc. (Redwood City, C A) has developed a pain management  device 
– the Cryo-Touch III – for a novel, minimally invasive procedure  using focused 
cold therapy to target sensory nerve tissue and offer long -lasting pain relief  
through cryoanalgesia .  The device operates on the well -established cryobiology 
principle that lo calized exposure to controlled , moderately low temperature 
conditions can alter tissue function.  The therapy treats nerves via a probe in the 
form of an asse mbly of small diameter needles, creating a highly localized , low 
temperature  treatment zone around the probe.   This focused cold therapy creates a 
conduction block that prevents nerve signaling.  Prior studies of the Cryo-Touch, 
Cryo-Touch II, Cryo-Touch III (a.k.a. PCP 1.0) devices have provided 
preliminary evidence of effectiveness  on motor nerves  and have been shown to be 
safe with no serious  device-related adverse events.   
1.2. Device Description  
The Cryo-Touch III Device  (a.k.a. PCP 1.0)  (Figure 1) is a minimally invasive 
needle-based device. The device consists of a re -usable portable C ontrol Unit, 
Handpiece, single use Cryoprobes (Fig ure 2) and Cryogen Cartridges. The 
Control Unit and Handpiece are powered by the Control Unit utilizing connection 
to a standard power outlet .  The system is microprocessor controlled. Its 
functionality is driven by an op erator controlled on/off switch. Th e unit displays 
indicator lights to guide the operator.  
The system produces the desired effects through initiation of a cooling cycle. 
Each cooling cycle is initiated by subcutaneous insertion of the Cryoprobe into 
the selected site and activation of the cryogen flow. A freezing zo ne forms around 
the tip of the C ryoprobe and the adjacent tissue. The Cryogen Cartridges are 
provided in individually sealed pouches. Each cartridge contains a nitrous oxide 
cylinder encased with a safety cap and filter.

The Cryoprobes are supplied in sterile packaging and are single -patient use. The 
Cyroprobe tips are closed,  therefore no cryogen enters the insertion site. A skin 
warmer provides warming at the base o f the Cryoprobe tips to keep the  skin 
surface above freezing temperatures.

Touch III Device For Upper Limb Spasticity  
2.6.2.2. Treatment  
The Cryo-Touch III Device will have been pre pared by the trained 
investigator (or Sponsor designee) according to the Instructions for Use 
(IFU) as provided by myoscience  (see supplementary material ). 
Representatives of myoscience may be present at the treatment. 
Photography and videography m ay be captured during the treatment .  
Varying t reatment algorithms will be pre -determined by the sponsor and 
placed into cohorts as appropriate for analysis.  This is intended to 
determine the most effective method of treatment and to optimize the 
algorithm .  Algorithms may include the following parameters: length of 
treatment, number of treatment cycles, probe tip design, and probe length.  
If at any time the device does not perform as expected , the investigator (or 
designee) will follow procedures as outlined in the IFU.  
2.6.2.3. Post-Treatment  
Upon completion of treatment, the t reatment area will be cleansed and the 
skin will be left undressed.   Pressure to the treatment area with gauze for 
5-10 minutes may be applied to minimize bleeding.  The subject will be 
instructed in post -treatment care.   
The subject will be instructed to report any adverse events or treatment 
side effects (e.g., excessive redness, swelling, bruising, soreness, altere d 
sensation, etc.) to the investigator  between and at follow -up visits.  Non-
invasive ultrasound may be used to assess the volume and location of the 
soft tissue treated below the dermis.  Photography and /or videography 
may be obtained.  
The subject will b e scheduled and instructed regarding  their follow -up 
visits and discharged from the clinic.  
2.6.3. Visit 3/ Maintenance  (Day 7) & Visit 4/Maintenance (Day 30)  
Subject will be evaluated  and data collected per the schedule of events .  
(Appendix B). Any changes in concomitant medications/concurrent 
procedures will be assessed.  Any anticipated observations, adverse events, 
and/or SAE/UADE of the previous treatment site(s) will be documented and 
accessed.  Non-invasive ultrasound imaging of the treatme nt area may be 
captured.  Photography may be taken of the treatment area.  
2.6.4. Visit 5/Study Exit (Day 56) – Telephone Follow -Up 
Subject will be contacted via telephone and data collected since the last visit  
per the schedule of events .  Any changes in concomitant 
medications/concurrent procedures will be assessed.  Any anticipated

MYO-0709: A Prospective , Non-Randomized , Unblinded Study Evaluating the Treatment with the Cryo-
Touch III Device For Upper Limb Spasticity  
observations, adverse events, and/or SAE/UADE of the previous trea tment 
site(s) will be documented .  
If the treatment  effect remains  at Day 56 , the subject will  be followed every 
four (4) weeks via telephone until there is no longer an y effect noted, up to a 
total of 112 days post -treatment .  Any clinically significant adverse event  will 
be followed until resolution. The subject will exit the study once there are no 
longer treatment effect s and no ongoing clinically significant events.  
Study exit data will be collected and the subject reminded to contact the 
investigator if any new , previously unreported event occurs related to the 
treatment.  
A subject is considered to have exited the study after completing all 
scheduled visits.  In the event  that a subject does not attend a scheduled visit , 
every effort will be made to reschedule.  In the event of a subject lost to 
follow-up, study exit form will be completed and efforts documented.  
 
If a subject decides to withdraw  participation early, the subject will be 
requested to complet e a final study visit and exit  the study.  The investigator 
or sponsor may at any time during the study remove a subject if there is any 
potential safety issue or non-compliance.  In all cases , every attempt will be 
made to complete a final study visit.  
3. Outcome Measures and Assessments  
Outcome measures will be assessed  around multiple endpoints.  These measures will be: 
pain, duration of improvement,  anticipated observations, and safety. Additional  
assessments may also be taken but are not considered part of the analysis (i.e. subject 
post-treatment questionnaire).  The specific assessment tools, collection method and time 
points are listed  herein.   
3.1.1. Primary Outcome Measure  
A decrease in hypertonia  as measured by a n improvement  of 1 point or 
greater in the Modified Ashworth Scale  at Day 7. 
Hypertonia  will be assessed at each study time period using the Modified 
Ashworth Scale .  Assessment will be conducted by the same Investi gator at 
each time point to reduce int er-assessment variation.  
3.1.2. Secondary Outcome Measures    
1. Improvement in spasticity as measured by the Tardieu Scale :  Subjects will 
undergo the Tardieu test to assess spasticity (verses stiffness ) at each 
study visit.

2. Improvement in spasm frequency and intensity as m easured by the Penn 
Spasm Score:  Subjects experiencing spasm of the upper extremity will be 
assessed usin g the Penn Spasm Frequency  Scale at each study visit.  
 
3. Improvement in upper extremity motor recovery as measured by the Fugl -
Meyer Scale ( post stroke subjects only):  Subjects who have spasticity due 
to stroke will be assessed using the Fugl -Meyer – Motor Recovery after 
Stroke Scale at each study visit.  
 
4. Subject assessed change in Mean Spasticity Num erical Rating Scale 
(NRS) Score:  Subjects w ill be asked "On a scale of '0 to 10' please 
indicate the average level of your spasticity over the last 24 hours" with 
the anchors: 0 = 'no spasticity' and 10 = 'worst possible spasticity'.  'No 
spasticity' is explained as  the time prior to the onset of their s pasticity.  
 
5. Improvement in pain as assessed  by visual analogue scale (VAS):  
Subjects will be shown a number scale and six facial expressions 
suggesting various pain intensities.  The subject will be asked to choose 
the face that best describes how they f eel.  The far left face indicates ‘No

3.1.5. Safety Measures  [Data Collection]  
Adverse events and SAEs/UADEs will be assessed at all visits.  Incidence of 
serious adverse events (SAEs) and unanticipated adverse device effects 
(UADEs) will be recorded.   
3.2. Adverse Event  Reporting   
 
All adverse events, regardless of seriousness, severity,  or relationship to device, will 
be recorded and evaluated by the Investigator.  The evaluation will include a 
determination of the seriousness and severity of the event, whether the event or the 
severity of the event was anticipated or unanticipated, and the relationship of the 
event to the study device.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined according to ISO14155:2003 (section 
3.19) as any adverse event that:  
▪ Led to a death  
▪ Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that  
• resulted in a  life-threatening illness or injury  
• resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body 
function 
• required in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization  
• resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent 
impairment to body structure or a body function  
▪ Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
An unanticipated adverse device (UADE) effect is defined in 21 CFR 812.3 as any 
serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary  plan or application), 
or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to 
the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
Events NOT considered t o be serious adverse events are :  
1) Hospitalizations for the treatment, which wa s elective or pre -planned, of a pre -
existing condition that did not worsen ; and,  
2) Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of 
the definitions of “serious” given above and not resulting in hospital admission.  
Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects will be 
reported by the Investigator to myoscience within 24 hours and to the Institutional

1. PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  
 
1.1 Synopsis  
 
Title:  Bone  Marrow  Mesenchymal  Stem  Cell Derived  Extracellular  Vesicles  Infusion 
Treatment for COVID -19 Associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome 
(ARDS): A Phase II Clinical Trial  
Study 
Description:  ExoFloTM Infusion Treatment for COVID -19 Associated  ARDS (EXIT  
COVID -19), a multicenter,  double -blinded,  placebo -controlled,  randomized 
control trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety in COVID -19 associated 
moderate to severe ARDS.  
Objectives:  To evaluate  the safety  and efficacy  of intravenous  (IV) administration  of bone 
marrow mesenchymal stem cell derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), ExoFlo, 
versus placebo as treatment for COVID -19 associated moderate -to-severe 
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).  
Endpoints:  Primary  Endpoi nt: 
1) Improvement in partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired 
oxygen (PaO 2/FiO 2) ratio from pre -infusion baseline (Day 0) to Day 7. 
PaO 2 may be calculated  from  arterial  blood  gas (ABG)  or imputed  from  the 
SpO 2 daily (                         ). 
Note:  Day 0 is designated  as Day of Screening  and Day 1 as Day of the First 
Study Intervention.  Patients may  be screened and treated within the same  24 
hours—in this scenario, Day 1 will  be synonymous with Day 0 & the pre - 
infusion value used will be from Day 1 . 
Secondary  Endpoints:  
2) Time to recovery as defined by the number of days from the first study 
treatment  until return  of oxygenation  saturation  (SpO2)  ≥ 93% on room  air 
(or PaO2/FiO2  ≥ 300 mmHg).  If patient  has chronic  lung disease,  recovery 
is defined as pre -COVID -19 SpO2 and O2 support.  
3) Incidence  of serious  adverse  events.  
4) All-cause  mortality. 
Exploratory  Endpoints:  
5) Viremia:  qualitative  serum  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  coronavirus 2 
(SARS -CoV -2) ribonucleic  acid (RNA)  load on Days  0 or 1, 15, 29, and 61. 
6) Acute phase reactants: C -reactive protein (CRP), D -dimer, Ferritin, 
interleukin -6 (IL-6), tumor  necrosis  factor  alpha  (TNF -α) on Days  1, 4, 7, 
10, 15, 29. CRP,  D-dimer,  & Ferritin  also on Day 0.

 7) Immune cell counts: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC); CD3+, CD4+, 
CD8+  thymus  cells also known  as T lymphocytes  (T cells);  natural  killer 
(NK) cells on Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 15, 29.  
8) Sequential  Organ  Failure  Assessment  (SOFA)  Score  on Days  1, 15, 29 for 
patients who are still hospitalized.  
9) Quality of life  (QOL) assessment for patients who are discharged.  EQ-5D- 
5L on Days 29 and 61.  See Appendix 11.2 for sample EQ -5D-5L, which 
includes  dimensions  of mobility,  self-care,  usual  activities,  pain/discomfort, 
and anxiety/depression.  
Study 
Population:  Up to 120 adult  male  and female  patients  between  18 and 85 years  of age 
hospitalized with COVID -19 associated ARDS.  
Phase:  Phase  II 
Site Number:  2-15 
Description  of 
Interventio n: Patients  will be randomized  to one of the following:  
Treatment  Arm 1: PLACEBO  Normal  saline  100 mL 
Treatment  Arm 2: IP (Exoflo)  10ml  dose in Normal  saline  90 mL, which  is 
approximately 800 billion EVs (Lot# P -441-1901 -E5, P-441-2004 -C5). 
Treatment  Arm 3: IP (Exoflo)  15ml  dose in Normal  saline  85 mL, which  is 
approximately 1.2 trillion EVs (Lot# P -441-1901 -E5, P-441-2004 -C5). 
The intervention  will be infused  over 60 minutes  on Day 1 and repeated  on Day 
4 provided that the patient has not recovered as defined by SpO2 ≥ 93% on RA 
or PaO2/FiO2 ≥ 300 mmHg. If patient has chronic lung disease, recovery is 
defined as baseline SpO2 and O2  support.  
Allocation  of 
Intervention:  Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to each of the three treatment arms initially. 
The Interactive Response Technology will notify the DSMB such that a safety 
and interim  analysis  can be held following  day 7 of the 60th patient  randomized.  
Duration:  Each  patient  will be enrolled  in the  study  for an estimated 60  days.

A: The number of  COVID -19 symptomatic days prior to the  current admission is recorded along with the  number 
of days from admission to first study administration.  
B: Patients  will be monitored  for 72 hours  as inpatients  following  each  study  intervention . Recovery  will be defined 
in the study  as SpO 2 reaching  ≥ 93%  on RA (or P/F ≥ 300 mm Hg) or pre-COVID -19 SpO 2 or O2 support  if patient has 
chronic lung disease.  
• Following  the first treatment  on Day  1, the patient  may  be discharged  on Day 4 or later.  
• Following  the second  treatment  on Day 4, the patient  may  be discharged  on Day 7 or later.  
• If a patient  received  the first but not the second  treatment,  he/she  may  be discharged  prior  to Day 7. 
• Following  patient’s  discharge,  no labs will be drawn.  Follow -up via phone -call only  on Days  29 and 61. 
C: During the infusion, measurements +/ - 2 minutes of specified times for q5min vitals and +/ - 5 minutes of 
specified times for q15min vitals are considered permissible; following the infusion, vital sign measurements are 
permissible +/ -15 minutes of the spec ified times.  Temperature is required only 5 minutes prior and q15min 
during the course of the infusion.  
D: Serum  pregnancy  test (in women  of childbearing  potential)  will be obtained  on Day 0.  Urine  dipstick  obtained  
on Day 1 at 4 hours prior to the first s tudy treatment if >24 hours passed since the serum pregnancy test.  
E: Not all patients who recovered will receive a repeat study intervention.  Patients who recovered by Day 4 do 
not receive a repeat study intervention.  
F: Qualitative SARS -CoV-2 RT PCR will  be used for Day 0 or 1 (prior to the first dose),  15, 29, 61.  If there is a 
shortage of tests, documentation of positive test within 14 days prior to admission suffices for Day 0 or 1.  
G: SOFA  Score  will be administered  only  if patient  is still hospitalized.  
H: ED-5D-5L score  will be administered  over  the phone  only  if patient  is discharged . Note:  This is not a meaningful 
measure for patients who are still hospitalized due to common use of IV sedatives or PO antipsychotics for 
delirium.  A baseline prior to study infusion is not obtained because the patient is hypoxic, and the hospital staff 
needs to prioritize di agnostics and treatment rather than time -consuming quality of life metric.  
I: The Screen  column  refers  to tests  obtained  prior  to the first study  treatment,  usually  obtained  on Day  0, i.e., 24 
hours prior to the first study treatment. However,  height & wei ght, EKG, microbiology, and rule out tests do  not 
have to be repeated on Day 0 if obtained once following the current hospital admission . 
J: All lab tests  including SARS -CoV-2 viremia, standard tests, acute phase reactants, flow cytometry will be 
obtained  around  1-2 hours  prior  to the first study  treatment  on Day  1. On Day 1, SOFA  score  will be calculated on 
the morning values prior to the study treatment.

5. STUDY  POPULATION  
 
5.1 Inclusion  Criteria  
 
Eligibility  for study  enrollment  includes meeting  all of the following criteria:  
1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form (either by the individual or by the  
individual’s healthcare proxy).  
2. Stated  willingness  to comply  with all study  procedures  and availability  for the duration  of 
the study  
3. Male  or female  aged 18 -85. 
4. COVID -19 positive  as defined  by positive  Reverse  Transcriptase  Polymerase  Chain 
Reaction (RT -PCR) SARS -CoV -2. 
5. Moderate to severe ARDS as defined by modified Berlin definition, * which includes 
timing  within  1 week  of known  clinical  insult  or new or worsen ing respiratory  symptoms; 
bilateral  opacities  not fully  explained  by effusions,  or lung collapse;  respiratory  failure  not 
fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload; PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤ 200 mm Hg.  
6. Hypoxia requiring noninvasive oxygen support such as Nasal Cannula (NC), 
Nonrebreather (NRB), Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP), Continuous Positive 
Airway Pressure (CPAP), high flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC O2) or mechanical 
ventilation (MV) desp ite initiating standard of care.  
7. If the candidate is either a male or female of reproductive potential, he or she must agree 
to use of double barrier method of highly effective birth control contraception such as 
condoms with oral contraceptive pill or cho ose to remain abstinent if already practicing 
abstinence during the screening period. The required duration of usage of double barrier 
method OR maintenance of abstinence must include the time from the beginning of the 
screening period until 90 days follow ing the last dose of the study treatment.  
*Modified  Berlin  definition  used in this study  is the full Berlin  definition,  albeit  without  the PEEP 
specification,  which  implies  mechanical  ventilation.  
 
**To ensure flexible adaptation of products approved by the FDA for the treatment of severe 
COVID -19, standard of care is defined as the NIH Current COVID -19 Treatment Guidelines

Exclusion  from  study  enrollment  includes  meeting  one or more  of the following  criteria:  
1. Vulnerable populations such as pregnant patients, children, individuals with severe 
physical or mental disabilities who cannot provide meaningful consent.  
2. Active  malignancy  requiring  treatment  within  the last five years.  
3. Major physical trauma in the last 5 days, including motor vehicle accidents, assaults, 
mechanical falls with sequalae of significant bleeding or craniofacial bruising, and 
surgeries.  
4. Active  tuberculosis  or cystic  fibrosis.  
5. Severe  chronic  respiratory  diseas e including  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  or 
pulmonary fibrosis requiring home oxygen > 5L/min.  
6. Use of extracorporeal  membrane  oxygenation  (ECMO)  during  the current  hospitalization.  
7. Pre-existing  pulmonary  hypertension.  
8. Severe  pre-existing  hepatic  impairment  (presence  of cirrhosis,  liver function  tests (LFTs)  
≥ 6x baseline, INR  ≥ 2.0). 
9. Pre-existing  Chronic  Kidney  Disease  (CKD)  stage  IIIb or End Stage  Renal  Disease  (ESRD) 
prior to onset of COVID -19 (stage I, II, and IIIa are acceptable)  
10. Irreversible coagulopathy (e.g., frequently occluded vascular access despite 
anticoagulation, precipitous platelet drops concurrent with end -organ damage suggesting 
consumptive proces s) or irreversible bleeding disorder (e.g., frequent bleeding from 
vascular access, endotracheal tubes, and foley).  
11. Pneumonia clearly attributable to a non -COVID -19 related process, including aspiration 
pneumonia or pneumonia that is exclusively bacterial, or originating from a diagnosed 
alternative virus (e.g., influenza).  
12. Patients  who are not full code.  
13. Endotracheal  intubation duration  ≤ 24 hours.  
14. Moribund —expected  survival  < 24 hours.  
15. Severe  metabolic  disturbances  on presentation  (e.g.,  ketoacidosis,  pH < 7.3)

Safety Variables and Endpoints: The safety of TV -45070 (4% and 8% w/w ointment) will be assessed throughout 
the study by evalua ting adverse events, clinical safety laboratory test results, vital signs measurements, ECG and 
physical examination results, dermal irritation, and concomitant medication usage. Skin rashes or skin irritation in 
the area of ointment application will be ev aluated using a dermal irritation evaluation (modified Draize scale) at 
day1 (at 1hour [±30 minutes] after application of study drug), w eek 2, week 4, and w eek 8 for follow -up.
Tolerability Measures and Endpoints: The tolerability of TV -45070 (4% and 8% w/w ointment) will be assessed 
during the study using safety endpoints that also represent patients’ experience of treatment, such as skin rashes and 
skin irritation.
Pharmacokinetic Measures and Endpoints :Twoblood samples will be taken from each patient, following 2
weeks of treatment with either 4% or 8% w/ w TV-45070 ointment or matching placebo ointment ,to quantitate the 
concentration of TV -45070 in plasma. Patients will go to the study center after applying study drug at home so that 
the 2pharmacokinetic samples can be taken. The firstsample w ill be taken within approximately 1 to 4 hours after 
the dose of study drug in the morning and the second sample taken approximately 2 hours after collection of the first 
sample.The date and time of the morning dose and the date and exact time for each of the 2pharmacokinetic 
samples will be recorded. Plasma samples will be analyzed for TV -45070. Population pharmacokinetic parameters, 
such as CL/Fand V/F,following topical TV -45070 administration to patients with PHN ,will be estimated when the 
sparse data from this study arecombined with enriched pharmacokinetic data from other studies with topical TV -
45070. Clinically relevant covariates affecting the pharmacokinetic sof TV-45070 will be identified as data permit. 
These results will be reported separate lyfrom the main study results .
Pharmacodynamic Measures and Endpoints : Pharmacodynamic endpoints assessed during the study are the 
secondary efficacy endpoints change from baseline in maximal intensity of patients’ brush -evoked allodynia and 
change from baseline in maximal intensity of punctate-evoked hyperalgesia. Exploratory analyses , if performed,
may be reported separately from the main study results.
Pharmacogenomic Analyses :Two blood samples (approximately 10 mL total) for pharmacogenomic analyses will 
be taken from all patients at the screening visit . Patients who refuse to give these blood samples will be excluded 

Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
10from the study . One sample will be analyzed to identify the nucleotide (G or A ) underlying the R1150W 
polymorphism in the SCN9Agene and may identify whether there are any other sequence variants in the SCN9A
gene region . All samples will be retained for a maximum of 15 years after completion of the study  
 
A pharmacogenomic blood sample may be used to assess the polymorphisms of 
the CYP3A4and CYP2C19 genes. 
Depending on t he distribution of allelic variations for CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, 
these results may be incorporated as covariates in the current or future population pharmacokinetic analyses. 
 
 
 
General Design and Methodology: This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, 
placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 4% and 8% w/w TV -45070 ointment compared with 
placebo ointment applied topically and twice daily to the area of PHN pain for 4 weeks (days 1 through 28) in 
patients with PHN. For each patient, there will be a total of 6 visits to the study site and 1 telephone contact as 
follows:
screening period
visit 1: screening (up to 28 days before randomization/fir st administration of study drug )
washout phone contact (approximately 1 w eek after visit 1 for screening )
washout interval (if needed) of variable/flexible length during whi ch the patient will discontinue 
oral analgesic t herapy, topical pain therapy, and/or non -pharmacologic therapies before initiation 
of the baseline period (Appendix A ,Table2)
visit 2: baseline visit (day –10
)
baseline pain assessment period ( days –7 to –1; baseline pain score [average pain intensity score 
over this interval] obtained)
treatment period
visit 3: randomization (day 1 [this is the day after day –1 and the first day of study drug 
application])
visit 4: day 15 ±1, week 2
visit 5: day 29, week 4
follow-up period
visit 6: follow -
up (day 57±3) or early termination (ET)
The screening period consists of ascreening visit (informed consent and preliminary eligibility assessment are 
obtained); a w ashout phone contact during which eligibility based on l aboratory test results will be reviewed and, as 
needed, patients will be given instructions to washout (discontinue) oral analgesic or topical pain therapy; a washout 
interval (if needed) of variable/flexible length during which appropriate patients will discontinue oral analgesic
therapy,topical pain therapy , and/or non -pharmacologic therapies ; and a baseline pain assessment interval, when 
each eligible patient will be given an eDiary torecord pain intensity from days–10 to –1. (To allow  for training in
the use of eDiaries, patients will use eDiaries from day –10, but baseline pain assessment will be defined as the last 
7days prior to randomization, ie, calculated from the values recorded from d ays–7 through –1). 
During the baseline 

Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
11pain assessment interval, rescue medications for PHN pain will not be allow ed. Rescue medication will also not be 
allowed during the last 7 days of treatment. Starting with the baseline pain assessment interval, patients will use 
eDiariesto record pain ,using an 11 -pointNRS each morning (0700 ±2 hours) and evening (1900 ±2hours),and any 
rescue pain medication usage.  
 
At visit3 (day 1, randomization), visit 4 (day 15 ±1, week 2),and visit5 (day 29, week 4), the NPSI and the DSIS
will be administered ,and the results will be recorded. On the same visit days, the results of maximal intensity 
evoked allodynia and maxima l intensity evoked hyperalgesia w ill be recorded . The NePIQoL will be evaluated at 
visit3 and visit 5. The PGIC will be evaluated at visits 4 and 5. Efficacy measures are not collected at visit 6
(day57±3), except for ET visits.
At visit 1 (screening), the patient will identify the location of his/her most severe allodynia, and this location will be 
used for assessments at all subsequent visits . If allodynia or hyperalgesia is not present at screening, it will not be 
tested at subsequent visits . The inve stigator w ill establish normal sensa tion by using a standardized 1 -inch foam 
brush (light pressure just sufficient to bend the tip of the brush) to stroke an area of ski n that is unaffected by pain. 
The region of allodynia will then be mapped by applying b rush strokes moving from normal sk in toward the painful 
region. A felt-tip pen will be used to mark the point where sensation changes from normal to painful . This process 
will be repeated until 8 to 10 points are marked in a radial fashion to define the area of allodynia. 
The marks will 
then be conn ected with a continuous line. To assess the intensity of allodynia, the investigator w ill use the brush to 
perform 3 brush strokes within the mapped area of allodynia. The patient w ill then assess pain intensit y using an 
11-point NRS to answer the question “Please rate the intensity of pain caused by brushing the area of skin where 
0=not painful at all and 10= worst pain possible.” The pain will be rated for intensity (using the highest pain rating 
reported) both at prebrush testing and during application of the brush and recorded; additionally, the difference 
between the 2 scores will be calculated and recorded. 
In addition, at visit 1 (screening), the patient will identify the location of his/her most severe hy peralgesia, and this 
location will be used for assessme nts at all subsequent visits. To assess the intensity of punctate hyperalgesia, a 
Medipin will be applied in 3 successive applications to the area of skin identified at screening. 
The patient will then
assess the pain intensity using an 11 -point NRS to answer the question “Please rate the intensity of pain caused by 
application of the Medipinwhere 0=not painful at all and 10= worst pain possible.” The highest pain rating will be 
recorded.
Patients will be provided w ith acetaminophen ( TYLENOL®, McNeil Consumer Healthcare Division of 
McNEIL-PPC, Inc) as 325-mg tabletsin bottles of 100 tabletsand allowed to take 1 to 2 tablets per dose every 
6hours,as needed ,and up to 6tabletsor 1950mg per day (over a 24-hour period) for rescue relief of PHN pain . 
Rescue medication will be provided at the screening visit . Rescue medication compliance will be checked at all 
visits until used rescue medication is collected after the baseline pain assessment interval or atrandomization for 
patients not continuing in the study, at visit 5 ( day 29, week 4) for patients who complete the treatment period or at 
the ET visit for patients who prematurely discontinue study drug.
No other rescue medications will be provided or allow ed from the washout phone contact through visit 5 ( day 29, 
week 4) or the ET visit. Patients will not be permitted to use rescue medication during the baseline pain assessment 
interval (days –10 through –1) and during the final week of treatme nt (the 7-day period before visit 5). During the 
washout interval, rescue medication use (dates of use and dose taken) will be recorded as concomitant medication. 
During the baseline period and the treatment period, rescue medication use will be recorded using the eDiary.
At the randomization visit (visit 3, day 1), eligible patients will be randomly assigned via IRT in a 1:1:1 fashion to 
1of 3treatment groups: 4% w/w TV-45070 ointment, 8% w/w TV-45070 ointment, or placebo ointment . 

Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
12Randomization will be stratifi ed by test results of the pharmacogenomic sample collected at the screening visit 
(homozygous minor allele [positive, AA], heterozygous [positive, AG], and homozygous common allele [negative, 
GG]) for R1150W polymorphism in the SCN9Agene. The patient will be instructed on how to apply the study drug. 
Under study site staff supervision , the area affected by PHN pain will be carefully defined by mapping the area of 
pain,and dosing will be prescribed t o fully cover the affected area. 
Efficacy assessments of pain NRS , NPSI, NePIQoL ,and DSISscoreswill be conducted at visit 3 (day 1, 
randomization) to establish baseline measurements. The site staffwill apply the first dose of blinded study drug and 
the patient will record the date/time in the eDiary . Subsequent study drug applications will be performed by the 
patient at home. (If the affected area is not w ithin reach of application by the patient [such as the posterior thoracic 
region], the patient’s designated caregiver will apply the ointment, but the pati ent will record the time of application 
in the eDiary.) 
During the 4 -week treatment period, patients w ill apply double- blind study drug to the area of PHN pain twice daily
in the morning (0700 ±2 hours) and again in the evening (1900 ±2 hours) . The first dose of study drug will be 
applied at the clinic on day 1 (visit 3). Regardless of the clock time of the first dose application at visit 3, the 
evening dose for day 1 should be applied at 1900 ±2 hours. The last dose of study drug will be applied at home o n 
the evening of day 28 ,which is the day before visit 5 . In the event that the patient cannot keep the scheduled 
appointment on day 29, it is nevertheless important for the patient to stop dos ing on the evening of day 28. The 
morning and evening drug appl ications will be done after recording the response for the NRS pain score. At the start 
of the baseline pain assessment interval when the eDiary is provided, the eDiary will be used to record the NRS 
responses, PHN rescue medication use, and then, after randomization, the dates/times of study drug administration. 
Patients will return to the study site for visit 4 (day 15 ±1, week 2) and again for visit 5 (day 29, w eek 4). Routine 
efficacy evaluations (including pain NRS, NPSI, DSIS, and PGIC scores) and safety assessments will be done at 
visit 4 (day 15 ±1, week 2) and visit 5 (day 29, week 4). At visit 4 (day 15 ±1, w eek 2), 2 blood samples will be 
taken from each patient for pharmacokinetic analysis: the first sample within approximately 1 to 4 hours after the
dose of study drug in the morning and the second sample approximately 2 hours after collection of the first sample. 
The dates and times of the pharmacokinetic sample collections and time of the morning dose will be recorded.
At visit 5 (day 29,week 4), the efficacy evaluation NePIQoL will also be performed, and the eDiary will be 
collected along with the tubes of study drug and bottles of rescue medication. Patients will be instructed to return to 
their primary care physician to resume therapy deem ed appropriate for their PHN.
Fourweeks after visit 5, the patients who completed the double -blind treatment period w ill return to the study site 
for a follow-up(visit 6, day 57 ±3). Activities will include safety assessments for all patients.
Patients w ho prematurely discontinue st udy drug will have an ET visit within 2 w eeks after the last study drug 
administration . During the ET visit, the same activities will be conducted as those administered for follow-upat 
visit6, the eDiary and any unused study drug/rescue medication will be collected, and compliance checks will be 
performed. Any treatment -emergent adverse event or serious adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals 
until resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline; until the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional; 
or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made during the study period. 
For adverse event recording, the study period is defined for each patient as that tim e period from signature of the 
ICF through the end of the follow -up period, day 57 (±3). For patients who prematurely discontinue study drug and 
do not have a treatment -emergent adverse event or serious adverse event, the ET visit will be the last study visit.
Method of Blinding and Randomization: All tubes of the study drug will be identical, and the ointments will be 
indistinguishable. Patients, investigators, and all clinical study site staff will remain blinded to treatment assignment 
during the study. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned via interactive response technology (IRT) in a 1:1:1 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
13ratio to 4% w/ w TV-45070 ointment, 8% w/w TV-45070 ointment, or placebo ointment. Randomization will be 
stratified by the R1150W underlying genotype in the SCN9Agene: homozygous minor allele (positive, AA), 
heterozygous (positive, AG), and homozygous common allele (negative, GG).
Study Drug Dose, Mode of Administration, and Administration Rate: The study drug is double -blind TV-45070 
ointment (4% or 8% w /w) or placebo ointment for topical administration. Study drug will be applied tw ice daily to 
the painful area in the morning (0700 ±2 hours) and again in the evening (1900 ±2 hours) from days 1 through 28. 
Study drug will be applied at approximately 3 μL/cm2perapplication . The actual amount (mg of ointment) of study 
drug per application w ill be measured (as length of ointment) using one or more dosing cards based upon the area of 
pain determined at randomization (visit 3, day 1).
Investigational Product: TV-45070 ointment (4% or 8% w/w)
Reference Therapy:

16acetaminophen rescue. Permitted acetaminophen rescue con sisted of 325 mg tablets, in doses of up to 1 to 2 tablets 
per 6 hours as needed, up to 6 tablets per 24 hours.
Statistical Considerations: Patient demographic and baseline characteristics, including medical history, prior 
medications, and ECG findings, w ill be examined to assess the comparability of the treatment groups and will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (number [n], mean, standard 
deviation, standard error, median, minimum, and maximum) w ill be provided. For categorical variables, patient 
counts and percentages will be provided . 
The full analysis set (FAS) ,defined as all patients in the intent -to-treat (ITT) population (all patients randomly 
assigned to treatment) who receive at least 1 dose of study drug and have at least 1 post-baseline efficacy 
assessment, will beused for all efficacy analyses. Summaries w ill be presented by treatment group.
The primary efficacy variable, change from baseline to week 4 in the weekly average of the daily average NRS
scores, will be analyzed using a Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) with change from baseline in the 
weekly average of the daily average NRS scores at weeks 2 and 4 as the depend ent variable; visit in weeks, 
treatment, andtreatment by visit interaction as fixed factors ;baseline weekly average of the daily average NRS 
scoresas covariate; and patient as random effect. The unstructured covariance matrix for repeated observations
within patients will be used. The primary treatment comparison will be cond ucted at week 4 in this model. All tests
will be 2-sided at a significance level of 0.05. More details will be p rovided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.
All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) . Each patient 
will be counted only once in each preferred term or system organ class (SOC) category for the analyses of safety. 
Summaries will be presented for all adverse events (overall and by severity), adverse events determined by the 
investigator to be related to study treatment (ie, based on reasonable possibility; adverse events defined as related or 
with missing relationship will be summarized overall and by severity), serious adverse events, and adverse events 
causing withdraw al from study drug treatment and/or the study . Summaries will be presented by treatment group 
and for all patients . Patient listings of ser ious adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal will be 
presented.
Changes in laboratory and vital signs measurement data will be summarized descriptively . All values will be 
compared with prespecified boundaries to identify potentially clinically significant changes or values, and such 
values will be listed.
The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by therapeutic class using descriptive statistics . 
Concomitant medications will include all medications taken while the patient is tre ated with study drug.
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, standard error, median, minimum, and 
maximum) will be provided for actual values and changes from baseline to each time point. For categorical 
variables, p atient counts and percentages will be provided. Descriptive summaries of serious adverse events, patient 
withdrawals due to adverse events, and potentially clinically significant abnormal values (clinical laboratory or vital 
signs) based on predefined crit eria will also be provided.
The population pharmacokinetic analyses will be detailed in a population pharmacokinetic analysis plan for this 
study. Results will be reported separately from the main study results.
Sample Size Rationale: In prior studies of gabapentin or pregabalin treatment of PHN, the difference in mean pain 
scores betw een active -and placebo -treated groups ranged from 1.0 ( Rice et al 2001 ) to 1.3 (Dworkin et al 2003 ). 
For this decision -making, proof-of-concept study, it is reasonable to use a conservative estimate of 1.0. If we assume 
a standard deviation of 2.35, a sample size of up to approximately 88 per arm (a total of 264 patients) w ould be 
needed to provide 80% power with a 2 -sided test a t 5% significance level to detect a 1.0 -point difference. Assuming 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
17an approximately 20% dropout rate, 110 patients per arm (a total of 330 patients) w ill be randomly assigned to each 
treatment group. During the study, the ultimate sample size may be adjusted on the basis of the actual dropout rate.
Amendment 03: The primary reason for amendment 03 is to facilitate timely enrollment of patients by broaden ing
the inclusion criterion for the maximum duration of PHN andthe exclusion criterion for the number of adequate 
courses of treatment with other medications for which response was inadequate; by allowingrescreening of patients 
excluded under these criteria before implementation of amendment 03 ;and by increasing the number of study sites.
Amendment 02 :The primary reason for amendment 02 is to remove the stipulation inexclusion criterion “t”that 
excludespatients from participating in the study if they used any of the CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 inhibitors or 
substrates that were listed in Table 2 under Appendi x Ato this protocol. Related editorial changes have been made
as a result of this removal, including :1) replacement ofthe previous Table 2 (CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Substrates 
and Inhibitors with Documented Clinically Significant Interactions )in Appendix A with a new Table 2 entitled 
Washout Periods for Specific Drugs; and 2) revision of any statement(s) and cross -reference(s)within the protocol 
referring to information previ ously provided in Table 2of Appendix A .
An additional reason for amendment 02 is to revise inclusion criterion “d”to broaden the recruitment criterion for 
BMI by increasing the upper limit of the range for BMI from 32 to 34 kg/m2.
Amendment 02 also serves to correct the list of drugs, as described in Section 7.3.4.2 that are detected by the urine 
drug screen performed to detect the presence of drugs prohibited by protocol. Alcohol wasincorrectly listed in 
Section 7.3.4.2 as a substance detected by the drug screen, and has beendeleted from Section 7.3.4.2 as part of this 
amendment.
Time windows have been added for the timing of the dermal irritation test and for the triplicate ECGs to allow for 
natural variability in timing and to avoid unnecessary protocol deviations.
Minor editorial changes for improved text flow and clarity have been incorporated into the protocol text as part of 
this amendment.
Finally, the protocol is now  presented in an updated protocol template maintained by the Sponsor. The change to an 
updated template is an administrative change per Sponsor policy, and is not intended to alter the clinical conduct of 
the study.

301. BACKGROUND I NFORMATION
1.1. Introduction 
Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a complication of herpes zoster in which pain persists for more 
than 3 months after resolution of the rash . (Three months is the most commonly  identified
duration, although d efinitions of duration for PHN vary  from >1 months to >6 months.) 
Postherpetic neuralgia affects between 10 % to 15% of people who have herpes zoster and 
increases with age, affecting up to 70% of those infected who are more than 70 y ears old (Davies
and Galer 2004, Dubinsky et al 2004 , Kostand Straus 1996). Elderl y patients tend to have more 
severe and longer lasting PHN.
Postherpetic neuralgia is a classical neuropathic pain condition in which damage to peripheral 
sensory nerves (and the dorsal horn regions of the spinal cord) is believed to generate 
spontaneous peripheral neural discharges that lead secondaril y to hyperexcitability  of dorsal horn 
sensory neurons and result in exaggerated central nervous system(CNS)responses to all input, a 
condition known as central se nsitization (Kostand Straus 1996). Ty pically, patients with PHN 
have both a zone of loss of sensation andzones of altered sensation to light touch and 
temperature . Pain is described as deep aching or burning in qualit y and may be tr iggered by  
non-painful stimulus (mechanical allody nia) or temperature cha nge (warm or cold allody nia). It 
may last for y ears, although there is a tendency  for it to wane over time . In those patients whose 
pain is persistent and severe, PHN becomes debilitating, markedly  restricting the patient’s 
activity and quality  of life.
Despite the numerous compounds available for treating PHN , 40% to 50% of PHN patients do
not respond to an y treatment (Rowbotham and Petersen 2001 ). Antiviral therap y for acute herpes 
zoster has been shown to speed clearing of the rash, but a recent meta -analysis showed that it 
does not reduce the likelihood of the development of PHN ( Li et al 2009). Antivirals also have 
no demonstrable benefit after the rash has cleared and are of no use once PHN is established . 
Tricyclic antidepressants were the first analgesic agents that showed efficacy  in randomized 
controlled tri als of PHN, and ,subsequentl y,anticonvulsant agents, strong opioids ,and topical 
analgesics ha ve also demonstrated efficacy .
Atopical patch containing 5% lidocaine, a nonselective sodium channel blocker ( LIDODERM®, 
Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc ),was approved b y the United States (US) Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)for the treatment of PHN . In 2004, a subcommittee of the A merican 
Academy of Neurology determined that there was solid Class I evidence of efficac y for the 
lidocainepatch in PHN (Dubinsky  et al 2004). T he lidocaine patch, if perhaps less effective than 
other approved treatments such as gab apentin and pregabalin ( Dworkin et al 2003 ), is consi dered 
highly efficacious in PHN , although there have been no head -to-head comparisons with other 
agents and the number -needed-to-treat (NNT)variesfrom study  to study(Davies and Galer 
2004). The safety and tolerability of the lidocaine patch has probably  contributed most t o its 
widespread use in PHN . Safety and the reduced risk of drug-drug interaction s (DDIs) with a 
topical formulation are particularl y relevant, given the elderly age of most patients affected b y 
PHN and their need for concomitant medications . 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
31TV-45070 is a novel, potent, voltage -dependent sodium channel (Na V) blocker being developed 
for the treatment of patients with various neuropathic painindications. Unlike lidocaine, 
TV-45070 has been designed to selectivel y blockactivity in the Na V1.7 channel, which is 
believed to be the most important sodium channel contributing to spontaneous and hy peractive 
discharges emanating from peripheral nociceptive neurons. Nonclinical studies have
demonstrated that TV -45070 has efficacy  in several classical neuropathic pain models, with 
comparable efficacy  to gabapentin in the chronic constriction injury  (CCI)model and superior 
efficacy to 5% lidocaine in a topical stre ptozotocin -induced diabetic neuropathic pain model . 
TV-45070 has been studied in a 2
-period crossover trial (each period lasting 3 weeks) in 62 PHN 
patientswho received 1 or more TV-45070 doses . Although it did not meet the primary  endpoint 
(change in mean daily pain score during the last week compared to baseline as measured by  the 
Numeric Rating Scale [ NRS]), a significantly larger percentage of patients with 50% reductions 
in pain were seen during the TV -45070 treatment period in the efficacy  evaluable and per 
protocol(PP)analysis groups. 
The current study  is designed to further evaluate the efficacy  of 
TV-45070 in a larger, parallel -group stud y design.
1.2. Name and Description of Investigational Product
TV-45070 (formerlyknown as XEN402 [active pharmaceutical ingredient]) is a white to 
yellowish cry stalline powder . Its chemical name is (S)-1’- {[5-(trifluoromethy l)furan-2-
yl]methyl}spiro[furo [2,3 f][1,3]benzodioxole -7,3’-indol]-2’(1H)-one. Its chemical formula is 
C22H14F3NO5. 
Topical TV -45070 is an unscented, off -white to yellowish, opaque ointment with a smooth 
texture. The clinical formulation contains 4% or 8% ( weight per weight [ w/w]) TV-45070 with 
the excipients described in Section 4 of the Investigator’s Brochure . 
The matching placebo 
ointment contains only  the excipients.
A more deta iled description of the product is given in Section3.6.
1.3. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies
1.3.1. Nonclinical Studies
Nonclinical studies have been completed to characterize the tolerability , toxicity, 
pharmacokinetics, and efficacy  of TV-45070 following dermal application and oral 
administration. 
Prior to development of TV -45070, a package of nonclinical studies was 
conducted using the racemic compound XEN401 ( where TV -45070 comprises 50% of the 
racemate b y weight).
1.3.1.1. Pharmacology Studies
In vitro el ectrophysiologic studies indicated that TV -45070 is a potent Na Vblocker active against 
several Na Vsubtypes, including those associated with pain sig naling.  
 

Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
32In vivo studies in neur opathic and inflammatory  pain models in the rat demonstrated that topical 
administration of TV- 45070 provides analgesic relief superior to current marketed topical 
therapeutics such as lidocaine and diclofenac .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Based on these data, the 
analgesic effect of topical TV- 45070 in these anima l models is considered to be due to a local 
rather than a s ystemic drug effect.

1.3.2. Clinical Studies
To date, topicall y administered TV -45070 (formerly  known as XEN402) has been evaluat ed in 
3clinical studies: a Phase 1 study in healthy  subjects, a Phase 2a stud y in patients with PHN, and 
a Phase 2a stud y in patients with inherited erythromelalgia (IEM). Eighty-ninesubjects 
(20healthy subjects, 62 PHN patients, and 7 IEM patients) rec eived multiple applications of 
TV-45070 ointment.
Additionally , topical TV -45070 
has been evaluated in aPhase 2 study in patients with 
osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee , a Phase 1 dose -escalation study  in healthy volunteers , and a 
Phase 1 DDI study with midazolam and omeprazole .Final data are not yet available from these 
studies.
Oral TV-
45070 has been evaluated in 3 clinical studies: a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) 
and multiple ascending dose (MAD) stud y, a Phase 2a stud y in patients w ith pain following third 
molar extractions, and a Phase 2a study  in patients with I EM. 
The clinical conduct of the OA stud y,the dose-escalation study ,and the DDI study have been 
completed, but anal ysis is ongoing . A brief summary  of the results of all 
completed topical and 
selected oral TV -45070 studies ispresented below with more details available in the 
Investigator’s Brochure . The results of the other oral TV
-45070 studies are available in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.
1.3.2.1. Clinical Pharmacology Studies
Topical TV-45070 resul ts in minimal to negligible sy stemic exposure to TV -45070. The 
TV-45070 plasma concentrations in this paragraph are maximum individual (not group mean)
values. Topical TV -45070 was administered to 20 healthy  subjects for 21 day s in a Phase 1 stud y 
(Study XPF-002-101) in which topical TV -
45070 was shown to be safe and well tolerated with 
low plasma exposure (highest observed plasma TV -45070 concentrations <1 ng/mL). In a 
Phase2a study (Study XPF-002-201) conducted in 68 patients with PHN , 62 patients were 
treated with topical TV -45070 for 21 day s, and in a Phase 2a stud y (Study XPF-002-202) 
conducted in 8 patients with I EM, 7 patients were treated with topical TV -45070 for 14 or
21days
. The amount of drug applied was calculated based on 
the patient’s BSA and a 
pre-determined fixed -dose volume . The highest plasma TV -45070 concentration observed in an y 
patient was approximately  14ng/mL.
In the oral TV -45070 SAD/MAD study  (Study XPF-001-101), oral TV -
45070 was shown to be 
safe at single dos es up to 500 mg (ie, maximum tolerated dose [MTD]) and at doses up to 
400mg twice daily  for 5.5 day s. 
The SAD pharmacokinetic profiles had a mean C maxof 
1410ng/mL and a mean area under the concentration -time curve from time 0 to infinity  
(AUC0-inf)of 7305 ng•h/mL  in cohort 5 (500 mg) . Dose-limiting toxicity  due to dizziness and 
somnolence was seen in healthy  subjects following single oral doses of 800 mg TV-
45070. 
No QTc interval changes were observed in an y of the oral TV -45070 clinical studies.
Furthermore, except for single reports of non -sustained ventricular tachy cardia and ventricular 

Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
36extrasystoles, no other observations of clinicall y significant QRS prolongation were observed in 
studies of orally  or topically  administered TV -45070.More details a re available in Section 7 .11.3
of the Investigator’s Brochure.
The highest (maximum individual) C maxvalues observed in the topical TV -45070 studies were 
100-fold lower than the mean C maxat the oral MTD for a single dose.
1.3.2.2. Clinical Safety and Efficacy Studies
The safety, tolerability , pharmacokinetics, and efficacy  of topical TV-45070 were evaluated in 
68 patients with PHN in a Phase 2a, randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, crossover 
study using 8% w/w TV -
45070 ointment applied twice dail yfor 3 weeks (Study XPF-002-201) . 
Topical TV -45070 was found to be safe and well tolerated with low plasma exposure (mean C max
2ng/mL). The primary  endpoint of mean change from baseline in pain scores in the last week 
was similar between topical TV-45070 and p
lacebo treatments. 
However, a responder anal ysis 
demonstrated that a greater proportion of patients achieved at least 50% reduction in pain from 
baseline while using topical TV-45070 treatment (26.8%) compared with placebo (10.7%) 
(p=0.0039) . There were no fatal events reported during the stud y. Two serious adverse events 
were reported in 2 patients: a tooth abscess that occurred during placebo treatment and 
worsening coronary  artery disease that occurred during topical TV-45070 treatment . 
Treatment 
was discontinued in the patient with coronary  artery disease. Neither serious adverse event was 
considered related to study  drug treatment . Seven other patients discontinued treatment due to 
local skin reactions (5 patients during placebo treatment and 2 during t opical TV-45070 
treatment) . The most frequently  reported treatment
-emergent adverse events were application 
site reactions, which were more common with placebo treatment than with topical TV-45070 
treatment . 
The majorit y of application site reactions were mild or moderate; no patient had a 
severe application site reaction while on TV-45070 treatment.
Additionally , topical TV-45070 was tested in 8 patients with I EM in an exploratory  Phase 2a, 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  using 8% w/w TV -45070 ointment applied 
twice dail yfor 14 or 21 day s (Study XPF-002-202). 
Topical TV -45070 was found to be safe and 
well tolerated with low plasma exposure (mean C max4.64 ng/mL) . For 3 of the 7 patients treated 
with topical TV -45070, pain was consistently  inhibited by  TV-45070 (as measured b y the 
standard heat inductions, self- provoked inductions, and daily  pain scores) with corresponding 
trends in sleep interference scores and minimal use of rescue measures in treatment period 2 
compared with baseline . These 3 patients were considered to be responders . There were no fatal 
events. 
No serious adverse events were reported during the stud y. However, several months 
following stud y completion and 131 day s after the last dose of study  
drug, a patient (Patient , 
topical TV-45070 treatment) was hospitalized for worsening EM pain
. The serious adverse event 
was considered b y both the investigator and 
Sponsorto be unrelated to study  drug treatment . One 
patient (Patient , topical TV-45
070 treatment) was withdrawn from the study  due to 2 
adverse events (nodules on hands and cy anosis on hands) considered unrelated to study  drug 
treatment . The most frequently  reported treatment- emergent adverse events were headache and 
nasopharyngitis . 
Thevast majority  of treatment -emergent adverse events were considered 
unrelated to stud y drug treatment . The most frequently  occurring, study drug-related treatment-
emergent adverse events appeared to be local reactions to the ointment . These events were 
experienced b y patients treated with TV-45070 and the patient treated with placebo.

Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
371.3.2.3. Pharmacogenomic S tudies
Although not an endpoint itself, R1150W poly morphism status will be used to stratify  patients 
for randomization . 
Those who carry  the R1150W poly morphism have a nucleotide containing adenine (A) instead 
of guanine (G) in the rs6746030 single nucleotide poly morphism in the SCN9A gene. This 
change causes an arginine to try ptophan a mino acid residue change at position 1150 in the alpha 
subunit of the voltage -gated sodium channel Na V1.7. Those who carry  the R1150W 
polymorphism may  be heterozy gous (GA) or homozy gous (AA) for the minor allele. This 
R1150W poly morphism in the SCN9A gene may affect pain perception ( Reimann et al 2010 ).
 
In the Phase 2a PHN study  
(StudyXPF-002-201), the prevalence of R1150W in exon 19 of the SCN9Agene among stud y 
patients was investigated. Of the 52 patients tested, 9 patients had the R1150W poly morphism. 
Of the subgroup of patients test who were efficacy  evaluable (n=45), 8 patients had the R1 150W 
polymorphism. The rate of response to treatment was summarized by  genotype. Patients who 
were heteroz ygous for the R1150W poly morphism showed higher response rates to TV-45070
than those without the poly morphism , although this result did not reach sta tistical significance. 
In addition, patients with the R1150W poly morphism were less likel y to respond to placebo, 
although this subgroup was too small to demonstrate statistical significance.
Further details may be found in the current Investigator’s Broch ure. 
1.4. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects
1.4.1. Risks of TV -45070
Following topical administration, no observed CNS adverse events were considered related to 
TV-45070 treatment by  the investigator. Similarly, with the exception of 1 case of worsening 
coronary artery disease assessed as unrelated to study  drug treatment, no significant ECG 
findings or cardiac arrh ythmias were observed in studies of topical TV -45070.
In nonclinical dermal toxicology studies performed in minipigs, skin irritatio n was seen 
frequently in animals dosed either with TV -45070 or vehicle ointment, most often wit hin the first 
week of dosing. The skin reactions are predominantly  erythema and appear to be due to the 
ointment vehicle itself. In prior clinical studies, howev er, local reactions at the site of topical
application of TV -45070 or matching placebo were seen infrequentl y. These reactions usually 
consisted of ery thema or skin dry ness with scaling of skin, were generally  mild to moderate, and 
were approximately  the same in frequency  and severity  for patients treated with either TV -45070 
or placebo. Although the skin reactions may  appear within a couple of day s of exposure, they  
more often occur after a delay  of 2to 3 weeks and resolve soon after cessation of dosing.
Worsening skin reactions should be monitored closely.
Due to low sy stemic exposure following topical administration of TV -45070 in humans, the DDI 
risk due to effects on CYP450 enzy mes is thought to be low following topical administration. In 
vitro data using human liver microsomes haveshownthat TV-45070 is an inhibitor of several 
CYP450 enzy mes.However, the compound is also highl y bound to constituents in human 
plasma, so distribution into hepatocy tes may be hindered, reducing the inhibition potential. In 

Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
38vitro data using human cryopreserved hepatocy tes have also shown that TV -45070 metabolite 
(M3) is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 , which indicates a potential DDI risk between 
TV-45070 and medications that are primarily  metabolized by CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 .However, 
the preliminary  results of a clinical study  designed to assess the risk of these DDIs revealed no 
significant risk of an interaction .
1.4.2. Benefits of TV -45070
The difficult y of treating PHN adequatel y, with many patients refractory to available therapies, 
means that there is an ongoing medical need for new treatment options providing effective 
topical pain relief with a good safet y profile. As a topical sodium channel blocker, TV -45070 
may have potent local effects in terms of reduc ing pain in PHN.
1.4.3. Overall Risk and Benefit Assessment for This Study
In summary , topically  administered TV -45070 showed a generally favorable safet y profile in 
nonclinical and clinical studies. Overall, the data for both oral and topicall y administered 
TV-45070 support the continued evaluation of topical TV -45070 in clinical studies conducted in 
patients with chronic pain.
A listing of adverse events observed during studies of topical TV -45070,which were judged to 
represent adverse drug reactions, is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.
Additional information regarding risks and benefits of TV- 45070 to humans may  be found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.
1.5. Selection of Drugs and Dosages 
The dosage regimens selected for this study  are 4% and 8% w/w TV-45070ointment, each 
administered twice daily .
1.5.1. Justification for Dosage of Active Drug
The selected dosage regimens are based on results from animal pharmacology  studies, safet y 
information from previous toxicology  and clinical studies, and clinical efficacy  previously 
observed with the topical TV-45070 formulation.
TV-45070 has been administered topicall y to 20 healthy subjects for 21 days, 62 patients with 
PHN for 21days, and 7 patients with EM for 14 or 21 day s. In all of these studies, the treatment 
was safe and well tolerated. In the healthy  subject study , the ointment was found to be a 
nonirritant. I n the PHN and EM studies, local application site reactions were the most common 
treatment -emergent adverse events. In addition, TV -45070 has been administer ed orally to 
93healthy subjects and 4 patients with EM. Exposure data from all of these studies are presented 
in Section 6.2 of the Investigator ’s Brochure.
Given that the planned dosage regimens in this study  are similar or lower than those employ ed 
previously in the PHN and I EM studies ,and the amount applied per surface area is less than that 
used in previous studies (3 μL /cm2in this study  compared with 7.5 and 4 μL/cm2in the previous 
PHN and EM studies , respectivel y), the safet y profile is anticipate d to be similar to that observed 
previously  in the topical PHN and EM studies. In addition, signals of efficacy  were observed in 
both the PHN and EM studies in which 8% w/w TV-45070 ointment was applied twice dail y. 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
39Therefore, it is reasonable to include t he 8% w/w TV-45070 dose as a high dose in this 
proof-of-concept study  in PHN.
A more detailed description of study  drug administration is presented in Section5.1.
1.5.2. Justification for Use of Placebo
The use of placebo is necessary  because there is no alternative method for establishing the 
efficacy of TV-45070 for chronic pain. Pain is a subjective condition, and there is no gold 
standard treatment for PHN that provides universally  effective pain relief. The risk to patients for 
withholding alternative therapies for pain relief is negligible, and patients are free to withhold 
their consent for doing so and may withdraw from the study at anytime. Rescue medication will 
be permitted once the subject has completed their baseline period.
1.6. Compliance Statement
This study  will be conducted in full accordance with t he International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Cons olidated Guideline (E6) and any

1.7. Population To Be Studied and Justification
The study  population will comprise approximately 330 patients (men and women) 18 y ears of 
age or older andwith chronic PHN. Approximately 330 patients (110 per treatment group) will 
be randoml y assigned to 4% w/wTV-45070 ointment, 8% w/wTV-45070 ointment, or placebo 
to ensure that up to approximately  88 patients per group complete the treatment period, ie, have 
the week 4visit(visit 5, day  29).
Patients must have chronic PHN according to the definition of pain present for more than 
6months and less than 6 years after onset of herpes zos ter skin rash affecting a single 
dermatome. Patients with more than 1 involved dermatome may  also be included, provided the 
affected dermatomes are contiguous. The patient’s average dail y pain must be at least 4 on the 
11-point NRS at screening and during the baseline pain assessment interval (day s –7 to –1)

443. STUDY DESIGN
3.1. General Design and Study Schema
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double- blind, parallel -group, placebo- controlled 
study to evaluate the safety  and efficacy  of 4% and 8% w/w TV -45070 ointment compared with 
placebo ointment applied topically  and twice dail yto the area of PHN pain for 4 weeks (day s 1 
through 28) in patients with PHN. The study  schema is diagramed in Figure1.
For each patient, there will be a total of 6 visits to the study  site and 1 telephone contact as 
follows:
screening period
visit 1: screening (up to 28 day s before randomization/first administration of 
study drug)
washout phone contact (approximately  1 week after visit 1 for screening)
washout interval (if needed) of variable/flexible length during which the patient 
will discontinue oral analgesic therap y,topical pain therapy , and/or 
non-pharmacologic therapies before initiation of the baseline period( Appendix A, 
Table2)
visit 2: baseline visit (day  –10)
baseline pain assessment period (day s –7 to –1; baseline pain score [average pain 
intensity score over this interval] obtained)
treatment period
visit 3: randomization (day  1 [this is the day  after day  –1 and the first day  of study 
drug application])
visit 4: day 15 ±1, week 2
visit 5: day 29, week 4
follow-up period
visit 6: follow-up(day 57±3) or early  termination (ET)
The screening period consists of a screening visit (informed consent and preliminary  eligibility  
assessment are obtained); a washout phone contact during which eligibility  based on laboratory  
test results will be reviewed and, as needed, patients will be given instructions to washout 
(discontinue) oral analgesic or topical pain therapy ; a washout interval (if needed) of 
variable/flexible length during which appropriate patients will discontinue oral analgesic therapy,
topical pain therap y, and/or non- pharmacologic therapies ; and a baseline pain assessment 
interval, when each eligible patient will be given an electronic diar y(eDiary)to record pain 
intensityfrom days –10 to –1. (To allow for training in the use of eDiaries,patients will use 
eDiaries from day  –10, but baseline pain assessment will be defined as the last 7 day sprior to 
randomization, ie ,calculated from the values recorded from days -7 through –1.) During the 
baseline pain assessment interval, rescue medications for PHN pain will not be allowed. Rescue 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
45medication will also not be allowed during the last 7 days of treatment. Starting with the baseline 
pain assessment interval, patients will use eDia riesto record pain, using an 11- point NRS each 
morning (0700 ±2 hours) and evening (1900 ±2 hours), and any rescue pain medication usage.  
 
At visit 3 ( day 1, randomization), visit 4 ( day 15 ±1, week 2),and visit5 (day 29, week 4), the 
NPSI and the DSISwill be administered, and the results will be recorded. On the same 
visit days, 
the results of maximal inten sity evoked allody nia and maximal intensity  evoked hy peralgesia 
will be recorded. The NePI QoL will be evaluated at visit 3 ( day 1, randomization) and visit 5 
(day 29, 
week 4). The PGI C will be evaluated at visit 4 (day 15 ±1, week 2) andvisit 5 (day 29, 
week 4).Efficacy measures are not collected at visit 6, except for ET visits.
At visit 1 (screening), the patient will identify  the location of his/her most severe allody nia, and 
this location will be used for assessments at all subsequent visits. I f allodynia or hy peralgesia is 
not present at screening, it will not be tested at subsequent visits. The investigator will establish 
normal sensation by
 using a standardized 1 -inch foam brush (light pressure just sufficient to bend 
the tip of the brush) to strok e an area of skin that is unaffected b y pain. The region of allod ynia 
will then be mapped b y applying brush strokes moving from normal skin toward the painful 
region. A felt -tip pen will be used to mark the point where sensation changes from normal to 
painful. This process will be repeated until 8 to 10 points are marked in a radial fashion to define 
the area of allod ynia. The marks will then be connected with a continuous line. To assess the 
intensity of allody nia, the investigator will use the brush to pe rform 3 brush strokes within the 
mapped area of allody nia. The patient will then assess pain intensity  using an 11- point NRS to 
answer the question “Please rate the intensity  of pain caused by  brushing the area of skin where 
0=not painful at all and 10=wor st pain possible.” The pain will be rated for intensity  (using the 
highest pain rating reported) both at prebrush testing and during application of the brush and 
recorded; additionally , the difference between the 2 scores will be calculated and recorded. 
In addition, at visit 1 (screening), the patient will identify the location of his/her most severe 
hyperalgesia, and this location will be used for assessments at all subsequent visits. To assess the 
intensity of punctate hy peralgesia, a Medipin will be ap plied in 3 successive applications to the 
area of skin identified at screening. The tip of the Medipin rests upon a flange, and the examiner 
should apply  the pin so that the flange rests upon the skin without indenting it. The patient will 
then assess the 
pain intensity  using an 11-point NRS to answer the question “Please rate the 
intensity of pain caused by  application of the Medipinwhere 0=not painful at all and 10=worst 
pain possible.” The highest pain rating will be recorded.
Patients will be provided with acetaminophen (TYLENOL®, McNeil Consumer Healthcare 
Division of McNEIL -PPC, Inc) as 325- mg tabletsin bottles of 100 tablets and allowed to take 
1to 2 tabletsper dose every  6 hours,as needed, andup to 6tabletsor 1950mg per day  (over a 
24-hour period) for rescue relief of PHN pain. Rescue medication will be provided at the 
screening visit. Rescue medication compliance will be checked at all visits until used rescue 
medication is collected after the baseline pain assessment interval or at randomi zation for 
patients not continuing in the study , at visit 5 ( day 29, week 4) for patients who complete the 
treatment period ,or at the ET visit for patients who prematurel y discontinue study  drug.
No other rescue medications will be provided or allowed fro m the washout phone contact 
through visit 5 ( day 29, week 4) or the ET visit. Patients will not be permitted to use rescue 

Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
46medication during the baseline pain assessment interval (day s –10 through –1) and during the 
final week of treatment (the 7 -day period before visit 5). During the washout interval, rescue 
medication use (dates of use and dose taken) will be recorded as concomitant medication. During 
the baseline period and the treatment period, rescue medication use will be recorded using the 
eDiary.
Atthe randomization visit (visit 3, day  1), eligible patients will be randomly assigned via 
interactive response technology  (IRT)in a 1:1:1 fashion to 1of 3treatment groups: 4% w/w 
TV-45070 ointment, 8% w/w TV-45070 ointment, or placebo ointment. Randomization will be 
stratified by  test results of the pharmacogenomic sample collected at the screening visit 
(homozygous minor allele [positive, AA], heterozygous [positive, AG], and homozy gous 
common allele [nega tive, GG]) for R1150W polymorphism in the SCN9Agene. The patient will 
be instructed on how to apply thestudy drug. Under study  sitestaff supervision, the area affected 
by PHN pain will be carefully  defined by  mapping the area of pain, and dosing will be prescribed 
to fully cover the affected area. 
Efficacy assessments of pain NRS, NPSI, NePIQoL , and DSI S scores will be conducted at visit 3
(day 1) to establish baseline measurements. The site staffwill apply the first dose of blinded 
study drug and the patient will record the date/time in the eDiary .Subsequent study  drug 
applications will be pe rformed by  the patient at home. (If the affected area is not within reach of 
application by  the patient [such as the posterior thoracic region], the patient’s designated 
caregiver will appl y the ointment, but the patient will record the time of application in the 
eDiary.)
During the 4- week treatment period, patients will apply  double-blind study  drug to the area of 
PHN pain twice dail yin the morning (0700 ±2 hours ) and again in the evening (1900 ±2 hours). 
The first dose of stud y drug will be applied at the clinic on day  1 (visit 3). Regardless of the 
clock time of the first dose application at visit 3, the evening dose for day  1 should be applied at 
1900 ±2 hours. The last dose of study  drug will be applied at home on the evening of day  28, 
which is the day before visit 5. In the event that the patient cannot keep the scheduled 
appointment on day  29, it is nevertheless important for the patient to stop dosing on th e evening 
of day 28. The morning and evening drug applications will be done after recording the response 
for the NRS pain score. At the start of the baseline pain assessment interval when the eDiary  is 
provided, the eDiary  will be used to record the NRS re sponses, PHN rescue medication use, and 
then,after randomization, the dates/times of study  drug administration. 
Patients will return to the study  site for visit 4 ( day 15 ±1, week 2) and again for visit 5 ( day29, 
week 4). Routine efficacy  evaluations ( including pain NRS, NPSI, DSI S, and PGI Cscores) and 
safety assessments will be obtainedat visit 4 (day  15±1,week 2) and visit 5 (day  29, week 4).
At visit 4 ( day 15±1, week 2), 2 blood sample swill be taken from each patient for 
pharmacokinetics anal ysis: the firstsample within approximately  1 to 4 hours after the dose of 
study drug in the morning and the second sample approximately  2 hours after collection of the 
firstsample. The date and time of the morning dose and the date and exact time for each of the 
2pharmacokinetics samples will be recorded.
At visit 5(day 29, week 4 ), the efficacy  evaluation NePIQoL will also be performed, and the 
eDiary will be collected along with the tubes of study  drug and bottles of rescue medication.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
47Patients will be instructed to return to their primary care ph ysician to resume therapy  deemed 
appropriate for their PHN.
Four weeks after visit 5 (day 29, week 4), the patients who completed the double -blind treatment 
period will return to the study  site for a follow -up (visit 6, day 57 ±3). Activities will include 
safety assessments for all patients.
Patients who prematurel y discontinue study drug will have an ET visit within 2 weeks after the 
last study  drug administration . During the ET visit, the same activities will be conducted as those 
administered for follow -up at visit 6, the eDiary  and any unused study  drug/rescue medication 
will be collected , and compliance checks will be performed . Any treatment -emergent adverse 
event or serious advers e event will be monitored at suitable intervals until resolved, stabilized, or 
returned to baseline; until the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional; or until 
a determination of a cause unrelated to the stud y drug or study procedure is made during the 
study period. For adverse event recording, the study  period is defined for each patient as that 
time period from signature of the Informed Consent Form ( ICF)through the end of the follow -up 
period, day  57 (±3). For patients who prematu rely discontinue study  drug and do not have a 
treatment -emergent adverse event or serious adverse event, th eET visit will be the last study  
visit.

eDiary = electronic diary; ET = early termination
Notes: The screening visit should take place within 28 days of randomization ,thus, day –28 is the earliest that it can occur.
The washout phone contact should occur approximately 1 week after the screening visit ,thus, day –21 is the earliest it can occur.
The length of the washout period will vary from patient to patient depending on what, if any, treatments (analgesic therapy, topical pain therapy, and/or 
non-pharmacologic therapy) need to be discontinued.
Patients who discontinue study drug prematurely (any time after randomization and before visit 5) will have an ET visit w ith the same procedures as those 
scheduled for the follow -up visit plus eD iary and unused study drug/rescue medication collection (and compliance checks). Depending on when the patient stops 
taking study drug, the patient may proceed directly from visit 3 or visit 4 to the ET visit.

493.2. Justification for Study Design
TV-45070 has previously been studied in a 2 -period crossover study (each period lasting 3 
weeks) in 62 PHN patients who received 1 or more TV -45070 doses. Although it did not meet 
the primary  endpoint (change in mean daily  pain score during the last week compared to baseline 
as measured b y the NRS), a significantly  larger percentage of patients with 50% reductions in 
pain were seen during the TV -45070 treatment period in the efficacy  evaluable and per protocol 
(PP) analy sis groups. The current study  is designed to more definitively  evaluate the efficacy  of 
TV-45070 in a l arger, parallel -group stud y design.
3.3. Primary and Secondary Measure sand Endpoint s
3.3.1. Primary Efficacy Measure and Endpoint
The primary  efficacy endpoint for this study  is the change from baseline to week 4 in the weekl y 
average of the daily  average NRS scores .The daily  average NRS score is the average of the 
2NRS scores (recorded in the morning and in the evening ) of average pain, defined as the 
patient-reported average pain in tensity over the prior 12 hours .
3.3.2. Secondary Efficacy Measures and Endpoints
The secondary  efficacy measures and endpoints for this study  are as follows: 
change from baseline to week 4

3.3.4. Safety Measures and Endpoints
The safety of TV-45070 (4% and 8% w/w ointment) will be assessed throughout the stud y by 
evaluating adverse events, clinical safet y laboratory  test results, vital signs measureme nts, ECG 
and physical examination results, dermal irritation, and concomitant medication usage. Skin 
rashes or skin irritation in the area of ointment application will be evaluated using a dermal 
irritation scale (modified Draize scale) at day  1 (at 1 hour [±30 minutes] after application of 
study drug), week 2, week 4, and week 8 for follow -up.
3.3.5. Tolerability Measures and Endpoints
The tolerability  of TV-45070 (4% and 8% w/w ointment) will be assessed during the study  using 
safety endpoints that also represent patients’ experience of treatment, such as skin rashes and 
skin irritation.
3.3.6. Pharmacokinetic Measures and Endpoints
Two blood samples will be collected from each subject following 2 weeks of treatment with 
either 4% or 8% w/w TV -45070 ointment or matching placebo ointment, to quantitate the 
concentration of TV -45070 in plasma. Patients will go to the study  center after appl ying study 
drug at home so that the 2 pharmacokinetic samples can be taken. The first sample will be taken 
within approximately 1 to 4 hours of the morning dose of study  drug and the second sample 
taken approximately  2 hours after collection of the first sample. The date and time of the 
morning dose and the date and exact time for each of the 2 pharmacokinetic samples will be 

Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 0 3 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
51recorded. Plasma samples will be analy zed for TV -45070. Population pharmacokinetic
parameters, such as CL/F and V/F, following topical TV -45070 administration to patients with 
PHN, will be estimated when the sparse data from this study  arecombined with enrich ed 
pharmacokinetic data from other studies with topical TV -45070. Clinicall y relevant covariates 
affecting the pharmacokinetics of TV- 45070 will be identified as data permit. These results will 
be reported separate lyfrom the main study  results.
3.3.7. Pharmacody
namic Measures and Endpoints
Pharmacod ynamic endpoints assessed during the study  are the following secondary  efficacy 
endpoints: change from baseline in maximal intensity  of patients’ brush- evoked allody niaand 
maximal intensity  of punctate -evoked hy peralgesia, as presented in Section3.3.2.
3.3.8. Pharmacogenomic Analyses
Two blood samples (approximately  10 mL total) for pharmacogenomic analy ses will be taken 
from all patients at the screening visit (visit 1) at approximately  the same time as the clinical 
safety laboratory samples are collected . Patients who refuse to give these blood samples will be 
excluded from the study . One sample will be analyze d to identify  the nucleotide (G or A) 
underlying the R1150W poly morphism in the 
SCN9Agene and may  identifywhether there are
any other sequence variants in the SCN9Agene region. All samples will be retained for a 
maximum of 15 years after completion of t he study  
 
 A pharmacogenomic blood sample may be used to assess the 
polymorphisms of the CYP3 A4and CYP2C19genes. Depending on the distribution of allelic 
variations for CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, these results may  be incorporated as covariates in the 
current or future population pharmacokinetic analyses.  
 
 
3.4. Randomization and Blinding
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study . All tubes of the study  drug will be 
identical, and the ointments will be indistin guishable. Patients, investigators, and all clinical 
study site staff will remain blinded to treatment assignment during the study . Eligible patients 
will be randomly  assigned via I RT in a 1:1:1 ratio to 4% w/w TV-45070 ointment, 8% w/w 
TV-45070 ointment, or placebo ointment. Randomization will be stratified by  the R1150W 
underlying genoty pe in the SCN9Agene: homozygous minor allele (positive, AA), heterozy
gous 
(positive, AG), and homozy gous common allele (negative, GG).
The randomization code will be generated by a qualified service provider ,following 
specifications from the Biostatistics Department . 
In addition, the Sponsor’s clinical personnel involved in the study  will be blinded to the study  
drug identit y until the database is locked for anal ysis and t he treatment assignment revealed . A 
statistician not assigned to the study  will be responsible for reviewing the randomization code, 
and the final randomization code will be maintained by  the service provider .

Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 0 3 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
52Patientswill be randomly assigned to treatment through a qualified randomization service 
provider (eg, IRT).This system will be used to ensure a balance across treatment groups; no 
effort will be made to maintain a balance among treatment groups within a study  site.
All patients will be provided with tubes of blinded study  drug ointment (4% w/w TV-45070, 
8%w/w TV-45070, or placebo) to be applied twice daily  to area of PHN pain during the 4- week 
treatment period. Placebo ointment is a vehicle -only ointment with i dentical excipients, content 
(other than the active pharmaceutical ingredient), appearance, packaging, and labeling to the 
active treatments. 
The clinical stud y site will receive stud y drug kits, and kits will be assigned to individual patients 
by the IRTsystem based on the patients’ randomization assignments. The IRT sy stem will 
record the kit numbers for all patients. Designated study  site staff, who will remain blinded to the 
treatment assignments, will dispense the kits to the patients based on the kit numbers assigned to 
patients by  the IRT system. In case of emergency , the investigator and designated study  site staff 
can call the I RT system to unblind the treatment for a specific patient. Details related to 
maintenance of blinding for study  conduct, including pharmacokinetic analy sis, and the 
unblinding process are in Section3.5.

The randomization code will be maintained in a secure location by a qualified service provider. 
At the time of anal yses, when treatment codes are revealed , the service provider will provide the 
randomization code to the statistician assigned to this study .
3.5.2. Blinding/Unblinding
Pharmacokinetic data may  be assessed during the study . For patients who have pharmacokinetic 
sample bioanal ysis and/or population pha rmacokinetic anal ysis conducted, the individuals 
responsible for these analyses will receive the randomization allocation and will know who 
received study  drug and who received placebo during the st udy. Staff responsible for bioanal ysis 
and pharmacokinetic data analysis will not directly  interact with clinical study  sitesand will not 
have direct involvement in study  conduct. All other study  team members will remain blinded. 
Pharmacokinetic anal yses performed during the conduct of the study  will be provided to the 
clinical pharmacologist and other staff members in a manner that will not identify  individual 
patients (ie, a dumm y patient identifier will be linked to an individual patient’s concentration 
data).
For information on other personnel who may  be aware of treatment assignments, see Section 3.4. 
These individuals will not be involved in the conduct of any  study procedures or assessment of 
any adverse events.
For a serious adverse event considered related (ie, reasonable possibility ; see Section7.1.4) to 
the study drug, the Sponsor’s Global Patient Safety  & Pharmacovigilance Department may  
independentl y request that the treatment code be revealed (on a case -by-case basis). If this 
occurs,the investigator will remain blinded to treatment, but the Sponsor’s clinical project 
physician (CPP)/clinical leader (CL) may  be unblinded to treatment in order to decide on the 
action to be taken, as described in Section3.9.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 0 3 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
53In the event of an emergency , if it is necessary  to know what treatment a specific patient has 
received, the investigator may  determine the patient’s treatment using I RT after consulting the 
Sponsor. I n an extreme emergency , if the investigator is unable to contact the Sponsor, the 
investigator may  determine the patient’s treatment using IRT without prior authorization. When 
this occurs, the investigator must contact the individ ual identified in the Clinical Study  Personnel 
Contact Information section of this protocol immediately ; the patient will be withdrawn from the 
study, and the event will be recorded on the stud y completion record. Proper documentation must 
be maintained wh en a treatment code is revealed. For a serious and unexpected adverse event 
considered related to the study  drug or stud y procedure, the Sponsor’s Global Patient Safety & 
Pharmacovigilance Department may  independently  request that the treatment code be rev ealed 
(on a case -by-case basis). If this occurs, personnel involved in the conduct, anal ysis, and 
reporting of the data will remain blinded to treatment.
3.6. Drugs used in the Study
3.6.1. Investigational Product
The study drug is a double-blind TV-45070 ointment (4% or 8% w/w) or placebo ointment for 
topical administration. TV-45070 and matching placebo ointments are unscented, off-white to 
yellowish, opaque ointments with a smooth texture . The ointments contain the same excipients 
(described in Section 4 of the Inve stigator’s Brochure) and differ only  in the amount of active 
pharmaceutical ingredient. (T he matching placebo ointment contains only  theexcipients.) They 
will be supplied to the study sitesas 50-g fills in 60 -mL plastic laminate tubes with 
tamper-evident seals. The tubes will be stored at ambient room temperature (15°C to 25°C). 
Blinded study  drug will be given to the patients as described in Section 3.4. Study drug will be 
applied twice dail y to the painful area in the morning (0700 ±2 hours) and again in the evening 
(1900 ±2 hours) from day s1 through 28. Study  drug will be applied at approximately  3 μL/cm2
per application. The actual amount (mg of ointment) of study drug per application will be 
measured (as length of ointment) using one or more dosing cardsbased upon the area of pain 
determined at randomization (visit 3, day 1).
Patients will be provided with a laminated instruction sheet ,including pictures ,thatwill both 
describe and illustrate how the ointment is to be spread over the entire area of PHN pain in a thin 
layer that full y covers the area. The ointment should be lightlymassaged into the skin to cover 
the entire area of PHN pain.
The first application of study  drug will occur at the study  siteon the day  of the randomization 
visit(visit 3, day 1). The study coordinator or designated site staff member will apply  blinded 
study drug and will define the amount of ointment to be used for all subsequent treatment 
applications for that patient . Dosing cards and instructions will be provided on how to measure 
the appropriate amount of ointment for each application.Caretakers will be provided instructions 
at the randomization visit on how to apply ointment to areas inaccessible to the study  patient.
The patients will apply  blinded study  drug twice daily (morning [0700 ±2 hours] and evening 
[1900 ±2 hours]) on the target areafor 4 weeks from day s1 through 28. On day  1, the morning 
dose might not be applied at 0700 ±2 hours because the first dose of stud y drug will be applied at 
the randomization visit (visit 3, day1). Regardless of the clock time of the first dose application 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 0 3 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
54at the randomization visit, the evening dose for day 1 should be applied at 1900 ±2 hours. Details 
about the timing of stud y drug applications are provided inSection3.11.3.
Compliance will be assessed by  weighing tubes at visit 3 (baseline) , visit 4 (day 15 ±1, week 2),
andvisit5 (day 29, week4),or ET visit. A patient will be considered compliant during the 
interval between the previous 2 visits if the tube weighs between 70% and 120% of the expected 
weight.
Amore detailed descriptio n of administration procedures is provided in Section5.1. 
3.6.2. Placebo
The placebo control for this study  is placebo ointment for topical administration. The m atching 
placebo ointment is an unscented, off -white to yellowish, opaque ointment with a smooth 
texture. The placebo ointment containsthe same excipients (described in Section 4 of the 
Investigator’s Brochure) as TV-45070, and differ sonly in that it contains no active 
pharmaceutical ingredient. The placebo ointmentwill be supplied to the study sites as 50- g fills 
in 60-mL plastic laminate tubes with tamper -evident seals. The tubes will be stored at ambient 
room temperature (15°C to 25°C). 
3.7. Drug Supply and Accountability
3.7.1. Drug Storage and Security
Topical TV -45070 (4% and 8% w/w) and matching placebo ointment will be supplied as 50- g 
fills in 60- mL plastic laminated tubes with tamper -evident seals. The tubes must be stored at 
ambient room temperature (15°C to 25°C) both at the study  site and at the patient’s home.
Only authorized personnel will have access to the study  drug at the stud y sites. The authorized 
study site personnel at each study  site will be responsible for the proper storage and handling of 
the study drug products. Study  site personnel will acknowledge receipt of the study  drug using 
the IRT.
3.7.2. Drug Accountability
Each stud y drug shipment will include a packing slip that lists the contents of the shipment. 
Study drug accountability records must be maintained at the study  site at all times . A record of 
study drug accountabilit y (ie, study drug and other materials received, used, or retained) with 
accounts/explanations given for an y discrepancies should be documented in the I RT and signed 
by the principal investigator or designee.
At each st udy site, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of study  drug and 
other study  materials from the Sponsor are correctly  received and recorded, handled and stored 
safely and properl y in accordance with applicable regulations ,and used in accordance with this 
protocol. 
At each stud y site, a record of study  drug accountability  (ie, study  drug and other materials 
received, used, retained, returned, or destro yed) must be prepared and signed by  the principal 
investigator or designee, with a n account given for any discrepancies so that possible diversions, 
abuse, and loss of stud y drug are documented. Empty /partially used/unused tubes of stud y drug,
upon the Sponsor’s approval, will either be destroyed by the study sitesor will be returned to a 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 0 3 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
55depot for destruction, according to local and national regulations at specified time intervals as 
described in the Study Pharmacy Manual. Documented evidence of destruction should be made 
available to the Sponsorand/or its designees. The investigator or designee will prepare an overall 
summary of all drug supplies received and used for the study . The investigator, pharmacist, or 
drug administrator and monitor must verify  that no drug supplies remain in the study  site’s 
possession.
3.8. Duration of Patient P articipation and Justification
This study  will consist of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, including a variable-length 
washout of oral analgesic therap y or topical pain therap y if needed, a 4- week double -blind 
treatment period, and a 4-week follow -up period. Patients are expected to participate in this study  
for about 12weeks. This duration is needed to allow the therapeutic properties of TV- 45070 to 
take effect and to be assessed as part of a controlled clinical trial.
3.9. Stopping Rules and Discontinuat ion Criteria
There are no formal rules for early  termination of this study . During the conduct of the study , 
serious adverse events will be reviewed (see Section7.1.5) as they are reported from the study
site toidentify safety concerns. 
In prior clinical studies with topical TV- 45070, skin irritation was seen in some patients exposed 
to either TV -45070 or vehicle, as described in the Investigator Br ochure (Appendix A, also
Sections 7.2.2 and 7.11.1). These skin reactions included pain, pruritus, exfoliation, rash, and 
erythema;were nearl y all mild to moderate in severity ; and showed complete resolution after 
cessation of dosing. Skin reactions are evaluated using the dermal irritation evaluation (modified 
Draizescale)as described in Section 7.9at visits 2 (baseline visit), 3 (randomization visit, 1hour 
[±30 minutes] after application of the ointment), 4 ( day 15 ±1, week 2 visit), 5 ( day 29, week 4 
visit),and 6(follow-up or ET visit). Good clinical judgment is advised in evaluating skin 
reactions. In the event that a patient develops progressive or severe skin reaction, the Investigator 
should carefull y evaluate the patient and decide whether or not to stop dosing. The Investigator is 
reminded to follow the adverse event reporting practices described in the pro tocol (Section 7.1) 
when recording and reporting an y adverse events, including dermal findings. 
A patient may  withdraw participation in the study  at any time for an y reason (eg, lack of 
efficacy, consent withdrawn, or adverse event). The investigator and/or Sponsorcan withdraw a 
patient from the study  at any time for any  reason (eg, protocol violation or deviation as defined 
in Section11.1.2, noncompliance, or adverse event).
Also, the Sponsor may terminate the study for any reason and at any  time.
3.10. Source Data Recorded on the Case Report Form
All patient data must have supportive original source documentation in the medical records, or 
equivalent, before they  are transcribed onto the case report form ( CRF). Data may  not be 
recorded directly  onto the CRF and considered as source data unless the study site obtains 
written documentation from the Sponsor before the beginning of the stud y, indicating which data 
are permitted to be recorded directl y onto the CRF . 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 0 3 Study TV45070- CNS-20013
56If data are processed from other institutions (eg, clinical laboratory , central image center, or 
eDiary), the results will be sent to the study  site where they  will be retained but not entered into 
the CRF unless otherwise noted in the protocol . These data may also be sent electronicall y to the 
Sponsor(or organization performing data management) for direct entry  into the clinical database 
(see Section13.1). All data from other institutions will be available to the investigator(s).
The CRFs are filed in the Sponsor ’scentral file .

623.11.1. Procedures for the Screening Period (Day –28 to Day –1)
3.11.1.1. Screening Visit (Visit 1, Day –28)
The screening visit will be no more than 28 day s before randomization/first dose of study  drug. 
A signed and dated ICF will be obtained before screening procedures commence. 
After informed consent is obtained, patients who are screened will be assigned an 8-digit 
permanent identification number such that all patients from each study  siteare given consecutive 
identificat ion numbers in successive order of inclusion. The first 2digits of this screening 
number will be the number assigned to the country  where the study  site is located , the next 3 
digits will be the designated study  site number, and the last 3 digits will be assigned at the study  
site (eg, if the number assigned to the country  is 01, the third patient screened at study  site 5 
would be given the number of 01005003).
A patient who is screened and does not meet study  entry criteria will not be considered for 
screening again , except that patients who were excluded from enrollment under inclusion or 
exclusion criteria that have since been revised may be rescreened to determine their eligibility  
under these criteria as amended . However, a patient taking prohibited co ncomitant medications 
may be allowed to continue with study  procedures if the investigator or designee believes that 
the patient can discontinue the prohibited medications during the 4 -week screening period and 
remain off the prohibited medications through the week 4 (visit 5, day  29) or the ET visit.
The screening visit (visit 1) will take place ≤28 days before the first dose (application) of study  
drug scheduled to be given in the clinic at the randomization visit (visit 3) on day 1. The 
following procedures to determine patient eligibility  for the stud y will be performed at the 
screening visit:
obtain written informed consent before an y other study -related procedures are 
performed
review inclusion/ exclusion criteria 
review medical history  and demograph y
review prior medication history  and concomitant medications
perform clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, hematology , and urinaly sis)
perform urine drug screen
perform vital signs measurements
perform physical examination (including body weight and height)
perform 12-lead ECG(all ECGs taken in triplicate tracings obtained at least 1 minute 
apart [with an upper limit of 5 minutes apart] )
obtain urine pregnancy  test (women of child -bearing potential onl y)
measure maximal intensity  of brush-evoked allody nia and maximal intensity  of 
punctate-evoked hy peralgesia
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070-CNS-20013
63obtain NRS, NPSI , DSIS, and NePIQoL assessments
dispense rescue medication
In addition, at visit 1 (screening), the patient will identify  the location of his/her most severe 
hyperalgesia, and this location will be used for assessments at all subsequent visits. 
Patients will also be informedof all study restrictions and compliance requirements at visit 1.
Twoblood samples will be collected for pharmac ogenomic anal ysis. Apatient’s refusal to 
provide the pharmacogenomic blood samples will disqualify  the patient from participation in the 
study.
3.11.1.2. Washout Phone Contact (Approximately 1 Week After the Screening Visit)
The washout phone contact will be no more than 2 1days before randomization/first dose of 
study drug, since it takes place 1 week after visit 1 .During the washout phone contact, study
eligibility based on laboratory test results will be reviewed, the initial adverse event inquiry  will 
be performed, rescue medication use (if an y) will be reviewed and recorded as concomitant 
medication, prior/concomitant medications will be reviewed, and as needed, patients will be 
given instructions to washout (discontinue) o ral analgesic therap y,topical pain therapy, or 
non-pharmacologic therapy .
For patients who do not need medication washout , this phone contact will be used for other 
activities needed at this point in the study  (review of eligibility  based on laboratory  test results, 
initial inquiry for adverse events, review and recording of any rescue medication use, review of 
prior/concomitant medications as needed, and scheduling the baseline visit).
3.11.1.3. Washout Period (Variable Duration Period Between the Washout Phone 
Contact and the Baseline Visit)
If needed, a washout period of variable/flexible length will take place, during which the patient 
will discontinue oral analgesic therap y,topical pain therapy , and/or non -pharmacologic therapies
before initiation of the baseline period. The duration of the washout interval will vary  from 
patient to patient, depending on which (if an y) medications need to be discontinued. Please refer 
to Appendix A.
Patients will be provided with acetaminophen (TYLENOL, McNeil Consumer Healthcare 
Division of McNEIL -PPC, Inc) as 325-mg tabletsin bottles of 100 tablets and allowed to take
1to 2tabletsper dose every 6hours, as needed, and up to 6tabletsor 1950 mg per 24-hour day.
No other rescue medications will be provided or allowed from the washout phone contact 
through visit 5 ( day 29, week 4) or the ET visit. During the washout interval, rescue medication 
use (dates of use and dose taken) will be recorded as concomitant medication.
3.11.1.4. Baseline Visit (Visit 2, Day –10, weekday)
All patients who successfully  complete the washout period or who did not need the washout 
period will return to the study  site for a baseline visit (visit 2). The baseline visit marks the 
beginning of the baseline period , and must be confirmed as a weekday  upon scheduling . 
Activities at this visit will include the following:
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia

dispense/collectrescue medication (collect rescue medication from patients not 
eligible to continue in the study ),perform accountability ,and return unused portion to 
patients continuing in the study
provide eligible patient with an eDiaryand instruct patient on its use
review rescue drug compliance
evaluate area of PHN pain for dermal irritation
A patient who does not meet study  entry criteria on the basis of results of baseline assessments 
and is not randomly  assigned to treatment/ enrolled in the study  will not be considered for 
screening again.
At the baseline visit, patients should be instructed to:
record average daily  pain intensity  (over the previous 12 hours [NRS]),in the 
morning and in the evening using eDiary
record rescue pain medication usage for PHN via eDiary (patients will be reminded of 
the restrictions on rescue medication use duringthe baseline period ,and will be
instructed to record any use of rescue medications in the eDiary )
after the baseline visit, record wors t daily pain intensity  (NRS) in the evening using 
eDiary
3.11.2. Randomization Visit (Visit 3, Day 1 , weekday)
Patients who continue to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned a permanent 
unique randomization number and a treatment number using an I RT. These 2 newly assigned 
numbers will be entered into the CRF, and study drug will be dispensed.
The randomization visit occurs on the same day  as the start of study  drug treatment . This visit 
must be confirmed as a weekday  upon scheduling . 
At the randomization visit (visit 3, day  1), eligible patients will be randomly assigned via IRT in 
a 1:1:1 fashion to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 4% w/w TV-45070 ointment, 8% w/w TV-45070 
ointment, or placebo ointment. Randomization will be stratified b y test results of the 
pharmacogenomic sample collected at the screening visit (homozygous minor allele [positive, 
AA], heterozy gous [positive, AG], and homozy gous common allele [negative, GG]) for R1150W 
polymorphism in the SCN9A gene.
The following procedures/ assessments will be performed at visit 3 prior to study  drug dose:
review inclusion/exclusion criteria

At visit 3 (day 1), the area affected by  PHN pain will be carefully  defined by  the investigator and 
the patient by  mapping the area of pain. Dosing of TV -45070 ointment will be prescribed to full y 
coverthe affected area.
The following procedures/assessments will be performed at visit 3 
immediately  prior toorat the time of the first study  drug dose:

ointment) according to the instructions provided by  the study site. Study drug will be applied 
twice dail y(in the morning [0700 ±2 hours] and again in the evening [1900 ±2 hours]) . The first 
dose of study  drug will be applied at the clinic on day  1 during the randomization visit. 
Regardless of the clock time of the first dose application at the randomization visit, the evening 
dose for day  1 should be applied at 1900 ±2 hours. The last dose of stud y drug will be applied at 
home on the evening of day  28. No study  drug will be applied on day  29, the day of visit5

3.11.3.4. Early Termination Visit
For patients who discontinue the study  drug prematurely  (do not complete the per protocol 
treatment period), there will be an ETvisit as soon as possible after the last study  drug 
administration. General procedur es for patients who withdraw prematurel y from the study are 
described in Section 4.3. 
The follow -up visit activities ( Section 3.11.4.2) plus eDiary  and unused study  drug/rescue 
medication collection (and compliance checks) will be conducted at the ET visit , for ET visits 
occurring prior to visit 5 (day  29, week 4). (An ET visit may  also occur after visit 5 but before 
the day that visit 6 would normally  be scheduled, on d ay 57 ±3.) If adverse events or other safet y 
findings are present at the ET visit, the clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at 
suitable intervals until resolved or stabilized or returned to baseline, until the patient is referred 
to the care of a health care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the stud y 
drug or study procedure is made. Otherwise, the ET visit will be the last study  visit for these 
patients.
Because premature discontinuations of treatment may  occur at any time between randomization 
and the week 4 visit (visit 5, day  29), patients will be permitted to proceed directly  from either 
visit 3 (day 1, randomization) , visit 4 (day 15 ±1, week 2), or visit 5 (day  29, week 4) to the ET 
visit. For example, a patient who discontinues study  drug on day  20 will have visit 4 ( day15 ±1, 
week 2) followed by  visit 6 (ET) as soon as possible after day  20 with no visit 5 (day 29, week 4) 
in between.
The following procedures/assessments will be performed at the ET visit:
perform adverse event inquiry
review prior/concomitant medications

74cc.There is an y other reason that would make the patient, in the opinion of eith er the 
investigator or the Sponsor, unsuitable for the study .
4.3. Justification of Key Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
The inclusion criteria for this study have been selected to identify  an appropriate patient 
population to evaluate the efficacy  of topical T V-45070 in PHN . The exclusion criteria have 
been selected to exclude patients with characteristics that would put them at risk if they  
participated in the stud y, and to exclude patients with potentially  confounding characteristics that 
would make data inte rpretation difficult.
4.4. Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki ( and/orwith the applicable country ’s acceptance), 
each patient is free to withdraw from the study  and/or study  drug treatment at any  time. The 
investigator also has the right to withdraw a patient from the study  and/or study  drug treatment in 
the event of intercurrent illness, adverse events, pregnancy  (see Section7.3.4.1), other reasons 
concerning the health or well -being of the patient, or lack of cooperation. In addition, a patient 
may be withdrawn from the study  and/or drug treatment as described in Sections3.9,3.5,and 
7.1.7.
Should a patient decide to withdraw (from either the study  or study drug treatment) after starting 
study drug or should the investigator decide to withdraw the patient at s uch time, all reasonable 
efforts will be made to complete and report all observations up to the time of withdrawal. A 
complete final evaluation at the time of the patient’s withdrawal should be made ,and an 
explanation given as to why  the patient is withdr awing or being withdrawn from the study  and/or 
study drug treatment.
The reason for and date of withdrawal from study and/or study drug treatment must be recorded 
on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF. If a patient withdraws consent, eve ry 
attempt will be made to determine the reason. If the reason for withdrawal is an adverse event or 
a clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  test result, monitoring will be continued at the 
discretion of the investigator (eg, until the event has resol ved or stabilized, until the patient is 
referred to the care of another health care professional, or until a determination of a cause 
unrelated to the stud y drug or stud y procedure is made). The specific event(s) or test result(s) 
must be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF. In addition, a 
blood sample will be obtained for the measurement of study  drug concentrations. The sample 
date and time will be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF. 
An ET visi t should be conducted within 2 weeks after the last stud y drug administration. The 
activities for the ET visit are described in Section3.11.3.4. Because premature discontinuations 
of treatment may  occur at any  time between randomization and the week 4 visit (visit 5, day  29), 
patients will be permitted to proceed directl y from either visit 3 ( day 1, randomization) or visit 4 
(day 15 ±1, week 2) to the ET visit. For example, a patient who discontinues study  drug on day  
20 will have visit 4 ( day 15 ±1, week 2) followed by  visit 6 (ET) within 2 weeks after day  20 
with no visit 5 (day  29, week 4) in between.
Data from an y efficacy evaluations performed after the specified time will not be collected on 
the CRF; in the event, however, if such data are collected, these data will not be anal yzed. 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070-CNS-20013
75Patients with ongoing adverse events or clinicall y significant abnor mal laboratory  test results (as 
interpreted b y the investigator) will be monitored as described in Section 7.1.2and Section 7.3, 
respectivel y.
A patient who is randomly  assigned to treatment (enters the double -blind treatment period) but 
fails to complete the double -blind treatment period will not be replaced. Measures will be taken 
to increase the recruitment rate, as needed ,to ensure that a minimum of 330 patients 
(110patients per treatment arm) are randoml y assigned to treatment and 264 patients (up to 
approximately  88 patients per treatment arm) complete the double -blind treatment period and are 
evaluable for the primary efficacy  analysis.

765. TREATMENT OF PATIENTS
5.1. Drugs Administered During the Study
At the baseline/randomization visit, eligible patients will be randomly  assigned to 1 of 
3treatment groups (4% w/w TV-45070 ointment, 8% w/w TV-45070 ointment, or placebo 
ointment) as described in Section 3.4.Blinded study drug will be a pplied twice dail yto the area 
of PHN pain during the treatment period from day s1 through 28, as described in Sections 3.6
and 3.11.3.
Study drug will be packaged in tubesand provided for patients to applyathome (see 
Section3.6). Patients will be instructed to store the tube of ointment at ambient room 
temperature (15°C to 25°C) at home. Study drug exposure will be measured, and compliance to 
study drug administrati on will be monitored. Compliance will be assessed by  weighing tubes at 
visit 3 (baseline) , visit 4 (day  15 ±1, week 2),andvisit5 (day 29, week 4 )or ET visit. A patient 
will be considered compliant during the interval between the previous 2 visits if th e tube weighs 
between 70% and 120% of the expected weight.
Each patient will be given an eDiary and instructions on using it to record daily  pain (11-point 
NRS), the date/time of study  drug applications, and rescue medication usage. The eDiary  will be 
used to record responses to an 11 -point NRS before appl ying the study  drugtwice dail y. Patients 
will apply  the study  drug in the morning after recording the morning responses to the 11 -point 
NRS at 0700 ±2 hours, and in the evening aft er recording the responses to the 11- point NRS at 
1900 ±2 hours.
Patients (and caregivers, as applicable) will receive instructions on how to apply  the study  drug. 
Under stud y site staff supervision, the area affected by  PHN pain will be carefull y defined by 
mapping the area of pain, and dosing will be prescribed to fully  cover the affected area. Dosing 
cards and instructions will be provided on how to measure the appropriate amount of ointment 
for each application. A laminated instruction sheet, including pictures, will describe and illustrate 
how the ointment is to be spread over the entire area of PHN pain in a thin lay er that full y covers 
the area and gentl y massaged into the skin.
The first application of study  drug will occur at the study  site on the day  of the randomization 
visit (visit 3, day 1). The study  coordinator or designated site staff member will apply  blinded 
study drug and will define the amount of ointment to be used for all subsequent treatment 
applications for that patient. Subsequent study  drug applications will be performed by  the patient 
at home. (If the affected area is not within reach of application b y the patient [such as the 
posterior thoracic region], the patient’s designated caregiver will appl y the ointment, but the 
patient will record the time of application in the eDiary .)
Patients will return to the study  site for visit 4 (day 15 ±1, week 2) and again for visit 5 (day 29, 
week 4). At visit 4, 2 blood samples will be taken from each patient for pharmacokinetic 
analysis:the first sample taken within approximately  1 to 4 hours after the dose of study  drug in 
the morning and the second sample taken approximately  2hours after collection of the first 
sample. Patients will go to the study  site afterapplying study drug at home so that the 
2pharmacokinetic samples can be taken.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070-CNS-20013
77At visit 5, the eDiary  will be collected along with the tubes of study  drug and bottles of rescue 
medication. Patients will be instructed to return to their primary  care physician to resume therapy  
deemed appropriate for their PHN.
5.2. Restrictions
Patients will be required to comply  with the following restrictions with respect to activity :
After appl ying ointment, patients should wait for 10 minutes before covering the area 
with clothing, to allow the oint ment to be absorbed by the skin. After the ointment 
has fully penetrated the skin, the area will be dry .
After appl ying ointment, patients must not apply  pressure to the area of skin treated 
with ointment by leaning aga inst surfaces, such as furniture, for10 minutes,to allow 
the ointment to be absorbed by  the skin. After the ointment has fully  penetrated the 
skin, the area will be dry .
In addition, patients must maintain (hold constant) their current level of physical activity  from 
the baseline visit through the end of treatment (visit 5, day 29, week 4).
5.3. Prior and Concomitant Therapy or Medication
Any prior or concomitant t herapy or medication that a patient has had within 90 daysbefore 
study drug administration and up to the end of the study period, including follow -up, will be 
recorded on the CRF . Generic or trade name, indication, and dosage will be recorded . The 
Sponsorwill encode all therap y and medication according to the World Health Organization 
drug dictionary  (WHODrug).
The following medications will not be allowed during this study :
Oral analgesics
Topical analgesics, including lidocaine (gels, creams and patches) and capsaicin 
patches
Rescue pain medication exc ept permitted acetaminophen rescue
Class Ic anti-arrhythmic drugs such as flecainide or propafenone
At each clinic visit after the screening visit, the investigator will ask patient swhether they  have 
takenany medications (other than study  drug), including OTC medications, vitamins, or herbal 
or nutritional supplements, s ince the previous visit. Indication, dosage, and start and end dates 
should be entered on the CRF. 
5.4. Rescue Medications for PHN Pain
Patients will be provided with acetaminophen (TYLENOL, McNeil Consumer Healthcare 
Division of McNEIL -PPC, Inc) as 325-mg tabletsin bottles of 100 tablets and allowed to take 
1to 2 tabletsper dose every  6 hours, as needed, and up to 6tabletsor 1950mg per da y (over a 
24-hour period) for rescue relief of PHN pain. Rescue medication will be provided at the 
screening visit. Rescue medication compliance will be checked at all visits until used rescue 
medication is collected after the baseline pain assessment inte rval for patients not continuing in 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070-CNS-20013
78the study, at visit 5 ( day 29, week 4) for patients who complete the treatment period, or at the ET 
visit for patients who prematurely  discontinue study  drug.
No other rescue medications will be provided or allowed from the washout phone contact 
through visit 5 ( day 29, week 4) or the ET visit. Patients will not be permitted to use rescue 
medication during the baseline pain assessment interval (day s –10 through –1) and during the 
final week of treatment (the 7 -day period before visit 5) . During the washout interval, rescue 
medication use (dates of use and dose taken ) will be recorded as concomitant medication. During 
baseline and the treatment period, rescue medication use will be recorded using the eDiary .
5.5. Procedures for Monitoring Patient Compliance
Eachinvestigator or designeewill be responsible for monitoring patient compliance . Study drug 
exposure will be measured, and compliance to study  drug administration will be monitored by  
weighing the tubes of blinded study  drug at the week 2 (visit 4, day  15 ±1) and week 4 (visit 5, 
day 29) or ET visits. (At visit 3, the tubes will be weighed to obtain a baseline weight.) A patient 
will be considered compliant during the interval between the previous 2 visits if the tube weigh s 
between 70% and 120% of the expected weight. Also, study  drug accountability  records will be 
completed . Patients will not be discontinued for noncompliance at week 2 (visit 4, day  15 ±1);
however, theywill be retrained in proper medication dispensing.
5.6. Total Blood Volume
The total amount of blood drawn during the stud y from each patient will be approximately  
50mL.

Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070-CNS-20013
796. ASSESSMENT OFEFFICACY
6.1. Primary Efficacy Variable
The primary  efficacy endpoint for this study  is the change from baseline to week 4 in the weekl y 
average of the daily  average NRS scores (the daily average NRS score is the average of dail y 
morning and evening patient-reported measurements) of average pain intensity over the prior 
12hours.
The NRS is a widely-used, standard one-dimensional scale from 0 to 10 for patient self- reporting 
of pain.
6.2. Secondary Efficacy Variables
The secondary  efficacy endpoints, including those defined using the NePIQoL , DSIS, NPSI, and 
PGIC,are listed in Section 3.3.2.
6.3. Exploratory Efficacy Variables
The exploratory  efficacy endpoints are described in Section3.3.3.
6.4. Methods and Timing of Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing 
Efficacy and Clinical Pharmacology Data
Methods for assessing efficacy  data are described in Section 3.3. Methods for obtaining samples 
for pharmacokinetic analy ses are described in Section 3.3.6. Methods for obtaining samples for 
pharmacogenomic anal yses are described in Section3.3.8. Timing of assessing efficacy , 
pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenomic data are discussed in Section 3.11. Procedures for 
recording efficacy  data are discussed in Section 13.1 , and methods of analyses of the efficacy  
data are discussed in Section9.6. Procedures for obtaining pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacogenomic assay  results and anal yzing the data are described in separate document s. The 
population pharmacokinetic anal yses results (including analy ses of the effects of allelic variants 
of CYP3A4 and/or CYP2C19, if performed) will be reported separatel y from the main study  
results.

Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070-CNS-20013
807. ASSESSMENT OFSAFETY
In this stud y, safety will be as sessed by qualified study  staff by evaluating the following: 
reported adverse events, clinical laboratory  test results, vital signs measurements, ECG findings, 
physical examination findings (including body  weight measurements), dermal irritation findings, 
and concomitant medication usage.
7.1. Adverse Events 
7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event
An adverse event is an y untoward m edical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical 
product, regardless of whether it has a causal relationship with this treatment . 
In thisstudy, any adverse event occurring after the clinical study  patient has signed the ICF
should be recorded and reported as an adverse event . Any adverse event occurring after the first 
application of study  drug is considered a tr eatment-emergent adverse event .
An adverse event can, therefore, be an y unfavorable and unintended ph ysical sign, s ymptom, or 
laboratory  parameter that develops or worsens in severit y during the course of the study, or 
significant worsening of the disease under study  or ofany concurrent disease , whether or not 
considered related to the study  drug. A new condition or the worsening of a pre -existing 
condition will be considered an adverse event . Stable chronic conditions (such as arthritis) that 
are present before study  entry and do not worsen during the study  will not be considered adverse 
events. 
Worsening of the disease under study  will be measured by  increased PHN pain scores . 
Worsening of PHN should be recorded as an adverse event onl y if the presentation and/or 
outcomeis more severe than would normally  be expected from the normal course of the disease 
in a particular patient.
Accordingl y, an adverse event caninclude any  of the following:
Intercurrent illnesses.
Physical injuries .
Events possibly  related to concomitant medication .
Significant worsening (change in nature, severit y, or frequency ) of the disease under 
study or other pre- existing conditions . Note: A condition recorded as pre- existingthat 
is intermittently  symptomatic (eg, headache) and thatoccurs during t he study should 
be recorded as an adverse event.
Drug interactions.
Events occurring during diagnostic procedures or during any washout phase of the 
study.
Laboratory  or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient 
from the study , areassociated with clinical signs and sy mptoms or a serious adverse 
event, or require medical treatment or further diagnostic work- up, or are considered 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070-CNS-20013
81by the investigator to be clinically  significant . Note: Abnormal laboratory  test results 
at the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the stud y or receiving study 
treatment are not considered adverse events but will be evaluated to monito r data
from patients who do not meet screening criteria . 
All events of possible drug -induced liver injury  with hyperbilirubinemia (defined as 
aspartate aminotransferase[ AST]or alanine aminotransferase [ALT] ≥3 times the 
upper limit of the normal range [ULN] plus either bilirubin ≥2 times the ULN or 
International Normalized Ratio [ INR]>1.5) or Hy ’s Law events require immediate 
study treatment cessation and reporting as a serious adverse event.
7.1.2. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events
For adverse event re cording, the stud y period is define d for each patient as that time period from 
signature of the ICFthrough the end of the follow- up period. For this study, the follow -up period 
ends with the day  57 (±3) follow-up visit (visit 6) or ET visit,or it ends wh en a patient is 
confirmed as lost to follow -up. A patient is confirmed as lost to follow -up after all reasonable 
efforts to locate the patient have failed.
All adverse events that occur during the defined study  period must be recorded on the source 
documen
tation and transcribed onto the CRF, regardless of the severit y of the event or judged 
relationship to the study  drug. For serious adverse events, the Serious Adverse Event Form must 
also be completed ,and the serious adverse event must be reported immedia tely (see 
Section7.1.5.3.1). The investigator does not need to activel y monitor subjects for adverse events 
once the studyhas ended. Serious adverse events occurring to a patientafter the follow- up period
should be reported to the Sponsorif the investigator becomes aware of them, following the 
procedure s described in Se ction 7.1.5.3.1.
At each contact with the patient, the investigator or designee must query  the patient for adverse 
events by  asking an open -ended question such as “Have you had an y unusual symptoms or 
medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe.” All reported or observed signs and 
symptoms will be recorded individually , except when considered manifestations of a medical 
condition or disease state . A precise diagnosis will be recorded w henever possible . When such a 
diagnosis is made, all related signs, s ymptoms, and any  test findings will be recorded collectivel y 
as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, on the Serious Adverse 
Event Form.
The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until resolved or 
stabilized or returned to baseline, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care 
professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the stud y drug or study procedure is 
made.
The onset and end dates and times, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 
24hours), action taken regarding stud y drug, treatment administered, and outcome for each 
adverse event must be recorded on the source do cumentation and transcribed onto the CRF . 
The relationship of each adverse event to study  drug treatment and study  procedures, and the 
severity and seriousness of each adverse event, as judged b y the investigator, must be recorded 
as described below.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070-CNS-20013
827.1.3. Severity of an Adverse Event
The severit y of each adverse event must be recorded as 1 of the choices on the following scale:
Mild: No limitation of usual activities
Moderate : Some limitation of usual activities
Severe: Inability to carry out usual activ ities
7.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Study Drug
The relationship of an adverse event to the study  drug is characterized as follows:
Term Definition Clarification
No reasonable 
possibility
(not related)This category applies to adverse 
events that, after careful 
consideration, are clearly due to 
extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc) or to adverse 
events that, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are 
evaluated, are judged to be unrelated 
to the study drug.The relationship of an adverse eventmay be considered 
“no reasonable possibility ”if it is clearly du e to 
extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply :
Itdoes not follow  a reasonable temporal sequence 
from the administration of the test drug.
Itcould readily have been produced by the patient’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other 
modes of therapy administered to the patient.
Itdoes not follow  a known pattern of response to the 
test drug. 
Itdoes not reappear or w orsen when the drug is 
re-administered.
Reasonable 
possibility
(related)This category applies to adverse 
events for which, after careful 
medical consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, a connection with 
the test drug administration cannot be 
ruled out with certainty.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered 
“reasonable possibility ”if at least 2 of the following
apply:
Itfollows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the drug.
Itcannot be reasonably explained by the known 
characteristics of the patient’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the patient.
Itdisappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in 
dose. There are important exceptions when an 
adverse event does not disappear up on 
discontinuation of the drug, yet drug -relatedness 
clearly exists.
Itfollows a known pattern of response to the test 
drug.
7.1.5. Serious Adverse Events
7.1.5.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at an y dose that results in any  of the 
following outcomes or actions:
Death.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070-CNS-20013
83Alife-threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred); does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might h ave caused death .
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization , whichmeans that 
hospital inpatient admission and/or prolongation of hospital stay were required for 
treatment of an adverse event or that they  occurred as a consequence of the event. 
Hospitalizations scheduled for an elective procedure or for treatment of a pre -existing 
condition that has not worsened during participation in the study  will not be 
considered serious adverse events . 
Persistent or significant di sability or incapacity  (refers to a substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions) .
Acongenital anomal y/birth defect .
An important medical event that may  not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization but m ay jeopardize the patient and may  require medical 
intervention to prevent oneof the outcomes listed in this definition . Examples of such 
events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm ,blood dyscrasias or convulsi ons that do not result in hospitalization,
or the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse . Note: Any suspected 
transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an important 
medical event.
An adverse event that does not meet an y of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be 
regarded as a nonserious adverse event.
7.1.5.2. Expectedness
A serious adverse event that is not included in reference safet y information for topical TV -45070 
by its specificit y, severity, outcome, or frequenc yis considered an unexpected adverse event.
The reference safet y information for this study is located in the TV -45070 Investigator’s 
Brochure.
The Sponsor’s Global Patient Safety  & Pharmacovigilance Department will determine the 
expectedness for all serious adverse events.
7.1.5.3. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event
7.1.5.3.1. Investigator Responsibility
To satisfy regulatory  requirements, a ll serious adverse events (as described in Section7.1.5.1) 
that occur during the study period (including the protocol- defined follow -up period), regardless 
of judged relationship to treatment with the study  drug, must be reported to the Sponsorby the 
investigator within 24 hours w hen the in vestigator learns about it or, if the event occurs on a 
weekend or national holiday , on the next working day .Completing the Serious Adverse Event 
Form and reporting the event must not be delay ed, even if not all the information is available .
The investigator does not need to activel y monitor subjects for adverse events once the studyhas 
ended. Serious adverse events occurring to a patientafter the follow -up period should be 
reported to the Sponsorif the investigator becomes aware of them .
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070-CNS-20013
84The Serious Adverse E vent Form should be sent to the Sponsor ’s local safety officer (L SO); for 
this study , the LSO is the Teva USA Pharmacovigilance Department.
The following information should be provided to record the event accurately  and completel y:
study number (Study TV45070- CNS-20013)
investigator and study site identification
patient number
onset date and description of adverse event
investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the study  drug 
(no reasonable possibility , reasonablepossibility )
Additional information may  include the following:
age and sex of the patient
date of first dose of study drug
date and amount of last administered dose of study drug
action taken
outcome, if known
severity
concomitant therap y (including doses, routes, and regimens) and treatment of the 
event
pertinent laboratory  or other diagnostic test data 
medical history
results of dechallenge/rechallenge, if known
for an adverse event result ingin death: 
cause of death (whether or not the death was related to study  drug)
autopsy findings (if available)
Each report of a serious adverse event will be reviewed and evaluated by the investigator and the 
Sponsorto assess the nature of the event and the relationship of the event to the study  drug, study 
procedures, and underl ying disease . 
Additional information (follow -up) about an y serious adverse event unavailable at the initial 
reporting should be forwarded b y the study sitewithin 24 hours when it becomes known to the 
same address as the initial report. 
The LSOwill be responsible for submission of the MedWatch form 3500/ Council for 
International Organizations of Medical Sciences ( CIOMS)form/XML  fileto the regulatory  
authorities. In EU countries, the L SO will distribute for local submis sion to International Ethics 
Committees ( IECs)/IRBs and investigators according to regulations. In non-EU countries, 
serious adverse events willbe reported b y the Sponsoror designee ( contract research 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070-CNS-20013
85organization [CRO]) to investigators. The investigators should report the serious adverse events 
to their local I RB as dictated by  their board’s policies and procedures.
The study drug blinding will be maintained for the people who are involved directly  in the study . 
Therefore, in case of a suspected unexpec ted serious adverse reaction (SUSAR), only  the LSO 
will receive the unblinded report for regulatory submission; the others will receive a blinded 
report. 
Note: Although pregnancy is not a serious adverse event, the process for reporting a pregnancy  is 
thesame as that for reporting a serious adverse event but using the pregnancy form(see 
Section7.2). 
7.1.5.3.2. Sponsor Responsibility
If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the stud y drug or study  
procedures, the Sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify  all investigators participating in 
sponsored clinical studies of TV -45070and the appropriate regulatory authorities. 
In addition to notify ing the investigators and regulatory  authorities, other measures may  be 
required, including the following:
alteringexisting re search by  modifyingthe protocol
discontinuing or suspending the study
alteringthe process of informed consent by  modifyingthe existing consent form and 
informing current stud y participants of new findings
modifyinglistings of expected toxicities to inc lude adverse events newl y identified as 
related to TV-45070
7.1.6. Protocol-Defined Adverse Events for Expedited Reporting
No protocol-defined adverse events for expedited reporting were identified for this study .
7.1.7. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event
Any patient who experiences an adverse event may  be withdrawn from study drugtreatment at 
any time at the discretion of the investigator . If a patient is withdrawn wholly or in part because 
of an adverse event, both the adverse events page and the termination page of the CRF will be 
completed at that time. If possible , a blood sample will be obtained for the measurement of stud y 
drug concentrations.
The patient will be monitored at the discretion of the investigator (eg, until the event has 
resolved or sta bilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional, or 
until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study  drug or study  procedure is made). The 
investigator must inform the CPP/CL  as soon a s possible of all patients who a re being considered 
for withdrawal due to adverse events . Additional reports must be provided when requested.
If a patient is w ithdrawn from study  drugtreatment and/or the study  for multiple reasons that 
include adverse events, the termination page of the CRF should indicate that the withdrawal was 
related to an adverse event . An exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an 
adverse event that,in the opinion of the investigator ,is not severe enough to warrant 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070-CNS-20013
86discontinuation but that requires the use of a prohibited medication, thereb y requiring 
discontinuation of the patient . In such a case, the reason for discontinuation would be need to 
take a prohibited medication, not the adverse event.
7.1.8. Medical Emergencies
Medical emergencies must be reported to the individual identified in the Clinical Study 
Personnel C ontact Information section of this protocol.
Equipment, supplies, and properl y skilled medical personnel must be accessible for an adverse 
event requiring im mediate treatment. An y dose of study  drug (whether the investigational 
product, reference therapy, or a placebo), whether taken intentionally  or unintentionally , in 
excess of that prescribed must be immediately  reported to the Sponsor. When the identification 
of the study  drug must be known, the investigator must follow the procedures outlined in 
Section3.5. 
7.1.9. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event
If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency , departures from the protocol 
may be allowed on a case -by-case basis . After stabilization and/or treatmen t hasbeen 
administered to ensure patient safet y, the investigator or other ph ysician in attendance must 
contact the individual identified in the Clinical Study  Personnel Contact Information section of 
this protocol as soon as possible to discuss the situation. The investigator, in consultation with 
the Sponsor , will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in the study . Any 
departures from the proto col because of adverse events mus t be noted on the CRF and in source 
documents, along with the reason for such departures. 
7.2. Pregnancy 
All pregnancies ( pregnancies of women participating in the study  and female partners of men 
participating in the stud y) that occur during the study , or within 30days of completion of the 
study, are to be reported immediately  to the individual identified in the Clinical Study Personnel 
Contact Information section of this protocol, and the investigator must provide the LSO with the 
Clinical Trial pregnancy  form.The process for reporting a pregnancy  is the same as that for 
reporting a serious adverse event (see Section 7.1.5.3). 
Any patient becoming pregnant duri ng the study  will be withdrawn from study  drug treatment.
All patients (or female partnersof male patients ) who become pregnant will be monitored to the
completion or termination of the pregnancy . If the pregnancy  continues to term, the outcome 
(health of the infant up to 8 weeks of age), details of birth, and presence or absence of any  birth 
defect, congenital ab normalities, or mat ernal and newborn complications will be reported to the 
Sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy  will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse 
event, as appropriate.
If the pregnancy  does not continue to term, 1 of the following actions will be taken:
For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event .
For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse 
event.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070-CNS-20013
87For an elective abortion notdue to developmental anomalies, report on the pr egnancy 
form.
7.3. Clinical Laboratory Tests
All clinical laboratory  test results outside of the reference range will be interpreted b y the 
investigator as belonging to 1 of the following categories:
abnormal but not a clinically  significant worsening
abnormal and a clinicall y significant worsening
A laboratory  test result that has significantly  worsened (according to medical judgment) from the 
baseline result will be recorded o n the source documentation, transcribed onto the CRF as an 
adverse event ,and monitor ed as described in Section7.1.2.Anadverse event includes a 
laboratory  or diagnostic test abnormality  (once confirmed by  repeat testing) that resu lts in the 
withdrawal of the patient from the study , the temporary  or permanent cessation of treatment with 
study drug, or medical treatment or further diagnostic work-up.
Clinical laboratory  tests (serum chemistry  and hematology ) and urinal ysis will be pe rformed at 
the time points indicated in Table1. The clinical laboratory  tests will be performed using a 
central laboratory , with more details provided in the Laboratory Procedures Manual for this 
study. The urinaly sis will be done macroscopically at the study  site with a dipstick provided by  
the central laboratory . If any portion of the dipstick is positiv e, the urine sample will be sent to 
the central lab oratoryfor microscopic evaluation. The dipstick results will be recorded in the 
CRF. Specific laboratory tests to be performed are listed below . 
7.3.1. Serum Chemistry

7.3.4. Other Clinical Laboratory Tests
Other clinical laboratory  tests will be performed to ensure the safet y of the patients but will not
be used to assess the safety  of the stud y drug.
7.3.4.1. Pregnancy Tests
Urine pregnancy  testswill be performed at the study  site (with test kits provided by a central 
laboratory ) for all women of child- bearing potential at screening (visit 1) , randomization (visit 3 , 
day 1), visit 4 (day  15 ±1, week 2), visit 5 (day 29, week 4), and at the follow -up/ET visit 
(visit6, day 57 ±3). Any patient who becomes pregnant during the stud y will be withdrawn. 
Procedures for reporting the pregnancy  are provided in Section7.2. 
7.3.4.2. Urine Drug Screen
A urine drug screen will be performed at the time points indicated in Table1. The urine drug 
screenincludes a means to detect the presence of drugs prohi bited according to the protocol , 
including cannabinoids, cocaine, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepine, and opiates . If a 
parameter noted above cannot be tested using urine, an alternative matrix ( eg, serum) may  be 
considered acceptable . The Sponsor’s medical expert must be made aware in advance of, and 
provide approval for ,drug screen parameters to which this will apply . A positive result for any  of 
the above drugs or their metabolites, without medical explanation, will preclude the patient from

7.4. Vital Signs
Vital signs will be measured at the time points indicated in Table1. Vital signs include the 
following:
heart rate
respiration rate
body temperature
blood pressure
Before pulse and blood pressure are measured, the patient must be in a supine or seated pos ition
and resting for at least 5 minutes. (The same position and arm should be used each time vital 
signs are measured for a given patient.) For any abnormal vital sign finding, the measurement 
should be repeated as soon as possible . Any vital sign value t hat is judged by  the investigator as 
a clinically  significant change (worsening) froma baseline value will be considered an adverse

928. ASSESSMENT OF  PHARMACOKINETICS /
PHARMACODYNAM ICS/PHARMACOGENOMICS
8.1. Pharmacok inetic Variables
Samples (plasma) will be anal yzed for TV -45070 using an appropriate validated method.
The dates and times of study  drug administration and the date and time of each pharmacokinetic 
sample must be well documented on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF .
Samples will be collected into K 2EDTA VACUTAINER®(Becton, Dickinson and Company ) 
tubes, inverted slowly  6 to 8 times to mix the contents, and placed on ice (0°C to 5°C). Blood 
samples will be centrifuged (1500 ×g, approximately  10 minutes, 0°C to 5°C) within 1 hour 
after sampling. If a refrigerated cen trifuge is not available, samples should be chilled before 
centrifugation. As needed, other measures should be taken to prevent samples from heating 
significantl y during centrifugation. Separated plasma will be transferred in approximately equal 
portions i nto 2 opaque, labeled, polyprop ylene tubes (sets A and B).
Sample labels should include the study number, patient identification number, visit number, 
nominal collection time, set (A or B), and indication that they  are pharmacokinetic samples. 
Plasma sampl es will be placed on ice (0°C to 5°C) in an upright position until they  are frozen at 
–70°C within 1 hour of centrifugation. 
Plasma samples for all patients will be shipped from the study  siteto the central laboratory  upon 
the Sponsor ’s request and will be shipped in batch shipments to the central laboratory  designated 
in the Study  Laboratory  Manual. Samples will be stored in an upright position at -70°C until 
assayed. The laboratory  will be notified before the shipment of the samples and will be sent the
shipping information when the samples are shipped.
Set A samples will be transported, frozen with sufficient dry  ice for 4 day s, by next day courier 
to TevaPharmaceutical Works P.L td.Co. as described in the Study  Laboratory  Manual. 
Set B samples will be shipped and stored as described in the Study  Laboratory  Manual.
Sample shipments should be sent no later in the week than Wednesday morning for next day  
delivery. Samples are not to arrive on the weekend.
Further details for sample collecting, handling, s hipping, and storage are provided in the Study  
Laboratory  Manual.
8.2. Pharmacodynamic Variables
Pharmacod ynamic endpoints assessed during the study  are the secondary  efficacy endpoints 
change from baseline in maximal intensity  of patients’ brush- evoked allody nia and change from 
baseline in maximal intensity  of patients’ punctate-evoked hyperalgesia.
8.3. Pharmacogenomic Variables
It is recognized that genomic variation within the population can be an important contributory  
factor to inter -individual differences in d rug response. Pharmacogenomic analy ses investigate 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070-CNS-20013
93the association between genetic sequence pol ymorphisms and/or gene expression signatures and 
clinical response to a certain therapeutic intervention. Pharmacogenomic results may  help 
explain inter -individual variability and subsequently  identify population subgroups that respond 
differently to the drug. Furthermore, regulatory guidance and white papers indicate that 
pharmacogenomic anal yses employ ing DNAcollected from all study  participants may  support 
investigation of unexpected adverse events. 
The objectives of the pharmacogenomic anal yses in this study  are as follows:
To genotype the underly ing R1150W poly morphism in the SCN9Agene so as to 
stratify patients according to R1150W poly morphism status (homo zygous minor 
allele [positive, AA], heterozy gous [positive, AG], and homozy gous common allele 
[negative, GG]) in the randomization
  
 
 
To genotype polymorphisms of the CY P3A4and CYP2C19genes as potential 
covariates in the population pharmacokinetic analysis
Individual patients will be genot yped for the R1150W poly morphism for randomization 
allocation purposes. Pharmacogenomic samples will be stored for a period of up to 15 y ears after
the last patient last visit in the study  and then destroy ed.  
Pharmacogenomic assessment will be performed using blood samples of 1 2mL total volume,
collected in 2 K3EDTA Vacutainer plastic tubes for pharmacog enomic analy sis (1 sample will be 
used for the R1150W randomization test and the other for further pharmacogenomic anal yses). 
Pharmacogenomic samples will be collected from all patients at the screening visit (visit 1) 
because randomization will be stratif ied based on R1150W poly morphism status. The samples 
may also be examined for other sequence variations in the SCN9Agene region and/or other 
genes.  
 
A patient’s refusal to have this blood sample taken will exclude him/her from 
participation in this study .
Pharmacogenomic samples will be sent to the central laboratory  within 72 hours after collection. 
Further details for sample collecting, handling, shipping, and storage will beprovided in the 
Study Laboratory  Manual.
The R1150W poly morphism test will be done at the central laboratory , a Clinical L
aboratory  
Improvement Am endments- certified laboratory , and the exact genoty ping assay  will be selected 
in discussion with the laboratory  staff. The laboratory  for the testing of other genetic variations 
will be selected after the start of this study  (TV45070- CNS-20013) and will b e performed if and 
when required. The laboratory  for these other analy ses will be selected according to the nature of 
the analyses.

Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070-CNS-20013
949. STATISTICS
9.1. Study Design and Randomization
This is a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study to ev aluate the 
efficacy and safet y of TV-45070 treatment in patients with PHN . Patients will be randomly 
assigned to receive treatment with 4% w/wTV-45070 ointment, 8% w/w TV-45070 ointment, or 
matching placebo ointment in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomization will be as described in Section 3.4.
9.2. Sample Size and Power Considerations
In prior studies of gabapentin or pregabalin treatment of PHN, the difference in mean pain scores 
between active-and placebo -treated groups ranged from 1.0 ( Rice et al 2001 ) to 1.3 (Dworkin et 
al 2003). For this decision- making, proof -of-concept study , it is reasonable to use a conservative 
estimate of 1.0. If we assume a standard deviation of 2.35, a sample size of 88 per arm (a total of 
264 patients) would be needed to provide 80% power with a 2 -sided test at 5% significance level 
to detect a 1.0 -point difference. A ssuming an approximately  20% dropout rate, 110 patients per 
arm (a total of 330 patients) will be randomly  assigned to each treatment group. During the 
study, the ultimate sample size may  be adjusted on the basis of the actual dropout rate.
9.3. Analysis Sets/Populations 
9.3.1. Intent-to-Treat Population
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all r andomized patients. In this population, 
treatment will be assigned based on the treatment to which patients were randomized, regardless 
of which treatment they  actually received.
9.3.2. Safety Population
The safety population will include all randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of study
drug. In this population, treatment will be assigned based upon the treatment patients actually 
receive, regardless of the treatment to which they  were randomized. 
9.3.3. Full Analysis Set
The full anal ysis set (FAS) ,definedasall patients in the I TT population (all patients randomly  
assigned to treatment) wh oreceive at least 1 dose of study  drug and have at least 1 post -baseline 
efficacy assessment ,will be used for all efficacy  analyses. Summaries will be presented by  
treatment group. The FAS will serve as the primary  analysis set for efficacy anal yses.
9.3.4. Per Protocol Population
The PP population will include all subjects in the FAS who have not had major protocol 
deviations (ie , protocol violations). Protocol violations wil l be determined before unblinding. 
The PP Popul ation will serve as the suppor tive population for efficacy  analyses.

10011. QUALITY CONTROL ANDQUALITY ASSURANCE
11.1. Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations and Violations
11.1.1. Protocol Amendments
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opinion of a written amendmen t by the IRB, except when necessary  to 
address immediate safet y concerns to the patients or when the change involves only 
nonsubstantial logistics or administration . Theprincipal investigator and the Sponsorwill sign 
the protocol amendment. 
11.1.2. Protocol Deviations
A protocol deviation is any  change, divergence, or departure from the study  design or procedures 
defined in the protocol.
Important protocol deviations, referred to as protocol violations, are a subset of protocol 
deviations that may  significant ly impact the completeness, accuracy , and/or reliability  of the 
study data or that may  significantly  affect a patient's rights, safety , or well-being. Protocol 
violations include enrolling patients in violation of key  eligibility  criteria designed to ensur e a 
specific subject population; failing to collect data necessary  to interpret primary  endpoints; 
noncompliance to study drug administration; use of prohibited medications; or any  other 
deviations that may  have an impact on the processes put in place for the care and safet y of the 
patients or compromise the scientific value of the trial. Protocol violations will be identified and 
recorded b y study site personnel on the CRF . All protocol violations will be reported to the
responsible IEC/IRB, as required.
When a protocol violation is reported, the Sponsorwill determine whether to discontinue the 
patient from the study  or permit the patient to continue in the study , with documented approval 
from the medical representative . The decision will be based on ensur ing the safet y of the patient 
and preserving the integrity  of the stud y. 
Deviations from the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the protocol are notprospectively  granted by  
the Sponsor . If studysite personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol eligibility  
criteria was entered into a study , they must immediately  inform the Sponsorof the protocol 
violation. If such patient has already completed the study or has withdrawn earl y, no action will 
be taken but the violation will be recorded. If such patient is still participating in the stud y, a 
determination will be made by  the sponsor and the investigator as to whether it is in the best 
interest of the patient to continue in the study .
11.2. Information to Study Personnel
Eachinvestigator is responsible for giving information about the study  to all staff members 
involved in the study  or in any  element of patient management, both before starting the study  and 
during the course of the study  (eg, when new staff become involved) . Eachinvestigator must 
assure that all stud y staff members are qualified b y education, experience, and training to 
perform their specific responsibilities. These study  staff members must be listed on the study site
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070-CNS-20013
101authorization form, which includes a clea r description of each staff member’s responsibilities . 
This list must be updated throughout the stud y, as necessary.
The study  monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study  staff, including each
investigator, and for ensuring they  comply with the protocol . Additional information will be 
made available during the study  when new staff become involved in the study  and as otherwise 
agreed upon with either the investigator or the study  monitor.
11.3. Study Monitoring
To ensure compliance with GCP gui delines, the study  monitor or representative is responsible 
for ensuring that patients have signed the ICFand the study  is conducted according to applicable 
standard operating procedures ( SOPs), the protocol, and other written instructions and regulatory
guidelines.
The study  monitor is the primary  association between the Sponsorand each investigator . The 
main responsi bilities of the study  monitorare to visit each investigator before, during, and after 
the study to ensure adherence to the protocol, that all data are correctl y and completely recorded 
and reported, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded for all patients before they  
participate in the study and when changes to the consent form are warranted, in accordance with 
IEC/IRBapprovals.
The study  monitor(s) will contact each investigator and visit the study site at regular intervals 
throughout the stud y. The study  monitor will be permitted to check and verify  the various 
records (CRFs and other pertinent source data records, to include specific electronic source 
documentation [see Section3.10]) relating to the study  to verify adherence to the protocol and to 
ensure the completeness, consistency , and accuracy  of the data being recorded . If electronic 
CRFs are used for the study , the study  monitor will indicate verification by  electronically  
applying source document verification (SDV) flags to the CRF and will ensure that all required 
electronic signatures are being implemented accordingl y.
As part of the supervision of study  progress, other Sponsor personnel may , on request, 
accompan y the study  monitor on visits to the study site . Eachinvestigator and assisting staff 
must agree to cooperate with the study  monitor to resolve an y problems, errors, or possible 
misunderstandings concerning the findings det ected in the course of these monitoring visits 
and/or provided in follow -up written communication.
11.4. Clinical Product Complaints
A clinical product complaint is defined as a problem or potential problem with the phy sical 
quality or characteristics of clinical drug supplies used in a clinical research study  sponsored b y 
Teva. Examples of a product complaint include but are not limite d to the following: 
suspected contamination
questionable stability  (eg, color change, flaking, crumbling, etc.)
defective components
missing or extra units (eg, primary  container is received at the site with more or less 
than the designated number of unit s inside)
Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070-CNS-20013
102incorrect packaging or incorrect or missing labeling/labels
unexpected or unanticipated odor
Each study sitewill be responsible for reporting a possible clinical product complaint by  
completing the Product Complaint Form provided by  Teva and ema iling it to 
 within 48 hours of becoming aware of the issue.
For complaints involving a device or other retrievable item, it is required that the device (or 
item) be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. For complaints 
involving a drug product, all relevant samples (eg, the remainder of the patient’s drug supply ) 
should be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. 
11.4.1. Product Complaint Information Needed from th e Study Site
In the event that the Product Complaint Form cannot be completed, the investigator will obtain 
the following information, as available:
study site number and principal investigator name
name, phone number, and address of the source of the comp laint 
clinical protocol number
patient identifier (patient study  number) and corresponding visit numbers, if 
applicable
product name and strength for open -label studies
patient number, container, and kit numbers (if applicable) for double- blind or 
open-label studies
product available for return Yes/No
product was taken or used according to protocol Yes/No
description or nature of complaint
associated serious adverse event Yes/No
clinical supplies unblinded (for blinded studies) Yes/No
date and name of pers on receiving the complaint 
Note: Reporting a complaint must not be delay ed because not all the required information can be 
immediately  obtained. Known information must be immediately  reported. The sponsor will 
collaborate with the investigator to obtain a ny outstanding information.
11.4.2. Handling the Study Drug at the Study Site
The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from 
the investigator’s clinical study  supplies. The sponsor may  request that the investigato r return the 
product for further evaluation and/or anal ysis. If this is necessary , the clinical study  monitor or 
designee will provide the information needed for returning the stud y drug.

Placebo-Controlled Study–Postherpetic Neuralgia
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV45070-CNS-20013
103If it is determined that the study site must return all of the study drug, the sponsor will provide 
the information needed to handle the return.
The integrity  of the randomization code and corresponding blinded clinical supplies will be 
maintained whenever possible. A serious adverse event or the potential for a product qu ality 
problem existing bey ond the scope of the complaint may  be a reason to unblind the clinical 
supplies for an affected patient.
11.4.3. Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint
If there is an adverse event or serious adverse event, the protocol should be followed.
11.4.4. Documenting a Product Complaint
The investigator will record a description of the product complaint in the source documentation 
as well as an y actions taken to resolve the complaint and to preserve the safety  of the patient. 
Once the complaint has been investigated b y the sponsor and the investigator, if necessary , an 
event closure letter may  be sent to the study  site where the complaint originated or to all study 
sites using the product.
11.5. Audit and Inspection
The Sponsormay audit the study site to evaluate study  conduct and compliance with protocols, 
SOPs, GCPs, and applicable regulatory  requirements . The SponsorGlobal Clinical Quality  
Assurance department , independent of t he Global Clinical Development departmen t, is 
responsible for determining the need for (and timing of) a study site audit.
Eachinvestigator must accept that regulatory  authorities and Sponsor representatives may  
conduct inspections to verify  compliance with GCP guidelines.

12.1. Informed Consent
The investigator, or a qualified person designate d by the investigator, should fully  inform the 
patient of all pertinent aspects of the stud y, including the written information approved b y the 
IEC/IRB. All written and/or oral information about the study  will be provided in a language as 
nontechnical as p ractical and understood b y the patient. The patient should be given ample time 
and opportunity to inquire about details of the study  and to decide whether or not to participate in 
the study. The above should be detailed in the source documentation.
Writteninformed consent will be obtained from each patient before an y study-specific 
procedures or assessments are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and 
potential hazards are explained, according to the IEC/I RB requirements. The patient’s 
willingness to participate in the study  will be documented in a consent form, which will be 
signed and personally  dated by the patient and by  the person who conducted the informed 
consent discussion. The investigator will keep the original consent forms, an d copies will be 
given to the patients. I t will also be explained to the patients that the patient is free to refuse entry  
into the study  and free to withdraw from the study  at any time without prejudice to future 
treatment.
12.2. Health Authorities and Institut ional Review Boards
Before this study  starts, the protocol will be submitted to the FDAand to each I RB for review . 
As required, the study  will not start at a given study site before the IRB and health authority  
(where applicable) for thestudy site give written approval or a favorable opinion.
12.3. Confidentiality Regarding Study Patients
Eachinvestigator must assure that the privacy  of the patients, including their identity  and all 
personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. In CRFs and ot her documents or 
image material submitted to the Sponsor, patients will be identified not by  their names, but by  an 
identification code (eg, identification number).
Personal medical information may  be reviewed for the purpose of patient safet y and/or verif ying 
data in the source and transcribed onto the CRF . This review may  be conducted by  the study  
monitor, properly  authorized persons on behalf of the Sponsor, the quality  assurance unit, and/or 
regulatory  authorities. Personal medical information will alwa ys be treated as confidential.

10513. DATAHANDLING , DATA QUALITY  ASSURANCE, AND 
RECORD KEEPING
13.1. Data Collection
Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically  designed for this study . The data collected 
on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management s ystem (CDMS) that meets the 
technical requirements described in 21CFR Part 11. The CDMS will be ful ly validated to ensure 
that it meets the scientific, regulatory , and logistica l requirements of the study  before it is used to 
capture data from this study . Before using the CDMS, all users will receive training on the 
system and any  study-specific training . After they are trained, users will be provided with 
individual sy stem access rights.
Data will be collected at the study site by appropriately  designated and trained personnel, and 
CRFs must be completed for each screened patient who provided informed consent according to 
the data source . Patient identity  should not be discernibl e from the data provided on the CRF . 
Data will be verified using the data source b y the study  monitor, and reviewed for consistency  by 
Data Management using both automated logical checks and manual review . All data collected 
will be approved b y the investi gator at the study site. This approval acknowledges the 
investigator’s review and acceptance of the data as being complete and accurate . 
If data are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory , bioanalytical laboratory , central 
image center, and eDiary data), the results will be sent to the studysite. At the study  site, the data
will be retained but not entered into the CRF unless otherwise specified in the protocol . These
data may also be sent electronicall y to the Sponsor(or organization perfo rming data 
management) for direct entry  into the clinical database (see Section3.10). Laboratory  test results 
will not be entered into the CRF unle ss otherwise noted in the protocol. All data from other 
sources will be available to the investigator(s).
For patients who ente r a study but do not meet screening criteria, at a minimum, data for screen 
failure reason, demography , and adverse events from t he time of informed consent will be 
entered into the CRF . 
13.2. Data Quality Assurance
Data Management is responsible for the accuracy , quality, completeness, and internal 
consistency  of the data from this study . Data handling, including data quality  assurance, will 
comply with international regulatory  guidelines, including ICH GCP guidelines . Data 
management and control processes specific to this study , along with all steps and actions taken 
regarding data management and data quality  assurance, will be describe d in a data management 
plan.
The CRFs received will be processed and reviewed for completeness, consistency , and the 
presence of mandatory  values. Applicable terms will be coded according to the coding 
conventions for this study . Logical checks will be imp lemented to ensure data quality  and 
accuracy. Any necessary  changes will be made in the clinical database, and data review and 
validation procedures will be repeated as needed. Data from external sources will be compared 
with the information available in t he CDMS . Discrepancies found will be queried.

requires a reason for each change and keeps a complete audit trail of the data values, dates and 
times of modifications, and authorized electronic approvals of the changes.
At the conclusion of the study , the CDMS and all other study  data will be locked to further 
additions or corrections. Locking the stud y data represents the acknowledgement that all data 
have been captured and confirmed as accurate.
13.3. Archiving of Case Report Forms and Source Documents 
13.3.1. Investigator Responsibilities
All records related to the study  (ie, source data, source documents, CRFs [see Section3.10],data 
results from other sources [see Section 13.1],copies of protocols and protocol amendments, drug 
accountability  forms, correspondence, patient identification lists, signed ICFs, and other essential 
documents) must be retained until the Sponsornotifies the institution, in writing, that records 
may be destroy ed. 
If the Sponsorhas not provided written notification of records destruction after 15 years from 
study completion (or earlier in the event of an institution closing), and the inst itution determines 
the study record retention is unduly  burdensome, the institution may  submit a written request to 
the Sponsor at least 60 days before the planned disposition of the study  records. No study  
document or image (eg, scan, radiograph, ECG trac ing) should be destro yed without prior 
written agreement between the Sponsorand theinvestigator . Should an investigator wish to 
assign the stud y records to another party or move them to another location, advance written 
notice will be given to the Sponsor.

Synopsis: Sample Size Rationale
In prior studies of gabapentin or pregabalin treatment of 
PHN, the difference in mean pain scores between active -
and placebo -treated groups ranged from 1.0 ( Rice et al 
2001) to 1.3 (Dworkin et al 2003 ). For this decision -
making, proof -of-concept study, it is reasonable to use a 
conservative estimate of 1.0. If we assume a standard 
deviation of 2.35, a sample size of up to approximately
88 perarm (a total of 264 patients) would be needed to 
provide 80% pow er with a 2-sided test at 5% significance 
level to detect a 1.0 -point difference. Assuming an 
approximately 20% dropout rate, 110 patients per arm (a 
total of 330 patients) w ill be randomly assigned to each 
treatment group. During the study, the ultimate sample 
size may be adjusted on the basis of the actual dropout 
rate.In prior studies of gabapentin or pregabalin treatment of

11717.3. Amendment 02 Dated 09September 2015
The primary  reason for amendment 02 is to remove the stipulation in exclusion criterion t that 
excludes patients from participating in the stud y if they used any  of the CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 
inhibitors or substrates that were previously listed in Table 2 under Appendix A to this protocol. 
Related editorial changes have been made are as a result of this removal, including 1) 
replacement of the previous Table 2 (CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Substrates and I nhibitors with 
Documented Clinically  Significant Interactions) in Appendix A with a new Table 2 entitled 
Washout Periods for Specific Drugs, and 2) revision of an y statement(s) and cross -references 
within the protocol re ferring to information previously  provided in Table 2 of Appendix A.
An additional reason for amendment 02 is to revise inclusion criterion d to broaden the 
recruitment criterion for BMI b y increasing the upper limit of the range for BMI from 32 to 34 
kg/m2.
Amendment 02 also serves to correct the list of drugs as described in Section 7.3.4.2 that are 
detected b y the urine drug screen performed to detect the presence of drugs prohibited by 
protocol. Alcohol was incorrectly listed in Section 7.3.4.2 as a substance detected by  the drug 
screen, and has been deleted from Section 7.3.4.2 as part of this amendment.
Time windows have been added for the timing of the dermal irritation test and for the triplicate 
ECGs to allow for natural variability  in timing and to avoid unnecessary  protocol deviations.
Minor editorial changes for improved text flow and clarity  have been incorporated into the 
protocol text as part of this amendment.
Finally, the protocol is now presented in an updated protocol template maintained by the 
Sponsor. The change to an updated template is an administrative change per Sponsor policy , and 
is not intended to alter the clinical conduct of the study .

In vitro data using human cryopreserved hepatocytes 
have also shown that TV 45070 metabolite (M3) is an 
inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 , which indicates a

that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 or CYP2C19. 
However, the preliminary results of a clinical study 
designed to assess the risk of these DDIs revealed no

Study
 
Hypothesis:
 
The
 
hypothesis
 
of
 
this
 
study
 
is
 
that
 
the
 
Optune
 
NovoTTF-200A
 
System
 
is
 
a
 
safe
 
and
 
well-tolerated
 
treatment
 
for
 
pediatric
 
patients
 
when
 
used
 
in
 
combination
 
with
 
temozolomide
 
and
 
bevacizumab
 
for
 
the
 
treatment
 
of
 
high-grade

Study
 
Population:
 
Patients
 
with
 
a
 
tissue-based
 
diagnosis
 
of
 
newly-diagnosed
 
or
 
recurrent
 
high-grade
 
glioma
 
or
 
ependymoma
 
greater
 
than
 
5
 
and
 
less
 
than
 
21
 
years
 
of
 
age,
 
of
 
both
 
genders.
 
 
Primary
 
Endpoint:
 
This
 
study’s
 
safety
 
endpoint
 
will
 
assess
 
the
 
safety
 
and
 
tolerability
 
of
 
the
 
Optune
 
NovoTTF-200A
 
System
 
when
 
used
 
in
 
combination
 
with
 
temozolomide
 
and
 
bevacizumab
 
for
 
the
 
treatment
 
of
 
pediatric
 
high-grade
 
glioma
 
and
 
ependymoma.
 
This
 
safety
 
endpoint
 
will
 
be
 
determined
 
using
 
the
 
rules
 
of
 
a
 
standard
 
3+3
 
phase
 
I
 
study
 
design.
  
 
Secondary
 
Endpoint:
 
There
 
are
 
no
 
efficacy
 
endpoints
 
for
 
this
 
study.
  
However,
 
patients
 
will
 
be
 
followed
 
to
 
assess
 
their
 
progression-free
 
and
 
overall
 
survival.
 
While
 
the
 
study
 
is
 
not
 
powered
 
to
 
provide
 
an
 
efficacy
 
evaluation,
 
the
 
efficacy
 
data
 
gained
 
from
 
this
 
study
 
may
 
be
 
useful
 
in
 
designing
 
future
 
phase
 
II/III
 
investigations.

BACKGROUND
 
AND
 
RATIONALE
 
 
3.1
 
PEDIA TRIC
 
HIGH-GRADE
 
GLIOMA
 
 
High-grade
 
gliomas
 
(HGG)
 
are
 
relatively
 
rare
 
forms
 
of
 
pediatric
 
brain
 
tumors,
 
constituting
 
only
 
8–12%
 
of
 
primary
 
central
 
nervous
 
system
 
(CNS)
 
tumors
 
in
 
children.
1
  
These
 
tumors
 
include
 
astrocytomas
 
of
 
either
 
WHO
 
grade
 
3
 
(anaplastic
 
astrocytoma)
 
or
 
grade
 
4
 
(glioblastoma
 
multiforme)
 
pathology .
 
The
 
management
 
of
 
these
 
tumors
 
involves
 
surgical
 
resection
 
to
 
the
 
extent
 
feasible,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
adjuvant
 
radiation
 
and
 
chemotherapy .
  
 
 
Surgery
 
provides
 
insight
 
into
 
histologic
 
diagnosis,
 
but
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
the
 
extent
 
of
 
resection
 
on
 
outcome
 
varies.
  
Although
 
there
 
is
 
debate
 
about
 
extensive
 
tumor
 
resection
 
in
 
adults,
 
there
 
is
 
agreement
 
that
 
the
 
extent
 
of
 
resection
 
is
 
directly
 
related
 
to
 
outcome
 
in
 
children.
  
Campbell
 
et
 
al
 
demonstrated
 
retrospectively
 
a
 
relationship
 
between
 
complete
 
resection
 
and
 
long-term
 
prognosis
 
in
 
cases
 
of
 
well-circumscribed
 
hemispheric
 
malignant
 
gliomas
 
in
 
children.
2
 
However ,
 
surgery
 
by
 
itself
 
rarely
 
cures
 
patients
 
because
 
regional
 
tumor
 
infiltration
 
beyond
 
the
 
primary
 
tumor
 
prevents
 
complete
 
resections
 
unless
 
the
 
tumor
 
is
 
confined
 
to
 
polar
 
locations,
 
which
 
is
 
uncommon.
  
 
 
For
 
older
 
children
 
and
 
adults,
 
radiation
 
therapy
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
commonly
 
used
 
treatment
 
for
 
HGG.
  
All
 
patients
 
are
 
candidates
 
for
 
RT
 
after
 
surgery,
 
except
 
for
 
very
 
young
 
children
 
where
 
an
 
attempt
 
Protocol
 
Version

has
 
been
 
made
 
to
 
eliminate
 
or
 
delay
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
RT
 
because
 
of
 
fears
 
regarding
 
neuro-developmental
 
morbidity .
  
Newer
 
techniques,
 
such
 
as
 
conformal
 
RT,
 
which
 
permit
 
more
 
precise
 
treatment
 
to
 
the
 
tumor
 
bed
 
are
 
being
 
investigated
 
to
 
reduce
 
treatment
 
related
 
morbidity .

Even
 
with
 
these
 
interventions,
 
the
 
prognosis
 
for
 
patients
 
with
 
these
 
tumors
 
is
 
poor,
 
with
 
most
 
patients
 
succumbing
 
to
 
their
 
disease
 
within
 
12–18
 
months.
3
 
These
 
outcomes
 
are
 
far
 
below
 
what
 
has
 
been
 
achieved
 
in
 
the
 
treatment
 
of
 
other
 
pediatric
 
cancers.
  
As
 
a
 
result,
 
new
 
therapies
 
must
 
be
 
investigated
 
to
 
improve
 
clinical
 
outcomes
 
for
 
this
 
population.

HIST ORICAL
 
TREA TMENTS
 
FOR
 
PEDIA TRIC
 
HIGH-GRADE
 
GLIOMA
 
 
Children
 
with
 
high-grade
 
gliomas
 
continue
 
to
 
have
 
poor
 
outcomes
 
despite
 
multi-modal
 
therapy
 
with
 
surgical
 
resection,
 
radiation
 
therapy ,
 
and
 
chemotherapy .
  
While
 
surgical
 
resection
 
has
 
a
 
clear
 
benefit
 
and
 
radiation
 
does
 
slightly
 
prolong
 
time
 
to
 
progression,
 
to
 
date,
 
chemotherapy ,
 
in
 
particular ,
 
has
 
had
 
little
 
impact
 
on
 
the
 
survival
 
outcomes
 
of
 
these
 
children.
  
 
 
The
 
Children’ s
 
Cancer
 
Group
 
(CCG)
 
conducted
 
the
 
first
 
prospective,
 
randomized
 
study
 
of
 
adjuvant
 
chemotherapy
 
in
 
children
 
with
 
high-grade
 
astrocytoma,
 
CCG
 
943.
4
 
In
 
this
 
study ,
 
58
 
patients
 
were
 
randomized
 
following
 
surgery
 
to
 
radiation
 
therapy
 
with
 
or
 
without
 
chemotherapy
 
consisting
 
of
 
chloroethyl-cyclohexyl
 
nitrosourea
 
(CCNU),
 
vincristine,
 
(VCR),
 
and
 
prednisone.
  
The
 
5-year
 
EFS
 
for
 
the
 
radiotherapy
 
and
 
chemotherapy
 
group
 
was
 
46%,
 
compared
 
to
 
18%
 
for
 
the
 
radiotherapy-only
 
group.
  
In
 
patients
 
with
 
GBM,
 
specifically ,
 
and
 
at
 
least
 
a
 
partial
 
resection,
 
the
 
5-year
 
EFS
 
for
 
the
 
combined
 
radiotherapy
 
and
 
chemotherapy
 
group
 
was
 
clearly
 
superior
 
at
 
42%,
 
compared
 
to
 
6%
 
for
 
the
 
radiotherapy-only
 
group
 
(
P
=0.001).
 
 
 
Study
 
CCG
 
945
 
randomized
 
172
 
patients
 
to
 
receive
 
an
 
8-in-1
 
chemotherapy
 
regimen
 
or
 
the
 
CCNU/VCR/prednisone
 
regimen
 
used
 
in
 
CCG943.
5
 
The
 
8-in-1
 
regimen
 
showed
 
no
 
improvement
 
in
 
patient
 
outcomes
 
when
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
CCNU/VCR/prednisone
 
regimen.
 
The
 
five-year
 
progression-free
 
survival
 
(PFS)
 
and
 
OS
 
were
 
33%
 
and
 
39%,
 
respectively
 
for
 
the
 
8-in-1
 
group,
 
where
 
the
 
CCNU/VCR/prednisone
 
group
 
had
 
a
 
PFS
 
of
 
26%
 
and
 
an
 
OS
 
of
 
29%.
 
Of
 
note,
 
the
 
patients
 
receiving
 
CCNU/VCR/prednisone
 
in
 
the
 
CCG
 
945
 
study
 
did
 
not
 
respond
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
patients
 
receiving
 
the
 
same
 
regimen
 
in
 
the
 
CCG
 
943
 
study .
  
The
 
5-year
 
PFS
 
in
 
CCG
 
for
 
the
 
CCNU/VCR/prednisone
 
arm
 
was
 
46%
 
vs.
 
26%
 
for
 
the
 
same
 
regimen
 
in
 
protocol
 
CCG
 
945.
 
 
 
CCG
 
protocol
 
9933
 
studied
 
three
 
different
 
high-dose
 
chemotherapy
 
regimens
 
prior
 
to
 
radiation.
6
 
Seventy
 
six
 
patients
 
were
 
enrolled
 
and
 
received
 
four
 
courses
 
of
 
either
 
etoposide
 
with
 
carboplatin,
 
or
 
ifosfamide,
 
or
 
cyclophosphamide.
  
Patients
 
then
 
received
 
radiotherapy
 
followed
 
by
 
CCNU
 
and
 
VCR.
  
The
 
five-year
 
EFS
 
and
 
OS
 
were
 
8%
 
(±3%)
 
and
 
24%
 
(±5%),
 
respectively ,
 
without
 
any
 
difference
 
in
 
response
 
rates
 
between
 
the
 
three
 
regimens.
  
These
 
high-dose
 
regimens
 
carried
 
a

Children’ s

Group
 
study
 
ACNS0126
 
used
 
temozolomide
 
(TMZ)
 
as
 
a
 
radiosensitizer
 
followed
 
by
 
10
 
cycles
 
of
 
TMZ
 
(200
 
mg/m
2
/day
 
x
 
5
 
days
 
of
 
every
 
28
 
day
 
cycle).
 
107
 
patients
 
with
 
a
 
diagnosis
 
of
 
anaplastic
 
astrocytoma
 
(AA),
 
GBM,
 
or
 
gliosarcoma
 
were
 
enrolled.
 
Ninety
 
patients
 
were
 
eligible
 
(31
 
AA,
 
55
 
GBM,
 
and
 
4
 
other).
 
The
 
three-year
 
EFS
 
and
 
OS
 
were
 
11%
 
(±3%)
 
and
 
22%
 
(±5%),
 
respectively .
 
Although
 
this
 
study
 
did
 
not
 
demonstrate
 
an
 
improved
 
survival
 
rate
 
compared
 
to
 
CCG
 
945,
 
the
 
study
 
did
 
demonstrate
 
comparable
 
survival
 
with
 
less
 
toxicity
 
than
 
in
 
studies
 
utilizing
 
nitrosurea-based
 
regimens.
 
 
In
 
a
 
safety
 
and
 
feasibility
 
study,
 
twelve
 
children
 
and
 
young
 
adults
 
with
 
newly
 
diagnosed
 
HGG
 
received
 
radiotherapy
 
with
 
bevacizumab
 
and
 
temozolomide
 
followed
 
by
 
bevacizumab,
 
irinotecan
 
and
 
temozolomide. The
 
most
 
common ≥grade
 
3
 
toxicities
 
included
 
lymphopenia,
 
neutropenia
 
and
 
leukopenia.
 
Grade
 
3
 
hypertension
 
occurred
 
in
 
2
 
patients.
 
No
 
intracranial
 
hemorrhages
 
occurred.
 
In
 
HGG
 
patients,
 
3-year
 
progression
 
free
 
survival
 
and
 
OS
 
were
 
33 %
 
and
 
50 %,
 
respectively.
 
The
 
authors
 
concluded
 
that
 
a
 
bevacizumab-based
 
regimen
 
is
 
feasible
 
and
 
tolerable
 
in
 
newly
 
diagnosed
 
children
 
and
 
young
 
adults
 
with
 
HGG.
8
 
 
As
 
demonstrated
 
by
 
the
 
results
 
of
 
the
 
multiple
 
studies
 
detailed
 
above,
 
there
 
is
 
currently
 
no
 
effective
 
chemotherapy
 
regimen
 
for
 
pediatric
 
high-grade
 
gliomas
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
considered
 
a
 
true
 
“standard
 
of
 
care”.
 
Due
 
to
 
its
 
increased
 
tolerability
 
and
 
similar
 
efficacy
 
to
 
nitrosurea-containing
 
regimens,
 
temozolomide
 
is
 
currently
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
more
 
common
 
chemotherapy
 
agents
 
used
 
in
 
these
 
tumors
 
and
 
has
 
thus
 
been
 
incorporated
 
into
 
the
 
second
 
portion
 
of
 
this
 
study .
  
Likewise,
 
bevacizumab,
 
which
 
also
 
has
 
a
 
relatively
 
favorable
 
side
 
effect
 
profile
 
and
 
is
 
commonly
 
used
 
in
 
pediatric
 
high-grade
 
glioma,
 
has
 
been
 
selected
 
as
 
the
 
second
 
standard
 
of
 
care
 
agent.
 
Temozolomide
 
and
 
bevacizumab
 
in
 
combination
 
has
 
demonstrated
 
safety
 
and
 
efficacy
 
on
 
par
 
with
 
other
 
regimens
 
in
 
both
 
adults
 
and
 
pediatric
 
high-grade
 
glioma
 
studies.
8,9
 
As
 
such,
 
they
 
are
 
felt
 
to
 
be
 
reasonable
 
backbone
 
drugs
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
portion
 
of
 
this
 
study
 
combining
 
Optune
 
NovoTTF-200A
 
treatment
 
with
 
chemotherapy .

PEDIA TRIC
 
EPENDYMOMA
 
 
Ependymoma
 
is
 
the
 
third
 
most
 
common
 
pediatric
 
CNS
 
tumor
 
accounting
 
for
 
8-10%
 
of
 
all
 
diagnoses.
10
 
Unfortunately ,
 
outcomes
 
for
 
these
 
tumors
 
are
 
suboptimal
 
with
 
the
 
five-year
 
progression-free
 
and
 
overall
 
survival
 
being
 
50-64%
 
and
 
23-45%,
 
respectively .
11-14
 
The
 
standard
 
of
 
care
 
for
 
ependymoma
 
is
 
maximal
 
feasible
 
surgical
 
resection
 
followed
 
by
 
radiotherapy
 
to
 
the
 
primary
 
site.
 
However ,
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
radiotherapy
 
in
 
young
 
children
 
remains
 
controversial,
 
particularly
 
in
 
those
 
children
 
with
 
supratentorial
 
tumors.
 
Chemotherapy
 
is
 
typically
 
reserved
 
for
 
patients
 
with
 
residual
 
tumor
 
post-operatively
 
and
 
administered
 
prior
 
to
 
radiotherapy .
15
 
The
 
benefit
 
of
 
post-radiation
 
maintenance
 
chemotherapy
 
is
 
currently
 
being
 
evaluated
 
in
 
the
 
Children’ s
 
Oncology
 
Group
 
ACNS0831
 
study .
 
 
 
There
 
is
 
currently
 
no
 
standard
 
of
 
care
 
for
 
recurrent
 
ependymoma
 
in
 
children.
 
Children
 
who
 
receive
 
incomplete
 
resections
 
of
 
their
 
tumor
 
are
 
at
 
much
 
higher
 
risk
 
for
 
recurrence
 
than
 
those

Treatment
 
strategies
 
for
 
children
 
with
 
recurrent
 
ependymoma
 
include
 
re-resection
 
and
 
re-irradiation
 
when

Chemotherapy
 
has
 
typically
 
not
 
demonstrated
 
significant

long-term
 
responses
 
to
 
metronomic
 
anti-angiogenic
 
regimens,
 
but
 
these
 
treatments
 
are
 
generally
 
not
 
felt
 
to
 
be
 
curative.
18,19
 
Many
 
families
 
of
 
children
 
with
 
recurrent
 
ependymomas
 
seek
 
experimental
 
treatment
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
proven
 
therapeutic
 
options.
 
Given
 
the
 
tremendous
 
need
 
for
 
investigations
 
of
 
new
 
therapies
 
for
 
children
 
with
 
recurrent
 
ependymoma
 
it
 
is
 
felt
 
that
 
including
 
this
 
patient
 
population
 
for
 
enrollment
 
in
 
this
 
phase
 
I
 
study
 
is
 
both
 
reasonable
 
and
 
ethical.

INTRODUCTION
 
TO
 
ELECTRIC
 
FIELDS
 
 
 
In
 
the
 
laboratory
 
setting
 
and
 
in
 
clinical
 
practice,
 
alternating
 
electric
 
fields
 
show
 
a
 
wide
 
range
 
of
 
effects
 
on
 
living
 
tissues.
 
At
 
very
 
low
 
frequencies
 
(under
 
1
 
kHz),
 
alternating
 
electric
 
fields
 
stimulate
 
excitable
 
tissues
 
through
 
membrane
 
depolarisation.
20
 
The
 
transmission
 
of
 
such
 
fields
 
by
 
radiation
 
is
 
insignificant
 
and
 
therefore
 
they
 
are
 
usually
 
applied
 
directly
 
by
 
contact
 
electrodes,
 
though
 
some
 
applications
 
have
 
also
 
used
 
insulated
 
electrodes.
 
Some
 
well-known
 
examples
 
of
 
such
 
effects
 
include
 
nerve,
 
muscle
 
and
 
heart
 
stimulation
 
by
 
alternating
 
electric
 
fields.
20,21
 
In
 
addition,
 
low
 
frequency
 
pulsed
 
electric
 
fields
 
have
 
been
 
claimed
 
to
 
stimulate
 
bone
 
growth
 
and
 
accelerate
 
fracture
 
healing.
22
 
 
 
However ,
 
as
 
the
 
frequency
 
of
 
the
 
alternating
 
electric
 
field
 
increases
 
above
 
1
 
kHz,
 
the
 
stimulatory
 
effect
 
diminishes.
 
Under
 
these
 
conditions
 
although
 
a
 
greater
 
fraction
 
of
 
the
 
fields
 
penetrates
 
the
 
cells,
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
parallel
 
resistor -capacitor
 
nature
 
of
 
all
 
biological
 
membranes,
 
the
 
stimulatory
 
power
 
greatly
 
diminishes
 
as
 
the
 
alternating
 
cell
 
membrane
 
hyper
 
–depolarization
 
cycles
 
are
 
integrated
 
such
 
that
 
the
 
net
 
effect
 
is
 
nulled.
 
 
 
At
 
very
 
high
 
frequencies
 
(i.e.,
 
above
 
many
 
MHz),
 
while
 
the
 
integration
 
becomes
 
even
 
more
 
effective,
 
a
 
completely
 
different
 
biological
 
effect
 
is
 
observed.
 
At
 
these
 
frequencies
 
tissue
 
heating
 
becomes
 
dominant
 
due
 
to
 
dielectric
 
losses.
 
This
 
effect
 
becomes
 
more
 
intense
 
as
 
field
 
intensity
 
or
 
tissue
 
dissipation
 
factor
 
increase.
23
 
This
 
phenomenon
 
serves
 
as
 
the
 
basis
 
for
 
some
 
commonly
 
used
 
medical
 
treatment
 
modalities
 
including
 
diathermy
 
and
 
radio
 
frequency
 
tumor
 
ablation,
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
applied
 
through
 
insulated
 
electrodes.
24
 
 
 
Intermediate
 
frequency
 
electric
 
fields
 
(i.e.,
 
tens
 
of
 
kHz
 
to
 
MHz),
 
alternate
 
too
 
fast
 
for
 
causing
 
nerve-muscle
 
stimulation
 
and
 
involve
 
only
 
minute
 
dielectric
 
losses
 
(heating).
 
Such
 
fields,
 
of
 
low
 
to
 
moderate
 
intensities,
 
are
 
commonly
 
considered
 
to
 
have
 
no
 
biological
 
effect.
23
 
However ,
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
non-thermal
 
effects,
 
of
 
minor
 
biological
 
consequence,
 
have
 
been
 
reported
 
even
 
at
 
low
 
field
 
intensities.
 
These
 
include
 
microscopic
 
particle
 
alignment
 
(i.e.,
 
the
 
pearl
 
chain
 
effect
25
)
 
and
 
cell
 
rotation.
26,
 
27
 
With
 
pulsed
 
relatively
 
strong
 
electric
 
fields,

phenomenon
 
usually
 
called
 
electroporation.

NOV OCURE’S
 
TUMOR
 
TREA TING
 
ELECTRIC
 
FIELDS
 
(
TTFIELDS
)
 
 
 
NovoCure
 
has
 
shown
29
 
that
 
when
 
properly
 
tuned,
 
very
 
low
 
intensity ,
 
intermediate
 
frequency
 
electric
 
fields
 
(TTFields)
 
stunt
 
the
 
growth
 
of
 
tumor
 
cells.
 
This
 
inhibitory
 
effect
 
was
 
demonstrated
 
in
 
all
 
proliferating
 
cell
 
types
 
tested,
 
whereas,
 
non-proliferating
 
cells
 
and
 
tissues
 
were
 
unaffected.
 
Interestingly ,
 
different
 
cell
 
types
 
showed
 
specific
 
intensity
 
and
 
frequency
 
dependences

TTField
 
inhibition.
 
It
 
has
 
been
 
shown
 
that
 
two
 
main
 
processes
 
occur
 
at
 
the
 
cellular
 
level
 
during
 
exposure
 
to
 
TTFields:
 
arrest
 
of
 
proliferation
 
and
 
dividing
 
cell
 
destruction.
 
The
 
damage
 
caused
 
by
 
TTFields
 
to
 
these
 
replicating
 
cells
 
was
 
dependent
 
on
 
the
 
orientation
 
of
 
the
 
division
 
process
 
in
 
relation
 
to
 
the
 
field
 
vectors,
 
indicating
 
that
 
this
 
effect
 
is
 
non-thermal.
 
Indeed,
 
temperature
 
measurements
 
made
 
within
 
culture
 
dishes
 
during
 
treatment
 
and
 
on
 
the
 
skin
 
above
 
treated
 
tumors
 
in-vivo,
 
showed
 
no
 
significant
 
elevation
 
in
 
temperature
 
compared
 
to
 
control
 
cultures/mice.
 
Also,
 
TTFields
 
caused
 
the
 
dividing
 
cells
 
to
 
orient
 
in
 
the
 
direction
 
of
 
the
 
applied
 
field
 
in
 
a
 
manner
 
similar
 
to
 
that
 
described
 
in
 
cultured
 
human
 
corneal
 
epithelial
 
cells
 
exposed
 
to
 
constant
 
electric
 
fields.
30
 
At
 
the
 
sub-cellular
 
level
 
it
 
was
 
found
 
that
 
TTFields
 
disrupt
 
the
 
normal
 
polymerization-depolymerization
 
process
 
of
 
microtubules
 
during
 
mitosis.
 
Indeed,
 
the
 
described
 
abnormal
 
mitotic
 
configurations
 
seen
 
after
 
exposure
 
to
 
TTFields
 
are
 
similar
 
to
 
the
 
morphological
 
abnormalities
 
seen
 
in
 
cells
 
treated
 
with
 
agents
 
that
 
interfere
 
directly
31,
 
32
 
or
 
indirectly
33-35
 
with
 
microtubule
 
polymerization
 
(e.g.,
 
Taxol).

MODELING
 
THE
 
MECHANISM
 
OF
 
ACTION
 
OF
 
TTFIELDS
 
 
 
In
 
order
 
to
 
explain
 
how
 
TTFields
 
cause
 
orientation
 
dependent
 
damage
 
to
 
dividing
 
cells
 
and
 
disrupt
 
the
 
proper
 
formation
 
of
 
the
 
mitotic
 
spindle
 
NovoCure
 
modeled
 
the
 
forces
 
exerted
 
by
 
TTFields
 
on
 
intracellular
 
charges
 
and
 
polar
 
particles
 
using
 
finite
 
element
 
simulations.
 
Two
 
main
 
mechanisms
 
by
 
means
 
of
 
which
 
the
 
electric
 
fields
 
may
 
affect
 
dividing
 
cells
 
were
 
recognized.
 
The
 
first
 
relates
 
to
 
the
 
field
 
effect
 
on
 
polar
 
macromolecule
 
orientation.
 
Within
 
this
 
framework,
 
during
 
the
 
early
 
phases
 
of
 
mitosis,
 
i.e.,
 
in
 
pre-telophase,
 
when
 
tubulin
 
polymerization-depolymerization
 
drives
 
the
 
proliferation
 
process,
 
the
 
electric
 
field
 
forces
 
any
 
tubulin
 
dimers,
 
positioned
 
further
 
than
 
14nm
 
away
 
from
 
the
 
growing
 
end
 
of
 
a
 
microtubule,
 
to
 
orient
 
in
 
the
 
direction
 
of
 
the
 
field.
 
This
 
force
 
moment,
 
(10
-5
 
pN)
 
acting
 
on
 
the
 
dimers,
 
is
 
sufficient
 
to
 
interfere
 
with
 
the
 
proper
 
process
 
of
 
assembly
 
and
 
disassembly
 
of
 
microtubules
 
that
 
is
 
essential
 
for
 
chromosome
 
alignment
 
and
 
separation.
36
 
This
 
effect
 
can
 
explain
 
the
 
mitotic
 
arrest
 
of
 
TTField
 
treated
 
cells.
37
 
 
 
The
 
second
 
mechanism,
 
which
 
interferes
 
with
 
cell
 
division,
 
and
 
is
 
most
 
likely
 
to
 
play
 
an
 
important
 
role
 
in
 
cell
 
destruction,
 
becomes
 
dominant
 
during
 
cleavage.
 
As
 
seen
 
in
 
simulations,
 
the
 
electric
 
field
 
within
 
quiescent
 
cells
 
is
 
homogenous,
 
whereas
 
the
 
field
 
inside
 
mitotic
 
cells,
 
during
 
cytokinesis,
 
is
 
not
 
homogenous.
 
An
 
increased
 
field
 
line
 
concentration
 
(indicating
 
increased
 
field
 
intensity)
 
is
 
seen
 
at
 
the
 
furrow ,
 
a
 
phenomenon
 
that
 
highly
 
resembles
 
the
 
focusing
 
of
 
a
 
light
 
beam
 
by
 
a
 
lens.
 
This
 
in-homogeneity
 
in
 
field
 
intensity
 
exerts
 
a
 
unidirectional
 
electric
 
force,
 
on
 
all
 
intracellular
 
charged
 
and
 
polar
 
entities
 
(including
 
induced
 
dipoles),
 
pulling
 
them
 
towards
 
the
 
furrow
 
(regardless
 
of
 
field
 
polarity).
 
For
 
example,
 
for
 
a
 
cleavage
 
furrow
 
that
 
reached
 
a
 
diameter
 
of
 
1µm
 
in
 
an
 
external
 
field
 
of
 
only
 
1
 
V/cm,
 
the
 
force
 
exerted
 
on
 
the
 
microtubules
 
is
 
in
 
the
 
order
 
of
 
5pN.
 
This
 
magnitude
 
is
 
compatible
 
with
 
the
 
reported
 
forces
 
necessary
 
to
 
stall
 
microtubule
 
polymerization
 
which
 
is
 
4.3
 
pN.

With
 
regards
 
to
 
other
 
particles,
 
such
 
as
 
cytoplasmatic
 
organelles,
 
they
 
are
 
polarized
 
by
 
the
 
field
 
within
 
dividing
 
cells.
 
Once
 
polarized,
 
the
 
forces
 
acting
 
on
 
such
 
particles
 
may
 
reach
 
values
 
up
 
to
 
an
 
order
 
of
 
60
 
pN
 
resulting
 
in
 
their
 
movement
 
towards
 
the
 
furrow
 
at
 
velocities
 
that
 
may
 
approach
 
0.03
 
µm/sec.
 
At
 
such
 
velocity ,
 
cytoplasmatic
 
organelles
 
would
 
pile
 
up
 
at
 
the
 
cleavage
 
furrow
 
within
 
a
 
few
 
minutes,
 
interfering
 
with
 
cytokinesis
 
and
 
possibly
 
leading
 
to
 
cell
 
destruction.
 
It
 
has
 
also
 
been
 
found
 
that
 
the
 
electric
 
forces
 
acting
 
on
 
intracellular
 
particles
 
are
 
maximal
 
when
 
the

This
 
is
 
consistent
 
with
 
the
 
dependence
 
of
 
the
 
destructive
 
effect
 
of
 
TTFields
 
on
 
the
 
angle
 
between
 
division
 
axis
 
and
 
the
 
field,
 
as
 
demonstrated
 
experimentally .
 
In
 
addition,
 
the
 
calculated
 
dependence
 
of
 
the
 
magnitude
 
of
 
this
 
force
 
on
 
frequency
 
is
 
consistent
 
with
 
the
 
experimentally
 
determined
 
frequency
 
dependence
 
of
 
the
 
inhibitory
 
effect
 
of
 
TTFields
 
on

IN
 
VIVO
 
EFFECTS
 
OF
 
TTFIELDS
 
 
 
NovoCure
 
has
 
shown
39
 
that
 
TTFields
 
can
 
be
 
applied
 
effectively
 
to
 
animals
 
through
 
electrodes
 
placed
 
on
 
the
 
surface
 
of
 
the
 
body .
 
Using
 
a
 
special
 
type
 
of
 
electrically
 
insulated
 
electrodes,
 
significant
 
inhibition
 
of
 
the
 
growth
 
of
 
both
 
intradermal
 
melanoma
 
(B16F1)
 
in
 
mice
 
and
 
intracranial
 
glioma
 
(F-98)
 
in
 
rats
 
was
 
seen
 
after
 
less
 
than
 
one
 
week
 
of
 
treatment.
 
This
 
growth
 
inhibition
 
was
 
accompanied
 
by
 
a
 
decrease
 
in
 
angiogenesis
 
within
 
the
 
tumor ,
 
due
 
to
 
inhibition
 
of
 
endothelial
 
cell
 
proliferation.
 
 
 
Extensive
 
safety
 
studies
 
in
 
healthy
 
rabbits
 
and
 
rats
 
exposed
 
to
 
TTFields
 
for
 
protracted
 
periods
 
of
 
time
 
have
 
shown
 
no
 
treatment
 
related
 
side
 
effects.
 
The
 
reasons
 
for
 
the
 
surprisingly
 
low
 
toxicity
 
of
 
TTField
 
treatment
 
can
 
be
 
explained
 
in
 
the
 
light
 
of
 
the
 
known
 
passive
 
electric
 
properties
 
of
 
normal
 
tissues
 
within
 
the
 
body
 
and
 
the
 
effects
 
of
 
electric
 
fields
 
applied
 
via
 
insulated
 
electrodes.
 
More
 
specifically ,
 
two
 
types
 
of
 
toxicities
 
may
 
be
 
expected
 
in
 
an
 
electric
 
field
 
based
 
treatment
 
modality .
 
First,
 
the
 
fields
 
could
 
interfere
 
with
 
the
 
normal
 
function
 
of
 
excitable
 
tissues
 
within
 
the
 
body
 
causing,
 
in
 
extreme
 
cases,
 
cardiac
 
arrhythmias
 
and
 
seizures.
 
However
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
truly
 
a
 
concern
 
with
 
TTFields
 
since,
 
as
 
frequencies
 
increase
 
above
 
1
 
kHz,
 
excitation
 
by
 
sinusoidal
 
electric
 
fields
 
decreases
 
dramatically
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
parallel
 
resistor -capacitor
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
cell
 
membrane
 
(with
 
a
 
time
 
constant
 
of
 
about
 
1ms).
 
Thus,
 
as
 
expected,
 
in
 
both
 
acute
 
and
 
chronic
 
application
 
of
 
TTFields
 
to
 
healthy
 
animals,
 
no
 
evidence
 
of
 
abnormal
 
cardiac
 
rhythms
 
or
 
pathologic
 
neurological
 
activity
 
was
 
seen.
 
 
 
Secondly ,
 
the
 
anti-mitotic
 
effect
 
of
 
TTFields
 
might
 
be
 
expected
 
to
 
damage
 
the
 
replication
 
of
 
rapidly
 
dividing
 
normal
 
cells
 
within
 
the
 
body
 
(bone
 
marrow ,
 
small
 
intestine
 
mucosa).
 
Surprisingly ,
 
no
 
treatment
 
related
 
toxicities
 
were
 
found
 
in
 
any
 
of
 
the
 
animal
 
safety
 
trials
 
performed
 
by
 
NovoCure,
 
even
 
when
 
field
 
intensities
 
3
 
fold
 
higher
 
than
 
the
 
effective
 
anti-tumoral
 
dose
 
were
 
used.
 
The
 
lack
 
of
 
damage
 
to
 
intestinal
 
mucosa
 
in
 
TTField-treated
 
animals
 
is
 
probably
 
a
 
reflection
 
of
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
the
 
small
 
intestine
 
mucosal
 
cells
 
have
 
a
 
slower
 
replication
 
cycle
 
than
 
neoplastic
 
cells
 
and
 
that
 
the
 
intestine
 
itself
 
most
 
likely
 
changes
 
its
 
orientation
 
in
 
relation
 
to
 
the
 
applied
 
field
 
quite
 
often,
 
lowering
 
the
 
efficacy
 
of
 
TTField
 
mediated
 
mitotic
 
disruption.
 
Bone
 
marrow ,
 
on
 
the
 
other
 
hand,
 
is
 
naturally
 
protected
 
from
 
TTFields
 
by
 
the
 
high
 
electric
 
resistance
 
of
 
both
 
bone
 
and
 
bone
 
marrow
 
compared
 
to
 
most
 
other
 
tissues
 
in
 
the
 
body .
 
To
 
test
 
the
 
later
 
assumption,
 
the
 
TTField
 
intensity
 
within
 
the
 
bone
 
marrow
 
of
 
a
 
long
 
bone
 
was
 
modeled
 
using
 
the
 
finite
 
element
 
mesh
 
(FEM)
 
method.
 
It
 
was
 
found
 
that
 
the
 
intensity
 
of
 
TTFields
 
was
 
100-fold
 
lower
 
within
 
the
 
bone
 
marrow
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
surrounding
 
tissues
 
(including
 
within
 
solid
 
tumors).
 
Thus,
 
hematopoietic
 
cell
 
replication
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
affected
 
even
 
when
 
TTField
 
intensities
 
10-fold
 
higher
 
than
 
necessary
 
to
 
inhibit
 
tumor
 
growth
 
are
 
applied.

THE

DEVICE
 
 
 
The
 
NovoTTF-200A
 
device
 
is
 
a
 
portable
 
battery
 
operated
 
device
 
which
 
produces
 
TTFields
 
within
 
the
 
human
 
body
 
by
 
means
 
of
 
surface
 
electrodes.
 
The
 
TTFields
 
are
 
applied
 
to
 
the
 
patient
 
by
 
means
 
of
 
surface
 
electrodes
 
that
 
are
 
electrically
 
insulated,
 
so
 
that
 
resistively
 
coupled
 
electric
 
currents
 
are
 
not
 
delivered
 
to
 
the
 
patient.
 
The
 
electrodes,
 
which
 
incorporate
 
a
 
layer
 
of
 
adhesive
 
hydrogel
 
and
 
a
 
layer
 
of
 
hypoaller genic
 
medical
 
tape,
 
are
 
placed
 
on
 
the
 
patient’ s
 
shaved
 
head.
 
The
 
electrodes
 
must
 
be
 
replaced
 
every
 
three
 
to
 
four
 
days
 
and
 
the
 
scalp
 
re-shaved
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
maintain
 
optimal
 
capacitative
 
coupling
 
between
 
the
 
electrodes
 
and
 
the
 
patient
 
head.
 
All
 
the
 
treatment
 
parameters
 
are
 
pre-set
 
by
 
NovoCure
 
so
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
electrical
 
output
 
adjustments
 
available
 
to
 
the
 
patient.
 
The
 
patient
 
must
 
learn
 
to
 
change
 
and
 
rechar ge
 
depleted
 
device
 
batteries
 
and
 
to
 
connect
 
to
 
an

Of
 
note,
 
the
 
NovoTTF-200A

a
 
second

device
 
and
 
has
 
received
 
approval
 
by
 
the
 
FDA
 
in

performed
 
on
 
ten
 
recurrent
 
GBM
 
patients
 
treated
 
with
 
the

All
 
patients
 
underwent
 
surgery
 
and
 
radiotherapy
 
for
 
the
 
primary

Only
 
1
 
patient
 
was
 
chemotherapy

the
 
rest
 
having
 
received
 
either
 
Temozolomide
 
or
 
other
 
chemotherapeutic

using
 
continuous,
 
24-hour

TTFields.
 
TTFields
 
were
 
applied
 
through
 
two

and
 
alternated
 
at
 
a

between
 
two
 
perpendicular

courses
 
leading
 
to
 
maximal

related
 
serious
 
adverse
 
events
 
seen
 
in
 
any
 
of
 
the
 
patients.
 
Patients
 
received
 
treatment
 
on
 
average
 
about
 
three
 
quarters
 
of
 
the
 
scheduled
 
time.
 
Considering
 
the
 
continuous
 
nature
 
of
 
NovoTTF
 
treatment
 
(i.e.,
 
24
 
hours
 
a
 
day
 
for
 
many
 
months)
 
this
 
figure
 
indicates
 
that
 
compliance
 
with
 
treatment
 
was
 
very
 
high,
 
with
 
patients
 
taking
 
very
 
few
 
days
 
off

and
 
stopping
 
only
 
for
 
short
 
periods
 
of
 
time
 
during

for
 
personal

in
 
8
 
of
 
the
 
10

In
 
most
 
cases
 
this
 
dermatitis
 
appeared
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
time
 
during
 
the
 
second

The
 
skin
 
reaction
 
improved
 
with
 
use
 
of
 
topical
 
corticosteroids.
 
Regular
 
relocation
 
of
 
the
 
electrode

was
 
necessary
 
in

to
 
allow
 
for

Similar
 
results
 
showing
 
comparability
 
of
 
NovoTTF-100A
 
to

were
 
seen
 
in
 
all

(e.g.,
 
PFS6
 
=
 
21.4%
 
for
 
NovoTTF-100A

experienced
 
fewer

43
 
Feasibility
 
is
 
defined

Optune
 
≥18
 
hours/day
 
for
 
at

planned
 
interim
 
analysis
 
included
 
11
 
patients
 
(seven
 
males
 
and
 
four
 
females)
 
with
 
supratentorial
 
tumors
 
(ten
 
high-grade
 
glioma
 
and
 
one
 
ependymoma).
 
Ten
 
patients
 
were
 
evaluable
 
(one
 
patient
 
had
 
progressive
 
disease
 
during
 
the
 
feasibility
 
period)
 
and
 
four
 
remained
 
on

occurred.
 
Three
 
patients
 
had
 
seizures
 
(grade
 
1–3),
 
fatigue,
 
scalp
 
pain,
 
localized
 
rash,
 
and
 
headache
 
(none
 
greater
 
than
 
grade
 
3).
 
Of
 
the
 
10
 
evaluable
 
patients,
 
7
 
satisfied
 
the
 
feasibility
 
criteria
 
for
 
the

therapy ,
 
which
 
was
 
above
 
the
 
prespecified
 
threshold
 
of
 
at

6/11.
 
These
 
preliminary

to
 
indicate

of
 
monotherapy
 
with
 
Optune
 
in
 
the

44
 
Participating

Participants
 
also
 
completed
 
an
 
exit
 
survey
 
when
 
they
 
were
 
off
 
the
 
study
 
regarding
 
their
 
experiences
 
wearing
 
the

Patients
 
reported
 
worse

than
 
the
 
norms
 
on
 
all
 
domains.
 
Six

STUDY
 
RATIONALE
 
 
Pediatric
 
high-grade
 
gliomas
 
are
 
aggressive
 
tumors
 
that
 
carry
 
a
 
poor
 
prognosis.
  
In
 
the
 
recurrent
 
setting,
 
the
 
outcomes
 
for
 
children
 
with
 
ependymomas
 
are
 
equally
 
dismal.
  
There
 
is
 
currently
 
no
 
standard-of-care
 
for
 
these
 
tumors
 
and
 
patients
 
are
 
in
 
desperate
 
need
 
of
 
improved
 
and
 
innovative
 
new
 
therapies.
  
TTFields
 
have
 
proven
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
safe
 
and
 
efficacious
 
approach
 
to
 
the
 
treatment
 
of
 
adult
 
high-grade
 
gliomas
 
and
 
the
 
Optune
 
device
 
is
 
currently
 
FDA-approved
 
for
 
this
 
indication.
 
Preliminary
 
pediatric
 
investigations
 
have
 
demonstrated
 
the
 
safety
 
and
 
feasibility
 
of
 
delivering
 
TTFields
 
to
 
children
 
with
 
high-grade
 
glioma
 
and
 
ependymoma.
 
Given
 
these
 
positive
 
results,
 
further
 
exploration
 
into
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
TTFields
 
for
 
pediatric
 
high-grade
 
glioma
 
and
 
ependymoma
 
are
 
warranted.

to
 
determine
 
the

patients.
 
The

period
 
will
 
encompass
 
the
 
first
 
two
 
cycles
 
(56

If
 
one
 
or
 
fewer

are
 
observed
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
three
 
patients
 
of
 
this
 
cohort,
 
then
 
an
 
additional
 
three
 
patients
 
will
 
be
 
enrolled.
  
If
 
fewer
 
than
 
two
 
adverse

related
 
to
 
treatment
 
are
 
noted
 
following
 
the
 
phase
 
I

period
 
for
 
all
 
six

then
 
the

the
 
Optune
 
NovoTTF-200A
 
System
 
in
 
combination
 
with
 
temozolomide
 
and
 
bevacizumab
 
is
 
well-tolerated
 
for
 
pediatric
 
patients
 
with
 
high-grade
 
gliomas
 
and
 
ependymomas.
 
If
 
at
 
any
 
point
 
two
 
or
 
more
 
patients
 
experience
 
a
 
serious
 
adverse
 
event
 
related
 
to
 
treatment,
 
then
 
the
 
study
 
will
 
close.
 
 
 
Once
 
a
 
patient
 
is
 
enrolled
 
it
 
is
 
planned
 
that
 
they
 
will
 
continue
 
to
 
receive
 
treatment
 
in
 
cycles
 
of
 
28
 
days
 
(4
 
weeks),
 
which
 
may
 
be
 
repeated
 
continuously
 
without

interruption
 
for
 
12
 
cycles
 
or
 
until
 
any
 
criterion
 
for
 
discontinuation
 
(clinical

etc.)
 
is
 
met.
 
Patients
 
who
 
appear
 
to

from
 
this
 
treatment
 
will
 
be

recorded
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
a

or
 
a
 
clinical
 
measurement
 
(i.e.

that
 
worsen
 
in

worsen
 
is
 
not
 
an
 
adverse

Further ,
 
a
 
procedure

is
 
not
 
an
 
adverse
 
event;
 
rather ,
 
the
 
event
 
leading
 
to
 
the

is
 
considered
 
an
 
adverse
 
event.

that
 
occurs
 
during
 
the

judgment,
 
a

finding,
 
or
 
vital
 
sign,
 
a
 
corresponding
 
clinical
 
adverse
 
event
 
should
 
be
 
recorded.
 
 
If
 
a
 
specific
 
medical
 
diagnosis
 
has
 
been
 
made,
 
that
 
diagnosis
 
or
 
syndrome
 
should

GUIDELINES
 
FOR
 
CNS
 
HEMORRHAGE
 
(PUNCTUA TE
 
LESIONS)
 
 
Definition
 
of
 
punctate
 
hemorrhage
 
identified
 
by
 
neuroimaging:
 
 
Punctate
 
hemorrhage
 
on
 
neuroimaging
 
refers
 
to:
 
1.
 
Small
 
(<
 
2mm)
 
foci
 
of
 
presumed
 
hemorrhagic
 
signal
 
within
 
the
 
lesion
 
often
 
demonstrated
 
by
 
GRE
 
techniques,
 
without
 
associated
 
mass
 
effect.
 
 
2.
 
Curvilinear
 
areas
 
of
 
hemorrhagic
 
signal
 
(<
 
2
 
mm
 
thickness)
 
surrounding
 
the
 
lesion,
 
often
 
seen
 
with
 
high
 
grade
 
glial
 
tumors.
 
This
 
would
 
include
 
areas
 
identified
 
only
 
on
 
GRE
 
sequences
 
(presumably
 
related
 
to
 
hemosiderin
 
deposition).
 
 
Patients
 
with
 
punctate
 
hemorrhage
 
will
 
be
 
allowed
 
to
 
continue
 
bevacizumab
 
therapy
 
but
 
will
 
be
 
closely
 
monitored
 
for
 
signs
 
and
 
symptoms
 
of
 
worsening
 
hemorrhage.
 
In
 
such
 
an
 
event,
 
repeat
 
neuroimaging
 
studies
 
should
 
be
 
obtained
 
including
 
CT
 
scan
 
of
 
head
 
followed
 
by
 
MRI
 
scan
 
of
 
brain
 
with
 
GRE
 
sequences.
 
Patients
 
with
 
worsening
 
hemorrhage
 
should
 
be
 
taken
 
off
 
bevacizumab.
 
This
 
action
 
would
 
also
 
apply
 
to
 
those
 
who
 
are
 
asymptomatic
 
and
 
are
 
found
 
to
 
have
 
worsening
 
hemorrhage
 
on
 
a
 
subsequent
 
routine
 
MRI
 
scan
 
of
 
the
 
brain.
 
 
9.3.2
 
SURGICAL
 
PROCEDURES
 
 
Patients
 
may
 
not
 
have
 
had
 
a
 
planned
 
major
 
surgical
 
procedure
 
(such
 
as
 
resection
 
of
 
recurrent
 
disease)
 
within
 
28
 
days
 
of
 
initiating
 
bevacizumab.
 
If
 
major
 
surgery
 
for
 
local
 
control
 
is
 
planned
 
during
 
study
 
therapy
 
for
 
a
 
patient
 
on
 
bevacizumab,
 
then
 
the
 
bevacizumab
 
should
 
be
 
held
 
for
 
one
 
cycle
 
prior
 
and
 
for
 
28
 
days
 
post
 
definitive
 
resection,
 
unless
 
the
 
patient
 
has
 
had
 
a
 
significant
 
post-operative
 
wound
 
complication
 
that,
 
in
 
the
 
opinion
 
of
 
the
 
investigator ,
 
would
 
preclude
 
bevacizumab
 
administration.
 
In
 
this
 
clinical
 
situation
 
post-operative
 
bevacizumab
 
should
 
be
 
withheld
 
for
 
longer .
 
These
 
restrictions
 
are
 
due
 
to
 
concerns
 
of
 
delayed
 
wound
 
healing
 
and
 
hemorrhage.
 
Minor
 
surgical
 
procedures
 
(e.g.,
 
biopsies,
 
vascular
 
catheter
 
placement,
 
G-tube)
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
fully
 
healed
 
and
 
occurred
 
>
 
7
 
days
 
prior
 
to
 
initiating
 
bevacizumab.

Sour ce
 
and
 
Pharmacology:
 
 
Bevacizumab
 
is
 
a
 
recombinant
 
humanized
 
anti-vascular
 
endothelial
 
growth
 
factor
 
(anti-VEGF)
 
monoclonal
 
antibody ,
 
consisting
 
of
 
93%
 
human
 
and
 
7%
 
murine
 
amino
 
acid
 
sequences.
 
The
 
agent
 
is
 
composed
 
of
 
human
 
IgG
 
framework
 
and
 
murine
 
antigen-binding
 
complementarity-determining
 
regions.
 
Bevacizumab
 
approximate
 
molecular
 
weight
 
is
 
149,000
 
daltons.
 
Bevacizumab
 
blocks
 
the
 
binding
 
of
 
VEGF
 
to
 
its
 
receptors
 
resulting
 
in
 
inhibition
 
of
 
angiogenesis.
 
 
The
 
estimated
 
half-life
 
of
 
bevacizumab
 
is
 
approximately
 
20
 
days
 
(range
 
11-50
 
days).
 
The
 
predicted
 
time
 
to
 
reach
 
steady
 
state
 
was
 
100
 
days
 
in
 
491
 
patients
 
who
 
received
 
1
 
to
 
20
 
mg/kg
 
weekly ,
 
every
 
2
 
weeks,
 
or
 
every
 
3
 
weeks.
 
The
 
clearance
 
and
 
the
 
central
 
volume
 
of
 
distribution
 
are
 
higher
 
in
 
males
 
than
 
females.
 
Clearance
 
was
 
higher
 
in
 
those
 
patients
 
with
 
a
 
higher
 
tumor
 
volume.

agent,
 
or
 
the
 
combination
 
may
 
result
 
in
 
events
 
never
 
previously
 
associated
 
with
 
either
 
agent.
 
 
Effect
 
in
 
Pregnancy
 
and
 
Lactation:
 
Bevacizumab
 
has
 
been
 
shown
 
to
 
be
 
teratogenic
 
in
 
rabbits
 
when
 
administered
 
in
 
doses
 
that
 
are
 
two-fold
 
greater
 
than
 
the
 
recommended
 
human
 
dose
 
on
 
a
 
mg/kg
 
basis.
 
Observed
 
effects
 
included
 
decreases
 
in
 
maternal
 
and
 
fetal
 
body
 
weights,
 
an
 
increased
 
number
 
of
 
fetal
 
resorption,
 
and
 
an
 
increased
 
incidence
 
of
 
specific
 
gross
 
and
 
skeletal
 
fetal
 
alterations.
 
Adverse
 
fetal
 
outcomes
 
were
 
observed
 
at
 
all
 
doses
 
tested.
 
Angiogenesis
 
is
 
critical
 
to
 
fetal
 
development
 
and
 
the
 
inhibition
 
of
 
angiogenesis
 
following
 
administration
 
of
 
Bevacizumab
 
is
 
likely
 
to
 
result
 
in
 
adverse
 
effects
 
on
 
pregnancy .
 
It
 
is
 
not
 
known
 
whether
 
Bevacizumab
 
is
 
secreted
 
in
 
human
 
milk.
 
Because
 
human
 
IgG1
 
is
 
secreted
 
into
 
human
 
milk,
 
the
 
potential
 
for
 
absorption
 
and
 
harm
 
to
 
the
 
infant
 
after
 
ingestion
 
is
 
unknown.
 
 
Effect
 
on
 
Growth
 
and
 
Development:
 
Studies
 
of
 
bevacizumab
 
in
 
animals
 
showed
 
a
 
decrease
 
in
 
ovarian
 
function
 
and
 
abnormal
 
bone
 
growth.
 
These
 
and
 
other
 
effects
 
of
 
bevacizumab
 
may
 
potentially
 
impair
 
growth
 
and
 
development.
 
Abnormal
 
changes
 
in
 
the
 
bones
 
after
 
treatment
 
with
 
bevacizumab
 
have
 
been
 
observed
 
in
 
young
 
children
 
with
 
growing
 
bones.
 
This
 
side
 
effect
 
appeared
 
to
 
be
 
reversible
 
after
 
the
 
treatment
 
was
 
stopped,
 
but
 
has
 
not
 
been
 
assessed
 
with
 
long-term
 
use
 
of
 
the
 
drug.
 
 
Formulation
 
and
 
Stability:
 
Bevacizumab
 
is
 
supplied
 
as
 
a
 
clear
 
to
 
slightly
 
opalescent,
 
sterile
 
liquid
 
ready

When
 
dispensing,
 
it
 
is
 
extremely
 
important
 
that
 
prescribing
 
and
 
dispensing
 
include
 
clear
 
instructions
 
on
 
which

and
 
how
 
many
 
of
 
each

are
 
to
 
be
 
taken
 
per
 
day.
 
Only
 
dispense
 
what
 
is
 
needed
 
for

clearly
 
indicate
 
how
 
many

of
 
dosing
 
the
 
patient
 
will
 
have
 
and
 
how
 
many
 
days
 
are

Temodar
 
dosing.
 
When
 
counseling
 
patients,
 
it
 
is
 
important
 
for
 
each
 
patient/parent
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
capsules
 
per
 
day
 
and
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
days
 
that
 
they
 
take
 
Temodar .
 
It
 
is
 
also
 
important
 
for
 
the
 
patient/parent
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
days
 
that
 
they
 
will
 
be
 
off
 
the
 
medication.
  
 
 
Each
 
strength
 
of
 
Temodar
 
must
 
be
 
dispensed
 
in
 
a
 
separate
 
vial
 
or
 
in
 
its
 
original

TREA TMENT
 
 
 
During
 
electrode
 
replacement,
 
the
 
skin
 
below
 
the
 
electrode
 
will
 
be
 
inspected
 
by
 
the
 
physician
 
(during
 
follow
 
up
 
visits)
 
and
 
by
 
the
 
patient
 
himself
 
or
 
herself
 
(at
 
home
 
or
 
technical
 
center).
 
In
 
the
 
event
 
of
 
significant
 
skin
 
breakdown
 
(leading
 
to
 
pain
 
or
 
bleeding)
 
or
 
evidence
 
of
 
infection,
 
the
 
electrode
 
will
 
be
 
moved
 
to
 
an
 
alternate
 
site.
 
Skin
 
breakdown
 
and/or
 
infection
 
will
 
be
 
treated
 
according
 
to
 
the
 
treating
 
physician’ s
 
clinical
 
judgment
 
based
 
on
 
a
 
dermatologist's
 
recommendation.
 
 
 
Skin
 
breakdown
 
or
 
evidence
 
of
 
infection,
 
either
 
of
 
which
 
requires
 
a
 
break
 
in
 
NovoTTF-200A
 
treatment
 
greater
 
than
 
3
 
days,
 
will
 
be
 
captured
 
as
 
an
 
Adverse
 
Event.
 
 
 
Mild
 
to
 
moderate
 
contact
 
dermatitis
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
appear
 
beneath
 
the
 
electrode
 
gel
 
during
 
the
 
first
 
or
 
second
 
treatment
 
course.
 
This
 
condition
 
will
 
be
 
treated
 
as
 
follows:
 
 
1.
 
Electrode
 
location
 
will
 
be
 
shifted
 
between
 
two
 
alternate
 
sites
 
at
 
every
 
electrode
 
change.
 
 
2.
 
If
 
skin
 
is
 
inflamed
 
–
 
apply
 
0.1%
 
hydrocortisone
 
ointment.
 
 
3.
 
If
 
skin
 
is
 
breached
 
(abrasions,
 
micro-ulcerations,
 
oozing,
 
open
 
sores)
 
or
 
infected
 
–
 
Discontinue
 
hydrocortisone
 
and
 
prescribe
 
a
 
Mupirocin
 
(e.g.
 
Bactroban)
 
ointment.
 
 
4.
 
In
 
the
 
case
 
of
 
skin
 
blistering
 
–
 
apply
 
Silver
 
Sulfadiazine
 
(e.g.
 
Silverdine
 
ointment).
 
In
 
the
 
case
 
of
 
known
 
hypersensitivity
 
to
 
sulfa
 
containing
 
compounds
 
the
 
treatment
 
outlined
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
offered
 
and
 
a
 
dermatologist
 
will
 
be
 
consulted.

SITE
 
MONIT ORING:
 
 
Before
 
study
 
initiation,
 
at
 
a
 
site
 
initiation
 
visit
 
or
 
at
 
an
 
investigator ’s
 
meeting,
 
personnel
 
from
 
Hackensack
 
University
 
Medical
 
Center
 
or
 
designee
 
will
 
review
 
the
 
protocol
 
and
 
eCRFs
 
with
 
the
 
investigators
 
and
 
their
 
staff.
 
During
 
the
 
study ,
 
the
 
field
 
monitor
 
will
 
visit
 
the
 
site
 
regularly
 
to
 
check
 
the
 
completeness
 
of
 
patient
 
records,
 
the
 
accuracy
 
of
 
entries
 
on
 
the
 
CRFs,
 
the
 
adherence
 
to
 
the
 
protocol
 
to
 
Good
 
Clinical
 
Practice,
 
the
 
progress
 
of
 
enrollment,
 
and
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
study
 
device
 
is
 
utilized
 
according
 
to
 
specifications.
 
 
 
Key
 
study
 
personnel
 
must
 
be
 
available
 
to
 
assist
 
the
 
field
 
monitor
 
during
 
these
 
visits.
 
The
 
investigator
 
must
 
maintain
 
source
 
documents
 
for
 
each
 
patient
 
in
 
the
 
study ,
 
consisting
 
of
 
case

laboratory
 
data,
 
electrocardiograms,
 
and
 
the
 
results
 
of
 
any
 
other
 
tests
 
or
 
assessments.
 
All
 
information
 
recorded
 
on
 
CRFs
 
must
 
be
 
traceable
 
to
 
source
 
documents
 
in
 
the
 
patient's
 
file.
 
The
 
investigator
 
must
 
also
 
keep
 
the
 
original
 
signed
 
informed
 
consent
 
form
 
(a
 
signed
 
copy
 
is
 
given
 
to
 
the
 
patient).
 
The
 
investigator
 
must
 
give
 
the
 
monitor
 
access
 
to
 
all
 
relevant
 
source
 
documents
 
to
 
confirm
 
their
 
consistency
 
with
 
the
 
CRF
 
entries.
 
Monitoring
 
standards
 
require
 
full
 
verification
 
for
 
the
 
presence
 
of
 
informed
 
consent,
 
adherence
 
to
 
the
 
inclusion/exclusion
 
criteria
 
and
 
documentation
 
of

Additional
 
checks
 
of
 
the
 
consistency
 
of
 
the

SURGICAL
 
GUIDELINES
 
 
The
 
extent
 
of
 
surgical
 
tumor
 
resection
 
will
 
depend
 
upon
 
the
 
location
 
of
 
the
 
tumor
 
within
 
the
 
brain,
 
and
 
its
 
vascularity .
 
Surgical
 
debulking
 
of
 
recurrent
 
tumors
 
should
 
be
 
attempted
 
as
 
clinically
 
indicated.
  
 
 
 
15.1

METHODOLOGY
 
TO
 
DETERMINE
 
TUMOR
 
MEASUREMENT
  
 
 
Tumor
 
response
 
criteria
 
are
 
determined
 
by
 
changes
 
in
 
size
 
using
 
all
 
3
 
dimensional
 
measurements:
 
width
 
(W),
 
transverse
 
(T),
 
and
 
length
 
(L)
 
measurements.
 
Thus
 
for
 
all
 
tumors
 
these
 
3
 
measurements
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
recorded,
 
using
 
either
 
T1
 
or
 
T2
 
weighted
 
images
 
(which
 
ever
 
gives
 
the
 
best
 
estimate
 
of
 
tumor
 
size).
 
The
 
following
 
section
 
describes
 
the
 
methodology .
 
 
(See
 
drawing
 
below
 
for
 
illustration)
 
 
 
1.
 
Longest
 
diameter
 
of
 
target
 
lesion(s)
 
should
 
be
 
selected
 
in
 
the
 
axial
 
plane
 
only
 
for
 
CT.
 
For
 
MRI
 
imaging,
 
the
 
longest
 
diameter
 
can
 
be
 
measured
 
from
 
the
 
axial
 
plane
 
or
 
the
 
plane
 
in
 
which
 
the
 
tumor
 
is
 
best
 
seen
 
or
 
measured,
 
provided
 
the
 
same
 
plane
 
is
 
used
 
in
 
follow
 
ups.
 
 
 
2.
 
The
 
longest
 
measurement
 
of
 
the
 
tumor
 
(or
 
width,
 
W)
 
should
 
be
 
determined.
  
 
 
3.
 
The
 
2
 
perpendicular
 
measurements
 
should
 
be
 
determined
 
(transverse
 
(T)
 
measurement-perpendicular
 
to
 
the
 
width
 
in
 
the
 
selected
 
plane,
 
and
 
the
 
length
 
(L)
 
–
 
tumor
 
extent
 
in
 
the
 
plane
 
perpendicular
 
to
 
the
 
selected
 
plane)

lesions.
 
 
16.3
 
SELECTION
 
OF
 
TARGET
 
AND
 
NON-T ARGET
 
LESIONS
 
 
1.
 
For
 
most
 
CNS
 
tumors,
 
only
 
one
 
lesion/mass
 
is
 
present
 
and
 
therefore
 
is
 
considered
 
a
 
“target”
 
for
 
measurement/follow
 
up
 
to
 
assess
 
for
 
tumor
 
progression/response.
 
 
2.
 
If
 
multiple
 
measurable
 
lesions
 
are
 
present,
 
up
 
to
 
5
 
should
 
be
 
selected
 
as
 
“target”
 
lesions.
 
Target
 
lesions
 
should
 
be
 
selected
 
on
 
the
 
basis
 
of
 
size
 
and
 
suitability
 
for
 
accurate
 
repeated
 
measurements.
 
All
 
other
 
lesions
 
will
 
be
 
followed
 
as
 
non-tar get
 
lesions.
 
 
3.
 
The
 
lower
 
size
 
limit
 
of
 
the
 
target
 
lesion(s)
 
should
 
be
 
at
 
least
 
twice
 
the
 
thickness
 
of
 
the
 
slices
 
showing
 
the
 
tumor
 
to
 
decrease
 
the
 
partial
 
volume
 
effect
 
(e.g.
 
8
 
mm
 
lesion
 
for
 
a
 
4
 
mm
 
slice).
 
 
4.
 
Any
 
change
 
in
 
size
 
of
 
non-tar get
 
lesions
 
should
 
be
 
noted,
 
though
 
does
 
not
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
measured.
 
 
16.4
 
RESPONSE
 
CRITERIA
 
FOR
 
TARGET
 
LESIONS
 
 
1.
 
Response
 
criteria
 
are
 
assessed
 
in
 
3
 
dimensions
 
–
 
the
 
product
 
of
 
LxWxT .
 
An
 
elliptical
 
model
 
volume
 
(=0.5LxWxT)
 
is
 
used.
 
 
2.
 
To
 
assess
 
response/progression,
 
the
 
ratio
 
is
 
calculated:
 
 
LxWxT
   
(current
 
scan)
 
LxWxT
 
(reference
 
scan)
 
 
3.
 
Development
 
of
 
new
 
disease
 
or
 
progression
 
in
 
any
 
established
 
lesions
 
is
 
considered
 
progressive
 
disease,
 
regardless
 
of
 
response
 
in
 
other
 
lesions
 
–
 
e.g.
 
when
 
multiple
 
lesions
 
show

opposite
 
responses,
 
the
 
progressive
 
disease
 
takes
 
precedence.
 
 
4.
 
Response
 
Criteria
 
for
 
target
 
lesions:
 
 
Complete
 
Response
 
(CR):
 
Disappearance
 
of
 
all
 
target
 
lesions.
 
 
Partial
 
response
 
(PR):
 
≥65%
 
decrease
 
in
 
the
 
sum
 
of
 
the
 
products
 
of
 
the
 
three
 
perpendicular
 
diameters
 
of
 
all
 
target
 
lesions
 
(up
 
to
 
5),
 
taking
 
as
 
reference
 
the
 
initial
 
baseline
 
measurements.
 
 
Stable
 
Disease
 
(SD):
 
Neither
 
sufficient
 
decrease
 
in
 
the
 
sum
 
of
 
the
 
products
 
of
 
the
 
three
 
perpendicular
 
diameters
 
of
 
all
 
target
 
lesions
 
to
 
qualify
 
for
 
PR
 
(taking
 
as
 
reference
 
the
 
initial
 
baseline
 
measurements),
 
nor
 
sufficient
 
increase
 
in
 
a
 
single
 
target
 
lesion
 
to
 
qualify
 
for
 
PD,
 
(taking
 
as
 
reference
 
the
 
smallest
 
disease
 
measurement
 
since
 
the
 
treatment
 
started).
 
 
Progressive
 
Disease
 
(PD):
 
25%
 
or
 
more
 
increase
 
in
 
the
 
product
 
of
 
perpendicular
 
diameters
 
of
 
ANY
 
target
 
lesion,
 
taking
 
as
 
reference
 
the
 
smallest
 
product
 
observed
 
since
 
the
 
start
 
of
 
treatment
 
(see
 
exception
 
below),
 
OR
 
the
 
appearance
 
of
 
one
 
or
 
more
 
new
 
lesions,
 
OR
 
worsening
 
neurologic
 
status
 
not
 
explained
 
by
 
causes
 
unrelated
 
to
 
tumor
 
progression
 
(e.g.,
 
anticonvulsant
 
or
 
corticosteroid
 
toxicity ,
 
electrolyte
 
disturbances,
 
sepsis,
 
hyper glycemia,
 
presumed
 
post-therapy
 
swelling
 
etc.)
 
PLUS
 
any
 
increase
 
in
 
tumor
 
cross-sectional
 
area
 
(or
 
tumor
 
volume).
 
 
 
Exception
 
for
 
Early
 
Progressive
 
Disease
 
 
Because
 
both
 
radiotherapy
 
and
 
Optune
 
therapy
 
may
 
be
 
associated
 
with
 
transient,
 
reversible
 
swelling,
 
there
 
may
 
be
 
a
 
lag
 
time
 
between
 
the
 
initiation
 
of
 
therapy
 
and
 
maximal
 
anti-tumor
 
effect.
 
Removing
 
a
 
patient
 
from
 
protocol
 
therapy
 
as
 
soon
 
as
 
tumor
 
area
 
increases
 
by
 
25%
 
may
 
result
 
in
 
the
 
treatment
 
being
 
terminated
 
prematurely .
 
It
 
is
 
quite
 
possible
 
that
 
if
 
these
 
patients
 
were
 
maintained
 
on
 
protocol
 
therapy ,
 
their
 
disease
 
might
 
eventually
 
stabilize
 
and
 
even
 
regress.
 
 
Ther efore,
 
patients
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
consider ed
 
to
 
have
 
progressive
 
disease
 
and
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
removed
 
from
 
protocol
 
therapy
 
for
 
radiographic
 
worsening
 
secondary
 
to
 
local
 
tumor
 
enlargement
 
(LTE),
 
defined
 
as
 
increase
 
in
 
maximal
 
bi-dimensional
 
tumor
 
area
 
of
 
25%
 
or
 
more
 
but
 
less
 
than
 
50%,
 
and
 
with
 
no
 
new
 
lesions
 
on
 
any
 
MRI
 
performed
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
initiation
 
of
 
Cycle
 
3
 
treatment.
 
 
Thus,
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
initiation
 
of
 
Cycle
 
3
 
therapy ,
 
patients
 
should
 
only
 
be
 
removed
 
from
 
protocol
 
therapy
 
for
 
progressive
 
disease
 
if
 
there
 
is
 
50%
 
or
 
more
 
increase
 
in
 
tumor
 
area
 
(with
 
or
 
without
 
neurological
 
worsening),
 
OR
 
if
 
there
 
is
 
the
 
appearance
 
of
 
one
 
or
 
more
 
new
 
lesions
 
on
 
the
 
MRI
 
outside
 
the
 
radiation
 
port.
 
 
 
The
 
criteria
 
for
 
progressive
 
disease
 
as
 
defined
 
above
 
will
 
commence
 
with
 
all
 
MRI
 
scans
 
performed
 
during
 
Cycle
 
3
 
onwards.
 
Patients
 
whose
 
tumors
 
meet
 
these
 
criteria
 
will
 
be
 
removed
 
from
 
protocol
 
therapy .

Local
 
progression
 
is
 
defined
 
as
 
progression
 
of
 
known
 
residual
 
tumor
 
or
 
the
 
appearance
 
of
 
tumor
 
at
 
known
 
prior
 
sites
 
of
 
disease
 
that
 
were
 
at
 
some
 
point
 
without
 
evidence
 
of
 
disease.
 
Distant
 
progression
 
is
 
defined
 
as
 
the
 
appearance
 
of
 
tumor
 
at
 
sites
 
other
 
than
 
known
 
prior
 
sites
 
of
 
disease.
 
 
 
Distant
 
progression
 
most
 
often
 
occurs
 
in
 
the
 
subarachnoid
 
space
 
and
 
may
 
occur
 
at
 
any
 
point
 
within
 
the
 
neuraxis.
 
Although
 
rare,
 
extra-CNS
 
metastasis
 
represents
 
distant
 
failure.
 
Combined
 
local
 
and
 
distant
 
progression
 
is
 
defined
 
when
 
imaging
 
evaluation
 
reveals
 
local
 
and
 
distant
 
progression.

DEFINITION
 
OF
 
ADVERSE
 
EVENTS
 
 
 
As
 
defined
 
by
 
the
 
ICH
 
Guidelines
 
for
 
Good
 
Clinical
 
Practice
 
E2A
 
(CPMP/ICH/377/95),
 
an
 
adverse
 
event
 
(AE)
 
is
 
any
 
untoward
 
medical
 
occurrence
 
in
 
a
 
patient
 
administered
 
a
 
medicinal
 
product
 
and
 
which
 
does
 
not
 
necessarily
 
have
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
causal
 
relationship
 
with
 
this
 
treatment.
 
An
 
adverse
 
event
 
can
 
therefore
 
be
 
any
 
unfavorable
 
and
 
unintended
 
sign
 
(for
 
example,
 
an
 
abnormal
 
laboratory
 
finding),
 
symptom,
 
or
 
disease
 
temporally
 
associated
 
with
 
the

whether
 
or
 
not
 
considered
 
related
 
to
 
this
 
medicinal
 
product.
 
Adverse
 
events
 
include
 
the
 
following:
 
 
 
●
 
All
 
suspected
 
medication
 
adverse
 
reactions
 
 
●
 
All
 
reactions
 
from
 
medication
 
overdose,
 
abuse,
 
withdrawal,
 
sensitivity ,
 
or
 
toxicity .
 
 
●
 
Apparently
 
unrelated
 
illnesses,
 
including
 
the
 
worsening
 
of
 
a
 
preexisting
 
illness
 
 
●
 
Injury
 
or
 
accidents.
 
Note
 
that
 
if
 
a
 
medical
 
condition
 
is
 
known
 
to
 
have
 
caused
 
the
 
injury
 
or
 
accident
 
(a
 
fall
 
secondary
 
to
 
dizziness),
 
the
 
medical
 
condition
 
(dizziness)
 
and
 
the
 
accident
 
(fall)
 
should
 
be
 
reported
 
as
 
2
 
separate
 
adverse
 
events.
 
 
●
 
Abnormalities
 
in
 
physiological
 
testing
 
or
 
physical
 
examination
 
findings
 
that
 
require
 
clinical
 
intervention
 
or
 
further
 
investigation
 
(beyond
 
ordering
 
a

[confirmatory]
 
test).
 
 
●
 
Laboratory
 
abnormalities
 
that
 
require
 
clinical
 
intervention
 
or
 
further
 
investigation
 
(beyond
 
ordering
 
a

unless
 
they
 
are
 
associated
 
with
 
an
 
already
 
reported
 
clinical
 
event.
 
Laboratory
 
abnormalities
 
associated
 
with
 
a
 
clinical
 
event
 
(elevated
 
liver
 
enzymes
 
in
 
a
 
patient
 
with
 
jaundice)
 
should
 
be
 
captured
 
in
 
the
 
source
 
documents.
 
 
 
Each
 
adverse
 
event
 
is
 
to
 
be
 
classified
 
by
 
the
 
investigator
 
as
 
serious
 
or
 
non-serious.
 
This
 
classification
 
of
 
the
 
gravity
 
of
 
the
 
event
 
determines
 
the
 
reporting
 
procedures
 
to
 
be
 
followed.

found
 
in
 
the
 
revised
 
NCI
 
Common
 
Toxicity
 
Criteria
 
(CTCAE)
 
version
 
5.0
 
will
 
be
 
utilized
 
for
 
assessing
 
severity
 
of
 
adverse
 
events.
 
If
 
the
 
toxicity
 
is
 
not
 
characterized
 
adequately
 
by
 
the
 
NCI
 
toxicity
 
scale,
 
the
 
investigator
 
will
 
use
 
the
 
adjectives
 
MILD,
 
MODERA TE,
 
SEVERE
 
to
 
describe
 
the
 
maximum
 
intensity
 
of
 
the
 
adverse
 
event.
 
For
 
purposes
 
of
 
consistency ,
 
these
 
intensity
 
grades
 
are
 
defined
 
as
 
follows:
 
 
MILD
 
 
Grade
 
1
 
 
Transient
 
or
 
minimal
 
symptoms,
 
no
 
change
 
in
 
activity

However ,
 
patients
 
will
 
be
 
followed
 
to
 
assess
 
their
 
progression-free

CRITERIA
 
FOR
 
REMOV AL
 
FROM
 
STUDY
 
 
 
●
 
Any
 
serious
 
adverse
 
event
 
deemed
 
life
 
threatening
 
by
 
the
 
treating
 
physician
 
that
 
is
 
definitely
 
related
 
to
 
the
 
study
 
device
 
will
 
be
 
cause
 
for
 
immediate
 
cessation
 
of
 
treatment
 
for
 
the
 
patient.
 
 
●
 
The
 
investigator
 
may
 
remove
 
a
 
patient
 
from
 
the
 
study
 
in
 
case
 
of
 
not
 
complying
 
with
 
study
 
protocol.
 
 
●
 
Patients
 
will
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
withdraw
 
from
 
the
 
trial
 
at
 
their
 
own
 
request.
 
 
 
22.0
 
RISK/BENEFIT
 
ANAL YSIS
 
 
 
The
 
risks
 
associated
 
with
 
use
 
of
 
the
 
NovoTTF-200A
 
are
 
principally
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
electrical
 
or
 
mechanical
 
failure
 
leading
 
to
 
electrical
 
shock,
 
electromagnetic
 
interference,
 
etc.,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
risk
 
that
 
the
 
treatment
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
effective
 
in
 
delaying
 
tumor
 
progression
 
or
 
causing
 
regression.
 
Additional
 
risks
 
include
 
skin
 
irritation,
 
and
 
skin
 
breakdown
 
or
 
infection
 
at
 
electrode
 
sites.
 
Technical
 
failure
 
is
 
extremely
 
unlikely
 
due
 
to
 
stringent
 
compliance
 
with
 
all
 
standard
 
design
 
and
 
manufacturing
 
safety
 
protocols.
 
In
 
addition,
 
appropriate
 
measures
 
have
 
been
 
taken
 
to
 
minimize
 
the
 
risk
 
to
 
study
 
subjects,
 
including
 
preclinical
 
in
 
vitro
 
and
 
in
 
vivo
 
testing
 
to
 
ensure
 
safe
 
operation
 
of
 
the
 
device.
 
 
 
The
 
most
 
common
 
complication
 
seen
 
in
 
patients
 
is
 
a
 
mild
 
to
 
moderate
 
skin
 
irritation
 
beneath
 
the
 
electrode
 
gel.
 
In
 
the
 
pivotal
 
study
 
in
 
recurrent
 
GBM,
 
116
 
patients
 
were
 
treated
 
with
 
the
 
NovoTTF-200A
 
device
 
without
 
unexpected
 
device
 
events.
 
The
 
phase
 
III
 
trial
 
examining
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
the
 
NovoTTF100A
 
in
 
combination
 
with
 
temozolomide
 
demonstrated
 
clear
 
improvement
 
in
 
both
 
progression-free
 
and
 
overall
 
survival
 
compared
 
to
 
temozolomide
 
alone.
 
Considering
 
the
 
minimal
 
toxicity
 
in
 
both
 
adult
 
and
 
pediatric
 
trials
 
and
 
the
 
promising
 
efficacy
 
seen
 
in
 
several
 
adult
 
clinical
 
trials,
 
the
 
small
 
number
 
of
 
patients
 
exposed
 
to
 
this
 
treatment
 
in
 
the
 
current
 
study
 
and
 
the
 
and
 
the
 
poor
 
outcome
 
of
 
these
 
patients
 
with
 
other
 
treatments
 
–
 
we
 
conclude
 
that
 
the
 
possible
 
benefits
 
of
 
combination
 
treatment
 
with
 
NovoTTF-200A,
 
temozolomide,
 
and
 
bevacizumab
 
drastically
 
exceed
 
its
 
potential
 
risks.

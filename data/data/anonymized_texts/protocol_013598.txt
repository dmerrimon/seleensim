 SUMMARY AND JUSTIFICATION OF CHANGES   
This amendment includes revisions to Protocol Version 5.0, dated  03 November 2016, 
summarized as follows  
Change  Rationale  
Clarification that the primary  efficacy analysis 
and study unblinding will be performed when 
all data from Visit 8 (week 24) has  been 
collected. The full 12 week follow up safety data will be separately analysed.  
 
 Limiting semen PK to Visit 8/EOT and 
removal of requirement for semen PK at Visits 9, 10 and 11. 
 Performing the MBGS205 efficacy 
analysis at the earliest point will enable 
ineffective doses in MBGS206 to be discontinued and prevent subjects from MBGS205 transitioning an ineff ective 
arm of MBGS206.  
 
To reduce burden of semen sampling 
on patients ,as adequate follow up 
samples will be obtained through previously recruited patients and through the extension study MBGS206. 
 
Screened subjects increased from 700 to 2000. 
 
Change in exclusion criterion to HbA1C from <8.5% to < 10.5% . 
 
  To reflect the screen failure rate . 
 To reflect the target population which 
includes a number of patient s with type 
2 diabetes and in light of no adverse effects on glucose control in > 100 
patients within the current trial.  
 
Removal of monoclonal antibodies as 
exclusion criterion . 
 No clinical or scientific reason to 
exclude these treatments, apart from those that affect bone that are covered in a separate exclusion criterion . 
Removal of use of insulin as exclusion 
criterion . 
 To enable recruitment of representative 
target population of obese men with type 2 diabetes requiring insulin.  
Removal of exclusion critererion  for new 
prescription or over -the-counter drug known to 
affect glucose homeostasis within the 4 weeks prior to first Screening Visit.
 Already covered in exclusion criterion 
7. 
Change of exclusion  of any history of weight 
reduction surgery or procedures , to surgeries and 
procedures that have occurred in the 3 months prior to Screening .
 To enable inclusion of releavent 
patients in the target population. Ongoing significant weight effecta of surgeries prior to this time would be captured by weight loss or gai n 
exclusion criterion 12.

Protocol MBGS205    
  
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 3 of 87 
 Removal of change in smoking habit exclusion 
criterion . Change in smoking not anticipated to 
affect study assessments or safety . 
Only SAEs to be collected during screening . No requirement to collects AEs prior to 
randomisation and dosing . 
Increase semen sample timing window at baseline 
to 48 hours before/after baseline visit . To increase flexibility of sampling date 
due to difficulty patients may have in 
providing sample and travel to specialist labs.  
Plasma PK limited to testing at Visit 5 (week 12) 
and Visit 8 (EOT) . Adequate plasma PK data has now 
been collected to enable reduction in testing frequency to reduce burden on subject . 
Visits 9 and 10 changed to telephone follow up . Removal of requirement for semen PK 
at FU Visits 9 and 10 means these can be telephone only for assessment of AEs and concomitant medications . 
Window for Baseline DEXA scan increased to 
be allowed any time in screening period and up to Day 8 after randomisation. To overcome scheduling challenges 
with other assessments . 
Window for EOT DEXA scan increased to up 
to 14 days before EOT . To overcome scheduling challenges 
with other assessments and timelines to meet inclusion criteria for extension study MBGS206. 
Ability to retest inclusion/exclusion laboratory 
tests under specific circumstances of technical failure or defined abherent results on agreement with medical monitor . To prevent technical issues in 
laboratory measures inappropriately excluding subjects . 
Ability to rescreen if change in clinical status 
> 6 months after an initial screen failure if 
approved by medical monitor . To enable previously screen failed 
subjects to be recruited when there has been a change in clinical statusover time.  
Ability to re screen if a subject previously 
failed due to a inclusion/exclusion or other study requirement than has been changed in subsequent protocols . To enable previously screen failed 
subjects to be recruited when there has been a  protocolised change in study requirements . 
Clarification of follow up visits for early drug 
termination . Clarification

Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 4 of 87 
 Removal of Cyp3A4 modifying concomitant 
medications . BGS649 has been shown not to be a 
substrate or inducer of major 
Cytochrome (CYP)  450 enzymes and is 
metabolised very slowly by CYPs. Therefore, the potential of BGS649 drug- drug interactions is l ow. 
Clarification of worseining of lower limb 
oedema to exclude measurement artifacts and effects of restrictive clothing . To prevent innapropriate drug 
interruption for artefactual worsening 
of leg oedema.  
DEXA scan information changed to require 
same machine to the be used for baseline and follow up scans and greater details on technical requirements, including measurement of both femoral neck and total hip,  requirement  to apply the guidance given within the study imaging manual and to retain the primary source data from the scan.  DEXA scan procedures required to be 
tightened following variability of bone mineral density data from study to date .

Methodology:  
This is a phase IIb, multicentre, double -blind, randomised, placebo -controlled parallel -group 36-week study 
evaluating safety and efficacy of BGS649 in male obese subjects with hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism ( HH). 
The study will have three  phases:  
1. A Screening Phase lasting up to 28 days, including Day -28 to Day -1 
2. A Randomisation Phase including the Baseline visit (D ay 1) and the treatment period Day 1 to Visit  8 
(Week  24) 
3. A Safety Follow -Up Phase to Visit  11 ( Week 36 , follow -up [ FU]). Visits 9 and 10 are telephone 
assessments  
Study participation will comprise up to 2 Screening Visits, 8 visits during the treatment period up to Week  24 
(End of Treatment [EOT]) , FU Visits 9, 10 (telephone assessment s)  and 11  (at W eeks 28, 32 and 36 
respectively)  for safety performed to 12 weeks after Visit  8 (EOT).  PK in seminal fluid  will be perf ormed  at 
Visits 8  (EOT) . A minimum of 25 subjects per arm will be offered a 6 month extension study  (Protocol 
MBGS206) , starting at Visit  8 (EOT) . Subject s participating in the 6 -month  extension will have their last study 
visit at Visit  8 (EOT) . The end of the study will be the last visit of the last subject . 
Eligible subjects will be randomised on Day 1 (Baseline) in a 1:1:1 :1 ratio to one of the following treatment 
groups , consisting of three capsules per dose taken weekly : 
o BGS649  
o BGS649  
o BGS649  
o BGS649 matching placebo

Once approximately 100  of the overall planned enrolled subjects have completed the Week 4 visit, an interim 
analysis will be performed by an independent data monitoring committee (DMC) who will review unblinded 
data and determine whether the criteria  for normalisation of testosterone (testosterone within  or above  normal 
reference range for healthy adult males according to the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] criteria ) were 
met. The DMC will establish whether an individual arm has met the criteria of  ≥ 75% of subjects reaching the 
normalisation of testosterone, or whether in the opinion of the DMC following unblinded review  that when the 
arm is fully recruited it is expected to  achieve a ≥  75% response at Week 24.  Dosing arms which meet either  of 
these criteria will be deemed effective. For dosing arms deemed i neffective, dosing will be stopped and no 
further randomisation to that arm will be performed. Subject s assigned to the ineffective  or unsafe  arm(s), as 
determined per the DMC , will be discontinu ed from the treatment , will attend Visit  8 (EOT ) and will be 
followed -up for an additional 12 weeks  (FU, Visit 11 ).  
The remainder of the randomisation will then continue in a 1:1 :1 ratio of remaining active  arms versus placebo 
to the following treatment groups:  
o BGS649  
o BGS649 matching placebo.  
During the 24 week treatment period, subjects in the BGS649 groups and the matching placebo group will take 
the required  dose weekly (±  1 day  from th e time schedule of regular planned dose ) with water.  
Seminal Fluid Evaluation:  
Semen Quality  
To evaluate the effect of BGS649 treatment on sperm quality, semen analysis (sperm count, semen volume , 
concentration,  motility , and morphology) will be performed. Subject s will be expect ed to successfully  provide 
semen sample s on three occasions during  the Randomisation P hase. It is understandable that some subjects will 
not be able to provide semen samples.  
 
Semen PK  
An a dditional semen sample  will be required  at Visit 8 (EOT ) in order to assess PK in seminal fluid to evaluate 
the concentration of BGS649 .  
 
Any subjects who are vasectomised or have vasectomy planned during the study period, will be exempt  from 
semen testing.  
 
If discontinued from the study drug earlier , subjects will directly undergo Visit  8 (EOT ) and will be followed -up 
for an additional 12 weeks ( safety FU, to Visit 11). 
 
Testosterone Monitoring:  
To ensure adequate safety monitoring, serum total testosterone levels will be evaluated at each visit by an 
independent unblinded physician , and if subject meets discontinuation criteria (total testosterone is  ≥ 
1500 ng/dL (52 nmol/L) at any 2 consecutive time  points during the study ), the subject will be discontinued 
from treatment . In addition, if one of the active BGS649 study arms presents with ≥  2 subjects meeting this 
discontinuation criterion at any time point within the first 24 randomized subjects to that arm or > 15% subjects 
meet this criterion at any time point ≥  25 randomized subjects,  then the arm will be evaluated  by the 
independent DMC for potential dosing discontinuation  based on FDA guidance (FDA Advisory Committee 
Industry Briefing Document Testosterone Replacement Therapy, Sept  2014) . Subjects may be disc ontinued 
from the study arm and no further randomisation to that arm will be performed.   
Efficacy assessments will include measurement of total and calculated bioavailable testosterone, LH, FSH, 
inhibins A and B , dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) and total oestrad iol, body composition measurement including  
waist and hip circumference and  impedance, cardiometabolic parameters, PROs, physical activity and sleep 
pattern via the wearing of wrist monitors, grip strength via a dynamometer  and semen analysis. Safety 
asses sments will include vital signs, physical examination, electrocardiograms (ECGs), haematology, blood

Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration:  
Reference Therapy, Dose and Duration of Administration:  
Those subject s randomised to the placebo arm will be administered matching placebo capsules that are  
indistinguishable  to the test product in appearance and taste but contain no active ingredient.  
All doses should be taken orally by the subject, with water, on a weekly  basis (± 1 day  from the time schedule of 
regular planned dose ) at approximately the same time of the day.  
Duration of Treatment:  
All subject s will be treated with BGS649 or matched placebo for a maximum of 24 weekly doses (which 
provides  24 weeks  therapeutic coverage due to long half-life of BGS649 ). Some s ubjects who complete 24 
weeks of treatment will be invited to participate in a 6 -month blinded safety extension study (Protocol 
MBGS206 ). An interim analysis will be performed once approximately  100 of overall planned enrolled subjects 
have completed  the Week  4 visit and any doses  of BGS649 that d id not lead to normalisation of testosterone or 
were considered unsafe will be identified  and the dose arm terminated .

The safety population includes all subject s who received at least one administration of the study med ication.  
For the nonlinear mixed effects modelling, all subject s who received at least one administration and have at least 
quantifiable concentration will be included in the PK  population.  
All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analysed usin g the ITT population. The PP population will 
be used only for the analysis of the primary endpoint to examine the robustness of the primary analyses.  
Safety and tolerability will be analysed using the safety population.  
Sample Size and Power : 
Sample size f or the study is calculated using exact binomial methods for comparison of a single proportion 
to a performance goal  of 75% normalisation . This assumes a one -sided test conducted at the 2.5% 
significance level , for which  67 subject s will be enrolled in each  dose group of BGS649.  
If the true normalisation rate in a dose group of BGS649 is 90%  then the power of the study is 85%.

 7 INTRODUCTION  
7.1 Background 
Aromatase (CYP19) is highly expressed in adipose tissue, where it converts testosterone to 
oestradiol and androstenedione to oestrone. In human obesity, excess adipose tissue is 
associated with excess aromatase activity, which results in higher levels of o estradiol in men 
and women. In obese men, the relative excess of oestradiol can feed back to the hypothalamic 
pituitary axis, supressing gonadotropin secretion and thereby suppressing testicular 
testosterone production as well as spermatogenesis.  
Severe ob esity is associated with rela tive androgen deficiency in men and epidemiologic data 
support the hypothesis that excess adipose tissue contributes to the pathogenesis of 
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( HH) in obese men.  In one  study in 160  men who were  
refer red for medical or surgical treatment of obesity , HH was present in 36% subject s and the 
prevalence of HH rose linearly with increasing body mass index ( BMI ) (7.4% for a BMI of 
30-35 kg/m2 to 59.2% for a BMI >  50 kg/m2) (Hofstra et al 2008). Given the prev alence of 
obesity (which is expected to continue to increase) it is estimated that up to 1.5 million men 
in the United States ( US) and 1 million men in Europe may have androgen deficiency due to 
obesity. 
There are many consequences of testosterone deficien cy including decreased libido,  erections 
and fertility, low bone mineral density, increased risk of fractures, decreased muscle mass 
and strength, fatigue , and impact on mood and cognition  and loss of body hair (Bhasin  et al 
2006). Recent studies have also demonstrated that testosterone deficiency in older obese men 
is associated with metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance, glucose intolerance 
and lipid abnormalities,  contributing to an  increased incidence of me tabolic syndrome and 
likely increased risk of cardiovascular disease (Kapoor et al 2006). 
BGS649 is a  potent aromatase inhibitor and a derivative of the marketed drug letrozole 
(Femara). It was conceived as a long T 1/2 aromatase inhibitor for the treatment  of refractory 
endometriosis and is being evaluated in obese men with HH. In vitro experiments with 
human placenta microsomal aromatase demonstrated a  half maximal inhibitory concentration 
(IC50) for BGS649 inhibition of 6  nM, which is 100 to 300 times mor e potent than 
aminoglutethimide and in the same range of potency as letrozole, for which an IC 50 of 
11.5 nM has been reported (Bhatnagar et al 1990). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
   
  
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 24 of 87 
  
 
To date, BGS649 has also been administered to 21  obese men with HH (8 subject s were 
assigned to placebo) and was found to be well tolerated without drug discontinuation or drug 
related serious adverse events (SAEs)  (Study CBGS649A2204) . This first -in-man study was 
a 2-part study over 12 weeks (11  treatments); Part 1 was an open -label dose finding study 
(weekly, individually titrated doses) and Part 2 used a fixed dose regimen (0.3  mg loading 
dose followed by 10  weekly fixed doses of 0.1  mg). Overall, BGS649 treatment (n= 21) 
resulted in normalisation and maintenance of serum total testosterone, with no evidence of 
total testosterone peaks above the upper limit o f normal (ULN). There were few SAEs 
reported (only during Part 2 and not considered related to the study drug) and the most 
commonly reported adverse events ( AEs) included spontaneous penile erection and headache. 
Oestradiol levels were reduced by approxim ately 25 -50% on average and gonadotropin levels 
(follicle stimulating hormone [ FSH] and luteinising hormone [ LH]) were increased in 
subjects treated with BGS649 (no effect observed for subject s on placebo). At the time of the 
interim analysis of Part  1, new data (Jones  et al 2011) indicated that the variances of the 
homeostatic assessment  of insulin resistance (HOMA -IR) were larger than assumed in the 
original sample size calculations and this (along with the discovery of dosing errors) 
contributed to the decision for early termination of Part 2 of the study. 
A complete review of data obtained to date on BGS649 is presented in the most recent 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and  Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) guidelines have been 
published on the use of te stosterone replacement therapy (Testosterone Replacement 
Therapy, 2014). 
This dose- ranging study aims to demonstrate the efficacy of BGS649 to normalise 
testosterone (to within normal lab -specific reference range  i.e., total testosterone levels 
300-1000 ng /dL [10 .4-35 n mol/L] ) in ≥ 75% of a population of obese male subject s with HH 
after 24  weeks of double -blind treatment compared to placebo.  Study CBGS649A2204 
demonstrated that testosterone levels normalised within 2 to 4 weeks of dosing. However , 
any impact of testosterone levels on the symptoms and signs of hypogonadism is expected to 
take longer. Therefore, this study evaluates the normalisation of testosterone levels as a 
primary endpoint, along with key secondary/exploratory endpoints of clinical e fficacy after 
24 weeks.

This study will investigate the efficacy  of different weekly oral doses of BGS649  
 versus matching placebo in normalising testostero ne levels in ≥ 75% of a 
population of obese men with HH over a  24-week period. Subjects will be randomised to 
three treatment arms with doses of  of BGS649  or matching 
placebo . If any of the three active treatment arms is found to be ineffective  at the time of 
interim analysis and is predicted not to reach at week 24 therapeutic range in >  75% of 
subjects , or is considered unsafe per the data monitoring committee (DMC), dosing for the 
ineffective or unsafe arm(s)  will be stopped for ethical reasons (see Section 13.6).

 Doses and administration schedules were ch osen based on  data obtained from  a previous 
study where weekly administration of BGS649 was investigated. This was a 2-part clinical 
study in obese men with HH over 12  weeks (11  treatments). Part 1 was an open -label, dose 
finding study  assessing  normalisation of testosterone levels . 
Part 2 included a loading dose of in the first week, follo wed by a maintenance dose of 
weekly. The majority of subjects recruited had normalisation and maintenance of 
serum total testosterone levels with no evidence of total testosterone peaks above the ULN.  
Oral androgen therapies are generally contraindicated because of the first pass hepatic effects 
which dramatically suppress high density lipoproteins (HDL), increase thrombogenic factors 
and often cause liver function abnormalities. These hepatic effects o f androgens have so far 
limited the clinical utility of selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs). Testosterone 
gels are currently widely used but require daily skin application and have a high potential for 
resulting in overshooting of testosterone l evels above normal range and causing side effects 
such as elevated haematocrit and prostate -specific antigen (PSA) , requiring dose titration . 
Thus, an oral therapy that normalises systemic testosterone, but does not significantly 
increase local hepatic exp osure to androgens or require testosterone monitoring and dose 
titration  is the therapeutic goal of testing BGS649 in men with HH.  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and with the International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) gui delines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP).

 9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
9.1.1 Description  
This is a phase  IIb, multicentre, double -blind, randomised, placebo -controlled parallel -group 
36-week study evaluating safety and efficacy of BGS649 in male obese subjects with HH. 
The study will have t hree phases:  
1. A Screening  Phase  lasting up to 28 days (Screen Visit 1, Screen Visit 2) , including Day -
28 to Day -1 
2. A Randomisation Phase  including the Baseline  visit (Day 1) and the treatment period 
Day 1 to Visit 8 ( Week  24)  
3. A Safety Follow-U p Phase  to Visit 11 ( Week 36 , follow up [FU]). Visits 9 and 10 are 
telephone assesments.  
Study participation will comprise up to 2 Screening  Visits, 8 visits during the treatment 
period up to Week  24 (End of T reatment [EOT]) , FU Visits 9, 10 (telephone assessment)  and 
11 (at Weeks 28 , 32 and 36  respectively)  for safety performed to 12 weeks after Visit 8 
(EOT)  (see schedule of assessments, Table  9–1). PK in seminal fluid will be performed at  
Visit 8 . A minimum of 25  subjects per treatment arm will be invited to participate  in a 
6-month extension study (Protocol MBGS206), starting at Visit  8 (EOT) . This transfer will 
be handled by the interactive response technology ( IRT) and the blind will be maintained.  
Subjects participating in the 6 -month extension will have their last study visit at Visit  8 
(EOT) and will not participate in Visits 9, 10, and 11 . The study design is summarised in 
Figure 9–1. The end of the study will be the last visit of the last subject . 
Subject s that agree to participate in the trial ( informed consent form [ ICF] process completed; 
subject  has signed and dated ICF) will be screened  (Screening  Phase) and assessed against 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Symptoms of androgen deficiency will be assessed based on the 
questionnaire provided  (see Section  12.8) and all positive symptoms will be entered in the 
electronic case report form ( eCRF ).  
Testosterone levels to be taken before 11 am. If there i s evidence that screening was failed 
due to a sample inadvertently being taken after this time, technical error (for example due to 
failure to meet storage conditions defined in laboratory manual) or clinically discrepant 
results (>100ng/dl difference betw een tests with one test being <200ng/dl),   a retest  is 
allowed in discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
Due to the potential for dehydration to affect Haematocrit , subjects should be fully hydrated  
at the time of screening and during the trial when the hae matocrit is tested , to ensure a 
reliable result both for study eligibility assessment and the ongoing monitorin g (with respect 
to the haematocrit  stopping criterion).  
Eligible subjects will be randomised on Day  1 (Baseline ) in a 1:1:1 :1 ratio to one of the 
following treatment groups , consisting of three capsules per dose taken weekly:

o 
Once approximately 100  of the overall planned enrolled subjects have completed the Week 4 
visit, an interim analysis will be per formed by an independent DMC  who will review 
unblinded data and determine whether the criteria for normalisation of testosterone 
(testosterone within or above normal reference range for healthy adult males according to 
FDA criteria ) were met. The DMC will establish whether an individual arm has met the 
criteria of ≥  75% of subjects reaching the normalisation of testosterone, or whether in the 
opinion of the DMC following unblinded review  that when the arm is fully recruited it is 
expected to  achieve a ≥  75% response at Week  24 (see Section 13.6). Dosing arms which 
meet either of these criteria will be deemed effective. For dosing arms deemed to be 
ineffective, dosing will be stopped and no further randomisation to that arm will be 
performed.  Subjects assigned to ineffective or unsafe arm(s), as determined per the DMC,  
will be discontinued from the study , will attend Visit  8 (EOT) and will be followed -up for an 
additional 12 weeks (FU, Visit 11)  and will not be eligible for MBGS206 extension study . 
Recruitment will continue while the interim analysis is ongoing. 
The remainder of the randomisation will then continue in a 1:1 :1 ratio of remaining active 
arms versus placebo to the following treatment groups:  
During the 24 -week treatment period, subject s in the BGS649 groups and the matching 
placebo group will take the required dose  weekly  (± 1 day from the time schedule of regular 
planned dose ).  The treatment period consists of 2 4 weekly doses providing therapeutic 
coverage to week 24 due to long half-life of BGS649 . The capsule will be taken orally by the 
subject with water.  
Seminal Fluid Evaluation: 
Semen Quality  
To evaluate the effect of BGS649 treatment on s emen  quality, semen analysis ( semen 
volume, sperm count, concentration , motility  and morphology) will be performed. Subjects 
will be expected to success fully provide semen samples on three  occasions during the 
Randomisation P hase. It is understandable that some subjects will not be able to provide 
semen samples.  
Semen samples will be collected after a minimum of 48 hours of sexual abstinence, therefore 
no sexual activity should be performed in this time period and no spermicidal cream used to 
avoid interference with semen evaluation.  
Semen PK  

Mereo BioPharma 2 Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol MBGS205    
  
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 30 of 87 
 Additional semen sam ples will be required a t EOT  in order to assess PK in seminal fluid to 
evaluate the concentration of BGS649 at steady state. Seminal fluid PK will be assessed at 
Visit 8  (EOT ) (Section  11.3.7). For subjects that are disconti nued early from the study drug , 
an EOT sample will be obtained .  
Any subjects who are vasectomised or have vasectomy planned during the study period, will be exempt . 
Semen samples  at baseline be taken up to 48 hours before  or after the Baseline Visit. During 
Randomisation Phase semen samples may be provided up to 48 hours before or after the Assessment visit.  
 
Testosterone Monitoring:  
To ensure adequate safety monitoring, serum  total testosterone levels will be evaluated at 
each visit by an independent unblinded physician (see Section  9.3.6 and Section  16.3)  and if 
subject meets discontinuation criteria ( total testosterone is ≥ 15 00 ng/dL ( 52 nmol/L) at any 2 
consecutive time  points during the study ), the subject  will be discontinued from treatment. In 
addition, if one of the active BGS649 study arms presents with ≥  2 subjects meeting this 
discontinuation criterion at any time point within the first 24 randomized subjects to that arm 
or > 15% subjects meet this cr iterion at any time point ≥  25 randomized subjects, then the 
arm will be evaluated by the independent DMC for potential dosing discontinuation based on 
FDA guidance (FDA Advisory Committee Industry Briefing Document Testosterone Replacement Therapy, Sept  2014) . Subjects may be discontinued from the study arm and no 
further randomisation to that arm will be performed.   
Efficacy and safety variables will be assessed according to the schedule of assessments in Table 9–1. Efficacy assessments will include measurement of  total and  calculated  
bioavailable testosterone , LH, FSH, inhibins A and B , dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ), and total 
oestradiol, body composition measurement including waist and hip circumference and  
impedance, cardiometabolic parameters, PROs,  physical activity and sleep pattern via the 
wearing of wrist monitors,  grip strength via a dynamometer  and semen analysis. Safety 
assessments will include v ital sign s, physical examination,  electrocardiograms ( ECGs ), 
haematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis, bone turnover markers, DEXA scan, PSA, and 
recording of AEs, SAEs, AEs of special interest (AESIs)  and concomitant medications. 
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected as follows  (see Table 9–1) : 
1. Plasma PK samples will be taken pre -dose and 1h post -dose at Visit 5. At Visit 8 (EOT; 
Week  24) it will be taken only once . 
2. Semen samples for seminal fluid PK will be taken at Visit 8  (EOT)  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the normalisation of total testosterone  in ≥ 75% of subject s 
at Week  24. S econdary and exploratory efficacy endpoints are presented in  Section  11.2, and 
safety endpoints in Section  12.2.

 9.2 Discussion of Study Design  
This phase IIb, randomised, multi -centre, double -blind, parallel group, placebo -controlled 
24-week study design is considered suitable for the assessment of normalisation of serum  
testosterone levels , the effect on clinical sympt oms and signs, and safety and tolerability  in 
adult obese male  subjects with HH.  
The assessment methods used to demonstrate the efficacy of BGS649 in normalising  
testosterone levels in ≥ 75% of subject s after 24 weeks of double -blind treatment are 
consider ed appropriate . For the primary efficacy endpoint, a clinically significant treatment 
effect is considered to be 75%  of subjects attaining  total testosterone levels within normal 
therapeutic range . This is  in line with the current regulatory efficacy endpoint (FDA) , where 
75% subject s with testosterone in the therapeutic range was the recommended target for 
clinical trials with hypogonadism  (Testosterone Replacement Therapy, 2014) . 
The doses of BGS649 selected for use in this study ) are chosen 
based on results obtained in a previous study in obese male  subjects  with HH , which 
suggested  that these doses were well tolerated and may normalise testosterone levels (Study 
CBGS649A2204). However, to attempt to define a no-effect dos e (NED ), there will be an 
interim analysis conducted once approximately 100  of overall planned enrolled subjects have 
completed the Week  4 visit (see Section 13.6). If any of the initial three active treatment arms 
is found to be ineffective  or unsafe, dosing for the ineffective or unsafe arm(s)  will be 
stopped for ethical reasons. 
The selected dosing schedule (1  intake per week) was chosen based on the PK properties of 
BGS649, which indicate rapid absorption (time at which the maximum serum  concentration 
is reached [T max] of 1h), extensive distribution and a prolonged elimination phase 
(elimination hal f-life of 21  days)  (Study CBGS649A2204). Previous studies also indicated  
that a once weekly or monthly administration of BGS649 should provide continuous, stable 
levels of aromatase inhibition  (Study CBGS649A2101) . The treatment period of 24  weeks is 
considered to be a suitable length to allow demonstration of the primary objective  on 
dose- finding for testosterone normalisation and clinical effects.  
Aromatase inhibitors decrease oestrogen synthesis and increase pituitary LH and FSH with a 
consequent stimulation of testosterone production  (de Boer et al 2005; Loves et al  2008). 
This increase in testosterone has multiple clinical effects, including:  
1. Effect on insulin resistance with an improvement observed specifically in subject s with 
Baseline  high insul in resistance  (Cai et al  2014; Traish et al  2014) . Therefore multiple 
cardiovascular risk markers and HOMA -IR as a marker for insulin resistance will  be 
evaluated during this study. 
2. Effect on body composition leading to an increase in lean body mass and a decrease in 
total fat mass  (Wang et al  2000) . Therefore change in body c omposi tion will be 
evaluated .

 3. Effect on sleep pattern, ( Barrett -Connor  et al.,2008) increase in strength and stamina and 
physical activity Therefore, sleep quality and duration, streng th, stamina and physical 
activity will be evaluated   
4. Effect on sexual well -being leading to substantial improvements in erectile dysfunction 
and libido/sexual desire (Pexman -Fieth et al., 2014). Therefore, sexual functioning, 
including erectile function, will be evaluated via the International Index of Erectile 
Function (IIEF) PRO and via the Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
System(®) Sexual Function and Satisfaction (PROMIS(®) SexFS) PRO (Flynn et al., 
2013)  
5. Effect on fatigue leading to substantial improvements in fatigue (Pexman -Fieth et al., 
2014). Therefore, levels of fatigue will be evaluated via the PROMIS Fatigue Short Form and Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) (Mendoza et al., 1999) and levels of vitality via the 
Short Form 36 (SF -36) Vitality domain  
6. Effect on overall well -being and health status is inconsistent, with open label but not 
randomised studies finding an improvement in mood and well -being (Spitzer et al, 2013). 
Therefore quality of life will be evaluated via the Short Form 36 (SF -36) (McHorney et 
al., 1994) and via Patient Global Impression of Status items (PGI -S)  
7. Total and domain scores on PRO  measures will then be  compared to objective 
measurement of functionality via actigraphy evaluating the time spent in sedentary, 
mode rate and vigorous physical activity and sleep, and assessment of muscle strength by 
assessing grip strength.  
Bone density decrease is a class effect of aromatase inhibitors via a mechanism of decreased oestrogenic production. BGS649 has been shown to decre ase oestrogen by 25 -50%, 
potentially affecting the bone formation process  and leading to osteoporosis  
(Study  CBGS649A2204) . In a single dose study in post -menopausal women, BGS649 at the 
highest doses of 10 and 20 mg showed a small but clinically significa nt decrease in bone 
density limited to the lumbar spine at 6 months. In clinical studies to date  there has been no 
consistent effect of BGS649 on bone resorption biomarkers  and no effects of BGS649 on 
bone density were demonstrated at 12 weeks in the previ ous study in males with 
hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism . The planned study may be  too short to detect  a significant 
effect on bone density, as evaluated by DEXA scan, but bone formation and resorption 
markers will be monitored.  However , there will be an extension study pla nned that will 
evaluate bone density  by D EXA.  
An increase of LH and FSH stimulates spermatogenesis and in this way may improve fertility. However excessive testosterone exposure could lead to testicular atrophy  and 
therefore this study will monitor semen parameters  (Crosnoe et al  2013) . It will be accepted 
that not all subject will be able to provide semen sample on all visits. Vasectomised subjects 
or those who have vasectomy planned during the study period will be exempt from this 
assessment.

 BGS649 has been shown to be  present in semen  in a previous study  (Study 
CBGS649A2204) . PK assessment of seminal fluid will be performed to further monitor the 
levels of BGS649 present in the semen at the three doses  used in this study . 
Aromatase in hibitors, such as BGS649 c ould theoretically  cause androgens to rise above 
normal ranges , potentially leading to elevation of  haematocrit , spermatogenesis suppression 
and worsening of  other parameters . Such effects have not been observed in the previous 
human BGS649 study (Study CBGS649A2204) or other aromatase inhibitor studies 
(Saylam  et al 2011) and therefore the likelihood of these effects being observed in this study 
is low  due to a functioning feedback loop. However, to ensure adequate safety monitoring, 
testosterone  levels will be  monitor ed throughout the study  by an unblinded independent 
physician.  In the event of subject s presenting with total testosterone  ≥ 1500 ng/dL 
(52 nmol/L ) at any 2 consecutive time points , treatment will be discontinued 
(see Section  9.1.1) .  
9.2.1 Risk/Benefit and Ethical Assessment  
BGS649 is a highly specific and potent aromatase inhibitor , which is structurally related to 
letrozole (Femara), a currently marketed aromatase inhibito r.  
Oestrogens in men, together with testosterone, contribute to the regulation of LH and FSH 
levels and therefore an aromatase inhibitor such as BGS649 is expected to increase 
gonadotrophins and lead to an increase in androgen levels. This is both the on- target 
pharmacology of aromatase inhibitors , and a clinical risk, as pharmacologic suppression of 
aromatase in men can cause androgens to rise above  normal ranges (Loves et al 2008). Acute 
consequences of elevated androgens are rare; however chronic testos terone elevation can lead 
to testicular atrophy via suppression of gonadotrophins, and suppression of  spermatogenesis. 
Other effects of high testosterone include  elevation of haematocrit , effect on prostate and 
elevation of PSA and cardiovascular effects.  The measures which will be  used in this study to 
monitor/avoid these risks are described in Section  9.2. 
Administration of BGS649 therefore presents  a theoretical risk of impaired spermatogenesis 
and infertility, although this is regarded as  generally  reversible based on clinical experience 
with androgens and aromatase inhibitors, and on pre -clinical studies in dogs dosed with 
BGS649 (Study  1070172 and Study  1170689) . The emerging pre -clinical profile of BGS649 
predicts multiple beneficial effects on the pathophysiology of HH. Administration of BGS649 in men has not led to significantly elevated levels of testosterone. It is expected that the 
benefits of BGS649 will be similar to those of testosterone (standard of care treatment), including improvement in serum testosterone levels and hypogonadal  signs and symptoms . It 
may also potentially improve fertility via restoration of LH and FSH feedback loops (see 
Section  9.2 for further details).  
Decrease in oestrogen is a risk factor for osteoporosis development in a postmenopausal 
woman. Administration of BGS649 in man leading to reduction of e stradiol levels  may 
therefore represent a risk potentiall y leading to decrease in bone density and development of 
osteoporosis .  
Mereo BioPharma 2 Ltd  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol MBGS205    
 
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 39 of 87 
 BGS649 does not exhibit genotoxicity, and is not a substrate or inducer of major Cytochrome 
(CYP ) 450 enzymes. It has shown 100 -fold selectivity for CYP19  inhibition compared to 
other CYPs and has also shown minimal inhibition of CYP2A6, which is considered to be 
unlikely to be relevant at therapeutic drug concentrations. In addition, BGS649 is metabolised 
very slowly by CYPs. Therefore, the potential of BGS649 d rug-drug interactions from a PK 
perspective is considered to be low.  
The most common side effects associated with BGS649 include headache, sweats, increased 
incidence of morning erections, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, diarrhoea , 
musculoskele tal pain, insomnia and abnormal hair growth . Based on safety pharmacology 
studies in animals , BGS649 is not anticipated to cause cardiovascular,  central nervous system 
or respiratory AEs . No significant corrected QT interval (QT C) or QT C by Fridericia’s  
correction method  (QT CF) prolongation was observed in subjects across a wide range of 
doses up to ). Therefore  a large therapeutic index is expected in humans . 
Based on the benefit/risk profile of BGS649 in obese male  subjects with HH, BGS649 is 
expected to normalise testosterone levels with very few adverse effects. This study compares 
the effect of different doses of BGS649  with a matched placebo in 
the normalisation of testosterone levels in obese male  subjects  with HH.

There are three categories of subjects that may be considered for rescreening:  
1.Subjects who met inclusion criteria 3 to 6 at S creenin g Visits 1, but who were not 
randomised or received study drug , may be rescreened at a later date.  
2.Subjects who failed screening due to an inclusion/exclusion criterion or other study 
requirement  that has been changed through a protocol amendment may als o be rescreened  at 
a later date  
Mereo BioPharma 2 Ltd  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol MBGS205    
 
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 43 of 87 
 3. Subjects who failed inclusion criteria 3 to 6 at screening >  6 months previously, and where 
the clinical situation has changed so that in the investigators judgement they may now meet 
the criteria may also be rescreened . To include where there was screen failure on total 
testosterone inclusion criterion through clinically discrepant results (>100ng/dl difference 
between tests with one test being < 200ng/dl) . 
Prior to rescreening, every case has to be discussed and approved by Medical Monitor.  
Rescreening is allowed only one time per screened subject. Rescreened subjects  will receive a 
new Screening number. Previous Screening numbers will not be reused. Rescreened subjects 
will need to repeat complete S creening assessment (except bone mineral density measured by 
DEXA if it still falls within 6  months of rescreening visit) starting with signing  the ICF . 
9.3.4 Retesting of  laboratory parameters  
 Retesting of individual laboratory procedures may be permitted in the following 
circumstances  
• When there is obvious methodological issue (hemolysed sample, dilution or 
calculation error)  or sampling error documented at the site (sampling time is outside 
the window, incorrect procedure followed)  
• When a data point is considered aberrant ,  including where there was screen failure on 
total testosterone  inclusion criterion through clinically discrepant results (>100ng/dl 
difference between tests with one test being < 200ng/dl). Also where  the value   reported 
would be incompatible   with life or in a range clearly discrepant with   current medical 
status of the subject .  
 In either of these instances, the investigator should get approval to repeat laboratory 
parameters from  the medical monitor.  The reason for re -test should be recorded by the 
Investigator in the patient’s source documentation. 
9.3.5 Early Terminati on 
The study may be terminated at any time by the sponsor if serious side effects should occur, 
or per the DMC decision . In the event of an early termination of the study, the sponsor will 
inform the study investigators, institutions and all regulatory aut horities.  
9.3.6 Withdrawal of S ubject s from the Study  
Subject s may voluntarily withdraw consent to participate in the study for any reason at any 
time.  
Withdrawal of consent occurs when a subject  does not want to participate in the study 
anymore and does not want to attend any further visits or assessments, have further 
study -related contact, or allow analysis of already obtained biologic material.  
If a subject  withdraws consent, the investigator  must make every effort to determine the 
primary reason for this decision and record this information. Investigational treatments must 
be discontinued and no further assessments conducted. All biological material that has not 
been analysed at the time of wi thdrawal may be used , unless  consent for its use is withdrawn 
in writing.  Further attempts to contact the subject  are not allowed unless safety findings 
require communication or follow -up. 
Under the following circumstances the subject  MUST be withdrawn from the study:  
Mereo BioPharma 2 Ltd  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol MBGS205    
 
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 44 of 87 
 1. Withdrawal of informed consent  
2. Any safety reasons,  clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in 
the opinion of the investigator  or sponsor  indicates that continued participation in the 
study is not in the best intere st of the subject  
3. Exogenous testosterone use or additional monitoring of testosterone levels that 
inadvertently unblinds the subject’s study arm allocation 
4. Severe non -compliance to the protocol, as judged by the investigator  and/or sponsor  
5. Treatment code or unblinding prematurely broken by the investigator  
6. Termination of the study by the sponsor  
7. Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious disease) 
illness.  
9.3.7 Study Drug Interruption and Discontinuation  
Subject s may voluntarily discontinue investigational treatment for any reason at any time.  
At the time of study drug discontinuation, the subject  should have (as soon as possible) an 
EOT visit with the assessments that are normally done at the Week  24 visit  (this should take 
place within 7 days of discontinuat ion of study drug). In addition subjects  who discontinue 
the study drug are expected to complete the  12 week follow -up pe riod (Visits 9, 10 and 11) to 
collect safety data. 
Subject s who have discontinue before Week 12 (Visit 5) are not required to  
have EOT DEXA scan measured  The subjects will in addition provide semen sample for PK 
analysis at Visits  8 (EOT ) , unless they are not able to provide the samples . This applies also 
to a subject  discontinued because of elevated testosterone as determined by an unblinded 
physician and if the whole treatment arm is discontinued because of elevated testosterone 
level as d etermined by DMC . The investigator  and study staff must discuss with the subject , 
the subject ’s continued participation in the study and request subject s to continue attending 
follow -up visits according to the study visit schedule. A study arm may be disco ntinued from 
the treatment at the Week  4 visit as decided by DMC during interim analysis (see 
Section  9.1). Discontinued subjects will not be replaced. Those subjects will attend only 
Visit 8 (EOT) and will be followed at FU -Visit s 9, 10 and 11 ( to 12 weeks after EOT).  
The only exception to this requirement is when a subject  withdraws consent for all study 
procedures including post -treatment study follow -up or loses the ability to consent freely 
(i.e., is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or 
physical illness).  
If the subject  cannot, or is unwilling to attend the follow -up visits, the site staff should 
request maintenance of regular phone contact with the subject , or with a person 
pre-designated by the subject . This phone contact should preferably be performed according 
to the study visit schedule. Data concernin g the subject ’s health status, including information 
regarding new/concomitant treatments, AEs, AESIs, i.e., rash and vital status will continue to 
be collected.  
Mereo BioPharma 2 Ltd  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol MBGS205    
 
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 45 of 87 
 If the subject  decides to completely withdraw from the study (refuses any further study 
partic ipation or contact) all study participation for that subject  will cease and data to be 
collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing.  
The investigator  must also contact the IRT to register the subject ’s discontinuation from 
investigational trea tment.  
If study drug is discontinued prior to the subject ’s completion of the study, the reason for the 
discontinuation must be documented in the subject ’s med ical records and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.  
If the subject temporari ly discontinue study drug because of AE or SAE or other relevant 
issue, investigator may restart if considered medically safe and in discussion with the Medical 
Monitor . 
Investigational treatment MAY be permanently discontinued under the following 
circumst ances:  
1.  Significant worsening of lower extremity oedema  (demonstrated by use of the same 
technique of evaluation for comparison over time and which is not due to local pressure /venostasis effects such as may be caused by socks or other clothing) . 
2. Significant worsening of obstructive urinary symp toms 
Investigational treatment MUST be permanently discontinued under the following 
circumstances:  
3. Total testosterone ≥ 15 00ng/dL ( 52 nmol/L) at any two consecutive scheduled visits 
during the study  
4. Liver la boratory values of: 
o ALT or AST >5 times the ULN  
If the increase in ALT or AST, is associated with normal bilirubin and ALP, t he 
medical evaluation of withdrawing a patient can be made on a repeat AST/ALT test 
taken within 48 hours. (Repeated parameters should include: ALT, AST, Alkaline 
phos phatase and total bilirubin). The s ubject should interrupt   study drug until 
the  repeat   liver enzymes are available. If repeat liver parameters are all within the 
normal  range, dosing may be continued.  If not normalised the subject should be 
permanently  discontinued.  
or 
o ALT or AST >3 times the ULN and bilirubin total >2 times ULN or International 
Normalised Ratio ( INR) >1.5 or the appearance of worsening fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, right upper quadrant pain/tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia . 
o A hepatic event leading to subject discontinuation should be followed up until event 
resolution, or becomes not clinically sig nificant  
5. Any of the following laboratory abnormalities: 
o Renal function values that require discontinuation:  
Mereo BioPharma 2 Ltd  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol MBGS205    
 
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 46 of 87 
 • Discontinue investigational treatment for a subject if individual serum creatinine 
increases ≥50% compared to Baseline (and is considered clinically  significant), or 
in the event of treatment emergent proteinuria (albumin:creatinine ratio [ACR]  
>300 mg/g or >30  mg/mmol; protein:creatinine ratio [ PCR ] ≥500 mg/g or 
>50 mg/mmol) . (Creatinine  can be  repeat ed once within 7 days of  initial alert. 
Study  drug  administration should be suspended during this time  and resumed only 
if  repeat creatinine is back to pre -alert level)   
• A renal event leading to subject discontinuation should be followed up until event 
resolution (serum creatinine within 10% of Baseline , protein- creatinine ratio 
within 50% of Baseline ), stabilises or becomes not clinically significant, or is 
assessed as being chronic.  
6. Subject missed 4 or more consecutive study drug dosing . 
7. Development of prostate cancer or PSA increase more than 1.4 ng/ml above Screening  
level. It is recommended that in these cases subject s undergo urologic consultation. 
8. Haematocrit >54 % (Hematocrit  can be  repeat ed once within 7 days of   initial alert. 
Study  drug  administration should be suspended during this time  and re sumed only 
if repeat  hematocrit is under 54%)  
9. Development of sleep apnoea . 
10. Development of cardiovascular event  (significant arrhythmia a cute myocardial infarction, 
brain stroke, t ransient i schemic attack, unstable angina, c ongestive heart failure) . 
11. Emergence of the following adverse events:  
o Absolute QTcF >500 msec, or a rise of QTcF of ≥ 60 msec above baseline confirmed 
by triplicate ECG measurements . 
12. Pregnancy in female sexual  partner of the male study subject , occurring after the start of 
study tre atment . 
13. Fragility bone fracture . 
14. Breast cancer . 
 
Procedures for handling patients incorrectly enrolled or randomized  
Subjects who fail to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria must not be enrolled or randomized.  
If a subject not meeting the study criteria is randomized in error, a discussion must occur 
between the Medical Monitor and the investigator regarding whether t o continue or 
discontinue the subject from the study. If agreement is reached, the subject should complete 
the study unless there are safety concerns or if the subject withdraws the consent.  
 
9.3.8 Lost to Follow -up 
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subject s to determine and report their ongoing 
status.  This includes follow -up with persons authorised by the subject . Lost to follow -up is 
defined by the inability to reach the subject  after a minimum of three documented phone 
calls, faxes or emails, as well as a lack of response by the subject  to one registered mail letter.  
All attempts should be documented in the subject ’s medical records.  If it is determined that

 the subject  has died, the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and c ause 
of death.  
If the investigator ’s use of a third -party representative to assist in the F ollow -Up Phase of the 
study has been included in the subject ’s informed consent, then the investigator  may use a 
sponsor -retained third -party representative to assis t site staff with obtaining subject ’s contact 
information or other public vital status data necessary to complete the Follow -Up Phase  of 
the study. The site staff and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as 
public health registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. If, after 
all attempts, the subject  remains lost to follow -up, then the last known alive date as 
determined by the investigator s should be reported and documented in the subject ’s medical 
recor ds.

10.2.1  Packaging 
A unique medication number is printed on the label of each pack  which corresponds to one of 
the treatment regimens.  Investigator staff will identify the investigational treatment to 
dispense to the subject  by contacting the IRT and obtaining the medication number(s).  
Records of subjects assigned medication  numbers will be recorded in source documentation.

 10.2.2  Labelling  
Labels will comply with the legal requirements of each country and be printed in the local 
language.  They will supply no information about the subject s. 
10.2.3  Storage 
 
 
 
10.2.4  Blinding an d Randomisation of Study Treatment(s) 
At Visit 1 ( Baseline ) all eligible subject s will be randomised via the IRT to one of the four 
treatment regimens   in a 1:1:1 :1 
ratio.  After the interim analysis  (see Section 13.6), if one or more of the BGS649 study arms 
is discontinued by the DMC, the dosing for that arm(s) will be stopped and no further 
randomisation to that arm will be performed . The remaining subjects will be randomised in a 
1:1:1 ratio into remaining active arms:  
The investigator  or his/he r delegate will contact 
the IRT after confirming that the subject  fulfils all the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  The IRT 
will assign a medication number to the subject , which will be used to link the subject  to a 
treatment regimen and will spec ify a unique medication number on the label  of 
investigational treatment to be dispensed to the subject . The randomisation number will not 
be communicated to the caller.  
The randomisation numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that 
treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from subject s and investigator  staff.  A 
subject  randomisation list will be produced by ICON Biostatistics using a validated system 
that automates the random assignment of subject  numbers to randomisation numbers.  These 
randomisation numbers are linked to the different treatment regimens, which in turn are 
linked to medication numbers.  A separate medication list will be produced using a validated 
system that automates the random assignment of medication numbers to packs containing the 
investigational drug.  
Subject s, investigational staff, persons performing the assessments and data analysts (other 
than those described below) will remain blind to the identity of the treatments  
 from the time of randomisation until database 
lock. In order to maintain the blind described above, testosterone measurements will be 
blinded to site and sponsor staff and monitoring will be performed by an independent 
unblinded physician. T he interim  analysis will be performed by an independent unblinded 
committee (see Section  16.3). 
The blind will be maintained using the following methods: 
1. Randomisation data will be kept strictly confidential until the time of blinding, and will 
not be accessible to anyone involved in the study 

Mereo BioPharma 2 Ltd  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol MBGS205    
 
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 50 of 87 
 2. The identity of the treatments will be concealed by the use of investigational treatment 
that is identical in packagin g, labelling, schedule of administration and appearance . 
Should a situation arise where unblinding is required, the investigator  at that site may 
perform immediate unblinding without the need for communication with the sponsor  (see 
Section  10.3) . 
10.3 Procedure for Breaking the Randomisation Code 
Emergency treatment code breaks should only be undertaken when it is essential to treat the 
subject  safely and efficaciously.  Most often, investigational treatment discontinuation and 
knowledge of the possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study subject  who 
presents with an emergency condition. Emergency code breaks are performed u sing the IRT.  
When the investigator  contacts the system to break a treatment code for a subject , he/she 
must provide the requested subject  identifying information and confirm the necessity to break 
the treatment code for the subject . The investigator  will then receive details of the 
investigational drug treatment for the specified subject  and a fax or email confirming this 
information. The system will automatically inform the ICON site monitor, the medical 
monitor, and the ICON Project Manager that the code  has been broken, but no treatment 
assignment will be communicated.  
It is the investigator ’s responsibility to ensure that there is a procedure in place to allow 
access to the IRT in case of emergency.  The investigator  will inform the subject  how to 
contact his/her backup in cases of emergency when he/she is unavailable. The investigator  
will provide the protocol number, investigational treatment name if available, subject  
number, and instructions for contacting the local entity which has responsibility for emergency code breaks to the subject  in case an emergency treatment code break is required 
at a time when the investigator  and backup are unavailable.  
10.4 Subject  Compliance  
Each time study medication is dispensed subject s will be informed about compliance. When 
study medication is returned, compliance will be assessed based on the subject ’s interview 
and a count of the tablets. The investigator  (or designee) will record the amount of study 
medication dispensed and returned at each visit, as well as document the reasons for non-
compliance in the source document. The investigator will record the date and time of the study drug intake to the EDC. The subject  should be re -educated regarding treatment 
compliance and/or recording dose. A significant noncompliance with protocol or study drug 
will be communicated to the sponsor. 
10.5 Study Treatment Accountability  
Records shall be maintained of the delivery of study treatments to the study  centres , the 
inventory at the study centres , the use of each subject  and the return to the sponsor . 
These records shall include dates, quantities, batch numbers, expiry dates and the unique code 
numbers assigned to the study medication and to the study su bject s. 
The investigator  shall be responsible for ensuring that the records adequately document that 
the subject s were provided the doses specified in the protocol and that all study medication

Protocol MBGS205    
 
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 51 of 87 
 received from the sponsor is reconciled.  All study medication  must be returned to the sponsor 
at the end of the study. 
10.6 Contraception  
Semen samples will be collected after a minimum o f 48 hours of sexual abstinence , therefore 
no sexual activity should be performed in this time period and no spermicidal cr eam used to 
avoid interference with semen evaluation.  
10.7 Prohibited  Therapy

11.3 Efficacy  Assessments  
All efficacy assessments will be performed according to the schedule o f assessments 
(Table 9–1).  
11.3.1 Male Hormonal Parameters  
Testosterone  
Serum  total testos terone  and sex hormone binding globulin ( SHBG ) levels will be  measured . 
Bioavailable testosterone will be calculated.  
All serum total testosterone and SHBG laboratory parameters are to be taken before 11 am.  
Samples are to be separated within an hour of being taking to prevent artificial increases in 
testosterone le vels, and further stored and transported as described in the laboratory manual.  
If total testosterone  is ≥ 1500ng/dL ( 52 nmol/L) at any 2  consecutive measurements (time  
points) during the study, the subject  will be discontinued from treatment (see Section  9.3.6).  
Testosterone monitoring will be blinded to the subject , sponsor  and investigator s and a 
decision about discontinuing BGS649/placebo will be made by an independent unblinded 
physician on a one to one basis after detailed evaluation of the subject  (Section  10.2.4 and 
Section  16.3) . It is important that investigators do not monitor testosterone independently of 
the study protocol as this will have the potential to inadvertently unblind the protocol. A subject may be withdrawn from the study if there was unblinded testosterone monitoring in 
addition what is described in the protocol . 
Other Parameters  
LH, FSH, Inhibins A and B, total oestradio l and DHT will be assessed . 
11.3.2 Body Composition  
Body weight will be measured as part of the vital signs assessment ( Section  12.6).  
BMI  
Body weight  will be measured at the same time of day (± 30  minutes)  at each assessment , 
before eating. Subject s should be instructed to wear similar clothing at each visit where 
weight will be  measured. Shoes and heavy accessories should be removed prior to 
measurement. Study staff should ensure that the same scale is used for the same subject  at 
each assessment, and that the scales have been properly calibrated.  
Height will be measured at Screening to enable BMI determination.  
BMI  is to be calculated from the height obtained at S creening.  The BMI is calculated by 
dividing the measured subject  weight by the square of the measured subject  height, and is 
expressed in kg/m2. 
Waist C ircumference/ Hip Circumference  
Measurements will be taken  to the nearest 0.1 cm.  
Mereo BioPharma 2 Ltd  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol MBGS205    
 
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 56 of 87 
 The waist measurement  (in cm) will be taken by measuring the circumference distance 
around the waist at the mid -point between the lowest rib and the top of the hip bone (iliac  
crest). The hip measurement  (in cm) will be taken by measuring the distance around the 
largest extension of the buttocks and at the level of the bony prominences felt in the front of 
the hips. 
The waist to hip ratio  will be calculated by dividing the wais t girth by the hip girth.  
Measurements will preferably be performed using a flexible tape measure (provided  for the 
study ) and a non- permanent pen for marking the skin. If a plastic or cloth tape is used, it 
should be regularly checked against a metal tape  to ensure that it has not stretched with 
prolonged use. Measurements should be made with the measuring tape placed firmly against 
the skin, but not so tight that it is compressing the skin. The tape should be placed so that it is 
lying flat and horizontal  on the skin, parallel to the floor. Subject s should be asked to relax 
and exhale before the measurements are read . 
Gynecomastia  
Breast examination will be performed by palp ation by an investigator . The subject  will be in 
a supine position with hands behind their head. Investigator s will perform a thorough 
examination of the breasts, noting their size and consistency, presence of any nipple discharge or axillary lymphadenopathy. The purpose is to look for or monitor enlargement or 
irregularities of glandular breast tissue . The i nvestigator will then document the findings and, 
if gynecomastia is present, will document size of glandular breast tissue in 
centimetres /inches . 
Body composition by bioimpedance  
Bioelectrical impedance analysis estimates body  composition. Measuring electrical 
impedance or opposition to the flow of an electric current through body tissues will be used 
to estimate and calculate subcutaneous and visceral body fat and proportion of muscle during 
the study.  
The evaluation takes a f ew minutes . Subjects should be well hy drated (drinking water the 
night before and morning before assessment)  and rested prior to the measurements as 
impedance is influenced by hydration  and exercise.  
11.3.3 Cardiometabolic Parameters  
Blood pressure (SBP and DBP)  will be measured as part of the vital signs analysis 
(Section  12.6).  
All blood samples are to be collected after 8 hours fasting, after ECG and vita l sign 
measurements  
HbA1c, fasting lipids ( total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides), fasting glucose and insulin 
and hs -CRP will be measured. In addition HOMA -IR will be calculated to estimate insulin 
resistance using the following formula:  
HOMA- IR = [g lucose (nmol/L) * insulin (µU/mL)/22.5], where glucose and insulin must be 
fasting  (Matthews et al  1985) . 
Mereo BioPharma 2 Ltd  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol MBGS205    
 
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 57 of 87 
 Insulin use will be documented with in the concomitant  medications to enable  the analysis of 
insulin and HOMA -IR to be appropriately performed to exclude the confounding effects of 
exogenous insulin use. 
11.3.4 Patient Reported Outcomes  
The impact of BGS649 on various aspects of subject ’s health -related quality of life will be 
assessed using  the following questionnaires . Ideally, PROs are to be evaluated before any 
other study  activity is performed  
International Index of E rectile F unction 
The IIEF is a 15 -item self -administered questionnaire , providing a quantitative index of 
erectile dysfunction severity by examining the following five relevant areas  of sexual 
function (Rose n et al ., 1997; Cappelleri et al ., 2000) : 
1. Erectile function 
2. Orgasmic function 
3. Sexual desire 
4. Intercourse satisfaction  
5. Overall satisfaction.  
Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System(®) Sexual Function and 
Satisfaction (PROMIS(®) SexFS)  
The PROMIS SexFS PRO measure is an up to 19 item self-administered questionnaire 
compiled from relevant items in the PROMIS Sexual Function and Satisfaction domains 
(Flynn et al., 2013). The mea sure assesses global satisfaction with sex life (up to 7 items), 
erectile function (up to 6 items), interest in sexual activity (up to 4 items), and interfering 
factors (up to 2 items) in the last 30 days.   
PROMIS(®) Fatigue Short Form  
The PROMIS Fatigue  Short Form measure is an 7 -item self -administered questionnaire 
assessing the extent of fatigue and its impact on work and functioning in the last 7 days.  
Brief Fatigue Inventory  
The BFI is a 99- item self -administered questionnaire, providing an assessment of the severity 
of fatigue and its impact on the subject ’s ability to function at present and in the previous 
24 hours  (Mendoza et al ., 1999) . 
36-Item Short Form Health Survey  
The SF -36 Q oL questionnaire is a multidimensional instrument that evaluates quality of life. 
It consists of questions assigned to the following categories  (McHorney et al., 1994):  
1. Vitality  
2. Physical functioning  
3. Bodily pain 
4. General health perceptions  
5. Physical role functioning

Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 58 of 87 
 6. Emotional role functioning 
7. Social role functioning 
8. Mental health.  
Patient Global Impression of Status items (PGI -S) 
Three patient global impression items will be included to assess the patients’ overall 
impression of their current health status  and thus to evaluate the performance of the other 
PROs in this patient population.  
1) Overall, how much does your hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism affect your physical 
function ? Typical effects include low energy levels and difficulties in performing 
physical activities.  
a.            Not at all  
b.            A little bit  
c.            Somewhat  
d.            Quite a bit 
e.            Very much  
 2) Overall, how much does your hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism affect your mental 
function ? Typical effects include feeling s of tiredness and problems with sleep, mood 
and thoughts.  
a.            Not at all  
b.            A little bit  
c.            Somewhat

11.3.5 Actigraphy Derived Activity and Sleep Parameters  
The Autograph Link is a portable device that measures gross motor movements featuring a 
validated 3 -axis accelerometer and data filtering technology that captures and records 
continuous, high resolution physical activity and sleep/wake information. It is a large, water -
resistant wrist watch worn on the non- dominant hand. 
Subjects will wear the monitor for 7  days consecutively starting with the day of the scheduled 
Visit 1, and 5 and 7 days consecutively before V isits 8 and 11, so that the monitors can be 
collected at V isit 8 from subjects transferring  to the extension study and at V isit 11 from 
subject completing FU visit, as described in the schedule of assessments ( Table 9–1).

Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 59 of 87 
 Activity parameters  
Moderate and vigorous physical activity, sedentary bouts  and activity counts will be 
measured. Software algorithms will be used to differentiate the amount of time spent  at each 
of these activity levels. The cut -offs selected will be chosen to reflect the sedentary lifestyle 
of the subject s. 
Sleep parameters  
Time spent in sleep  will be measured  to enable assessment of sleep quality and duration.  
11.3.6 Grip  Strength M easurement  
Grip strength assessment using a hand held dynamometer will be used as a surrogate measure 
of muscle strength. During this assessment,  the subject  will squeeze the  device three times 
with each hand. An average of three measurements for each hand will be calculated and 
recorded.  
11.3.7 Semen A nalysis  
Subjects who are vasectomised or have vasectomy planned during the study period will be 
exempt from  the semen analysis.   
Semen Quality  
Semen samples will be collected after a minimum of 48 hours of sexual abstinence based on 
WHO laboratory manual for the examination and processing of human semen. Condoms will 
not be used for collection as they ma y contain spermicide affecting quality of the specimen.  
The analysis will be performed at the study sites  for the assessment  of semen volume, sperm 
count, concentrat ion, motility  and morphology . Samples may be repeated up to two times at a 
scheduled time  point due to individual variability in semen parameters.  
Semen PK  
Seminal fluid PK will also be performed at EOT to assess th e concentration  of BGS649 at 
steady state (see Section  11.4).  . 
11.4 Pharmacokinetic  Assessments 
Sparse Plasma Pharmacokinetic Sampling  
PK sampling for BGS649 will be performed at the following time points , as defined in the 
schedule of assessments ( Table 9–1):  
Visit 5 (Week  12). Pre-dose and 1h post -dose.  The investigator should ensure that the site 
visit when PK is taken coincides with the scheduled dosing visit.  
Visit 8 (EOT;Week  24) PK will be taken only once together with other laboratory 
assessments taken at that visit.  
It is important that the time that the last dose of study drug was taken prior to PK testing is 
recorded when PK is performed.

 12 ASSESSMENT OF  SAFETY  
The timing and frequency of safety assessments provided in Table 9–1.  
12.1 Adverse Events  
12.1.1 Definitions  
The definitions for AEs  and SAEs  are given below. It is of the utmost importance that all 
staff involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. The principal 
investigator  is responsible for ens uring this.  
Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subj ect, or clinical investigation 
subjec t administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended 
sign, symptom or disease temporally associat ed with the use of a medicinal (investigation) 
product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
Any relevant observations made at the Screening Visit  (prior to signing the ICF) are to be 
recorded as pre- existing conditions . AE will only be recorded if there is a worsening of the 
pre-existing condition during study conduct with regard to nature, severity or frequency  . 
Only SAEs will be collected during Screening Period (the time between signing the ICF and 
randomisation). From randomisation to Day 90 after last study drug administration all AEs 
will be reported . 
An adverse drug reaction is an “untoward and unintended response to an investigational medicinal product related to any dose administered”.  
All AEs judged by either th e reporting investigator  or the sponsor  as having a reasonable 
causal relationship to a medicinal product qualify as adverse drug reactions. The expression of “reasonable causal relationship” means to convey in general that there are facts or 
arguments whi ch suggest a causal relationship.  
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as, but is not limited to, one that:  
1. Results in death  
Death is not an AE in itself, but an outcome. The cause of the death is the AE which 
resulted in death.  
2. Is life -threatening  
Life-threatening means that the subject  was at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
SAE;  it does not refer to a n SAE that hypothetically might have caused death if it had 
been more severe.  
3. Requires in -subject  hospitalisation or prolongs existing hospital isation  
Mereo BioPharma 2 Ltd  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol MBGS205    
 
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 62 of 87 
 Hospitalisation is defined as at least one overnight formal admission into hospital, usually 
in order to perform additional tests, provide treatment which it is not possible to provide 
at home and/or due to an unstable medical condition which requi res specific monitoring 
of the subject . Pre -planned hospitalisations (known already prior to signing the ICF) will 
not be considered an SAE, unless any of the above criteria are fulfilled over the course of 
the hospitalisation due to unplanned complications. “Social” hospitalisation whereby it is 
administratively impossible to release the subject  home is not necessarily an SAE. 
Complications that occur during hospitalisations are AEs. If the complication delays subject  release from hospital then the AE beco mes an SAE.  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
The term significant disability refers to any condition that impairs physical/physiological well-being to the extent that the subject  is unable to function normally. Physical disability  
may include, but is not limited to, permanent disability of locomotion or motility, but also 
systemic permanent dysfunction including heart failure, liver insufficiency or pulmonary 
fibrosis.  
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
6. Is an important medical event  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening or require 
hospitalisation may be considered as an SAE when, based on appropriate medical 
judgement, they may jeopardise the subject  or the subject  may require medical or surg ical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Treatment Emergent Adverse Event  
Treatment  emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as any AE occurring or worsening on or after 
the first dose of study medication. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Refer to Section  12.1.7.  
12.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
For the purposes of this study , only SAEs will be collected during Screening P eriod (the time 
between signing the ICF and randomisation).  
Any detrimental change in  the subject 's condition, after randomisation and up to 90 days after 
the last administration of study drug  should be considered an AE.  
The following variables will be re corded for each AE:  verbatim/AE description  and date  for 
AE start and stop, severity , seriousness, causality rating, whether or not the AE caused the 
subject  to discontinue, and the outcome. If the severity of the AE changes, a new AE must be 
recorded.  
SAE s and AEs will be recorded after randomisation. SAEs only will be reported during the 
screening period (from signing of the informed consent  to randomisation) . All AEs/ SAEs 
Mereo BioPharma 2 Ltd  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol MBGS205    
 
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 63 of 87 
 have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational product 
or to the study procedure(s).  
All ongoing AEs/SAEs should be followed up until resolution or stabilisation or the last visit if in the investigator 's opinion, the AE is unlikely to resolve due to the subject 's underlying 
disease.  
At any time after the FU  visit, if an investigator  learns of an SAE that can be reasonably 
related to study drug, he/she should promptly notify the sponsor . 
Intensity  
The investigator  will assess the intensity of AEs based on the following definitions:  
1. Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)  
2. Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
3. Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities) . 
It is important to distinguish b etween serious and seve re AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section  12.1.8.  
An AE of severe intensity need not nec essarily be considered serious. For example, nausea 
that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild 
stroke but would be an SAE.  
For an AE to be  a suspected drug -related event  there should be at least a reasonable 
possibility of a causal relationship between the study drug and the AE.  
12.1.3 Causal Assessment  
The following “binary” decision choice will be used by the investigator  to describe the 
causality assessment:  
o Reasonable possibility of relatedness  
o No reasonable possibility of relatedness  
The term “reasonable possibility of relatedness” is meant to convey, in general, that there is enough evidence or argument to suggest a ca usal relationship. The investigator  should 
consider the following, before reaching a decision on causality assessment:  
o Time relationship between study drug intake and event’s onset  
o Dechallenge  
o Rechallenge  
o Medical history  
o Study treatment  
o Mechanism of action  of study drug 
o Class effect  
Mereo BioPharma 2 Ltd  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol MBGS205    
 
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 64 of 87 
 o Concomitant treatments in use  
o Withdrawal of study treatment 
o Lack of efficacy/worsening of existing condition 
o Erroneous treatment with study medication or concomitant medication  
o Protocol -related process . 
Action taken with study drug due to the AE:  
o None  
o Drug permanently discontinued 
o Drug temporarily discontinued 
o Unknown/not applicable . 
Other action taken:  
o Specific therapy/medication  
o Surgical medical procedure  
o (Prolonged) hospitalisation. 
Each single AE m ust be rated by choosing one  of the following:  
o Recovered/resolved  
o Recovering/resolving  
o Not recovered/not resolved 
o Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae  
o Fatal  
o Unknown. 
12.1.4 Abnormal Laboratory Values/Vital Signs /Electrocardiograms  
Laboratory/vital signs/ECG abnormalities should be  reported as AE /SAE s if any one of the 
following criteria is met: 
1. The r esult is clinically significant or associated with signs/symptoms  
2. Requires additional diagnostic testing and/or interventions  
3. Leads to a change in dose, discontinuation or interruption of the study drug . 
Results of an abnormal test results without any of the above criteria do not constitute an AE. 
Any test result determined to be an error is not required to be reported as an AE. 
12.1.5 Overdose  
A drug overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional use of a drug or medicine or an 
administration error in drug administration in an amount that is higher than is normally used. 
Mereo BioPharma 2 Ltd  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol MBGS205    
 
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 65 of 87 
 Every overdose must be reported to ICON Pharmacovigilance and Safety Services  within 24 
hours of awareness, irrespective of whether the overdose was associated with an AE/SAE.  
12.1.6 Partner Pregnancies  
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of the subject s who took study 
treatment in this study.  Pregnancy it self is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion 
that the study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medi cation. 
If a pregnancy is reported for a subject ’s partner , study drug will be immediately 
discontinued. The outcome of all pregnancies  (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, 
normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented. Follow up 
should be performed up to delivery and examination of the new -born, after which a follow -up 
report s hould be sent with any new information regarding the pregnancy and the outcome of 
the birth. After study drug discontinuation, the subject  should continue with all study 
schedule assessments, except study drug administration. The male study subject has to 
continue to wear a condom for at least 3 months after the last medication intake. Unprotected 
intercourse with his pregnant partner presents a risk of toxicity to the unborn child. 
All congenital abnormalities/birth defects  should be classified as SAEs. Sp ontaneous 
miscarriages should also be  reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without 
complications should not be handled as SAEs, but should be reported as AEs.  Pregnancies must be reported to ICON Pharmacovigilance and Safety Services  using the  
reporting details and timelines provided in Section  12.1.8 within 24 hours of awareness.  
12.1.7 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Some AEs, despite their severity or outcome, will be expedited due to the relevance for 
subject  safety or study drug safety profile. These AESI s should be reported as expedited 
within 24 hours of awareness  to ICON Pharmacovigilance and Safety Services : 
1. Cardiovascular event  (acute myocardial infarction, brain stroke, t ransient ischemic attack, 
unstab le angina, c ongestive heart failure )  
2. Prostate cancer  
3. Lower extremity oedema  ≥ Grade 3  (which is not due to local pressure /venostasis effects 
such as may be caused by socks or other clothing) . 
4. Polycyt hemia as measured by a haematocrit > 54%  
5. Fragility frac ture 
6. Development of sleep apnoea  
7. Development of osteoporosis or low mineral density as per D EXA measurement  (T score 
≤ -2.5 for men ≥  50 years or Z score ≤  -2 for men <  50 years of age)  
8. Breast cancer .

 12.1.8  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  and Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Investigators and other site personnel must inform ICON Pharmacovigilance and Safety 
Services  of any SAE/AESI that occurs  during the course of the study whether or not 
considered causally related to the investigation al product or to the study procedure(s): SAE: 
from the time of informed consent until the 90 days after last study drug dose,  AESI  from the 
time of randomisation until 90 days after last study drug dose and within 24 hours of when he 
or she becomes aware o f it. 
Follow- up information on SAEs/AESIs must also be reported by the investigator within the 
same time frames.  
If a non -serious AE becomes serious, this and other relevant follow -up information must also 
be provided to ICON within 24 hours as described a bove. 
All SAEs/AESIs will also be recorded in the eCRF. The investigator is responsible for 
informing the Ethics Committee of the SAE/AESI as per local requirements.  
Paper SAE/AESI forms should be completed at the site and faxed /emailed  to the relevant 
ICON Pharmacovigilance and Safety Services  or e-mailed to the global email distribution list 
within 24 hrs of awareness of the event. 
SAE/AESI reports should be sent to: 
There may be situations when an SAE/AESI has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial SAE/AESI report.  However, it is very important that the 
investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event prior to transmission of 
the SAE/AESI report form. Minimum criteria are identifiable subject (number), a suspect 
product (i.e. study drug or concom itant medication), an identifiable reporting source 
(investigator/study site identification), and an event or outcome that can be identified as 
serious or as an AESI. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in the light of 
follow- up information, amending the SAE/AESI report form accordingly. The causality 
assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements for 
SAEs.  
12.2 Safety Endpoints  
1. TEAEs/SAEs (from first dose of study drug until 90 days after last treatment dose)  
2. Change in PSA during 24 week treatment duration  
3. Change in haematocrit during 24 week treatment duration 

Mereo BioPharma 2 Ltd  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol MBGS205    
 
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 67 of 87 
 4. Change in Bone Mineral Density (DEXA scan T -score and density in g/cm2) from 
Screening and bone turnover biomarkers at 24- weeks from Baseline 
5. Change in vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters, ECG  
6. Change in physical examination (including general, prostate, breast and oedema of the 
lower extremities).  
12.3 Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory measurements for blood chemistry, PSA, haematology, urinalysis and specialised 
chemistry will be performed according to the schedule of assessments ( Table 9–1).  Specific 
details not mentioned in  this section  (including shipping requirements)  are included in the 
laboratory manual.   
All blood samples are to be collected after 8 hours fasting, after ECG and vital sign 
measurements . 
12.3.1 Clinical L aboratory T ests 
Blood Chemistry  
Sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate/CO 2, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, fasting 
glucose, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, PT/INR, total bilirubin, total protein , 
calcium , lipid panel (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides)  and PSA will be measured.  
eGFR  will be calcu lated based on Cockcroft -Gault formula:  
eGFR = ((140 -  Age) / (SerumCreat)) * (Weight / 72) 
Haemato logy 
Haemoglobin, white blood cell (WBC)  count with differentials (monocytes, eosinophils, 
basophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes) as an absolute value, red blood cell (RBC)  count and 
platelet count  will be measured . 
Urinalysis  
Specific gravity, pH, semi -quantitative “dipstick” evaluation of glucose, protein, bilir ubin, 
ketones, leukocytes and blood will be measured.  
A microscopic examination including RBC and WBC will be performed only when  dipstick 
evaluation is positive for WBC and/or blood or protein. A midstream urine sample (about 
30 mL) will be obtained, in order to avoid contamination with epithelial cells and sediments, and allow proper assessments. 
12.3.2 Specialised Chemistry  
The following laboratory parameters will be measured at S creening only, for assessment of 
exclusion criteria (see Section  9.3.2) : 
1. Morning cortisol  
2. TSH   
3. FT4 
Mereo BioPharma 2 Ltd  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol MBGS205    
 
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 68 of 87 
 4. Prolactin  
5. 25-hydroxy vitamin D  (no exclusion criteria related to this parameter)  
6. Fasting transferrin saturation reported in % and calculated according to the formula:  
o Transferrin saturation = [Iron / (Transferrin × 1.4)] × 100 
12.3.3 Bone Turnover Markers  
CTx1 , osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase and P1NP will be measured . 
12.4 DEXA Scan  
Bone density will be evaluated with standard procedure. An overview is provided here. The 
study imaging manual contains more detailed guidance which should be followed. All 
evaluations during the study for particular subject  will be performed on the same machine , 
wherever possible by the same technician . It is important that the same subject positioning is 
followed for each scan.  Primary scan results need to be stored for central overread when  
required.  
To assess the spine, the subject will be in supine position with legs supported on a padded 
box to flatten the  pelvis and lower ( lumbar ) spine. To assess the hip, the foot is placed in a 
brace that rotates the hip inward. Both femoral neck and total hip results will be reported.. 
The det ector will be slowly passed over the area separately for spine and hip, generating 
images. The duration of examination will be up to 30 minutes . DEXA T -Score will be 
calculated based on actual measured bone density value. Both density and T -score values wi ll 
be evaluated for safety.  
12.5 Physical Examination  
The following examinations will be performed:  
1. Full evaluation and physical examination (general appearance, skin  and body hair , neck 
[including thyroid]), eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, tes ticular 
examination, lymph nodes, lower extremities examination for oedema and basic nervous 
system evaluation)  
2. Digital prostate examination  
3. Limited physical examination (cardiovascular system and lower extremities oedema) at all visits where a full physic al examination is not scheduled. For lower extremities 
examination, subject will be sitting with their lower extremities in the dependent position. Lower extremities will be inspected and palpated to look for pitting oedema . 
The lower extremities examination findings will be graded as per standard medical practice 
on a 5- point scale : 0 -  no oedema, +1-  barely detectable 2mm depression. Immediate 
rebound, +2-  a 4mm deep oedema, few seconds to rebound, +3 -  6mm deep oedema. 10-12 
seconds to rebound to + 4-  8mm deep oedema, >20 seconds to rebound  and recorded in the 
eCRF.  Use of bony prominence such as the malleoli may reduce the artefactual pitting 
oedema that may occur above sites of constriction such as tight socks.

Protocol MBGS205    
 
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 69 of 87 
 Informa tion about the physical examination must be present in the source documentation at 
the study site. Significant findings that are present prior to the start of the study drug 
treatment must be included in the relevant medical history/current medical conditions section 
of the CRF. Significant findings made after the start of study drug treatment, which meet the definition of an AE must be recorded in the AE CRF summary page.  
12.6 Vital Signs  
Vital signs include measurement of oral  temperature, SBP, DBP ,  pulse and weight. Height 
will also be measured at S creening only, to enable BMI determination ( Section  11.3.2).  
Details on body weight measurement are provid ed in Section  11.3.2. Body weight taken at 
Baseline will be utilised for all PK calculations.  
Blood pressure (SBP and DBP, see Section  11.3.2) and pulse rate will be assessed after the 
subject has rested quietly in the supine position for at least 5 minutes. Three consecutive recordings will be  taken and the average value will be noted in the eCRF. Blood pressure will 
be assessed using the same arm each time.  
12.7 12-Lead ECG  
The subject  number and initials or date of birth, the date and actual time of the tracing, and 
the study code must appear on each page of the tracing. The ECGs should be performed at 
approximately the same time of day at each of the ECG assessments, after subject has  been in 
supine position for 10 min. Tracings will be dated and signed by the person who interprets 
the ECG.  
The CRFs will contain: 
1. Date and time of the ECG  
2. Heart rate  
3. PR interval  
4. QT interval ( QT CF) 
5. QRS duration. 
6. RR interval  
The overall interpretation will be collected with a yes/no statement to confirm if any 
clinically significant abnormalities are present, which need to be detailed further and reported 
as AE/SAE if appropriate. Original ECG tracings, appropriately signed, will be archived at 
the study si te. 
12.8 Androgen Deficiency Guidance  
All subject s will be assessed by an investigator at S creening for symptoms of androgen 
deficiency based on an androgen deficiency guidance document that will list all androgen 
deficiency symptoms (see Appendix  II). All positive symptoms will be entered into the 
eCRF.

 13 STATISTICAL EVALUATI ON 
13.1 Sample Size and Power  
Statistical Hypothesis:  
ICON Biostatistics will prepare the randomisation list, based on a randomisation scheme 
blocked by site. Until the outcome of the interim analysis is known, each  subject  will be 
assigned to one of four dosing regimens defined in Section 9.1 in a 1:1:1 :1 ratio.  This will be 
adjusted as per Section  9.1 depending on the outcome of the interim analysis. 
See Section  10.2.4  for further d etails of the Randomisation procedures to be applied. 
13.3 Analysis Sets 
All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analysed using the intention to treat 
(ITT) population. The per -protocol (PP) population will be used only for the analysis of the 
prim ary endpoint to examine the robustness of the primary analyses. 
Safety and tolerability will be analysed using the safety population. 
Pharmacokinetic data will be analysed using the PK population. 
13.3.1  Intention to Treat (ITT) (Full Analysis Set)  
The ITT popula tion includes all subject s who: 
1. Are randomised, and 
2. Receive at least one dose of study medication, and 
3. Provide a Baseline  and at least one post- Baseline  testosterone value.

13.4 Endpoints  
13.4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the normalisation of total testosterone levels in ≥ 75% of 
subjects at Week 24.  
13.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
Efficacy will be further assessed based on the secondary endpoints, as defined in Section  11.2. 
Further details and th e time points for collection are given in Section 11.3 and in the 
Schedule of assessments ( Table 9–1). A complete list of efficacy endpoints is given in 
Section  11.2. 
These secondary efficacy parameters will be assessed using the ITT population.

 These safety parameters will be assessed using the safety population. A list of safety  
endpoints is given in Section  12.2. 
13.5 Description of Statistical Analyses  
13.5.1 General Considerations  
The statistical evaluation will be performed by ICON using SAS®, Version 9.3 or later. Data 
will be analysed by either enumeration of subject s displaying distinctive characteristics 
within each treatment regimen or by descriptive statistical summaries such as means, 
standard deviations (SD), medians, and ranges for continuous measures. Categorical variables 
will be presented by the number of observations and absolute and relative (%) frequency.  
For efficacy data summary statistics (N, mean, SD, median minimum and maximum for 
continuous data, and N [%] for categorical data) will be presented at each visit.  
Similarly, changes from Baseli ne (or percentage change from Baseline if appropriate) will be 
summarised in a similar manner.  
The main population for efficacy analysis will be the ITT population.  
Unless stated otherwise the Baseline  value for a variable will be latest value take prior to first 
dose of study medication. 
Data in summary tables will generally be presented on an Observed Cases basis.  
Unless stated otherwise, all statistical tests will be two -sided and conducted at the 5% level, 
and all quoted CIs  will be two -sided 95% CI s. All four treatment regimens will be assessed 
by pairwise comparisons, no adjustment for multiplicity will be made and all analyses will be 
considered as exploratory analyses.  
Full details of the statistical analysis will be given in a SAP.  
13.5.2 Analysis of Prima ry Endpoint  
The Primary Endpoint will be considered to have been met for a dose if ≥  75% of subjects in 
the ITT population have normalisation of total testosterone levels at Week  24 
The proportion of subjects with normal testosterone levels  will be summarised by treatment 
regimen and visit.  
The primary analysis of efficacy will be performed with the ITT population. Additionally for 
exploring the robustness of the intent -to-treat results, a supportive analysis using the PP 
population will be carried out. 
As per section 13.7  the primary analysis will be conducted once all data up to Visit 8 has 
been collected.  
13.5.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed on the ITT population. For the secondary efficacy endpoints data will be summarised by treatment regimen and visit.

Protocol MBGS205    
 
Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 74 of 87 
 For each continuous parameter, change from Baseline  will be assessed with a mixed model 
repeated measure ( MMRM)  analysis, with treatment regimen as a fact or and the Baseline  
value as a covariate. The adjusted mean difference between treatments will be presented 
along with a 95% CI  for the time -points of interest. 
For binary outcomes the proportion of subject s with a response will be summarised and 
compared between treatment regimens using Fisher’s Exact Test.  
A more detailed description will be presented in the SAP . 
13.5.4 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints  
The analysis of exploratory endpoints will be performed on the ITT population. 
Data will be summarised by treatment regimen and visit.  
For each continuous parameter, change from Baseline will be assessed with a MMRM 
analysis, with treatment regimen as a factor and the Baseline value as a covariate. The 
adjusted mean difference between treatments will be presen ted along with a 95% CI  for the 
time-points of interest. 
For binary outcomes the proportion of subject s with a response will be summarised and 
compared between treatment regimens using Fisher’s Exact Test.  
A more detailed description will be presented in t he SAP . 
13.5.5 Safety Analyses  
The analysis of safety parameters will be based on the safety population. In general, missing 
safety data will not be replaced. A more detailed description will be presented in the SAP . 
Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using the mos t recent version available of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Summaries will be by system organ class and preferred term. TEAEs are defined as any AE occurring or worsening on or after the first dose of study 
medication. If a subject  experiences the same preferred term multiple times then the event 
will be counted only once and by the greatest severity.  
The frequency and incidence of TEAEs will be presented by system organ class and preferred term for each treatment regimen (numbe r and percentage of subject s experiencing at least one 
AE per preferred term as well as the number of observed events per preferred term). Separate 
tables will be presented by severity and by relationship. All AEs will be presented in full in a 
comprehensi ve listing including subject  number, treatment regimen, severity, seriousness, 
action taken, outcome, relationship to treatment, onset/stop and duration. Details of SAEs and 
AEs leading to withdrawal will be listed separately.  
Concomitant Medication 
Concom itant medication will be tabulated and summarised by treatment regimen.  
Physical Examination 
Physical examination results will be listed by subject  and body system.

 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be summarised as actual values and change from Baseline by tre atment 
regimen and visit.  
ECG  
The overall ECG interpretation will be summarised by presentin g the number and percentage 
of subject s with “Normal” “Abnormal, not clinically significant‟ and “Abnormal, clinically 
significant”.  
ECG parameter values (e.g. , QT CF) will be summarised as actual values and change from 
Baseline by treatment regimen and visit to end of treatment . 
Clinical Laboratory  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for quantitative laboratory parameters for each 
treatment regimen and time -point. Similarly, changes from Baseline will be summarised.  
Values outside the normal range will be categorised as H (above the normal range) or L 
(below the normal range) based on the laboratory’s reference range and these will be flagged  
in the listings of individual subject  data.  
DEXA Scan  
DEXA scan T-Score and density in g/cm2 will be summarised as actual values and change 
from Screening at Week 24 and by treatment regimen.  
Withdrawals  
Subject s who withdraw from the study will be summarised by treatment regimen according to 
their reason for withdrawal. 
13.5.6 Analysis of Further Endpoints  
Demographic data and subject s’ characteristics at S creening  will be listed and summarised 
using descriptive statistics. Formal statistical analysis will not be performed on Baseline  
demographic data.  
Medical history will be coded using MedDRA. An incidence table by body system and 
preferred term will be presented by treatment regimen.  
Compliance with study medication will be summarised descriptively by treatment regimen.  
13.6 Interim  Analysis  
An interim analysis will be conducted once approximately 100 of overall planned subjects 
have completed the Week  4 visit. The analysis will be performed by an independent DMC 
who will review un- blinded data to identify : 
1. Any safety signals across the dose groups which would preclude further continuation of 
dosing

Amended Protocol  Version  6.0, 10 March  2017   Page 76 of 87 
 2. Whether an individual arm has met the criteria of ≥  75% of subjects reaching the 
normalisation of testosterone (testosterone within  or above  normal reference range for 
healthy adu lt males according to the FDA)  
3. Whether in the opinion of the DMC following unblinded review  that when the arm is 
fully recruited it is expected to  achieve a ≥  75% response at W eek 24.   
Dosing arms which meet either criterion 2 or 3 will be deemed effective. For arms that are 
determined to be ineffective  or unsafe , dosing will be stopped and no further randomisation 
to that arm will be performed.  
Subjects assigned to the ineffective or unsafe arm(s) will be discontinued from the treatment, 
will attend an EOT visi t and will be followed- up for an additional 12 weeks (FU, Visit 11). 
Whil e the interim analysis is being performed, dosing and recruitment of study subjects will 
continue. 
13.7 Interim Clinical Study Report  
The primary  efficacy analysis and study unblinding wil l be performed when all data up to 
Visit 8 (W eek 24) has  been collected.  Given the study has  been powered at Week 24  and 
there will not be multiple comparisons , there is no requirement to adjust the Type I error rate .   
An interim Clinical Study report (CS R) will be prepared based upon the results of this 
analysis.  
The saf ety data collected during the off treatment 12 week follow -up will be separately 
analysed and published in the full CSR.  
13.8 Population Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Modelling  
Nonlinear mixe d effects modelling will be utilised to develop a population PK model for 
plasma BGS649 concentrations and to develop a PK/PD model linking BGS649 
concentrations to changes in testosterone levels.  
A separate Modelling and Simulation Analysis Plan (MSAP) will be prepared and results from the PK and PK/PD modelling will be reported separately from the clinical study report (CSR) .

 17 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
17.1 Case Report Forms/Source Data Handling  
All required study data must be entered in the eCRF created for the study.  This data 
collection tool is a validated electronic data capture (EDC) system that contains a system 
generated audit trail.  Data required according to this protocol are recorded by investigational 
site personnel via data entry into the internet based EDC sof tware system.  The investigator  
shall ensure that all data from subject  visits are promptly entered into the eCRFs in 
accordance with the speci fic instructions given. The investigator  must sign each eCRF to 
verify the integrity of the data recorded.  All internal ICON and external investigational site 
personnel seeking access to the eCRF are to do so according to the FDA guidance for industry on electronic source data in clinical investigations . At the end of the study all data 
captured electronically will be  provided to the investigator  on CD -ROM for archiving at the 
investigational site.  
A list of the normal ranges for all laboratory tests to be undertaken forms part of the 
documentation to be collated prior to study start. If a central laboratory has been selected to 
conduct any or all tests, it is essential that all samples be analysed at that laboratory.  
The investigator  must maintain source documents, such as laboratory reports, X -rays, ECGs, 
consultation reports, and complete medical history and physica l examination reports.  All 
information in the eCRF must be traceable to the source documents in the subject ’s file.  
Data to be recorded directly on the CRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of data) 
and considered to be source data must be identified in the protocol. 
17.2 Retention of Essential Documents  
The investigator /institution should maintain the study documents as specified in the ICH 
guidelines on GCP and as required by the applicable regulatory requirements. The 
investigator /institution should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents.  
Essential documents should be retained until at least 2  years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or cont emplated 
marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents 
should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by  the applicable regulatory 
requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor . It is the responsibility of the sponsor  to 
inform the investigator /institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.

 18 FINANCING AND INSURANCE  
The sponsor  shall carry an insurance policy to cover compensation of subject s’ health injuries 
arising from the study.  If a subject  incurs a study -related injury, the subject  may be treated 
(and other necessary measures taken) at the study site and/or another medical instit ution. If it 
is necessary to compensate for the treatment, the sponsor  will cover the cost.  The sponsor  
shall not impose on the subject  the burden of proving the causal relation between the study 
and the injury.  
If any of the following is confirmed, the sp onsor  may refuse or restrict the payment of the 
compensation:  
1. A serious GCP or protocol deviation by the investigator  or sub- investigator  (except 
deviation medically necessary to avoid an immediate hazard to the study subject s) 
2. Intentional act or negligenc e on the part of the investigator  or sub- investigator  or 
malpractice thereby  
3. Injury caused by unlawful act or delinquency of a third party  
4. Injury caused by intentional act or negligence of the subject . 
If compensation becomes necessary for a study -related injury, the site will promptly notify 
the sponsor  and will co -operate with the sponsor  and its insurer (or their legal representatives) 
in their handling thereof.  
19 PUBLICATION POLICY 
The sponsor  shall retain the ownership of all data. When the study is complete the sponsor  
shall arrange the analysis and tabulation of data. A CSR shall then be prepared, which may be 
used for publication, presentation at scientific meetings or submission to regulat ory 
authorities. All proposed publications based on this study must be subject  to the sponsor 's 
approval requirements.

that involve working memory, inhibitory control, attention, math, and reading comprehension in the 
presence of standardized noise that simulates classroom noise. 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?
Approximately 30 people will take part in this study at Duke University Medical Center. We may need 
to screen up to 60 participants in order to get 30 eligible. Duke is the only site for this study.
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY?
If you agree to allow your child to be in this study, you will be asked to sign and date this consent form. 
You and your child will be asked to come to the clinic 4 times (screening, baseline and two experimental 
sessions) over a period of 2-5 weeks. 
Visit 1 -Screening: This visit will determine if your child is eligible to participate in the study. This visit 
will last for about 4 hours. The following will happen:
You and your child (if 12 years old and above) will sign and date this consent form
You will be asked about your child’s medical and medication history
You will be asked about your child’s developmental history
You will complete a diagnostic interview and assessment with one of our clinical psychologists 
in order to determine if your child meets the criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD or any other 
psychiatric condition.
Your child will complete a brief Intelligence Quotient (IQ) screening
If additional information is needed in order to determine your child's eligibility for the study, we 
may request additional materials from other sources (e.g., teacher forms or medical records). If 
this occurs, we will ask you to sign a release form for that information.
If your child qualifies to be in the study, you and your child will be asked to return to the clinic within 
21 days after the screening visit.
Visit 2-Baseline: During this visit, the following will be completed:
If your child is currently taking a stimulant medication for his/her ADHD, and he/she is eligible 
to be in the study, we will ask that your child not take his/her ADHD medication on the day of 
study visits 2, 3 and 4. Your child can resume taking his/her ADHD medication the same day 
after he/she completes the assessments for the study visit. 
You and your child will be asked if your child had any changes in his/her health since his/her last 
study visit.
You will be asked for any medications that your child has taken since the last study visit.
Your child will complete three computerized assessments about sustained attention, strategy, 
working memory and impulse control. This will take about 30 minutes to complete.

Your child will also complete math and reading comprehension activities.
If your child continues to meet eligibility criteria to be in the study, he/she will be assigned to 
complete assessments in the next two visits using either the noise cancelling headphone first and 
then the sham headphone or the sham headphone first and then the noise cancelling headphone.
Your child will be fitted for the proper earbud size for headphones and practice inserting the 
earbuds.  
This visit will last for about two hours.
Visits 3 and 4 – Experimental Sessions: Within 4 to 10 days since the last study visit, you and your child 
will be asked to come to the clinic to complete the following:
You and your child will be asked if your child had any changes in his/her health since his/her last 
study visit.
You will be asked for any medications that your child has taken since the last study visit.
Your child will be asked to use a noise cancelling headphone first (Visit 3) and then the sham 
headphone (Visit 4) or the reverse order while he/she completes the following:
1. Three computerized assessments about sustained attention, strategy, working memory 
and impulse control. 
2. Math and reading comprehension activities
Your child will be asked to describe his/her experience after the assessments.
The visits lasts approximately two hours each time
At Visit 4, which is your child’s last study visit, we will provide you with referrals for the 
continued care of your child’s ADHD.
HOW LONG WILL MY CHILD BE IN THIS STUDY?
Your child will be in the study for up to 5 weeks
You and your child can choose to stop participating at any time without penalty or loss of any benefits to 
which your child is entitled. However, if you and your child decide to stop participating in the study, we 
encourage you to talk to your child’s study doctor first.
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?
There are no physical risks associated with this study.  There is, however, the potential risk of loss of 
confidentiality.  Every effort will be made to keep your child’s information confidential; however, this 
cannot be guaranteed.  Some of the questions we will ask you and your child as part of this study may 
make you or your child feel uncomfortable.  You and your child may refuse to answer any of the 
questions and you and your child may take a break at any time during the visits.  You may stop your 
child’s participation in this study at any time.

Risks of Washout: During the washout period, your child’s symptoms of ADHD may get worse. 
Washout is when your child stops taking his/her ADHD medication on the day of the study visits (Visits 
2, 3, and 4). Please discuss the washout period with the study doctor.
ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?
If you agree to allow your child to take part in this study, there is no direct medical benefit to your child.  
We hope that in the future the information learned from this study will benefit other people with ADHD.
WHAT ALTERNATIVES ARE THERE TO PARTICIPATION IN THIS STUDY?
You and your child do not have to participate in this study to get treatment for his/her ADHD. You can 
get treatment or care for your child’s ADHD even if you are not in a research study. Your child could 
benefit from either FDA approved medication or behavior therapy, which have been proven to be 
helpful for treating ADHD.
Please talk to your child’s primary care physician about these options before you decide for your child to 
take part in this study.
WILL MY CHILD’S INFORMATION BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL?
Study records that identify your child will be kept confidential as required by law. Federal Privacy 
Regulations provide safeguards for privacy, security, and authorized access. Except when required by 
law or for your care, your child will not be identified by name, social security number, address, 
telephone number, or any other direct personal identifier in study records disclosed outside of Duke 
University Health System (DUHS). For records disclosed outside of DUHS (Bose Corporation, the 
study sponsor) your child will be assigned a unique code number. The key to the code will be kept 
securely at DUHS.
As part of the study, Dr. Kollins and his study team will report the results of your child’s study-related 
assessments to the study sponsor Bose. Records may include your child’s initials and/or your child’s 
date of birth.  In addition, your child’s records may be reviewed in order to meet federal or state 
regulations.  Reviewers may include representatives of Bose and the Duke University Health System 
Institutional Review Board. If any of these groups review your child’s research record, they may also 
need to review your child’s entire medical record.
All of the study assessments are being done only because your child is in this study.  The study results 
will not be given to you or be sent to your child’s physician to include in your child’s medical record.
The study results will be retained in your child’s research record until your child reaches the age of 21. 
At that time either the research information not already in your child's medical record will be destroyed 
or information identifying your child will be removed from such study results at DUHS.  Any research 
information in your child's medical record will be kept indefinitely.

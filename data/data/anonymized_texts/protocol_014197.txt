Methodology: 
This Phase 2 randomized, placebo -controlled Proof of Concept  (POC)  study will evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of KPL -301 coadministered  with a 26- week corticosteroid taper in patients with GCA. The study 
will consist of a Screening Period (up to 6  weeks), a 26- week Double-B lind placebo -controlled Period 
during which subjects will receive blinded KPL -301 or placebo coadministered with  a 26 -week 
corticosteroid taper , and a 12- week Washout Safety Follow -up Period during which subjects will 
discontinue and wash off blinded KPL -301 or placebo.  
Screening/Diagnostic Period:  
Following signing of the informed consent form (ICF), potential sub jects 50 -85 years of age (inclusive) 
will be screened for meeting study- specified diagnostic criteria for GCA.  
• Acute Phase Reactants  - Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR) > 30 mm/hour or 
C-reactive protein (CRP ) ≥ 1 mg/dL  
AND 
• Signs/Symptoms - A t least one of the following:  
i. Unequivocal cranial symptoms of GCA (new -onset localized headache, scalp , or temporal 
artery pain or tenderness, ischemia- related vision loss, or otherwise unexplained mouth or 
jaw pain upon mastication)

CONFIDENTIAL  ii. Unequivocal extra -cranial symptoms of GCA, such as claudication of the extremities  
iii. Symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica ( PMR ), defined as shoulder and/or hip girdle pain 
associated with inflammatory morning stiffness  
AND  
• Diagnostic C riteria - At least one o f the following:  
i. Temporal artery biopsy (TAB) or ultrasound revealing features of GCA  
ii. Evidence of large -vessel vasculitis by angiography or cross -sectional imaging study such 
as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography ( CT)/computed 
tomography angiography ( CTA ) or positron emission tomography ( PET)- CT of the aorta 
or other great vessels  
Upon successful completion of the screening procedures, diagnosis criteria will be entered into an IWRS , 
and eligible subjects will be stratified for randomized study treatment into two cohorts according to 
whether subjects have new -onset disease or relapsing/refractory (hereafter, “relapsing” for brevity) 
disease. 
• New-onset  - The new -onset disease cohort includes subjects who have been diagnosed within  
6 weeks of Day 0  using the above Acute Phase Reactant s, Signs/Symptoms and Diagnostic 
Criteria . 
• Relapsing/refractory  – (either or)  
o The relapsing disease  cohort includes subjects having prior documented diagnos is of GCA  as 
per Diagnostic C riteria above > 6 weeks before Day 0  and who have active GCA disease 
defined  by Acute Phase Reactant s and Signs/Symptoms  within 6 weeks of Day 0 .  
o The refractory nonremitting  disease subject has  had no remission since the diagnosis of 
disease as per clinical expectations . Thus, the subject has documentation of prior diagnosis of 
GCA as per Diagnostic criteria above > 6 weeks before Day 0 ; however, presence of Acute 
Phase Reactant s and Signs/Symptoms as per above persist s within 6 weeks of Day 0 . 
Subjects who complete screening procedures and are not considered eligible ( screen failures ) may be 
rescreened one time provided there is reason to believe that eligibility criteria will be met.  
Base Treatment Period:  
Stratified eligible subjects will enter the double -blind treatment period after randomization 3:2 to blinded 
treatment with KPL -301 150 mg or placebo adminis tered subcutaneously (SC) every other week (every 
2 weeks) . All subjects will also receive an unblinded 26- week oral prednisone taper according to a 
standardized tapering protocol.  
Prior to first administration of KPL -301 or placebo , all subjects are requ ired to have achieved remission  
(i.e., resolution of GCA symptom(s) and CRP < 1.0 mg/dL or ESR  < 20 mm in the first hour). Should a 
subject in screening not achieve remission within the initial screening period they can be rescreened using 
their prior flare documentation following the relapsing/refractory non- remitting inclusion criteria.  
The first administration of SC KPL -301/placebo and oral prednisone taper will take place at the study site 
on Day 0. Subsequent doses of KPL -301/placebo will be administered at the study site in conjunction with 
a scheduled study visit or administered by the subject  on an outpatient basis in accordance with  the dosing 
schedule . The oral steroid taper will be self -administered by study subjects on a daily basis.  
Subjects will be followed at the study site at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and approximately every 4 weeks thereafter 
(see Table 1). Subjects reporting worsening of GCA symptoms or any safety issues may be  brought in for 
an unscheduled visit at the study site at any time .

CONFIDENTIAL  If a flare/relapse is suspected  during the treatment period , the I nvestigator must consult the Contract 
Research Organization ( CRO )-designated Medical Expert to review and harmonize the elements of the 
diagnostic work-up. Flare/relapse is defined as a re -increase of CRP from normal to 1  mg/dL or greater 
and/or of ESR from less than 20 mm in the first hour to 30  mm or greater AND at least one of the 
following signs or symptoms attributed by the Investigator to new, worsening, or recurrent GCA : 
• Cranial symptoms  
o New or recurrent headache or pain or tenderness of the scalp or the temporal artery  
o Visual signs/symptoms such as ischemic retinopathy, optic neuropathy, diplopia, amauros is 
fugax, etc.  
o New or recurrent claudication of the tongue, masseter muscle, or worsening temporal artery 
signs and symptoms   
o Transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke related to GCA in the opinion of the Investigator  
• Extracranial symptoms 
o Classic PMR -like symptoms, defined as shoulder and/or hip girdle pain associated with 
inflammatory morning stiffness  
o New or recurrent claudication in the peripheral circulation (i.e., in one of the extremities)  
• New or worsening angiographic abnormalities detected via MRI, CT /CTA, or PET- CT of the 
aorta or other great vessels or via ultrasound of the temporal arteries   
Supportive findings could include other symptoms in the opinion of the I nvestigator related to w orsening 
GCA, such as sustained daily recurrent fever with a temperature over 38°C for more than 1week, chronic 
anemia, or unexplained weight loss.  
Although either acute phase reactant (CRP or ESR) may be used during the study for eligibility and to 
determ ine remission or flares, it is advisable that the same acute phase reactant used to determine 
remission at screening also be used to determine flares during the treatment period. 
All elements of the diagnostic work -up pertinent to the Investigator diagnosi s of a flare/relapse (i.e., the 
primary efficacy  endpoint) should be reviewed with the CRO -designated Medical Expert and entered into 
the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF ) promptly .  
Flare/relapse is defined as major  if cranial symptoms or ischemia -related visual loss are present or if there 
is clear evidence of new onset large vessel vasculitis (e.g. , subclavian artery) . In all other situations , 
flare/relapse attributed to PMR, vascular or other symptoms should be re garded as minor .  
Subjects who experience a flare  or subjects who cannot adhere to the protocol -defined steroid taper due to 
a flare should be managed to ensure the best possible care of the subject : 
• The subject must dis continue the assigned study drug  (KPL-301 or placebo) and should receive 
escape therapy in accordance with local SoC , as determined by the Investigator, which may 
include, for example, dose modifications of corticosteroids, other immunomodula tory agents, 
and/or approved therapies (e.g., toci lizumab) . The dosages of all concomitant medications used to 
treat the GCA flare must be entered into the eCRF . 
• Escape corticosteroid therapy can be escalated immediately.  Due to possible safety and 
pharmacologic effects resulting from overlapping exposures to immunomodulatory agents on top 
of co -administered corticosteroids, the investigator should consider a washout period of at least 35

CONFIDENTIAL  days (based on elimination half -lives) after the last dose of study drug if deemed clinically 
appropriate. 
Any subject  who prematurely discontinues the study drug treatment for safety or other reason will have an 
End-of-T reatment (EOT) visit and will be followed for the intended duration of study treatment (i.e., 
through W eek 26 and Washout Safety Follow -up) to address potential issues of informative censoring. 
Any subject who withdraws consent from the trial (i.e., all study procedures in addition to study drug  
administration ) must complete at a minimum the F inal Washout  Safety Follow -up visit 8 4 ± 3 days from 
the last dose administered.   Additional follow up using public records may be captured where possible. 
Washout Safety Follow -up: 
After subjects complete the 26 -week double blind treatment period, they will discontinue and wash off of 
blinded KPL -301 or placebo during a 12- week Washout Period, which includes close safety follow -up and 
monitoring for potential GCA flares.  During this time, it is recommended that subjects, regardless of 
remission status, receive SoC oral prednisone therapy, taking into conside ration that they have just 
completed treatment with what may have been an efficacious therapy which supported the tapering off  of 
standard of care concomitant oral corticosteroids.  Clinicians may choose to observe subjects closely 
during the washout perio d without any change in concomitant medications or may choose (consistent with 
current SoC guidelines) to increase the daily corticosteroid dose prophylactically/empirically by 
approximately 10 mg above the prednisone dose administered at Week 26.  The prednisone dose can then 
be tapered , increased  or maintained throughout the remainder of the 12- week Washout Period as per 
Investigator discretion.  After the F inal Washout Safety Follow -up visit (Week 38) has been completed, 
the subjects will exit the trial and should be transitioned to SoC per investigator judgement.  It is not 
required that the steroid taper have been completed (0 mg) prior to subjects exiting the trial at Week 38.  
Number of Subjects:  
Approximately 70 subjects will be randomized at a 3:2 allocation ratio.   Approximately 42 subjects  will be  
assigned to KPL -301, and approximately 28 subjects will be assigned to placebo. Of the study population, 
the aim is to have 50% with new -onset disease and 50% with relapsing disease.

Test Products, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
Subjects will be permitted to have received steroids (prednisone or equivalent) prior to inclusion in the 
study.  
During the double -blind period, subjects will receive blinded KPL -301 150 mg or placebo, every 2 weeks, 
by SC inject ion, in addition to a protocol -specified oral  corticosteroid taper. 
Oral prednisone will be started at a dose between  20 mg/day to 60 mg/day (inclusive) at Day 0 depending 
on the subject’s previous cortico steroid treatment, disease status, and I nvestigator discretion. The 
prednisone dose will then be tapered over the subsequent 26 weeks in accordance with the following 
tapering  schedule shown in Table 3, with subjects entering the taper at different points, depending on their 
prednisone dose at Day 0.  
After subjects have completed the 26 -week double -blind treatment period, they will discontinue and wash 
off blinded KPL -301 or placebo during a 12- week Washout Period.  During the Washout Safety Follow -
up Period, patients may be closely observed with no addition al therapeutic or may receive prophylactic 
prednisone and tapered as per Investigator discretion.  After the F inal Washout Safety Follow -up visit 
84 ± 3 days from the EOT Visit has been completed , subjects will exit the trial and should be transition ed 
to SoC per investigator judgement, regardless of what dose of prednisone subjects are on.  
Concomitant Medication : 
Subjects should receive concomitant medications in line with current SoC  practices for GCA. Such 
medications may include  but not limited to the equivalent of the following  examples : low-dose aspirin 
(dose allowed per SoC ), pantoprazole (40 mg daily), calcium (1000 mg daily), cholecalciferol (800 U 
daily), and IV  ibandronate 3 mg every 3 months, for the duration of the study.  
Duration of Treatment:  
Subjects will receive SC KPL -301 or placebo as well as coadministered study-supplied oral prednisone , 
which will be tapered over a period of up to 26 weeks, unless the subject experi ences a flare of GCA. 
Upon completion of the 26- week double -blind period subjects  will discontinue KPL -301 or placebo and 
enter  the 12- week Washout Safety Follow -up period in which they may receive  study -supplied oral 
prednisone per the Investigator ’s discretion.  Thus, the total study duration will be  up to approximately 38-
44 weeks (including 6- week Screening Period) . 
Efficacy Measures: 
• Clinical laboratory analyses (e.g. , CRP, ESR , signs/symptoms ) 
• Clinical GCA assessment s, including, signs/symptom(s) ,

Overview of Trial Design   
  
Statistical Methods:  
General Methods 
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® Version 9.4 or higher. All clinical study data will be 
presented in subject data listings. Descriptive statistics will  be presented for all endpoints and will include 
number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), first qu artile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), 
minimum and maximum for continuous variables, and frequency and  percentage for categorical and 
ordinal variables. The preliminary SAP is presented here, with the final SAP to be confirmed in a separate 
document (SAP) prior to study unblinding. 
Modified Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set 
All randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of KPL-301 or placebo and at least have 1 assessment 
in the double blind treatment period will be included in the mo dified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set. 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the mITT analysis set. All mITT analyses will be based on each 
subject’s randomized treatment assignment.  
Safety Analysis Set 
All randomized subjects who take at least 1 dose of KPL-301 or placebo will be included in the Safety 
Analysis Set. Safety analyses will be based on the medication t hat was actually administered to each 
subject. 
Per Protocol Analysis Set 

Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals Ltd.   30 March 2020  
KPL -301-C001 (v 4.0)  Final  Page 13 of 101 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  All mITT subjects without important protocol deviations deemed to impact efficacy  or ethical conduct  
will be included in the per -protocol ( PP) analysis set.  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
The primary efficacy  endpoint is time to flare by W eek 26 defined as time from randomization to the first 
flare occurring within the treatment period. Detailed censoring rules will be provided in the SAP.  
The number and percentage of subjects who remain in remission  (no flare), who flare, and who are lost to 
follow-up prior to a flare during the  treatment period will be summarized for each treatment group.  T ime 
to flare by W eek 26  will be summarized by the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles calculated using 
the Kaplan -Meier method to estimate the survival  functions for each treatment group. The 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for the percentiles will also be calculated. A log -rank test stratified by randomization strata  
will be used to compare KPL -301 and placebo with respect to time to flare  by W eek 26 .  To describe the 
magnitude of treatment effect, the hazard ratio for KPL -301 compared to placebo and the corresponding 
95% CI will be calculated based on a Cox proportional -hazards model with treatment as a covariate and 
stratified by the randomization strata .  
The protocol definition of flare includes multiple components. Supportive analyses will be performed 
based on each individual component.  The details will be described in the SAP.  In addition, a sensitivity 
analysis will be performe d using the same method described above for the per -protocol analysis set.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
Sustained remission rate at Week 26 will be estimated and compared using the  Kaplan -Meier method   
The following endpoints will be analysed using the Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test , stratified by  the 
randomized stratum : 
• Percentage of subjects who have completed the corticosteroid taper and who have a  normal ESR  
by Week 26  
• Percentage of subjects who have completed the corticosteroid taper and who have a  normal CRP  
by Week 26  
• Percentage of subjects who have completed the corticosteroid taper and who have no 
signs/symptoms of GCA  nor new or worsening vasculitis by imaging by Week 26  
The following time  to event endpoints w ill be analyzed using the same methods used for the primary 
efficacy endpoint : 
• Time to elevated ESR by Week 26  
• Time to elevated CRP by Week 26  
• Time to signs/symptoms of GCA or new or worsening vasculitis by imaging  by W eek 26  
The following continuous secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed. The analyses will include 
two-sided 95% CI s for the difference of treatment means, as appropriate. Details will be described in the 
SAP: 
• Cumulative steroid dose at Week 26 and at the end of the Wash out Safety Follow -up period

a. EOT visit must  be conducted in the event the  subject  permanently  discontinues KPL -301 or p lacebo . After the EOT visit, su bjects who discontinue treatment should continue attending their 
remaining scheduled visits for the duration of the study.  
b. In the event of an unscheduled visit, only the relevant assessments /activities  pertaining to the visit need to be captured. Subjects reporting worsening of GCA symptoms or any safety issues may be 
brought in for an unscheduled visit at the study clinic at any time . This visit can be combined with the EOT visit in which all necessary  EOT related  assessments/activities  should be completed.  
c. All subjects , including subjects who prematurely discontinue the study (i.e., withdraw consent) , must complete a t a minimum the F inal Safety Follow up visit 84 ± 3 days after the EOT Visit.   
Addition al follow up using public records may be captured if possible.  
d. At baseline , subject and/or caregiver should be trained on proper self -administration and handling and accountability of study drug. This training should be documented and can be repeated as 
necessary throughout the study.  
e. If a study site or clinic visit coincides with the subject’s scheduled dose, study treatment will be administered at the study site or c linic.   Study drug treatment should be dispensed as necessary to  the 
subject  for home administration to ensure dosing compliance.  Investigator staff may contact patients between visits to ensure compliance with protocol -specified treatment regimens.  
f. New-onset subjects can have an optional temporal artery biopsy taken at Screening  (or otherwise available from diagnostic workup) and Week 26 as part of the study. For relapsing/refractory 
patients, if the subject has not had a prior  a temporal biopsy an optional biopsy can be done at Screening and Week 26 . If the subject has an existing biopsy sample available  this can be submitted as 
the screening/predose  sample and an optional biopsy can be performed at W eek 26 .  
g. Chest X -ray (or high r es CT) , DLCO , and PFTs  should be obtained at S creening , or existing docu mentation  (if available)  within 12 weeks of D ay 0 can be used and reviewed by the Investigator or 
designee.  
h. PFTs and DLCO should be performed at  Screening  within  6 weeks prior to Day 0 (or documented report available  from PFT &/or DLCO from within 12 weeks prior to Day 0) . They should also be 
performed at  Weeks 12 and 26 and 38 with a window  of ±14 days . 
   
  
k. Subjects will be given prednisone as necessary and instructed to dose in alignment with their prednisone taper . Investigator staff may c ontact  patients between visits to ensure compliance with 
protocol specified treatment regimens . 
l. Clinical decisions for determination of inclusion and flare will be based upon  local laboratory values  either ES R and/ or CRP . 
m. The imaging technique used during screening to diagnose GCA  should be repeated at week 26 for the study.  If ultrasound is available at screening for diagnosis of GCA this should be conducted 
again at weeks 12, 26 and 38, or in case of a suspected flare of GCA with no other imaging (MRI, CT/CTA or PET -CT) required.  If MRI, CT/CTA or PET -CT was used at screening for diagnosis 
of GCA and no ultrasound is available, the same imaging technique used at screening  should be repeated at week 26 or  as neces sary for diagnosis  in case a suspected flare.  
n. Ultrasound imaging if clinically relevant should be performed at  or before  Day 0 to support clinical remission decision making unless there is no evidence of temporal artery inflammation and 
diagnosis of GCA is confined to large vessels (By MRI or CT) .

CONFIDENTIAL  6 Introduction  
6.1 Overview   
Giant cell arteritis ( GCA) is a disease characterized by blood vessel inflammation and infiltration of 
monocytes , macrophages and the accumulation of giant cells (i.e., multinucleated fusions of macrophages) 
and has high unmet medical need ( Dejaco et al, 2017 ; Roberts and Clifford, 2017). GCA, unless treated 
(either with long -term systemic corticosteroid treatment or tocilizumab  with corticosteroid treatment), can 
lead to blindness, aortic aneurysm and/or death ( Weyand and Goronzy, 2014) . Granulocyte-macrophage 
colony growth factor ( GM-CSF) is a key growth factor for many of the key inflammatory cell types at the 
site of the vascular lesion (i.e., macrophages, monocytes and giant cells; Wicks and Roberts, 2016),  and 
additionally, GM -CSF is found in high concentrations at the site of damage in the vessel wall ( Weyand et 
al, 1994) . These data provide solid rationale for antagonizing this signaling pathway in GCA.  
Mavrilimumab (also known as KPL -301 for this development program, or previously as CAM -3001) is a 
fully human monoclonal antibody that antagonizes GM -CSF biological activity by binding to its recept or 
alpha subunit (GM -CSFRα) and thereby preventing downstream signalling . KPL -301 has been studied in 
over 500 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and recently achieved its primary endpoint in a Phase 2b 
trial in this indication with a well -tolerated safety profile . KPL -301 may provide a treatment option in high 
unmet need indications where there is a strong mechanistic rationale for modulating key cell types in 
diseases in which GM -CSF signalling  is critical for proper functioning (e.g., monocytes, mac rophages, 
and granulocytes) . Refer to the current version of the Investigator Brochure for further details.  
GCA is an inflammatory disease of large - and medium -sized arteries that causes headaches, ischemic 
visual loss, and jaw and other muscle claudicatio n (Dejaco et al, 2017 ). If left untreated, GCA can lead to 
monocular or binocular blindness, aortic aneurysm, myocardial infarction, and, rarely, stroke and death 
(Weyand and Goronzy, 2014) . GCA presents with a wide and variable spectrum of signs and sympt oms 
(Weyand and Goronzy, 2014) . Diagnosis is usually made provisionally on the basis of clinical signs and 
symptoms and then confirmed by color D oppler ultrasound or by temporal artery biopsy ( TAB ) (Dejaco et 
al, 2018) ( Figure 1).  In the United States  (US), the lifetime risk of developing GCA has been estimated at 
approximately one percent in women and 0.5 percent in men ( Crowson et al, 2011). GCA generally affects 
adults over 50 years of age, with a 3:1 imbalance of women to men ( Weyand and Goronzy, 2014) . The 
reported prevalence of proven GCA in populations aged over 50 years varies significantly geographically and ranges  between 24  to 200 per 100,000 individuals in the European Union and 24 to 278 per 100,000 
individuals in the US ( Salvarani et al , 2004 ; Lawrence et al , 2008;  Lee et al , 2008).

Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of treatment  (Figure 2) because they normalize inflammatory markers; 
however, many patients receive long courses of this therapy to prevent disease flare -up, and long- term use 
is associated with significant and serious side effects, including glaucoma, fluid retention, hypertension, 
mood changes, memory changes, other psychological effects, weight gain , and diabetes (Roberts and 
Clifford, 2017).

CONFIDENTIAL  Figure 2:  GCA Treatment Algorithm  
 
 
While  corticosteroids are effective for some patients, many times patients are unable to wean from 
corticosteroids because they continue to experience disease flares as the dose is reduced (Dejaco  et al, 
2017; Salvarani et al, 2012) . In one study cohort published in the literature that followed 106 patients with 
GCS over 4.5  to 10.1 years, 68 patients (64%) experienced at least one relapse, and 38 (36%) experienced 
two or more relapses during or after corticosteroid weaning ( Alba et al, 2014).  
Experimental evidence in SCID mice ( severe combined immunodeficiency  model) suggests that 
glucocorticoid treatment inhibits the T -cell mediated pathology but does not adequately suppress tissue -
infiltrating macrophage function—a key cell type generated and maintained by GM -CSF sig naling, the 
target of KPL -301—and may explain why many patients require long- term chronic treatment and are 
unable to wean off corticosteroids ( Brack et al, 1997 ). By blocking GM -CSF signaling at the receptor, 
KPL -301 may provide additional benefit to these patients by reducing long- term sequelae that result from 
chronic vessel inflammation and reduc ing steroid dependency.  
ACTEMRA® (tocilizumab), an IL -6 receptor inhibitor, recently received marketing approval in the US  
and certain Europe countries in GCA for use concomitantly with a corticosteroid taper; however, an unmet 
need still  remains for improved therapeutic options, as just under 50% of patients did not achieve 
sustained remission over 52 weeks on tocilizumab after a 26 -week corticosteroid taper (Stone et al, 2017).  
6.2 GM-CSF Biology  
GM-CSF is a growth factor first identified a s an inducer of differentiation and proliferation of myeloid 
cells (e.g., neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and macrophages)  (Wicks and Roberts, 2016) . 
Studies using different approaches have demonstrated that with GM -CSF overexpression, pathological 
changes almost always follow ( Hamilton and Anderson, 2004). Figure 3  illustrates an overview of the 
mechanism of action of KPL -301 and of key pathways involving GM -CSF.

CONFIDENTIAL  Figure 3:  GM-CSF Biology and KPL -301 Mechanism of Action  
 
 
The following reported data suggest GM -CSF is a key mediator of inflammation and autoimmunity 
(Wicks and Roberts, 2016):  
• GM-CSF enhances trafficking of myeloid cells through activated endothelium of blood vessels 
and can also contribute to monocyte and macrophage accumulation in blood vessels during 
inflammation.  
• GM-CSF promotes activation, differentiation, survival, and proliferation of monocytes and 
macrophages as well as resident tissue macrophages in inflamed tissues.  
• Local GM -CSF production leads to activation of the vasculature and bone marrow and also 
promotes the differentiation of effector T cells at inflamed sites and draining lymph nodes.  
• GM-CSF also regulates the phenotype of antigen- presenting cells in inflamed tissues by 
promoting the differentiation of infiltrating monocytes into M1 macrophages  and monocyte -
derived dendritic cells (MoDCs).  
• The production of IL -23 by macrophages and MoDCs, in combination with other cytokines such 
as IL -6 and IL -1, modulates T -cell differentiation.  
• Local ly-produced GM -CSF acts on sensory neurons expressing the GM -CSF receptor, 
transmitting painful stimuli to ascending nociceptive pathways in the spinal cord and brain.

CONFIDENTIAL  Additionally, GM -CSF is a confirmed key mediator of at least one autoimmune disease, as dem onstrated 
by the successful, clinically relevant , and statistically significant effect KPL -301 had on primary and 
secondary efficacy measures in multiple Phase 2 trials in patients with RA .  
6.3 Non-Clinical and Clinical Experience with KPL -301 
MedImmune studi ed KPL-301 in over 550 patients with RA through Phase 2b development. A summary 
of clinical trials conducted in RA is provided in Table 2. These studies provide proof -of-efficacy in an 
autoimmune disease and are an accurate representation of the safety profile of KPL -301 to- date. More 
detailed information on the safety profile and pulmonary test threshold values can be found in the IB.

In addition to the reductions to the primary endpoint demonstrated in the Phase 2b trials, other markers of 
inflammation (e.g., CRP , ESR, and IL -6) were similarly reduced and may provide evidence for KPL -301’s 
utility across a broad range of indications with a similar biomarker profile, including GCA ( Figure 4).

6.3.1 Clinical Development Plan for KPL -301 in GCA  
Results from Phase 2b studies in RA  have provided important information about the safety and efficacy 
profile of KPL-301. GCA is an appropriate indication for  the study of KPL -301 due to the mechanistic 
rationale of inhibiting GM -CSF, a key growth factor for the cell types involved in the pathology of GCA 
(e.g., monocytes, macrophages and giant cells). Additionally, administration of KPL -301 in patients with 
RA markedly reduced key markers of disease activity that are also seen in GCA (i.e., CRP, ESR , and IL -6 
receptor  the target of tocilizumab). T his patient population has a high level of unmet need owing to the 
number of patients who continue to experience relapsing disease despite currently existing therapies.  
7 Study Objectives  
7.1 Objectives  
7.1.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of KPL -301 versus placebo, coadmini stered 
with a 26- week steroid taper, for maintaining sustained remission for 26 weeks in subjects with new -onset 
or relapsing/refractory giant cell arteritis (GCA ). 
7.1.2 Secondary Objective(s)  
The secondary objectives of the study, in subjects with new -onset and relapsing/refractory GCA, are:  
a) To evaluate the effect of KPL -301 vs placebo on cumulative corticosteroid dose.  
 
c) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of KPL -301.

CONFIDENTIAL  -resistant patients. KPL-301 may permit tapering of steroids, or their replacement, in steroid -responsive 
patients and achieve a response in steroid -refractory patients.  
The steroid taper chosen for this study is based on a standard taper used in clinical practice  as well as prior 
clinical trials ( Stone et al , 2017) , with patients starting the study on the dose of prednisone they were 
previously taking and following the taper accordingly. For subjects starting on 20 mg or 25 mg 
prednisone, their dose will be held at ≥  20 mg for the first 3 weeks of the study, as these subjects may be 
more liable to flare if their taper were to proceed too rapidly.  
For this study, the SC route of administration, via prefilled syringe, was chosen over the IV route as it provides a more convenient method of administration in this elderly population of patients with GCA 
(e.g., home administration, no requirement for venous access).  
8.2 Selection of Doses in the Study  
Subjects randomized to KPL -301 will receive 150 mg every other week  by SC injection  coadministered 
with a 26 -week steroid taper. This dose was chosen based on the outcomes of previous dose -ranging 
assessments in P hase 2 clinical trials in patients with RA and on PK /PD modeling.  
Study CD -IA-CAM -3001- 1071 (randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, parallel group, multicenter 
study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 3 SC doses of KPL -301 ( CAM -3001) [30, 100, and 150 mg] 
administered every other week  for 24 weeks in combination with MTX  to 326 subjects with adult onset  
RA, and an inadequate response to one or more conventional disease modifying anti -rheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs ) and at least moderately active disease (Disease Activity Score of 28 joints based on CRP  
[DAS28 (CRP) ≥ 3.2] and at least 4 swollen joints despite t reatment with MTX ) identified the greatest 
treatment effect in the 150 mg dose group. Both co- primary endpoints were met; the change from Day 1 in 
DAS28 (CRP) score at Week 12 and the American College of Rheumatology definition of improvement 
by 20% (ACR20) response rate at Week 24 were statistically significantly greater for all three KPL-301 
(CAM -3001) groups compared with placebo.  
• For mean change in DAS28 (CRP) the magnitude of response was dose dependent and 
statistically significant (p < 0.001), with the greatest treatment effect observed in the 150 mg dose group (more than 73.4% of subjects in the 150 mg KPL -301 [ CAM -3001] group achieved an 
ACR20 response at Week 24, compared to 24.7% on placebo)  
• Secondary efficacy analyses identified significant treatment effects (p < 0.001) vs placebo in the 150 mg KPL -301 (CAM -3001) group (ACR50 response at day 169, 40.5% vs 12.3%; DAS28  
(CRP)  < 2.6 sustained at day 169, 16.5% vs 0; DAS28 (CRP) low disease activity at day 169, 
41.8% vs 8.6%), and the 150 mg group included the highest proportion of European League Against Rheumatism ( EULAR ) (Aletaha et al, 2010 ; Felson  et al, 2011) moderate and good 
responders.  
• Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were absent in the 150 mg KPL -301 (CAM -3001) group (detected in 
subjects in the placebo and 30 mg and 100 mg KPL -301 [ CAM -3001] groups) 
A mechanistic population PK model was developed to describe the observed single -dose PK profi les of 
KPL -301 ( CAM -3001) in subjects with RA. From stochastic clinical trial simulations using the population 
PK/PD model, maximum efficacy (ACR20 response rate) is reached at 150 mg KPL -301 (CAM -3001) 
every other week . The 150 mg KPL -301 (CAM -3001) dose is predicted to be more effective than the 
100 mg dose, and the steady- state serum concentrations of KPL -301 (CAM -3001) were maintained above 
ACR20 90% efficacy concentration (3.4 μg/mL) in more than 90% of RA subjects.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.3 Justification for Placebo  
The proposed study is a placebo -controlled, double-blind study of SC doses of KPL -301 coadministered 
with a 26-week taper of oral prednisone. The double -blind, placebo- controlled, randomized clinical study 
design is considered the gold standard for the safety and efficacy assessment of a new therapy both by 
clinicians and regulatory authorities . In this study subjects will receive oral predniso ne starting at 20  to 
60 mg/day as per the Investigators judgment in addition to KPL -301 or placebo to control their disease 
activity . Subjects are also allowed to receive permitted concomitant medications in line with current SoC 
practices for GCA . Any subject who cannot adhere to the protocol -defined steroid taper due  to 
flare/relapse must discontinue the assigned study drug  (KPL -301 or placebo) and should receive escape 
therapy in accordance with local SoC . Subjects are not allowed to receive biologic DMARDs while 
receiving  KPL -301 during the study to mitigate potenti al safety risks of administering KPL -301 
concomitantly with other biologics . In addition, any subject who discontinues treatment will have an  EOT  
and will be followed for the intended duration of the study. 
8.4 Methodology 
8.4.1 Main Study  
This Phase 2 randomized, placebo -controlled POC study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of KPL -301 
co-administered with a 26 -week corticosteroid taper in patients with GCA. The study will consist of a 
Screening Period (up to 6 weeks) ; a 26-week  Double-B lind placebo -controlled P eriod during which 
subjects will receive blinded KPL -301 or placebo coadministered with  a 26-week corticosteroid taper and 
a 12-week Washout Safety Follow -up Period.  
Following signing of the ICF, potential subjects 50- 85 years of age (inclusive) will be sc reened for 
meeting study -specified diagnostic criteria for GCA.  
• Acute Phase Reactants - Westergren ESR > 30 mm/hour or CRP ≥ 1  mg/dL  
AND  
• Signs/Symptoms - A t least one of the following:  
i. Unequivocal cranial symptoms of GCA (new -onset localized headache, scalp, or temporal 
artery pain or tenderness, ischemia- related vision loss, or otherwise unexplained mouth or 
jaw pain upon mastication)  
ii. Unequivocal extra -cranial symptoms of GCA, such as c laudication of the extremities  
iii. Symptoms of PMR, defined as shoulder and/or hip girdle pain associated with inflammatory 
morning stiffness  
AND  
• Diagnostic Criteria  - At least one of the following:  
i. TAB or ultrasound revealing features of GCA  
ii. Evidence of large -vessel vasculitis by angiography or cross- sectional imaging study such as 
MRI, CT/  CTA , or PET -CT of the aorta or other great vessels

CONFIDENTIAL  Upon successful completion of the screening procedures, eligible subjects will be stratified for 
randomi zed study treatment into two cohorts according to whether subjects have new -onset disease or 
relapsing/refractory (hereafter, “relapsing” for brevity) disease:  
• New-onset - The new -onset disease cohort includes subjects who have been newly  diagnosed 
within 6 weeks of Day 0  using the above Acute Phase Reactant, Signs/Symptoms and Diagnosis 
criteria.  
• Relapsing/refractory – (either or) 
o The relapsing disease cohort includes subjects having prior documented diagnos is of 
GCA as per above Diagnostic Criteria  > 6 we eks before Day 0  and who have active GCA 
disease defined as Acute Phase Reactants and Signs/Symptoms  within 6 weeks of Day 0 . 
o The refractory nonremitting disease subject has  no remission since the diagnosis of 
disease as per clinical expectations Thus, the subject has documentation of prior diagnosis of GCA as per above Diagnostic Criteria > 6 weeks before Day 0 ; however, presence of 
Acute Phase Reactants and Signs/Symptoms as per above persist s within 6 weeks of 
Day 0. 
Subjects who complete screening procedures and are not considered eligible ( screen failures) may be 
rescreened one time provided there is reason to believe that eligibility criteria will be met.  
Stratified eligible subjects will enter the double -blind treatment period after randomization 3:2 to blinded 
treatment with KPL -301 150 mg or placebo administered SC every other week (every 2 weeks). All 
subjects will also receive an unblinded 26 -week oral prednisone taper according to a standardized tapering 
protocol.  
Prior to first administration of KPL -301 or placebo , all subjects are required to achieve remission (i.e., 
resolution of GCA symptom(s) and CRP < 1.0  mg/dL or ESR  < 20 mm in the first hour). Should a subj ect 
in screening not achieve remission by >  6 weeks of onset they can be rescreened  using their prior flare 
documentation following the relapsing/refractory non- remitting inclusion criteria.  
The first administration of subcutaneous KPL -301/placebo and oral  prednisone taper will take place at the 
study site on Day 0. Subsequent doses of KPL -301/placebo will be administered at the study site in 
conjunction with a scheduled study visit or administered by the subject on an outpatient basis in 
accordance to the dosing schedule.  The oral steroid taper will be self -administered by study subjects on a 
daily basis.  
Subjects will be followed at the study site at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and approximately every 4 weeks thereafter 
(see Table 1). Sub jects reporting worsening of GCA symptoms or any safety issues may be brought in for 
an unscheduled visit at the study site at any time.  
If a flare/relapse is suspected, the Investigator must consult the Contract Research Organization (CRO) -designated Medical Expert to review and harmonize the elements of the diagnostic work-up.

CONFIDENTIAL  Flare/relapse is defined as a re- increase of CRP from normal to 1  mg/dL or greater and/or of ESR from 
less than 20 mm in the first hour to 30 mm or greater AND at least one of t he following signs or 
symptoms attributed by the Investigator to new, worsening, or recurrent GCA : 
• Cranial symptoms  
o New or recurrent headache or pain or tenderness of the scalp or the temporal artery  
o Visual signs/symptoms such as ischemic retinopathy, optic neuropathy, diplopia, amaurosis 
fugax, etc.  
o New or recurrent claudication of the tongue, masseter muscle, or worsening temporal artery signs and symptoms  
o Transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke related to GCA in the opinion of the Investigator  
• Extracranial symptoms  
o Classic PMR -like symptoms, defined as shoulder and/or hip girdle pain associated with 
inflammatory morning stiffness  
o New or recurrent claudication in the peripheral circulation (i.e., in one of the extremities)  
• New or worsening angiographic abnormalities detected via MRI, CT/CTA, or PET -CT of the 
aorta or other great vessels or via ultrasound of the temporal arteries   
Supportive findings could include other symptoms in the opinion of the Investigator related to worsening GCA, such as sustained daily recurrent fever with a temperature over 38°C for more than 1 week, chronic anemia, or unexplained weight loss.  
All elements of the diagnostic work -up pertinent to the Investigator diagnosis of a flare/relapse (i.e., the 
primary clinical end point) should be reviewed with the CRO -designated Medical Expert and entered into 
the eCRF promptly.  
Flare/relapse is defined as major  if cranial symptoms or ischemia -related visual loss are present, or if there 
is clear evidence of new onset large vessel  vasculitis (e.g. , subclavian artery). In all other situations 
flare/relapse attributed to PMR, vascular or other symptoms should be regarded as minor .  
Subjects who experience a flare or subjects who cannot adhere to the protocol -defined steroid  taper due  to 
a flare should be managed  to ensure the best possible care of the subject. T he subject must discontinue the 
assigned  study drug  (KPL -301 or placebo) and should receive escape therapy in accordance with local 
SoC, which  may include, for example, dose mo difications of corticosteroids, other immunomodulatory 
agents, and/or approved therapies (e.g. tocilizumab).  Escape corticosteroid therapy can be escalated 
immediately.  Due to possible safety and pharmacologic effects resulting from overlapping exposures to 
immunomodulatory agents on top of coadministered corticosteroids, the investigator should consider a washout period of at least 35 days (based on elimination half -lives) after the last dose of study drug if 
deemed clinically appropriate.  The dosages of all concomitant medications used to treat the GCA flare 
must be entered into the eCRF .  
Any subject who prematurely discontinues the study drug treatment for safety or other reason will have an 
EOT visit and will be followed for the intended duration of st udy treatment (i.e., through W eek 26 and 
Washout Safety Follow -up) to address potential issues of informative censoring. Any subject who 
withdraws consent from the trial (i.e., all study procedures in addition to study drug) must complete a t a 
minimum the Final Washout  Safety Follow -up visit 8 4 ± 3 days from the last dose administered.   
Additional follow -up using public records may be captured where possible. 
An analysis of the study will be performed when the last subject reaches Week 26 according to the SAP.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.4.2 Washout Safety Follow -up 
After subjects complete the 26 -week double -blind treatment period, they will discontinue and wash off of 
blinded KPL -301 or placebo during a 12- week Washout Safety Follow -up Period, which includes close 
safety follow -up an d monitoring for potential GCA flares.  During this time, it is recommended that 
subjects, regardless of remission status, receive SoC therapy, taking into consideration that they have just 
completed treatment with what may have been an efficacious therapy  which supported the tapering off of 
standard of care concomitant oral corticosteroids.  Clinicians may choose to observe subjects closely 
during the washout period without any change in concomitant medications or may choose (consistent with current SoC guidelines) to increase the daily corticosteroid dose prophylactically/empirically by 
approximately 10mg above the prednisone dose administered at Week 26.  The prednisone dose can then 
be tapered, increased  or maintained throughout the remainder of the 12-w eek Washout Safety Follow -up 
Period as per Investigator discretion.  After the F inal Washout Safety Follow -up visit (Week 38) has been 
completed , the subjects will exit the trial and should be transitioned to SoC per investigator judgement.  It 
is not required that the steroid taper have been completed (0 mg) prior to subjects exiting the trial at Week  38. 
8.5 Study Duration  
Subjects will complete the screening period in up to 6 weeks. Eligible subjects will be randomized and receive KPL -301 or placebo for 26 w eeks (unless a subject discontinues treatment prematurely). Upon 
completion of the 26- week double -blind period subjects  will discontinue KPL -301 or placebo and enter  
the 12- week Washout Safety Follow -up period in which they may receive study supplied oral prednisone 
per the Investigator’s discretion.  Thus, the total study duration will be up to approximately 38-44 weeks 
(including Screening Period) . 
The end of the study (“study completion”) is defined as the date of the last protocol -specified 
visit/assess ment (including telephone contact) for the last subject in the study.  
8.6 Number of P lanned S ubjects  
Approximately 70 patients  with GCA will be randomized  as study subjects .  For the primary endpoint 
analysis, the aim is to have 42 subjects assigned to KPL-301 and 28 subjects assigned to placebo, with 
balanced randomization in the two randomization cohorts. 
The sample size was chosen on an empirical basis, based on experience w ith other  KPL -301 trials and 
other research in this patient population.

9.3 Prednisone  
Prednisone Tablets USP are available for oral administration containing either 1 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 
20 mg or 50 mg of prednisone USP. Each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: lactose 
monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch, sodium starch 
glycolate, and stearic acid (1 mg, 2.5 mg, and 5 mg only).  
Prednisone tablets co ntain prednisone which is a glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids are adrenocortical 
steroids, both naturally occurring and synthetic, which are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The chemical name for prednisone is 17,21-dihydroxypregna-1,4-dienne-3,11,20-trione.  
 
Prednisone is a white to partially white, crystalline powder. It is very slightly soluble in water; slightly soluble in alcohol, chloroform, dioxane, and methanol.  
Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), whi ch also have salt -retaining 
properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are primarily used for their potent anti -inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems . Prednisone 
is used as adj unctive therapy for short -term administration (to tide the patient over an acute episode or 
exacerbation) in rheumatoid inflammation such as GCA.  
On Day 0, each subject will begin the steroid taper, using oral prednisone tablets provided by the Sponsor 
to the study site . To ensure subjects perform the taper according to the protocol, they will be provided 
with a written schedule, specific to their s tarting dose, that instructs them on the daily dose to be taken in 
each week of the study. Investigator staff may contact patients between visits to ensure compliance with 
prednisone taper.  
The duration of the steroid taper , in the absence of a GCA flare,  is planned to take up to 26 weeks, 
depending on the starting dose of prednisone the subject was taking before enrolling in the study  
(see Table 3). Any subject who cannot adhere to the protocol -defined steroid taper due to flare/relapse will 
be allowed  escape therapy  per the Investigator. During the Washout Safety Follow -up Period, the 
prednisone dose can then be tapered, increas ed or maintained throughout the remainder of the 12- week 
Washout Period as per the discretion of the Investigator .  After the F inal Washout Safety Follow -up visit 
(Week 38) has been completed the subjects will exit the trial and should be transitioned to SoC per investigator judgement.

9.4 Method of  Assigning S ubjects to T reatment Groups 
Subjects  who are candidates for enrollment will be evaluated for eligibility by the I nvestigator to ensure 
that the criteria given in Section 8.7 have been  satisfied and that the subject s are eligible for 
randomization. 
Subjects will be randomized at a 3: 2 ratio to receive either 150 mg KPL -301 or placebo.  Randomization 
will be stratified according to whether subjects have new -onset disease or relapsing disease.    
9.5 KPL -301 or Placebo Administration  
The first administration of KPL -301 or placebo will take place at the study site on Day 0 by the 
Investigator or qualified study center staff. At this visit, subjects will be trained on self -administration of 
KPL -301 or placebo, such that subsequent doses, which will be administered every other week 
(14 ±3 days), may be self- administered by the subject or subject’s  caregiver as an outpatient. If a clinic 
visit coincides with the subject’s scheduled dose, KPL -301 or placebo will be administered at the study 
site. If a subject is unable or does not wish to self -administer at home outside of a scheduled visit, clinic 
staff may administer the injections to the subject as part of an unscheduled visit. The location of and 
occasions when the subject or caregiver administered the SC injection should be recorded in the patient’s  
study notes . Subjects will be instructed in pro per syringe disposal and will be cautioned against reuse of 
these items . All used syringes must be disposed in a provided sharps container and returned to the study 
site for destruction. All unused KPL -301 or placebo must be returned to the study site for accountability.  
Before administration, the prefilled syringe of study drug should be allowed to come to room temperature. 
The label on the prefilled syringe should be removed just before use and placed on the corresponding 
dosing diary form. Study drug will be injected in the upper arm, thigh, or abdomen and will be administered using a 27G needle. The person administering the dose will wipe the skin surface of the upper arm, thigh, or abdomen with alcohol and allow to air dry. The skin will be pinched to i solate the SC 
tissue from the muscle. The needle will be inserted at a 90 -degree angle approximately halfway into the 
SC tissues overlaying the muscle. Th e study drug should be injected slowly (at least 5- second duration is 
recommended) into the SC tissue using gentle pressure. The area should not be massaged after injection. 
The site as well as date and time of the injection should be documented. Immediately after injections at 
home, subjects must place the used syringe in a sharps container provided by the study site.  
The interval between KPL -301 or placebo administrations must be at least 11 days  and no more than 
17 days. 
Additional information regarding preparation, administration , and storage  of KPL -301 or placebo will be 
described in the Pharmacy Manua l.

CONFIDENTIAL  9.6 Blinding  
9.6.1 Methods for Ensuring Blinding  
This is a double -blind study in which KPL -301 and placebo are identical in appearance/viscosity. Neither 
the subject nor any of the Investigator or Sponsor staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical 
evaluation of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received (International Conference on 
Harmonisation [ICH] E9). If the treatment allocation for a subject becomes known to the Investigator or 
other study staff involved in the management of study subjects, the Sponsor must be notified immediately. 
If the Investigator  intends to  unblind trea tment allocation for a subject, then the Sponsor should be notified 
immediately.  
9.6.2 Unblinding  
In the event of a medical emergency, the Investigator may unblind an individual subject’s treatment  
allocation  and notify the Sponsor. In general, unblinding should  only occur if management of the medical 
emergency would be different based on the subject having received active drug. In most  cases, the 
management of a medical emergency would be the same whether or not active drug was being received by 
the subject. If this were to be the case, the treatment  allocation should not be unblinded.  
10 Concomitant Therapy and Treatment Compliance  
10.1 Concomitant Medications  
Subjects should receive concomitant medications in line with current SoC practices for GCA. Such 
medications ma y include  but not limited to the equivalent of the following  examples : low- dose aspirin 
(dose allowed per SoC ), pantoprazole (40 mg daily), calcium (1000 mg daily), cholecalciferol (800 U 
daily), and IV ibandronate 3 mg every 3 months, for the duration of the study.  
Investigators may also prescribe concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary to provide 
adequate supportive care except for those medications identified as “excluded” as listed in Section 10.2. 
The following concomitant medications are permitted during the study:  
1. Inactivated vaccines. Subjects who are eligible for yearly influenza vaccine or who require 
booster vaccinations for other diseases can receive vaccination with killed/toxoid vaccines consistent with normal clinical practice. The effect of KPL -301 on vaccine response is not known.  
2. Vitamins and nutritional supplements.  
It is strongly recommended to avoid herbal or traditional medicine treatments since no formal assessment of potential interactions, risk benefit, or a safety profile for these products is available in the context of experimental drug testing. All concomitant medicatio ns, including any changes in vitamins, supplements, 
and herbal or traditional remedies during the study are to be recorded.  
10.2 Excluded Concomitant Medication  
The introduction of the following medications is not permitted from initiation of screening through the end 
of the study unless indicated for escape therapy. The Sponsor is to be notified if any of the following 
medications are introduced to a subject during the study:  
1. Investigational drug therapy other than KPL -301 
2. Biologic DMARD therapies (such as anti -TNF, recombinant interleukin-1 receptor  antagonist, 
anti-IL-6 receptor  [tocilizumab] , CTLA4 immunoglobulin, B -cell depleting therapies, etc) 
Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals Lt d.  30 March 2020  
KPL -301-C001 (v 4.0)  Final  Page 44 of 101 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  3. Azathioprine, cyclosporine, MTX , mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, and other 
alkylating agents  
4. Immunization with any live or live attenuated vaccine  
5. Immunoabsorption columns, plasmapheresis, and IV immunoglobulin therapy 
10.3 Escape Therapy  
Subject who cannot adhere to the protocol -defined steroid taper due to flare/relapse must discontinue 
study drug ( KPL -301 or placebo) and should receive escape therapy  in accordance with local SoC per the 
Investigator .  Escape therapy may include, for example , prednisone or similar >  60mg/day, IV 
corticosteroids , other immunomodulatory agents, and /or approved therapie s (e.g., tocilizumab) . These 
subjects are considered to have met  the primary endpoint provided the flare occurs prior to Week 26. 
Escape corticosteroid therapy can be escalated immediately. Due to unknown possible  safety and 
pharmacological effects from ov erlapping exposures to immunomodulatory agents on top of 
co-administered corticosteroids, the investigator should consider a washout period of at least 35 days 
(based on elimination half -lives) after the last dose of study drug (KPL -301 or placebo) if deem ed 
clinically appropriate.  
10.4 Treatment C ompliance 
Subject compliance will be assessed by maintaining adequate administration  records . Adherence to study 
drug administration ( KPL -301/placebo and prednisone for the steroid taper) will be assessed during the 
study site visits . Subjects will be given a diary to record home injections of KPL -301 or placebo and 
intake of prednisone tablets . Subjects will be asked to return all used supply containe rs as well as any 
unused study medication at each visit along with their diary as a measure of drug accountability and 
subject  compliance.  Investigator staff may contact patients between visits to ensure compliance with 
protocol specified treatment regimen s.     
Sharps containers for any used prefilled syringes will be provided to the subjects for home usage . After 
home injections the used syringes must be placed into the sharps containers immediately. The sharps 
containers should be  returned to the sites a nd discarded by the site staff as per local site procedure. 
11 Study Periods 
11.1 Screening Period  
After provision of written informed consent for the study, patients will be screened for study eligibility within 6 weeks before Day 0 (first dose).  
Results of SoC  tests or examinations performed prior to obtaining informed consent within 6 weeks prior 
to Day 0  may be used; such tests do not need to be repeated for screening. Other tests required by the 
protocol will be conducted and reimbursed by the Sponsor as necessary.  Written informed consent for 
study participation must be obtained before performing any study- specific screening tests or evaluations.  
All screening activities  must be completed  and eligibility confirmed before randomizing subjects and 
administering study drug.  
The Investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm 
eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable . Prior to first administration of KPL -301, 
all subjects are required to have achieved remission (i.e., resolution of GCA symptom(s) and CRP 
< 1.0 mg/dL or ESR  < 20 mm in the first hour). Should a subject in screening not achieve remission by 
Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals Lt d.  30 March 2020

CONFIDENTIAL  > 6 weeks of onset they can be rescreened following the relapsing/refractory non- remitting inclusion 
criteria.  
Refer to the Schedule of Activities  in Table 1 for activities  required during screening.  
11.2 Double- blind Period  
Following signing of the ICF  and successful completion of the screening procedures, eligible subjects will 
be randomized 3:2 to blinded treatment with KPL -301 or placebo administered SC every other week 
(every 2 weeks) in the double -blind treatment period  coadministered with a  26-week oral corticosteroid 
taper . 
The first administration of subcutaneous KPL -301/placebo and oral prednisone taper will take place at the 
study site on Day 0. Subsequent doses of KPL -301/placebo will be administered at the study site in 
conjunction with a scheduled study visit or dispensed to the subject for outpatient administration. All 
subjects will receive oral prednisone, which will be tapered down during the double -blind base period 
according to a standardized tapering protocol.  The steroid taper will be self -administered by study subjects 
on a daily basis.  Subjects will be followed at the study site at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and approximately every 
4 weeks thereafter  until week 26 ( see Table 1). Subjects re porting worsening of GCA symptoms or any 
safety issues may be brought in for an unscheduled visit at the study site at any time .  
Subject s who experience a flare or  who cannot adhere to the protocol -defined steroid taper due to 
flare/relapse must discontinue the assigned study drug  (KPL -301 or placebo) and should receive escape 
therapy in accordance with local SoC . These subjects will be considered to have met the primary endpoint 
if a flare has occurred prior to Week 26.  
Any subject who prematurely discontinues the study drug treatment for safety or other reason will have an EOT visit and will be followed for safety for the intended duration of the study to address potential issues 
of informative censoring. Any subject who withdraws consent from the trial (i.e., all study procedures in addition to study drug) must complete an EOT visit then proceed to the Washout Safety Follow -up Period 
or at a minimum have a F inal Washout Safety Follow -up visit 84 ± 3 days from the last dose administered.   
Additional follow up using public records may be captured where possible. 
12 Study Procedures  
12.1 Screening  and Randomization Procedures  
12.1.1  Informed Consent  
Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before performing any study-
specific screening test or evaluations . ICFs  for all patients who are enrolled  or who failed screen ing will 
be maintained at the study site.  
12.1.2  Medical History  and Demographics 
General medical history and subject demographic information will be recorded on eCRF . Additional 
information will be captured related to GCA including disease duration, history of prior flare/relapse, as 
well as history of allergy or anaphylaxis . In addition, subjects will be asked to report their current use and 
history of tobacco and smoking as well as provide more detailed information on pulmonary history.  
12.1.3  Eligibility  
All subjects screened will be assess ed for eligibility for randomization into the study according to the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria ( Section 8.7). A master log will be maintained of all enrolled subjects and will

CONFIDENTIAL  document all screening failures (i .e., subjects who are enrolled but not randomized ), including reason for 
screen failure.  
12.1.4  Subject Randomization  
An Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS ) will be used for assignment of the Subje ct Identification 
Number at enro llment, randomi zation to a treatment arm (KPL -301 or placebo), and assignment of 
blinded investigational product. A subject is considered randomized into the study when the Investigator 
confirms the eligibility criteria in  the IWRS and the pharmacist has been provided with the investigational 
product numbe r. 
12.2 Clinical GCA Related Assessments  
12.2.1  Clinical GCA Assessments  
Ideally clinical assessments of GCA signs/symptoms should occur prior to the investigator reviewing 
subject imaging, lab or acute phase reactant results at any given visit to minimize potential for assessment 
bias. 
• Cranial symptoms  
o New or recurrent headache or pain or tenderness of the scalp or the temporal artery  
o Visual signs/symptoms such as ischemic retinopathy, optic neuropathy, diplopia, amaurosis fugax, etc.  
o New or recurrent claudication of the tongue, masseter muscle, or worsening te mporal 
artery signs and symptoms  
o TIA or stroke related to GCA in the opinion of the Investigator  
• Extracranial symptoms  
o Classic PMR -like symptoms, defined as shoulder and/or hip girdle pain associated with 
inflammatory morning stiffness  
o New or recurrent claudication in the peripheral circulation (i.e., in one of the extremities)  
• New or worsening angiographic abnormalities detected via MRI, CT/CTA, or PET -CT of the 
aorta or other great vessels or via ultrasound of the temporal arteries   
Supportive findings  could include other symptoms in the opinion of the Investigator related to worsening 
GCA, such as sustained daily recurrent fever with a temperature over 38°C for more than 1- week, chronic 
anaemia, or unexplained weight loss.  
All elements of the diagnostic work -up pertinent to the Investigator diagnosis of GCA  should be reviewed 
with the CRO -designated Medical Expert and entered into the eCRF promptly.  
12.2.2  TAB 
New-onset subjects can have an optional temporal artery biopsy taken at Screening and Week 26 as par t of 
the study. For relapsing/refractory patients, if the subject has not had a prior a temporal biopsy an optional biopsy can be done at Screening and Week 26. If the subject has an existing biopsy sample available this can be submitted as the screening/p redose sample and an optional biopsy can be performed at Week 26. 
Temporal biopsy specimens if available will be submitted to the central laboratory.  
Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals Lt d.  30 March 2020  
KPL -301-C001 (v 4.0)  Final  Page 47 of 101 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  12.2.3  Imaging (MRI, CT, PET, or Ultrasound)  
Evidence of large -vessel vasculitis by angiography or cross -sectional imaging study such as MRI, 
CT/CTA, or PET- CT of the aorta or other great vessels should be performed according the schedule of 
activities  (Table 1). 
In cases where ultrasound of temporal artery was captured during the diagnosis  of GCA at Screening, this 
procedure should be repeated at Weeks 12, 26, EOT  and Week 38  as well as any instances of suspected 
flare over the course of the study.   Imaging and relevant data should be included in any elements of the 
diagnostic work- up perti nent to the Investigator diagnosis of GCA.  
12.2.4  CRP and ESR  
Central laboratory assessments of CRP and local assessment of ESR will be performed at each study visit. 
Centrally determined laboratory values will be used for statistical evaluations and report writing. CRP changes and the time course to decrease and resolve CRP to normal values ≤  0.5 mg/dL will be assessed.  
If necessary local CRP  tests can be used by the site to support the Investigator’s clinical decisions 
regarding the GCA status.  
12.3 Physical Examination and Vitals  
12.3.1  Physical Exam  
A complete physical examination  as possible by local practice should include an evaluation of the head, 
eye, ear, nose, and throat as well as cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurological systems . Any abnormality identified at baseline should be 
recorded on the Medical History and Physical Examination eCRFs.  
At subsequent visits, limited symptom -directed physical examinations may need to be performed in order 
to determine changes from baseline abnormalities and should be recorded in the subject ’s trial notes . New 
or worsened abnormalities should be recorded a s AEs on the Adverse Event CRF.  
12.3.2  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of respiratory rate, pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure , 
and temperature. Blood pressure measurements should be obtained after the subject has been seated for at 
least 5 minutes.  
12.3.3  Body Weight and Height  
Body weight and height will be measured as per SoC at the study site and will be recorded in the eCRF.  
12.4 Electrocardiogram 
Twelve- lead ECGs will be performed at Screening  at the study site and may be performed at an 
unscheduled visit if determined necessary by the I nvestigator during the treatment period . To minimize 
variability, ECGs should be performed prior to meals and any scheduled vital sign measurements and blood draws . Subjects should be in a resting position for ≥ 10 minutes prior to ECG and body position 
should be consistently maintained  and environmental distractions (e.g. , TV, radio) should be avoided to 
prevent chan ges in heart rate during recording.  
The digital ECG recording must be obtained  and reviewed by the Investigator or designee . For safety 
monitoring purposes, the Investigator or designee must sign and date all ECG tracings a nd place the paper 
Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals Lt d.  30 March 2020  
KPL -301-C001 (v 4.0)  Final  Page 48 of 101 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  copy as part of the subject’s permanent study file at the site and overall ECG interpretation will be 
documented in eCRF.  
12.5 Respiratory Evaluations  
12.5.1  PFTs  and DLCO  
PFTs and DLCO should be obtained at Screening  within 6 weeks prior to Day 0, or existing 
documentation within 12 weeks of day 0 can be used and reviewed by the Investigator or designee . During 
the course of the study PFTs and  DLCO should be obtained at W eeks 12 , 26 and 38 with a window of 
± 14 days .  
12.5.2  Chest X -Ray 
Chest X -rays in accordance with local requirements should be obtained at Screening (or existing chest 
X-ray within 12 weeks of Day 0 can be used) and reviewed by the Investigator or designee. X -rays should 
be reviewed to show no clinically significant abnormality and no signs or symptoms suggestive of 
pulmonary disease that would exclude the potential subject.  
12.5.3  TB Screening  
Eligibility will be determined based on a central QuantiFERON TB test performed during screening in 
order to evaluate (active, untreated, or partially treated latent) infecti on with TB.  
If a patient is suspected to have contracted tuberculosis during the study the study site may conduct a TB test in accordance with the site’s normal practice to diagnose TB (PPD or local QuantiFERON).  
12.5.4  Dyspnea Score and O 2 Saturation 
The modifi ed Borg scale ( Borg  and Borg, 2010) is a validated patient reported outcome and will be used 
to assess subjects’ perceived sensation of difficulty in breathing (dyspnea)  while resting . This scale is a 
linear scale of numbers ranking the magnitude of difficulty in breathing, ranging from 0 (nothing at all) to 10 (maximal) . A validated version  of the Borg scale in local language will be  provided. 
Oxygen saturation will be assessed as part of respiratory system assessment. Pulse oximetry must be performe d before PFT s and should be done with the subject in a seated position after a 10- minute period 
of rest . It is important that the pulse oximetry be performed in the same center throughout the study since 
oximetry readings vary with changes in altitude .  
12.6 Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory assessments should be collected as per the schedule of activities  (Table 1). Unscheduled 
laboratory assessments for safety issues are permitted as deemed necessary by the Investigator . The 
procedures for the collection, handling, and ship ment  of laboratory samples are specified in the 
Laboratory Manual supplied to sites by the central laboratory.  
Local laboratory tests and values may be used by the Investigator as necessary to support clini cal 
decisions but will not be captured as part of the study for analysis.  
12.6.1  Serology 
Rheumatoid factor, protein electrophoresis , HbsAg, HbsAb, HbcAb  and HCVAb : collected at Screening

CONFIDENTIAL  13 Safety Assessments  
13.1 Adverse Events  
13.1.1   Adverse Event Definition  
An AE  is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product . An AE  does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment . An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  

Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals Lt d.  30 March 2020  
KPL -301-C001 (v 4.0)  Final  Page 51 of 101 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  AEs also include: any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant change in frequency and/or intensity) of a 
pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the us e of the study drug; abnormal laboratory 
findings considered by the reporting Investigator to be clinically significant; and any untoward medical 
occurrence.  
13.1.2  Management of Specific Disease Related Events  
Signs, symptoms and abnormal findings associated with active GCA should not be captured as Adverse Events in this study but rather as flare  related  efficacy endpoint findings . If there are questions regarding 
how to classify these events, Investigators should consult with the CRO -designated Medical Expert.  
13.1.3  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to understanding of the Investigational Product and requires close monitoring and rapid communication by 
the investigator to the sponsor. An AESI may be serious or non- serious. The rapid reporting of AESIs 
allows ongoing analysis of these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with 
the use of this investigational product.  
13.1.3.1  Hepatic Function Abnormality  
Adverse events of hepatic function abnormality of special interest to the sponsor are defined as any increase in ALT or AST to greater than 3 × ULN and concurrent increase in bilirubin to greater than 2 × ULN. Concurrent findings are those that derive from a single blood draw or from separate blood draws 
taken within 8 days of each other. In the event of hepatic function abnormality where the etiology is 
unknown, timely follow -up investigations and inquiries should be initiated by the investiga tional site, 
based on medical judgment, to make an informed decision regarding the etiology of the event. Investigational product will not be administered to any subject reporting ALT or AST to greater than 3 × ULN and concurrent increase in bilirubin to greater than 2 × ULN  
13.1.3.2  Acute and Delayed Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Biologic therapies are known to be associated with an increased risk of immediate and delayed 
hypersensiti
vity reactions as well as anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions are 
required to be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event ,  
  
13.1.3.3  Clinic
ally Significant Pulmonary Abnormality  
Any subject who develops new clinically significant pulmonary symptoms or signs should be referred to a 
qualified specialist  for further specific assessment. Symptoms and signs triggering such referral include 
but are not limited to an increase in shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, exacerbation of current 
respiratory symptoms, or a significant deterioration in dyspnea score. Subjects who are referred for 
evaluation by a specialist  will undergo a diagnostic evaluation to determine the nature and origin of the 
pulmonary symptom(s)/sign(s) and to determine if PAP may be present. At  the discretion of the 
investigator or specialist additional tests may  be require d such as  a repeat chest x -ray, and/or a chest high 
resolution computed tomography scan, full PFTs including DLCO measurement, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, and cytological and/or ultrastructural evaluation of the cells recovered by lavage 
to identify findings consistent with a diagnosis of PAP.  Any s ubject who has been referred for a specialist 
pulmonary evaluation may be instructed to stop the investigational pro duct until the symptom(s) or sign(s) 
causing the referral have resolved.

CONFIDENTIAL  13.1.3.4  Neutropenia  
Adverse events of neutropenia of special interest to the sponsor are defined as an ANC < 1.0 × 109 
cells/L. Investigational product will not be administered to any subject who has an ANC < 1.0 × 109 
cells/L. Administration of investigational product may continue in the event that the ANC > 1.5 × 109 
cells/L and following agreement with the medical monitor.  
13.1.3.5  Serious Infection  
Grade 3 severity infections that require treatm ent with IV therapy (antibiotics, antiviral, or antifungal) and 
opportunistic infections will be considered serious even if they do not require in- patient hospitalization. 
Every effort should be made to identify the causative pathogen through prompt and appropriate investigation by the investigator or reporting physician.  
13.1.4  Adverse Reactions  
All noxious and unintended responses to an IMP ( i.e., where a causal relationship between an IMP and an 
AE is at least a reasonable possibility) related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions .  
13.1.5   Unexpected Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the current 
Investigator Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observe d. “Unexpected ” 
also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the Investigator Brochure as 
occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
13.1.6   Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that, at any dose:  
• Results in death – Includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated to study 
drug (e.g., car accident where subject is a passenger)  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the Investigator, the subject was at immediate risk of death 
from the event at the time of the event ( i.e., it does not include an AE that might have caused 
death if it had occurred in a more serious form).  
• Requires in-patient hospitalizatio n or prolongs an existing hospitalization. (C omplications 
occurring during hospitalization are AEs and are SAEs if they cause prolongation of the current hospitalization . Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing non- worsening condition is 
not, however, considered an AE . The details of such hospitalizations must be recorded on the 
medical history or physical examination page of the eCRF . Hospitalization is defined as an 
admission to the hospital ward or a short -stay-type unit longer than 24 hours . Prolongation of 
existing hospitalization is defined as hospital stay longer than originally anticipated for the event or development of a new AE as determined by the Investigator or treating physician.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity  (an AE is incapacitating or disabling if it 
results in a substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions). 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event  – Important medica l events may not be immediately life -threatening 
or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to 
Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals Lt d.  30 March 2020  
KPL -301-C001 (v 4.0)  Final  Page 53 of 101 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (e.g., intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
In addition, medical and scientific judgment is required to decide if prompt notification is required  in 
situations other than those defined for SAEs above, i.e., any event that the Investigator regards as serious that did not strictly meet the criteria above but may have jeopardized the subject or required intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or that would suggest any significant hazard, 
contraindication, side effect , or precaution that may be associated with the use of the IMP.  
All SAEs that occur after signing of study- related informed consent, whether or not the SAEs are related 
to the study drug or study procedures, must be reported.  
13.1.7  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction is an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which 
is not  consistent with the applicable product information (e.g.  investigator’s brochure for an unauthori zed 
investigational product or prescribing information/ summary of product characteristics for an  authoriz ed 
product ). All relevant information  about suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions  that are fatal or 
life-threatening will be  recorded and reported to the competent authorities in all the  applicable countries , 
and to the Ethics Committee /Institutional Review Boards  in conjunction with Directive 2001/20/EC .  
13.2 Adverse Event Assessment  
13.2.1  Relationship to Study Drug  
The causal relationship between an AE and the study drug  will be defined as below: 
• Not Related : when the AE is definitely caused by the subject’s clinical state, or the study 
procedure/conditions 
• Unlikely Related : when the temporal association between the AE and the drug is such that the 
drug is not likely to have any reasonable association with the AE  
• Possibly Related : when the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration but could have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or the study procedures/conditions 
• Related : when the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug, 
abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known or hypothesized cause -effect 
relationship, and (if appropriate) reappears when the drug is reintroduced.  
13.2.2  Intensity  
The severity of an AE will be recorded as one of the following:  
• Mild : easily tolerated, does not interfere with normal daily activities, does not require intervention  
• Moderat e: causes some interference with daily activities; minimal, local, or noninvasive 
intervention indicated  
• Severe: medically significant event; daily activities limited or completely halted; hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization indicated 
Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals Lt d.  30 March 2020  
KPL -301-C001 (v 4.0)  Final  Page 54 of 101 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Every  reasonable effort will be made to follow subjects who have AEs . Any subject who has an ongoing 
AE at study end or early withdrawal  will be followed, where possible, until resolution.  
13.3 Recording Adverse Events  
Each patient should be monitored for the development of any AEs. This information should be collected 
by asking nonleading questions (such as “How are you feeling?”) and from observations of and 
conversations with patients. AEs may also be collected by direct physical exam, diagnostic procedures, or 
any other appropriate source.  
All AEs (serious and non -serious ) will be documented in the patient’s source documents and recorded in 
the eCRF. Any clinically relevant (as determined by the Investigator) deterioration in laboratory 
assessments or other clinic al findings is considered an AE and must be recorded in the patient’s source 
documents and in the eCRF.  
13.3.1  Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms  
All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient or reported in response to the open question from the study 
personnel or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF. When collecting AEs, the recording of a diagnosis is preferred (when possible) to the recording of a list of signs and symptoms. 
However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the 
diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.  
13.3.1  Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests  
If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible the reporting Investigator uses the clinical rather than the 
laboratory term (e.g. , anemia vs low hemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, 
clinically relevant deteriorations in nonmandated parameters should be reported as AEs.  
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as 
compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.  
13.4 Time Period for Collection of Adverse Events  
AEs will be c ollected from the time of signing of i nformed consent through the Final Washout Safety 
Follow- up period (84 days ± 3 days after the EOT vis it). The AE term should be reported in standard 
medical terminology when possible. Also,  when possible, signs and sym ptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. For each AE, the Investigator will 
evaluate and report the onset, resolution, intensity, causality, action taken, seriousness, outcome (if 
applicable), and whether o r not it caused the patient to discontinue the study.  Reported AEs between 
consent and Day 0 will be censored in analysis.  
13.5 Follow- Up of Unresolved Adverse Events  
Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s follow -up visit are to be followed up by the Investigator for 
as long as medically indicated. Additional information for any patient with an ongoing AE at the end of the follow -up period may be requested by the Sponsor, as needed.  
13.6 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs, whether or not considered causally related to study drug or to the study procedure(s), have to be reported. SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF  within 24 hours of discovery.

soon as it is available.  
Investigators must report SAEs and follow -up information to their responsible Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) or Independent Ethics Commit tee (I EC) as applicable per institutional policy.  
The Sponsor or designee will provide regulatory a uthorities, IRBs, I ECs, and principal investigators with 
clinical safety updates/reports according to local requirements.  
13.7  Pregnancy 
Subjects will be instruc ted that known or suspected pregnancy occurring during the study should be 
confirmed and reported to the Investigator without delay. If pregnancy is confirmed, the Investigator must 
notify the Sponsor within 24 hours and the subject must not receive (addit ional) study drug and must be 
discharged from the study . The subject must be asked regarding their willingness to complete the EOT  
visit.  
In the event that a subject is found to be pregnant after having received at least one study drug dose, the 
pregnancy will be followed to term and the status of mother and child will be reported to the Sponsor after 
delivery.  
Instances of perinatal death or congenital abnormality, if brought to the attention of the Investigator at any 
time after cessation of the study treatment, will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours.  
14 Statis tical M ethods 
14.1 General Considerations

CONFIDENTIAL  14.5.1  Primary Efficacy  Endpoint  Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint is time to flare by W eek 26  defined as time from randomization to the first 
flare occurring with in the treatment period .  Detailed censoring rules will be provided in the SAP.  
The number and percentage of subjects who remain i n remission  (no flare), who flare, and who are lost to 
follow- up prior to a flare during the treatment period will be summarized for each treatment group.  Time 
to flare by week 26  will be summarized by the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles calculated using 
the Kaplan -Meier method to estimate the survival functions for each treatment group. The 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for the percentiles will also be calculated. A log -rank test stratified by randomization strata  
will be used to compare KPL -301 and placebo with respect to time to flare  by Week 26.  To describe the 
magnitude of treatment effect, the hazard ratio for KPL -301 compared to placebo and the corresponding 
95% CI will be calculated based on a Cox proportional -hazards model with treatment as  a covariate and 
stratified by randomization strata .  
The protocol definition of flare includes multiple components.  Supportive analyses will be performed 
based on each individual component.  The details will be described in the SAP.  In addition,  a sensitivity 
analysis will be performed using the same method described above for the PP analysis set.  
14.5.2   Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
Sustained remission rate at Week 26 will be estimated and compared using the  Kaplan -Meier method.  
The following endpoints will be analyzed using the Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by the 
randomiz ation strata.  
• Percentage of subjects who have completed the corticosteroid taper and who have a  normal ESR  
by Week  26  
• Percentage of subjects who have com pleted the corticosteroid taper and who have a  normal CRP  
by Week  26 
• Percentage of subjects who have completed the corticosteroid taper and who have no 
signs/symptoms of GCA  or new or worsening vasculitis by imaging  by Week 26  
The following time -to-event endpoints will be analyzed using the same method for the primary efficacy 
endpoint. 
• Time to elevated ESR  by Week 26  
• Time to elevated CRP by Week 26  
• Time to signs/symptoms of GCA  or new or worsening vasculitis by imaging  by Week 26  
The following continuous  secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed. The analyses will include two -
sided 95% CIs for the difference of treatment means, as appropriate.  Details will be provided in the SAP .

CONFIDENTIAL  20.3 Appendix 3: Summary  of Changes  
20.3.1  Protocol Amendment v2.0  
Rationale for Amendment – Protocol Amendment v2.0 was completed to clarify aspects of protocol 
version 1.0 as well as to incorporate feedback from global Regulatory and Ethical bodies.  Substantial 
changes to this version include:  
• Limiting the double -blind period to 26- weeks  total, removing the extended exposure for patients 
who enroll earlier in the study.  
• Removal of the Open- Label Extension – Per Regulatory feedback, open- label KPL -301 should 
only be provided to patients after proof of efficacy has been established 
• Addition of 12- week Washout Safety Fol low-up period to ensure patients have continued access 
to open- label study supplied prednisone and are adequately followed and weaned back to Standard 
of Care  
• Updated inclusion criteria regarding pregnancy and contraception methods to ensure highly 
effecti ve methods of contraception are reflected  
• Provided clarification on sample size and event calculations  
• Addition of Serum Pregnancy test during screening, additional urine pregnancy tests, safety labs, 
 
• Addition of Definition of SUSAR and defined Study Termination criteria  
Please see the below summary of changes for more details on the changes incorporated into this version.

Section 11.3 (pg 46)  Open -Label Extension:  
Depending on the results from the analysis of the 26-week placebo -
controlled base study, all subjects may be offered KPL -301 in an OLE. 
The OLE will continue for up to 6 months. During the OLE, subjects will 
be followed for safety information and will continue to follow study 
protocols from the double -blind period in the event of a flare and for 
steroid tapering procedures. During the OLE subjects may wean off 
KPL -301 onto SoC as determined by the Investigator.  Washout Safety Follow -up: 
After subjects compl ete the 26 -week double blind treatment period, 
they will discontinue and wash off of blinded KPL -301 or placebo 
during a 12 -week Washout Safety Follow -up Period, which includes 
close safety follow -up and monitoring for potential GCA flares .  
During this ti me, it is recommended that subjects, regardless of 
remission status, receive SoC oral prednisone therapy, taking into 
consideration that they have just completed treatment with what 
may have been an efficacious therapy which supported the tapering off of s tandard of care concomitant oral corticosteroids.  Clinicians 
may choose to observe subjects closely during the washout period without any change in concomitant medications or may choose 
(consistent with current SoC guidelines) to increase the daily Removed open label 
extension per Regulatory 
Agency feedback and

and Mode of Administration  
Synopsis (pg 12) 
 Cases of GCA flare should be treated according to the Investigator’s 
judgment and SoC to ensure the best possible care of the subject. In 
general, the subject should continue to receive the assigned KPL -301 or 
placebo and should also receive an increased dose of coadministered 
prednisone, as determined by the Investigator, generally of up to 60 
mg/day. The dosages of all concomitant medications used to treat the 
GCA flare must be documented. If a flare, particularly a major flare, 
should require a dose of corticosteroid higher than prednisone 60 mg/day, 
in the judgment of the Investigator, steroid escape therapy is allowed 
(i.e., doses of prednisone > 60 mg/day, or equivalent, or IV 
corticosteroids) until clinical remission is achieved.  
If the clinical respo nse is positive, after an appropriate period of clinical 
stabilization, as determined by the Investigator, (usually 1-2 weeks) the 
subject may resume the protocol -defined steroid taper, starting at the 
dose at which remission was achieved or prednisone 60 mg/day, 
whichever is lower.  
Any subject who cannot adhere to the protocol -defined steroid taper due 
to flare/relapse will be allowed to receive a more gradual Investigator -
defined steroid taper and will continue to receive the assigned KPL -301 
or placebo.

The primary objective of this POC study is to evaluate the efficacy of 
KPL -301 versus placebo, coadministered with a 26 week steroid taper, 
for maintaining sustained remission for 26 weeks in subjects with new -
onset or relapsing/refractory GCA. Sustained remission is defined as the 
absence of flare (as defined above) from the start of double -blind 
treatment through Week 26.  The primary efficacy analysis variable  is 
time from start of double -blind treatment until the first flare occurring Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint  is time to flare by Week 26 defined as 
time from randomization  to the date of  first flare occurring within the 
26-week period. Subjects who do not experience a flare during this 
period will be censored at the Week 26 visit. Subjects who drop out or are lost to follow -up prior to experiencing a flare during the 26-week 
double -blind period will be censored at the time of their last available 
visit.  Text changed to provide

Synopsis (pg 15) 
Section 14.2 (pg 57 ,58) Sample Size Estimation  
With 36 subjects randomized to KPL -301 and 24 subjects randomized to 
placebo, a two -sided log-rank test for equality of survival curves with a 
0.05 significance level will have approximately 89% power to detect a 
37.5% difference (20% placebo vs 57.5% KPL -301) in the proportion of 
subjects who experience sustained remission during the 26-week 
double -blind base period.  
It is expected that the trial will have equal numbers of subjects in the two 
randomization strata. Assuming that the percentage of subjects 
experiencing sustained remission in the new onset stratum is 70% for 
KPL -301 and 30% for placebo. The percentage of subjects experiencing 
sustained remission in the relapsing/refractory stratum is 45% for KPL -
301 and 10% for placebo. A two-sided log -rank te st with 0.1 significance 
level will have 75% power to detect a treatment difference within the 
stratum.    Sample Size Estimation  
Assuming that time to flare follows an exponential distribution and 
the proportion of subjects without a flare by Week 26 will be 20% in placebo and 57 5% in KPL -301, the median time to flare would 
be estimated to be approximately 11.20 weeks in placebo and 32.57 
weeks in KPL -301.  The hazard ratio (KPL -301 vs. placebo) would 
be estimated to be approximately 0.3438.  With a 2-side d 
significance level of 0.05 and a 3:2 randomization ratio for KPL -301 
vs. placebo, it would require approximately 34 events to achieve 
86% power using a two- sided log rank test.   
Approximately 60 subjects will be randomized by disease stratum (new -onset  or relapsing/refractory) to receive KPL -301 or placebo 
at a 3:2 allocation ratio.  
Subject disposition and the flare event accrual will be closely monitored during the study. The monitoring activities will be done in a blinded fashion. If there is a high dropout rate and/or the event 
accrual rate is significantly slower than anticipated, up to 10 
additional subjects may be randomized to obtain the target number of events required for the analysis of primary efficacy endpoint.

3 Synopsis (pg 7)  
Section 8.4.1 (pg 32) Cases of  flare should be treated according to the Investigator’s judgment 
and standard of care (SoC)  to ensure the best possible care of the subject. 
In general : 
• The subject should continue to receive the assigned KPL -301 or 
placebo and should also receive an increased dose of 
coadministered prednisone, as determined by the Investigator, 
generally of up to 60 mg/day. The dosages of all concomitant 
medications used to treat the GCA flare must be entered into the 
eCRF. 
• If a flare, particularly a major flare, should require a dose of 
corticosteroid higher than prednisone 60 mg/day, in the judgment 
of the Investigator, steroid escape therapy is allowed (i.e., doses 
of prednisone > 60 mg/day or equivalent, or intravenous (IV) 
corticosteroids) until clinical remission is achieved.  If the 
clinical response is positive, after an appropriate period of 
clinical stabilization, as determined by the Investigator, the 
subject may resume the protocol -defined st eroid taper, starting at 
the dose at which remission was achieved or prednisone 60 
mg/day, whichever is lower.  Any subject who cannot adhere to 
the protocol -defined steroid taper due to flare/relapse will be 
allowed to receive a more gradual Investigator -defined steroid 
taper and will continue to receive the assigned KPL -301 or 
placebo. These subjects will be considered to have met the 
primary endpoint if a flare has occurred prior to Week 26.  Subjects who experience a  flare or subjects who cannot adhere to 
the protocol -defined steroid taper due to a flare should be managed  
to ensure the best possible care of the subject:  
• The subject must dis continue the assigned study drug ( KPL -
301 or placebo) and should receive escape therapy in 
accordance with local SoC , as determined by the Investigator, 
which may include, for example, dose modifications of 
corticosteroids, other immunomodula tory agents, and/or 
approved therapies (e.g., tocilizumab) . The dosages of all 
concomitant medications used to treat the GCA flare  must be 
entered into the eCRF.  
• Escape corticosteroid therapy can be escalated immediately.  Due to possible safety and pharmacologic effects resulting from overlapping exposures to immunomodulatory agents on top of co-administered corticosteroids, the inv estigator 
should consider a washout period of at least 35 days (based on elimination half -lives) after the last dose of study drug if 
deemed clinically appropriate.  Text updated per regulatory

Per Protocol Analysis Set  
All mITT subjects without protocol deviations deemed to impact efficacy or ethical conduct will be included in the per -protocol (PP) set.  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is time to flare by Week 26 defined as time from randomization to the date of  first flare occurring within the 26-week  
period.  Subjects who do not experience a flare during this period  will be 
censored at  the Week 26 visit. Subjects who drop out or are lost to follow -
up prior to experiencing a flare during the 26-week double -blind period will 
be censored at the time of their last available visit.  
The number and percentage of subjects who remain in remission (no flare), who flare, and who are lost to follow -up prior to a flare during the  26-week 
double -blind period will be summarized for each treatment group. Time to 
flare by Week 26 will be summarized by the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th 
percentiles calculated using the Kaplan -Meier method to estimate the 
survival functions for each treatment group. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the percentiles will also be calculated. A log -rank test stratified by 
randomization strata will be  used to compare KPL -301 and placebo with 
respect to time to flare by Week 26. Kaplan -Meier estimates of remission 
rate at 26 weeks will be presented with the corresponding 95% CI by 
treatment group. To describe the magnitude of treatment effect, the hazar d 
ratio for KPL -301 compared to placebo and the corresponding 95% CI will 
be calculated based on a Cox proportional -hazards model with treatment as 
covariate.  
As a key secondary efficacy endpoint, time to flare by week 26 in the per 
protocol population will be analyzed using the same methods described 
above. Subjects who do not experience flare during double -blind treatment 
will be censored at their last visit of the double -blind treatment period. 
Subjects who drop out or are lost to follow -up prior to expe riencing a flare 
at any time during double -blind treatment will be censored at the time of 
their last available visit.  
Additional secondary efficacy endpoints include the following endpoints 
that will be analyzed. Treatment comparisons will be performed using 
Cochran-Mantel -Haenszel test controlling for the randomized stratum.  
• Percentage of subjects who have completed the 26-week  
corticosteroid taper and who have a normal ESR

11 Section 14.1.2 14.1.2 Multiple Comparisons /Mul tiplicity  
Multiplicity with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint and the key 
secondary efficacy endpoints will be managed via the gated  hierarchical 
testing procedure.  If and only if the primary comparison results in a 
statistically significant difference between KPL -301 and placebo at 0.05 
level of significance, the key secondary comparison will be conducted at 
alpha 0.05 as well.    
All other secondary endpoints are considered exploratory, and no 
adjustment for multiple testing of secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
performed. 
 14 1 2 Multipl icity Adjustment  
Multiplicity adjustment with respect to the primary efficacy and secondary 
efficacy endpoints will be performed using  the gate-keeping  hierarchical 
testing procedure. The order of the secondary endpoints will be described in the SAP. For each endpoint, the null hypothesis is that there is no treatment  difference between KPL -301 and placebo. The alter native 
hypothesis is that KPL -301 is superior to placebo.  For each test, the 2 -
sided Type I error rate is 0.05.  The primary endpoint will be tested first.  If the 2 -sided p-value is ≤0.05 and the test statistic shows KPL -301 
is superior than placebo, sta tistical significance of the primary endpoint 
will be claimed, and the next hierarchical endpoint will be tested.  This process will continue until an endpoint is not statistically significant.     Clarified language in response to request from the FDA.  
12 Section 14.2 Approximately 60 subjects will be randomized 3:2 by disease stratum (new -
onset or relapsing/refractory) to receive KPL -301 or placebo.  
Assuming that time to flare follows an exponential distribution and the proportion of subjects without a flare by week 26 will be 20% in placebo 
and 57.5% in KPL -301, the median time to flare would be estimated to be  
approximately 11.20 weeks in placebo and 32.57 weeks in KPL -301.  The 
hazard ratio (KPL -301 vs. placebo) would be estimated to be  approximately 
0.3438.  With a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05 and a 3:2 randomization 
ratio for KPL -301 vs. placebo, it would require approximately 34  events to 
achieve 86% power using a two- sided log rank test.  
Approximately 60 subjects will be randomized by disease stratum (new -

in plac ebo and 111 weeks in KPL -301 arm.  The hazard ratio (KPL -301 vs.

and eligible subjects will be stratified for randomized study treatment into two cohorts according to 
whether subjects have new -onset disease or relapsing/refractory (hereafter, “relapsing” for brevity) 
disease. 
• New-onset  - The new -onset disease cohort includes subjects who have been diagnosed within  
6 weeks of Day 0  using the above Acute Phase Reactant s, Signs/Symptoms and Diagnostic 
Criteria . 
• Relapsing/refractory  – (either or)  
o The relapsing disease  cohort includes subjects having prior documented diagnos is of GCA  as 
per Diagnostic C riteria above > 6 weeks before Day 0  and who have active GCA disease 
defined  by Acute Phase Reactant s and Signs/Symptoms  within 6 weeks of Day 0 .  
o The refractory nonremitting  disease subject has  had no remission since the diagnosis of 
disease as per clinical expectations . Thus, the subject has documentation of prior diagnosis of 
GCA as per Diagnostic criteria above > 6 weeks before Day 0 ; however, presence of Acute 
Phase Reactant s and Signs/Symptoms as per above persist s within 6 weeks of Day 0 . 
Subjects who complete screening procedures and are not considered eligible ( screen failures ) may be 
rescreened one time provided there is reason to believe that eligibility criteria will be met.  
Base Treatment Period:  
Stratified eligible subjects will enter the double -blind treatment period after randomization 3:2 to blinded 
treatment with KPL -301 150 mg or placebo adminis tered subcutaneously (SC) every other week (every 
2 weeks) . All subjects will also receive an unblinded 26- week oral prednisone taper according to a 
standardized tapering protocol.  
Prior to first administration of KPL -301 or placebo , all subjects are requ ired to have achieved remission  
(i.e., resolution of GCA symptom(s) and CRP < 1.0 mg/dL or ESR  < 20 mm in the first hour). Should a 
subject in screening not achieve remission within the initial screening period they can be rescreened using 
their prior flare documentation following the relapsing/refractory non- remitting inclusion criteria.  
The first administration of SC KPL -301/placebo and oral prednisone taper will take place at the study site 
on Day 0. Subsequent doses of KPL -301/placebo will be administered at the study site in conjunction with 
a scheduled study visit or administered by the subject  on an outpatient basis in accordance with  the dosing 
schedule . The oral steroid taper will be self -administered by study subjects on a daily basis.  
Subjects will be followed at the study site at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and approximately every 4 weeks thereafter 
(see Table 1). Subjects reporting worsening of GCA symptoms or any safety issues may be  brought in for 
an unscheduled visit at the study site at any time .

CONFIDENTIAL  If a flare/relapse is suspected  during the treatment period , the I nvestigator must consult the Contract 
Research Organization ( CRO )-designated Medical Expert to review and harmonize the elements of the 
diagnostic work-up. Flare/relapse is defined as a re -increase of CRP from normal to 1  mg/dL or greater 
and/or of ESR from less than 20 mm in the first hour to 30  mm or greater AND at least one of the 
following signs or symptoms attributed by the Investigator to new, worsening, or recurrent GCA : 
• Cranial symptoms  
o New or recurrent headache or pain or tenderness of the scalp or the temporal artery  
o Visual signs/symptoms such as ischemic retinopathy, optic neuropathy, diplopia, amauros is 
fugax, etc.  
o New or recurrent claudication of the tongue, masseter muscle, or worsening temporal artery 
signs and symptoms   
o Transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke related to GCA in the opinion of the Investigator  
• Extracranial symptoms 
o Classic PMR -like symptoms, defined as shoulder and/or hip girdle pain associated with 
inflammatory morning stiffness  
o New or recurrent claudication in the peripheral circulation (i.e., in one of the extremities)  
• New or worsening angiographic abnormalities detected via MRI, CT /CTA, or PET- CT of the 
aorta or other great vessels or via ultrasound of the temporal arteries   
Supportive findings could include other symptoms in the opinion of the I nvestigator related to w orsening 
GCA, such as sustained daily recurrent fever with a temperature over 38°C for more than 1week, chronic 
anemia, or unexplained weight loss.  
Although either acute phase reactant (CRP or ESR) may be used during the study for eligibility and to 
determ ine remission or flares, it is advisable that the same acute phase reactant used to determine 
remission at screening also be used to determine flares during the treatment period. 
All elements of the diagnostic work -up pertinent to the Investigator diagnosi s of a flare/relapse (i.e., the 
primary efficacy  endpoint) should be reviewed with the CRO -designated Medical Expert and entered into 
the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF ) promptly .  
Flare/relapse is defined as major  if cranial symptoms or ischemia -related visual loss are present or if there 
is clear evidence of new onset large vessel vasculitis (e.g. , subclavian artery) . In all other situations , 
flare/relapse attributed to PMR, vascular or other symptoms should be re garded as minor .  
Subjects who experience a flare  or subjects who cannot adhere to the protocol -defined steroid taper due to 
a flare should be managed to ensure the best possible care of the subject : 
• The subject must dis continue the assigned study drug  (KPL-301 or placebo) and should receive 
escape therapy in accordance with local SoC , as determined by the Investigator, which may 
include, for example, dose modifications of corticosteroids, other immunomodula tory agents, 
and/or approved therapies (e.g., toci lizumab) . The dosages of all concomitant medications used to 
treat the GCA flare must be entered into the eCRF . 
• Escape corticosteroid therapy can be escalated immediately.  Due to possible safety and 
pharmacologic effects resulting from overlapping exposures to immunomodulatory agents on top 
of co -administered corticosteroids, the investigator should consider a washout period of at least 35

CONFIDENTIAL  days (based on elimination half -lives) after the last dose of study drug if deemed clinically 
appropriate. 
Any subject  who prematurely discontinues the study drug treatment for safety or other reason will have an 
End-of-T reatment (EOT) visit and will be followed for the intended duration of study treatment (i.e., 
through W eek 26 and Washout Safety Follow -up) to address potential issues of informative censoring. 
Any subject who withdraws consent from the trial (i.e., all study procedures in addition to study drug  
administration ) must complete at a minimum the F inal Washout  Safety Follow -up visit 8 4 ± 3 days from 
the last dose administered.   Additional follow up using public records may be captured where possible. 
Washout Safety Follow -up: 
After subjects complete the 26 -week double blind treatment period, they will discontinue and wash off of 
blinded KPL -301 or placebo during a 12- week Washout Period, which includes close safety follow -up and 
monitoring for potential GCA flares.  During this time, it is recommended that subjects, regardless of 
remission status, receive SoC oral prednisone therapy, taking into conside ration that they have just 
completed treatment with what may have been an efficacious therapy which supported the tapering off  of 
standard of care concomitant oral corticosteroids.  Clinicians may choose to observe subjects closely 
during the washout perio d without any change in concomitant medications or may choose (consistent with 
current SoC guidelines) to increase the daily corticosteroid dose prophylactically/empirically by 
approximately 10 mg above the prednisone dose administered at Week 26.  The prednisone dose can then 
be tapered , increased  or maintained throughout the remainder of the 12- week Washout Period as per 
Investigator discretion.  After the F inal Washout Safety Follow -up visit (Week 38) has been completed, 
the subjects will exit the trial and should be transitioned to SoC per investigator judgement.  It is not 
required that the steroid taper have been completed (0 mg) prior to subjects exiting the trial at Week 38.  
Number of Subjects:  
Approximately 70 subjects will be randomized at a 3:2 allocation ratio.   Approximately 42 subjects  will be  
assigned to KPL -301, and approximately 28 subjects will be assigned to placebo. Of the study population, 
the aim is to have 50% with new -onset disease and 50% with relapsing disease.

Test Products, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
Subjects will be permitted to have received steroids (prednisone or equivalent) prior to inclusion in the 
study.  
During the double -blind period, subjects will receive blinded KPL -301 150 mg or placebo, every 2 weeks, 
by SC inject ion, in addition to a protocol -specified oral  corticosteroid taper. 
Oral prednisone will be started at a dose between  20 mg/day to 60 mg/day (inclusive) at Day 0 depending 
on the subject’s previous cortico steroid treatment, disease status, and I nvestigator discretion. The 
prednisone dose will then be tapered over the subsequent 26 weeks in accordance with the following 
tapering  schedule shown in Table 3, with subjects entering the taper at different points, depending on their 
prednisone dose at Day 0.  
After subjects have completed the 26 -week double -blind treatment period, they will discontinue and wash 
off blinded KPL -301 or placebo during a 12- week Washout Period.  During the Washout Safety Follow -
up Period, patients may be closely observed with no addition al therapeutic or may receive prophylactic 
prednisone and tapered as per Investigator discretion.  After the F inal Washout Safety Follow -up visit 
84 ± 3 days from the EOT Visit has been completed , subjects will exit the trial and should be transition ed

daily), and IV  ibandronate 3 mg every 3 months, for the duration of the study.  
Duration of Treatment:  
Subjects will receive SC KPL -301 or placebo as well as coadministered study-supplied oral prednisone , 
which will be tapered over a period of up to 26 weeks, unless the subject experi ences a flare of GCA. 
Upon completion of the 26- week double -blind period subjects  will discontinue KPL -301 or placebo and 
enter  the 12- week Washout Safety Follow -up period in which they may receive  study -supplied oral 
prednisone per the Investigator ’s discretion.  Thus, the total study duration will be  up to approximately 38-
44 weeks (including 6- week Screening Period) . 
Efficacy Measures: 
• Clinical laboratory analyses (e.g. , CRP, ESR , signs/symptoms ) 
• Clinical GCA assessment s, including, signs/symptom(s) ,

Overview of Trial Design   
  
Statistical Methods:  
General Methods 
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® Version 9.4 or higher. All clinical study data will be 
presented in subject data listings. Descriptive statistics will  be presented for all endpoints and will include 
number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), first qu artile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), 
minimum and maximum for continuous variables, and frequency and  percentage for categorical and 
ordinal variables. The preliminary SAP is presented here, with the final SAP to be confirmed in a separate 
document (SAP) prior to study unblinding. 
Modified Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set 
All randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of KPL-301 or placebo and at least have 1 assessment 
in the double blind treatment period will be included in the mo dified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set. 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the mITT analysis set. All mITT analyses will be based on each 
subject’s randomized treatment assignment.  
Safety Analysis Set 
All randomized subjects who take at least 1 dose of KPL-301 or placebo will be included in the Safety 
Analysis Set. Safety analyses will be based on the medication t hat was actually administered to each 
subject. 
Per Protocol Analysis Set 

Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals Ltd.   30 March 2020  
KPL -301-C001 (v 4.0)  Final  Page 13 of 101 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  All mITT subjects without important protocol deviations deemed to impact efficacy  or ethical conduct  
will be included in the per -protocol ( PP) analysis set.  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
The primary efficacy  endpoint is time to flare by W eek 26 defined as time from randomization to the first 
flare occurring within the treatment period. Detailed censoring rules will be provided in the SAP.  
The number and percentage of subjects who remain in remission  (no flare), who flare, and who are lost to 
follow-up prior to a flare during the  treatment period will be summarized for each treatment group.  T ime 
to flare by W eek 26  will be summarized by the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles calculated using 
the Kaplan -Meier method to estimate the survival  functions for each treatment group. The 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for the percentiles will also be calculated. A log -rank test stratified by randomization strata  
will be used to compare KPL -301 and placebo with respect to time to flare  by W eek 26 .  To describe the 
magnitude of treatment effect, the hazard ratio for KPL -301 compared to placebo and the corresponding 
95% CI will be calculated based on a Cox proportional -hazards model with treatment as a covariate and 
stratified by the randomization strata .  
The protocol definition of flare includes multiple components. Supportive analyses will be performed 
based on each individual component.  The details will be described in the SAP.  In addition, a sensitivity 
analysis will be performe d using the same method described above for the per -protocol analysis set.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
Sustained remission rate at Week 26 will be estimated and compared using the  Kaplan -Meier method   
The following endpoints will be analysed using the Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test , stratified by  the 
randomized stratum : 
• Percentage of subjects who have completed the corticosteroid taper and who have a  normal ESR  
by Week 26  
• Percentage of subjects who have completed the corticosteroid taper and who have a  normal CRP  
by Week 26  
• Percentage of subjects who have completed the corticosteroid taper and who have no 
signs/symptoms of GCA  nor new or worsening vasculitis by imaging by Week 26  
The following time  to event endpoints w ill be analyzed using the same methods used for the primary 
efficacy endpoint : 
• Time to elevated ESR by Week 26  
• Time to elevated CRP by Week 26  
• Time to signs/symptoms of GCA or new or worsening vasculitis by imaging  by W eek 26  
The following continuous secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed. The analyses will include 
two-sided 95% CI s for the difference of treatment means, as appropriate. Details will be described in the 
SAP: 
• Cumulative steroid dose at Week 26 and at the end of the Wash out Safety Follow -up period

a. EOT visit must  be conducted in the event the  subject  permanently  discontinues KPL -301 or p lacebo . After the EOT visit, su bjects who discontinue treatment should continue attending their 
remaining scheduled visits for the duration of the study.  
b. In the event of an unscheduled visit, only the relevant assessments /activities  pertaining to the visit need to be captured. Subjects reporting worsening of GCA symptoms or any safety issues may be 
brought in for an unscheduled visit at the study clinic at any time . This visit can be combined with the EOT visit in which all necessary  EOT related  assessments/activities  should be completed.  
c. All subjects , including subjects who prematurely discontinue the study (i.e., withdraw consent) , must complete a t a minimum the F inal Safety Follow up visit 84 ± 3 days after the EOT Visit.   
Addition al follow up using public records may be captured if possible.  
d. At baseline , subject and/or caregiver should be trained on proper self -administration and handling and accountability of study drug. This training should be documented and can be repeated as 
necessary throughout the study.  
e. If a study site or clinic visit coincides with the subject’s scheduled dose, study treatment will be administered at the study site or c linic.   Study drug treatment should be dispensed as necessary to  the 
subject  for home administration to ensure dosing compliance.  Investigator staff may contact patients between visits to ensure compliance with protocol -specified treatment regimens.  
f. New-onset subjects can have an optional temporal artery biopsy taken at Screening  (or otherwise available from diagnostic workup) and Week 26 as part of the study. For relapsing/refractory 
patients, if the subject has not had a prior  a temporal biopsy an optional biopsy can be done at Screening and Week 26 . If the subject has an existing biopsy sample available  this can be submitted as 
the screening/predose  sample and an optional biopsy can be performed at W eek 26 .  
g. Chest X -ray (or high r es CT) , DLCO , and PFTs  should be obtained at S creening , or existing docu mentation  (if available)  within 12 weeks of D ay 0 can be used and reviewed by the Investigator or 
designee.  
h. PFTs and DLCO should be performed at  Screening  within  6 weeks prior to Day 0 (or documented report available  from PFT &/or DLCO from within 12 weeks prior to Day 0) . They should also be 
performed at  Weeks 12 and 26 and 38 with a window  of ±14 days . 
   
  
k. Subjects will be given prednisone as necessary and instructed to dose in alignment with their prednisone taper . Investigator staff may c ontact  patients between visits to ensure compliance with 
protocol specified treatment regimens . 
l. Clinical decisions for determination of inclusion and flare will be based upon  local laboratory values  either ES R and/ or CRP . 
m. The imaging technique used during screening to diagnose GCA  should be repeated at week 26 for the study.  If ultrasound is available at screening for diagnosis of GCA this should be conducted 
again at weeks 12, 26 and 38, or in case of a suspected flare of GCA with no other imaging (MRI, CT/CTA or PET -CT) required.  If MRI, CT/CTA or PET -CT was used at screening for diagnosis 
of GCA and no ultrasound is available, the same imaging technique used at screening  should be repeated at week 26 or  as neces sary for diagnosis  in case a suspected flare.  
n. Ultrasound imaging if clinically relevant should be performed at  or before  Day 0 to support clinical remission decision making unless there is no evidence of temporal artery inflammation and 
diagnosis of GCA is confined to large vessels (By MRI or CT) .

CONFIDENTIAL  20.3 Appendix 3: Summary  of Changes  
20.3.1  Protocol Amendment v2.0  
Rationale for Amendment – Protocol Amendment v2.0 was completed to clarify aspects of protocol 
version 1.0 as well as to incorporate feedback from global Regulatory and Ethical bodies.  Substantial 
changes to this version include:  
• Limiting the double -blind period to 26- weeks  total, removing the extended exposure for patients 
who enroll earlier in the study.  
• Removal of the Open- Label Extension – Per Regulatory feedback, open- label KPL -301 should 
only be provided to patients after proof of efficacy has been established 
• Addition of 12- week Washout Safety Fol low-up period to ensure patients have continued access 
to open- label study supplied prednisone and are adequately followed and weaned back to Standard 
of Care  
• Updated inclusion criteria regarding pregnancy and contraception methods to ensure highly 
effecti ve methods of contraception are reflected  
• Provided clarification on sample size and event calculations  
• Addition of Serum Pregnancy test during screening, additional urine pregnancy tests, safety labs, 
 
• Addition of Definition of SUSAR and defined Study Termination criteria  
Please see the below summary of changes for more details on the changes incorporated into this version.

An analysis of the study will be performed when the last subject reaches 
Week 26 according to the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Based on the 
results of this analysis, all subjects will be offered open-label KPL-301 in 
the OLE portion of the trial, or the study will be discontinued. All

Section 11.3 (pg 46)  Open -Label Extension:  
Depending on the results from the analysis of the 26-week placebo -
controlled base study, all subjects may be offered KPL -301 in an OLE. 
The OLE will continue for up to 6 months. During the OLE, subjects will 
be followed for safety information and will continue to follow study 
protocols from the double -blind period in the event of a flare and for 
steroid tapering procedures. During the OLE subjects may wean off 
KPL -301 onto SoC as determined by the Investigator.  Washout Safety Follow -up: 
After subjects compl ete the 26 -week double blind treatment period, 
they will discontinue and wash off of blinded KPL -301 or placebo 
during a 12 -week Washout Safety Follow -up Period, which includes 
close safety follow -up and monitoring for potential GCA flares .  
During this ti me, it is recommended that subjects, regardless of 
remission status, receive SoC oral prednisone therapy, taking into 
consideration that they have just completed treatment with what 
may have been an efficacious therapy which supported the tapering off of s tandard of care concomitant oral corticosteroids.  Clinicians 
may choose to observe subjects closely during the washout period without any change in concomitant medications or may choose 
(consistent with current SoC guidelines) to increase the daily Removed open label 
extension per Regulatory 
Agency feedback and

Synopsis (pg 12) 
 Cases of GCA flare should be treated according to the Investigator’s 
judgment and SoC to ensure the best possible care of the subject. In 
general, the subject should continue to receive the assigned KPL -301 or 
placebo and should also receive an increased dose of coadministered 
prednisone, as determined by the Investigator, generally of up to 60 
mg/day. The dosages of all concomitant medications used to treat the 
GCA flare must be documented. If a flare, particularly a major flare, 
should require a dose of corticosteroid higher than prednisone 60 mg/day, 
in the judgment of the Investigator, steroid escape therapy is allowed 
(i.e., doses of prednisone > 60 mg/day, or equivalent, or IV 
corticosteroids) until clinical remission is achieved.  
If the clinical respo nse is positive, after an appropriate period of clinical 
stabilization, as determined by the Investigator, (usually 1-2 weeks) the 
subject may resume the protocol -defined steroid taper, starting at the 
dose at which remission was achieved or prednisone 60 mg/day, 
whichever is lower.  
Any subject who cannot adhere to the protocol -defined steroid taper due 
to flare/relapse will be allowed to receive a more gradual Investigator -
defined steroid taper and will continue to receive the assigned KPL -301 
or placebo.

The primary objective of this POC study is to evaluate the efficacy of 
KPL -301 versus placebo, coadministered with a 26 week steroid taper, 
for maintaining sustained remission for 26 weeks in subjects with new -
onset or relapsing/refractory GCA. Sustained remission is defined as the 
absence of flare (as defined above) from the start of double -blind 
treatment through Week 26.  The primary efficacy analysis variable  is 
time from start of double -blind treatment until the first flare occurring Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint  is time to flare by Week 26 defined as 
time from randomization  to the date of  first flare occurring within the 
26-week period. Subjects who do not experience a flare during this 
period will be censored at the Week 26 visit. Subjects who drop out or are lost to follow -up prior to experiencing a flare during the 26-week 
double -blind period will be censored at the time of their last available 
visit.  Text changed to provide

Synopsis (pg 15) 
Section 14.2 (pg 57 ,58) Sample Size Estimation  
With 36 subjects randomized to KPL -301 and 24 subjects randomized to 
placebo, a two -sided log-rank test for equality of survival curves with a 
0.05 significance level will have approximately 89% power to detect a 
37.5% difference (20% placebo vs 57.5% KPL -301) in the proportion of 
subjects who experience sustained remission during the 26-week 
double -blind base period.  
It is expected that the trial will have equal numbers of subjects in the two 
randomization strata. Assuming that the percentage of subjects 
experiencing sustained remission in the new onset stratum is 70% for 
KPL -301 and 30% for placebo. The percentage of subjects experiencing 
sustained remission in the relapsing/refractory stratum is 45% for KPL -
301 and 10% for placebo. A two-sided log -rank te st with 0.1 significance 
level will have 75% power to detect a treatment difference within the 
stratum.    Sample Size Estimation  
Assuming that time to flare follows an exponential distribution and 
the proportion of subjects without a flare by Week 26 will be 20% in placebo and 57 5% in KPL -301, the median time to flare would 
be estimated to be approximately 11.20 weeks in placebo and 32.57 
weeks in KPL -301.  The hazard ratio (KPL -301 vs. placebo) would 
be estimated to be approximately 0.3438.  With a 2-side d 
significance level of 0.05 and a 3:2 randomization ratio for KPL -301 
vs. placebo, it would require approximately 34 events to achieve 
86% power using a two- sided log rank test.   
Approximately 60 subjects will be randomized by disease stratum (new -onset  or relapsing/refractory) to receive KPL -301 or placebo 
at a 3:2 allocation ratio.  
Subject disposition and the flare event accrual will be closely monitored during the study. The monitoring activities will be done in a blinded fashion. If there is a high dropout rate and/or the event 
accrual rate is significantly slower than anticipated, up to 10 
additional subjects may be randomized to obtain the target number of events required for the analysis of primary efficacy endpoint.

67 Section 14.1.2 (pg 57)  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of KPL -
301 versus placebo, in combination with steroid taper, for maintaining 
sustained remission for 26 weeks. The primary efficacy analysis entails 
the inferential comparison of KPL -301 to placebo with respect to time 
from start of double -blind treatment until the first flare occurring within 
the first 26 -weeks of the double -blind period. The key secondary efficacy 
analysis entails inferential comparison of KPL-301 to placebo with 
respect to time from start of double -blind treatment until the first flare 
anytime during the double -blind period.   
 
Multiplicity with respect to these two inferential efficacy analyses  will be 
managed via the gated hierarchical testing procedure.  If and only if the primary comparison results in a statistically significant difference between KPL -301 and placebo at 0.05 level of significance, the key 
secondary comparison may  be conducted at alpha 0.05 as well.   
 
All other secondary endpoints are considered explorato ry, and no 
adjustment for multiple testing of secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed. Multiplicity with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint and the key secondary efficacy endpoints  will be managed via the gated

3 Synopsis (pg 7)  
Section 8.4.1 (pg 32) Cases of  flare should be treated according to the Investigator’s judgment 
and standard of care (SoC)  to ensure the best possible care of the subject. 
In general : 
• The subject should continue to receive the assigned KPL -301 or 
placebo and should also receive an increased dose of 
coadministered prednisone, as determined by the Investigator, 
generally of up to 60 mg/day. The dosages of all concomitant 
medications used to treat the GCA flare must be entered into the 
eCRF. 
• If a flare, particularly a major flare, should require a dose of 
corticosteroid higher than prednisone 60 mg/day, in the judgment 
of the Investigator, steroid escape therapy is allowed (i.e., doses 
of prednisone > 60 mg/day or equivalent, or intravenous (IV) 
corticosteroids) until clinical remission is achieved.  If the 
clinical response is positive, after an appropriate period of 
clinical stabilization, as determined by the Investigator, the 
subject may resume the protocol -defined st eroid taper, starting at 
the dose at which remission was achieved or prednisone 60 
mg/day, whichever is lower.  Any subject who cannot adhere to 
the protocol -defined steroid taper due to flare/relapse will be 
allowed to receive a more gradual Investigator -defined steroid 
taper and will continue to receive the assigned KPL -301 or 
placebo. These subjects will be considered to have met the 
primary endpoint if a flare has occurred prior to Week 26.  Subjects who experience a  flare or subjects who cannot adhere to 
the protocol -defined steroid taper due to a flare should be managed  
to ensure the best possible care of the subject:  
• The subject must dis continue the assigned study drug ( KPL -
301 or placebo) and should receive escape therapy in 
accordance with local SoC , as determined by the Investigator, 
which may include, for example, dose modifications of 
corticosteroids, other immunomodula tory agents, and/or 
approved therapies (e.g., tocilizumab) . The dosages of all 
concomitant medications used to treat the GCA flare  must be 
entered into the eCRF.  
• Escape corticosteroid therapy can be escalated immediately.  Due to possible safety and pharmacologic effects resulting from overlapping exposures to immunomodulatory agents on top of co-administered corticosteroids, the inv estigator 
should consider a washout period of at least 35 days (based on elimination half -lives) after the last dose of study drug if 
deemed clinically appropriate.  Text updated per regulatory

Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is time to flare by Week 26 defined as time from randomization to the date of  first flare occurring within the 26-week  
period.  Subjects who do not experience a flare during this period  will be 
censored at  the Week 26 visit. Subjects who drop out or are lost to follow -
up prior to experiencing a flare during the 26-week double -blind period will 
be censored at the time of their last available visit.  
The number and percentage of subjects who remain in remission (no flare), who flare, and who are lost to follow -up prior to a flare during the  26-week 
double -blind period will be summarized for each treatment group. Time to 
flare by Week 26 will be summarized by the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th 
percentiles calculated using the Kaplan -Meier method to estimate the 
survival functions for each treatment group. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the percentiles will also be calculated. A log -rank test stratified by 
randomization strata will be  used to compare KPL -301 and placebo with 
respect to time to flare by Week 26. Kaplan -Meier estimates of remission 
rate at 26 weeks will be presented with the corresponding 95% CI by 
treatment group. To describe the magnitude of treatment effect, the hazar d 
ratio for KPL -301 compared to placebo and the corresponding 95% CI will 
be calculated based on a Cox proportional -hazards model with treatment as 
covariate.  
As a key secondary efficacy endpoint, time to flare by week 26 in the per 
protocol population will be analyzed using the same methods described 
above. Subjects who do not experience flare during double -blind treatment 
will be censored at their last visit of the double -blind treatment period. 
Subjects who drop out or are lost to follow -up prior to expe riencing a flare 
at any time during double -blind treatment will be censored at the time of 
their last available visit.  
Additional secondary efficacy endpoints include the following endpoints 
that will be analyzed. Treatment comparisons will be performed using 
Cochran-Mantel -Haenszel test controlling for the randomized stratum.  
• Percentage of subjects who have completed the 26-week  
corticosteroid taper and who have a normal ESR  
• Percentage of subjects who have completed the 26-week  
corticosteroid taper and who have a normal CRP by Week 26 Per Protocol Analysis Set  
All mITT subjects without important  protocol deviations deemed to impact 
efficacy or ethical conduct will be included in the per -protocol (PP) analysis  
set. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is time to flare by Week 26 defined as time from randomization to the first flare occurring within the treatment  period. 
Detailed censoring rules  will be provided in the SAP .  
The number and percentage of subjects who remain in remission (no flare), who flare, and who are lost to follow -
up prior to a flare during the 
treatment period will be summarized for each treatment group. Time to 
flare by Week 26 will be summarized by the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles calculated using the Kaplan -

survival functions for each treatment group. The 95% confidence interval 
(CI) for the percentiles will also be calculated. A log -rank test stratified by 
randomization strata will be used to compare KPL -301 and placebo with 
respect to time to flare by Week 26. To describe the magnitude of treatment effect, the hazard rati o for KPL -
301 compared to placebo and the 
corresponding 95% CI will be calculated based on a Cox proportional -
hazards model with treatment as a  covariate and stratified  by the 
randomization strata.  
The protocol definition of flare includes multiple compone nts. 
Supportive analyses will be performed based on each individual 
component.  The details will be described in the SAP.  In addition, a 
sensitivity analysis will be performed using the same method described above for the per-protocol analysis set.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
Sustained remission rate at Week 26 will be estimated and compared using the Kaplan-Meier method  
The following endpoints will be analysed using the Cochran-Mantel -
Haenszel test, stratified by the randomized stratum:  
• Percentage of subjects who have completed the corticosteroid 
taper and who have a normal ESR by Week 26  
• Percentage of subjects who have completed the corticosteroid taper and who have a normal CRP by Week 26

11 Section 14.1.2 14.1.2 Multiple Comparisons /Mul tiplicity  
Multiplicity with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint and the key 
secondary efficacy endpoints will be managed via the gated  hierarchical 
testing procedure.  If and only if the primary comparison results in a 
statistically significant difference between KPL -301 and placebo at 0.05 
level of significance, the key secondary comparison will be conducted at 
alpha 0.05 as well.    
All other secondary endpoints are considered exploratory, and no 
adjustment for multiple testing of secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
performed. 
 14 1 2 Multipl icity Adjustment  
Multiplicity adjustment with respect to the primary efficacy and secondary 
efficacy endpoints will be performed using  the gate-keeping  hierarchical 
testing procedure. The order of the secondary endpoints will be described in the SAP. For each endpoint, the null hypothesis is that there is no treatment  difference between KPL -301 and placebo. The alter native 
hypothesis is that KPL -301 is superior to placebo.  For each test, the 2 -
sided Type I error rate is 0.05.  The primary endpoint will be tested first.  If the 2 -sided p-value is ≤0.05 and the test statistic shows KPL -301 
is superior than placebo, sta tistical significance of the primary endpoint 
will be claimed, and the next hierarchical endpoint will be tested.  This process will continue until an endpoint is not statistically significant.     Clarified language in response to request from the FDA.  
12 Section 14.2 Approximately 60 subjects will be randomized 3:2 by disease stratum (new -
onset or relapsing/refractory) to receive KPL -301 or placebo.  
Assuming that time to flare follows an exponential distribution and the proportion of subjects without a flare by week 26 will be 20% in placebo 
and 57.5% in KPL -301, the median time to flare would be estimated to be  
approximately 11.20 weeks in placebo and 32.57 weeks in KPL -301.  The 
hazard ratio (KPL -301 vs. placebo) would be estimated to be  approximately 
0.3438.  With a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05 and a 3:2 randomization 
ratio for KPL -301 vs. placebo, it would require approximately 34  events to 
achieve 86% power using a two- sided log rank test.  
Approximately 60 subjects will be randomized by disease stratum (new -
onset or relapsing/refractory) to receive KPL -301 or placebo at a 3:2 
allocation ratio.  
Subject disposition and the flare event accrual will be closely monitored 
during the study. The monitoring activities will be done in a blinded 
fashion. If there is a high dropout rate and/or the event accrual rate is 
significantly slower than anticipated, up to 10 additional subjects may be 
randomized to obtain the target number of events required for the analysis 
of primary efficacy endpoint.  Assuming that time to flare follows an exponential distribution and the proportion of subjects without a flare by week 26 will be 50% in placebo and 85% in KPL -301, the median time to flare would be approximately 26 weeks 
in plac ebo and 111 weeks in KPL -301 arm.  The hazard ratio (KPL -301 vs. 
placebo) would be approximately 0.234.  With a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 and a 3:2 randomization ratio for KPL -301 vs. placebo, it would 
require approximately 20 events to achieve 87 % power using a two- sided 
log rank test.  
Approximately 70 subjects  will be randomized by disease stratum (new -
onset or relapsing/refractory) to receive KPL -301 or placebo at a 3:2 
allocation ratio.

dropout.

assumptions based on

14 Section 14.5 14.5 Analysis of Efficacy 
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the mITT analysis set.  The 
primary and key secondary efficacy Analyses will be repeated using the PP 
set to assess the sensitivity of the results to major  deviations /violations  of 
the protocol.   All efficacy data including those collected during the open 
label extension will be listed by subject.  
14.5.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is time to flare by Week 26 defined in 14.1  
Subjects who do not experience a flare during this  period will be censored 
at the Week 26 visit. Subjects who drop out or are los t to follow -up prior to 
experiencing a flare during the 26-week double -blind period will be 
censored at the time of their last available visit.  
The number and percentage of subjects who remain in remission (no flare), 
who flare, and who are lost to follow -up prior to a flare during the 26-week 
double -blind  period will be summarized for each treatment group. Time to 
flare by week 26 will be summarized by the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles calculated using the Kaplan -
Meier method to estimate the 
survival functions for each treatment group. The 95% confidence interval 
(CI) for the percentiles will also be calculated. A log -rank test stratified by 
randomization strata will be used to compare KPL -301 and placebo with 
respect to time to flare. The Kapla n-Meier estimates of remission rate at 26 
weeks will be presented with the corresponding 95% CI by treatment group.  
To describe the magnitude of treatment effect, the hazard ratio for KPL -301 
compared to placebo and the corresponding 95% CI will be calcula ted 
based on a Cox proportional -hazards model with treatment as covariate.  
14.5.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint is time to flare by week 26 in the per  
protocol population and will be analyzed using the same methods as 
described above. Subjects who do not experience flare during double blind 
treatment will be censored at their last visit of the double -blind treatment 
period.  Subjects who drop out or are  lost to follow up prior to experiencing 
a flare at any time during double blind treatment will be censored at the 
time of their last available visit.  
14.5.3 Additional Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
The number and percentage of subjects with normal ESR at Week 26 as 
well as the number and percentage of subjects with normal CRP at Week 26 
will be analyzed.  Treatment groups will be compared using a Cochran-
Mantel -Haenszel test controlling for the randomized strata. Confidence 14 5 Analysis of Efficacy 
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the mITT analysis set.  Analyses 
will be repeated using the PP set to assess the sensitivity of the results to important  deviations of the protocol.  
14 5 1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is time to flare by Week 26 defined as time from randomizat ion to the first flare occurring within the treatment  
period. Detailed censoring rules  will be provided in the SAP.  
The number and percentage of subjects who remain in remission (no flare), who flare, and who are lost to follow -up prior to a flare during t he 
treatment  period will be summarized for each treatment group. Time to 
flare by W eek 26 will be summarized by the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th 
percentiles calculated using the Kaplan -
Meier method to estimate the 
survival functions for each treatment group. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the percentiles will also be calculated. A log -rank test stratified by 
randomization strata will be used to compare KPL -301 and placebo with 
respect to time to flare  by Week 26 . To describe the magnitude of treatmen t 
effect, the hazard ratio for KPL -
301 compared to placebo and the 
corresponding 95% CI will be calculated based on a Cox proportional -
hazards model with treatment as a  covariate and stratified by 
randomization strata.   
The protocol definition of flare inc ludes multiple components. 
Supportive analyses will be performed based on each individual 
component.  The details will be described in the SAP.  In addition, a sensitivity analysis will be performed using the same method described 
above for the PP analysis  set. 
14 5 2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  Analysis  
Sustained remission rate at Week 26 will be  estimated and compared 
using the Kaplan-Meier method.  
The following endpoints will be analyzed using the Cochran-Mantel -
Haenszel test  stratified by the randomization strata.  
• Percentage of subjects who have completed the corticosteroid 
taper and who have a normal ESR by Week  26  
• Percentage of subjects who have completed the corticosteroid 
taper and who have a normal CRP by Week  26 Updated t ext for 
clarification and new statistical assumptions.  
Sustained remission rate 
at Week 26 was added as 
a standalone secondary 
efficacy endpoint . 
Time to elevated ESR and CRP by Week 26 
and time to sign/symptoms of GCA 
or new or worsening 
vasculitis by ima ging by 
Week 26 were added as 
secondary efficacy 
endpoints in response to request from the FDA.  
The key secondary endpoint time to flare by Week 26 in the Per 
Protocol population was 
deleted as it will be handled as a sensitivity 
analysis.  
Deleted time to 
corticosteroid dose of 
zero mg/day as a 
secondary efficacy endpoint because patients 
enter the study with 
varying doses of steroids.  
Updated the planned 
number of subjects to 
address potential early drop-out.  
Updated statistical assumptions based on review of Phase 3

CORT125134 -451 
Title of Study:  
Phase 2 Study of the Safety and Efficacy of CORT125134 in the Treatment of Endogenous Cushing’s 
Syndrome  
Study centers: Multicenter (United States [US] and Europe)  
Study Period:  
Up to 38 weeks, including up to 6 weeks for 
screening, up to 28 weeks of treatment, and 4  weeks 
of follow -up Phase of Development:  
Phase 2  
Study Rationale:  
CORT125134  (relacorilant)  is a potent, selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist being 
developed for the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome. Glucocorticoid receptor antagonism is a proven 
mechanism of action for the treatment of the hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism  in adult 
patients with Cushing’s syndrome. Since its mechanism of action is similar to that of mifepristone, 
with the exception that it does not bind the progesterone receptor, CORT125134 may be a treatment of 
Cushing’s syndrome without the drawbacks of p rogesterone receptor antagonism.  
 
Objectives:  
The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety of CORT125134  in patients with endogenous 
Cushing’s syndrome. The secondary objective of the study is to assess the evidence of reduction in 
cortiso l activity following treatment with CORT125134 in patients with endogenous Cushing’s 
syndrome based on improvement in blood glucose control and/or blood pressure (BP).  
 
Study Design and Methodology:  
This is a Phase 2, open -label study with two dose group s (15 patients/group), each with a two -step dose 
escalation.  Because the study drug formulation has been updated (to enhance stability) for this protocol 
and has a different exposure/dose relationship than the formulation used in the initial Phase 1 Study 
CORT125134 -120, full steady -state PK profiles will be generated at every dose level 2 weeks 
following  the initial dose and each  dose escalation .

Enrollment of new patients in Group 2 will be initiated once  Group 1  (15 patients)  has fully enrolled.   
Patient visits to the study site will be at screening, on Day 1 (baseline), Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, 
and after a 4 -week follow -up period  for Group 1 . For Group 2 , patient visits to the study site will be at 
screening, on Day 1 (baseline), Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 , and 16, and after a 4 -week follow -up

Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  period.  Patients from Group 1 who roll over to Group 2 will follow the visit schedule for Group 2 
without dose interruption.  Patient dosing will be done at home, except on days of study visits.  
All patients will undergo  at least  a two -step dose escalation unless the Investigator and Medical 
Monitor agree it is not advised because of safety or tolerability issues,  or the Medical Monitor does not 
approve dose escalation based on the most recent PK results . 
 
 
Number of Patients : 
Approximately 30 patients will be en rolled in the study.  
Patient Selection:  
Approximately 30 male and female adults with a confirmed diagnosis of endogenous Cushing’s 
syndrome and at least one of the following will be enrolled in this study:  
• Type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (at least 6 patients in both Group 1 and 
Group  2)  
• Uncontrolled or untreated hypertension (at least 6 patients in both Group 1 and Group 2)  
Possible etiologies of Cushing’s syndrome include Cushing’s disease, e ctopic adren ocorticotropic 
hormone (ACTH) -secreting tumors, ectopic corticotropin -releasing hormone -secreting tumors, adrenal 
cortisol -secreting adenomas, adrenocortical carcinoma, primary pigmented nodular adrenal disease 
(PPNAD), or primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PMAH).  
Patients will be categorized in the impaired glucose tolerance/diabetes subgroup or the hypertension 
subgroup; a patient may be in both of these subgroups.

For patients in G roup 2 , blood levels of CORT125134 and metabolites will be measured predose and at 
1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 ho urs postdose at Weeks 2, 6, 10 , and 14  and predose only at Weeks 4, 8, 12 , and 
16/early termination (ET) . 
 
Safety  
Safety will be assessed by physical examination findings, vital signs, ECG results, pregnancy tests, 
clinical laboratory test results (hematology and chemistr y panels), adverse events (AEs), and 
concomitant medications.  
 
Statistical Methods  
The sample size is not intended to support formal hypothesis testing.  
All summaries will be presented by starting dose group, regardless of the actual dose level at the tim e 
point associated with the data collection. In addition, data will be tabulated for all patients combined. 
Clinical Study Protocol CORT125134 -451 
Confidential  Page 11 of 109  
Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  In general, continuous variables will be summarized by the number of patients with non -missing data, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values. Categorical variables will be 
summarized by the number and percentage of patients in each category.  
The analysis population for all efficacy and safety analyses will include all patients who received at 
least one dose of study drug. The PK analysis population will comprise all patients who have evaluable 
PK data. For all analyses, the patient will be included in the dose group to which he or she was 
assigned, regardless of actual dose level at the time point when the data were collected.  
Select efficacy endpoints will be analyzed by subgroup only:  
• Patients with impaired glucose tolerance/diabetes  
• Patients with hypertension.  
All enrolled patients will belong to at least one of these subgroups and an individual patient may be 
included in both. If a patient enters the study with hypertension but takes an additional 
antihypertensive medication or increases the dosage of a concurrent antihypertensive medication, that 
patient will be classified as a nonresponder. If a patient enters the study with diabetes/impaired glucose 
tolerance but takes an additional diabetes medication or increases the dosage of a concurrent diabetes 
medication, that patient will be classified as a nonresponder.  
 
Diabetes/Impaired Glucose Tolerance Subgroup  
The area und er the concentration -time curve for glucose (AUC glucose ) will be calculated based on results 
of the oGTTs from baseline to Week 12/ET  for Group 1 and Week 16/ET for Group 2 , for those 
patients with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes at study entry. A responder will be defined as a 
patient who experiences at least a 25% decrease from baseline in AUC glucose . The number and 
percentage of patients who are responders will be presented by dose group and for all patients, along 
with the 95% binomial exact con fidence interval.  
AUC glucose  will be summarized by descriptive statistics by dose group and for all patients. In addition, 
plasma glucose, HbA1c, and adiponectin concentrations will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
by visit, time point, and dose group, to include the change from baseline. Plots of the mean plasma 
glucose values over time will be presented.  
The number and percentage of patients whose dose of medications that lower blood glucose decreased, 
stayed the same, or increased from baseline  to Week 12/ ET in  Group  1 and Week 16/ET in Group  2 
will be summarized, among those patients taking such medications at baseline.  
 
Hypertension Subgroup  
Changes in the mean diastolic and mean systolic BP measured by 24 -hour ambulatory BP monitoring 
will b e analyzed for patients with hypertension at study entry. A responder will be defined as a patient 
who experiences at least a 5 mmHg decrease in diastolic or systolic BP from baseline to Week 12/ET  
in Group  1 and Week 16/ET in Group  2. The number and perce ntage of patients who are responders 
will be presented by dose group and for all patients, along with the 95% binomial exact confidence 
interval.  
Diastolic and systolic BP will be summarized using descriptive statistics by visit, time point, and 
dose group . 
The number and percentage of patients whose dose of antihypertensive medication decreased, stayed 
the same, or increa sed from baseline to Week 12/ET  in Group  1 and Week 16/ET in Group  2 will be 
summarized, among those patients taking such medications at baseline.

Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  Safety  
Adverse events will be mapped to system organ classes and preferred terms using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as 
those that start or worsen after the start of study treatment and up to 28 days after the last dose of study 
treatment.  
Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized overall and by dose group and displayed by system 
organ class and preferred term. Treatment -emergent AEs will be further summarized by severity a nd 
relationship to study treatment. At each level of summation, patients will be counted only once, under 
the greatest severity and strongest study -drug relationship (as reported by the Investigator).  
All AEs (whether TEAEs or not) will be listed by indiv idual patient, including information regarding 
onset, duration, severity, and relationship to study drug. Serious AEs and AEs that led to withdrawal 
from the study will be listed by individual patient.  
Clinical laboratory test results (chemistry and hemat ology), vital sign measurements, and ECG interval 
results will be summarized overall and for each dose group by parameter, visit, and time point using 
descriptive statistics, to include the change from baseline values. Shift tables will be constructed that  
describe changes from baseline to the end of treatment in clinical laboratory values.

Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
In healthy individuals, cortisol is secreted  from the cortical cells of the adrenal glands under the 
control of the pituitary hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH). Endogenous Cushing ’s 
syndrome is a rare multisystem disorder that results from overproduction of the glucocorticoid 
hormone cortis ol. In both adults and children, Cushing ’s syndrome is most commonly caused by 
an ACTH -secreting pituita ry tumor  (Cushing ’s disease). Other forms of Cushing ’s syndrome 
result from  autonomous production of cortisol from adrenal cortical tumors or overproduc tion of 
ACTH from non -pituitary tumor s (ectopic ACTH syndrome).  
The only curative treatment is resection of the tumor  source of the excess cortisol . Depending on 
the nature of the underlying tumor  (ie, benign versus malignant, localized versus metastatic),  the 
selected treatment may be surgery, radiotherapy, medical therapy, or a combination of these . 
Pharmacological treatment is not curative in Cushing ’s syndrome –only successful surgery is –but 
it serves to control  the disease after unsuccessful surgery or recurrence  (Nieman 20 15). It may 
also be used to lower cortisol activity to improve a patient ’s condition prior to surgery  and is 
employed as interim therapy under specific circumstances, such as in patients waiting for 
radiotherapy to be effective  (Cuevas -Ramos  2014 ).  
Currently, there are two United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved 
medical therapies for endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. The first is mifepristone ( Korlym®), 
which has been approved for the control  of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult 
patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose 
intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for  surgery . The second is pasireotide 
(Signifor®), a somatostatin receptor agonist, which has been approved for the treatment of adult 
patients with Cushing’s disease for whom pituitary surgery is not an option or has not been 
curative . 
In the US, d rugs comm only used off -label in the medical therapy of Cushing’s syndrome either 
inhibit adrenal steroidogenesis (such as metyrapone, mitotane , or ketoconazole), or reduce 
ACTH release from the pituitary gland (such as the dopamine agonists bromocriptine and 
caberg oline; and the somatostatin receptor ligand octreotide). In general, the former agents show 
significant toxic effects and/or loss of efficacy over time, and the latter agents have not shown 
substantial  efficacy. In Europe, drugs approved for the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome include 
aminoglutethimide (Orimeten®), ketoconazole (Nizoral®), metyrapone (Metopirone®), mitotane 
(Lysodren®), and pasireotide (Signifor) ( Eckstein 2014 ). 
CORT125134 is a potent, selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist being developed for 
the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome. The mechanism of action of CORT125134 is similar to 
that of mifepristone, with the exception that CORT125134 does not bind to the progesterone 
receptor. The potential advantage  of CORT125134 compared with  mifepristone is its selective  
and potent GR antagonis m, without anti -progesterone effects, including endometrial hypertrophy 
and the potential for irregular vaginal bleeding.  
CORT125134 is a high -affinity antagonist of the GR (inhibition constant [Ki] <1  nM in a human 
GR binding assay and <10  nM in a human functional assay). Across a range of in vitro assays it 
is similar in both GR affinity and inhibition to mifepristone (an a ntagonist of both the 
Clinical Study Protocol CORT125134 -451 
Confidential  Page 23 of 109  
Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  progesterone receptor and GR as measured in ligand binding assays), as summarized in Table 1. 
Functional antagonism is assessed by measuring the ability of CORT125134 and mifepristone to 
prevent dexamethasone -induced increase in the activity of tyrosine amino transferase (TAT). The 
expression of the TAT gene is regulated by GR, and a GR agonist such as dexamethasone 
increases gene expression, protein production, and enzyme activity. For routine screening, the 
human liver carcinoma cell line Hep -G2 and the rat hepatoma cell line H4 -II-EC4 are used. 
Glucocorticoid receptor agonists also reduce the production of several inflammatory cy tokines, 
including tum or necrosis factor alpha (TNF -α), in human peripheral blood mono -nuclear cells 
stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, by repressing gene transcription. Glucocorticoid receptor 
antagonists such as mifepristone and CORT125134 reverse the e ffects of the agonist 
dexamethasone.

1.1.1 Nonclinical Data  
To characterize the nonclinical safety of CORT125134, preliminary ascending single -dose, 
repeat -dose, and Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 14 -day repeat -dose toxicology studies wer e 
conducted in rats and cynomologus monkeys . The results of the general toxicology studies 
indicated that CORT125134 produced many anticipated effects related to the antagonism of GR 
and compensatory perturbations of the hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal (HPA ) axis. In these 
studies, safety pharmacology assessments included cardiovascular effects in monkeys, 
respiratory function in rats, and neurobehavioral effects in rats. In general, there were no 
remarkable central nervous, respiratory, or cardiovascular sy stem effects in rats or monkeys 
following single oral doses up to 200 mg/kg (highest dose tested).

CORT125134 was not genotoxic in in vitro bacterial and mammalian cell assays or in vivo in the 
rat micronucleus assay.  
CORT125134 is not a substrate for permeability glycoprotein (P -gp). It appears to be eliminated 
via multiple metabolic pat hways including cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 
and a non -CYP pathway but not via renal elimination. This is reassuring with respect to the risk 
of drug -drug interactions affecting exposure to CORT125134. Based on in vitro studies, 
CORT125134 appears to be a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 and a modest inhibitor 
of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A5. No significant induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 
or CYP3A4 was noted in a study carried out in human hepatocytes.  
More information is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure  
1.1.2 Clinical Experience : Safety  
Clinical experience with CORT125134 is derived from three studies conducted in healthy 
subjects ; Study CORT125134 -120 which evaluated single ascending and multiple ascending 
doses of the earlier formulation  in healthy subjects, Study CORT125134 -122 which evaluated a 
single dose of 150 mg of the current  formulation (modified to improve stability) in healthy 
subjects , and Study CORT125134 -453 which evaluated multiple ascending doses of the current 
formulation in healthy subjects.   
Study CORT125134 -120 consisted of  Part 1  and Parts  2 and 3, which assessed  the safety, 
tolerability , and pharmacokinetics ( PK) of single and multiple  ascending  doses, respectively, in 
healthy volunteers . In total across all  single -dose groups  in Part 1 , 69 subjects received 
CORT125134 and 12 received placebo  (8 subjects received each of 5, 15, and 50 mg fasted; 
7 received 150 mg fasted; 6 received 300 mg fasted , and 24 received 500 mg fasted, and a further 
8 received 150 mg fed ). Across all multiple -dose groups  in Part 2 , 25 subjects received up to 
14 days’ treatment with CORT125134 and 9 received placebo  (9 subjects received each of 50 
and 150 mg, and 7 subjects  received 250 mg once daily ) after an overnight fast.  Dosing in Part 3 
of the study, in which the safety, tolerability and PK of a higher multiple dose (500 mg) daily in 
healthy volunteers were assessed, was terminated prematurely due to lack of tolerabili ty 
(principall y musculoskeletal complaints). Safety follow -up for Part 3 subjects is completed (refer 
to accompanying Investigator Brochure).  
Overall, CORT125134 was safe and well tolerated following single doses up to 500 mg or 
repeated doses up to 250 mg  once daily. The overall incidence of treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs)  was low after administration of CORT125134, with no notable difference in the 
percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs after dosing with active drug compared with placebo.

Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  In the multiple -ascending -dose study  (Part 2) , TEAEs in the musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders system organ class  were reported more frequently by subjects treated with 
CORT125134, and with increasing frequency with increasing dose. The proportions  of subjects 
with reports of musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder TEAEs by daily dose were 
Placebo:   0 subjects; 50  mg: 2 subjects (22.2%); 150 mg: 4 subjects (44.4%); and 250 mg: 4 
subjects (57.1%). The events  reported were coded as back pain, p ain in extremity, myalgia, 
arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, spinal osteoarthritis , and tendon discomfort. However, b ack

in extremity (0% [0/9] placebo, 0%  [0/9] 50 mg, 11.1% [1/9] 150 mg, and 28.6% [2/7]  250 mg ), 
and myalgia (0% [0/9] placebo, 0%  [0/9] 50 mg, 22.2% [2/9] 150 mg, and 0% [0/7]  250 mg ) 
were the only TEAEs reported for at least 2 subjects in any of the three multiple ascending dose 
cohort s. There was also some evidence that gastrointestinal TEAEs, such as abdominal pain 
upper, epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation were reported with increasing 
frequency with dose of CORT125134, with the majority assessed as treatment -related following 
both single and multiple doses.  
Most events were mild, but moderate abdominal pain and constipation in one subject treated with 
CORT125134, 250  mg daily, and severe pain in extremity in one subject treated with 
CORT125134, 150 mg daily, resulted in withdrawal  of treatment.  
Findings in Part  3, the multiple -ascending -dose extension cohort, show that CORT125134 
500 mg once daily exceeds the maximum well -tolerated dose, with musculoskeletal symptoms 
and earache being the most frequently reported limiting symptoms . 
One serious adverse event (S AE) was reported in this Phase 1 study. A subject treated with 
CORT125134, 50 mg daily was admitted to the hospital overnight due to a head injury during 
the follow -up period. The subject declared this was due to an accidental  fall; however, the 
hospital record states that the subject was assaulted. The event was considered unrelated to study 
treatment and the subject made a full recovery.  
There were no clinically significant findings in any laboratory assessments, vital signs,  12-lead 
ECGs, Holter electrocardiograms ( ECGs ), or body weight. Five CORT125134 -treated subjects in 
the multiple -dose part  of the study had substantial reductions in platelet count during the 
treatment period , with  prompt recovery subsequently. The averag e of the absolute platelet counts 
decreased in the CORT125134 -treated groups when compared with placebo. None of the 
individual decreases was considered clinically significant, and an independent review by an 
experienced hematologist did not consider these  findings a safety concern.  
Study CORT125134 -122 evaluated the safety, tolerability, and PK of a single 150 mg dose of the 
CORT125134 current  formulation in 8 healthy male volunteers.  No serious or severe adverse 
events were reported during the study, and no subjects withdrew from the study due to adverse 
events. A total of 1 treatment -emergent adverse event  (mild dizziness)  was reported by 1 of 8 
subjects (12.5%) during the study.

1.1.3 Clinical Experience : Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic results from the Phase 1 study  (Study CORT125134 -120) in healthy s ubjects 
demonstrated that CORT125134 concentrations declined in a multiphasic manner. Plasma 
concentrations appeared to plateau by Day  7 with little accumulation from Day 7 to Day 14, 
indicating that concentrations were likely at or near steady -state by Da y 7. Concentrations 
declined to unmeasurable levels prior to or by the last sampling time point, indicating that the 

Clinical Study Protocol CORT125134 -451 
Confidential  Page 28 of 109  
Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  concentration -time profile was completely captured within the planned sampling time window 
and was limited only by the lower limit of the b ioanalytical method.  
The half -life for CORT125134 in Part 2 after the last dose on Day 14 averaged 11.99, 19.09, and 
14.71 hours at 50, 150, and 250 mg/day, respectively.  
Based on the limited data available, an effect of food to reduce exposure to COR T125134 cannot 
be excluded.  
Dose proportionality analysis showed that for both maximum plasma concentration (C max) and 
area under the concentration -time curve (AUC), exposure increased in a greater than 
proportional manner with dose increment for both single and daily dosing. This effect was 
particularly noticeable at the lowest doses in the si ngle ascending dose phase. Inter-subject 
variability in exposure was moderate.  
  
  
 
Metabolite (CORT125201) exposure was low compared with parent drug. At presumed steady -
state, metabolite AUC 0-24h was less than 5% that of parent drug.  
In Study CORT125134 -122, which evaluated the 150 -mg dose of the  updated,  current capsule 
formula tion in 8  healthy volunteers, CORT125134 was absorbed rapidly (median T max 1 hour, 
range 1 -2 hours) to a mean C max of 200.5 ng/mL. Thereafter, elimination was rapid (median T last 
24 hours; mean t ½ 7.7 hours), giving a mean AUC inf of 801 ng •h/mL.  
In compari son of the current  capsule formulation with historical data for the earlier  capsule 
formulation, exposure from the current formulation was substantially lower, with C max 
approximately 30 to 52% and AUC inf 22 to 36% of that of the earlier  formulation  
. 
 
 
 
 
1.1.4 Clinic al Experience: Pharmacodynamics  
The PD effects of CORT125134 were assessed  in Study CORT125134 -120 by evaluating the 
ability of CORT125134 to prevent selected effects of the GR agonist prednisone. This evaluation 
was conducted after the administration of a  single dose of CORT125134 (500 mg) in Part 1 of 
the study, and 14 days repeat dosing of CORT125134 (250 mg/day) in Part 2 of the study. In Part 
1, a single dose of mifepristone (600 mg) was used as a comparator.  
Administration of a single dose of predniso ne (25 mg) resulted in a rapid drop in eosinophils, 
lymphocytes, and osteocalcin, and an increase in neutrophils. After administration of 600 mg 
mifepristone with 25 mg prednisone, the effect of prednisone on these parameters was 
ameliorated to a large ext ent. Similarly, after administration of 500 mg CORT125134 the effect 

Clinical Study Protocol CORT125134 -451 
Confidential  Page 29 of 109  
Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  of prednisone was also ameliorated. The 24 -hour AUC on time point deltas for proof of 
pharmaceutical effect (PoPE) parameters for both mifepristone and CORT125134 were 
significantly diffe rent from those for prednisone alone on Day −19 (p <0.05) for eosinophils and 
neutrophils but not plasma osteocalcin. For lymphocyte 24 -hour AUC, CORT125134 with 
prednisone (but not mifepristone with prednisone) was significantly different to prednisone 
alone. 
Administration of a single dose of prednisone 25 mg resulted in an abnormal glucose tolerance 
test. After administration of 500 mg of CORT125134 with 25 mg of prednisone, the effect of 
prednisone on glucose tolerance appeared to be  ameliorated. Admini stration of  600 mg of 
mifepristone with 25  mg of prednisone was used as comparator.  
In Part 2 of the study, the 24 -hour AUC on time point deltas for PoPE parameters for 
CORT125134 on Day 14 were significantly different from those for prednisone alone on D ay −5 
(p <0.05) for eosinophils, neutrophils, and osteocalcin but not lymphocytes. Because there were 
only 3 placebo -treated subjects, no statistical comparison was done between placebo - and 
CORT125134 -treated subjects. However, it was evident from plottin g the data that active 
treatment on Day 14 resulted in an amelioration of the prednisone effect whereas placebo 
treatment did not.  
The administration of prednisone increased FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) mRNA 
expression, and this increase was prevented b y co-administration of either mifepristone (600 mg) 
or CORT125134 (500 mg) with the prednisone in Part 1 of the study. After dosing with 
CORT125134 (250 mg) for 14 days in Part 2 of the study, prednisone did not induce FKBP5 
mRNA expression. Administration  of placebo for 14 days did not prevent prednisone -induced 
FKBP5 mRNA expression.  
Due to inhibition of the negative feedback mechanism, the administration of a GR antagonist 
causes an increase in morning serum plasma cortisol levels. After administration o f 
CORT125134 for 14  days, there appeared to be a dose -related effect, with increased cortisol 
levels at the higher doses. A comparison between morning cortisol levels on Day 13 for 
CORT125134 -treated subjects with placebo -treated subjects showed that 50 mg  CORT125134 
did not have a statistically significant effect (p = 0.2634), whereas 150 mg and 250 mg 
CORT125134 did have a statistically significant effect (p = 0.0025 and 0.0006, respectively).  
Analysis of ECG safety data from the Phase 1 study showed that CORT125134 at doses up to 
500 mg, which resulted in plasma concentrations up to approximately 3 µg/mL, did not have a 
clinically relevant effect on ECG parameters (cardiac safety report, data o n file). Based on the 
exposure -response analysis of the QT effect, the data demonstrated that CORT125134 does not 
have a clinically relevant effect on the QTc interval. An effect on ∆∆QTcF above 10 ms could 
clearly be excluded within the studied range of p lasma concentrations up to approximately 
3 µg/mL, which corresponded to single doses up to 500 mg or repeated doses up to 250 mg 
once  daily.  
1.1.5 Adverse Events with  Similar Drugs  
Mifepristone is a potent antagonist of both progesterone via the progesterone rec eptor  and 
cortisol via the GR receptor , and has  weak antiandrogenic activity . In the pivotal, uncontrolled, 
open -label, multicenter study of mifepristone in 50 patients with Cushing ’s syndrome , the 
Clinical Study Protocol CORT125134 -451 
Confidential  Page 30 of 109  
Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  following adverse events ( AEs), as reported in the Korlym prescribing information, were 
reported in ≥20% of patients : nausea, fatigue, headache, decreased blood potassium, arthralgia, 
vomiting, peripheral edema, hypertension, dizziness, decreased appetite, and endometrial 
hypertrophy . “Adrenal insufficiency” was reported in 2  patients (4%) . The most common  
symptoms of adrenal insufficiency were nausea and decreased appetite . No hypotension or 
hypoglycemia was reported during the events . Adrenal insufficiency resolved in both cases with 
mifepristone interruption and/or dexa methasone administration . Adrenal insufficiency was 
reported in 5 of the 30 patients (16.7%) who participated in  the extension study, in which 
patients received up to 1 year of treatment with mifepristone . 
Across five psychotic depression trials that evaluated 7 -day dosing with mifepristone (up to 
1200 -mg dose), AEs reported in ≥10% of patients who received mifepristone (N  = 833) were 
nausea and headache. In these trials,  the majority of reported treatment -emergent SAEs were 
psychiatric. The three most prevalent psychiatric disorder SAEs reported were worsened 
depression, worsened psychosis, and suicidal ideation. There were no reports of adrenal 
insufficiency.  
1.2 Rationale f or the Current Study  
This will be the first prospective clinical study to evaluate the safety of CORT125134 , a selective 
GR antagonist,  in patients with endogenous Cushing ’s syndrome  for whom the Investigator has 
determined that medical treatment of endoge nous hypercortisolemia is indicated . The study will 
assess the effect of treatment on the signs and symptoms of hypercortisolemia.  
Glucocorticoid receptor antagonism is a proven mechanism of action for the treatment of the 
hyperglycemia secondary to hyper cortisolism in adult patients with Cushing’s syndrome. Since 
its mechanism of action is similar to that of mifepristone, with the exception that it does not bind 
the progesterone receptor, CORT125134 may be a treatment of  Cushing’s syndrome without the 
drawbacks of progesterone receptor antagonism that may result in untoward reproductive effects  
and/or interruption of therapy . 
The activity of CORT 125134 has been demonstrated in various in vitro  assays and CORT125134 
was shown to be well tolerated in a Phase  1 study that examined the clinical PK  and safety of 
CORT125134 doses  as high as 350 mg for 14 days . The combination of the preclinical and 
clinical assessments justif ies the evaluation of CORT125134 in patients with Cushing’s 
syndrome.  
The study is intended to demonstrate safety and clinical effects of GR antagonism, with an 
emphasis on blood glucose control and blood pressure ( BP) control, in patients with Cushing’s 
syndrome . The PK of CORT 125134  will also be evaluated . In addition to b lood glucose control 
and BP control, s everal other exploratory efficacy assessments  will be used to assess clinical 
benefit. In patients with adrenal Cushing ’s syndrome, changes of the HPA axis  will be monitored 
in addition to clinical monitoring. Successf ul GR blockade at the hypothalamus and pituitary 
level will reverse the excessive negative cortisol feedback , as shown by ACTH increase, 
indicating recovery of the HPA axis . In addition, increased production of adrenal androgens 
(androstenedione and dehydr oepiandrosterone sulfate [DHEA -S]), which are regulated by 
ACTH, would also signal recovery of the atrophic adrenal tissue.

Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  Changes in serum cortisol, late-night  salivary cortisol , and urinary free cortisol (UFC) will also 
be evaluated , as well as changes in body weight, waist circumference, body composition , lipid 
levels, and hormone levels; effects  on strength and menstrual cycle (premenopausal female 
patients not taking hormonal birth control); a quality -of-life assessment (CushingQoL); the Beck 
Depressi on Inventory (BDI -II); and a Physic ian’s Global Assessment of the signs and symptoms

The primary study objective is to assess the safety of CORT125134 in patients with endogenous 
Cushing ’s syndrome.  
The secondary study objective is to assess the evidence of reduction in cortisol activity following 
treatment with CORT125134 in patients with endogenous Cushing ’s syndrome , based on 
improvement in blood glucose control and/or BP . 
Clinical Study Protocol CORT125134 -451 
Confidential  Page 37 of 109  
Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Overview of  Study Design  
This is a Phase 2, open -label  study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two dose regimens of 
CORT125134 in patients with endogenous Cushing ’s syndrome  and type 2 diabetes or glucose 
intolerance and/or uncontrolled or untreated hypertension . Patients will be categorized in the 
impaired glucose tolerance/diabetes subgroup  or the hypertension subgroup ; a patient may be in 
both of these sub group s. The impaired glucose tolerance/diabetes subgroup will include at a least 
6 patients in both  Group  1 and Group 2 . The hypertension subgroup will include at least 
6 patients in both Group 1 and Group 2 . 
Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled across clinical sites in the US and Europe. Two dose 
groups including 15 patients per group will be evaluated , each with a two-step dose escalation . 
The study will consist of 3  periods : a screening period (Days −42 to −1); a treatment period 
consisting of 4 weeks at the initial  dose, immediately followed by 4 weeks at the next higher 
dose (ie, first dose escalati on), immediately followed by an additional 4 weeks at the next higher 
dose (ie, second dose escalation) ; and a follow -up period of  4 weeks .  
Because the study drug formulation has been updated (to enhance stability) for this protocol , and 
has a different  exposure/dose relationship than the formulation used in the initial Phase 1 Study 
CORT125134 -120 , full steady -state PK pr ofiles will be generated at 
every dose level  2 weeks following the initial dose and each dose escalation . The Medical 
Monitor must approve all individual dose escalations and will review the patient ’s safety profile 
and steady -state PK results, including AUC 0–24h values . If the patient’s projected AUC 0–24h value  
meet s the dose -escalation rules outlined in Section  5.4.2 , the patient’s dose will be esc alated; 
otherwise, the patient’s dose will remain at the current level.   
An independent DRC will convene  at least 4 times during the study  to review  safety and  PK 
results , as listed below.  
Two dose groups will  each enroll 15  patients sequentially, with enrollment of the second dose 
group occurring after the 15th patient has enrolled in the  first dose group, as follows:  
• Patients enrolled into Group 1 will receive CORT125134 100 mg/day for 4 weeks, then 
CORT125134 1 50 mg/day for 4 weeks, then CORT125134 200 mg/day for 4 weeks.  
• After 6 patients have received CORT125134 through Week 10 (ie, 2 weeks following 
dose escalation to 200 mg/day), the DRC will review PK and safety data to confirm the 
appropriateness of the dose levels in Group  1. 
• After  12 patients ha ve received CORT125134 through Week 10 (ie, 2 weeks following 
dose escalation to 200 mg/day), the DRC will review PK and safety data and recommend 
changes, if applicable, to the dose escalation in Group 2.  
• Group 2: CORT125134 2 50 mg/day for 4 weeks, then 300 mg/day for 4  weeks, then 
350 mg/day for 4 weeks , and then 400 mg for 4 weeks . Patients who discontinue prior to 
Week 10 may be replaced to ensure that at least 12  patients provide serial PK data 
through Week 10 in Group 1 and Group 2.  
• The DRC will also  meet during Group 2, when steady -state PK data  are available for 
6 patients  who have reached their highest CORT125134 dose (ie, Week 10 if 350 mg and 
Week 14 if 400 mg)  and at the end of the study.  

Clinical Study Protocol CORT125134 -451 
Confidential  Page 38 of 109  
Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  • In the event that patients enrolled in Group 2 cannot tol erate the starting dose, they will 
be allowed to continue on  study  at a lower dose level (ie , 150  or 200  mg). 
• Patients who complete 12 weeks of dosing in Group 1  may, at the recommendation  of the 
Investigator  and with agreement of the Medical Monitor , roll over to  Group 2 and follow 
the Group 2 dose escalation schedule.  
 
Enrollment of new patients in Group 2 will be initiated once Group 1 (15 patients) has fully 
enrolled.  
All patients will undergo at least a two -step dose escalation (Figure 2) unless the Investigator and 
Medical Monitor agree it is not advised because of safety or tolerability issues , or the Medical 
Monitor does not approve dose escalation  based on the most recent  PK results (see 
Section  5.4.2 ). Patient dosing will be done at home, except on days of study  visits.  
Patient visits to the study site will be at screening, on Day 1 (baseline), Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 
12, and after a 4 -week follow -up period  for patients in Group 1  and Group 2  and additionally at 
Weeks 14 and 16 for patients in Group 2 who dose -escalate to 400 mg  daily . Patients from 
Group 1 rolling over into Group 2 will continue the visit schedule for Group 2 without dose 
interruption ; for these patients, Week 12 will be their baseline visit for Group 2 and they will not 
undergo the Group 1 4 -week follo w-up visit . The following safety measurements will be 
performed during each in -clinic visit: AE reporting, safety laboratories, physical exams, vital 
signs, ECGs, concomitant medications and pregnancy tests. Key efficacy parameters will also be 
measured in cluding effects on: glucose tolerance, blood pressure, cortisol concentration, 
body/weight composition and metabolism. Predose and post dose samples for serial PK will be 
collected at Weeks 2, 6, and 10, and predose trough PK samples only will be collected at Weeks 
4, 8, and 12 /early termination (ET)  for patients in Group 1 . For patients in Group 2 who dose -
escalate  to 400 mg daily, predose and postdose samples for serial PK will also be collected at 
Week 14,  and key efficacy parameters as well as predose trough PK samples  will be collected at 
Week 16/ET. Between clinic visits, weekly contact with patients will occur via email or 
telephone to capture study drug compliance , AEs, and medication changes.

3.2 Data Review Committee  
An independent DRC consisting of at least one physician experienced in the evaluation and 
treatment of patients with Cushing’s syndrome, a clinical pharmacologist, and a statistician will 
revie w CORT125134 PK and safety data . Data will be reviewed in accordance with procedures 
detailed in a separate DRC Charter. The DRC meeting timelines and role are described below:  
The DRC will convene:  
• For oversight of Group 1:  
– When 6 evaluable patients have escalated to Dose 3 of Group 1 (200 mg), and steady -
state PK and safety data are available (to confirm the appropriateness of the Group 1 
dose levels)  
– When  12 evaluable patients have escalated to Dose 3 of Group 1, and steady -state PK 
and safety data are available  
• For oversight of Grou p 2: 
– When 6 evaluable patients have escalated to Dose 3 or 4 ( whichever is the patient’s 
highest Group 2 dose ) and PK and safety data are available  
– At end of study  

Clinical Study Protocol CORT125134 -451 
Confidential  Page 40 of 109  
Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  • Overall, no less than every 6 months while the study is in progress  
The DRC will perform the  following tasks:  
• Evaluate PK data from the study in concert with the results of updated PK modeling 
 
• Recommend changes , if applicable,  to any planned dose levels 
  
The DRC’s evaluation of PK results for groups of patients and their review of the PK simulations 
and estimated exposures based on PK modeling will complement the Medical Monitor’s review 
of individual  dose escalation s.  
In the event that a decision is made  by the Sponsor to reject a safety recommendation by the 
DRC, the decision and rationale will be communicated to the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) and site IRBs before enrolling additional patients.

Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  4 STUDY POPULATION  
The following eligibility criteria  are designed to select patient s for whom protocol treatment is 
considered appropriate. All relevant medical and nonmedical conditions will be taken into 
consideration when deciding whether this protocol is suitable for a particular patient .

4.3 Screening Failures and Rescreening  
Patients who fail screening due to a laboratory result may be retested within the screening period 
without prior Corcept approval. Screening UFC  tests may be performed  up to four times during 
the screening period. S alivary cortisol tests may also be performed  up to four times during the 
screening period . The average of the results for each test will serve as the “baseline” for each 
test. Other laboratory tests during th e screening period may be repeated at the Investigator’s 
discretion. The 24 -hour ambulatory BP monitoring may be repeated if there is a technical 
problem with the test.  
Whenever patients are rescreened, they must sign an informed consent form each time and  be 
assigned a new patient identification number. The only screening assessments that do not need to 
be repeated during rescreening are the oGTT and the dexamethasone suppression test.   
In patients with an abnormal QTc interval at screening in which no con comitant drugs known 
to prolong QTc and no electrolyte abnormalities are present, two repeat ECG recordings should 
be done. The final decision on excluding a patient  should be based on the average QTcF interval 
across the 3 recordings. If an electrolyte ab normality is present, it should be corrected before the 
ECG is repeated. If the patient is on a concomitant medication known to cause QT prolongation, 
an alternative medication may be considered and the ECG repeated after an appropriate 
washout  time.

5.4.3 Dose Reductions  
Dose reductions may be performed according to the following rules:  
• The Investigator may reduce the dose of CORT125134 for AEs or tolerability issues to 
the next lower dose (eg, from 200 to 1 50 mg/day or from 3 50 to 300 mg/day).  
• With the approval of the Medical Monitor, the Investigator may subsequently increase 
the dose t o the previous dose (eg, from 1 50 back to 200 mg/day or from 300 back to 
350 mg/day).  
• If the dose of CORT125134 is reduced, a subsequent dose increase should be avoided 
within 7 days of a Week 2, Week 6, or Week 10 PK evaluation.  
• Further dose escalations at Week 4 or Week 8 (as with all escalations) must be approved 
by the Medical Monitor.  
• Patients enrolled in Group 2 who cannot tolerate the starting dose selected for Group 2 
(ie, planned to be 2 50 mg) will be allowed to continue on -study at the next lower  dose 
level ( ie, 200 mg). Subsequent dose increases/escalations will follow the rules listed 
above.  
Dose reductions based on excessive GR blockade are outlined in Section 7.14.4.1 .

Confidential  Page 55 of 109  
Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  The oG TT should be  performed after an 8 -hour fast . In general, the p atient should not take the 
antidiabetic oral medication in the morning of their visit. To avoid hypoglycemia, insulin cannot 
be taken prior to the oGTT. Long -acting insulin can be taken the nigh t before the oGTT. Oral 
antidiabetes medications and insulin preparations can be taken with food after the completion of 
the oGTT.  
7.11.1.2  Effects on Blood Pressure  
The 24 -hour ambulatory BP will be assessed for all patients during the screening period. For the 
subgroup of patients who qualify for the hypertension subgroup, there must be a 24 -hour 
ambulatory BP test done within 3 weeks before Day 1; this result will be used as “ baseline”. (If 
the initial screening test was done within 3 weeks before Day 1, it does  not need to be repeated.) 
The 24 -hour ambulatory BP will also be measured in the hypertension subgroup at Weeks 2, 4, 
6, 8, 10, and 12/ET  for Group 1 and  at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16/ET for Group 2 . 
Mean 24 -hour systolic and diastolic ambulator y BP will be obtained by the patient at home using 
an ambulatory BP monitor provided and initiated  at the study site. The patient should use the 
monitor during a time when a full 24 -hour recording can be made.  
An ambulatory BP monitor will be given to the patient at screening, and the patient will bring the 
monitor to each study visit  or will send it to the study site in advance of the next study visit .

symptoms. Patient s will complete the BDI -II at baseline (Day 1)  and at Week s 4, 8, and 12/ET 
for Group 1 and at W eeks 4, 8, 12, and  16/ET for Group 2 .  
7.11.2.5.2  Trail  Making  Test 
The Trail Making Test is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. It 
consists of two parts in which the patient  is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as quickly  as 
possible while still maintaining accuracy. It can provide information about visual search speed, 
scanning, pr ocessing speed, and mental flexi bility, as well as executive functioning. The Trail 
Making Test will be administered at baseline (Day 1)  and at Week s 4, 8, and 12/ET for Group 1 
and at Week s 4, 8, 12, and  16/ET for Group 2 . 
7.11.2.5.3  CushingQoL  
The CushingQoL patient questionnaire evaluates the health -related quality of life in patients 
with Cushing ’s syndrome  (Webb 2008 ). It comprises 12 questions, each with 5 possible answers. 
The CushingQoL instrument addresses known problem areas associated with Cushing ’s 
syndrome including trouble sleeping, wound healing/bruising, irritability/mood swings/anger, 
self-confidence, physical c hanges, ability to participate in activities, interactions with friends and 
family, memory issues and future health concerns.  Lower values reflect lower quality of life.  The 
CushingQoL questionnaire will be administered at baseline (Day 1) , at Week s 4, 8, and 12/ET 
for Group 1 and at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16/ET for Group 2 , and at the follow -up visit.

Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  sit down again and then stand up and sit down five times as quickly as possible. The chair should 
be of standard height so that the patient ’s legs are in flexion of approximately 90 degrees about 
the knee when the feet are flat on the floor. Patient s should be advised not to place their feet far 
beneath chair and n ot to offset the feet in the horizontal plane  (ie, asked to place their feet under 
the front of the chair, not too far forward (in front of the chair) or too far back (under the chair 
seat) . The study staff will use a stopwatch to measure the total time it  takes for the patient  to 
stand up and sit down  five times; start time is in the seated position and stop time is in the final 
standing position. Patient s with gait or balance disorders are not required to complete the sit -to-
stand test. The same or similar chair should be used for all measurements.  
7.11.2.8  Hormonal and Menstrual Cycle Effects

Week 16/ET visit for Group 2 . 
Menstrual cycle information (eg, age at menarche, current pattern of menses, duration of vaginal 
bleed ) will be recorded , along with any spotting occurrences , at every visit  in premenopausal 
female patients  not on hormonal birth control.  
7.11.2.9  Coagulation Effects  
Blood samples will be obtained from all enrolled patient s at baseline  (Day 1) and at Week s 4, 8, 
and 12 /ET for coagulation tests  for Group 1  and at baseline and Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16/ET for 
Group 2. These include activat ed partial thromboplastin time , Factor VIII, Factor IX, Factor X,

High -sensitivity C -reactive protein is an endothelial inflammati on marker. A blood sample will 
be collected for this assay at baseline  (Day 1) and at Week s 4, 8, and 12 /ET for Group 1, and at 
baseline and Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16/ET for Group 2 .  
7.11.2.15  24-Hour Urine Calcium and Sodium  
Increased urinary calcium excretion is a major risk factor in the development of kidney stones in 
patients with Cushing ’s syndrome. Increased sodium excretion in the urine reflects sodium 
consumption and is used during the investigation of hypertension as well as in the differential 
diagnosis of failure of antihypertensive medications or medications that target specific causes of 
hypertension.  
Using the urine samples collected for UFC, calcium and sodium levels will be measured in all 
patients at screening, baseline ( Day 1 ), and  for Group 1  at Wee ks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 /ET and 
for Group 2 at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16/ET .  
7.11.2.16  Insulin -like Growth Factor (IGF) -1 
Insulin -like growth factor -1 is a hormone with a structure similar to that of insulin. A blood 
sample will be obta ined from all patients for this determination at baseline  (Day 1) ; at Week s 4, 
8, and 12 /ET for Group 1 ; and at  Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16/ET  for Group 2 .  
7.11.2.17  Thyroid Function Tests  
A blood sample will be obtained from all patients for thyroid function tests (free thyroxine [T4],  
free triiodothyronine [T3], reverse T3, thyroid stimulating hormone at screening, baseline (Day 
1), and at Weeks 2,  4, 6, 8, 10, and 12/ET  for Group 1 . For Group 2, samples will be collected at 
screening, baseline, and at Weeks 2,  4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and  16/ET visits.  
7.12 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
For Group 1, blood levels of CORT125134 and metabolites will be measured predose and at 1, 2, 
4, 6, and 8  hours postdose at Weeks 2, 6, and 10, and predose only at Weeks 4, 8, and 12/ET . For 
Group 2, blood levels of CORT125134 and metabolites will be measured predose and at 1, 2, 4, 
6, and 8  hours postdose at Weeks 2, 6, 10, and 14, and predose only at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 
16/ET.  
Clinical Study Protocol CORT125134 -451 
Confidential  Page 60 of 109  
Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  The time windows for collection of PK samples are listed below:   
Nominal Time  Reporting  Standards  
Predose  Up to 60 minutes before dosing  
1 hour postdose  ±5 minutes  
2 hours postdose  ±10 minutes  
4, 6, and 8 hours postdose  ±15 minutes  
 
Dose escalations will proceed according to the procedures outlined in Section 5.4.2 . For patients 
in Groups 1 and 2, the  first planned escalation of dose will take place the day after the Week 4 
visit, and the second planned escalation of dose will take place the day after the Week 8 visit . For 
patients in Group 2, the third planned escalation of dose will take place the day after the Week 
12 visit.   
In case of a recent or pending dose interruption or dose reduction, the PK sa mpling day at Week s 
2, 6, 10 , or 14  may be adjusted (ie, made earlier or later) to try to capture at least 7 days of 
administration of the current dose of study drug before PK sampling. (Otherwise, all testing 
windows in the Schedule of Events [Section s 13.1 and 13.2] must be followed.)  
If a sc heduled dose escalation is cancelled, the patient will provide subsequent blood samples for 
all trough CORT125134 levels only (ie, full PK profiles at Week s 6, 10, or 14 will not be 
performed).  
If, as a resul t of a dose reduction, a Week s 6, 10, or 14 full PK profile would be redundant 
(ie, a full PK profile was already successfully obtained at the patient’s current dose), it will not 
be repeated.  
7.13 Safety Assessments  
7.13.1  Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be conducted at screening  and baseline (Day 1) ; at Week s 
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12/ET for Group 1 and at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16/ET for Group 2 ; 
and at the follow -up visit. A complete physical examination will include evaluation of general 
appearance, HEENT (head, eyes, ears,  nose, throat), as well as dermatologic, cardiovascular, 
respiratory, gastrointestinal, extremities/  musculoskeletal, and neurologic body systems.  
Height will be measured  at the screening visit  only.  
7.13.2  Vital Sign  Measurement s 
Vital signs include BP, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oral body temperature. Blood pressure 
and heart  rates will be obtained in the dominant arm (writing arm), if possible, with the patient  in 
a sitting position after resting for approximately 5 minutes. Automated BP machines can be used 
to standardize measurements.  Vital signs will be collected in the clinic at screening  and baseline 
(Day 1 ); at Week s 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12/ET for Group 1  and at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and

all patients at screening and  by patient s in the hypertensi on subgroup at post -screening time 
points to assess the effect of CORT125134 on BP (see Section  7.11.1.2 ).  
7.13.3  Electrocardiogram  
Twelve -lead ECG tracings will be o btained in triplicate from all patient s at screening  and in 
duplicate  at Week s 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12/ET for Group 1  and at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 
16/ET for Group 2 , and the follow -up visit.  Patient s should be lying down for at least 10 minutes 
prior to each ECG evaluation. A central reviewer will be used; instruction will be provided in the 
study manual .  
At Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and ET, the ECG should be performed  2 hours  (±30 minutes)  
after study drug dosing.   
The Investigator or designee will indicate  on the site ’s copy  whether the ECG was normal, 
abnormal but not clinically significant, or abnormal and clinically significant. Any new or 
worsened abnormality noted as clinically significant will be reported as an AE.  
7.13.4  Pregnancy Tests  and Contraception Methods   
All female patient s of childbearing potential ( including all women  <50 years old, women whose  
surgical sterilization  was performed  <6 months ago , and women who have had a menstrual 
period in the last 2 years)  will take pregnancy tests at every visit from screening through follow -
up. The screening pregnancy test will be  a blood test. All subsequent pregnancy tests will be 
urine tests.  
Female patient s of child bearing potential are required to use a highly effective method of 
contraception from 30 days prior to Day 1 to 30 days following the last dose of study drug 
administration. Male patients with female partners are required to use t o use 2 forms of 
contraception, one of which is a double -barrier method , from Day 1 (prior to study drug 
administration) until 30 days following the last dose of study drug administration .  
Highly effective forms of contraception include:  
• Abstinence  
• Surgi cal sterilization  
• Intrauterine device or intrauterine system  
• Oral contraception plus a barrier method   
• Double -barrier method ( eg, male condom or a diaphragm p lus a vaginal spermicidal 
cream ) 
If a patient  is usually not sexually active but becomes active, they, with their partner, must 
comply with the contraceptive requirements detailed above. In addition, males should not donate 
sperm until 30 days after the last dose of study drug.

14, and 16/ET for Group 2 ; and the follow -up visit. Laboratory samples will be analyzed at one 
or more central laboratories.  
Laboratory values  for an analyte  that are out side of the normal range for that analyte per the 
applicable central laboratory will be identified and can be repeated at the Investigator ’s 
discretion. The Investigator  will determine if any out -of-range laboratory values that emerge 
during the s tudy are clin ically significant . An abnormal laboratory value that leads to a dose 
modification or patient withdrawal from the study will be recorded as an AE on the eCRF. Other 
clinically significant laboratory values may be reported as AEs at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  Patient s with a clinically significant out -of-range laboratory value will be followed 
until the  laboratory value  return s to normal, or become s medically stable. The Investigator  will 
treat the patient  as medically required at appropriate interv als until this occurs.  
The Investigator  will review  all laboratory reports , evaluat e the results, and sign/date the report.  
Safety laboratory measurements will include the following:  
Chemistry:  
• Full chemistry profile : albumin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, blood urea nitrogen, 
calcium, chloride, cholesterol, creatinine, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, magnesium, 
phosphorus, potassium, sodium, total creatin e kinase, total and direct bilirubin, total 
protein, uric acid  
Hematology:  
• Complete blood count: hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean 
corpuscular hemoglobin volume, mean corpuscular volume, mean platelet volume, 
platelet count, red blood cell distribution width, red blood cell (RBC ) count, and 
WBC  count  
• Differential: percent and absolute for the following: basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, 
monocytes, and neutrophils

respectively.  
7.13.6  Safety  Event  Documentation and Reporting  
7.13.6.1  Investigator’s Responsibilities  
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of patients who have entered this study 
and for providing appropriate medical care. Investigators are required to report promptly to 
Clinical Study Protocol CORT125134 -451 
Confidential  Page 63 of 109  
Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  Corcept Therapeutics or its designee any AE that may reasonably be regarded as caused by, or 
probably caused by, the study drug. If the adverse effect is alarming, the Investigator should 
report the adverse effect immediately. In addition, the Investigators are responsible for alerting 
Corcept Therapeutics or its designee  to any event that seems unusual, even if the event may be 
considered an unanticipated benefit to the patient, and for reporting the event on the appropriate 
eCRF or safety report form.  
By exercising appropriate health care options, the Investigator remains  responsible for managing 
AEs that are serious or that cause a patient to withdraw before completing the study. Frequency 
of follow -up of any particular AE is left to the discretion of the Investigator. Duration of follow -
up and requirements for immediate  SAE reporting (within 24 hours of the event) are described 
below.  
7.13.6.2  Monitoring Safety Data During Study  
Safety results collected during the study (eg, AEs, laboratory test results, physical findings) will 
be monitored on an ongoing basis by the Medical Monit or and Investigator.  
7.13.6.3  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study patient administered a pharmaceutical 
product, which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An 
AE can therefore be  any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product that emerges  or 
worsens relative to the patient’s pretreatment baseline, whether or not it is considered to be 
related to the investigational product.  
Illnesses present before the patient signs the informed consent form (ICF) are considered 
pre-existing conditions an d are documented on the medical history eCRF. Pre -existing conditions 
that worsen during the study are entered on the AE eCRF.  
7.13.6.4  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following criteria:  
• Results in death (ie, the AE cau sed or led to the fatality).  
• Is life -threatening (ie, the AE refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe).  
• Requires  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (ie, hospitalizations 
for scheduled treatments and elective medical/surgical procedures are not SAEs by this 
criterion).  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (ie, the AE res ults in substantial 
reduction of the patient’s ability to perform activities of daily living).  
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect (ie., an adverse finding in a child or fetus 
of a patient exposed to the study medication before conception or du ring pregnancy);  
• Involves other medically important conditions (ie, the AE does not meet any of the above 
serious criteria but based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient or

these criteria).  
7.13.6.5  Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events  
All out -of-range laboratory values will be determined to be clinically significant or not clinically 
significant by the Investigator. An abnormal laboratory value that leads  to a dose modification or 
patient withdrawal from the study will be recorded as an AE on the eCRF.  Other clinically 
significant laboratory values may be reported as AEs at the discretion of the Investigator.  
7.13.6.6  Documentation of Adverse Events  
Patients will b e evaluated and questioned to identify AEs during the study.  
Collection of AEs will start immediately following signing of the ICF and will continue 
throughout the study. Illnesses present before the patient signs the informed consent form (ICF) 
are consi dered pre -existing conditions and are documented on the medical history eCRF. 
Pre-existing conditions that worsen during the study are entered on the AE eCRF. Adverse 
events that occur after start of study treatment and up to and including 28  days after 
administration of the last dose of study drug will be considered TEAEs . Any AEs reported more 
than 28  days after the last dose of study drug will be considered posttreatment AEs.  
All AEs will be documented on the AE eCRF a nd in the patient’s medical record . The following 
attributes must be assigned : (1) description, (2) dates of onset and resolution, (3)  severity  (see 
Section 7.13.6.7.1 ), (4) relationship to the study medication (see Section 7.13.6.7.2 ), 
(5) “serious” criteria if applicable (see Section  7.13.6.4 ), and (6)  action taken. The Investigator 
will actively solicit this information and assess the AEs in terms of severity and relationship to 
study  drug. The Investigator will treat the patient as medically required until the AE either 
resolves or becomes medically stable. This treatment may extend beyond the duration of the 
study. The Investigator will record treatment and medications required for t reatment on the 
appropriate eCRF(s).  
In the event that a patient is withdrawn from the study because of an AE, the event must be 
recorded on the Termination eCRF as the reason for discontinuation.  
All AEs considered to be related (see Section 7.13.6.7.2 ) to study drug and all SAEs will be 
followed until resolved or until a stable status has been achieved.  
All AEs that are drug -related and  unexpected (not reported in the Investigator’s Brochure or if 
the event is of greater severity or frequency than that described in the Investigator’s Brochure) 
must be reported to the governing IRB/ Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) as required by the 
IRB/IEC, local regulations, and the  governing health authorities.  
7.13.6.7  Adverse Event Classification  
7.13.6.7.1  Severity Grades of Adverse Events  
The seriousness of an AE should not be confused with its severity . To describe the maximum 
severity  of the AE on the AE eCRF, the  Investigator will use the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03 ( CTCAE 2010 ). For 
Clinical Study Protocol CORT125134 -451 
Confidential  Page 65 of 109  
Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  events not listed in the CTCAE, the definitions from the CTCAE provided in Table 5 should be 
used to evaluate the grade of severity for the AE.   
Table 5 Adverse Event Grades Based on the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse  Events  
Grade  Description  
1 Mild : asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated  
2 Moderate : minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrume ntal activities of daily living (eg, preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using 
the telephone, and managing money)  
3 Severe : severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitaliz ation indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living (eg, 
bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden)  
4 Life-threatening : Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
5 Death : Death related to AE

(CTCAE 2010 ). 
 
7.13.6.7.2  Relationship of Adverse Event to Study Drug or Procedure  
The Investigator responsible for the patient’s care (or qualified designee) will assess causality of 
AEs and SAEs based on the causal attribution guidance in Table 6. The Investigator’s 
assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and nonserious).  
Table 6 Causal Attribution Guidance for Adverse Events  
Not related to study drug  An AE that is judged to be clearly due only to extraneous causes such as 
diseases, environment, and the like. The cause must be noted on the AE 
eCRF . 
Possibly related to study drug  An AE that might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time i s 
reasonable; therefore, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. An 
alternative explanation is inconclusive, eg, concomitant drug (s), 
concurrent disease (s).  
Probably related to study drug  An AE that might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is 
suggestive. An alternative explanation is less likely, eg, concomitant 
drug(s) or concurrent disease(s).  
7.13.6.8  Procedures for Reporting a Serious Adverse Event  
Any SAE occurring during the study period (beginning with informed consent) a nd for at least 
28 days after the last dose of study drug must be reported within 24 hours to the designated 
safety contact and recorded on the SAE Form. All patients with an SAE must be followed and 
the outcomes reported. The Investigator must supply the Sponsor and the IRB/IEC with any 
additional requested information (eg, autopsy reports and terminal medical reports).

Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  7.14 Pregnancy  
All pregnancies with the estimated date of conception occurr ing during the study treatment or 
within 30 days of the last dose of study treatment should be reported immediately to the Sponsor 
or its designee.   The patient will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy, and the 
outcome will be reported.  
7.14.1  Maternal Exposure  
If a patient becomes pregnant during the study, the study treatment should be discontinued 
immediately. Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE.  
If a pregnancy occurs during the study treatment or within 30 days of the last dose of stud y 
treatment, the Investigator or designee will inform the appropriate Sponsor representatives 
immediately but no later than 24 hours  of when he or she becomes aware of it. The Investigator 
or designee will ensure that all relevant information is provided to the responsible Clinical Safety 
Group.  All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported by the Investigator within 24 hours after he 
or she becomes aware of it.  
Congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spon taneous miscarriages should be reported and 
handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs. The 
outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, 
normal birth or congenital  abnormality) should be followed and documented even if the patient 
has discontinued the study.  
7.14.2  Paternal Exposure  
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE ; however, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective t ermination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) should be followed and documented , if possible . To capture information 
about a pregnancy from the partner of a male patient, the Investigator or designee must first 
obtain the consent o f the male patient’s partner. A consent form specific to this situation must be 
used. The outcome of any conception occurring from the date of the first dose of study drug until 
30 days after the last dose should be followed and documented.  
7.14.3  Prior and Conco mitant Medication s 
At screening, a list of current medications will be obtained, including start date, dosage, and 
route of administration, along with any medications taken in the 3 months before screening to 
treat Cushing’s syndrome, diabetes, or hyperten sion.  
Concomitant medications are defined as any prescription or over-the-counter medication, herbal 
preparations, and vitamin and/or mineral supplements that the patient  began or continued in the 
period starting with the first dose of study medication on Day 1 and ending at the follow -up visit. 
Medications that the patient  started and ended before the first dose of study drug will be  noted as 
prior medications.  
Information about concomitant medications will be collected from all patient s at each visit  from 
screening through the follow -up visit . Any changes in medications since the last visit will be 
captured and recorded .

Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  7.14.4  Additional Assessments for Special Safety Events  
7.14.4.1  Monitoring for Excessive Glucocorticoid Receptor Blockade  
Based on the mechanism of ac tion of CORT125134, there is a theoretical risk of excessive GR 
blockade, which could manifest with findings such as weakness, tiredness, dizziness, 
hypoglycemia, dehydration, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and muscle aches. Since 
CORT125134 does not block the mineralocorticoid receptor, it is unlikely that hypotension 
would be seen in the absence of anti -hypertensive medication.  
At each study visit starting with the baseline visit, patients will be evaluated for signs and 
symptoms of excessive GR blockade , and  for patients who experience symptoms, the following 
actions should be taken:  
• CORT125134 treatment should be immediately interrupted  for at least 3 days and 
standard supportive care, including fluid resuscitation, as indicated, should be 
admi nistered without delay.  
• Supplemental glucocorticoid s may be given in high doses to overcome the GR blockade 
produced by CORT125134. Initially, parenteral dexamethasone 4 to 10 mg should be 
considered, followed by additional parenteral or oral doses once o r twice daily for 1 to 3 
days and tapered thereafter, depending on clinical response. In some cases, higher doses 
of dexamethasone for longer pe riods of time may be required.  
• If the patient has been receiving treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor an tagonist, 
consideration should be given to discontinuing it or adjusting the dose, particularly in the 
presence of hypotension .  
• Treatment with CORT125134 should be resumed only if the Investigator believes that the 
potential benefits outweigh the risks an d after  a discussion with the Medical Monitor . 
Dosing may be resumed at the lowest tolerable dose previously administered to the 
patient s. For patients in Group 2 on 2 50 mg/day, the dose may be reduced to 200 mg/day 
or 150 mg/day, as deemed appropriate by the Investigator. After 2  weeks, the dose may 
be maintained at the current dose or may be increased by 50 mg  with the approval of the 
Medical Monitor. (Subsequent dose escalations at Week 4 or Week 8 must also be 
approved by the Medical Monitor.)  
 
Note: In  the event of significant trauma, surgery, or medical illness occurring at any time during 
the study (through 2 weeks after last dose), supplemental glucocorticoids may be needed to 
offset the GR blockade even in patients not experiencing signs and symptom s of excessive 
blockade. After resolution of the physiological stress associated with the event, CORT125134 
can be reinitiated at the last dose level the patient was receiving prior to interruption of dosing, if 
the dosing period of the study has not ended . 
At study enrollment, all patient s will be given a card to carry with them that identifies their 
potential risk for excessive GR blockade. The card will contain the following information:  
• Mention of CORT125134 use ( “glucocorticoid receptor antagonist ”) 
• Potential need for glucocorticoid use in setting of shock, surgery, or serious illness or 
injury

Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  • Recommended dose of replacement steroids (4–10 mg dexamethasone i ntramuscularly or 
intravenously)  
• Investigator contact information  
7.14.4.2  Monitoring for Hypokalemia  
If a patient develops hypokalemia  during the study, oral replacement of potassium (40 -120 mEq 
per day) should be considered. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as spironolactone or 
other potassium -sparing diuretics, may be initiated or increased t o control persistent hypokalemia 
and associated elevated BP or edema. If daily oral potassium replacement, mineralocorticoid 
receptor  antagonism, or other potassium -sparing diuretics are insufficient, the CORT125134 
dose can be decreased to the lower dose,  if applicable, or study drug should be discontinued if 
the patient is on the lowest dose of CORT125134. If oral administration of potassium is not 
feasible or cardiac complications of hypokalemia exist, intravenous potassium replacement may 
be required an d may necessitate cardiac telemetry.  
7.14.4.3  Hypertension  
Patient s who develop hypertension while on study drug should have the diagnosis confirmed by 
ambulatory BP monitoring.  In addition, the patient should be examined for edema and potassium 
levels should be c hecked.   
7.15 Early Study Discontinuation  
If a patient withdraws from the study before completing the Week 12 visit, he or she should be 
asked to return for an ET visit, at which all Week 12  assessments (Section 8.14) will be 
performed.  
The patient will be asked to also return for a follow -up visit 4 weeks after the ET visit has been 
completed.  In both Group 1 and Group 2, patients who discontinue study e arly may be replaced 
to ensure that :  
• 12 patients per group provide steady -state PK data through Week 10  
• 15 patients provide safety and efficacy data through Week 10.  
 
The Medical Monitor should be notified of patient discontinuations from the study.  
7.16 Remo val of Patients  from Treatment or Assessment  
Study drug treatment will be discontinued early if any of the following events occur:  
• Evidence of excessive GR blockade based on a combination of the following Grade 3 or 
higher events: fatigue, anorexia, nause a and vomiting (associated with decreased oral 
intake), and abdominal pain, seen either at the 100-mg dose level or at other dose levels 
for which the investigator deems dose reduction is not an option (refer to Section 7.14.4.1  
for monitoring for excessive glucocorticoid receptor blockade ) 
• Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as systolic BP >170 mmHg or diastolic 
BP >110  mmHg (as confirmed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) despite the use 
of appropriate antihypertension medications.  
Clinical Study Protocol CORT125134 -451 
Confidential  Page 70 of 109  
Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  • Severe (<2.5 mEq/L) hypokalemia and/or persistent hypokalemia that does not respond to 
replacement of potassium and MR antagonists or other potassium spar ing diuretics.  
Confirmed  QTcF  >500 ms. If QTcF is >500 ms, another ECG should be repeated within 
24 hours and after any coexistent electrolyte abnormality is corrected. If a medication 
known to cause QTc prolongation has been started , it should be disconti nued and  the 
ECG should be repeated . If QTc prolongation persists, based on the average of at least 
2 ECGs, the patient should be discontinued.

Most assessments are for all patients; a few are performed only in patients in a specific subgroup . 
Note that a patient can be in the impaired glucose tolerance/ diabet es subgroup , the hypertensi on 
subgroup , or both.  
For patients who roll over  from Group 1 to Group 2 : 
• There will not be a treatment completion visit in between Group 1 and Group 2 study 
visits.  
• The Week 12 visit will serve as the new baseline visit  for the Group 2 treatment period  
• The safety follow -up visit for Group 1 (Week 16) is not necessary

Note:   Patients requiring washout of a medication for Cushing’s syndrome must complete the 
screening/baseline 24 -hour UFC tests, salivary cortisol tests, oGTT s, and 24 -hour ambulatory BP 
monitoring test s after a minimum washout  of 2 weeks for adrenostatic medications and short -
acting somatostatin analogs, 4 weeks for mifepristone and dopamine agonist s, and 6 weeks for 
long-acting somatostatin ligands and within 3 weeks before Day 1  dosing .

Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  9 QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
This study will be performed and reported in compliance with Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ), the 
protocol, applicable standard operating procedures, and applicable regulations . To ensure 
compliance, the Sponsor may conduct a quality assurance audit.  
Prior to  selection of the study site(s), a site evaluation visit(s) will be performed to review the 
adequacy of the facility (ies), personnel, and their ability to conduct research. A site initiation 
visit and/or Investigator ’s meeting will be held prior to study start-up to train the Investigator s 
and study coordinators on the protocol, source document and eCRF completion, safety, study 
drug handling, sample handling, and to review GCP.  
This study will use eCRFs designed to allow capture and record ing of  all proto col-required 
information for each patient . All eCRFs will be completed by the clinic staff , and all completed 
eCRFs will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator , as noted by his or her electronic signature, 
prior to review by the clinical m onitor or desi gnated representative. The clinical monitor  or 
designated representative will review all source records on  site and compare them to the data 
collected on the eCRF.  
Data will be entered into a clinical database as specified in the Sponsor ’s/contract researc h 
organization ’s data management plan. Quality control and data validation procedures will be 
applied to ensure the validity and accuracy of the clinical database. Data will be reviewed and 
checked for omissions, apparent errors, and values requiring furth er clarification using 
computerized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring clarification will be communicated 
to the investigational site for resolution. Only authorized personnel will make corrections to the 
clinical database, and all corrections w ill be documented in an audit trail.  
Assay of clinical safety laboratory samples and any other samples will be performed by certified 
laboratories using validated analytical methods .

Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  10 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
10.1 General Considerations  
The statistical analys is will be conducted by the Sponsor and/or its designee. Statistical methods 
will be prespecified and documented in detail in a Statistical Analysis Plan, to be finalized prior 
to database lock.  
All summaries will be presented by starting dose group , regar dless of the actual dose level at the 
time point associated with the data collection. In addition, data will be tabulated for all patient s 
combined. All relevant data collected on the eCRF will be presented in by -patient data listings, 
to include the site identifier, patient  number, and starting dose group . Listing presenting study 
data over time will include the dose level the patient  received at the time of data collection.  In 
addition to summary tables by dosing group and by -patient data listings, indivi dual patient 
profiles will be generated to list and display graphically key study endpoints over time.  
In general, continuous variables will be summarized by the number of patients with non -missing 
data, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maxim um values. Categorical variables 
will be summarized by the number and percentage of patients in each category.  
Predose measurements on Day 1 will be considered the primary baseline values. If a Day 1 
predose value is not available, the screening measurement may be used as the baseline value.  
Select analyses may also assess changes from the last measurement prior to escalation to the 
current dose level received. Additionally, patients  in Group 1 who continue treatment as part of 
Group 2 may have da ta collected while receiving Group 2 dosing summarized as a change 
relative to their last measurement collected prior to dosing as part of Group 1 (ie, the Group 1 
baseline value).  
10.2 Analysis Population  
The analysis population for all efficacy and safety ana lyses will include all patients who received 
at least  one dose of study drug. As defined in the PK analysis plan, t he PK analysis population 
will comprise all patients who have evaluable PK data.  
For all analyses, the patient will be included in the dose group in which he or she was enrolled , 
regardless of actual dose level at the time point when the data were collected.  
Select efficacy endpoints will be analyzed by subgroup only:  
• Patients with impaired glucose tolerance/diabetes  
• Patients with hypertensio n  
All enrolled patients will belong to at least one of these subgroups and an individual patient may 
be included in both. If a patient enters the study with hypertension but takes an additional 
antihypertensive medication or increases the dosage of a conc urrent antihypertensive medication, 
that patient will be classified as a nonresponder  (see Section 10.6 for definition of response for 
each subgrou p). If a patient enters the study with diabetes/impaired glucose tolerance but takes 
an additional diabetes medication or increases the dosage of a concurrent diabetes medication, 
that patient will be classified as a nonresponder.

Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  10.3 Patient  Disposition  
Patient  disposition information will be summarized by dose group  and overall. Summaries will 
include the number of enroll ed patient s, the number of patient s in each analysis population, the 
number of patient s in each subgroup, the number of patient s comple ting the study per protocol, 
and the number of patient s terminating the study early by the primary reason for discontinuation.  
10.4 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic variables will include age at the time of informed consent, sex, ethnicity a nd race. 
Other baseline characteristics will include relevant medical history and baseline disease 
characteristics (eg, time since diagnosis, Cushing ’s syndrome type). Demographic and baseline 
characteristics will be summarized for all treated patients and  presented separately by subgroup, 
by dose group , and overall.  
10.5 Concomitant Medications  
Verbatim terms on eCRFs will be mapped to Anatomical/Therapeutic Chemical class and 
Generic Drug Names using the most current version of the World Health Organization Dr ug 
Dictionary. Concomitant medications will be summarized for all treatment patients by dose 
group  and overall.  
10.6 Efficacy Analyses  
The key efficacy assessments in this study are the evaluation of the glucose tolerance in the 
impaired glucose tolerance/diabe tes subgroup and BP in the hypertensive subgroup. All other 
efficacy variables are considered exploratory.  
Responder endpoints for each subgroup as defined below will be summarized separately for the 
following patient  analysis sets:  
• Group 1 patient s, where responder status is determined based on the Group 1 baseline 
value;  
• Group 2 patient s, where responder status is determined based on the Group 2 baseline 
value;  
• Group 2 patient s, where responder status is determined based on the Group 1 baseline 
value  for those patient s who were also enrolled and treated in Group 1, and the Group 2 
baseline value for those patient s who were not enrolled in Group 1;  
• Group 2 patient s who were not enrolled and treated in Group 1, where responder status is 
determined based  on the Group 2 baseline value;  
• Group 2 patient s who were also enrolled and treated in Group 1, where responder status 
is determined based on the Group 2 baseline value.  
10.6.1  Impaired Glucose Tolerance/Diabetes Subgroup  
The area under the concentration -time cur ve for glucose (AUC glucose ) will be calculated based on 
results of the oGTTs  from baseline to Week 12/ET  in Group 1 or Week 16/ET in Group 2 , for 
those patient s with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes at study entry. A responder will be 
defined as a patient who experiences at least a 25% decrease  from baseline  in AUC glucose  who has 
not taken an additional diabetes medication during the treatment period or increased the dosage 
Clinical Study Protocol CORT125134 -451 
Confidential  Page 87 of 109  
Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  of a concurrent diabetes medication.  The number and percentage of patient s who are responders 
will be presented by dose group  and for all patients, along with the 95% binomial exact 
confidence interval.  
AUC glucose  will be su mmarized by descriptive statistics by dose group  and for all patients. In 
addition, plasma glucose, HbA1c , fructosamine, and adiponectin concentrations will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics by visit, time point, and dose group , to include the 
change from baseline  and change from the last measurement collected prior to escalation to the 
current dose level at each visit and time point . Plots of the mean plasma glucose values over time 
will be presented.  
The number and percentage of patients whose dose of medications that lower blood glucose 
decreased, stayed the same, or increased from baseline to Week  12/ET  in Group 1 or Week 
16/ET in Group 2  will be summarized, among those patients taking such medications at baseline.  
10.6.2  Hypertensi on Subgroup  
Changes in mean diastolic BP and systolic BP  measured by 24 -hour ambulatory BP monitoring 
will be analyzed for patients with hypertension at study entry. A responder will be defined as a 
patient  who experiences at least a 5 mmHg decrease in mean diastolic or systolic BP from 
baseline to Week  12/ET  in Group 1 or Week 16/ET in Group 2 who has not taken an additional 
antihypertensive medication during the treatment period or increased the dosage of a concurrent 
antihypertensive medication . The number and percentage of patient s who are responders will be 
presented by dose group  and for all patients, along with the 95% bin omial exact confidence 
interval.  
Diastolic and systolic BP will be summarized using descriptive statistics by visit, time point, and 
dose group , to include the change from baseline and change from the last measurement collected 
prior to escalation to the current dose level at each visit and time point.  
The number and percentage of patients whose dose of antihypertensive medication decreased, 
stayed the same, or increased from baseline to Week 12/ET in Group 1 or Week 16/ET in Group 
2 will be summarized, among those patients taking such medications at baseline.  
10.6.3  Other Measures of Efficacy  
Other measures of efficacy will be summarized for all patien ts receiving treatment, regardless of 
indication at study treatment, by dose group , and for all patients.  
Results for efficacy variables from data collection, including body weight and body composition  
by quality  of life, 24 -hour UFC, salivary cortisol, st rength scores, lipid panel, coagulation, 
hormonal and menstrual cycle, bone laboratory parameters, and high-sensitivity C-reactive 
protein will be summarized using descriptive statistics by parameter, visit, and time point, to 
include the changes from base line. 
10.7 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
The details of PK analysis will be outlined in a separate document . 
Clinical Study Protocol CORT125134 -451

Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  10.8 Safety Analyses  
Adverse events will be mapped to system organ classes and preferred terms using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Tr eatment -emergent AEs  are defined as those 
that start or worsen after the start of study treatment and up to 28 days after the last dose of study 
treatment.  
Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized overall and by dose group  and displayed by system 
organ c lass and preferred term. Treatment -emergent AEs will be further summarized by severity 
and relationship to study treatment. At each level of summation, patients will be counted only 
once, under the greatest severity and strongest study -drug relationship (a s reported by the 
Investigator ).  
All AEs (whether TEAEs or not) will be listed by individual patient, including information 
regarding onset, duration, severity, and relationship to study drug. Serious AEs and AEs that led 
to withdrawal from the study will  be listed by individual patient.  
Clinical laboratory test results (chemistry  and hematology), vital sign measurements, and ECG 
interval results will be summarized overall and for each dose group  by parameter, visit, and time 
point using descriptive stati stics, to include the change from baseline values. Shift tables will be 
constructed that describe changes from baseline to the end of treatment in clinical laboratory 
values.  
10.9 Determination of Sample Size  
The study is not powered for formal hypothesis test ing. The Sponsor has deemed 30 patients 
(15 per dose group ) as a sufficient number to evaluate efficacy and safety/tolerability and to 
establish point estimates for efficacy endpoints for future evaluation of the study drug.

Confidential  Page 90 of 109  
Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  11.4 Patient  Confidentiality  
To maintain patient  privacy, all source documents, study reports, and communications will 
identify the patient  by initials and the assigned patient  number . The Investigator will grant 
monitor(s) and auditor(s) from the Sponsor or its designee and regulatory authority (ies) access 
to the patient ’s original study records for verification of data gathered on source documents and 
to audit the data collection process . The patient ’s confidentiality will be maintained and will not 
be made publicly available to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations.  
11.5 Study Monitoring  
Monitoring of the study site (including, but not limited to, reviewing eCRFs for accurac y and 
completeness, and assessing compliance with the protocol and adherence to regulatory and GCP 
requirements) will be performed by the Sponsor ’s Clinical Monitor or designee . Monitoring will 
be performed in accordance with applicable federal regulations  and guidance . Monitoring 
methods, responsibilities, and requirements will be outlined in a monitoring plan.  
11.6 Case Report Forms and Study Records  
The Investigator must generate and maintain adequate and accurate records to enable full 
documentation of study  conduct . Study data will be captured on eCRFs . Investigators must retain 
all original source documents.  
11.7 Access to Source Documentation  
The Sponsor or its representative will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigational 
facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study . The Investigator  agrees to allow 
the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug accountability records, 
patient  charts and source documents, and other records relative to study conduct.  
By signing the protocol, the Principal Investigator agrees that, within local regulatory restrictions 
and institutional and ethical considerations, authorized representatives of the Sponsor, a 
regulatory authority, and/or an IRB/IEC may visit the site to p erform audits or inspections, 
including the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug accountability records, patient  charts and 
source documents, and other records relative to study conduct . The purpose of a Sponsor audit or 
inspection is to systematical ly and independently examine all study -related activities and 
documents (eg, laboratory reports, x -rays, workbooks, patient s’ medical records) to determine 
whether these activities were conducted, and data recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported 
accord ing to the protocol, GCP guidelines of the ICH, and any applicable regulatory 
requirements .  
The Investigator  should contact the Sponsor immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency 
regarding an inspection.  
11.8 Protocol Deviations  
The Investigator  should no t implement any deviation from the protocol without prior review and 
agreement by the Sponsor and in accordance with the IEC/IRB and local regulations, except 
when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study patient s. When a deviation from the 
protocol is deemed necessary for an individual patient, the Investigator  must contact the Medical 
Clinical Study Protocol CORT125134 -451 
Confidential  Page 91 of 109  
Version 7.0, 15 January 2018  Monitor . Such contact must be made as soon as possible to permit a review by the Sponsor to 
determine the impact of the deviation on the patient and/or the study.  Any significant protocol 
deviations affecting patient eligibility and/or safety must be reviewed and/or approved by the 
IEC/IRB and regulatory authorities, as applicable, prior to implementation.  
11.9 Records Retention  
The Principal Investigator  must maintain all documentation relating to the study for a period of 
2 years after the last marketing application approval, or if not approved 2 years following the 
discontinuance of the test article for investigation . If it becomes necessary for the Sponsor or the 
regulatory authority to review any documentation relating to the study, the Investigator must 
permit access to such records.  
11.10  Financial Disclosure  
Investigators will be required to disclose any financial equity interests in the Sponsor and any 
conflicts of interest, as defined by the Sponsor .  
11.11  Publication and Disclosure Policy  
Corcept as the Sponsor, has a proprietary interest in this study. Authorship and manuscript 
composition will reflect joint cooperation between multiple Investigators and sites and Corc ept 
personnel. Authorship will be established before writing of the manuscript. Because this study 
involves multiple centers, no individual publications will be allowed before completion of the 
final report of the multicenter study except as agreed with Co rcept.

Note: Collect pituitary MRI radiographic scans and assessments in patients with Cushing disease that are obtained up to 6 months before Day 1 and up to 1 month after last CORT1 25134 dose if they 
are available.  
a For patients rolling over from Group 1 to Group 2, the Group 1 Week 12 visit will serve as the baseline visit for their Group 2 treatment period.  
b This visit is not necessary for patients who roll over from Group 1 to Group 2.  
c Medications used in the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome are prohibited and require washout (as applicable) during screening p rovided the intervals specified in Exclusion Criterion 14 fit within the 
screening window. Patients requiring washout  of a medication for Cushing’s syndrome must complete the screening/baseline 24 -hour UFC tests, salivary cortisol tests, oGTT s, and 24 -hour 
ambulatory BP monitori ng test s after washout and within 3 weeks before Day 1  dosing .  
d Medication history only for medications taken to treat Cushing’s syndrome, hypertension, or diabetes within 3 months before s creenin g. 
e Dexamethasone suppression test only if needed for study entry.  
f Within 7  days before  the Week 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12  visits, samples will be collected by the patient at home twice for each time point .  
g The 24 -hour UFC will be collected by the patient at home at  least two times and up to four times during screening. For screening, the  average of the results will serve as “baseline”.   
h Salivary cortisol test will be  performed by the patient at home at least two and up to four times on different nights during screening.  The average of the results will  serve as “baseline”.  
i oGTTs during the Treatment Period (including on Day 1) will be performed in the impaired glucose tolerance/diabetes subgroup only.  During the 2 -hour oGTT, blood samples for plasma glucose 
and insulin will be collected before the glu cose drink and 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 hours after the glucose drink.  
j The 24 -hour ambulatory BP will be assessed for all patients during the screening period. For the subgroup of patients who qualify fo r the hypertension subgroup, there must be a 24 -hour ambu latory 
BP test done within 3 weeks before Day 1; this result will be used as “ baseline”. If the initial screening test was done within 3 weeks before Day 1, it does not need to be repeated . Ambulatory BP 
measurements during the Treatment Period will be performed in the hypertension subgroup only.  
k Not required to be collected at screening if results available within 3 months of  first dose of study drug at baseline/Day 1 .  
l Total cholesterol, low -density lipoprotein -cholesterol, high -density lipoprotein -cholesterol, very low -density lipoprotein -cholesterol, and triglycerides.

CORT125134 -451 Study Participant Information Card  
_____________________________ is a participant in a clinical trial for Cushing ’s syndrome.  
Name  
This participant was, and may still be, receiving CORT125134, a glucocorticoid antagonist 
which blocks the effects of the hormone cortisol. This individual may be at increased risk for 
the development of excessive glucocorticoid receptor (GR) blockade. He/She may require 
supplemental treatment w ith glucocorticoids in the setting of shock, surgery, or serious illness 
or injury (eg, infection, fracture, bleeding). In such cases, administration of dexamethasone  
(4–10 mg intravenously  or intramuscularly ), fluid resuscitation, and supportive medical care 
should be administered. Additional glucocorticoid should be continued and adjusted according 
to the clinical course.  
In case of suspected excessive GR blockade, please contact the investigator/study physician 
immediately at :

• The lists of assessments  (especially Section 7 and 
Section 8 and the Schedule of Assessments ): 
– The addition of 4 weeks of CORT125134 
treatment to all descriptions of Group 2  dosing 
and administration  (eg, the addition of “then 400 
mg/day for 4 weeks”  to “250 mg/day for 
4 weeks, then 300 mg/day for 4  weeks, 
then 350 mg/day for 4  weeks ”) 
– The addition of the assessment time points for 
Group  2 (eg, “ For Group 2, blood levels of 
CORT125134 and metabolites will be measured 
predose and at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8  hours postdose at 
Weeks 2, 6, 10, and 14, and predose only at

  Protocol Synopsis  
“THE AMBULATE  TRIAL” 
A MULTI-CENTER , RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE CARDIVA 
MID-BORE VENOUS VASCU LAR CLOSURE SYSTEM (VVCS)  VS. MANUAL COMPRESSION FOR THE MANAGEMENT 
OF THE FEMORAL VENOTOMY AFTER CATHETER -BASED INTERVENTIONS PERFORMED VIA 6- 12 FR PROCEDURAL 
SHEATHS WITH SINGLE OR MULTIPLE ACCESS SITES PER LIMB 
 
Primary Objective  The objective of the trial is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the 
Cardiva Mid-Bore  Venous Vascular Closure  System (VVCS) in sealing femoral 
venous a ccess sites and providing reduced times to ambulation (TTA) compared 
with manual compression at the completion of catheter -based procedures 
performed through 6 – 12 Fr introducer sheaths.  
Test Device  Cardiva Mid-Bore Venous Vascular Closure System (VVCS) – 6-12 Fr device with  21 
Fr Disc (~7 mm)  
Indication  
for Use  The Cardiva Mid-Bore Venous Vascular Closure System (VVCS) is indicated for the 
percutaneous closure of femoral venous access sites while reducing times to 
ambulation and discharge eligibility in patients who have undergone catheter -
based procedures utilizing 6 – 12 Fr procedu ral sheaths, with single or multiple 
access sites per limb, ranging from a single access site in one limb to multiple 
access sites in both limbs.  
Hypothesis  The Cardiva Mid-Bore VVCS provides TTA results that are less than manual 
compression by a clinically meaningful and statistically significant margin.  The 
rate of major venous access site closure -related complications with the Cardiva  
Mid-Bore  VVCS is non -inferior to the major complication rates of manual 
compression for sealing femoral venous access sites.  
Study Design  A prospective, randomized, controlled multi -center clinical trial designed to 
evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the study device in sealing multiple 
femoral venous access sites and provid ing reduced times to ambulation co mpared 
with manual compression at the completion of catheter -based procedures 
performed through 6 - 12 Fr introducer sheaths.    
Only patients with multiple access sites will be enrolled in order to support the 
desired indication. Randomization will be str atified to account for patients with 
varying numbers of access sites in a 1:1 treatment device to control arm ratio to 
ensure treatment and control arms have the same proportion of access 
sites/patient, i.e. 3 access sites/patient vs. 4 access sites/patien t.  
Number of Patients  Approximately 204 prospectively randomized subjects, and up to 60 roll -in 
subjects  
Number of Sites  Up to 20 sites U.S., with a minimum of 8 sites enrolling subjects  in the trial .

  Duration of Trial  Each enrolled subject will have an office visit at 30 days (± 7 days) post -procedure.  
Once all subjects have completed this visit, the study will be considered complete.   
Ultrasound Sub -
Study  At 3-5 select sites, a  subset of 25 subjects each from  the treatment and control 
arms will have an ultrasound examination of the bilateral access sites performed 
at the 30 d ay (± 7 days) office visit.

  1. Introduction  
1.1. Background and Rationale  
Unmet Clinical Need:  
Currently, the standard technique for venous closure is manual compression  (MC) . There are various 
procedures requiring venous access, including procedures that require a single venous access site in 
a single limb up  to and including procedures that require multiple venous access sites in both limbs. 
Multi -access site / multi – limb procedures mainly include cardiac ablation .  These cardiac ablation 
procedures account for both the  fastest growing segment and majority of venous access procedures.   
Innovation in the field has progressed cardiac ablations  from many hours to a short predictable  
procedure  time , however the ongoing requirement for prolonged supine bedrest post -procedure  still 
results in lengthy delays in  time to patient ambulation (TTA) .  
 
According to Srivatsa (2015), there are certain limitations with the manual compression  approach, 
including:  
1) disco mfort and pain for the patient;  
2) postponement of sheath extraction post -procedure which could lead to more discomfort, 
increased bleeding risk and discontinuation of anti -coagulation post -procedure;  
3) risk of deep venous thrombosis; and  
4) risk of fai led closure due to inaccurate location of the manual compression site.   
 
AMBULATE, A  Clinical Investigation for Venous C losure : 
This clinical investigational study  is focused on multiple access site venous closure using the Cardiva 
Mid-Bore VVCS  device  for closure in these procedures to provide the best potential improvement in 
TTA over current standard of care  and to address the greatest clinical need . 
  
Femoral Arterial vs. V enous  Closure:  
While a variety of closure device options exist for femoral arterial closure, there are few closure device 
options for venous closure.  Procedures requiring venous access such as venous stenting  (single access 
site) , cardiac ablation  (multi -access site) , DVT treatments  (single access site) , etc., are growing. 
Cardiva asserts that there is a need for developing percutaneous closure of venous access in patients.  
Characteristics in the venous environment, such as lower blood velocity and pressure compared to 
arteries, can contribute to patient complications such as DVT due to reduced blood flow directly, e.g. , 
manual compression, and indirectly e.g. , prolonged bedrest.  Vascular closure devices with 
intraluminal components could also contribute to reduction in  blood flow and/or increased risk of 
thrombosis. The use of such a closure device may  be undesirable for venous closure.

Applicability of the VASCADE ® Arterial VCS as a platform:  
The previously approved VASCADE VCS [P120016]1 is indicated for percutaneous closure of femoral 
arteries using 5 to 7F procedural sheaths.   
The Cardiva Mid-Bore VVCS platform  for venous use, based on the proven design of the arterial 
VASCADE VCS , is particularly promising in venous closure due to the  following : 
o Unimpeded, continual blood flow during closure and bedrest  
o No intraluminal components post closure  
o Naturally resorbed implant material  
 
VASCADE A rterial VCS RESPECT Study Overview : 
The RESPECT trial was aimed at evaluating safety and efficacy of the extravascular, bioabsorbable 
closure system, VASCADE VCS.  This was a multicenter, randomized  comparison of VASCADE versus 
Manual Compression (MC)  in D iagnostic  (Dx) and I nterventional (Ix)  patients undergoing femoral 
access through 6/7 F i ntroducer sheaths.  Subjects were randomized 2:1, VASCADE versus MC.  
Endpoints included:   
• Time to Hemostasis (TTH)  
• Time to Ambulation (TTA)  
• Discharge Eligibility (TTD E) 
• Time to Discharge (TTD)  
• Device and Procedure Success   
• Major and Minor Complications  
 
A total of 420 patients were enrolled (211 Dx, 209 Ix).  Mean age was 62 years with 29% of subjects 
being female.  For Ix patients, 77%/69% (VASCADE/MC) received bivalirudin and 8%/3% received GP 
IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Patients were followed for 30 days.  
The RESPECT trial demonstrated that the extravascular VASCADE closure device was safe and effective 
compared to manual compression in patients in whom 6 and 7 French femoral access was employed 
in Dx and Ix procedures.   Despite high percentage of Bivalirud in use (77%), there were zero major 
access site related complications in either arm.  
In addition, the use of VASCADE demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in minor access site 
related complications and significantly shortened TTH, TTA, and time to discharge eligibility (TTD E) 
when compared to MC.

  VASCADE Arterial VCS Real World E xperience for Venous C losure:  
In the Dou et al (2016) publication, real world experience utilizing the VASCADE arterial VCS for 
venous closure suggests that venous access closure can be accomplished effectively and with 
minimal complications.  
Results for device success were comparable  to the Cardiva RESPECT study , where device success 
was defined as the ability to deploy the delivery system, deliver the collagen, and achieve 
hemostasis with the Cardiva VASCADETM Vascular Closure System alone or with adjunctive 
compression:  
• Dou (2016): 100% per RESPECT criteria  
• RESPECT: 96% overall (94% diagnostic & 97% interventional)  
With respect to complications, the Dou (2016) venous study had one device -related minor 
complication per RESPECT criteria and 1 major complication unrelated to the closure device.  
It should be noted that the VASCADE arterial 6/7F device  used in Dou (2016) was successful in 
achieving temporary and final hemostasis in venotomies up to 10F, three French sizes above the 
approved  indication.    
The Cardiva Mid -Bore VVCS catheter’s disc diameter has been increased from ~19F (VASCADE 
arterial VCS) to ~21F to mitigate the device pulling through the vessel wall in mid -bore venotomies 
as a function of venotomy size approaching the disc ’s diameter.  The disc diameter increase 
anticipates use of procedure sheaths up to 12F  inner diameter.  
 
1.2. Design Verification Testing

• Functional  
• Mechanical  
• Biocompatibility  
• Packaging  
• Shelf -life  
• Sterilization  
Conclusion: Based on testing performed, Mid -Bore Venous VCS 6 – 12F successfully fulfilled the 
tests requirements for design verification.  
1.3. Pre-clinical Testing

1.4. Clinical Stud ies   
RESPECT Trial using VASCADE arterial VCS  
VASCADE 6/7 F VCS was evaluated in a prospective, multi -center, randomized (2:1) clinical trial (the 
RESPECT Trial) in 20 sites in the United States and one site in Australia, comparing VASCADE VCS to Manual 
Compression (MC). The trial involved 420 patients undergoing diagnostic (n = 211) or interventional (n = 
209) endovascular procedures , with 275 of those subjects receiving the VACADE device .  
The RESPECT trial was designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the VASCADE 6/7 Fr VCS in 
sealing femoral arterial  access sites. It was specifically designed to demonstrate a reduction in hemostasis, 
ambulation, and eligibility for hospital discharge in comparison to manual compression .   
Table 1 and Table 2 summarize safety and efficacy data from the RESPECT study.  
 Since commercial release in 2013, r eal-world experience with over 124,000 device s sold in the US , the data 
indicate s the ongoing relevance of the clinical trial results  (Table s 1, 2): 
• 0.36%  Reported Complaint Rate  
• 0.1%   Reported Patient Complication Rate  
The VASCADE VCS platform has an established safety track record in controlled clinical settings and real 
world us age.  VASCADE  VCS’s safety profile has been established in arterial vessel closure , which generally 
provides a more difficult closure environment  compared to venous closure  due to higher  blood pressure .

  1.5. Risks and Benefits  
 Risks  
Risks associated with the Cardiva Mid-Bore VVCS are similar to those associated with 
other extravascular methods of achieving hemostasis at venotomy sites.  Complications 
that may occur include:  
• Allergic response  
• Arterio -venous fistula  
• Bleeding/oozing from the puncture site  
• Bruising at puncture site  
• Death  
• Deep vein thrombosis  
• Device failure / malfunction  
• Edema  
• Embolization (thrombus, air, calcific debris, device)  
• Hematoma  
• Infection  
• Inflammatory response  
• Intimal tear / dissection  
• Laceration of the vessel wall  
• Lower extremity ischemia  
• Peripheral nerve injury  
• Perforation of the vessel wall  
• Pseudoaneurysm  
• Pulmonary embolism  
• Puncture site pain  
• Retroperitoneal bleeding  
• Vasovagal response  
• Vascular injury  
• Vessel occlusion  
• Vessel thrombus  
• Wound dehiscence  
 Benefits  
The potential benefits of the  Cardiva Mid-Bore VVCS  over manual compression alone to 
achieve venous hemostasis include reduced time to ambulation, which the  trial is 
intended to evaluate , in combination with a safety profile that is at minimum non -inferior 
to manual compression.

  1.6. Rationale for Ultrasound  Sub-study  
A sub -study of this pivotal U.S. clinical trial will be performed utilizing independent analysis of non -
invasive duplex ultrasound (DUS) imaging in  25 subjects  from each pivotal cohort  (i.e., right and 
left femoral venous access sites , constituting 2 exams per subject) , who  were randomized to and 
received the assigned treatment.  DUS evaluation w ill be  utilized to assess the local vascular impact 
of the Cardiva Mid-Bore VVCS or manual compression , along with the development of iatrogenic 
vascular complications . Specific investigational sites will be designated as ultrasound sites.   These 
3 – 4 sites will include subjects in the ultrasound  sub-study  imaging  until a total of 25 patients have 
been evaluated  in each treatment arm .  Ultrasound will be performed at the follow -up office visit .  
All sub -study sites w ill be  instructed in performance of duplex ultrasonography of the femoral 
vascular structures, and images w ill be  interpreted by a central core ultrasound laboratory with 
experience in multicenter vascular device trials . 
2. Device Description  
 
The Cardiva Mid-Bore Venous Vascular Closure System (VVCS) is indicated for the percutaneous 
closure of femoral venous access sites while reducing times to ambulation and discharge eligibility 
in patients who have undergone catheter -based procedures utilizing 6 – 12 Fr procedural sheaths, 
with single or multiple access sites per limb, ranging from a single access site in one limb to multiple 
access sites in both limbs.  
The Cardiva  Mid-Bore  VVCS is a disposable device based on the previously approved VASCADE 6/7F 
arterial VCS device. The only significant change with respect to the approved device is an increase 
in disc diameter from ~19F to ~21F to ensure temporary hemostasis and proper colla gen 
deployment during closure of larger bore holes.   
As in the previously approved device, the Mid-Bore VVCS device is designed to deliver a resorbable 
collagen patch extravascularly to block blood flow from the femoral venotomy site at the 
completion of a catheterization procedure.  Cardiva’s Mid-Bore VVCS devices are intended to assist 
physicians or catheter lab technicians in controlling bleeding from femoral venotomy sites and 
reduce time to ambulation.  
The Mid-Bore VVCS device is used in conjunction w ith 6 – 12 Fr inner diameter introducer sheaths.  
The VVCS device is introduced through a compatible procedure sheath at the completion of a 
catheterization procedure.  
The Mid-Bore VVCS is comprised of a catheter containing a resorbable collagen implant. Refer to 
Figure 1 below for an image of the device.

Figure 1: Cardiva Mid -Bore VVCS with Disc Deployed  
 
To use the Cardiva VVCS, the catheter is inserted into the femoral vein through the previously 
placed introducer sheath.  After insertion, the distal tip of the catheter is deployed, opening and 
expanding a low -profile Nitinol (NiTi) disc within the lumen of the femoral vein.  The introducer 
sheath is then removed from the vessel over the catheter and the low -profile disc is placed against 
the inner wall, locating the vessel wall and temporarily sealing the venotomy.  The position of the 
device disc against  the vessel wall locates the collagen patch in the tissue tract immediately 
adjacent to the venotomy site (extravascular) and its location is verified using fluoroscopy prior to 
release.  The clip is placed on the device shaft at the surface of the skin to  hold the device in place 
during fluoroscopy.  
Note, the principle of operation and the steps described below are identical to that of the 
previously approved device.  Refer to the Instructions For Use document in Attachment 3 . 
2.1. Device Labeling  
A co py of the Instructions  for Use ( IFU) will be included with the devices .  The Cardiva Mid-Bore 
Venous Vascular Closure System ( VVCS) labels contain  the following information:  
• Venous Vascular Closure System  
• Lot number  
• Expiration (use by) date  
• For Investigational Use Only

  3. Study Objective  
The objective of the trial is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Cardiva Mid-Bore Venous 
Vascular Closure  System ( VVCS) in sealing femoral venous access sites and providing reduced time s to 
ambulation (TTA) compared with manual compression at the completion of catheter -based procedures 
utilizing 6 – 12 Fr inner diameter procedural sheaths, with single or multiple access sites. This study will be 
considered a success from a statistical per spective if it meets both the Cardiva Mid-Bore VVCS superiority 
goal for the primary effectiveness analysis and the non -inferiority goal for the primary safet y analysis as 
stated in Section  8.

5.2. Withdrawal of Subjects  
While study withdrawal is discouraged, subjects may withdraw from the study at any time, with 
or without reason and without prejudice to further treatment. In all cases of withdrawal, the 
reason(s) for withdrawal (if given) will be recorded upon study termination.  In addition, the 
Investigator  may withdraw the subject for any other reason determined by the Investigator  to 
be in the best int erest of the subject.  
Once randomization is performed, subjects are  considered enrolled and must  have all peri -
procedural data collected regardless of what treatment they receive after randomization, 
according to the Intent to Treat Principle  for analyses of effectiveness .  
Subjects who are rando mized to VVCS and then never have the device inserted for any reason 
may be withdrawn after Discharge , since the safety analyses are based on subject s who receive

  any part of the assigned treatment. All peri -procedu ral data must be collected for these subjects 
for effectiveness analyses . 
6. Written Informed Consent  
Written Informed Consent must be obtained for all patients who are potential study candidates .  
Patients who meet pre-op inclusion/exclusion entry criteria will be invited to participate, and asked 
to sign the study -specific, Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved Informed Consent form before 
any study -specific tests or procedures are performed. Study personnel sho uld explain that even if a 
patient agrees to participate in the study and signs an informed consent form, the  Investigator  may 
determine that the patient is not a suitable candidate for the study.   
A Screening/Enrollment Log will be maintained to document select information about candidates who 
fail to meet the entry criteria.

  • TTD: Time to Discharge (by patient)  
7.4. Study Procedure s 
 Pre-Operative  
Prior to the subject’s scheduled procedure, obtain a medical history and record the subject’s 
demographic  data  (age, race, ethnicity, and gender ) and baseline information (height , weight , 
BMI).  Review the Pre -operative Inclusion and Exclusion criteria  within 45 days prior to the 
planned procedure date, including collection of the following routine  blood tests:  
• serum creatinine  
• platelet count  
• hemoglobin and hematocrit  
Review of the subject’s medical history and risk factors will be documented . The subject will be  
asked about  any pre -existing lower extremity ne rve complaints  in both lower limbs  (i.e., 
symptoms, severity) . Peri-procedural  medications that are taken within 24 hours of the procedure 
that may affect bleeding (e.g., anti -platelet, anti -coagulant, anti -thrombotic agents, etc.) will be 
documented . 
Document the most recent  INR for subjects on warfarin.  
 Intra -Operative  – Data Colle ction for All Subjects  
For consented subjects that continue to meet the Pre-operative Eligibility  Criteria, record the 
following data regarding their procedure :  
• procedure type : A-Fib, Other  
o If A-Fib, record: paroxysmal, persistent, and chronic / permanent , other  
• ablation modality (e.g., RF , Cryo)  
• P0 TIME:  time of first index procedure sheath insertion  
• number and location of access site location s (3 or 4) 
• techniques used to gain venous access , if any  (e.g., ultrasound, micropuncture ) 
• procedural anti -coagulation administered  
• final procedural ACT time and value  
• protamine administration , dose and time  (if given)  
• time of extubation  
 Intra -Operative – Access Site Requirements  
The following procedural requirements apply to all subjects enrolled in this study:  
• A maximum of 2 femoral venous access sites are allowed per limb.  
 CARDIVA Medical, Inc.   
 
 
The AMBULATE Trial           CONFIDENTIAL                          PTL 0508 -03         CIP  Page 29 of 71  
  • All access site s must have  procedural sheaths with  a minimum of a 6 Fr and a maximum of a 
12Fr sheath  inner diameter at the end of the case.  
• Sheaths larger th an 9 Fr must be placed in separate limbs (e.g., cannot place two 10 Fr 
sheaths in one limb).  
• Refer to the Cardiva Mid -Bore VVCS IFU for specific instructions on device use.  
 Intra -Operative Randomization  
At the end of the catheter -based procedure, with the procedural sheaths in place and under 
fluoroscopic visualization, an injection of contrast will be made to assess sheath placement and 
the anatomy of all venous access sites to verify the intra -operative  eligibility criteria prior to 
randomization. These images should be saved and printed/stored with the subject’s study 
records for monitoring purposes.  
• Each venous access site must meet all intra -procedural access site -specific criteria for 
the subject to be eligible.  
Once it has been determined that the subject does not meet any of the general intra -operative 
exclusion criteria, and that none of the venous access sites meet the specific access site exclusion 
criteria (i.e., all venous access sites must mee t all study criteria for the subject to be eligible), then 
the subject is eligible for randomization.  
• Once randomized, every access site will be closed according to the treatment assignment 
(i.e., either VVCS or manual compression).  
• Study data will be capt ured for each access site, according to the instructions below.  
• NOTE: Any subject that is randomized is considered to be enrolled, and all peri-procedural 
study data must be collected under the Intent to Treat principle regardless of deviations 
from the assigned treatment. For this reason, i t is imperative that randomization is not 
performed until the case is complete and final eligibility criteria are confirmed.  
• If the subject is randomized to Mid -Bore VVC S and it is subsequently discovered that one 
or more of the access sites is not able to be closed (e.g., complication)  apply  manual 
compression to the affected  access sites and close all eligible access sites using Mid -Bore 
VVCS. A ll study data will still be collected for each access site. See Section 4. 2 Withdrawal 
of Subjects.  
At each investigational site, variable block randomizations will be performed separately by 
number of venotomy sites via EDC access at the conclusion of the index procedure, while the 
patient is on the table .  Randomization will be stratified by 3 vs. 4 access sites, and there will be a 
1:1 randomization ratio for Cardiva Mid -Bore VVCS vs. manual compression for access site closure. 
Refer to the Manual of Operations for instructions on how to randomize a subject.  
 Access Site Closure Instructions  
The following process will be used to collect procedural data for each of the treatment arms:  
 CARDIVA Medical, Inc.   
 
 
The AMBULATE Trial           CONFIDENTIAL                          PTL 0508 -03         CIP  Page 30 of 71  
  Mid-Bore VVCS Treatment Arm Guidelines  
If the subject is randomized to receive the Mid-Bore VVCS, the device  should be deployed 
according to  procedure in the Instructions for Use (IFU) provided in Attachment 3 . If protamine is 
administered, the Investigator  may proceed immediately  with sheath exchanges and VVCS 
deployment without re -checki ng the ACT to obtain a target value.  
Document device information:  
• Device Lot #  
• Device Success evaluation  
• Document any complications or device performance issues on the Device Performance  
eCRF; refer to the Manual of Operations for device return instructions in the case of any 
device performance issues.  
Manual Compression Guidelines:  
If the subject is randomized to receive manual compression, it should be performed according to 
the instit ution’s standard practice. If protamine is administered, the Investigator  should follow 
institutional practice guidelines for re -checking ACT levels and/or waiting a specified time or  for a 
target ACT value prior to removal of sheaths  and application of  manual compression .  
Documenting Access Site Hemostasis in Both Treatment Arms:  
While performing the procedure, record the following information1: 
• P1 TIME:  time of removal of final index procedur e device /catheter  
• For each access site, record:  
• Access site location , e.g., right/left leg and relative location with respect to 2nd access 
site, if applicable e.g. proximal/distal, medial/lateral, etc.  
• Final introducer sheath size (inner diameter and length) at time of closure (i.e. after final 
sheath exchanges ) 
• TX.1 TIME:  time of  removal for Mid-Bore VVCS device (treatment arm)  or for removal of 
sheath (control arm)  
• TX.2 TIME:  time venous hemostasis is achieved  
• Confirm that venous hemostasis is  maintained and  confirmed at 5 minutes after 
recorded hemostasis time (TX.2) . 
• Document any light manual compression applied for tissue tract ooze.  
Note: For VVCS arm, f ormation  of a hematoma post -sheath removal may indicate a back -wall or 
secondary venous or arterial pun cture.  If this situation is suspected, the VVCS should be removed 
and the subject should be converted to manual compression  at that location. Additional access 
 
1 source worksheets and clock/timers will be provided and required by Sponsor  
 CARDIVA Medical, Inc.   
 
 
The AMBULATE Trial           CONFIDENTIAL                          PTL 0508 -03         CIP  Page 31 of 71  
  sites may still be closed with Mid -Bore VVCS, as appropriate . 
 Post -Operative  
After hemostasis is achieved and confirmed at the required intervals, the access site should be 
monitored every 15 minutes for the first hour for all subjects.  
Post -procedure, record the following information:  
• P2 TIME: Record the date and time the subject  was able to ambulate 20 feet without venous 
re-bleeding from the access sites.  
 
• P3 TIME: Record the date and time the subject was eligible for discharge, based solely on 
the assessment of the access site, as determined by the medical team (i.e., absence o f 
access site bleeding or obvious complications).  
 
• P4 TIME:  Record the date and time the subject was discharged from the facility.  
 
• Any medication administered for management of pain or anxiety while the subject is on 
bedrest will be collected.  
 
 Ambulation Guidelines by treatment arm:  
Time to Ambulation is the primary efficacy endpoint of the study, therefore every effort must be 
made to ambulate the subjects within the timelines described below, providing that the subject 
is medically stable to d o so.  
Cardiva Mid -Bore VVCS:  
Bed rest for 2 hour minimum to a 2.5 hour  maximum , then ambulate if stable. Check groin 
immediately post ambulation.  Re-check groin after 15 minutes to verify status. Any ambulation 
delay beyond 3  hours final access site hemostasis time that is not related to a medical condition 
(e.g., pt. is sleeping, no staff available) will be documented, and a Protocol Deviation will  be 
written. NOTE: If one or more of the access sites are not able to be closed with the Mid -Bore VVCS 
(e.g., complication preventing use of the device, user error), subjects should be maintained on 
bedrest according to the Investigator ’s discretion and al l study times will be collected. This would 
not constitute a deviation from the protocol.  
Manual Compression:  
Follow institutional guidelines for ambulation. Check groin immediately post ambulation.  Re-
check groin after 15 minutes to verify status. Any delays of > 30 minutes beyond institution’s 
standard practice for ambulation that are not related to a medical condition (e.g., pt. is sleeping, 
no staff available) will be documented, and a Protocol Deviation will be written.  
 
Time to Discharg e Eligibility Guidelines (all subjects):  
 CARDIVA Medical, Inc.   
 
 
The AMBULATE Trial           CONFIDENTIAL                          PTL 0508 -03         CIP  Page 32 of 71  
  Approximately 15 (+/ - 5) minutes after the subject has successfully completed the ambulation 
assessment (P2), all access sites should be carefully assessed for the following:  
• Forming or expanding hematoma  
• Presence of any obvious vascular complications at the access site . 
If the subject does not exhibit any of these symptoms at any of the access sites, he/she may be 
considered to be “Eligible for Hospital Discharge” based on this study definition of the acce ss site 
assessment only. These are basic guidelines for this study -required assessment only, and are not 
intended to impact actual hospital discharge times for these subjects. Using these guidelines, the 
Investigator  may delegate this TTDE assessment to qu alified medical personnel.  
Any significant delay in determination of this discharge eligibility (i.e., > 30 minutes after 
successful ambulation) that is not related to the access site assessment will be documented as a 
protocol deviation (e.g., no staff a vailable, other condition unrelated to access site).  
NOTE: If there is any sign of active bleeding at the access site(s) after ambulation, measures 
should be taken to re -achieve hemostasis and then the subject re -ambulated when the 
Investigator  determines that it is appropriate to do so. In these cases, TTA and TTDE will be 
repeated and documented when successful, and the re -bleeding will be documented as an 
adverse event.  
 Patient Experience Survey  Administration Guidelines  [Attachment 4]  
All subject s will be given a Patient Experience Survey to complete after successful TTA , at the 
time of  TTDE  to characterize their experience while on bedrest post -procedure . The Research 
designee should give it to the patient, according to  the Instructions p rovide in the Manual of 
Operations.  The completed Survey  should be collected at the time of completion.  These data 
will be entered in the eCRF  but will not be included in endpoint analyses or hypothesis testing .  
Time to Discharge Guidelines (all subjects):  
Prior to hospital discharge, all subjects will be asked about any lower extremity nerve complaints 
in both lower limbs (i.e., symptoms, severity) that were not existing prior to the index procedure. 
The data will be captured in the Case Report F orms.  
Research personnel should attempt to confirm a date for a follow -up visit at 30 (+/ -7) days with 
the subject prior to discharge to ensure compliance. Ultrasound sub -study subjects should have 
their ultrasound appointments scheduled to ensure complia nce. 
Documentation of Venous Re -Bleeding at Femoral Access Site:  
If a subject experiences venous re -bleeding at any of the femoral venous access sites after  a) 
hemostasis had been confirmed for at least 5 minutes and b) prior to hospital discharge, 
documen t the following information on the Discharge eCRF:  
• Location of bleed (indicate right or left groin);  
• Date and time of re -bleed;  
• Complete adverse event form . 
 CARDIVA Medical, Inc.

  7.5.  Follow -up at 30 (+/ - 7) Days  
Subject s should be present for an in -person office visit  30 ± 7 days following their index procedure.  
The subject should be queried regarding any complications they experienced after hospital 
discharge and the status of the access site wound s should be assessed.  All subjects will be asked 
about any lower extr emity nerve complaints in both lower limbs (i.e., symptoms, severity) that 
were not existing prior to the index procedure . These data will be captured in the Case Report 
Forms.  
If a subject cannot attend an office visit for any reason, a telephone follow -up should be completed 
for safety assessment, however this will be documented as a protocol deviation and the subject’s 
follow -up will be considered incomplete. These subjects will not be withdrawn.   
At select sites, a  subset of 25 subjects from each treat ment arm will have an ultrasound exam of 
the bilateral femoral access sites performed and a digital image recorded  for each limb .   
7.6. Study Exit  
Once the subject has completed the follow -up visit  or has withdrawn , they should be exited from 
the study provided they do not have any conditions that require continued follow -up.  The date 
of exit and subject status should be recorded  on the Study Exit CRF .

9. Statistical Considerations  
9.1.  Analysis Populations and Data Handling Conventions    
 Effectiveness  
According to the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) principle, all randomized subjects will be included in all 
effecti veness analyses and analyzed according to the randomization treatment assignment, 
regardless of actual treatment deviations.  
 Safety  
Safety analysis will be performed according to the actual treatment received. All subjects who 
receive any portion of the Ca rdiva VVCS device treatment will be analyzed as a VVCS patient; 
subjects who receive manual compression control treatment only as randomized will be analyzed 
as a manual compression patient.     
 Missing Data  
All efforts will be made to eliminate missing da ta for the primary effectiveness endpoint of TTA 
and primary safety endpoint of major access site closure complications.  However, should 
missing data be non -trivial, the primary analyses will be based on complete cases with data and 
sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess robustness of the primary results.  Multiple 
imputa tions strategy such as assuming missing at random and control based imputation will be 
employed for the primary effectiveness endpoint; worst case, best cas e and tipping point 
analyses will be performed for primary safety endpoint.  Missing data for secondary endpoints 
will not be imputed by any method.  
9.2. Statistical Analysis Plan  
Results for roll -in patients will be summarized separately and excluded from formal analysis.  
 Baseline Subject Characteristics   
Subject demographics, baseline characteristics and medical history will be summarized 
descriptively by randomized treatment arm. Mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum will be reported  for continuous variables. Frequencies and proportions will be 
reported for categorical variables.  
 Effectiveness  
9.2.2.1. Primary Effectiveness (TTA) Analysis  
The primary effectiveness endpoint is time to ambulation (TTA) as defined in Section 7.1.  
Summar y statistics for TTA (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) will be 
reported for all rand omized patients (ITT) and further by the randomization stratification factor 
 CARDIVA Medical, Inc.   
 
 
The AMBULATE Trial           CONFIDENTIAL                          PTL 0508 -03         CIP  Page 38 of 71  
  (number of access sites per patient: 3 vs. 4) within each treatment arm.  The proportions of 
Cardiva Mid -Bore VVCS converted to manual compression will also be reported.   
The main effectiveness analysis will be based on the mean TTA.  The hypotheses are as follows.    
• H0:  Cardiva Mid -Bore VVCS mean TTA ≥ manual compression mean TTA  
• HA:  Cardiva Mid -Bore VVCS mean TTA < manual compression mean TTA  
 
An ANCOVA analysis will be performed adjusting for randomization stratification factor, i.e. 3 vs 
4 access sites.  A 1 -sided  p<0.025 by t test favoring the Cardiva Mid -Bore VVCS (i.e. shorter TTA) 
will be regarded as a successful demonstration of the superiority of the Cardiva Mid -Bore VVCS 
effectiveness over manual compression.   
 
9.2.2.2 Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints Analyses  
Secondary effectiveness endpoints include total post procedure time (TPPT),   time to discharge 
eligibility (TTDE), and time to discharge (TTD).  
 
TTH will be compared between the two study arms by the bootstrap method with patient as 
the re -sampling unit as opposed to access site, as within patient TTH times may be correlated. 
Otherwise the analysis will be similar to those for the primary safety analysis described in 8.2.3, 
and t he proposed TTH non -inferiority margin will be 5 minutes for VVCS as compared to manual 
com pression.    
 
Lastly, time to closure eligibility ( TTCE ), procedure success, and proportions of device success 
(VVCS only, b y access site) will be descriptively summarized without hypothesis testing.  
 
 
 Safety  
Primary Safety Analysis  
The primary safety analysis  will be based on the 30 -day limb incidence rate of combined major 
access site closure complications (see 7.3).  Both the  combined rate and individual complication 
incidence rates will be reported by treatment received as described in 8.1.2.  
The statistical hypotheses are as follows:  
• H0:  Cardiva Mid -Bore VVCS rate – manual compression rate ≥ 5%  
• HA:  Cardiva Mid -Bore VVCS rate – manual compression rate < 5%  
A 2-sided 95% confidence interval will be constructed by the bootstrap re -sampling method, 
with patient as the sampling unit as opposed to the limb, for the VVCS – manual compression

The AMBULATE Trial           CONFIDENTIAL                          PTL 0508 -03         CIP  Page 39 of 71  
  major compl ication rate difference.  This is to account for  an unlikely correlation between two 
limbs of a patient with respect to major closure complications.  One million bootstrap re -
sampling simulations will be performed. For each simulation , stratified sampling with 
replacement (by randomization stratification factor) will be performed separately for the two 
study arms and t he VVCS – manual compression (MC) major complication rate difference will 
be recorded .    With one million  simulations, a data distribution w ill be generated for the VVCS 
– MC major complication rate difference.  With patient as the sampling unit, any data structure 
(independent or correlated) between the same patient’s two limbs is prese rved in this data 
distribution.  If the 97.5th percentile  of the distribution, i.e. the upper limit of the 2 -sided 95% 
confidence interval for the VVCS – MC difference, is <5%, then the null hypothesis of a ≥5% 
higher VVCS complication rate will be rejected at a 2 -sided 0.05 significance level. In this case 
the VVCS major complications ra te will be considered non -inferior to that of the manual 
compression.   
 
As an example to illustrate the actual study results required in order to accomplish this goal, 
assume the two limbs within each patient to be independent (highly likely) and a 2% (4/204) 
major com plication rate is ob served for the MC control treatment. The observed VVCS major 
complication rate must be ≤ 3% (6/204) in order for the 95% confidence upper limit for the 
difference to be <5%.  This co nfidence interval calculation is based on Newcombe’s method 
derived from Wilson scores. (Ref: Newcombe RG, Interval Estimation for the Difference between 
Independent Proportions: Comparison of Eleven Methods, Statistics in Medicine, 17, 8   
73-890, 1998) . 
Secondary Safety Analysis  
The combined incidence rate and individual complica tion incidence rates will also be reported 
by treatment received for access site closure related minor complications .  Formal non-inferiority 
testing will not be conducted for minor complications.  
Additionally, all reported adverse events will be summarized by treatment regardless of 
relationship to access site closure.   
 
9.3. Sample Size Justification  
Effectiveness  
Based on a prior study (RESPECT), mean TTA for manual control is es timated at 7.2 hours.  The 
same mean for Cardiva Mid -Bore VVCS is estimated at 5 hours including an outlier and at 4.3 hours 
excluding the outlier. With an estimated joint standard deviation of 5.4 hours, the power for 
reaching a statistically significant difference at 2 -sided 0.05 level with a total sample size of 204 
(102 per group) is 0.83 including the outlier in the calculation; the same power is 0.97 excluding 
the outlier.  
 CARDIVA Medical, Inc.   
 
 
The AMBULATE Trial           CONFIDENTIAL                          PTL 0508 -03         CIP  Page 40 of 71  
  Safety  
For the purpose of sample size/power estimation, we will assume major ac cess site closure 
complications to be independent between the two limbs of the same subject.  Based on clinical 
experience this is the most likely scenario for these rare events.  According to review of the 
VASCADE arterial VCS RESPECT study1, the combined  major complication rate by limb is estimated 
to be 2% for b oth VVCS and manual compression.  With these assumptions, simulations were 
conducted  using the R software for a sample size of 204 each for VVCS and manual compression 
patients.  The power for the Newcombe 2 -side 95% confidence upper limit to exclude 5% is 
approximately 0.88.     
In order to evaluate the Newcombe method as an approximatio n to the proposed analysis 
method, i.e. bootstrap by patient, systematic comparisons were performed between the upper 
limit of Newcombe and bootstrap confidence intervals.   Complication rates of 0% – 3% were 
selected for comparison, as this range is expec ted to cover great majority of the actual cases.  The 
results are presented in the following table.

*x1 and x2 are numbers of major complications, p1 and p2 are proportions of major 
complications  
**Sim 1: complication data are independent, i.e. all events occur in different patients  
**Sim 2: In one case complications occur in both legs of a pat ient in the arm with higher 
complication r ate, or in arm 1 (experimental) if rates are the same in both arms  
**Sim 3: In two cases complications occur in both legs of the same patient in the arm with 
higher complication rate, or in arm 1 (experimental) if rates are the same in both arms. 
(Scenario  only applicable when at least one arm has 4 or more events.)  
The mean difference, p1 – p2, was reproduced in all 42 bootstrap simulations.  It can be seen that the 
Newcombe method is conservative in that its 95% confidence upper limit was uniformly higher than or 
the same as the corresponding bootstrap upper limit in simulation scenarios Sim 1 and Sim 2, with 
independent and low c orrelation compl ication data between limbs respectively.  Out of 15 complication

  data scenarios , 2 Newcombe limits were > 0.05 .  For each of bootstrap Sim 1 and Sim 2, 1 limit was 
>0.05 but less than the corresponding Newcombe limit.  Only in the unlikely scenarios of Sim 3, where 2 
patients in the same treatment arm had complications in both legs, did Newcombe and bootstrap upper 
limits become similar. Therefore we concl ude that for power estimation purposes the Newcombe 
confidence limit is a conservative but satisfactory approximation method; the actual bootstrap power 
may be slightly higher than the Newcombe estimate.  
9.4. Planned Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis in support of a CE Mark submission will be conducted to analyze initial subjects 
randomized to  the treatment arm only with respect to efficacy and safety. This interim analysis is not 
intended to support a decision to continue or to dis continue the trial, or to implement any modifications 
to trial procedures.  
 
To alleviate  potential statistical and operational bias that may be introduced, the execution of the 
interim analysis shall be a completely confidential process  to the study team .  All sponsor staff, staff 
contracted by the sponsor, and investigator staff directly involved in the conduct of the ongoing IDE trial 
will remain blind to the process and results of the analyses , with the exception of contracted resources  
involved in the e xecution of the interim analysis and submission of the results on behalf of the sponso r. 
 
Endpoints to be evaluated using descriptive statistics are as follows:  
 
• Primary efficacy: Time to Ambulation   
• Secondary efficacy: Total Post Procedure Time, Time to  Hemostasis, Time to Discharge Eligibility, 
Time to Discharge  
• Primary safety: rate of major complications related to the access site  
• Secondary safety: rate of minor complications related to the access site  
 
In addition, device success and procedure success  will be evaluated, as well as patient experience survey 
data.  
 
Randomization : This is a single -arm analysis, therefore subjects randomized to control arm will be 
excluded.  
 
Sample Size : 30-40 sequential subjects randomized to  treatment arm from up to 7 centers.  
 
A final clinical report will be prepared at the conclusion of the interim analysis by an agent of the 
sponsor who is independent from the conduct of the study. The report will be unblinded following the 
collection of the last patient’s procedure  data.  
 
10. Data Management – Data Collection and Processing  
Standardized eCRFs will be utilized by all participating sites , refer to the Manual of Operations for 
specifications and instructions . Investigator s are responsible for the accurate completion and timely 
submission of the data collected during the trial.  All data from the trial will be entered into eCRFs 
via a secure, web -based system with password protection.  Incoming data will be automatically 
 CARDIVA Medical, Inc.   
 
 
The AMBULATE Trial           CONFIDENTIAL                          PTL 0508 -03         CIP  Page 43 of 71  
  reviewed to identify inconsistent or missing data and any adverse events.  Any data issues are to be 
promptly addressed with the Investigator  by the CRO.  Quality assurance procedures will be 
established to ensure that complete, accurate and timely data are submitted, that protocol 
requirements are followed and that complications, adverse events and adverse device effects are 
correctly reported and investigated, as appropriate.  Investigator s are to maintain all source 
documents as required by the protocol, i ncluding laboratory results, supporting medical records, 
and signed Informed Consent forms.  The source documents will be used during the regular 
monitoring visits to verify information from the database against data contained on the completed 
eCRFs.   
The Principal Investigator  must maintain detailed records on all subjects who sign the Informed 
Consent and begin the pre -procedure evaluation.  Data for enrolled subjects will be entered into 
eCRFs provided by the Sponsor .  All data should be entered complete ly, promptly and legibly.  For 
source documents, corrections should be made in a manner that does not obscure or eliminate the 
original error, by striking through the original data with one line, and initialing and dating the 
change, along with the reason for the change (if not obvious).   
Study Exit eCRFs are completed for all enrolled subjects, regardless of whether they completed all 
study requirements  (e.g., subject discontinuation, trial termination).  
11. Monitoring Procedures  
11.1.  Monitoring  
Monitoring visits  to the clinical sites will be made periodically during the study, to ensure that all 
aspects of the current, approved protocol/amendment(s) are followed. Original source 
documents will be reviewed for verification of data in the electronic database. The 
Investigator /institution guarantees direct access to original source documents by Cardiva 
Medical, Inc. personnel, their designees,  and appropriate regulatory authorities . In the event that 
the original medical records cannot  be obtained for a patient that is seen by a non -study physi cian 
at a non -study institution,  photocopies of the original source documents must be made available 
for review.  
It is important that the Investigator  and relevant study personnel are available du ring the 
monitoring visits and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.  
Phone contacts and site visits will be conducted to ensure that the protocol is being followed and 
that any protocol deviations are properly documented.  Clinical monitoring wil l include a 
verification that Informed Consent was properly obtained for all enrolled trial participants, a 
review of clinical records for accuracy and completeness, resolution of missing or inconsistent 
results and a review of source documents.  The Monitor will verify that the Case Report Forms 
(eCRFs) are in agreement with the source documentation and other records.  The Investigator  will 
make available to the clinical monitor for review all Informed Consent documents, Internet access 
to completed eCRFs,  source documentation, original laboratory data and other relevant records

  for all enrolled subjects at the site.  It is important that the Investigator  and other relevant site 
personnel are available for consultation with the Monitors during the monitorin g visits and that 
sufficient time is devoted at the site to the monitoring process.  
Additionally, telephone and/or e -mail contact will be conducted on a regular basis with the 
Investigator  and the site staff to ensure that the protocol is being followed an d to address any 
issues that may occur during the course of the study . In some cases, remote monitoring and data 
cleaning may be performed.  
If a deficiency is noted during an on -site visit (or at any other time during the course of the trial), 
the Monitor is required to discuss the situation with the Investigator  and the Sponsor  (if required) 
to secure compliance.  
11.2.  Investigational Device Distribution and Accountability  
 Investigational Device Distribution  
Cardiva Medical will  provide and  control the distribution of the investigational devices.  Each 
investigational site will be responsible for ordering the investigational devices for the study.  
The Investigator  is responsible for ensuring that the devices are ordered for shipment to arri ve 
at the hospital before the procedure date.  
Devices will be shipped with an Investigational Device Shipment Record.  This form is to be used 
by Cardiva Medical and the investigational site to record any shipments of the investigational 
device.  A copy i s to be retained by the shipper and the recipient.  
 Device Accountability  
The Investigator  shall maintain adequate records of the receipt and disposition of all 
investigational devices.  The Investigator  is responsible for ensuring that the investigational 
devices are used only under the Investigator ’s supervision and are only used according to  this 
protocol and any approved amendments.  The Investigator  will not supply an investigational 
device to any person not authorized to participate in the trial. The Investigator  shall document 
in the operative notes and eCRF’s the lot number of the device s used during a case.  In addition, 
the Investigator  shall keep complete and accurate records of all devices used or unused that 
have been returned to Cardiva Medical in a Device Accountability Log provided by Cardiva 
Medical.  
 Return of Materials Upon Stud y Termination  
After the cases are completed, all unused devices must be accounted for and shipped back to 
Cardiva Medical .  Instructions for device return to Cardiva Medical  will be reviewed at the site 
initiation visit.  
IMPORTANT:  Please note that the de vices must be labeled with a “BIOHAZARD” sticker if there 
is reasonable belief that the device has come in contact with blood or infectious substances that 
are known or are believed to cause disease in animals or humans.  Refer to the Manual of 
Operations f or Device Return Instructions.

  12. Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
12.1.  Site Training  
To ensure accurate, complete, and reliable data, the Sponsor  or its representatives will provide 
instructional material to the trial sites, as appropriate  and will:   
• Instruct the Investigator s and trial personnel on the protocol, the completion of the eCRFs, 
and trial procedures ; 
• Communicate regularly with site per sonnel via mail, email, telephone, and/or fax ; 
• Make periodic visits to the trial sites ; 
• Conduct periodic remote data cleaning and correspondence.  
12.2.  Investigator  and Co -Investigator  Training  
An Investigator  is defined as the person responsible for the conduct  of the clinical investigation at 
an investigational site. The Investigator  is the responsible leader of the team and may be called 
the Principal Investigator .   
A Co -Investigator  is defined as an individual member of the clinical  investigation team designated 
and supervised by the Investigator  at an investigational site who performs critical investigation -
related procedures and/or makes important investigation -related observations, including 
enrollment of subjects and deployment o f the study device.   
An Operator is defined as an individual member of the clinical  investigation team who is qualified 
by training and experience (i.e., non -Investigator  MD or certified vascular tech), and who is 
designated to deploy the study device in a study subject under the direction of, and the direct 
supervision of an Investigator  or Co -Investigator .  
Prior to enrolling any subjects in the study, Investigator s, Co -Investigator s and Operators will be 
provided didactic training with a benchtop model to simulate the closure procedure with the Mid -
Bore Venous Vascular Closure System. This training will be provided by a Sponsor -designated 
proctor . Benchtop training will be followed by study device deploy ment  under proctor in a roll -in 
subject for up to 4 of the femoral venous  access sit es. The proctor shall either approve, or require 
additional training for each individual until all pre -specified training requirements have been met.  
Investigator s and Co -Investigator s will be notified in writing when they have successfully 
completed the roll -in requirements and are eligible to randomize subjects into the trial, and to 
deploy the study device without a Sponsor  proctor. Operators will be notified in writing when 
they have successfully completed the roll -in requirements and are eligible to deplo y the study 
device under the direct supervision of an Investigator /Co-Investigator  in a consented, qualifying 
study patient without a Sponsor  proctor. An Operator will not have authority to make any 
decisions about enrollment, but only to deploy the device  as directed.  
An Investigator  and Operator Training & Proctor Log will be utilized to assess and ensure all skills 
and knowledge level s are satisfactory prior to written approvals by the Sponsor .  
 CARDIVA Medical, Inc.

  These roll -in subjects will be followed in the same fashio n as the randomized subjects and 
evaluated as a separate subject cohort.  
12.3.  Audits and Inspections  
The Principal Investigator  for the site will also allow representatives of the governing IRB, the 
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and other ap plicable regulatory agencies to 
inspect all trial records, eCRFs, and corresponding portions of the subject’s office and/or hospital 
medical records at regular intervals throughout the study .  These inspections are for the purpose 
of verifying adherence to the protocol, completeness and exactness of the data being transcribed 
to the eCRF, and compliance with FDA or other regulatory agency regulations.  
The Principal Investigator  for the site w ill inform the Sponsor  or the Sponsor ’s designee in advance 
if they are to be audited or inspected by any regulatory agencies.  The Sponsor  or the Sponsor ’s 
designee will also inform the site if they are made aware of a pending audit or inspection by a 
regulatory agency.  
13. Adverse Events  
13.1.  General  
All adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) will be monitored from the time of 
randomization through the 1-month follow -up visit.  
An AE is defined as any undesirable clinical occurrence in a patient whe ther or not it is considered 
to be device related. In addition, the definition of AE applies to any event with an onset post 
study procedure  or to any underlying diseases present at baseline, that exacerbate in severity 
post study procedure . Therefore, an underlying disease that was present at the time of 
enrollment is not reported as an AE, but any increase in the severity of the underlying disease is 
to be reported as an AE. This definition includes events occurring during the follow -up period.  
All reported AEs must be recorded in the electronic database. A description of the event, 
including the start date, resolution date, action taken, and the outcome should be provided, 
along with the Investigator ’s assessment of the relationship between the AE , the study treatment  
and the study procedure .  
  The following definitions for rating severity of adverse events will be used:  
Mild:  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated; are of minor irritant type; 
causing no loss of time from normal activities; symptoms would not require 
medication or a medical evaluation; signs or symptoms are transient.  
Moderate:  Interferes with the subject’s usual activity and/or requires symptomatic 
treatment.  
Severe:  Symptom(s) causing severe discomfort and sig nificant impact of the subject’s 
usual activity and requires treatment.

  A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an event which leads to:   
• Death due to any cause  
• Life-threatening condition  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization  
• Results in congenital abnormality  
All SAE’s will be reported.   
Device -Related Adverse Event : an adverse event is considered to be device -related when, in the 
judgment of the Investigator , the clinical event has a reasonable time sequence associated with 
use of the investigational device and is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or ot her 
procedures or medications.  It is reasonable to believe that the device directly caused or 
contributed to the adverse event.  
Procedure -Related Adverse Event : an adverse event is considered to be procedure -related when, 
in the judgment of the Investiga tor; it is reasonable to believe that the event is associated with the 
assigned study procedure and is not specific to the investigational device used.  Other products, 
surgical techniques, or medications required specifically for the procedure are likely to have 
contributed to the occurrence of the event.  
Concomitant Medication -Related Adverse Event:  an adverse event is considered to be 
concomitant medication related when, in the judgment of the Investigator , it is reasonable to 
believe that the event is a ssociated with concomitant medications used in conjunction with the 
investigational device and is not otherwise specific to the investigational device (e.g. bleeding 
associated with anticoagulation medication).  
Pre-Existing Condition -Related Adverse Event:  an adverse event is considered to be related to a 
pre-existing condition when, in the judgment of the Investigator , it is reasonable to believe that 
the event is associated with the subject’s pre -existing condition and is not specific to the 
investigation al device or procedure. Pre -existing conditions that are aggravated or become more 
severe during or after the procedure should be evaluated on a case -by-case basis to determine if 
the event may be more appropriately classified as device -related or procedur e-related.  
Cardiva Medical, Inc., or its designee, in cooperation with the Investigator , will assess all adverse 
events considered to be device -related for potential reportability to the FDA and other regulatory 
authorities as an Unanticipated Adverse Devi ce Effect (UADE).  
The Investigator  should follow all unresolved serious adverse events until the events are resolved, 
the subject is lost to follow -up, the subject has withdrawn consent, or the adverse event is 
otherwise explained.  
Non -Events:  For purpose s of this study, the following events are not considered adverse events, 
because they are normally expected to occur in conjunction with catheter -based procedures / post -
procedure, or are associated with customary, standard care of subjects undergoing thes e procedures:

  • Early post -operative pain (within 24 hours post -index procedure) at the access site and/or 
related to position on procedure table  
• Post -anesthesia/conscious sedation emesis, nausea, or headache (within 24 hours post -index 
procedure)  
• Chest pain without associated ECG changes  
• Hematocrit decrease from baseline not associated with hemodynamic changes, remaining 
above 30% and not requiring transfusion  
• Electrolyte imbalance without clinical sequelae following endovascular procedure, even i f 
requiring correction  
• Low grade temperature increase ( 38.3C/101F)  
• Sinus bradycardia/tachycardia that does not require treatment or intervention  
• Systolic or diastolic blood pressure changes that do not require treatment or intervention  
• Any pre-planned surgical procedures  
This listing of events is intended to provide guidance to the investigational sites for purposes of 
adverse event reporting.  The Investigator  at the investigational site should utilize his/her own clinical 
judgment in evalu ating adverse experiences, and may decide that the above events should be 
reported as adverse events.   
13.2.  Reporting of Serious and Non -Serious Adverse Events   
 General Reporting Requirements (Serious & Non -Serious Adverse Events ) 
All serious and potentially d evice - and/or procedure -related adverse events must be recorded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF by the Investigator  (or designee).  The report should include: severity, 
duration, action taken, treatment outcome and relationship of the adverse experience to the 
study device, procedure, concomitant medications, pre -existing condition, etc. (i.e., unrelated, 
related or relationship unknown).   
In the case of serious adverse events, procedure and/or device observations  and malfunctions, 
medical record documentation ( e.g. procedure notes, operative notes, discharge summary, 
relevant progress notes, imaging or lab studies) must be provided to Cardiva Medical or its 
designee.  
The following criteria must also be adhered to by the Investigator  in the case of serious adver se 
events:  
• It is the responsibility of the Investigator  to inform their IRB of serious adverse events as 
required by their IRB ’s procedures and in conformance with FDA and local regulatory 
requirements.  
All serious device - and/or procedure -related adverse events must be reported by the 
Investigator  (or designee) to the Sponsor  within 24 hours of learning of the adverse event via 
eCRF. The Cardiva Medical contact information for questions is:

All reported device observations, malfunctions or failures of the Cardiva Mid-Bore VVSC are 
required to be documented in the eCRF.  In the event of a suspected observation or device 
problem, the investigational device shall be returned to the Sponsor  for analysis.  Device failures 
and malfunctions should also be documented in the patient’s  medical record. Instructions for 
returning the investigational device are included in the Manual of Operations .  
NOTE: Device failures or malfunctions are NOT to be reported as adverse events. However, if there 
is an adverse event that results from a devi ce failure or malfunction, that specific event would be 
recorded in the usual way.  
14. Study Committee  
14.1.  Data Safety Monitoring Committee  (DSMC)  
An independent combination Clinical Events Committee (CEC) and Data Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) , referred to as the Data Safety Monitoring Committee , or DSMC , shall be responsible for 
systematic review and adjudication of all reported major and minor access site -closure related 
endpoint  complications . All other events reported to be potentially device - or procedure -related 
by the Investigator  will be reviewed by an independent Safety Manager and/or a member of the 
DSMC to determine whether it meets criteria for adjudication. In order to enhance objectivity and 
reduce the potential for bias, the DSMC  members shall be independent of the Sponsor  as well as 
the invest igational sites/ Investigator s. 
Members shall consist of at least two (2) independent physicians with experience in catheter -
based  procedures , and a statistician . A third independent physician may be utilized in cases when 
disparity occurs between the two primary DSMC reviewers.  
The methodology for performing these responsibilities shall be developed and outlined in the 
Adjudication Charter. Operational provisions shall be established to minimize potential bias.  
The DSMC  may recommend study termination if safety concerns warrant such action .  The DSM C 
will establish guideline criteria for recommending study termination, to the extent that it is 
possible for the DSM C to predict adverse events or outcomes, before the proposed study begins .

signature  on the ICF . The person administering the Informed Consent shall also sign and date the 
ICF. The patient shall receive a copy of the ICF, and the informed consent process shall be 
documented in each subject’s source record . 
15.4.  Amending the Protocol  
An Investigator  may not make protocol changes without prior approval by Cardiva Medical .  All 
significant protocol changes that may affect the following must be submitted and approved by 
the FDA before initiating the change:  
• validity of the data or informa tion resulting from the completion of the approved protocol;  
• relationship of the likely subject risk to benefit relied upon to approve the protocol;  
• scientific soundness of the investigational plan, or;  
• rights, safety, or welfare of the human subjects invo lved in the investigation.  
The change must be approved by the FDA and submitted and subsequently approved by the site 
IRB.  Cardiva Medical  will submit a copy of the protocol amendment to all Investigator s for their 
IRB’s to review and ensure the study con tinues to be conducted consistently across all sites.  The 
investigative sites must send Cardiva Medical  a copy of the IRB approval letter for the protocol 
amendment.  
Cardiva Medical  may make certain administrative changes to the protocol without prior app roval 
of the FDA or IRB.  Cardiva Medical  will notify all investigative sites of such changes to ensure the 
study continues to be conducted consistently across all sites .  The site IRB’s will be notified of 
these changes.  
15.5.  Emergency Actions  
Cardiva Medical, Inc. accepts the right of the Investigator  to deviate from the protocol in an 
emergency when necessary to safeguard the life or the physical well-being  of a study patient. The 
Investigator  must give notice of any emergency deviations and j ustification for the deviation to 
Cardiva Medical, Inc. and the IRB as quickly as possible after the episode, in any event no later 
than 24 hours after the emergency.  
15.6.  Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is defined as an event where the Clinical Invest igator  or site personnel did 
not conduct the study according to the protocol.  
Investigator s shall be required to obtain prior approval from Cardiva Medical clinical study 
management before initiating deviations from the protocol, except where necessary to protect 
the life or physical well-being  of a subject in an emergency.  Such approval shall be documented 
in writing and maintained in clinical study management and Investigator  files.  Prior approval is 
generally not expected in situations where unforeseen circumstances are beyond the 
Investigator ’s control, (e.g. subject was not available for scheduled follow -up office visit, blood

The AMBULATE Trial           CONFIDENTIAL                          PTL 0508 -03         CIP  Page 52 of 71  
  sample lost by laboratory, etc.); however, the  event is still considered a deviation and will be 
reported via the appropriate CRF.  
Deviations must be reported to Cardiva Medical regardless of whether medically justifiable, pre -
approved by Cardiva Medical or taken to protect the subject in an emergency .  Subject specific 
deviations and non-subject specific deviations, (e.g. unauthorized use of an investigational device 
outside the study, unauthorized use of an investigational device by a physician who has not signed 
an Investigator  agreement or not been  trained in the use of the device, etc.), will be reported on 
the Protocol Deviation case report form. Investigator s will also adhere to procedures for reporting 
study deviations to their IRB in accordance with their specific IRB reporting policies and 
procedures.  
Regulations require that Investigator s maintain accurate, complete and current records, including 
documents showing the dates of and reasons for each deviation from the protocol.  For reporting 
purposes, Cardiva Medical  classifies study deviations  as major and minor:  
Major deviation :  Any deviation from subject inclusion  and exclusion criteria, subject informed 
consent procedures or unauthorized device use.  
Minor deviation : Deviation from a protocol requirement such as incomplete/inadequate subject 
testing procedures, follow -ups performed outside specified time windows, etc. Minor Deviations 
that continue to occur at an investigational site may be classified as Major Deviations if corrective 
action is not taken to secure  future compliance to the protocol.  
Major and/or recurring protocol deviations reported or identified by the monitor will be discussed 
with the investigative  staff to identify root cause and corrective actions to be implemented to 
prevent recurrence.  Investigator s are expected to participate in this important activity in a serious 
and timely manner.  
15.7.  Coverage of Expenses  
The treated subjects will not be reimbur sed or compensated for participating in the trial , however 
reimbursement for actual travel expenses related to study -required follow -up is allowed and will 
be stated clearly in the informed consent form when applicable . 
15.8.  Confidentiality  
Confidentiality of subjects will be maintained throughout the trial.  A unique identification code 
will be assigned to each subject participating in this trial.  Any data that may be published in 
abstracts, scientific journals, or presented at medical meetings will reference  a unique subject 
code and will not reveal the subject’s identity.  The Sponsor  and their CRO representative will 
make every reasonable effort to protect the confidentiality of the subjects participating in the 
trial.

Your Consent  
You are invited to take part in this research project at (insert hospital / facility name) . The purpose of 
this clinical study is to evaluate a new device designed to close the veins  in your legs  that will be 
punctured as part of your heart procedure. The devices are used at the end of the procedure.   This 
consent form will provide you with information about the study, the procedures that will be performed, and your rights.  
 This consent form may contain words that you do not understand. Plea se ask the study doctor or the 
study staff to explain any words or information that you do not clearly understand.  You may take home a copy of this form so that you can think and discuss with your family, friends, or local health care provider  before maki ng a decision to take part  in this study.  
Purpose & Background of the Study  
Your doctor has  explained to you that you need a procedure to treat your irregular heart beat.   As part 
of this procedure, the doctor will put several hole s in your leg veins  in or der to insert the medical 
equipment that is needed to perform the  procedure. Once the doctor is finished with your procedure,  
these hole s will need to be sealed (closed up) to prevent bleeding. You are being asked to participate in 
a research study to help  evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new  vascular closure device  
developed by Cardiva Medical, called the Venous Vascular Closure System (VVCS) . The device is used to 
close the leg vein  hole s that were  punctured during your procedure. A small collag en (cotton -like)  patch 
is placed just outside of the vein  to plug the hole and stop the bleeding.   
Cardiva Medical developed a similar version of this device that is used to close holes in leg arteries  called 
the VASCADE Vascular Closure System. The VASCAD E device was tested in a large clinical study and 
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012, and has been used and sold in the United States since that time.  
The new device  (“study device”)  has some minor changes to it that make it more suitable for use in 
closing holes in veins, and now it must be tested in a new clinical study to show that it has similar results 
to the VASCADE device.

Roll-In Informed Consent_PTL 0508-03                                   Page 2 of 7 This study will enroll about  204 patients  and up to 60 Roll -In patients at up to 20 hospitals  in the United 
States.  At each hospital, each of the study doctors  will enroll at least one “roll- in” patient  prior to 
enrolling patients in the randomized study ( where there is a 50:50 chance of receiving the study device 
or manual compression to close  the hole s). For each roll -in patient such as you (if you agree to take part 
in the study), the use of the study device will be done under the direct supervision of a representative of 
Cardiva Medical. In addition, the doctors may also have a trained  assistant  perform a roll- in case. This 
“assistant” is a medical professional who is qualified by training and experience, and who assists the 
study doctor with deploying one or  all of the device s you will receive  during your procedure, under 
direct supervision of the study doctor .  
 If you choose to take part in the study, you will receive the study device to close off each of the leg vein 
holes. The collagen patch is considered investigational for use in veins (not approved for sale ). 
 Your participation in t his study w ill last  30 days (± 7 days). The expected total time for all patients to 
complete the study is about 9 months.   
 What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this research? 
If you agree to be in this study, the first step is signing of this consent form.  T he following will then 
happen to you:  
Pre- Procedure  Before the procedure  you will have a medical interview  to make sure you qua lify 
for the study  (are eligible to take part in the study)  and you will have your blood 
drawn (approximately 1 -2 teaspoons) for laboratory testing  (creatinine, platelet 
count, hem oglobin, hematocrit , and INR if on w arfarin ). These are normal blood 
tests that are drawn before a procedure like yours.  
Procedure  During the procedure  your doctor  will insert  3 or 4 small plastic tube s to gain 
access to the large veins  in both of your leg s (femoral veins ).  He /she  will then 
insert small tubes of various sizes into each of these access sites  so that the 
medical equipment needed to perform you r heart procedure can be inserted 
into your body for use. Since you will receive bloo d thinning medications as part 
of your regular  procedure, your doctor will monitor your blood to determine 
how long it takes you to stop bleeding.  
 When your doctor  is finished with the procedure and your doctor feels it  is okay 
for you to take part in the study , your doctor and/or the assistant  will insert a 
small device (study device) in the tube  into each one of the vein holes in  your 
leg.  The device will implant a collagen patch  to close or seal- off the hole s in 
your  veins . Light pre ssure may  be held for a couple of minutes after the device is 
implanted.  
Post -Procedure  After the procedure, the puncture site (place where the hole was made for the 
heart catheters) will be checked often to make sure it is not bleeding.    
After you get up to walk, but before you are discharged from the hospital you will be given a short “Patient Experience Survey” to complete. It will ask you

for the study only and will not be part of your medical records.  
 
30 days   You will need to  come in thirty ( ± 7) days  after the procedure to be checked by 
the doctor.  He /she  will check the place where the holes w ere in your leg s to 
make sure they  have healed properly.   
These are normal steps used in this type of heart procedure.   
 
Possible Risks  
 The safety of this device has been tested and proven in several previous research studies of over 350 human patients without serious problems or deaths. The collagen patch is sim ilar to other collagen -
based closure devices used in surgery to close small holes.  In a large FDA approval study  called RESPECT , 
a total of 417 subjects were enrolled. Two -thirds (275 patients) received the VASCADE device, and one -
third (142) received man ual compression to close a single  artery hole  (femoral artery). Safety results 
were similar in both groups . 
 Possible side effects (problems) are similar to other closure devices and “manual compression” . Of the 
possible side effects listed below, there were no reports of these events occurring in the 275 VASCADE patients, except as noted for each event listed (i.e., %  of patients experiencing an event):  
• allergic response (to the material in the device or collagen)  
• arterio -venous fistula (abnormal connectio n between artery and vein)  (0.4%) 
• bleeding/oozing from the puncture site  (2.9%) ; bleeding requiring transfusion (0%)  
• bruising at the puncture site (<0.05%)  
• death  
• deep vein thrombosis (thrombus formation  in a vein in the leg ) (1%) 
• device failure / malfuncti on (4%)  
• edema (swelling in the tissues)  
• embolization (thrombus, air, calcific debris,  device floating downstream)  
• hematoma (bleeding under the skin)  (2%) 
• infection at the access site  
• inflammatory response (inflammation)

Your Consent  
You are invited to take part in this research project at (insert hospital / facility name) . The purpose of 
this clinical study is to evaluate a new device designed to close the veins  in your legs  that will be 
punctured as part of your hear t procedure. The device s are used at the end of the procedure.   This 
consent form will provide you with information about the study, the procedures that will be performed, and your rights.  
 This consent form may contain words that you do not understand. Please ask the study doctor or the 
study staff to explain any words or information that you do not clearly understand.  You may take home a copy of this form so that you can think and discuss with your family, friends, or local health care provider  before making a decision to take part  in this study.  
Purpose & Background of the Study  
Your doctor has  explained to you that you need a procedure to treat your irregular heart beat.   As part 
of this procedure, the doctor will put several hole s in your leg veins  in to order insert the medical 
equipment that is needed to perform the  procedure. Once the doctor is finished with your procedure,  
these hole s will need to be sealed (closed up) to prevent bleeding. You are being asked to participate in 
a research study to help evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new  vascular closure device  
developed by Cardiva Medical, called the Venous Vascular Closure System (VVCS) . The device is used to 
close the leg vein  hole s that were  punctured during your procedure. A small co llagen  (cotton -like)  patch 
is placed just outside of the vein  to plug the hole and stop the bleeding.   
Cardiva Medical developed a similar version of this device that is used to close holes in leg arteries  called 
the VASCADE Vascular Closure System. The VA SCADE device was tested in a large clinical study and 
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012, and has been used and sold in the United States since that time.  
The new device  (“study device”)  has some minor changes to it that make it more suitable for use in 
closing holes in veins, and now it must be tested in a new clinical study to show that it has similar results 
to the VASCADE device.  
CIP + Attach page number: Page 77 of 99
Randomized Informed Consent_PTL 0508-03                                 Page 2 of 8 If you choose to take part in  the study, you will be randomly (like the flip ping of a coin) assigned to one 
of two  groups: a “ study group” in which the collagen patch  (Cardiva V VCS study device ) is used, or a 
“control group” in which it is not.  The collagen patch is considered investigational for use in veins (not 
approved for sale).  I n the “control  group” , you will not have the device, but will have  firm pressure 
placed on the leg vein  hole s for the amount of time it takes for the vein  to clot and stop bleeding. This is 
known as “manual compression” and is a usual way of closing the venous holes  for this procedure.    
 
A “randomized stu dy” means that you will have a 1 :1 chance  (equal chance ) of being placed  in either 
group , with an equal number  of patients receiving the collagen patch as those who will receive manual 
compression . To determine which group you will be in, an electronic data system will randomly assign 
you to either treatment group. Your study doctor  will not be able to choose which group you are 
assigned to. If you are assigned to the collagen patch  (“study”) group and any problems arise  that make 
it difficult or unsafe to use the device, your study doctor  will decide whether to go ahead and use the 
device or to proceed with manual compression to close the hole s in your veins . Your study doctor may 
have an assistant who is trained to use the device help with deploying one or all of the study devices. Your study doctor will directly supervise and make all decisions about the procedure, even when an assistant is used.  
 This study will enroll about  204 patients  and 60 roll-in patients (traini ng cases)  at up to 20 hospitals  in 
the United States. Your participation in t his study will last 30 days (± 7 days). The expected total time for 
all patients to complete the study is about 9 months.    What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this resear ch? 
If you agree to be in this study, the first step is signing of this consent form.  The following will then 
happen to you:  
Pre- Procedure  Before the procedure  you will have a medical interview  to make sure you qua lify 
for the study  (are eligible to take part in the study)  and you will have your blood 
drawn (approximately 1 -2 teaspoons) for laboratory testing  (creatinine, platelet 
count, hem oglobin, hematocrit , INR if on w arfarin ). These are normal blood 
tests that are drawn before a procedure like yours.  
Procedure  During the procedure  your doctor will insert  3 or 4 small plastic tube s to gain 
access to the large veins  in both of your leg s (femoral veins ).  He /she  will then 
insert small tubes of various sizes into each of these access sites  so that the 
medi cal equipment needed to perform you r heart  procedure can be inserted 
into your body for use. Since you will receive bloo d thinning medications as part 
of your regular  procedure, your doctor will monitor your blood to determine 
how long it takes you to stop  bleeding.  
 When your doctor  is finished with the procedure and your doctor feels it is okay 
for you to take part in the study , he/she  will log in to a study web site to find out 
which treatment (group) you will be assigned  to, to close the holes in the veins.  
• If assigned to the “study group ”, your study doctor  and possibly a 
trained assistant  will insert a small device (study device) in the tube  into 
each one of the vein holes in  your leg .  The device  will implant a

Randomized Informed Consent_PTL 0508-03                                 Page 3 of 8 collagen patch  to close or seal -off the hole s in your veins . Light pre ssure 
may  be held for a couple of minutes after the device is implanted.  
• If assigned to the “control” group, your study doctor and/or an assistant  
will apply pressure over each one of the vein holes in your legs  until the 
blood clots and there is no evidence of bleeding. This is the usual  
procedure for closing these veins . 
Post -Procedure  After the procedure, the puncture site (place where the hole was made for the 
heart catheters) will be checked often to make sure it is not b leeding.    
 After you get up to walk, but before you are discharged from the hospital you will be given a short “Patient Experience Survey” to complete. It will ask you how you feel about the time you were on bedrest after  your procedure. This is 
for the study only and will not be part of your medical records.  
30 days   You will need to  come in thirty ( ± 7) days  after the procedure to be checked by 
the doctor.  He /she  will check the place where the holes w ere in your leg s to 
make sure they  have healed prope rly.   
Ultrasound Study  [selected sites to add this section]  
About 50 patients will be included in a small sub- study to rec eive an ultrasound 
procedure. The  ultrasound will be taken to look for any problems where the 
tube s were in both of your leg s, and will be done in both groups of patients for 
comparison . It does not use x- rays and is done by placing a wand on the skin.  It 
usually takes about an hour to perform the test.  It rarely causes any pain or discomfort. This test will be done at the time of yo ur 30 day visit  if you agree to 
be a part of this sub -study . 
 
These are normal steps used in this type of heart procedure.  The only difference is that you have a 
50:50  chance  that your doctor will be using a device to close the venous  hole s to stop the bl eeding 
instead of  holding longer pressure on th e hole s to stop the bleeding.  
 Possible Risks  
 The safety of this device has been tested and proven in several previous research studies of over 350 human patients without serious problems or deaths. The coll agen patch is similar to other collagen -
based closure devices used in surgery to close small holes.  In a large FDA approval study  called RESPECT , 
a total of 417 subjects were enrolled. Two -thirds (275 patients) received the VASCADE device, and one -
third ( 142) received manual compression to close a single  artery hole  (femoral artery). Safety results 
were similar in both groups . 
 Possible side effects (problems) are similar to other closure devices and “manual compression” . Of the 
possible side effects liste d below, there were no reports of these events occurring in the 275 VASCADE 
patients, except as noted for each event listed (i.e., %  of patients experiencing an event):  
• allergic response (to the material in the device or collagen)

• bleeding/oozing from the puncture site  (2.9%) ; bleeding requiring transfusion (0%)  
• bruising at the puncture site (<0.05%)  
• death  
• deep vein thrombosis (thrombus formation  in a vein  in the leg ) (1%) 
• device failure / malfunction  (4%)  
• edema (swelling in the tissues)  
• embolization (thrombus, air, calcific debris,  device floating downstream)  
• hematoma (bleeding under the skin)  (2%) 
• infection at the access site  
• inflammatory response (inflammation)  
• intimal tear / diss ection (tear of the leg vein or artery wall)  
• laceration of the vessel wall 
• lower extremity  ischemia (lack of oxygen to the leg)  
• peripheral nerve injury (nerve damage to the leg)  (<0.05%)  
• perforation of the vessel wall (puncture of the vessel wall)  
• pseudoan eurysm (abnormal collection of blood with persistent flow outside an artery due to 
a leaking hole in the artery due to injury)  (1.8%) 
• pulmonary embolism (blo ckage of an artery in the lungs)  
• puncture site pain (1%)  
• retroperitoneal bleeding (bleeding in the area behind the abdomen ) (<0.05%)  
• vasospasm (spasm of the artery)  
• vasovagal response (slowed heart rate with possible fainting)  
• vascular injury requiring repair (vessel damage requiring repair)  
• vessel occlusion (blockage of the artery or vein)  
• vessel thro mbus (blood clot in the artery or vein)  
• wound dehiscence (separation of wound edges)  
 
There are other general risks that are associated with your entire procedure, and your doctor will tell 
you about those separately.  
 The risks to an unborn baby conceived  during the study are unknown. Therefore, women in the study 
should practice acceptable pregnancy prevention methods during the stud y. Pregnant or lactating 
women cannot take part in the stud y. However, breastfeeding women may decide to stop nursing, after  
discussing it with their physician, in order to take part in the stud y.

MID-BORE  Venous Vascular Closure System (VVCS) Model 800 -612C 
INSTRUCTIONS  FOR U SE 
IFU 3972  Rev - 03  
For Investigational Use Only   
CAUTION – Federal (USA) law restricts this device to sale by or on the order  of a physician 
DESCR IPTION 
The MID-BORE  Venous Vascular C losure System (VVCS) Model 
800-612C is intended to seal the femoral vein access site(s) at 
the completion of the procedure.  The system is de signed to 
deliver a resorbable Collagen Patch, extra-vascularly, at the 
venotomy  site to aid in achieving he mostasis.  The device can 
be used in 6F to 12F,  12cm1 introducer sheaths. The system 
consists of a sterile disposable Vascular Closure Catheter which 
houses a resorbable Co llagen Patch, and the MID-BORE VVCS  
Clip (refer to Figure 1). The collagen pat ch is composed of type 
I Bovine collagen and is delivered in a compressed form that is 
approximately 15mm in length.  The dry weight of the collagen is 
12mg ± 3mg.   The patch expands  as a result of rehydration 
in the presence of blood in the tissue tract to p rovide an 
extravascular seal.  A radiopaque proximal marker band  on the 
Catheter provides means  to aid in verifying placement of the 
patch in the tissue tract adjacent to the femoral venotomy  site 
prior to the release of the patch.  A second distal marker band 
locates the distal tip of the MID-BORE  VVCS Disc. After 
completion of the  procedure, the MID-BORE  VVCS Cath eter is 
inserted through the introducer sheath.  The MID-BORE  VVCS 
Disc is then deployed within the  vessel and the introducer sheath 
is removed over the MID-BORE  VVCS Catheter.  After the 
introducer sheath is removed, the MID-BORE  VV C S Disc is 
positioned against the intimal aspect of the venotomy , providing 
both temporary hemostasis and  protection from intravascular 
placement of the Collagen Patch, and the MID-BORE VVCS  Clip 
is applied at skin level to maintain the  position of the Disc. After 
confirming the position of the Collagen Patch fluoroscopically, 
the Black Sleeve is un locked and  retracted to  expose the 
Collagen Patch to the tissue tract. The system is left in place for 
a brief dwell period to allow the patch to swell, after which the  
Disc is collapsed and the MID-BORE  VVCS Catheter is removed 
from the vein leaving the resorbable, extra-vascular, hemostatic 
Collagen Patch at the venotomy  site providing hemostasis. 
 
 
 
INDICATIONS FOR USE 
The MID-BORE  Venous Vascular C losure System (VVCS) Model 800 -612C is indicated for the percutaneous closure of 
femoral venous access sites while reducing times to ambulation and discharge eligibility in patients who have undergone 
interventional catheter -based procedures utilizing 6 – 12 F procedural sheaths with sin gle or multiple access sites, ranging 
from a single access site in one limb to multiple access sites in both limbs.

CONTRAINDICATIONS 
The MID-BORE  VVCS should not be used in patients with a known allergy to bovine derivatives. 
 
WARNINGS  
• Do not reuse or re-sterilize. The MID-BORE  VVCS is intended to be u sed once only for a single patient. Product 
reuse or re-sterilization, may result in transmission of infectious or blood borne diseases and/or death. 
• Do not use if components  or packaging appear to be damaged  or defective or if any portion of the packaging has 
been  previously opened.  Damaged or opened packages may compromise product functionality.  
• Do not use if product is beyond the expiration date.  Product performance has not been established beyond  the 
labeled shelf life.  
• Do not deploy the MID-BORE  VVCS Disc in a stent. Do not pull the deployed MID-BORE  VVCS disc through a stent.  
Damage to the product may occur.  
• Do not use MID-BORE VVCS  if access is through a previously placed permanent  closure device such as a metal 
clip.  Interference between the two closure devices may result.  
• Do not deploy the Collagen Patch if there is a suspicion that the MID-BORE VVCS  Disc is not seated ag ainst the 
intimal aspect of the venotomy  site.  Partial or complete obstruction of blood flow may result.  
• Do not deploy a second collagen patch at the same access site within 30 days.  Safety has not been established.  
 
PRECAUTIONS  
• The MID-BORE  VVCS should only be used by a trained licensed physician or healthcare professional.  
• Do not use in access sites where there is suspicion of a “backwall” stick.  Increased bleeding risk may occur.  
• Do not use if venotomy is noted to be a “side stick.”  Bleeding risk may increase.  
• Do not use if venotomy site is noted to be “high,” above the Inguinal Ligament (cephalad to lower half of the 
femoral head or the inferior epigastric artery origin from the external iliac artery).  This may increase the risk of 
bleeding.  
• Do not use in a vein with suspected intraluminal thrombus, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, or  arteriovenous fistula.  
These conditions may complicate proper device use and performance.  
• Do not use if intra -procedural bleeding around the introducer sheath is noted including hematoma formation (sign 
of possible multiple wa ll stick).  This may suggest problems with the access site.  
• Do not use in a procedural sheath > 12cm in length (or >15cm in overall length) or with a diameter other than 6-
12F. This may complicate disk deployment.

DEVICE PREPARATION AND PROCEDU RE 
 
At the time of initial access, if more than one sheath is planned to be placed in the same vein, the distance between the 
access sites should be kept at a minimum of 6 mm.  Keep the stick separation at the skin level at a minimum of 6 mm and 
drive the need les to the vein at the same angle to keep the separation between the adjacent venotomies at a minimum of 6 
mm.  Imaging techniques such as ultrasound to confirm the separation is recommended.  
 
At the time of initial introducer sheath  placement, patient body habitus should be evaluated to provide reasonable 
assurance that the distance between the femoral venotomy and the skin surface is greater than 2.5cm.  After introducer 
sheath  placement, an anterior oblique fluoroscopic image may be digitally recorded and stored, so that the venotomy  site 
location can be estimated and compared to the position of the radiopaque marker just prior to Collagen Patch release. 
The radiopaque marker is located immediately distal to the Collagen Patch. If more than one sheath is used in the same 
vein, it is recommended to close the proximal venotomy first to facilitate device placement and imaging prior to Collagen 
Patch release.  
 
CAUTION: During access care should be taken so that the tissue tract is not pushed laterally or medially prior to accessing 
the vessel. This is to avoid misalignment of the tissue tract and the Collagen Patch relative to the venotomy  site once the device 
is removed from the vessel which may result in prolonged time to hemostasis.   
If more than one access is made in the vein, keep a minimum of 6 mm separation between the access sites.  This is to allow 
the disc to track back to the vessel wall.  Temporary hemostasis may not be achieved if the venotomies are too close to each 
other. 
Not achieving temporary hemostasis may be an indication that the disc is not against the vessel wall.  Releasing the collagen  
patch may result in all or a portion of the p atch to be deployed in the vessel.

2. Inspect the package for damage (breaks, tears, open  seals, water damage, etc.) and verify that expiration date 
has not pa ssed. 
 
3. Using standard sterile technique, remove the tray containing the MID-BORE  VVCS Catheter and Clip from the 
foil pouch.  Ca refully remove MID-BORE  VVCS Catheter and Clip from the tray.  Examine the device by first 
verifying that the Black Sleeve is locked in position and the Collagen Patch is not exposed.  Also verify that the 
Yellow-Blue Key (Figure 2) is not eng aged in the Lock (the Lock is located at the proximal aspect of the Black 
Sleeve), and the Yellow-Blue Key is located at the  proximal end of the Catheter Shaft.  Inspect the Catheter  further 
by examining the deployed MID-BORE  VVCS Disc.  To deploy the  Disc, hold the Silver Handle firmly and pull back 
on the Black Actuator  until it locks in place.  When the Disc is locked in the  deployed position, the Green Segment

will become visible as shown in Figure 3.  Examine the Disc, which should app ear circular and symmetrical 
with an intact membrane.  Figure 4 shows the deployed and collapsed Disc.  After examination, collapse the Disc 
by pressing the Black Actuator tip down (Figure 5).  The tip of the MID-BORE  VVCS Catheter should return to its 
original profile.

4. Verify that the sheath is  not positioned in a tortuous vessel.  If required, retract the sheath slightly to a non-tortuous  
location.  Verify that the sheath is still positioned within the vein.  If more than one sheath is in the vein, retract the 
most proximal sheath (top sheath) so that the distal opening of that sheath is distal to the distal opening of other 
sheaths by 3 -4 cm.  This is to eliminate interference of a deployed disc with other i ndwelling sheaths during device 
deployment.  Deploy MID -BORE VVCS and obtain hemostasis in the most proximal sheath first (as per steps 
outlined below).  Then move distally to repeat the steps to obtain closure for the other sheaths.   
WARNING:  Verify there is no vessel tortuosity or side branches within 3-4 cm from the distal opening of the sheath and the 
end of the sheath is not resting against the vessel wall.  This is to prevent any vascular injury as a result of advancing the 
catheter.  If required, retract the sheath slightly to a non-tortuous location, being careful not to lose vessel access. 
 
5. Flush the sheath with sterile saline solution prior to insertion of the  device. 
6. Prior to insertion of device in the introducer sheath, momentarily insert the tip of the VVCS Catheter in saline 
solution up to the  White Marker Stripe and quickly remove. 
 
CAUTION: Do not soak the MID-BORE  VVCS Catheter in saline. Momentarily insert only the Catheter tip in saline 
solution immediately before use to avoid over-hydration of the patch, which may result in difficulty of retracting the sleeve 
and causing Catheter pull through during the sleeve retraction step. 
 
7. Gently insert the MID-BORE  VVCS Catheter (with disc collapsed) into the introducer sheath hub as shown in 
Figure 6. Use short strokes to insert the device.   
8. Insert the MID-BORE  VVCS Catheter such that approximately half of the Lock is visible.  Make certain that the 
Lock is NOT fully inserted into the sheath.  See Figure 7 for correct placement. 
 
CAUTION: Do not advance MID-BORE  VVCS Catheter into the patient if resistance is felt due to risk of vascular 
damage.

9. Deploy the Disc by holding the Silver Handle and pulling back the Black Actuator  until it locks in place as shown 
in Figure 8. 
 
CIP + Attach page number: Page 89 of 99
Page 5 of 8 CAUTION: Do not continue to pull on the Black Actuator once it is locked in place as this may damage the device. 
 
NOTE: When the Disc is properly deployed, the Green Segment will become visible distal to the Black Actuator.  If 
the catheter  is not properly locked in place, the Black Actuator  will slide back to its original position and the Green 
Segment will disappear indicating that  the Disc is not properly deployed.  In this case repeat the step for deploying the 
Disc by pulling the  Black Actuator  more firmly until it locks in place. 
 
10. Gently remove sheath , without applying any compression at  the access site or holding the MID-BORE  VVCS 
Catheter, as shown in Figure 9.  As the sheath slides over the MID-BORE  VVCS Catheter, grasp the Catheter 
proximal to the LOCK as it exits the distal end of the introducer sheath.  Continue sliding the sheath  over the 
MID-BORE  VVCS Catheter and discard sheath.  
 
CAUTION : Compressing the access site during sheath removal may not allow the Disc to track back to the venotomy  and may ca use 
Disc deformation. This may lead to inability to achieve temporary hemostasis. 
 
11. Apply gentle tension on the Black Actuator  until temporary hemostasis is achieved.  No te whether any portion of 
the White Ma rker Stripe, which is located near the distal aspect of the Black Sleeve, is visible above the skin.  If it 
is, then the length of the  tissue tract is less than 2.5 cm, indicating the tissue tract may not be long enough for the 
Collagen Patch. 
 
WARNING:  If any portion of the White Marker Stripe is showing DO NOT RELEASE  the Collagen Patch as this may increase 
the risk of infection. 
 
NOTE:  If any portion of the White Marker Stripe is showing and the collagen patch is not to be deployed, the MID-
BORE  VVCS Catheter should be removed by collapsing the Disc and manual compression should be applied per 
institutional protocol. 
 
12. Once temporary hemostasis  is achieved, apply the Clip to the Black Sleeve at skin level as shown in Figure 10.  
Utilize fluoroscopy to verify that the deployed Disc is positioned  against the intimal surface of the ve no t om y 
by noting the po sition of the more proximal radiopaque marker.  The marker should be at the venotomy site. The 
Collagen Patch is immediately proximal to this Marker Band.  The Distal Marker Band locates the distal end of the 
Disc. 
 
CAUTION: Applying too much upward tension on the Black Actuator may cause disc to pull out of vessel.  Should this occur, 
convert to your institution’s manual compression protocol.  
WARNING: It is import ant to ensu re that the Disc is in contact with the intimal aspect of the venotomy  before deploying the 
extra- vascu lar Collagen Patch to avoid releasing the Collagen Patch in the vessel.  This is indicated by having temporary 
hemostasis and further verified by fluoroscopy (Figure  11).

EXTRA-VASCULAR COLLAGEN PATCH DEPLOYMENT AND DEVICE REMOVAL 
13. Once the Disc location is verified, expose the extra -vascular resorbable Collagen Patch by unloc king the Black 
Sleeve.  This is done by grasping the Lock with the left hand, between the thu mb and the index finger, and 
grasping the Yellow -Blue K ey with the right hand and then sliding the Yellow -Blue K ey into the Lock  until no  
blue color is visibl e, as  shown in Figure 12 .  Once the Sleeve is unloc ked and while still holding on to the Loc k, 
remove the Clip with the right hand, and gent ly slide the Lock back along the angle of entry to retract the Black 
Sleeve as shown in Figure 13 .  The Black Sleeve  will move freely after so me initial resistance.  A second 
resistance point may be felt after the sleeve is moved appro ximately 1.6 cm (0.6 inch).  
Proceed to fully retract the Black Sleeve proxi mally to the Silver Handle.  This action exposes the Collagen  
Patch extra -vascular ly, which will swell at the arteriotomy site.  The Collagen Patch may be allowed  to swell 
for up to 30 seconds prior to re moval of the MID-BORE  VVCS Catheter.  The Clip may be reapplied during the 
Collagen Patch swell period with minimal tension on the Catheter (Figure 14) . 
 
NOTE:  If the Black Sleeve does not retract easily, recheck that the blue end of the Yellow -Blue Key is fully engaged 
in the Lock.  
 
NOTE:  If the Collagen Patch is removed during sleeve retract ion, collapse the Disc, remove the Catheter and apply 
manual compression, per institutional protocol.

14. AFTER 15-30 seconds of patch swell time and PRIOR TO collapsing the Disk, remove the Clip. Re st the palm of 
the hand  on the patient and grasp the  green  tube between the thumb and the index finger as shown in Figure 15.  
Push the green tube in the proximal direction approximately 1.5 cm while gently pulling back on the MID-BORE  
VVCS Catheter to maintain Disk position against vessel  wall.  The green tube may be slid back and forth 2 -3 times 
in order to assure release of the Collagen patch from device.  Upon completion of this step, leave the green tube in 
the forward position.  A pply gentle compression  at the site and collapse the Di sc by pressing on the Black Actuator  
Tip as shown in Figure 16. Apply g entle manual compression at  the site as th e  MID-BORE  VVCS Catheter is 
removed.  Continue to apply  manual compression. 
 
15. Observe for complete hemostasis.  Manual compression can be used to decrease or stop any tract ooze until full 
hemostasis is achieved. 
 
NOTE:  Prior to the MID-BORE  VVCS Catheter  removal confirm that the Disc is completely collapsed by verifying 
that the Green Segment on the handle is no longer visible.  Care should be taken not to compress too firmly  
over the VVCS catheter during the removal step of the device so that the catheter  can be easily removed and 
without displacement of Collagen Patch.  Note:  The implanted Collagen Patch should not  be affected by Magnetic 
Resonan ce Imaging (MRI). 
 
16. Apply sterile dressing to site per institution protocol. Maintain bed rest and periodically check site until patient is 
ready to ambulate. 
17. Complete information on Patient Implant Card and provide to the patient.

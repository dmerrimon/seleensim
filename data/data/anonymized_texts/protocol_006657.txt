3 Text added to clarify  those randomized to rhEPO who transition from HD to PD will 
change from epoetin alfa to darbepoetin alfa.  
Text relating to the timing of dial ysis in relation to the study  visit has been amended. 
The o riginal text ‘For subjects receiving PD or home HD >3x/week, study  visits 
must occur within 48 hours of their last dial ysis session’ was inaccurate as PD is a 
daily  treatment .
For the negativel y adjudicated events in 200807, the reporting process has been 
updated and the investigator -reported term (not the adjudicator -reported term) will 
be used.
In addition to allowing a historical (last 6 months) kidney  ultrasound to be used to 
assess entry  criteria, a provision was added for a more sensitive imaging stud y (e.g., 
MRI , CT) to be used to assess entry  criteria.

Shortened visit window for the Week 2 and 4 visits and clarified vis it window for 
Week -4 and Day  1 visits.
Modified Time and Events Table 7 ‘Schedule of Assessments Year 1 to End of 
Study ’.  Main changes include addition of Informed Consent activity ; revised 
footnotes to remove Kt/V and URR measurement for daily  HHD and a llowance of 
extended timing to do Day  1 ECG and to do ultrasound and/or additional testing; 
more clarit y around randomized treatment dispensing and compliance, including 
provisions for deferring dose changes till the next HD treatment; removed capture of 
rescue medications from unscheduled and earl y termination visits as rescue 
evaluation is triggered at scheduled visits; added footnote to clarify  biomarkers will 
be stored for future anal yses except if not permitted by IRB/EC or refused by subject;

This Phase 3 study  will evaluate the safet y and efficacy of daprodustat (GSK1278863) 
compared to recombinant human ery thropoietin (rhEPO) in the treatment of anemia 
associated with chronic kidney  disease (CKD) in subjects on dialy sis. 
Primary  Objective(s) /Endpoint(s)
Objectives Endpoints
Co-primary (tested in parallel for non -inferiority)
To compare daprodustat to rhEPO for 
cardiovascular (CV) safety (non -inferiority)Time to first occurrence of adjudicated major 
adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) 
[composite of all -cause mortality, non -fatal 
myocardial infarction (MI) and non -fatal stroke]
To compare daprodustat to rhEPO for 
hemoglobin (Hgb) efficacy (non -inferiority)Mean change in Hgb between baseline and 
evaluation period (EP, mean over Weeks 28 to 
52)
Overall Design
This is a randomized, open -label (sponsor blind), active -controlled, parallel -group, 
multi -center, event -driven study  in dialy sis subjects with anemia associated with

Type and Number of Subjects
This study  will randomize approximately  3000 dialy sis subjects (1500 per t reatment 
arm) with anemia associated with CKD currently  receiving an ESA and with a 
baseline HemoCue Hgb 8 -11.5 g/dL. 
Subjects may  be on hemodialy sis (HD) or peritoneal dial ysis (PD). PD subjects will 
be restricted to no more than 15% of the overall study population.  
Analysis
The study ’s co -primary  endpoints will each be tested for non -inferiorit y using a one-sided
2.5% significance level and the relevant confidence bound from a two -sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) (upper bound for MACE and lower bound for the Hgb co -
primary  endpoint) . 
For CV safet y, the primary question is whether daprodustat is non -inferior to rhEPO for 
adjudicated MACE. An Intent -to-Treat (ITT) analy sis of time to the first occurrence of 
adjudicated MACE using a margin of 1. 25 and a Cox Proportional Hazards regression 
model adjusting for treatment and prognostic randomization stratification factors (dial ysis 
type and region), will be used. 
For Hgb efficacy , the primary  question is whether daprodustat is non -inferior to rhEPO 
for change from baseline in central laboratory  Hgb. The anal ysis will be based on the 
mean change in Hgb between baseline and the efficacy  EP (defined as Weeks 28 to 52) 
using a non -inferiorit y margin of -0.75 g/dL. An analy sis of the ITT Population and an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used. The model will include 
prognostic randomization stratification factors (dialy sis type and region), and factors for 
baseline Hgb and treatment.
Non-inferiorit y needs to be met for both co -primary  endpoints fo r the study  to be 
considered successful.

152. INTRODUCTION
2.1. Brief Background
Daprodustat (GSK1278863) is a hy poxia -inducible factor prol yl hydroxy lase inhibitor 
(HIF -PHI) currently  being investigated as a treatment for anemia associated with CKD in 
both dialy sisand non- dialy sis (ND) subjects, with adequate safet y and efficacy  having 
been demonstrated in clinical trials up to 24 weeks’ duration. Both pre -clinical and 
clinical data show that daprodustat stimulates ery thropoietin (EPO) production resulting 
in incre ased ery thropoiesis and elevation in Hgb concentrations. These increases in Hgb 
are achieved with peak plasma EPO exposures substantially  lower than those observed 
with rhEPO. Data from completed clinical and preclinical studies are provided in the 
current Investigator Brochure (IB) and IB supplement(s) (if applicable).
2.2. Stud y Rationale
Based on its mechanism of action to stimulate erythropoiesis via inhibition of HIF -prolyl 
hydroxylase enz ymes,
A Phase 2B clinical trial in dialy sis subjects with anemia a ssociated with CKD 
demonstrated that daprodustat can maintain Hgb up to 24 weeks, with minimal effects on 
plasma EPO concentration.  Daprodustat treatment for up to 24 weeks demonstrated an 
adverse event (AE) profile consistent with the patient population. Data from completed 
clinical studies are provided in the current IB and IB supplement(s) (if applicable).
This Phase 3 study  in dialy sis subjects with anemia associated with CKD will evaluate 
the safet y and efficacy of daprodustat compared to rhEPO, the c urrent standard of care, as 
co-primary  endpoints, following switch from ESAs. Both co -primary  endpoints must 
meet non -inferiority  of daprodustat to rhEPO for the study  to be successful and for 
analyses to progress to testing principal secondary endpoints. Data from this trial are 
intended to support the use of daprodustat for the treatment of anemia associated with 
CKD in patients on dialysis.

4. STUDY DESIGN
4.1. Overall Design
This is a randomized, open -label (sponsor blind), active -controlled, parallel -group, 
multi -center, event -driven study  in dialy sis subjects with anemia associated with 
CKD who are currently  treated with ESAs2.
                                                2ESAs refer to any rhEPO or methoxy PEG -epoetin beta.

17This study  will comprise four study  periods ( Figure 1):  a 4 -week screening period, a 
4-week placebo run -in period, a treatment period and a follow -up period. Prior ESA 
therap y continues during the screening and run -in periods.  
The treat ment period consists of  :
1.The stabilization period , defined as the period from Day  1 to Week 28 during 
which randomized treatment will be dose titrated to achieve the appropriate Hgb 
target 
2.The maintenance period , defined as the period from the end of the stabilization 
period (Week 28) to the end of treatment (variable per subject), to assess long 
term safet y and efficacy. 
oThe efficacy  evaluation period (EP) is defined as the period from Week 28 
to Week 52 during which Hgb efficacy  will primarily  be assessed.
The total duration of the study  is dependent upon the accumulation of 664 
adjudicated first MACE (i.e., it is event -driven) unless review of interim data by  the 
IDMC recommends bringing the stud y to an earl ier close. 
All subjects will remain in the study  (including subjects receiving kidney  transplant), 
regardless of whether they continue with randomized treatment (unless consent for 
any further follow up is withdrawn), until the target number of first adju dicated 
MACE has occurred.  At that point, the sponsor will notify  investigators to have 
subjects come in for an End of Study  visit within a pre -defined time period.
The end of the stud y will occur after the accumulation of 664adjudicated first 
MACE and the last subject has completed their last required stud y visit (Section 7.1). 
Subjects will be stratified by  dialysis type [HD*or PD], by  region (see Appendix 3 ), 
and by  participation in the ABPM sub -study . Dialy sis ty pe and region are 
stratification factors considered to be potentiall y prognostic ally important, i.e., 
predictive of study  endpoints while participation in the ABPM sub -study  is an 
administrative stratification factor intended solely  to ensure a similar number of sub -
study  subjects in each of the two randomized grou ps.  
* HD group also includes hemodiafiltration (HDF) or hemofiltration (HF).
Following stratification, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive oral daprodustat 
or rhEPO (IV epoetin alfa for HD subjects and SC darbepoetin alfa for PD subjects). 
A central randomization approach will be used to protect against potential selection 
bias due to the open -label design. The sponsor is blinded to treatment assignment in 
the main study  and ABPM sub -study .
Both treatment arms (daprodustat and rhEPO) will foll ow a protocol -specified 
randomized treatment dose adjustment algorithm to achieve and/or maintain Hgb 
within the target range of 10 -11 g/dL (Section 6.3.3 ). Dose changes will be made 
programmaticall y by the Interactive Response Technology  (IRT) sy stem for both 
randomized treatment arms.

18To ensure subjects remain iron replete and to minimize the potential for iron 
overload during the study , the investi gator will follow the iron management criteria 
(Section 6.11.1 ) from randomization through the end of the study  treatment period.
A rescue algorithm is provided to minimize subjects having an inadequate response to 
the treatment for their anemia for an extended period of time and to enable 
consistency  in the application of rescue therapy  across the study (Section 6.12).
An overview of the stud y design is provided in Figure 1.
Figure 1 Study  Schematic
This study  will include the following sub -studies:
ABPM sub -study  (Appendix 12 )
Pharmacokinetic (PK) sub -study  (Appendix 13 )
An external independent Clinical Events Committee will conduct blinded 
adjudication of all events reported during this study that may  meet the definition of 
the co -primary  safet y endpoint of MACE and additional endpoints as outlined in 
Section 7.4.1 and Section 10.8.2 . 
An external IDMC will monitor the safet y and efficacy data from the study 
(Section 10.8.1 ).
4.2. Type and Number of Subjects
This study  will randomize approximately  3000 dialy sis subjects (1500 per treatment 
arm) with anemia associated with CKD currently  receiving an ESA and with a 
baseline HemoCue Hgb 8 -11.5 g/dL (Section 5.1). 
Subjects may  be on HD or PD. PD subjects will be restricted to no more than 15% of 
the overall stud y population.  
4.3. Design Rationale
This study  includes both a 4 week screening and a 4 week placebo run -in period prior to 
randomization (Day  1). The screening period permits eligibility  based on laboratory  
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
19assessments to be confirmed, while the run -in period will be used to establish compl iance 
with placebo and stud y procedures in an attempt to minimize withdrawn consent post -
randomization. 
The stabilization period from Day  1 to Week 28 allows subjects to have their randomized 
treatment dose titrated to achieve the Hgb target range. This p eriod of time provides the 
best opportunity  for subjects to be titrated to their optimal dose of randomized treatment 
prior to the efficacy  EP ( Weeks 28 to 52 ). A percentage of subjects may  still need dose 
titration during the EP. After Week 52, minimal do se changes may  be required to 
maintain Hgb within the target range.
The selection of the rhEPO control (epoetin alfa for HD subjects; darbepoetin alfa for PD 
subjects) is based on clinical practice in the majority  of participating countries. 
This study  will be open -label (sponsor blind) because it would be complex to double -
blind due to the differing number of dose steps between randomized treatments, leading 
to potential dosing errors. Additionally , it is potentially  unethical to blind the different 
route of administration of randomized treatment.
4.4. Dose Justification
Starting doses, dose steps, and elements of the dose adjustment scheme are provided in 
Section 6.3and Appendix 6 .
4.4.1. Daprodustat
Daprodustat starting doses were selected to reach the target Hgb concentration after 
approximately  one red blood cel l (RBC) lifespan of treatment (almost 3 months, 
pharmacod ynamic stead y-state), without the need for an y individual dose adjustments.  
However, due to the between -subject variabilit y in Hgb response to a given dose of 
daprodustat and the relatively  narrow H gb target range, individual dose adjustments of 
daprodustat are expected during the first few months of treatment. 
The daprodustat starting doses and dose steps (including the highest dose level, 24 mg) 
selected for this study  are consistent with those ut ilized in the completed 6 -month Phase 
2B studies, and were based on exposure -response longitudinal modeling of Hgb data 
collected across the Phase 2 program. Covariate analy ses elucidated that baseline Hgb, 
body -weight, and prior ESA dose (if applicable) w ere the most relevant covariates of Hgb 
response to daprodustat.  Simulations showed the effect of bod y-weight was not clinically  
important for dosing, but the relationship between prior ESA dose and response was used 
to determine starting doses of daprodu stat relative to a subject’s prior ESA dose. 
Starting doses of 4, 6, 8 and 12 mg were selected and are estimated to maintain Hgb 
levels observed with their prior ESA therap y.
4.4.2. Randomized Treatment Dose A djustment Scheme
A randomized treatment (daprodustat and rhEPO) dose adjustment algorithm was 
designed to minimize unnecessary  dose adjustments by  allowing for visit -to-visit 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
20variability , and it is informed by  the change in Hgb from the previous visit when 
evaluating the need for a dose adjustment ( Appendix 6 ).   
4.5. Benefit:Risk A ssessment
Summaries of findings from both clinical and non-clinical studies conducted with 
daprodustat can be found in the daprodustat IB and IB supplement(s) (if applicable). 
4.5.1. Risk A ssessment
The potential risks of clinical significance including AEs of special interest 
(Section 7.4.4 ), and the mitigation strategies for this protocol taking into account the 
results of completed clinical and nonclinical studies with daprodustat, are outlined in 
Appendix 4 .  In addition to the mitigation strategies outlined, an IDMC will monitor 
accruing safet y  data for this trial (Section 10.8.1 ).
4.5.2. Benefit A ssessment
In clinical trials of up to 24 weeks in duration, in subjects with anemia associated with 
CKD, daprodustat has been shown to treat Hgb to target range. Daprodustat may  present 
several important advantages over rhEPO and its analogs .  It is an oral medicati on and 
does not require cold -chain storage as does rhEPO, thus increasing ease of use for 
patients and health care providers.  
 
.  Treatment of anemia of CKD with rhEPO is associated with increased CV risk 
which is postulated to be related to the associated increases in EPO exposure with rhEPO 
[Szczech, 2008];
4.5.3. Overall Benefit:Risk Conclusion
Daprodustat demonstrates a positive benefit vs. risk based on the evidence as follows. In 
clinical trials up to 24 weeks in duration, daprodustat treats Hgb to target range, and there 
are no adverse events that have been identified as related to treatment with daprodustat.
This protocol employ s precautions to mitigate known and potential risks to randomized 
subjects (See Appendix 4 ). Given these precautions, as well as the potential benefit that 
daprodustat holds for the treatment of anemia associated with CKD compared to the 
current standard, the overall benefit risk balan ce is considered to be positive.

consequences of the study. 
5.3. Screening/ Run-in Failures
Screen failures are defined as subjects who consent to participate in the clinical trial but 
are not subsequently  randomized. A minimum set of information must be collected from 
subjects that fail screening including Demograph y, Screen Failure details, Eli gibility  
Criteria, and SAEs (Section 7.4.3.4 ).
Subjects that fail screening are eligible to be rescreened up to three additional times as 
soon as th e investigator assesses they  may  meet study  entry  criteria. If subjects are 
rescreened, they must sign a new informed consent form.
5.4. Subject Retention
Subjects will be educated on the importance of remaining in the study  and attending 
scheduled stud y visits.
Investigators should make every effort to keep subjects in the trial. 
Should a subject fail to attend the clinic for a required study  visit, the site should 
attempt to contact the subject and re -schedule the missed visit as soon as possible. 
The s ite should also counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule. In cases where the subject does not return for the rescheduled 
visit or cannot be reached to reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every 
effort to regain contact with the subject. The investigator (dependent on local 
regulations) should obtain the name and phone number of a relative or friend to assist 
in contacting the subject.
5.5. Permanent Discontinuation of Randomized Treatment
Every  effort should b e made to keep subjects in the study including those who 
permanentl y stop randomized treatment . A subject may  permanentl y discontinue 
randomized treatment at any  time at his/her own request, or at the discretion of the 
investigator for safet y or compliance reasons.  A subject must permanentl y discontinue 
randomized treatment for the pre -specified reasons below. 
Kidney  transplant
Meets criterion to receive rescue (Section 6.12)
Becomes pregnant or intends to become pregnant during the stud y.
Liver chemistry  abnormalities exceeding the threshold criteria (Section 7.4.12 ).
Diagnosis of cancer (new or recurrent), with the exception of localized squamous 
cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.
Need for more than 14 day s use of prohibited medication (Section 6.10.2 )
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
25In all cases, the reason for randomized treatment discontinuation and the date of the last 
dose will be recorded in the subject’s electronic case report form (eCRF) and the subject
will continue in the study as described in Section 5.5.1 .  
Subjects may  be reapproached about restarting randomized treatment in certain 
circumst ances if the sponsor and the investigator agree.
5.5.1. Procedures for Subject Follow -up
Subjects who permanently discontinue randomized treatment will be asked to attend an 
Early Treatment Discontinuation visit and will be expected to attend study visits through
the End of Study  visit, according to the stud y visit schedule, unless consent is actively 
withdrawn. Complete details are provided in the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1).
Early Treatment Discontinuation visit:  This visit should occur within 2 weeks of 
stopping randomized treatment. 
Remaining in -clinic visits*:
Day 1 through Week 52:  Study  visits at Weeks 4, 16, 28, 40 and 52.
Week 52 through end of study :  Study  visits every 12 weeks.  
End of Study  visit: as defined by  the sponsor within a pre -defined time period.
*Phone visit acceptable in exceptional circumstances.  
If a subject does not agree to continue attending in -clinic or phone visits, other follow -up 
options to collect study  outcomes and vital status should be pursued according to local 
laws and regulations. If one of these alternate methods to collect study  outcomes and vital 
status is acce ptable to the subject, then the subject will be considered to have remained in 
the study  and not to have withdrawn consent.
5.6. Withdrawal from Study
For subjects that choose to withdraw consent or are lost to follow up, the reason for not 
completing the stud ywill be recorded in the subject’s eCRF. 
If a subject withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any  clinical 
samples taken, and the investigator must document this in the site study  records.
5.6.1. Withdrawal of Consent for Contact
Specific wor ding is included in the informed consent form which permits subjects to 
discontinue randomized treatment or stud y procedures, but states an expectation that 
follow up information will alway s be required. Subjects will agree to this at the time of 
consentin g.
Withdrawal of consent from the study  is expected to be a rare occurrence.  If a subject 
expresses a wish to withdraw consent from the study , the investigator will review the 
following contact options with the subject.
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
26In-clinic and phone visits
Follow -up via medical records review and/or other treating ph ysician
Follow -up via family  member or other third part y contact
If all of these options are refused, then no further study  visits or study -related telephone 
contacts will be conducted and the subject wi ll be considered to have withdrawn consent. 
The principal investigator will be required to document that all alternative options have 
been reviewed with the subject.
For these subjects, information regarding vital status will continue to be collected from 
available sources including those in the public domain based on accepted local laws and 
regulations. Where permitted, a third part y ma y be used to obtain information.
5.6.2. Subjects Deemed Lost to Follow -up
Investigators should make every effort to contact subje cts who are deemed lost to 
follow -up and who have not withdrawn consent to follow -up contact.
As permitted by  local regulations, a third party  may  be used to locate alternative 
subject contact information that will be provided to the investigator. All atte mpts to 
contact subjects will be documented in the subject’s source notes and a final status 
contact will be recorded in the eCRF. 
5.7. Subject and Study  Completion
A completed subject is one who has completed all periods of the stud y through the End of 
Study  visit with the following exception: subjects who die while on study  are also 
considered as having completed the study .
6. PLACEBO RUN -IN AND R ANDOMIZED TREA TMENT
6.1. Placebo Run -in and Randomized Treatment
Prior to randomization, oral placebo tablets will be dispensed at Week -4 with 
instructions to take one tablet daily  through the run -in period.
The term ‘randomized treatment’ is used throughout the protocol to describe either stud y 
treatment (i.e., daprodustat, darbepoetin alfa or epoetin alfa) received by  the subject 
during the treatment period as per the protocol design .  Randomized treatment will be 
provided b y GSK3. 
During the treatment period, iron therap y (supplied locally) will be administered as per 
the iron management criteria (Section 6.11.1 ).  
                                                3If the supply to the site is interrupted due to unexpected circumstances (e.g., natural disaster), local 
standard of care for anemia management may be considered during that time period, w ithout the need to 
withdraw the subject from the study or to permane ntly discontinue randomized treatment.

27Daprodustat will be supplied as film coated tablets for oral administration containing 1, 2, 
4, 6, 8, and 10 mg of daprodustat.  Doses of 12, 16, and 24 mg of daprodustat will be 
provided using multiples of these tablet strengths.  The doses, tablet size, and description 
are provided in Table 1. Subjects are to take the daprodustat tablet(s) daily  with water, 
and these tablets can be taken without regard to food.

Daprodustat Dose Steps:
The available dose steps of daprodustat are outlined below.  Dose adjustments will result 
in the daprodustat dose being increased or decreased by  one dose step at a time.  Those 
receiving the highest dose of daprodustat who require a dose increase will maintain the 
same dose, while those receiving the lowest dose of daprodustat that require a dose 
decrease will have doses withheld.  
6.3.2. rhEPO Dosing Information
rhEPO Starting Dose :
The starting dose for subjects receiving rhEPO is as follows:
For subjects with a baseline (Day  1) Hgb ≤11 g/dL 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
29-For subjects alread y on epoetin alfa (HD subjects) or darbepoetin alfa (PD 
subjects), the starting dose will be the same as their currently  scheduled dose, 
rounded to the nearest study  dose. 
-Forsubjects receiving other ty pes of ESAs, the starting dose will be an IV epoetin 
alfa (HD subjects) or SC darbepoetin alfa (PD subjects) equivalent dose, rounded 
to the nearest stud y dose.
For subjects with a baseline (Day  1) Hgb >11 g/dL and 11.5 g/dL
-The starting dose of IV epoetin alfa (HD subjects) or SC darbepoetin alfa (PD 
subjects) will be reduced to the next lowest starting dose with the aim of 
maintaining Hgb within the range of 10 -11 g/dL.
rhEPO Dose Steps:
Dose -steps of rhEPO are pre -defined i n this study  (Table 4and Table 5). The IV epoetin 
alfa dose steps consist of stepwise increase or decrease in weekl y dose of 20 to 33% for 
most steps, except when weekl y doses of 3000 U or when weekl y doses are >21000 U 
per week when further increases are within the 10 to 15% range.  The darbepoetin alfa 
dose adjustment increases and decreases will be in similar steps as compared to epoetin 
alfa, generall y within the 20 to 33% range with a few increases of 50% based on 
available dose strengths. In some cases, a partial amount of a darbepo etin alfa pre -filled 
syringe (PFS) will be used to deliver the total 4 -weekl y dose. 
Additional information about the delivery  of the respective rhEPO doses is provided in 
the SRM. Those receiving the highest dose of rhEPO who require a dose increase will 
maintain the same dose, while those receiving the lowest dose of rhEPO that require a 
dose decrease will have doses withheld.   
For subjects who are on HD twotimes aweek and are randomized to the epoetin alfaarm 
and require three times a week epoetin al fa dosing, the weekl y dose should be split as 
close to equall y, using the study -allocated dose vials of epoetin alfa ,across the two
dialy sistreatments.

6.3.3. Daprodustat and rhEPO Dose A djustment A lgorithm
The protocol -specified randomized treatment (daprodustat or rhEPO) dose adjustment 
algorithm is provided in Appendix 6 .  Dose adjustments (i.e., increase, decrease, 
maintain, or withheld if ≥12 g/dL) will be made programmaticall y for both the 
daprodustat and rhEPO arms by  the IRT system to maintain Hgb concentrations within 
the range of 10 -11 g/dL based on the HemoCue Hgb value measured at least every  4

200807
31weeks (Day  1 through Week 52) or at least every  12 weeks (post -Week 52 through end of 
treatment) disclosed to the I RT s ystem by  the investigator.
From Week 52 onwards, additional study  visits to check Hgb and dispense randomized 
treatment (where directed by  the IRT s ystem) will be required under the circumstances 
outlined in Appendix 6 .
In order to mitigate subjects remaining below the Hgb target range for an extended period 
of time, adjustments to the algorithm may  be implemented by the sponsor as outlined in 
Appendix 6 based on the review of blinded instream aggregate Hgb data.  
6.3.4. Randomized Treatment Temporary  Interruption
Every  effort must be made to continue randomized treatment and to complete study  
visits, where able; however, sites should contact PPD R emote Site Monitor -Localif a 
subject cannot return to the research site on a temporary  basis for any  one of the 
following situations:
Subjects who are hospitalized for any  duration. 
HD or PD subjects receiving oral daprodustat or PD subjects receiving SC 
darbepoetin alfa who cannot return to the site for a period >5 weeks
HD subjects receiving IV rhEPO who cannot return to the site in time for the next 
dosing interval .
Inexceptional circumstances, local standard of care for anemia management during this 
time period may  be considered based on consultation with the PPD Medical Monitor.  If 
non-study  ESAs are administered, doses should be recorded on the Prior/Concomitant 
Medications –ESA eCRF page.    
6.3.5. Randomized Treatment Discontinuation
The sponsor will inform investigators when they  should have subjects come in for an End 
of Study  visit based on the projected occurrence of 664first MACE.   Subjects will stop 
taking randomized treatment the day  of the End of Study  visit.
For those subjects who permanentl y discontinue randomized treatment, see Section 5.5.1
for study visit details.
Anemia therap y may recommence, as required, once randomized treatment has been 
discontinued.
6.4. Blinding
This is an open -label study ; however, the sponsor is blinded to treatment assignment for 
both the main study  and ABPM sub -study .  Rand omized treatment will have the dose 
strength on the label. A detailed Blinding Plan will describe the procedures that will be 
implemented in order to minimize the extent to which this blind may  be compromised.

326.5. Packaging and Labeling
Daprodustat tablets are packed in white, opaque high densit y polyeth ylene (HDPE) 
bottles with child -resistant closures. The contents of the label will be in accordance with 
all applicable regulatory  requirements.
6.6. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountability
No special preparation of placebo run -in or randomized treatment is required.
Only  subjects enrolled in the study  may  receive placebo run -in and subsequently , 
randomized treatment and only  authorized site staff may  suppl y placebo run -in and 
randomized treatment.  All placebo ru n-in and randomized treatment must be stored in a 
secure environmentall y controlled and monitored (manual or automated) area in 
accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and 
authorized site staff. 
The investiga tor, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for placebo run -in and randomized treatment accountabilit y, reconciliation, 
and record maintenance (i.e. receipt, reconciliation and final disposition records).  
Further guidance and information for final disposition of unused placebo run -in and 
randomized treatment is provided in the SRM. 
Under normal conditions of handling and administration, placebo run -in and randomized 
treatment are not expected to pose signi ficant safety  risks to site staff .  
A Material Safety  Data Sheet (MSDS)/equivalent document describing occupational 
hazards and recommended handling precautions either will be provided to the 
investigator, where this is required b y local laws, or is avail able upon request from GSK.
6.7. Compliance with Randomized Treatment A dministration
Randomized subjects, who administer randomized treatment ( daprodustat or rhEPO 
[darbepoetin alfa or epoetin alfa] ) at home, will be instructed to return all unused 
randomized treatment at each clinic visit. A record of the number of daprodustat tablets 
or rhEPO doses dispensed to and taken b y each subject will be maintained and reconciled 
with randomized treatment an d compliance records. Randomized treatment start and stop 
dates and dosing details, including dates for randomized treatment interruptions and/or 
dose increases or reductions, will be recorded in the eCRF. At Week 2 and for 
unscheduled visits, compliance checking will not be performed if the dose of randomized 
treatment is not changed.
For subjects randomized to rhEPO ( darbepoetin alfa or epoetin alfa ) who have 
randomized treatment administered in the clinic, the details of each administered rhEPO 
dose wil l be maintained and reconciled with randomized treatment and compliance 
records. Randomized treatment start and stop dates and dosing details, including dates for 
randomized treatment interruptions and/or dose increases/reductions, will be recorded in 
the eCRF .

200807
336.8. Treatment of Randomized Treatment Overdose
There is no specific antidote for overdose with daprodustat. The expected manifestations 
of daprodustat overdosage include signs and s ymptoms associated with an excessive 
and/or rapid increase in Hgb concent ration. Daprodustat is highly  protein bound; thus, 
clearance of daprodustat by  HD or PD is very  low and these are not effective methods to 
enhance the elimination of daprodustat. Daprodustat metabolites are, in part, cleared via 
hemodialy sis. In the event of a suspected overdose, it is recommended that the 
appropriate supportive clinical care be instituted, as dictated b y the subject’s clinical 
status. Additionally , subjects should be monitored closely  for CV events, increased HR 
and hematologic abnormaliti es.
Consult the approved product label for information on overdose for darbepoetin alfa and 
epoetin alfa.
6.9. Treatment after the End of the Study
Subjects will not receive any  additional treatment from GSK after completion of the 
study . The investigator is re sponsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to 
post-study  care of the subject’s medical condition.
6.10. Concomitant Medications and Non -Drug Therapies
Concomitant medications, including over -the-counter medications and supplements, 
taken during the study  will be recorded in the eCRF.  Start/stop dates and route of 
administration will be recorded for general concomitant medications. Additional details 
(e.g., changes in dose, reason for change, reason for addition or termination) will be 
recorded for certain medications at each visit (e.g., iron and anti -hypertensive 
medications).
6.10.1. Permitted Medications and Non -Drug Therapies
Unless specified as a prohibited medication in Section 6.10.2 , all concomitant 
medications should be considered permitted provided they  are not contraindicated for the 
individual subject concerned.
Co-administration of daprodustat with moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., clopido grel, 
teriflunomide, deferasirox) should be performed with caution. If one of these 
medications is started, stopped or the dose is changed, Hgb should subsequently  be 
monitored every  4 weeks for the following 12 weeks.
6.10.2. Prohibited Medications and Non -Drug Therapies
Use of an y of the following prescription drugs from screening (Week -8) until 7 day s 
after the last dose of randomized treatment is prohibited and will constitute a protocol 
violation. 
Strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil)
Strong induc ers of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin/rifampicin)
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
34No other investigational agents or devices are permitted from study  entry  through 
completion of the study , with the exception of the randomized treatment administered for 
this study .
6.11. Standard of Care
During the stu dy (from screening), investigators are expected to monitor the subject’s 
overall clinical status to ensure standards of care are met to enable consistency  of practice 
with Kidney  Disease I mproving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines or local 
equivalent (e.g ., phosphate and albumin).
For this study , specific iron management criteria and a dose adjustment algorithm for 
randomized treatment will apply . These were developed to reflect global clinical practice.
6.11.1. Iron Management Criteria
Subjects must remain iron replete throughout the study .  The investigator will follow the 
iron management criteria from randomization (Day 1) through the end of the study  
treatment period for subjects receiving randomized treatment.  
Iron therap y will be administered if ferritin is ≤100 ng/mL and/or TSAT is ≤20%.  The 
investigator should choose the route of administration and dose of iron based on the 
subject’s iron status and local clinical practice.  
All iron (excluding multivitamins) must be stopped an d cannot be administered if; 
Ferritin >800 ng/mL and TSAT  >20%, or 
TSAT  >40% 
Investigators should be guided by  local/regional guidelines and may  stop administration 
of iron at a lower ferritin or TSAT level as long as subjects are maintained at a ferr itin 
>100 ng/mL and TSAT >20%.
The Steering Committee (Section 10.8.4 ) will monitor blinded subject iron data in an 
ongoing fashion to ensure compl iance.
6.12. Rescue Therapy
A rescue algorithm is provided to minimize subjects having an inadequate response to the 
treatment for their anemia for an extended period of time and to enable consistency  in the 
application of rescue therapy  across the study .  Details are provided in Table 6.
This rescue algorithm does not apply  to subjects with a lowHgb as a result of an acute or 
subacute event with an identifiable cause (e.g., GI b leed, blood loss due to surgery  or 
vascular access).  In these cases, treatment should be directed to the specific cause and 
randomized treatment will be continued.  If a subject is transfused as part of the 
treatment, then the randomized treatment will be maintained at the current dose (unless 
Hgb is ≥12g/dL which requires a dose hold).
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
35Table 6 Rescue A lgorithm for A nemia Management
Evaluate Subject for Rescue if:  
HemoCue Hgb remains <9 g/dL (at a scheduled study visit , Week 4 onwards ) despite three 1consecutive 
dose increases above the starting 2or post -rescue 3dose (where HemoCue Hgb is <9 g/dL prior to each 
dose increase) OR HemoCue Hgb is <7.5 g/dL despite a dose increase at the prior study visit.
Step 1:
Initial 
InterventionWhile continuing randomized treatment (increase dose if HemoCue Hgb <7.5 g/dL; 
otherwise maintain current dose), intervene with one or more of the following as dictated 
by clinical comorbidities 
- Single course of IV iron up to 1000 mg ( in addition to the iron management criteria)
- Transfusion of up to two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) if clinically 
indicated
- Allow additional 4 weeks on randomized treatment (NOTE:  this is a required 
choice; can be combined with either or both of the above).
Step 2: 
Rescue Check HemoCue Hgb 4 weeks ±1 week from last study visit; earlier checks of Hgb may 
be obtained to advise further intervention as clinically indicated.
Randomized treatment should be permanently discontinued and the subject 
should be rescued according to local clinical practice if either,
- If HemoCue Hgb remains <9 g/dL despite initial intervention based on the average 
of two HemoCue Hgb values 4
OR
- More than two units of PRBC were needed for transfusion (and was not related to 
acute bleeding).
1. Two consecutive dose increases if starting/post -rescue dose is daprodustat 12 mg, epoetin alfa 42000 U per 
week, or darbepoetin alfa 200 µg over 4 weeks; one dose increase if starting/post -rescue dose is daprodustat 16 
mg, epoetin alfa 48000 U per week, or darbepoetin alfa 300 µg over 4 weeks; and no prior dose increase if 
starting/post -rescue dose is daprodustat 24 mg, epoetin alfa 60000 U per week, or da rbepoetin alfa 400 µg over 4 
weeks (top dose) .
2. For subjects who have switched from HD to PD who are randomized to rhEPO, the baseline dose for the 
purposes of the rescue algorithm is the new darbepoetin alfa dose.
3. For subjects who previously were evaluated for rescue and who are able to continue in the trial, “post -rescue” 
dose is the dose of randomized treatment that a subject is receiving at the study visit after initial intervention.
4. Repeat HemoCue Hgb at the same study visit to confirm Hgb (using the sa me sample); take average of 2 values.
6.13. Subjects Changing Dialy sis Modality
Subjects changing dialy sis modality  should not be withdrawn from the study , and will 
continue in the same randomized treatment arm (daprodustat or rhEPO) they were 
originall y assigned . Those subjects randomized to rhEPO who transition from PD to HD 
(in-center or home HD) will continue on darbepoetin alfa.  However, subjects 
randomized to rhEPO who transition from HD to PD will switch from epoetin alfa to 
darbepoetin alfa at the ir next study  visit from Week 4 onwards.  If this occurs from Week 
52 onward, additional visits are required as outlined in Appendix 6 .

367. STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed with the exception of immediate safety  
concerns. Adherence to the study  design requirements, including those specified in the 
Time and Events Table, are essential and required for study  conduct.
This section lists the procedures and parameters of each planned study assessment.  The 
exact timing of each assessment is listed in the Time and Events Table Section 7.1. 
Because Hgb levels become more variable with increased time between dialy sis sessions, 
the designated stud y visit should occur during the dialy sis session with the shortest 
interval from the previous session. Study  visit days should be scheduled as follows: 
For subjects on 3 -5x/week HD, the designated study  visit must not occur on the 
first dialy sis session of the week , i.e., immediately following the longest interval 
between HD sessions .  For example, if on a Monday -Wednesday -Friday schedule, 
the study  visit should be on Wednesday  or Friday .
For subjects on PD, study  visits can occur on any  day of the week. 
For subjects on 2x/week HD, the study  visit must occur on the day  of the dialy sis 
session that is closest to the previous sessi on. For example, if a subject receives 
dialy sis on a Monday  and Thursday , the study  visit should be on the Thursday  (2 
days from the previous dialy sis session) rather than the Monday  (3 day s from the 
previous dialy sis session). 
The Week -4 and Day  1 visits should be completed 4 weeks ±1 week after the last visit; 
however, the total duration of the Screening and Run -In periods (from Week -8 to Day  1) 
should be 8 weeks ±1 week (i.e., 7 -9 weeks) .  
Post-randomization visits should be referenced back to t he Randomization visit (Day  1).  
The visit window for those on randomized treatment for the Week 2 and Week 4 visits is 
±3 day s.  The visit window specified for those on randomized treatment from Week 8 
onwards is ±1 week.  However, during the first 52 wee ks, to ensure continuity  of 
randomized treatment, study  visits must be no more than 5 weeks apart. In exceptional 
circumstances, minor changes to visit structure may be permitted after consultation with 
the PPD Medical Monitor.
Study  assessments should pre ferabl y be done at dialy sis centers; however, in some

467.2. Screening and Critical Baseline A ssessments
Before an y stud y-specific procedure is performed, valid informed consent must be 
obtained at screening.
Demograph y and medical history  (including CV medical history /risk factors) will be 
assessed at screening (Week -8).
Randomization requires a Hgb on Day  1 in the range as defined by  ESA use and region 
(Section 4.1). 
Full details of screening (Week -8) and baseline (Day  1) assessments are provided in the 
Time and Events Table Section 7.1.
7.3. Efficacy
Planned time points for all Hgb efficacy  assessments are listed in the Time and Events 
Table (Section 7.1).  
GSK will supply  a point -of-care Hgb anal yzer (i.e., HemoCue) to each site for rapid 
measurement of Hgb. 
Blood samples for measurement of Hgb via HemoCue and also by  the central laboratory  
will be collected as specified in Time and Events Table (Section 7.1).
7.4. Safet y
Planned time points for all study  safet y assessments are listed in the Time and Events 
Tables (Section 7.1). Unscheduled visits will occur as medicall y necessary . Detailed 
procedures for obtaining each assessment are provided in the SRM.
Safety  endpoints will include monitoring of safet y endpoint events including deaths 
(Section 7.4.1 ), other CV events (Section 7.4.2 ), AEs of special interest (Section 7.4.4 ), 
AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of randomized treatment, laboratory  
parameters, BP and HR.  
Pre-specified events leading to permanent discontinuati on of randomized treatment are 
described in Section 5.5. Liver chemistry  stopping and follow -up criteria are described in 
Section 7.4.12 and Appendix 8.
7.4.1. Events Referred to the Clinical Events Committee
Investigators should refer any  event suspected to be one ofthe events below to the 
Clinical Events Committee for adjudication .  See CEC Site Man ual for full scope of 
reporting requirements.  
All-cause mortalit y (CV and non -CV mortality )
Non-fatal MI
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
47Non-fatal stroke
Hospitalization for HF
Thromboembolic events (vascular access thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, 
pulmonary  embolism)
When the invest igator -reported event and the Clinical Events Classification (CEC) 
assessment by  the committee differ, the committee’s decision will be considered final. 
The detailed descriptions of the endpoint definitions used for adjudication are contained 
within the C linical Events Committee Charter (available on request). 
Source documentation required to support the adjudication of the events is described in 
the CEC Site Manual .  Recording of potential endpoint events in the eCRF and 
submission of source documentatio n will be required.
Positively  adjudicated events will be reported separatel y (Section 7.4.3 ). Negativel y 
adjudicated events will be reported as AEs or SAEs using the investigator -reported event 
term.
7.4.2. Other CV Events
GSK has identified other CV events of interest for all clinical studies. I nvestigators will 
be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the eCRF for the following CV AEs 
and SAEs or an y event that may potentially be one of the categories listed:
Arrh ythmias  
Pulmonary  hypertension (also an AE of special interest see Section 7.4.4 for further 
details).
Valvulopathy
Revascularization 
7.4.3. Adverse Events (A E) and Serious A dverse Events (S AEs)
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 7.
The investigator or their designees are responsible for detecting, documenting and 
reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. 
For this study , events referred to the Clinical Eve nts Committee (Section 7.4.1 ) will be 
subjected to blinded adjudication using pre -specified diagnostic criteria. Positively  
adjudicated events will be reported separatel y. Negativel y adjudicated events will be 
reported as AEs or SAEs using the investigator -reported event term.
Events should be reported as an AE or SAE according to the definitions in Appendix 7. 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
487.4.3.1. Time period and Frequency  for collecting A E and SA E information
Any SAEs assessed as related to study  participation (e.g., protocol -mandated 
procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a GSK product 
will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF from the time a subject consents to participate 
in the study  up to and including an y follow -up contact. 
AEs and SAEs will be collected from the start of placebo run -in until the Follow -up 
visit (or the “End of Study” visit for subjects that discontinue study  treatment earl y) 
(Section 7.4.3.2 ), at the time points specified in the Time and Events Table (Section 
7.1).
Medical occurrences that begin prior to the start of placebo run -in but after obtaining 
informed consent may be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical 
Conditions Section of the eCRF.
All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF and reported to PPD within 24 hours, as 
indicated in Appendix 7.
Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study 
subjects. However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, including a death, at an y 
time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he /she considers the 
event reasonabl y related to the randomized treatment or study participation, the 
investigator must promptly  notify  PPD.
NOTE: The method of recording, evaluating and assessing causality  of AEs and SAEs 
plus procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports to PPD are provided in 
Appendix 7.
7.4.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SA Es
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/o r SAEs. Open -ended 
and non -leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrence.  Appropriate questions include:
“How are you feeling?” 
“Have you had an y (other) medical problems since y our last visit/contact?” 
“Have you taken an y new medicines, other than those provided in this study , since 
your last visit/contact?” 
7.4.3.3. Follo w-up of A Es and SA Es
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
subject at subsequent visits/co ntacts.  All endpoint events (as defined in Section 7.4.1 ), 
SAEs, and non -serious AEs of special interest (as defined in Section 7.4.4 ) will be 
followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise 
explained, or until the subject is lost to follow -up (as defin ed in Section 5.5). Further 
information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 7.
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
497.4.3.4. Regulatory  Reporting Requirements for SA Es
Prompt notification by  the investigator to PPD of SAEs related to placebo or randomized 
treatment is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards t he 
safet y of subjects and the safet y of a product under clinical investigation are met. 
GSK has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  authorit y and other 
regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a product under clinical investigation. GSK will 
comply  with country  specific regulatory  requirements relating to safet y reporting to the 
regulatory  authorit y, Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) and investigators.
Investigator safety  reports are prepared for sus pected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions according to local regulatory  requirements and GSK policy  and are forwarded 
to investigators as necessary .
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE(s) or other 
specific safet y information (e.g., summary  or listing of SAEs) from GSK will file it with 
the IB and will notify  the I RB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
7.4.4. Adverse Events of Special Interest
The investigator or site staff will be responsible for detectin g, documenting and reporting 
any events that may  represent the AEs of special interest listed below (using preferred 
terms):
Thrombosis and/or tissue ischemia secondary  to excessive ery thropoiesis
Worsening of h ypertension
Cardiomy opath y  
Pulmonary  artery  hypertension (see also Section 7.4.2 )
Cancer -related mortality  and tumor progression and recurrence 
Esophageal and gastric erosio ns
Proliferative retinopathy , macular edema, choroidal neovascularization 
Exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis
The results of an y investigation should be recorded on theAE page and the relevant AE 
of special interest page of the subject’s eCRF.
7.4.5. Possible Suicidality  Related A dverse Events
If during the stud y there is an occurrence of an AE or SAE which in the investigator’s 
opinion, is possibly  related to suicidality , the Possible Suicidality  Related Adverse Events 
(PSRAE) eCRF form should be completed (in addition to the AE and SAE pages, as 
appropriate).
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
50This event may  include, but is not limited to, one that involves suicidal ideation, a 
preparatory  act toward imminent suicidal behavior, a suicide attempt, or a completed 
suicide. The investigator will ex ercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in 
deciding whether an event is possibly  related to suicidality .
7.4.6. Pregnancy
Details of all pregnancies in female subjects will be collected from the start of dosing and 
until seven day s after the last dose.
If a pregnancy  is reported then the investigator should inform PPD within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy  and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 10 .
7.4.7. Height and Weight
Height and weight will be measured as specified in the Time and Events Table (Section 
7.1). Weight will be measured w ith the subject wearing indoor day time clothing with no 
shoes. For in -center HD subjects, weight will be measured pre and post -dialy sis. For 
HHD subjects, weight will be done at study  visits between dial ysis sessions.  For PD 
subjects, this assessment will be done at study  visits, as per standard of care.
EDW will be reported at each stud y visit as specified in the Time and Events Table 
(Section 7.1).
7.4.8. Blood Pressure and Heart Rate
Measurement of s ystolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and HR 
will be taken at the time points specified in the Time and Events Table Section 7.1.
One measurement each of SBP, DBP and HR will be taken, except at Day  1, 
Week 52, End of Study  visit, and at the Earl y Treatment Discontinuation visit (if 
applicable), when SBP, DBP and HR will be measured in triplicate. 
Measurements will be taken with the subject in a semi -supine or seated position in 
the dialy sis chair after at least a 5 -minute rest period (pre -and post -dialysis).
For in -center HD subjects, SBP, DBP and HR will be measured pre and post-dialy sis. For 
HHD subjects ,these assessments will be done at study  visits between dialysis sessions .  
For PD subjects, this assessment will be done at study  visits, as per standard of care .
SBP, DBP, and HR will be performed before collection of bloo d samples for laboratory  
testing, where applicable (e.g., would not appl y for post -HD measurement).
7.4.9. Electrocardiogram (ECG)
ECG measurements will be taken at the time points specified in the Time and Events 
Table (Section 7.1). Full 12 -lead ECGs will be recorded with the subject in a supine 
position. HR, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT (uncorrected) interval will b e measured. 
QTcB will be calculated (machine -read or manually ).
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
51For the Day  1 ECG, two additional ECGs are required if the initial ECG indicates 
prolonged QTc (see Section 5.2) using the automated or manuall y calculated QTcB 
value.  The average QTcB value of all three ECGs will be used to determine eligibility  
(see Section 5.2). Additional details are provided in the SRM.
ECG data will be read locally by a physician with experience in reading and interpreting 
ECGs.  The over -read of the Day  1 ECG isrequired to confirm eligibility .Additional 
details are provided in the SRM.
All ECGs will be performed before measurement of SBP, DBP, and HR and before 
collection of blood samples for laboratory  testing, where applicable (e.g., would not 
apply  if ECG is performed post -HD).
7.4.10. Ultrasound
An ultrasound of the kidney s and adrenal glands will be performed prior to 
randomization (Day  1). It is understood that the adrenal glands will not alway s be able to 
be visualized. Non -visualization of the adrenals is not a reason to exclude from 
randomizat ion. Further details are provided in the SRM.
A documented ultrasound of the kidney s within the 6 months prior to screening may  be 
used to assess entry  criteria (see Section 5.2), provided the size and cy st category  has 
been reported. If a more sensitive imaging study  (e.g., MRI, CT) has been performed 
within this timeframe and a report is available, this may  be used in place of the 
ultrasound.
7.4.11. Clini cal Laboratory  Assessments
All protocol required laboratory  assessments, as defined in Table 10, must be conducted 
in accordance with the Laboratory  Manual, and Protocol Time and Events Schedule 
(Section 7.1).Laboratory assessments will be done pre -dialy sis for in -center HD 
subjects, in between dialysis sessions for HHD subjects at the study  visits, and at the 
study  visits for PD subjects , as per standard of care .
Laboratory  requ isition forms must be completed and samples must be clearly  labeled 
with the subject number, protocol number, site/ center number, and visit date. Details for 
the preparation and shipment of samples will be provided b y the laboratory and are 
detailed in th e SRM. Reference ranges for all safety  parameters will be provided to the 
site by  the laboratory  responsible for the assessments.
If additional non -protocol specified laboratory  assessments are performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory  and result in a change in subject management or are 
considered clinically  significant by  the investigator (e.g., SAE or AE or dose 
modification) the results must be recorded in the source notes.
Refer to the SRM for appropriate processing and handling of samples.

Refer to Appendix 9 for full guidance. 
7.5. Genetics
Information regarding genetic research is included in Appendix 11 .
Samples for genetic analy sis will be taken at the time points specified in the Time and 
Events Table (Section 7.1).
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
557.6. Storage Biomarkers
Blood (serum and plasma) samples will be collected as outlined in the Time and Events 
Table (Section 7.1) for potential future anal ysis of biomarkers of CV risk and iron 
metabolism.
7.7. Patient Reported Outcomes
The patient -reported effect of daprodustat and rhEPO on sy mptom, health -related quality  
of life (HR -QoL), and health status (e.g. utility ) will be assessed.  Sy mptom severity  will 
be assessed using the Patient Global I mpression of Severit y (PGI -S) and overall s ymptom 
change using the patient global impression of change (PGI -C). Quality  of life will be 
measured via SF -36 and health status via the EQ -5D-5L and EQ -5D-VAS.  In addition, 
healthcare resource utilization will be assessed including outpatient visits.
All questionnaires used in this study  have been translated, and culturall y adapted for use 
in local country  languages and will be administered electronically . Specific instructions 
on how the subject is to complete the scales and the process for data entry  is provided in 
the SRM.   If there are exceptional circumstances whereb y the electronic PRO 
assessments cannot be conducted, the completion of these assessments will be discussed 
with the sponsor on a case -by-case basis.
The severit y, HR -QoL and Health Status questionnaires shoul d be completed by  subjects 
at a clinic visit, in the order specified: PGI -S, PGI -C, SF -36 then EQ -5D-5L and EQ -
VAS. Subjects who are unable to or require assistance to read must not complete the 
questionnaires.
7.7.1. Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI -S)and Patient Global 
Impression of Change (PGI -C)
The PGI -S is a 1 -item questionnaire designed to assess subject’s impression of disease 
severit y of their anemia of CKD.  It is measured on a 5 -point disease severity  scale 
(absent, mild, moderate, severe, or very severe) during the past 24 hours.
The PGI -C is a 1 -item questionnaire designed to assess a subject’s impression of 
symptoms change of their anemia of CKD.  It is measured on a 7 -point Likert -type 
response scale (very  much improved, moderatel y improve d, minimally  improved, no 
change, minimally  worse, moderatel y worse, or very much worse) since they first started 
the study . 
7.7.2. Health Related Quality of Life (SF -36)
The SF -36 acute version is a general health status questionnaire designed to elucidate the 
subject’s self perception of their health on several domains, including ph ysical 
functioning, role ph ysical, bodily  pain, vitality , social functioning, role emotional, mental 
health, and general health over the past seven days.  The questionnaire contains 36 
questions that ask the subject to recall how they  felt during the past seven day s.
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
567.7.3. Health Status (EQ -5D-5L & EQ -VAS)
The EQ -5D-5L consists of 2 concepts –the EQ -5D-5L descriptive sy stem and the EQ 
Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS). The EQ -5D-5L is a self -reported descriptive sy stem 
of health -related qualit y of life states consisting of five dimensions (mobility , self -care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety /depression) each of which can take one of five 
responses. The responses record five levels o f severity  (no problems/slight 
problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a particular EQ -
5D dimension. Self -reported health status captured by  EQ-5D-5L relates to the subject’s 
situation at the time of completion. 
The EQ VAS reco rds the respondent’s self -rated health on a vertical, visual analogue 
scale where the endpoints are labeled ‘ the best health y ou can imagine ’ and ‘ the worst 
health y ou can imagine ’. This information is used as a quantitative measure of health 
outcome as ju dged b y individual subjects.
The EQ -5D-5L and EQ VAS will only  be completed by  subjects in selected countries 
which require this data as part of their reimbursement assessment process as noted in 
Appendix 3 .

9. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS AND DA TA 
ANALYSES
The study  has two co -primary  objectives and endpoints:
Objectives Endpoints
Co-primary (tested in parallel for non-inferiority)
To compare daprodustat to rhEPO for CV 
safety (non -inferiority)Time to first occurrence of adjudicated MACE 
(composite of all -cause mortality, non -fatal 
myocardial infarction (MI) and non -fatal stroke)
To compare daprodustat to rhEPO for Hgb 
efficacy(non -inferiority)Mean change in Hgb between baseline and EP 
(mean over Weeks 28 to 52)
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
57The co -primary  endpoints will each be tested using a one-sided 2. 5% significance level 
and the relevant confidence bound of the two-sided 95% CI (upper bound for MACE and 
lower bound for the Hgb co -primary  endpoint) . The ty pe I error rate will be strictly  
controlled at the one-sided 2.5% level across the co -primary  analy ses as both non -
inferiority  tests need to be met for the tria l to be considered successful and for statistical 
analysis to proceed to evaluate MACE superiorit y and superiorit y for the principal 
secondary  objectives/endpoints. 
9.1. Hypotheses
9.1.1. CV Safety  (MA CE) Co -Primary  Hypothesis
The co -primary  CV safety  objective will assess the estimand of time to first occurrence 
(in day s) of adjudicated MACE from randomization to the end of study  in all randomized 
subjects regardless of what treatment(s) they  go on to receive. The primary anal ysis will 
test for non -inferiority  of tre atment with daprodustat relative to rhEPO, expressed b y the 
following statistical h ypotheses: 
Null: daprodustat is inferior to rhEPO, with at least a 2 5% increased relative risk 
of first MACE (i.e. the hazard ratio is 1.25)
Alternative: daprodustat is non -inferior to rhEPO (i.e. the hazard ratio is <1.2 5)
The non -inferiority  margin is pre -defined as the hazard ratio of 1.2 5; supported by  a 
review of evidence reported in historical randomized trials of rhEPO in dialy sis and ND 
CKD subject s and after consideration of the largest point estimate that, by  design, would 
meet the statistical criterion for non -inferiority . 
Statistical significance of non -inferiorit y will be assessed at the one-sided 2.5% level. A 
Cox-Proportional Hazards -Regress ion model, adjusting for treatment and prognostic 
randomization stratification factors (dialy sis type and region), will be used to estimate the 
hazard -ratio, its two-sided 95% CI  and to generate the p -value for the non -inferiorit y test. 
Non-inferiorit y wil l be achieved if the upper limit of the two -sided 95% CI is below the 
margin of 1.2 5.  
9.1.2. Hgb efficacy  Co-Primary  Hypothesis
The co -primary  Hgb efficacy  objective will assess the estimand defined as the effect of 
daprodustat treatment relative to rhEPO on th e change in Hgb from baseline to the 
average of all values in the EP, regardless of adherence to treatment including 
interruptions and discontinuations, the use of non -randomized ESA medication for an y 
reason including rescue therap y, or the use of blood t ransfusions, in subjects on dialy sis 
currentl y treated with an ESA with anemia secondary to CKD and assuming subjects do 
not die before the end of the EP. The anal ysis will test whether daprodustat is non -
inferior to rhEPO according to the following statis tical hy potheses: 
Null: The difference in mean change in Hgb between baseline and EP, between 
treatment arms (daprodustat -rhEPO), is less than or equal to -0.75 g/dL.
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
58Alternative: The difference in mean change in Hgb between baseline and EP, 
between trea tment arms (daprodustat -rhEPO), is greater than -0.75 g/dL 
The non -inferiority  margin is pre -defined as -0.75 g/dL; determined based upon a 
combination of clinical judgment, statistical reasoning and regulatory  guidance for 
designing non -inferiorit y trials. 
Statistical significance of non -inferiorit y will be assessed at the one-sided 2.5% level. An 
ANCOVA model including prognostic randomization stratification factors (dialy sis ty pe 
and region), baseline Hgb and treatment will be used to obtain a point estimate and the
two-sided 95% CI for the treatment difference (daprodustat -rhEPO) and generate the p -
value for the non -inferiority  test. The non -inferiority  p-value will show strength of 
evidence against the null hy pothesis. Non -inferiority  will be established if the lower limit 
of the two -sided 95% CI for the treatment difference is greater than -0.75 g/dL .
The co -primary  endpoints will be tested first. Non -inferiorit y needs to be established for 
both co -primary ’s to proceed to evaluate MACE for su periorit y as well as the principal 
secondary  endpoints for superiority . Principal secondary  endpoints include prioritized 
composites for MACE (including thromboembolic events and hospitalizations for HF) 
and IV iron utilization (defined as the average mont hly IV iron dose used to Week 52). 
Statistical testing of MACE for superiorit y as well as the principal secondary endpoints 
will be adjusted for multiplicity  (Section 9.4.3 ).
9.2. Sample Size Considerations
9.2.1. Sample Size A ssumptions
The size of this event driven trial is based on the co -primary  CV safet y objective and is 
determined b y a fixed event target of 664 adjudicated first MACE. This provides 
approxim ately  90% power to establish non -inferiority  assuming a true underly ing 3% 
lower relative risk of MACE in favor of daprodustat compared to rhEPO (i.e., hazard 
ratio=0.97) and 82% power for non -inferiorit y under the assumption that the true 
underly ing risk of MACE is the same in both arms (i.e., hazard ratio=1.00). Other 
assumptions behind the sample size calculation include:
Projected annual adjudicated first MACE rate of 1 1%. All -cause death is expected 
to be the most prevalent component, followed b y non-fatal MI and then non -fatal 
stroke (projected break down of 60%, 30% and 10% respectively ). 
Variance under the alternative hy pothesis (i.e. hazard ratio=0.97) 
1% annual lost to follow -up without vital status
A two -sided 95% CI is used for analy sis
The tar get of 664 adjudicated first MACE will permit a two-sided 95% CI  of (0. 859, 
1.164) to describe the results for an observed hazard ratio of 1. The largest hazard ratio 
point estimate ( two-sided 95% CI) that would meet the statistical criterion for non -
infer iority  is 1. 074(0.922, 1.250) and for superiority , the minimum observable effect 
would be a 1 4.1% relative risk reduction in favor of daprodustat, corresponding to a 
hazard ratio of 0. 859. 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
59Conditional on both co -primary  endpoints achieving non -inferiorit y at the one-sided 
2.5% level, statistical testing will progress to evaluate MACE and the principal secondary  
endpoints for superiorit y. These tests will be multiplicity  adjusted, details are provided in 
Section 9.4.3 . 
Based on an annual MACE rate of 11%, i t is anticipated that the 664 adjudicated first 
MACE target will be reached appro ximately 3.3 years from when the first subject is 
randomized. All subjects will have the opportunity for a minimum of 1 y ear exposure to 
treatment and thus the opportunity  to complete the EP (Weeks 28 to 52). Exposure to 
daprodustat is expected to be in t he region of 3,500 patient y ears with median patient 
follow -up expected to exceed 2 years.
Note: The country -specific requirements for France ONLY for the sample size 
consideration are provided in Appendix 14 (see Section 12.14.1 , Item 2 for details).
9.2.2. Sample Size Sensitivity
The estimated 11% a nnual MACE rate is based on a blinded summary  of ASCEND -D 
data as of April 20, 2020. Table 11illustrates the impact on power if the true underl ying 
treatment effect is not a hazard ratio of 0.97.

Impact of Sample Size for Hgb Efficacy Analysis
Subjects will be treated to achieve and maintain a Hgb between 10 and 11 g/dL. The 
expected difference in mean Hgb change from baseline between arms and the EP is 
0g/dL and the anticipated standard deviation (SD) is 1.5 g/dL, based on historical rhEPO 
trials and daprodustat clinical trial experience to date. 
For 90% power to test the co -primary  non-inferiority  Hgb h ypothesis, with a two -sided 
95% CI , pre-specified margin of -0.75 g/dL and a two -sample T -test, a total of 86 
evaluable subjects per treatment group are required. The planned stud y size far exceeds 
this requirement and provides more than 99% power for non -inferiority  and a high level 
of precision to estimate the treatment effect ( two-sided 95% CI  half width of 0.128 g/dL, 
assuming 30% of subjects will be non -evaluable for efficacy ). The largest (most 
negative) difference between arms that would meet the statistical criterion for non -
inferiority  would be -0.622 g/dL. If the two-sided 95% CI  is completely  negative (i.e. lies 
fully  within the range -0.75 to <0g/dL) non -inferiority  would still be concluded.

609.2.3. Sample Size Re -estimation or A djustment
At the time of this protocol amendment, the study  was fully  enrolled, and as such no 
sample size re -estimation was performed .  
9.3. Data Analysis Considerations
9.3.1. Analysis Populations
The primary  population for anal yses of MACE and other time to event outcomes will be 
the All Randomized (I TT) Population. Subjects will be anal yzed according to the 
treatment to which they  were randomized.
The primary  population for the Hgb efficacy  anal yses will also be the ITT Population.  A 
supportive analysis of the primary  efficacy  endpoint will be performed in a Per -Protocol 
(PP) Population defined as all ITT subjects who ar e not major protocol violators. Details 
will be defined in the RAP and subjects anal yzed according to the treatment received.
The primary  population for safet y will be based on all randomized subjects who receive 
at least one dose of randomized treatment. Subjects will be analy zed according to the 
treatment received.
Additional populations may  be defined in the RAP, including sub -study  populations.
9.4. Key Elements of A nalysis Plan
9.4.1. Primary  Analyses
9.4.1.1. Primary  CV Safety  Analysis (co -primary)
MACE: The co -primary  cardiovascular safet y analy sis is to assess the comparative 
treatment effect for time to first occurrence of adjudicated MACE in all randomized 
subjects. Time to the first occurrence of a primary  endpoint event will be computed as 
(event date –randomization date) +1. Subjects who do not have the event during the trial 
period will be censored in the anal ysis, with details provided in the RAP. The statistical 
model is a Cox Proportional Hazards regression model, adjusting for treatment and the 
prognostic rando mization stratification factors (dialy sis type and region), to estimate the 
hazard ratio, two-sided 95% CI  and one-sided p-value for the statistical non -inferiorit y 
test. Non -inferiorit y will be established if the upper limit of the two -sided 95% CI  is les s 
than the margin of 1.2 5. Cumulative time from randomization to first event or end of trial 
will be evaluated using Kaplan -Meier methodology  and display ed graphically . Treatment 
comparisons from the Cox regression model will be presented as hazard ratios and two-
sided 95% CI s and display ed on forest plots. The validity  of the proportional hazards 
assumption will be assessed. All adjudicated events will be used for the primary  anal ysis 
and concordance between investigator reported and adjudicated events wil l be 
summarized.  
Sensitivity and Supportive Analyses: A sensitivity  analy sis will be performed to 
address potential effects of drop outs and to evaluate the robustness of the co -primary  
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
61MACE anal ysis. A sensitivity “tipping point” analy sis utilizing multiple imputation for 
randomized subjects who have withdrawn from the study will be performed , as well as a
supportive “on-drug” analy sis to evaluate the comparative treatment effect during the 
time that subjects remai n on randomized treatment (plus a window of 28 day s). Full 
details will be provided in the RAP.
In addition, anal yses will be performed for each component of MACE (all -cause
mortality , MI and stroke) to understand individual contributions to the overall MA CE 
result and to assess component directional consistency . These anal yses will not be 
multiplicity  adjusted. Further subgroup and covariate adjusted analy ses of specific 
clinical interest are detailed in Section 9.4.4 and the RAP.
9.4.1.2. Primary  Efficacy  Analysis (co -primary)
Mean change in Hgb between baseline and the EP (Weeks 28 to 52): The primary  
efficacy  estimand is the effect of daprodustat relative to rhEPO on the change in Hgb 
from baseline to the average of all values in the EP, regardless of adherence to treatment 
including interruptions and discontinuation, the use of non -randomized ESA medication 
for an y reason including rescue therap y, or the u se of blood transfusions, in subjects on 
dialy sis currentl y treated with an ESA with anemia secondary to CKD and assuming 
subjects do not die before the end of the EP. The anal ysis will use an ANCOVA model. 
For each subject, baseline Hgb will be the value obtained on Day  1, prior to taking 
randomized treatment, and Hgb during EP will be determined b y calculating the mean of 
all available and imputed Hgb values between Weeks 28 to 52 inclusive regardless of 
adherence to randomized treatment. The ANCOVA model will include prognostic 
randomization stratification factors (dialy sis type and region), baseline hemoglobin and 
treatment. It will provide a point estimate and two-sided 95% CI for the treatment effect 
together with the one-sided non-inferiority  test p -value. Non -inferiorit y will be 
established if the lower limit of the two -sided 95% CI  is greater than the margin of -0.75 
g/dL . Imputation will be used for missing Hgb data; further details will be provided in the 
RAP .
Sensitivity and Supportive Analyses: Sensitivity  anal yses for the primary  estimand will 
include a multiple imputation -based “tipping point” anal ysis where assumptions are 
adjusted until non -inferiority  is lost by  imputing data for subjects who did not fully  
complete the EP. A supportive analysis will evaluate efficacy  in those subjects who 
adhere to randomized treatment, defined as ITT subjects with at least one on -treatment 
Hgb during the EP (this approach corresponds to evaluating an efficacy  estimand). A 
supportive “tipping point” anal ysis as that described above for the primary  anal ysis will 
be performed for this “on -drug” anal ysis. In addition, a per -protocol supportive analysis 
will estimate the treatment effect in subjects who strongl y adhere to the protocol, and 
supportive analyses to ex plore a shorter EP (Weeks 28 to 36) will be performed for the 
co-primary  effectiveness estimand and “on -drug” efficacy  estimand. Full details of all 
sensitivity  and supportive analyses will be provided in the RAP.

629.4.2. Secondary  Analyses
9.4.2.1. Principal Secondary  Analyses
Conditional on the co -primary  endpoints achieving at least non -inferiority  at the one-
sided 2.5% level, statistical testing will progress to superiority  for MACE and the 
principal secondary  endpoints.  The hy potheses to be tested for these endpoints are as 
follows: 
Null: daprodustat is not superior torhEPO (i.e. the hazard ratio is greater than or 
equal to 1.0 for time -to-event endpoints, or the mean difference is greater than or 
equal to 0 for continuous endpoints)
Alternative: daprodustat is superior to rhEPO (i.e. the hazard ratio is less than 1.0 
for time -to-event endpoints, or the mean difference is less than to 0 for continuous 
endpoints)
These tests will be multiplicity  adjusted based on a family -wise Ty pe I error rate set at 
the one-sided 2.5% level, see Section 9.4.3 for further details. 
For “time to event” endpoints: The statistical modeling approach described for MACE 
in Sectio n 9.4.1.1 will be repeated for the adjudicated composite endpoints of:
MACE or a thromboembolic event (vascular access thrombosis, sy mptomatic deep
vein thrombosis or sy mptomatic pulmonary  embolism).
MACE or hospitalization for HF.
For the average monthly IV iron dose up to Week 52 endpoint: IV iron use for all 
subjects will be recorded in the eCRF and the average monthly  IV iron dose up to week 
52 will be calculated. An ANCOVA model will be used to compare the difference in this 
average monthly  IV iron dose per subject between arms, including factors for baseline 
dose, treatment and the prognostic randomization stratification factors.
Additional sec ondary  endpoints are listed in Appendix 2. All analy ses of secondary  
endpoints are of exploratory  nature, summary  statistics and nominal one-sided p-values
will be used for an y treatment comparisons.
9.4.2.2. Analysis Patient Reported Outcomes
Analy sis to compare the subject reported effects of daprodustat and rhEPO on sy mptoms, 
health related quality  of life, and health status, as discussed in Section 7.7, will be 
described in the RAP.
9.4.2.3. Safety  Analyses
Safety  data, including all AEs (i.e., non -serious, serious and AEs of special interest), 
laboratory  data, SBP, DBP , HR, concomitant medications and meeting protocol defined 
safet y stopping criteria (e.g., liver chemistry) will be descriptivel y summarized by  
treatment group. Reasons for stopping randomized treatment and for earl y study 
withdrawal will also be descripti vely summarized by treatment group and time to 
stopping treatment or study  will be presented graphically  and assessed. Full details of all 
safet y data reporting are described in the RAP.
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L

639.4.3. Multiplicity  Strategy
The multiplicity  strategy  for this trial will u se a combination of a gatekeeper approach on 
the co -primary  endpoints, followed by  a closed -test multiplicity  procedure wrapped 
around the family  of superiority  hypotheses consisting of MACE and the principal 
secondary  endpoints. 
Figure 2illustrates the structure of the statistical testing plan. First, the co -primary  
endpoints will be evaluated for non -inferiorit y by comparing each two -sided 95% CI  to 
the appropriate non -inferiority  margin. Conditional on both co -primary  endpoints 
achieving non -inferiorit y (i.e., passing the gatekeeper), the family of MACE and the 
principal secondary  endpoints will be formally  tested for superiority  using the widel y 
known Holm -Bonferroni proce dure [ Holm , 1979 ]. The procedure will be conducted 
based on a family -wise Ty pe I error rate set at the one-sided 2.5% level. Details of the 
Holm -Bonferroni proce dure will be full y described in the RAP.
Section 9.4.5 describes the planned interim analysis for the assessment of MACE futility . 
While this analy sis will have a small impact on reducing the study -wise Type I error rate, 
there are no plans to adjust the alpha level used for end -of-study  anal yses. There are n o 
prospectivel y defined plans to stop this study  early for benefit.
Figure 2 Multiplicity  controlled statistical testing plan
9.4.4. Covariates and Subgroups of Interest
The co -primary  and principal secondary  endpoints will be evaluated for a set of pre -
specified subgroups to support the proposed indication. For the co -primary  efficacy  
endpoint, these subgroups will be evaluated for both the primary  ITT anal ysis of Hgb 
values during the EP regardless of adherence to treatment, as well as the sensitivity  
analysis limited to on -treatment Hgb values during the EP.
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
64Although subgroup anal yses aim to assess for consistency with the overall results, they 
may have low power, especiall y if the subgroup is small or has a low number of events. 
Statistical models will be adjusted for the covariates used in the original analy sis, 
subgroup, treatment and treatment b y subgroup interaction. Point estimates and two-sided 
95% CI s will be estimated (presented on Forest Plots) and the subgroup by  treatment 
interaction p -value calculated. Subgroup anal yses will not be adjusted for multiplicity . 
Further subgroups/covariates may  be defined in the RAP.

rhEPO hyporesponder subgroup definition:   rhEPO hy poresponders will be identified 
either b y the ESA Resistance Index (ERI) [HERO study, Johnson , 2015] or by  treatment 
at baseline with a very  high dose of IV epoetin alpha.  For each subject, baseline ERI  will 
be calculated as the dry weight adjusted weekl ymean ESA dose during the 8 week 
screening period divided by  baseline Hgb concentration. Subjects with baseline ERI  
≥2U/kg/wk/g/L for epoetin -treated subjects; ≥0.008 g/kg/wk/g/L for darbepoetin -
treated subjects and ≥0.01 g/kg/wk/g/L for methoxy -PEG -epoetin -treated subjects will 
be included in the pre -specified subgroup. In addition, subjects will be included if being 
treated at baseline with gr eater than or equal to the equivalent of 450 U/kg/week of IV 
epoetin alpha. This latter criterion covers subjects at higher bod y weight for which the 
ERI calculation is less accurate and is based on the NICE anemia guidelines of June 2015 
[NICE, 2015]. Sensitivity  analy ses will explore alternative subgroup definitions: an ERI  
cut-point of ≥1.5 (or equivalent depending on ESA treatment) or using baseline prior 
rhEPO dose above the top 20thpercentile for the study  population.
rhEPO hyporesponder subgroup analysis plan:   It is anticipated that approximately  
10-15% of subjects may  be classified as rhEPO hy poresponders according to this 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
65definition, thus resulting i n a subgroup size of potentially  300-450 subjects. The subgroup 
efficacy  anal ysis will follow the same structure as that defined for the full study , 
assessing the comparative treatment effect in mean Hgb change between baseline and EP 
in subjects regardles s of adherence to study  treatment as well as in subjects who adhere to 
randomized treatment and using the same non -inferiority  margin of -0.75 g/dL . For at 
least 90% power to demonstrate non -inferiority , 86 evaluable rhEPO hy poresponders are 
required per a rm.  The statistical model (ANCOVA) will include terms for prognostic 
randomization stratification factors, baseline Hgb, treatment, h yporesponder subgroup 
and treatment b y subgroup interaction. Point estimates and two-sided 95% CI s will be 
generated to de scribe the treatment effect separately  for rhEPO hy poresponders and the 
complement set of rhEPO non -hyporesponders; non -inferiorit y would be established if 
the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI is greater than -0.75 g/dL .In addition, a nominal 
one-sided non-inferiorit y p-value and a nominal one -sided superiority  p-value for the 
difference between the two groups will be generated. 
While it is unlikely ,given the sample size, that a sufficient number of adjudicated first 
MACE will occur to support a robu st model -based anal ysis, subgroup analy ses are 
planned for the co -primary  MACE and principal secondary  CV endpoints. The statistical 
analysis model (Cox Proportional Hazards) will include terms for prognostic 
randomization stratification factors, treatment , hyporesponder subgroup and treatment by  
subgroup interaction. Point estimates and two-sided 95% CI s for the hazard ratio will be 
generated to describe the treatment effect separately  for rhEPO hy poresponders and the 
complement set of rhEPO non -hyporespon ders; non -inferiorit y would be established if 
the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI is less than 1.2 5.  At a minimum, the incidence 
of MACE, its components and the principal secondary  CV endpoints will be descriptivel y 
summarized by  treatment group . 
9.4.5. Interim A nalysis
The IDMC will periodically  receive unblinded safety  reports containing, at a minimum, 
clinical endpoints (whether adjudicated or pending adjudication) and SAEs, from an 
independent Statistical Data Anal ysis Center (SDAC) while the study  isongoing.  The 
IDMC may  recommend stopping the study  for safety  at an y time . 
In addition, the IDMC will evaluate the co -primary  MACE endpoint to assess for futility  
of achieving non -inferiority  at study  completion. Pre-specified guidelines governing the 
decision to continue or stop the study  will consider signals for harm, the predictive 
probability  of achieving at least non -inferiority  at trial end and the risk of incorrectly  
stopping for futility .  In addition to MACE, any  decisions regarding futility  will take into 
account data related to: 1) components of MACE, 2) endpoints describing BP, 3) efficacy  
in rhEPO hy poresponders, 4) other safet y and efficacy data across the daprodustat 
clinical program ,5) emerging data in the public domain pertaining to sa fety or efficacy  of 
HIF-proly l hydroxy lase inhibitors , and 6) an y other data considered to be relevant b y the 
IDMC .  The IDMC will make a recommendation to GSK and the ESC chair as outlined 
in the I DMC charter regarding whether the stud y should continue un changed, be 
modified or be terminated.  
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
66There are no prospectively defined interim analy sis planned to stop the study  early  for 
benefit.  While the planned futility  anal ysis will have a small impact on reducing study -
wise Ty pe I error rate, there are no plans to adjust the alpha level used for t he final 
analysis. 
Further details of futility  rules and analy sis timings will be provided in the IDMC Charter 
and RAP.

Potential Risk of Clinical Significance Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy
Daprodustat 
Excessive erythropoiesis (polycythemia) leading to 
thrombosis and/or tissue ischemiaIn animal studies, excessive erythropoiesis attributed to daprodustat 
was associated with vascular congestion /inflammation , microthrombi, 
and tissue ischemia in a number of organs.
Following review of clinical data received to date, this has not been 
identified as a safety concern for daprodustat.
Phase 2 dose -ranging studies, and associated statistical and exposure 
response modelling has informed Phase 3 dose rationale, starting 
doses, dose steps, and dose adjustment scheme to optimize Hgb 
management. Specific eligibility criteria related to 
requirements for entry Hgb are detailed in 
Section 5.1.
Hgb will be closely monitored throughout the 
dosing period as outlined in the Time and 
Events Table Section 7.1.
Specific guidance for dose adjustment, dose 
interruption, or discontinuation of daprodustat 
based on achieved Hgb (including rate of 
change) is provided in Section 6.3and 
Section 6.12.
Unblinded monitoring of safety data by an 
IDMC in -stream throughout the study.
Worsening of hypertension In a dog cardiovascular study, single oral doses of daprodustat (up to 
90 mg/kg) did not produce effects on blood pressure.
Marketed rhEPO and its analogues have been associa ted with risks 
related to uncontrolled hypertension, including the need for initiation of 
or increases in antihypertensive therapy when used in patients with 
anemia of CKD (i.e. 25 % Epogen, 27% Mircera, and 40% Aranesp 
treated patients with renal anemia re quired initiation or increase in 
their anti -hypertensive medications; hypertensive encephalopathy and 
seizures have been reported. The contribution of rhEPO -associated 
hypertension to the unfavourable effects on cardiovascular outcomes 
remains uncertain).

phase 3 studies (52 -week treatment duration)]: 
oThe majority (>90% ) of subjects had a baseline history of 
hypertension .
oNo meaningful difference was seen between treatment groups in 
AEs (preferred term) of “hypertension” [29/688 (4 %) daprodustat 
vs. 19/404 (4%) rhEPO; 0.91 relative risk (RR) (95% confidence 
interval: 0.5, 1.67)] or “blood pressure increased” [16 (2 %) 
daprodustat vs. 7 (2%) rhEPO; RR 1.22 (0.48,3.11)]. Results 
were not substantively different between non -dialysis and 
haemodialysis subjects.
oAlthough no clinically meaningful changes in blood pressure were 
observed, subjects in both treatment groups required increases in 
anti-HTN medications:
oIn the 24 -week global phase 2b studies, 25/170 (15%) 
of ND subjects receiving daprodustat vs. 18/80 (14%) 
control and 22/177 (12% ) of HD subjects receiving 
daprodustat vs. 2/39 (5%) control.
oIn the 52 -week Japan phase 3 studies, 57/149 (38%) of 
ND subjects receiving daprodustat vs. 68/150 (45%) 
rhEPO and 51/136 (38 %) of HD subjects receiving 
daprodustat vs. 66/135 (49%) for rhEPO.
The data received to date from completed clinical trials with 
daprodustat are insufficient t o refute this risk.

events , thrombosis of vascular access at Hgb levels

Esophageal and gastric erosionsIn animal studies, undesirable GI effects including emesis, abnormal 
feces and/or decreased food consumption/body weight loss and 
stomach erosions/ ulcers wi th hemorrhage were observed with 
daprodustat.  
In rats, stomach erosions were observed with intravenous and oral 
administration of daprodustat.
Stomach erosions/ulcers also reported in rats with some marketed 
rhEPO and its analogs.
In clinical trials to d ate with daprodustat, mild -moderate GI signs and 
symptoms represent the most frequently reported adverse event, 
however causal association has not been established.
Following review of clinical data received to date, GI erosions have not 
been identified as a safety concern for daprodustat. Suspected GI bleeding or significant 
symptoms consistent with erosions or ulcers 
should be investigated diagnostically (i.e. 
endoscopic examination) as clinically 
warranted.
Unblinded monitoring of safety data by an

Cancer -related mortality and tumor progression and 
recurrenceMarketed rhEPO and its analogs have been associated with increased 
risk of cancer related morbidity and mortality when used in patients 
with cancer.
Administrati on of 60mg/kg daprodustat to mice caused minimal 
increases in circulating VEGF while significant EPO increases were 
observed.

VEGF plasma concentrations was observed at doses ranging 
from 10 to 150 mg. 
In studies up to 24 weeks duration at doses up to 25mg, changes 
in VEGF plasma concentration were variable but similar relative 
to control.
Systemic EPO concentration s within the physiologic range.

In studies up to 4 weeks duration at doses of 10 to 30 mg:
oDose dependent increases in plasma VEGF and EPO 
concentrations were observed.
oPre-dose concentrations of EPO and VEGF were near 
orbelow baseline indicating no accumulation of EPO or 
VEGF after three times weekly dosing.
Following review of clinical data received to date, this has not been 
identified as a safety concern for daprodustat. 
Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH)A role for HIF -regulated pathways in the pathophysiology of PAH has 
been suggested based on well established effects of acute and chronic 
hypoxia in man on the pulmonary vasculature (vasoconstriction), and 
by findings in patients with na turally occurring mutations that result in 
decreased HIF degradation [ Smith , 2006; Formenti , 2011].
There have been no histopathologic findings suggestive of PAH in pre -
clinical safety studies with daprodustat up to 13 weeks duration in 
dogs, up to 2 years in rats and mice, and up to 39 weeks in monkeys.
Acute hypoxic challenge (rats):   Daprodustat produced increases in 
peak right ventricular pressure (PRVP) during acute hypoxia that were 
slightly higher than the vehicle control group. However, these hypoxia -
induced PRVP changes were within the range of PRVP changes noted  Unblinded monitoring of safety data by an

among untreated rats.
Results from a clinical study of acute hypoxic challenge in healthy 
volunteers demonstrated that short -term (5 days) therapy with 
daprodustat 5mg or 100mg has no clinically significant effect on 
transthoracic echocardiographic (ECHO) estimates of pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure (PASP) under either normoxic or hypoxic 
conditions.
ECHO assessments performed in Phase 2b studies (24 weeks 
treatment duration) did not identify any clinically meaningf ul changes in 
PASP in subjects not on dialysis for daprodustat. In hemodialysis 
subjects, mean absolute change from baseline in PASP was similar for 
both treatment groups; however, there was a numeric imbalance 
(Daprodustat: 8 [7%]; Control 0) in subjects reaching the PASP PCI 
(>20 mmHg increase from baseline). Regarding this imbalance, there 
were a number of confounding factors in the study, most notably a 
4.5:1 randomization scheme and inconsistency in timing of ECHOs 
relative to dialysis day.  Additional ly, 2 of 3 subjects with resolution of 
PASP on safety follow -up ECHOs had confounding conditions that 
could contribute to resolution other than discontinuation of study 
treatment; and there was no dose relationship for subjects meeting the 
PASP PCI criteri on. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to conclude 
a relationship to treatment with daprodustat .
Following review of clinical data received to date, this has not been 
identified as a safety concern for daprodustat .  
Cardiomyopathy Published data suggest that cardiac effects of HIF stabilization are 
likely a function of the mechanism, extent, and duration of the effects, 
and can range from protective to detrimental depending upon the 
specific model and experimental conditions utilized.
With lifetime exposure to daprodustat in a 2 -year rat oral 
carcinogenicity study, an exacerbation of rat spontaneous, progressive 
cardiomyopathy (PCM)(focal myofiber degeneration/necro sis with  Unblinded monitoring of safety data by an

inflammatory infiltrates) was observed at doses of 0.8 mg/kg/day and 
above, although total incidence and severity distribution within any 
daprodustat -group were within historical control ranges.  This is 
consistent with an equivocal threshold for exacerbation of 
spontaneous, progressive cardiomyopathy at 0.8 mg/kg/day which is 
also the threshold dose for observing increased Hct values in 
individual rats.  Cardiomyopathy has not been associated with 
naturally occurring mutation in man which results in increased HIF 
stabilization.
ECHO assessments performed in phase 2b studies (24 weeks 
treatment duration) did not identify any clinically meaningful changes in 
LVEF for daprodustat .
Following review of clinical data received to date, this has not been

neovascularizationIncreases in local (ocular) VEGF production with retinal 
neovascularization and macular edema observed in diabetic 
retinopathy and to choroidal leakage, edema and neovascularization 
seen in age -related macular degeneration [ Campochiaro , 2006].
Administration of 60 mg/kg daprodustat to mice caused minimal 
increases in circulating VEGF while significant EPO increases were 
observed.
Aside from congestion of retinal vessels and optic disc hyperemia 
secondary to markedly increased red cell mass, there were no ocular 
abnormalities observed in non -clinical studies.
In clinical studies up to 4 weeks duration, a dose -ordered increase in 
VEGF plasma concentrations was observed at doses ranging from 10

Drug-drug interactions Daprodustat is a substrate of CYP2C8 :  Co-administration of 
daprodustat with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor (gemfibrozil) increased the 
Cmax and AUC of daprodustat, 4 -and 19 -fold, respectively, while co -
administration of a weak inhibitor (trimethoprim) increased the Cmax 
and AUC of daprodustat by 1.3 -and 1.5 -fold, respectively. Population 
PK analysis from completed Phase 2 studies suggests that co -
administration of daprodustat with a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor 
(clopidogrel), leads to a ~ 2 -fold increase in AUC, with no clinically -
significant increase in the measured Hgb response. Although CYP2C8 
induction studies were not performed, co -administration of daprodustat 
with an inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin/rifampicin) may decrease 
the exposure of daprodustat.
Even though co -administration of daprodustat with strong inhibitors 
and inducers of CYP2C8 is prohibited, inadvertent co -administration 
may occur. Due to the known time delay in enhancing erythropoiesis 
by daprodustat, co -administration with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors for up 
to 14 days is not anticipated to lead to immediate marked increases in 
hemoglobin levels. Therefore, there is adequate tim e to change to 
alternate therapy that does not inhibit CYP2C8.
Additionally, as the time for maximum induction of CYP2C8 occurs 
after approximately 10 -14 days of dosing with rifampin ( Brodie , 2013 
and Ohnhaus , 1989), daprodustat systemic exposure will decrease 
over time which will result in a lag period before an effect on Hgb is 
recognized and is of clinical concern.
Daprodustat is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 :  A clinical drug interaction 
study between 25mg and 100mg daprodustat with a CYP2C8 
substrate (i.e., pioglitazone) showed that there is no PK interaction at 
these doses of daprodustat.  
Daprodustat is a substrate of BCRP : Population PK analysis from 
Phase 2 studies suggested that while BCRP inhibitors were a 
covariate for daprodustat CL/F (8.6% lower clearance) the predicted  Co-administration of daprodustat with strong 
CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) and 
inducers (e.g., rifampin/rifampicin) is not 
permitted as outlined in Section 6.10.2 .
Co-administration of daprodustat with 
moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (i.e., clopidogrel, 
teriflunomide, deferasirox) should be 
performed with caution. If one of these 
medications is started, stopped or the dose is 
changed, Hgb should be monitored every 4 
week s for 12 weeks as outlined in Section 6.3
and Appendix 6 .

9312.7. Appendix 7: Definition of and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -Up and Reporting of A dverse Events
12.7.1. Definition of A dverse Events
Adverse Event Definition:
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject, temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product.
NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal lab oratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of a medicinal product.
Events meeting AE definition include:
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) 
or other safet y assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, SBP, DBP or HR 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically  
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator.
Exacerbation of a chronic or inte rmittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after placebo run -in or randomized treatment 
administration even though it may  have been present prior to the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either placebo 
run-in, randomized treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not
be reported as an AE/SAE unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self -harming intent.  This should be reported regardless of sequelae).
"Lack of efficacy " or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be 
repor ted as an AE or SAE.  However, the signs and sy mptoms and/or clinical 
sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy  will be reported if they  fulfill the definition 
of an AE or SAE.
Events NOT meeting definition of an AE include:
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal safet y 
assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by  the 
investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.
The disease/disorder being studied or expecte d progression, signs, or s ymptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s 
condition.
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
94 Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE.
Situat ions where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study  that do not worsen.
12.7.2. Definition of Serious A dverse Events
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/sy mptoms of the disease under study , 
death due to progression of disease, etc).
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, 
at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
NOTE:
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  I t does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically  might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
NOTE:
In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually  
involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency  ward for 
observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s 
office or out -patient setting.  Complications that occur du ring hospitalization are 
AEs.  If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any  other serious criteria, 
the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was 
necessary , the AE should be considered serious.
Hospitali zation for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE.
d.Results in disability/incapacity
NOTE:
The term disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct 
normal life fun ctions.
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
95and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may  interfere or prevent every day 
life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f.Other situations:
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the above definition.  These sh ould also be considered 
serious.
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency  
or drug abuse
g.Is associated with liver injury andimpaired liver function defined as:
ALT 3xULN and total bilirubin*2xUL N (>35% direct), or
ALT 3xULN and INR**>1.5.
* Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available.  If 
fractionation is unavailable and ALT 3xUL N and total bilirubin 2xULN, then the 
event is still to be reported as an SAE.
** INR testing not required per protocol and the th reshold value does not apply  to 
subjects receiving anticoagulants.  If INR measurement is obtained, the value is to be 
recorded on the SAE form.
12.7.3. Recording of A Es and SA Es
AEs and SAE Recording:
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory , and diagnostics reports) 
relative to the event.
The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE in 
the eCRF
It is notacceptable for the inv estigator to send photocopies of the subject’s medical 
records to PPD in lieu of completion of the GSK, AE/SAE eCRF page.
There may  be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are 
requested b y PPD.  In this instance, all subject identifie rs, with the exception of the 
subject number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records prior to 
submission of to PPD.
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
96symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  I n such cases, the diagnosis will be 
documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms.
Subject -completed Patient Reported Outcomes questionnaires and the collection of 
AE data are independent components of the study .
12.7.4. Evaluatin g AEs and SA Es
Assessment of Intensity
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity  for each AE and SAE reported 
during the stud y and will assign it to one of the following categories:
Mild:  An event that is easily  tolerated by  the subject, causing minimal discomfort 
and not interfering with every day activities.
Moderate:  An event that is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with normal 
every day activities
Severe:  An event that prevents normal every day activities. -an AE that is assesse d 
as severe will not be confused with an SAE. Severity  is a category  utilized for rating 
the intensity  of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the pre -defined 
outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE.
Assessment of Causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between placebo run -in or 
randomized treatment and the occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A "reasonable possibility " is meant to convey  that there are facts/evidence or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled 
out.
The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
Alternative causes, such as natural history  of the underly ingdiseases, concomitant 
therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the placebo 
run-in or randomized treatment will be considered and investigated.
The investigator will also consult the IB and/or Product I nformation, for mark eted 
products, in the determination of his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality .
There may  be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to PPD.  However, it is very important 
that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
97prior to the initial transmission of the SAE data to PPD.
Theinvestigator may  change his/her opinion of causality  in light of follow -up 
information, amending the SAE data collection tool accordingl y.
The causality  assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory  
reporting requirements.
Follow -upof AEs and SA Es
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as may  be indicated or as requested by  PPD to 
elucidate as fully  as possible the nature and/or causality  of the AE or SAE.
The investigator is obligated to assist.  This may  include additional laboratory  tests 
or investigations, histopathological examinations or consultation with other health 
care professionals.
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally  completed eCRF.
The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to PPD within the designated 
reporting time frames.
12.7.5. Reporting of SA Es to PPD
SAE reporting to PPD via electronic data collection tool
Primary  mechanism for reporting SAEs to PPD will be the electronic data collection 
tool
If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for greater than 24 hours, the site will use the 
paper SAE data collection tool and fax it to the Medical Monitor
Site will enter the serious adverse event data into the electronic s ystem as soon as it 
becomes available.
The investigator will be required to confirm review of the SAE causality  by ticking 
the ‘reviewed’ box at the bottom of the eCRF page within 72 hours of submission of 
the SAE.
After the stud y is completed at a given si te, the electronic data collection tool (e.g., 
InForm s ystem) will be taken off -line to prevent the entry  of new data or changes to 
existing data
If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study  subject or receives updated data 
on a previousl y reporte d SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken 
off-line, the site can report this information on a paper SAE form or to the Medical 
Monitor by  telephone.
Contacts for SAE receipt can be found at the beginning of this protocol on the 
Sponsor /Medical Monitor Contact Information page.

10212.9. Appendix 9: Liver Safety  Drug Restart Guidelines
If subject meets liver chemistry  stopping criteria do not restart randomized treatment 
unless there is a clear underly ing cause for the liver stopping event other than drug -
induced liver injury and:
GSK Medical Governance approval is granted (as described below),
Ethics and/or I RB approval is obtained, if required, and
Separate consent for randomized treatment restart is signed b y the subject
If GSK Medical Governance approval to restart subject with randomized treatment is 
notgranted , then subject must permanently  discontinue randomized treatment and 
requested to continue in the study  for protocol -specified follow up assessments.
Restart Following Transient Resolving Liver Stopping Events Not Related to 
Randomized Treatment
Restart refers to resuming randomized treatment following liver stopping events in which 
there is a clear underl ying cause (other than DILI) of the liver event (e.g. biliary  
obstruction, pancreatic events, hy potension, acute viral hepatitis). Furthermore, there 
should be no evidence of alcoholic hepatitis or h ypersensitivity , and the randomized 
treatment should not be associated with HLA markers of liver injury .
Approval b y GSK for randomized treatment restart can be considered where:
Investigator  requests consideration for randomized treatment restart if liver 
chemistries have a cle ar underly ing cause (e.g., biliary  obstruction, hy potension and 
liver chemistries have improved to normal or are within 1.5 x baseline and AL T 
<3xUL N).
Restart risk factors (e.g. fever, rash, eosinophilia, or hy persensitivity , alcoholic 
hepatitis, possible randomized treatment -induced liver injury ) or randomized 
treatment has an HLA genetic marker associated with liver injury  (e.g. lapatinib, 
abacavir, amoxicillin/clavulanate) are reviewed and excluded.
Ethics Committee or I nstitutional Review Board approva l of randomized treatment 
restart must be obtained, as required.
If restart of randomized treatment is approved by  GSK Medical Governance in 
writing, the subject must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits 
and risks of randomized tre atment administration, including the possibility  of 
recurrent, more severe liver injury  or death.  
The subject must also provide signed informed consent specificall y for the 
randomized treatment restart.  Documentation of informed consent must be recorded
in the study  chart.  
Randomized treatment must be administered at the dose specified b y GSK.
Subjects approved b y GS K Medical Governance for restarting randomized treatment 
must return to the clinic once a week for liver chemistry  tests until stable live r

103chemistries have been demonstrated and then laboratory  monitoring may  resume as 
per protocol. 
If after randomized treatment re -start, subject meets protocol -defined liver chemistry  
stopping criteria, follow usual stopping criteria instructions.
PPD Medi cal Monitor, and the Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board as 
required, must be informed of the subject’s outcome following randomized treatment 
restart. 
PPD to be notified of any AEs, as per Section 7.4and Appendix 7.

10412.10. Appendix 10: Collection of Pregnancy  Information
Investigator will collect p regnancy  information on any  female subject who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study .
Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to PPD within 
24 hours of learning of a subject's pregnancy .
The subject will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . The 
investigator will collect follow up information on mother and infant, which will be 
forwarded to PPD.  Generally , follow -up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 
weeks bey ondthe estimated delivery  date. 
Any termination of pregnancy  will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.
While pregnancy  itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any  pregnancy  
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or 
SAE.
A spontaneous abortion is alway s considered to be an SAE and will be reported as 
such.  
Any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study  pregnancy  which is considered by  the 
investigator reasonably  related to the randomized treatment, will be reported to PPD 
as described in Appendix 7. While the investigator is not obligated to actively  seek 
this information in former study  participants, he or she may  learn of an SAE through 
spontaneous reporting.
Any female subject who becomes pregnant while partici pating must permanently 
discontinue randomized treatment. Subjects will be asked to attend an Early 
Treatment Discontinuation visit and expected to attend study visits through the End 
of Study visit, according to the study visit schedule, unless consent is actively 
withdrawn.

10512.11. Appendix 11: Genetic Research
Genetics –Background
Naturall y occurring genetic variation may  contribute to inter -individual variability  in 
response to medicines, as well as an individual's risk of developing specific diseases. 
Genet ic factors associated with disease characteristics may  also be associated with 
response to therap y, and could help to explain some clinical study outcomes. For 
example, genetic variants associated with age -related macular degeneration (AMD) are 
reported to account for much of the risk for the condition [ Gorin , 2012] with certain 
variants reported to influence treatment response [ Chen , 2012]. Thus, knowledge of the 
genetic etiology  of disease may  better inform understanding of disease and the 
development of medicines. Additionally , geneti c variability  may  impact the

Genetic Research Objectives and A nalyses
The objectives of the genetic research are to investigate the relationship between genetic 
variants and: 
Response to medicine, including any treatment regimens under investigation in this 
study  or an y concomitant medicines;
Anemia associated with CKD susceptibility , severity , and progression and related 
conditions
Genetic data may  be generated while the study  is underway  or following compl etion of 
the study .  Genetic evaluations may  include focused candidate gene approaches and/or 
examination of a large number of genetic variants throughout the genome (whole genome 
analyses). Genetic anal yses will utilize data collected in the study  and wil l be limited to 
understanding the objectives highlighted above.  Analy ses may  be performed using data 
from multiple clinical studies to investigate these research objectives.
Appropriate descriptive and/or statistical analy sis methods will be used. A detai led 
description of an y planned anal yses will be documented in a Reporting and Analy sis Plan 
(RAP) prior to initiation of the anal ysis. Planned analy ses and results of genetic 
investigations will be reported either as part of the clinical RAP and study  repo rt, or in a 
separate genetics RAP and report, as appropriate.
Study Population
Any subject who is randomized in the study  can participate in genetic research.  Any  
subject who has received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant must be excluded from 
the gene tic research.

106Study Assessments and Procedures
A key  component of successful genetic research is the collection of samples during 
clinical studies. Collection of samples, even when no a priori hypothesis has been 
identified, may  enable future genetic anal yses to be conducted to help understand 
variability  in disease and medicine response.  
A 6 ml blood sample will be taken for Deox yribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction. A 
blood sample is collected at the Baseline visit, after the subject has been 
randomized an d provided informed consent for genetic research. Instructions for 
collection and shipping of the genetic sample are described in the laboratory 
manual. The DNA from the blood sample may  undergo quality  control analy ses to 
confirm the integrit y of the samp le. If there are concerns regarding the quality  of 
the sample, then the sample may  be destroy ed. The blood sample is taken on a 
single occasion unless a duplicate sample is required due to an inabilit y to utilize 
the original sample.  
The genetic sample i s labelled (or “coded”) with the same stud y specific number used to 
label other samples and data in the study .   This number can be traced or linked back to 
the subject by  the investigator or site staff. Coded samples do not carry  personal 
identifiers (suc h as name or social security  number). 
Samples will be stored securel y and may be kept for up to 15 years after the last subject 
completes the study , or GSK may  destroy  the samples sooner.  GSK or those working 
with GSK (for example, other researchers) wil l only  use samples collected from the study  
for the purpose stated in this protocol and in the informed consent form.  Samples may  be 
used as part of the development of a companion diagnostic to support the GSK medicinal 
product.
Subjects can request their sample to be destro yed at any  time.
Informed Consent
Subjects who do not wish to participate in the genetic research may  still participate in the 
study .  Informed consent for genetic research consent must be obtained prior to any  blood 
being taken.
Subject Withdrawal from Study
If a subject who has consented to participate in genetic research withdraws from the 
clinical study  for any  reason other than being lost to follow -up, the subject will be given a 
choice of one of the following options concerni ng the genetic sample, if already  
collected:
Continue to participate in the genetic research in which case the genetic DNA 
sample is retained
Discontinue participation in the genetic research and destroy  the genetic DNA 
sample 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
107If a subject withdraws consent for genetic research or requests sample destruction for an y 
reason, the investigator must complete the appropriate documentation to request sample 
destruction within the timeframe specified b y GSK and maintain the documentation in 
the site study  records . 
Genoty pe data may  be generated during the study  or after completion of the study  and 
may be anal yzed during the study  or stored for future anal ysis. 
If a subject withdraws consent for genetic research and genot ype data has not been 
analyzed, it wi ll not be analy zed or used for future research.  
Genetic data that has been anal yzed at the time of withdrawn consent will continue 
to be stored and used, as appropriate. 
Screen and Baseline Failures
If a sample for genetic research has been collected an d it is determined that the subject 
does not meet the entry  criteria for participation in the study , then the investigator should 
instruct the subject that their genetic sample will be destro yed. No forms are required to 
complete this process as it will be completed as part of the consent and sample 
reconciliation process.  In this instance a sample destruction form will not be available to 
include in the site files.
Provision of Study Results and Confidentiality  of Subject’s Genetic Data
GSK may  summarize the genetic research results in the clinical study  report, or 
separately  and may  publish the results in scientific journals. 
GSK may  share genetic research data with other scientists to further scientific 
understanding in alignment with the informed conse nt. GSK does not inform the subject, 
family  members, insurers, or employ ers of individual genoty ping results that are not 
known to be relevant to the subject’s medical care at the time of the study , unless 
required b y law. This is due to the fact that the information generated from genetic 
studies is generall y preliminary in nature, and therefore the significance and scientific 
validity  of the results are undetermined.  Further, data generated in a research laboratory  
may not meet regulatory  requirements fo r inclusion in clinical care.

10812.12. Appendix 12: A  Sub -stud y of the Effect of Daprodustat 
Compared to rhEPO on BP in Hemodialy sis Dependent 
Subjects wi th Anemia A ssociated with Chronic Kidney  
Disease who Switch from ESA s
12.12.1. Introduction and Rationale
Hypertension is one of the major risk factors associated with cardiovascular morbidity  
and mortality  and is common in patients with advanced CKD Stages 3b thro ugh 5.
Treatment of anemia associated with CKD using ESAs has the associated risk of 
increased BP.  ESA -induced elevation of BP often necessitates initiation of, or increases 
in, antihy pertensive medications in patients with CKD.  While SBP and DBP are bot h of 
prognostic importance, SBP is the overall best predictor of future cardiovascular risk in a 
hypertensive population [ Peters , 2013].  Therefore, SBP was chosen as the primary  
endpoint in this ABPM sub -study .  ABPM is being used to measure BP in this sub -study  
because previous studies have used this BP measurement modality  in dial ysis subjects to 
establish an association with mortality [Agarwal , 2010].
This sub -study  is intended to compare daprodustat to rhEPO on BP as assessed by  ABPM 
in dialy sis-dependent subjects with anemia associated with CKD who switch from ESAs.

11012.12.3. Study Design
This is a multicenter sub -study  of the main ASCEND -D study .  Subjects who qualify  for 
the main study  will be assessed for enrolment.  Approximately  136 subjects from centers 
in selected countries that are participating in the main study  will be randomized.  
Note: if the target number of randomized subjects in the ABPM sub -study  is not achieved
when themain study  is fully  enrolled , recruitment may be extended to allow 
randomization in the ABPM sub -study  tocomplete .
12.12.3.1. ABPM Quality  Control Criteria
Subjects will need to wear the ABPM device for two 24-hour sessions during the study :
at a mid -week dialy sis visit starting at Week -4 until 1 week prior to randomization 
(baseline ABPM) and then at Week 16.  The ABPM device will be placed after 
assessments for the main study  have been completed. Subjects will be expected to wear 
the ABPM device for 24 hours at each session.  The ABPM device will meas ure BP and 
heart rate every  30 minutes during both awake and asleep hours.  The times the subject 
awakens and goes to sleep during this 24hour period will be recorded.
For each session the ABPM Quality  Control (QC) criteria as defined in the Project 
Requ irement Specification (PRS) for ABPM must be met. If these criteria are not met 
the ABPM may  be repeated (see Section 12.12.3.3 ).
12.12.3.2. Eligibility  Criteria –Screening
Additional Inclusion Criteria
In addition to meeting entry  criteria for the main study , a subject will be eligible for 
inclusion in this sub -study onl y if all of the following criteria appl y.
1.Signed written informed consent prior to beginning sub -study -related procedures.  
Note:   Consent to participate in this sub -study  is separate from consent to participate 
in the main study , and willbe signed either at Week -8 or at Week -4prior to ABPM 
assessments .
2.Use of the same antihy pertensive treatment for the 6 weeks prior to the Screening 
visit, through the entire Screening period and at randomization.

[randomization (Day 1) only] .
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
111Additional Exclusion Criteria
A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this sub -study  if any  of the following 
criteria apply :
1.Receiving peritoneal dialy sis or home HD.
2.Subjects who are at high risk for loss to follow -up (e.g., subjects who are known to 
not regularl y attend dial ysis, subjects who may require frequent hospitalizations or 
vascular access interventions).
3.Evidence of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter at time of baseline ABPM assessment
(seeSection 12.12.3.3 ).
4.Oscillometer/sphy gmomanometer cuff cannot accommodate their upper arm 
circumference.
5.BP cannot be measured in the arm opposite of current vascular access.
6.Subjects who experience, on avera ge, >5% increase in weight above EDW between 
mid-week dial ysis treatments between Week -8 and baseline ABPM reading .
12.12.3.3. Study  Assessments
Week -8 Study Visit :
Subject’s consent for ABPM is obtained (Note: if missed this may  be obtained at 
Week -4prior to ABPM assessments ).  
Week -4 Study Visit :
Abaseline ABPM reading must be initiated at a mid-week dial ysis visi t and may be 
performed following completion of the Week -4 study  assessments or at a subsequent 
mid-week dial ysis visit provided it occurs at least 1 week prior to randomization.
Post-dialy sis and prior to ABPM, subjects will be assessed for the presence of atrial 
fibrillation /flutter as follows: s ubjects with an irregular heart beat detected during heart 
ratemeasurement will undergo an ECG andthose with documented atrial fibrillation or 
atrial flutter will not be eligible for ABPM. 
The ABPM device will be placed on the arm opposite current vascular access, and will be 
removed by the subject at home after a minimum of 24 hours of wear ;the device will be 
returned to the research staff at the next visit , which ideally is no later than 1 week prior 
to randomization to allow for QC of the ABPM . See SRM for guidance on placement of 
ABPM device.
If the subject fails to meet the baseline ABPM QC criteria and agrees to repeat the ABPM 
procedure, then:
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
112The baseline ABPM procedure can be repeated at the next mid -week dialy sis visit.
Note: the atrial fibrillation /flutter assessment should be repeated prior to device 
placement.
Day 1 (randomization) may  be delay ed.
If the baseline ABPM fails the QC criteria after three attempts , then the subject will 
not be enrolled in this ABPM sub -study .
Subjects will have their body  weight measured and recorded in the eCRF both pre -and 
post-dialy sis (see SRM for guidance on bod y weight measurement).
Day 1 ( Randomization):
If the ABPM measurements meet the QC criteria, the subject can be randomized.
Subjects who either do not qualify  for entry  into the ABPM sub -study  after failing QC 
criteria a third time or who do not desire to continue in the ABPM sub -study  although 
they pass the QC criteria, should continue with randomization into the main study  
following the schedule of assessments as outlined in Table 7of the main protocol if 
appropriate.
Week 16 Study Visit :
At Week 16, at the mid -week dial ysis visit and after all main study  assessments have 
been completed, the subject’s pre -and post -dialysis weight will be measured and the 
EDW will be recorded .  
The ABPM device will be placed on the subject’s arm by site personnel . After a 
minimum of 24 h ours of wear, the device will be removed b y the subject at home and 
returned to the research staff at the next visit . The time and date of stud y medication 
administration, before and while wearing the ABPM device, will be recorded.
If the ABPM fails the QC criteria (same as baseline), up to two additional attempts may  
be made at subsequent, mid -week dial ysis visits.  No further attempts are allowed.  The 
subject will continue study  visits in the main study  as scheduled.
12.12.3.4. Permanent Dis continuation of Randomized Treatment
A subject who permanently  discontinues randomized treatment prior to completing the 
ABPM sub -study  should remain in the sub -study  and complete the Week 16 ABPM 
assessment unless consent to participate in the ABPM sub -study is withdrawn (see also 
Section 5.5).
12.12.3.5. Estimated Dry  Weight and A ntihy pertensive Medication Changes
It is preferred that no changes are made to ED W and antihy pertensive medications while 
the subject is part of the sub -study .  
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
113If changes in EDW and/or antihy pertensive medications are necessary , these must be 
documented in the eCRF along with the reasons.  Subjects will remain in the sub -study  
regardless of an y changes.
12.12.3.6. Withdra wal from A BPM Sub -Study
If a subject participating in this sub -study  withdraws from the sub -study , the reason for 
the withdrawal must be recorded in the eCRF. The subject will remain in the main study  
unless the subject withdraws consent from the main study .
12.12.4. Sample Size and Power Calculations
The sample size of this sub -study  has been designed based on the primary  sub-study  
objective to demonstrate superiority  in average SBP change from baseline to end of sub -
study between arms (daprodustat versus rhEPO), measured b y ABPM over a 24 hour 
assessment period.  Assuming a one-sided 2. 5% significance level, a true standard 
deviation for SBP change from baseline measur ed by  ABPM of 11 mmHg [ Peixoto , 
2000], and up to a 20% withdrawal rate from the sub -study , a sample size of 68 subjects 
per group ( 136 subjects in total) wil l provide greater than 80% power to detect a 
-6mmHg difference in treatment groups (i.e., achieve superiorit y).  Under these 
assumptions, superiority  will be established if there is more than a 4.2 mmHg mean 
difference observed in favor of daprodustat.
Assuming a 40% screen failure rate for the additional ABPM entry  criteria, 
approximately  228 subjects that are eligible for the main study  will need to be screened 
for the sub -study  in order to randomize approximately  136 subjects. See Section 9.2.3 for 
more information about sample size adjustments .
Unblinded ABPM data will be reviewed b y the IDMC during the conduct of the trial as 
part of their data monitoring responsibilities. No formal interim anal ysis is planned.
12.12.5. Statistical A nalysis
The primary  sub-study  estimand is to compare the treatment effect on change from 
baseline in 24hour average SBP at end of sub -study , in all randomized sub -study  
subjects.  The statistical model for anal ysis will be an ANCOVA with terms for treatment 
and baseline 24 hour average SBP.  This model will provide a point estimate and two -
sided 95% CI  for the treatment effect and a one-sided p-value for the superiority  
assessment.  Superiority  will be established if the p -value is <0.0 25.  The primary  
analysis population will be the ABPM sub -study -ITT population defined as randomized 
subjects who were also entered into the ABPM sub -study .
Given the nature of ABPM measurem ent, a high degree of dropout unrelated to 
randomized treatment is anticipated.  The potential high level of missing data poses a 
challenge in the interpretation of the primary  ABPM sub -study  analy sis.  The reason for 
missing ABPM data will be examined to explore the impact of missing data on the sub -
study  primary  efficacy  conclusions.  I f the majority  (defined as >70%) of the missing 
data is due to either subject unwillingness to repeat the ABPM procedure or due to an un -
evaluable reading, then data will b e treated as missing at random and the primary  anal ysis 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
114will be considered sufficient.  Otherwise, a sensitivity  anal ysis may  be performed that 
will use multiple imputation from the active control arm to replace data from both 
treatment groups that was mis sing due to reasons other than subject unwillingness or un -
evaluable readings.  Further supplementary  analyses may  include an ABPM per -protocol 
population (PP) analy sis, utilizing all ABPM -ITT subjects who are not major protocol 
violators or who did not ch ange BP medications during the sub -study .  Further details of 
sensitivity  and supplementary  analyses will be described in the RAP.
In order to contextualise the primary  between -group comparison, a key  secondary  
objective is to assess within -group changes f rom baseline over the sub-study .  
Assessment of within -group changes will support interpretation of the primary  anal ysis 
by identify ing whether there was an absence of an increase in BP in one or both treatment 
groups.  To that end, two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for change 
from baseline in each ABPM parameter separatel y for each treatment group.  For either 
treatment group, a lack of adverse effect on the primary  endpoint of average SBP at end 
of sub -study will be conclu ded if the upper 95% confidence limit is no more than 4 
mmHg.  This margin was chosen as it is less than the clinically meaningful change of 5 
mmHg [ Whelton , 2002] and it is half the historical increase in SBP observed with rhEPO 
[Krapf , 2009].
The mean and two-sided 95% CI  will be estimated from the primary  stati stical model for 
within treatment arm SBP change from baseline to end of sub -study .
The change from baseline 24 hour average DBP, mean arterial pressure and heart rate at 
end of sub -study will be assessed in a similar way as the primary , using analogous 
ANCOVA models with treatment and baseline as covariates.
The differences in proportion of subjects that increase/decrease their BP medication 
(number or dose) will be assessed using Fisher’s Exact Test.  The differences between 
treatment groups in the prop ortion of subjects that convert from dippers/non -dippers at 
baseline to non -dippers/dippers at end of sub -study will also be assessed using Fisher’s 
Exact Test.
Plots of the mean 24 hour average values ( two-sided 95% CIs) and mean changes from 
baseline in 24 hour average values ( two-sided 95% CI s) for BP will be provided by  
treatment group.
Additional statistical considerations will be addressed in the RAP.

to take the dose in the clinic after the pre -dose sample is collected.
The dose taken in the clinic should be from the same bottle(s ) the subject has 
been using prior to the PK visit , notfrom an y newly dispensed bottle(s) at the 
PK visit (Note: a subject placed on a dose hold at the previous visit should not
have PK samples taken; PK collection should be delay ed until the visit after the 
subject has restarted study  treatment ).
Record the date and actual time of the dose taken in the clinic and the three doses 
prior to the visit , and the date and actual time o f all PK samples collected. 
Samples may  be collected within 20 min of the planned collected time.
Based on the time of dosing, samples may  be obtained before, during, or after any  
dialy sis procedure. The start and stop time of the dialy sis procedure will also be 
recorded at this visit.
Plasma PK analy sis will be performed under the control of GSK PTS -DMPK/Scinovo, 
the details of which will be included in the SRM. Concentrations of main daprodustat 
and metabolites (GSK2391220 (M2), GSK2531403 (M3), and GS K2531401 (M13)) will 
be determined in plasma samples using the currently  approved bioanal ytical 
methodology .Raw data will be archived at the bioanal ytical site.  
12.13.6. Sample Size
It is estimated that 150 sub -study  subjects are required to have at least 80% p ower that 
the MACE rate in the sub -study  is within 20% of the MACE rate in main study .  To 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
118account for missing or non-evaluable PK samples, approximately  200 subjects will be 
randomized .See Section 9.2.3 for more information about sample size adjustments.   
Approximately  45% (n 65) of subjects in this sub -study  would be expected to meet the 
combined safet y endpoint (and n 85 subjects would not).  Based on a between subject 
variability  (CVb%) estimate for C max and C tauof up to 100% (as seen in a prior Phase 1 
study  in CKD and from population PK analy sis), 65 subjects would be sufficient to have 
>80% power that the 95% CI  around the geometric mean i s within 0.6 to 1.4 times the 
estimate.  This is considered sufficient precision for the descriptive anal ysis proposed.
12.13.7. PK/PD A nalyses
The ‘PK Population' is defined as subjects for whom a PK sample was obtained and 
analyzed.  This will be the population u sed for all the PK display s.
The following plasma PK parameters will be determined for daprodustat and metabolites: 
Ctau(pre-dose) and C max.
Plasma daprodustat and metabolites concentration data will be listed and summarized by  
planned collection time and daprodustat dose administered at PK visit.  PK parameter 
data will be listed and summarized by  daprodustat dose administered at PK visit, and 
dose-normalized (per mg) PK parameter data will be summarized.
All PK data will be stored in the Archives, GlaxoS mithKline Pharmaceuticals, R & D.
Based on exploratory  graphs (Section 12.13.2 ), and the efficacy  and safety  results from 
the main study , post -hoc exploratory  exposure -response/safet y modelling may be 
conducted, including exploratory  graphics with metabolites.  Further details will be 
provided in the RAP of the main study .

12212.14.2. Country -Specific Requirements for Czech Republic for 
Acceptable Contraceptive Methods
Purpose and Justification:
The purpose of this Czech Republic country -specific requirement is to specify  acceptable
contraceptive methods for use during participation in the study  200807. This is as a result 
of recent Czech Republic legislative requirements of CA directive KLH 22 dated 
22Mar2016 for contraception met hods.
Czech Republic Specific Contraception Requirements will apply in addition to the 
list of methods stated in Appendix 5 :
Men and women able to have childre n and sexually  active, must use acceptable methods 
of birth control from 30 day s prior to the first dose of randomized treatment and until 
completion of the Follow -up visit (4 -6 weeks after the end of randomized treatment).
Methods of birth control include , one highly  reliable method (such as intrauterine 
device, sterilisation of one of the partners, hormonal birth control methods) plus 
one supplementary  barrier method (such as condom, diaphragm) with a 
spermicide. 
Two barrier methods used in combination w ith spermicide, are considered 
asreliable contraception methods. 
The study  doctor will discuss with the subject the methods of birth control that should be 
used while he/she is in this study  and will help the subject to select the methods that are 
approp riate for him/her.

This study  includes both a 4 week screening and a 4 week placebo run -in period prior to 
randomization (Day  1). The screening period permits eligibility  based on laboratory  
assessments to be confirmed, while the run -in period will be used to establish complia nce 
with placebo and stud y procedures in an attempt to minimize withdrawn consent post -
randomization. This 8 -week period also provides an opportunity  for ESA users whose 
screening Hgb is above the Hgb required at randomization (i.e., >11.5 to 12 g/dL) to h ave 
their ESA dose reduced (but not stopped) to allow the Hgb to decrease in order to 
potentially  be eligible for randomization and to approach the Hgb target range (10 to 
11g/dL).

Investigators should be guided by local/regional guidelines and may stop 
administration of iron at a lower ferritin or TSAT level as long as subjects are 
maintained at a ferritin >100 ng/mL and TSAT >20%.
Section 6.12 Rescue Therapy; paragraph 2; sentence 2. New text added.
This rescue algorithm does not apply  to subjects with a decrease in Hgb as a result of an 
acute or subacute event with an identifiable cause (e.g., GI bleed, blood loss due to 
surgery  or vascular access).  In these cases, treatment should be directed to the specific 
cause and randomized treatment will b e continued .  If a subject is transfused as part of 
the treatment, then the randomized treatment will be maintained at the current dose 
(unless Hgb is ≥12g/dL which requires a dose hold).
Section 6.12 Rescue Therapy; Table 6; Step 1 Initial Intervention; bullet point 3. Text 
added for clarity
Step 1:
Initial 
InterventionWhile continuing randomized treatment (increase dose if HemoCue Hgb <7.5 g/dL; 
otherwise maintain current dose), intervene with one or more of the following as dictated 
by clinical comorbidities 
- Single course of IV iron up to 1000 mg ( in addition to the iron management criteria)
- Transfusion of up to two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) if clinically indicated
- Allow additional 4 weeks on randomized treatment (NOTE:  this is a required 
choice; can be combined with either or both of the above).
Section 6.13 Subjects changing dialysis modality; paragraph 1; sentences 2 and 3. New 
text added to clarify those randomized to rhEPO who transition from HD to PD will 
change from epoetin alfa to darbepoetin alfa.  
Subjects changing dialy sis modality  shou ld not be withdrawn from the study , and should 
continue on the same randomized treatment (daprodustat or rhEPO). Those subjects 
randomized to rhEPO who transition from PD to HD (in -center or home HD) will 
continue on darbepoetin alfa.  However, subjects randomized to rhEPO who 
transition from HD to PD will switch from epoetin alfa to darbepoetin alfa at their 
next study visit (from Week 4 onwards).  If this occurs from Week 52 onward, 
additional visits are required as outlined in Appendix 6.

Appendix 15 Country Specific Requirements; new Section 12.15.2  Country -Specific 
Requirements for the Czech Republic; addition of text relating to acceptable
contraceptive methods for the Czech Republic.
Purpose and Justification:
The purpose of this Czech Republic country -specific requirement is to specify  acceptable
contraceptive methods for use during participation in the study  200807. This is as a result 
of recent Czech Republi clegislative requirements of CA directive KLH 22 dated 
22Mar2016 for contraception methods.
Czech Republic Specific Contraception Requirements will apply  in addition to the list of 
methods stated in Appendix 5 :
Men and women able to have children and sexu ally active, must use acceptable methods 
of birth control from 30 day s prior to the first dose of randomized treatment and until 
completion of the Follow -up visit (4 -6 weeks after the end of randomized treatment).
Methods of birth control include, one high ly reliable method (such as intrauterine 
device, sterilisation of one of the partners, hormonal birth control methods) plus 
one supplementary  barrier method (such as condom, diaphragm) with a 
spermicide. 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L

12.15.3.2. List of Specific Changes
Cover page.  Added back protocol “Short Title”.
Short Title: Anemia Studies in CKD: Erythropoiesis via a Novel PHI  
Daprodustat -Dialysis (ASCEND -D)
Section 1. Protocol Synopsis for Study 200807; Overall Design, 1stbullet and Section 
12.1. Appendix 1: abbreviations.  Corrected ESA abbreviation. Revised analysis

148This is a randomized, open -label (sponsor blind), active -controlled, parallel -group, 
multi -center, event -driven study  in dialy sis subjects with anemia associated with 
CKD who are currently  treated with erythropoietin erythropoiesis -stimulating agents 
(ESAs1).
ESA Erthropoetin Erythropoiesis -stimulating agent
Section 1. Protocol Synopsis for Study 200807; Analysis 1st paragraph. Revised analysis 
provided.
The study ’s co -primary  endpoints will each be tested for non -inferiorit y using a one-
sided 2.5% significance level and the relevant confidence bound from a two -sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) (upper bound for MACE and lower bound for the Hgb co -
primary endpoint) for each test . 
Section 3 Objectives and Endpoints; safety endpoint.  Changed “s tudy treatment” to 
“randomized treatment” to more correctly describe endpoint.  
Safety 
To compare the safety and tolerability of 
daprodustat to rhEPOIncidence and severity of AEs and serious adverse 
events (SAEs) including AEs of special interest 1
Reasons for discontinuation of study randomized
treatment
Absolute values and changes from baseline in 
laboratory parameters, BP and heart rate (HR)
Section 4.1. Overall Design; 7thbullet. Clarified how stratification factors are considered 
prognosticall y important.
Subjects will be stratified by  dialysis type [HD*or PD], by  region (see Appendix 3 ), 
and by  participation in the ABPM sub -study . Dialy sis ty pe and region are considered 
to be stratification factors that are considered to be potentially  prognostic ally 
important, i.e., predictive of study  endpoints while participation in the ABPM sub -
study  is an administrative stratification factor intended solely  to ensure a similar 
number of sub -study  subjects in each of the two randomized groups.  
Section 4.5.2. Benefit Assessment; 1stparagraph. Clarifited other ESAs.
In clinical trials of up to 24 weeks in duration, in subjects with anemia associated with 
CKD, daprodustat has been shown to treat Hgb to target range. Daprodustat may  present 
several imp ortant advantages over rhEPO and other ESAs its analogs .  It is an oral 
medication and does not require cold -chain storage as does rhEPO, thus increasing ease 
of use for patients and health care providers. After administration of daprodustat, data 
suggest that the increases in Hgb are achieved with EPO exposure lower than those 
observed with rhEPO.  Treatment of anemia of CKD with rhEPO is associated with 
increased CV risk which is postulated to be related to the associated increases in EPO 
exposure with rh EPO [Szczech, 200]; therefore, daprodustat has the potential to raise 
Hgb without the same CV risk associated with rhEPO and its analogs .
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
149Section 5.1. Inclusion Criteria; inclusion #3. Added retest for Hgb values within the 
variability threshold for testin g to determine Week -8 eligibility, with associated footnote 
(inserted new footnote 2).
Hgb Range
Week -8 Hgb 8 to 12 g/dL 1(5 to 7. 45mmol/L). 
If Hgb is 12.1 to 12.4 g/dL 2(7.5-7.7 mmoL/L), up to two retests are allowed; the 
retest value must be between 8 to 11.5 g/dL (5 to 7.4 mmol/L).
Day 1Hgb 8 to 11 g/dL (5 to 6.8 mmol/L) andreceiving at least the minimum ESA dose 3.
Hgb >11 g/dL to 11.5 g/dL (6.8 mmol/L to 7.1 mmol/L) and receiving greater than 
the minimum ESA dose 3. 
1.Conversion from g/dL to g/L is 1:10, e.g., Hgb of 8 to 10 g/dL is equivalent to 80 -100g/L. 
2. The first retest will use the original Week -8 blood sample. If this value is >12 g/dL, one additional 
retest can be performed using a new blood sample on the study visit day.  The final retest value is 
entered into the IRT system.   For in -center HD, retes ts will be pre -dialysis, in between dialysis 
sessions for HHD subjects at the study visits, and at the study visits for PD subjects, as per 
standard of care.
3. Minimum ESA dose:  epoetins (including biosimilars):  1500 units (U)/week intravenous (IV) or 1000 
U/week SC; darbepoetin alfa:  20 g/4 weeks SC/IV; methoxy PEG -epoetin:  30 g/month SC/IV
Section 5.1. Inclusion Criteria; inclusion #5.  Updated frequenc y of dialysis descriptions.

Section 5.1. Inclusion Criteria; inclusion #7.  Clarified study visit this is confirmed.
7.Informed consent (screening only): capable of giving signed informed consent 
which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the 
consent form and in this protocol.
Section 5.2. Exclusion Criteria; exclusion #1.  Added “or living -unrelated ”. 
1. Kidney transplant: Planned living -related or living -unrelated kidney  transplant 
within 52 weeks after study  start (Day  1).
Section 5.2. Exclusion Criteria; exclusion #3. Added retest for TSAT values within the 
variability threshold for testing to determine Week -8 eligibility.  
3. Transferrin saturation (TSAT) (screening only):  ≤20%.  If TSAT is 18 -20%, then 
a retest using a new blood sample can be obtained within 7 days of the final 
laboratory report; the final retest value must be >20% to confirm eligibility .  
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
150Section 5.2. Exclusion Criteria; exclusion #5. Added Untreated.
5. Other causes of anemia:  Untreated pernicious anemia, thalassemia major, sickle cell 
disease or m yelod ysplastic sy ndrome.
Section 5.2 Exclusion Criteria; exclusion #11.  Clarified situation where exclusion does 
not apply.
11. QTcB (Day 1) : QTcB >500 msec, or QTcB >530 msec in subjects with bundle 
branch block.  There is no QTc exclusion for subjects with a predominantly  ventricular
paced rh ythm.
Section 5.2. Exclusion Criteria; exclusion #16. Broadened exclusion to include 
participation in a study with an investigational agent or device.
16. Prior inve stigational product exposure:  Use of an investigational agent ≤30 day s 
or within five half lives of the investigational agent (whichever is longer) prior to 
screening. Note: at screening, this exclusion applies to use of the investigational agent 
within 30 day s or within five half lives (whichever is longer). Other study 
participation:  Use of other investigational agent or device prior to screening 
through to randomization (Day 1) :
Note: at screening, this exclusion applies to use of the investigational agent 
within 30 days or within five half lives (whichever is longer).
Section 5.5. Permanent Discontinuation of Randomized Treatment; revised bullet and 
new text. Removed “chronic” from prohibited medication use stopping criterion and 
added text to clarif y that subjects may be reapproached about restarting randomized 
treatment.
Need for chronic ( more than 14 day s use )of prohibited medication (Section
6.10.2 )
Subjects may be reapproached about restarting randomized treatment in certain 
circumstances if the sponsor and the investigator agree.
Section 5.5.1. Procedures for Subject Follow -up; bullet 1.  Deleted second sentence in 
first bullet.
Early Treatment Disc ontinuation visit:  This visit should occur within 2 weeks of 
stopping randomized treatment. This visit supersedes the scheduled stud y visit if 
the Earl y Treatment Discontinuation visit falls on the same date as a scheduled 
study  visit. 
Section 6.1 Placeb o Run -in and Randomized Treatment. Added footnote that in 
unexpected circumstances where the supply to the site is interrupted, then local standard 
of care for anemia management during this time period may be considered.
The term ‘randomized treatment’ is used throughout the protocol to describe either study  
treatment (i.e., daprodustat or darbepoetin alfa) received b y the subject during the 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
151treatment period as per the protocol design .  Randomized treatment will be provided 
by GSK3.
3If the supply to the site is interrupted due to unexpected circumstances (e.g., natural disaster), local 
standard of care for anem ia management m ay be considered during that time period, without the 
need to withdraw the subject from  the study or to perm anently discontinue rand omized treatm ent.  
Section 6.1 Placebo Run -in and Randomized Treatment. Added new EU -sourced 
darbepoetin alfa PFS strengths.

Intravenous Epoetin in Maintenance Treatment of Anemia in Hemodialysis 
Patien ts. Am J of Kidney Dis 2002; 40:439-446.
Section 6.3.2. rhEPO Dosing Information.  Added clarity how to dose three times a week 
study rhEPO to a subject on HD two times a week. 
For subjects who are on HD two times a week and are randomized to the epoetin 
alfa arm andrequire three times a week epoetin alfa dosing, the weekly dose should 
be split as close to equally, using the study -allocated dose vials of epoetin alfa, across 
the two dialysis treatments.
Section 6.3.2. rhEPO Dosing Information; Tables 4 an d 5. Clarified “every week”

Section 6.3.3. Daprodustat and rhEPO Dose Adjustment Algorithm; 2ndparagraph and 
new text . Added clarifier around dispensing of randomized treatment from Week 52 
onwards and rationale for the possible adjustment to the Dose Adjustment Algorithm 
based on the review of blinded instream aggregate Hgb data .  
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
153From Week 52 onwards, additional study  visits to check Hgb and dispense ra ndomized 
treatment (where directed by the IRT system) will be required under the circumstances 
outlined in Appendix 6 .
In order to mitigate subjects remaining below the Hgb target range for an extended 
period of time, adjustments to the algorithm may be im plemented by the sponsor as 
outlined in Appendix 6 based on the review of blinded instream aggregate Hgb data.  
Section 6.3.4. Randomized Treatment Extended Interruption; new section.  Added 
direction regarding randomized treatment and study continuation for subjects who will 
be away from the research site for an extended period of time.
6.3.4. Randomized Treatment Temporary  Interruption
Every effort must be made to continue randomized treatment and to complete study 
visits, where able; however, sites shou ld contact PPD Remote Site Monitor -Local if a 
subject cannot return to the research site on a temporary basis for any one of the 
following situations:
Subjects who are hospitalized for any duration. 
HD or PD subjects receiving oral daprodustat or PD subjects receiving SC 
darbepoetin alfa who cannot return to the site for a period >5 weeks.
HD subjects receiving IV rhEPO who cannot return to the site in time for the 
next scheduled dose. 
In exceptional circumstances, local standard of care for anemia m anagement during 
this time period may be considered based on consultation with the PPD Medical 
Monitor .  If non -study ESAs are administered, doses should be recorded on the 
Prior/Concomitant Medications –ESA eCRF page.    
Section 6.10.2. Prohibited Medications and Non -Drug Therapies; new text.  Added 
clarification that no other investigational agents or devices are permitted during the 
study.
No other investigational agents or devices are permitted from study entry through 
completion of the study, wi th the exception of the randomized treatment 
administered for this study .
Section 6.11.1. Iron Management Criteria; paragraph 1.  Added clarifier for when the 
criteria start and stop.
The investigator will follow the iron management criteria from randomiza tion (Day 
1) through the end of the study treatment period for subjects receiving randomized 
treatment.
Section 6.12. Rescue Criteria; paragraph 2. Minor clarification in wording to match 
wording in IRT system.
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
154This rescue algorithm does not apply  to subje cts with a decrease in low Hgb as a result of 
an acute or subacute event with an identifiable cause (e.g., GI bleed, blood loss due to 
surgery  or vascular access).   
Section 6.12. Rescue Criteria; Table 6. Minor clarification for visits where rescue 
evaluation can be triggered and in title of Table 6.
Table 14 Rescue Algorithm for Anemia Therapy Management
Evaluate Subject for Rescue if:  
HemoCue Hgb remains <9 g/dL (at a scheduled study visit , Week 4 onwards )despite three 1consecutive 
dose increases above the starting 2or post -rescue 3dose (where HemoCue Hgb is <9 g/dL prior to each 
dose increase) OR HemoCue Hgb is <7.5 g/dL despite a dose increase at the prior study visit.
Section 6.12. Rescue Criteria; footnote s.  Inserte dnew footnote #2to clarify baseline 
dose for the purposes of the rescue algorithm for subjects switching from HD to PD who 
are randomized to rhEPO   and made a minor change in #3 (previously #2) .
2.For subjects who have switched from HD to PD who are randomized to rhEPO, the baseline dose for the purposes of 
the rescue algorithm is the new darbepoetin alfa dose. .
3.For subjects who previously arewere evaluated for rescue and who are able to continue in the trial, “post -rescue” 
dose is the dose of rando mized treatment that a subject is receiving at the study visit after initial intervention.
Section 6.13. Subjects Changing Dialysis Modality; 1stsentence. Clarification added on 
randomized treatment to receive if switching dialysis modality. 
Subjects changing dialy sis modality  should not be withdrawn from the study , and 
should willcontinue in onthe same randomized treatment arm (daprodustat or rhEPO)
they were originally assigned .
Section 7. Study Assessments and Procedures; 1stand 2ndbullets. Clarified valid study 
visit days.
For subjects on 3 -5x/week HD, the designated study  visit must not occur on the 
first dialy sis session of the week, i.e., immediately following the longest 
interval between HD sessions .  For example, if on a Monda y-Wednesday -Friday  
schedule, the stud y visit should be on Wednesday or Friday.
For subjects on PD or home HD , study  visits can occur on an y day of the week. 
Section 7. Study Assessments and Procedures; new paragraph.  Inserted new text to 
clarify the visit schedule for study visits through Day 1.  
The Week -4 and Day 1 visits should be completed 4 weeks ±1 week after the last 
visit; however, the total duratio n of the Screening and Run -In periods (from Week -
8 to Day 1) should be 8 weeks ±1 week (i.e., 7 -9 weeks).  
Section 7. Study Assessments and Procedures; paragraphs after bullets.  Inserted new 
text to state the revised visit window for the W eek 2 and 4 vi sits and made minor changes 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
155to visit structure a separate paragraph as it applies to all study visits and corrected 
spelling of center.
The visit window for those on randomized treatment for the Week 2 and Week 4 
visits is ±3 days.  The visit window specif ied for those on randomized treatment from 
Week 8 onwards is ±1 week .
In exceptional circumstances, minor changes to visit structure may  be permitted after 
consultation with the PPD Medical Monitor.
Study  assessments should preferabl y be done at dialy sis centers; however, in some 
circumstances (i.e., where the dial ysis centre center and research site are not co -located) 
assessments can be performed at the research site.

Section 7.7. Patient Reported Outcomes; new text in 2ndparagraph. Added provision for 
sponsor discussion if PRO assessments cannot be conducted.
All questionnaires used in this study  have been translated and culturall y adapted for use 
in local country  languages and will be administered electronically  only.  Specific 
instructions on how the subject is to complete the scales and the process for data entry  is 
provided in the SRM.  If there are exceptional circumstances whereby the electronic 
PRO assessments cannot be conducted, the completion of these assessments will be 
discussed with the sponsor on a case -by-case basis.
Section 7.7.3. Health Status ( EQ-5D-5L &  EQ-VAS); paragraph 2. Updated endpoint 
labels.
The EQ VAS records the respondent’s self -rated health on a vertical, visual analogue 
scale where the endpoints are labeled ‘ the best health you can imagine best imaginable 
health state ’ and ‘ the wors t health you can imagine worst imaginable health state ’. This 
information is used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by  individual 
subjects.
Section 9. Statistical Considerations and Data Analyses; paragraph after table. Change 
from two -sided testing at the 5% level to one -sided testing at the 2.5% level.
The co -primary  endpoints will each be tested using a one-sided 2. 5% significance level 
and the relevant confidence bound of the a two-sided 95% CI  (upper bound for 
MACE and lower bound for the Hgb co -primary endpoint) . The ty pe I error rate will 
be strictly  controlled at the one-sided 2.5% level across the co -primary  analy ses as both 
non-inferiorit y tests need to be met for the trial to be considered successful and for 
statistical analy sis to proceed to evaluate MACE superiority  and superiorit y for the 
principal secondary  objectives/endpoints.

167Section 9.1.1. CV Safety (MACE) Co -Primary Hypothesis; last paragraph. Added two -
sided to 95% CIs .
Statistical significance of non -inferiorit y wil l be assessed at the twoone-sided 2.5% level.  
A Cox -Proportional -Hazards -Regression model, adjusting for treatment and prognostic 
randomization stratification factors (region and current ESA use), will be used to estimate 
the hazard -ratio, its two-sided 95% CI  and to generate the p -value for the non -inferiorit y 
test. Non -inferiorit y will be achieved if the upper limit of the two -sided 95% CI  is below 
the margin of 1.20.
Section 9.1.2. Hgb efficacy Co -Primary Hypothesis; 3rdparagraph. Changed to one -
sided 2.5% level and added two -sided to 95% CI.
Statistical significance of non -inferiorit y will be assessed at the twoone-sided 2.5% level. 
An ANCOVA model including prognostic randomization stratification factors (dial ysis 
typeand region), baseline Hgb and treatment will be used to obtain a point estimate and 
the two-sided 95% CI  for the treatment difference (daprodustat -rhEPO) and generate the 
p-value for the non -inferiority  test
Section 9.2.1. Sample Size Assumptions; paragr aph after bullets. Changed to one -sided 
2.5% level and added two -sided to 95% CI.
The target of 945 adjudicated first MACE will permit a two-sided 95% CI  of (0.880, 
1.136) to describe the results for an observed hazard ratio of 1. The largest hazard ratio 
point estimate ( two-sided 95% CI ) that would meet the statistical criterion for non -
inferiority  is 1.056 (0.930, 1.200) and for superiority , the minimum observable effect 
would be a 12% relative risk reduction in favor of daprodustat, corresponding to a ha zard 
ratio of 0.880. 
Conditional on both co -primary  endpoints achieving non -inferiorit y at the one-sided 
2.5% level, statistical testing will progress to evaluate MACE and the principal secondary  
endpoints for superiorit y.
Section 9.2.2. Sample Size Sensitivity; 1stparagraph. Corrected referencing.
The estimated (base case) 15% annual rhEPO MACE rate is based on a review of 
randomized clinical trials in dialy sis (peginesatide EMERAL D studies [Macdougall, 
2013] and NHS study  [Besarab, 1998]), observat ional data in dial ysis patients ( GSK 
report from the Dial ysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) [DOPPS, 2014]
and the USRDS 2013 annual report [USRDS, 2013] ) and considering the planned 
regional distribution for recruitment. 
Section 9.2.2. Sampl e Size Sensitivity; last paragraph. Added two -sided to 95% CI.
The planned stud y size far exceeds this requirement and provides more than 99% power 
for non -inferiority  and a high level of precision to estimate the treatment effect ( two-
sided 95% CI  half width of 0.128 g/dL, assuming 30% of subjects will be non -evaluable 
for efficacy ). The largest (most negative) difference between arms that would meet the 
statistical criterion for non -inferiorit y would be -0.622 g/dL. If the two-sided 95% CI  is 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
168completely  negative (i.e. lies fully  within the range -0.75 to <0g/dL) non -inferiorit y 
would still be concluded.
Section 9.2.3. Sample Size Re -estimation or Adjustment; last sentence. Minor revisions.
GSK and the Executive Steering Committee will review blinded data periodically  during 
the course of the study  and should emerging data suggest that the overall event rate 
and/or the enrollment rate (main study or sub -studies) diverges significantly  from 
protocol assumptions either the sample size required to achieve the event targ et and/or 
the requirement forwith a minimum of one y ear follow -up may  be adjusted.    
Section 9.4.1.1. Primary CV Safety Analysis (co -primary); 1stparagraph. Clarified two -
sided 95% CI and one -sided p -value.
The statistical model is a Cox Proportional Hazards regression model, adjusting for 
treatment and the prognostic randomization stratification factors (dial ysis type and 
region), to estimate the hazard ratio, two-sided 95% CI  and one-sided p-value for the 
statistical non -inferio rity test. Non -inferiorit y will be established if the upper limit of the

95% CI and one -sided p -value.
The ANCOVA model will include prognostic randomization stratification factors 
(dialy sis type and region), baseline hemoglobin and treatment. It will provide a point 
estimate and two-sided 95% CI  forthe treatment effect together with the one-sided non-

Section 9.4.2.1. Principal Secondary Analyses; paragraphs 1 through 2.  Revised to on e-
sided 2.5% level, statistical section, revised hypotheses to be tested, and changed 
darbe poetin alfa to rhEPO.
Conditional on the co -primary  endpoints achieving at least non -inferiority  at the twoone-
sided 2.5% level, statistical testing will progress to superiority  for MACE and the 
principal secondary  endpoints.  The hy potheses to be tested f or these endpoints are as 
follows: 
Null: daprodustat is equal not superior to rhEPO darbepoetin alfa (i.e. the 
hazard ratio is greater than or equal to 1.0 for time -to-event endpoints, or the 
mean difference is greater than or equal to 0 for continuous en dpoints)
Alternative: daprodustat is not equal superior to rhEPO darbepoetin alfa (i.e. the 
hazard ratio is not equal less than to1.0 for time -to-event endpoints, or the mean 
difference is not equal less than l to 0 for continuous endpoints)
These tests will be multiplicity  adjusted based on a family -wise Ty pe I error rate set at 
the twoone-sided 2.5% level, see Section 9.4.3 for further details.

Section 9.4.4. Covariates and Subgroups of Interest; paragraph 2. Revised sentence to 
more complete describe adjustments to statistical model.
Statistical models will be adjusted for the covariates used in the original analysis,
subgroup, treatment and treatment b y subgroup interaction. Point estimates and two-

treatment interaction p -value calculated.
Section 9.4.4. Covariates and Subgroups of Interest; paragraphs 3 -5. Updated 
hyporesponder analyses.
rhEPO hyporesponder subgroup definition:   rhEPO hy poresponders will be identified 
either by the ESA Resistance Index (ERI) [HERO study, Johnson , 2015] or by  treatment 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
170at baseline with a very  high dose of IV epoetin alpha.  For each subject, baseline ERI  will 
be calculated as the dryweight adjusted weekl ymean ESA dose during the 8 week 
screening period divided by  baseline Hgb concentration. Subjects with baseline ERI  
≥2U/kg/wk/g/L for epoetin -treated subjects; ≥0.008 g/kg/wk/g/L for darbepoetin -
treated subjects and ≥0.01 g/kg/wk/g/L for methoxy -PEG -epoetin -treated subjects will 
be included in the pre -specified subgroup. In addition, subjects will be included if being 
treated at baseline with greater than or equal to the equivalent of 450 U/kg/week of IV 
epoetin alpha. This latter criterion covers subjects at higher bod y weight for which the 
ERI calculation is less accurate and is based on the NICE anemia guidelines of June 2015 
[NICE, 2015].  Sensitivity analyses will explore alternative subgroup definitions: an 
ERI cut-point of ≥1.5 (or equivalent depending on ESA treatment) or using baseline 
prior rhEPO dose above the top 20thpercentile for the study population.
rhEPO hyporesponder subgroup analysis plan:   It is anticipated that approximately  
10-15% of subjects may  be classified as rhEPO hy poresponders acco rding to this 
definition, thus resulting in a subgroup size of potentially  300-450 subjects. The subgroup 
efficacy  anal ysis will follow the same structure as that defined for the full study , 
assessing the comparative treatment effect in mean Hgb change bet ween baseline and EP 
in subjects regardless of adherence to study treatment as well as in subjects who 
adhere to randomized treatment and using the same non -inferiority  margin of -0.75 g/dL. 
For at least 90% power to demonstrate non -inferiority , 86 evaluab le rhEPO 
hyporesponders are required per arm.  The statistical model (ANCOVA) will include 
terms for prognostic randomization stratification factors, baseline Hgb, treatment, 
hyporesponder subgroup and treatment by  subgroup interaction. Point estimates and two-
sided 95% CI s will be generated to describe the treatment effect separately for rhEPO 
hyporesponders and the complement set of rhEPO non -hyporesponders; non -inferiorit y 
would be established if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI  is greater than -0.75 
g/dL. In addition, a nominal one -sided non -inferiority p -value and a nominal one -
sided superiority p -value for the difference between the two groups will be 
generated.   If non -inferiority  is met for rhEPO hyporesponders, the anal ysis would 
proceed to determine whether daprodustat is more effective at achieving Hgb target levels 
compared to rhEPO with superiority  established if the lower limit of the 95% CI  exceeds 
0 g/dL. Sensitivity  analy ses will explore alternative subgroup definitions either b y raising 
the ERI  cut-points to ≥2.5 and ≥3.0 (or equivalent depending on ESA treatment) or using 
baseline prior rhEPO dose above the top 20thpercentile for the stud y population.
A formal comparative assessment of CV risk in this subgroup is not prospectively  
planned because, given the sample size, While it is unlikely , given the sample size, that 
a sufficient number of adjudicated first MACE will occur to support a robust model -
based anal ysis, subgroup analyses are planned for the co -primary MACE and 
principal secondary CV endpoints. The statistical analysis model (Cox Proportional 
Hazards) will include terms for prognostic randomization stratification factors, 
treatment, hyporespo nder subgroup and treatment by subgroup interaction. Point 
estimates and two -sided 95% CIs for the hazard ratio will be generated to describe 
the treatment effect separately for rhEPO hyporesponders and the complement set 
of rhEPO non -hyporesponders; non -inferiority would be established if the upper 
limit of the two -sided 95% CI is less than 1.20.  At a minimum, the incidence of

Summary  statis tics for baseline characteristics and dosing experience will be generated 
and exploratory  anal yses conducted for secondary  endpoints associated with Hgb, iron 
utilization, rescue (including transfusion), BP, s ymptoms and HR -QoL.
Section 9.4.5. Interim Analysis; 2ndparagraph. Added additional point for IDMC 
considerations regarding futility.
In addition to MACE, any decisions regarding futility  will take into account data related 
to: 1) components of MACE, 2) endpoints describing BP, 3) efficacy  in rhEP O 
hyporesponders, 4) other safet y and efficacy data across the daprodustat clinical program ,
and5) emerging data in the public domain pertaining to safety  or efficacy  of HIF -prolyl 
hydroxylase inhibitors, and 6) any other data considered to be relevant by the IDMC .  
The IDMC will make a recommendation to GSK and the ESC chair as outlined in the 
IDMC charter regarding whether the stud y should continue unchanged, be modified or 
be terminated.

Daprodustat 
Excessive erythropoiesis (polycythemia) leading to 
thrombosis and/or tissue ischemiaIn animal studies, excessive erythropoiesis attributed to daprodustat 
was associated with vascular congestion /inflammation , microthrombi, 
and tissue ischemia in a number of organs.
Following review of clinical data received to date, this has not been 
identified as a safety concern for daprodustat.
Phase 2 dose -ranging studies, and associated statistical and expos ure

Esophageal and gastric erosionsIn animal studies, undesirable GI effects including emesis, abnormal 
feces and/or decreased food consu mption/body weight loss and 
stomach erosions/ ulcers with hemorrhage were observed with 
daprodustat.  
In rodents rats,stomach erosions were observed with intravenous and 
oral administration of daprodustat.
Stomach erosions/ulcers also reported in rats with some 
marketed rhEPO/ and its analogs .Gender -averaged systemic 
exposure (AUC) at the no observed adverse effect levels (NOAEL) are 
3.3 -fold (monkeys) and 737 -fold (rats) above human exposure (25 
mg daprodustat).
In clinical trials to date with daprod ustat, mild -moderate GI signs and 
symptoms represent the most frequently reported adverse event, 
however causal association has not been established.
Following review of clinical data received to date, GI erosions have not 
been identified as a safety conce rn for daprodustat. Suspected GI bleeding or significant

In studies up to 4 weeks duration, a dose -ordered increase in
VEGF plasma concentrations was observed at doses ranging 
from 10 to 150 mg. 
In studies up to 24 weeks duration at doses up to 25mg, 
changes in VEGF plasma concentration were variable but 
similar relative to control.
Systemic EPO concentrations within the physiologic range.
Three times weekly administration:
In studies up to 4 weeks duration at doses of 10 to 30 mg:
oDose dependent increases in plasma VEGF and 
EPO concentrations were observed.
oPre-dose concentrations of EPO and VEGF were 
near or below basel ine indicating no accumulation 
of EPO or VEGF after three times weekly dosing.
Following review of clinical data received to date, this has not been 
identified as a safety concern for daprodustat. 
Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH)A role for HIF -regulated pathways in the pathophysiology of PAH has 
been suggested based on well established effects of acute and chronic 
hypoxia in man on the pulmonary vasculature (vasoconstriction), and 
by findings in patients with naturally occurring mutations that result in 
decreased HIF degradation [ Smith , 2006; Formenti , 2011].
There have been no histopathologic findings suggestive of PAH in pre -

Acute hypoxic challenge (rats):   Daprodustat produced increases in 
peak right ventricular pressure (PRVP) during acute hypoxia that were 
slightly higher than the vehicle control group. However, Tthese
hypoxia -induced PRVP changes fallwere within the range of PRVP 
differences changes noted among non-untreated rats.
Results from a clinical study of acute hypoxic challenge in healthy 
volunteers demonstrated that short -term (5 days) therapy with 
daprodustat 5mg or 100mg has no clinically significant effect on 
transthoracic echocardiographic ally(ECHO) estimate sdof systolic
pulmonary artery systolic pressure ( sPASP) under either normoxic or 
hypoxic conditions.
ECHO assessments performed in Phase 2b studies (24 weeks 
treatment duration) did not identify any clinically meaningful changes in 
PASP sPAP in subjects not on dialysis for daprodustat. In hemodialysis 
subjects, mean absolute change from baseline in sPAP PASPwas 
similar for both treatment groups; however, there was a numeric 
imbalance (Daprodustat: 8 [7%]; Control 0) in subjects reaching the 
sPAP PASP PCI (>20 mmHg increase from baseline). Regarding this 
imbalance, there were a number of confounding factors i n the study, 
most notably a 4.5:1 randomization scheme and inconsistency in 
timing of ECHOs relative to dialysis day.  Additionally, 2 of 3 subjects 
with resolution of sPAP PASP on safety follow -up ECHOs had 
confounding conditions that could contribute to resolution other than 
discontinuation of study treatment; and there was no dose relationship 
for subjects meeting the sPAP PASP PCI criterion. Overall, there is 
insufficient evide nce to conclude a relationship to treatment with 
daprodustat .

specific model and experimental conditions utilized.
With lifetime exposure to daprodustat in a 2 -year rat oral 
carcinogenicity study, an exacerbation of rat spontaneous, 
progressive cardiomyopathy (PCM)(focal myofiber 
degeneration/necrosis with inflammatory infiltrates) was
observed at doses of 0.8 mg/kg/day and above, although total 
incidence and severity distribution within any daprodustat -group 
were within historical control ranges.  This is consistent with an 
equivocal threshold for exacerbation of spontaneous, 
progressi ve cardiomyopathy at 0.8 mg/kg/day which is also the 
threshold dose for observing increased Hct values in individual 
rats. Small increases in cardiac troponin in 6 month rat study with 
daprodustat were consistent with the background finding of 
spontaneous rodent cardiomyopathy.  There were no elevations 
observed in cardiac troponin in 9 month monkey study with 
daprodustat
Cardiomyopathy has not been associated with naturally occurring 
mutation in man which results in increased HIF stabilization .

Drug-drug interactions Daprodustat is a substrate of CYP2C8 :  Co-administration of 
daprodustat with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor (gemfibrozil) increased 
the Cmax and AUC of daprodustat, 4 -and 19 -fold, respectively, while 
co-administration of a weak inhibitor (trimethoprim) increased the 
Cmax and AUC of daprodustat by 1.3 -and 1.5 -fold, respectively. 
Population PK analysis from completed Phase 2 studies suggests that 
co-administration of daprodustat with a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor 
(clopidogrel) , leads to a ~ 2 -fold increase in AUC, with no cli nically -
significant increase in the measured Hgb response. Although 
CYP2C8 induction studies were not performed, co -administration 
of daprodustat with an inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., 
rifampin/rifampicin) may decrease the exposure of daprodustat.
Even though co-administration of daprodustat with strong 
inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C8 is prohibited, inadvertent co -
administration may occur. Due to the known time delay in 
enhancing erythropoiesis by daprodustat, co -administration with 
strong CYP2C8 inhibitors f or up to 14 days is not anticipated to 
lead to immediate marked increases in hemoglobin levels. 
Therefore, there is adequate time to change to alternate therapy 
that does not inhibit CYP2C8.
Additionally, as the time for maximum induction of CYP2C8 
occurs after approximately 10 -14 days of dosing with rifampin 
(Brodie, 2013 and Ohnhaus, 1989), daprodustat systemic 
exposure will decrease over time which will result in a lag period 
before an effect on Hgb is recognized and is of clinical concern.
Daprodustat i s an inhibitor of CYP2C8 :in vitro, with an IC 50value of 21 
µM.  A clinical drug interaction study between 25mg and 100mg 
daprodustat with a CYP2C8 substrate (i.e., pioglitazone) showed

significant increase in the measured Hgb response. Co-administration 
of daprodustat with moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (i.e., clopidogrel, 
teriflunomide, deferasirox) should be performed with caution .
Co-administration of daprodustat with potent BCRP inhibitors has the 
potential to increase exposure of dapro dustat. Use of BCRP inhibitors 
(mostly weak) was found to result in a small change in metabolite 
exposure (20% increase in AUC).
Daprodustat is a substrate of BCRP : Population PK analysis from 
Phase 2 studies suggested that while BCRP inhibitors were a 
covariate for daprodustat CL/F (8.6% lower clearance) the 
predicted change in exposure was not considered to be of clinical 
relevance.  
Daprodustat is an inhibitor o f OATP1B1/1B3 : in vitro, with IC 50values 
of 6 µM and 11 µM, respectively. A clinical drug interaction study 
between 25mg and 100mg daprodustat with either a CYP2C8 
substrate or an OATP1B1/1B3 substrate (rosuvastatin) showed that 
there is no PK interaction at th esedose sof daprodustat.

prior to Amendment 2 .
Study  Design
This is a multicenter sub -study  of the main ASCEND -D study .  Subjects who qualify  for 
the main study  will be assessed for enrolment.  Approximately  300136subjects from 60-
90 centers in selected countries that are participating in the main study  will be 
randomized.  
Note: if the target number of randomized subjects in the ABPM sub -study is not 
achieved when the main study is fully enrolled, recruitment may be extended t o 
allow randomization in the ABPM sub -study to complete. Home BP monitoring will 
be done to establish baseline eligibility  for subject participation and will continue through 
to Week 28 study  visits.
ABPM Quality  Control Criteria
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
187Subjects will need to wear the ABPM device for two 24-hour sessions during the stud y: 
at a mid -week dialysis visit starting at Week -4 until 1 week at Day  -14prior to 
randomization (baseline ABPM) and then at Week 2816.  The ABPM device will be 
placed afte r assessments for the main study  have been completed. ABPM Quality  Control 
(QC) criteria as defined in the Project Requirement Specification (PRS) for ABPM must 
be met.
Subjects will be expected to wear the ABPM device twice for 4424hours ateach session.  
The ABPM device will measure BP and pulse heart rate every  30 minutes during both 
awake and asleep hours.  The times the subject awakens and goes to sleep during this 
4424hour period will be recorded.
For each session the ABPM Quality Contr ol (QC) criteria as defined in the Project 
Requirement Specification (PRS) for ABPM must be met.  If these criteria are not 
met the ABPM may be repeated (see Section 12.12.3.3 ).

Monday , Wednesday , Friday ).
Study  Assessments
Week -48Study  Visit:
Subject’s consent for ABPM is obtained (Note: if missed this may be obtained at 
Week -4 prior to ABPM assessments).  
Week -4 Study Visit:
After the Week -4 main study  assessments are completed and consent for participation in 
this ABPM sub -study  is obtained, the subject wil l be given the home BP monitor and 
instructed on its use.  Between Week -4 and Week -3, the subject must become familiar 
with obtaining twice daily home BP readings.  Specific directions for measuring home 
BP will be provided in the SRM. 
Screening Home Blood Pressure Monitoring
Starting at Day  -21, the subject will obtain twice daily  home BP readings for 4 
consecutive day s; initiation of home BP measurements will be on a mid -week dial ysis 
day.  For example, subjects on a Monday , Wednesday , Friday  dialy sis schedule, the first 
home BP recording must be obtained on a Wednesday  morning.  For subjects on a 
Tuesday , Thursday  and Saturday  dialysis schedule, the first home BP reading must be 
obtained on Thursday  morning.  Home BP results will be transmitted to th e study  center 
in real -time.  Home BP readings should be obtained in the morning and evening (ideall y 
spaced at least 8 hours apart), at least 1 hour after eating and not within 1 hour of 
awakening.  These readings will establish BP eligibility  for ABPM pa rticipation
Day -14 Study Visit: This clinic visit will be used to initiate aA baseline ABPM reading
(prior to randomization and first dose of study medication) andmust occur at the be 
initiated at a mid -week dialysis visit and may be performed following completion of 
the Week -4 study assessments or at a subsequent mid-week dial ysis visit provided it 
occurs at least 1 week prior to randomization. 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
189Post-dialy sis and prior to ABPM, su bjects will be assessed for the presence of atrial 
fibrillation/flutter as follows: subjects with an irregular heart beat detected during 
heart rate measurement will undergo an ECG and those with documented atrial 
fibrillation or atrial flutter will not be eligible for ABPM. 
tThe ABPM device will be placed on the arm opposite current vascular access, and will 
be removed by study  personnel at the next dialy sis session (i.e., Day  12)by the subject at 
home after a minimum of , after 44 24 hours of wear ; the device will be returned to 
the research staff at the next visit ,which ideall y is no later than 1 week prior to 
randomization to allow for QC of the ABPM . See SRM for guidance on placement of 
ABPM device.
If the subject fails to meet the baseline ABPM QC c riteria and agrees to repeat the 
ABPM procedure, then:
The baseline ABPM procedure can be repeated at the next mid -week dialysis 
visit. Note: the atrial fibrillation/flutter assessment should be repeated prior to 
device placement.
Day 1 (randomization) may be delayed.
If the baseline ABPM fails the QC criteria after three attempts, then the 
subject will not be enrolled in this ABPM sub -study.
Subjects will have their body  weight measured and recorded in the eCRF both pre -and 
post-dialy sis (see SRM for guid ance on bod y weight measurement).
Day 1(rRandomization /next mid -week dialysis visit ):
If the ABPM measurements meet the QC criteria, the subject can be randomized.
If the subject fails to meet the baseline ABPM -QC criteria and agrees to repeat the 
ABPM procedure, then:
The baseline ABPM procedure can be repeated once at the next mid -week dialy sis 
visit.
Day 1 (randomization) may  be delay ed.
If the baseline ABPM fails the QC criteria a second time, then the subject will not 
be enrolled in this ABPM sub -study.
Subjects who either do not qualify  for entry  into the ABPM sub -study  after failing QC 
criteria a second third time or who do not desire to continue in the ABPM sub -study  
although they  pass the QC criteria, should continue with randomization into the ma in 
study  following the schedule of assessments as outlined in Table 7 of the main protocol if 
appropriate.
Week 4 through Week 28 Study Visits ( Home BP Monitoring Continues)
Subjects should obtain home BP readings for the four day s prior to each study  visit
between Week 4 and Week 28 as outlined in the SRM.
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
190Week 2816 Study Visit :
At the end of the main study  Hgb stabilization period (i.e., at Week 2816, at the mid -week 
dialy sis visit and after all main study  assessments have been completed, the subject’s pre-
and post -dialy sis weight will be measured and the EDW will be recorded .  
The ABPM device will be placed on the subject’s arm by site personnel and the subject 
will wear the device for 44 hours until the next dialy sis session .  After a minimum of 24 
hours of wear, the device will be removed by the subject at home and returned to 
the research staff at the next visit.   The time and date of stud y medication 
administration, before and while wearing the ABPM device, will be recorded.
If the ABPM fails the Q C criteria (same as baseline), up to two additional attempts may  
be made inat subsequent, mid -week dial ysis visits.  No further attempts are allowed.  
The subject will continue study  visits in the main study  as scheduled.
Permanent Discontinuation of Rand omized Treatment
A subject who permanently discontinues randomized treatment prior to completing 
the ABPM sub -study should remain in the sub -study and complete the Week 16 
ABPM assessment unless consent to participate in the ABPM sub -study is 
withdrawn (see also Section 5.5).
Estimated Dry  Weight and Antihy pertensive Medication Changes
It is preferred that no changes are made to EDW and antihy pertensive medications while 
the subject is part of the sub -study .  
If changes in EDW and/or antihy pertensive medications are necessary , these must be 
documented in the eCRF along with the reasons.  Subjects will remain in the sub -study  
regardless of an y changes.
Withdrawal from ABPM Sub -Study
If a subject participating in this sub -study  withdraws from the sub -study, the reason for 
the withdrawal must be recorded in the eCRF. The subject will remain in the main study  
unless the subject withdraws consent from the main study .
Sample Size and Power Calculations
The sample size of this sub -study  has been designed base d on the primary  sub-study  
objective to demonstrate superiority  in average SBP change from baseline to end of 
sub-study between arms (daprodustat versus rhEPO), measured b y ABPM over a 4424
hour assessment period.  Assuming a one-sided 2. 5% significance le vel, a true standard 
deviation for SBP change from baseline measured by  ABPM of 11 mmHg [ Peixoto , 
2000], and up to a 3020% withdrawal rate from the sub -study , a sample size of 14868
subjects per group ( 296136subjects in total) will provide greater than 9080% power to 
detect a -56mmHg difference in treatment groups (i.e., achieve superiority ).  Under these 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
191assumptions, superiority  will be established if there is more than a 34.2mmHg mean 
difference observed in favor of daprodustat.
Assuming a 2040% screen failure rate for the additional ABPM entry  criteria, 
approximately  370228subjects that are eligible for the main study  will need to be 
screened for the sub -study  in order to randomize approximately 296136subjects . See 
Section 9.2.3 for more information about sample size adjustments.
Unblinded ABPM data will be reviewed b y the IDMC during the conduct of the trial as 
part of their data monitoring responsibilities. No formal interim anal ysis is planned.
Statistical Analy sis
The primary  sub-study  estimand is to compare the treatment effect on change from 
baseline in 4424hour average SBP at Week 28end of sub -study , in all randomized sub -
study  subjects.  The statistical model for anal ysis will be an ANCOVA with terms for 
treatment and baseline 4424hour averag e SBP.  This model will provide a point estimate 
and two -sided 95% CI for the treatment effect and a one-sided p-value for the superiorit y 
assessment.  Superiority  will be established if the p -value is <0.0 25.  The primary  
analysis population will be the A BPM sub -study -ITT population defined as randomized 
subjects who were also entered into the ABPM sub -study .
Given the nature of ABPM measurement, a high degree of dropout unrelated to 
randomized treatment is anticipated.  The potential high level of missing data poses a 
challenge in the interpretation of the primary  ABPM sub -study  analy sis.  The reason for 
missing ABPM data will be examined to explore the impact of missing data on the sub -
study  primary  efficacy  conclusions.  I f the majority  (defined as >70%) of the missing 
data is due to either subject unwillingness to repeat the ABPM procedure or due to an un -
evaluable reading, then data will be treated as missing at random and the primary anal ysis 
will be considered sufficient.  Otherwise, a sensitivity  analysis may  be performed that 
will use multiple imputation from the active control arm to replace data from both 
treatment groups that was missing due to reasons other than subject unwillingness or un -
evaluable readings.  Further sensitivity supplementary analyses may  include an ABPM 
per-protocol population (PP) analy sis, utilizing all ABPM -ITT subjects who are not 
major protocol violators or who did not change BP medications during the sub -study .  
Further details of sensitivity  and supplementary analyses will be described in the RAP.
In order to contextualise the primary  between -group comparison, a key  secondary  
objective is to assess within -group changes from baseline over 28weeks the sub -study .  
Assessment of within -group changes will support interpretation of the primary  anal ysis 
by identify ing whether there was an absence of an increase in BP in one or both treatment 
groups.  To that end, two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for change 
from baseline in each ABPM parameter separatel y for each treatment group.  For either 
treatment group, a lack of adverse effect on the primary  endpoint of average SBP at and 
of sub -study Week 28 will be concluded if the upper 95% confidence limi t is no more 
than 4 mmHg.  This margin was chosen as it is less than the clinically  meaningful change 
of 5 mmHg [ Whelton , 2002] and it is half the historical increase in SBP observed with 
rhEPO [ Krapf , 2009].
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
192The mean and two-sided 95% CI  will be estimated from the primary  statistical model for 
within treatment arm SBP change from Bbaseline to Week 28 end of sub -study .
The change from baseline 4424hour average DBP, mean arterial pressure and pulse heart 
rate at Week 28 end of sub -study will be assessed in a similar way  as the primary , using 
analogous ANCOVA models with treatment and baseline as covariates.
The differences in proportion of subjects that increase/decrease their BP medication 
(number or dose) will be assessed using Fisher’s Exact Test.  The dif ferences between 
treatment groups in the proportion of subjects that convert from dippers/non -dippers at 
baseline to non -dippers/dippers at Week 28 end of sub -study will also be assessed using 
Fisher’s Exact Test.

Revised MACE NI margin in order to align the NI margin with similar studies that 
have alread y compared the effects of HIF -PHIs on MACE versus rhEPO.
Revised target MACE as a result of the change to the non -inferiority  margin.
Updated the anal ysis of the hemoglobin co -primary  endpoint based on FDA feedback.
Updated terminology  (i.e., use of ‘supportive’) to be consistent with I CH-E9 
addend um.
Multiplicity  adjustment strategy  updated from Hommel to Holm -Bonferroni based on 
FDA feedback.
Added AESI of worsening of h ypertension to footnote (included in IB, version 10).
Edited Risk Assessment information to include worsening of hy pertension .
Updated pregnancy  reporting timelines to align with revised Sponsor timings.
12.15.4.2. List of Specific Changes
Section 1. Overall Design, Revised MACE NI margin in order to align the NI margin with 
similar studies that have already compared the effects of HIF -PHIs on MACE versus 
rhEPO .
The total duration of the study  is dependent upon the accumulation of 945664
adjudicated first MACE (i.e., it is event -driven) unless review of interim data by  the 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommends bringing the study  to 
an earlier close.
Section 1. Analysis, Revised MACE NI margin in order to align the NI mar gin with 
similar studies that have already compared the effects of HIF -PHIs on MACE versus 
rhEPO .
For CV safet y, the primary question is whether daprodustat is non -inferior to rhEPO for 
adjudicated MACE. An Intent -to-Treat (ITT) analy sis of time to the fir st occurrence of 
adjudicated MACE using a margin of 1. 2025and a Cox Proportional Hazards regression 
model adjusting for treatment and prognostic randomization stratification factors (dial ysis 
type and region), will be used. 
For Hgb efficacy , the primary  question is whether daprodustat is non -inferior to rhEPO 
for change from baseline in central laboratory  Hgb. The anal ysis will be based on the 
mean change in Hgb between baseline and the efficacy  EP (defined as Weeks 28 to 52) 
using a non -inferiorit y margin of -0.75 g/dL. An analy sis of the ITT Population , 
comprising all subjects with a least one Hgb measurement (on or off treatment) during 
the EP and an anal ysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used. The model will 
include prognostic randomization stra tification factors (dial ysis type and region), and 
factors for baseline Hgb and treatment.

196If a pregnancy  is reported then the investigator should inform PPD within 24 hours 2 
weeks of learning of the pregnancy  and should follow the procedures outlined in 
Appendix 10.
Section 9.1.1. CV Safety (MACE) Co -Primary Hypothesis, Updat es to non -inferiority 
margin and relative risk in order to align the non -inferiority margin with similar studies 
that have already compared the effects of HIF -PHIs on MACE versus rhEPO.
Null: daprodustat is inferior to rhEPO, with at least a 2 50% increased relative risk 
of first MACE (i.e. the hazard ratio is 1.250)
Alternative: daprodustat is non -inferior to rhEPO (i.e. the hazard ratio is <1.2 50)
The non -inferiority  margin is pre -defined as the hazard ratio of 1.2 50; supported by  a 
review of evidence reported in historical randomized trials of rhEPO in dialy sis and ND 
CKD subjects and after consideration of the largest point estimate that, by  design, would 
meet the statistical criterion for non -inferiority . 
Statisti cal significance of non -inferiorit y will be assessed at the one -sided 2.5% level. A 
Cox-Proportional Hazards -Regression model, adjusting for treatment and prognostic 
randomization stratification factors (dialy sis type and region), will be used to estimate the 
hazard -ratio, its two -sided 95% CI  and to generate the p -value for the non -inferiorit y test. 
Non-inferiorit y will be achieved if the upper limit of the two -sided 95% CI is below the 
margin of 1.2 50.  
Section 9.1.2. Hgb efficacy Co -Primary Hypothesis, Analysis of the hemoglobin co -
primary endpoint was updated based on FDA feedback.
The co -primary  Hgb efficacy  objective will assess the estimand defined as the effect 
comparative treatment effect in mean Hgb change between baseline and EP (i.e., Weeks 
28 to 52 inclusive) in all randomized subjects; defined as those who remain in follow -up 
throughout the period of stabilization and have at least one Hgb assessment during the EP 
(i.e., Weeks 28 to 52) regardless of adherence to study  treatment. of daprodustat 
treatment relative to rhEPO on the change in Hgb from baseline to the average of 
all values in the EP, regardless of adherence to treatment including interruptions 
and discontinuations, the use of non -randomized ESA medication for any reason 
including resc ue therapy, or the use of blood transfusions, in subjects on dialysis 
currently treated with an ESA with anemia secondary to CKD and assuming 
subjects do not die before the end of the EP. The anal ysis will test whether daprodustat 
is non -inferior to rhEPO according to the following statistical h ypotheses: 
Section 9.2.1 Sample Size Assumptions, Revised target MACE, projected annual 
adjudicated first MACE rate and non -inferiority margin in order to align the non -
inferiority margin with similar studies that h ave already compared the effects of HIF -
PHIs on MACE versus rhEPO.
The size of this event driven trial is based on the co -primary  CV safet y objective and is 
determined b y a fixed event target of 664945adjudicated first MACE. This provides 
approximately  90% power to establish non -inferiority  assuming a true underly ing 3% 
lower relative risk of MACE in favor of daprodustat compared to rhEPO (i.e., hazard 
ratio=0.97) and 8280% power for non -inferiority  under the assumption that the true 
2015N226659_07 CONFIDENTIA L
200807
197underly ing risk of MACE is the same in both arms (i.e., hazard ratio=1.00). Other 
assumptions behind the sample size calculation include:
Projected annual adjudicated first MACE rate of 1 15%. All -cause death is expected 
to be the most prevalent component, followed b y non-fatal MI and then non -fatal 
stroke (projected break down of 60%, 30% and 10% respectively ). 
Variance under the alternative hy pothesis (i.e. hazard ratio=0.97) 
1% annual lost to follow -up without vital stat us
A two -sided 95% CI is used for analy sis
The target of 664945adjudicated first MACE will permit a two -sided 95% CI  of 
(0.859880, 1.164436) to describe the results for an observed hazard ratio of 1. The largest 
hazard ratio point estimate (two -sided 95% CI) that would meet the statistical criterion 
for non -inferiority  is 1.0 7456(0.922930, 1.250200) and for superiorit y, the minimum 
observable effect would be a 14.112% relative risk reduction in favor of daprodustat, 
corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0. 859880. 
Conditional on both co -primary  endpoints achieving non -inferiorit y at the one -sided 
2.5% level, statistical testing will progress to evaluate MACE and the principal secondary  
endpoints for superiorit y. These tests will be multiplicity  adjusted, deta ils are provided in 
Section 9.4.3. 
Based on an annual MACE rate of 11%, it is anticipated that approximately  3000 
dialy sis subjects will be required to achieve 664 adjudicated first MACE target will be 
reached approximately after3.3years from when the first subject is randomized. 
Assuming the trial continues to its planned final analy sis, and based on recruitment and 
event rate assumptions, enrolment is expected to complete within 1.4 y ears. All subjects 
will have the opportunity fo r a minimum of 1 y ear exposure to treatment and thus the 
opportunity  to complete the EP (Weeks 28 to 52). Exposure to daprodustat is expected to 
be in the region of 3,500 4,000 patient y ears with median patient follow -up expected to 
exceed 2 years.
Section 9.2.2. Sample Size Sensitivity, Updated based on blinded MACE accrual.
The estimated 11% annual MACE rate is based on a blinded summary of ASCEND -
D data as of April 20, 2020. Table 11illustrates the impact on power if the true 
underlying The estimated (ba se case) 15% annual rhEPO MACE rate is based on a 
review of randomized clinical trials in dialy sis (peginesatide EMERALD studies 
[Macdougall, 2013] and NHS study  [Besarab, 1998]), observational data in dialy sis 
patients ( GSK report from the Dialy sis Outcom es and Practice Patterns Study   [DOPPS, 
2014] and the USRDS 2013 annual report [ USRDS , 2013]) and considering the planned 
regional distribution for recruitment. Table 11illustrates the impact on timing of events if 
the true underl ying annual MACE rate diff ers from 15% and Table 12if the true 
underly ing treatment effect is not a hazard ratio of 0.97.

Section 9.2.3. Sample Size Re -estimation or Adjustment, Updated to reflect no sample 
size re -estimation was performed.
At the time of this protocol amendment, the study was fully enrolled, and as such no 
sample size re -estimation was performed .  It is currentl y unknown whether the rhEPO 
MACE event rate based on the previous trials has changed due to modifications in rhEPO 
use following emergence of data demonstrating safety concerns with the use of rhEPO. 
GSK and the Executive Steering Committee will re view blinded data periodically  during 
the course of the study  and should emerging data suggest that the overall event rate 
and/or enrolment rate (main study  or sub -studies) diverges significantl y from protocol 
assumptions either the sample size required to achieve the event target and/or the 
requirements for a minimum one y ear follow -up may  be adjusted.
Section 9.3.1 Analysis Population, Updated terminology to be consistent with ICH -E9 
addendum.
The primary  population for the Hgb efficacy  anal yses will also be the ITT Population. In 
order to assess the sensitivity  of the primary  efficacy  anal ysis, an A supportive analysis 
of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed in a Per -Protocol (PP) Population 
defined as all ITT subjects who are not major protocol violators. Details will be defined 
in the RAP and subjects anal yzed according to the treatment received.
Section 9.4.1.1. Primary CV Safety Analysis (co -primary), •Revised MACE NI margin in 
order to align the NI margin with similar studies that have alre ady compared the effects 
of HIF -PHIs on MACE versus rhEPO and terminology updated to be consistent with 
ICH-E9 addendum.

199Non-inferiorit y will be established if the upper limit of the two -sided 95% CI  is less than 
the margin of 1.2 50.
Sensitivity  and Su pportive Anal yses: Sensitivity  anal ysesA sensitivity analysis will be 
performed to address potential effects of drop outs and to evaluate the robustness of the 
co-primary  MACE anal ysis. These will include a A sensitivity “tipping point” anal ysis 
utilizing multiple imputation for randomized subjects who have withdrawn consent or are 
lost to follow up from the study will be performed , as well ; and asa supportive “on-
drug” anal ysis to evaluate the comparative treatment effec t during the time that subjects 
remain on randomized treatment (plus a window of 28 day s). Full details will be provided 
in the RAP.
Section 9.4.1.2. Primary Efficacy Analysis (co -primary), Analysis of the hemoglobin co -
primary endpoint was updated based o n FDA feedback.
Mean change in Hgb between baseline and the EP (Weeks 28 to 52): The primary  
efficacy  estimand is t he effect of daprodustat relative to rhEPO on the change in Hgb 
from baseline to the average of all values in the EP, regardless of adherence to 
treatment including interruptions and discontinuation, the use of non -randomized 
ESA medication for any reason including rescue therapy, or the use of blood 
transfusions, in subjects on dialysis currently treated with an ESA with anemia 
secondary to CK D and assuming subjects do not die before the end of the EP. to 
compare the effect of treatment for the evaluation of mean change from baseline in Hgb 
during a 24 week evaluation period (Weeks 28 to 52 inclusive) in all ITT subjects with at 
least one Hgb d uring the EP. The anal ysis will use an ANCOVA model. For each 
subject, baseline Hgb will be the value obtained on Day  1, prior to taking randomized 
treatment, and Hgb during EP will be determined by  calculating the mean of all available 
and imputed Hgb va lues between Weeks 28 to 52 inclusive regardless of adherence to 
randomized treatment. The ANCOVA model will include prognostic randomization 
stratification factors (dialy sis ty pe and region), baseline hemoglobin and treatment. I t will 
provide a point esti mate and two -sided 95% CI for the treatment effect together with the 
one-sided non -inferiorit y test p -value. Non -inferiority  will be established if the lower 
limit of the two -sided 95% CI  is greater than the margin of -0.75 g/dL . There will be no 
imputatio n for missing data but imputation will be explored via sensitivity anal yses 
Imputation will be used for missing Hgb data; further details will be provided in the 
RAP.
Sensitivity and Supportive Anal yses:Sensitivity  anal yses for the primary  estimand will 
include a multiple imputation -based “tipping point” anal ysis where assumptions are 
adjusted until non -inferiority  is lost by  imputing data for subjects who did not fully  
complete the EP. A further supportive analysis will evaluate efficacy  in those subjects 
who adhere to randomized treatment, defined as ITT subjects with at least one on -
treatment Hgb during the EP (this approach corresponds to evaluating an efficacy 
estimand). A similar supportive “tipping point” analy sis as that described above for the 
primar y anal ysis will be performed for this “on -drug” anal ysis. In addition, a per -protocol 
sensitivity supportive analy sis will estimate the treatment effect in subjects who strongl y 
adhere to the protocol, and sensitivity supportive analy ses to explore a shorter EP (Weeks 
28 to 36) will be performed for the co -primary  effectiveness estimand and “on -drug”

Figure 2 illustrates the structure of the statistical testing plan. First, the co -primary  
endpoints wi ll be evaluated for non -inferiorit y by comparing each two -sided 95% CI  to 
the appropriate non -inferiority  margin. Conditional on both co -primary  endpoints 
achieving non -inferiorit y (i.e., passing the gatekeeper), the family of MACE and the 
principal second ary endpoints will be formally tested for superiority using the widel y 
known Hommel procedure [GSK Document Number WEUKBRE7146. Cardiovascular

worsening of hypertension.
Worsening 
of 
hypertensionIn a dog cardiovascular study, single oral doses of daprodustat (up to 90 
mg/kg) did not produce effects on blood pressure.
Marketed rhEPO and its analogues have been associated with risks related 
to uncontrolled hypertension, including the need for initiation of or 
increases in antihypertensive therapy when used in patients with anemia 
of CKD (i.e. 25% Epogen, 27% Mircera, and 40% Aranesp treated patients 
with renal anemia required initiation or increase in their anti -hypertensive 
medications; hypertensive encephalopathy and seizures have been 
reported. The contribution of rhEPO -associated hypertension to the 
unfavourable effect s on cardiovascular outcomes remains uncertain).
Integrated AE data from clinical trials with daprodustat [including 2 global 
phase 2b studies (24 -week treatment duration) and 2 Japanese phase 3 
studies (52 -week treatment duration)]: 
oThe majority (>90%) o f subjects had a baseline history of 
hypertension.

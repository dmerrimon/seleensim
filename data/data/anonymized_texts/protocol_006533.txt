Studied  period:  First enrolment:  Q3 2018.  Expected  completion  date:  Q4 2020.  
Objectives:  The primary  aim is to establish  the safety,  efficacy  and mechanism  of action  of 
lanifibranor  in patients  with Type  2 diabetes  (T2DM)  and nonalcoholic  fatty liver disease  
(NAFLD).  Specifically,  to determine  if lanifibranor  decreases  intrahepatic  triglycerides  (IHTG)  
(primary  endpoint),  improves  hepatic  insulin  sensitivity,  endogenous  (hepatic)  glucose  production,  
gluconeogenesis  and de novo  lipogenesis  (DNL).  This will be achieved  by using  a combination  of 
intravenously  infused  stable  isotopes  and with the infusion  of a low- and high-dose insulin  infusion  
during  a euglycemic  hyperinsulinemic  clamp  with indirect  calorimetry.  In addition,  exploratory  
analysis  with surrogate  plasma  biomarkers  and imaging  on liver fibrosis  changes  on with treatment  
will be performed.  
Study  design:  The study  is a two arm (placebo,  lanifibranor  800 mg/day),  randomized  (1:1),  
double -blind,  placebo -controlled,  24-week  treatment  study.  There  is in addition  a non-obese  
subject  control  group  for the metabolic  and imaging  procedures.  
Study  duration:  The total time (from  first patient  enrolled  to last patient  finished)  will be 32±4  
weeks  (4-6 weeks  for run-in, 24 weeks  of treatment  and 4 weeks  post-study  follow -up), with an 
estimated  recruitment  period  of 6-9 months.  
Total  number  of subjects:  34 randomized  to study  drug or placebo.  Ten healthy  non-obese  will 
also be studied  as “normal  controls”  for all the metabolic  and imaging  tests to be performed.  
 
Diagnosis and  main  criteria  for inclusion:  
1. Be able to communicate  meaningfully  with the investigator  and legally  competent  to 
provide  written  informed  consent  
2. Have  an age between  21 to 75 years inclusive  
3. Subjects  should  be on stable  standard  of care and background  therapy  for ongoing chronic 
conditions, including stable doses of anti -diabetic medications, for at least two (2) months 
prior to trial entry  
4. Have  uncontrolled  diabetes  with a fasting  plasma  glucose (FPG)  ≥ 100 mg/dL  but ≤ 250 
mg/dL and HbA1c ≥ 6.0% but ≤ 9.5%, on diet alone, or on metformin (≥1,000 mg/day), 
and/or sulfonylurea and/or DPP -IV therapy, SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP1RA. These medicines 
will be continued at stable doses during the  entire study.  
a. Subjects  with an HbA1c  > 8.0%  but ≤ 9.5%  will have their metformin  
(minimum  dose required:  1,000 mg/day)  maximized  to 1,000  mg BID and/or  
Page  10 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 February 7th, 2022  
  
 glimepiride  2 mg once  daily  added  during  the first 2 weeks  of the run-in period.  
The baseline  visit to initiate  lanifibranor  (V4; Time  0 or randomization  visit)  will be 
not sooner  than 8 weeks  from  diabetes  medication  titration  and the patient  should  
have  an HbA1c ≤9.0% to  proceed  to randomization  (V4).  
b. In addition, if both metformin and glimepiride (or another sulfonylurea) are already 
maximized at study entry (or the patient is intolerant to either) and the HbA1c  ≥ 
9.0% but ≤9.5%,  we will add sitagliptin  100 mg daily (or an equivalent dose of 
another DPP -IV inhibitor)  to reach an HbA1c  ≤9.0% to proceed to randomization 
(V4).  
5. Presence of hepatic steatosis (Intrahepatic Triglycerides IHTG) > 10 % determined by 
Magnetic Resonance and Spectroscopy (1H -MRS).

• Anticoagulants  (incl.  warfarin,  dabigatran,  rivaroxaban,  apixaban),  
• Systemic  steroids  (more  than physiological  replacement  of 30 mg of hydrocortisone  per 
day).  
• Substrates of CYP2B6 (e.g. artemether, artemisinin, bupropion, coumarins [e.g. warfarin, 
acenocumarol], cyclophosphamide, efavirenz, ifosfamine, mephobarbital, methadone,

Page  13 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 February 7th, 2022  
  
 occasionally.  
• CYP2C8 strong inhibitors, when systemically administered, i.e. by oral, intra -venous or 
intra-muscular route of administration (e.g. gemfibrozil, c lopidogrel, felodipine, zafirlukast, 
candesartan celixetil, ketoconazole).  
 
Allowable  medications  for standard  care or precautions:  
• Obesity : stable weight  defined  by no more  than a change  of 5 kg (see exclusion  criteria  
N° 3). 
• Treatment  used for the underlying  medical  condition  
Treatments  are allowed  within  certain  restrictions  (described  above  and below)  and 
provided  that they have  been  kept at stable  doses  for at least 2 months  before  inclusion   
in the study . 
o Type  2 diabetes:  
• Metformin,  
• Sulfonylureas,  
• Dipeptidyl  peptidase -4 inhibitors,  
• Sodium -glucose  transport  protein  2 inhibitors:  canagliflozin,  dapagliflozin  
and empagliflozin.  
• GLP-1RA  
o Hyperlipidemia : only statins  at stable  doses  will be allowed.  
o Antiplatelets  agents:  The antiplatelets  agents  (incl.  low-dose aspirin,  ticlopidine,  
clopidogrel,  prasugrel,  ticagrelor)  are allowed.  
o Herbal  supplements:  Herbal  preparations  or vitamin  supplements  should  not be 
taken  as it is difficult  to know  exactly  what  they contain  and could  be liver toxic.  
 
If a symptomatic  medication  is needed  to treat adverse  events  that may be related  to IMP,  the 
investigator  will inform  the Principal  Investigator  about  the concomitant  medication  given.  
Duration  of treatment:  lanifibranor  or placebo to match will be given  for 24 weeks.  
Parameters  assessed  during  the study : Continuous  recording  of adverse  events  and 
concomitants  therapies,  physical  examination,  vital signs,  ECG  (12-leads),  hematology,  blood  
biochemistry  and urinalysis,  liver enzymes,  oral glucose  tolerance  test, exploratory  biomarkers  
adiponectin,  ProC3,  CK-18, genotyping.  
Imaging  such as fibroscan,  liver fibrosis,  liver IHTG  and T1 MR mapping.  
All patients,  insulin  sensitivity  study:  2-step insulin  clamp  with glucose  turnover  measurements.  
 
Primary  efficacy  criterion . Determine  if lanifibranor  decreases  intrahepatic  triglycerides  (IHTG)  
(primary  endpoint),  improves  hepatic  insulin  sensitivity,  endogenous  (hepatic)  glucose  production,  
gluconeogenesis  and de novo  lipogenesis  (DNL).  
 
Statistical methods and Saf ety: 
Sample  size: based  on the most  recent  studies,  patients  with NAFLD  are expected  to have  a mean  
baseline  IHTG  of approximately  15%.  The earlier  power  calculations  were  based  on results  with 
pioglitazone  from  a 6-month  study  (1) and a more  recent  18-month  RCT  (2) but they wee revised  
in version  2.4.1 of the protocol  based  on the results  with lanifibranor  800 mg/day  (same  dose as this 
study)  from  a 6-month  RCT  (NATIVE)  that used liver biopsy  (histology)  as the primary  endpoint  
(provided  in detail  by Inventiva  to the PI Dr. Cusi).  In NATIVE,  the proportion  of patients  with a 
reduction  in steatosis  to lanifibranor  was 73% versus  26% with placebo  (steatosis  being  the primary  
endpoint  of this study);  being  greater  than with pioglitazone  in the 6-month  Belfort  et al study  
Page  14 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 February 7th, 2022  
  
 [1]). Based  on these  results,  this would  translate  to liver fat imaging  on 1H-MRS  of a relative  
reduction  of fat liver with lanifibranor  to be ≥50% compared  to placebo.  This represents  a 
change  of ≥7.0%  with lanifibranor  versus  the control  group.  The expected  standard  deviation  of 
the change  from  baseline  is expected to be 7%. Considering  a type I error of 0.05 (2- sided),  a 
power of 0.80,  an allocation  ratio of 1:1, the same variance in both treatment groups  and a 
parametric  test of mean  comparison,  the required  sample  size per group  is 15 patients  to complete  
treatment.  Assuming  that 10 % of randomized  patients  will not complete  the trial, the total number  
of patients  to be randomized  is 33-34 patients.  Considering  a type I error  of 0.05 (2-sided),  a power  
of 0.80,  an allocation  ratio of 1:1, the same  variance  in both treatment  groups  and a parametric  test 
of mean  comparison  the required  sample  size per group  is 15 patients.  Assuming  that 10 % of 
randomized  patients  will not complete  the trial, the total number  of patients  to be randomized  is 
34. 
Randomization : Patients  will be randomized  equally  1:1: to either  dose of lanifibranor  or placebo.  
The randomization  list will be setup  with blocs  of size equal  to 4. 
Safety  variables : The review  of safety  and tolerance  will be performed  on the safety  population.  
The safety  analysis  will be based  on the reported  AEs and other  safety  information.  The Principal  
Investigator  will use its most  updated  list of potentially  clinically  significant  abnormalities  (PCSA)  
in clinical  laboratory  tests,  vital signs,  and ECG  for the final analysis.  The effect  of the 
demographic  differences  (gender,  age, etc.) and risk factors  of clinical  relevance  will be explored.  
Efficacy  variables:  
Primary  outcome : Change  in IHTG  quantified  by ¹H-MRS  from  baseline  to 24 weeks  
Secondary  endpoints : 
The following  changes  from  baseline  to 24 weeks  of treatment  will be evaluated:  
• Proportion of responders defined as the percentage of patients reaching a decrease from 
baseline in IHTG (quantified by ¹H -MRS) to week 24 of ≥ 30%. The definition of 
“responders” as those with a ≥ 30% reduction in liver fat by ¹H -MRS is empiric as there 
are no studies (except the Belfort et al, NEJM 2006 (1) and Cusi et al (2) with 
pioglitazone) comparing simultaneously ¹H -MRS data with liver histology, but it is 
assumed that such threshold is likely to correlate with positive histological changes in 
NASH,  based on the investigator's experience.  
• Proportion  of patients  with NAFLD   resolution   considered   as  having   ≤  5.5%   IHTG  
(quantified  by 1H- MRS)  at 24 weeks.  
• Changes  in hepatic  fibrosis  measured  by several  techniques:  
a) Vibration -controlled  transient  elastography  (Fibroscan)  (3); 
b) Two-dimensional  magnetic  resonance  elastography  (2D-MRE)  (4); and 
c) A novel  T1 MRI mapping  scanning  protocol  that allows  for the accurate  non-invasive  
measurement  of liver fibrosis,  in collaboration  with the Oxford  laboratory  (5). 
• Change  in plasma  biomarkers  of liver fibrosis  (i.e., cytokeratin  CK-18, proC3)  or clinical  
laboratories.  
• Change  in metabolic  outcomes  standard  for such pilot trials  (see ref. 1, 2, and 6) at week  
24 of treatment,  and will include:  
o Determination  of hepatic  insulin  sensitivity  
o De novo  lipogenesis  
o Glycemic  control:  HbA1c,  
o Advanced  lipid testing.  
Study  procedures:  
All patients  will undergo  ten visits,  screening  V1 to V3 (-6 weeks  to -1 week), randomization  V4 
Page  15 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 February 7th, 2022  
  
 (time  0), follow -up V5  (week 4), follow -up V6 (week  8), follow -up V7  (week  12), follow -up V8 
(week  16), follow -up V9 (week  20), repeated  baseline  studies  at V10 (week  23), V11 (week  
24), and off-drug  follow -up V12 (week  28). For all visits  time windows  are defined  up to +/- 5 
days compared  to V1 and are indicate d in the Table 1. 
Patients  will be randomized  to either  dose of lanifibranor  or placebo  at V4 and treated  for 24 weeks  
until V11.  Please  note that due to COVID -19 pandemic, in order  to be able to accomm odate important 
follow-up study  procedures, for some  of the already  enrolled subjects, treatme nt with lanifibranor 
may have to be extended by 1-8 weeks. This time frame  will allow  completi on of the follow-up liver 
MRI (V10)  and perform  the insulin  clamp (V11).  These  are essential procedures in order  to obtain 
the primary  and secondary outcomes of the study.  
A vital signs,  weight,  height  and waist  measurements  will be performed  at each visit.  An ECG  
will be done  at screening  (V1)  and at end of treatment  (V11).  A physical  exam  including  weight  
measurement  every  4 weeks  once  patients  randomized  to study  medication.  Adverse  events  and 
concomitant  medications  will be recorded  throughout  the study.  Patients  and caregivers  will be 
educated  for potential  symptoms  of adverse  effects  that should  be reported  to the investigators,  
such as skeletal  muscle  pain,  weight  gain,  peripheral  edema,  shortness  of breath,  etc. If a patient  
has symptoms  of dyspnea,  edema,  or a presumptive  diagnosis  of heart  failure,  NT-proBNP  should  
be measured  as close  to the event  as possible.  The potential  for hypoglycemia  will be monitored  
carefully,  particularly  in patients  on anti-diabetic  medications,  as detailed  in the protocol.  
The routine  laboratory  assessments  performed  at V1, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, V9 V11 and V12 will 
include:  complete  blood  count,  comprehensive  metabolic  profile  and lipids.  CK and CK-MB will 
be measured  every  4 weeks  once  the patient  is randomized  to study  medication.  
Urine  Samples  will be collected  at V1, V11 and at V12.  
Urine  pregnancy  test will  be performed  at V1, V4, V7,  V9, V11 and V12.

 1 INTRODUCTION  
This is a Phase  II, randomized,  double -blind,  placebo -controlled,  single -center,   investigator  
initiated,  24-week  treatment  study  of lanifibranor  (IVA337)  in adult  subjects  with Type  2 diabetes  
(T2DM)  and nonalcoholic  fatty liver disease  (NAFLD).  
This introductory  section  provides  a rationale  for the study,  describes  the underlying  conditions  of 
the patients  to be included  in the study,  the scientific  rationale  for exploring  lanifibranor  in 
NAFLD,  summarizes  the lanifibranor  preclinical  and clinical  data.  
 
1.1 Study  Rationale  
Nonalcoholic  fatty liver disease  (NAFLD)  develops  in ~70%  of patients  with type 2 diabetes  
mellitus  (T2DM)  (7,8) and about  40% develop  the more  severe  form  of the disease  with hepatocyte  
necrosis  (ballooning)  and liver inflammation  (steatohepatitis  or NASH).  This is often  in diabetes  
associated  with fibrosis progression  and a higher  risk of developing  cirrhosis. Of  note,  diabetes is  
the single  most  important  clinical  risk factor  for NASH  progression.  This is particularly  true in the 
setting  of obesity,  where  insulin -resistant  (dysfunctional)  adipose  tissue  promotes  hepatic  steatosis  
and hepatocyte  injury  from  “lipotoxicity”  (12). Patients  with T2DM  and NASH  are also at 
increased  risk of micro - and macrovascular  complications  (7-13). Taken  together,  it is likely  that 
clinicians  managing  patients  with T2DM  will give preeminence  to treatments  that not only control  
hyperglycemia,  but also treat liver disease  (NASH).  Unfortunately,  treatment  options  for 
NAFLD/NASH  remain  limited  although  many  drugs  are in development,  as reviewed  recently  
elsewhere  (13,14). Successful  treatments  for NASH  will likely  need  to reverse  liver insulin  
resistance  (7,8 - see below).  Lanifibranor  (IVA337),  a pan-PPAR  α, δ and γ, may improve  or 
normalize  hepatic  insulin  sensitivity,  intrahepatic  triglyceride  (IHTG)  accumulation,  excessive  de 
novo  lipogenesis  (DNL)  and VLDL  oversecretion  (i.e., atherogenic  dyslipidemia)  in humans  but 
this remains  to be tested.  This may be due to either a direct effect  on intracellular  glucose or lipid 
metabolism  effects  in hepatocytes,  kupfer  and stellate  cells.  As obesity  reaches  epidemic  
proportions,  nonalcoholic  fatty liver disease  (NAFLD)  is becoming  a frequent  cause  of patient  
referral  to gastroenterologists.  There  is a close  link between  dysfunctional  adipose  tissue  in 
NAFLD  and common  conditions  such as metabolic  syndrome,  T2DM,  and cardiovascular  disease.  
The following  focuses  on the pathophysiology  of interactions  between  adipose  tissue  and target  
organs  in obesity  and the resulting  clinical  implications  for the management  of nonalcoholic  
steatohepatitis.  The release  of fatty acids  from  dysfunctional  and insulin -resistant  adipocytes  
results  in lipotoxicity,  caused  by the accumulation  of triglyceride -derived  toxic  metabolites  in 
ectopic  tissues  (liver,  muscle,  pancreatic  beta cells)  and subsequent  activation  of inflammatory  
pathways,  cellular  dysfunction,  and lipoapoptosis.  The cross  talk between  dysfunctional  
adipocytes  and the liver involves  multiple  cell populations,  including  macrophages  and other  
immune  cells that in concert  promote  the development  of lipotoxic  liver disease,  a term that more  
accurately  describes  the pathophysiology  of nonalcoholic  steatohepatitis.  At the clinical  level,  
adipose  tissue  insulin  resistance  contributes  to type 2 diabetes  mellitus  and cardiovascular  disease.  
Treatments  that rescue  the liver from  lipotoxicity  by restoring  adipose  tissue  insulin  sensitivity  
(e.g.,  significant  weight  loss, exercise,  thiazolidinediones)  or preventing  activation  of inflammatory  
pathways  and oxidative  stress  (ie, vitamin  E, thiazolidinediones)  hold promise  in the treatment  of 
NAFLD,  although  their long-term safety  and efficacy  remain  to be established.  Better  understanding  
of pathways  that link dysregulated  adipose  tissue,  metabolic  dysfunction,  and liver lipotoxicity  will 
result  in improvements  in the clinical  management  of these  challenging  patients  (7), or indirectly,  
through  PPAR  δ and/or  γ effects  on peripheral  adipose  tissue  or muscle  insulin  signaling  pathways.  
This study  will test the hypothesis  that treatment  with lanifibranor  will significantly  decrease  liver 
steatosis  (primary  endpoint)  in patients  with T2DM  and NAFLD.  It will also aim to understand  the 
mechanism(s)  of action  of IVA337  associated  with a reduction  in liver fat. Specifically,  we will 
examine  the effect  of IVA337  on hepatic  pathways  linked  to the development  of hepatic  steatosis,  
Page  27 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 insulin  resistance  and atherogenic  dyslipidemia  (hepatic  insulin  sensitivity,  endogenous  [largely  
hepatic]  glucose  production  and gluconeogenesis,  DNL  and VLDL  secretion)  with the use of gold- 
standard  stable  isotope  metabolic  techniques.  This will establish  a robust  rationale  for the use of 
IVA337  in NAFLD  and will complement  the results of the Phase  IIb RCT  (NATIVE  trial)  on its 
effect  on liver histology  in NASH , where there was a significant improvement in the primary 
endpoint (SAF -A score and no worsening of fibrosis in 48% with 800 mg/day (p=0.07) and in 55% 
with 1,200 mg/day o f lanifbranor (p=0.007) vs. 33% with placebo .  Secondary endpoints significant 
with both doses included resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis were and in the 
composite endpoint of resolution of NASH and improvement of fibrosis.  
 
1.2 Previous  Studies  in Patients  NAFLD/NASH  and T2DM  and Interest  
of Assessing  the Metabolic  Effects  of the Pan-PPAR  IVA337  
There  is limited  data on pharmacological  treatments  for this population  (13,14). Treatment  of 
NASH  with DPP-IV inhibitors  have  met mixed  results  in NAFLD  (8,13), while  the potential  of 
GLP-1RAs  is more promising.  For instance,  during  clinical  development  it was observed  that 
liraglutide  lowered  elevated  plasma  aminotransferases  in patients  with T2DM  (15). However,  it 
was not until recently  that GLP-1RAs  were  reported  to reverse  metabolic  (16) and histological  
(17) defects  in NASH. In the study  by Armstrong et al (17), resolution of NASH  occurred  in 39% 
of patients  treated with  liraglutide  versus  9% treated  with placebo  (p=0.019;  treatment  difference  
~30%).  Of note,  liraglutide  improved  some  but not all histological features.  There  was a decrease  
in steatosis  (83%  vs. 45%;  p=0.009;  ~35%  reduction  in mean  steatosis  cores  from  baseline)  and 
hepatocyte  ballooning  (61%  vs. 32%;  p=0.05).  Insulin  sensitivity  at the level  of the liver and 
adipose  tissue  improved  in a subset  of patients  undergoing  in-depth  metabolic  studies  at 3 months  
(16). However,  the study  was small  and only one-third of patients  had T2DM.  Moreover,  recently  
Tang  et al (18) recently  reported  no effect  of liraglutide  on liver fat in patients  with T2DM  and 
NAFLD.  Therefore,  the role of GLP-1RAs  in patients  with T2DM  and NAFLD  remains  to be fully 
established.  
Peroxisome  proliferator -activated  receptors  (PPARs)  are nuclear  receptor  proteins  that function  as 
transcription  factors  regulating  the expression  of genes  essential  for cellular  differentiation,  and 
development,  as well as in key pathways  of carbohydrate,  lipid and protein  (1). PPARα  is highly  
expressed  in the liver and its activation  by fibrates  modulates  fatty acid transport  and β-oxidation,  
inflammatory  pathways,  and improves  the plasma  lipoprotein  profile  observed  in insulin -resistant  
states,  but not glucose  metabolism  (19). Moreover,  fibrates  do not reduce  hepatic  triglyceride  
concentration  in NAFLD  (20). PPARδ  agonists  also promote  fatty acid transport  and β-oxidation,  
increase  plasma  HDL -C concentration,  and exert  anti-inflammatory  actions  in macrophages  and 
Kupffer  cells (19), but in addition  may improve  glucose  metabolism  by enhancing  insulin  hepatic  
insulin  sensitivity  (21,22). These  features  are attractive  for the treatment  of NASH.  However,  
recently  elafibranor,  a PPARα/δ  agonist , failed  to meet  the primary  endpoint  of resolution  of 
NASH  in the GOLDEN  trial but reported  histological  benefit  in patients  with a higher  NAS  score  
(≥ 4) (23). Thiazolinediones  (TZDs)  are ligands  for the transcription  factor  PPAR -γ that plays  a 
key role in the regulation  of glucose  and lipid metabolism,  as well as in inflammation.  Belfort  et al 
were  the first to report  in a RCT  that a PPAR -γ ligand  (pioglitazone)  could  improve  liver 
histology  in patients  with NASH  and also having  prediabetes  or T2DM  (1). There  was also a 
suggestion  that fibrosis  could  be reversed  in NASH,  as pioglitazone -treated  patients  had a 
significant  reduction  in liver fibrosis  compared  to baseline,  although  this fell short  of reaching  
statistical  significance  when  compared  to placebo  (p=0.08).  This was later also demonstrated  in 
non-diabetic  patients  (7,14). Recently,  Cusi et al. reported  in a 36-month  study  in 101 patients  with 
prediabetes  or T2DM  and NASH  that pioglitazone  led to sustained  histological  and metabolic  
benefit  (2). Of note,  there  was also a modest  but statistically  significant  difference  in the mean  
scores  for fibrosis  when  compared  to placebo.  The effect  of pioglitazone  in patients  with advanced  
fibrosis  (F2-3) has been  suggested  from  a recent  meta -analysis  combining  all recent  RCTs  (24). 
Page  28 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 Animal  models  of NASH  offer  powerful  evidence  that the pan-PPAR  IVA337  can improve  insulin  
action,  increase  adiponectin,  improve  liver histology  and have  anti-inflammatory  and anti- fibrotic  
properties  (data  on file Inventiva  and 25). It is also likely  that IVA337  may improve  mitochondrial  
defects  that are at the core of the paradigm  linking  excess  substrate  supply  (fatty  acids),  insulin  
resistance,  hepatocyte  “lipotoxicity”  and steatohepatitis,  as recently  reviewed  (26,27). Recent  
studies  from  our laboratory  (28,29), and others  (30,31), support  the role of mitochondrial  
dysfunction  in NASH.  Recent  human  studies  indicate  inadequate  mitochondrial  adaptation  despite  
increased  TCA  cycle  activity  in obese  patients  with NASH  (32) and we have  developed  the 
methodology  to study  mitochondrial  function  in clinical  trials  (33). 
In humans,  the mechanism  of action  of IVA337  remains  to be further  assessed.  In the 4-week  
PK/PD  Phase  IIa study  in patients  with T2DM,  IVA337  had a mild glucose -lowering  effect.  It is 
unclear  if the limited  glucose -lowering  effect  was due to a lack of efficacy  per se or was related  to 
the short -term 4- week  exposure.  However,  treatment  improved  lipids  and markedly  increased  
plasma  adiponectin  concentration.  As mentioned above,  liver histology  improved in the Phase  IIb 
NATIVE  RCT,  being  important  at the same  time to establish  the mechanism  of action  and metabolic  
effects  of IVA337  on hepatic,  muscle  and/or  adipose  tissue  insulin sensitivity  in patients  in NASH,  
as reported  for liraglutide  (16,17) or pioglitazone  (1,2) in insulin -resistant  and/or  T2DM  patients.  
An attractive  feature  of IVA337  is its ability  to impact  through  its PPAR  α/δ profile lipid  pathways 
and likely  reduce  increased  rates of DNL  and hepatic  VLDL  secretion  that drive  the atherogenic  
dyslipidemia  and CVD  in NAFLD.  Pioglitazone,  possibly  by its PPAR  α properties,  has been 
reported  to reduce  DNL  in humans  (34) and lower  plasma  triglyceride  concentration  in association  
with an improvement  in mitochondrial  defects  that drive  hepatic  steatohepatitis  (7,31). Treatment  
with IVA337  would  be well suited  to address  these  defects  but requires  additional  investigations  in 
T2DM.  
In summary,  given  IVA337’s  apparent  clinical  efficacy  and overall  safety  (i.e., a PPAR  that is 
apparently  weight  neutral  and does not cause fluid retention), it may hold a significant  advantage  
over traditional  PPARγ  agonists  and other  drugs in  development  for NASH.  We hypothesize  that 
IVA337  will have  a profound  impact  on liver metabolism,  reducing  hepatic  triglyceride  content  
and improving  hepatic  insulin  sensitivity  in patients  with T2DM  and NAFLD/NASH.  Therapies  
that can reduce  hepatic  steatosis/TG  synthesis/DNL  and VLDL  oversecretion  will likely  become  
first-line therapy  for patients  with T2DM  and NASH.  This work  will open  a new horizon  for 
IVA337  as an insulin -sensitizer  and position  it as a key player  in the management  of these  patients.  
 
1.3 Investigational  Product  
Lanifibranor  (IVA337),  a new chemical  entity,  (4-[1-(1,3-benzothiazol -6-ylsulfonyl) -5-chloro - 
1H-indol -2-yl]butanoic  acid)  is an almost  white  to light brown  colored  solid.  
Structural  formula,  including  relative  and absolute  stereochemistry:  
Molecular  Formula:  C19H15Cl  N2O4S2  
Molecular weight:  434.92  
Chirality:  No asymmetric  carbon  
Polymorphism:  β form  crystal  
The Investigational  Medicinal  Product  is a white  to off-white  bi-convex  tablet,  weighing  
approximately  927 mg and showing  a breakline  to facilitate  the administration  to patients.  The 
film-coated  tablet  contains  400 mg of the active  ingredient  lanifibranor  (IVA337)  for an immediate  
release  formulation.  
Film -coated  tablets  with a core containing  900 mg of a physical  mixture  of lactose  monohydrate,  
microcrystalline  cellulose,  pre-gelatinized  starch  and magnesium  stearate  serve  as placebo.  
The Investigational  Medicinal  Products  used in this clinical  Phase  II trial will be packaged  in 
Page  29 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 containers  of High  Density  Polyethylene  (HDPE)  with proper  HDPE  closures  fitted  with a silica  
cartridge.  
Based  on the results  of the ongoing  stability  studies,  a shelf  life of 2 years  (storage  at 25°C  or 
below)  is proposed  for the Investigational  Medicinal  Product  provided  it is stored  in the original  
package,  the HDPE  bottles.  
Furthermore,  the stability  data at 40°C/75%RH  demonstrate  that temperature  excursions  (e.g. 
during  shipment,  storage)  will not significantly  affect  the stability  of lanifibranor  400 mg film- 
coated  tablets.  
To avoid  the potential  moisture  ingress,  which  may happen during the use of the monthly  pack, a 
twist -off cap integrated  with a 2 g of silica  gel has been  selected  for the closure.  The data of the 
“in use test” 35 days at 25°C/60%RH  open  bottles  have  confirmed  the stability  of the 
Investigational  Medicinal  Product  during  its proposed  clinical  use. 
A new formulation has been developed to reduce the size of the lanifibranor tablet and improve 
compliance to the treatment . The two formulations are be considered as similar as demonstrated by 
a bio -equivalence clinical study ( 337HVPK18006  trial). All characteristics of the investigational 
product remain the same except that t he new formulated  lanifibranor tablet has a  weigh of  
approximately  721 mg and a shelf life is of 3 years based on the results of the ongoing stability 
studies.  
Matching f ilm-coated  tablets  with a core containing  700 mg of a physical  mixture  of lactose  
monohydrate,  microcrystalline  cellulose,  pre-gelatinized  starch  and magnesium  stearate  have also 
been developed to serve  as placebo.  
Upon protocol approval, any new subject  enrolled will be administered with the new formulation. 
For subject s under treatment, the switch to the new formulation will be made at the  next study visit 
post protocol approval with respect to the initial assignment to treatment arm.  
 
1.4 Summary  of Lanifibranor  Preclinical  and Clinical  Data  
1.4.1 Pharmacology  
NAFLD/NASH  is a multifactorial  and multi -step disease.  A first component  of this pathology  
includes  the metabolic  syndrome  related  to insulin  resistance,  triglyceride  accumulation,  obesity  
etc. A second  component  is the fibrosis.  In our pre-clinical  studies,  we demonstrated  the beneficial  
effect  of IVA337  in several  components  of the metabolic  syndrome  as well as in fibrosis.  
IVA337,  in previous  experiments,  was shown  to exert  an anti-diabetic  and antihyperlipidemic  
activity  in db/db  mice,  ZDF rats, diet-induced  obese  mice  and the WOKW  rat model  of metabolic  
syndrome.  Furthermore,  it increased  serum  apoA1  level  in human  apoA1  transgenic  mice.  In 
functional  cellular  tests,  IVA337  increased  fatty acid β-oxidation,  stimulated  cholesterol  efflux,  
induced  the expression  of aP2 and adiponectin  genes  as well as ABCA1,  ABCG1  and LXRα  genes,  
while  it reduced  MCP -1 secretion.  All these  effects  are signature  of the activation  of the 3 PPAR  
receptor  isoforms.  
Recently,  it was  demonstrated in vivo that IVA337  displays  an antifibrotic  activity in bleomycin - 
induced  lung fibrosis,  in bleomycin -induced  skin fibrosis  (in preventive  and curative  mode),  in a 
model  of unilateral  ureteral  obstruction  (UUO) -induced  kidney  fibrosis  and in CCL4 -induced  
fibrosis  in the liver.  In the liver,  IVA337  is active  in both preventive  as well as curative  mode,  thus 
providing  evidence  for an anti-fibrotic  effect  in established  fibrotic  disease.  In the liver it was 
demonstrated  that IVA337  at 15 and 30 mg/kg  was able to inhibit  in a dose dependent  manner  the 
collagen  deposition  within  the liver (-42% and -73.16%  respectively).  IVA337  was also able to 
decrease  the serum  triglycerides  and ALT.  
HSC  are the cells responsible  for the secretion  the Extra -Cellular  Matrix  (ECM)  and especially  the 
Page  30 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 collagen  when  activated  (myofibroblast  transdifferenciation  of HSC).  The main  cellular  process  
underwent  by the HSC  in a fibrogenenic  environment  is proliferation  and activation.  The 
proliferation  assay  is based  on PDGF  and the activation  is based  on stiffness  (stiffness  of the plated  
plastic).  PDGF  is secreted  by a variety  of cell types  and plays  a central  role in fibrogenesis.  It 
induces  HSC  proliferation  and migration,  thus contributing  to the increase  of the number  of matrix - 
secreting  cells.  During  fibrosis,  the growing  deposition  of ECM  increases  the stiffness  of the liver 
and participates  to myofibroblast  transdifferentiation  of HSC.  IVA337  was able to fully inhibit  the 
proliferation  induced  by PDGF  and was able to prevent  the overexpression  of α-SMA  and the 
hallmark  of myofibroblast,  induced  by stiffness.  These  findings  strongly  support  the anti-fibrotic  
action  of IVA337  in the target  cells.  
Activity  of IVA337  on liver steatosis  and inflammation,  two main  components  of NASH,  was 
evaluated  in a 3-week  model  of MCD  diet in C57bl/6  mice  (report  in preparation).  It was shown  
that IVA337  prevented  steatosis  in a dose-dependent  manner  at the doses  of 10 and 30 mg/kg  
(-88.38%  and -97.89%  respectively  compared  to vehicle,  see Figure 2). IVA337  also prevented  
inflammation  at the doses  of 10 and 30 mg/kg  (-44.03%  and -74.49%  respectively  compared  to 
vehicle).  IVA337  also prevented  the increase  in ALT  transaminase  induced  by MCD  diet (-49.35%  
and 67.26%  at 10 and 30 mg/kg  respectively),  demonstrating  hepatoprotective  effect.

1.4.2 Pharmacokinetics  
IVA337  can be considered  as a class  II compound  as regard  to the Biopharmaceutics  Classification  
System  (BCS)  Guidance  and Biopharmaceutics  Drug  Disposition  Classification  System  
(BDDCS):  high permeability  and metabolism,  and low solubility.  It was evidenced  in all tested  
pecies  that IVA337  absorption  is dependent  on the drug substance  form  and formulation,  leading  
to a bioavailability  in animals  from  15% up to > 80%.  An enterohepatic  recycling  was evidenced,  
and a food effect  was observed  in human  in the presence  of high fat breakfast.  
After  oral administration  in humans,  maximum  plasma  levels  (Cmax) of IVA337  were  reached  at 
about  1.0-3.5 hours,  and terminal  plasma  elimination  half-life was around  10-15 h. Both  AUC  and 
Cmax increased  in a linear  but slightly  less than dose-proportional  manner.  Steady -state IVA337  
concentrations  were  generally  achieved  by Day 3 after daily  dose administration,  with no 
significant  accumulation.  
The mean  apparent  volume  of distribution  Vz/F  ranged  from  318 to 607 L in healthy  subjects.  
IVA337  was extensively  distributed  in monkeys  (~10 L/kg).  IVA337  binds  very highly  to plasma  
proteins  in all tested  species  (~99.9%)  and no affinity  to blood  cells was observed.  By 
autoradiography  in rat, IVA337  was shown  to be mainly  distributed  in the excretory  organs  (liver,  

Page  31 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 kidneys,  lungs,  gastrointestinal  tract)  and in placenta  in pregnant  rats with no affinity  for the 
melanin  tissues  and with very limited  central  nervous  system  distribution.  
IVA337 -related  radioactivity  elimination  in human  was mainly  fecal  (> 85%)  and the urinary  
excretion  was minor  (< 7%) with a very low renal  clearance.  The excretion  was essentially  
complete  after 3 days.  
AUC  indicated  that approximately  23% of the radioactivity  in human  plasma  were  related  to 
IVA337,  while  77% were  related  to its metabolites.  
Among  metabolites  identified in plasma,  feces  and urine,  the main  IVA337  metabolites  observed  
in human  were  the acylglucuronide  (IV1197736,  with similar  exposure  to that of the parent  
compound),  a monohydroxylated  (IV1537661)  and the benzothiazole  ring opened  IVA337  
derivative  (IV1197347).  All other  metabolites  were  reported  to represent  less than 5% of the 
administered  dose (14C -ADME  study  in human).  The completion  of the quantitative  comparison  
of the animal  versus  human  plasma  exposure  to these  three  metabolites  is ongoing.  
In vitro  data on drug-drug interaction  of IVA337  and its three  main  human  metabolites  were  
completed.  The data interpretation  was done  following  EMA  and FDA  guidelines  on the 
investigation  of drug interactions,  considering  the therapeutic  dose of 1200  mg (Cmax ~20 µM) and 
estimated  parameters  (Ka, Fa) from  population  PK modelling.  
As victim,  the pharmacokinetic  of IVA337  or its main  human  metabolites  was observed  in vitro  to 
be possibly  sensitive  to the pathways  CYP2C8,  CYP2C19,  CYP3A4,  UGT1A1,  UGT1A3,  
UGT2B7,  MRP2,  MRP3,  OATP1B1  and OATP1B3.  As several  isoforms  of each enzyme  are 
involved  (CYP  and UGT),  a risk of clinical  interaction  via these  pathways  is reduced.  Nevertheless,  
the contribution  of CYP  isoforms  to the formation  of the main  Phase  I metabolites  is still to be 
exemplified.  As regards  to transporters,  clinical  data would  be required  to assess  the possible  
interaction  of comedications  on the IVA337  via these  pathways.  
As perpetrator,  in vitro studies  evidenced  that IVA337  or its main  human  metabolites  may have  an 
impact  on the pharmacokinetics  of drugs  which  are sensitive  to the pathways  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  
UGT1A1,  UGT1A4,  UGT2B7,  BCRP,  MRP2,  MRP3,  OATP1B1,  OATP1B3,  and at the intestine 
level  MDR1,  and at the kidney  level  OAT1  and OAT3.  In silico  modelling  will be conducted  for a 
deeper  analysis  on the CYP  and OAT  interactions.  As regards  to MDR1,  BCRP,  OATP  and MRP  
transporters,  clinical  studies  would  be conducted  to assess  the possible  interaction  of IVA337  on 
comedications  via these  pathways.  A first study  was performed  with simvastatin,  substrate  of 
several  pathways  (MDR1,  BCRP,  OATP1B1  but also CYP3A4  and CYP2C8),  which  seemed  not 
to evidence  a significant  drug-drug interaction  (< 2-fold)  although  the increase  of simvastatin  Cmax 
may possibly  be due to MDR1/BCRP  intestinal  inhibition.  
A limited  risk of CYP  induction  could  be expected  in vivo.  No induction  CYP1A2 or CYP2B6  in 
any of the human  hepatocyte  donors  tested  when  incubated  by IVA337  (N=7)  or its metabolites  
(N=3).  A slight  mRNA  CYP3A4  induction  was observed  (2.3-12 fold, equating  to 0.5-28 % of the 
response  observed  with rifampicin) at 12.5  µM while  a mRNA repression was  observed  at higher  
concentrations.  CYP3A4  enzyme  activities  (studied  in four donors  with IVA337)  was shown  to be 
slightly  induced  in two donors  after incubation  with IVA337  but only with high concentration  
(> 40 µM).  
No significant  drug-drug interactions  were  observed  with simvastatin  and IVA337  (< 2-fold),  and 
no PK/genotype  (CYP450  isoenzymes  and UGTs  isoform)  relationship  has been  identified.  There  
was a 22% increase  in Cmax and 39% increase  in AUC  of IVA337  in elderly  subjects  as compared  
to young  subjects.  
 
1.4.3 Toxicology  
IVA337  has a very  low acute toxicity  (maximal  non-lethal  dose of 2000  mg/kg  in rodents)  and is 
Page  32 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 not irritating  to the skin.  
IVA337  is devoid  of genotoxic  potential  in the full international  conference  on harmonization  
(ICH)  battery  of genotoxicity  assays.  The three  major  human  metabolites,  IV1197736,  IV1197347  
and IV1537661,  were  also found  devoid  of genotoxic  potential  in a bacterial  reverse  mutation  test 
and a mammalian  cell assay.  
IVA337  is devoid  of deleterious  effects  on vital functions  such as cardiovascular,  central  and 
autonomic  nervous  system  and respiratory  system.  In a 9-week  head-to-head comparative  study  in 
rats aimed  at evaluating  side effects  of PPAR  agonists  such as plasma  volume  expansion  and 
secondary  cardiac  hypertrophy,  or skeletal  muscle  toxicity,   daily   doses   of  IVA337   up  to 1000  
mg/kg  compared  favorably  with other  PPAR  agonists  rosiglitazone,  muraglitazar  and tesaglitazar.  
These  observations  were  substantiated  in repeated  dose toxicity  studies  with IVA337  in rats and 
monkeys.  
No potential  risks  have  been  identified from  pivotal  toxicology studies  with IVA337  in rat  and in 
monkey  and segment  II reproductive  toxicity  studies  in rats and rabbits.  All treatment -related  
findings  (i.e. liver,  bone  marrow,  adipose  tissue)  were  reversible.  
The safety  margins  over expected  human exposure  in general  toxicology studies were at  least 20 -
fold in rats and 3-fold in monkeys  (Table 2). The safety  margins  over expected  human  exposure  
established  in segment  II reproductive  toxicity  studies  were  9-fold in rats and 2-fold in rabbits  
(Table 3). A preliminary  2-week  pharmacokinetic  and toxicity  study  in the mouse,  where  plasma  
exposures  were  markedly  higher  than those  achieved  in volunteers  given  the highest  tested  dose 
of 1500  mg/day  for two weeks  (approximately  40-fold)  and higher  than those  achieved  in the 
chronic  rat study,  has evidenced  signs  of toxicity  for the kidney,  the heart  and the skeletal  muscles,  
in particular  myositis  of skeletal  muscles,  minimal  to moderate  myocarditis  and tubulo -interstitial  
nephritis.  These  organs  are known  targets  for toxicity  of PPAR  agonists.  However,  a recently  
conducted  13-week  study  in mice  established  an adequate  5-fold safety  margin  over expected  
human  exposure  at a NOAEL  (no observed  adverse  effects  levels)  of 25 mg/kg/day.

1.4.4 Previous  IVA337  Clinical  Data  
IVA337  has previously  been  in clinical  development  up to Phase  II for the treatment  of type 2 
diabetes.  The development  for diabetes  was discontinued  for strategic  reasons.  
Three  clinical  studies  have been  conducted  in healthy  subjects,  one study  in patients  with type 2 
diabetes,  and one Phase  II study  is ongoing  in the treatment  of diffuse  cutaneous  systemic  sclerosis.  
The objectives  of study  S337.1.001  were  to assess  pharmacokinetics,  pharmacodynamics,  safety  
and tolerability  of IVA337  after single  increasing  doses  and after multiple  increasing  doses.  The 
objectives  of study  S337.1.002  were  to study  the effect  of IVA337  on the pharmacokinetics  of 
simvastatin  and simvastatin  acid and to evaluate  the pharmacokinetics  of the two-crystalline  
anhydrous  solid  alpha  and beta forms  of IVA337.  The objectives  of study  S337.1.005  were  to 
assess  the relative  bioavailability  of IVA337  oral suspension  and capsules  (cross -over design),  and 
to assess,  in vivo in human,  the completeness  of excretion,  routes  and rates  of elimination  of 
radioactivity,  the metabolic  pathways,  and identity  of IVA337  metabolites  after single  
administration  of 14C-IVA337.  The objectives  of study  S337.2.001  were  to evaluate  the safety,  
tolerability,  pharmacokinetics  and pharmacodynamics  of IVA337  in doses  of 400 to 1200  mg daily  
over a 4-week  period.  The study  IVA_01_337_HSSC_15_001  is a randomized,  double - blind,  
placebo -controlled,  multicenter  proof -of-concept  trial of IVA337  in the treatment  of diffuse  
cutaneous  systemic  sclerosis  (DcSSc).  
The study  IVA_01_337_HNAS_16_002  is a randomized,  double -blind,  placebo - controlled,  
multicenter,  dose-range,  proof -of-concept,  24-week  treatment  study  of IVA337  in adult  subjects  with 
nonalcoholic  steatohepatitis  (NASH).  
In clinical  trials  performed  in healthy  volunteers  and patients  with type 2 diabetes,  IVA337  was 
safe and well  tolerated.  Treatments  included single  doses  of 25 mg to 1000  mg, multiple  doses  of 
150 mg to 1500  mg once  daily  for 14 consecutive  days,  and once  daily  doses  of 400, 800, and 1400  
mg for 4 weeks.  The reported  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  considered  to have  a causal  
relationship  to the study  drug included  dizziness,  postural  dizziness,  headache,  hot flush,  lethargy,  
somnolence,  constipation,  trends  towards  decreases  in red blood  cell count,  hemoglobin  and 
hematocrit  in healthy  volunteers,  and hypochromic  anemia,  constipation,  urinary  tract infection  
and headache  in patients  with type 2 diabetes.  There  were  no clinically  relevant  time or dose- 
related  changes  on cardiac  and muscle  markers,  liver enzymes  or markers  of renal  function.  The 
12-lead electrocardiogram  (ECG)  did not show  clinically  significant  changes.

 1.5 Rationale  of the Study  Design  
1.5.1 General  Considerations  
This study  is a Phase  II randomized,  double -blind,  placebo -controlled,  single -center,  investigator  
initiated,  24-week  treatment  study  of lanifibranor  in adult  subjects  with T2DM  and NAFLD.  
 
1.5.2 Rationale  for the Choice  of Dose  and Duration  of Repeated  Administration  
The evaluated  treatment  will be as tablets  of lanifibranor  400 mg, one dose of lanifibranor,  800 mg 
once  a day (QD)  versus  placebo,  i.e. two tablets  (lanifibranor  or indistinguishable  placebo)  per os, 
once  daily,  for 24 weeks.  To improve  bioavailability,  drug intake  is combined  with food.  
The dose has been  selected  based  on the available  biomarker  (adiponectin,  HDL  cholesterol,  
triglycerides)  results  in diabetes  type 2 patients  (Phase  IIa study):  800 mg per day: lowest  and 
statistically  significant  active  dose on the markers  of the three  PPAR  ,  and  activity  and being  
well tolerated  
Pharmacodynamic  biomarkers  of PPARs  activation  in diabetic  patients  (Phase  IIa study)  are shown  
in Figure 3. 
Clinical,  biological  and ECG  safety in healthy  volunteers  and diabetic  patients  has been  shown  to 
be good  up to the top dose used in this trial or at doses  that are higher.  There  is no toxicology  target  
organ  of major  concern  in the clinic.  
Placebo  is chosen as the comparator, as there is no licensed treatment for  NAFLD/NASH.  
Treatment duration  has been set to  6 months.  This is a Phase  II study  and the aim  to assess safety  
efficacy  and mechanism  of action.  Improvement  in ALT,  AST,  γGT as well as insulin  resistance  
can be observed  within  a couple  of months  of treatment,  as has been  observed  in several  trials  seen 
with other  PPARs  agonists  (1, 23), suggesting  that treatment  efficacy  can be observed  early  in the 
course  of treatment.  Significant  effect  on hepatic  steatosis  and necroinflammation  has been  
reported  before  at 6 months  with a PPARγ  agonist  (1). 
The study  imposes  10 visits  including  the screen  and follow -up visits  and, apart  periodic  blood  
sampling,  there  are no other  invasive  procedures.  There  is a very limited  number  of prohibited  
medications  that should  not interfere  with standard  medical  care of the patients.  
For obvious  reasons,  fibrates,  as they are PPARα  ligands,  are not allowed,  but dyslipidemias  can 
be treated  with statins,  which  are allowed.  
Half of the patients  is on verum  treatment  and can expect  an improvement  of their NAFLD  and 
metabolic  syndrome  based  on the results  of previous  clinical  studies  with PPARα,  γ and α/δ 
agonists.  The dose chosen  for the trial demonstrated  significant  improvement  in biomarkers  of 
PPAR α, γ and probably  δ in diabetic patients.

3 Ethical  and Legal Considerations  
The principal  investigator  will obtain  the approval  of the study  from  the Competent  Authority  (CA)  
and the Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)/Independent  Ethics  Committee  (IEC).  The IRB and CA 
receive  annual  safety  and interim  reports  and are informed  about  study  stop/end  in agreement  with 
local  requirements.  
 
 
3.1 Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)/Independent  Ethics  Committee  
(IEC)  
The Principal  Investigator  will submit  this protocol  to the University  of Florida  IRB,  and will 
forward  to the Inventiva  SA a copy  of the written  and dated  approval  (and annual  reapproval)  in 
order  to allow  delivery  of the treatment  units.  
The study  (study  number,  Protocol  title and version  number),  the documents  reviewed  (protocol,  
Informed  Consent  Form,  Investigator’s  brochure,  etc.) and the date of the review  should  be clearly  
stated  on the written  IRB approval.  All correspondence  with the IRB should  be retained  in the 
Investigator  File. 
Investigational  Medicinal  Product  will not be released  at the study  site and the trial will not start 
until a copy  of written  and dated  approval  favorable  opinion  has been received  by the Principal  
Investigator  and by Inventiva  S.A. 
Page  38 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
  
3.2 Protocol  Amendments  
Inventiva  S.A. will be informed  of any change  done  by the Principal  Investigator  
The change,  presented  as an amendment  in written  form  to the protocol,  will be signed  by the 
Investigator  and submitted  to the IRB and whenever  applicable  to the CA for their approval.  
The amendment  cannot  be acted  upon  prior  to the outcome  of this decision.  
Amendment  regarding  minor  modifications  (administrative  modifications)  will be submitted  to the 
IRB/IEC  for information  purposes  only and whenever  applicable  to CA. 
The only circumstance  in which  an amendment  may be initiated  prior  to IRB and CA approval  is 
where  the change  is necessary  to eliminate  apparent  immediate  hazards  to the patients.  In that 
event,  the investigator  must  notify  the IRB and Inventiva  S.A. in writing  immediately  after the 
implementation.  All updates  to the Investigator’s  Brochure,  Protocol  or any amendment -impacted  
documents  will be sent to the IRB/IEC  and CA whenever  applicable.  
If requested,  a progress  report  could  be sent to the IRB annually  and a summary  of the trial’s  
outcome  could  also be provided  at the end of the clinical  trial. 
 
3.3 Ethical  Conduct  of the Study  
This protocol  complies  with the principles  laid down  by the 64th World  Medical  Assembly  
(Fortaleza,  October  2013)  and all applicable  amendments  laid down  by the World  Medical  
Assemblies,  the guidelines  of Good  Clinical  Practice  CPMP/ICH/135/95  and applicable  
regulations,  and any other  relevant  local  requirement  and laws.  
 
3.4 Good  Clinical  Practice  Responsibilities  
The responsibilities  of the Principal  Investigator  will be as defined  in the ICH GCP  guidelines  and 
applicable  regulatory  requirements.  The Principal  Investigator  is responsible  for adhering  to the 
responsibilities  of investigators,  for dispensing  the IMP in accordance  with the final protocol  or an 
approved  amendment,  and for its secure  storage  and safe handling  throughout  the study.  
 
3.5 Reporting  of Safety  Issues  Breaches  of the Protocol  or ICH  GCP  
In the event  of any prohibition  or restriction  imposed  by an applicable  CA, or if the Principal  
Investigator  is aware of any information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and 
risks  of the IMP,  Inventiva  S.A. should  be informed  immediately.  
In addition,  the Principal  Investigator  will inform  Inventiva  S.A. immediately  of any urgency  
safety  measures  taken  by the Principal  Investigator  to protect  the study  patients  against  any 
immediate  hazard,  and of any serious  breaches  of this protocol  or of ICH GCP  that the Principal  
Investigator  becomes  aware  of. 
 
3.6 Insurance  
In case of a damage  or injury  occurring  to a patient  in association  with the IMP or the participation  
in the study,  the University  of Florida  has subscribed  for itself  and the Principal  Investigator  and 
the medical  team  working  in the clinical  trial to an insurance  policy  covering,  in its terms  and 
provisions,  their legal  liability  for injuries  caused  to participating  persons  and arising  out of this 
research  performed  strictly  in accordance  with the scientific  protocol  as well as with applicable  
law and professional  standards  » 
 
Page  39 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 3.7 Patient  Information  and Consent  
The Principal  Investigator  (according  to applicable  regulatory  requirements),  or a person  
designated  by the Investigator,  should  fully inform  the patient  of all pertinent  aspects  of the clinical  
trial including  the written  information  given  approval/favorable  opinion  by the Ethics  Committee  
(IRB/IEC).  
Prior  to a patient’s participation in the clinical trial,  the Informed  Consent Form  should  be signed  
and personally  dated  by the patient  and by the person  who conducted  the informed  consent  
discussion.  
The Informed  Consent  Form  used by the Investigator  for obtaining  the patient’s  informed  consent  
must  be reviewed  by Inventiva  S.A. prior  to submission  to the appropriate  IRB for 
approval/favorable  opinion.  
Signed  consent  forms  must  remain  in the Investigator  file and must  be available  for verification  by 
study  monitors  or authorized  regulatory  representatives  at any time.  
The patient  should  receive  a copy  of the signed  and dated  written  informed  consent  form.  Any 
amendments  to the written  information  will be provided  to the patients.  
 
3.8 Premature  Termination  
Both  the Principal  Investigator  and Inventiva  SA reserve  the right  to terminate  the study  at any 
time. Should  this become  necessary, the  procedures  will be agreed  after consultation  between the 
two parties.  In terminating  the study,  the Principal  Investigator  will ensure  that adequate  
consideration  is given  to the protection  of the best interests  of the patients.  
 
3.9 Definition  of End of the Trial  
End of trial is defined  as the last visit (Visit  10, planned  at the  end of  the 28 -day off-drug follow - 
up period),  of the last patient  as defined  in the protocol.  
 
4 Study  Objectives and Investigational  Plan  
4.1 Aim 
The primary  aim is to establish  the safety,  efficacy  and mechanism  of action  of lanifibranor  in 
patients  with NAFLD  and T2DM.  
Specifically,  to determine  if lanifibranor  decreases  IHTG  (primary  endpoint),  improves  hepatic  
insulin  sensitivity,  endogenous  (hepatic)  glucose  production,  gluconeogenesis  and de novo  
lipogenesis  (DNL).  This will be achieved  by using  a combination  of intravenously  infused  stable  
isotopes  and with the infusion  of a low- and high-dose insulin  infusion  during  a euglycemic  
hyperinsulinemic  clamp  (to quantify  insulin  action)  with indirect  calorimetry  (to measure  substrate  
oxidation).  In addition,  exploratory  analysis  with surrogate  plasma  biomarkers  and imaging  on 
changes  on liver fibrosis  with treatment  will be performed.  
 
4.2 Study  Design  
The study  is a two-arm (placebo,  lanifibranor  800 mg/day),  randomized  (1:1),  double -blind,  
placebo -controlled,  24-week  treatment  study.  There  is in addition  a non-obese  subject  control  
group  for the metabolic  and imaging  procedures.  
The study  will require  32 ± 4 weeks  (4-6 weeks  for run-in, 24 weeks  of treatment  and 4 weeks  
post-study  follow -up), with an estimated  recruitment  period  of 6 to 9 months.  
Patients  to be randomized:  34 allowing  for a 10% drop-out rate. 
The overall  study  design  is shown  in Figure 1.

 Study  Duration  and Procedures  
For each patient,  the research  study  will be divided  as follows:  
• Run-in period:  Screening  visit V1, DM medication  titration  V2, Baseline  studies  V3 and 
Randomization  V4. 
• Interim  V5 (4 weeks  after V4), Interim  V6 (8 weeks  after V4), Interim  V7 (12 weeks  after 
V4), Interim  V8 (16 weeks  after V4), Interim  V9 (20 weeks  after V4). 
• Repeat  baseline  studies  V10 (23 weeks  after V4) and V11 (24 weeks  after V4). 
• Off-drug Follow -up visit V12 (28 weeks  after V4). 
 
4.2.1 Screening  Phase  
We plan to recruit  patients  with uncontrolled  T2DM  and a diagnosis  of “fatty  liver”  per history  
(elevated  AST/ALT  and/or  liver fat on liver ultrasound  or ¹H-MRS  and/or  other  appropriate  
imaging  technique  – see below).  A Fibroscan  study  available  in the research  unit will be performed  
at the initial  screen  visit.  
CAP  test (Fibroscan:  ultrasound -based  elastography  available  in the PI’s outpatient  clinic  and also 
research unit) will be performed at the initial  screening visit  to identify those patients  with a fatty 
liver.  
The goal of the screening  is therefore  to check  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria  and adjust  T2DM  
treatment  as described  below.  
Participants  may be treated  by diet only,  or be on a stable  dose of metformin  and/or  a sulfonylurea  
and/or  a DPP-IV inhibitor  for ≥ 2 months  prior  to enrollment.  If the HbA1c  is ≤8.0%  on any of 
these  diabetes  medications,  the dose of these  medications  will be kept stable  throughout  the study  
and baseline  studies  performed as outlined  below. If the HbA1c is > 8.0%  but ≤ 9.5%, metformin  
(minimum  dose required:  1,000  mg/day  for metformin)  and/or  a sulfonylurea  (minimum  dose 
required:  glimepiride  2 mg once  daily)  will be added,  or doses  maximized,  during  the first 2 weeks  
of the lead-in period.  The baseline  visit to initiate  lanifibranor  (V4; Time  0 or randomization  visit)  
will be not sooner than 8 weeks from  diabetes medication titration and the patient should have an 
HbA1c  ≤9.0%  to proceed  to randomization  (V4).  In addition,  if both metformin  and glimepiride  
(or another  sulfonylurea)  are already  maximized  at study  entry  (or the patient  is intolerant  to either)  
and the HbA1c  ≥ 9.0%  but ≤9.5%,  we will add sitagliptin  100 mg daily  (or an equivalent  dose of 
another  DPP-IV inhibitor) to reach an HbA1c ≤9.0%  to proceed to randomization (V4).  
Afterwards,  patient’s  metformin  and/or  sulfonylurea  dose and/or  sitagliptin  dose will be 
maintained  at the new stable  dose.  The baseline  visit to initiate  lanifibranor  (V0; Time  0 or 
randomization  visit)  will be not sooner  than 8 weeks  from  diabetes  medication  titration  and the 
patient  should  have  a HbA 1c ≤9.0%  to proceed  to randomization  (V0).  
Of note,  due to COVID -19 pandemic , in order  to be able to accomm odate the follow-up study 
procedures (i.e. liver MRI at V10 and insulin  clamp at V11), for already enrolled subjects, treatme nt 
may have to be extended by one week  up to no longer  than 8 weeks.  
4.2.1.1  Intrahepatic  Triglycerides  (IHTG)  
This will be the primary  endpoint  as assessed  by ¹H-MRS  (to be performed  at Day -7). 
4.2.1.2  Metabolic  Studies  
As in prior  trials by our group  (1,2,9,10) to be done between  Days -7 and 0. 
• Determination  of hepatic  insulin  sensitivity,  gluconeogenesis,  and DNL.  As described  
below,  this will be done  with use of labeled  glucose,  deuterium  labeled  water  (D2O).  
Combined  with a low- and high- dose insulin  infusion  during  the euglycemic  
hyperinsulinemic  clamp  (to assess  hepatic,  muscle  and adipose  tissue  insulin  sensitivity)  
(see Appendix  D) with standard  stable  isotopes  to measure  glucose  and lipid turnover  and 
Page  41 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 substrate  oxidation  (with  indirect  calorimetry).  
• Glycemic  control:  HbA1c  (Day  0). 
• Biomarkers  of adipose  tissue  metabolism  (i.e., plasma  adiponectin  and adipokine  panels  
measured  by the gold-standard  Millipore  multiplex  platform).  (Day  0) 
4.2.1.3  Surrogate  Imaging  and Plasma  Biomarkers  of Hepatic  
These  will be measured  by several  techniques:  
• Vibration -controlled  transient  elastography  (Fibroscan)  (3): (Day -42) 
• Two-dimensional  magnetic  resonance  elastography  (MRE)  (4). To be done  during  the 
IHTG  ¹H-MRS  measurement.  To be done  at Day -7. 
• T1 MRI mapping  (5): To be done  at Day -7. 
• Plasma  biomarkers  of liver fibrosis:  Established  (cytokeratin  CK-18, plasma  pro-C3 To 
be done  between.  Day – 7 and Day 0. 
4.2.1.4  Genetic  Markers  
Performed  to assess  potential  subgroups  (“responders”)  to lanifibranor  response  (PNPLA3,  
TM6SF2,  others).  To be done  at Day -7. 
4.2.1.5  Description  of Methods  
Liver  ¹H-MRS  , 2D-MRE  and T1 MRI  mapping:  Between  days -14 and 0, subjects  will be 
invited  to come  to the National  High  Magnetic  Field  Laboratory  at our university  where  the 3T 
magnet  is located to  have liver fat (IHTG)  and liver fibrosis  (by 2D-MRE  and T1 MRI mapping)  
measured  after at least a 3 hour fast. 
Admission  for the determination  of hepatic  insulin  sensitivity,  gluconeogenesis,  and de novo  
lipogenesis  (DNL):  Between  Day -7 and 0 (to allow  scheduling  flexibility),  subjects  will be 
admitted  to the research  unit in the afternoon  (4:00PM).  Glucose  and metabolism  and DNL  rates  
will be measured  as reported  in the literature  before  (1,2,9,10,12). In brief, patients  will receive  a 
standardized  dinner  and will fast overnight  for at least 10 hours.  Subjects  will be given  an oral 
dose (350 ml) of 70% deuterium  labeled  water  (D2O),  between  5 PM and midnight  and prior  to 
the metabolic  experiments  on the next day. After  6:00 PM, no calories  or caffeine  will be allowed  
until the end of the study  on day 2. Non-caloric  beverages  will be allowed.  
If you are unable  or unwilling  to spend  the night  in the hospital,  there  is a possibility  to perform  
this test without  the overnight  stay. You will still need  to come  to the CRC  the day before  the 
procedure  at ~4:00  to 7:00PM to have a blood  test done  and receive  the heavy  water  that you will 
drink  at home  (following  the same  instructions  as if you were  admitted).  If you choose  not to stay 
overnight  you will need a driver  the day of the procedure  as the heavy  water  can produce  some  
dizziness.  
The day of the procedure  we will start at ~5:00 -6:00AM.  A bolus  of [6,6-2H2]  glucose  (4.8 mg/kg  
body  weight)  will be given  at 6:00 AM on day 2 followed  by a constant  infusion  (0.08  mg/kg  body  
weight/min)  until the end of the study.  Indirect  calorimetry  will be performed  with a ventilated  
hood  starting  at 8:00 AM on day 2 and at regular  intervals.  Baseline  endogenous  glucose  
production  (EGP)  will be measured  150-180 minutes  after starting  [6,6-2H2]  glucose  to allow  time 
for steady  state enrichment  of plasma  glucose  following  standard  principles  of stable  isotope  
dilution  techniques.  After  baseline  glucose  and lipid turnover  measurements,  subjects  will undergo  
a two-step euglycemic  insulin  clamp  with a low- and high-dose insulin  infusion  combined  with 
substrate  oxidation  determinations  (i.e., indirect  calorimetry)  (see Appendix  D). 
4.2.2 Intervention  Period  (24 weeks)  
4.2.2.1  Intrahepatic  Triglycerides  (IHTG)  
This will be the primary  endpoint  as assessed  by ¹H-MRS  (to be performed  at V10).  
Page  42 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 4.2.2.2  Metabolic  Studies  
As in prior  trials  (1,2,6) to be done  atV11.  
• Determination  of hepatic insulin sensitivity, gluconeogenesis,  DNL. As described below,  
this will be done  with use of labeled  glucose,  deuterium  labeled  water  (D2O).  Combined  
with a low- and high- dose insulin  infusion  during  the euglycemic  hyperinsulinemic  clamp  
(to assess  hepatic,  muscle  and adipose  tissue  insulin  sensitivity)  with standard  stable  
isotopes  to measure  glucose  and lipid turnover  and substrate  oxidation  (with  indirect  
calorimetry).  
• Glycemic  control:  HbA1c,  advanced  lipid testing.  (V11).  
• Biomarkers  of adipose  tissue  metabolism  (i.e., plasma  adiponectin  and adipokine  panels  
measured  by the gold-standard  Millipore  multiplex  platform).  (V11).  
4.2.2.3  Surrogate  Imaging  and Plasma  Biomarkers  of Hepatic  Fibrosis  
These  will be measured  by several  techniques:  
• Vibration -controlled  transient  elastography  (Fibroscan)  (3): An established  technique  that 
allows  to monitor  fibrosis  non-invasively  at the bedside  and outpatient  setting.  (V11).  
• Two-dimensional  magnetic  resonance  elastography  (MRE)  (4). To be done  during  the 
IHTG  ¹H-MRS  measurement.  To be done  at V10.  
• T1 MRI mapping  (5): A novel  scanning  protocol  that allows  for a complementary  non- 
invasive  measurement  of liver fibrosis  (in collaboration  with the Oxford  laboratory  of R. 
Banerjee  et al). To be done  at V10.  
• Plasma  biomarkers  of liver fibrosis:  Established  (cytokeratin  CK-18, HA, TIMP -1) and 
novel  (pro-C3) plasma  will be tested  to gain insights  into the role of treatment  on liver 
fibrosis  using  surrogate  markers  of disease.  To be done  at V11.  
4.2.3 Off-study  Drug  Follow -up Period  (4 weeks)  
After  all 24 week  procedures,  a 4-week  safety  period  of observation  will follow  to ensure  that 
patients  are stable  and the patient  has a follow -up with their PCP and/or  endocrinologist.  
4.2.4 Patient  Management  at the End of Treatment  
The trial treatment  is stopped  after V11.  
After  the follow -up, the investigator/hepatologists/general  practitioner  will decide,  according  to 
each patient,  the need  to use the lifestyle  changes  recommendations  whenever  appropriate  and 
treatment  of comorbidi ties. 
If the study  is positive  there  will be further  trials  for which  these  patients  may be eligible.  
4.2.5 Total  Study  Duration  
The total time (from  first patient  enrolled  to last patient  finished)  will be 32±4  weeks  (4-6 weeks  
for run-in, 24 weeks  of treatment  and 4 weeks  post-study  follow -up), with an estimated  recruitment  
period  of 32-40 weeks  (conservatively  set at ~1-2 patients  per week,  including  about  30% of 
patients  that will not qualify  [n=16 -20] and about  10 % dropouts/intolerant  to lanifibranor  that 
require  additional  recruitment  [n=8].  
Of note,  due to COVID -19 pandemic , in order  to be able to accomm odate the follow-up study 
procedures (i.e. liver MRI at V10 and insulin  clamp at V11), for already enrolled subjects, treatme nt 
may have to be extended by one week  up to no longer  than 8 weeks. After all procedures are 
completed and subjects are off drug,  an additi onal 4-week  safety  period  of observation will follow  as 
specified in section 4.2.3 .

 4.3 Study  Population  and Inclusion/Non -inclusion  Criteria  
We propose  to randomize  34 otherwise  healthy  overweight  or obese  patients  with uncontrolled  
T2DM  (HbA1c ≥ 6.0% to ≤ 9.5%)  and NAFLD  on imaging (see section  8). 
Ten healthy  non-obese  subjects  without  NAFLD  will also be studied  as “normal  controls”  for all 
the metabolic  and imaging  tests to be performed  (V1, V3 and V4). We will study  them  only to 
examine  the response  of a person  without  diabetes  to the study  tests to be performed  in the patients  
with type 2 diabetes  who are participating  in the clinical  trial. In other  words,  they will be a 
“healthy  control”  to compare  the results  of blood  tests,  metabolic  studies  and imaging  studies  to 
be done  in patients  with diabetes  participating  in the study.  Inclusion/Exclusion  for the healthy  
controls  will follow  those  noted  in the protocol  for patients  with diabetes  receiving  treatment  
except  that they will not have  Type  2 diabetes  based  on a hemoglobin  A1c and will be non-obese,  
BMI < 30 kg/m2. 
The diagnosis of NAFLD  on imaging will be done  by measuring intrahepatic  triglyceride  content  
(IHTG)  using  the gold-standard  magnetic  resonance  and spectroscopy  (¹H-MRS)  technique.  
Pregnant  women,  prisoners,  institutionalized  individuals,  or others  who may be considered  
vulnerable  populations  will be excluded.  The ethnic  mix will reflect  the base population  in the 
North  Florida/Alachua  County  area is 70-75% Caucasian,  15-20% African -American,  5-10% 
Hispanic,  and 5% other  ethnicities.  We will only study  otherwise  healthy  subjects  with T2DM  
based  on medical  history,  physical  exam,  and blood  chemistries  and hematologic  tests.  Body  
weight  (≤ 5%) and physical  activity  should  have  been  stable  for at least 3 months.  After  informed  
consent  has been  obtained,  each subject  will undergo  screening  evaluations  within  the 4-6 weeks  
prior  to the planned  first double -blind  study  drug dose.  Subjects  may be eligible  for randomization

secobarbital). However, if medically necessary, these trea tments can be administered for a 
single intake, occasionally .  
• CYP2C8 strong inhibitors, when systemically administered, i.e. by oral, intra -venous or 
intra-muscular route of administration (e.g. gemfibrozil, clopidogrel, felodipine, 
zafirlukast, candesart an celixetil, ketoconazole).  
 
Allowable  medications  for standard  care or precautions:  
• Obesity : stable  weight  defined  by no more  than a change  of >5%  in the 3 months  prior  to 
enrollment  (see exclusion  criteria  N° 3). 
• Treatment  used for the underlying  medical  conditions:  
Treatments  are allowed  within  certain  restrictions  (described  above  and below)  and 
provided  that they have  been  kept at stable  doses  for at least 2 months  before  inclusion   
in the study . 
o Type  2 diabetes:  
Page  47 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 • Metformin,  
• Sulfonylureas,  
• Dipeptidyl  peptidase -4 inhibitors,  
• Sodium -glucose  transport  protein  2 inhibitors:  canagliflozin,  dapagliflozin  
and empagliflozin.  
o Hyperlipidemia : only statins  at stable  doses  will be allowed.  
o Antiplatelets  agents:  The antiplatelets  agents  (incl.  low-dose aspirin,  ticlopidine,  
clopidogrel,  prasugrel,  ticagrelor)  are allowed.  
o Herbal  supplements:  Herbal  preparations  or vitamin  supplements  should  not be 
taken  as it is difficult  to know  exactly  what  they contain  and could  be liver toxic.  
• Other  Medications  
Medications  other  than the IMP and those  mentioned  above  must  only be taken  
exceptionally  and with the agreement  of the investigator  in order  to avoid  interference  
with study  assessments.  The need  for other  medication  may lead to exclusion  of the 
patient  from  the study.  
If symptomatic  medication  is needed  to treat adverse  events  related  to IMP,  the 
investigator  will inform  the Principal  Investigator  about  the concomitant  medication  
given.  
4.3.4 Enrollment  
If a patient  is not eligible,  the main  reason  for non-inclusion  will be documented  in the source  
document  and the screening  log. After  eligibility  is confirmed,  patients  will be assigned  a treatment  
number.  Treatment  numbers  will be allocated  in ascending  order,  the order  in which  patients  are 
included.  The investigator  or a staff member  will enter  the patient  initials  and number  in a web- 
based  electronic  case report  form  (eCRF),  the confidential  patient  identification  list and the drug 
dispensing  log. 
 
 
4.4 Study  Medication  
4.4.1 Identity  of Investigational  Medicinal  Product(s)  (IMP)  
The lanifibranor  tablets  and placebo  to match  (PTM)  are white  to off-white,  oval shape,  bi-convex,  
film-coated  tablets:  
• Each  active  tablet  contains  400 mg of the active  substance  lanifibranor  in an immediate  
release  formulation.  The chemical  name  of the active  substance  is (4-[1-(1,3-benzothiazol - 
6-ylsulfonyl) -5-chloro -1H-indol -2-yl]butanoic  acid).  
• The placebo  tablet  contains  a physical  mixture  of lactose  monohydrate,  microcrystalline  
cellulose,  and pre-gelatinized  starch  and magnesium  stearate.  
 
4.4.2 Treatments  Administered  
This double  blinded  placebo -controlled  study  involves  a therapeutic  dose of 800 mg lanifibranor  
(QD).  
The lanifibranor  tablets  and PTM  are packaged  into round  high-density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  
bottles  containing  38 tablets  for a treatment  period  of one month,  plus a use margin  of 1 week  with 
proper  closures  fitted  with a silicagel  cartridge.  Two bottles  each (either  active  or placebo)  are 
assembled  in a carton  to compose  monthly  Kits as detailed  below:  
• Placebo  Kit: Morning  (P+P)  
• 800 mg Kit: Morning  (A+A)  
Page  48 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 Where  P denotes  the placebo  tablet  and A denotes  the active  tablet  (400 mg). 
A total of 6 monthly  patient  kits (2 HDPE  Bottles  of 38 tablets  each)  is representing  the treatment  
per patient  for the clinical  study.  
 
4.4.3 Medication  Dispensing  
4.4.3.1  Medication  Dispensing  
The patients  receive  3 monthly  patient  kits at V4 and 3 monthly  patient  kits at V6. They  are 
instructed  to take morning  2 tablets  with food,  i.e. one tablet  from  either  the one of the two 
containers.  The overall  treatment  duration  is 24 weeks.  However,  due to COVID -19 pandemic , in 
order to be able to accommodate the follow-up study  procedures (i.e. liver MRI at V10 and insulin  
clamp at V11),  for already enrolled subjects, treatment  may have to be extended  by one week  up to 
no longer  than 8 weeks. Additional  medicati on dispensing, if necessary, will be done  as part of an 
unschedule d follow-up visit.  
Dosage  modifications  are not permitted.  Should  the patient  or the investigator  for any reason  wish 
to discontinue  treatment,  they may do so at any time.  The date of the last dose and any dosage  
modifications  by the patient  are documented  in the eCRF.  
 
4.4.4 Selection  and Timing  of Dose  for Each  Patient  
Patients  will be randomized  equally  1:1: to either  dose of lanifibranor  or placebo.  
The randomization  list will be setup  with blocs  of size equal  to 4. 
The randomization  list will be produced  by a statistician  of Keyrus  Biopharma  according  to their 
SOPs  and will be used to prepare  the medication  accordingly.  Each  eligible  subject  will be 
randomized  to placebo  or lanifibranor  according  to the randomization  scheme  at the time of 
randomization  visit (V4).  
Treatment  numbers  will be allocated  in ascending  order  using  the next available  consecutive  
number.  
One copy  of this list will be sent to the company  responsible  for manufacturing  and labelling  of 
the treatment  (AMATSI)  and another  blind  copy  will be sent to the investigator.  These  copies  will 
be stored  in confidential  manner  up to the unblinding  after database  lock.  
The blind  copy  will contain  three  additional  columns  and the investigator  will have to complete  
the columns  “Randomization  date”,  “Patient  number”  and “Investigator  initials”  after each 
randomization.  
Two separate  sealed envelopes  (one for the investigator,  one for STRAGEN)  will be prepared  by 
Keyrus  Biopharma.  These  individual  envelopes  will contain  the identity  of the study  medication  
allocated  to the patient  in case of emergency  (see §9.2.1).  
 
4.4.5 Labeling  
Packaging  and labeling is  performed  by Amatsi  group,  17 Rue des Vautes,  34980  Saint -Gély -du- 
Fesc,  France  Phone: +33 (0) 4 99 58 38 60. 
The immediate  containers  (bottles)  and the outer  packaging  (medication  boxes)  will contain  the 
information  required  by national  regulations.

4.4.6 Accountability  
The investigator  will maintain  accountability  records  showing  the quantities  of IMP received  at 
the study  site and dispensed  to each patient.  Any unused  IMP,  including  empty  or partially  used 
containers,  will be accounted  for and then destroyed.  At the time of destruction,  the investigator  
must verify  that all unused or partially used investigational  medicinal  product  supplies have  been 
returned  by the clinical  study  subject  and that no remaining  supplies  are in the investigator's  
possession.  
 
4.4.7 Treatment  Compliance  
The investigator  will maintain  accountability  records  showing  the quantities  of IMP received  at 
the study  site and dispensed  to each patient.  Any unused  IMP,  including  empty  or partially  used 
containers,  will be accounted  for and then destroyed.  Treatment  Compliance  
The following  means  will be taken  to improve  compliance  to treatment:  
• the investigator  will attempt  to select  patients  able to understand  and to comply  with 
instructions,  
• the patient  should  be instructed  to return  containers  at the end of the treatment  period,  
• remaining  tablets  will be counted  by the Site Coordinator  and recorded  in the eCRF  
 
4.4.8 Return  or Destruction  of Investigational  Products  
The products  are collected  by the Principal  Investigator  at the end of the study  and are thereafter  
destroyed.  
 
 
5 Measurements  Assessed and  Study  Flow Chart  
The following  section  presents  the assessments  performed  at each visit.  Target  dates  are ±5 days 
compared  to V1. 
 
5.1 Table  of Study  Procedures  and Assessments  
A table  is provided  in the Schedule  of Study  Procedures  (Table 1). 
 
 
5.2 Specific  Procedures  for Assessment  of Outcomes  
Safety  laboratories  should  be monitored  by a central  laboratory  in real time with potential  DILI  
alerts  sent to the investigator.  
If patient  lives in a remote  area,  testing  can be performed  locally  and the results  communicated  to 
the investigator  site promptly.  
5.2.1 Urine  Samples  
Urine  Samples  will be collected  at V1, V11 and V12.  
Urine  Pregnancy  test will  be performed  at V1, V4,  V7, V9, V11 and V12.  
Urine  specimens will be  obtained  by providing  participants  with a collection  cup and instructions  
for collecting  as described  in the sampling  kit supplied  by the hospital  laboratory.  
Safety  assessments  may be performed  on the urine  samples  in case of renal  function  impairment  
is observed  during  the study.  Increase  of 50 % or 1.5. Albuminuria  and other  biomarker  like 
cystatin  C will be tested,  and aliquots  of urine  samples  will be stored  in case where  a urine  
Page  51 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 biomarker  specific  of NAFLD  would  be validated  during  the study.  
The tube labels  need  to contain  the following  information:  Study  Site, Subject  Number,  Day,  Time,  
Visit  number  
All urines  samples  will be destroyed  by the hospital  laboratory  at the end of a scheduled  storage  
period  (1 year after the end of the study).  
 
5.2.2 Blood  Samples  Taken  
Blood  sample  taken  are performed  at V1 (screening),  V4 (randomization),  V5, V6, V7, V8, V9, 
V11 and V12 (Follow -up). 
Total  blood  volume  sampled  during  the study  for each patient  (for, biomarkers,  safety  and efficacy  
biological  tests)  will be as follows:

OVERALL  TOTAL:  471.5  ml 
Attention  must  be paid to the kind of blood  sample  required  as they vary between  visits.  
For the monitoring  of the individual  subject,  each sample  should  be collected  under  the same  
conditions  (e.g. time ± 1h) as the baseline  sample.  This is to overcome  the effects  of the circadian  
variation  of the biomarkers  measured.  
All blood  samples  will be destroyed  by the laboratory  at the end of a scheduled  storage  period  (1 
year after the end of the study).  
 
5.2.3 Waist  Measurement  
The Waist measurement must be done  at midway between the top of the hip bone  and the bottom  
of the ribs during  a normal breath -out (Appendix  B: Methods  and Normal Values for Vital  Signs,  
Waist  and ECG).

5.2.4 Electrocardiogram  
12-lead ECGs  will be performed  at Screening  (V1),  and the end-of-treatment  visit (V11).  
 
5.2.5 Vital  Signs  
Blood  pressure  will be measured  by using  a sphygmomanometer.  The results  will be recorded  in 
millimeters  of mercury  (mmHg).  Pulse  rate will be measured  for 30 seconds  and will be recorded  
as beats/minute.  Blood  pressure  and pulse  will be measured  lying  after at least a 10-minute  rest. 
 
5.3 Procedures  at Each  Visit  
5.3.1 Screening  (V1) 
The Principal  Investigator  invites  the potential  patients  to participate  to the study  according  to the 
patient’s  medical  records.  Both  will go through  the informed  consent  and the Principal  Investigator  
answers  to any question  the patient  would  have.  
The patient  is given  enough  time to discuss  his/her  participation  to the study  with his/her  family,  
friends  and family  doctor.  
The patient  is asked  to date and sign the “Informed  consent  form”,  prior  to any study  procedure.  
Screening  (V1) procedures  are listed  on the “Study  Schedule  of Procedures”.  (see Table 1) 
Medical  history  including  concomitant  medication  is reviewed.  
Physical  examination  (vital  signs,  weight,  height  and waist  measurement)  is performed.  
12-lead ECG,  routine  chemistries  (CBC,  CMP,  lipids,  CPK,  CPK -MB, HbA1c)  and urinalysis  
(including  urine  pregnancy  test) are performed.  
TSH,  free T4, not necessary  if available  within  the past 12 months.  
Fibroscan  procedures:  CAP  and VCTE  are performed.  
In subjects  with abnormal  labs, baseline  measure  (BLM)  should  be determined  by 2 separate  
measurements  obtained  approximately  approximately  4 weeks  apart.  To be eligible  for study  entry,  
the differences  in the levels  of those  repeat  measures  of baseline  serum  AST,  ALT,  ALP,  and total 
bilirubin  should  be small  (<20%).  
Subjects  with an HbA1c  > 8.0%  but ≤ 9.5%  will have  their metformin  (minimum  dose required:  
1,000  mg/day  for metformin)  maximized  to 1,000  mg BID and/or  glimepiride  2 mg once  daily  
added  during  the first 2 weeks  of the run-in period.  
In addition,  if both metformin  and glimepiride  (or another  sulfonylurea)  are already  maximized  at 
study  entry  (or the patient  is intolerant  to either)  and the HbA1c  is ≥ 9.0%  but ≤9.5%,  sitagliptin  
100 mg daily  (or an equivalent  dose of another  DPP-IV inhibitor)  will be added.  
All patients  on concomitant  anti-diabetic  medications  should  have,  or be provided  with,  a glucose  
monitor  and instructions  for its use. Fasting  blood  glucose  and spontaneous  measurements  in the 
event  of suspected  hypoglycemia  should  be routinely  monitored  by the patient  and values  should  
be recorded  (in their glucose  monitoring  device  or diaries)  to be discussed  at each visit with study  
staff.  Patients  will be instructed  on actions  to take in the event  of hypoglycemia  in accordance  with 
standard  of care.  
Finally,  eligibility  criteria  are reviewed  and if the patient  is eligible,  the next visit should  take place  
within  2 weeks  +/- 5 days.

5.3.2 Medication  Titration  (V2) at Week  -4 
The assessments  performed  are listed  on the “Study  Schedule  of Procedures”  (see Table 1). 
The key procedure  at this visit is the DM medication  titration  done  by staff,  with assessment  
including  a fasting  fingerstick  glucose  procedure.  
AEs,  if any occurred  since  the previous  visit,  are reported.  Please  refer to section  6 for AEs 
reporting.  
 
5.3.3 Baseline  Visit  (V3) at Week  -1 
The procedures  are listed  on the “Study  Schedule  of Procedures”  (see Table 1). 
Liver  imaging:  liver fibrosis  (MRE)  and T1 MR mapping  and liver IHTG  content  are performed.  
AEs,  if any occurred  since  the previous  visit,  are reported.  Please  refer to section  6 for AEs 
reporting.  
 
5.3.4 Randomization  Time  0 (V4) 
The assessments  to be performed  are listed  on the “Study  Schedule  of Procedures”.  (see Table 1) 
At this visit,  the eligibility  of the patient  is confirmed  (inclusion/exclusion  criteria).  
Patient  will be admitted  to the CRC  (clinical  research  unit) including  overnight  stay. 
Inpatient  metabolic  testing  will be performed:  insulin  sensitivity  study,  DNL  and GNG.  
Blood  sampling  using  kits and instructions  provided  will be done  for safety  and efficacy  purposes.  
Blood  samples  will be taken  in the morning  after overnight  fasting.  The patient  must  be fasting  
overnight  from  10:00  pm. 
AEs,  if any occurred  since  the last visit,  are reported.  Please  refer to section  6 for AEs reporting  
Concomitant  medications  are also reported.  
The patients  are then randomized  and receive  3 monthly  patient  kits of medication.  Each  kit will 
contain  2 bottles.  Each  kit contains  4-weeks  plus 1-week  margin  of tablets.  
Patients  are carefully  instructed  to take morning  2 tablets  with food,  i.e. one tablet  from  either  
container.  
Patients  are also carefully  instructed  to come  back  to the site in case of symptoms  of dyspnea,  
edema,  or a presumptive  diagnosis  of heart  failure.  NT-proBNP  should  be measured  as close  to 
the event  as possible.  They  will also be instructed  to call the investigator  in case of new or 
worsening  symptoms  of clinical  hepatitis,  including  loss of appetite,  fatigue,  mild fever,  muscle  or 
joint aches,  nausea  and vomiting.  This will be reminded  to them  at each subsequent  visit.  Patients  
and caregivers  accompanying  them  during  the study  visits  will receive  education  for potential  
symptoms  of adverse  effects  that should  be reported  to the investigators,  such as skeletal  muscle  
pain,  weight  gain,  peripheral  edema,  shortness  of breath,  or new or worsening  symptoms  of clinical  
hepatitis  (RUQ  pain,  dark urine,  extreme  fatigue,  nausea  and vomiting),  mild fever,  etc. These  
will be asked  and recorded  at each visit.  
Important  is to remind  the patients,  to bring  back  the unused  medication  at each visit.  
 
5.3.5 Follow -up Visits  (V5) at Week  4, (V6)  at Week  8, (V7)  at Week  12, (V8) at Week  
16 and (V9) at week 20 
The assessments  to be performed  are listed  on the “Study  Schedule  of Procedures” . (see Table 1) 
Please  note that the follow -up visits  are not at regular  intervals  and the assessments  vary from  one 
Page  54 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 visit to the next.  
Blood  sampling  using  kits and instructions  provided  will be done  for safety  and efficacy  
purposes.If  subjects  develop  elevations  of AST or ALT  > 2 times  baseline  measure  or total 
bilirubin  > 1.5 times  BLM  while  on study,  testing  should  be repeated  within  48 to 72 hours.  
Persistent  elevations  should  be followed  by repeat  testing  and physical  examination  2-3 times  per 
week  with or without  drug discontinuation.  
AEs,  if any occurred  since  the previous  visit,  are reported.  Please  refer to section  6 for AEs 
reporting.  At each visit,  the investigator will  ask the patients  on the occurrence  of skeletal muscle  
pain or joint aches,  peripheral  edema,  shortness  of breath,  loss of appetite,  fatigue,  mild fever,  
nausea  and vomiting  since  last visit.  
Concomitant  medications  are recorded.  
If 2 months  after randomization,  i.e. (V6) at Week  8, sitagliptin  100 mg/day  will be added  the 
HbA1c  exceeds  ≥9.5%.  If the subject  is already  on sitagliptin  (or an equivalent  dose of another  
DPP-IV inhibitor),  or has a history  of intolerance  to DPP-IV inhibitors,  bedtime  long-acting  insulin  
Lantus  at 0.3 units/kg  will be started  and titrated  aiming  to keep  the fasting  plasma  glucose  below  
120 mg/dL.  If at 4 months,  i.e. (V8) at Week  16, the HbA1c  remains  ≥9.5%  and the patient  is 
already  on maximal  doses  of metformin,  sulfonyurea  and sitagliptin,  as well as on insulin,  the 
patient  will be discontinued  from  the study  due to non-adherence  to therapy.  
At V7, patient  receives  3 monthly  patient  kits of medication.  Each  kit will contain  2 bottles. Each  
kit contains  4-weeks  plus 1-week  margin  of tablets.  
For affected  subjects  due to COVID -19 pandemic,  in case drug treatment  has to be extended  for 
1-8 weeks,  additional  safety  labs (CBC,  CMP,  CK, and lipase)  if not available  in the past 8 weeks,  
will have  to be re-collected  prior  to the treatment  extension.  Additional  medication  dispensing  if 
needed  will be performed  in an unscheduled  visit.  If any adverse  reaction  occur  during  this period  
patient  will be seen in an unscheduled  visit as needed.  
5.3.6 Repeat Baseline Studies (V10) at Week  23 and at (V11) at Week 24 
The assessments  to be performed  are listed  on the “Study  Schedule  of Procedures”  (see Table 1). 
The assessments  are different  in V10 and V11 (see below).  
Blood  sampling  using  kits and instructions  provided  will be performed  for safety  and efficacy  
purposes.  
Key procedures  at each visit are the following:  
At (V10)  liver imaging:  liver fibrosis  (MRE)  and T1 MR mapping  and liver IHTG  content  are 
performed.  
At (V11)  patient  will be admitted  to the CRC  (research  unit)  including  an overnight  stay. 
Inpatient  metabolic  testing  is performed:  including  HbA1c,  insulin  sensitivity  study,  DNL  and 
GNG.  
AEs,  if any occurred  since  the previous  visit,  are reported.  Please  refer to section  6 for AEs 
reporting.  
Concomitant  medications  are recorded.  
As already  noted,  due to COVID -19 pandemic , for already enrolled subject s, the liver MRI at V10 
and insulin  clamp  at V11 may have to be complete d out of window  by one week  and up no longer  
than eight  weeks.  
 
5.3.7 Off-Drug  Follow -up (V12)  at Week  28 
This last patient’s  visit includes:  concomitant  medications  and AEs reporting,  vital signs,  routine  
Page  55 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 chemistries,  urinalysis  and urinary  pregnancy  test among  other  assessments.  
All the assessments to be  performed  are listed  on the “Study  Schedule  of Procedures”. (see Table 
1). 
For those  subjects  where  the course  of the study  was affected  by the COVID -19 pandemic , and 
treatment  was extended  for no longer  than 1-8 weeks,  the final off-drug follow-up visit 12 will be 
performed 4 weeks after stopping the study  drug.  
 
5.3.8 Unscheduled/Safety  Visits  
During  the all treatment  and the follow -up period,  the investigator  may conduct  unscheduled  visit 
that may perform  again  study  procedures,  including  vital signs  assessments,  blood  sample  taken  
and physical  examination. These visits will have  to be motivated by the investigator  in the aim of 
guarantee  the safety  of the patients.  
Specific  events  listed  below  will automatically  generate  an unscheduled/safety  visit:  
- If patients  develop  elevations  of AST  or ALT  > 2 times  baseline  measure  or total bilirubin  
> 1.5 times  BLM  while  on study,  testing  should  be repeated  within  48 to 72 hours.  
Persistent  elevations  should  be followed  by repeat  testing  and physical  examination  2-3 
times  per week  with or without  drug discontinuation.  
- If a patient  has symptoms  of dyspnea,  edema,  or a presumptive  diagnosis  of heart  failure,  
NT-proBNP  should  be measured  as close  to the event  as possible.  
- Asymptomatic  subjects  with lipase  values  above  1.3X  ULN  (if not on a DPP-IV inhibitor)  or 
>2.0X  ULN  if taking  a DPP-IV  inhibitor,  will be retested  within  7 days without  drug 
interruption.  Should  retest  values  return  to below  inclusion  criteria , the drug may be 
continued.  If retest  values  are > ULN  or the subject  becomes  symptomatic,  they should  be 
discontinued  from  drug.  
Please  also refer to section  9.1 for patient  withdrawal  criteria.  
6 Safety  Assessment  
6.1 Adverse  Events  
All adverse  events  (AEs),  regardless  of severity  or potential  relationship  to study  drug,  will be 
recorded  using  medical  terminology  in the source  document  and the eCRF  
6.1.1 Definitions  
• Adverse  event:  Any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a patient  administered  the 
investigational  medicinal  product  (IMP)  and which  does not necessarily  have  a causal  
relationship  with the IMP.  An adverse  event  (AE)  can therefore  be any unfavourable  and 
unintended  sign (including  an abnormal  laboratory  finding),  symptom,  or disease  
temporally  associated  with the use of the IMP,  whether  or not considered  related  to the 
IMP.  
• Suspected  adverse  reaction : Any AE for which  there  is a reasonable  possibility  that the 
IMP caused  the AE. All untoward  and unintended  responses  to the IMP related  to any dose 
administered.  All AEs judged  by the investigator  as having  a reasonable  causal  relationship  
(i.e. unlikely,  possible  or probable)  to the IMP qualify  as suspected  adverse  reactions.  The 
expression  “reasonable  causal  relationship”  means  there  is evidence  to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the IMP and the AE. Suspected  adverse  reaction  implies  a lesser  
degree  of certainty  about  causality  than adverse  reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by 
the IMP.  
  
Page  56 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
  
6.1.2 Collection  
The condition  of the patients  will be monitored  throughout  the study.  
Any AE (including  laboratory  test abnormalities,  patient’s  subjective  symptoms,  intercurrent  
illnesses  or injuries,  and/or  study  procedures -related  AE) reported  spontaneously  by the patients,  
or observed  by the investigator  or medical  staff,  will be recorded  in the source  records  and the 
eCRF.  
Any untoward  medical  event,  which  occurs  from  the time of signed  Informed  Consent  to the time 
of first IMP administration,  will be classified  as “non  treatment -emergent  AE. An AE includes:  
A clinically  relevant  worsening  of an existing  illness  and/or  a clinical  laboratory  adverse  event  
(CLAE):  a laboratory  abnormality  that is clinically  significant  and suggests  toxicity  of a magnitude  
that requires  active  management  (either  active  treatment  or more  clinical  investigations,  such as 
more  frequent  follow -up to monitor  the abnormality.  
The following  are not to be reported  as AEs:  
- Pre-existing  conditions  found at screening  or before  exposure  to trial drug:  they should  be 
included  instead  in the medical  history  or concomitant  procedures.  
- Non-severe  hypoglycemia  is to be considered  an AE, but will be reported  under  
hypoglycemic  episodes  forms  rather  than in the eCRF  AE forms.  
- Pre-planned  procedures,  unless  the condition  for which  the procedure  was planned  has 
worsened  since  the participant  has signed  the informed  consent  form  
6.1.3 Intensity  Rating  
- The Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE:  
https://www.eortc.be/services/doc/ctc/CTCAE_4.03_2010 -06- 
14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf  ) will be used for reporting  AEs.  
The intensity  of an AE will  be rated  as follows:  
- Grade  1 Mild;  asymptomatic  or mild symptoms;  clinical  or diagnostic  observations  only;  
intervention  not indicated.  
- Grade  2 Moderate;  minimal,  local  or non-invasive  intervention  indicated;  limiting  age- 
appropriate  instrumental  Activities  of Daily  Living  (ADL)  (preparing  meals,  shopping  for 
groceries  or clothes,  using  the telephone,  managing  money,  etc.) 
- Grade  3 Severe  or medically  significant  but not immediately  life-threatening;  
hospitalization  or prolongation  of hospitalization  indicated;  disabling;  limiting  self-care 
ADL  (bathing,  dressing  and undressing,  feeding  self, using  the toilet,  taking  medications,  
and not bedridden)  
- Grade  4 Life-threatening  consequences;  urgent  intervention  indicated.  
- Grade  5 Death  related  to AE. 
Mild : no interference  with the patient’s  daily  activities  and does not require  mandatory  
corrective/symptomatic  treatment.  
- Moderate : moderate  interference  with the patient’s  daily  activities  and/or  requires  minimal  
medical  intervention  or corrective  treatment  required.  
- Severe : major  and unacceptable  interference  with the patient’s  daily  activities  and requires  
mandatory  corrective/symptomatic  treatment,  possible  hospitalization.  
  
Page  57 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
  
6.1.4 Causality  Rating  
The causal  relationship  of an AE to the IMP will be rated  as follows:  
- Unrelated : Clearly  and incontrovertibly  due only to extraneous  causes, and  does not meet  
criteria  listed  under  unlikely,  possible  or probable.  
- Unlikely : Does  not follow  a reasonable  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the IMP 
or is most  likely  related  to another  etiology  than the trial drug such as the patient’s  clinical  
state,  environmental  factors  or other  therapies.  
- Possible : Follows  a reasonable temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the IMP,  and/or  
a causal  relationship  cannot  be excluded  and remains  likely.  
- Probable : good  reason  (such  as clear -cut temporal  association  with improvement  on 
cessation  of the IMP or reduction  in dose,  or reappears  upon  (accidental)  rechallenge,  or 
follows  a known  pattern  of response  to the IMP)  and sufficient  documentation  to assume  a 
causal  relationship.  
6.1.5 Action  Taken  
The action  taken  with the IMP for an AE will be rated  as IMP withdrawn,  temporary  interruption,  
or dose not changed.  AEs requiring  therapy  will be treated  with recognized  standards  of medical  
care to protect  the health  and the well-being  of the patient.  
6.1.6 Outcome  
The outcome  of an AE will be rated  as recovered,  recovering,  sequelae,  not recovered,  fatal or 
unknown.  The investigator  will follow -up any AE until it is resolved  or until the medical  condition  
of the patient  is stable.  All relevant  follow -up information  will be collected.  For AEs that are 
ongoing  at the last visit,  the investigator  will make  thorough  efforts  to document  the outcome.  
 
Definitions:  
- Recovered/resolved : The subject  has fully recovered,  or by treatment  of some  sort the 
condition  reported  has now returned  to the level  observed  at the first trial-related  activity  
after the subject  signed  the informed  consent.  
- Recovering/resolving : The condition  is improving  and subject  expected  to recover  from  
the mentioned  event.  
- Recovered/resolved  with sequelae:  The subject  has recovered  from  AE but with lasting  
effect  due to a disease,  injury,  treatment  or procedure.  
- Not recovered : The condition  has not improved  or the symptoms  are unchanged.  Also,  if 
the outcome  is unknown.  
- Fatal : To be used only if the subject  has died from  the condition/reported  adverse  event.  
An AE with fatal outcome  must  be reported  as an SAE.  
- Unknown : There  is no available  information  related  to the condition  of the AE. 
6.1.7 Multiple  Signs  or Symptoms  
If an AE consists  of several  signs  or symptoms  that can be represented  by one single  syndrome  or 
diagnosis,  the syndrome  or diagnosis  will be recorded  in the eCRF  as the AE instead  of the 
individual  signs  or symptoms.  
6.1.8 Worsening  Signs  
Symptoms,  syndromes  or diagnoses  present  before  the first IMP administration  will be considered  
as AEs if they worsen  after the start of the IMP.  
Page  58 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
  
6.2 Serious  Adverse  Events  
6.2.1 Definitions  
A Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  is any untoward  medical  occurrence  or effect  that at any dose:  
• results  in death;  
• is life-threatening  (at the time of the event);  
• requires  in patient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  hospitalization;  
• results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity;  
• is a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect;  
• or is an important  medical  event.  
Death:  the death  of a patient  enrolled  in a clinical  study  is per se not an event,  but an outcome.  An 
AE resulting  in a fatal outcome  must  be fully documented  and reported,  including  if the death  
occurred  after treatment  end, and regardless  of the causality  relationship  of the death  to the IMP.  
The cause  of the death  is usually  the AE. If the cause  cannot  be determined,  the case will be 
considered  an unexplained  death  
Life-threatening : an AE that places  the patient,  in the view  of the initial  reporter  (investigator),  at 
immediate  risk of death  from  the AE as it occurred,  i.e. it does not include  an AE that, had it 
occurred  in a more  severe  form,  might  have  caused  death.  
Hospitalization:  a hospitalization  for a diagnosis  or therapeutic  procedure  planned  before  study  
enrolment  but performed  after the enrolment  should  not be considered  for SAE  and should  be 
reported  in the eCRF  in the medical  history  or concomitant  procedures  page.  
Disability:  a substantial  disruption  of a person’s  ability  to conduct  normal  life functions.  
Important  medical  event:  an important  medical  event  that may not result  in death,  be life- 
threatening,  or require  hospitalization may  be considered  as a SAE  when,  based  upon  appropriate  
medical  judgment, it may jeopardize the patient  and may require medical  or surgical  intervention  
to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in the definition.  The concept  includes  AEs which  suggest  a 
significant  hazard,  contraindication  or precaution  for use, occurrence  of malignancy  or 
development  of drug dependency  or drug abuse.  
 
Other  events  for immediate  reporting  
Overdose : an overdose of  an IMP is the accidental  or intentional  administration  of a dose  higher  
than the highest  dose under  clinical  investigation.  An overdose  will be documented  and reported  
in an expedited  manner  with the same  procedure  and timelines  as for SAEs  (see section  6.3.1 ), 
independently  from  the occurrence  of an AE. 
Pregnancy : The occurrence  of a pregnancy  of a study  patient  or a partner  of a study  patient  
discovered  during  IMP administration  or within 1 week  after last administration  of the IMP,  is to 
be reported  in an expedited  manner  with the same  procedure  and timelines  as for SAEs  (see section   
6.3.1 ), independently  from  the occurrence  of an AE. Specific  follow -up of the event  will be done  
by the investigator  until pregnancy  outcome,  following  standard  procedures  established  by the 
University  of Florida  Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB).  
 
6.3 Reporting  requirements  
6.3.1 Immediate  reporting  
The investigator  will immediately,  i.e. within  24 hours  from  first knowledge,  report  any SAE  
Page  59 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 occurring  during  the study  to the appropriate  Data  Safety  Monitor  Board  (DSMB)  and IRB that 
approved  the protocol.  
The investigator will  complete sign a SAE  Report  Form  and transmit it to the DSMB  and IRB by 
email  or telefax  not later than 24 hours  after the first knowledge  of the SAE.  The DSMB  and IRB 
acknowledge  the receipt  of the SAE  information  by email  to the investigational  site within  one 
working  day (unless  on a weekend  or Holiday  when  reporting  will occur  on the first working  day).  
In the absence  of email  acknowledging  the receipt,  or in case of any issue  in sending  the fax or 
email,  the investigator  shall  contact  the DSMB  and IRB by any means  for ensuring  the receipt  of 
SAE  information  at the earliest  opportunity.  
Any follow -up information  will be reported  to the DSMB  and IRB as soon  as it becomes  known,  
with the same  process  and timelines  as described  here above  for initial  reports.  
SAEs  occurring  after the last study  visit will only be reported  if the investigator  believes  that the 
event  may have  been  caused  by the IMP or a protocol  procedure.  
6.3.2 IND safety  reporting  requirements  
The investigator  will be responsible  for the declaration  of suspected  unexpected  serious  adverse  
reactions  (SUSARs)  according  to US FDA  regulation.  Expectedness  will be based  on the safety  
reference  document  i.e. the Investigator  Brochure  (IB).  
6.3.3 Reporting  to Inventiva  SA 
Inventiva  SA, through  its new pharmacovigilance  contractor,  United BioSource Corporation 
(UBC) , will be copied  on all SUSAR  and SAE  declarations  and will collect  in its safety  database  
UNITED BIOSOURCE CORPORATION  
Email:  Inventivasafety@ubc.com  
UBC  will ensure  that appropriate  cross -reporting  of SUSAR  originating  from  the present  
clinical  trial is performed  in all countries  with on-going  lanifibranor  trials.  
6.3.4 Cross -reporting  
SUSAR  and SAE’s  occurring  from  other  on-going  lanifibranor  trials  will be sent by Inventiva  SA, 
through  its pharmacovigilance  contractor,  UBC , to the investigator  for reporting  to local  
competent  authorities  in accordance  with local  regulation.  
 
6.4 Safety  Variables  
All safety  variables  will be primary  ones.  Safety  evaluations  will be completed  as given  in section  
8.7 and as indicated  below.  
The investigator will  rate all safety variables  as to clinical  relevance or not. In case of a clinically  
relevant  abnormality,  the safety  evaluation  will be repeated.  If the abnormality  is confirmed  and 
clinically  relevant,  it will be recorded  as an AE term in the eCRF.  The abnormality  will be followed  
up until the value  has returned  to normal  or an adequate  explanation  is found.  
Safety  endpoints  
Secondary  safety  endpoints  will be used to support  the safety  objectives  of the study,  such as the 
number  of treatment -emergent  adverse  events,  including  hypoglycemic  episodes  (i.e., blood - 
confirmed  glucose  levels  below  40 and 70 mg/dL,  severe  symptomatic  hypoglycaemic  episodes  
during  the trial),  as well as haematologic  and biochemical  tests as described  in Table 6 below.  
Hypoglycaemic  episodes  will be classified  and then summarized  as: a) Number  and percentage  of 
subjects  with at least one event;  b) Total  number  of events  and per ADA  category  (see below);  and 
c) Event  rate per 100 patient  years  of exposure.  
The study  will use the ADA  classification/criteria  of hypoglycaemia  as follows  (35): 
Page  60 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 • Severe  hypoglycaemia:  An episode  requiring  assistance  of another  person  to actively  
administer  carbohydrate,  glucagon,  or take other  corrective  actions.  Plasma  glucose  
concentrations  may not be available  during  an event,  but neurological  recovery  following  
the return  of plasma  glucose  to normal  is considered  sufficient  evidence  that the event  was 
induced  by a low plasma  glucose  concentration.  
• Asymptomatic  hypoglycaemia:  An episode  not accompanied  by typical  symptoms  of 
hypoglycaemia,  but with a measured  plasma  glucose concentration  ≤ 70 mg/dL.  
• Documented  symptomatic  hypoglycaemia: An  episode  during  which  typical symptoms  of 
hypoglycaemia  are accompanied  by a measured  plasma  glucose  concentration  ≤ 70 mg/dL.  
• Pseudo -hypoglycaemia:  An episode  during  which  the person  with diabetes  reports  any of 
the typical  symptoms  of hypoglycaemia  with a measured  plasma  glucose  concentration  > 
70 mg/dL  but approaching  that level.  
• Probable  symptomatic  hypoglycaemia:  An episode  during  which  symptoms  of 
hypoglycaemia  are not accompanied  by a plasma  glucose  determination  but that was 
presumably  caused by a  plasma  glucose concentration  ≤ 70 mg/dL . 
 
6.4.1 Physical  Examination  
Physical  examinations  will be conducted  by the investigators.  Any findings  will be documented  in 
the source  document  and recorded  in the eCRF.  
 
6.4.2 Laboratory  Tests  
Laboratory  tests will be analyzed  mainly  at the hospital  laboratory.  
Additional  samples  for laboratory  safety  variables  may be drawn  at any time during  the study  at 
the investigators  judgment.  The laboratory  assessments  performed  at each visit are listed  in the 
following  table  (see Table 6).

Verification  according  to University  of Florida  standards  for clinical  trials.  
All data must  be verifiable  in source  documentation  other  than the eCRF.  
 
 
7 Data Quality  Assurance  
7.1 Monitoring  
The PI and Medical  staff will verify  during  monitoring  visits,  the monitors  will verify  the 
adherence  to the protocol,  the maintenance  of all study -related  records  and the accuracy  and 
Page  64 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 completeness  of all eCRF  entries  compared  with source  data in order  to ensure  that: 
• Data  are authentic,  accurate,  and complete.  
• Safety  and rights  of subjects  are being  protected.  
• Study  is conducted  in accordance  with the currently  approved  protocol,  ICH-GCP  and all 
applicable  regulatory  requirements  
 
Any discrepancies  identified  must  be resolved.  The monitors  will review  source  documents  to 
confirm  that the data recorded  on eCRF  is accurate.  The investigator  and institution  appropriate  
regulatory  authorities’  direct  access  to source  documents  to perform  the verification according  to 
University  of Florida  standards  for clinical  trials.  All data must  be verifiable  in source  
documentation  other  than the eCRF.  
The study  sites may be subject  to review  by the Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)/Data  Safety  and 
Monitoring  Board  (DSMB),  and/or  to quality  assurance  audits,  and/or  to inspection  by appropriate  
regulatory  authorities.  The collection  and processing  of personal  data from  subjects  enrolled  in this 
study  will be limited  to those  data that are necessary  to fulfill  the objectives  of the study.  
It is important  that the investigator(s)  and their relevant  personnel  are available  during  the 
monitoring  visits  and possible  audits  or inspections  and that sufficient  time is devoted  to the 
process.  
 
7.2 Data  Recording  
Electronic  Data Capture  (EDC)  will be used for this study,  meaning  that all data will be entered  
on an  eCRF  at the investigational  site. This eCRF  will be specifically  designed  for the study.  We 
will use a program  called  REDCap™  (Research  Electronic  Data Capture;  
https: //www.ctsi.ufl.edu/research/study -design -and-analysis/redcap).  It is a secure,  Web -based  
application  designed  to support  traditional  case report  form  data capture  for research  studies  
performed  at NIH-based  Clinical  Translational  Science  Institutes  (CTSIs)  use. It is a flexible  
platform  that allows  Export  data to Microsoft  Excel  and statistical  packages  for easy data analysis.  
This database  platform  has several  practical  advantages:  
• HIPAA  Compliant  
• Data  is stored  on a secure  server  
• Database  access  requires  user authentication  with password  
• Data  access  based  on an individual’s  role on a project  
• Logging  and audit  trails  on all data interactions  
• IRB and UF Privacy  Office  approved  for collection  and storage  of PHI (private  health  
information).  
The University  of Florida  (UF)  requires  that all data collected  or stored  in REDCap  follow  the 
following  processes  and procedures:  
• All human  research  studies  must  have  Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)  approval  before  
the research  study  can be moved  to production  and data collection  can commence.  
• The name  of the Principal  Investigator  (PI) must  be provided.  
• If the research  study  will include  other  collaborative  personnel  such as co-investigators,  
technicians  and students,  the principal  investigator  must  assure  that the personnel  are listed  
on the approved  IRB form.  
• If data is collected  that is considered  either  sensitive,  protected  health  information,  or 
HIPAA  information,  then prior  to using  the system  the user must  complete  all necessary  
Page  65 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 training  including  but not limited  to require  HIPAA  training.  
• Social  Security  Number  training  is required  annually  for all UF personnel  who use SSNs  
in their work  or research.  The “Protecting  Social  Security  Numbers”  training  module  is 
available  only through  myTraining . http://mytraining.hr.ufl.edu . 
• It is the responsibility  of the principal  investigator  to ensure  that collaborative  personnel  
have  the appropriate  study -specific  and related  training  and have  reviewed  the required  
safeguards  according  to UF policies  and procedures.  
• Users  of REDCap™  must  adhere  to all UF computer  policies,  regulations,  rules  and 
standards.  It is the responsibility  of the principal  investigator  and the administrator  of each 
account  to routinely  monitor  their REDCap  projects.  
 
REDCap  Support  and Contingency  Policies  
The Clinical  and Translational  Science  Institute  (CTSI)  at the University  of Florida  provides  the 
use of REDCap™  (Research  Electronic  Data Capture)  software  as a service  for UF investigators  
and their teams  to collect  study  data.  This service  includes  the REDCap  application  software  hosted  
in a web server,  server  space  for data storage,  regular  system  backups,  software  patches  and 
upgrades.  In the event  of a system  shut-down,  a 24 hour recovery  time objective  is achievable.  UF 
Health  IT has a Disaster  Avoidance  and Recovery  Plan that covers  responsibilities,  
communication,  and escalation.  The recovery  point  objective  for the REDCap  database  is 1 hour 
(no more  than 1 hour of data loss).  The recovery  point  objective  for the web server  is 24 hours  (no 
more  than 24 hours  of data loss).  
• PIs will maintain  printed  copies  of REDCap  forms  to enable  offline  data collection  and 
subsequent  data entry  if there  is a need  to collect  data during  an outage.  In the event  of an expected  
catastrophic  disaster,  such as loss of a data center  due to a hurricane,  the REDCap  Support  Team  
(Administrators)  will notify  all REDCap  users  via e-mail of the potential  threat.  
• PI’s are advised  to move/export  data to a disk and to a storage  area approved  for sensitive  data.  
In the  event  of scheduled  System  maintenance, the  REDCap  Support  Team  (Administrators)  will 
notify  all REDCap  users  via e-mail one week  prior,  one day before  and on the day of the scheduled  
maintenance.  All users  are notified  via e-mail when  the system  is available  again.  Data  is not 
available  for export  from  REDCap  during  a REDCap  outage.  
In this clinical  trial, only anonymized  data will be recorded  based  on the clinical  data collected.  
The anonymized  data of medical  information  includes  the results  of the trials  tests and will be 
communicated  to the Principal  Investigator  or its representative.  
Only  members  of the research  team,  who also form  part of the patient's  direct  clinical  care team,  
at the participating  sites will have  access  to patient  records  as part of their medical  care and will 
use these  records  to screen  for potentially  eligible  patients.  Patients  who consent  to enter  the trial 
are informed  that staff from  the research  team,  the Principal  Investigator  (and its representatives),  
relevant  regulatory  authorities  and ethical  committees  may require  access  to their full medical  
records  for monitoring  and auditing  purposes.  
Database  and results  of statistical  analyses,  narratives  of SAEs  will be transmitted  to Inventiva  SA 
which  will contract  out study  report  writing.  
The clinical  study  report  will be reviewed  and signed  by the Principal  Investigator.  
The study  (validation  of the final report),  the data will be totally  anonymized  and will be stored  on 
a dedicated  and secured  slot at the Principal  Investigator  site. 
Only  authorized  Principal  Investigator  employees  or its representative  will have  access  to the data.

7.3 Data  Management  
7.3.1 Responsibilities  
The PI will designate  the Data  Managers  who will be provided  with all tools,  instructions,  and 
training  necessary  to complete  the eCRF  into REDCap,  and each user will be issued  a unique  
username  and password.  
The Data Management  will be responsible  for data processing,  in accordance  with REDCap  data 
management  procedures.  Data  will be managed  by the PI (Dr. Cusi)  and his research  team,  who 
will be responsible  for data processing,  quality  control,  storage,  monitoring,  and analysis.  Data  
will be also shared  with Inventiva  for additional  analysis  and result  publication.  Only  de-identified  
datasets  from  which  all PHI has been  removed  will be shared  with Inventiva.  
The Principal  Investigator,  together  with his designated  medical  staff,  will verify  that all data 
entries  in the eCRF  are accurate  and correct.  If some  assessments  are not done,  or if certain  
information  is not available,  not applicable,  or unknown,  the Investigators  will have  to indicate  
this in the eCRF.  The Investigators  will be required  to electronically  sign off the clinical  data.  
The Monitors  will review  the eCRFs  and evaluate  them  for completeness  and consistency.  The 
eCRF  will be compared  with the source  documents  to ensure  that there  are no discrepancies.  
All entries,  corrections,  and alterations  will be made  by the Investigator  or his/her  delegate.  The 
Monitors  will not enter  data in the eCRFs.  
 
7.3.2 Data  Collection  and Validation  
All clinical,  laboratory  and imaging  data will be entered  into the  eCRF  at the investigational  site. 
This will be done  for each patient  (screen  failure  and enrolled),  by the Investigator  or designee,  
and signed  by the Investigator.  A hard copy  of the clinical  data will be kept in locked  cabinets  and 
locked  offices  at our CTSI  (second  floor,  diabetes  research  section),  strictly  following  current  UF 
IRB privacy  guidelines  of confidentiality  at all times.  
A unique  subject  code  will identify  the subjects on the eCRF.  Each  participant  will be assigned  a 
unique  study  identification  number.  A link to the study  identification  number  will be stored  
separately.  Data  will be collected  on case report  forms  or source  documents.  Data quality  control  
will be monitored  regularly  along  with real-time programmed  data checks.  
Once  clinical  data of the eCRF  have  been  entered  into REDCap,  corrections  to the data fields  will 
be audit  trailed,  meaning  that the reason  for change  and the name  of the person  who performed  the 
change,  together  with time and date,  will be logged.  Roles  and rights  of the site personnel  
responsible  for entering  the clinical  data into the eCRF  in REDCap  will be determined  in advance  
and documented  on the “delegation  form”.  
Automatic  checks  and listings  will be designed  and performed  according  to the data validation  
plan,  developed  by Data  Managers.  In case of missing  values,  out of range  values,  data 
inconsistencies  or values  that fail logical  checks,  queries  will be edited  in the EDC  application.  In 
addition,  the Monitors  and Data Manager(s)  can raise  manual  queries  in the EDC  application.  
The appropriate  investigational  staff will answer  automatic  and manual  queries.  This will be audit - 
trailed  by the EDC  application,  meaning  that the name  of the person  who answered  and the time 
and date stamp  are captured.  
 
7.3.3 Data  Coding  
AEs and Medical  History  (MH)  will be coded  using  the last version  of MedDRA  terminology.  
Concomitant  medications  will be coded  using  WHO  Drug  2016  Q1 (or a more  recent  version)  
terminology.  
Page  67 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 The medical  coding  will be performed  by the Data  Manager  coding  specialist  and reviewed  by a 
Principal  Investigator  before  being  submitted  to Inventiva  for approval.  
 
7.3.4 Database  Lock  
Once  validated,  the database  will be locked  so that no more  change  will be possible  on the frozen  
data.  
After  database  lock,  the Principal  Investigator  will receive  a CD-ROM  of the patient  data (eCRF  
data + audit  trail)  for archiving  at the investigational  site. 
 
7.3.5 Database  Transfer  
Final  validated  data will be transferred  in a secure  way to the Inventiva  Biostatistical  team  in Excel  
or the format  that best meets  the Inventiva  Biostatistical  team  after mutual  agreement.  
 
7.4 Independent  Audit  
The Principal  Investigator  will permit  an independent  audit  by an auditor  mandated  by Inventiva  
S.A.,  after reasonable  notice.  An audit  or a regulatory  inspection  is intended  to determine  if the 
study  was conducted  as per protocol  (PP),  GCP  and applicable  regulatory  requirements,  if the 
rights  and well-being  of the patients  were  protected,  and if the data relevant  for the evaluation  of 
the IMP were  captured,  processed  and reported  in compliance  with the planned  arrangements.  
 
7.5 Regulatory  Inspection  
Regulatory  authorities  may perform  an inspection  of the study  including  several  years  after its 
completion.  As for an audit,  the investigator  will permit  a direct  access  to all study  documents,  
drug accountability  records,  source  records  and source  data.  If an inspection  is announced,  
Inventiva  S.A. will be informed  without  delay.  
 
 
8 Statistical  Methods  
Studied  population:  
Modified  ITT and safety  population:  All randomized  patients  who took at least one dose 
Evaluable  patients:  Patients  belonging  to the mITT  with at least one pre-randomization  and one 
post-randomization  assessment  of IHTG.  
 
8.1 Efficacy  Assessments  
Primary  outcome  and Primary  efficacy  criterion:  IHTG  quantified  by ¹H-MRS.  
Primary  outcome:  Change  from  baseline  to week  24 in IHTG  quantified  by 1H-MRS.  
Primary  measure  of the magnitude  of treatment  effect:  difference  between  lanifibranor  and 
placebo  in the mean  change  from  baseline  to week  24 of IHTG.  
Threshold  of clinical  pertinence  of the effect  size: an absolute  difference  between  treatments  of 
3% in the mean  change  from  baseline  to week  24 is probably  at the limit  of clinical  pertinence.  
This represents  a mean  decrease  in IHTG  of 20%  in lanifibranor  group  and 0% in placebo  group.  
Considering  a standard  deviation  of 7 this is a standardized  effect  size of a little less than 0.43 
which  is in the lower -medium  class  (between  0.4 and 0.5) of treatment  effect.  Therefore,  an 
absolute  reduction  of 3.5%  (relative  reduction  of 23.3%),  leading  to a standardized  effect  size of 
1.5 (medium  effect  size),  is considered  clinically  pertinent.  Indeed,  assuming  the normality  of the 
distribution  of the change  from  baseline,  a mean  absolute  reduction  of 3.5%  in IHTG  for the tested  
drug and 0 for placebo,  a baseline  at 15%,  a standard  deviation  of 7% and a resolution  of NAFLD  
Page  68 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 from  5.5%  and below,  the expected  percentage  of patients  with A IHTG  of 5.5 or less ("resolution"  
of NAFLD)  is 19.5%  with the tested  drug and 8.7%  for the placebo  corresponding  to a 2.24 times  
more  chance  of observing  a resolution  in the tested  drug than in the placebo  group.  
Using  the expected  treatment  effect  in the sample  size calculation  (35%  relative  reduction  in IHTG  
for the tested  drug and 0% for placebo),  then the expected  absolute  effect  size is 5.5%,  the 
standardized  effect  size is 0.79 that is very close  to a large  magnitude  (0.8)  of treatment  effect.  The 
expected  percentages  of "resolution"  of NAFLD  under  the assumption  of normality  of the change  
from  baseline  is 28.4%  versus  8.7%  corresponding  to 3.26 times  more  chance  to get an observed  
resolution  of NAFLD  for lanifibranor  compared  to placebo.  
Secondary  endpoints : The following  changes  from  baseline  to 24 weeks  of treatment  will be 
evaluated  and used as secondary  endpoint:  
• Proportion  of “responders”  defined  as the percentage  of patients  reaching  a decrease  
from  baseline  in IHTG  (quantified  by ¹H-MRS)  of ≥ 30% at 24 weeks.  The definition  
of “responders”  as those  with a ≥ 30% reduction  in liver fat by ¹H-MRS  is empiric  as 
there  are no studies  (except  the Belfort  et al, NEJM  2006  (1) and Cusi et al (2) with 
pioglitazone)  comparing  simultaneously  ¹H-MRS  with liver histology,  but this threshold  
is likely  to correlate  with positive  histological  changes  in NASH,  based  on investigator's  
experience.  
• Proportion  of patients  considered  as having  resolution  of NAFLD  (≤5.5%  IHTG  
quantified  by 1H- MRS)  at 24 weeks  (highly  likely  to translate  into histological  benefit  
in NASH).  
• Changes  in hepatic  fibrosis  by several  techniques  (one or all may be used):  
a) vibration -controlled  transient  elastography  (Fibroscan)  (3); 
b) two-dimensional  magnetic  resonance  elastography  (2D-MRE)  (4); and 
c) T1  MRI  mapping   scanning  protocol   that  allows   for  the  accurate   non-invasive  
measurement  of liver fibrosis  (5). 
• Change  in plasma  biomarkers  of liver fibrosis  (i.e., cytokeratin  CK-18, proC3.  
• Change  in metabolic  outcomes  standard  for such pilot trials  (see our work  in ref. 1,2,6 
at week  24 of treatment,  and will include:  
o Determination  of glucose  tolerance/insulin,  hepatic  insulin  sensitivity,  
gluconeogenesis,  de novo  lipogenesis  (DNL).  
o Oral glucose  tolerance  test. 
o Glycemic  control:  HbA1c,  advanced  lipid testing.  
o Biomarkers   of  adipose  tissue  metabolism   (i.e.,  plasma   adiponectin   and 
adipokine  panels  measured  multiplex  platform).  
• DNA  testing  to assess  SNPs  related  to NAFLD  (PNPLA3,  TM6SF2,  others)  (36). 
• Safety  and tolerability  assessments  as standard  for clinical  treatment  trials  (vital  signs,  
electrocardiograms,  hypoglycemia,  laboratory  parameters  such as elevation  in liver or 
pancreatic  enzymes,  other).  
 
8.2 Sample  Size 
Based  on the most  recent  studies  patients  with NAFLD  are expected  to have a baseline  IHTG  of 
approximately  15%.  The earlier  power  calculations  based  on results  with pioglitazone  from  a 6- 
month  study  (1) and a more  recent  18 month  RCT  (2) but they were revised  in the protocol  based  
on the recent  results  with lanifibranor  800 mg/day  (same  dose as this study) , a 6-month  RCT  
(NATIVE)  that used liver biopsy  (histology)  as the primary  endpoint  (provided  in detail by 
Inventiva to the  PI Dr.  Cusi).  In NATIVE,  the proportion of  patients  with a reduction in steatosis  
Page  69 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 to lanifibranor  was 73% versus  26% with placebo;  greater  than with pioglitazone  in the 6-month  
Belfort  et al study  [1]). Based  on these  most  recent  results,  this would  translate  to liver fat imaging  
on 1H-MRS  of a relative  reduction  of fat liver with lanifibranor  to be ≥50% compared  to placebo.  
This represents  a change  of ≥7.0%  with lanifibranor  versus  the control  group.  The expected  
standard  deviation  of the change  from  baseline  is expected  to be 7%. Considering  a type I error  of 
0.05 (2-sided),  a power  of 0.80,  an allocation  ratio of 1:1, the same  variance  in both treatment  
groups  and a parametric  test of mean  comparison,  the required  sample  size per group  is 15 patients  
to complete  treatment.  Assuming  that 10 % of randomized  patients  will not complete  the trial, the 
total number  of patients  to be randomized  is 33-34 patients.  Considering  a type I error  of 0.05 (2-
sided),  a power  of 0.80,  an allocation  ratio of 1:1, the same  variance  in both treatment  groups  and 
a parametric  test of mean  comparison  the required  sample  size per group  is 15 patients.  Assuming  
that 10 % of randomized  patients  will not complete  the trial, the total number  of patients  to be 
randomized  is 34. 
 
8.3 Randomization  
Patients  will be randomized  equally  1:1: to either  dose of lanifibranor  or placebo.  
The randomization  list will be setup  with blocs  of size equal  to 4. 
8.4 Protocol  Deviations  
Protocol  deviators  will be identified  and classified  at the blind  review.  Only  patients  with major  
deviations  will be discussed  in the Clinical  Study  Report  and excluded  from  the per protocol  
analysis.  
 
8.5 Data  sets Analyzed  
- Full analysis  set (FAS)  
The full analysis  set consists  of all randomized  patients  who received  at least one dose of the 
assigned  treatment.  In case of error  in the assignment  of treatment,  the actual  treatment  will be 
used in the FAS instead  of the treatment  assigned  in the randomization  list. This set is the primary  
set of patients  used in the primary  analysis  of the primary  efficacy  endpoint.  It corresponds  more  
or less to efficiency  evaluation  of treatment.  
 
- Randomized  set of patients  
The randomized  set of patients  consists  of all  randomized  patients.  In case of treatment  error,  the 
treatment  assigned  in the randomization  list will prevail  over the actual  received  treatment.  In case 
of no post-randomization  efficacy  assessment  the patient  will be a failure  (see handling  of missing  
data).  This set of patients  will be used in a sensitivity  analysis.  
 
- Set of evaluable  patients  
The set of evaluable  patients  will consist  of the FAS after exclusion  of all patients  who did not 
have  an efficacy  evaluation  (IHTG)  at week  24. Patients  did not necessarily  took their treatment  
up to week  24. In case of error  in the assignment  of treatment,  the actual  treatment  will be used in 
the FAS instead  of the treatment  assigned  in the randomization  list. 
 
- Per protocol  set of completers  
This set is composed  of all patients  who completed  the treatment  and the study  and who were  free 
from  major  protocol  deviation  that can bias the estimation  of the treatment  effect  at week  24. 
Patients  with major  deviations  will be listed  during  the blind  review  and the reason  for exclusion  
will be provided.  In case of treatment  error,  the patient  will be assigned  to the group  corresponding  
to the actual  treatment  received.  This set will be used in efficacy  evaluation  for estimating  and 
testing  the treatment  effect  in the best situation  (squeaky  clean  analysis)  i.e. treatment  completers,  
Page  70 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 assessment  at 24 weeks  for all patients,  no major  protocol  violations  
 
- Safety  set of patients  
The safety  set of patients  will include  all patients  who have  taken  at least one dose of treatment  
(IVA  337 or placebo),  regardless  any protocol  deviations.  In case of treatment  error,  the actual  
treatment  will be used.  Safety  analyses  will be conducted  on the safety  population  
 
 
8.6 Demographic  and Other  Baseline  Characteristics  
8.6.1 Patient  Demographic  Characteristics,  Medical  History  and Diagnoses  
Safety  characteristics,  including  demography,  medical  history,  entrance  criteria  deviations  will be 
summarized  using  the descriptive  statistics  (N, mean,  standard  deviation,  median  minimum  and 
maximum  for quantitative  values  and counts  and percentages  for qualitative  variables).  
 
8.6.2 Previous  Medications  
The use of prior  medications  will be summarized.  
 
8.6.3 Patient  history  
Medical  history  of patients  will be provided  
 
8.7 Safety  Analysis  
The review  of safety  and tolerance  will be performed  on the safety  population.  The safety  analysis  
will be based  on the reported  AEs and other  safety  information.  The Principal  Investigator  will use 
its most  updated  list of potentially  clinically  significant  abnormalities  (PCSA)  in clinical  laboratory  
tests,  vital signs,  and ECG  for the final analysis.  The effect  of the demographic  differences  (gender,  
age, etc.) and risk factors  of clinical  relevance  will be explored  in case of any potential  concern.  
 
8.7.1 Extent  of Exposure  
The extent  of exposure  will be summarized  descriptively  (N, mean,  median,  standard  deviation  
and range)  using  treatment  exposure  duration.  Treatment  exposure  duration  (in days)  is defined  as: 
(Date  of last dose of study  product  - First intake  of study  product  date).  In case of treatment  
interruption,  the actual  duration  of treatment  will be used.  The distribution  and cumulative  
distribution  of patients  by treatment  exposure  duration  will be presented  graphically  for the safety  
population.  
 
8.7.2 Adverse  Events  
Each  AE will be associated  to a "preferred  term"  and classified  by "system -organ  class"  according  
to the latest  MedDRA.  The AE parameter  of interest  is the number  and percentage  of patients  
experiencing:  - at least one event  - an event  under  each recorded  preferred  term,  and an event  under  
each recorded  system -organ  class.  These  frequencies  apply  to all AEs,  regardless  of relationship  
of the event  to lanifibranor.  
- Definitions:  
Adverse  events  will be coded  according  to Medical  Dictionary  for Regulatory  Affairs  (MedDRA)  
and coded  as treatment  emergent  (TEAE)  / non-treatment  emergent  (non-TEAE)  according  to the 
following  definitions.  TEAEs  are defined  as events  occurring  on or after the day of first dose intake  
of study  product  and up to follow  up visit.  Additionally,  events  present  before  the first dose of 
study  product,  but worsening  under  treatment  are considered  as TEAEs.  Although  every  effort  will 
Page  71 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 be made  to establish  the onset  date and time, events  with missing  onset date  will be considered  as 
TEAEs. An  AE that will not qualify  as a TEAE  will be considered as a Non-TEAE.  Non-TEAES  
will be summarized  separately  from  TEAES  and will be presented  in the same  manner  as TEAEs.  
- Treatment  Emergent  Adverse  Events  
A given  TEAE  will be counted  once  only per patient.  The percentages  will be calculated  in relation  
to the population  exposed  (i.e., safety  population).  All TEAES  will be analyzed,  irrespective  of 
their causal  relationship with allocated treatment.   Summary tables  will be provided,  showing  the 
following:  
• count  of exposed  patients,  
• count  and percentage  of patients  with at least one TEAE,  
• count  and percentage  of each TEAE:  TEAEs  will be sorted  by decreasing  order  of organ  
system  frequency  then by decreasing  order  of preferred  term frequency,  
• count  and percentage  of each TEAE,  not taking  into account  organ  system.  
In addition, TEAEs  will be described  according  to their time to onset  with same  categories  as for 
duration  of exposure,  their maximal  intensity  and their relationship  to gender  and age of patient,  
time from  first intake,  outcome,  seriousness  criteria,  corrective  treatment,  duration,  treatment  
received,  and action  taken.  Patient  data listings  will be provided  for all AEs,  TEAEs,  AEs leading  
to study  discontinuations  and SAEs.  
Deaths  and Serious  Adverse  Events  Incidence  of SAEs  (irrespective  of their emergence  
classification  and relationship  to lanifibranor)  and deaths  will be listed  and summarized.  
 
- Adverse  Events  leading  to treatment  discontinuation  
Adverse  event  leading  to discontinuation  of the study  will be tabulated,  irrespective  of their 
emergence  classification  and irrespective  of their relationship  to lanifibranor.  
 
8.7.3 Other  Observations  Related  to Safety  
- Laboratory  tests  
The analysis  will focus  on potentially  clinically  significant  abnormal  (PCSA)  values  which  will be 
defined  in the Statistic  Analysis  Plan (SAP).  The incidence  of PCSAs  will be summarized  for each 
clinical  laboratory  test. The summaries  will include  patients  exposed  to study  medication  who have  
at least one laboratory  test performed  after the first study  product  intake  and, when  required  by the 
definition  of the abnormality,  with an available  baseline  value  and available  normal  ranges.  For 
these  descriptions,  the baseline  value  will be the latest  available  measure  before  the first study  
product  dose intake.  International  units  will be used in all listings,  tables  and graphs.  Results  and 
changes  from  baseline  of laboratory  parameters  will be summarized  by mean,  standard  deviation,  
median,  minimum  and maximum  at each time point  and for the final on-treatment  visit.  
Unscheduled  and/or  repeated  results  will only be listed  and not summarized.  
Shift  tables  and other  tabular and graphical  methods will be  used to present the results for tests  of 
interest.  Listings  will be provided  with flags  indicating  clinically  significant  out-of-range  values,  
clinically  non-significant  out-of-range  values  as well as the PCSA  values.  
 
- Vital  signs  and ECG  
Descriptive  statistics  by time point  will be computed  on actual  values  and changes  from  baseline  
for vital signs  and ECG  data.  The baseline  value  is defined  as the last measure  before  study  product  
intake.  ECG  parameters  collected  are heart  rate, PR interval,  QRS  interval,  QT, QTcB  (Bazett)  
intervals.  Descriptive  statistics  (means,  standard  deviations,  and ranges)  and changes  from  baseline  
values  for all visits  will be provided.  Patients  with PCSA  for each vital sign or ECG  data parameter  
Page  72 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 will be identified  and listed.  The incidence  of PCSA  at any time point  will be summarized  for each 
vital sign parameter.  The summaries  will include  patients  who have  at least one measurement  
performed after  the first study product  intake. When the PCSA  definition  involves  a change  from  
the baseline  value,  patients  also need  to have  a baseline  value  to be included  in the summaries.  
Results  and changes  from  baseline  of the following  vital sign parameters  will be summarized  by 
mean,  standard  deviation,  median,  minimum  and maximum  at each time point  and the final on- 
treatment  visit:  
• Heart  rate: supine,  
• Systolic  blood  pressure:  supine,  
• Diastolic  blood  pressure:  supine,  
• Weight.  
Shift  tables  and other  tabular  and graphical  methods  (plots  of mean  over time)  may be used to 
present  the results  for parameters  of interest.  
Confirmatory  inferential  analysis  may be done  for parameters  of interest.  Listings  will be provided  
with flags  indicating  clinically  significant  out-of-range  values,  clinically  non-significant  out-of- 
range  values  as well as the PCSA  values.  
 
- Physical  examination  
For physical  examination  anomalies  will be listed  and frequencies  tables  will be computed.  
 
8.7.4 Efficacy  Analyses  
Primary  efficacy  analysis  
The primary  population  will be the modified  intent  to treat FAS population  composed  of all 
randomized  subject  who received  at least one dose and had at least one post-randomization  efficacy  
assessment.  
The primary  outcome  will be the change  from  baseline  to week  24 in IHTG.  
The primary  model  will be a general  linear  model  using  the change  from  baseline  to week  24 as 
the response,  the treatment  as covariate  as well as the baseline  of IHTG.  Few covariates  can be 
added  in the SAP to take into account  known  confounding  factors.  
The magnitude  of the treatment  effect  will be the between  treatment  group  difference  in the mean  
change  from  baseline  to week  24 in IHTG  adjusted  for baseline  of IHTG.  
The primary  rule for handling  the IHTG  missing  data at Week  24 is the use of the baseline  at Week  
24 in case the mean  change from  baseline  in placebo  group is equal  to zero or is an  improvement  
or if the reason  for missing  data is definitely  not related  to treatment  or disease  progression.  If the 
relative  change  from  baseline  to week  24 in the placebo  group  is a deterioration  of IHTG  then the 
relative  deterioration  observed  in the placebo  group  will be applied  to all missing  IHTG  at week  
24 that are possibly  related  to treatment  or disease  progression.  
 
Sensitivity  analyses  
The primary  analysis  of the primary  efficacy  assessment  will be performed  after the following  
modification.  
• Use of the randomized  set of patients.  
• Use of the evaluable  set of patients  
• Use of the per protocol  set of patients  
Page  73 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 • Use of a non-parametric  test (Mann  and Whitney)  especially  in case of outliers  or if the 
distribution  of change  from  baseline  is quite  skewed.  Hodge  Lehmann  estimator  will be 
used to estimate  the magnitude  of treatment  effect.  
• Use of the Q3 (third  quartile)  estimate  of the relative  change  from  baseline  to week  24 of 
the placebo  distribution  (from  the most  improved  to the most  worsened)  for imputing  
missing  IHTG  at week  24. 
 
Secondary  efficacy  analyses  of the primary  efficacy  assessment  
The following  proportions  will be estimated  per treatment  group  with the Clopper  Pearson  95% 
CI and compared  with a Fisher  exact  test in the FAS,  the evaluable  set of patients  and per protocol  
set of patients:  
• Proportion  of “responders”  defined  as the percentage  of patients  reaching  a decrease  
from  baseline  in IHTG  (quantified  by 1H-MRS)  ≥ 30% at  24 weeks.  In case of missing  
outcome  at weeks  24 the patient  is a non-responder.  
• Proportion  of patients  considered  as having  resolution  of NAFLD  (≤ 5.5%  IHTG  
quantified  by 1H- MRS)  at 24 weeks.  
 
Other  secondary  analyses  
• Between  treatment  difference  in the change  from  baseline  to week  24 in hepatic  fibrosis  
will be estimated  and tested  with a general  linear  model  for each technique  used:  
a) Vibration -controlled  transient  elastography  (Fibroscan);  
b) two-dimensional  magnetic  resonance  elastography  (2D-MRE);  and 
c) T1 MRI mapping.  
The general  statistical  approach  will be similar  to the primary  analysis  and subordinated  
analyses.  
 
• Between  treatment  difference  in the change  from  baseline  to week  24 in each plasma  
biomarkers  of liver fibrosis  (cytokeratin  CK-18, proC3)  will be estimated  and tested  
using  the same  approach  as the primary  analysis.  
 
• Between  treatment  difference  in the change  from  baseline  to week  24 in metabolic  
outcomes  will also be estimated  and tested  for: 
o Hepatic  insulin  sensitivity,  gluconeogenesis  and de novo  lipogenesis  (DNL).  
o Oral glucose  tolerance  test. 
o Glycemic  control:  HbA1c,  advanced  lipid testing.  
o Biomarkers   of  adipose  tissue  metabolism   (i.e.,  plasma   adiponectin   and 
adipokine  panels  measured  by the gold-standard  Millipore  multiplex  platform).  
• The percentage  of patients  achieving  an improvement  in HbA1c  or plasma  lipid targets  
will be analyzed  using  a logistic  regression  model  with treatment  and baseline  HbA1c  
and lipid profile  as covariates,  respectively.  
• The time course  of repeated  measures  of FPG,  HbA1c,  lipid parameters,  and others  will 
be estimated  and tested  using  mixed  models  for repeated  measures  to account  for the 
correlation  amongst  measures  after careful  selection  of the proper  covariance  structure.  
• Hypoglycaemia  rate will be fitted  to a negative  binomial  model  to test the treatment  
effect.  
• The percentage  of patients  having  a hypoglycaemia  reported  or not as AE will be 
Page  74 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 analyzed  using  a loglikelihood  test, unless  there  are too few events  in which  case a 
Fisher  exact  test will be used.  
• DNA  testing  to assess  SNPs  related  to NAFLD  (PNPLA3, TM6SF2,  others).  
• Immunohistochemistry:  change  in the semi -quantitative  score  of ballooning  and stellate  
cell activation  from  baseline  to end of treatment  (week  24) will be compared  using  a 
Wilcoxon  Mann  Whitney  test. 
Planned  exploratory  analyses:  
The SAP will provide  more  details  on the presented  analyses  as well as on other  exploratory  criteria  
such as quality  of life assessment.  
All secondary  efficacy  analyses will be performed  using  a mixed  model  for repeated measures or 
an ANCOVA  model  if only one post-randomization  measure  is available.  CMH  test stratified  on 
diabetes  will be used for qualitative  variables.  
Exploratory  analyses  on the biomarkers  measurements  and other  evaluations  will be proposed  and 
described  in the statistical  analysis  plan.  
The final version  of the Statistical  Analysis  Plan will be issued  before  freezing  of the database  the 
break  of the randomization  code.  Any clarification  brought  in the SAP concerning  handling  of data 
and statistical  analyses  will prevail  over any other  interpretations  of the protocol  unless  it is the 
source  of major  inconsistencies.  
 
 
9 Patient  Withdrawal  & Replacement  & Clinical  Trial  
Stopping  Rules  
9.1 Patient  Withdrawal  
Participation  in the study  is strictly  voluntary.  The patients  have  the right  to withdraw  from  the 
study  at any time for any reason,  without the need to justify. The investigator  also has the right to  
withdraw  patients in case of safety concerns, protocol deviations or administrative  reasons.  Since 
an excessive  rate of withdrawals  can render  the study  uninterpretable,  the unnecessary  withdrawal  
of patients  must  be avoided.  
Reasons  of withdrawal  include,  but are not limited,  to the following:  
• Patient  decision  
• Lost to follow -up, death  
• Any AE, laboratory  abnormality  or illness  which,  in the opinion  of the investigator,  
indicates  that continued  treatment  with study  therapy  and participation  in the trial is not in 
the best interest  of the subject.  
• Major  protocol  deviation:  e.g. lack of compliance  with scheduled  visits,  non-compliance  
with study  treatment,  treatment  with prohibited  medication  during  the study  (see section  
4.3.3 ) 
• Any deteriorati on in cardiac  status  
• CTCAE  grade  3 or higher  possibly  or probably  related  to study  drug OR CTCAE  grade  4 
or higher  regardless  of attribution  to study  drug 
• Additional  individual  discontinuation  should  be based  on known  toxicities  and side effects  
of the drug and its class,  specifically  for metabolic,  renal,  hematologic,  and hepatic  toxicity.  
If any of the following  criteria  are met, the patient  should  be immediately  discontinued  
from  drug and followed  until resolution  of adverse  events  and laboratory  values  have  
Page  75 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 returned  to baseline.  
1. Total  Bilirubin  ≥ 3.0 md/DL  
2. Total  CPK  > 5X ULN  
3. Lipase  level  increase  above  inclusion  criteria  (i.e., lipase  above  1.3X  ULN  if not on a 
DPP -IV inhibitor,  or >2.0X  ULN  if on a DPP-IV inhibitor)  and re-confirmed  on testing  
within  7 days;  or lipase  > ULN  in any patient  with symptoms  compatible  with 
pancreatitis;  or in asymptomatic  patient  with lipase  above  inclusion  criteria  and when  
retested  (without  drug interruption)  remains  above  inclusion  criteria  within  7 days.  
4. eGFR  with a decrease  of more  than 20% below  the lower  limit of inclusion  criteria  (or < 
48 ml/min/1.73  m2) and where  the value  is reconfirmed  after 24 - 48 hours  repeat.  
Additionally,  any subject  who requires  renal  replacement  therapy  should  also be 
discontinued  from  drug.  
5. Hemoglobin  < 10 mg/dL  or HCT  < 30% 
6. Platelets  < 100,000  per microliter  of blood  
7.   WBC  < 2.5 x 109/L and /or ANC  <1.5 K/µL  
8. Regarding  hepatic  toxicity  
o For BLM < 2x ULN,  for ALT  or AST  >5x BLM  
o For BLM  ≥2X ULN but < 5X  ULN,  for ALT or AST > 3X  BLM  
o For BLM  ≥ 5X  ULN,  for ALT or AST > 2X  BLM  
o For ALT  or AST  increase  > 2X BLM  accompanied  by a concomitant  total 
bilirubin  increase  to > 2X BLM  OR an INR increase  by > 0.2 
For elevations  of liver enzymes  accompanied  by symptoms  consistent  with 
hepatic  injury  [e.g.,  fatigue,  nausea,  vomiting,  right upper  quadrant  pain or 
tenderness,  fever,  rash,  and/or  eosinophilia  
(>5%)] http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/.../Guidances/UCM174090.pdf  
• Investigator’s  decision  for any other  reason  
If a patient  discontinues  the study,  the investigator  will make  reasonable  efforts  to obtain  the reason  
and to  perform  all protocol -defined end of study  assessments  as soon  as possible.  The reason  and 
circumstances  for premature  discontinuation  (e.g. consent  withdrawal,  AE, lost to follow  up, etc.),  
and the date of withdrawal  must  be documented  in the eCRF.  If a patient  discontinues  the study  
for safety  reasons,  the outcome  must  be known.  
In the case of withdrawal  due to pregnancy  (see section  6.2.2 ), the patient  will be followed  until 
outcome,  i.e. at least on a quarterly  basis  for follow -up evaluation  of the pregnancy,  fetus,  delivery  
and new born.  In the case of withdrawal  due to an AE the patient  will be followed  until resolution  
of the AE, or until in the opinion  of the Investigator  the event  has stabilized,  and the patient  is 
referred  to their primary  physician  for appropriate  management  of the ongoing  event.  Reasonable  
efforts  will be made  to contact  a patient  who fails to attend  any follow -up appointments,  in order  
to ensure  that he/she  is in satisfactory  health.  
Health  data and biological  samples  collected  during  the whole  participation  of the patient  will be 
analyzed  at the end of the study,  and the biological  samples  stored  up to one year after the 
completion  of the study  and destroyed.  
 
9.2 Study  Stopping  Rules  
In addition,  the trial will be stopped  if: 
Page  76 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 1. Three  patients  develop  the same  Grade  3 CTCAE  
2. OR two patients  develop  any Grade  4 CTCAE   
3.  OR one patient  develops  a Grade  5 CTCAE  
9.3 Unblinding  Process  
9.3.1 Unblinding  for emergency  
The code  breaks  sealed  envelopes  will be provided  and will be kept by the Principal  Investigator.  
The Principal  Investigator  is responsible  for ensuring  appropriately  trained  staff members  are 
available  to open  code  breaks  sealed  envelopes  when  required  for medical  emergencies  which  may 
be required  out of normal  working  hours.  
Sealed  envelopes  containing  the code-break  information  will be provided  to the 
Pharmacovigilance  and safety  Institution  (Stragen,  see section  2.3). 
Details  of any emergency  unblinding  shall  be documented  fully in the Investigator’s  file and 
research  pharmacy  file(s).  This includes,  but may not be limited  to: 
1) Date,  
2) Subject  details,  
3) Reason  for unblinding,  
4) The results,  
5) Name  and role of the individual  requesting  the unblinding,  
6) Name  and role of the individual  carrying  out the unblinding.  
If the clinical  trial research  pharmacy  or an individual  as named  on the Delegation  Log has 
performed  the procedure,  they will inform  the Principal  Investigator,  the trial identifier,  subject  
number  and name  and title of the person  making  the request,  but NOT  the result.  The details  shall  
be included  in the statistical  report.  
 
 
9.3.2 Unblinding  for DSMB  
The Principal  Investigator  will create  a University  of Florida  Data Safety  and Monitoring  Board  
(DSMB)  to ensure  safety  surveillance  during  the study.  This safety  committee  may recommend  
unblinding  of any data for further  analysis  is deemed  necessary  for the safety  of the subjects.  If so, 
the Principal  Investigator  will be notified,  and an independent  ad hoc group  will be created  in order  
to maintain  the blinding  of the study  and of the participating  personnel.  
 
 
9.3.3 Unblinding  at End of Trial  
The Statistical  Analysis  Plan shall be provided  in the protocol  or be finalized  prior  to the release  
of the randomization  codes.  Changes  to the statistical  analysis plan shall be version  controlled. A 
record  shall  be kept in the Investigator  TMF  to confirm  when  the randomization  code  was 
requested  and when  provided.  
 
 
10 Training & Information 
10.1 Training  
All persons  involved  in the study  will be trained  in an effort  to standardize  relevant  methods,  
ratings  and data capture  and to prevent  deviations.  
Page  77 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
  
 
10.2 Information  of the Investigator  
The investigator  will receive  all the relevant  information  for a safe use of the IMP as the study  
proceeds.  
 
 
11 Records & Data  
11.1 Source  Records  & Data  
Source  data are all the information  in original  records  and certified  copies  of original  records  of 
clinical  findings,  observations,  or other  activities  in the study,  which  are necessary  for the 
reconstruction  and evaluation  of the study.  The investigator  will permit  study -related  monitoring,  
audits,  IEC reviews  and regulatory  inspections,  with a direct  access  to all the required  source  
records.  For each patient  enrolled,  the investigator  will note in the source  records  that the patient  
participates  in this study,  and will record  the following  information:  concomitant  therapies,  
clinically  significant  adverse  events  and a statement  at patient  end of participation.  
 
 
11.2 Case  Report  Forms  
Electronic  Case  Report  Form  (eCRF)  will be provided  by the research  team.  The investigator  is 
responsible  for maintaining  adequate  and accurate  data into the eCRF  which  has been  designed  to 
record  all observations  and other  data pertinent  to the clinical  investigation.  
All data requested  on the eCRF  must  be filled  out completely  by the investigator  or the investigator  
team.  All data captured  for the study  is planned  to be electronic.  The eCRF  should  be reviewed  
and electronically  approved  by the investigator.  
All missing  data must  be explained.  If any entry  error  has been  made,  to correct  such an error,  
enter  the correct  data above  it. All such changes  will be must  electronically  signed  with the reason  
for the correction  if necessary,  by an authorized  (investigator/co -worker)  person.  
eCRF  and all other  source  data must  be easily  accessible  for review  during  the programmed  
monitoring  visits.  Once  the clinical  monitor  has verified  the contents  of the completed  eCRF  
against  the source  data,  the system  will be verified  electronically  by the clinical  monitor  for those  
pages.  Queries  may be raised  if the data are unclear  or contradictory,  which must  be addressed  by 
the investigator.  
Patients  are not to be identified  in the eCRF  by name  or initials  and birth date. Appropriate  coded  
identification,  e.g. patient  number  in combination  with year of birth  must  be used.  
 
 
12 Confidentiality  
12.1 Confidentiality  of Patient  Data  
The Principal  investigator  will ensure  that the confidentiality  of the patients’  data is preserved.  On 
eCRFs  or any other  documents  for the patients  will not be identified  by their names,  but by a study  
code.  Documents  not for transmission  e.g. the confidential  PHI and the signed  informed  consent  
forms  will be maintained  by the investigator  in strict  confidence.  
These  data will be collected  and processed  with full precautions  to ensure  confidentiality  and 
compliance  with applicable  UF IRB data privacy  protection  laws and regulations.  Technical  and 
organizational  measures  will be in place  to fully protect  PHI against  unauthorized  disclosures  or 
Page  78 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 access,  accidental  or unlawful  destruction,  or accidental  loss or alterations.  Any personnel  with 
access  to personal  data must  agree  to keep  the identity  of subjects  strictly  confidential.  
The informed  consent  that will be obtained  from  all participants  includes  explicit  consent  to access  
and process  PHI and for the investigator/institution  to allow  direct  access  to the original  medical  
records  (source  data/documents)  for study -related  monitoring,  audit,  IRB review,  and regulatory  
inspection.  This consent  also addresses  the transfer  of de-ident ified datasets  to be shared  with to 
other  countries  (e.g.,  Inventiva  headquarters)  or other  authorized  entities  (e.g.,  FDA).  
The participant  retains  the right to request  through  the PI access  to their personal  data and 
rectification  of any data considered  to be incorrect  or incomplete.  Reasonable  steps  will be taken  
to respond  to these  requests,  taking  into consideration  the nature  of the request,  the conditions  of 
the study,  and the applicable  laws and regulations.  
 
12.2 Confidentiality  of Data  
Any information  on the IMP,  this study  and its results  is confidential  information.  The investigator,  
study  site personnel  and IEC members  will not use, publish,  or otherwise  disclose  any confidential  
information  without  the prior  written  authorization  from  Inventiva  S.A. Any data,  results,  
inventions  and patents  that may arise  from  this study  will be the exclusive  property  of Inventiva  
S.A. 
 
 
13 Reporting  & Publication  
13.1 Study  Report  
All the relevant  data and information  will be reported  in a study  report  prepared  by a CRO  and 
submitted  to the investigators  for review  comments  and signature.  The final study  report  will be 
used for the further  development  of the IMP and regulatory  submissions.  
 
 
13.2 Disclosure  of Data  and Publications  
No information  provided  by Inventiva  SA to the Investigators  for the purposes  of performing  the 
study,  will be published,  or passed  on to a third  party,  without  prior  written  approval  by Inventiva  
SA. 
The investigators  will have full access  to all of the study  data and will take complete  responsibility  
for the integrity  of the data and the relevance  of the data analysis  and reporting.  
After  regulatory  clearance,  the study  will be registered  by the Principal  Investigator  in the 
ClinTrials.gov  database.  The Principal  Investigator  or anyone  else working  on the study  will 
submit  all proposed  publications,  papers,  abstracts  or other  written  materials  or an outline  of any 
proposed  oral presentation  related  to the study  to Inventiva  SA at least 1 month  prior  to (i) 
submission  of such written  materials  for publication,  or (ii) any proposed  oral disclosure  to a third 
party.  Inventiva  SA shall have  the right  to comment  on such written  material/outline  and to take 
any necessary action  to protect its intellectual  property;  the Principal  Investigator, in determining  
the final form  of disclosure,  shall  consider  such comments  in good  faith.  Notwithstanding  any of 
the above,  the Principal  Investigator  or anyone  else working  on the Study  may not include  any 
confidential  information  unrelated  to the study  in any such publication  or disclosure.  
The Investigator  will provide  Inventiva  SA with complete  test results  and all data derived  from  the 
study  in accordance  with the protocol.  
Only  Inventiva  SA and its authorized  contractor  may make  information  obtained  during  the study  
available  to regulatory  agencies,  except  as required  by regulation.

14 Record  Keeping  
14.1 Study  Site Records  
The Principal  Investigator  is responsible  for maintaining  all the records  which  enable  the conduct  
of the study  at the study  site to be fully understood.  The study  documentation  and source  records  
will be archived  for the maximum  period  of time permitted  by local  requirements.  The Principal  
Investigator  will complete  the confidential  patient  identification  list which  provides  the sole link 
between  source  records  and anonymous  eCRF  data.  The Principal  Investigator  will retain  this 
confidential  list and the signed  consent  forms  for at least fifteen  years  after the completion  or 
discontinuation  of the study.  No study  site records  may be destroyed  without  prior  written  
agreement  between  the Principal  Investigator  and Inventiva  S.A. If the Principal  Investigator  
intends  to assign  the study  documents  to another  party,  or to move  them  to another  location,  
Inventiva  S.A. must  be notified.  
 
 
14.2 Study  Master  File 
The Principal  Investigator  will archive  the study  master  file in accordance  with GCP  and applicable  
regulatory  requirements.

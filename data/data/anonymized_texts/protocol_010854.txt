1. INTRODUCTION  
Ocrelizumab  (OCR) , a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and 
destroys CD2 0-expressing lymphocytes  (B-cell lymphocytes), has demonstrated robust 
efficacy in reducing relapse rate, sustained disability worsening, and MRI indicators of 
disease activity in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS)1. For patients with 
primary progressive MS (PPMS), OCR  demonstrated reduction in disability progression 
compared to patients receiving the placebo treatment2. The medication is well -tolerated 
with upper respiratory infections being the most common potential side effect followed 
by infusion -related reactions  (IRRs) . At least one infusion reaction oc curred in 34.3% of 
the p atients in OPERA I and OPERA II1. The majority of the infusion reactions were 
mild to moderate and occurred with the first infusion of dose  1. In the clinical tria ls, all 
patients were pre -medicated with 100mg of methylprednisolone, and per the protocol , 
an analgesic/antipyretic such as acetaminophen and an IV or oral antihistamine such as 
diphenhydramine 50mg were recommended to use prior to  starting OCR  to minimiz e 
IRRs . However, drowsiness is commonly associated with diphenhydramine; therefore, a 
newer antihistamine such as cetirizine m ay be tolerated better without an increase in 
IRRs . 
 
2. OBJECTIVES  
2.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
The primary objec tive of this pilot study  is to evaluate whether there is some evidence 
that cetirizine is non -inferior to diphenhydramine in limiting the proportion and severity 
of reactions  from OCR infusion s. 
 
2.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVE  
The secondary objective of this stud y is to evaluate patient  treatment satisfaction after 
receiving cetirizine and diphenhydramine  as premedication for OCR infusion s. 
 
3.     STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY  
This 6 -month randomized controlled pilot study will determine whether there is som e 
evidence that cetirizi ne is better tolerated than diphenhydramine without an increase in 
IRRs . Fifty -two patients, 26 patients per arm, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
cetirizine or diphenhydramine as premedication prior to OCR  infusions on day 0 (1st 
half dose  of 300mg ), day 14 (2nd half dose  of 300mg ) and week 24 ( 1st full dose  of 
600mg ). Neuro logical exam s and the estimated Expanded Disability Status Scale 
(EDSS ) will be obtained at screening and week 24 , as well as premature termination 
visits, if applicable . Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), and the Visual Analog Scale – 
Fatigue (VAS-F) will be administered at screening, baseline, day 14, and week 24. 
Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) and Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS -29) 
will b e administered at screen ing and week 24 . MSIS -29 and MFIS will also be 
administered at premature termination, if applicable. Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM)  will be administered at baseline, day 14, and 
week 24. TSQM , SSS, and VA S-F will be administered  within 2 hours after each OCR  
infusion , followed by a phone call on the next business day following each infusion to 
collect and assess infusion reactions or other AEs.  
 
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page 4 of 33  3.2 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
Shortly after  the approval of OCR , we follow ed the premedication protocol used in 
OPERA I and II which included 100mg of methylprednisolone, 1 gram of 
acetaminophen, and 50mg of IV diphenhydramine. However, many patients 
experienced extreme sedation which caused  severe drowsiness and impaired their 
ability to  function, drive , or work during and after the infusion, and even the following 
day. As a result, we have decreased the dose of diphenhydramine to 25mg 
administered either IV or orally which has resulted in less , but still marked , drowsiness. 
Newer antihis tamines such as cetirizine may be better tolerated ; however, there is no 
evidence that they will be as effective in minimizing infusion reactions.  
 
3.3 OUTCOME MEASURES  
 
3.3.1  Primary Outcome Measure  
The proportion of patients having an  infusion -related reacti on, as defined by the 
Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE) , version 43 during or after the first -half dose of 
the first infusion on day 0. Infusion -related reactions will be documented at the infusion 
clinic o n the day of the infusion and reported by the patient at the follow -up phone call 
the next business day after the infusion.  
 
3.3.2  Secondary Outcome Measures  
The proportion of patients having an infusion -related reaction during or after r eceiving 
the second half  dose infusion on day 14.  
 
The proportion of patients having an infusion -related reaction during or after receiving 
the first full 600mg dose infusion on week 24 . 
 
TSQM (Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication) score aft er the infusions 
on day 0, day 14, and week 24 . 
 
SSS (Stanford Sleepiness Scale) score after the infusions on day 0, day 14, and week 
24. 
 
VAS-F (Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue) score after the infusions on day 0, day 14, and 
week 24.  
 
MFIS (Modified Fati gue Impact Scale) score at week 24 .  
 
Physical and psychological MSIS -29 (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale) scores at week 
24. 
 
3.4 SAFETY PLAN  
Patients will be evaluated by a clinician at the start of the study  and at week 24  prior to 
the 600mg OCR  infusion . Phone visits will be cond ucted after each infusion (see 
Section 4.5 , Study Assessment s, and Appendix A, Study Flowchart).  
A full neurologic al examination will be conducted at screening  and week 24 . Any 
worsening or new abnormality (including laboratory resu lts) that is determined by the 
investigator as clinically significant will be recorded as  an AE and will be monitored until 
resolution or stabilization. MS related symptoms are not to be reported as AEs unless, 
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page 5 of 33  in the opinion of the investigator, the sympt oms are unusually seriou s and relevant.  
 
The recommendation from the OCR prescribing information dated 12/20204 is to pre -
medicate with  100mg of methylprednisolone  (or an equivalent corticosteroid) 
administered 30 minutes prior to each OCR  infusion to reduce the frequency and 
severity of infusion -related reactions (IRRs)  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) in 
prescribing information4].  
 
For this study, all patients will receive 1,000mg of acetaminophen orally and 100mg of 
methylprednisolone via IV 30-60 minutes prior to each infusion.  Additionally, pat ients 
will be randomized  to receive e ither diphenhydramine 25mg orally or cetirizine  10mg 
orally  30-60 minutes prior to each OCR  infusion  to further reduce the frequency and 
severity of infusion reactions .  
 
Recommended m edications to be available if there  is an infusion reaction  (per treating 
investigator discretion) : 
A. Epinephrine – anaphylaxis  
B. Albuterol – bronchospasm or hypoxia  
C. Famotidine 20mg IV – hives, itching, or anaphylaxis  
D. Oxygen therapy – shortness of breath, chest pain, or hypoxia  
E. Acetaminophen – pain, fever, and headach es 
F. Methylprednisolone – hives, itching, shortness of breath, or anaphylaxis  
 
Suggested Management of IRRs  
 
All CD20+ depleting agents administered via the intravenous route, including OCR, 
have been associated with acute IRRs. Sympt oms of IRRs may occur du ring any 
ocrelizumab infusion, but have been more frequently reported during the first infusion. 
Physicians should alert patients that IRRs can occur within 24 hours of the infusion. 
These reactions may present as pruritus, rash, ur ticaria, erythema, throa t irritation, 
oropharyngeal pain, dyspnea, pharyngeal or laryngeal edema, flushing, hypotension, 
pyrexia, fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea, and tachycardia.  
 
Patients should be observed for at least one hour after the completion  of the infusion for 
any symptom of IRR. They will be informed about the possibility of delayed post -
infusion symptoms and instructed to contact their study physician if they develop such 
symptoms.  
 
Hypotension, as a symptom of IRR, may occur during ocreli zumab infusions. Therefo re, 
withholding of antihypertensive treatments should be considered for 12 hours prior to 
and throughout each ocrelizumab infusion.  
 
Severe IRRs  
If a patient experiences a severe IRR or a complex of flushing, fever, and throat pain 
symptoms, the infusion s hould be interrupted immediately and the patient should 
receive symptomatic treatment. The infusion should be re -started only after all 
symptoms have resolved. The initial infusion rate at restart should be half of the infusion 
rate at the time of onset of  the reaction.  
 
Mild-Moderate IRRs  
If the event that a patient experiences is a mild to moderate IRR (e.g. headache), the 
infusion rate should be reduced to half the rate at the time of the event. This reduced 
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page 6 of 33  rate should be maintai ned for at least 30 minu tes. If tolerated, the infusion rate may 
then be increased according to the patient’s initial infusion schedule.  
 
See Section  5.1, Assessment of Safety , for complete details of the safety evaluation for

arm to be administered before their OCR doses, after inform ed consent and  screening 
assessment have been completed.  The premedication  and OCR  will be pai d for by the 
patient or  by the patient’s insurance. Patients may receive any generic product s of 
cetirizine or diphenhydramine  that are available at their infusion center and d o not 
require the same  brand of the prem edication for their subsequent infusions .  The same 
brand does not need to be used at each OCR infusion, per patient.  
 
4.3.1  Packaging, Preparation, Storage, Handling, Dosage , and  Administration  
Packaging, Preparation,  Storage and Handlin g 
The study team is no t responsible for collecting or reviewing data on how the 
premedication s or OCR  were packaged, prepared, stored, or handled  for the purposes 
of this tria l.  
 
The treating physician will refer to the specific prescr ibing information pr ovided by the 
drug man ufacture s for detailed instructions on packaging, preparation, storage , and 
handling for both  the premedication s and OCR4. The standard of care process is to be 
followed.  
 
Dosage  and Administration  
1. Patients will be randomized to either di phenhydramine 25mg orally or cetirizine 
10mg orally. The patients randomized to diphenhydra mine will receive 
diphenhydramine 25mg orally 30 -60 minutes prior to each OCR infusion. The 
patients randomized to cetirizine will receive  cetirizine 10mg orally 30 -60 minutes 
prior to each OCR infusion.  
 
The treating physician will refer to the specific p rescribing information  provided by 
the drug manufacture s for detailed instructions on administration  of the 
premedication s. The standard of care process is to be fol lowed.  
 
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page 8 of 33   
2. OCR  300mg IV will be given on Day 0 and repeated with the same dose on Day 
14±2 . Patients will then receive OCR  600mg IV at 24 weeks .  
 
Although OCR  may be administered on an  outpatient basis, patients may be 
hospitalized for observation at the d iscretion of the investigator. OCR  infusions 
should always be administered in a hospital or clinic environment under close 
supervision of the investigator or a me dically qualified staf f member.  
 
The treating physician will refer to the OCR prescribing info rmation for detailed 
instructions on administration4. The standard of care process is to be followed.  
 
4.3.2  Dosage Modification  
Dose modification s of diphenhydramine or cetirizine are not permitted . See secti on 3.4 
for dose modifications of OCR in the case of IRRs.  
4.4 CONCOMITA NT AND EXCLUDED THERAPY  
All concomitant medications  are allowed except immunosuppressants, lymphocyte -
depleting agents, or lymphocyte -trafficking blockers while p atients are receiving OCR . 
All medications including over -the-counter medication and supplemen ts will be recorded 
at each clinical visit. At screening, all medications taken 4 weeks prior to screening will 
be reviewed and recorded , as well as all prior lif etime MS disease modif ying therapies 
taken by the patient.

4.9.1  Analysis of the Conduct of the Study  
For the prim ary, non -inferiority endpoint, analysis will be on both the intention -to-treat 
and per -protocol populations  (two-sample prop ortion non -inferiority test) . Analysis for 
secondary endpoints wil l be on the intention -to-treat population. The intention -to-treat 
population is defined as all randomized patients, and the per -protocol population will be 
those who completed the study as p er protocol specification.  
 
If the study is termi nated before planned enrollment is reached , only descriptive 
analy sis will be performed .  
 
4.9.2  Analysis of Treatment Group Comp arability  
Baseline characteristics will be reported by arm. Catego rical variab les will be 
summarized as frequency and proportion and continuous variables by mean and 
standard deviation or median and 25th and 75th percentiles, as appropriate based on 
normal ity.  
 
4.9.3  Efficacy Analysis  
a. Primary Endpoint  
The proportion of patients with IRRs during or after the first infusion on day 0 will be 
reported for each arm. Cetirizine will be considered non -inferior to diphenhydramine if 
the lower  limit of the two-sided, 90% confidence interval for the difference in proportions 
(diphenhydrami ne-cetirizine) is greater than the non -inferiority margin of -0.305.  
 
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page 12 of 33  b. Secondary Endpoints  
The proportion of patients with IRRs during or  after infusion  will be compared using 
Fisher’s exact tests  at day  14 and week 24 , as we expect the proportion of IRRs to be 
small at these time points based on OPERA I and II . Additionally, the proportion of IRRs 
after each infusion will be plotted overal l and by severity for the two arms. At day 0, day 
14, and week 24,  TSQM scores will be compared between arms using Wilcoxon Rank 
Sum or two -sample t -tests, as appropriate based on normality , and SSS and VA S-F 
scores will be compared  using Wilcoxon rank sum  tests . MFIS, physical MSIS -29, and 
psychological MSIS -29 will be compared at week 24  using multiple linear regression 
with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), adjusting for the screening score.  
 
4.9.4  Safety Analysis  
Information on the timing, severity, rela tionship to premedication , relationship  to OCR 
therapy, effect on therapy, and degree of seriousness of adverse events will be 
collected from and summarized for all patients.   
 
4.9.5  Missing Data  
Baseline characteristics and outcomes  for patients who follo wed protocol and 
completed the study , violated protocol, and disco ntinued the study will be reported 
separately.  The reasons for discontinuing or violating protocol  will be reported and any 
influence on the trial results will be discussed. Any other irregu larities that result in 
missing data wi ll be fully identified and discussed.   
For the primary endpoint using the intention -to-treat population, the missing data 
mechanism will be examined and multiple imputation or best/worst imputation will be 
used, assum ing missing at random. For the  primary endpoint , assessed at day 0 , we 
expect missing data will be limited.   
 
4.9.6  Determination of Sample Size  
Based on the results of the OPERA I and II trials, we assume that 25% of patients in the 
diphenhydramine arm  and 25% of patients in the cetirizine arm  will experience mild to 
severe IRRs during or after receiving the first infusion on day 0. Assuming that a 30% 
absolute  difference  (i.e. margin = - 0.30) in the proportion of patients with IRR s between 
premedication groups is the maximum relevant differen ce when holding that cetiri zine is 
not inferior to diphenhydramine, 26 patients per arm are needed to achieve 80% power 
with a one-sided significance level  of 0.05 . As this is a pilot study, we allow a large 
margin to  establish some evidence of non-inferio rity. The two -sample propor tion test for 
non-inferiority in the R package Trial  Size was used for the calculation.  
 
4.10 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Accurate, consistent, and reliable data will be ensured through the use of standard 
practices and procedures.   
 
5. REPORTING OF ADVERSE EV ENTS   
At the time of consenting, each patient will be given the names and telephone number s 
of the study personnel for reporting AE’s.  The investigator must conduct thorough 
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page 13 of 33  assessment to de termine the severity of the AE and the relationship to the 
premedi cation  and OCR . The investigator must review the laboratory findings for 
significance (all out of range values must be assessed as clinically significant or not 
clinically significant) and s ign and date the laboratory report.  All clinically significant 
laboratory findings must be reported as adverse events. MS related symptoms are not 
to be reported as AEs unless, in the opinion of the investigator, the symptoms are 
unusually serious and rele vant. Any AE of severity moderate or hi gher, requires follow 
up until resolution or stabilization  by the treating investigator beyond the final study 
contact  as part of standard care . 
 
All AEs should be recorded in the patient’s AE case report form regardl ess of severity 
or relationship to the premedication  or OC R.  
 
Infusion -Related Reactions (IRRs)  
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after OCR  administration and are 
judged to be related to OCR  infusion should be captured as a diagnosis (e. g., “infusion -
related reaction” or “ana phylactic reaction” ) on the Adverse Event eCRF. If possible, 
avoid ambiguous terms such as “systemic reaction.” Associated signs and symptoms 
should be recorded on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction eCRF. If a pa tient 
experiences both a local and syst emic reaction to th e same dose of OCR , each reaction 
should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs and symptoms 
also recorded separately on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction eCRF.  
 
Investig ators should consider a local IRR for a ny symptoms affecti ng the skin and 
localized to only one place. Any other IRR should be considered systemic.  
 
Severity  
The adverse event severity gradi ng scale for the NCI CTCAE (v5.0 ) will be used for 
assessing adver se event severity.  The b elow table should be used for ass essing 
severity for adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.  
Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale for Events Not Specifically Listed in NCI  CTCAE  
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services

Note:  Based on the most r ecent version of NCI CTCAE (v5 .0), which can be found at:  
http://ctep.cancer.go v/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
a. Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the 
telephone, managing money, etc.  
b. Examples of self -care activities of dai ly living include b athing, dressing and undressing, feeding oneself, using 
the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by patients who are not bedridden.  
c. If an event is assessed as a “significant medical event, ” it must be reported as a serious advers e event .  
d. Grade 4  and 5 events must be reported as serious adverse events .  
 
Relationship to Premedication  and OCR  
The relationship or association of the AE to the premedication and OCR will be 
characterized as foll ows: 
 
Not related  Any event that does n ot follow a reaso nable temporal sequence from 
administration of drug AND  that is likely to have been produced by the 
patient ’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the 
patient . 
 
Unlikely  Any event that does not follow a reasonable tempo ral sequence from  
administration of drug OR that is likely to have been produced by the 
patient ’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the 
patient . 
 
Possibly  Any reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration o f drug OR that fo llows a known response pattern to the 
suspected drug AND  that could not be reasonably explained by the 
known characteristics of the patient ’s clinical state or other modes of 
therapy administered to t he patient . 
 
Related  Any reaction that follows a reasona ble temporal sequence from 
administration of drug AND  that follows a known response pattern to the 
suspected drug AND  that recurs with re -challenge, AND/OR  is improved 
by stopping the drug or reducing  the dose.  
 
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page 15 of 33  5.1  ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
Specification of S afety Variables  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and reporting adverse events ( AEs) and 
serious adverse events (SAEs) that are considered related to  the premedication  or 
OCR , per protoco l. This includes  all events of death, a nd any study s pecific issue of 
concern.  
Adverse Events  
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of the premedication , OCR,  or other protocol -imposed 
interven tion, whether or not there is a causal relationship w ith OCR  or the 
premedication . 
 
This includes the following:  
• AEs not previously observed in the patient  that emerge during the protocol -specified 
AE reporting period.  
 
• Complications that occur as a result  of protocol -mandated interventions (e. g., 
procedure s such as OCR infusions) . 
 
 
• If applicable, A Es that occur after signing consent, prior to assignment of study 
treatment associated with medication washout, no treatment run -in, or other protocol -
mandated i ntervention.  
 
• Preexisting medical cond itions (othe r than the condition being studied) judged by 
the investigator to have worsened in severity or frequency or changed in character 
during the protocol -specified AE reporting period.  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
An AE should be classified as an SAE if any of the following criteria are met:  
• It results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death).  
• It is life threatening (i.e.,  the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient  at immediate risk of  death. It does not include an AE tha t, had it oc curred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death.).  
• It requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization.  
• It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the patient ’s ability t o conduct no rmal life functions).  
• It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a 
mother  exposed to the premedication  and/or OCR.  
• It is considered a significant medical event by the investi gator based on medical 
judgment (e.g. , may jeopar dize the patient  or may require medical/surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above).  
 
 
5.2  METHODS AND TIMING FOR ASSESSING AND RECORDING SAFETY VARIABLES  
 
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page 16 of 33  The investigator is respons ible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are observed or 
reported during the study, are collected and reported to the FDA (as applicable) , 
appropriate IRB(s)  (as applicable) , and Genentech, Inc. , in accordance with CFR 
312.32 (IND Safety Reports).  
Adve rse Event Reporting Period  
The study period d uring which all AEs and SAEs must be reported begins after 
informed consent is obtained and ends 30 days following the last administration of 
study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is ea rlier. After this 
period, investigato rs should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study 
treatment.  
Assessment of Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs whether volunteered by the patient , discovered by study personnel 
during questioning, or detected th rough examination, laboratory test, o r other means 
will be reported appropriately. Each reported AE or SAE will be described by its 
duration (i.e.,  start and end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, 
suspected relationship to OCR  (see abov e guidance)  and premedication , and ac tions 
taken.  
 
Expected versus unexpected is to be evaluated for SAEs.  
 
Expected adverse events are those adverse events that are listed or characterized in 
the current prescribing information4.  
 
Unexpected adverse  events are those not listed in the prescribing information4 or not 
identified. This includes adverse events for which the specificity or severity is not 
consistent with the description in the prescribing information.  For example, under this 
definition , hepatic necrosis would be unexpecte d if the prescribing information  only 
referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  
 
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy.  
 
5.3  PRO CEDURES FOR ELICITING, RECORDING, AND  REPORTI NG ADVERSE 
EVENTS  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
A consistent methodology for eliciting AEs at all patient  evaluation time  points should be 
adopted. Examples of non -directive questions include:  
• “How have you felt sin ce your last clinical visit?”  
• “Have you had a ny new /changed heal th problems since you were last here?”  
Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or 
SAEs. Avoid collo quialisms and abbreviations.  
a. Diagnosis vs.  Signs and Symptoms  
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual 
signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, 
asterixis, and elevated transaminases). Howe ver, if a conste llation of signs and/or 
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page 17 of 33  symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the 
time of reporting, it is ok to report the information that is currently available. If a 
diagnosis is su bsequently established, it sh ould be reported  as follow -up information.  
b. Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period (see Section 
5.1.2), regardless of attribution, will be reported to the appropriate parties. When 
recording a death, the event or c ondition that ca used or contributed to the fatal outcome 
should be reported as the single medical concept. If the cause of death is unknown and 
cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, report “Unexplained Death”.  
c. Pree xisting Medical Conditions  
A pre-existing med ical condition is one that is present at the start of the study. Such 
conditions should be reported as medical and surgical history. A preexisting medical 
condition should be re -assessed throughout the trial and  reported as an AE or SAE onl y 
if the frequen cy, severity, or character of  the condition worsens during the study. When 
reporting such events, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting 
condition has changed by including applicable descript ors (e.g.,  “more frequent 
headaches”).  
d. Hospitalizations for Medical or Surgical Procedures  
Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be 
documented and reported as an SAE. If a patient  is hospitalized to undergo a medical  
or surgical procedure as a r esult of an AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not 
the procedure itself, should be reported as the SAE. For example, if a patient  is 
hospitalized to undergo coronary bypass surgery, record the heart condition that 
necessitated the bypass as the S AE. 
 
Hospitaliza tions for the following reasons do not require reporting:  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical 
procedures for preexisting conditions  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospi talization required to allow efficacy 
measure ment for the study or  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for scheduled therapy of the target 
disease of the study.  
e. Pregnancy  
Female  patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to i mmediately 
inform the investi gator if they be come  pregnant during the study or within 6 
months  after the last dose of OCR .  If a pregnancy occurs during this time period for a 
female patient , a report should be completed and submitted to Genentech, Inc. Fo llow-
up to obtain the outcome  of the pregnanc y should also occur , whenever  possible,  
based  upon  due diligence  taken  to obtain  the follow-up information . Abortion, whether 
accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should always be classified as serious, and 
expeditiously reported as an SAE. Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a 
child born to a female patient  exposed to the premedication s and/or OCR  should be 
reported as an SAE.  
 
Additional information on any ocrelizumab -exposed pregnancy and inf ant will be 
requested by Gene ntech/Roche Drug  Safety at specific time points (i.e. after having 
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page 18 of 33  received the initial report, at the end of the second trimester, 2 weeks after the expected 
date of delivery, and at 3, 6, and 12 months of the infant’s life).  
 
Pregnanc ies will not be repo rted to the prem edication  manufacture . 
f. Post -Study Adverse Events  
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a patient  has 
completed or discontinued study participation if attributed to prior OCR  exposure. If the 
investigator sh ould become awar e of the development of cancer or a congenital 
anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female patient  who participated in 
the study, this should be reported as an SAE.  
 
SAEs will not be reported to th e premedication  manufacture a fter the end of the 
patient’s study participation.  
 
g.       Case Transmission Verification of Single Case Reports  
The Sponsor  agrees  to conduct the Case Transmission Verification to ensure that all 
single case reports have be en adequately received by Gen entech , Inc.  via Providence 
Brain and Spine Institute emailing Genentech , Inc.  a quarterly line -listing documenting 
single case reports sent by Providence Brain and Spine Institute  to Genentech , Inc.  in 
the preceding time perio d.  
 
The periodic line -listing will be exchan ged within seven (7) calendar days of the end of 
the agreed time period. Confirmation of receipt should be received within the time 
period mutually agreed upon.  
                    
If discrepancies are identifie d, the Sponsor and Genentech , Inc. will coope rate in 
resolving the discrepancies. The responsible individuals for each party shall handle the 
matter on a case -by-case basis until satisfactory resolution.  The sponsor shall receive 
reconciliation guidance d ocuments within the ‘Activati on Package’.  
 
Following Case Transmission Verification, single case reports which have not been 
received by Genentech , Inc.  shall be forwarded by Providence Brain and Spine 
Institute  to Genentech , Inc.  within five (5) calendar days from request by Genentec h, 
Inc. 
 
At the end of the study, a final cumulative Case Transmission Verification  report will be 
sent to Genentech , Inc.  
 
Case Transmission Verification will not be completed for the premedication  
manufactures.  
 
h.  AEs of Special Interest (AESIs)  
AEs of Special Inter est are defined as a potential safety problem, identified as a result 
of safety monitoring of OCR. AESIs are not being reported for the premedication s.  
 
There are no ocrelizumab Events of Special Interest.  
 
 Adverse events of special int erest for this stu dy include the following:  
 
Protocol: PRECEPT   Providence Health & Services   
Page 19 of 33  • Cases of potential drug -induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST 
in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by 
Hy’s law:  
• Treatment -emergent ALT or AST  3  ULN in combination  with total 
bilirubin  2  ULN 
• Treatment -emergent ALT or AST > 3 x ULN in combination with clinical 
jaundice  
• Data related to a suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the 
study drug (STIAMP), as define d below:  
Any organism, viru s, or infectious p article (e.g., prion protein 
transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or 
non-pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of 
an infectious agent may be suspected from c linical symptoms or 
laborat ory findings that indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a 
medicinal product.  This term applies only when a contamination of the 
study drug is suspected . 
i. Exchange of Single Case Reports

5.7 SIGNAL MANAGEMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT  
 
Genentech is responsible for safety signal management (signal detection and/or 
evaluation) for their own Product. However, it is agreed that the Spon sor of the Study  
will be primarily responsible for assessment of the benefit -risk balance of the Study.   
If the sponsor  issues a safety communication relevant for Genentech (i.e., a sa fety 
issue that notably impacts the benefit -risk balance of the Study an d/or triggers any 
changes to the Study) this will  be sent to Roche within five (5) business days of its 
internal approval.   
As needed, Genentech will reasonably assist the sponsor  with signal and risk 
management activities related to the Product within the  Study.   
Genentech will also provide the sponsor  with any new relevant information that may 
modify or supplement known data regarding the Product (e.g., relev ant Dear 
Investigator Letter).

The Partie s shall follow their own procedures for adherence to AE reporting timelines.   
Each Party shall monitor and, as applicable, request feedbac k from the other Party 
regarding AE report timeliness in accor dance with its own procedures. The Parties 
agree to prov ide written responses in a timely manner to inquiries from the other Party 
regarding AE reports received outside the agreed upon Agreement  timelines.  
If there is any detection of trends of increasing or persistent non -compliance to 
transmission timelines stipulated in this Agreement, both Parties agree to conduct ad 
hoc or institute a regular joint meeting to address the issue.   
In case of concerns related to non -compliance of processes, other than exc hange 
timelines, with this Agreement, the Parties will jointly discuss and collaborate on 
clarifying and resolving the issues causing non -compliance. Every effort will be made by 
the non -compli ant Party to solve the non -compliance issues and inform the oth er Party 
of the corrective and preventative actions tak en.  
Upon justified request, given sufficient notice of no less than sixty (60) calendar days, 
an audit under the provisions of this Agree ment can be requested by either Party. The 
Parties will then di scuss and agree in good faith upon the audit scope, age nda and

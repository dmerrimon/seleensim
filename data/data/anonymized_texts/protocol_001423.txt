Detailed Title A Phase 1/2 randomised observer -blind placebo controlled 
study  to evaluate the safety , reactogenicity and 
immunogenicity of different dose levels of GSK Biologicals’ 
investigational unadjuvanted RSV m aternal vaccine 
(GSK3888550A) compared to placebo when administered to 
healthy  non-pregnant women aged 18- 45 years.
Indication Active immunization of pregnant women during the third 
trimester of pregnancy  to prevent respiratory  syncyt ial virus 
(RSV) associated lower respiratory  tract infection (L RTI) in 
infants by  transfer of maternal antibodies.
Rationale for the 
study and study 
designRationale fo r the stud y:
The purpose of this stud y is to evaluate the safet y, 
reactogenicity  and immunogenicity  of three dose levels 
(30µg, 60 µg and 120 µg )of the investigational RSV 
maternal vaccine antigen compared to placebo administered as 
a single intramuscula r injection .
Rationale for the stud y design :
To assess the impact of the investigational RSV m aternal 
vaccine in terms of safety, reactogenicity  and immune 
response, four treatment groups will be evaluated.
Health y, non -pregnant women aged 18 - 45 years will be 
enrolled, a population of the same gender and age of the 
vaccine’s ta rget population
Rationale for the use of placebo :
The placebo group is included as a control for both the 
safet y/reactogenicit y and the immunogenicit y assessments.
Objective(s) Primary
To evaluate the safet y and reactogenicity  of three dose 
levels (30, 60, 120 µg) of the RSV maternal 
investigational vaccine administered as a single 
intramuscular injection, as compared to placebo up to 1 
month post vaccination (Day  31).
Secon dary
To evaluate the safet y of three dose levels (30, 60, 120
µg) of the RSV maternal investigational vaccine 
compared to placebo up to 6 months post vaccination 
(Day  181).

13-AUG -2018 10As this will be the first time that the RSV maternal vaccine will 
be administered in humans, the study  will enrol subjects in two 
steps ( Step 1 will enroll 60 subjects in the United States [US] 
only and Step 2 will enroll 440 subjects across multiple 
countries ). Subjects will be randomised to all dose levels from 
the start .Both blinded and unblinded safet y monit oring will be 
performed , as described below .
The Safet y Review Team (SRT) will review blinded data on a 
regular basis throughout the study , and an internal Safety  
Review Committee (iS RC) will review unblinded data at 
specific stud y timepoints. (Refer to section[s] 8.10.1 and 8.10.2 
for more details on the safety  monitoring for this study ). 
During Step 1, until the first 30 subjects have been vaccinated, 
vaccination will be limited to 10 subjects/ per day across all 
sites. These subjects will be vaccinated sequentially and at least 
60 minutes apart. 
Subsequent vaccinations will continue without limit
ation to the 
number of subjects vaccinated per day  or time lag between 
vaccination of c onsecutive subjects. 
Screening and enrolm ent of Step 2 subjects will only  be 
initiated if the iSRC review of Day  31 data results in a 
recommendation to proceed with Step 2.
Number of subjects Approximately  500 healthy  women will be enrolle d 
(~125/group).
Endpoint(s) Primary
Occurrence of an y adverse events (AEs) from vaccination 
during a 30- day follow -up period, for all subjects in all 
groups:
Occurrence of each solicited local and general 
symptom during a 7-day follow -up period.
Occurrence of an y unsolicited AE during a 3 0-day 
follow -up period.
Occurrence of Serious AEs during a 3 0-day follow -
up 
period.
Occurrence of an y haematological (Leukocy tes,

Active Phase (of a clinical 
trial):Active phase is defined as the time period in a clinical 
trial during which all study  visits involving the main 
study  activities (e.g. vaccination or study medication/
product administration; main blood collection) take 
place; this excludes follow-up periods aimed at 
monitoring the safety  of a subject over a long period of 
time or checking long -term immunity  persistence.
Adequate contraception: Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive 
method with failure rate of less than 1% per y ear when 
used consistently  and correctl y and when applicable, in 
accordance with the product label for example:
abstinence from penile -vaginal intercourse, when 
this is their preferred and usual lifesty le,
combined 
oestrogen and progesterone oral 
contraceptives,
injectable progestog en,
implants of etonogestrel or levonorgestrel,
contraceptive vaginal ring,
percutaneous contraceptive patches,
intrauterine device or intrauterine s ystem,
current bilateral tubal ligation,
male partner sterilisation (i.e. vasectomy ) prior to the 
female su bject’s entry  into the study , and this male is 
the sole partner for that subject,
The information on the male sterility  can come from 
the site personnel’s review of the subject’s medical 
records andinterview with the subject on her 
medical history .
male c ondom and progesterone alone oral 
contraceptive.
male condom combined with a vaginal spermicide 
(foam, gel, film, cream or suppository ), and 
progesterone alone oral contraceptive.
Adequate contraception does not apply  to subjects of 
child bearing potential with same sex partners only.

13-AUG -2018 24Adverse event: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related 
to the medicinal product. 
An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any  unfavourable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product. For marketed medicinal products, this also 
includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of 
efficacy ), abuse or misuse.
Blinding: A procedure in which one or more parties to the trial are 
kept unaware of the treatment assignment in order to 
reduce the risk of biased study  outcomes. The level of 
blinding is maintained throughout the conduct of the 
trial, and only  when the data are cleaned to an acceptable 
level of quality  will appropriate personnel be unblinded 
or when required in case of a serious adverse event. I n an 
observer -blind study , the subject and the site and sponsor 
personnel involved in the clinical evaluation of the 
subjects are blinded while other stud y personnel may be 
aware of the treatment assignment (see Section 5.3for 
details on observer -blinded studies). The method of 
blinding in this study is further defined in S ection 1.5.6
.
Eligible: Qualified for enrolment into the study  based upon strict 
adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Enrolment : Enrolment is defined as the point that a subject is 
determined as eligible to participate in the stud y and has 
been randomized to a treatment group.
End of Study:
(Synonym of End of 
Trial) :For studies without collection of human biologicals 
samples or imaging data EoS is the L ast Subject Last 
Visit (L SLV). For studies with collection of Human 
Biologicals Samples or imaging data, EoS is defined as 
the date of the last testing/reading released of the Human 
Biological Samples or imaging data, related to primary  
and secondary  endpoints or LSLV, whichever comes 
later. EoS must be achieved no later than 8 months after 
LSLV.

points or a single time point from a single protocol. Self -
contained means that data collected for all subjects at all 
time points within that epoch allows to draw a complete 
conclusion to define or precise the targeted label of the 
product. Ty pical examples of epochs are screening vi sits,
primary  vaccinations, boosters, y early immunogenicity  
follow -ups, and surveillance periods for efficacy  or 
safet y.

included in the Per Protocol (PP ) anal ysis (see Sections 
6.6.2, 6.7and 10.5 for details on criteria for evaluability ).
Investigational vaccine:
(Synonym of 
Investigational Medicinal 
Product) :A pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or placebo 
being tested or u sed as a reference in a clinical trial, 
including a product with a marketing authorisation when 
used in a way  different from the approved form, or when 
used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain 
further information about an approved use. 
Internal Safety R eview 
Committee ( iSRC ):The iSRC is a group of experts (a GSK Biologicals’ 
Safety  Physician, a CRDL /CEPL and a Biostatistician) , 
external to the on- going study /project and with
lack of 
conflicts of interest in the outcome of the stud y, who 
assess the safety  data in an unblinded (on a subject level 
or treatment group level) fashion. They  may  also assess 
other parameters (e.g. immunogenicit y), if requested. 
Based on its review, the iSRC gives recommendations to 
the Clinical Project Team reg arding stud y modification, 
continuation or termination.
Menarche: Menarche is the onset of menses for the first time in a 
young female and is preceded by  several changes 
associated with pubert y including breast development 
and pubic hair growth. Menarche usuall y occurs within 
1-2 years of breast development, thelarche. However, a 
young female can become pregnant before her first 
menses. Thus, a conservative definition of non-
childbearing potential in a pre- menarcheal female is a 
young female who has not y et entered pubert y as 
evidenced b y lack of breast development (palpable 
glandular breast tissue).

13-AUG -2018 291. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background
RSV is a negative -strand, ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus of which two antigenically  
distinct subgroups exist, referred to as RSV -A and RSV -B. RSV is a highl y contagious 
human pathogen that causes respiratory  tract infections in people of all ages. I n tempera te 
climates throughout the world, RSV predictabl y causes fall -winter epidemics whereas 
viral activity  is more endemic in tropical regions and outbreaks are less seasonally
focused.
The virus causes respiratory  tract infections at all ages, but y oung infant s below 1 y ear of 
age have the highest incidence of severe disease (b ronchiolitis, pneumonia), peaking at 1 -
3 months of age [Hall, 2013] and with a continuing burden of disease through the second 
year of life [ EMA /CHMP , 2017]. Sev
ere disease often leads to hospitalisation and may
be life threatening. The majority  ofchildren become infected with RSV within 2 y ears of 
birth [Hall2001; Nyiro
,2017 ; Kutsay a, 2016 ].The impact continues into later life, 
specificall y, episodes of wheezing and asthma during the first decade of life are more 
common in children who were hospitalized for RSV bronchioli tis during infancy  than 
those who were not hospitalized [Wu, 2011].
The risk for severe RSV -induced lower respiratory tract infection is highest in infants 
below 6 months of age a nd it is the most common cause of hospitalisation in this age 
group. About 45% of the estimated 3.2 million hospital admissions for RSV –associated 
acute lower respiratory  tract infections that occurred globally  in 2015, occurred in infants 
younger than 6 months of age . Additionall y, it was estimated globall y that hospital deaths 
due to RSV -associated lower respiratory  infection were approximately  59,600 in children 
younger than 5 y ears and 27, 300 in children < 6 months of age [Shi, 2017].
Approximately  2% of children < 1 y ear of age are hospitalized for RSV -associated lower 
respiratory  tract infections each year in industrialized countries [Blais , 2017; Boyce, 
2000; Deshpande , 2003; Hall, 2009; Holman, 2004; Iwane, 2004; Madhi , 200 6; Nair, 
2010; Paramore , 2004; Vicente ,2003; Shi,2017; Stein , 2017
].
Previous infection with RSV does not prevent subsequent infections. Re -infection with 
RSV occurs throughout an individual’s lifetime [Simoes , 1999; Kapikian, 1969; 
Krilov, 
2011]. These re -infections generall y go undiagnosed because they  usuall y present as 
common acute upper respiratory  tract infections. In more vulnerable populations ( e.g.,
immunocompromised individuals or older adults), re -infections can also lead to severe 
disease and result in  mortality  [Graham , 2011].
1.2. Current Management of RSV Disease in Infants
To date, no 
licensed vaccine is available for RSV and treatment for RSV disease is 
limited to supportive care .Palivizumab (Synagis , 
MedI mmune), an RSV
specific -recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody , is indicated for the prevention of 
severe LRT I requiring hospitalisation caused by RSV in children at high risk for RSV 
disease, such as infants who were born prematurely  or with bronc hopulmonary  dysplasia ,

effective as proph ylaxis and is not indicated or recommended in the general, health y
infant population , due to high cost and the need for monthly  administration throughout 
the RSV season [ Buck , 2004].
1.3. Maternal Immunization
Maternal immunization, and the protective effect of maternall y transferred antibodie s was 
initially  demonstrated with the small pox vaccination in 1879 [Rasmussen, 2014]. 
Effective immune responses to vaccines and transmission of spe cific antibodies to infants 
through the placenta are observed when pregnant women are vaccinated [Vojtek, 2018]
. 
Currently , the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends the 
inactivated influenza and Tdap (tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular 
pertussis) vaccines for pregnant women [CDC , 2017]. 
In a study  evaluating maternal vaccination with influenza, there was a 63% reduction in 
laboratory  proven influenza illness in infants up to 6 months of age and 29 %and 36% 
reductions in rates of respiratory  illness with fever in infants and mothers, re spectivel y 
[Zaman , 2008]. Additionally , in a retrospective cohort study , it was concluded that 
infants with pertussis whose mothers received Tdap during pregna ncy had a significantly  
lower risk of hospitalization and intensive care unit admission and shorter hospital stay s 
[Winter ,
2017]. Following maternal tetanus toxoid vaccination, neonatal tetanus mortality  
has been reduced b y 92% in combination with improved h ygienic birthing practices 
[Healy ,
2012]. 
Based on the results seen with previous maternal vaccines, vaccinating mothers with an 
RSV vaccine could reduce RSV
-associated morbidity  and mortalit yin infants less than 6 
months of age . 
It was shown that most of the RSV neutralizing acti vity present in serum from previously  
infected individuals is directed to the pre -fusion conformation of RSV F protein 
[Ngwuta , 2015]
. In addition, antibodies specific for the RSV F pre- fusion conformation 
are typicall y more potent than those which are common to both the post -and pre -fusion 
forms [ Kwakkenbos ,2010 ]
.
Administration of an RSV vaccine to adults (pregnant women in this case), all of whom 
can be assumed to have been naturally  infected with RSV before, is expected to boost the 
immunological memory  induced by  previous na tural infections [ Anderson , 2013 ].High 
titers of maternall y derived RSV -neutralizing antibodies have been shown to be 
associated with subsequent sero logic protection against RSV infection and lower 
incidence of RSV -associated acute lower respiratory  tract infection during the first 6 
months of life [ Roca ,2002; Stensballe ,2009; Chu, 2014].
Enhanced respiratory  disease (ERD) was seen in clinical trials of a formalin- inactivated 
whole virus RSV vaccine (FI- RSV) in seronegative children. Among seronegative 
children in th osetrials, the FI -RSV vacc ine did not protect against RSV disease and more 
importantly  led to more severe clinical s ymptoms upon subsequent natural infection of 
RSV [ Chin ,1969; Kapikian ,1969; Kim,1969]. I n contrast, clinical data demonstrate a

exposure and the lack of ERD in the seropositive children who participated in the FI -RSV 
studies [ Roberts , 2016].  With the transfer of vaccine- induced neutralizing antibodies 
from the mother to the infant, the risk of ERD in the infants is considered negligible. In 
support of this hy pothesis, ERD has not been observed with the use of Synagis , nor with 
the transfer of serum from FI -RSV vaccinated animals to recipient animals [ Kwon ,
2014].
1.4. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals’ Investigational RSV 
maternal v accine
The RSV maternal v accine is composed of the l yophilized RSVPreF3 antigen (Refer to 
the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) Dossier and Section 3.2.S.1.2 of the 
Investigational New Drug (IND
). The vaccine is being developed for prevention of RSV 
LRTI disease in infants by transfer of maternal antibodies. 
Refer to the Investigator Brochure (IB)for more informa tion on the RSV maternal 
vaccine
1.5. Rationale for the study  and study  design
1.5.1. Rationale for the study
GSK is developing a new investigational RSV maternal vaccine against RSV disease in 
infants through a maternal immunization program.
The purpose of this stud y is to evaluate the safet y, reactogenicity and immunogenicity  of 
three dose levels ( 30 µg, 60 µg and 120 µg )of the investigational RSV maternal vaccine 
antigen compared to placebo administered as a single intramuscular injection.
1.5.2. Rationale for the study  design
To assess the impact of the investigational RSV m aternal vaccine in terms of safet y, 
reactogenicity  and immune response, four treatment groups will be evaluated:
Group Name (Product):
RSV MAT 30 (RSVPreF3 30µg)
RSV MAT 60 (RSVPreF3 60µg)
RSV MAT 120 (RSVPreF3 120µg)
Control ( Saline Placebo )
Health y, non -pregnant women aged 18 - 45 years will be enrolled in this study , a 
population of the same gender and age of the vaccine’s ta rget population .

13-AUG -2018 321.5.3. Rationale for dose selection
GSK previously  evaluated a different candidate RSV m aternal vaccine at dose levels of 
30, 60, and 120 µg ina similar population, non- pregnant women 18- 45 years of age. 
Building on this experience, the RSV MAT- 001 study  will evaluate 3 dose levels (30, 60 
or 120 µg) of the new inves tigational unadjuvanted RSV maternal vaccine administered 
intramuscularl y as a single dose. Clinical experience with the previousl y evaluated 
vaccine candidate indicated that unadjuvanted formulations induced Nab levels similar to 
those of alum -adjuvanted formulations in adults [ Langley , 2017; Beran , 2018 ]. Therefore, 
only unadjuvanted formulations will be used in RSV MAT-001.
The highest propo sed dose level (120 µg) for RSV MAT
-001 was well tolerated when 
given alone, 3 times at 2 -week intervals, in a GL P toxicology  study . Additionally , 
previous pharmacology  studies of the RSVPreF3 antigen conducted in a bovine model 
demonstrated that the molecule is able to boost Nab titres. Refer to the Investigator 
Brochure for a summary  of the nonclinical studies. 
This is a single -dose study  so the maximum dose to be administered will be the dose to 
which the subject is randomised. 
1.5.4. Rationale for the use of placebo
The placebo group is included as a control for both the safet y/reactogenicity  and the 
immunogenicit y assessments.
1.5.5. Safety  considerations
As this will be the first time that the GSK investigational RSV maternal vaccine will be
administered in humans, the study  will enrol subjects in 2 steps with randomisation to all 
dose levels (30, 60 and 120 µg) from the start ,(See Figure 1). Step 1 (~ 60 subjects) will 
be conducted at sites in the United States only and additional countries will be added in 
Step 2 .
During Step 1, until the first 30 subjects have been vaccinated, vaccination will be limited 
to 10 subjects per day across sites. These subjects will be vaccinated sequentially  and at 
least 60 minutes apart across all sites. During the remainder of Step 1 and in Step 2, 
vaccination will continue without limita tions to the number of subjects vaccinated per 
day or time lag between vaccination of consecutive subjects.
Refer to 
Sections 5.6.13 and 5.6.14 for more information on vaccine administration and 
subject monitoring .
Refer to Section 8.10.1 and 8.10.2 for more information on the S afety  Review Team

1.5.6. Study blinding
Given the different presentation of the placebo and the investigational RSV vaccine , a 
double -blinded study  design is not possible. This study  will be conducted in an observer -
blind manner up to Day  9
1, after which it will be conducted in a single -blind manner .
Observer -blind, means that during the course of the study , the vaccine recipient , those 
responsible for the evaluation of an y study endpoint (e.g. safety and reactogenicity ), and 
the sponsor will all be unaware of which vaccine was administered. To do so, vaccine 
preparation and administration will be done b y authori sed medical personnel who will not 
participate in an y of the study  clinical evaluation assay s.
Single -blind, means that GSK sta tistician and data management staff will be unblinded 
(i.e. will have access to the individual subject treatment assignments), but individual 
listings will not be provided until the study  report at the completion of the study .In 
addition, site staff invol ved in the clinical evaluation of study participants will not be 
aware of individual treatment assignments until the study report.
Please refer to Section 5.3for further details regarding the methods of blinding used in 
this study .

Risks, Contraindications and 
WarningsData/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy
All Study Vaccines
Hypersensitivity including 
allergic reaction ssuch as 
anaphylaxisAcute allergic reactions ,such as an 
anaphylactic event ,may occur with 
any vaccine administration. These are 
serious, but rare occurrences,
estimated in the range of 1 to 10 
cases per million of vaccinations, 
depending on the vaccine studied 
[Ruegge berg, 2007].The onset of vaccine -related 
allergic symptoms is typically 
quite prompt. In order to treat 
subjects with a serious allergic 
reaction to vaccination, all 
subjects will need to remai n 
under observation ( i.e.visibly 
followed; no specific 
procedure) at the vaccination 
centre for at least 60minutes 
after vaccination with 
appropriate medical treatment 
readily available, in case 
needed .
Syncope Syncope (fainting) can occur following 
or even before any vaccination as a 
psychogenic or vasovagal response to 
the needle injection. All subjects will remain under 
observation at the vaccination 
centre for at least 60minutes 
after vaccination.
Intramuscular Injection site 
reactionIntramuscular vaccination commonly 
precipitates a transient and self -
limiting local inflammatory reaction. 
This may typically include pain at 
injection site, redness, and swelling .Solicited local AEs will be 
collected and reviewed up to 7 
days post -vaccination
RSV maternal vaccine
Due to the lack of experience in 
human subjects to date, there 
is currently not enough 
information available to identify 
the risks of adverse events 
(AE) related to administration 
of the RSV m aternal vaccineAny untoward symptoms 
experienced by the subject 
after receiving the vaccine 
should be reported to the 
investigator . Ongoing safety
monitoring will be performed in 
a blinded fashion by the Safety 
Review Team, and unblinded 
review will be performed by the 
internal Safety Review 
Committee (independent from 
the RSV program). Established 
holding rules will be applied.
In step 1, for the first 30 
subjects there will be a
minimum interval of 60 minute s
between vaccination sand 
vaccination will be limited to 10 
subjects per day across all 
sites.
In addition to the above, all 
subjects will remain under 
observation at the vaccination 
centre for at least 60 minutes

1.6.2. Benefit A ssessment
Benefits linked to the investigational RSV m aternal vaccine
RSV infections in healthy adults generall y go undiagnosed because they  usually  present 
asmild acute upper respiratory  tract infections. Moreover, vaccine efficacy has not been 
assessed yet and it is not known whether the investigational RSV maternal vacci ne is
effective in protecting against RSV infection in infants.
As the proposed indication of the vaccine is to prevent RSV -associated lower respiratory  
tract illness (L RTI) in infants by  transfer of maternal antibodies, the subjects in RSV 
MAT- 001 (health y, non -pregnant women) receiving the investigational RSV maternal
vaccine are not expected to directly  benefit from this vaccination .
1.6.3. Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion
This is a FTiH study  evaluating aninvestigational RSV maternal vaccine. The 
investigatio nal RSV m aternal vaccine is currentl y in an earl y stage of clinical 
development and although no vaccine efficacy  has been demonstrated, the vaccine has 
been shown to boost Nab to both RSV seroty pe A and RSV seroty pe B in animal models
(refer to the IB).

5. CONDUCT OF THE STUDY
5.1. Regulatory  and ethical considerations, including the 
informed consent process
The study  will be conducted in accordance with all applicable regulatory  requirements.
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the I CH Guideline for Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP), all applicable subject privacy  requirements and the guiding principles of 
the Declaration of Helsinki.
GSK will obtain favourable opinion/approval to conduct the study  from the appropriate 
regulatory  agency , in accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements, prior to a site 
initiating the study  in that country .
Conduct of the study  includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (I EC) review and 
favourable opinion/approval of study  protocol and any  subsequent amendments.
Subject informed consent .
Investigator reporting requirements as stated in the protocol.
GSK will provide full details of the a bove procedures to the investigator, either verbally , 
in writing, or both.
Freely  given and written or witnessed/ thumb printed informed consent must be obtained 
from each subject as appropriate, prior to participation in the study .
GSK will prepare a mode l Informed Consent Form (ICF) which will embody  the ICH 
GCP and GSK required elements. While it is strongl
y recommended that this model I CF 
is to be followed as closely  as possible, the informed consent requirements given in this 
document are not intended to pre -empt an y local regulations which require additional 
information to be disclosed for informed consent to be legall y effective. Clinical 
judgement, local regulations and requirements should guide the final structure and 
content of the local version of the ICF.
The investigator has the final responsibility for the final presentation of the ICF, 
respecting the mandatory requirements of local regulations. The ICF generated b y the 
investigator with the assistance of the sponsor’s representative must be acc eptable to

5.2. Subject identification and randomisation
5.2.1. Subject identification
Subject identification numbers will be assigned sequentially  to the subjects who have 
consented to participate in the study, according to the range of subject identification 
numbers allocated to each study  centre .
In order to allow for proper control of recruitment as per the Step 1 and Step 2 
recruitment targets, consented subjects w ill be registered in the SBIR application . 
5.2.2. Randomisation of treatment
5.2.2.1. Randomisation of supplies
The randomisation of supplies within blocks will be performed at G SK, using MATerial 
EXcellence ( MATEX), a program developed for use in Statistical Analy sis System 
(SAS®) (Cary , NC, USA) by  GSK. Entire blocks will be shipped to the study  centres/ 
warehouse(s).
To allow GSK to take advantage of greater rates of recruitment than anticipated at 
individual centres in this multi -centre study  and to thus reduce the overall study  
recruitment period, an over- randomisation of supplies will be pr epared.
5.2.2.2. Treatment allocation to the subject
The treatment numbers will be allocated b y dose.
5.2.2.2.1. Study group and treatment number allocation
The target will be to enrol approximately  500 eligible subjects who will be randomly  
assigned to four stud y groups in a (1: 1: 1: 1) ratio ( ~125 subjects in each group).
Allocation of each subject to a study  group at the investigator site will be performed
using SBIR . The randomisation algorithm will use a minimisation procedure accounting 
for age (18 - 32 years or 33 
-45 years) and centre. Minimisation factors will have equal 
weight in the minimisation algorithm.
At Visit 1, after having fully  checked the eligibility  of the subject, the site staff in charge 
of the vaccine administration will access SBIR. Upon selecting the subject identification 
number previousl y entered in the application ,the randomisation sy stem will determine 
the study  group and will provide the treatment number to be used for vaccination .

Administration scree n.
When SBI R is not availabl e, please refer to the SBIR user guide or the Study Procedures 
Manual (SPM) for specific instructions .
5.3. Method of blinding
Given the different presentation of the placebo and t he investigational RSV vaccines, a 
double -blinded study  design is not possible . Refer to Section 1.5.6 for more information 
on study  blinding.
Data w ill be collected in an observer–
blinded manner up to Day  91(Visit 5) . During this 
time, vaccin e recipients and those responsible for the evaluation of any  study  endpoints 
will be unaware of which vaccine was administered. To achieve this, vaccine preparation 
and administration will be done b y authorised medical personnel who will not participate 
inany of the study  clinical evaluations . Additionally , vaccine recipients will receive the 
same volume (0.5 mL) of the study  product on Day  1. 
Analy ses for the iSRC review will be performed by an independent statistician to ensure 
that the study  team remai ns blinded to individual subject listings. Refer to Section 10.11
for more information on anal yses. 
The laboratory  in charge of the laboratory testing will be blinded to the treatment, and 
codes will be used to link the subject and stud y (without any link to the treatment 
attributed to the subject) to each sample.
5.4. General study  aspects
Supplementary  study  conduct information not mandated to be present in this pr otocol is 
provided in the accompany ing SPM. The SPM provides the investigator and the site 
personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does not impact the 
safet y of the subjects.

year or y ear onl y, as per local regulations), race and ethnicity as well as information on 
subject’s childbearing potential (if subject is not of childbearing potential, the specific 
reason should be documented: hy sterectom y, ovariectomy, post -menopause , pre-
menarche or other) in the subject’s eCRF.
5.6.6. Medical history
Obta in the subject’s medical history  by interview and/or review of the subject’s medical 
records and record an y pre-existing conditions or signs and/or s ymptoms present in the 
subject prior to the study  vaccination (Visit 1) in the eCRF.
5.6.7. Physical examination
During the Screening Visit , Visit 1 and Visit 2, perform a ph ysical examination of the 
subject, including assessment of resting vital signs: sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
heart rate, respiratory  rate and temperature, after at least 10 minutes of re st.In addition, at 
Screening onl y, collect height, weight and BMI. Collected information needs to be 
recorded in the eCRF.
At subsequent study  visits, perform a ph ysical examination only  if the subject indicates 
during questioning that there might be some underly ing pathology (ies) or if deemed 
necessary .
Treatment of an y abnormality observed during physical examination has to be performed 
according to local medical practice outside this study  or by referral to an appropriate 
health care provider.
5.6.8. Pregnancy test
Female subjects of childbeari ng potential are to have a pregnancy  test during the
Screening Visit and Visit 1 (prior to study vaccine administration ).The study  vaccines 
may only be administered if the pregnancy  test is negative. 
Urine pregnancy  test is sufficient to determine the eligibility  to enter the study , however,
serum pregnancy test (instead of urine test) may  be performed if required by  country , 
local or ethics committee regulations.
Note: The pregnancy  test must be performed even if the subject is menstruating at the 
time of the study  visit .
5.6.9. Check contraindications, warnings and precautions to

If meeting the allowed interval between Screening and Visit 1 in such cases is not 
possible, subject may  be re -screened at a later date (per investigator’s discretion) .
5.6.11. Study group and treatment number allocation
Study  group and treatment number alloca tion will be performed as described in Section
5.2.2. 
The number of the administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF .
5.6.12. Blood sampling for safety  or immune response assessments
A volume of ~ 5.5mLof whole blood should be drawn from all subjects for anal ysis of 
the haematology /biochemistry  parameters at Screening ,Visit 2,Visit 3and Unscheduled 
Visits (if any )
. In the event any  re-test is needed; as per inv
estigator discretion, (e.g. 
laboratory  abnormalities) the volume required will also be ~5.5mL . Haematology  and 
biochemistry assessments will be performed in the investigator’s laboratory  as per local 
practice (see Table 8 and Table 9).
Avolume of ~ 30mL of whole blood should be drawn from all subjects at Screening , 
Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4 and Visit 5 for anal ysis of humoral immune responses (see Table 
7and Table 10)
.
Refer to the SPM for de tails on blood sample handling .
5.6.13. Study Vaccine administration
After completing all prerequisite procedures prior to vaccination, administer one dose of 
study  vaccine intramuscularly  in the deltoid of the non-dominant arm. In case of 
anatomical features, medical indication or skin colouration ( e.g.tattoos) preventing 
vaccination in the non -dominant arm, the vaccine may  be administered in thedominant 
arm. Refer to Section 6.3for information on the dosage and administration of the 
vaccine. 
If the investigator or delegate determines that the subject’s health on the day  of 
administration temporarily precludes vaccine s administration, the vaccination visit will 
be rescheduled within the allowed interval (refer to Table 5).
Vaccination in Step 1 will be limited to 10 subjects a day for the first 30 subjects. These 
subjects should be vaccinated sequentiall y and at least 60 minute sapart.

It is likel y that the RSV antibodies elicited by the vaccine may wane during the period 
between pregnancies, therefore there may be a need to administer the vaccine during each 
pregnancy to achieve optimal anti-RSV antibody  levels in the neonate. In order to assess 
whether a booster dose might induce a higher reactogenicity  or immune -tolerance, 
subjects who par ticipated in the study  RSV MAT-001 study  
may be invited to participate 
in a booster study .
The investigator will ask each subject , at the time of informed consent, if she is interested 
in participating in a booster study  and will document this in the source documents only . 
Atstudy  conclusion ( Day 181 contact), the investigator will confirm subject’s interest 
and report it in the eCRF. 
If a subject is not interested in participating in the booster study , the reason for refusal 
will also be documented in the subject’s eCRF. Refusal to participate in the extension 
study  will not prevent subjects from enrolling in the RSV MAT- 001 study . 
5.6.19. Day 181 Contact
Contact should be preferably
 performed via telephone, or alternativel y, if phone contact 
is not possible, through email/other m eans where the information can be fully  collected.
When the contact isnot done by  telephone , if questions remain, the study  site may  
follow -up with the subject via telephone.
During thiscontact, the investigator (or delegate) will ask the subject if she has 
experienced an y serious adverse events and/or any  AEs leading to study  with drawal since 
Visit 5and/ or whether she has become pregnant . The investigator (or delegate) will also 
ask the subject for concomitant vaccinations/products/medications that she has received 
since Visit 5. 
Subject’s interest in participating in a booster study will also b e re-confirmed at Day 181
contact, and the corresponding information will be reporte d in the eCRF (refer to Section 
5.6.18).
Please refer to the SPM for further guidance.

Samples will not be labelled with information that directly  identifies the subject but will 
be coded with the identification number for the subject (su bject number).
Collected samples will be used for protocol mandated research and purposes related 
to the improvement, develop ment and quality  assurance of the laboratory  tests 
described in this protocol. This may include the management of the quality  of th ese 
tests, the maintenance or improvement of these tests, the development of new test 
methods, as well as making sure that new tests are comparable to previous methods 
and work reliably .
It is also possible that future findings may  make it desirable to use the samples 
acquired in this study  for future research, not described in this protocol. Therefore, 
all subjects in countries where this is allowed will be asked to give a specific consent 
to allow GSK or a contracted partner to use the samples for future research. Future 
research will be subject to the laws and regulations in the respective countries and 
will only  be performed once an independent Ethics Committee or Review Board has

The subject may  be vaccinated at a later date, within the time window specif ied in the 
protocol (See Table 5) or the subject may  be re-screened or withdrawn at the discretion of 
the investigator :
Acute disease and/or fe ver at the time of vaccination.
Fever is defined as temperature 38.0°C / 100.4°F by any route . The preferred 
route for recording temperature in this study  will be oral.
Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory  
infection) without fever can be administered the study vaccine.
6.6. Concomitant medication s/product sand concomitant 
vacci nation s
At each stud y visit /contact , the investigator should question the subject about any  
medications/products taken and vaccinations received.
6.6.1. Recording of concomitant medications/products and 
concomitant vaccination s
The following concomitant medication(s)/product(s)/vaccine(s) must be recorded in 
the eCRF.
All concomitant medications/ vaccinations/ products, except vitamins and dietary  
supplements, administered as of study  vaccination and up to 29days after 
vaccination (Day  1 to Day  
30).
Prophy lactic medication (i.e. medication administered in the absence of ANY 
symptom and in anticipation of a reaction to the vaccination).
E.g. an anti -pyretic is considered to be prophy lactic when it is given in the absence 
of fever and an y other s ymptom, to prevent fever from occurring (Fever is defined as 
temperature 38.0°C/100.4°F regardless the location of measurement)

(i.e. more than 14 day s in total) or any  long -acting immune -modify ing drugs (e.g. 
infliximab) administered any  time up to 90 day s post- vaccination. For 
corticosteroids, this will mean ≥5mg/day prednisone orequivalent. Inhaled and 
topical steroids are allowed.
 A vaccine not foreseen by the stud y protocol administered during 30 days following 
vaccination*, with the exception of seasonal influenza vaccine which may  be 
administered 15 day s after the dose of study  vaccine.
*In case an emergency  mass vaccination for an unforeseen public health threat (e.g. a 
pandemic) is organised by  the public health authorities, outside the routine 
immunisation program, the time period described above can be reduced if necessary  
for that vaccine provided it is licensed and used according to its Summary  of 
Products Characteristics /Prescribing Information and according to the local 
governmental recommendations and provided a written approval of the Spo nsor is 
obtained.
Immunoglobulins and/or any  blood products administered up to 90 day s post-
vaccination.
6.7. Intercurrent medical conditions that may  lead to elimination 
of a subject from Per Protocol analy ses
At each stud y visit subsequent to 
vaccination and up to study  end it must be verified if 
the subject has experienced or is experiencing an y intercurrent medical condition. I f it is 
the case, the condition(s) must be recorded in the eCRF.
Subject s may  be eliminated from the Per Protocol Set (PPS) for immunogenicity  if, 
during the stud yperiod up to Day  91 (Visit 5) , they  incur a condition that has the 
capability  of altering their immune response or if they  are diagnosed with an

The investig ator or site staff is/are responsible for the detection, documentation and 
reporting of events meeting the criteria and definition of an adverse event (AE) or serious 
adverse event (SAE) as provided in this protocol. 
Each subject will be instructed to contact the investigator immediatel y should they/the 
subject manifest an y signs or sy mptoms they  perceive as serious.
8.1. Safet y definitions
8.1.1. Definition of an adverse event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporall y 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) tempo rally associated with 
the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse.
Examples of an AE include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational vaccine administration 
even though they  may  have been present prior to the start of the study .
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational vaccine or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be 
reported as an AE/SAE).
Signs, s ymptoms temporally  associated with vaccine(s) administration.
Significant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action. 
Pre-or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol- mandated procedures 
(i.e.invasive procedures, modificatio n of subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).
AEs to be recorded as endpoints (solicited AEs) are described in Section 8.1.3 . All other 
AEs will be reco rded as UNSOLI CITED AEs.

13-AUG -2018 62Examples of an AE DO NOT include:
Medical or surgical procedures ( e.g.endoscop y, appendectom y); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE/SAE.
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur ( e.g.social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital, admission for routine examination).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or s ymptoms present in a subject prior to the 
study  vaccination. These events will be record ed in the medi cal history  section of the 
eCRF.
8.1.2. Definition of a serious adverse event 
A SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that:
a.Results in death,
b.Is life -threatening,
Note: The term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetically  might have caused death, had it been more severe.
c.Requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation,
Note: I n general , hospitalisation signifies that the subject has been admitted at the 
hospital or emergency  ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or in an out -patient setting. Complications 
that occur during h ospitalisation are also considered AEs. If a complication prolongs 
hospitalisation or fulfils any  other serious criteria, the event will also be considered 
serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘hospitalisation’ occurred or was necessary , the 
AE should be c onsidered serious.
Hospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is 
NOT considered an AE.
d.Results in disability /incapacity , OR
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, inf luenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained 
ankle) which may  interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect in the offspring of a study  subject.
Medical or sci entific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may  jeopardise the 
subject or ma y require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other

Note: Temperature will be recorded in the evening. Should additional temperature 
measurements be performed at other times of day, the highest temperature will be 
recorded in the diary  card and eCRF .
8.1.4. Clinical laboratory  parameters and other abnormal assessments 
qualify ing as adverse events or serious adverse events
In absence of diagnosis, abnormal laboratory  findings (e.g. clinical c hemistry , 
haematology )or other abnormal assessments that are judged by  the investigator to be 
clinically  significant will be recorded as an AE or SAE if they  meet the definition of an 
AE or SAE (refer to Sections 8.1.1 and 8.1.2
). All Grade  3* abnormal laboratory  
findings should be reported as AE/SAE. Abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal 
assessments that are present at baseline and significant ly worsen following the start of the 
study  will also be reported as AEs or SAEs. If a diagnosis is associated with the abnormal 
findings, the diagnosis should be reported as AE/SAE.
The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgement in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically  
significant.

8.2. Events or outcomes not qualify ing as adverse events or 
serious adverse events (pregnancy )
Female subjects who become pregnant after the vaccination may  continue the study  at the
discretion of t he investigator, but will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy . 
While pregnancy  itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any  adverse pregnancy  outcome 
or complication or elective termination of a pregnancy  for medical reasons will be 
record ed and reported as an AE or a SAE.
Note: The pregnancy  itself should alway s be recorded on an electronic pregnancy  report.
The following should alway s be considered as SAE and will be reported as described in 
Sections 8.4.1 and8.4.3:
Spontaneous pregnancy  loss, including:
spontaneous abortion, (spontaneous pregnancy  loss bef ore/at 22 weeks of 
gestation)
ectopic and molar pregnancy
stillbirth (intrauterine death of foetus after 22 weeks of gestation).
Note: the 22 weeks cut -off in gestational age is based on WHO -ICD 10 noted in the 
EMA Guideline on pregnancy  exposure [ EMA , 2017]. It is recogniz ed that national 
regulations might be different.
Any early neonatal death (i.e. death of a live born infant occurring within the first 7 
days of life). 
Any congenital anomal y or birth defect (as per [ CDC MACDP ]guidelines) 
identified in the offspring of a study  subject (either during pregnancy , at birth or 
later) regardless of whe ther the foetus is delivered dead or alive. This includes 
anomalies identified by prenatal ultrasound, amniocentesis or examination of the 
products of conception after elective or spontaneous abortion.
Furthermore, an y SAE occurring as a result of a post -
study pregnancy  AND considered 
by the investigator to be reasonabl y related to the investigational vaccines will be 
reported to GSK as described in Section 8.4.3. Wh ile the investigator is not obligated to 
activel y seek this information from former stud y participants, he/she may learn of a 
pregnancy  through spontaneous reporting.

All AEs starting within 30 day s following administration of the study  vaccine (Day  1to 
Day 30) must be recorded into the appropriate section of the eCRF, irrespective of 
intensity  or whether or not they  are considered vaccination-related.
The time period for collecting and recording SAEs will begin at the receipt of the 
study  
vaccine and will end at the contact at Day  181. See Section 8.4 for instructions on 
reporting of SAEs.
All AEs/SAEs leading to withdrawal from the study  will be collected and recorded from 
the time of the receipt of the study  vaccine .
In addition to the above -
mentioned reporting requirements and in order to fulfil 
international reporting obligations, SAEs that are related to study  participation (i.e. 
protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, a change from existing therapy ) or are 
related to a concurre nt GSK medication/vaccine will be collected and recorded from the 
time the subject consents to participate in the study until sheis discharged from the study .
The time period for collecting and recording pregnancies will begin at the receipt of the 
study  vaccine and will end at the contact at Day  181. See section 
8.4for instructions on 
reporting of pregnancies.
An overview of the protocol -required reporting period s for AEs, SAEs, and pregnancies 
is given in Table 15
.

A post -study AE/SAE is defined as any  event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE 
reporting period defined in Table 15. Investigators are not obligated to actively  seek AEs 
or SAEs i n former stud y participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE at 
any time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the 
event reasonabl y related to the investigational vaccines, the investigator will promptly  
notify  the Study  Contact for Reporting SAEs.

8.3.3.1. Activequestioning to detect adverse events and serious adverse 
events
As a consistent method of collecting AEs, the subject should be asked a non -leading 
question such as: ‘Have you felt different in any way since receiving the vaccine(s )or 
since the previous visit? ’
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory  and diagnostics reports) relatedto 
the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE 
in the eCRF. T he investigator is not allowed to send photocopies of the subject’s medical 
records to GSK instead of appropriately completing the eCRF . However, there may  be 
instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b yGSK. I n this 
instance, all subject identifiers will be blinded on the copies of the medical records prior 
to submission to GSK.
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on 
signs, s ymptoms, and/or other clinical information. I n such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms.

Protoco l Final Version 2
13-AUG -2018 69The intensity  should be assigned to one of the following categories:
1 (mild) =An AE which is easil y tolerated b y the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities.
2 (moderate) =An AE which is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with 
normal every day activities.
3 (severe) =An AE which preven ts normal, every day activities. Such an AE 
would, for example, prevent attendance at work/school and would 
necessitate the administra tion of corrective therapy .
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 
3 is a category  used for rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ w hen it meets one of the pre -
defined outcomes as described in Section 8.1.2.
8.3.3.2.2. Assessment of causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the rel ationship between investigational vaccines 
and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgement to 
determine the relationship. Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history  of the 
underly ing diseases, concomitant therapy ,other risk factors, and the temporal 
relationship of the event to the investigational vaccines will be considered and 
investigated. The inv estigator will also consult the IB to determine his/her assessment.
There may  be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very  important that the 
investigator always makes an assessment of causality  for every  event prior to submission 
of the Expedited Adverse Events Report to GSK. The investigator may change his/her 
opinion of causality
 in light of follow -up information and update the SAE information 
accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining 
regulatory  reporting requirements.
In case of concomitant administration of multiple vaccines , it may  not be possible to 
determine the causal relationship of general AEs to the individual vaccine administered. 
The investigator should, therefore, assess whether the AE could be causall y related to 
vacci nation rather than to the individual vaccines .
All solicited local (injection site) reactions will be considered causall y related to 
vaccination. Causality of all other AEs should be assessed by the investigator using the 
following question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused 
by the investigational vaccine?
YES :There is a reasonable possibility  that the study  vaccination contributed to the 
AE.
NO
: There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally  related to study  
vaccination. There are other, more likel y causes and study vaccination is not 
suspected to have contributed to the AE.

8.5.1. Follow -up during the study
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
subject and provide additional relevant information on the subject’s condition to GSK 
(within 24 hours for SAEs; refer to Table 17).
All AEs/SAEs documented at a previous visit and designated as either on-going ,not 
recovered/not resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits until 
the end of the study .
8.5.2. Follow -up after the subject is discharged from the study
The investigator wi ll follow subjects with SAEs, or subjects withdrawn from the study  as 
a result of an AE, until the event has resolved, subsided, stabilised, disappeared, or until 
the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
If the investigator receives additional relevant information on a previousl y reported SAE, 
he/she will provide this information to GSK using a paper/ electronic Expedited Adverse 
Events Report and/or pregnancy  report as applicable.
GSK may  request that the investigator performs or arranges the conduct of additional 
clinical examinations/tests and/or evaluations to elucidate as full y as possible the nature 
and/or causality  of the AE or SAE. The in vestigator is obliged to assist. If a subject dies 
during participation in the study  or during a recognised follow -up period, GSK will be 
provided with an y available post -mortem findings, including histopathology.
8.5.3. Follow -up of pregnancies
Pregnant subjects will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . At the end 
of the pregnancy , whether full -term or premature, information on the status of the mother 
and child will be forwarded to GSK using the electronic pregnancy  report and the 
Expedited Adv
erse Events Report if applicable. Generall y, the follow -up period does not
need to be longer than six to eight weeks after the estimated date of delivery.
Regardless of the reporting period for SAEs for this study, if the pregnancy outcome is a 
SAE, it should alway s be reported as aSAE.
8.6. Treatment of adverse events
Treatment of an y AE is at the sole discretion of the investigator and according to current 
good medical practice. Any  medication administered for the treatment of an AE should 
be recorded in the subject’s eCRF (refer to Section 6.6)

GSK’s policy (which incorporates ICH E2A guidance, EU Clinical Trial Directive and 
US Federal Regulations) is to unblind the report of any SAE which is unexpected and attributable/suspected to be attributable to the investigational vaccines, prior to regulatory reporting. The GSK’s Central Safety Physician is responsible for unblinding the treatment assignment in accordance with the specified timeframes for expedited reporting of SAEs (refer to Section 8.4.1 ).
8.8. Emergency unblinding
Unblinding of a subject’s individual treatment code should occur only in the case of a 
medical emergency, or in the event of a serious medical condition, when knowledge of the treatment is essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject, as judged by the investigator.
The emergency unblinding process consists of the automated system SBIR that allows the 
investigator to have unrestricted, immediate and direct access to the subject’s individual study treatment.
The investigator has the option of contacting a GSK On-call Central Safety Physician (or 
Backup) if he/she needs medical advice or needs the support of GSK to perform the unblinding (i.e. he/she cannot access SBIR).
Any emergency unblinding must be fully documented by using the Emergency 
Unblinding Documentation Form, which must be appropriately completed by the investigator and sent within 24 hours to GSK.

Regulatory  Affairs representative and the Biostatistician of the project. The SRT is 
responsible for on- going safet y monitoring of the entire project and will meet on a regular 
basis . In order to keep all people involved in the conduct, cleaning and final analy sis of 
the study  blinded, the SRT will monitor safety  in a blinded manner.
In addition to the existi ng SRT, unblinded safet y evaluation swill be performed by  an 
iSRC at regular intervals and ad hoc as needed . The SRT will inform the iSRC about any  
potential safet y concern relevant to the study and vice versa.
8.10.2. Internal Safety  Rev iew Committee (iSRC) Evaluation
As this will be the first time that the RSV maternal vaccine will be administered in 
humans, the study  will enrol subjects in two steps with randomi sation to all dose levels
from the start (see also Figure 1). Safety monit oring will be performed by an iSRC, 
authorised b y the GSK’s Vaccine sSafet y Monitoring Board (VSMB), and holding rules 
have been established to ensure thesafet y of the subjects in the study .
The iSRC will include the following GSK personnel: a Safet y Physician (Vaccines 
Clinical Safety  andPharmacovigilance representative), a Clinician (CEPL  or CRDL ), and 
a Statistician , all external to the study /project and with no conflicts of interest in the 
outcome of the stud y. The GSK Safet y Physician will act as the Chair of the iSRC. 
Additionally , the iSRC will have (a)ad hoc , non -voting member (s): (an)independent 
statistician (s)in charge of providing unblinded data to the iSRC.
This study has 3 planned iSRC reviews.
Only  if no safet y signal is observed during each of the 2 (Day 8 and Day 31) planned 
safet y evaluations after the first 12% of subjects have been enrolled (Step 1) [See Figure 
1andFigure 2], the screening and enrolment/vaccination of the remaining subjects (Step

the study .
In addition to the above planned iSRC evaluations, ad hoc iSRC reviews can be 
organ ized, as deemed necessary  at any  time during the study .
During the planned (and any ad-hoc , if applicable) iSRC safety  evaluations, the iSRC 
will review all available safet y data in an unblinded manner, while taking into account 
any other findings that cou ld have an impact on the safet y of the subjects , and will 
determine whether there is a safet y signal or not.
Favourable outcome of the safet y reviews will be documented and provided in writing to 
the RSV study  team and investigator(s). 
If a safet y signal is observed during the planned safet y evaluations or during ad hoc
reviews , the iSRC Chai ris responsible for urgent communication and escalation of the 
concern to the GSK’ sChief Medical Officer (CMO), who may  choose to involve the 
VSMB or VSMB sub -team, and will communicat e the outcome to the study team. The 
CMO will then decide during an ad hoc meeting whether to suspend, modify  or continue 
the conduct of the stud y. 
Alread y vaccinated subjects will continue with all planned visits, including the capture of 
all safet y data. However, further enrolment/vaccination cannot proceed until CMO (with 
or without the involvement of VSMB )review and corresponding outcome is available.
The decision of the G SK’s iSRC will be documented and provided in writing to the 
Primary  Contact for the study  (study  CRDL) who will e nsure further communication of 
the outcome to investigator(s). Ethics Committees and Competent Authorities will also be 
notified, as applicable .
Details about the working procedures of the iSRC will be documented in an iSRC 
Charter.

9.1. Subject completion
A subject who is available for Cont act 1 at Day  181 foreseen in the protocol is considered 
to have completed the study .
9.2. Subject w ithdrawal
Withdrawals will not be replaced.
9.2.1. Subject w ithdrawal from the study
From an anal ysis perspective, a ‘withdrawal’ from the study  refers to any  subject who 
is 
not available for Contact 1 at Day 181 foreseen in the protocol.
All data collected until the date of withdrawal/last contact of the subject will be used for 
the anal ysis.
A subject is considered a ‘withdrawal’ from the study  when no study  procedure has 
occurred, no follow -up has been performed and no further information has been collected 
for this subject from the date of withdrawal/last contact.
Investigators will mak e at least 3 documented attempts (e.g. 2 phone calls and a letter 
sent by  certified mail to the last known address) to contact those subjects who do not 
return for scheduled visits and/or are not available for Contact 1 at Day  181.
Information relative to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator 
will document whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the stud y was made b y 
the subject, or b y the investigator, as well as which of the following possible reasons was 
responsible for withdrawal:
Serious adverse event.
Non-serious adverse event.
Protocol violation (specify ).
Consent withdrawal, not due to an adverse event*.
Moved from the stud y area.

*In case a subject is wi thdrawn from the study  because she has withdrawn consent, the 
investigator will document the reason for withdrawal of consent, if specified by  the 
subject , in the eCRF .
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study  because of SAEs/AEs must be clearl y 
distinguished from subjects who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will 
follow subjects who are withdrawn from the study  as a result of a SAE/AE until 
resolution of t he event (see Section 8.5.2).
9.3. Screening Failures
Screening failures are defined as subjects who are withdrawn from the study after giving 
informed consent, but who do not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
The following information will be collected for screening failures:
Informed consent.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria.
Demographic Data.
Physical Examination.
Blood Sample for haematology /biochemistry .
Pregnancy  test results.
SAEs rel ated to study  participation or any  fatal SAE.
Screening conclusion.
In order to allow a proper control of recruitment and not jeopardize the enrolment of 
eligible subjects into the study , as soon a subject is identified as b eing a screening failure, 
the site staff will access SBI R and withdraw that subject from the application.
9.4. Extension study
During the 
study  conclusion contact (Contact 1 / Day  181) the investigator will re-
confirm asubject ’sinterest to participate in a bo oster / re-vaccination study and the 
corresponding information will be reported in the eCRF.
If a subject is not interested in participating in the booster study  the reason for refusal will 
be documented in the subject’s e CRF (refer to Section (s)5.6.18 and 5.6.19).

10.1. Primary  endpoints
Occurrence of an y adverse events (AEs) from vac cination during a 30 -day follow -up 
period, for all subjects in all groups:
Occurrence of each solicited local and general s ymptom during a 7-day 
follow -up period.
Occurrence of an y unsolicited AE during a 3 0-day follow -up period.
Occurrence of Ser ious AEs during a 30- day follow -up period.
Occurrence of an y haematological (Leukocy tes, Neutrophils, Ly mphocy tes, 
Eosinophils, Haemoglobin, Platelets) and biochemical (alanine aminotransferase 
[ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], creatinine, blood urea nitrogen 
[BUN]) laboratory  abnormalities at Day  8 and Day  31.
10.2. Secondary  endpoints
Occurrence of SAEs from vaccination up to Day  91 and up to Day 181 for all 
subjects, in all groups.
Humoral immune response to the investigational vaccine at Day  8, Day  31, Day  61 
and Day  91 for all subjects in each investigational RSV vaccine group
RSV -A neutralising antibody (Nab) titres
RSVPreF3 IgG antibod y concentrations
10.3. Tertiary  endpoints
Additional humoral response which may  include but not limited to, RSVPreF3 specific 
IgG1 subclass antibod y concentrations, RSV -B neutralising antibody  titres, antibody  
competing for binding to specific epitopes on RSVPreF3 and antibody  concentrations to 
residual host cell proteins in the RSVPreF3 vaccines
10.4. Determination of sample size
This section provides justification of sample size in terms of safety  and immunogenicit y. 
Table 
19illustrates the precision with exact 95% confidence interval on the percentage of 
subjects with AEs following vaccination with 125subjects per group. If an AE is not 
observed in a given treatment group, we are 95% confident that the true incidence rate of 
an AE is less than or equal to 2.9
%, in the treatment group. Furthermore, a sample size of 
125 subjects per group provides a probability  of 80% or 90% to observe at least one AE 
if the true incidence rate is 1.3% or 1.8% respectively .

Exact 95 % CI computed based on Clopper/Pearson formula
Based on the results of Day  30 anal ysisfrom previous RSV vaccine studies, the standard 
deviation (SD) of RSV -A Nab titre is approximately 0.4 on its log10 transformation. 
Table 20 (below) presents the precision estimation on fold increases in RSV -A Nab titres 
between two investigational RSV vaccine dos e groups, when the sample size is 1 25
subject s/group, with a range of SD 0.3
-0.5 and 95% confidence interval for assumed fold 
increases of 1.3-2.
Assuming a 2 -fold increase of RSV -A Nab between the high and low dose groups, with 
125 subjects per group, the 95% confidence interval on the fold increase will be (1.5, 
2.67) if a standard deviation of log10 transformed RSV
-A Nab of 0.5 is assumed. There 
is a very  small (0.3%) chance that the SD will be larger than 0.5 assuming a chi-square 
distribution with degr ee of freedom 124 and mean 0.4.
The power to detect 1.5 fold increase between two groups using one -sided Z test with 
2.5% significant level will be at least 90%  with SD 0.4 and 80% with SD 0.5 assumed.
The power to detect 1.3 fold increase between two gro ups using one -sided Z test with 
2.5% significant level will be 85%  with SD 0.3 and 62% with SD 0.4 assumed.

point and will include all 
vaccinated subjects:
Meeting all eligibility criteria (i.e. no protocol violation linked to the inclusion/ 
exclusion criteria, including age).
Who received the stud y vaccine according to protocol procedures.
Who did not receive a concomitant vaccination/medication/product leading to 
elimination from the PPS anal ysis up to the corresponding time -point as described in

10.6. Derived and transformed data
The study  groups will be defined by  treatment actually  administered.
For a given subject and a given demographic variable, missing measurements will not be 
replaced.
Safety
For a given subject and the anal ysis of solicited sy mptoms within 7days post-
vaccination, missing or non -evaluable measurements will not be replaced. Therefore 
the anal ysis of the solicited sy mptoms based on the ES will include only  vaccinated 
subjects for doses with documented safet y data (i.e., symptom screen completed).
For analy sis of unsolicited adverse events (including SAEs) categorized by  primary  
Medical Dictiona ry for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) term ,all vaccinated subjects 
will be considered. Subjects who did not report the event will be considered as 
subjects without the event.
For the anal ysis of concomitant medications , all vaccinated subjects will be 
considered and anal ysis will be performed on the ES. Subj ects who did not report the 
concomitant medication will be considered as subjects without concomitant 
medication .
Imm unogenicity
For a given subject and given immunogenicit y measurement s, missing or non-
evaluable measurements will not be replaced. Therefore, an anal ysis will exclude 
subjects with missing or non-evaluable measurements.
A seronegative subject is a subject whose antibody  titre/concentration is below the 
cut-off value of the assay. A seropositive subject is a subject whose antibody  
titre/concentration is greater than or e qual to the cut -off value of the assay .
The Geometric Mean Titres /Concentrations( GMT /GMCs ) calculations are 
performed b y taking the anti -log of the mean of the log titre transformations. 
Antibody  titres below the cut- off of the assay  will be given an arbit rary value of half 
the cut -off of the assay  for the purpose of GMT/ GMC calculation. The cut off values 
are defined b y the laboratory before the analysis and will be described in the

A firstanalysis will be performed when all safet y and immunogenicit y data up to at 
least Day  91 is available in all subjects. At this point, the study  statistician will be 
unblinded (i.e. w ill have access to the individual subject treatment assignments), but 
no individual listings will be provided to investigators until the study  report.
However, summary  results may  lead to the unblinding of some specific subjects in 
case an event occurred o nly in one group; steps will be taken to minimize this risk. 
The final analy sis covering all primary  and secondary  endpoints as well as any  
evaluated tertiary  endpoint(s) will be performed when all data up to study  conclusion 
are available. A clinical stu dy report will only  be written at this stage and individual 
listings will be provided as part of it.
Ifthedata for tertiary  endpoints become savailable at a later stage, (an) additional 
analysis/anal yses will be performed. These data will be documented i
n annex(es) to the 
study  report and will be made available to the investigators at that time. 
10.11.2. Statistical considerations for interim analyses
All analy ses are descriptive. Therefore, the conduct of interim anal yses has no impact on 
interpretation of stud yresults. 
11. ADM INISTRA TIVE M ATTERS
To comply  with ICH GCP administrative obligations relating to data collection, 
monitoring, archiving data, audits, confidentiality, public disclosure requirements and 
publications must be fulfilled. 
11.1. Case Report Form/ elect ronic Case Report Form instructions
A validated GSK defined electronic data collection tool will be used as the method for 
data collection.
In all cases, subject initials will not be collected nor transmitted to GSK. Subject data 
necessary  for anal ysis and reporting will be entered/transmitted into a validated database

While completed eCRFs are reviewed b y a GSK Biologicals’ Site Monitor at the study 
site, omissions or inconsistencies detected b y subsequent eCRF review may necessitate 
clarification or correction b y the investigator or appropriatel y qualified designee. In all 
cases, the investigator remains accountable for the study  data. 
The inves tigator will be provided with the final version of the data generated at the 
investigational site once the database is archived and the study  report is complete and 
approved by all parties.
11.2. Stud y Monitoring by  GSK Biologicals
GSK will monitor the stud y to verify  that, amongst other items, the: 
Data are authentic, accurate, and complete.
Safety  and rights of subjects are being protected.
Study  is conducted in accordance with the currently  approved protocol, any other 
study  agreements, GCP and all applicable regulatory  requirements. 
The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to 
allow the monitor direct access to all relevant documents.
The investigator must ensure provision of reasonable time, space and qualified personnel 
for monitoring visits.
Direct access to all stud y-site related and source data is mandatory  for the purpose of 
monitoring review. The monitor will perform a neCRF review and a Source Document 
Verification (SDV). By SDV we understand verifying eCRF entries b y comparing them 
with the source data that will be made available by the investigator for this purpose. 
The Source Documentation Agreement Form describes the source data for the different 
data in the eCRF . This document should be completed and signed by  the site monitor and 
investigator and should be filed in the investigator’s study  file. An
y data item for which 
the eCRF will serve as the source must be identified, agreed and documented in the 
source documentation agreement form. 
Upon completion or premature discontinuation of the study , the monitor will conduct site 
closure activities with the investigator or site staff, as appropriate, in accordance with 
applicable regulations, GCP, and GSK procedures.

Following closure of the study , the investigator must maintain all site study  records 
(except for those required by  local regulations to be mainta ined elsewhere) in a safe and 
secure location. The records must be easily  accessible, when needed (e.g. audit or 
inspection), and must be available for review in conjunction with assessment of the 
facility , supporting s ystems, and staff. Where permitted by applicable laws/regulations or 
institutional policy , some or all of these records can be maintained in a validated format 
other than hard copy (e.g. microfiche, scanned, electronic); however, caution needs to be 
exercised before such action is taken. The investigator must ensure that all reproductions 
are legible and are a true and accurate cop y of the original and meet accessibility  and 
retrieval standards, including re -generating a hard copy, if required. Furthermore, the 
investigator must ensure that an acceptable back -up of the reproductions exists and that 
there is an acceptable quality  control procedure in place for making these reproductions.
GSK will inform the investigator/institution of the time period for retaining these records 
to comply  with al l applicable regulatory  requirements. The minimum retention time will 
meet the strictest standard applicable to a particular site, as dictated b y ICH GCP, any  
institutional requirements, applicable laws or regulations, or GSK standards/procedures, 
otherwis e, the minimum ret ention period will default to 30 years after completion of the 
study  report.
The investigator/institution must notify  GSK of any  changes in the archival 
arrangements, including, but not limited to archival at an off -site facility, transfe r of 
ownership of the records in the event the investigator leaves the site. 
11.4. Qualit y assurance
To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory  requirements, GSK may  
conduct a qualit y assurance audit. Regulatory agencies may  also conduct a regu latory  
inspection of this study . Such audits/in spections can occur at an y time during or after 
completion of the study. If an audit or inspection occurs, the investigator and institution 
agree to allow the auditor/inspector direct access to all relevant do cuments and to allocate 
his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and 
any relevant issues.

Descriptions of available assay s are provided below. Assay  descriptions could be subject
to change, due to assay  re-development and/or qualification. Assay  Standard Operating 
Procedures and characterization/qualification reports will be submitted to FDA upon 
availability .
RSV  A/B neutralization assay
The serum neutralization assay  is a functional assay  that measures the ability  of serum 
antibodies to neutralize RSV entry  and replication in a host cell line.
First, virus neutralization is performed b y incubating a fixed amount of RSV -A strain 
(Long) or RSV -B strain (B18537) with serial dilutions of the te st serum. Then, the serum-
virus mixture is transferred onto a monolay er of Vero cells (African Green Monkey , 
kidney , 
Cercopitheus aethiops , ATCC CCL -81) and incubated for three day s to allow 
infection of Vero cells b y non -neutralized viruses and the format ion of plaques in the cell 
monolay er. Following the fixation period, RSV -infected cells are detected using a 
primary  antibody  directed against RSV (anti -RSV IgG) and a secondary  antibody  
conjugated horse -radish peroxidase (HRP), allowing the visualization of plaques after 
coloration with TrueBlueTMperoxidase substrate. Viral plaques are counted using an 
automated microscope coupled to an image analy zer(Scanlab sy stem with Axiovision 
software). For each serum dilution, a ratio, expressed as a percentage, i s calculated 
between the number of plaques at that dilution and the number of plaques in the virus 
control wells (no serum added). The serum Nab titres is expressed in ED60 (Estimated 
Dilution 60) and corresponds to the inverse of the interpolated serum di lution that y ields 
a 60% reduction in the number of plaques compared to the virus control wells as 
described b y others [ Barbas , 1992; 
Bates , 2014].
RSV PreF3 ELISA
The RSVPreF3 IgGand IgG1 ELISA ’sareunder development. The assay swill be based 
on an indirect ELISA allowing the detection and the quantification of total IgG or IgG1 
antibodies directed against RSVPreF3 in human serum samples.
The principle of this assay wil l be as follows: RSVPreF3 antigen will be adsorbed onto a 
96-well poly styrene microplate. After a washing and a blocking step, dilutions of serum 
samples, controls and standards will be added to the coated microplate. A reference 
standard curve will be prepared using a pool of commercial human serum containing 
anti-
RSV antibodies. After incubation, the microplate will be washed to remove unbound 
primary  antibodies. Bound IgG or IgG1 will be detected b y the addition of a secondary 
anti-human antibody  conjugated to HRP. Bound antibodies are quantified by  the addition 
of the HRP substrate, tetramethylbenzidine and hydrogen peroxide, whereby  a colored 
product develops proportional ly to the amount of anti -RSVPreF3 IgG or IgG1 antibodies 
present in the serum sample. The optical density of each sample dilution is then 
interpolated on the reference standard. The corresponding antibod y concentration, 
corrected for the dilution factor, is expressed in arbitrary ELISA Laboratory  Units per 
milliliter (ELU/mL).

13-AUG -2018 97Epitope specific competition assay
Epitope specific competition assay s are based on the competitive binding between a 
labelled epitope -specific monoclonal antibody  and non -labelled antibodies present in 
serum samples and targeting the same epitope on a coated antigen. A competition assay  
specific for the site 0 epitope, using RSVPreF3 protein as coating antigen, is under 
development.
The principle of competition assay s is as follows: The RSVPre F3 protein antigen will be 
coated onto an assay  plate. After blocking, dilutions of control serum or sample, as well 
as labelled, epito pe-specific, monoclonal antibody, are added to the coated plate. If 
epitope- specific antibodies are present in serum samples, they  will compete with the 
monoclonal antibody  for binding to the epitope on the antigen -coated plate. After 
washing, the bound, labelled antibody  is then quantitated using a validated chromogenic 
detection sy stem. The intensity  of the detected signal is inversely  proportional to the 
concentration of the epitope -specific antibodies present in the sample. 
The antibody  concentrations are calculated for each control and sample b y transforming 
the OD values corresponding to the dilutions into a % competition value, and from this, 
the epitope -specific antibody  concentration of the samples and controls is calculated.

(SEPTEMBER 2007)
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) current thinking 
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not 
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach 
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to 
discuss an alternativ e approach, contact the appropriate FDA staff. If you cannot identify 
the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this 
guidance.
INTRODUCTION
Preventive vaccines are usually  developed to prevent disease in a healthy  population. The 
Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, 
regulates preventive vaccines under authorit y of section 351 of the Public Health Service 
Act (42 U.S.C. 262), as well as specific sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act, and reviews investigational new drug applications (INDs) and biologics license 
applications (BLAs) (see, for example, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 
312, 600, and 601). Most of the clinical trials of preventi ve vaccines conducted to support 
INDs and BLAs enroll healthy  volunteers in all phases of vaccine testing. The enrollment 
of health y volunteers warrants a very low tolerance for risk in those clinical trials.
This guidance provides you, sponsors, monitors, and investigators of vaccine trials, with 
recommendations on assessing the severit y of clinical and laboratory abnormalities in 
healthy  adult and adolescent volunteers enrolled in clinical trials. The grading s ystem 
described in the table can also be usef ul in defining a particular study ’s stopping rules 
(e.g., a certain number of AEs, as defined in the table, may  call for stopping the study ). 
Less extreme observations (e.g., mild) may  not require discontinuing the study  vaccine 
but can still contribute to evaluating safety  by identify ing parameters to focus upon in 
subsequent product development. Uniform criteria for categorizing toxicities in healthy  
volunteers can improve comparisons of safet y data among groups within the same stud y 
and also between diff erent studies. We, FDA, recommend using toxicity  grading scale 
tables, provided below, as a guideline for selecting the assessment criteria to be used in a 
clinical trial of a preventive vaccine. We recommend incorporation of such appropriate, 
uniform, cri teria into the investigational plan, case report forms, and study  reports and 
correspondence with FDA, sponsors, monitors, investigators, and IRBs.
This guidance finalizes the draft guidance of the same title dated April 2005 (70 FR 
22664, May  2,2005).
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally  enforceable 
responsibilities. I nstead, guidances describe FDA’s current thinking on a topic and should 
be viewed onl y as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or stat utory  requ irements 
are cited. The use of the word should in FDA’s guidances means that something is 
suggested or recommended, but not required.

13-AUG -2018 100BACKGROUND
Standardized toxicity  assessment scales have been widely  used to evaluate products 
treating specific diseases. For example, the National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity  
Criteria Scale and the Division of AIDS’ Toxicity  Grading Scale standardize the 
evaluation of adverse events among patients with cancer and HIV/AIDS, respectivel y 
(Refs. 1, 2). The defined toxici ty parameters in those scales are designed for patients who 
may alread y experience mild, moderate, or severe adverse clinical or laboratory  events 
due to the disease process, and may  not be appropriate for health y volunteers.
In the development o f the toxicity  grading scales for health y volunteers, we chose 
parameter limit values based on published information, when such values were available 
(Refs. 1 -6). For example, the Brighton Collaboration has developed case definitions and 
guidelines to evaluate some adverse events associated with administering vaccines (Ref. 
3). In some cases, parameter limit values were based on clinical experience and 
experience reviewing vaccine clinical trials that enroll normal health y subjects.
Toxicity  grading scales for labora tory abnormalities should consider the local laboratory  
reference values when the parameter limit values are defined. The characterization of 
laboratory  parameters among some populations of healthy  adults and adolescents may  
require the exercise of clinical judgment, for example, consideration of the potential for 
ethnic differences in white blood cell (WBC) counts or gender differences in creatine 
phosphokinase (CPK) values.
TOXICITY GRADING SCALE TABLES
Adverse events in a clinical trial of an i nvestigati onal vaccine must be recorded and 
monitored and, when appropriate, reported to FDA and others involved in an 
investigation (sponsors, IRBs, and investigators). (See, for example, 21 CFR 312.32, 
312.33, 312.50, 312.55, 312.56, 312.60, 312.62, 312.64, and 312.66). Although the use of 
a toxicity  grading scale for adverse events would not replace these regulatory  
requirements, using a scale to c ategori se adverse events observed during a clinical trial 
may assist y ou in monitoring safet y and making required repo rts. Nonetheless, we believe 
that categorization or grading of data as outlined in this document is supplementary  to 
and should not replace full and complete data analy sis.
These guidelines for toxicity  grading scales are primarily  intended for healthy  adult and 
adolescent volunteers. The parameters in the tables below are not necessarily  applicable 
to every  clinical trial of healthy  volunteers. The parameters monitored should be 
appropriate for the specific study  vaccine. For some preventive vaccines under
development, it may  be appropriate to include additional parameters to be monitored 
during a clinical trial or to alter the choice of values in the toxicity  table. For example, 
additional parameters might be added based on one or more of the following: sa fety 
signals observed in pre -clinical toxicology  studies, the biological plausibility of the 
occurrence of certain adverse events, or previous experience with a similar licensed 
product.

13-AUG -2018 101As discussed above, the tables do not represent a recommend ation to m onitor all the 
listed parameters in all clinical trials of health y volunteers, nor do the tables represent all 
possible parameters to be monitored. I n addition, these tables do not represent study  
inclusion or exclusion criteria. We recommend that the parameters monitored be 
appropriate for the stud y vaccine administered to healthy  volunteers participating in the 
clinical trial.
Tables for Clinical Abnormalities
Note from the sponsor : The tables in this section of the guidance will not be used in this 
particular stud y. Instead, the parameters as provided in the study protocol are to be used.
Tables for Laboratory Abnormalities
The laboratory  values provided in the tables below serve as guidelines and are dependent 
upon institutional nor mal paramete rs. Institutional normal reference ranges should be 
provided to demonstrate that they  are appropriate.
Only  those parameters that will be assessed as part of the study  have been maintained in 
the tables below.

** The clinical signs or symptoms associated with laboratory abnormalities might result in characterization of the 
laboratory abnormalities as Potentially Life Threatening (Grade 4). For example, a low sodium value that falls within a 
Grade 3 parameter (125 -129 mE/L) should be recorded as a Grade 4 hyponatremia event if the subject had a new 
seizure associated with the low sodium value.

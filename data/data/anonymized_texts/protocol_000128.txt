Title:  A Randomized Phase II Study of Bortezomib Pl us ICE (BICE) Versus Standard ICE for 
Patients with Relapsed/Refractor y Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma  
 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of this study are to: 
• To determine the objective response rate (ORR), partial remissions (PR), and complete 
remissions (CR) after 3 cycles of bortezomib plus ICE (BICE) versus ICE in patients with 
relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). 
• To evaluate 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with 3 cycles of BICE 
versus ICE. 
The secondary objectives of this study are to: 
• To compare PET scan response after 3 cycles of BICE versus ICE chemotherapy. 
• To compare serum levels of tumor necrosis f actor (TNF) proteins (APRIL, BLyS, sCD30, and 
CD40L) and CC thymus and activation-related cytoki ne (TARC) at baseline and after 3 cycles of 
BICE versus ICE chemotherapy. 
• To correlate baseline cytokine/chemoki ne levels with response to therapy.  
Patient population 
Patients with relapsed/refractory cHL who have received prior front-line anthracyline-containing 
chemotherapy. Specific inclusion and exclus ion criteria are detailed in section 3.2. 
Number of patients 
Maximum number of patients planned to enroll is 50. 
Study design and methodology 
Randomized study to 2 arms of therapy. Arm A is VELCADE or Bortezomib plus ICE (BICE) 
chemotherapy and Arm B is ICE (Ifosfamide, Carbopl atin, and Etoposide) chem otherapy. Patients will 
have imaging done at baseline with CTs and PET/CT and then repeated after 3 cycles to assess response. 
Patients can also provide consent to participate in the optional correlative studies. For these studies blood 
will collected at baseline and after 3 cycles of thera py in order to perform serum protein analyses of TNF 
and TARC protein levels. 
Treatments administered 
Arm A: BICE: VELCADE on Day 1 and 4, ICE from Day 1 to 3, Neulasta on Day 5. 
Arm B: ICE from Day 1 to 3, Neulasta on Day 4.

analyses of TNF and TARC protein levels. 
Safety data collected 
The following evaluations will be condu cted to assess the safety of VELCADE:  
• Patients will undergo careful monitoring while on study. This includes weekly blood work and 
detailed parameters for retreatment as specified in  the protocol including for absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC), platelet, bilirubin, alkaline phos phatase, AST, ALT, and creatinine. Additional 
safety monitoring is also incorporated for peripheral neuropathy for retreatment, as well as other non-hematologic, non-nephrologic, and non-hepatic toxicities.  
Statistical procedures 
 
The phase II part of this study is to compare ICE only and BICE in treating patients with classical 
Hodgkin lymphoma.  The primary outcome is complete remission.  The estimated accrual rate is 2 or 4 
patients per month.   A maximum of 50 patients will be accrued.  Patients will be evaluated for response 
after 0.75 months after receiving treatment for 3 cycles (14 days per cycle).  The patients will be 
randomized between ICE and BICE arms using a Bayesi an adaptive algorithm.  In general, the trial will 
proceed as follows: The initial 20 patients will be randomized fairly with probability of 0.50 each 
between the two arms, so that the number of patients in each arm is equal at the start of the trial.  Thereafter, as the trial proceeds patients will be ra ndomized to the two groups with unequal probabilities 
in favor of the treatment that, on average, yields  better response rate.  Consequently, each successive 
patient is more likely to receive the treatment with a better response rate, on average.  The details of the 
adaptive randomization scheme are as follows: 
Denote the response rate at each of the two treatment arms by { π
1, π2} (1 for ICE, 2 for BICE).  Based on 
the currently available data, we assume the prior distribution for the response rate is π1 ~ Beta (0.5, 0.5) 
and π
2 ~ Beta (0.6, 0.4), respectively.  The resulting prior mean (95% credible interval) for ICE and BICE 
are 0.5(0.002, 0.99) and 0.6(0.007, 0.99), respectively.   After the initial first 20 patients being randomized 
to two treatment groups with an equal probabilit y, each new patient will be randomized to receive 
treatment i with probability ρi=prob(πi > πj, j ≠i| Data), i, j=1,2.  If one of these two randomization 
probabilities falls below 0.025 then that ar m will be dropped.  In addition, if prob( πi > 0.25|data) < 0.05, 
i.e. the data indicates that the response rate in that arm is highly unlikely to be la rger than 0.25, then that 
arm will be dropped.  On the other hand, if one of  the two randomization probabilities exceeds 0.975 then 
the trial will be terminated and that treatment arm wi ll be selected.  If the trial does not stop early and the 
maximum 50 patients are accrued, a treatment is selected as being “better” if the probability that one 
treatment’s response rate is larger than the other’s response rate exceeds 0.95.   
 Furthermore, serum levels of TNF proteins (APRIL, BLyS, sCD30, and CD40L) and TARC as 
determined at baseline compared to post-treatment with will be analyzed for both the BICE and ICE 
treatment groups by Mann-Whitney U test. Second, serum levels for each protein as determined at baseline compared to post-treatment will be analyzed for both the BICE and ICE treatment groups according to response rates as determined by IWG 1999  response criteria (CR, PR, SD, versus PD) by the 
Kruskal-Wallis test. Third, serum levels for each protein as determined at baseline compared to post-treatment will be analyzed for both the BICE and ICE treatment groups according to PET scan results 
(PET negative versus PET positive) at completion of th erapy by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Significance will 
be set for p ≤ 0.05.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 10 1 INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE 
1.1 Overview of the Disease 
1.1.1  Relapsed/Refractory Cl assical Hodgkin Lymphoma 
Although Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is considered highly curable, up to 15% of stage I/II and 
40% of stage III/IV patients will experience relapse, and 10-15% of patients will have primary refractory disease. This paired with the incidenc e in patients who are in their 20s to 30s makes 
successful treatment of relapsed/refractory dise ase of critical importance. Only patients who 
obtain a positive response to 2nd-line chemotherapy followed by an autologous stem cell 
transplant (ASCT) have the poten tial of long-term disease-free su rvival. In addition, patients who 
achieve complete remission with 2nd-line chemotherapy prior to ASCT have higher disease-free 
survivals than those who do not (Moskowitz et al., 2001).  
1.2  VELCADE (bortezomib) for Injection 1.2.1  Scientific Background 
VELCADE™ (bortezomib) for Injection is a sma ll molecule proteasome inhibitor developed by 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (Millennium) as  a novel agent to treat human malignancies.  
VELCADE is currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Ad ministration (US FDA) 
and it is registered in Europe for the treatme nt of multiple myeloma patients front-line and 
relapsed and mantle cell lymphoma patients who have received at le ast 1 prior therapy. 
  
By inhibiting a single molecular target, the proteasome, bortezomib affects multiple signaling 
pathways.  The anti-neoplastic effect of bortezo mib likely involves several distinct mechanisms, 
including inhibition of cell growth and survival  pathways, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition 
of expression of genes that control cellular adhesion, migration and angiogenesis.  Thus, the 
mechanisms by which bortezomib elicits its anti tumor activity may vary among tumor types, and 
the extent to which each affected pathway is criti cal to the inhibition of tumor growth could also 
differ.  Bortezomib has a novel pattern of cytotoxicity in National Cancer Institute (NCI) in vitro and in vivo assays (Adams et al., 1999).  In addition, bortezomib has cy totoxic activity in a 
variety of xenograft tumor models, both as a sing le agent and in combin ation with chemotherapy 
and radiation (Steiner et al., 2001; Teicher et al., 1999; Cusack et  al., 2001; LeBlanc et al., 2002; 
Pink et al., 2002).  Notably, bort ezomib induces apoptosis in cells  that over express bcl-2, a 
genetic trait that conf ers unregulated growth and resistan ce to conventional chemotherapeutics 
(McConkey et al., 1999).  Bortezomib is thought to be efficacious in multiple  myeloma via its inhibi tion of nuclear factor 
κB (NF- κB) activation, its atte nuation of interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated cell growth, a direct 
apoptotic effect, and possibly anti-angiogeni c and other effects (Hideshima et al., 2001).

CONFIDENTIAL Page 11 1.2.2  Nonclinical Pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic studies  were conducted in the rat and cynomolgus 
monkey.  Upon intravenous (IV) bolus administration, bortezomib displays a rapid distribution 
phase (t½α <10 minutes) followed by a longer elimination phase (t½ β 5–15 hours).  Bortezomib 
has a large volume of distribu tion (range 5–50 L/kg).  The plasma PK profile is well described 
by a 2-compartment model.  The pharmacodynamic action of bortezomib is well established and can be measured through an ex vivo assay (20S proteasome activity) (Light cap et al., 2000).  This assay was used to 
determine the duration of drug eff ect in lieu of the PK data in the early preclinical toxicology 
studies as well as to set a guide for dose escalation in humans.  Following dosing with bortezomib in the rat and cynomolgus monkey, proteasome inhibition in peripheral blood had a half-life less than 24 hours, with  proteasome activity returning to pretreatment baseline within 24 
hours in monkey and within 48 to 72 hours in ra t after a single dose of bortezomib.  Further, 
intermittent but high inhibition (>70%) of proteasome activity was better tolerated than sustained inhibition.  Thus, a twice-weekly clinical dosing regimen was chosen  in order to allow return of 
proteasome activity towards baselin e between dose administrations. 
1.2.3  Nonclinical Toxicity 
Single-dose IV toxicity studies were conducted with bortezomib in the mouse, rat, dog, and 
monkey to establish the single-dose maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  The MTDs were 0.25 
mg/kg (1.5 mg/m
2) and 0.067 mg/kg (0.8 mg/m2) in the 2 most sensitive species, rat and 
monkey, respectively.  Repeat-dose multi-cycle toxicity studies of 3 a nd 6 months in the rat and 9 months in the 
monkey, each with 8-week recovery periods, were conducted to characterize the chronic toxicity 
of bortezomib when administered by the clinical  route and regimen of administration.  The MTD 
in the 6-month rat study was 0.10 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m
2) and the key target organs were the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tr act, hematopoietic and lymphoid sy stems.  The MTD in the 9-month 
monkey study was 0.05 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2) and the key target organs were the GI tract, 
hematopoietic and lymphoid systems, peripheral nervous system, and kidney.  Full or partial reversibility was observed for each of the toxicities described to date.    In general, the nature of the toxicity of bortezo mib is similar across species , and target organs of 
toxicity in animals have been largely predictive of  human toxicity.  The toxicity of bortezomib in 
animals is characterized by a steep dose-response with mortality seen at dosages above the MTD.  The cause of death at acutely lethal dosages is cons idered to be related to indirect cardiovascular 
(CV) effects of hypotension and vascular changes with secondary bradycardia and the cause of 
death in long-term studies has been attributed to  GI or hematologic toxi city.  The pharmacologic 
effects of bortezomib on the CV system have  been extensively characterized and have 
demonstrated that indirect eff ects on CV function occur only at acutely lethal dosages and are 
abrogated by routine supportive care.

bortezomib may be found in the 2006 Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.2.4  Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
The clinical pharmacology characterization of bor tezomib has been determined from phase 1 
studies in subjects with solid tumors and hemato logical malignancies, and confirmed in phase 2 
studies in subjects with multiple myeloma. 
 Bortezomib demonstrates multi-compartmental pharmacokinetics. Following intravenous administration of 1.0 mg/m
2 and 1.3 mg/m2 dose, the mean first-dose maximum observed plasma 
concentrations of bortezomib were 57 and 112 ng/ mL, respectively in 11 patients with multiple 
myeloma and creatinine clearance values >50 mL/min participating in a pharmacokinetics study.  
In subsequent doses, mean maximum observed pl asma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 
ng/mL for the 1.0 mg/m2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m2 dose.  The mean 
elimination half-life of bortezomib upon multip le dosing ranged from 40 to 193 hours.  
Bortezomib is eliminated more rapidly following  the first dose.  Mean Total Body Clearances 
were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2, 
respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h fo llowing subsequent doses for doses of 1.0 and 
1.3 mg/m2, respectively.  Clinical experience has show n that the change in  clearance does not 
result in overt toxicity from accumulation in this multidose regimen in humans. In subjects with advanced malignancies, th e maximum pharmacodynamic effect (inhibition of 
20S activity) occurred within 1-hour post dos e.  At the therapeutic dose of 1.3 mg/m
2 in subjects 
with multiple myeloma, the mean proteasome inhibition at 1-hour post dose was approximately 61%.  The time course of proteasome inhibition in subjects is characterized  by maximum inhibition 
observed within the first hour after administratio n, followed by partial recovery of proteasome 
activity over the next 6 to 24 hours to within 50% of the pretreatment activity.  On the Day 1, 4, 
8, and 11 schedule, variable (10%–30%) levels of  proteasome inhibition have been observed at 
next scheduled dosing.  In theory, this advantag e allows cells to recover proteasome activity for 
normal cellular housekeeping functions between doses. 
 The relationship between bortezomib plasma con centrations and proteasome inhibition can be 
described by a maximum effect (E
max) model.  The E max curve is initially very steep, with small 
changes in plasma bortezomib concentration over the range of 0.5 to 2.0 ng/mL relating to large 
increases in the percent inhibi tion (0–60%).  After that, a pl ateau occurs where marginal 
increases of proteasome inhibiti on are observed in spite of large changes in plasma bortezomib 
concentrations. 
1.2.5  Clinical Experience in Myeloma 
It is estimated that more than 55,000 patient s have been treated with VELCADE, including 
patients treated through Millennium-sponsored clinical trials, Investigator-I nitiated Studies, the

The overall goal of the Millennium phase I program was to determine the MTD and dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT) of VELC ADE in a number of therapeutic  settings involving subjects 
with various advanced malignancies.  In a Phase I trial in patients with refractory hematologic 
malignancies, the MTD for a twice weekly for 4 weeks of a 42 day cycle was 1.04 mg/m2/dose, 
with DLTs of thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, fatigue, and malaise (Orlowski et al., 2002).  The toxicity was greates t during the third and fourth weeks of therapy. In the 3-week 
schedule of VELCADE monotherapy (4 doses , given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day 
treatment cycle), the DLT occurred at 1.56 mg/m
2/dose (3 subjects with Grade 3 diarrhea and 1 
with peripheral sensory neuropathy).  Theref ore, the MTD at this schedule was 1.3 mg/m2/dose.  
In a 35-day treatment cycle with 4 weekly doses of VELCADE monotherapy, the MTD was 1.6 
mg/m2/dose and DLT included hypotension, tach ycardia, diarrhea, and syncope.  
  In phase 1 clinical studies, anti-tumor activ ity was reported in subjects with NHL, multiple 
myeloma, Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia, s quamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx,

The safety and efficacy of VELCADE in subjects  with multiple myeloma were investigated in 
two phase 2 clinical studies, st udies M34100-024 (subjects  with first relapse)  (Jagannath et al, 
2004) and M34100-025 (subjects with second or greater relapse and re fractory to their last prior 
therapy) (Richardson et al, 2003).  In M 34100-025, 202 heavily pre-tr eated subjects with 
refractory multiple myeloma after at least 2 pr evious treatments received VELCADE, 1.3 mg/m
2 
on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle. The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) response criter ia, as described by Blade (Blade et al., 1998) were utilized to 
determine disease response.  CRs were observed in 4% of subjects, with an additional 6% of patients meeting all criteria for CR but having a positive immunofixation test.  PR or better was 
observed in 27% of subjects, a nd the overall response rate (CR,  PR and minor response [MR] 
combined) was 35%.  Seventy percent of subj ects experienced stable disease or better. 
   
The phase 3 study (M34101-039) (Richardson et al , 2005), also referred to as the APEX study, 
was designed to determine whether VELCADE pr ovided benefit (time to progression [TTP], 
response rate, and survival) to patients with relaps ed or refractory MM rela tive to treatment with 
high-dose dexamethasone.  The study was also designed to determine the safety and tolerability 
of VELCADE relative to high-dose dexamethasone, and whether treatment with VELCADE was associated with superior clinical benefit and quality of life re lative to high-dose dexamethasone. 
A total of 669 patients were enrolled and 663 patients re ceived study drug (VELCADE: 331; 
dexamethasone: 332).  Patients randomized to VELCADE received 1.3 mg/m
2 I.V. push twice 
weekly on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3-week cycle for up to eight treatment cycles as induction 
therapy, followed by 1.3 mg/m2 VELCADE weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 5-week cycle 
for three cycles as maintenance therapy. Patie nts randomized to dexamethasone received oral 
dexamethasone 40 mg once daily on days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of a 5-week cycle for up to 
four treatment cycles as induction therapy, followed by dexamethasone 40 mg once daily on days 1 to 4 followed of a 4-week cycle for five  cycles as maintenance therapy. The European

(Blade et al., 1998) were utilized to determine disease response.  There was a 78% increase in 
TTP for the VELCADE arm. Median TTP wa s 6.2 months for the VELCADE arm and 3.5 
months for the dexamethasone arm ( P<.0001). CR (complete response) + PR (partial response) 
was 38% with VELCADE vs. 18% with dexamethasone ( P<.0001). CR was 6% with VELCADE

with dexamethasone. In patients who had receiv ed only one prior line of treatment (VELCADE: 
132; dexamethasone: 119), CR + PR was 45% w ith VELCADE vs. 26% with dexamethasone 
(P=.0035). With a median 8.3 months of follow- up, overall survival was significantly longer 
(P=.0013) for patients on the VELCADE arm vs. patients on the dexamethasone arm. The 
probability of survival at one year was 80% for the VELCADE arm vs. 66% for the 
dexamethasone arm, which represented a 41% decrea sed relative risk of de ath in the first year 
with VELCADE ( P=.0005). In patients who had received only one prior line of treatment, the

M34101-039 (Richardson ASH, 2005). The update d CR (complete response) + PR (partial 
response) rate was 43% with VELCADE. The CR  + nCR rate was 16% with VELCADE. With a 
median 22 months of follow-up, overall survival was significa ntly longer for patients on the 
VELCADE arm vs. patients on the dexamethasone  arm. The median overall survival was 29.8 
months (95% CI: 23.2, not estimable) for th e VELCADE arm vs 23.7 months (95% CI: 18.7,

1.3  VELCADE (bortezomib) pl us ICE for Classical HL  
1.3.1   Rationale for BICE Treatment and Study Endpoints 
1.3.1a Outcomes for ICE followed by ASCT fo r relapsed/refractory classical HL  
Salvage treatment of relapsed/refract ory Hodgkin lymphoma patients with 2
nd-line chemotherapy 
with ICE followed by an autologous stem cell tran splant results in a 40 to 60% long-term event-
free survival rate. In additi on, patients who have evidence of CR after ICE have a 20% 
improvement in event-free survival compared to  patients in PR and approximately 20-25% of 
patients achieve CR as evaluated by Internati onal Working Group (IWG) 1999 CT criteria after 
2-3 cycles of ICE (Moskowitz et  al., 2001; Abali et al., 2008). 
1.3.1b Significance of PET scans in early respon se assessment and prediction of outcomes  
 
PET scans have emerged as a powerful method of response rate assessment in lymphoma. The 
key advantage of PET scans over CT scans is the ability to distinguish between viable tumor and necrosis or fibrosis present after completion of treatment. This is particularly important in HL 
patients who often can present with bulky and/or  mediastinal masses which commonly result in 
residual masses on CT scan after treatment comp letion. Given this positive benefit the 1999 IWG 
criteria (Cheson et al., 1999) for response asse ssment of malignant lymphoma were updated in 
2007 with CR now being assessed if PET scan pos itive areas prior to treatment have become 
PET scan negative regardless of size (Cheson et al., 2007). This is in striking difference to the 
original IWG criteria published in 1999 which for CR requires the complete disappearance of all 
detectable radiographic evidence of dis ease on CT scans (Cheson et al., 1999).  
 PET-based criteria are now routinely used in HL  to assess response to front-line therapy. PET 
scan response has been shown to predict progr ession-free survival (PFS)  and overall survival 
(OS) after 2 cycles of chem otherapy with a 2-year PFS in PET negative patients of 96% 
compared to 0% for PET positive patients (Hutch ings et al., 2006). In addition, recent analysis

Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  12/18/2008 
VELCADE IIS Protocol Template MAF 6.30.2010 F 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 20 has shown that PET scan assessment after course 2 of ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, 
vinblastine, dacarbazine) chemotherapy is better than the commonly referenced International Prognostic Score (IPS) in prognostic value with 2- year PFS of 95% for those with negative PET 
scans after cycle 2 of treatment compared to 13% for those with positive P ET scans (Gallamini et 
al., 2007).   1.3.1c Relevance of PET scans for response assess ment in relapsed/refractory cHL patients  
 While substantial data exists for the use of P ET scans and the revised 2007 IWG criteria in the 
front-line setting, the use of PET scans in the relapsed/refractory 2
nd-line and higher treatment 
setting is still being de fined. Emerging data however shows that there is prognostic significance 
of PET scan response pre-ASCT in predicting outcomes post-ASCT (Seam et al., 2007). In a retrospective clinical study  in lymphoma patients undergoing ASCT the event-free survival 
(EFS) rate was 80% in patients who had negative pre-ASCT PET images as compared to 43% in patients who had positive pre-ASCT PET images  (Filmont et al., 2007). Another study showed 
retrospectively that the median PFS was 19 mont hs for patients with negative pre-ASCT PET 
scans as compared to 5 months for patients w ith positive pre-ASCT PET scans (Svoboda et al., 
2006). It has also been demonstrated that early PET assessment after 2 cycles of 2
nd-line 
chemotherapy in combination with their recu rring Hodgkin score (Josting et al., 2002) was 
useful in identifying four categories of risk for relapse after ASCT (Schot et al., 2007). Further 
evaluation of PET scan response in a prospective c linical trial holds the ab ility to further define 
the relevance of PET scan response pre-ASCT after 2nd-line chemotherapy through correlation 
with PFS.  1.3.1d Significance of the diversity of the nuclear factor (NF)- κB signaling pathway  
           and activation through TNF receptor binding  
 
The importance of NF- κB signaling was first identified in multiple myeloma and led to the 
development and approval of bortezomib. Data ha s now emerged which supports the role of both 
classical (canonical) and alte rnative (noncanonical) NF- κB pathways. The diversity of these 
pathways allow for NF- κB activity even in the setting of ge netic abnormalities. The classical 
pathway when activated results in nuclear transloca tion of the heterodimer of p50/p65 while the 
alternative pathway results in nuclear transloca tion of the heterodimer of p52/relB. Bortezomib 
blocks proteasome degrad ation of phosphorylated Iκ Bα and p100 in respectiv ely the classical 
and alternative pathways, and thus prevents nuclear translocation of the p50/65 and p52/relB 
heterodimers and inhibits NF-κ B activity.  Furthermore, the TNF receptor family which includes 
BCMA, TACI, BR3, CD30, and CD40 have been shown to be able to activate the NF- κB 
pathway (Annunziata et al., 2007).  
 
1.3.1e Significance of the interdep endence of Reed-Sternberg cells on the microenvironment.  
 The unique biology of Hodgkin lymphoma is related to the interdependence of the rare RS cells 
with the surrounding microenvironment (Figure 1). This microenvironment is composed of B and T cells and macrophages which provide surviv al signals to the RS cells and thus support 
Hodgkin lymphoma tumor growth. The TNF superfamily of proteins has a key role in the microenvironment cross-signaling with the RS cells and is composed of APRIL, BLyS, 
CD30L/CD30, and CD40L/CD40.

VELCADE IIS Protocol Template MAF 6.30.2010 F 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 21  
APRIL and BLyS are TNF ligands which have im portant roles in the both malignant and benign 
B cell function and are expressed by macrophage s which surround RS cells. APRIL and BLyS 
bind to BCMA and TACI and BLyS can bind a th ird receptor BR3 (Bossen et al., 2006). These 
receptors are found on both normal and malignant B cells, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and Hodgkin RS cells. In  CLL BLyS was found to bind to BR3 and 
activate the alternative NF- κB pathway, while BLyS and APRIL were found to bind to BCMA 
and TACI and activate the classical NF- κB pathway (Endo et al., 2007). Similar to RS cells CLL 
cells are also dependent on cyt okine support from nurselike cells in the microenvironment which 
also express high levels of ARRIL and BLyS. In a retrospective non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) 
study, serum BLyS levels at time of diagnosis we re found to correlate with disease outcome with 
patients who had BLyS levels > 40 ng/mL having a poorer median overall survival. In addition, 
BLyS levels increased in patients after transformation of follicular lymphoma to large B cell lymphoma suggesting the BLyS expression may also correlate with disease severity (Novak et al., 2004).  CD30 has dense expression on RS cells, but rare  expression on normal cells (Yazbeck et al., 
2006). Benefit has been seen in HL clinical tr ials which have targeted CD30 through antibodies 
or antibody-drug conjugates (Ansell et al., 2007 ; Bartlett et al., 2008; Hamblett et al., 2005). 
CD30L (CD153) is a transmembrane protein which is expressed by the surrounding B and T 
cells, but is not expressed by RS cells and has paradoxical effects on cell survival when 
compared to CD30 by inducing cell death of CD30 RS cells.  In addition, the soluble form of CD30 (sCD30) has been found to be an independ ent negative prognostic factor for event-free 
survival (EFS) and is thought to potentially protect CD30 tumor cells from CD30L induced 
apoptosis (Younes et al., 1997). In a retrospective analysis of HL patients treated with front-line 
chemotherapy a baseline sCD30 level of ≥ 100 U/mL as compared to ≤ 100 U/mL predicted for a 
5-year EFS of 60% versus 88% (Nadali et al., 1998).  
 CD40 expression is less restricted  that CD30 and is expressed by B and T cells and the Hodgkin 
RS cells. RS cells do not express CD40L (CD 154), but receive CD40L signals from the 
surrounding microenvironment. CD40  can be targeted for the treatment of HL and NHL, and 
currently two antibodies are being evaluated for treatment (F orero-Torres et al., 2006; Hsu et al., 
2006). While the role of soluble CD40L in predic ting prognosis has not yet been fully evaluated 
in lymphoma, prognostic significance has been dem onstrated in patients with acute coronary 
syndromes. Soluble CD40L is shed from stimulat ed lymphocytes and released after platelet 
stimulation, and soluble CD40L > 5 μg/L in patients with unstable coronary artery disease 
identified patients at increased risk of further coronary events and thos e who would benefit from 
antiplatelet therapy (H eeschen et al., 2003).  
 Although not a TNF family protein, CC thymus a nd activation-related cytokine (TARC) is a 
protein highly produced by RS cells and antigen -presenting cells and attracts T cells by 
stimulating the CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4). Thus, TARC is thought to have a role in 
allowing RS cells to provide positive feedback to the microenvironment T cells. A retrospective 
study of HL patients treated with front-li ne chemotherapy demonstrated the prognostic 
significance of baseline TARC levels with leve ls of > 2,000 pg/mL being correlated with a 
higher rate of relapse and inferior survival (Weihrauch et al., 2005).

1.3.1f Relevance of APRIL, BLyS, sCD30, CD40L, and TARC to predict response  
          in relapsed/refractory HL treatment  The clinical significance of ba seline serum levels of BLyS, sCD30, and TARC have been 
retrospectively evaluated in pati ents receiving front-line treatm ent for lymphoma (Novak et al., 
2004; Nadali et al., 1998; Weihrauch et al., 2005; Ok i et al., 2007). However, the significance of 
baseline and post-2
nd-line treatment values in the relapsed/refractory setting has not yet been 
determined. Further evaluation holds potential va lue of developing surrogate markers to predict 
radiographic response to chemotherapy.

1.3.2  Preliminary Studies 
We have previously evaluated bortezomib both precl inically and clinically, shown that PET scan 
negativity in HL correlates with E FS, and have demonstrated the poten tial role of serum levels of 
BLyS and TARC as prognostic and predictive markers. 
 
1.3.2a Preclinical evaluation of bortezomib in HL cells  Bortezomib demonstrated high antiproliferative activity by cell cycle arrest at the G2-M  
phase and induced apoptosis. These effect s were independent of mutations in Iκ Bα. Treatment 
with bortezomib activated the caspase cascade, increased p21 and Bax levels, decreased Bcl-2 
levels, and enhanced the effect of  gemcitabine (Zheng et al., 2004).

bortezomib on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle.  Patients had received a median of 4 prior 
treatment regimens and 93% of patients were pr eviously treated with ASCT. One patient who 
had received 9 prior treatments and had exte nsive pulmonary, splenic,  and nodal involvement 
achieved a PR and 2 patients had stable disease (SD). These results suggested low single-agent 
activity in heavily pretreated patients with simila r results seen in three other HL trials, but a 
combination treatment with chemotherapy was pl anned to evaluate activity in less heavily 
pretreated patients (Younes et al., 2006; Trelle et al., 2006; Blum et al., 2006; Stauss et al., 
2006). 
 1.3.2c Phase I study of bortezomib Plus ICE (BICE) for patients with             relapsed/re fractory classical HL (MDACC 2006-0527) 
 Combined therapies with bortezomib in myeloma and solid tumors have shown positive results, 
including with platinum-based chemotherapy (San Miguel et al., 2008;  Palumbo et al., 2007; 
Davies et al., 2004; Fanucchi et al., 2006). Thus we designed this clinical study to evaluate BICE 
as 2nd-line treatment for patients with relapsed /refractory HL. Bortezomib was given on Days 1 
and 4 and ICE was given on Days 1 to 3 with Neulasta given on Day 5. Dose levels of bortezomib were 0 = 1.0 mg/m2, 1 = 1.3 mg/m2, and 2 = 1.5 mg/m2. Cycles were repeated on 
Day 14 if ANC ≥ 1000 cells/m3 and platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/m3. After 3 cycles patients were 
evaluated for response by CTs and PET. Hematologic DLT was defined as grade 4 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia lasting greater than 14 days.  
 Median age of patients was 32 a nd 42% of patients had primary refractory disease. To date 12 
patients are evaluable for toxic ity and 12 patients for response.  By 1999 IWG response criteria 
there are 4/12 CR/CRu, 5/12 PR, and 3/12 progressive disease (P D). All patients with PD had 
primary refractory disease. PET scans post-treatm ent were negative for 9/12 patients (CR + PR 
1999 IWG response criteria patients). To date 8/9 patients have completed ASCT (1 patient declined ASCT). No 2nd phereses have been need ed for stem cell collec tion. Reversible grade 4 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in respectively 40% and 50%  of the patients. 
Median day for retreatment was Day 20 for cy cle 2 and Day 21 for cycle 3. There were no 
toxicities of peripheral neuropathy, febrile neut ropenia, or infection (Fanale et al., 2008).  
  1.3.2d Depletion of B cells from the microenviro nment improves efficacy of ABVD and EFS 
 Rituximab (R) depletes B cells from the micr oenvironment and R plus ABVD is believed to 
increases responses by decreasing survival factors that stimul ate RS cell growth. Of the 70 
patients enrolled in this front-line study 50% ha d stage II disease a nd 50% had stage III/IV 
disease. By the IPS model 55% had a score of 2 or higher. Rituximab was given weekly for the 
first 6 weeks to the standard dose and schedule of ABVD. R-ABVD improved EFS in all patients 
but had the highest benefit in t hose with IPS > 2 with an EFS of 77%. PET also became negative 
in 78% of patients after 2 to 3 cycles of R-ABVD which corresponded to a 5-year EFS of 93% 
for those who were PET negative and 75% for those who were PET positive (Wedgwood et al., 2007).

Serum samples were obtained in 93 healthy volu nteers and 50 patients with HL. ELISA was used 
to assess BLyS levels. Levels of BLyS in h ealthy volunteers had a medi an value of < 0.3 ng/mL 
and in newly diagnosed patients had a median  value of 2.0 ng/mL. Newly diagnosed patients 
who had a serum BLyS level of ≥ 2.0 ng/mL had shorter 2-year  PFS than those who had BLyS 
levels of < 2.0 ng/mL at respectively 64% versus 100% (Oki  et al., 2007).  
 1.3.2f Serum TARC levels decrease with cl inical responses to HDAC inhibition  
          in relapsed/refractory HL treatment  MGCD0103 is an oral histone deacetylase (HDAC) i nhibitor. In a phase II clinical study patients 
were treated with doses 3 times a week in 4 week cycles and serum TARC levels were 
determined by ELISA prior to starting treatmen t and on Day 8. Serum TARC levels decreased by 
at least 40% in 5 patients and all achieved res ponses of CR + PR. Thus, early decreases of TARC 
levels were shown to potentially predict response to treatment (Younes et al., 2007).

3.3 Study Treatments 
3.3.1 Clinical Trial Materials 
VELCADE (bortezomib) for Injec tion is a sterile lyophilized powde r for reconstitution and is 
supplied in vials containing VELCADE and mann itol at a 1:10 ratio.  For example, vials 
containing 3.5 mg of VELCADE contain 35 mg of mannitol.   
Ifosfamide, MESNA, Carboplatin, and Etoposid e are packaged and prepared per UT MD 
Anderson Cancer Center pharmacy’s standard operating procedures. 
3.3.2 Preparation, Handling, and Storage of Drugs 
Vials containing lyophilized VELCADE for Injecti on should be stored a ccording to the label 
requirements.  For the United States, store at USP Controlled Room Temperature which is 25ºC 
(77ºF); excursions permitted from 15 to 30ºC (59 to 86ºF).  For Europe, do not store above 30ºC 
(86ºF).  To date, stability data indicate that the lyophilized drug product is  stable for at least 18 
months when stored under the recommended conditions. Stability st udies are ongoing, and 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. will notify the investigator should this information be revised 
during the conduct of the study. 
VELCADE is cytotoxic.  As with all cytotoxi c drugs, caution is required when preparing and 
handling VELCADE solutions.  Cytotoxic drugs should only be handled  by staff specially 
trained in the safe handling of such preparations. The use of gloves and other appropriate 
protective clothing is recommended.  In case of skin contact, wa sh the affected area immediately

CONFIDENTIAL Page 36 and thoroughly with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  If product contacts eye, immediately 
flush eye thoroughly with water for at least 15 minutes.  Always contact a physician after any 
form of body contact. All materials that have b een used for preparation should be disposed of 
according to standard practices. A log must  be kept of all disposed materials. 
Drug is available in sterile, single use vials containing 3.5 mg of VELCADE.  Each vial of 
VELCADE for Injection should be reconstituted under a laminar flow biological cabinet (hood) 
within eight hours before dosing with 3.5 mL of normal (0.9%) saline, Sodium Chloride 
Injection USP, so that the reconstituted solution contains VELCADE at a concentration of 1 mg/mL.  Prior to reconstitution the vials should  remain in the cartons to protect them from 
light.  Dissolution is completed in approximately  10 seconds.  The reconstituted solution is clear 
and colorless, with a final pH of 5 to 6.  Reconstituted VELCADE should be administered 
promptly and in no case more than 8 hours after reconstituti on.  All materials that have been used 
for preparation should be disposed of according to standard practices.  A log must be kept of all 
disposed materials. 
Ifosfamide, MESNA, Carboplatin, and Etoposide ar e prepared, handled, an d stored per UT MD 
Anderson Cancer Center pharmacy’s standard operating procedures. 
3.3.3 Drug Administration and Dosage Schedule 
Drug will be administered only to eligible pa tients under the supervision of the principal 
investigator or identified sub-investigator(s). Treatment will be delivered in the hospital under 
the supervision of the principal investigator or  a sub-investigator.  The pharmacist will prepare 
the drug under aseptic conditions.  The amount (in mg) of drug to  be administered will be 
determined based on body surface area.  Body surface area is to be calculated based on body 
weight using a standard nomogram (see secti on 0). For patients with a calculated BSA of ≥ 2.1 
m
2 use of adjusted body weight for drug dosing (see section 8.3) can be co nsidered to calculate 
an adjusted BSA.  The dose should be calculate d on Day 1 of each cycle; the dose administered 
should remain the same throughout each cycle but s hould be recalculated at the start of the next 
cycle.    The appropriate amount of VELCADE will be drawn from the injec tion vial and administered as 
an intravenous (IV) push over 5 seconds followed by a standard saline flush or through a running IV line.  Vials are for si ngle use administration.

Before each drug dose, the patient will be eval uated for possible toxicities that may have 
occurred after the previous dose(s).  Toxicities  are to be assessed according to the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (C TCAE), Version 3.0 (see section 0).

ADL = activities of daily living 
Note: If the VELCADE dose has been reduced to 1.3 mg/m2/dose during prior cycle secondary to  these dose reduction guidelines 
then if patient has grade 2 or less peripheral neuropathy at retreatment the dose leve l should remain at 1.3 mg/m2/dose  
The neurotoxicity-directed quest ionnaire (see section 8.7) is an  optional but useful tool for 
determining the presence and inte nsity of peripheral neuropathy from the patient’s perspective.  
Neuropathic symptoms are more prominent than  abnormalities on the clinical examination.   
 
 
3.3.4a Cycles of treatment and retreatment criteria 
 Patients will be eligible for retreatment every 14 days if below criteria are met: 
 
 1) Laboratory criteria:
 a) absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/μL, b)    
 platelet count ≥ 90,000/ μL,  c) serum bilirubin < 2.0      
 mg/dL, e) alkaline phosphatase < 2 x upper limits of normal (ULN),    
 f) AST and ALT < 2 x ULN, and g) serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL.  
  2) Clinical criteria:
 a) peripheral neuropathy of grad e 2 or less, b) lack of a   
 grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic, non-nephr ologic, or non-hepatic toxicity

CONFIDENTIAL Page 39 A number of measures will be taken to ensure the sa fety of patients participating in this clinical 
treatment protocol. In the phase I (MDACC 2006-0527) no hematologic or non-hematologic 
dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were noted for bortezomib given at the maximum dose of 1.5 
mg/m2 on Days 1 and 4 in combination with st andard ICE chemothera py (see section 1.3.2c and 
Fanale et al., 2008).These include the patient el igibility criteria (see s ection 3.2) and scheduled 
monitoring. Patients enrolled in this study will be evaluated clinically with standard laboratory 
tests before and during their partic ipation in this study (see secti on 3.1). Safety evaluations will 
consist of medical interviews , recording of adverse events, physical examinations, blood 
pressure, and laboratory measurements. Subjects  will be evaluated for adverse events (all 
grades), serious adverse events, and advers e events requiring st udy drug interruption or 
discontinuation at each study visit for the dur ation of their partic ipation in the study. 
 
1) Bortezomib:  In the phase I (MDACC 2006-0527) no hematologic or non-hematologic 
dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were noted for bortezomib given at the maximum dose of 1.5 mg/m
2 on Days 1 and 4 chemotherapy (see s ection 1.3.2c and Fanale et al., 2008). 
Any patient who experiences a Common Term inology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 
(CTAE) of a grade 3 peripheral neuropathy th at does not resolve to grade 2 peripheral 
neuropathy by time of retreatment, grade 4 pe ripheral neuropathy, or a grade 3 to 4 non-
hematologic toxicity that is attributed to  bortezomib will be removed from the study. For 
patients who have grade 2 peri pheral neuropathy at retreatmen t dose should be reduced to 
bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 (see Table 5). Patients will need to meet laboratory criteria for 
retreatment (see section 3.3.4a). Patients who experience a grade 4 thrombocytopenia or 
neutropenia for greater than 2 week s will be removed from the study.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 44 4 ADVERSE EVENTS 
4.1 Definitions 
4.1.1 Adverse Event Definition 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occu rrence in a patient administered a 
pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have  a causal relationship with the treatment.  
An adverse event can be any unfavorable a nd unintended sign (eg, including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of the drug, whether 
or not it is considered to be drug related.  This includes any ne wly occurring event or previous 
condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the ad ministration of drug. 
4.1.2 Serious Adverse Event Definition 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any adverse event, occu rring at any dose and regardless of 
causality that: 
• Results in death . 
• Is life-threatening.  Life-threatening means that the patient was at immediate risk of 
death from the reaction as it occurred, i. e., it does not include a reaction which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form. 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
Hospitalization admissions and/or surgical ope rations scheduled to occur during the study 
period, but planned prior to st udy entry are not considered AE s if the illness or disease 
existed before the patient was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in 
an unexpected manner during the trial (eg, su rgery performed earli er than planned). 
• Results in persistent or significan t disability/incapacity .  Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a persons’ ab ility to conduct normal life functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event.  An important medical even t is an event that may not 
result in death, be life-threatening, or requi re hospitalization but ma y be considered an 
SAE when, based upon appropriate  medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in the definitions for SAEs.  Examples  of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in  an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hos pitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.   
 
Clarification should be made between the term s “serious” and “severe” since they ARE NOT 
synonymous.  The term
 “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (s everity) of a specific 
event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be 
of relatively minor medical sign ificance (such as a severe headache).  This is NOT the same as 
“serious,” which is based on patient/event outco me or action criteria described above and are 
usually associated with events th at pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning.  A severe 
adverse event does not necessarily n eed to be considered serious.  For example, persistent nausea

Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  12/18/2008 
VELCADE IIS Protocol Template MAF 6.30.2010 F 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 45 of several hours duration may be considered severe nausea but not an SAE.  On the other hand, a 
stroke resulting in only a minor degree of disa bility may be considered mild, but would be 
defined as an SAE based on the above noted criteria .  Seriousness (not seve rity) serves as a guide 
for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
4.2 Procedures for AE and SAE Reporting 
Investigator-sponsor must report all (SAE) rega rdless of relationship with any study drug or 
expectedness to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (o r designee) as soon as possible, but no later 
than 5 calendar days of the investigator-sponsor’s  observation or awareness of the event.  All 
sub-investigators must report all SAEs to the in vestigator-sponsor so that the investigator-
sponsor can meet his/her foregoing reporting obligations to Mill ennium Pharmacovigilance.  
Investigator-sponsor must also  provide Millennium Pharmac ovigilance with a copy of all 
communications related to the St udy or Drug with the applicable regulatory aut hority, including, 
but not limited to, telephone conversation logs, as soon as possibl e but no later than 5 calendar 
days of that communication.  
Millennium Pharmacovigilance will send to the investigator-sponsor a monthly listing of the 
SAE reports received for SAE verification.  Investigator-sponsor will be responsible for 
forwarding such reports to any sub-inves tigator(s) and providing any follow-up safety 
information requested by Millennium Pharmacovigilance.

Hotline number (24/7): +1 (800) 201-8725 
 
For both serious and non-serious adverse events, the investigator or su b-investigator must 
determine both the intensity of the event and the relationship of the event to drug administration.  
 Relationship  to drug administration will be determined by the investigator or sub-investigator 
responding yes or no to the question:  Is there a reasonable possibili ty that the adverse event is 
associated with the drug? 
Intensity for each adverse event, including any lab a bnormality, will be determined by using the 
NCI CTCAE, version 3.0, as a guide line, wherever possible.  The cr iteria are available online at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov /reporting/ctc.html
.  
 4.3 Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation 
Adverse events, both serious and non-serious, an d deaths that occur dur ing the patient’s study 
participation will be recorded in  the source documents.  All SAEs should be monitored until they 
are resolved or are clearly determined to be due  to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or 
intercurrent illness(es).

4.4 Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposu re During Pregnancy and Birth Events 
If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects she is pregnant while particip ating in this study, she 
must inform her treating physic ian immediately and permanently discontinue drug therapy.  All 
pregnancies and suspected pregnancies must also  be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance 
(or designee, see section 4.2) immediately.    Th e pregnancy must be followed through outcome 
(i.e. delivery, still birth, miscarriage).  
If a female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during the male s ubject’s participation in 
this study, Millennium Pharmacovigilance must be contacted immediately.  Every effort should be made to follow the pregnancy for the final pregnancy outcome.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 47 5   STATISTICAL PROCEDURES 
5.1  Bayesian Adaptive Algorithm 
The phase II part of this study is to compare ICE only and BI CE in treating patients with 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma.  The primary outcome is complete remission.  The estimated 
accrual rate is 2 or 4 patients per month.   A maximum of  50 patients will be accrued.  Patients 
will be evaluated for response after 0.75 months af ter receiving treatment for 3 cycles (21 days 
per cycle).  The patients will be randomized between ICE and BICE arms using a Bayesian 
adaptive algorithm (Berry and Eick,, 1995).  In general, the trial will proceed as follows: The initial 20 patients will be randomized fairly w ith probability of 0.50 each between the two arms, 
so that the number of patients in each arm is equal at  the start of the trial.  Thereafter, as the trial 
proceeds patients will be randomized to the two gr oups with unequal probabilities in favor of the 
treatment that, on average, yields better response rate.  Consequently, each successive patient is 
more likely to receive the treatment with a bette r response rate, on average.  The details of the 
adaptive randomization scheme are as follows: 
Denote the response rate at each of  the two treatment arms by { π
1, π2} (1 for ICE, 2 for BICE).  
Based on the currently available da ta, we assume the prior distri bution for the response rate is π1 
~ Beta (0.5, 0.5) and  π
2 ~ Beta (0.6, 0.4), respectively.  The resulting prior mean (95% credible 
interval) for ICE and BICE are 0.5(0.002, 0.99) and 0.6(0.007, 0.99), respective 
ely.  After the initial first 20 patients being randomized to two treatment groups with an equal 
probability, each new patient will be randomized to receive treatment i with probability 
ρi=prob(πi > πj, j ≠i| Data), i, j=1,2.  If one of these two randomization probabilities falls below 
0.025 then that arm will be dr opped.  In addition, if prob( πi > 0.25|data) < 0.05, i.e. the data 
indicates that the response rate in  that arm is highly unlikely to be larger than 0.25, then that arm 
will be dropped.  On the other hand, if one of  the two randomization probabilities exceeds 0.975 
then the trial will be terminated and that treatment  arm will be selected.  If the trial does not stop 
early and the maximum 50 patients are accrued, a treatment is selected as being “better” if the 
probability that one treatment’s response rate is larger than the other’s response rate exceeds 
0.95.   Table 8 below summarizes opera ting characteristics of the design based on an accrual of 50 
patients, and shows the results when the numbe r of patients accrued per month are 2. The 
number of patients treated (and evaluated) row is the average number of patients treated on a 
given arm under the given scenario.  The calcu lations were done from 1,000 simulations.

The trial will be conducted using a website devel oped in the Division of Quantitative Sciences at 
UT MD Anderson Cancer Center . Through the web interface, which is ideal for a multicenter 
trial, the users can randomize patients and update la st evaluation date and current patient status. 
When a patient is randomized, the calculations ar e based on all available data entered into the 
website. The results of the randomization are displa yed to the screen for the user to view. All 
data will be stored in a secure  SQL server database.  In addition, safety monitoring will also be 
performed in conjunction with the MDA CC Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).    
 5.2  Efficacy Analysis  In addition, response rates based on 1999 IWG (C heson et al., 1999) versus 2007 IWG (Cheson 
et al., 2007) criteria will also be summarized  for each treatment group (see section 3.6.1). 
Response rate improvement by PET scan assessment will also be described for patients with PR based on IWG 1999 criteria but who by IWG 2007 crit eria are found to be in CR because of PET 
scan negativity in residual masses.  5.3 Correlative TNF and TARC Se rum Protein Level Analysis 
 Furthermore, serum levels of TNF proteins (APRIL, BLyS, sCD30, and CD40L) and TARC as determined at baseline compared to post-treatmen t with will be analyzed  for both the BICE and 
ICE treatment groups by Mann-Whitney U test. Second, serum levels for each protein as determined at baseline compared to post-treatmen t will be analyzed for both the BICE and ICE 
treatment groups according to response rates as determined by IWG 1999 response criteria (CR, PR, SD, versus PD) by the Kruskal-Wallis test . Third, serum levels for each protein as 
determined at baseline compared to post-treatmen t will be analyzed for both the BICE and ICE 
treatment groups according to PET scan results (PET negative versus PET positive) at completion of therapy by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Significance will be set for p ≤ 0.05.

approval /favorable opinion of the IRB/IEC.  The investigator will submit all protocol 
modifications to Millennium and the regulatory au thority(ies) in accordance with the governing 
regulations.  
Any departures from the protocol must be fu lly documented in the source documents.   
6.6  On-site Audits 
Regulatory authorities, the IEC/I RB and/or Millennium’s clini cal quality assurance group may 
request access to all source documents, data capt ure records, and other study documentation for 
on-site audit or inspection.  Direct access to  these documents must be guaranteed by the 
investigator, who must pr ovide support at all times for these activities. 
6.7  Drug Accountability Accountability for the drug at all study sites is the res ponsibility of the principal investigator.  
The investigator will ensure that the drug is us ed only in accordance with  this protocol.  Drug 
accountability records indicating the drug’s delivery date to the site (if applicable), inventory at 
the site (if applicable), use by each patient, and re turn to Millennium or disposal of the drug (if 
applicable and if approved by Millennium) will be maintained by the clinical site.  
Accountability records will incl ude dates, quantities, lot numbers, expiration dates (if 
applicable), and patient numbers.    All material containing VELCADE will be trea ted and disposed of as hazardous waste in 
accordance with governing regulations. 
6.8  Premature Closure of the Study This study may be prematurely terminated, if in the opinion of the inves tigator or Millennium, 
there is sufficient reasonable cause.  Writte n notification documenting the reason for study 
termination will be provided to the investigator  or Millennium by the terminating party.   
Circumstances that may warrant termin ation include, but are not limited to: 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients 
• Failure to enter patients at an acceptable rate 
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements 
• Insufficient complete and/or evaluable data 
• Plans to modify, suspend or discon tinue the development of the drug 
Should the study be closed prematurely, all stud y materials must be returned to Millennium. 
6.9  Record Retention The investigator will maintain all study records according to ICH-GCP an d applicable regulatory 
requirement(s).

Body surface area (BSA) should be calculated us ing a standard nomogram that yields the 
following results in meters squared (m2): 
 
 
 
    
 Creatinine clearance (CrCl) can be calculated using the Cockroft-Gau lt equation as follows: 
 CrCl (ml/min) =  (140-age) (actua l wt in kg)             
  
      72 x serum creatinine (mg/dl) For females use 85% of calculated CrCl value. Note: In markedly obese patients, the Cockro ft-Gault formula will tend to overestimate the 
creatinine clearance. (Adipose tissue tends to contribute little creat inine requiring renal 
clearance.) 
 Body Surface Area:  
BSA(m
2): ( ( ht(cm) * wt(kg) ) / 3600 )1/2 
Ideal Body Weight For Drug Dosing: 
Males(kg): 50 + 2.3*(ht(in)-(60 in)) 
Females(kg): 45.5 + 2.3*(ht(in)-(60 in)) 
Adjusted Body Weight For Drug Dosing: 
ABW(kg): IBW(kg) + 0.4*(wt(kg)-IBW(kg))

World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki: 
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects 
Adopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly Helsinki, Finland, June 1964 and amended by 
the 29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 1975 35th WMA General Assembly, 
Venice, Italy, October 1983 41st WMA Genera l Assembly, Hong Kong, September 1989 48th 
WMA General Assembly, Somerset West, Republic of South Africa, October 1996 and the 
52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000 
A. INTRODUCTION 
1. The World Medical Association ha s developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of 
ethical principles to provid e guidance to physicians and ot her participants in medical 
research involving human subjects.  Medica l research involving human subjects includes 
research on identifiable human material or identifiable data. 
2. It is the duty of the physicia n to promote and safeguard the health of the people.  The 
physician's knowledge and conscience are dedi cated to the fulfillment of this duty. 
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medi cal Association binds the physician with the 
words, "The health of my patient will be my first consideration," and the International Code 
of Medical Ethics declares th at, "A physician shall act only in  the patient's interest when 
providing medical care which might have the e ffect of weakening the physical and mental 
condition of the patient." 
4. Medical progress is based on research which ultim ately must rest in pa rt on experimentation 
involving human subjects. 
5. In medical research on human subjects, consid erations related to the well-being of the 
human subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society. 
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve 
prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedur es and the understand ing of the aetiology 
and pathogenesis of disease.  Even the best proven prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic 
methods must continuously be  challenged through research for their effectiveness, 
efficiency, accessibility and quality. 
7. In current medical practice and in medical  research, most prophyl actic, diagnostic and 
therapeutic procedures i nvolve risks and burdens. 
8. Medical research is subject to  ethical standards that promot e respect for all human beings 
and protect their health and rights.  Some research populations are vulnerable and need 
special protection.  The particular needs of the economically and medically disadvantaged 
must be recognized.  Special attention is also required for those who cannot give or refuse 
consent for themselves, for those who may be subject to giving consent under duress, for

CONFIDENTIAL page 64 those who will not benefit personally from the research and for those for whom the research 
is combined with care. 
9. Research Investigators should be aware of the ethical, le gal and regulatory requirements for 
research on human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international requirements.  No national ethical, legal or  regulatory requirement should be allowed to 
reduce or eliminate any of the protections for human subjects set forth in this Declaration. 
B. BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH 
1. It is the duty of the physician in medical research to protect the lif e, health, privacy, and 
dignity of the human subject. 
2. Medical research involving human subjects must  conform to generally  accepted scientific 
principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literat ure, other relevant 
sources of information, and on adequate laboratory and, where appropriate, animal 
experimentation. 
3. Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of research which may affect the 
environment, and the welfare of animals used for research must be respected. 
4. The design and performance of each experi mental procedure involving human subjects 
should be clearly formulated in an experimental  protocol.  This protocol should be submitted 
for consideration, comment, guidance, and wh ere appropriate, approval to a specially 
appointed ethical review committee, which must  be independent of the investigator, the 
sponsor or any other kind of undue influence.  This independent committee should be in conformity with the laws and re gulations of the country in whic h the research experiment is 
performed.  The committee has the right to m onitor ongoing trials.  The researcher has the 
obligation to provide monitoring information to the committee, especially any serious 
adverse events.  The researcher should also submit to the committee, for review, information 
regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, other potential conflicts of interest and incentives for subjects. 
5. The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations 
involved and should indicate that there is compli ance with the principles enunciated in this 
Declaration. 
6. Medical research involving human subjects should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons and under the supervision of a clinically competent medical person.  The 
responsibility for the human subject must always rest with a medica lly qualified person and 
never rest on the subject of the researc h, even though the subject has given consent. 
7. Every medical research projec t involving human subjects shou ld be preceded by careful 
assessment of predictable risks and burdens in comparison with foreseeable benefits to the subject or to others.  This does not preclude the participation of healthy volunteers in 
medical research.  The design of all st udies should be publicly available. 
8. Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subjects

CONFIDENTIAL page 65 unless they are confident that the risks involved have been ad equately assessed and can be 
satisfactorily managed.  Physic ians should cease any investiga tion if the risks are found to 
outweigh the potential benefits or if there is  conclusive proof of positive and beneficial 
results. 
9. Medical research involving human subjects shou ld only be conducted if the importance of 
the objective outweighs the inhere nt risks and burdens to the s ubject.  This is especially 
important when the human subjects are healthy volunteers. 
10. Medical research is only justified if there is a reasonable lik elihood that the populations in 
which the research is carried out stand to benefit from the results of the research. 
11. The subjects must be volunteers and informed  participants in the research project. 
12. The right of research subjects to safeguard thei r integrity must always be respected.  Every 
precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of the subject, the c onfidentiality of the 
patient's information and to minimize the imp act of the study on the subject's physical and 
mental integrity and on the personality of the subject. 
13. In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the 
aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible c onflicts of interest, in stitutional affiliations 
of the researcher, the anticipated benefits a nd potential risks of the study and the discomfort 
it may entail.  The subject should be informed of  the right to abstain from participation in 
the study or to withdraw consent to participat e at any time without reprisal.  After ensuring 
that the subject has underst ood the information, the physic ian should then obtain the 
subject's freely-given informed consent, prefer ably in writing.  If the consent cannot be 
obtained in writing, the non-written consent must  be formally documented and witnessed. 
14. When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be 
particularly cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship w ith the physician or may 
consent under duress.  In that case the in formed consent should be obtained by a well-
informed physician who is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely 
independent of this relationship. 
15. For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically  or mentally incapable of 
giving consent or is a legally incompetent mi nor, the investigator must obtain informed 
consent from the legally authorized representative in accordance with applicable law.  These groups should not be included in research unle ss the research is necessary to promote the 
health of the population represented and this re search cannot instead be performed on legally 
competent persons. 
16. When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give assent to 
decisions about participation in research, the investigator must obtain that assent in addition 
to the consent of the legally authorized representative. 
17. Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtai n consent, including proxy or 
advance consent, should be done only if th e physical/mental condi tion that prevents 
obtaining informed consent is a necessary char acteristic of the rese arch population.  The

VELCADE IIS Protocol Template MAF 6.30.2010 F 
CONFIDENTIAL page 66 specific reasons for involving rese arch subjects with a conditi on that renders them unable to 
give informed consent should be stated in th e experimental protocol  for consideration and 
approval of the review committee.  The protocol  should state that consent to remain in the 
research should be obtained as soon as possibl e from the individual or a legally authorized 
surrogate. 
18. Both authors and publishers ha ve ethical obligations.  In publication of the results of 
research, the investigators are obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results.  Negative as 
well as positive results should be published or otherwise publicly available.  Sources of 
funding, institutional affiliations a nd any possible conflicts of inte rest should be declared in 
the publication.  Reports of experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down 
in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication. 
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH MEDICAL CARE 
1. The physician may combine medical research with  medical care, only to the extent that the 
research is justified by its potential prophylac tic, diagnostic or therapeutic value.  When 
medical research is combined with medical care, additional st andards apply to protect the 
patients who are research subjects. 
2. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new me thod should be tested against 
those of the best current pr ophylactic, diagnostic, and therap eutic methods.  This does not 
exclude the use of placebo, or no treatmen t, in studies where no proven prophylactic, 
diagnostic or therapeutic method exists. 
3. At the conclusion of the study, every patient entered into the study should be assured of 
access to the best proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods identified by the study. 
4. The physician should fully inform the patient wh ich aspects of the care are related to the 
research.  The refusal of a patient to partic ipate in a study must never interfere with the 
patient-physician relationship. 
5. In the treatment of a patient, where proven prophylactic, diagnostic and ther apeutic methods 
do not exist or have been ine ffective, the physician, with informed consent from the patient, 
must be free to use unproven or new prophylactic,  diagnostic and therapeutic measures, if in 
the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing he alth or alleviating 
suffering.  Where possible, these measures shou ld be made the object of research, designed 
to evaluate their safety and efficacy.  In all cases, new information should be recorded and, 
where appropriate, published.  The other relevant  guidelines of this Declaration should be 
followed.

protocol, whichever occurs first. When the subject develops 
disease progr ession that conforms to the definition by RECIST 
v1.1 according to the investigator's assessment, and BIRC also 
confirms the disease progression (according to RECIST v1.1), if the investigator assesses that the subject still has clinical benefit and is tol erated to study treatment, subject will continue SHR -

BIRC- confirmed disease progression (according to RECIST 
v1.1) will also continue wi th regular follow -up by tumor 
radiological  assessments after treatment is completed. If the 
subject withdraws the informed consent before BIRC confirms the disease progression according to the RECIST v1.1 c riteria or

tumor treatment has 
begun (except for traditional Chinese medicine) , or the subject 
dies, there is no need to continue the radiological  evaluation. If 
the subject does not meet the above criteria for sto pping

 9  Subjects will receive study treatment after being informed of 
all pertinent aspects of the study, signing the informed consent 
form and passing the screening  for eligibility . Experimental 
arm: SHR -1210, 200 mg, via intravenous infusion, once every 
two weeks (Q2W) + rivoceranib  250 mg, p.o., once per day 
(QD), continuously, 4 weeks (28 days) per cycle of therapy . 
Control arm : sorafenib, 400 mg, p.o., twice per day (BID), 
4 weeks ( 28 days ) per cycle of therapy. Study treatment will 
contin ue until the subject develops an intolerable toxicity, 
withdrawing informed consent, disease progression confirmed 
by BIRC according to RECIST v1.1 (when the subject has 
disease progression assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, the investi gator must submit the radiological  
data to BIRC immediately. If BIRC evaluates it as non -disease 
progression according to RECIST v1.1, the subject should 
continue to receive the study drug treatment and continue the tumor radiological  evaluation; if BIRC c onfirms it as disease 
progression based on RECIST v1.1, the investigator needs to 
assess whether the subject still has clinical benefit. If the 
subject is considered to still have clinical benefit and meet s the 
criteria for continuing treatment beyond the disease progresses 
[see Section  6.6 for details ], the subject may continue to receive 
study treatment ; if the subject is no longer considered to have 
clinical benefit, the treatment should be discontinued) or other 
discontinuat ion criteria specified in the protocol, whichever 
occurs first.  Upon approval of Protocol v6.0, disease 
progression will not be evaluated by  BIRC anymore , and will 
only be confirmed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1.  
Subjects will have safety visits on D1 and D15 of each cycle of therapy within the first 3 cycles for both arms. From Cycle 4 
onwards, subjects will have safety visits on D1 and D15 of each 
cycle in the experimental arm , and on D1 of each cyc le in the 
control arm ; refer to the SCHEDULE OF ACTIVITI ES for 
details .
 Subjects will continu e to have  safety follow -up and 
survival follow -up after the study treatment  discontinuation. 
Tumor r adiological examination will be performed once every 
8 weeks to evaluate efficacy for the first 48 weeks from 
randomization, and once every 12 weeks thereafter. During the 
study period, radiological examination and evaluation can be 
added at any time if cl inically indicated. Tumor radiological  
assessment will continue until the occurrence of disease 
progression confirmed by BIRC according to RECIST v1.1 
criteria or treatment  discontinuation , whichever occurs later. 
Subjects who discontinue  treatment for reasons other than 
BIRC- confirmed disease progression (according to RECIST 
v1.1) will also continue with  regular follow -up by tumor 
radiological  assessments after study treatment is discontinued.

 10  Before BIRC confirms the disease progression according to the 
RECIST v1.1 criteria or the study treatment is discontinued, i f 
the subject withdraws the informed consent, other anti -tumor 
treatment has begun (except for traditional  Chinese medicine) , 
or the subject dies, there is no need to continue the radiological  
evaluation. If the subject does not meet the above criteria for 
stopping  radiological  assessment , the efficacy evaluation of the 
three efficacy evaluation criteria (RECIST v1.1, mRECIST, 
imRECIST) needs to continue even if the disease progression 
under ce rtain efficacy evaluation criteria occurs.  
The study extension phase will be initiated when suffi cient 
follow up is completed and the study is ended (at least 2 years 
follow up of the last subject  randomiz ed). The purpose of the 
extension phase is to continue to provide access to  study drugs 
for subjects who are still on study treatment and still derive 
clinical  benefit at the time of study  closure . Upon initiation of 
the extension phase, the Sponsor considers the safety and 
efficacy profile of the experimental treatment regimen within 
this study to have been sufficiently established and data 
analysis required for regulatory purposes have been completed. 
The study will establish a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to regularly monitor  safety of the subjects on a periodic basis 
and evaluate efficacy and safety data at the time of PFS 
analysis and OS interim analysis . The DMC  will make 
recommendations for continuing, revising  or terminating the 
study based on observed safety or efficacy data. The composition, responsibilities, operation and management of 
the DMC will be detailed  in a separate DMC charter.

On days of rivoceranib PK blood collection (Day 1 of 
Cycle 1 -4: C1D1, C2D1, C3D1 and C4D1), it is 
necessary to administer  rivoceranib  first at the study 
center , followed by  SHR -1210 administration. For 
specific information, refer to the SCH EDULE OF 
ACTIVITIES  and BLOOD SAMPLE COLLECTION 
TABLE . 
Control Arm:  
Sorafenib 400 mg is administered orally under fasted state (at least 1 h our prior to meal or 2 hours  after meal), 
twice per day, continuously.  
One treatment cycle is 4 weeks (28 days).  
If a subject in the experimental arm ( SHR -1210 in combination 
with rivoceranib ) develops  a treatment -related AE that lead s to 
permanent discontinuation of rivoceranib and the investigator 
determines that the subject can benefit from SHR -1210 as 
monotherapy, the subject is allowed to continue to receiv e 
SHR -1210 monotherapy until the criteria for study treatment 
discontinuation as specified  in the protocol  has been met , and 
vice versa. In addition, during the study treatment period, if a 
subject in the experimental arm develop s a treatment -related 
AE that lead s to temporar y discontinuation of  SHR -1210 or 
rivoceranib , the subject may continue to receive monotherapy . 
The combination therapy can be r esumed  only after the 
treatment -related toxicity resolves . 
Subjects continue to receive study treatment until intolerable toxicity occurs, withdraw al of 
informed consent, disease 
progression confirmed by BIRC according to RECIST v1.1 and 
lack of clinical benefits as determined by investigator after 
comprehensive evaluation of radiological and laboratory 
examination data as well as the subject ’s clinical co ndition 
(e.g., tumor symptomatic exacerbation) or other 
discontinuation criteria specified in the protocol, whichever 
comes first.  Upon approval of protocol V6.0, disease 
progression will only need to be confirmed by investigator per RECIST v1.1.  
When a su bject develops disease progression that conforms to 
the definition of RECIST v1.1 according to the investigator's assessment, and BIRC also confirms that disease progression (according to RECIST v1.1), subject may continue treatment 
with SHR -1210 monothera py or in 
combination with 
rivoceranib  (experimental arm) or sorafenib (control arm) , if 
the subject still has  clinical benefit and can tolerate study 
treatment as determined by investigator  (see Section  6.6 for 
treatment criteria after  disease progression ).

PK And 
Immunogenicity 
Sampling  Immunogenicity and PK measurement will be assessed in the 
experimental arm only.  
Pre-dose sampling: blood sample s will be collected once within 
0.5 hours  prior to rivoceranib administration on Day 1 from 
Cycle 1 to Cycle 4 (C1D1, C2D1, C3D1, C4D1); and collected 
once within 0.5 hours  prior to rivoceranib  administration on 
Day 1 of every 3 cycles afterwards. A blood sample will be 
collect ed 30 days (±7 days) after the last administration of 
SHR -1210. When SHR -1210 is interrupted for longer than 30 
days and finally is confirmed to be unable to resume, subjec ts 
are required to return  for a site visit as early  as possible for a 
blood sample  to be collected . If the subject has star ted other 
anti-tumor therapy, it ’s not necessary to collect the 
immunogenicity blood sample at 30 days (±7 days) after the last administration of SHR -1210. If SHR -
1210 and/or 
rivoceranib is tempora rily interrupted, pre -dose 
immunogenicity and PK sample will be collected on schedule . 
If only rivoceranib is temporarily interrupted at the sampling 
time above , and the blood sample should be  collected within 
0.5 hours  before the administration of SHR -1210. The above 
samples will be used  to measure the blood concentration and 
immunogenicity of SHR -1210, and the plasma concentration of 
rivoceranib  in the C2D1- C4D1 samples . The exact time of the 
previous administration of rivoceranib (as provided by the 
subject) will be collected for C2D1, C3D1 and C4D1. 
ECG  blood sampling : ECG examination  will be  performed 2.5 
hours  (±1 h our) after the end of the rivoceranib administration, 
and blood will be collected within 15 min utes after the ECG 
examination  on the first day from C1 to C4. If rivoceranib is 
interrupted, blood samples within 15 minutes of ECG will not be collected. The samples above will be detected for the 
concentrations of rivoceranib only.  
The actual sampling time, the actual administration time of 
SHR -1210 and rivoceranib will be recorded on the day of 
sampling . Pre-dose sampling and ECG blood sampling will not 
be performed in the extension phase  (refer t o BLOOD

Discontinuation  subject withdrawal from the study. Subjects who discontinue 
the study treatment should complete  the remaining study visits 
as required in the protocol. Subjects should discontinue  study 
treatment when any of the following conditions occurs:  
 Subject requests discontinuation of study treatment;  
 Efficacy evaluation me ets disease progression criteria 
confirmed by BIRC  (according to RECIST v1.1)  
(disease progression will be confirmed by  the 
investigator per RECIST v1.1 u pon approval of 
Protocol v6.0)  unless investigator judges that  the 
subject will continue to benefit from the treatment and 
the criteria for treatment beyond progression is met  
(see Section  6.6 of the protocol);  
 Pregnancy in female subject occurs during the study;  
 Unacceptable toxicity despite dose modification, or 
occurrence of adverse event, abnormal laboratory 
examination, or concomitant diseases, then  it is no 
longer in the best interests of the subjects to continue 
study treatment according to the judgment of the 
investigator;  
 Overall deterioration of health status, inability to 
continue participation in the trial;  
 Significant protocol deviation or violations confirmed

to imprisonment or  segregation ;  
 Lost to follow -up;  
 Termination of study by the sponsor.  
Criteria f or Study 
Termination  The criteria for termination of this study include but not 
limited to the following:

 20  Safety Evaluation  The severity of adverse events will be judged in accordance 
with CTCAE v 4.03. Adverse event (AE) record forms should 
be filled out during the trial, including the occurrence time, 
severity, relationship with the study drug, duration, measures 
taken and outcome  of the AE.  
Efficacy 
Evaluation  To evaluate OS ( co-primary efficacy endpoint), subjects after 
study treatment discontinued will have their survival status 
collected through site visits or telephone follow -up on a regular 
basis until death. Subject who died during the trial, their actual 
time of death will be recorded . 
PFS: defined as the time from the date of randomization to the 
first occurrence of radiological  progression or death, whichever 
comes first.  Evaluat ions of  PFS (another  primary efficacy 
endpoint) as well as TTP, ORR , DCR  and DoR  (secondary  or 
exploratory  efficacy endpoints)  will be performed based on 
RECIST v1.1, mRECIST and imRECIST : From randomization 
to 48 weeks, the radiological evaluation will be performed once 
every 8 weeks; once every 12 weeks thereafter; and can be 
performed in a real -time manner if new lesion is suspected; the 
tumor response must be confi rmed in 4 weeks or at  next 
scheduled timepoint for the subjects who are initially  evaluated 
as PR/CR. When  suspected clinical progression occurs, 
physical examination and confirmation by radiological  
evaluation should be performed as soon as possible , rather than 
waiting until the next scheduled imaging examination . 
When  progression of disease is confirmed by investigator 
according to RECIST v1.1, the investigator must submit the 
radiological  data to BIRC immediately  for evaluation of 
disease progression . If BIRC confirms non disease progression 
according to RECIST v1.1, the subject  should continue with 
study  treatment and tumor radiological  evaluation; if BIRC 
confirms as disease progression according to RECIST V1.1, the 
investigator should evaluate whether the subject  still has 
clinical benefit , if the subject is considered to have  clinical 
benefit from study treatment and meet  criteria for continuation 
of treatment after the disease progresses (see Secti on 6.6 for 
details) , the subject may continue  study treatment and efficacy 
assessment as originally scheduled.  
Tumor radiological assessment should continue until disease 
progression confirmed by BIRC according to RECIST v1.1 or 
treatment  discontinuation, whichever occurs later. Subjects 
who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than BIRC -
confirmed disease progression (according to RECIST v1.1) must continue with their regular follow -up tumor radiological  
assessments.  Prior to BIRC confirm ed 
disease progression 
according to the RECIST v1.1 or discontinuation of study  
treatment,  if the subject has withdraw n informed consent,

 21  started other anti -tumor treatment (except for traditional  
Chinese medicine) , or subject died , no further  imaging 
assessment is required . If subject does not meet the above 
criteria for stop ping radiological  assessment , tumor efficacy 
evaluation of the three efficacy evaluation criteria (RECIST 
v1.1, mRECIST, imRECIST) needs to continue even if the 
disease progression under certain efficacy evaluation criteria 
occurs.  
Upon approval of Protocol v6.0, disease progression will be  
confirmed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1 , and tumor 
assessments evaluated by BIRC per mRECIST will not be 
performed afterwards.  If the investigator confirms non- disease 
progression, the subject should continue on study treatment and 
tumor radiologica l evaluation as required ; if the investigator 
confirms as disease progression, the subject may continue to receive study treatment after disease progression 
at the 
investigator ’s discretion  (see Section 6.6). 
Sample Size Determination  Assuming a 1:1 randomization between sorafenib and SHR -
1210+ rivoceranib, and a median PFS time of 3.6 months for 
subjects in the sorafenib group and a median PFS of 6 months 
for a subject  in the combination group, 332 PFS events will be 
sufficient to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.60 with 98% power based on Log -rank test at significance level of 0.005 one -sided. 
Similarly, assuming a median survival time of 10.5 months for subjects in the sorafenib group  and a median time  of 14.6 
months for subjects in combination group, 359 OS events will 
be sufficient to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.72 with 85% 
power based on Log- rank test at significance level of 0.020 
one-sided. Assuming an accrual period of 18 months, total 
duration of 36 months and 19 months for the OS and PFS, respectively, and probability of subject loss at approximately 
10% per 12 months and per 6 months for the OS and PFS respectively, a sample size of  510 subject s will be enrolled for 
the study. Power and sample calculations were performed using 
EAST® 6.4.1. software package . 
Data Analysis / 
Statistical Methods  Efficacy Analyses  
The two primary endpoints for the study are OS and PFS 
(assessed by BIRC based  on RECIST v1.1). For the PFS, there 
is one planned analysis, which is expected to occur when 332 
PFS events are observed  at ~19 months after first subject 
enrolled . The OS will be evaluated  in the following time points: 
when PFS is analyzed; when 251 OS events are observed (70%  
at ~ 23 months after first subject enrolled)  and when 359 OS 
events are observed at  36 months  after first subject enrolled . 
The hypothesis testing of OS and PFS will b e evaluated by

 22  in the ITT using  a stratified Log -rank test (based on 
randomization stratification factors). The hazard ratio 
(HR=SHR -1210 plus rivoceranib  / sorafenib) and the 
corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) will be estimated 
in a stratified Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group and randomization stratification factors included in the 
model. The survival  curve for each treatment group  
will be 
estimated using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) product -limit method. 
A 95% CI for median survival time  will be estimated by 
Brookmeyer -Crowley method.  
Objective response rate (ORR) assessed by BIRC according to RECIST v1.1 will be analyzed as a key secondary endpoint and will be analyzed when 70%  OS events are observed. If both 
PFS and OS primary endpoints are positive, comparison 
between treatment groups in ORR by BIRC according to 
RECIST v1.1 will be performed using stratified Cochran -
Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test. Difference in proportions for 
ORR  and its 95% CI using normal approximation will be 
provided. Overall response rates and their corresponding 95% exact CIs will be calculated by Clopper -
Pearson method for 
each treatment group.  
The other time -to-event endpoints will be estimated using the 
Kaplan -Meier (KM) product -limit method, unless specified. A 
95% CI for median survival time will be estimated by 
Brookmeyer -Crowley method, if necessary.  
For other binary variables, stratified CMH test will be used and two-sided 95% CI for treatment diffe rence will be calculated 
using normal approximation. 
Safety Analyses  
Safety data including AEs and  laboratory results will be 
summarized descriptively using summary statistics.  
Other Analyses:  
Exploratory  endpoints including average scores and its change 
from baseline obtained from EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC 
QLQ -HCC18 will be summarized descriptively using summary 
statistics.  
Biomarkers (e.g. the expression level of PD -L1 and proportion 
of strong expression of PD -L1 in tumor tissue ) will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics, and an ad hoc  analysis 
will be performed if required .  
Population pharmacokinetic s, drug exposure -QTc analysis  and 
drug exposure -response relation will be analyzed and reported 
separately.  
End of Study  For this study, end of study is defined as the date  when the last 
subject randomized has been followed for at least 2 years.

 Note: Except the test items and time points listed in the table, the investigator may add necessary examinations  at any time. The test results will be filled in the section of 
“Examinations at Unscheduled Visits ” in the CRF .  
[1] Screen ing period (Day -28): baseline data will be collected after signature of informed consent form and no longer  than 28 days before  start of study drug; if routine 
radiological evaluation of tumor has been performed prior to signature of the informed consent,  it is unnecessary to repeat these scans during screening period in cases 
where these enhanced CTs or MRIs are completed within 28 days prior to the start of study drug (bone scan within 42 days prior to the start of study drug is acceptable). 
All baseline  evaluations will be based on the results colle cted closest to the start of study drug.  
[2] Screening period (Day - 14): physical examination, vital signs, ECOG -PS score and laboratory examinations (including fecal occult blood, thyroid function, 
alpha - fetoprotein, and virology ), 12 -lead ECG and echocardiography (including LVEF) to be collected within 14 days prior to the first dose, following the signatur e of 
informed consent form. All baseline evaluations will be based on the results collected closest to the start of study drug.  
[3] Screening period (Day - 7): following the signature of informed consent form, data on  hematology , urinalysis, blood chemistry, blood electrolytes, coagulation parameters , 
blood HCG (for women of childbearing potential) and Child -Pugh class must be collected within 7 days prior to the first dose. All baseline evaluations will be based on 
the results collected closest to the start of study drug.  Subjects with screening failure can be re- screened. They must sign the informed consent form again, re -register and 
obtain a new subject number at the re- screening. Subjects can only be re- screened once.  
[4] Treatment period: data on  hematology , urinalysis, blood chemistry and blood electrolytes will be evaluated within 72h prior to administration of study drug during the 
scheduled  visit; ECOG -PS score, physical examination and vital signs will be evaluated within 24h prior to administration of study drug duri ng the scheduled  visit (they 
are not needed on C1D1 in cases where they are completed within 24h prior to the first dose during the screening period). I n the event of a dose del ay, the required 
examinations at each corresponding visit during study treatment should be scheduled as planned or more frequently if clinically indicated  (Immunogenicity, concentrations 
of SHR -1210 and rivoceranib, and patient reported outcomes should be collected at respective treatment cycles as specified in Footnotes [31]  [32] [35]).  
[5] End-of-treatment visit: Only after permanent discontinuation of both drugs (SHR -1210 and rivoceranib) , the end -of-treatment visit shall start. End -of-treatment visit 
include s ECOG performance, C -P score, vital sign, physical examination, 12- lead ECG , hematology , urinalysis, blood biochemistry, blood electrolytes, coagulation, 
thyroid function,  fecal occult blood test , virology , APF, HCG , subject ’s self-evaluation  and tumor imaging evaluation.  If tumor imaging evaluation completed within 4 
weeks prior to end- of-treatment visit,  or the other examinations of end -of-treatment visit completed within 7 days , then these study procedures would not be necessary to 
be repeated . For subjects who enter the extension phase after the end of study, all of the subject ’s data occurring prior to extension phase need to be captured into CRFs 
and EOT visit needs to  be performed even the subject s continue on study treatment (detailed instruction for data entering, refer to CRF completion guideline), the EOS 
page in CRFs for extension subjects should be collected as well before entering the extension phase.  If planned schedule visi t occurred within 7 days before the time of 
extension phase initiation or the relevant examinations for end of treatment visit completed within 7 days, these study proce dures would not be necessary to be repeated  
on EOT . 
[6] Safety follow -up: Subject who completed end -of-treatment visit (after permanent discontinuation of both drugs) will have sa fety follow -up after last dose.  It will end 90 
days after the last dose of SHR -1210 (non-serious AE unrelated to study drug will  only be collected for 30 days afte r the last dose)  or 30 days after the last dose of 
rivoceranib  in experimental arm (whichever comes later); and 30 days after the last dose of study drug in sorafenib (control) arm. The first safety follow -up should start  
30 days (±7 days) after the last dose of study drug and must be performed at the study center, regardless of initiation of ne w antitumor therapy. A telephone visit will be 
performed 60 days (±7 days) and 90 days (±7 days) after the last dose of study drug  in the experimental arm for survival status, subsequent antitumor therapy, concomitant

 medications/therapy and AEs/SAEs collection  (see Section 8.3 for details). When developing a safety follow -up plan, ensure that a visit is scheduled at this point in the 
safety follow -up period. If the date of the previously completed end -of-treatment visit has exceeded the safety follow -up period, there is no need to schedule a safety 
follow -up. For the subjects in experimental arm, if the date of completed end -of-treatment visit has exceeded the first safety follow -up (30 days after the last dose), but 
the safety follow -up period has not been reached, the subject does  not need to go to the site for safety follow -up, and 1 -2 telephone visits can be scheduled during the 
safety follow -up period. At this time, ensure that the interval between visits should not exceed 44 days, and a telephone visit should be c onducted at th is time point of the 
safety follow -up period.  
[7] Survival follow -up: the subject will enter survival follow -up period after the end of safety follow -up period. the telephone follow -up will be performed 30 days (±7 days) 
after last safety follow -up for the fir st survival follow -up, after that, the frequency was once every 30 days ( ±7 days),  collectin g of data on survival and subsequent 
antitumor treatment.  
[8] Signature of informed consent form: the informed consent on enrollment into this study needs to be comple ted during screening period. Prior to acquisition of the written 
informed consent form, no screening procedures specified in the study can be performed; there are special provisions on the b aseline radiological examination of tumor, 
please refer to the not e in radiological evaluation for tumors in this flow chart for details. Subjects with screening failure prior to treatment ar e allowed to have another 
opportunity for screening in this study  and must repeat the informed consent and register again for a new  subject number at re- screening.  
[9] Tumor history: including previous history of HCC, history of present illness, initial diagnosis, pathological diagnosis, data  on radiological examination, course of treatment 
(e.g., surgery, interventional therapy, local ablation, and radiotherapy).   
[10] Other medical history: including history of drug allergy, history of diagnosis and treatment for other significant concomitan t disease, history of tumors except 
hepatocellular carcinoma,  and history of alcohol consumption  etc.  
[11] Child -Pugh class: will be performed within 7  days prior to the first dose during the  screening period,  on Day 1 of each cycle in Cycles ≥  2 during the  treatment period, at 
end-of-treatment visit and safety follow -up. 
[12] ECOG -PS score: will be performed withi n 14 days prior to the first dose during the  screening period, prior to administration on Day 1 of the subsequent cycles of therapy, 
at end -of-treatment visit and safety follow -up.  
[13] Physical examination: including height (only for initial examination), body weight, head and face, skin system, lymph nodes, eyes (sclera, pupil), otolaryngology, mouth, 
respiratory system, cardiovascular system, abdomen, genitourinary system, musculoskele tal system, neurological and mental status. A full physical examination will be 
performed in the screening period, and only body weight and important sites (including skin, respiratory system, cardiovascul ar system, abdomen and mental state) will 
be examin ed during the study. Physical examination will be performed within 14 days prior to first dose during the  treatment period (experimental arm: prior to 
administration on Day 1 and 15 of each cycle of therapy; control arm: prior to administration on Day 1 an d 15 of each cycle in Cycle 1 -3, prior to administration only on 
Day 1 from Cycle 4), at end -of-treatment visit and safety follow -up. Note: except for the physical examination during the  screening period  and end -of-treatment visit, it 
is not necessary to record complete results of physical examination in the eCRF during the trial, and only weight and abnormal results need to be recorded. In addition, 
physical examination of reactive capillary endothelial proliferation needs to be p erformed in the experimental arm , occurrence sites, such as the skin, oral mucosa, nasal 
mucosa, etc., should be recorded in the eCRF in detail.  Reactive capillary endothelial proliferation will be followed up until it is resolved, other reasonable time po ints 
(e.g., loss of follow -up, death), or reached to  a stable state without any expectation of re covery.

normalized heart rate and is calculated as 60 divided by heart rate ). If QTc interval is abnormal, QTc needs to be measured for three consecutive times at an interval of 
approximately two minutes apart;   
QTc needs to be re- tested if:  
  - at baseline: male > 450 ms, female > 470 ms, retest 2 times and  take the mean value;  
  - after enrollment: same as baseline, or longer than the baseline average ≥ 30 ms.  
 Experimental arm: T he 12- lead ECG will be performed within 14 days prior to fir st dose  in screening period, 2.5 (±1) hours post dose at each of the following days: 
C1D1, C1D15, D1 o f Cycles 2 and after wards, and at end- of-treatment visit and safety follow -up. When the E CG collection day is coincident with the PK collection day, 
time matched E CG and PK samples (within 15 minutes  apart, E CG collection first) will be collected.  Control arm:14 days prior to first dose in screening period,  C1D1, 
C1D15,  D1 of Cycles 2 and after wards,  and at end- of-treatment visit and safety follow -up. 
[26] Echocardiography  must include LVEF and can be scheduled at the  investigator ’s discretion during the study.  
[27] Blood HCG test: only for women of childbearing potential (WOCBP, any woman who has experienced menarche, has not undergone  a hysterectomy, ligation of bilateral 
fallopian tubes or bilateral oophorectomy, and is not post -menopausal). (See definition of menopausal in Section 4.4.1 ) Blood HCG will be performed within 7 days prior 
to the first dose, at end -of-treatment visit and safety follow -up.  
[28] Collection of concomitant medication/therapy: collect concomitant medication/therapy information (drugs excluding solvents) f rom 28 days prior to  the signing of the 
informed consent form to the end of safety follow -up: record drug names, drug dosage, route of administration, frequency of administration, purpose of administration, 
and date of start and end. After the safety follow -up period, only re cord medication/therapy that is used to manage the study drugs related AE/SAE. Please refer to  
Section 5.3 (Concomitant therapy ) of the protocol for details.  
[29] Collection of AE: in accordance with NCI -CTCAE v 4.03, AEs are observed and recorded from the signature of informed consent form, until 90 days after the last dose 
of SHR -1210, or 30 days after the last dose of anti -angiogenesis targeted therapy, whichever comes later. For specific AE collection periods, please refer to Section 8.3, 
Table of AE/SAE Collection Period . An AE/SAE will be followed up until it is resolved, returns to the baseline level or ≤ Grade 1, or reaches a stable state, or until other 
reasonable time points (e.g., loss of follow -up, death). Every effort should be made to ensure that the subject achi eves the final outcome  and definite causality assessment 
is obtain ed. 
[30] Tumor radiological evaluation : all the evaluable tumor lesions should be evaluated and recorded based on RECIST v1.1  (evaluated by investigator and BIRC), mRECIST 
(evaluated by BIRC only ) and imRECIST (evaluated by investigator only) . The baseline evaluation includes the enhanced CT /MRI  scan of chest, abdomen, pelvis and 
sites of lesions, brain enhanced MRI or enhanced CT scan (to exclude intracranial metastasis) . Thoracic plain CT scan + abdominal, pelvic and brain MRI can be 
performed in case of allergy to the contrast agent for enhanced CT; bone scan will be performed only when clinically indicated. Tumor radiological evaluation during 
treatment period will be performed once every 8 weeks (56±7 days) within the first 48 weeks from randomization and once every 12 weeks (84±7 days) thereafter and 
can be additionally performed when clinically indicated. When there is no clear disease progression, tumor evaluation should be continued regardl ess of discontinuation

 of study treatment, unless death, withdrawal of informed consent, start of subsequent anticancer therapy or termination of st udy by the sponsor, whichever comes first; 
the evaluation includes the enhanced CT /MRI  scan of chest, abdomen, pelvis and sites of lesions . Thoracic plain CT scan + abdominal and pelvic MRI can be performed 
in case of allergy to the contrast agent for enhanced CT; cranial CT/MRI and bone scan will be performed only when clinically  indicated . The same radiological technique 
should be used in each subject throughout the study. Investigators must review the results prior to administration in the next cycle. After first documentation of response 
(CR or PR), confirmation of tumor response should occur at 4 weeks after the first response or at the next scheduled assessment time point. When a subject develops a disease progression as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, the investigator is required to submit radiological data immed iately to BIRC. If BIRC 
confirms non-disease progression according to RECIST v1.1, the subject should continue to receive study drug therapy and continue to perfo rm tumor radiological  
assessment; if BIRC confirms disease progression according to RECIST v1. 1, then the investigator needs to assess whether the subject still has clinical benefit, and if the 
subject is still considered to have clinical benefit and meets the criteria for continued treatment after progression of the disease (see Section 6.6 for details), the subject 
may continue to receive study medication and continue the efficacy assessment at the schedul ed frequency. Tumor radiological assessment will continue until the 
occurrence of disease progression confirmed by BIRC according to RECIST v1.1 criteria or study treatment  discontinuation , whichever occurs later. Before BIRC 
confirms the disease progression according to the RECIST v1.1 criteria  or the treatment is discontinued, if the subject withdraws the informed consent , other anti -tumor 
treatment has begun (except for traditional Chinese medicine) , or the subject dies, there is no need to continue the radiological evaluation. If the subject does not meet 
the above criteria for stop radiological assessment , the efficacy evaluation of the three efficacy evaluation criteria (RECIST v1.1, mRECIST, imRECIST) needs to 
continue even if the disease progression under certain efficacy ev aluation criteria occurs. If there has not been any disease progression confirmed  by a radiological 
examination when the subject is about to withdraw from the study, it is recommended that a radiological examination be performed in time before the  withdrawal  (if the 
time from the last radiological examination to the withdrawal  is ≤ 4 weeks, additional radiological examination  will not be required  at the time of withdrawal ). Detailed 
requirements  for image collection will be described in image acquisition  guideline . Disease progression will rely on  the investigator ’s confirmation per RECIST v1.1 
upon approval of protocol v6.0, and radiological data will not be submitted  to BIRC anymore,  tumor assessment evaluated by BIRC per mRECIST will not be performed 
afterwards.  If the investigator confirms non- disease progression , the subject should continue on  study treatment and tumor radiological evaluation as required ; if the 
investigator confirms as disease progression,  the subject may continue to receive study treatment after disease progression at the investigator ’s discretion  (see Section 
6.6). 
[31] Pre-dose sampling : only the blood sample in the experimental arm will be collected (including SHR -1210 combined with rivoceranib , SHR -1210 monotherapy  or 
rivoceranib monotherapy ) on Day 1 of Cycle 1 -4 (C1D1, C2D1, C3D1 and C4D1) and  once on Day 1 of every three cycles thereafter  (The time point for sample collection 
will be within 0.5  hours  prior to administration of rivoceranib ); on 30 days (±7 days) after the last dose of SHR -1210.  When SHR -1210 is interrupted for longer than 30 
days and is confirmed to be unable to r esume, the subject is required to come for a site visit and collect blood sample.  If the subject has star ted other anti -tumor therapy, 
it’s not necessary to collect the immunogenicity blood sample at 30 days (±7 days) after the last administration of SHR -1210. If SHR -1210 and/or rivoceranib is 
temporarily  interrupted, pre -dose immunogenicity and PK sample will be collected on schedule . If only rivoceranib is interrupted , the time of sampling is 0.5 hours  prior 
to SHR -1210 administrati on. On C1D1 approximately 6 mL venous blood will be collected for detection of the serum concentration and immunogenicity of SHR1210;  
On C2D1,  C3D1 and C4D1 approximately 8mL venous blood will be collected , 6 mL will be used for detection of the serum concentration and immunogenicity of SHR -
1210, and 2 mL will be used for detection of plasma concentration of rivoceranib . The exact time of the previous administration of rivoceranib concentration will be 
collected (provided by the subject ). Approximately 6 mL venous blood will be collected for detection of the serum concentration and immunogenicity of SHR1210 at the 
later time points  (e.g., C7D1,  C10D1 etc.) . Pre-dose sampling will not be performed in  the extension phase. [See  BLOOD SAMPLE COLLECTION TABLE  for details]  
[32] ECG blood sampling: ECG examination will be performed 2.5 hours (±1 hour) after the end of the rivoceranib administration, an d blood will be collected within 15 
minutes after the ECG examination on the first day  from Cycle 1 to Cycle 4.  If the rivoceranib is temporarily interrupted, a blood sample within 15 minutes after ECG

[33] Randomization: subjects will be randomized into either the experimental arm or control arm after their data are reviewed and determined to be in accordance with the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the first dose should be given within 2 4 hours  following randomization (on Day 1 of Cycle 1).  
[34] Distribution, verification and re turn of subject ’s medication diary: in the experimental arm at D1 and D15 of each cycle, in the control arm, at  D1 and D15 of Cycles 1-
3, and D1 for every cycle thereafter . On C1D1, only distribution is needed. At the end- of-treatment visit, distribution of diary is not needed but verification and re turn are 
required .  
[35] Subject ’s self -evaluation results: all subjects will complete EORTC QLQ -C30 (version 3.0) , EORTC QLQ -HCC18 a nd EQ -5D-5L questionnaires prior to administration 
of study drug and any study procedure at the clinical center, starting from C1D1  and on D1  of each cycle onward.  In addition, all subjects are required to complete the 
questionnaire s at the end -of-treatmen t visit and during the first safety follow -up visit. Before the subject  leaves the site, the study staff should review all the questionnaires 
for completeness .

RATIONALE  
1.1. Study B ackground  
1.1.1. Epidemiology and C urrent Treatment Status of Hepatocellular 
Carcinoma  
Primary Carcinoma of the Liver is referred to as liver carcinoma. Primary Carcinomas 
of the Liver mainly include three different pathological types of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), and the mixed HCC -ICC, 
in which HCC accounts for 90%  
[1 ]. According to data from  GLOBO CAN 2012, liver 
carcinoma is the sixth most common cancer, with about 782,500 new cases of liver 
carcinoma and 745,500 deaths worldwide annually, ranking it second in the cause of 
death among st male tumors worldwide  [2]. 
The majority of  HCC cases (> 80%) occur in Eastern Asia and sub- Saharan Africa, with  
incidence rates of > 20  per 100,000 individuals , followed by  Southern European 
countries, such as Spain, Ital y and Greece, with an  incidence of 10 to 20 cases per 
100,000 populations . HCC incidence is relatively lower in  North America, South 
America, N orthern Europe and Oceania  (< 5 / 100,000)  [3]. 
China is a high- risk area for liver carcinoma, with morbidity and death accounting  for 
about  50% of the world [2]. In 2015, there were 466,100 new subject s with liver 
carcinoma, the fourth most common tumor, and 422,100 deaths in China. Liver 
carcinoma ranks the third as cause of death in China, and it ranks third in males (12.72%) and seventh in females (5.68%) 
[4]. 
The main risk factors for HCC are infection with HBV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), vinyl chloride, alcohol  abuse , and nonalcoholic  fatty liver; i n addition, the rare causes 
include hereditary hemochromatosis, α -antitrypsin deficiency and autoimmune 
hepatitis  
[5]. HBV and HCV infection account for 80%~90% of total HCC cases 
worldwide. Chronic HB V infection is a major  risk factor for HCC in most Asian regions 
except  Japan[3],while chronic HCV infection is a major risk factor for HCC in Japan[6]. 
In China, up to 80% of HCC is hepatitis B virus ( HBV )-related HCC  [7]. A considerable 
proportion of subject s are already in advanced stage at diagnosis or cannot undergo 
surgery or local treatment due to underlying liver diseases such as combined cirrhosis. 
The different treatments  of HCC are selected according to disease s taging, which is 
mainly based on BCLC  staging system, Child -Pugh liver function classification system 
and disease degree. About  30% of HCC cases are diagnosed at an  early stage (that is,  
BCLC stage  0 or A), and the main treatments include surgical resectio n, ablation 
technique and liver transplantation. But the 5 -year recurrence rate is still as high as 70%  
[8]. 
The recommended treatment  for mid -stage HCC (BCLC stage B) is hepatic artery 
interventional therapy, that is, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE),  but 
the application scope is limite d due to concomitant disease and liver function damage, 
and the subject  will eventually experience progression  after treatment  and is no longer 
suitable  for further TACE treatment.

40 The treatment options available for advanced HCC ( also known as  BCLC stage C) are 
very limited, and  sorafenib, an oral multi- target  inhibitor, is the first targeted drug 
approved globally for HCC first -line systemic treatment. Recently, the FDA approved 
the second oral multi -kinase inhibitor  lenvatinib for the first -line treatmen t of advanced 
HCC, which has not been widely used. In addition to the above two types of targeted 
therapy, the first -line standard of care of HCC also includes oxaliplatin- based 
chemotherapy, which is also used as the first -line treatment in some regions.  
1.1.2. Advances in the Treatment of Advanced H epatocellular C arcinoma  
For advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, the available treatment options are very limited. Sorafenib is an oral multi- target inhibitor (VEGFR -1, -2, -3, PDGFR, c -KIT, etc.) that 
directly blocks t he formation of neovascularization and inhibits tumor growth. It is the 
first FDA -approved targeted drug for HCC first -line systemic treatment. This approval 
was based on the positive results from the SHARP and ORIENTAL trials. The efficacy and safety of s orafenib and placebo were compared in the treatment of advanced HCC. 
The results showed that the survival and safety of subject s in the s orafenib group were 
significantly improved compared with those in the placebo group.  
The SHARP study was a randomized, phase 3 study in western populations, in which 
sorafenib increased  progression free survival ( PFS) (median: 5.5 months and 2.8 
months, respectively) by 73% and overall survival ( OS) (median: 10.7 months and 7.9 
months, respectively) by 44% compared with placebo. ORIENTAL, another randomized phase 3 study conducted in Asian populations similar to the SHARP study in design, had the same results, increasing overall survival (OS) by 2.3 months (median 
OS: 6.5 months and 4.2 months, respectively)
[9, 10]. 
In addition, the results of the phase 3 non-inferiority study on the efficacy and safety of 
lenvatinib (developed by Eisai)  versus sorafenib in the first -line treatment of subject s 
with unresectable HCC (REFLECT trial  [11]) showed, l envatinib achieved the primary 
endpoint, demonstrating that the median OS with l envatinib was non- inferior to that 
with sorafenib. Subject s treated with l envatinib experienced a median OS of 13.6 
months compared to 12.3 months with sorafenib (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.92); In terms 
of secondary endpoints, l envatinib seemed significantly superior to s orafenib in median 
PFS (7.4 months vs 3.7 months), me dian TTP (8.9 months vs 3.7 months) and ORR 
(24% vs 9%). In terms of safety, the incidence of adverse events (AE) was similar in 
the two groups. At the 2017 CSCO Annual Meeting, Professor Qin Shukui  published 
the data analysis results of the Asian subgroup of the trial. A total of 288 subject s were 
enrolled. The lenvatinib and the s orafenib groups were compared in the median PFS 
(9.2 months vs 3.6 months), median TTP (11 months vs 3.7 months), and ORR (21.5% 
vs 8.3%), showing that l enva tinib was more effective for subgroups of subject s in 
China's mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong and will become a new treatment option for subject s with unresectable advanced HCC worldwide. Based on REFLECT study, 
lenvatinib was approved by  FDA as the second first -line treatment for advanced HCC 
following s orafenib.  
In addition to the two approved targeted therapies, Oxaliplatin- based chemotherapy is 
also the standard first -line treatment in some areas. The EACH study was a prospective, 
randomized, controlled phase 3 international clinical study of Oxaliplatin -containing 
FOLFOX4 chemotherapy and Doxorubicin for palliative chemotherapy in Asian

41 subject s with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who are not suitable for surgery or 
local treatment. The study had the largest number of enrolled subject s (371 cases) in the 
field of systemic chemotherapy for liver carcinoma, with Chinese subject s accounting 
for 75%. The study confirmed f or the first time  that compared with doxorubicin, the 
regimen with Oxaliplatin -contain ing FOLFOX4 prolong ed the median OS  of subject s 
with advanced liver cancer from 4.97 months to 6.40 months, reduce d the risk of death 
by 20%, improve d the median PFS (2.93 months vs. 1.77 months), reduce d the risk of 
recurrence and metastasis, and significantly increased the ORR to 8.2%, meanwhile the 
adverse reactions  could be tolerated [12]. 
Regorafenib, another oral multi -kinase inhibitor, was approved by the FDA in 2017 for 
the second -line treatment of subject s with HCC who received previous treatment with 
sorafenib, based on an international multicenter, placebo -controlled phase 3 clinical 
study (RESORCE study  [13]). The data showed a significant improvement in OS in the 
Regorafenib g roup compared with placebo (median:  10.6 months vs. 7.8 months, 
HR=0.62, 95% CI 0.50- 0.79, P<0.001), and the risk of death was reduced by 37%. The 
most common adverse reactions in the Regorafenib and placebo groups were pain (55% 
vs. 44%), hand- foot skin reaction/palmar -plantar erythrodyses thesia (51% vs. 7%), and 
weakness/fatigue (42% vs. 33%), diarrhea (41% vs. 15%), hypertension (31% vs. 6%), infection (31% vs. 18%), anorexia (31% vs. 15%). It is currently approved only for 
second -line treatment after the progression with s orafenib treatm ent; the registered 
clinical trials do not include subjects with post- chemotherapy progression/ sorafenib 
intolerance, and there is no data on the efficacy of second- line and later -line therapies. 
At the same time, the incidence of treatment -related adverse events for Regorafenib is 
relatively high, limiting its clinical use.  
1.1.3. Development of PD -1/PD -L1 M onoclonal Antibody in Advanced Tumors  
Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD -1) is the first immune checkpoint molecule to be 
discovered , express ed in stimulated  B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells. It is initially 
described as "a brake on the immune response" for its role in inhibiting the immune response by binding to the ligand PD -L1. PD -1/PD -L1 immunological checkpoint 
inhibitor is currently the most attractiv e tumor immunotherapy drug, which can regulate 
the anti -tumor activity of T lymphocytes by blocking PD -1/PD -L1 signaling pathway, 
and improve the subject 's own immune response to tumor, thus achieving the purpose 
of killing tumor cells.  
Since 2014, the U.S . FDA has approved anti -PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, Bristol -
Myers Squibb's  nivolumab and Merck's pembrolizumab, based on outstanding efficacy , 
for the treatment of subject s with advanced melanoma, non- small cell lung cancer, renal 
cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, urothelial carcinoma, MSI-H or dMMR malignant tumor, gastric cancer and gastroesophageal junction 
adenocarcinoma, and cervical cancer as well as subject s with hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) who have received sorafenib , including advanced subject s who have failed 
standard treatment without effective treatment and are advanced to first - and second-
line treatments. In addition, due to the long -lasting efficacy and mild adverse reactions, 
hundreds of clinical trials on ant i-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies (including monotherapy 
and combined therapy) have been conducted internationally for advanced solid tumor and haematological malignancy. The preliminary results of trials have shown greater 
efficacy and long -term survival compa red with existing therapies. At the same time, in

42 terms of safety, drug -related toxicity was controllable, and the toxicity of Grade 3 and 
above was lower than that of traditional chemotherapy drugs  [14 ]. 
1.1.3.1. PD-1/PD -L1 M onotherapy and H epatocellular Carcinoma  
In advanced HCC, PD -1/PD -L1 antibody also showed significant initial efficacy: the 
Checkmate- 040 study was a single- arm, open- label , dose escalation and expansion, 
phase I/II clinical study evaluating nivolumab  monotherapy for advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma: a total of 262 subject s (48 for dose escalation and 214 for 
expansion) were enrolled to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab. The results 
of this study indicate that the initial efficacy of nivolumab monotherapy for advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma was significant. For the subject s with advanced HCC (N=154) 
who have been treated with s orafenib, the objective response r ate (ORR) of nivolumab  
was 14.3%, and 91% of subjects had a duration of response (DoR) of 6 months or more. 
55% of subjects had a DoR of 12 months or more  [15]. Based on this study, in September 
2017, the FDA approved nivolumab for subject s with advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) who had previously received sorafenib, marking the official entry 
into the era of immunotherapy  for HCC . 
In addition, the KEYNOTE 224 study also confirmed the significant efficacy of PD -1 
monoclonal antibody in HCC. This study was a one -arm, open -label , phase II clinical 
trial of pembrolizumab monotherapy for subject s with advanced HCC who had failed 
or were intolerant to s orafenib alone. A total of 104 subject s with advanced HCC were 
enrolled in the study. The results showed that the ORR of pembrolizumab  was 17%, the 
DCR was 62%, the median PFS was 4.9 months, and the median OS was 12.9 months  
[16]. Based on this study, in November  2018, the FDA approved pembrolizumab  
indicated for the treatment of subject s with advanced HCC who have previously failed 
sorafenib treatment . Because of the prominent efficacy  of PD - 1 antibodies in liver 
carcinoma, the domestic and foreign companies have carried out a number of randomized, controlled phase 3 studies of PD -1 antibody monotherapy for advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma.  
Despite the unprecedented success of PD -1/PD -L1 antibodies, it should not be 
overlooked that nearly 50% of solid tumor subject s do not benefit from this  therapy. 
Taking advanced hepatocellular carcinoma accompanied with HBV infection as an 
example (about 9 0% of subject s with hepatocellular carcinoma in China are 
accompanied by HBV infection), the ORR  of nivolumab was only 14%, and the DCR 
was only 55%. Nearly half of the subjects developed disease progression after 8 weeks of treatment. How to optimize the efficacy of anti -PD-1 antibody in advanced HCC on 
the basis of monotherapy effectiveness has become an urgent problem to be solved. 
1.1.3.2. PD-1/PD -L1 C ombined with Anti-angiogenic Targeted D rugs  
At present, there are two methods for improving the efficacy of PD -1/PD -L1 
immunotherapy. Firstly, molecular markers that predict efficacy have been explored. In 
this direction, the therapeutic effect of PD -1/PD -L1 is improved by detecting and 
enriching subject s with molecular markers such as the expression level of PD -L1 in 
tumor tissue , the level of tumor mutational burden (TMB), high microsatellite 
instability (MSI -H) and dMMR. Secondly, a suitable combination regimen for 
immunological combination therap y are being sought. At present, a large number of

43 clinical studies have been carried out on the combination of PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors with 
other immunological checkpoint inhibitors, traditional chemotherapeutic drugs or 
targeted anti -tumor drugs. 
Among them , PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors combined with anti -angiogenic targeted drugs 
have a significant synergistic effect on efficacy. Currently, the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation for the multiple PD-1/PD -L1 inhibitors combined 
with anti-angiogenic targeted drugs. In a phase Ib clinical study of pembrolizumab 
combined with Axitinib for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, a total of 52 subject s with advanced renal cell carcinoma who had not received systemic 
treatment were recruited in the study. The optimal dose of the combination was taken as the primary  endpoint, and the efficacy endpoints such as ORR, DoR, and PFS were 
also assessed . The observation results of tolerance showed that the combination of 
Axitinib standard dose (5 mg, BID) and pembrolizumab, 2 mg/kg Q3W was well 
tolerated. The efficacy results showed that the anti -tumor effect of combined therapy 
was far superior to that of Axitinib or anti- PD-1 monotherapy, and ORR reached 73%, 
among which 8% achieved complete response . More than 90% of subject s showed 
tumor shrinkage and mPFS was  over 20 months, far exceeding Axitinib monotherapy 
for control of disease progression (mPFS = 10- 15 months). While there are still no data 
on pembrolizumab monotherapy for renal cell carcinoma, the syn ergistic effect of 
Axitinib and pembrolizumab in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma is superior to that of nivolumab (ORR = 13%) and atezolizumab (untreated: ORR = 25%, mPFS = 6 
months; treated : ORR = 15%, mPFS = 6 months) monotherapy
[17]. In addition, based 
on excellent efficacy data, pembrolizumab combined with l envatinib in the treatment 
of advanced renal cell carcinoma and advanced endometrial cancer, as  well as PD -L1 
monoclonal antibody Avelumab combined with Axitinib in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma has been granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA.  
In addition to renal cell carcinoma, combinations of anti -PD-1/PD -L1 inhibito rs and 
VEGFR inhibitors have shown good efficacy in many solid tumors such as non- small 
cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and endometrioid carcinoma. A number of 
phase 3 studies are ongoing.  
In the combination therapy of advanced hepatocellular c arcinoma, anti -angiogenic 
targeted drugs have also achieved breakthroughs in combination with PD -1/PD -L1 
antibodies. Several studies have confirmed that PD -1/PD -L1 antibodies and anti -
angiogenic targeted drugs, including small molecule VEGFR inhibitors and 
VEGF/VEGFR antibodies, are safe and well tolerated, and can achieve synergistic 
effects.  
In 2019, the updated efficacy of a tezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab in the 
treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma was reported in  ESMO . This study was 
performed with atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab in subject s with 
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who had not received systemic therapy. Of the 104 
evaluable cases, a total of 37 cases of response were observed, with an confir med ORR 
of 36%, DCR was 71%, mPFS was 7.3 months ( 95%CI : 5.4, 9.9), mOS was 17.1months 
(95%CI :13.8, NE) 
[18]. A randomized, controlled phase 3  clinical study of atezolizumab 
in combination with bevacizumab versus s orafenib in the treatment of unresectable 
locally advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma had been initiated since 2018 
(IMbrave150, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , of which prima ry endpoints we re OS and BIRC

44 evaluated PFS per RECIST v1.1, and the positive result was reported during  the ESMO -
Asia 2019. A t otal of 501 advanced HCC subjects were randomized at 2:1 to receive  
atezolizumab combined with bevacizumab (336 subjects) or sorafenib (165 subjects). 
The mOS in the experimental arm has not reached, the mOS in the control arm was 13.2 
months, HR=0.58. The mPFS w as 6.8 months ( 95%CI : 5.7, 8.3) and 4.3 months 
(95%CI : 4.0, 5.6) in experimental arm and control arm respectively  [19]. The Chinese 
subgroup data was released in the following EASL 2020, a total of 194 Chinese subjects  
(137 of them were from the study of IMbrave 150, and 57 of them were from the 
extended enrollment in China ；experimental arm 133 subjects, control arm 61 subjects) 
were enrolled in this study. The m OS in the experimental arm has not reached, the 
control arm  mOS was 11.4 months, HR=0.44. The mPFS was 5.7 months ( 95%CI : 4.2, 
8.3) and 3.2 months ( 95%CI : 2.6, 4.8) in experimental arm and control arm respectively , 
HR=0. 60 [20].  
In another phase Ib study of pembrolizumab combined with l envatinib for unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma which was reported during  ESMO 2019, all 67 subject s with 
hepatocellular carcinoma who were enrolled in efficacy expansion stage of the study had never received s orafenib treatment. Based on IRC assessment according to RECIST 
v1.1, the ORR and DCR was 32.8% (95% CI: 21.8, 45.4) and 85.1% (95% CI: 74.3, 
92.6), mPFS was 9.5 months ( 95%CI : 5.6, 11.8) and mOS was 20.4 months ( 95%CI : 
11.0, NE) 
[21]. Based on above phase Ib data, a phase III, randomized, double -blind 
study of pembrolizuma b combined with lenvatinib versus  lenvatinib as the fir st-line 
treatment for advanced HCC  is ongoing . 
The preliminary results of an exploratory clinical study of SHR -1210 combined with 
the VEGFR inhibitor rivoceranib  in hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer were 
also published in 2018. For the dose group of SHR -1210 200 mg, Q2W combined with 
rivoceranib  125 mg, 250 mg or 500 mg , QD. Total 18 subject s with  HCC enrolled, 16 
were evaluable (all HBV -positive, 15 of which failed after sorafenib), 8 of which were 
evaluated as disease remission, the objective response rate (ORR) was 50%  (95%CI: 
24.7, 75.4) , DCR was 93.8% (95% CI: 69.8, 99.8), median time to respons e was 3.4 
months (rang e, 1.4, 9.7), mPFS was 5.8 months (95% CI: 2.6, NR), and the initial effect 
was significant[22]. 
It can be seen that s orafenib is still a widely recognized first- line treatment for advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma after 10 years on the market. However, the overall efficacy of sorafenib fo r hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively poor. A number of studies have 
confirmed that the ORR  of sorafenib in the treatment of advanced liver carcinoma is 
<10%, with mOS <10 months  
[ 9, 10, 11]. At present, the first -line systemic treatment of 
Chinese subject s with advanced HCC is mainly based on s orafenib and Oxaliplatin-
containing systemic chemotherapy, but the ORR  is low and the survival benefit is 
limited  [10, 12]. Another first -line treatme nt of l envatinib has not been widely used  yet. 
Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new and effective treatment regimen for advanced HCC. 
Multiple studies of immunological checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD -1/PD -L1 
monoclonal antibody, have shown good efficacy in the treatment of HCC. Compared 
with other systemic therapies, they have  the features of high ORR , long response time 
and prolonged survival  
[15-16].

45 Therefore, this study is a registration study of PD -1 monoclonal  antibody SHR -1210 
combined with rivoceranib in the treatment of advanced primary hepatocellular 
carcinoma and hopes to provide g uidance and experience for the new combination 
therapy of immunotherapy combined with targeted therapy in the future, so as to 
improve the anti -tumor effect of monotherapy, minimize toxic side effects, and 
ultimately bring better survival benefits to the majority of subject s.

1.2.1.2. Pharmacological C lass and M echanism of Action  
Programmed death -1 (PD -1) is a protein receptor expressed on the T  cell surface that 
was discovered in 1992 [23] and involved in the process of apoptosis. PD -1 belongs to 
the CD28 family, possessing 23% amino acid homology with cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA -4), but its expression is mainly on activated T cells, B cells and 
myeloid cells, which is different f rom that of CTLA -4. PD -1 has two ligands, PD -L1 
and PD -L2, respectively. PD -L1 is mainly expressed on T cells, B cells, macrophages 
and dendritic cells, and can be up- regulated on activated cells  
[24]. The expression of 
PD-L2 is relatively limited, mainly on antigen -presenting cells, such as activated 
macrophages and dendritic cells. The humanized anti -PD-1 monoclonal antibody 
specifically bi nds to PD -1 and blocks the interaction of PD -1 with its ligand, allowing 
T cells to recover immune response against the tumor cells.  
1.2.1.3. Pharmacodynamic S tudies  
1) Affinity of antibody  
The affinity of SHR -1210 for human, mouse, and cynomolgus and rhesus monkey PD -
1 was determined using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technology. The K d values 
for human and cynomolgus and rhesus monkey PD -1 are shown in  Table 1. The binding 
affinity of  SHR -1210 to mouse PD -1 was also measured; however, no binding was 
detected at the highest concentration tested (400 nM) .

Binding of SHR -1210 to human and cynomolgus monkey neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) 
was investigated. SHR -1210 binds to human and cynomolgus monkey FcRns with 
similar K d values.  
The binding of  SHR -1210 to different FcγR proteins was also evaluated using SPR 
technology. The data indicate that the binding of SHR -1210 to different FcγR proteins 
is consistent with an IgG4 antibody isotype.  
From the detection of the binding affinity, the affinity of SHR -1210 to antigen (human 
PD-1) was 3.0 nM, which was comparable to that of control antibodies nivolumab and 
MK3475 (pembrolizumab). The results are shown  in Table 2.

The experimental results (see Figure  1 and Figure  2) showed that the antibody SHR -
1210, nivolumab and pembrolizumab were comp arable in blocking the binding of PD -
1 / PD -L1 in vitro. The blocking activity of the antibodies SHR -1210, nivolumab and

1.2.1.4. Toxicology S tudies  
Eight cynomolgus monkeys (half males and half females) were randomly divided into 
two groups in a pre-clinical study of acute toxicity. SHR -1210 was intravenously 
injected at 200, 400 and 800 mg / kg for animals in Group 2 every other day in a dose  
escalation manner. No changes in clinical signs, weight, food consumption and coagulation associated with SHR -1210 were observed. When dose ≥ 200 mg / kg, 
lymphopenia was observed in male and female animals; when dose ≥ 400 mg / kg, 
increased serum globulin and decreased albumin were observed in male and female animals. The above changes were small, so it was not considered  as harmful effects. 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SHR -1210 is ≥ 800 mg/kg.  
In the completed pre -clinical study of chronic  toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys, male 
and female cynomolgus monkeys SHR -1210 was well tolerated when intravenously 
injected  at 20, 50 and 100 mg / kg once weekly for 4 weeks (5 times  in total) or 26 
weeks (26 times in total) . No changes in clinical signs associated with SHR -1210 were 
observed, including injection site irritation, body weight, food consumption, body 
temper ature, 12-lead ECG, blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory parameters; No 
changes in B and T lymphocyte typing, cytokine, immunoglobulin and complement parameters were observed; No changes in organ weights, gross lesions and 
histopathological changes a ssociated with SHR -1210 were observed.

1.2.2.1. Safety Summary of SHR -1210 in the Treatment of Advanced Solid 
Tumors  
After obtaining clinical trial approval in 2016, three phase I clinical studies have been 
carried out in China for SHR -1210. They are all safety and tolerability studies in 
subject s with advanced solid tumors. As of February 28, 2018, three phase I studies 
included 258 subject s with advanced solid tumors who ha ve failed standard treatment. 
The safety summary analysis is as follows:  
At least one AE occurred in 258 subjects (100.0%). AEs with an incidence of ≥  10% 
mainly included: skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : reactive cutaneous capillary  
endothelial proliferation (81.8%), pruritus (22.5%), rash (16.3%); abnormal liver 
function: elevated asparagine transaminase (22.1%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (19.0%), elevated conjugated bilirubin (17.8%), elevated blood bilirubin (13.2%); hematologic toxicity: anemia (29.5%), decreased white blood cell count (17.1%), 
decreased neutrophil count (10.5%); general disorders : fatigue (38.4%), fever (22.1%); 
gastrointestinal AE: nausea (12.0%), diarrhea (11.6%); respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders : cough (21.3%), upper respiratory tract infection (10.9%); 
metabolism and nutrition disorders : hypoproteinemia (22.1%), decreased serum sodium 
concentration (18.2%), anorexia (12.0%); renal and urinary disorders : proteinuria 
(22.5%); endocrine disorders : hypothyr oidism (20.9%). A total of 98 (38.0%) subjects 
experienced at least one AE of Grade 3 or above, and AEs of Grade 3 or above with an incidence of ≥ 2% mainly included anemia (7.0%), pulmonary infection (6.6%), 
decreased serum sodium concentration (4.3%), elevated conjugated bilirubin (3.9%), 
progressive tumors (3.5%), death (3.1%), elevated asparagine transaminase (2.7%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (2.3%), and elevated blood bilirubin (2.3%).  
In 258 subjects, 256 subjects (99.2%) experienced at least one drug -related AE. Drug -

serum sodium concentration (14.3%); renal and urinary disorder s: proteinuria (22.1 %); 
endocrine disorders : hypoth yroidism (19.8%). 82  (31.8%) subjects had at least one 
drug- related AE of Grade 3 or above, and the drug -related AEs of Grade  3 or above 
with incidence of ≥ 2% mainly included anemia (6.2%), pulmonary infection (5.8%), 
elevated conjugated bilirubin (3.9%), decreased serum sodium concentration (3.5%), 
death (3.1%), elevated asparagine transaminase (2.7%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (2.3%), and elevated blood bilirubin (2.3%).  
Among 258 subjects, AEs of Grade 3 or above with an incidence of ≥ 2% mainly  
included anemia (7.0%), pulmonary infection (6.6%), decreased serum sodium concentration (4.3%), and elevated conjugated bilirubin (3.9%), progressive tumor (3.5%), death (3.1%), elevated asparagine transaminase (2.7%), elevated alanine aminotransferase ( 2.3%), elevated blood bilirubin (2.3%).  
Overall, the AEs of SHR -1210 were similar to those of the already marketed same kind 
of drugs in subject s with advanced solid tumors except for  reactive cutaneous capillary  
endothelial  proliferation  (RCCEP) . Most of the RCCEP  occurred within 1- 2 months 
after the start of the study drug. The early ones could appear several days after the administration, and the late ones could appear about 5 months after the administration, 
mainly in the trunk or limbs. The vast majori ty (99.5%) were CTCAE 1 -2, and only one 
subject reported Grade 3. The subject was rated as Grade 3 AE due to hospitalization 
from surgical resection, and no subject s discontinued medication due to this AE. A small 
number of subjects with bleeding symptoms received local symptomatic treatment. The symptoms usually resolved after stopping SHR -1210 treatment. Overall, SHR -1210 has 
good safety and tolerability.  
1.2.2.2. Preliminary R esults of SHR -1210 M onotherapy for HCC S tudy  
The study was a single -arm study of SHR -1210 in subject s with advanced HCC who 
had undergone systemic therapy ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). SHR -1210 was administered at a 
dose of 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks. The enrollment of this study has been completed , the data was published in Lancet  Oncology  
[25]. As of November 16, 
2018 (data cut -off date), 12 months after last subject received first dose , 217 subjects 
received at least one dose of SHR -1210. 
Of 217 subjects treated,  206 (94.9%) were BCLC stage C subjects ; all subjects received 
at least ≥  1 line systemic therap ies, 49 (23%) subjects underwent at least ≥  2 line 
systemic therapies before enrollment; 177 (82%) subjects had extrahepatic m etastasis 
at baseline; 171 (79%) subjects had a baseline ECOG -PS score of 1; 111 (51%) subjects 
had baseline AFP ≥ 400 ng/mL, 181 (83%) subjects had HBV infection. 217 subjects 
met the definition of the full analysis set and were included in the full analys is set.

CI: 6 6.6, 82.9), and the Q3W group was 73.0% (95% CI: 63.6, 80.4).  
As of data cut -off of November16, 2018, the median follow -up was 12.5 months  and 
the observed median OS was 13.8 months (95% CI: 11.5, 16.6).  
Safety results: the category and frequency of common AE were similar to those in phase 
I clinical studies of this study drug. The most common drug- related A Es (incidence of 
any group ≥ 10%) were reactive cutaneous capillary endothelial proliferation, elevated 
transaminases, proteinuria, hyperbilirubinemia, hypothyroidism, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia  and fatigue. 22% of subjects had at least one drug- related AE of Grade 3 or 
Grade 4. 4% of subjects discontinued experimental drugs due to drug -related AE. At 
least one drug -related SAE occurred in 11 % of subjects.  
In this study, 145 (67%) subjects developed reactive capillary endothelial proliferation 
(all in skin, of which three  were accompanied in oral  mucosa,  two cases nasal mucosa, 
two cases palpebral  conjunctiva). Except one case was grad e 3, others reactive capillary 
endothelial proliferation cases were grade 1 -2, mild, self -limiting and clinically  
manag eable.  
Clinically significant results in laboratory tests were reported as  AE, with no other 
indicators of special attention. Vital signs were stable and there were no extreme values .

1.2.3. Progress in C linical Research of Rivoceranib  Monotherapy for Advanced 
HCC 
This clinical study also involved rivoceranib mesylate tablets  (trade name: Aitan), 
which was launched in 2014 by Jiang su Hengrui Pharmaceuticals  Co., Ltd. Rivoceranib  
is a small molecule targeted drug, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which exerts anti -angiogenic effects on malignant 
tumors mainly through inhibiting VEGFR. P reclinical studies show that its anti- tumor 
effect is superior to similar drugs. In 2014, rivoceranib  was approved in China for 
treatment of progression or recurrence of advanced gastric adenocarcinoma or adenocarcinoma of gastroesophageal junction after previous use of at least two systemic chemotherapies.  
HCC is also a typical tumor with an abundant blood supply, and its occurrence, development, metastasis and invasion are closely related to angiogenesis. In 2010- 2013, 
the 81
st hospital of the Chinese People ’s Liberation Army led a randomized, open- label , 
multicenter phase II clinical trial of  rivoceranib  mesylate tablets  in the treatment of 
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) [26], and a total of 121 subjects 
received the medication. In the full analysis set, the median time to progression (mTTP) and median overall survival (mOS) were 4.21 months and 9.71 months in the 850 mg group, and the mTTP and mOS in the 750 mg group were 3.32 months and 9.82 months.

51 There were no statistically significant differences in mTTP and mOS between the 850 
mg and 750 mg groups. The incidence of adverse reactions was 95.71% and 90.20% in 850 mg and 750 mg groups, respectively; the incidence of severe adverse reactions was 
58.57% and 58.82%, respectively, the difference was not statistically significant. Therefore, a well -tolerated 750 mg is recommended as the dose for the phase 3 clinical 
study. The recommended dosing regimen is 750 mg, PO, QD; 28 days is a cycle 
(excluding the time for discontinuance), and continuous administration until the disease progression or an intolerable adverse reaction. If a Grade 3/4 hematologic or non-
hematologic adverse reaction occurs, it is recommended to suspend the medication (not 
more than 2 weeks) or to reduce the dose to 500 mg or 250 mg.  
A randomized (2:1), open- label , placebo- controlled, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial 
of rivoceranib  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is currently ongoing to investigate the efficacy and 
safety of rivoceranib in the second- line treatment of advanced HCC. The trial recruited 
subject s with advanced HCC who have failed, relapsed or are intolerant to side effects  
with sorafenib or systemic chem otherapy . As of December 2017, 400 subjects have 
been enrolled. Adverse events that have been observed include proteinuria, elevated blood pressure, thrombocytopenia, hand- foot syndrome, and elevated total bilirubin. 
For more information on t he rivoceranib mesylate tablets, please refer to the pac kage 
insert of the rivoceranib  mesylate tablets and the  investigator's brochure provided by 
the sponsor.  
Based on the above -mentioned large -scale data from these randomized controlled 
clinical studies, the main adv erse reactions are hand and foot skin reactions, 
hypertension, elevated transaminases, elevated bilirubin, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, esophagitis, nausea, and fatigue, most of which are mild 
to moderate reactions.

1.2.4.1. Potential Mechanisms of Combination Administration and P reclinical 
Studies  
The VEGFR signaling pathway plays an important role in mediating tumor immune escape, and inhibition of this pathway may enhance the activation of tumor immunity by PD -1 antibodies. 
Preclinical data from Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals  Co., Ltd. suggested that SHR -
1210 combined with rivoceranib  could significantly  reduce the regulatory T cell (T
reg) 
levels in peripheral blood and increase the ratio of effector T cell (T eff) to T reg. 
The results of animal studies showed that SHR -1210 combined with rivoceranib  
significantly enhanced the tumor growth inhibition of SHR -1210 without increasing 
significant toxicity (no significant change in animal body weight):

1.2.4.2. Exploration of C ombination Administration in P reliminary Clinical 
Studies  
Since October 2016, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals  Co., Ltd. has served as a funder 
or sponsor to conduct a number of clinical trials of SHR -1210 combined with 
rivoceranib  mesylate, involving a variety of solid tumors such as advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma, advanced lung cancer, advanced intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma, advanced gastric adenocarcinoma and advanced triple- negative 
breast cancer. These studies explored the safety and  tolerance of SHR -1210 combined 
with rivoceranib  mesylate and the initial efficacy against a variety of tumors.  
Preliminary results confirm: for SHR -1210 200 mg fixed dose, once every two weeks 
(Q2W ) combined with rivoceranib  mesylate 250 mg/d, continuous oral dose level is 
tolerable, while the combination regimen for a variety of tumors have shown a 
significant efficacy, significantly increasing the proportion of subjects benefiting from 
treatment .

The dose -response relationship analysis was performed on the safety and efficacy data 
of three phase I studies of SHR -1210- 101, SHR -1210- 102 and SHR -1210- 103. This 
analysis defines SHR -1210 (ORR+DCR)/2 as the efficac y index and (number of 
subjects with at least one drug -related AE + skin and subcutaneous tissue disease)/2 as 
the safety index.  Figure  4 shows that the efficacy index reaches a steady state at a dose 
of 200 mg Q2W; the safety index increases with the dose. The optimal benefit dose for 
subject s can be defined as the dose with the least severe side effects in the case of 
maximum efficacy. The efficacy ind ex and safety index show that 200 mg Q2W is the 
best benefit dose for subject s.

In one exploratory clinical study on SHR -1210 combined with rivoceranib  mesylate in 
treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer  [20.] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), 
the tolerability of SHR -1210 200 mg at the fixed dose of once every two weeks ( Q2W ) 
combined with rivoceranib  mesylate 125  mg/d, 250 mg/d or 500  mg/d for continuous 
administration was observed, and the results showed that rivoceranib 125 mg QD po 
combined with SHR -1210 200 mg Q2W was well tolerated  without  dose-limiting 
toxicity (DLT); 3/5 subjects given rivoceranib  500 mg QD po combined with SHR -
1210 200 mg Q2W had Grade 3 immune -related pneumonia that could not be tolerated 
during observation of tolerability; 1/5 subject given rivoceranib 250 mg QD po 
combined with SHR -1210 200 mg Q2W had Grade  3 elevated lipase with no clinical 
symptoms during observation of tolerability, the symptoms disappeared after 
symptomatic treatment, see Table 4 for the detail.  
The observation of tolerability showed that rivoceranib  250mg/d po continuously 
combined with SHR -1210 200 mg, Q2W was tolerable in treatment of advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer and gastroesophageal junction carcinoma. 
This dose level was selected for efficacy extension in the study subsequently.

56 above studies, it has been decided that the clinically observed tolerable dose will be 
selected in the upcoming phase 3 studies on SHR -1210 combined with rivoceranib  
mesylate as the first- line therapy fo r advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: SHR -1210 
200 mg, Q2W combined with rivoceranib  250 mg QD po continuously as combined

1.2.4.4. Preliminary E fficacy of Combined Therapy  
In the exploratory clinical study on SHR -1210 combined with rivoceranib  mesylate for 
treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer, it was found through the efficacy extension in SHR -1210 200 mg, Q2W combined with rivoceranib  
250 mg QD continuously that this combined regimen had significant efficacy in 
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: in the 14 subjects with liver cancer enrolled at this 
dose level, there were 13 evaluable subjects (all positive HBV , including 12 subjects 
with failure of sorafenib), 7 subjects were evaluated as disease remission, the objective 
response rate (ORR) reached 53.8% and the remission was durable, no progression of disease was seen in 6 subjects with disease remission after treatment for 18 -72 weeks; 
PFS rate s of 6-month and 9- month w ere 51.3% (95% CI: 21.4, 74.9) and 41.0% (95% 
CI:13.8, 66.9)  respectively , and the  median PFS was 7.2 months (95% CI: 4.1,NR) , the 
preliminary efficacy was significant
[22]. 
 
Figure  5. The Best Response of SHR -1210 Combined with  Rivoceranib  in 
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Change in the Diameter of Target 
Lesions After Administration  
Above preliminary data demonstrated that compared with current  therapeutic regimen, 
such as sorafenib, the ORR was <10% ; while  the ORR of Nivolumab treatment for 
advanced HCC after sorafenib exposure  was 14.3%, DCR  was 55% . Per above 
preliminary results,  SHR -1210 combined with rivoceranib  mesylate looks  having an 
obvious advantage in treatment of advanced HCC .  
In summary, under the selected dose, SHR -1210 combined with rivoceranib  had a good 
tolerability and significant preliminary efficacy observed in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The randomized, control led study of SHR -1210 combined with rivoceranib  
versus sorafenib in uncurable HCC  is expected to achieve positive outcome and provide 
a more effective therapeutic option for vast subject s with HCC .

57 1.2.5. Selection R ationale of C ontrol Arm 
Sorafenib was approved by the FDA as a targeted therapy for HCC in 2007. Sorafenib 
is an oral multitarget inhibitor  (VEGFR -1, -2, -3, PDGFR and c -KIT)  that blocks tumor 
neovascularization and inhibits tumor growth directly. The approval of sorafenib is 
based on the active results from SHARP and ORIENTAL trials. SHARP trial is a phase 
3 trial conducted mainly in  European and American subject s to compare the efficacy 
and safety of sorafenib versus placebo in treatment of advanced HCC. The resul ts 
showed a significantly improved survival in sorafenib group compared with placebo group. The ORIENTAL trial in parallel to SHARP trial enrolled subject s with advanced 
HCC in Asian -Pacific region using the same design. The results showed a similar 
signif icant improvement in survival with sorafenib in Asian subject s. A total of 3,371 
subject s with unresectable advanced HCC were enrolled in GIDEON study intended to 
acquire the clinical safety data of sorafenib. The results showed an OS of 13.6, 5.2 and 2.6 months, and median T TP of 4.7, 4.4 and 3.6 months in subject s with CHILD Grade 
A, B and C, indicating better benefit for earlier treatment with sorafenib.

To summary, sorafenib is recognized throughout the world as a first-line standard of 
care therapy for advanced HCC  and thus has been selected for comparison of first -line 
treatment of participants assigned to the control arm.  
1.3. Poten tial R isks and B enefits  
As described above, current therapies have limited efficacy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, only less than 10% of subject s can achieve response from the 1st -line 
therapy with sorafenib. Lenvatinib was  approved by the FDA in August 2018 as the 
first-line therapy for subject s with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and has not 
been widely used yet. The PD -1 antibodies  nivolumab and pembrolizumab that were 
approved in recent years have  achieved significant respo nse in the exploratory 
application in HCC. For example, for subject s with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
who have received sorafenib for treatment, the ORR  is 14.3% in those who have 
received PD -1 antibody ( nivolumab) and is superior to current therapeutic approaches. 
In particular, when PD -1/PD -L1 antibody is combined with anti -angiogenesis targeted 
drug, efficacy  is enhanced; moreover, the combined therapy is safe, well tolerated and 
can achieve a synergistic effect. SHR -1210 is one humanized PD -1 anti body that is 
independently researched and developed by Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals  Co., Ltd. 
The preclinical  data in animal experiments  showed a similar affinity and antitumor 
effect with nivolumab and pembrolizumab. At the same time, SHR -1210 combined with 
rivoceranib  has achieved an encouraging preliminary result in treatment of advanced

58 hepatocellular carcinoma. Participation in the phase 3 study to receive the study drug 
may provide clinical benefit to subject s with advanced HCC  and offer  a useful 
therapeutic option for them .  
1.3.1. Known P otential R isks 
In the previous clinical studies for multiple solid tumors (including HCC) and 
hematological tumors, the most common  (≥ 10%) adverse reactions induced by SHR -
1210 included: reactive capillary endothelial proliferation (RCEP), various rashes, 
immune endocrine dysfunction such as hyperthyroidism/hypothyroidism, fatigue, elevated transaminase, most of which were Grade 1 -2 and could be recovered after 
symptomatic treatment or dose interruption, had r elatively small effect on subject ’s 
physiological function and quality of life, and did not hinder continuation of the study  
treatment . RCCEP is a unique skin reaction of SHR -1210. Although with a relatively 
high incidence in the SHR -1210 monotherapy, RCEP  was relatively mild in severity 
and clinically tolerable, and could be recovered after discontinuation of the drug . 
Moreover, in the treatment of SHR -1210 combined with rivoceranib , the incidence of 
RCEP was significantly reduced, which may be related to the anti -angiogenic effect of 
rivoceranib . The most c ommon serious adverse reactions of SHR -1210 include 
pneumonitis , abnormal liver function, lung infection and thrombocytopenia. Various 
immune -related adverse reactions are potential risks of SHR -1210, which are class 
effects of PD -1 antibody preparations and include pneumonitis , hepatitis, thyroiditis, 
myocarditis, enteritis,  severe cutaneous adverse reactions (including Stevens –Johnson 
syndrome  (SJS) , toxic epidermal necrolysis  (TEN) ) etc. Symptomatic treatment will be 
given in accordance with EMSO/NCCN guideline on management of immunotoxicity and can ensure the safety of subject s during the trial. Please refer to the investigator ’s 
brochure  for more details on adverse drug reactions  associated with SHR -1210. 
Rivoceranib  mesylate tablets were approved by the Chinese drug regulatory authorities 
for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer in October 2014. The recommended initial dose is 850 mg, orally, once daily. The most c ommon (≥ 10%) adverse reactions of 
rivoceranib  (850 mg QD) are hand and foot skin reactions, hypertension, elevated 
transaminases, elevated bilirubi n, elevated alkaline phosphatase, elevated γ -glutamyl 
transferase, proteinuria, diarrhea, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, etc., most of which are mild to moderate reactions and can be recovered or improved after 
the drug is temporarily discontinued and treatment is given. In addition, the use of rivoceranib  requires special attention to events that have a low incidence but may  cause 
serious consequences or even deaths, including various types of bleeding and thrombotic events, cardiotoxicity (QT interval prolongation, arrhythmia) and liver toxicity. Please refer to the investigator ’s brochure for more details on adverse drug 
reactions associated with rivoceranib  mesylate. Currently, the known safety information 
on rivoceranib  mesylate mainly c omes from the experience of dose regimen of 850 mg 
QD, and the experience of 250 mg QD is relatively limited.  
Although the mechanism of action for SHR -1210 and rivoceranib  is completely 
different, their pharmacological effects may extensively affect multip le organ systems 
of the body. Based on the preliminary safety data, and given that there could be overlapped adverse reactions associated with both drugs during the treatment of SHR -
1210 in combination with rivoceranib 250 mg QD, overlapped adverse reactions that 
require the investigator ’s special attention include but not limited to: severe cutaneous

In the two currently ongoing phase II clinical studies in subject s with advanced HCC, 
the efficacy  has been preliminarily shown for SHR -1210 alone or SHR -1210 in 
combination with rivoceranib. So the HCC subject s enrolled in this study may achieve 
partial or even complete response, and some subject s may obtain sustained stable 
disease. The above trial data will provide a strong guidance for the clinical practice fo r 
HCC treatment and allow more subject s to access and benefit from new therapeutic 
methods .

3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1. Overall D esign  
This is a randomized, open- label, international, multi- center, phase 3 trial to evalua te 
the efficacy and safety of PD -1 antibody SHR -1210 plus rivoceranib  mesylate versus 
sorafenib as first -line therapy in subject s with incurable advanced HCC.  
The study will be conducted in subjects with incurable, locally advanced or meta static 
HCC who did not receive systematic treatment previously. Prima ry efficacy endpoints 
include both OS and PFS evaluated by the BIRC based on RECIST v1.1, and 
approximately 510 subjects will be enrolled. Eligible subjects will be randomized to 
receive either SHR -1210 combined with rivoceranib  mesylate (experimental arm) or 
sorafenib (control arm) in a 1:1 ratio. 
The stratification factors for randomization include:  
1. Macrov ascular invasion and/or extrahepat ic metastasis ( presence vs. absen ce) 
2. Geographical region (Asia vs. countries outside of Asia)  
3. Baseline AFP (AFP  < 400 ng/ mL vs. AFP  ≥ 400 ng/ mL) 
Subjects will receive study treatment after being informed of all pertinent aspects of the 
study, signing the informed consent form and passing the screening for eligibility. Experimental arm: SHR -1210, 200 mg, via intravenous infusion, once every two weeks 
(Q2W) + rivoceranib 250 mg, p.o., once per day (QD), continuously, 4 weeks (28 days) 
per cycle of therapy. Control arm: sorafenib, 400 mg, p.o., twice per day (BID), 
continuously, 28 days per cycle of therapy. Study treatment will continue until the subject develops an intolerable toxicity, withdrawing informed consent, and disease 
progression confirmed by BIRC according to RECIST v1.1 (when the subject has disease progression assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, the investigator must su bmit the radiological  data to BIRC immediately. If BIRC evaluates 
it as non- disease progression according to RECIST v1.1, the subject should continue to 
receive the study drug treatment and continue the tumor radiological evaluation; if 
BIRC confirms it as  disease progression based on RECIST V1.1, at this time, the 
investigator needs to assess whether the subject still has clinical benefit. If the subject is considered to still have clinical benefit and meet the criteria for treatment beyond  
disease progresses (see Section  6.6 for details), the subject may continue to receive 
study medication; if the subject is no longer considered to have clinical benefit, the treatment may be discontinued), or other termination criteria specified by the protocol, whichever occurs first.  
Subjects will have safety visits on D1 and D15 of each cycle of therapy within the first 3 cycles for both experimental and control  arms. Beginning from the cycle  4, subjects 
will have safety visits on D1 and D15 of each cycle in the experimental arm; subjects in the control arm will only have safety visits on D1 of each cycle ; refer to  the

survival follow -up after the end-  of- treatment. The study design is shown in Figure  6. 
 
Figu re 6. Study Design Chart  
Tumor radiological  evaluation will be  performed every 8 weeks (56 days) ± 7 days from 
the randomization through the first 48 weeks, to assess the efficacy, and every 12 weeks 
(84 days) ± 7 days after 48 weeks. During the trial period, radiological  examination and 
evaluation can be added at an y time if clinically indicated. Tumor radiological  
assessment will continue until the occurrence of disease progression confirmed by BIRC according to RECIST v1.1 criteria or study  treatment  discontinuation, whichever 
occurs later. Subjects who discontinue  treatment for reasons  other  than BIRC -
confirmed disease progression (according to RECIST v1.1) will also continue with  
regular follow -up by tumor radiological  assessments after study treatment is 
discontinued. 
If the subject withdraws informed consent bef ore BIRC confirms disease progression 
according to the RECIST v1.1 criteria  or the study treatment is discontinued, other anti -
tumor treatment has begun (except for traditional Chinese medicine) , or the subject dies, 
there is no need to continue the radiol ogical  evaluation. If the subject does not meet the 
above criteria to stop radiological  assessment , the efficacy evaluation of the three 
efficacy evaluation criteria (RECIST v1.1, mRECIST, imRECIST) needs to continue 
even if the disease progression under c ertain efficacy evaluation criteria occurs.  
Upon approval of Protocol v6.0, disease progression will be confirmed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1. If the investigator confirms non -disease progression, the 
subject should continue on study treatment and tumor radiological evaluation as 
required; if the investigator confirms as disease progression, the subject may continue to receive study treatment after disease progression at the investigator ’s discretion  (see 
Section 6.6).

64 purpose of the extension phase is to continue to provide access to  study drugs for 
subjects who are still on study treatment and still derive clinical  benefit at the time of 
end of study . Upon initiation of the extension phase, the Sponsor considers the safety 
and efficacy profile of the experimental treatment regimen within this study to have 
been sufficiently established and data analysis required for regulatory purposes to have been completed. The Sponsor will notify the sites when will the study e nter the 
extension phase. 
In the extension phase, subjects randomized in the experimental arm will continue on 
SHR -1210 in combination with rivoceranib, and subjects randomized in the control 
arm may have the option to crossover to receive experimental treatment and the decision made is upon investigator ’s clinical judgment. S ubjects  who are not eligible 
to crossover to experimental treatment per investigator clinical judgment  can continue 
on sorafenib treatment.  Subjects will continue to re ceive study trea tment until they are 
no longer benefiting from treatment as assessed by investigator ’s clinical judgment . 
The study clinical database will be closed  at the  initiation of the extension phase. 
Important safety information collection in the extension phase will be captured in the safety database.  Only data collected prior to implementation of extension phase will 
be summarized  in the  clinical study report.

4.3. Randomization C riteria  
Subjects who enter screening and meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria after signing the informed consent form , will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to SHR -1210 combined with 
rivoceranib  mesylate group (experimental arm) or sorafenib group (control arm). 
Randomization str atification factors are as follows : 
1. Macrov ascular invasion and/or extrahepatic metastasis ( presence vs. absen ce) 
2. Geographical region (Asia vs. countries outside of Asia)  
3. Baseline AFP (AFP  < 400 ng/ mL vs. AFP  ≥ 400 ng/ mL) 
4.4. Lifestyle  Requir ements  
4.4.1. Contraception  
Male subjects with azoospermia (due to vasectomy or other underlying disease) and partners do not need to take contraception.  
Female subjects are considered as not of childbearing potential if:  
(1) Postmenopausal (defined as absence of menses  for at least 12 months without other 
medical reasons; female subjects younger than 45 years of age without hormonal

70 contraception or hormone replacement therapy whose  follicle -stimulating hormone 
(FSH) levels reached postmenopausal levels) . However , in the absence of 12 months of 
amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient ; 
Or  
(2) having hysterectomy and/or bilateral ovariectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or 
bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion surgery at least 6 weeks prior to screening;  
Or  
(3) the  presence of congenital or acquired conditions leading to infertility.  
Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects with partners who are women of childbearing potential are required to use  to contraception and follow one of 
the following contraception requirements, from the time the subject signs the informed consent until at least 120 days after the last dose of study drug:  
(1) Abstinence (avoid heterosexual intercourse) †.  
Or 
(2) us e a reliable and effective method of contraception during heterosexual intercourse.  
Reliable, effective methods of contraception include:  
Single method of contraception (any one of the following methods):  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Subcutaneous implant contraception  
Two methods combined contraception (two of the  following methods must be used 
simultaneously):  
• Vaginal diaphragm/spermicide (cannot be combined with cervical 
cap/spermicide) *  
• Cervical cap/spermicide (only for women who have not given birth) *  
• Contraceptive sponge (only for women who have not given birth) *  
• Male condom or female condom (not used concurrently)  
• Hormonal contraception: Oral contraceptives (estrogen/progesterone or progesterone), contraceptive patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous 
injection contraceptives  
† For those who choose to completely not have a sexual life, abstinence (avoiding  
heterosexual intercourse) can be used alone for contraception. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,  
based on ovulation, symptomatology etc.) and external ejaculation are not reliable and effective contrac eption. 
In addition, the subject needs to be aware that once he/she stops using the selected contraceptive method, or he/she or his/her partner is suspected or confirmed to be pregnant, the investigators need to be notified immediately.

Treatment  
4.5.1. Criteria for Discontinuation  of S tudy Treatment 
Discontinuation of study treatment do  not represent withdrawal from the study. Subjects 
who discontinue d study treatment should continue to complete the remaining study 
visits as required in the protocol. Subjects should discontinue  study treatment when any 
of the following conditions occurs :  
 Subject requests discontinuation of study treatment;  
 Efficacy ev aluation meets  criteria for progression of disease confirmed by 
BIRC (according to RECIST v1.1 ), unless investigator  consider s the subject 
still has clinical benefit and meets the criteria for  treatment beyond progression 
(Disease progression will be confirmed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1 
upon approval of Protocol v6.0; other procedures and criteria remain 
unchanged , see Section 6.6 of th e protocol);  
 Pregnancy in female subject occurs during the study;  
 Unacceptable toxicity despite dose modification , or occurrence of adverse 
event, abnormal laboratory examination , or co ncomitant diseases, then it is no 
longer in the best interests of the subjects to continue study treatment according 
to the judgment of the investigator ;   
 Overall deterioration of health status, inability to continue participation in the trial;  
 Significant protocol deviation or violations confirmed  by sponsor, e .g., 
inelig ibility of subjects after enrollment;  
 Termination of study by the sponsor;  
 Other reasons for inability to continue study treatment, as considered by investigators.
  
4.5.2. Criteria for Withdrawal f rom the S tudy  
Subjects can withdraw from the study voluntarily a t any time, or at the request of the 
investigator or the sponsor for safety or behavioral reasons, or inability to comply with the visit schedule or procedure required in the protocol at his/her study site . 
The reasons for withdrawal from the study may inc lude:  
 Withdrawal of the informed consent on participation in the study, and refusal of further follow -up;  
 Any conditions which require subject ’s withdrawal, per  Investigator ’s 
discretion  e.g., subject ’s loss of the ability to express his/her wishes freely d ue 
to imprisonment or segregation ;  
 Lost to follow -up;  
 Termination of study by the sponsor .

HENGRUI CONFIDENTIAL  
72 4.5.3. The Procedures of Withdrawal from the S tudy or Discontinuation  of 
Study Treatment  
Subjects should comply with the follow -up schedule specified in the protocol after 
discontinuation of study treatment. The efficacy and safety examination specified in the 
protocol at the end of treatment, and safety follow -up should be completed, and the full 
records of AEs and outcomes, concomitant medications/therapy should be provided. 
Investigators can advise or provide new or alternative therapeutic method to subjects according to their actual condition. The subjects with no progression of disease need to continue the radiological evaluation according to the scheduled frequency and time, until start of a new antitumor therapy or progression of disease. The radiological 
evidence on progression  of disease should be obtained as much as possible for such 
subject s.  
If subject refuses to return to the site for further visit, his/he r survival status shoul d still 
be followed up, unless the subject withdraws the consent on disclosure of further information or continuous contact. If the subject requests withdrawal from the study clearly, the investigator should record the extent of subj ect’s request on withdrawal 
from the study procedure in a written form, i.e., only withdrawal from study treatment and/or withdrawal from post -treatment follow -up. When it is necessary to know  the 
survival state, only the publicly available information should be used appropriately to determine whether the subject survives.  
4.5.4. Lost to F ollow -Up 
Every possible effort must be made to know and report the subject ’s status, including 
contact with the subject. Los t to follow -up is defined as no response to at least three 
contacts. The contact method include s but is not limited to any of the following: 
telephone, fax, message, social media tools  and email. All the attempts to make contact 
should be recorded  in the medical document. If the subject  is confirmed to be dead,  the 
study center  will use a permitted method to acquire the information on death and cause 
of death. The study center can also utilize  public resources, for example, community 
health registry  and database,  to obtain the  contact information . If the su bject ’s status 
can still not be acquired  after all the attempts  have been made, investigators should 
report  the last date when  the subject is known to  be survived and record it  in the medical 
record.  
4.6. Early Termination or S uspension of Study  
The study can be terminated or interrupted prematurely if the reason is sufficient. This may be due to the decision of regulatory agency, IRB/EC ’s opinion, Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC) ’s opinion, or efficacy or safety issues of the investigational product, 
or base on  the sponsor ’s judgment. In addition, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals  Co., 
Ltd. reserves the right to stop research and development of SHR -1210 at any time. The 
party who makes the decision on termination/interruption of the study will send a written notice which records the reason for study termination or interruption to 
investigators, sponsor and regulatory authorities. Investigators should notify the ethics  
committee and the sponsor immediately and provide relevant reasons. 
The reasons for premature  termination or interruption of the study may include:

Investigators or their authorized representatives (e.g., pharmacist) will ensure all the investigational products are stored in a controlled secure area that meets the storage conditions (see storage conditions in Section 5.1.2), and the storage is in accordance 
with the requirements of applicable laws.  
The study center must be able to record the highest and lowest temperatures per working day for al l study drugs storage locations (e.g., freezing, cold storage or room 
temperature). The cycle of recording should start with receiving drugs until all the remaining study drugs are recovered. Even though there is a continuous monitoring system, the study c enter should also keep record logs to ensure the correct storage 
temperature. The temperature monitoring devices and storage devices (e.g., freezer ) 
should be checked on a regular basis, as to ensure it functions normally.  
Any deviations  from the recommen ded storage conditions on the product label should 
be reported promptly to the sponsor . The study center should take active measures as

SHR -1210 SHR -1210 intravenous infusion at a dose of 200 mg  over 30 
minutes (no less than 20 minutes and no more than 60 minute s, 
including a wash- out period), once every two weeks (Q2W), one 
treatment cycle is 4 weeks (28 days ). Complete administration 
before ECG if possible. The interval between two doses should not 
be less than 12 days.  
On the day of rivoceranib PK blood sampling, rivoceranib 
should be administrated at the study center before SHR -1210, 
see SCHEDULE OF ACTIVITI ES and BLOOD SAMPLE 
COLLECTION TABLE  for details.  
Control arm : 
Sorafenib  Sorafenib  400 mg, twice per day (BID), orally under fasted state (at least 1  
hour prior to a meal or 2 h ours after a meal), for continuous 
administration, one treatment cycle is 4 weeks ( or 28 days) . 
 
If a subject in the experimental arm (SHR -1210 in combination with rivoceranib ) 
develops a treatment -related AE that leads to permanent discontinuation of rivoceranib  
and the investigator determines that the subject can benefit from SHR -1210 
monotherapy, the subjects may continue to receive SHR -1210 monotherapy until 
meeting the criteria for study treatment discontinuation as  specified in this protocol, 
and vice versa.  In addition, during the study treatment period, if a subject in the 
experimental arm develops a treatment -related AE that leads to temporary 
discontinuation of SHR -1210 or rivoceranib, the subject may continue to receive 
monotherapy, and the combination t herapy can be resumed only after the toxicity 
resolves . 
Study treatment will continue until the subject develops an intolerable toxicity, 
withdraw al of informed consent, and disease progression confirmed by BIRC according 
to RECIST v1.1 (when the subject appears to have met the criteria for disease

76 progression assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, the investigator 
must submit the radiological  data to BIRC immediately. If BIRC evaluates it as non -
disease progression according to RECIST v1.1, the subject should continue to receive the study drug treatment and continue the tumor radiological  evaluation; if BIRC 
confirms it as disease progres sion based on RECIST V1.1, at this time, the investigator 
needs to assess whether the subject still has clinical benefit. If the subject is considered to still have clinical benefit and meets  the criteria for continuing treatment after the 
disease progress es [see Section  6.6 for details ] the subject may continue to receive study 
treatment ; if the subject is no longer considered to have clinical benef it , the treatment 
may be discontinued),or other discontinuation criteria specified in the protocol, 
whichever occurs first. Administration 3 days after the date of intended SHR -1210 
administration will be considered as delayed administration. Upon the approval of 
protocol v6.0, disease progression will be only judged by investigator per RECIST v1.1.  
If a subject missed a dose of rivoceranib and it was ≥ 12 hours away from next plan ned 
dose, the rivoceranib dose should be made up  on current day , if < 12 hours away from 
next plan ned dose, that dose should be skipped and dosing resumed at  subsequent dose 
as planned, without doubling the dose of the next day. If a subject receives an overdose 
of rivoceranib, contact the investigator immediately.  
If a subject misse d a dose of sorafenib at a scheduled  timepoint, the missed dose will 
not be made up and the next dose should be taken as planned. If the subject has an 
overdose of sorafenib, contact the investigator immediately.  
Any vomit ing after administr ation with sorafenib or rivoceranib should not be made up.

Dose adjustment is not allowed for SHR -1210, only dose interruption is allowed.  
5.1.6.1.2. Criteria for  SHR -1210 Dose D elay 
The dose of SHR -1210 should be delayed if the following conditions occur:  
• Any ≥ Grade 2 drug -related non -cutaneous AE, except Grade 2 drug -related fatigue 
or laboratory abnormalities  (unless otherwise specified) ;  
• Any Grade 3 drug -related cutaneous AE;  
• Any Grade 3 drug -related laboratory abnormalities, except Grade 3 abnormal 
amylase or lipase unrelated with the symptoms and clinical manifestations of pancreatitis;  
• The administration will be delayed if  the following AST , ALT or total bilirubin  
abnormalities occur:  
– AST and ALT at baseline are within the normal range, and drug- related 
elevated AST or ALT reaches >3×ULN;  
– AST or ALT at baseline elevates  no greater than Grade 1, and drug -related

77 elevated AST or ALT reaches >5×ULN;  
– AST or ALT at baseline elevates  no greater than Grade 2, and drug -related 
elevated AST or ALT reaches >2 times the baseline or either AST or ALT 
reaches > 8×ULN (whichever is low er); 
– Total  bilirubin at baseline is within the normal range, and drug -related elevated 
total bilirubin reaches  >2×ULN;  
– Total  bilirubin at baseline elevates  no greater than Grade 1, and drug -related 
elevated total bilirubin reaches > 2 times the  baseline.  
• The administration needs to be delayed for any AE, laboratory abnormalities or 
complications, as judged by investigators;  
• If RCEP occur s during the trial, refer  to APPENDIX 7  for detailed suggestions on 
grade and management  of RCEP . 
• If subjects have fever (>38°C) and need medication, or obvious symptoms of 
asthma, shortness of breath, and asphyxia  during the trial , SHR -1210 will not be 
given any more at this or next scheduled time point before the symptom is 
recovered. SHR -1210 will be resumed after the symptom is relieved and stabilized 
for more than 7 days, and pneumonia will be excluded through radiological exam ination prior to administration if necessary.   
Subjects who need delayed dose should be monitored every week, and the frequency of monitoring can be increased if clinically indicated. It is recommended to monitor liver 
function every three days, until the highest value of AST or ALT starts to decrease. When meeting the criteria for resumption of medication (see Section  5.1.6.1.3), the 
study drug can be resumed.  
Tumor evaluation still needs to proceed for all subjects, as required in the protocol, regardless of dose delay. During the period of dose delay, saf ety visits and laboratory 
examinations should also be performed as planned in the protocol, or  more frequently 
when clinically indicated ( see SCHEDULE OF ACTIVITI ES Footnote  [4]).  
5.1.6.1.3. Criteria for  Resumption of SHR -1210  
When drug- related AE recover to Grade 1 (or lower grade) or baseline level, SHR -1210 
study treatment can be resumed, except the following:  
• The therapy  can be resumed for the subjects with Grade 2 fatigue that has not been 
recovered;  
• The therapy can be resumed for Grade 2 cutaneous AE;  
• Subjects with AST, ALT or TBIL grade  1 elevation at baseline, and delayed SHR -
1210 for reasons other than drug -related hepatic AE, the therapy can be resumed in 
the presence of AST, ALT or TBIL Grade 2 elevation s; 
• As the subjects who delay the dose for drug related elevated AST, ALT or TBIL, 
when these parameters are recovered to baselin e CTCAE grade or normal (see 
Section 5.1.6.1.4) but who have not reached the criteria for  permanent 
discontinuation of the treatment, the study drug s can be resumed ;

78 • The therapy can be resumed for drug related grade 2 laboratory abnormalities in 
GGT and/or ALP  increase;  
• In case the drug related endocrine disorder can be sufficiently controlled only with 
hormone  replacement at physiological dose, the  treatment can be resumed.  
The dose of SHR -1210 is allowed to be delayed for up to 12 weeks, as calculated from 
the last dose. In case the subject still does not reach the criteria for dose resumption 
after delay for 12 weeks, the study drug needs to be discontinued permanently, except 
the exception mentioned in the Section 5.1.6.1.4 . The guideline on management of 
adverse reactions is seen in APPENDIX 6  in detail. Rules for hepatic AEs management 
can be referred to in Section  5.1.6.2.2. 
5.1.6.1.4. Criteria for  Permanent Discontinuation of SHR -1210 
The study drug SHR -1210 must be discontinued permanently when the following 
conditions occur:  
• Any Grade Stevens -Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis ; 
• Any Grade 2 drug -related uveitis, ophthalmodynia and blurred vision that has no 
response to lo cal therapy and is not recovered to Grade 1 after delayed dose; or the 
above AE requiring systemic therapy;  
• Any Grade 3 drug -related non -cutaneous AE lasting for >7 days, except the 
following:  
- When any Grade 3 drug -related uveitis, myocarditis , encephali tis, pneumonia, 
bronchospasm, hypersensitivity or infusion reaction occurs, the study treatment must be terminated;  
- In case the drug -related endocrine disorders can be sufficiently controlled only 
with hormone replacement therapy at physiological doses, t he treatment does 
not need to be terminated;  
- The treatment does not need to be terminated for Grade 3 drug -related 
abnormal laboratory examination, however, the study drug must be terminated for Grade 3 thrombocytopenia >7 days or related with bleeding .  
• Hepatotoxicity meeting the following:  
- AST or ALT >10 times of ULN for over two weeks;  
- ALT or AST  >15 × ULN;  
- TBIL >8 times of ULN for subjects with elevated TBIL at baseline, >5 times 
of ULN for subjects with normal TBIL at baseline.  
• Any Grade 4 drug -related AE or abnormal laboratory examination, except the 
following:  
- Grade 4 granulocytopenia is less than7 days;  
- Grade 4 lymphopenia or leukopenia;

79 - Isolated Grade  4 electrolyte imbalance/abnormality without clinical sequela 
that could be corrected through supplement s/appropriate management within 
72h after occurrence;  
- If Grade 4 drug -related endocrine disorders that can be sufficiently controlled 
only with hormone replacement therapy at physiological doses, the treatment 
does not need to be discontinued.  
• The study treatment must be discontinued if SHR -1210 needs to be delayed 
for >12 weeks, except the following:  
- After the use of cortisol for  treatment of drug -related AEs, the dose of 
SHR -1210 is allowed to be delayed for >12 weeks due to the need for dose 
tapering. Discussion with the sponsor must be made before resuming the dose. 
During the dose delay, tumor assessment should continue as required by the 
protocol. Safety visits and laboratory tests should also be performed at the 
original frequency or more frequently if clinically indicated (see SCHEDULE 
OF ACTIVITIES  Footnote [4] ); 
- SHR -1210 delay for >12 weeks due to non- drug related reasons must be 
discussed with the sponsor prior to resuming treatment. During the dose delay, the tumor evaluation should still proceed as required in the protocol. Safety 
visits and laboratory examinations should also be performed as planned in the 
protocol or more frequently when clinically indicated ( see SCHEDULE OF 
ACTIVITIES  Footnote  [4]); 
• For intolerable or persistent Grade 2 drug -related AE, the dose of SHR -1210 can 
be interrupted as appropriate, if the treatment -related toxicity can not be 
recovered to Grade 0 -1 12 weeks after the last dose of SHR -1210, the drug should 
be discontinued permanently.  
• If any drug -related AE (except endocrine lesions) of ≥ Grade 3 (≥ Grade 2 for 
pneumonia) reoccurs, discontinuation of the study treatment can be considered, 
which may be judged by the investigator according to the condition of each subject ; 
• Judged by investigators, clinical AE, laboratory abnormalities or complications 
may bring major risk to subjects who continue taking the study drug;  
• Progression of disease confirmed by BIRC  in accordance with RECIST v1.1 (see 
APPENDIX 2  for details) (unless the subject meets the criteria for treatment 
beyond progression in Section  6.6).  
Even though SHR -1210 is discontinued, subjects must continue to perform t umor 
evaluation as required in the protocol.  
After SHR -1210 is discontinued, subjects are allowed to continue rivoceranib  
monotherapy  if they are judged by investigators to be able to benefit from rivoceranib  
monotherapy, until occurrence of the events which meet the criteria for discontinuation 
of treatment specified in the protocol.  
5.1.6.1.5. Criteria for  Dose M odification of Rivoceranib  
Dose modification methods resulted from rivoceranib -related toxicities include dose 
interruption, adjustment of administration schedule (first adjustment: take 5 days

adjustment: once every other day [QOD]) and termination of rivoceranib. A fter the 
administration schedule of rivoceranib  is adjusted during the study, will not allow going 
back to initial administration schedule.  
If rivoceranib- related AEs definitely occur during the trial, for example, hypertension, 
proteinuria, hand- foot syndrome, rivoceranib  can be interrupted; when the toxicity is 
recovered, maintenance of dose at the current dose  level, adjustment of administration 
schedule or discontinuation of dose can be given as appropriate. The subject can 
continue to receive SHR -1210 monotherapy after rivoceranib  is discontinued. 
Referring to the experience in phase II clinical studies, the investigator must interrupt 
the dose of SHR -1210 and rivoceranib  at the same time  (See Section 5.1.6.1.2 criteria 
for SHR -1210 dose delay reference) , for the confirmed  immune -related toxicities 
during the trial, in particular immune pneumonia /pneumonitis , hepatitis, increased AST, 
ALT, bilirubin, diarrhea  or colitis , increased creatinine. T he dose can be resumed when 
the toxicity is recovered to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline level (for subject s with abnor mal ALT , 
AST and TBIL during baseline). It is recommended to resume SHR -1210 first, and then 
administer rivoceranib after 7 -14 days of no significant  abnormality observed after 
administration of SHR -1210. The subsequent administration schedule for rivoceranib 
will be adjusted (first adjustment: 5 days on 2 days off  [5 on 2 off] ; re-adjustment: once 
every other day [QOD]).  
Changes in blood pressure should be monitored routinely during rivoceranib  
administration. It is advisable to interrupt the dose of rivoceranib  firstly in case Grade  
3 elevated blood pressure occurs (systolic blood pressure ≥  160mmHg or diastolic blood 
pressure ≥ 100mmHg or more than one antihypertensive agent is needed) and perform 
antihypertensive therapy under specialist ’s instructions. Rivoceranib  can be resumed 
when the blood pressure is decreased to normal range (systolic blood pressure <  140 
mmHg and diastolic blood pressure <  90 mmHg). If there is still hypertension, the 
administration schedule of rivoceranib must be adjusted. For subject s with hypertensive 
crisis (systolic blood pressure ≥  180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥  120mmHg, 
and/or with progressive insufficiency of target organs), the rivoceranib  should be 
discontinued immediately and symptomatic treatment should be giv en actively 
(antihypertension, dehydration, anti -convulsion and so on).  
Dose interruption use and adjustment of administration schedule of rivoceranib  is 
needed for ≥  Grade 3 hematological toxicities or ≥  Grade 2 non- hematological 
toxicities; for the non- hematological toxicities, symptomatic treatment can be given 
actively for controllable nausea, vomiting and fever with determined cause (<38oC), 
with no need of immediate dose interruption or adjustment of administration schedule .  
Symptomatic treatment sh ould be given promptly for the symptom/sign or laboratory 
abnormalities during the trial, and it is recommended to refer to the following table for 
corresponding dose modification :

83 For the significant toxicity that is still ongoing after symptomatic treatment during the 
trial, including Grade 2 non- hematological toxicities lasting for two weeks or more 
(except asymptomatic Grade 2 hypertension), laboratory abnormalities (except 
prote inuria <2g/24h), investigators can consider dose interruption based on the 
subject ’s tolerability, and adjust the administration schedule of rivoceranib  
subsequently after the toxicities are recovered.  
During the study, in combination with the recommendat ions on the dose adjustment 
above, investigators can give appropriate dose adjustment through comprehensive analysis of the occurrence of drug -related toxicities (e.g., multiple Grade 2 toxicities 
related with the study drug, poor intolerability to study d rug), and can consider adjust 
the administration schedule of rivoceranib  after dose interruption and recovery of the 
toxicity .  
5.1.6.1.6. Criteria for  Dose M odification of Sorafenib  
Subjects receiving sorafenib will be given 400 mg (two  tablets , 200 mg per tablet)  orally, 
twice per day, under  fasted state (at least 1 hour  prior to meal or at least 2  hours after  a 
meal) with a cup of warm drinking  water.  
Dose adjustment resulted from drug- related toxicities include dose interruption, dose 
reduction and discontinuati on. When dose reduction is required during treatment, 
sorafenib should be reduc ed to 400 mg once per day, if additional  dose reduction is 
required, could refer to  the locally approved drug label  or local standard of care 
practice/treatment guideline . It is  not allowed for dose level less than 400mg every other 
day. The criteria for interruption or discontinuation of sorafenib can be found in the 
label of sorafenib tosylate tablets  approved by the local health authority  in detail or 
local standard of care pr actice/treatment guideline . For any dose interruption, sorafenib 
treatment can be interrupted for up to 30 days.  
Cutaneous toxicities are the most common adverse reactions of sorafenib. Cutaneous 
related d ose modification refer to  Table 9 or based on the sorafenib label of approved 
by the local healt h authority. Other toxicities related dose modification s refer to 
sorafenib label approved by the local healt h authority.  
In principle, dose escalation  is not allowed;  however, in accordance with the package 
insert of sorafenib tosylate tablet approved by the FDA, “ Following improvement of 
Grade 2 or 3 dermatologic toxicity to Grade 0–1 after at least 28 da ys of treatment on a

The AEs induced by Immuno- Oncology (I -O) drugs vary from other type s of antitumor 
drugs, the severity and duration are special. SHR -1210 belongs to this type of drugs, 
thus it is required to achieve early identification and management of the AEs induced 
by it, in order to reduce the incidence of serious toxicities. To ide ntify I-O drug related 
AEs, the investigator may refer to the following definition and diagnosis of immune -
related colitis, pneumonitis  and hepatitis:  
Definition of immune -related colitis: A disorder characterized by inflammation of the 
colon. 
Diagnostic w ork-up of immune -related colitis suggested as follows : 
1) Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, hematochezia, weight loss, fever and 
vomiting . 
2) To rule out infection:  For Grade 2 AEs, work -up of blood (complete blood cell 
count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid -stimulating hormone , erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate, C -reactive protein) and stool  (bacterial culture, Clostridium 
difficile , parasites, viral etiology)  are recommended to be performed; radiological  
(e.g., CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis) as well as endoscopy and biopsy should 
be considered. For Grade 3- 4 AEs, all the work -up listed above for Grade 2 AEs 
should be completed immediately.

immunosuppressive agents . 
 
Definition of immune -related pneumo nitis: Focal or diffuse inflammation of the lung 
parenchyma (typically identified on CT radiological) . 
Diagnostic work- up of Immune -related pneumonitis suggested as follows:  
1) Respiratory  events like  cough and dyspnea ; 
2) Thoracic CT scan ; 
3) Hematology: including complete blood cell count, urea nitrogen, blood electrolytes, creatinine, liver function  tests, thyroid function tests, blood calcium, C -reactive 
protein, and erythrocyte se dimentation rate ; 
4) Infection should be ruled out by bronchoscopy, especially for ≥  Grade 2  AEs; 
5) Consider sputum sample and screening for viral, opportunistic or specific bacterial infections depending on the clinical context . 
 Definition of immune -related h epatitis: A disorder  characterized by a viral pathological 
process involving the liver parenchyma . 
Diagnostic work- up of immune -related hepatitis suggested as follows : 
1) Assessed for signs and symptoms of hepatitis;  
2) Transaminases and bilirubin measured before every cycle of treatment;  
3) If hepatitis develops, disease -related causes, concomitant drug administration 
(including alcohol) and infectious causes, particularly viral hepatitis, should be ruled out . Other thromboembolic and outflow obstructive etiol ogy should also be 
excluded through radiological ; 
4) Liver biopsy may be considered in assisting in the differential diagnosis of more severe hepatic reactions . 
In addition, the investigator may refer to the rules for  safety management  of similar 
products in overseas  markets  to facilitate evaluation and management of I-O drug 
related AEs occurring  in the following systems:  
• Gastrointestinal tract  
• Kidney

86 5.1.6.2.2. Principles of Management for Immune -Related Adverse Events  
In overall principle, according to the severity of adverse reaction, interruption of SHR -
1210 is taken as the main measure, resumption of SHR -1210 can be considered when 
the severity of adverse event has  recovered to Grade 1 or below, and SHR -1210 should 
be discontinued permanently when serious Grade 3 or life -threatening Grade 4 adverse 
event occurs (For details, refer to Sections 5.1.6.1.2, 5.1.6.1.3 and 5.1.6.1.4 of this 
protocol which state criteria for dose delay, dose resumption, and permanent 
discontinuation of SHR -1210). 
Management of immune -related adverse events should be based on the medical practice 
of the research center and the guidelines.  Recommended treatment procedures for 
common immune -related adverse events are detailed in APPENDIX 6  (Note that the 
rules for management of hepatic irAEs have been amended in this protocol [see Section 
5.1.6.2.3 below]). The classification and management of reactive capillary endothelial 
proliferation (RCEP) are detailed in APPENDIX 7 .  
5.1.6.2.3. Rules for M anagement on Hepatic Adverse E vents of SHR -1210  
Below are suggestions on m anagement of hepatic AE s that may occur in the 
experimental arm during the SHR -1210 treatment period of this study : 
• If the dose is delayed for 3- 5 days  and AST or ALT level is not improved but even 
exacerbated, cortisol, i.e., m ethylprednisolone 0.5 -2 mg/kg/day or equivalent oral 
drugs , will be given;   
• In case of AST or ALT >8 times of ULN, cortisol, i.e., m ethylprednisolone 1-
2 mg/kg/day or equivalent oral drugs , will be given immediately , and meanwhile, 
a consultation from the department of gastroenterology is advised;  
• If AST or ALT level is not improved but even exacerbated 3- 5 days after the start 
of corticosteroids  treatment, other immunosuppressants m ay need to be added, such 
as mycophenolate 1g BID;  
• Once AST or ALT is decreased by one CTCAE Grade, the dose can be decreased 
gradually in no less than one month.  
The study drug can be resumed when AST or ALT is recovered to baseline level, unless 
the criteria for permanent discontinuation is reached.  
5.1.6.2.4. Infusion R eaction of SHR -1210 
As SHR -1210 is one fully humanized monoclonal antibody, the possibility of infusion 
or allergic reaction is low, and preventive medication is not needed prior to infusion. Allergic reaction is most likely to occur within 24h after infusion. Once the allergic reactions occur, the infusion should be slowed down or interrupted based on the condition, and clinical supportive treatment is needed. The preventive medication 
should be given prior to the subsequent doses. The allergic reactions are possibly characterized by fever, intolerance of cold, chills, headache, rash, pruritus, arthralgia, low or high blood pressure, or bronchospasm. All the Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions 
should be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours  and reported as SAE in case of 
meet ing the criteria for SAE. See detailed reporting methods in Section  8.2.

Intense pain, loss of skin function, comparably rare. 
Symptomatic treatment and measures:  
Recommended some necessary supportive treatments include intensive skin care, 
keeping skin clean to avoid secondary infe ction; avoiding pressure or scratching; using 
moisturizing cream or lubricant, including local use of lotion or lubricant containing urea and corticosteroids; and local use of anti -fungal or antibiotic therapy when 
necessary.  
Note: If ≥ Grade 3 hand -foot syndrome occurs for consecutive three times, with an 
aggravating tendency, the administration of rivoceranib should be terminated. 
2. Hypertension  
Subjects should be enrolled strictly in accordance with the requirement of blood 
pressure in the inclusion/exclusion criteria, subjects with hypertension can achieve controlled through adjustment of the dose of antihypertensive agents or adding of new antihypertensive agents prior to taking the study drugs, the blood pressure should be controlled within  140/90 mmHg.   
Monitoring and management of hypertension:  
Daily blood pressure monitor ing (based on the average of BP readings acquired from ≥  
2 measurements ) is recommended after the initiation of rivoceranib mesylate treatment.  
Once hypertension occurs, the following treatment can be given: Angiotensin II 
receptor blockers (ARB), angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), β receptor 
blockers, etc. Or combined use of the aforementioned drugs.  
If subjects have hypertension or exacerbation of hypertension during administration, should take following actions:  
1) Adjusting the administration of study drugs as specified in the protocol (see Section 5.1.6.1.5);

HENGRUI CONFIDENTIAL  
89 2) Starting to take antihypertensive agents or adjusting the dose.  
Advise s ubjects to record  daily blood pressure measurements in a subjects ’ diary. If they 
are taking hypertension drugs at the same time, they are required to keep a detailed 
record of the drug name, dosage, method and frequency of use, and related complaints or symptoms of discomfort.  
The hypertension treatment drugs are recommended as below:  
1) Angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI);  
2) Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARB);  
3) dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists;  
4) β receptor blockers.  
Use of diuretics is not recommended for anti -hypertensive therapy; nicardipine, 
diltiazem and verapamil with CYP3A4 inhibitory effect are prohibited. Rivoceranib  
mesylate should be discontinued in subject s with hypertensive crisis.   
3. Proteinuria  
Proteinuria should be closely monitored for all the subject s throughout the treatment, 
and intensively monitored in subject s who have history of hypertension; the 24- hour 
urine protein quantification must be performed for the subjects with urine protein ≥2+.  
Note: Rivoceranib  mesylate shall be discontinued in case nephrotic syndro me occurs.  
4. Hemorrhage of digestive tract  
Active symptomatic treatment should be given when gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurs, including persistently positive result of fecal occult blood, haematemesis or bloody stool. The subjects who are judged as uppe r gastrointestinal hemorrhage should 
be fasted and given acid suppression agents, drugs for gastric mucosa protection hemostasis (Transamin, Reptilase, etc.) treatment, and octreotide can be used when necessary; hemostasis, blood transfusion and supportive  treatments will be given for 
those with lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage; surgical assistance may be required immediately if the hemorrhage can not be controlled. Adjustment of medication in accordance with the principle in Section 5.1.6.1.5 in the protocol.   
5. Thrombosis  
Rivoceranib  mesylate should be discontinued immediately for any arterial thrombosis 
(e.g., cerebral ischemia, stroke, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, etc.). 
Rivoceranib  mesylate should be temporarily discontinued in case symptomatic venous 
thrombosis occurs.   
Symptomatic treatment, surgery or anticoagulants should be given immediately for

90 5.1.6.2.6. Rules for M anagement of Adverse E vents of S orafenib  
1. Skin toxicity:  
Hand -foot cutaneous reactions and rash are the most common adverse reactions of 
sorafenib. Usually, the rash and hand- foot skin reactions are mostly CTCAE Grade 1-2 
and mostly occur within 6 weeks after the start of administration of sorafenib. 
Recommended  necessary symptomatic and supportive treatments include intensive skin 
care, keeping skin clean to avoid secondary infection; avoiding pressure or scratching; using moisturizing cream or lubricant, including local use of lotion or lubricant containing ure a and corticosteroids; and local use of anti -fungal or antibiotic therapy 
when necessary. Subject s with serious and persistent cutaneous toxicities may need to 
discontinue sorafenib permanently. Permanently discontinued for the serious cases.  
2. Gastrointestinal side effects:  
It is one of the common adverse reactions of sorafenib and mainly characterized by abdominal pain and diarrhea, which are generally mild- to-moderate and may be 
associated with the direct irritation of gastrointestinal mucosa of sorafenib after a long  
absorption in digestive tract and change of pH over time during its metabolism. Generally, the symptoms can be relieved through eating less residue, low -fiber diet, and 
digestible food. Subject s with serious diarrhea need to be closely observe d. Infusion 
should be given as supportive treatment in case of dehydration, which would supply enough water and electrolytes.  
3. Hypertension:  
The incidence of hypertension will be increased in subject s given sorafenib. Drug -
related hypertension is mostly mild -to-moderate, usually occurs in early stage after 
taking medicine, and can be controlled with routine antihypertensive agents. The blood pressure should be monitored routinely and controlled within 140/90 mmHg. Advise 
subjects to record daily blood press ure measurements in the dairy card in detail.  
Wherever necessary, high blood pressure will  be treated in accordance with standard 
antihypertensive regimen , and chief complaints or symptoms as well as dosing 
information (e.g., drug name, dose, route of admi nistration and frequency) will be 
recorded in detail.  Permanent discontinuation of sorafenib needs to be considered for 
subject s who still have serious or persistent hypertension after use of antihypertensive 
agents or have hypertensive crisis.  
4. Hemorrhage : 
The incidence of hemorrhage may be increased after administration of sorafenib. Active symptomatic treatments should be given when gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurs, including persistently positive result of fecal occult blood, hematemesis or bloody stool. The subjects who are judged as upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage should be fasted and given acid suppression agents, drugs for gastric mucosa protection, hemostasis (Transamin, Reptilase, etc.) treatment, and octreotide can be used when necessary; hemo stasis, blood transfusion and supportive treatments will be given for those with 
lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage; surgical assistance may be required immediately if the hemorrhage can not be controlled. Once treatment is needed, it is advisable to

91 consider permanent discontinuation of sorafenib. Hemorrhage or elevated INR occurs 
occasionally in part of subject s taking sorafenib and warfarin simultaneously. INR and 
PT should be detected routinely and attention should be paid to the sign of clinical hemorrh age in subject s given concomitant warfarin.  
5. Myocardial ischemia and/or myocardial infarction: 
Discontinuation of sorafenib should be considered for subject s with drug- related 
myocardial ischaemia and/or myocardial infarction.  
6. Gastrointestinal perforation : 
Gastrointestinal perforation is rare. The incidence of gastrointestinal perforation is le ss 
than 1% reported in subject s given sorafenib. Once it occurs, sorafenib should be 
discontinued.  
7. Liver impairment: 
Sorafenib is mainly eliminated via liver, and its exposure will be elevated in the subject s 
with hepatic impairment. Symptomatic and supportive treatment must be taken, the dose of sorafenib must be reduced or interrupted in case of drug related abnormal hepatic function. And discontinuation of the tre atment should be considered if the 
symptom is serious and ≥  Grade 3 on an ongoing basis.

5.3.1. Prohibited or C autiously Used Medications and Treatments During the 
Study  
5.3.1.1. Drugs and Therapies P rohibited for All the S ubjects D uring the S tudy  
Subjects are prohibited from using modern traditional Chinese medicines  that have  been 
approved by the NMPA (or by regulatory authorities  in other countries ) for the 
indication of HCC  (including but not limited to Delisheng Injection, Kanglaite Injection, 
Aidi Injection, Huaier Granule and Ganfule Tablets ) and immune -modulators 
(including but not limited to interferon, interleukin- 2, thymosin, etc.) during the study.   
During the treatment period of this study, subjects are not allowed to receive any local therapies against liver tumor lesion and targeted lesion (except palliative local therapies described in Section 5.3.2.4), and other systemic antitumor therapies, such as 
chemotherapies, molecular t argeted therapies, hormone therapies, immunotherapies, 
and so on. 
Subjects are not allowed to use other investigational products for antitumor therapy 
during the treatment period of this study.  
Section  4.2 ( Exclusion Criteria ) of the p rotocol describes other drugs prohibited in this 
study.   
5.3.1.2. Drugs P rohibited for S ubjects G iven SHR -1210 D uring the S tudy  
Subjects are not allowed to receive immunosu ppressive  therapies simultaneously 
during the treatment period of this study (except management on the treatment -related  
adverse events).  
Systemic corticosteroid can not be used at the dose of >10 mg/day (Prednisone or 
equivalent) during SHR -1210 treatment p eriod, except for treatment -related  AEs 
treatments or short -term preventive therapies. SHR -1210 will be resumed until systemic 
corticosteroid dose has been reduced at ≤ 10 mg/day (Prednisone or equivalent). 
Vaccination of live vaccine are prohibited within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study  
drugs until 60 days after the last dose.  
5.3.1.3. Drugs Used Cautiously or P rohibited for Subjects Given Rivoceranib  
During the S tudy  
There was a study conducted by Bao et al  
[24], in which apatinib  (also known as 
rivoceranib ) was evaluated for its in vitro inhibitory effect on the major CYP enzymes 
including CYP3A2/4, CYP2B1/6, CYP2C9/11, CYP2D1/6, and CYP2E1 using human 
and rat microsomes. The IC50 and IC50- shift results indicated that rivoceranib might 
not be a t ime-dependent inhibitor. Rivoceranib  was a weak inhibitor of human CYP2E1 
(IC50>10 μM) but inhibited CYP2B6/2B1 and CYP2D6/2D1 in a competitive way (Ki = 3.84/0.59 and 5.41/0.87 μM), and inhibited CYP3A4/3A2 and rat CYP2E1 in a

93 mixed way (Ki = 11.50/1.83 a nd 13.06 μM). On CYP2C9, Rivoceranib  exhibited the 
noncompetitive inhibition (Ki = 0.71 μM) while it inhibited CYP2C11 uncompetitively 
(Ki = 3.30 μM). These results are consistent with the findings in the JHM and LSK IB, in which rivoceranib has the most potent inhibitory effect on CYP2C9, with lesser on 
CYP3A4 and CYP2C19.  
• In vitro studies have shown that rivoceranib  is mainly metabolized by the liver 
P450 enzyme s CYP3A, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, strong inhibitors and 
inducers of CYP3A  and CYP2C19 will significantly increase or decrease 
clearance of rivoceranib with increased or decreased exposures of rivoceranib. 
Therefore , the strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A  and CYP2C19 will be 
prohibited (see Appendix 11 for listings of strong inhibitors and inducers of 
CYP3A and 2C19, there are no strong i nhibitors or inducers of CYP2C9) .  
• Sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 will be used with caution .  
• As the potential DDI for rivoceranib  as a perpetrator of  CYP2C9 exists , the 
following instructions will be implemented until further information is 
available: Drugs metabolized by CYP2C9 with narrow therapeutic index: warfarin, and phenytoin, will be prohibited. Drugs that are sensitive substrate 
of CYP2C9, such as celecoxib will be  used with caution. 
• Drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 with narrow therapeutic index thioridazine, 
and pimozide , will be prohibited. Drugs that are  sensitive substrates of 
CYP2D6 atomoxetine, desipramine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, nebivolol, 
perphenazine, tolterodine, and venlafaxine will be used with caution. 
The following t ransporter substrates with narrow therapeutic index  are prohibited:  P-
gp substrates dabigatran, and digoxin, MATE1, MATE -2K, OCT2 substrate dofetilide  
(FDA’s Web site on Drug Development and Drug Interactions can be found at 
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteractionsLabeling/ucm080499.htm  and drug bank for narrow therapeutic index 
https://www.drugbank.ca/categories/DBCAT003972. See Appendix 11)  
The transporter inhibitors are reported to increase transporter substrates ’ AUC  ≥1.5 to 
≥2 fold, and thus fall into the category of moderate inhibitors. They  are to be advised 
used with caution (FDA’s Web site on Dr ug Development and Drug Interactions 
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteractionsLabeling/ucm080499.htm . See Appendix 11 for detail ed listings)  
• It is necessary to avoid the concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval 
prior to (approximately 5 half -lives of the concomitant drug) and during study 
enrollment.   These drugs may include antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, 
and anti -arrhy thmics, angina relieving drugs, antipsychotic drugs, antifungal drugs, 
antimalarial drugs, antihistamines, gastrointestinal antiemetic and promoting drugs, 
and antidepressants, e tc.

94 • Subjects should be advised to restrict use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs ). 
Subjects should be encouraged to avoid concomitant administration of rivoceranib 
with acidic modifiers or H2 blockers. If these concurrent medicines are needed, they should be taken 5 hours after the studied drug administration. For other prohibited concurrent medicines please refer to Appendix 11.  
5.3.1.4. Drugs U sed C autiously for S ubjects G iven S orafenib D uring the S tudy  
Rifampicin, one strong CYP3A4 inducer, once per day at the dose of 600  mg in healthy 
volunteers, for consecutive 5 days, and single dose of oral sorafenib 400 mg, can lead 
to decrease of average AUC of sorafenib by 37%. Therefore, strong CYP3A4 inducers  
(such as  dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital, 
rifapentine, Hypericum perforatum L [also known as St John's -wort], etc.) should be 
avoided as concomitant medications ; they may accelerate metabolism of sorafenib and 
decrease the concentration of sorafenib.  
The combined use of sorafenib with neomycin may lead to decreased bioavailability of sorafenib by above 50%.  
In addition, investigators can refer to the label of sorafenib tosylate tablets  and combine  
with clinical practice for more detailed descriptions of the drugs prohibited or used cautiously for such subjects during the study .  
5.3.2. Permitted C oncomitant M edications and Treatments D uring the S tudy  
5.3.2.1. Antiviral Treatment  
Subjects infected with HBV and HCV must receive antiviral therapy according to local standards.  Antiviral therapy is recommended as below:  
Subject s with HBV infection ca n continue the original antiviral therapy if HBsAg is 
positive and they have started antiviral therapy and achieved satisfactory control of virus (HBV -DNA <500 IU/mL) prior to inclusion in the study; subjects with suboptimal 
viral control are recommended t o switch to other standard  anti-HBV medication  (e.g., 
Entecavir ) as recommended by local guidelines, and subject s can be enrolled when 
HBV -DNA is <500 IU/mL; subject s with newly discovered HBV infection in screening 
period can start standard anti -HBV treatment as recommended by local guidelines ( e.g., 
Entecavir ) immediately and can be enrolled when HBV -DNA is <500 IU/mL.  
Subject s with HCV infection, if HCV -RNA is positive, subject s must receive antiviral 
therapy in accordance with the local standard guideline on diagnosis and treatment of 
hepatitis C .  
5.3.2.2. Steroids  
Local use of steroids is allowed, for example, topically external use, eye, nasal cavity, intra-joint and inhalation; corticosteroids for epinephrine replacement therapy are 
allowed; corticosteroids for treatment of adverse reactions are allowed; transient use of  
steroids for prevention and treatment of allergic reactions (prevention of allergy to contrast agents, or treatment of other allergic reactions) are allowed .

95 5.3.2.3. Other S ystemic Therapies  
During the treatment period, subjects should be given the best supportive treatment. 
The original hormone replacement therapy is allowed. Bisphosphonate for treatment of bone metastasis is permitted .  
5.3.2.4. Palliative L ocal Treatment  
Palliative therapy  for local non- target lesions causing obvious symptoms is allowed, for 
example, bone pain; local radiotherapies or surgery and management of pleural effusion and ascites can be considered, however, the following conditions must be met:  
• These lesions are known to be present at enrollment;  
• Progression of disease must be judged by investigators, for subjects who need local 
therapy due to deterioration  of symptoms during the study;  
• Subjects with progression  of disease must meet the criteria for treatment beyond 
progression (see Section  6.6 for the details);  
• The lesions for local therapy cannot be target lesions;  
• Subject s should interrupt  the dose of investigational product until the end of 
recovery period of palliative therapy, whilst receiving palliative local therapy.  
It is advisable to discuss with the sponsor prior to the start of palliative local therap y. 
The content of palliative therapy should be recorded carefully in eCRF and medical 
record, including the date, sites of treatment, therapeutic methods and dosage, adverse reactions, and do on.  
5.3.3. Surgery or Palliative R adiotherapy 
Any surgery or palliative radiotherapy should have the oretical basis and necessity 
during the study. At the interval between the treatment and use of investigational products, recovery that has no effect on the wound and search for the reason of unknow n 
hemorrhage must be performed as much as possible. In acc ordance with the label of 
rivoceranib , it is advised to interrupt the dose of rivoceranib  prior to the operation to 30  
days and after the operation. It is recommended in the label of sorafenib that the time 
of dose interruption of sorafenib will be based o n the type of operation and status of 
wound healing and depend on clinician’ s specific judgment. Besides that, it is 
recommended to interrupt the dose of study drugs at least 14 days prior to, during and at least 14 days after  palliative radiotherapy, in this protocol, the dose resumption in the 
subjects receiving surgery  depend s on the clinical evaluation of wound healing and 
postoperative recovery .  
6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
The utmost efforts will be made to ensure all the tests and procedures required in the protocol go as planned. However, unexpected things may happen sometimes and be 
beyond investigator ’s control, making it difficult to test. In these cases, the investigator 
will take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and interests of the subject. When one test required in the protocol can not be performed, investigators need to record the

96 reason. In addition, the study team need to be informed of the accidental situation in 
time.  
6.1. Screening P eriod  
The screening period begins with the signing of the informed consent form and ends with the randomization or screening failure. Termination of this study after signing the informed consent form and prior to randomization wi ll be regarded as screening failure. 
Subjects with screening failure can be re- screened. They must sign the informed 
consent form again, re -register and obtain a new subject number at the re -screening. 
Subjects can only be re- screened once.  
Subjects must sign the informed consent form before performing any screening procedure specified in this study. In case routine radiological evaluation has been performed for tumors prior to the signing of the informed consent form, computed tomography (CT), magnetic re sonance radiological (MRI) or bone scan does not need 
to be repeated in screening period as long as they are completed within 28 days prior to the start of study drug (42 days prior to start of study drug is acceptable for bone scan), and meet the requirem ent for radiological evaluation in this study.  
Unless otherwise noted, collection of the following data should be completed within 28 days prior to the start of study drug:  
• Obtain the informed consent form signed by the subject;  
• Assign subject number (subjects will be assigned a unique number in the study: the 
subject number reflects the numbering of study site s and numbering of subject s 
within the same study site; the numbering of subjects  shall be in accordance with 
the sequence in which the subjects si gn the informed consent form, for example, 
001, 002, 003, etc.) ; 
• Collect demographic characteristics;  
• Collect medical history (including history  of tumor and past medical  history, see  
the SCHEDULE OF ACTIVITIES  for details);  
• Tumor tissue collection ( for detail ed instructions regarding  tumor tissue sampl ing, 
refer to  the laboratory manual. If tumor sample is  not accessible in special case, it 
can be discussed  with Sponsor  on a case- by-case basis ); 
• Collect concomitant medications/therapies;  
• Collect AE;  
• Tumor radiological  evaluation : the radiological evaluation prior to the signing of 
informed consent form and within 28 days prior to the first dose i s acceptable, and  
will be performed based on RECIST v1.1 ( evaluated by investigator and BIRC), 
mRECIST ( evaluated by  BIRC only) and imREC IST (evaluated by  investigator 
only). All the measurable and evaluable tumor lesions should be evaluated and 
recorded, including enhanced CT /MRI  scan of thorax, abdomen, pelvis and site of 
lesions, brain enhanced MRI or enhanced CT scan (excluding intracranial 
metastasis) . Thoracic plain CT scan and abdominal, pelvic and brain MRI can be

If dose delay occurs , required examination during study treatment need to be performed 
as planned or more frequently  if clinically indicated. E chocardiography and blood HCG 
test can be monitored at any time, if necessary. Also, in accordance with RECIST v1.1 
(investigator and BI RC evaluation), mRECIST (only for BIRC evaluation) and 
imREC IST (only for investigator evaluation), all evaluation s during the treatment  
period, with randomization as baseline, will be performed once every 8 weeks (56 days) 
±7 days in the first 48 weeks, once every 12 weeks (84 days) ±7 days afterwards, and 
additionally performed when clinically indicated. When there is no BIRC determined 
progression of disease (according to RECIST v1.1) , tumor evaluation should be 
continued, regardl ess of discontinuation of study treatment, unless death, withdrawal of 
informed consent, start of subsequent antitumor therapy or termination of study by the sponsor, whichever comes first; the evaluation includes the enhanced CT /MRI  scan of 
thorax, abdome n, pelvis and site of lesions . Thoracic plain CT scan, abdominal and 
pelvic MRI can be performed in case of allergy to the contrast agent for enhanced CT; cranial CT/MRI and bone scan can be performed only when clinically indicated. Throughout the study, e ach subject must use the same procedure for radiological 
examination. Investigators must review the results prior to the next cycle of therapy. The subjects who have achieved remission (complete remission or partial remission) for the first time need to be  confirmed by the next scheduled evaluation or repeated 
evaluation ≥  4 weeks after the first evaluation.  
Subject s with BIRC de termined  progression (according to RECI ST v1.1) can continue 
to use SHR -1210 monotherapy or combination with rivoceranib  (experimental arm) or 
sorafenib (control arm) if investigator assess th ey meet the criteria defined in

Follow -up period is initiated when the end- of-treatment visit is completed. 30 days (±7 
days) after the last dose of study drug, subjects must return to the study center for saf ety 
follow -up and complete the following par ameters for safety evaluation, regardless of 
initiation of new antitumor therapy. The telephone follow -up will be performed 60 days 
(±7 days) and 90 days (±7 days) after the last dose of study drug, only the survival status , 
subsequent antitumor therapy, c oncomitant medication/therapy and AE s/SAE s within 
the timeframe specified in the protocol need to be collected.  When developing a 
safety follow -up plan, ensure that the  visit is scheduled within the safety follow -up 
period (for the experimental arm, 90 da ys after the last study dose of SHR -1210 or 30 
days after the last study dose of rivoceranib (whichever is longer); for the control arm, 
it is after 30 days after the last study administration.) If the date of the previously completed end - of- treatment  visit has exceeded the safety follow -up period, there is no 
need to schedule the  safety follow -up visit.  
For the subjects in experimental arm , if the date of completed end -of-treatment visit has 
exceeded the first safety follow -up (30 days after the last dose), but the safety follow -
up period has not been exceeded , the subject does not need to go to the site for safety 
follow -up visit, and 1- 2 telephone visits can be scheduled during the safety follow -up 
period. In this case , ensure that the interval between visits should not exceed 44 days, 
and a telephone visit should be conducted at t he time point of the safety follow -up 
period. 
The following will be performed at safety visit at the s tudy center :

When SHR -1210 is interrupted for longer than 30 days and finally is confirmed to 
be unable to resume, for this situation, the subject is required to come for a site visit 
and collect blood sample immediately when investigator confi rms the subject is 
permanently terminated SHR -1210 treatment . If the subject has started new anti -
tumor therapy, it ’s not necessary to collect the immunogenicity blood sample at 30

109 After the end of safety follow -up, the subjects will enter survival follow -up period. First 
survival follow -up will be performed 30 days (±7 days) after last safety follow -up. 
Investigators must follow up subject ’s survival every 30 days (±7 days), until death, 
loss of follow -up, termination of study by the sponsor or reaching other criteria for end 
of study, whichever comes first. Investigators can inquire the subject, his/her family 
members or local physician via phone, collect subject ’s survival information  (death and 
reason of death) and data on other tumor therapies after the end of study treatment. The data on each survival follow -up needs to be recorded in detail in the original medical 
record.  
Subjects who end study treatment for toxicity or other reasons with no radiological progression observed still need to receive radiological evaluation according to the original freque ncy, until progression of disease or start of other antitumor therapy  
(except for traditional Chinese medicine ), the radiological evidence on PD should be 
obtained from such subjects as much as possible.  
All the treatment- related toxicities must be follow ed up until they are resolved, 
recovered to baseline or considered as irreversible. AE should be reported and recorded according to the requirement during safety follow -up.  
6.5. Unscheduled Visits 
For unscheduled visits (e.g., due to AEs) that occur or are nee ded before the end of 
study, the following items should be recorded:  
• Visit date;  
• Reason for visit;  
• Concomitant medications/therapies  (within the collocation period specified in the 
protocol);  
• AEs (within the collocation and follow -up period specified in the protocol) ;  
• All the relevant examinations performed (including radiological  examination, if 
any);  
• Whether the subject can continue or resume study treatment, if yes, record the dose 
administered.  
6.6. Treatment B eyond Progression  
If the subject has progression confirmed by BIRC as defined per  RECIST v1.1, he/she 
still can continue SHR -1210 alone or combined with rivoceranib  (experimental arm ) or 
sorafenib ( control arm ) when he/she can still clinically benefit from and tolerate study 
treatment, as evaluated  by investigators. Upon approval of Protocol v6.0, disease 
progression will be confirmed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1. S ubject s may 
continue on study treatment beyond the time of investigator -confirmed  disease 
progression, at the discretion of the investigator if the subject is perceived to be 
experiencing clinical benefit .

110 6.6.1. Criteria on Post-Progression Continuation of SHR -1210 Alone or 
Combined w ith Rivoceranib  in S ubjects in E xperimental Arm 
A part of subject s receiving immunotherapy can still clinically benefit following 
radiological progression. Although the tumor is enlarged, obvious necrosis or 
degeneration can appear inside the tumor, decreased density inside the tumor foci can be shown on CT, it is gener ally considered that the subject  may benefit under this 
circumstance. After progression of disease as defined per  RECIST v1.1, and confirmed 
by BIRC  subjects meeting all of the following criteria may continue with the study 
treatment  until there is no long er benefit from the treatment . Subjects who continue the 
dose following PD will receive periodic visit and efficacy evaluation according to the visit schedule specified in the trial. Disease progression will be confirmed by  the 
investigator per RECIST v1.1 upon approval of Protocol v6.0;  other procedures and 
criteria  remain unchanged. 
• Investigators judge continuation of study treatment meets the optimal benefit for 
the subject, and the subject does not need to start other antitumor therapy 
immediately;  
• The subject can tolerate study treatment;  
• Stable ECOG -PS score (≤1);  
• No significant clinical symptom/sign of progression of disease, including change 
in laboratory examination parameters;  
• Non-rapid progression of disease and progression not involving ma jor organs/sites 
(e.g., spinal cord compression);  
• The study treatment can be continued upon the review and approval by the medical monitors from the sponsor.  
6.6.2. Criteria on Post-Progression Continuation of S orafenib Treatment in 
Subjects in C ontrol Arm 
The growth of HCC can be possibly inhibited with continuation of the therapy in a part of subject s receiving sorafenib after radiological progression, which makes subjects 
clinically benefit. Thus, the subjects meeting all of the following criteria are allowed to 
continue sorafenib treatment after BIRC- confirmed disease progression  defined by 
RECIST v1.1 in this study  until there is no more benefit from the treatment, disease 
progression will be at the investigator ’s confirmation per RECIST v1.1 upon approval 
of Protocol v6.0, other procedures and criteria  remain unchanged :  
• Investigators judge continuation of sorafenib treatment meets the optimal benefit 
for the subject, and the subject does not need to start other antitumor therapy 
immediately, including b ut not limited to the second -line Regorafenib;  
• The subject can tolerate sorafenib treatment;  
• Stable ECOG -PS score (≤1);  
• No significant clinical symptom/sign of progression of disease, including change 
in laboratory examination parameters;

111 • Non-rapid progression of disease and progression not involving major organs/sites 
(e.g., spinal cord compression);  
• The study treatment can be continued upon the review and approval by the medical 
monitors from the sponsor.  
6.6.3. Other Precautions for P ost-Progression C ontinuation of Treatment  
The clinical benefit evaluation must take clinical exacerbation, continued benefit from 
the treatment into consideration. Investigator should  discuss with the sponsor about the 
decision on post -progression continuation of treatment, as judged by investigators.  
If a decision is made that the subject needs to continue study treatment following progression, the subject should be treated, evaluated and followed up as required in the protocol.  
The subjects who continue the treatment aft er PD must be sufficiently informed and 
sign the informed consent form for post -PD continuation of treatment: possible 
alternative therapies, potential risks with continuation of the treatment.  
If the subject terminates the treatment for a global deterior ation of health status and has 
no objective evidence on progression  of disease, the progression will be reported as 
symptomatic deterioration . Every effort should be made to obtain the objective 
evidence on progression in these subjects after termination of the study treatment (e. g., 
radiological confirmation).  
6.7. Study Extension Phase  
The purpose of the extension phase is to continue to provide access to  study drugs for 
subjects who are still on study treatment and still derive clinical  benefit at the time of 
end of study . It’s a post -trail treatment access phase. Upon initiation of the extension 
phase, the Sponsor considers the safety and efficacy profile of the experimental treatment regimen within this study to have been sufficiently established and data 
analysis required for regulatory purposes to have been completed. The Sponsor will  
notify the sites when will the study enter the extension phase. 
In the extension phase, subjects randomized in the experimental arm will continue on SHR -1210 in combination with rivoceranib, and subjects randomized in the control arm 
may have the option to crossover to receive experimental treatment and the decision made is upon investigator ’s clinical judgment.  Subjects who are not eligible to 
crossover experimental treatment per investigator clinical judgment can continue on sorafenib tre atment . Sorafenib can be sourced either locally or centrally which can 
comply with the loca l regulatory and ethics requirement. 
Subjects will continue to receive stud y treatment until they are no longer benefiting 
from treatment as assessed by investigator ’s clinical judgment.  The extension pha se 
will continue until the last subject receive s the  last dose of study drug (expected  
Jan.2025, take the actual occurrence as the standard) . Subjects are to undergo periodic 
safety and tumor assessment. The frequency of these assessments during  the extension 
phase are to be performed per local standard of care. The investigator  should ensure site 
visits occur frequently enough and adequate assessments.  Investigator may also  refer to

12. 
The study clinical database will be closed at the  initiation  of the extension phase. 
Important safety information collection in the extension phase will be captured in the 
safety database.  
The schedule of activities for extension phase is present ed in APPENDIX 12 .  
Subjects who continue on study treatment at the time of extension phase initiation, will undergo the end of study treatment visit and perform all the study procedures  as the 
protocol requir ed. Subjects who had discontinued study treatment but not yet completed 
the follow up visits ( i.e., safety follow up) at the time of extension phase initiat ion (e.g., 
subject just completed first safety follow up) , will undergo the final safety follow up 
visit.  
The time of extension phase initiation may occur  at different time points for study sites 
because of different processes at sites. Befor e extension phase, study sites need to 
ensure  that all the data occurring prior to extension phase have been captured into CRFs, 
particularly for safety and survival information. In addition, for the subjects  who are  
continuing  to receive study treatment , the end of study treatment and end of study page 
in CRFs  should be captured as well before enter ing into extension phase ( detailed 
instruction for EOT and EOS page in CRFs for extension subjects . Refer to CRF 
completion guideline). If a schedule d visit occurred within 7 days before the time of 
extension phase initiation or the relevant examinations  for end of treatment visit were 
completed within 7 days, these study procedures would not be necessary to be repeated  
on EOT .  
Site monitoring visits will occur at a reduced frequency but must be frequent enough to ensure adherence to GCP, study drug accountability, reporting of SAEs and pregnancy .  
During the extension phase, no data are to be entered into CRFs. Study central laboratory samples are not to be obtained ( e.g., PK, ADA sampling) , and radi ographic 
images from the site are not to be submitted to BIRC.  
7. EVALUATION 
7.1. Efficacy E valuation  
The efficacy endpoints include:  
• Overall survival  time  (OS): defined as the time from randomization to death for 
any cause.   
As well as the following efficacy endpoints evaluated by the BIRC or investigator based 
on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 ( RECIST v1.1) , modified 
RECIST (mRECIST) and immune -modified RECIST ( imRECIST ):

113 • Progression- free survival (P FS): defined as the time from the date of randomization 
to the first occurrence of radiological  progression by tumor image evaluation or 
death, whichever comes first, evaluated by the BIRC or investigator based on 
RECIST v1.1, mRECIST or imRECIST . (Radiological  progression based on 
imRECIST not considered a PFS event if subsequent assessment evaluated as a 
response or stable after ≥ 4 weeks.)   
• Time to progression (TTP): defined as the time from the date of randomization to 
radiological  progression of disease, evaluated by the BIRC or investigator based 
on RECIST v1.1, mRECIST or imRECIST. (Radiological  progression based on 
imRECIST not considered a TTP event if subsequent assessment evaluated as a 
response or stable after ≥ 4 weeks.)  
• Objective response  rate (ORR): defined as the percentage of subjects with complete 
response  (CR) or partial re sponse  (PR) evaluated by the BIRC or investigator based 
on RECIST v1.1, mRECIST or imRECIST. ( In respect of ORR based on 
imRECIST, CR and PR can occur after radiolo gical  progression) . 
• Disease control rate (DCR): defined as the percentage of subjects with complete response , partial response  or stable disease (SD) ≥  8 weeks evaluated by the BIRC 
or investigator based on RECIST v1.1, mRECIST or imRECIST. (In respect of 
DCR  based on imRECIST, CR PR and SD can occur after radiological  progression) . 
• Duration of response (DoR): defined as time from the date of first record of objective response (CR or PR) to the first occurrence of radiological  progression 
or death, whichever comes first, evaluated by the BIRC or investigator based on 
RECIST v1.1, mRECIST or imRECIST. (Radiological progression based on 
imRECIST not considered a PD event of DoR if subsequent assessment evaluated as a response or stable after ≥ 4 weeks. ). 
• Best overall response (BOR): defined as the best response parameter between the date from randomization to objectively recorded progression or subsequent antitumor therapy, whichever comes first. For subjects with no progression or subsequent antitumor therapy documented, BOR will be determined based on all the response evaluation results . (The BOR based on imRECIST is defined as the 
best response between the date of randomization and the initiation of subsequent antitumor therapy or during the entire study period ). 
7.2. Tumor  Radiological  Evaluation  
7.2.1. Tumor Evaluation  Based on RECIST v1.1, mRECIST and imRECIST  
RECIST v1.1 (investigator and BIRC evaluated), mRECIST (only BIRC evaluated) and imRECIST (only investigator evaluated) will be used for evaluation of tumor response in this study, see APPENDIX 2  for the evaluation criteria.  
The tumor evaluation in screening period (at baseline) should include the enhanced CT/MRI  scan of thorax, abdomen and pelvis. CT scan requires intravenous contrast 
agent and will scan the whole liver area, at least including 1) hepatic arterial phase and 2) portal venous phase. Enhanced MRI can be used in case of contraindications for CT contr ast agent. The enhanced MRI of the whole liver should at least include 1) hepatic 
arterial phase and 2) portal venous phase. Cranial enhanced CT or enhanced MRI has

114 to be performed at baseline as well. Systemic bone scan should be performed for 
subjects wi th known bone metastasis or suspected bone metastasis (exempted in case 
bone scan is performed within 42 days prior to first administration ), the bone lesions 
need to be evaluated and followed up after treatment. If clinically indicated, tumors at other si tes can be evaluated.  
Provision on selection of target lesions: no more than 2 target lesions in each organ, and  
the total number of lesions is not more than 5, more organs involved in tumors should be covered as far as possible. At baseline, the number and location of the target lesion,  
the major diameter of each target lesion (except lymph node) and the minor diameter of lymph node lesion, as well as the sum of diameters of all lesions should be recorded.  
The baseline evaluation and post -treatment effica cy evaluation should be performed 
using the same method and by the same investigator as far as possible. Following randomization, the tumor evaluation will be performed once every 8 weeks (56±7 days) in the first 48 weeks, and once every 12 weeks (84±7 day s) afterwards. In the absence 
of a BIRC determined progression of the disease  (according to RECIST v1.1) , tumor 
evaluation should be continued, regardless of whether the subject has terminated the study, until the subject dies, withdraws the informed conse nt, initiates subsequent anti -
tumor therapy or terminated the study by sponsor, whichever comes first. Tumor evaluation during treatment includes enhanced CT /MRI  scan of thorax, abdomen, 
pelvis and site of lesions; thoracic plain CT scan plus abdominal and pelvic enhanced 
MRI can be performed if the subject is allergic to the contrast agents for enhanced CT; cranial enhanced CT/MRI and bone scan can be performed only when clinically 
indicated. Each tumor evaluation must cover all the target lesions, and all  the non- target  
lesions if there are no special circumstances.  
Further guidance and recommendations on image acquisition are provided in the Image Acquisition Guidelines. 
When clinically indicated, investigators can perform unscheduled tumor evaluation. 
Throughout the study, each subject must use the same procedure of radiological 
examination. Investigators must review the results prior to the next cycle of therapy. The subjects who have achieved re sponse  (complete response  or partial re sponse ) for 
the fir st time need to be confirmed through the next scheduled evaluation or repeated 
evaluation ≥  4 weeks after the first evaluation.  
When the subject develops disease progression as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, the investigator is required to submit radiological  data 
immediately to BIRC; if BIRC assessed it as non -disease progression according to 
RECIST v1.1, the study drug treatment should be continued for the subject and tumor radiological  evaluation should continue; if BIRC confirms  disease progression 
according to RECIST v1.1, the investigator needs to assess whether the subject still has clinical benefit, and if the subject is still considered to have clinical benefit and meets the criteria for continued treatment after progression of the disease (see Section  6.6), 
the subject may continue to receive study medication and continue the efficacy assessment at the original planned frequency.  
Tumor radiological assessment will continue until the occurrence  of disease progression 
confirmed by BIRC according to RECIST v1.1 criteria or study  treatment

115 discontinuation, whichever occurs later. Subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons 
other than BIRC -confirmed disease progression (according to RECIST v1.1) will also 
continue with regular follow -up by tumor radiological  assessments after treatment is 
completed. Before BIRC confirms the disease progression according to the RECIST 
v1.1 criteria or the treatment is discontinued, if the subject withdraws the informed 
consent , other anti -tumor treatment has begun (except for traditional Chinese medicine) , 
or the subject dies, there is no need to continue the radiological  evaluation. If the subject 
does not meet the above criteria for stop radiological  assessmen t, the efficacy 
evaluation of the three efficacy evaluation criteria (RECIST v1.1, mRECIST, imRECIST) needs to continue even if the disease progression under certain efficacy 
evaluation criteria occurs.  
Once progressive disease occurs, a physical examinat ion of the subject and radiological  
confirmation is required at any  times, rather than waiting for the next planned 
radiological  examination. If the unplanned radiological  findings do not meet the 
RECIST V 1.1 criteria of progressive disease, follow -up exa minations should still be 
performed on the original date for the next radiological  examination, unless the next 
planned examination is less than 14 days of this one .  
If there has not been any disease progression confirmed by a radiological examination 
when the subject is about to withdraw from the study, it is recommended that a 
radiological examination be performed in time before the withdrawal (if the time from 
the last radiological examination to the withdrawal is ≤ 4 weeks, additional radiological  
exam ination will not be required at the time of withdrawal) . 
Upon approval of protocol v6.0, radiographic images from the sites are not to be 
submitted to BIRC , therefore,  disease progression confirmation by BIRC is not needed .

Pre-dose sampling: on Day 1 from Cycle 1 to Cycle 4 (C1D1, C2D1, C3D1, C4D1); 
and on Day 1 of every 3 cycles afterwards ( The time point for sample collection will be 
within 0.5 hours prior to rivoceranib administration). Collect once at 30 days (±7 days) 
after the last dose of SHR -1210. When SHR -1210 is interrupted for longer than 30 days 
and if is confirmed to be unable to resume, the subject is required to come for a site visit and collect blood sample immediately. If the subject has star ted other anti -tumor 
therapy, it ’s not necessary to collect the immunogenicity blood sample at 30 days  (±7 
days) after the last administration of SHR -1210. If SHR -1210 and/or rivoceranib is 
tempora rily interrupted, pre -dose immunogenicity and PK sample will be collected on 
schedule . If only rivoceranib is interrupted at time point mentioned above, blood sa mple 
will be collected within 0.5 hours prior to SHR -1210 administration. The above samples 
will be used to measure the blood concentration and immunogenicity of SHR -1210, and 
the plasma concentration of rivoceranib in the C2D1- C4D1 samples. The exact time  of 
the previous administration of rivoceranib will be collected for C2D1, C3D1 and

7.5. Patient  Reported O utcome s (PRO) 
All the subjects will complete EORTC QLQ -C30, EORTC QLQ -HCC18 and EQ -5D-
5L questionnaires prior to the administration of study drug and conduction of any other 
study evaluation at the clinical center from Day 1 of Cycle 1, then repeat the above procedure on Day 1 of every cycle . In addition, all subjects will be assessed by  above -
mentioned questionnaires in the visit of end- of-treatment  and first safety follow -up. 
Questionnaires for PRO evaluation should be validated and in subject s’ local language. 
The questionnaires will be paper -based in this study.  
Questionnaire s should be completed prior to initiation of any  pertinent study visit which 
involves other study activities (including study treatment)  and contact with the 
investigator,  to ensure that the results are not influenced by the interaction between the 
subject and the investigator. Provide subjects with a quiet place and advise them to 
complete within 30 minutes. The study site  should make every effort to ensure that a 
complete questionnaire is obtained from each subject at each scheduled time point, so as to avoid any delay in clinical evaluations. 
If there are privacy requirements for filling out questionnaires in local regulations  (e.g.,

make appropriate arrangements to ensure that the requirements are met  as far as 
possible . 
7.5.1. EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QLQ -HCC18  
EORTC QLQ -C30 is a core scale in the quality of life measurement questionnaire 
system for all cancer subject s that is systematically developed by European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer  (EORTC) , and used for 
measurement of quality of life in all the cancer subject s (for the common part). The 
questionnaire is comprised of 5 functional scales (som atic, role, cognitive, emotional, 
social), 4 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea, vomiting), one global health status scale and several separate items (including dyspnea, anorexia and insomnia). This questionnaire consists of 30 multiple -choice questions.  
The specific module for different cancers is added on EORTC QLQ -C30, i.e., the 
specific scale for different cancers i s formed, HCC module (EORTC QLQ -HCC18) is 
used in this study. The samples of EORTC QLQ -C30 (version 3.0)and EORTC QLQ -
HCC18 scales used in this study are seen in  APPENDIX 8  and APPENDIX 9 .  
In this study, EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QLQ -HCC18 scales  will be used to 
evaluate t he quality of life (QoL), including health related quality of life (HRQOL) / 
general health state (GHS), physical  functioning and role functioning,  of subject s with 
advanced HCC who receive SHR -1210 combined with rivoceranib  mesy late as a first -
line therapy versus those who receive sorafenib as a first -line therapy. The following 
endpoints  are included :  
• TTD, defined as time from randomization to first deterioration , as determine by 
following subscales of  EORTC QLQ -C30 (decreased by ≥ 10 points from baseline), 
at least maintained for two consecutive time points, or maintained for one -time 
point but death in the following 4 weeks (for any reason):  
• HRQO L/GHS  
• Physical  functioning 
• Role functioning 
• Average scores and average change fro m baseline in all the subscales of EORTC 
QLQ -C30 and EORTC QLQ -HCC18 (by cycle) ;  
7.5.2. EQ-5D-5L 
In this study, the health utility index in European five -dimensional health scale (EQ -
5D-5L) and V AS score will be used to evaluate the health status of subject s with 
advanced HCC who receive SHR -1210 combined with rivoceranib  mesylate as a first -
line therapy versus those who receive sorafenib as a first -line therapy, so as to generat e 
the utility score for health economic assessment . 
EQ-5D is a validated and reliable, self -report -based measurement  developed by Euro  
QoL Group to evaluate healt h- related quality of life. It is a universal scale and currently 
includes two versions, EQ -5D-3L and EQ -5D-5L. The EQ -5D-5L version used in this

HENGRUI CONFIDENTIAL  
120 study includes the EQ -5D-5L descriptive system and EQ visual analogue scale (EQ -
V AS) (See APPENDIX 10  for a sample scale).  
The EQ -5D-5L descriptive system measures subject ’s health state from 5 dimensions 
(5D): mobility, self -care ability, daily activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depressi on. 
Each dimension is further divided into 5 levels (5L): (1) no difficulty, (2) slight 
difficulty, (3) moderate difficulty, (4) serio us difficulty, (5) extremely serious difficulty. 
Subjects will be asked to select the most appropriate level in each dimension according 
to their health status.  
EQ-VA S  i s  a vertical visual scale in a length of 20cm. Its top is 100 points and 
represents “ the best health state in mind ”, whereas  the bottom is  0 point and represents 
“the worst health state  in mind ”. Subjects will be asked to mark the point that best suits 
to their own health state on that day on the scale, that is, to score the overall health st ate 
on that day.  
EQ-5D-5L descriptive system combined with EQ -V AS can fully reflect the health s tate 
in the study population.  
7.6. Evaluation of Exploratory Tumor Markers  
Before enrollment, subjects must be able to provide fresh or archived tumor tissue (formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded [FFPE] tissue block or at least 5 unstained FFPE 
slides) for the i mmunohistochemical examination of PD -L1 expression level, so as to 
explore the relation between biomarkers and the efficacy of combination therapy . 
Biopsied specimen, such as the specimen biopsied with fine needle aspiration, cell smear from pleural effusi on drainage and centrifugation or drilled biopsy are inadequate 
to review and evaluate biomarkers. The bone lesions without soft tissue component or decalcified tumor specimen are not acceptable. For fresh tumor biopsied specimen, the detailed description of its collection, handling, processing and shipment is provided in the Laboratory M anual.  
8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
8.1. Adverse E vents 
8.1.1. Definition  
AE is defined as adverse medical events that occur after  the subject who receives  a drug 
in clinical trial, but do  not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment . 
Refer to Section  8.3 for details on the AE collection period. AE can be any undesirable 
and unexpected symptom, sign, laboratory abnormality or disease, including at least the following conditions:  
1) Aggravation of existing (prior to enrollment of clinical trial) medical conditions/disease (including exacerbation of symptoms, signs, laborat ory 
abnormalities); 
2) Any new occurrence of AE: any adverse medical conditions newly occurred (including symptoms, signs, newly diagnosed diseases);

Version 6.0, 21 Sep 2022  
 
HENGRUI CONFIDENTIAL  
121 3) Abnormal laboratory test or result of clinical significance.  
The investigator should carefully record any AE occurs in the subjects, including: the 
description of adverse event and all relevant symptoms, time of onset, severity, the correlation -ship with investigational drugs, duration, actions taken against the study 
drug, final outcomes and prognosis . 
The word “ disease progression” should not be reported as an AE term as disease 
progression is an expected occurrence in the study population, except as described in  
8.2.3 section. When a  disease progression occurs, the occurrence that confirms disease 
progression should be reported as an AE. For example, if the subject has epilepsy that is determined to be related with brain metastasis, epilepsy should be recorded as the AE term, rather t han “disease progression”  or “brain metastasis ”. Progression of the disease  
being studied assessed by measurement of lesions on radiographs or other methods  
should not be reported as an AE. 
8.1.2. The Judgment Standard on S everity of AE  
Refer to NCI -CTC AE v 4.03 grading criteria for AEs related drugs. Refer to the 
judgment criteria in Table 12 if any AE is unlisted in NCI -CTCAE v 4.03.  
Table 12  The Judgment Standard on Severity of AE 
Grade  Clinical Description of S everity  
1 Mild; without clinical symptoms or mild clinical symptoms; only with clinical or laboratory 
abnormalities; no treatment is required.  
2 Moderate, requiring minimal, local or non- invasive treatment; age -appropriate limits in 
Activities of Daily Living (ADL); inv olving tools refer to cooking, shopping, calling, 
counting money, etc.  
3 Severe conditions or serious medical symptoms but not life -threatening; leading to 
hospitalization or hospitalization prolonged; leading to disability; limited in self -care ADL.  
Daily self -care includes bathing, dressing, undressing, eating, going to the bathroom, 
medication, and so on, non- bedridden.  
4 Life-threatening;  emergency treatment is required  
5 Leading to death  
 
8.1.3. Causality Assessment  
Collection of AE starts from the signing of informed consent, records are collected 
regardless of whether the event is related to the investigational drug, whether the subject is assigned to the experimental arm , or even whether the drug is used or not. An y 
discomfort or abnormal change in objective laboratory tests during the treatment should be recorded accurately. Meanwhile the severity, duration, management and outcome of the AE should be recorded. The investigator should determine the relationship betw een 
AE and study drugs, such as whether the occurrence of AE has relationship with a reasonable medication order, the properties of study drug, toxicological and pharmacological effects of study drug, subjects ’ use of other concomitant drugs, 
subjects ’ underlying diseases, medical history, family history and provocative and re -
provocative reactions, etc . The causality relationship between AE and study drug will

122 be assessed to be “related ” or “ unrelated ” which are described in the following.   
Related: there is a rational relationship between AE and the study drug, the AE can be 
attributed to the study drug medically (pharmacologically or clinically).  
Unrelated: there is lack of rational relationship between AE and the study drug, and the AE can not be attributed to the study drug medically (pharmacologically or clinically), 
and/or there is other rational reason to explain it, such as underlying disease, complication, and concomitant medications .  
8.2. Serious Adverse E vents 
8.2.1. Definition of SAE  
Serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as the  medical events  that require 
hospitalization or prolonged  hospitalization , disability , limiting working ability , life -
threatening or death, and leading  to congenital malformation during the clinical trial. 
Including the followi ng medical events:  
• Events leading  to death;  
• Life-threatening events (defined as  the subject has is at risk of death at the time of 
the event ); 
• Events requiring hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization;  
• Events that result in persistent or significant disability / incapacity  / limiting 
working ability;  
• Congenital abnormalities or birth defects; 
• Other important  medical events (defined as the event threatens the safety of the 
subject , or requires intervention measures for the prevention of any of the above 
outcomes ). 
8.2.2. Hospitalization  
Adverse event which causes hospitalization (even less than 24 hours) or prolonged hospitalization should be considered as SAE . 
Hospitalization does not include the following:  
• Rehabilitation facilities  
• Nursing homes  
• Routine emergency room admissions (within 24 hours)  
• Same day surgeries (as outpatient /same day/ambulatory procedures)  
• Social reason (medial insurance reimbursement, etc.)  
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a deteriorating adverse events  will not be considered as SAEs . For example,

adverse events or worsening of the preexisting condition (e.g., for work -up of 
persistent pre -trial laboratory test abnormality) ; 
• Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physical exam); 
• Hospitalization as per the trial protocol during the study (e.g., as required by the protocol);  
• Elective admission not associated with the aggravation of adverse events (e.g., elective surgery);  
• Predefined treatments or surgical procedures should be documented throughout the 
study program and/or in the baseline data of individual subject ; 
• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products. 
Diagnostic or therapeutic invasive (e.g., oper ation) and non- invasive procedures should 
not be reported as AE, but if the disease condition leading to the operation should be reported if it conforms to the definition of AE, e .g., acute appendicitis during the AE 
reporting period should be reported as AE; therefore, the appendectomy should be 
recorded as the treatment of  the AE. 
8.2.3. Disease Progression  and Death  
Disease progression is defined as the exacerbation of the subject  caused by indications 
of the study drug , including radiological  progression and p rogression of clinical 
symptoms and signs. New metastases relative to the primary tumor and  the progression 
of the original metastases  are both  considered to be progressive disease. Events that are 
life-threatening, requiring initial or prolonged hospitali zation due to symptoms and 
signs of disease progression, which can lead to persistent  or significant disability /  
incapacity  / limiting  work ability are not reported as SAE . If there is any uncertainty 
about  whether SAE is caused by the progression of dise ase, it should be reported as 
SAE.  
All cases of death that occur during the study period must be reported as SAEs, whether or not the subject has received other anti -tumor therapy ( see Section  8.3). The word 
“death ” should not be reported as an AE or SAE term, but as the outcome of the event;  
the AE that causes or contributes to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time 
of reporting, the AE or SAE should be recorded as “unexplained death” , if the cause of 
death  later becomes available, "unexplained death" should be replaced by the 
establishe d cause of death   
If death due to disease progression cannot be attributed by the investigator to a medical 
event,  a Grade 5 “Tumor  progression” should be recorded in the eCRF and reported as 
an SAE. Evidence that the death is due to disease progression (e.g., 
radiological changes 
suggesting tumor growth or progression, clinical deterioration associated with a disease 
process ) should be provided by the investigator.  
8.2.4. Reporting P rocedures  of SAE  
In case of SAE, regardless of first report or follow -up report, the investigator must fill

Form ” immediately , sign and date it, report it to the sponsor within 24h after learning 
of it, and report it to relevant organizations in time as required by regulations.  
The detailed record content of SAE should include symptoms, severity, and association 
with investigational drugs, time of onset, time of treatment, measures taken, follow -up 
time and method as well as outcome. If the investigator considers that a SAE  is not 
related to study drug while potentially related to the study conditions (e.g., terminatio n 
of the original treatment or complications during the trial), the relationship should be described in detail in the narrative section of SAE report form. If there is a change in the severity of an ongoing SAEs  or its relationship with the study drug, follow -up 
reports should be submitted immediately. If misinformation is considered to be present 
in the previously reported SAE, it can be corrected, withdraw or degraded in the follow -
up report, and reported in accordance with the SAE reporting procedures.

8.3. Collection and F ollow -Up of AE/SAE  
The period for AE/SAE collection begins from the time that the subject  provides 
informed consent, through and including 90 days after the last dose of SHR -1210 or  
30 days after the last dose of targeted anti -angiogenic therapy , whichever comes later . 
SAEs that occur after this period , if suspected to be related to study drug, should also 
be collected.  See Table 13 for detailed requirements. An AE/SAE will be followed up 
until it is resolved, returns to the baseline level or ≤ Grade 1, or reaches a stable state, 
or until other reasonable time points (e.g., loss of follow -up, death) . Every effort should 
be made to ensure the final outcome and definite causality assessment is obtained. 
Investigators should inquire about AE/SAE after the last visit at e ach visit and provide 
follow -up data in time according to the sponsor’s queries.  
For the AE/SAE that occurs after extension phase initiation, only SAE should be 
reported to Sponsor via email, and non- serious AE will not be collected. See Table 14

8.4. AEs of Special Interest  
For the AE of special interest ( SIE) specified in the study protocol (as below), 
investigators need to fill in the “ Clinical Trial Serious Adverse Event (SAE)/Special 
Interest Event (SIE) Report Form ” within 24h after the event is known, and report to 
the sponsor.  
• ≥ Grade 3 infusion reaction 
• ≥ Grade 3 immune -related AE  
• AEs that meet the criteria defined in Section 8.4.1 (Liver Function Test [LFT] 
Abnormalities)  
8.4.1. Liver Function Test (LFT) Abnormalities  
Considering the specialty of abnormal liver function at baseline in HCC subjects, 
abnormal values in ALT and/or AST concurrent with abnormal elevations of TBIL that meet the criteria outlined below (i.e., meeting the criteria [1] and [2] for elevated ALT  
or AST and bilirubin as well as the criterion [3]) in the absence of other causes of LFT abnormalities should always be reported as SIE s.  
1) ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN (normal at baseline), ALT or AST ≥  3 × baseline value 
(abnormally elevated at baseline)  
2) TBIL ≥ 2 × ULN (normal at baseline), TBIL ≥  2 × baseline value ( abnormally 
elevated at baseline)  
3) Excluding other causes of LFT abnormalities (e.g., disease progression, acute viral hepatitis, cholestasis, underlying hepatic disease, and concomitant medicat ions with hepatotoxicity).  
Subjects should return to the study center as soon as possible after learning the abnorma l 
results (preferably within 48 hours). Evaluation should include laboratory examination, detailed medical history and physical evaluation.  
Besides repeated measurement of AST and ALT, the laboratory examination should also include albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, γ -glutamyl transferase,

include history of alcohol, acetaminophen, soft drugs, various supplements, family 
history, occupational exposure, sexual behavior history, travel history, contact history with jaundice subject s, surgery, blood transfusion, hepatopathy or allergic diseas e 
history. Further examinations also include detection of acute hepatitis A, B, C and E as well as radiological examination of liver (e.g., biliary passage).  
8.5. Pregnancy  
If a female subject becomes  pregnant during the clinical trial, the subject must 
discont inue the study drug immediately; if the partner of male subject becomes pregnant 
during the clinical trial, the subject can continue the clinical trial.  
For pregnancy of female subjects or partners of the male subjects during this study , 
investigators should fill in “ Pregnancy Report/Follow -up Form in Hengrui  Clinical 
Study”, and report to the sponsor within 24 hours  after invest igator awareness , and 
report to the ethics committee in time.  
The investigator should follow up the pregnancy outcome , until one month after 
delivery, and will report the outcome to Sponsor and Ethics Committee.  
If the outcome of pregnancy is stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, or fetal malformations, it should be considered as an SAE and be reported to Sponsor, regardless  of causality . 
9. CLINICAL MONITORING  
In order to make sure the subject ’s rights are protected, all the data should be reported 
accurately, completely and reliably. The trial should be conducted in accordance with currently approved protocol/revised protocol, ICH-GCP and appropriate regulations; 
clinical monitoring is needed for the study center . 
10. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
A statistical analysis plan  (SAP) will be prepared to provide further details regarding 
the definition of analysis variables and analysis methodology to address all study objectives. The SAP will serve as a compliment to the protocol and where there is a discrepancy between the SAP and protocol, the SAP will supersede it. Any critical revision within the SAP of definition(s) or analysis method(s) f or the primary endpoint s 
will be included in a protocol amendment.  
10.1. Sample S ize Determination  
Assuming a 1:1 randomization between sorafenib and SHR -1210+ rivoceranib, and a 
median PFS time of 3.6 months for subjects in the sorafenib group and  a median PFS 
time of  6 months for subjects in the combination group, 332 PFS events will be 
sufficient to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.60 with 98% power based on Log -rank test 
at significance level of 0.005 one -sided. Similarly, assuming a median survi val time of 
10.5 months for subjects in the sorafenib group and a median survival of 14.6 months 
for subjects in the  combination  group, 359 OS events will be sufficient to detect a 
hazard ratio (HR) of 0.72 with 85% power based on Log -rank test at signific ance level

months  and 19 months for the OS and PFS, respectively, and probability of subject loss 
be approximately 10% per 12 months and per 6 months for the OS and PFS, respectively, 
a sample size of 510 subject s will be enrolled for the study. Power and sample 
calculations were performed using EAST® 6.4.1. software package . 
10.2. Objectives  and Statistical H ypothes es 
10.2.1. Primary Objectives and Statistical Hypotheses  
Objectives: To compare efficacy endpoints of OS and PFS evaluated by the BIRC based on RECIST v1.1 in 2 experimental arms (SHR -1210 in combination with rivoceranib  
versus sorafenib).  
Hypothesis: SHR -1210 in combination with rivoceranib  prolongs OS compared to 
sorafenib.  
Hypothesis: SHR -1210 in combination with rivoceranib  prolongs PFS (assessed by 
BIRC based on RECIST v1.1) compared to sorafenib. 
10.2.2. Key Secondary Objectives and Statistical Hypotheses  
Objective: To compare the ORR (assessed  by BIRC according to RECIST) of SHR -
1210 in combination with rivoceranib  to sorafenib 
Hypothesis: The ORR (assessed by BIRC according to RECIST  v1.1) of SHR -1210 
combined with rivoceranib  is superior to sorafenib . 
10.3. Analysis Populations  
• Intent -to-treat (ITT) : This population will include all randomized subjects. Subjects 
will be included in the experimental arm  to which they are randomized.  
• Safety Analysis Set (SS): This population will include all treated subjects who 
receive at least 1  dose of study treatment. For most subjects, this will be the 
experimental arm  to which they are randomized. For s ubjects who take incorrect 
study treatment for the entire treatment period, safety  data will be analyzed based 
on the treatment they actually receive.   
• Anti-drug Antibody (ADA) Analysis Set: This population will include all subjects 
who receive SHR -1210 in combination with rivoceranib  and had at least 1 ADA 
measurement . 
• PK Analysis Set : This population will include all the subjects who receive PD -1 
antibody SH R-1210 combined with rivoceranib  and who ha ve at least one result 
for drug concentration at any time during the study . 
10.4. Statistical Analysis M ethods

128 the data type. Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the mean, 
standard deviation, median, and range (minimum/maximum). Categorical variables will be presented as frequency counts and percentages. Time -to-event variables will be 
summarized by Kaplan -Meier (K –M) medians and 95%  CI. 
10.4.2. Subject D isposition  
The number of subjects enrolled, treated, discontinued and those with major protocol deviations will be counted. The primary reason for study drug and/or study discontinuation will be summarized according to the categories in the eCRF. The end of study status (alive, dead, withdrew consent or lost to follow -up) at the data cutoff 
date will be summarized.  
10.4.3. Demographics and B aseline C haracteristics  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables inc lude age, weight, vital signs, time since initial can cer 
diagnosis, and time since advanced/metastatic disease diagnosis; categorical variables 
include, gender, ECOG -PS score , geographical region, country, race, Child- Pugh 
classification, hepatitis virus, BCLC staging, metastatic site, and macrovascular 
invasion and/or extrahepatic spread status etc.  
10.4.4. Prior and C oncomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary drug codes. Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized and listed by drug and drug 
class. Prior medications will be defined as medications taken within 28 days of the first  
dose of study drug that were stopped prior to study drug administration. Concomitant medications will be defined as medications  that 1) started before the first dose of study  
drug and were continuing at the time of the first dose of study drug, or 2) started after  
the first dose of study drug. Prior and concomitant medications will be listed. 
10.4.5. Primary Efficacy Endpoints Analyses  
The two primary endpoints for the study are OS and PFS (assessed by BIRC base d on 
RECIST v1.1). For the PFS  endpoint , there is one planned analysis, which is expected 
to occur when ~ 332 PFS events are observed ~ 19 months after first subject enrolled. 
For the OS endpoint, it will be evaluated in the following time points: when PFS is 
analyzed  (approximately 19 months after first subject enrolled) ; when ~ 251 OS events 
(70% at ~23 months after first subject enrolled)  and when 359 OS events are observed 
(at ~36 months  after first subject enrolled ).  
The hypothesis testing of OS and PFS will be evaluated by comparing SHR -1210 plus 
rivoceranib  to sorafenib on their events in ITT using a stratified Log -rank test (based 
on randomization stratification factors).  The hazard ratio (HR=SHR -1210 plus 
rivoceranib  / sorafenib) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) will be 
estimated in a stratified Cox proportional hazard model with experimental arm and 
randomization stratification factors included in the m odel. Survival  curves for each 
treatment group will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) product -limit method. 
A 95% CI for median survival time  will be estimated by Brookmeyer -Crowley method. 
The above analyses  will be repeated without the stratification factors included in the

129 analysis. In case the proportional hazard is not valid , Wilcoxon test  or RMST  
(Restric ted M ean S urvival Time) method may  be performed  for OS and PFS analysis . 
Detail of multiplicity control can be found in Section 10.4.12.  
Further detail, including censoring rules, will be provided in the SAP. 
10.4.6. Secondary E fficacy E ndpoints Analyse s 
Objective response rate (ORR) assessed by BIRC according to RECIST v1.1 will be 
analyzed as a key secondary endpoint when 70% OS events are observed. If both PFS and OS primary endpoints are positive, comparison between treatment groups in ORR by BIRC according to RECIST v1.1 wil l be performed using stratified Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel (CMH) test. Difference in proportions for ORR and its 95% CI using normal approximation will be provided. Overall response rates and their corresponding 95% exact CIs will be calculated by Clopper -Pearson method for each treatment group.  
The other time -to-event endpoints will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier (KM) 
product -limit method, unless specified. A 95% CI for median survival time will be 
estimated by Brookmeyer -Crowley method, if necessary.  
For other binary variables, stratified CMH test will be used and two -sided 95% CI for  
treatment difference will be calculated using normal approximation.  
Further elaborations will be provided in the SAP. 
10.4.7. Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity  
The incidence of  ADA and the proportion of subjects with neutralizing active antibodies 
(Nab)  in subject s treated with SHR -1210 in combination with rivoceranib  will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics by experimental arm  and by visit. ADA/Nab in 
combination with SH R-1210 concentration, safety, and efficacy will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics  (see Section  10.4.8) . Any other analysis methods will be 
elaborated in the corresponding analysis plan.  
The population PK , exposure -QTc analysis and exposure -response analysis will be 
performed and reported sepa rately.  
10.4.8. Exploratory E ndpoints Analyses  
The time to deterioration ( TTD ) of EORTC QLQ -C30 endpoints will be analyzed using 
similar method for the primary endpoint OS (stratified Cox model and K -M curve). The 
scores of other scales and the average change from the baseline will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment cycle.  
The correlation of the expression level of PD -L1 and proportion of strong expression 
of PD -L1 in tumor tissue  with the efficacy of SHR -1210 combined with rivoceranib  
mesylate (including but not limited to ORR, OS) will be summarized using descr iptive 
statistics. If necessary, an ad hoc  analysis will be performed and results will be 
presented in a separate supplementary report.

events  (irAE), study drug -related A E with CTCAE grade ≥  3, drug -related SAE) with 
SHR -1210 ADA/Nab status in experimental arm will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics. If necessary, a comparison of efficacy and safety will be performed according  
to the ADA status.  
PFS, TTP, ORR and D oR assessed by investigator based on imRECIST will be 
evaluated using the same analytical method s for the secondary endpoints.  
Other analytical methods for exploratory endpoints will be elaborated in the SAP. 
10.4.9. Handling of M issing D ata 
Except for the special  cases, the following rules will be applied to the missing date  of 
the events.  
If the start date of the event is all missing, it will not be imputed. If the day is miss ing, 
but the year and month are consistent with the year and month of the study drug 
treatment, the day of the first study drug treatment will be used. Otherwise, the first d ay 
of the month will be used. If the day of end date is missing, but the year and month are consistent with the year and month of the end of study drug treatment, the day  of 
end - of-treatment will be used. Otherwise, the last day of the month will be used.  
If the month and day of the event are missing, but the year of occurrence is consistent with the year of study drug treatment, the month and day of the first study drug treatment will be used. Otherwise, January 1 will be used.  
All imputation dates should be prior to the date of withdrew consent, lost to follow -up 
or death.  
10.4.10. Safety Analyse s 
10.4.10.1. Analyses of Adverse E vents  
Adverse events will be coded to MedDRA (v 18.1 or higher) for lower level term (LT), preferred term (PT) and primary system organ class (SOC).  
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event (AE) that 
had an onset date after the start of the study treatment or that worsened in severity from  
baseline (pretreatment).  
Only those AEs that were treatment- emergent will be included in summary tables. All 
AEs, treatment -emergent or otherwise, will be presented in subject data listings.  
The incidence of TEAEs will be reported as the number  (percentage) of subjects with 
TEAEs by SOC and preferred term. A subject will be counted only once by the highest severity grade per NCI -CTCAE v 4.03 within an SOC and preferred term, even if the 
subject experienced more than 1 TEAE within a specific SOC and preferred term. The number (percentage) of subjects with TEAEs will also be summarized by relationship to the study drug. Treatment -related AEs include those events considered by the 
investigator to be definitely, possibly related to study treatment or with missing

Subject incidence of AE, SAE, AE with CTCAE Grade ≥ 3, SAE with CTCAE Grade  
≥ 3, drug related AE, drug related SAE, AE with incidence ≥  5%, SAE with incidence 
≥ 5%, AE leading to dose adjustment, AE leading to discontinued treatment etc. will be 
tabulated by experimental arm . Time -to-adverse events of special interest, and duration 
of events will be analyzed using K -M method.  
10.4.10.2. Laboratory Tests Results  
Clinical laboratory (e .g., hematology, blood biochemistry ) values will be evaluated as 
appropriate. Abnormal laboratory values will be flagged and identified as those outside 
(above or below) the normal range. The number and percentage of subjects 
experiencing Clinically significant laboratory values  at baseline and worst post -dosing 
will be summarized by shift table.  
Laboratory parameters that are graded in NCI -CTCAE v 4.03 will be summarized by 
NCI-CTCAE grade. In the summary of laboratory parameters by NCI -CTCAE grade, 
parameters with NCI -CTCAE grad ing in both high and low directions will be 
summarized separately.   
10.4.10.3. Others  
The number and percentage of findings of clinically  significant abnormal for vital signs 
will be summarized by experimental arm. A listing will also be provided for vital signs.  
The analyses of ECOG -PS will include summary statistics of baseline and highest score 
post baseline by experimental arm . 
The analyses of  ECG will include summary statistics of baseline and worst clinically 
abnormal grade post baseline by experimental arm .  
10.4.11. Interim Analyse s 
In this study, there is only one planned PFS analysis, which is planned at occur when 
~332 PFS events are observed (at ~19 months ). OS analyses will be conducted at the 
following time points: at final PFS analysis, at 251 (70%) deaths if there are less than 251 deaths at the final PFS analysis, and when ~ 359 OS events are observed (at ~36 
months.  
PFS 
If SHR -1210 in combination with rivoceranib arm demonstrated superiority over 
sorafenib  (i.e., one -sided p -value < 0.005) , its corresponding alpha level of 0.005 will 
be re- allocated to test the OS hypothesis at 0.025 one -sided with updated efficacy 
boundaries per Lan -DeMets O'Brien -Fleming spending function (see Table 15 ).  
OS 
A formal interim analysis (IA) for OS will be conducted after 70% (~251) of the target OS events are observed at ~23 months. The OBF was used for calculating efficacy boundaries (origina l 0.020/updated 0.025 alpha level). With ~251 OS events, the SHR -
Study Drug Number: SHR -1210

Version 6.0, 21 Sep 2022  
 
HENGRUI CONFIDENTIAL  
132 1210 in combination with rivoceranib mesylate will be considered superior than the 
sorafenib at the interim analysis, if the one -sided p -value for OS is less than 0.005/0.007, 
which corresponds to an observed HR  of approximately 0.725/0.735. The trial will be 
considered positive at the final analysis, if the one -sided p- value for OS is less than 
0.018/0.023, which corresponds to an observed HR of approximately 0.802/0.810. If 
the null hypothes is for OS is rejected at either the interim (70%) or the final, its 
corresponding alpha level of 0.020 will be re -allocated to PFS so that the hypothesis 
for PFS maybe tested again at 0.025 one -sided. The boundary properties for the planned 
OS analyses based on the original and updated alpha levels can be found in Table 15
 .  
In an anticipation that the number of OS events is < 251 OS events at the planned PFS 
analysis, a nominal alpha of 0.001% will be spent at the time of the planned PFS analysis. Since the trial will not stop early if there are less than 251 deaths,  the 0.001% 
is considered for administr ative purposes  to avoid trial stop early. T he study will 
continue to the next planned OS interim analysis (70%) and could continue to final analysis after ~251 OS events and ~359 OS events are observed, respectively, according to the efficacy boundaries  as described in  Table 15  . 
The analysis of PFS and the formal interim analysis (IA) of OS will be conducted by a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) that recommends early discontinuation of the study for unequivocal efficacy at formal interim analysis (IA) of OS (~70% events), or continuation of the study for final analysis of OS. 
10.4.12. Multiplicity  
The two primary endpoints for the study are OS and PFS (assessed by BIRC base d on 
RECIST v1.1). There is only one planned PFS analysis, which is expected to occur 
when approximately 332 PFS events are observed at approximately 19 months. OS analyses will be conducted at the following time points: at final PFS analysis,  at 251 
(70%) deaths if there are less than 251 deaths at the final PFS analysis,  and when ~359 
OS events are observed at ~36 months, respectively.  
The Type I error of 0.025 one -side is strongly controlled using the Weighted -Holm 
procedure with α-reallocation approach between PFS and OS endpoints as de scribed in 
Ye et al 2013 
[27] and O ’Brien -Fleming alpha -spending function (OBF) within OS. The 
allocated α between two endpoints is α 1=0.005 (one -sided) for PFS and α 2=0.020 (one -
sided) for OS. If PFS endpoint is significant at α 1=0.005, its α 1 level will be re -allocated 
to endpoint OS so that the hypothesis for OS may be tested using its updated efficacy 
boundaries based on α level 0.025. Similarly, if endpoint OS is significant at α 2=0.020 
according to the efficacy boundaries as determined by OBF, and PFS endpoint is not 
significant at α1=0.005, its α 2 level will be re -allocated to PFS so that the hypothesis for 
PFS may be tested again at α level 0.025 (one -sided). The boundary properties for the 
planned OS analyses based on the original and updated alpha levels are summarized in Table 15   below:

group is superior than Sorafenib arm. The one -sided nominal significance level and 
stopping boundary will be determined by the actual percentage of events when the 
interim analysis is conducted.  
If both PFS and OS endpoints are not significant, then α -reallocation will not perform. 
If both the PFS and OS endpoints are significant, ORR assessed by BIRC according to RECIST  v1.1 may be tested at 0.025 one -sided. The graphical approach in Figure 8  
shows the α -reallocation strategy for endpoints PFS and OS

Above shows the initial one -sided α-allocation for each hypothesis in the ellipse 
representing the hypothesis. The weights for re -allocation from each hypothesis to 
another are represented in the rectangular boxes on the lines connecting hypotheses. 
When there are less than 251 OS events at the planned PFS analysis at ~19 months, a 
nominal α (0.001%, independe nt of OBF approach to allocate alpha) will be used, but 
the trial will not stop based on this OS result at the time of the PFS analysis. The study 
will continue to the next planned OS interim analysis (70%) and could continue to the 
final analysis after ~251 OS events and ~359 OS events at ~23 and ~36 months, 
respectively, at the alpha level as determined by the OBF boundaries and the actual 
number of OS events observed. The nominal alpha (0.001%) is considered, as this has 
negligible impact on overall Type I error rate and the study will not stop early for a 
positive OS result at the time of the PFS analysis.  
Any changes to the above strategy will be documented elsewhere, if  not in a protocol 
amendment, at the earliest time before any formal analysis is being conducted.

10.5. Blinded Independent Review Committee  
A BIRC will be established to perform an independent review of all radiological images  
(imag ing for tumor assessment will be provided by study center s to BIRC) , and to 
determine all instances of response and disease progression on the basis of RECIST 
v1.1 and mRECIST criteria. If the investigator evaluates it as PD according to the 
RECIST v1.1 criteria, all radiological  data must be submitted to BIRC, and PD will 
have to be confirmed by BIRC ( Please refer to Figure  7 for PD confirmation process ), 
and even if BIRC confirms PD per RECIST v1.1, the investigator needs to evaluate whether the subject continues to have benefit and meet the criteria for continued treatment beyond disease progression, and if so, the subject will continue the treatment 
and continue to be perform ed tumor radiological  assessments.  
The tumor assessment by BIRC will be used for the reporting of the study results. All decisions made during the performance of the study will be on the basis of the local investigator ’s assessment  of radiographic images, clinical status, and relevant 
examination of the subject s. Sites will submit specific radiographic image files to the 
centralized data review facility during the study at an ongoing basis or at the sponsor ’s 
request. Detail rules and guidelines for radiographic radiological  and tumor assessments 
by BIRC will be  outlined separately in  the DMC c harter, Image Acquisition Guidelines , 
and Central Laboratory Manual . 
10.6. Data M onitoring C ommittee  
The study will establish a n independent  Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to 
regularly assess safety data, and analysis will be conducted for assessment of efficacy and safety  at the time of PFS analysis and OS interim analysis . The DMC will provide 
advice on the measures that must be taken for p rotection of subjects and overall safety 
evaluation to the sponsor.  
The DMC is the consultant to the study team of the sponsor. The study team of the

RECI ST (imRECI ST) and Modified RECIST (mRECIST)  
RECIST v1.1 
1. Measurability of tumor at baseline  
1.1 Definitions  
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or non -
measurable as follows:  
Measurable  
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter 
in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm).  
 10 mm caliper measurem ent by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable).  
 20 mm by chest X -ray. 
 Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, 
a lymph node must be 15 mm in short  axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
Non-measurable  
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with 10 to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non -measurable lesions. 
Lesions considered truly non- measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural  or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement 
of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical 
exam that is not measurable by reproducible radiological  techniques.  
Special considerations rega rding lesion measurability  
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require 
particular comment: 
Bone lesions:  
 Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate radiological  
techniques to measure bone lesi ons. However, these techniques can be used to 
confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.

146  Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by cross sectional radiological  techniqu es such 
as CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component 
meets the definition of measurability described above. 
 Blastic bone lesions are non- measurable.  
Cystic lesions: 
 Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since 
they are, by definition, simple cysts.  
 ‘Cystic lesions ’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they  meet the definition of measurability described above. 
However, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same subject , these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.  
Lesions with prior local treatment:  
 Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to 
other loco- regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has 
been demonstrated progression in the lesion. Study protocols should detail the 
conditions under which such lesions would be cons idered measurable.  
1.2 Specifications by methods of measurements  
Measurement of lesions  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically 
assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
Method of assessment  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characteri ze 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Radiological  based 
evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion 
being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they ar e 
superficial and 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As noted above, when lesions can be evaluat ed by 
both clinical exam and radiological , radiological  evaluation should be undertaken since 
it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study.  
Chest X -ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is 
an im portant endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying 
new lesions. However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they are

147 clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently ava ilable and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions 
on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT 
scans have slice thickness greater t han 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion 
should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).  
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method  of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessm ent to the next. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of 
the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised. However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response. If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must normali ze for a subject  to be c onsidered in complete response . Because tumor markers 
are disease specific, instructions for their measurement should be incorporated into 
protocols on a disease specific basis. Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in 
recurrent ovarian cancer) and  PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer), have been 
published. In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA125 progression criteria which are to be integrated with objective tumor  assessment for use 
in first -line trials in ovarian ca ncer.  
Cytology, histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases if required by protocol (for example, residual lesions in tumor  types such 
as germ cell tumor s, where known residual benign tumors can remain). When ef fusions 
are known to be a potential adverse effect of treatment (e.g. with certain taxane 
compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic 
origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment can be considere d if the 
measurable tumor  has met criteria for response or stable disease in order to differentiate 
between response (or stable disease) and progressive disease.  
2. Tumor response evaluation  
2.1 Evaluation of target lesions  
Complete Response (CR): Disappe arance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Study Drug Number: SHR -1210  
Protocol Number: SHR -1210- III-310 
Version 6.0, 21 Sep 2022  
 
HENGRUI CONFIDENTIAL  
148 Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relativ e increase of 20%, the sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).  
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
2.2 Special notes on the assessment of target lesions  
Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when  lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the ‘ sum’ of lesions may not be 
zero even if CR criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short 
axis of <10 mm. Case report forms or other data collection methods may therefore be design ed to have target nodal lesions recorded in a separate section where, in order to 
qualify for CR, each node must achieve a short axis <10 mm. For PR, SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions. 
Target lesions that become ‘ too small to measure ’: While on study, all lesions (nodal 
and non- nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at 
each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g. 2 mm). However, sometimes 
lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint 
on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being ‘ too small to measure ’. When this occurs it is important 
that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opinion of the radiologist 
that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measur e, a default 
value of 5 mm should be assigned (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by fat such as in the retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well). This default value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying C T slice thickness). The 
measurement of these lesions is potentially non -reproducible, therefore providing this 
default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement error. To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.  
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment: When non- nodal lesions ‘ fragment ’, the 
longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target le sion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be 
maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘ coalesced lesion ’.

149 2.3 Evaluation of non -target lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor  response 
for the group of non -target lesions. While some non- target lesions may actually be 
measurable, they need not be measured and instead should be assessed only 
qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol.  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non- target lesio ns and normali zation of 
tumor  marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short 
axis).  
Non-complete Response or non- PD: Persistence of one or more non- target lesion and/or 
maintenance of tumor  marker level above the normal limits .  
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions. Note: 
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.  
2.4 Special notes on assessment of progression of non -target disease  
The concept of progression of non- target disease requires additional explanation as 
follows . 
When the subject  also has measurable disease: In this setting, to achieve ‘ unequivocal 
progression’ on the basis of the non- target disease, there must be an overall level of 
substantial worsening in non- target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in 
target disease, the overall tumor  burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy. A modest ‘ increase’ in the size of one or more non- target 
lesions is  usually not sufficient to quality for unequivocal progression status. The 
designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non- target disease in 
the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.   
When the subject  has only non- measurable disease: This circumstance arises in some 
phase 3 trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable disease. The 
same general concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there is no measurable dis ease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non-
measurable disease burden. Because worsening in non- target disease cannot be easily 
quantified (by definition: if all lesions are truly non -measurable) a useful test that can 
be applie d when assessing subject s for unequivocal progression is to consider if the 
increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non- measurable disease is 
comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease: i.e. an increase in tumor  burden representing an additional 73% 
increase in ‘ volume ’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable 
lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘ trace’ to ‘large ’, an 
increase in ly mphangitic disease from localiz ed to widespread, or may be described in 
protocols as ‘ sufficient to require a change in therapy ’. If ‘unequivocal progression’ is 
seen, the subject  should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While it 
would be  ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non- measurable disease, the very 
nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so, therefore the increase must be substantial.

HENGRUI CONFIDENTIAL  
150 The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progress ion; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for 
the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: i.e. not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in radiological  modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor  
(for example, some ‘ new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre -existing 
lesions). This is particularly important when the subject ’s baseline lesions show partial  
or complete response . For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT 
scan report as a ‘ new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.  
A lesion identified on a follow -up study in an anatomical location that was not s canned 
at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the subject  who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT 
or MRI brain ordered which reveals metastases. The subject ’s brain metas tases are 
considered to be evidence of PD even if he/she did not have brain radiological  at 
baseline.  
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans 
confirm there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.  
While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible ‘ new’ disease). New lesions on the 
basis of FDG -PET radiological  can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positivel FDG- PET at follow -up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion.  
No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: 
If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed 
by CT, this is PD.  
If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -
PET scan).  
If the positive F DG-PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on 
CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. 
2.6 Missing assessments and not evaluable designation  
When no radiological /measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the subject  
is not evaluable (NE) at that time point. If only a subset of lesion measurements are 
made at an assessment, usually the case is also considered NE at that time point, unless a convincing argument can be made that the con tribution of the individual missing 
lesion would not change the assigned time point response.

151 2.7 Special notes on response assessment  
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to 
‘normal ’ size (<10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans. This 
measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstat e progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, 
this means that subject s with CR may not have a total sum of ‘ zero’ on the case report 
form (CRF).  
In trials where confirmation of response is required, repeated ‘ NE’ time point 
assessments may complicate best response determination. The analysis plan for the trial must address how missing data/assessments will be addressed in determination of response and progression. For example, in most trials it is reasonable to conside r a 
subject  with time point responses of PR -NE-PR as a confirmed response.  
Subject s with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as ‘symptomatic deterioration ’. Every effort should be made to document 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response: it is a reason for stopping study therapy. The objective response status of such subject s is to be determined by 
evaluation of target and non- target disease as shown in Tables  1-3 below . 
Conditions that define ‘early progression, early death and inevaluability ’ are study 
specific and should be clearly describe d in each protocol (depending on treatment 
duration, treatment periodicity).  
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the evaluation of complete response  depends upon this determination, it 
is recom mended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) 
before assigning a status of complete response . FDG- PET may be used to upgrade a 
response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormali ty is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. The use of FDG -PET in this 
circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease specific medical literature for the indication. However, it must be acknowledged that both a pproaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and 
biopsy resolution/sensitivity.

‘Non-CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘ stable disease ’ for non- target disease since SD is increasingly used 
as endpoint for assessment of efficacy in  some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be 
measured is not advised.  
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g. very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic 
changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next  scheduled 
assessment. If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected.

153 meeting PR criteria relative to baseline,  makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have 
reappeared after CR). Best response would depend on whether minimum duration  for SD was met. 
However, sometimes ‘ CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still 
present and in fact the subject  had PR, not CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the 
original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.  
2.8 Confirmatory measurement/duration of response  
Confirmation  
In non- randomi zed trials wh ere response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR 
and CR is required to ensure responses identified are not the result of measurement 
error. In randomized trials (phase 2  or 3) or studies where stable disease or progression 
are the primary endpoints, confirmation of response is not required since it will not add value to the interpretation of trial results. In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval (in general not less than 6–8 weeks) that is defined in the study protocol. 
Duration of overall response  
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or PD  
is objectively documented (taking as reference for PD  the smallest measurements 
recorded on study). The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement 
criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of stable disease  
Stable disease is measured from the start o f the treatment (in randomized trials, from 
date of randomization) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of PD).  The clinical relevance of the duration of stable disease varies in 
different studies and diseases. If the proportion of subject s achieving stable disease for 
a minimum period of time is an endpoint of importance in a particular trial, the protocol should specify the mini mal time interval required between two measurements for 
determination of stable disease.  
Note: The DoR  and stable disease as well as the PFS are influenced by the frequency 
of follow -up after baseline evaluation. It is not in the scope of this guideline to define a 
standard follow -up frequency. The frequency should take into account many parameters 
including disease types and stages, treatment periodicity and standard practice. However, these limitations of the precision of the measured endpoint should be t aken 
into account if comparisons between trials are to be made.  
2.9 Progression -free survival/proportion progression -free 
Phase 3 trials in advanced cancers are increasingly designed to evaluate PFS  or TTP as 
the primary outcome of interest. Assessment of progression is relatively straightforward if the protocol requires all subject s to have measurable disease. Increasingly, trials allow 
entry of both subject s with measurable disease as well as those with n on-measurable 
disease only. In this circumstance, care must be taken to explicitly describe the findings which would qualify for PD for those subject s without measurable lesions. Because the

Briefly, immune -modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (imRECIST)  
allows for collection of additional scans and for BOR to occur after radiologic PD 
assessment(s) in subject s continuing treatment ( see Table  4 below ). New lesions are 
added to the total tumor burden along with the sum of the target lesions when measurable; when not measurable, they are not factored into the PD assessment. In addition, progression in non- target lesions does not define PD. For analysis of 
imRECIST -defined PFS (imPFS), imRECIST PD or death is considered an event; 
however, an imRECIST PD is not considered an imPFS event if the time point response at the subsequent scan (≥  4 weeks later) is imRECIST SD/PR/CR. An imRECIST PD 
followed by no a dditional assessments is considered an imPFS event.

When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a 
maximum of 5  lesions total (and a maximum of 2 lesions per organ) representative of 
all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.  
Non-Target Lesions  
After baseline, changes in non- target lesions will contribute only in the assessment of 
CR (i.e., a CR is attained only with the complete disappearance of all tumor lesions, 
including non- target lesions) and will not be used to assess PD . 
New Lesions  
During the study, all new lesions identified and recorded after baseline must be assessed  
at all tumor assessme nt timepoints. New lesions will also be evaluated for measurability 
with use of the same criteria applied to prospective target lesions at baseline per RECIST, (e.g., non −lymph node lesions must be ≥  10 mm; see note for new lymph node 
lesions below). Up to a maximum of 5 new lesions total (and a maximum of 2 lesions 
per organ), all with measurements at all timepoints, can be included in the tumor response evaluation. New lesion types that would not qualify as target lesions per RECIST cannot be included in the tumor response evaluation but can be used for CR 
exclusion . 
New lesions that are not measurable at first appearance but meet measurability criteria 
at a subsequent timepoint will be measured from that point on and contribute to the sum of longest diame ters (SLD), if the maximum number of 5 measurable new lesions being 
followed has not been reached.

157 Calculation of Sum of the Diameters  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for 
all target lesions will be calculated as a measure of tumor burden.  
The sum of the diameters is calculated at baseline and at each tumor assessment for the 
purpose of classification of tumor responses.  
Sum of the Diameters at Baseline:  The sum of the diameters for all target lesions  
identified at baseline prior to treatment on Day 1.  
Sum of the Diameters at Tumor Assessment: For every on- study tumor assessment 
collected per protocol or as clinically indicated the sum of the diameters at tumor assessment will be calculated using tumor  radiological  scans. All target lesions selected 
at baseline and up to 5 new measurable lesions (with a maximum of 2 new lesions per organ) that have emerged after baseline will contribute to the sum of the diameters at tumor assessment. Hence, each net percentage change in tumor burden per assessment with use of modified RECIST accounts for the size and growth kinetics of both old and new lesions as they appear.  
Note: In the case of new lymph nodes, RECIST v1.1 criteria for measurability (equivalent to bas eline target lesion selection) will be followed. That is, if at first 
appearance the short axis of a new lymph node lesion ≥ 15 mm, it will be considered a measurable new lesion and will be tracked and included in the SLD. Thereafter, the lymph node lesion will be measured at subsequent timepoints and measurements will 
be included in the SLD, even if the short axis diameter decreases to <15 mm (or even 
<10 mm). However, if it subsequently decreases to <  10 mm, and all other lesions are 
no longer detectable (or have also decreased to a short axis diameter of < 10 mm if lymph nodes), then a response assessment of CR may be assigned.  
If at first appearance the short axis of a new lymph node is ≥ 10 mm and < 15 mm, the lymph node will not be considered measurabl e but will still be considered a new lesion. 
It will not be included in the SLD unless it subsequently becomes measurable (short axis diameter ≥ 15 mm).  
The appearance of new lymph nodes with diameter < 10 mm should not be considered pathological and not c onsidered a new lesion.  
Response Criteria  
Timepoint Response  
It is assumed that at each protocol -specified timepoint, a response assessment occurs. 
Table 6 provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each timepoint for subject s who have measurable disease at baseline.  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non -target lesions. Lymph 
nodes that shrink to <10 mm short axis are considered normal. 
Study Drug Number: SHR -1210 
Protocol Number: SHR -1210- III-310 
Version 6.0, 21 Sep 2022  
 
HENGRUI CONFIDENTIAL  
158 Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of all 
target and all new measurable lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR.  
Note: the appearance of new measurable lesions is factored into the overall tumor burden but does not automatically qualify as PD  until the sum of the diameters increases 
by ≥ 20%  when compared with the sum of the diameters at nadir.  
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of the diam eters while 
on study.  
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of all target and selected new measurable lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir SLD; this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
Impact of New Lesions on imRECIST  
New lesions alone do not qualify as progressive disease. However, their contribution to total tumor burden is included in the sum of the diameters, which is used to determine 
the overall modified RECIST tumor response.  
Missing Assessments and Not Evaluable Designation  
When no radiological /measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the s ubject  
is considered not evaluable (NE) at that timepoint. If only a subset of lesion measurements is made at an assessment, usually the case is also considered NE at that 
timepoint, unless a convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned timepoint response. This would only happen in the case of PD. For example, if a subject  had a baseline sum of 
50 mm with 3 measured lesions and at follow -up only 2 lesions were assessed but those 
gave  a sum of 80 mm, the subject  will be assigned PD status, regardless of the 
contribution of the missing lesion.

164 APPENDIX 6.   Recommended Treatment Procedures for 
Common Immune -Related Adverse Events  
When dealing with immune -related AEs, the investigator may refer to the following 
treatment procedures for common immune -related AEs. These procedures are 
recommended based on Management of Toxicities From Immunotherapy: ESMO 
Clinical Practice Guidelines for Diagnosis, Treatment and Follow -Up (Annals of 
Oncology 28 (supplement 4):iv119- iv142, 2017)” in combination with this study 
protocol. 
The general principle is that AEs should go through careful assessment and differential 
diagnosis in accordance with medical  standards ; non- inflammatory causes should be 
considered and properly managed.  
Corticosteroids are the main therapeutic agents for I mmuno- Oncology (I -O) drug 
related AEs. Subject s with low -grade toxicities who can walk around may consider oral 
doses equivalent to recommended intravenous doses. If the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids is changed, the lower bioavailability of oral corticosteroids should be 
considered.  
It is recommended to consult with physicians or surgeons, especially prior to invasive diagnosis or treatment.

Renal injury occurs in around 1% -4% of subject s treated with ICPi, usually a pattern of acute

baseline creatinine, not just abnormal results per bioche mistry upper limit of normal (ULN). 
Confounding diagnoses include dehydration, recent i.v. contrast, urinary tract infection, 
medications, hypotension, or hypertension. Early consideration for renal biopsy is helpful which 
may negate the need for steroids and determine whether renal deterioration is related to ICPi or other pathology. Oliguria should prompt insubject  admission for careful fluid balance and plan for 
renal replacement therapy. Steroid wean: begin to wean once creatinine Grade 1; Grade 2 sever ity

172 6. General recomm endations for immunization related toxicity treatment  
Management of skin rash/toxicity:  
• For Grade 1–2 skin AEs, continue (at least 1 week) with ICPis. Start topical 
emollients, antihistamines in the case of pruritus and/or topical (mild strength) 
corticosteroid creams. Reinitiate ICPi when  ≤ Grade  1. 
• For Grade 3 skin AEs, interrupt ICPi and start imme diate treatment with topical 
emollients, antihistamines and high strength corticosteroid creams. [II, B]  
• For Grade 4 skin AEs, discontinue ICPi (permanently), consider admitting subject  
and always consult dermatologist immediately. Start i.v. corticosteroids [1–2 mg/kg 
(methyl) prednisone] and taper based on response of AE. [II, B]  
• Stevens -Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are rare 
but life -threathening severe cutaneous adverse reaction. Patients with SJS/TEN 
usually develop mucosa l erosions or ulcers with variable extents of skin 
detachment after immunotherapy for a period of 1- 3 weeks, it also may occur 
several months after  treatment initiation.  SJS and TEN are thought be a spectrum 
of the same disease.  SJS, overlapping SJS/TEN, a nd TEN are characterized by 
separation of the dermis involving <10%, 10% -30%, and >30% body surface area 
(BSA) . The management of Stevens -Johnson syndrome (SJS) /toxic epidermal 
necrolysis (TEN)  is detailed  in below  Table 16.  
Table 16  SJS/TEN management and treatment  
Early identification and management  
·Inform patients of the symptoms and signs of SJS/TEN; advise patients to promptly 
notify investigator if signs of SJS/TEN occur  
·Consider w ithhold study drugs ( SHR -1210 and rivoceranib ) and monitor patients 
closely every 3 days with Grade 2 immune -related rash for progression to 
involvement of greater BSA and/or mucous membrane involvement. Initiate 
therapy  with topical corticosteroids . Consider initiation of prednisone (or 
equivalent) 0.5- 1 mg/kg tapered over at least 4 weeks  
·In cases of suspected SJS , withhold study drugs and consider early admission  for 
further monitoring and treatment.  
Initial assessment on presentation  
·Review patient history, and a full list of patient medications  
·Total body skin examination with attention to ALL mucous membranes as well as a 
complete review of systems  
·Rule out any other etiology of the skin problem, such as an infection, another drug, 
or a skin condition linked to another systemic disease  
·Perform skin biopsies for full -thickness epidermal necrosis  to confirm the diagnosis

173 of SJS/TEN . 
Treatment for SJS/TEN  
·Should permanently discontinue SHR -1210  and rivoceranib  once SJS/TEN is 
confirmed  
·Should a dmit patient immediately  with urgent consultation with  dermatolog ist 
·Initiate IV (methyl)  prednisolone (or equivalent) 1- 2 mg/kg, wean over at least 4 
weeks  when toxicity resolves to Grade ≤1. May consider intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIG) or cyclosporine as an alternative or in corticosteroid -
refractory cases  
·For mucous membrane involvement of SJS or TEN, seek urgent dermatology, 
ophthalmology, and urology consultation to prevent sequelae from s carring  
·Supportive care should include assessment and management of skin wounds, fluid 
and nutrition status, electrolyte balance, renal and airway function, preventing 
infection, and adequate pain control  
·Seek infectious disease consultation if patient might have secondary cellulitis or if 
patient has other infection risk factors, such as neutropenia, etc.  
 
Immune -related endocrinopathies  
• For subject s with Grade 2 symptomatic hyperthyroism, interrupt ICPi, start beta -
blocker therapy (propranolol or atenolol/metoprolol). Restart ICPi when asymptomatic [IV –V,  B ] .  
• In the case of hypothyroidism, rarely> Grade 2, start HRT depending on the severity 
(50–100 lg/day). Increase the dose until TSH is normal. In the case of inflammation 
of the thyroid gland, sta rt prednisone orally 1 mg/kg. Taper based on recovery of 
clinical symptoms. Consider interruption of ICPi treatment when symptomatic [IV –
V,  B ] .  
• In the case of hypophysitis (rarely> Grade 2), when headache, diplopia or other 
neurological symptoms are present , start (methyl) prednisone 1 mg/kg orally and 
taper over 2–4 weeks. Start HRT depending on the affected hormonal axis 
(levothyroxine, hydrocortisol, testosterone) [V , B]. 
• In subject s with type I DM Grade 3 to 4 [ketoacidotic (sub)coma], admit to hospital 
immediately and start treatment of newly onset type I DM [I, A]. Role of corticosteroids in preventing complete loss of insulin producing cells is unknown and not recommended.  
Gastrointestinal hepatotoxicity  
• In subject s with non- severe diarrhoea ( Grade 1), ICPi can be continued. Treatment 
with antidiarrhoeal medication (e.g. loperamide) should be prescribed [IV –V,  B ] .

174 • In Grade 2 diarrhoea, ICPi should be interrupted and the subject  should start with 
corticosteroids depending on the severity and other symptoms (either budesonide 
or oral corticosteroids 1 mg/kg). In the case of no improvement within 3–5 days, 
colonoscopy should be carried out and, in the case of colitis, infliximab 5 mg/kg should be administered [IV –V,  B ] .  
• In subject s with severe diarrhoea ( Grade 3 to 4), permanently discontinue ICPi. 
Admit subject  to the hospital and initiate (methyl) prednisone 2 mg/kg i.v. Add 
MMF if improvement is observed within 2–3 days. Consult a hepatologist if no 
improvement under double immunosuppression. Other immunosuppressive drugs to consider are ATG and tacrolimus. Consult or refer subject  to an experienced 
center. Taper over 6 weeks under close monitoring of liver tests [IV –V,  B ] .  
Immune -related pneumonitis  
• For subject s with Grade  2 pneumonitis, interrupt ICPi therapy, try to rule out 
infection and start with prednisone 1–2 mg/kg orally. Taper over 4–6 weeks [IV –V,  
B]. 
• In Grade 3 and 4 pneumonitis, discontinue ICPi permanently, admit the subject  to 
the hospital, even ICU if necessary and immediately start high -dose (methyl) 
prednisone 2–4 mg/kg i.v. Add infliximab, MMF or cyclophosphamide in the case of deterioration under steroids. Taper over a period of 4–6 weeks [IV –V,  B ] .  
Cardiac toxicity  
• When a myocarditis is suspected, admit the subject  and immediately start high -
dose (methyl) prednisone (1 –2 mg/kg). In the case of deterioration, consider adding 
another immunosuppressive drug (MMF or tacrolimus) [V , B]. 
Rheumatological toxicity 
• For mild a rthralgia, start NSAIDs, and in the case of no improvement, consider 
low -dose steroids (10 –20 mg prednisone). In the case of severe polyarthritis, refer 
subject  to or consult a rheumatologist and start prednisone 1 mg/kg. Sometimes 
infliximab or another a nti-TNFa drug is required for improvement of arthritis [V , 
B]. 
Renal toxicity  
• In case of nephritis, rule out other causes of renal failure first. Interrupt or 
permanently discontinue ICPi depending on the severity of the renal insufficiency. Stop other nephrotoxic drugs. Start (methyl) prednisone 1–2 mg/kg. Consider renal 
biopsy to confirm diagnosis [V , B].  
Notes: ALT =alanine transaminase, AST =aspartate transaminase, ATG =anti-thymocyte globulin, 
DM=diabetes mellitus , HRT =hormone replacement therapy , ICPi=immune checkpoint inhibitor , 
ICU=intensive care unit , Ig=immunoglobulin, MMF =mycophenolate mofetil , MRI =magnetic 
resonance radiological , NSAIDs =nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs , TNFa =tumor  necrosis 
factor alpha, TSH =thyroid -stimulating hormone .

176 APPENDIX 7.  Grade and Management  of Reactive Capillary 
Endothelial Proliferation  (RCEP)  
RCEP mostly occurs on the surface of the skin, a small number can be found in the oral 
mucosa, nasal mucosa and orbital conjunctiva. RCEP occurring in the skin, initially expressed as a bright red spot on the body surface, diameter ≤ 2 mm, with the increase 
of medication times, the lesion range can be gradually increased, mostly nodular, also patchy, the color is bright red or dark red, need to observe the clinical symptoms and signs. It can be treated according to the following grading standards and treatment recommendations:  
Grade  Clinical Manifestation  Treatment Suggestions  
Grade 1  Single or multiple, nodule  with 
longest diameter ≤10 mm, 
with or without rupture 
bleeding  Continue administration, enhance 
local treatment for those with rupture 
and bleeding to prevent infection  
Grade 2  Single or multiple, nodule  with 
longest diameter >10mm,  
with or without  rupture 
bleeding  Continue the study treatment.  
Conduct local therapy such as laser or 
surgical resection if needed.  
Strengthen local treatment and prevent 
infection for subject s with rupture 
bleeding.  
Grade 3  Widespread  nodules,  
complicated by skin infections , 
maybe need hospitalization   Interrupt  the study treatment until 
resolution of the AE to Grade 1.  
Conduct local therapy such as laser or 
surgical resection if needed.  
Conduct anti -infection treatment for 
subject s with concurrent infection.  
Grade 4 ‡ Mult iple and widespread 
nodule , life threat ening Discontinue the study treatment  
Grade 5 ‡ Death  Discontinue the study treatment  
† Grading  is base d on <Management of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor -Related Toxicity -Guidelines 
of Chines e Society of Cl inical Oncology  (CSCO) 2019> . 
‡Grade 4 life threatening and Grade 5 death have  not occur ed in the study.   
Avoid scratch or friction when adverse reaction occurs. Protect easily rubbing parts by 
gauze to avoid bleeding and contact the doctor in charge for appropriate treatment suggestions. Hemostasis by local compression or local treatment such as laser or surgical excision can be used in subject s with ruptured hemorrhage. Anti -infective 
treatment should be given to those complicated with infection. RCEP may occur in tissues other than skin (including visceral organs). Related m edical examinations such 
as fecal occult blood, endoscopy and radiological should be performed if necessary.

Study  Description  This project investigated whether a VR breathing intervention would 
reduce depression and anxiety  symptoms  in postpartum  women  with a 
history of depression and anxiety.  
Study  Population:  Six postpartum  women  with a history  of anxiety  or depression.  All 
women were proficient in English reading and speaking.  
Planned Sample Size:  10 women were  anticipated to participate;  6 completed the study 
protocol

2 Background and Rationale 
2.1 Background  
 
Cognitive behavioral therapy is a basic element of treatment for postpartum anxiety (ANX) 
and depression (DEP)1. Exacerbations of existing DEP and ANX are rising in concert with 
the COVID -19 pandemic2, with limited  supply  of mental  health  professionals  that are trained 
to help these patients. Virtual Reality (VR) offers a potential solution to these care gaps,  
and VR has demonstrated success in treatment of pain, chronic disease, and other mental health conditions
3-4. However, VR effectiveness for treatment of postpartum ANX or DEP 
has not been investigated. The purpose of this pilot trial is to test patient feasibility and 
acceptability of virtual reality biofeedback program in pregnant and postpartum women for 
ANX and DEP outcomes.  
 
2.2 Rationale 
This study  will assess the feasibility  and acceptability  of a headset -based  virtual  reality  protocol 
to reduce anxiety and depression within women who have a history of anxiety or depression.  
v.2.0 9/5/2023   3 Hypotheses,  Objectives and Endpoints 
3.1 Hypotheses  
3.1.1  Primary  Hypothesis 
We hypothesized that the headset- based virtual reality system would be feasible as a 
management  tool for the treatment of anxiety  and depression and that women would  find this 
method of treatment acceptable to use.  
3.1.2  Primary  Aim:  
To determine  the feasibility  and acceptability  of the use of a virtual  reality  breathing 
simulation for the treatment of anxiety and depression 
3.1.3  Secondary Aim:  
To identify  changes  in depression and anxiety  from baseline to post treatment.  
 
4 Research Design: Prospective Observational 
Overview  of Visits/Encounters  with Participants:  
This is an open  label,  prospective pilot clinical trial. The individual  patient’s  active participation 
is approximately two hours.  
5 Human Subjects 
5.1 Subject  Population  
Six postpartum  women with a history  of anxiety  or depression participated in a single  VR 
biofeedback session.  
5.2 Inclusion Criteria  
• Recently  postpartum  (delivery  within  3 months)  women 
• Diagnosed history  of anxiety  or depression 
 
5.3 Exclusion  Criteria  
• Unable to participate in study  procedures.  
• English  illiterate  
 
5.4 Recruitment  Methods  
In conjunction with clinical teams in the outpatient clinics, Dr. Lim and the study team will 
identify patients eligible for the study, introduce the research to them, and obtain permission 
for the study  team  to approach them  about potential participation. Dr. Lim  has direct access  to 
potential participants as a clinical at UPMC Magee Women's Hospital; as a consultant 
anesthesiologist Dr. Lim also has direct access to the same patients as a clinical caregiver and service administrative leader as the chief of obstetric anesthesia. Dr. Lim and the study 
team  will work  directly  with clinical directors  from each community  practice to both identify  and 
introduce the study to potential participants. 
In addition to that, University of Pittsburgh Pitt+Me Registry will be used as a recruiting tool. 
Once a  participant has contacted  Pitt+Me  with an interest in  the study, a Pitt+Me  recruitment 
staff will call them for a brief pre -screen. If they pass the pre -screen and agree to be further 
contacted for additional screening,  a study  coordinator  will directly  reach  out to the interested 
individual for a phone screening.  
v.2.0 9/5/2023   6 Research Activities  
 
Summary  of E xperimental  Procedures:  
 
Utilizing  head mounted display  (HMD),  smartphone with software rendering stereoscopic  images 
to the user and heart rate/respiratory rate sensors connected and displayed. There is a 30 - 
minute VR session involved breathing exercises: users saw objects in a virtual world which 
changed movements with their breathing. Measuring pre and post session anxiety and 
depression symptoms were measured by Edinburgh postnatal depression scales (EPDS) and 
State -trait anxiety inventory. Acceptability was assessed by questions, “Would you participate in 
another session?” and “would you participate in regular repeating sessions?”.  
 
6.1 Screening  Procedures  
The screening procedures  pertain to specifically  women with a history  of anxiety  and depression. 
Medical record review will be completed to identify eligible participants for this study. Medical 
record review is a minimal risk activity that presents no additional risk beyond standard of care 
procedures. Any information obtained from these medical record reviews on subjects deemed ineligible will be immediately destroyed.  
 
In conjunction with Dr. Lim, for patients recruited during the postpartum period, the study team will identify patients eligible for the study, introduce the research to them, and obtain permission 
for the study team to approach them about potential participation. As stated above, as a consultant anesthesiologist Dr. Lim also has direct access to the same patients as a clinical caregiver and service administrative leader as the chief of obstetric anesthesia. Patients will be identified through  existing  recruitment  channels  from the community  OBGYN  clinics and  through 
prospective review of the OR C -section schedule.  
 
The clinical team  will notify  the patients  of their eligibility  for the study;  potential  participants  who 
express interest in learning more about the study  will be referred to the study coordinator team. 
The study  team  will approach and enroll  them  into this research.  The patient will be approached 
by the study team to fully explain the study, answer any questions the patient might have, and 
obtain informed consent postpartum. 
 
6.2 Research Procedures  
 
Baseline Assessment:  
Once informed consent is obtained subjects will complete baseline measurements which 
include a demographics form, State -Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Edinburgh Postnatal 
Depression Scale  (EPDS).  An intrapartum  form will also be completed via medical chart  review.  
 
VR Assessment:  
The VR intervention consists of three key hardware components required for use. 1) a plastic Virtual Reality Headset (also known as HMD: Head Mounted Display), which covers a user’s 
eyes  and is secured to their head using elastic  straps  which  can be tightened with Velcro. The 
HMD houses a 2) smartphone which runs the Flowly software and renders stereoscopic images which are presented to the user through the HMD. The phone connects to 3) a 
Bluetooth heart rate monitor which gathers heart rate data and clips simultaneously to the user’s ear lobe using a spring- loaded clip and to their clothing. 
v.2.0 9/5/2023   The subject  will download an app to their smartphone that will transmit  data to Amazon Web 
Services managed by Tamade, LLC. Subjects will be lent an iPhone if they do not have an 
iPhone or version that can support the VR sessions. In the case that subjects do have an 
iPhone 6s/6s+ or higher (iPhone 6/6+ not eligible), they will be asked to use it for the 
completion of the study.  
 
Subjects will be given the mobile system VR Shinecon head mounted display (HMD) and 
Bluetooth sensors to provide patients Virtual Reality biofeedback sessions targeted for 
depression/anxiety. While the participant is using the VR intervention, the following outcome 
measure  will be gathered:  pain level,  heart  rate, and respiration will be taken via the device and 
smartphone app and stored in a database hosted by Amazon Web Services and managed by 
Tamade, LLC.  
 
Subjects will then complete in a 1- hour VR session. In terms of the experience of the VANISH 
intervention, most exercises focus on breathing. Users will see objects in a 3D virtual world 
which change movements with their breathing and the user will be guided to use these in manners  that manage body  responses.  Breathing resonance variation  will be collected from the 
subjects during these exercises using the VR device. Training on how to complete these breathing exercises will be initiated as a part of the device- training.  
 
Follow -up Assessment:  
To conclude,  a post-assessment STAI  and EPDS will be repeated,  as well as post-assessment 
feasibility questionnaire.  
The subjects  will participate in a total of 2-hours  to complete  all questionnaires  and the VR 
session.  
 
7 Potential  Risks and Benefits  
7.1 Reasonably Foreseeable Risks Related  to Research 
Risk associated with collecting and storing PHI. Both common  and infrequent  risks include a 
loss of confidentiality.  
Risk associated with use of virtual reality devices. No common risks are noted.  Infrequent 
risks include the potential  for patient  to feel frustration, anxiety,  or uncomfortable due to the 
device visualizations.  
 
7.2 Potential  Benefits  
There is no direct  benefit.  
8 Protection Against  Risks 
8.1 Management  of research related risks 
Risks  are associated with screening procedures  and risks associated with Breach  of 
Confidentiality in the collection and storage of PHI : 
There is a risk of "breach  of confidentiality"  of the screening procedures. To protect  against  this 
risk, all screening procedures will be done by study staff who have been completely trained in 
HIPPA/privacy procedures; all information will be kept in a locked and secure location; all data 
associated with the study screening will be stored against a random study ID number; any linkages between study ID number and patient identification will be separated, password  
v.2.0 9/5/2023   protected and stored behind UPMC firewall.  To protect against the possibility of breach of 
confidentiality, all data collected will be identifiable only by a unique subject ID number, and no 
personal  identifiers will be stored with  data. Linkage files identifying subjects will be stored  only 
in physical records that are kept in locked files accessible only by study staff; electronic data will be handled and protected as described above.  Only consent forms will have identifiable 
information, and those will be kept in their chart separate from any data. Data will be labeled 
only with participant  ID number.  We will also conduct  research  interviews in  a private  room.  We 
will collect only sensitive information limited to the minimum necessary to achieve the aims of our research. No sensitivity information will be shared via text -messages or emails.  
9 Adverse  Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The pr
oposed observational  study  will use the FDA definition of SAE.  A serious  adverse event 
is any untoward event that is thought by either the investigator to be unexpected and at least  
possibly related  to the study and results in any of the following:  
1. Death  
2. A life-threatening adverse event  
3. Inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of an existing  hospitalization  
4. A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption of the ability  to conduct 
normal life functions.  
5. A congenital  anomaly  or birth defect  
6. Important  medical  events  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient, or subject, and may require medical, or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the serious outcomes listed above.  
 
9.1 Severity 
The severity  of adverse changes  in physical  signs  or symptoms  will be classified  as follows:  
• G
rade  1 (Mild) : asymptomatic  or mild symptoms;  clinical or diagnostic  observation  only; 
intervention not indicated.  
• Grade 2 (Moderate) : minimal,  local or noninvasive intervention indicated.  
• Grade 3 (Severe) : medically  significant  but not immediately  life-threatening;  hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care/ADL.  
• Grade 4 (Life-threatening) : consequences;  urgent  intervention indicated.  
• Grade  5 (Death) : event  is a direct  cause  of death.  
 
9.2 Relatedness  
• De finitely Related  – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other 
possible contributing factors  can be ruled out. The event  cannot  be explained by concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
• Probably  R elated  – There is evidence to suggest  a causal  relationship,  and the influence  of 
other factors is unlikely. The event occurs within a reasonable time after administration of 
the study protocol, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
• Possibly  R
 elated  – There  is some  evidence to suggest  a causal  relationship (e.g.,  the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of study protocol). However, other 
factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other 
concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after 
discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to 
“probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate.  
v.2.0 9/5/2023   • Unlikely to be related – An event whose temporal relationship to study protocol 
administration makes  a causal  relationship improbable (e.g.,  the event  did not occur  within  a 
reasonable time after administration of the study protocol) and in which drugs, chemicals or 
underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, 
other concomitant treatments).  
• Not Related – The  AE is completely independent of study protocol administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event  is related to another  etiology.  There must  be an alternative, 
definitive etiology documented by the clinician.  
 
9
.3 Expectedness  
The Principal Investigator will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or 
unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature,  severity, or frequency  of the 
event is not consistent with the risk information previously described.  
9.4 Reporting  Serious  Adverse Events 
Any SAE, which is determined by the PI to be unexpected and at least possibly related to 
study,  will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible.  The PI report  to the IRB will include all 
known details regarding the nature of the SAE.  
 
Life-threatening  or fatal unexpected  adverse events  associated with the study  procedures  must 
be reported to the IRB within 24 hours of discovery of the incident with subsequent follow -up 
submission of a detailed written report in accordance with the respective policies and 
procedures of the IRB. Outcomes of SAEs will be regularly reported to the IRB. A summary of the SAEs that occurred during the previous year will be included in the annual progress report 
as well as in the annual IRB renewal.  
 
9.4.1  Adverse  Events Reporting Timeline  
Life-threatening or fatal unexpected adverse events associated with the study must be 
reported to the IRB within 24 hours of discovery of the incident with subsequent follow -up 
submission of a detailed written report. The IRB will be notified by telephone or facsimile 
transmission of a human adverse event  that is fatal or life-threatening no later than 7 calendar 
days after receiving the respective human adverse event information, followed by the subsequent submission of a written Safety Report. Serious and unexpected adverse events 
associated with the study protocol will be reported to the IRB with subsequent follow -up 
submission of a detailed written report in accordance with the respective policies and 
procedures of the IRB.  
9.4.2  Ensuring necessary medical/professional  intervention for adverse events.  
If there is a suggestion that any research procedures have resulted in an injury to subjects, there  will be immediate  contact with  the Principal Investigator who is  listed  on the  first page of 
the informed  consent documents.  Emergency  medical  treatment  for injuries  solely and  directly 
related to participation in this research study will be provided by the hospitals of UPMC. 
Insurance provider may be billed for the costs of this emergency treatment, but none of those 
costs will be charged directly to patients/subjects. If research- related injury requires medical 
care beyond this emergency  treatment,  subjects  will be responsible for the costs of this follow- 
up care. Currently, there is no plan  for any additional financial compensation for these events.  
v.2.0 9/5/2023   10 Withdrawal  of Subjects  and Stopping Rules  
10.1 Adverse  Events  Requiring Discontinuation  
For this study,  a serious  adverse  event  is any untoward clinical event  that is thought  by either 
the investigator or the sponsor to be related to the study and results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
 
1. Death  
2. A life-threatening adverse event  
3. Inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of an existing  hospitalization  
4. A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption of the ability  to conduct 
normal life functions.  
5. A congenital  anomaly  or birth defect  
6. Important  medical  events  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient, or subject, and may require medical, or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the serious outcomes listed above.  
 
If clinically  important  and unexpected adverse experiences  or clinically  important  study -related 
adverse experiences occur, they will be recorded on the adverse event case report form.  
 
10.2 Other  Criteria  Requiring Discontinuation  
Withdrawal  of Subjects  for reasons  other  than Non-compliance or Adverse Events:  
• Protocol  non-adherence:  non-adherence  at follow- up visits  at the judgement  of the PI 
• Incomplete survey data,  defined as missing  20% or more  responses  
11 Statistical Analysis  
11.1 General  Approach 
Baseline demographic characteristics will be collected and analyzed using descriptive 
statistics.  
Feasibility  of the study  is measured  as the number  of patients  who report  that the study  was 
both 1.) easy to use and 2.) The session was worth my time.  
Acceptability was measured as “yes” responses to both questions, “would you participate in another  session in the future? 2. Based on your experience today,  would  you participate 
in regular repeating sessions (e.g., daily, or weekly)?” 
Anxiety and depression are measured as continuous variables at baseline and after VR i
ntervention. Due to the small  sample  size, only the number (proportion)  of patients whose 
overall anxiety and depression scores changed/decreased from baseline to post - 
intervention will be reported.  
 
11.2 Sample  Size Determination 
This is a sample  of convenience as a pilot trial. We believe five complete subjects'  answers 
will give us adequate information about feasibility and some estimations on measured outcomes to perform a sample size calculation for the fully powered trial.  
11.3 Analysis of Primary  Endpoint  
To explore  the feasibility  of use of Virtual  Reality  as a method to aid in the reduction of 
anxiety and depression in postpartum women. 
v.2.0 9/5/2023   11.4 Analysis of Secondary  Endpoint  
To further  explore change in anxiety  and depression across  the trials.  
12 Data  and Safety  Monitoring 
Dr. Lim will be responsible for data and safety monitoring. She will meet bi -weekly with study 
personnel to review the progress of the research study, including subject recruitment and 
retention and an assessment of the timeliness and quality of the data. Dr. Lim will review all 
data, procedures, and any adverse events that occurred. All adverse events, including breach of confidentiality,  will be reported to the IRB at minimum  at the time of renewal  per their policies 
and procedures.  
13 Regulatory,  Ethical,  and Study Oversight  
13.1 IRB Approval  
The PI obtained IRB approval  STUDY21040063, from the University  of Pittsburgh IRB, for  the 
approval of the clinical protocol and  corresponding informed  consent form(s); modifications  to 
the clinical protocol and corresponding informed consent forms, and advertisements (i.e., 
directed at potential research subjects) for study recruitment.  
 
The only circumstance in which a deviation from the current IRB -approved clinical 
protocol/consent form(s) may be initiated in the absence of prospective IRB approval is to eliminate  an apparent  immediate  hazard to the research subject(s).  In such  circumstances, the 
Investigator will promptly notify the University of Pittsburgh IRB of the deviation.  
 
The IRB will review and approve the Informed Consent Document for the study and provide 
institutional oversight of data and safety issues. The study protocol will be approved prior to 
recruiting  or obtaining consent  from any participants.  Moreover,  the study  will be reviewed at a 
minimum of annual basis (or more frequently as deemed necessary) by the IRB committee. 
Each  participant  will sign the approved Informed Consent  Form  prior to participating in the 
study.  
 
The University  of Pittsburgh IRB operates  in compliance with FDA regulations  at 21 CFR Parts  
50 and 21 CFR 56, and in conformance with applicable ICH Guidelines on GCP. 
 
13.2 Informed Consent  Procedures  
Details  of Participant  Recruitment:  
 
Medical record review will be completed to identify eligible participants for this study. Medical record review  is a minimal risk activity  that presents  no additional risk beyond standard of care 
procedures. Any information obtained from these  medical record reviews on subjects deemed 
ineligible will be immediately destroyed.  
In conjunction with Dr. Lim, for patients recruited during the postpartum period, the study team 
will identify patients eligible for the study, introduce the research to them,  and obtain permission 
for the study team to approach them about potential participation. As stated above, as a consultant anesthesiologist Dr. Lim also has direct access to the same patients as a clinical 
caregiver and service administrative leader as the chief of obstetric anesthesia. Patients will be identified through  existing  recruitment  channels  from the community  OBGYN  clinics and  through 
prospective review of the OR schedule.  
 
The clinical team  will notify  the patients  of their eligibility  for the study;  potential  participants  who 
v.2.0 9/5/2023   express interest in learning more about the study  will be referred to the study coordinator team. 
The study  team  will approach and enroll  them  into this research.  The patient  will be approached 
by the study team to fully explain the study, answer any questions the patient might have, and 
obtain informed consent postpartum.  
 
In addition to that, University of Pittsburgh Pitt+Me Registry will be used as a recruiting tool. Once a  participant has contacted  Pitt+Me  with an interest in  the study, a Pitt+Me  recruitment 
staff will call them for a brief pre -screen. If they pass the pre -screen and agree to be further 
contacted for additional screening,  a study  coordinator  will directly  reach  out to the interested 
individual for a phone screening.  
Individuals will be provided with full explanation of study -related goals and procedures. 
Questions  will be answered for the patient  as well as their support  people.  Patients  will be given 
as much time as they desire to read the consent form and materials and ask questions. If desired, patients can take materials home for review and will be consented to participate via 
videoconferencing software and electronic consent via REDCap.  
 
13.3 Protocol  Deviations 
Clinical research investigators and staff will be familiarized with the study protocol, GCPs, and 
applicable federal  regulations  to ensure that the study  protocol  procedures  are followed.  When  a 
deviation is perceived to have occurred, the procedure completed will be verified against the 
study protocol, applicable regulations and relevant GCP principles. Deviations in the study 
protocol will be identified verbally and  in writing  to the PI and/or study  coordinator as  they occur. 
In addition  to deviations  noticed during  completion of study protocol procedures, deviations  may 
be identified through routine monitoring visits or audits of the clinical research records, as the 
research team will meet weekly to review the study recruitment, procedures, and retention. All 
deviations will be verified and presented to the PI for timely assessment and IRB reporting, if warranted. Any deviation, regardless of severity, will be recorded in the Non- compliance/deviation log by the PI or research staff member as they occur. Protocol deviations 
that do not meet  the definition of IRB reporting requirements will be subject to yearly review and 
evaluation during the continuing review period.  
Reportable incidence  of Non-compliance includes  any protocol  deviation that: 
 
• Significantly  adversely  affects  the safety, rights,  or welfare  of the research 
participants, OR  
• Significantly  compromises  the quality  or integrity  of the research  data (i.e., negatively 
impacts the ability to draw conclusions from the study data), OR  
• Represents  Continuing Non-compliance (i.e., has been previously  reported  or 
represents a pattern of ongoing non- compliance).  
 
Incidents of Non- compliance that do not meet the IRB reporting requirements will be 
documented  in a Non-compliance/deviation  log and managed as part of  the Data  and Safety 
Monitoring  Plan.  The Non-compliance/deviation log will be kept throughout  the study  and the 
documentation will be made available upon request.

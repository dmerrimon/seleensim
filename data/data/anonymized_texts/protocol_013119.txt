7 This study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 2 9-day treatment period  (28 days of 
dosing) , and a 14 -day follow up period. After providing informed consent,  participants will undergo 
screening assessments as outlined in Table 2  to determine eligibility.  
Screening Period: The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF). 
Following completion of screening, on Day 1, eligible participants will visit the study center and will 
be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (SAGE -324 30 mg  daily , SAGE -324 60 mg daily , or 
placebo) in a 1:1:1  ratio. Randomization will be stratified based on the use of propranolol for the 
treatment of ET (Y/N). Participants who are on a propranolol regimen must have been on a stable 
dose for at least 1 month prior to Day 1 and will continue to be on a stable dose during the Treatment 
Period. Participants will complete baseline assessments of safety and efficacy, including the clinician -
rated TETRAS and quantitative Kinesia ONE assessments  of tremor, as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table 2 ). 
Double -Blind Treatment Period:  Starting on Day 1, participants will receive a single d ose of 
investigational product (IP) once daily for  28 days on an outpatient basis. Doses occurring on 
scheduled clinic visits will be administered in the clinic, and doses occurring on all other days may be 
self-administered by the participant at home duri ng the 2 9-day Treatment Period  (28 days of dosing) . 
During the Treatment Period, participants will return to the study center approximately once per week 
for efficacy and safety assessments as specified in  Table 2 . Participants will be trained on the use of 
software applications and devices necessary to complete questionnaires or other assessments as 
required.  
Follow Up Period:  Follow up visits will be conducted on an outpatient basis. Participants will 
continue to complete  questionnaires as indicated in  Table 2  and will receive  a phone call 
approximately 7 days after the last dose of IP (ie, Day 3 6) for safety monitoring. Participants will 
return to the study center for an end of study visit approximately 14 days following the last dose of IP 
(ie, Day 4 2). 
Participants who disco ntinue IP during the Treatment Period will be asked to return to the clinic as 
soon as possible for an end of treatment (EOT) visit. Follow -up visits should take place as scheduled , 
or relative to the last dose of IP if discontinuing treatment early . If at  any time after the EOT visit, a 
participant  decides to withdraw from the study, the participant  should return for an early termination 
visit (ETV) . The EOT and  ETV  can be on the same day if a participant  discontinues IP and withdraws 
from the study on the same day during a clinic visit; in this case, all events scheduled for the EOT 
visit will be conducted . 
During the study, a phone call will be conducted  once  per week (preferably mid -week) in between  
clinic visits , to review current status  of participant . 
Number of Participants  (planned):  Up to 120 participants, with up to 40 participants per arm.

administer ed once  daily , in the morning  with food . The following dose levels of SAGE -324 will be 
evaluated:  
• 30 mg daily in the morning  
• 60 mg daily in the morning  
Duration of Treatment:  
Each participant will receive a single dose of SAGE -324 oral tablet or matching placebo administered 
once  daily for 28 days.   
Statistical Methods:   
A separate statistical analysis plan ( SAP) will provide a detailed description of the data analyses to be 
performed in the study . The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock .  
General Considerations  
For the purpose of all efficacy and safety analyses where applicable, baseline is  defined as the last 
measurement prior to the start of IP administration.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each t ime 
point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will include 
counts and percentages.  
Analysis Sets  
The Randomized Set is defined as all participants who are randomized.  
The Safety Set will include all participants who were administered IP.  
The Full Analysis Set will include  all randomized participants who received any amount of IP and 
have a baseline and at least one postbaseline clinic -based Kinesia  ONE  accelerometer score.  
 
 
The Per Protocol Set will include all participants in the F ull Analysis Set  without any major protocol 
deviations that could affect efficacy. The review of major protocol deviation s will be completed, and 
the decision on whether the deviation affects efficacy will be documented before database unblinding.  
Determination of Sample Size  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201 CONFIDENTIAL  
11 The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 3 points difference in the mean change 
from baseline Kinesia ONE accelerometer  scores  between SAGE -324 and placebo with a standard 
deviation of 3 .5 point s and a 1:1:1 randomization schedule. Under these assumptions, a sample size of 
30 evaluable subjects per group would provide 90% power  assuming a  2-sided test at α level of 0.05. 
By including  3 treatment groups and using a 1:1 :1 randomization ratio, a total of 90 evaluable 
subjects are required. Assuming a nonevaluability rate of  25%, at least 1 20 subjects will be 
randomized.    
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The estimand for the primary efficacy analysis is the treatment difference between either dose of 
SAGE -324 and placebo in mean change from baseline in clinic -based Kinesia ONE accelerometer 
scores at Day 2 9 based on F ull Analysis Set . This will be analyzed  using a mixed effects model for 
repeated measures (MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline Kinesia  ONE accelerometer 
score, stratification factor, assessment timepoint, and timepoint -by-treatment as explanatory variables. 
All explanatory variabl es will be treated as fixed effects. All postbaseline clinic visits will be included 
in the model. The main comparison will be between SAGE -324 and placebo at the 2 9-day timepoint. 
Model -based point estimates (ie, least squares means, 95% confidence interv als, and p -values) will be 
reported where applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -
subject errors. If there is a convergence issue with the unstructured covariance model, Toeplitz 
compound symmetry or Autoregressive  (1) [AR(1)] covariance structure will be used, following this 
sequence until convergence is achieved. If the model still does not converge with AR(1) structure, no 
results will be reported. When the covariance structure is not unstructured , the sandwich e stimator for 
the variance covariance matrix will be derived, using the EMPIRICAL option in the PROC MIXED 
statement in SAS.  
Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used to 
analy ze of the change from baseline in TETRAS total performance score s, TETRAS Performance 
subscale part 4 upper limb tremor  score s and TETRAS ADL score s.  
Safety Analysis  
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by incidence of TEAEs /serious adverse events,

approximately  5 hours (±30 min) . Postdose  vital signs to includ e orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate , measured after the participant has been in the supine 
position for at least 5 minutes and then repeated 1 minute and 3 minutes after standing.  
e ECGs will be collected and read centrally. ECGs will be performed approximately  5 hours  (±30 min)  postdose. All ECGs must be performed after the 
participant has been in a supine position for at least 5 minutes.  
 
  
g Kinesia ONE will be assessed simultaneous to TETRAS Performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor . On clinic dosing days, pa rticipants will perform 
Kinesia ONE assessments approximately 30 to 60 minutes prior to dosing  in the morning . In addition, on Day 15 , Kinesia ONE assessments will be performed 
at 5 and 8 hours ( ±30 min) postdose.

22 4. INTRODUCTION  
SAGE -324 is a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of A-type γ -aminobutyric acid -gated 
chloride channel (GABA A) receptors, the major class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in 
the brain.  In addition to being developed as an adjunctive therapy in epilepsy and other seizure 
disorders  under IND 139201, SA GE-324 is also being developed for the treatment of Essential 
Tremor (ET).  
Essential tremor is a permanently debilitating, neurologically determined, common movement 
disorder characterized by involuntary rhythmic oscillation of a body part due to intermitt ent 
muscle contractions typically occurring when not at rest, thus interfering with fine motor skills 
associated with daily activities ( Olanow 2008 , Deuschl 2011 , Hopfner 201 6, NIH 2019 ). 
Although the pathophysiology and etiology of ET is not fully understood, it is postulated that 
approximately 50% of ET patients feature an autosomal dominant pattern of familial inheritance 
and that non -inherited cases may have toxin -based or other causali ty (Olanow 2008 , Hopfner 
2016). ET is the most common movement disorder in the US, with prevalence estimated to be 
approximately 2.2% of the population, representing a substantial societal medical burden with 
over an estimated 7 million ET patients in the US alone ( Louis 2014 ).  
In general, active tasks of daily life are adversely impacted by ET, including but not limited to 
speech, handwriting, household tasks, and occupational demands, contributing negatively to 
psychosocial well -being, general anxiety, a nd overall quality of life  (Koller, 1989 ). Although 
benign in term of its effect on life expectancy, ET is a progressive neurodegenerative condition 
whose symptoms are typically disabling, often forcing patients to change jobs or seek early 
retirement ( Zappia, 2013 ). In some cases, serious disability may ensue.   
The pharmacological profile  of SAGE -324 is theorized to  induce therapeutic effect  in the 
treatment of ET. Based on preclinical studies of  SAGE -324, which features a different 
mechanism of action tha n that of propranolol, the pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamic (PD) 
profile suggests SAGE -324 may safely ameliorate symptoms in patients suffering from ET, 
regardless of propranolol use . 
There are currently ongoing Phase 1 clinical studies of SAGE -324 in  healthy adults  and in adults 
with ET . These studies , in addition to preclinical studies of SAGE -324, are detailed in the 
investigator’s brochure.  
With a GABA A receptor -based mechanism of action  featuring  positive allosteric modulation  
capability , SAGE -324 represents a novel approach to treatment of ET with possible utility  as 
monotherapy or adjunctive  to propranolol, which may help address the unmet medical need of 
the ET population , warranting further st udy of SAGE -324 as a potential treatment for this 
common movement disorder.  
Henceforth, this double -blind, placebo -controlled efficacy and safety study of SAGE -324 will be 
conducted in adults  with and without concomitant use of propranolol and  is designed to assess 
the effect of SAGE -324 on a variety of outcome measures specific to ET disease characteristics  
and associate d quality of life  domains .

23 4.1. Dose Justification  
Doses of SAGE -324 planned for  this study  are 30 mg and 60 mg given as oral tablets, to be  
administered once daily in the morning with food. Th e doses  were selected based on preliminary 
data from 3 active studies of SAGE -324, which included : unblinded data from completed cohorts 
in 324 -CLP-101 Pa rt A (oral solution SAGE -324 doses of 3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg, 60 mg) ; 
Part C (oral solution SAGE -324 doses of 30 mg) ; Part D (oral suspension SAGE -324 doses of 
30 mg) in healthy subjects ; and  preliminary data from open -label Part E (oral suspension SAGE -
324 doses of 45 mg and 60 mg) in participants with ET; additional preliminary data from 324 -
CLP-102 cohorts 1 through 6  (cohorts 1 to 5 unblinded, cohort 6 blinded) , which evaluated oral 
suspension doses ranging from 5 mg to 60 mg; and preliminary unblind ed data from 324 -CLP-
104, which compared the relative bioavailability of the oral tablet (30 mg) vs oral suspension (30 
mg) formulations of SAGE -324 and separately the effect of food on the PK of the SAGE -324 
oral tablet.  In 324 -CLP-101 and 324 -CLP-102 st udies, doses were administered in a fasted state. 
The preliminary data from all of these active studies collectively informed the route of 
administration (oral) and dose strengths of 30 mg and 60 mg as oral tablets planned for further 
evaluation in  this study .  
SAGE -324 was generally well -tolerated in participants with ET and in healthy volunteers, as was 
shown in the preliminary data of 324 -CLP-101 Part E at single administration doses of 45 mg 
and 60 mg, and in 324 -CLP-102 through once -daily admin istered doses of up to 60 mg  for 
14 days. In addition, tremor reduction was observed at both doses on TETRAS and Kinesia 
accelerometry, with greater improvement seen at 60  mg compared to 45  mg.  
In the clinically complete  study 324-CLP-104, preliminary dat a showed that SAGE -324 oral 
tablets, when coadministered with a meal, resulted in exposures approximately equivalent to that 
of SAGE -324 oral suspension under fasted conditions. Therefore, the SAGE -324 oral tablets are 
recommended to be administered with f ood. 
4.2. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Based on the mechanism of action of SAGE -324 and the results of completed nonclinical studies 
and preliminary data of currently ongoing clinical studies of SAGE -324, it is theorized that 
participants  may have  symptomatic ameliorat ion, ie, tremor reduction and possibly improved 
quality of life  from potentially stabilizing disease characteristics associated with ET. 
Potential risks anticipated in this study are based on available data from toxicology studies of 
SAGE -324 in a ddition to preliminary data from 3 ongoing, currently active Phase 1 clinical 
studies of SAGE -324.   
As of 18 October 2019, based on the preliminary clinical data available, there have been no 
deaths, SAEs  related to IP , or confirmed  clinically significant  trends in clinical laboratory 
evaluations, vital signs, or physical examinations. Available preliminary clinical data is 
summarized in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
Based on available preliminary clinical data  from SAGE -324 active clinical studies , AEs of 
somnolence and feeling of relaxation are considered adverse drug reactions.  In addition to 
scheduled clinic visits, the current status of study participants will be reviewed via weekly phone 
calls, in between clinic visits.

26 6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group dose -ranging study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SAGE -324 as monotherapy and adjunctive 
therapy with propranolol in individuals with ET. Participants, site staff , and sponsor personnel 
will be masked to treatment allocation  (see Section  8.5). 
This study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 2 9-day treat ment period consisting of 
28 days of dosing with the end of treatment visit  intended to be on Day 29 at trough , and a 
14-day follow -up period  relative to final dose  (Figure 1). After providing informed consent, 
participants will undergo screening assessments as outlined in Table 2  to determine eligibility .  
The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF). Following 
completion of screening , on Day 1, eligible participants will visit the st udy center and will be 
randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (SAGE -324 30 mg , SAGE -324 60 mg , or placebo) in a 
1:1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified based on the use of propranolol for the treatment of 
ET (Y/N). Participants who are on a propranolo l regimen must have been on a stable regimen for 
at least 1 month prior to Day 1 and will continue to be on that stable regimen during the 
Treatment Period. Participants will complete baseline assessments of safety and efficacy, 
including the clinician -rated TETRAS and quantitative Kinesia ONE assessments of tremor, as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ). 
During the double -blind Treatment Period, s tarting on Day 1, participants will receive a single 
dose of investigational product (IP) once daily for 28 days on an outpatient basis. Doses 
occurring on scheduled clinic visits will be administered in the clini c, and doses occurring on all 
other days will be self -administered by the participant at home  as specified in Table 2 . During 
the Treatment Period, partic ipants will return to the study center approximately once per week 
for efficacy and safety assessments as specified in  Table 2 . In addition, a phone call  will be 
conducted once per week (preferably mid -week) in  between clinic visits, to review current status 
of the participant.  
In addition to Kinesia ONE -specific training, c linical study center staff and study p articipants 
will be trained on the use of software applications and devices necessary to complete 
questionnaires or  other assessments as required.  During in-clinic visits, c linical study center staff 
will be available to assist participants as needed , to ensure they can  access and us e the software  
applications and devices  correctly according to the training . 
During the fo llow-up period, visits will be conducted on an outpatient basis. In addition to the 
phone calls to review current status, p articipants will receive a phone call approximately 7 day s 
after the last dose of IP (ie, Day 35) for safety monitoring. Participants will return to the study 
center for an end of study visit approximately 14 days following the last dose of IP (ie, Day 42) . 
Participants who discontinue IP during the Treatment Period will be asked to return to the clinic 
as soon as possible for an end of treatment (EOT) visit. Follow -up visits should take place as 
scheduled, or relative to the last dose of IP if discontinuing treatment early. If at any time after 
the EO T visit, a participant decides to withdraw from the study, the participant should return for 
an early termination visit  (ETV) . The EOT and ETV  can be on the same day if a participant 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201 CONFIDENTIAL  
27 discontinues IP and withdraws from the study on the same day during a cli nic visit; in this case, 
all events scheduled for the EOT visit will be conducted.

Abbreviation:  EOT = end of treatment  
6.2. Number of Participant s 
Up to approximately 120 participants  are planned , with up to  40 participants enrolled per arm , to 
produce an estimated 30  participants per arm who will complete the study . Additional 
participants may be randomized if the drop -out rate is higher than anticipated ( ie, >25%).  
6.3. Treatment Assignment  
Participants will be assigned to 30 mg or 60  mg IP (active or placebo) in accordance with the 
randomization schedule on Day 1. Additional details on randomization and blinding  are provided 
in Section  8.5.  
6.4. Dose Adjustment  Criteria  
Doses will not be adjusted for this study except as clinically necessary , eg, interrupting dose due 
to an AE or serious adverse event ( SAE ) considered related to IP , or as recomm ended by the 
medical monitor in consultation with the investigator.  
6.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
Sage Therapeutics may terminate this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety 
reasons including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting unacceptable risk to 
participant s, or for administrative reasons . In the event of study termi nation, Sage Therapeutics 
will provide written notification to the investigator . Investigational sites must promptly notify 
their IRB/ ethics committee  (EC) , where required,  and initiate withdrawal procedures for 
participating participant s.

8.3. Intervention after the End of the Study  
There is n o planned  intervention following the end of the study.  
8.4. Treatment Adherence  
The first dose of IP will be received and administered by participants in the clinic . Participant s 
will be dispensed a  7-day supply of IP to orally self -administer  at home with instructions 
specifying to administer in the morning with food. Treatment adherence will be monitored by the 
site staff at each in-clinic visit  by direct questioning  and counting  returned tablets  and will be 
documented . Details on drug accountability are included in  Section  9.6. 
8.5. Randomization and Blinding  
This is a  randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study. Participants will be random ized in 
a stratified manner based on propranolol for the treatment of ET (Y/N); randomization will be 
done within each stratum in a 1:1:1 ratio  to treatment group s (SAGE -324 30 mg, 
SAGE -324 60 mg, or placebo) . Participants, site staff, and the sponsor will  be blinded to 
treatment allocation. Randomization schedules will be generated by an independent statistician . 
The randomization schedules will be kept strictly confidential, accessible only to authorized  
personnel until the time of unblinding. The blindi ng of the study  will be broken after the 
database has been locked.  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201 CONFIDENTIAL  
34 8.5.1.  Emergency Unblinding  
During the study, the blind is to be broken only when the safety of a participant  is at risk and the 
treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received. Unless a participant  is at immediate 
risk, the Investigator should  make diligent attempts to contact Sage prior to unblinding the study 
treatment administered to a participant . Request s from the investigator about the treatment 
administered to study participant s should  be discussed with the Sage  Medical Monitor . If the 
unblinding occurs without Sage’s knowledge, the investigator must notify Sage within 24 hours 
of breaking the blind. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly 
documented in the source records.  
In all cases where the IP allocation for a participant  is unblinded, pertinent information 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be document ed in the participant ’s records and on the 
eCRF. At the time of withdrawal  from the study /stopping participation , if possible, an EOT 
and/or ETV  should be conducted .  
If a participant or study personnel become unblinded to treatment, the participant will b e 
excluded from the Per Protocol analysis set, as detailed further in the statistical analysis plan.

medication ID number must be recorded.  
At the subsequent IP-dispensing visit, the investi gator or designee will access the IRT, providing 
the same participant  ID number assigned at Screening, to obtain the medication ID number for 
the IP to be dispensed at that visit. The medication ID number, and the number of tablets  
returned by the particip ant at this visit must be recorded.  
If dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered by site staff or sponsor’s designee, the 
sponsor must be notified immediately.  
The IP provided is for use only as directed in this protocol. The investigator or designee must 
keep a record of all IP received, used and returned/discarded.   
Sage Therapeutics  will be permitted access to the study  supplies at any time with appropriate 
notice during or after completion of the study to perform drug accountability reconciliation.   
The investigator, pharmacist, or qualified designee is responsible for drug accountability, 
reconciliation, and record mai ntenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
At the end of the study, any unused IP tablets will be returned to Sage Therapeutics for 
destruction or destroyed locally  per the site’s procedures ; disposition of IP will be documented .

ASSESSMENTS  
10.1. Efficacy Assessments  
10.1.1.  Kinesia ONE™ Accelerometer Score  
Kinesia ONE™ is an ISO -certified  wireless motion sensor worn distally on the index finger , 
which utilizes 3 orthogonal accelerometers and 3 orthogonal gyroscopes to monitor three -
dimensional motion. Data is transmitted wirelessly from the sensor to a Bluetooth  technology -
enabled device  to use with the  Kinesia ONE software  (eg, Apple iPad or similar device with 
preinstalled Kinesia ONE software) . The device has received FDA clearance . 
Via the Kinesia ONE software application,  measures of three -dimensional  motion  are converted 
to scores  ranging from 0 to 4 , per assessed maneuver ; higher scores indicate greater  tremor  
severity . Motion in both arms is captured.  
Participants will complete this assessment at each clinic visit as sp ecified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 2 ).  
10.1.2.  The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale  
TETRAS is a validated , comprehensive clinical assessment of essential tremor  (Elble 2013).  
Three different components of TETRAS will be assesse d in this study. The TETRAS ADL 
subscale, total performance score, and performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor  score , and 
will each be separately assessed  at each clinic visit as specified in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2 ). 
The ADL subscale assesses how ET is impacting typical activities of daily li ving (ie, speech, 
eating, drinking, dressing, personal hygiene, writing, occupational impairment, social impact, 
and activities affected by upper limb tremor). It consists of 12 items that are  each rated in from 
0 (normal activity)  to 4 (severe abnormality ). The overall ADL score range is 0 to 48.  
The total performance score is based on overall rating  of the performance  subscale , which 
measures tremor amplitude in the voice, limbs , head, face,  trunk, and also  measures functional 
task capabilities, ie, handwriting, spirography,  and holding a pen over a dot . Each of these items 
is rated on a scale from 0  (no tremor) to 4 (severe tremor). Collectively, the performance items  
generate an  overall performance score fr om 0 to 64 .  
For the performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor  score , all 3 maneuvers in the upper limb 
assessments  of part 4 (subscale items 4a, 4b, and 4c) will be completed for both arms, first for 
the left arm and then for the right . The part 4 sub scale ordinally rates postural  (limbs extended 
forward  maneuver, and wing -beating  [elbows flexed] maneuver) , and kinetic  (finger -nose-finger 
maneuver)  tremor on a 0 to 4  severity scale  in 0.5 -point increments.

42 10.3. Other Patient -Reported Assessment s 
10.3.1.  Patient Perception of Response Burden  
The Patient Perception of Response Burden Questionnaire is a patient -reported measure that 
assesses the multidimensional construct of response burden ( Atkinson 2019 ). 
Participants r espond to 6 items assessing 1) how well the questions related to their actual 
concerns, 2) how comfortable the participants were with answering the questions, 3) how well 
the survey characterized their health and well -being, 4) the length of time to comple te the 
questionnaires, 5) whether questions seemed unimportant or repetitive, and 6) what additional 
information should have been gathered. Items 1 to 3 are assessed on a 0 to 10 scale, item 4 is 
assessed on a 1 to 3 scale, and items 5 and 6 are open -ended . Items 1 and 4 are reverse scored. A 
composite score can be calculated to create a weighted representative index of relevance, 
comfort, and well -being relative to time to completion (ie, items 1, 2, and 3 were summed and 
multiplied by item 4) for a range of 0 to 72, with higher scores indicative of elevated endorsed 
response burden. The open -ended items will be summarized thematically. The Patient Perception 
of Response Burden Questionnaire will be performed as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 2 ).

11.1. Safety Parameters  
All assessments will be conducted according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 ). 
11.1.1.  Demograph y and Medical History  
Demographic characteristics (age, race, sex, ethnicity) and a full medical history will be 
documented . This  must  also additionally include  participant  recall of history of  ET, disease 
duration, past treatments  used, and responsiveness to  alcohol  and/or other treatments  with use 
intended  as off-label  treatment  of ET (eg, primidone  or similar t herapies ). 
11.1.2.  Weight and Height  
Height and weight wi ll be measured and documented . Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated 
and documented.   
11.1.3.  Physical Examination  
Whenever possible, the same individual should perform all physical examinations . Physical 
examinations will include assessment of body systems (eg, h ead, eye, ear, nose and throat; heart; 
lungs; abdomen; and extremities) as well as cognitive and neurological examination and MSE . 
Unscheduled physical examinations may also be conducted per the Investigator’s discretion.  
Any abnormality in physical examin ations will be interpreted by an investigator as abnormal, not 
clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) in source documents .  
11.1.4.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and blood pressure. Syst olic and 
diastolic blood pressure are to be measured after the participant  has been supine for at least 
5 minutes prior to the measurement. When assessed postdose,  orthostatic blood pressure and 
heart rate will also be measured after the participant  has be en in the supine position for at least 5 
minutes and then repeated approximately 1 and 3 minutes after standing .  
Any abnormality in vital signs will be interpreted by an Investigator as abnormal, NCS; or 
abnormal, CS in source documents . 
11.1.5.  Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed . The standard intervals (heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF ) 
as well as any rhythm abnormalities will be recorded.  
Electrocardiograms will be performed after the participant  has been resting in a supine posi tion 
for at least 5 minutes. When ECG measurement s coincide with safety assessments, vital signs 
assessment or blood draws, procedures should be carried out in said order  (vital  signs , ECG, 
blood draw) . 
All abnormal ECGs will be interpreted by an investiga tor as abnormal , NCS, or abnormal , CS in 
source documents .

46 11.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  Definition  
An SAE  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose : 
• Results in death  
• Places the participant  at immediate risk of death (a life -threatening event); however, 
this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death   
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a  congenital abnormality or birth defect  
An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator  
may jeopardize the participant  or may require medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed above  (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requir ing intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or convulsions  occurring at hom e that do not require an 
inpatient hospi talization) . 
All SAEs that occur after any participant  has signed the ICF and throughout the duration of the 
study , whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE report form 
provided by Sage Therapeutics . Any SAE that is ongoing  when the participant  completes their 
final study visit, will be followed by the investigator until the event has resolved, stabilized, 
returned to baseline status , or until  the participant  dies or is lost to follow up . 
A prescheduled or elective procedure  or routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered an 
SAE, even if the participant  is hospitalized. The site must document all of the following:  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled (or on a waiting li st to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the participant ’s 
consent to participate in the study.  
• The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opinion of an 
Investigator, between the participant ’s consent to participate in the study and at the 
time of the procedure or treatment.  
11.2.3.  Definition of Adverse Events of Special Interest  
There are no known adverse event s of special inter est as of the date of signature approval of this 
clinical protocol.  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201 CONFIDENTIAL  
47 11.2.4.  Relationship to Inves tigational Product  
The investigator must make the determination of relationship to the IP for each AE (not related, 
related ). The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the relationship of AEs 
and SAEs to the IP.  
Not Related  An AE will be considered “not related” to the use of the IP if there is not a reasonable 
possibility  that the event has been caused by the IP. Factors pointing towards this 
assessment  include but are  not limited to : the lack of temporal relationship between 
administration of the IP and the event, the presence of biologically implausible 
relationship between the product and the AE, or the presence of a more likely 
alternative explanation for the AE  
Related  An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the IP if there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the product under investigation. 
Factors that point towards this assessment include but are not limited to: a positive  
rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administration of the drug and 
the event, a known response pattern of the suspected drug, improvement following 
discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the 
drug a nd the AE, or a lack of alternative explanation for the AE  
11.2.5.  Recording Adverse Events  
AEs spontaneously reported by the participant  and/or in response to an open question from the 
study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational site . The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible . For each AE, the Invest igator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome  and seriousness  (if 
applicable), and whether or not it caused the participant  to discontinue the IP or withdraw early 
from th e study . 
Intensity will be asses sed according to the following scale:  
• Mild : symptom(s) barely noticeable to participant  or does not make participant  
uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not 
ordinarily needed for r elief of symptom(s)  
• Moderate : symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make participant  uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activity is influenced; participant  is able to continue in study; 
treatment for symptom(s) may be needed  
• Severe : symptom(s) cause sev ere discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or 
significant impact on participant ’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of 
treatment with IP; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or participant  
hospitalized   
It is important to distinguish betwee n serious and severe AEs . Severity is a measure  of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section  11.2.2 . An AE of severe intensity 
may not necessarily be  considered serious.  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201 CONFIDENTIAL  
48 11.2.6.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
In order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting an SAE(s), the study site 
must notify Sage or designee within 24 hours of the stud y site staff becoming aware of the 
SAE(s). The investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE report form , verify the accuracy 
of the information recorded on the SAE report form  with the corresponding source documents, 
and send a copy to  Sage or designe e.  
Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Sage or designee  
within 24 hours  of receipt on a follow -up SAE report form  and placed with the original SAE 
information and kept with the appropriate section of the eCRF and/or study file.  
SAEs occurring after the designated follow up time for the study, should be reported to Sage or 
designee according to the timelines noted above only if the Investigator considers the SAE 
related to IP.  
Sage , or designee,  is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events . It is the principal investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB/EC of all SAEs that occur 
at his or her site . Investigators will also be notified of all suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions  (SUSARs ) that occur during the clinical study. Each site is responsible for notifying its 
IRB of all SUSARs .  
In addition, appropriate personnel in Sage  Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance or designee will 
unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regulatory reporting. Sage  or designee will submit SUSARs 
(in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies according to local law. Sage , or 
designee, will submit S USAR s to investigators in a blinded fashion.  
11.3. Pregnancy  
If a participant  becomes pregnant after the first administration of IP, pregnancy information must 
be collected and recorded on the pregnancy form  and submitted to the sponsor within 24  hours of 
learni ng of the pregnancy. Details will be collected for all  pregnancies for which conception was 
likely  to have occur red after the start of IP administration until 5 terminal half -lives following 
the last administration of IP or until the completion of the stud y whichever is longer . Any 
pregnancy occurring in that time frame will be followed until delivery or termination of the 
pregnancy.  The investigator will also attempt to collect pregnancy information on any 
participant ’s partner who becomes pregnant after t he participant has received the first 
administration of IP . After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnan t 
partner directly, the investigator will follow the same pregnancy reporting procedures specified 
for pregnant participant s.  
The participant  or participant ’s partner will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. The outcome of all pregnancies ( eg, spontaneous abortion , elective abortion , normal 
birth) must be followed and documented even if the participant  was discontinued  from the study. 
The investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant  or participant ’s partner and 
the neonate , and the information will be forwarded to Sage or designee. Generally, follow -up 
will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of 
anomalies) or indication for the procedure . 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201 CONFIDENTIAL  
49 Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a su spicion that a n IP may have 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Any complication during 
pregnancy ( eg, anemia, infections, preeclampsia) should be reported as an AE/SAE. If the 
outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for im mediate classification as an SAE (ie,  
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, ), the investigator should follow the procedures 
for reporting an SAE.  
11.4. Overdose  
An overdose is any dose of study treatment given to a participant  or taken by a participant  that 
exceeds more than one extra tablet within 24 hours as described in protocol. Overdoses are not 
considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE on the eCRF; however , all overdoses must 
be recor ded on an overdose form and s ent to Sage or d esignee within 24 hours of the site 
becoming aware of the overdose.  An overdose must be reported to Sage or designee even if the 
overdose does not result in an AE. If an overdose results in an AE, the AE must be recorded .

50 12. STATISTICS  
Detail ed description of the analyses to be performed in the study will be provided in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock. 
Any changes  or additions to the SAP following database lock will be describe d in detail in the 
clinical study report.  
12.1. Data Analysis Sets  
The Randomized Set will include all participants who are randomized.   
The Safety Set will include all participant s administered IP.  
The Full Analysis Set will include all randomized participant s who received any amount of IP 
and have a baseline and at least one postbaseline Kinesia ONE accelerometer score .  
 
  
The Per Protocol Set will include  all participant s in t he Full Analysis Set without any major 
protocol deviations that could affect efficacy. The review of major protocol deviations will be 
completed, and the decision on whether the deviation affects efficacy will be documented before 
database unblinding.  
12.2. Hand ling of Missing Data  
Every attempt will be made to avoid missing data . All participant s will be used in the analyses, 
as per the analysis populations, using all nonmissing data available . No imputation process will 
be used to estimate missing data .  
12.3. General Considerations  
All participant  data, including those that are derived, that support the tables and figures will be 
presented in the participant  data listings. Some data may be presented only in participant  data 
listing, some may be presented with a  corresponding table or figure; these will be indicated in 
relevant sections below. Participants will be summarized according to treatment received.  
For the purpose of all primary and secondary analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as 
the last mea surement prior to receipt of IP.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each 
time point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will 
include counts and percentages.  
12.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic data, such as age, race, and ethnicity, and baseline characteristics, such as height, 
weight, and BMI, will be summa rized using the Safety Set.

The estimand for the primary efficacy analysis is the treatment difference be tween either dose of 
SAGE -324 and placebo in mean change from baseline in clinic -based Kinesia ONE 
accelerometer scores at Day 2 9 based on the Full Analysis Set . This will be analyzed using a 
mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline 
Kinesia  ONE  accelerometer score, stratification factor, assessment timepoint, and timepoint -by-
treatment as explanatory variables. A ll explanatory variables will be treated as fixed effects. All 
postbaseline clinic visits will be included in the model. The main comparison will be between 
SAGE -324 and placebo at the 2 9-day timepoint. Model -based point estimates (ie, least squares  
means,  5% confidence intervals, and p -values) will be reported where applicable. An 
unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -subject errors. If there is a 
convergence issue with the unstructured covariance model, Toeplitz compound symme try or 
Autoregressive (1) [AR(1)] covariance structure will be used, following this sequence until 
convergence is achieved. If the model still does not converge with AR(1) structure, no results 
will be reported. When the covariance structure is not UN, the  sandwich estimator for the 
variance covariance matrix will be derived, using the EMPIRICAL option in the PROC MIXED 
statement in SAS.  
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used for 
the analysis of the change fr om baseline in TETRAS total performance score s, TETRAS 
performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor scores  and TETRAS ADL score s.  
Other efficacy analyses will be specified in the SAP. In general, data will be analyzed using 
appropriate descriptive statis tics or prespecified statistical methods as applicable; participant  
listings will be provided for all efficacy data. Participant s will be analyzed according to 
randomized treatment for the purpose of efficacy unless otherwise specified.  
Sensitivity analyse s will be described in the SAP. 
12.6. Safety Analyses  
Safety and tolerability of SAGE -324 will be evaluated by AEs, concomitant medication usage, 
 
 Safety data will be listed by participant  and 
summarized by treatment group . All safety summaries will be performed on the Safety Set using 
treatment received.   
12.6.1.  Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulato ry Activities (MedDRA) Version 22.1 
or higher. A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE with onset after the 
first dose of IP. The analysis of AEs will be based on the concept of TEAEs. The incidence of 
TEAEs will be summarized by Syst em Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term. In addition, 
summaries will be provided by intensity (mild, moderate, severe) and by causality (related, not 
related) to IP.  
Any TEAEs leading to discontinuation of treatment or withdrawal from the study and any 
treatment -emergent SAEs  will be summarized.  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201 CONFIDENTIAL  
52 All AEs and SAEs (including those with onset or worsening before the start of IP) through the 
end of the study will be listed.   
12.6.3.  Physical Examinations  
The occurrence of a physical examination , including MSE, (yes/no) and the date performed will 
be listed by participant . 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
12.6.6.  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications will be recorded at each study visit during the study and wil l be coded using World 
Health Organization -Drug dictionary (WHO -DD) September 2015, or later .  
All medications taken within 30 days prior to informed consent through the duration of the study 
will be recorded. In addition, all psychotropic medications take n in the previous 30 days prior to 
screening will be recorded. Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the start of IP will 
be denoted “Prior”. Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the IP and continuing 
beyond the initiation of the  IP or those medications started at the same time or after the initiation 
of the IP will be denoted “Concomitant”.  
Medications will be presented according to whether they are “Prior” or “Concomitant” as 
defined above. If medication dates are incomplete an d it is not clear whether the medication was 
concomitant, it will be assumed to be concomitant.  
Details of prior and concomitant medications will be listed by participant , start date, and 
verbatim term.

53 12.8. Sample Size  and Power  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 3 points difference in the change 
from baseline Kinesia ONE accelerometer between SAGE -324 and placebo with a standard 
deviation of 3.5 points and a 1:1:1 randomization schedule. Under these ass umptions, a sample 
size of 30 evaluable participants per group would provide 90% power for detecting a placebo -
adjusted treatment difference of 3 points in Kinesia accele rometer assuming a 2 -sided test at 
αlevel  of 0.05. By including 3  treatment groups and  using a 1:1:1 randomization ratio, a total of 
90 evaluable participants are required.  Assuming a nonevaluability rate of  25%, at least 120 
subjects will be randomized.

7 This study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 2 9-day treatment period  (28 days of 
dosing) , and a 14 -day follow up period. After providing informed consent, participants will under go 
screening assessments as outlined in Table 2  to determine eligibility.  
Screening Period: The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF). 
Following completion of screening, on Day 1, eligible participants  will visit the study center and will 
be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups (SAGE -324 60 mg daily , or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio. 
Randomization will be stratified based on the use of propranolol for the treatment of ET (Y/N). 
Participants who are on a prop ranolol regimen must have been on a stable dose for at least 1 month 
prior to Day 1 and will continue to be on a stable dose during the Treatment Period. Participants will 
complete baseline assessments of safety and efficacy, including the clinician -rated TETRAS and 
quantitative Kinesia ONE assessments of tremor, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 
2). 
Double -Blind Treatment Period:  Starting on Day 1, participants will receive a single dose of 
investigational product (IP) once daily for  28 days on an outpatient basis. Doses occurring on 
scheduled clinic visits will be administered in the clinic, and doses occurring on all other days may be 
self-administered by the participant at home during the 2 9-day Treatment Period  (28 days of dosing) . 
During the Treatment Period, participants will return to the study center approximately once per week 
for efficacy and safety assessments as specifi ed in  Table 2 . Participants will be trained on the use of 
software applications and devices necessary to complete questionnaires or other assessments as 
required.  
Follow Up Period:  Follow up visits will be conducted on an outpatient basis. Participants will 
continue to complete  questionnaires as indicated in  Table 2  and will receive a phone call 
approximately 7 days after the last dose of IP (ie, Day 3 5) for safety monitoring. Participants will 
return to the study center for an end of study visit approxim ately 14 days following the last dose of IP 
(ie, Day 4 2). 
Participants who discontinue IP during the Treatment Period will be asked to return to the clinic as 
soon as possible for an end of treatment (EOT) visit. Follow -up visits should take place as scheduled , 
or relative to the last dose of IP if discontinuing treatment early . If at any time after the EOT visit, a  
participant  decides to withdraw from the study, the participant  should return for an early termination 
visit (ETV) . The EOT and  ETV  can be on the same day if a participant  discontinues IP and withdraws 
from the study on the same day during a clinic visit;  in this case, all events scheduled for the EOT 
visit will be conducted . 
During the study, a phone call will be conducted  once  per week (preferably mid -week) in between  
clinic visits , to review current status of participant . 
Number of Participants  (planned):  Approximately 60 participants, with approximately 30 per arm.

Investigational Product  Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
SAGE -324 (60 mg) or matched placebo oral tablets will be administered in the clinic or self -
administer ed once  daily , in the morning  with food .  
Duration of Treatment:  
Each participant will receive a single dose of SAGE -324 oral tablet s or matching placebo 
administered once  daily for 28 days.   
Statistical Methods:  
A separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide a detailed description of the data analyses to be 
performed in the study. The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.  
General Considerations  
For the purpose of all efficacy and safety analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the last 
measurement prior to the start of IP administration.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each time 
point and summarized descriptively. For categorical en dpoints, descriptive summaries will include 
counts and percentages.  
Analysis Sets  
The Randomized Set is defined as all participants who are randomized.  
The Safety Set will include all participants who were administered IP.  
The Full Analysis Set will include all randomized participants who received any amount of IP and 
have a baseline and at least one postbaseline clinic -based Kinesia  ONE  accelerometer score.  
 
 
The Per Protocol Set will include all participants in the F ull Analysis Set  without any major protocol 
deviations that could affect efficacy. The review of major protocol deviations will be completed, and 
the decision on whether the d eviation affects efficacy will be documented before database unblinding.  
Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 3 points difference in the change from 
baseline Kinesia ONE accelerometer scores  between SAG E-324 and placebo with a standard 
deviation of 3.5 points. Under these assumptions, a sample size of 25 evaluable participants  per group 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 2  CONFIDENTIAL  
11 would provide 85% power for detecting a placebo -adjusted treatment difference of 3 points in Kinesia 
accelerometer assuming a  2-sided test at an alpha  level  of 0.05. By including  2 treatment groups and 
using a 1:1 randomization, a total of 50 evaluable participants  are required.  Assuming a 
nonevaluability rate of  15%, approximately 60 participants  will be randomized.  Additional 
participants  may be enrolled if the drop -out rate is higher than 15%.  
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The estimand for the primary efficacy analysis is the treatment difference between SAGE -324 and 
placebo in mean change from baseline in c linic-based Kinesia ONE accelerometer scores at Day 2 9 
based on F ull Analysis Set . This will be analyzed using a mixed effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline Kinesia  ONE accelerometer score, stratification 
factor, assessment timepoint, and timepoint -by-treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory 
variables will be treated as fixed effects. All postbaseline clinic visits will be included in the model. 
The main comparison will be between SAGE -324 and plac ebo at the 2 9-day timepoint. Model -based 
point estimates (ie, least squares means, 95% confidence intervals, and p -values) will be reported 
where applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -subject 
errors. If there is a convergence issue with the unstructured covariance model, Toeplitz compound 
symmetry or Autoregressive (1) [AR(1)] covariance structure will be used, following this sequence 
until convergence is achieved. If the model still does not converge with AR(1) s tructure, no results 
will be reported. When the covariance structure is not unstructured , the sandwich estimator for the 
variance covariance matrix will be derived, using the EMPIRICAL option in the PROC MIXED 
statement in SAS.  
Analysis of Secondary Effica cy Endpoints  
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used to 
analy ze of the change from baseline in TETRAS total performance score s, TETRAS Performance 
subscale part 4 upper limb tremor  score s and TETRAS ADL score s.  
Safety Analysis  
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by incidence of TEAEs /serious adverse events, 
 
  
 
 
 
Interim Analysis  
The sponsor may conduct an interim analysis . Detailed descriptions of planned  data analyses will be 
provided in a  separate interim statistical analysis plan (SAP) , if applicable .

Note:  
• IP doses will be administered in the clinic on Days 1  and 15. On all other days, IP doses may be administered at home.  
• A phone call  will be performed once, mid -week between clinic visits during the Treatment Period , and once per week during the Follow -Up Period.  
During the phone call, t he current status of the participant  will be reviewed , includi ng but not limited to, AE reporting and characterization, IP 
compliance review, and assessment of general we ll-being . Days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 2 9 are clinic visits.  
• The suggested order of assessments during clinic visits is: vital signs , Kinesia, TETRAS, EC G, blood sample collection for  and clinical laboratory 
assessments, and questionnaires . 
• All Day 1 assessments will be performed predose.  
 
a Participants who discontinue IP during the treatment period should return to the site for an EOT visit as soon as  possible. Participants who discontinue IP will 
be encouraged to continue on study and complete safety assessments and follow -up visits. Follow -up visits should take place as scheduled relative to the last 
dose of IP. If at any time after the EOT visit, a participant decides to withdraw from the study, the participant should return for an ETV . The EOT and ETV s 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 2  CONFIDENTIAL  
15 can be on the same day if a participant discontinues IP and withdraws from the study on the same day during a clinic visit . In such case, all procedures  
scheduled for EOT and E TV will be conducted.  
b Randomization will occur on Day 1 only.  In addition to meeting all other eligibility criteria , eligibility is determined based on the total upper extremity 
TETRAS score of ≥8 with at least  1 upper extremity TETRAS score >4  at Screening . 
c Complete physical examinations (including MS E and neurologic examination  as parts of physical examination ) should be performed as specified and as 
clinically necessary (see Section  11.1.3 ).  
d Vital signs without orthostat ic blood pressure  and heart rate  will be collected  predose in the beginning of each visit  and again  prior to departing the clinic, at 
approximately  5 hours (±30 min) . Postdose  vital signs to includ e orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate , measured after the participant has been in the supine 
position for at least 5 minutes and then repeated 1 minute and 3 minutes after standing.  
e ECGs will be collected and read centrally. ECGs will be performed approximately  5 hours  (±30 min)  postdose. All ECGs must be performed after the 
participant has been in a supine position for at least 5 minutes.  
 
 
  
g Kinesia ONE will be assessed simultaneous to TETRAS Performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor . On clinic dosing days, participants will perform 
Kinesia ONE assessments approximately 30 to 60 minutes  prior to dosing  in the morning . In addition, on Day 15 , Kinesia ONE assessments will be performed 
at 5 and 8 hours ( ±30 min) postdose.  
h Training specific to  the Investigational Product Diary  will be performed prior to randomization .  
i The TETRAS Perform ance and TETRAS ADL subscales will be assessed at Screening and predose at each clinic visit  postrandomization . The TETRAS 
Performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor will be assessed simultaneous to Kinesia ONE. In addition, on Day 15,  the TETRAS Performance  subscale  will 
be assessed  at 5 and 8 hours (± 30 min) postdose.  Eligibility is determined based on the combined TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor total 
score ≥8, with at least 1 upper limb score >4 at Screening.  
j Participants  will be trained on the use of software applications and devices necessary for the conduct of the study by site personnel.  
k Prior and concomitant medications will be recorded during Screening and will include all medications and supplements  taken within t he 30 days prior to 
signing the ICF  through the first dose of IP.  Concomitant medications will be recorded thereafter throughout the duration of the study. At Screening, this will 
include year of diagnosis and history of treatments for ET since year of dia gnosis  and use of antidepressant medications taken in the prior 12 months .

22 5. INTRODUCTION  
SAGE -324 is a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of A -type γ -aminobutyric acid -gated 
chloride channel (GABA A) receptors, the major class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in 
the brain.  In addition to being developed as an  adjunctive therapy in epilepsy and other seizure 
disorders  under IND 139201, SAGE -324 is also being developed for the treatment of Essential 
Tremor (ET).  
Essential tremor is a permanently debilitating, neurologically determined, common movement 
disorder c haracterized by involuntary rhythmic oscillation of a body part due to intermittent 
muscle contractions typically occurring when not at rest, thus interfering with fine motor skills 
associated with daily activities ( Olanow 2008 , Deuschl 2011 , Hopfner 201 6, NIH 2019 ). 
Although the pathophysiology and etiology of ET is not fully understood, it is postulated that 
approximately 50% of ET patients feature an autosomal dominant pattern of familial inheritance 
and that non -inherited cases may have toxin -based or o ther causality ( Olanow 2008 , Hopfner 
2016). ET is the most common movement disorder in the US, with prevalence estimated to be 
approximately 2.2% of the population, representing a substantial societal medical burden with 
over an estimated 7 million ET pati ents in the US alone ( Louis 2014 ).  
In general, active tasks of daily life are adversely impacted by ET, including but not limited to 
speech, handwriting, household tasks, and occupational demands, contributing negatively to 
psychosocial well -being, genera l anxiety, and overall quality of life  (Koller, 1989 ). Although 
benign in term of its effect on life expectancy, ET is a progressive neurodegenerative condition 
whose symptoms are typically disabling, often forcing patients to change jobs or seek early 
retirement ( Zappia, 2013 ). In some cases, serious disability may ensue.   
The pharmacological profile  of SAGE -324 is theorized to  induce therapeutic effect  in the 
treatment of ET. Based on preclinical studies of  SAGE -324, which features a different 
mechanism of action than that of propranolol, the pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamic (PD) 
profile suggests SAGE -324 may safely ameliorate symptoms in patients suffering from ET, 
regardless of propranolol use . 
There are currently ongoing Phase 1 clinical s tudies of SAGE -324 in healthy adults  and in adults 
with ET . These studies , in addition to preclinical studies of SAGE -324, are detailed in the 
investigator’s brochure.  
With a GABA A receptor -based mechanism of action  featuring  positive allosteric modulation  
capability , SAGE -324 represents a novel approach to treatment of ET with possible utility  as 
monotherapy or adjunctive  to propranolol, which may help address the unmet medical need of 
the ET population , warranting further study of SAGE -324 as a potential treatment for this 
common movement disorder.  
Henceforth, this double -blind, placebo -controlled efficacy and safety study of SAGE -324 will be 
conducted in adults  with and without concomitant use of propranolol and  is designed to assess 
the effect of SAGE -324 on a variety of outcome measures specific to ET disease characteristics  
and associate d quality of life  domains .

23 5.1. Dose Justification  
The d ose of SAGE -324 planned for  this study  is 60 mg given as oral tablets, to be  administered 
once daily in the morning with food. Th e dose  was selected based on preliminary data from 
3 active studies of SAGE -324, which included : unblinded data from completed cohorts in 
324-CLP-101 Part A (oral solution SAGE -324 doses of 3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg, 60 mg) ; 
Part C (oral solution SAGE -324 doses of 30 mg) ; Part D (oral suspension SAGE -324 doses of 
30 mg) in healthy subjects ; and  preliminary data from open -label Part E (oral suspension SAGE -
324 doses of 45 mg and 60 mg) in participants with  ET; additional preliminary data from 
324-CLP-102 cohorts 1 through 6  (cohorts 1 to 5 unblinded, cohort 6 blinded) , which evaluated 
oral suspension doses ranging from 5 mg to 60 mg; and preliminary unblinded data from 
324-CLP-104, which compared the relati ve bioavailability of the oral tablet (30 mg) vs oral 
suspension (30 mg) formulations of SAGE -324 and separately the effect of food on the PK of the 
SAGE -324 oral tablet. In 324 -CLP-101 and 324 -CLP-102 studies, doses were administered in a 
fasted state. Th e preliminary data from all of these active studies collectively informed the route 
of administration (oral) and dose strength of 60 mg as oral tablets planned for further evaluation 
in this study .  
SAGE -324 was generally well -tolerated in participants wit h ET and in healthy volunteers, as was 
shown in the preliminary data of 324 -CLP-101 Part E at single administration doses of 45 mg 
and 60 mg, and in 324 -CLP-102 through once -daily administered doses of up to 60 mg  for 
14 days. In addition, tremor reduction was observed at both doses on TETRAS and Kinesia 
accelerometry, with greater improvement seen at 60  mg compared to 45  mg.  
In the clinically complete  study 324-CLP-104, preliminary data showed that SAGE -324 oral 
tablets, when coadministered with a meal, resulted in exposures approximately equivalent to that 
of SAGE -324 oral suspension under fasted conditions. Therefore, the SAGE -324 oral tablets are 
recommended to be administered with food.  
5.2. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Based on the mechanism of action of SAGE -324 and the results of completed nonclinical studies 
and preliminary data of currently ongoing clinical studies of SAGE -324, it is theorized that 
participants  may have  symptomatic ameliorat ion, ie, tremor reduction and possibly improved 
quality of life  from potentially stabilizing disease characteristics associated with ET. 
Potential risks anticipated in this study are based on available data from toxicology studies of 
SAGE -324 in addition to preliminary data from 3 ongoing, currently active Phase 1 clinical 
studies of SAGE -324.  
As of  20 December 2019 , there have been no dea ths or SAEs  related to IP , and a s of 18 October 
2019, based on the preliminary clinical data available, there have been no confirmed  clinically 
significant trends in clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, or physical examinations. 
Available prelimin ary clinical data is summarized in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
Based on available preliminary clinical data  from SAGE -324 active clinical studies , AEs of 
somnolence and feeling of relaxation are considered adverse drug reactions.  In addition to 
scheduled clinic visits, the current status of study participants will be reviewed via weekly phone 
calls, in between clinic visits.

26 7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SAGE -324 as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy with 
propranolol in individuals with ET. Participants, site staff, and sponsor  personnel will be masked 
to treatment allocation  (see Section  8.5). 
This study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 2 9-day treatment period consisting of 
28 days of dosing with the end of treatment visit  intended to be on Day 29 at trough , and a 
14-day follow -up period  relative to final dose  (Figure 1). After providing informed consent, 
participants will undergo screening assessments as outlined in Table 2  to determine eligibility .  
The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF). Following 
completion of screening , on Day 1, eligible participants will visit the study center and will be 
randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups (SAGE -324 60 mg  or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio. 
Randomization will be stratified based on the use of propranolol for the treatment of ET (Y/N). 
Participants who are on a propranolol regimen must have been on a stable regimen for at least 1 
month  prior to Day 1 and will continue to be on that stable regimen during the Treatment Period. 
Participants will complete baseline assessments of safety and efficacy, including the clinician -
rated TETRAS and quantitative Kinesia ONE assessments of tremor, as specified in the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 2 ). 
During the double -blind Treatment Period, s tarting on Day 1, participants will receive a single 
dose of investigational product (IP) once daily for 28 days on an outpatient basis. Doses 
occu rring on scheduled clinic visits will be administered in the clinic, and doses occurring on all 
other days will be self -administered by the participant at home  as specified in Table 2 . During 
the Treatment Period, participants will return to the study center approximately once per week 
for efficacy and safety assessments as specified in  Table 2 . In addition, a phone call will be 
conducted once per week (preferably mid -week) in  between clinic visits, to review current status 
of the participant.  
In addition to Kinesia ONE -specific training, c linical study center staff and study p articipants 
will be trained on the use of software applications and devices necessary to complete 
questionnaires or  other assessments as required.  During in-clinic visits, c linical study center staff 
will be available to assis t participants as needed , to ensure they can  access and us e the software  
applications and devices  correctly according to the training . 
During the fo llow-up period, visits will be conducted on an outpatient basis. In addition to the 
phone calls to review cu rrent status, p articipants will receive a phone call approximately 7 days 
after the last dose of IP (ie, Day 35) for safety monitoring. Participants will return to the study 
center for an end of study visit approximately 14 days following the last dose of IP (ie, Day 42) . 
Participants who discontinue IP during the Treatment Period will be asked to return to the clinic 
as soon as possible for an end of treatment (EOT) visit. Follow -up visits should take place as 
scheduled, or relative to the last dose of IP if discontinuing treatment early. If at any time after 
the EOT visit, a participant decides to withdraw from the study, the participant should return for 
an early termination visit  (ETV) . The EOT and ETV  can be on the same day if a participant 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 2  CONFIDENTIAL  
27 discontin ues IP and withdraws from the study on the same day during a clinic visit; in this case, 
all events scheduled for the EOT visit will be conducted.

Abbreviation:  EOT = end of treatment  
7.2. Number of Participa nts 
Approximately 60 participants  are planned , with approximately 30 participants enrolled per arm , 
to produce 25 evaluable participants per arm  for primary efficacy  analysis . Additional 
participants may be randomized if the drop -out rate is higher than anticipated ( ie, >15%). 
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
Participants will be assigned to IP (active or placebo) in accordance with the randomization 
schedule on Day 1. Additional details on randomization and blinding  are provided in Section  8.5.  
7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria   
If participants report adverse events that are  considered by the investigator to be related to the IP 
and not tolerable , the investigator may reduce the dose of IP from 60 mg in 15 mg increments 
until tolerability is established.  The reduced  dose of IP will continue to be administered once 
daily at the  same schedule as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2). The dose of IP 
may not be increased for the remainder of the study . The dose may not be reduced below 30 mg: 
if intolerable adverse events persist at the 30 mg dose, the IP should be permanently stopped.  
Otherwise, IP doses will not be further adjusted for this study except as clinically necessary , eg, 
interrupting dose due to an AE or  serious adverse event ( SAE ) considered related to IP . 
7.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
Sage Therapeutics may terminate this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety 
reasons including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting unaccep table risk to 
participant s, or for administrative reasons . In the event of study termination, Sage Therapeutics 
will provide written notification to the investigator . Investigational sites must promptly notify 
their IRB/ ethics committee  (EC) , where require d, and initiate withdrawal procedures for 
participating participant s.

9.4. Treatment Adherence  
The first dose of IP will be received and administered by participants in the clinic . Participant s 
will be dispensed a  7-day supply of IP to orally self -administer  at home with instructions 
specifying to administer in the morning with food. Treatment adherence will be monitored by the 
site staff at each in-clinic visit  by direct questioning  and counting  returned tablets  and will be 
documented . Details on drug accountability are included in  Section  9.6. 
9.5. Randomization and Blinding  
This is a  randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study. Participants will be random ized in 
a stratified  manner based on propranolol for the treatment of ET (Y/N); randomization will be 
done within each stratum in a 1:1 ratio  to treatment group s (SAGE -324, 60 mg or placebo) . 
Participants, site staff, and the sponsor will be blinded to treatment allocation. Randomization 
schedules will be generated by an independent statistician . The randomization schedules will be 
kept strictly confidential, accessible only to authorized  personnel until the time of unblinding. 
The blinding of the study  will be broken after the database has been locked.  
9.5.1.  Emergency Unblinding  
During the study, the blind is to be broken only when the safety of a participant  is at risk and the 
treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received. Unless a participant  is at immediate 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 2  CONFIDENTIAL  
34 risk, the Investigator should  make diligent attempts to contact Sage prior to unblinding the study 
treatment administered to a participant . Request s from the investigator about the treatment 
administered to study participant s should  be discusse d with the Sage  Medical Monitor . If the 
unblinding occurs without Sage’s knowledge, the investigator must notify Sage within 24 hours 
of breaking the blind. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly 
documented in the source recor ds.  
In all cases where the IP allocation for a participant  is unblinded, pertinent information 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the participant ’s records and on the 
eCRF. At the time of withdrawal  from the study /stopping partici pation , if possible, an EOT 
and/or ETV  should be conducted .  
If a participant or study personnel become unblinded to treatment, the participant will be 
excluded from the Per Protocol analysis set, as detailed further in the statistical analysis plan.

ASSESSMENTS  
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1.  Kinesia ONE™ Accelerometer Score  
Kinesia ONE™ is an ISO -certified  wireless motion sensor wor n distally on the index finger , 
which utilizes 3 orthogonal accelerometers and 3 orthogonal gyroscopes to monitor three -
dimensional motion. Data is transmitted wirelessly from the sensor to a Bluetooth  technology -
enabled device  to use with the  Kinesia ONE software  (eg, Apple iPad or similar device with 
preinstalled Kinesia ONE software) . The device has received FDA clearance . 
Via the Kinesia ONE software application, m easures of three -dimensional  motion  are converted 
to scores  ranging from 0 to 4 , per assessed maneuver ; higher scores indicate greater  tremor  
severity . Motion in both arms is captured.  
Participants will complete this assessment at each clinic visit as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 2 ).  
11.1.2.  The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale  
TETRAS is a validated , comprehensive clinical assessment of essential tremor  (Elble 2013).  
Three different components of TETRAS will be assessed in this study. The TETRAS ADL 
subscale, total performance score, and performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor  score , and 
will each be separately assessed  at each clinic visit as specified in the Sc hedule of Assessments 
(Table 2 ). 
The ADL subscale assesses how ET is impacting typical activities of daily living (ie, speech, 
eating, drinking, dressing, personal hygiene, writing, occupational impairment, social impact, 
and activities affected by upper limb tremor). It consists of 12 items that are  each rated in from 
0 (normal activity)  to 4 (severe abnormality) . The overall ADL score range is 0 to 48.  
The total performance score is based on overall rating  of the performance  subscale , which 
measures tremor amplitude in the voice, limbs , head, face,  trunk, and also  measures functional 
task capabilities, ie, handwriting, spirography,  and h olding a pen over a dot . Each of these items 
is rated on a scale from 0  (no tremor) to 4 (severe tremor). Collectively, the performance items  
generate an  overall performance score from 0 to 64 .  
For the performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor  score , all 3 maneuvers in the upper limb 
assessments  of part 4 (subscale items 4a, 4b, and 4c) will be completed for both arms, first for 
the left arm and then for the right . The part 4 subscale ordinally rates postural  (limbs extended 
forward  maneuver, and wing -beating  [elbows flexed] maneuver) , and kinetic  (finger -nose-finger 
maneuver)  tremor on a 0 to 4  severity scale  in 0.5 -point increments.

42 11.3. Other Patient -Reported Assessment s 
11.3.1.  Patient Perception of Response Burden  
The Patient Perception of Response Burden Questionnaire is a patient -reported measure that 
assesses the multidimensional construct of response burden ( Atkinson 2019 ). 
Participants respond t o 6 items assessing 1) how well the questions related to their actual 
concerns, 2) how comfortable the participants were with answering the questions, 3) how well 
the survey characterized their health and well -being, 4) the length of time to complete the 
questionnaires, 5) whether questions seemed unimportant or repetitive, and 6) what additional 
information should have been gathered. Items 1 to 3 are assessed on a 0 to 10 scale, item 4 is 
assessed on a 1 to 3 scale, and items 5 and 6 are open -ended. Items 1 and 4 are reverse scored. A 
composite score can be calculated to create a weighted representative index of relevance, 
comfort, and well -being relative to time to completion (ie, items 1, 2, and 3 were summed and 
multiplied by item 4) for a range of 0 to 72, with higher scores indicative of elevated endorsed 
response burden. The open -ended items will be summarized thematically. The Patient Perception 
of Response Burden Questionnaire will be performed as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 2 ).

43 12. SAFETY  ASSESSMENTS  
12.1. Safety Parameters  
All assessments will be conducted according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2). 
12.1.1.  Demograph y and Medical History  
Demographic characteristics (age, race, sex, ethnicity) and a full medical history will be 
documented . This  must  also additionally include  participant  recall of history of  ET, disease 
duration, past treatments  used, and responsiveness to  alcohol  and/or other treatments  with use 
intended  as off-label  treatment  of ET (eg, primidone  or similar t herapies ). 
12.1.2.  Weight and Height  
Height and weight wi ll be measured and documented . Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated 
and documented.   
12.1.3.  Physical Examination  
Whenever possible, the same individual should perform all physical examinations . Physical 
examinations will include assessment of body systems (eg, head, eye, ear, nose and throat; heart; 
lungs; abdomen; and extremities) as well as cognitive and neurological examination and MSE . 
Unscheduled physical examinations may also be conducted p er the Investigator’s discretion.  
Any abnormality in physical examinations will be interpreted by an investigator as abnormal, not 
clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) in source documents .  
12.1.4.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise  heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and blood pressure. Systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure are to be measured after the participant  has been supine for at least 
5 minutes prior to the measurement. When assessed postdose,  orthostatic blood pressu re and 
heart rate will also be measured after the participant  has been in the supine position for at least 
5 minutes and then repeated approximately 1 and 3 minutes after standing .  
Any abnormality in vital signs will be interpreted by an Investigator as a bnormal, NCS; or 
abnormal, CS in source documents . 
12.1.5.  Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed . The standard intervals (heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF ) 
as well as any rhythm abnormalities will be recorded.  
Electrocardiograms will be performed after the participant  has been resting in a supine position 
for at least 5 minutes. When ECG measurement s coincide with safety assessments, vital signs 
assessment or blood draws, procedures should be carried out in said  order  (vital  signs , ECG, 
blood draw) . 
All abnormal ECGs will be interpreted by an investigator as abnormal , NCS, or abnormal , CS in 
source documents .

46 12.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  Definition  
An SAE  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose : 
• Results in death  
• Places the participant  at immediate risk of death (a life -threatening event); however, 
this does no t include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death   
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a  congenital abnormality or birth defect  
An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator  
may jeopardize the participant  or may require medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed above  (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requir ing intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or convulsions  occurring at hom e that do not require an 
inpatient hospitalization) . 
All SAEs that occur after any participant  has signed the ICF and throughout the duration of the 
study , whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE report form 
provided by Sage Therapeutics . Any SAE that is ongoing when the participant  completes their 
final study visit, will be followed by the investigator until the event has resolved, stabilized, 
returned to baseline status , or until  the participant  dies or is lost to follow up . 
A prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered an 
SAE, even if the participant  is hospitalized. The site must document all of the following:  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled (or on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the participant ’s 
consent to participate i n the study.  
• The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opinion of an 
Investigator, between the participant ’s consent to participate in the study  and at the

324-ETD -201, Version 2  CONFIDENTIAL  
47 12.2.4.  Relationship to Inves tigational Product  
The investigator must make the determination of relationship to the IP for each AE (not related, 
related ). The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the relationship of AEs 
and SAEs to the IP.  
Not Related  An AE will be conside red “not related” to the use of the IP if there is not a reasonable 
possibility  that the event has been caused by the IP. Factors pointing towards this 
assessment  include but are not limited to : the lack of temporal relationship between 
administration of t he IP and the event, the presence of biologically implausible 
relationship between the product and the AE, or the presence of a more likely 
alternative explanation for the AE  
Related  An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the IP if there is a re asonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the product under investigation. 
Factors that point towards this assessment include but are not limited to: a positive 
rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administration of the dru g and 
the event, a known response pattern of the suspected drug, improvement following 
discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the 
drug and the AE, or a lack of alternative explanation for the AE  
12.2.5.  Recording Adverse Events  
AEs spontaneously reported by the participant  and/or in response to an open question from the 
study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational site . The AE term should be reported in standar d medical terminology when 
possible . For each AE, the Investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome  and seriousness  (if 
applicable), and whether or not it caused the participant  to discontinue the IP or withdraw early 
from the study . 
Intensity will be asses sed according to the following scale:  
• Mild : symptom(s) barely noticeable to participant  or does not make participa nt 
uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not 
ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s)  
• Moderate : symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make participant  uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activity is influenced;  participant  is able to continue in study; 
treatment for symptom(s) may be needed  
• Severe : symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or 
significant impact on participant ’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of 
treatment with IP; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or participant  
hospitalized   
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs . Severity is a measure  of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section  11.2.2 . An AE of severe intensity 
may not necessarily be  considered serious.

324-ETD -201, Version 2  CONFIDENTIAL  
48 12.2.6.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
In order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting an SAE(s), the study site 
must notify Sage or designee within 24 hours of the study site staff becoming aware of the 
SAE(s). The investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE repor t form , verify the accuracy 
of the information recorded on the SAE report form  with the corresponding source documents, 
and send a copy to  Sage or designee.  
Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Sage or designee  
within 24 hours  of receipt on a follow -up SAE report form  and placed with the original SAE 
information and kept with the appropriate section of the eCRF and/or study file.  
SAEs occurring after the designated follow up time for the study, should be reporte d to Sage or 
designee according to the timelines noted above only if the Investigator considers the SAE 
related to IP.  
Sage , or designee,  is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events . It is the principal investigator’ s responsibility to notify the IRB/EC of all SAEs that occur 
at his or her site . Investigators will also be notified of all suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions  (SUSARs ) that occur during the clinical study. Each site is responsible for notifying  its 
IRB of all SUSARs .  
In addition, appropriate personnel in Sage  Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance or designee will 
unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regulatory reporting. Sage  or designee will submit SUSARs 
(in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulato ry agencies according to local law. Sage , or 
designee, will submit SUSAR s to investigators in a blinded fashion.  
12.3. Pregnancy  
If a participant  becomes pregnant after the first administration of IP, pregnancy information must 
be collected and recorded on the pregnancy form  and submitted to the sponsor within 24  hours of 
learning of the pregnancy. Details will be collected for all  pregnancies for which conception was 
likely  to have occur red after the start of IP administration until 5 terminal half -lives following 
the last administration of IP or until the completion of the study whichever is longer . Any 
pregnancy occurring in that time frame will be followed until delivery or termination of the 
pregn ancy.  The investigator will also attempt to collect pregnancy information on any 
participant ’s partner who becomes pregnant after the participant has received the first 
administration of IP . After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pr egnan t 
partner directly, the investigator will follow the same pregnancy reporting procedures specified 
for pregnant participant s.  
The participant  or participant ’s partner will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. The outcome of all preg nancies ( eg, spontaneous abortion , elective abortion , normal 
birth) must be followed and documented even if the participant  was discontinued  from the study. 
The investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant  or participant ’s partner and 
the neonate , and the information will be forwarded to Sage or designee. Generally, follow -up 
will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimat ed delivery date. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of 
anomalies) or indication for the procedure . 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 2  CONFIDENTIAL  
49 Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that a n IP may have 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Any complication during 
pregnancy ( eg, anemia, infections, preeclampsia) should be reported as an AE/SAE. If the 
outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SA E (ie,  
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death ), the investigator should follow the procedures 
for reporting an SAE.  
12.4. Overdose  
An overdose is any dose of study treatment given to a participant  or taken by a participant  that 
exceeds more than one e xtra tablet within 24 hours as described in protocol. Overdoses are not 
considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE on the eCRF; however , all overdoses must 
be recor ded on an overdose form and sent to Sage or d esignee within 24 hours of the site 
becoming aware of the overdose.  An overdose must be reported to Sage or designee even if the 
overdose does not result in an AE. If an overdose results in an AE, the AE must be recorded .

50 13. STATISTICS  
Detailed description of the analyses to be performed in th e study will be provided in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock. 
Any changes  or additions to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the 
clinical study report.  
13.1. Data Analy sis Sets  
The Randomized Set will include all participants who are randomized.   
The Safety Set will include all participant s administered IP.  
The Full Analysis Set will include all randomized participant s who received any amount of IP 
and have a baseline and at least one postbaseline Kinesia ONE accelerometer score .  
 
  
The Per Protocol Set will include  all participant s in t he Full Analysis Set without any major 
protocol deviations that could affect efficacy. The review of major protocol deviations will be 
completed, and the decision on whether the deviation affects efficacy will be documented before 
database unblinding.  
13.2. Hand ling of Missing Data  
Every attempt will be made to avoid missing data . All participant s will be used in the analyses, 
as per the analysis populations, using all nonmissing data available . No imputation process will 
be used to estimate missing data .  
13.3. Genera l Considerations  
All participant  data, including those that are derived, that support the tables and figures will be 
presented in the participant  data listings. Some data may be presented only in participant  data 
listing, some may be presented with a corresponding table or figure; these will be indicated in 
relevant sections below. Participants will be summarized according to treatment received.  
For the purpose of all primary and secondary analyses where appl icable, baseline is defined as 
the last measurement prior to receipt of IP.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at eac h 
time point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will 
include counts and percentages.  
13.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic data, such as age, race, and ethnicity, and baseline characteristics, suc h as height, 
weight, and BMI, will be summarized using the Safety Set.  
Pregnancy  test results and drug screen results will be listed but not summarized .  
Medical history will be listed by participant .  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 2  CONFIDENTIAL  
51 13.5. Efficacy Analysis  
The estimand for the primary effic acy analysis is the treatment difference between SAGE -324 
and placebo in mean change from baseline in clinic -based Kinesia ONE accelerometer scores at 
Day 2 9 based on the Full Analysis Set . This will be analyzed using a mixed effects model for 
repeated mea sures (MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline Kinesia  ONE  
accelerometer score, stratification factor, assessment timepoint, and timepoint -by-treatment as 
explanatory variables. All explanatory variables will be treated as fixed effects. All postbaseline 
clinic visits will be included in the model. The main compa rison will be between SAGE -324 and 
placebo at the 2 9-day timepoint. Model -based point estimates (ie, least squares  means, 5% 
confidence intervals, and p -values) will be reported where applicable. An unstructured 
covariance structure will be used to model t he within -subject errors. If there is a convergence 
issue with the unstructured covariance model, Toeplitz compound symmetry or Autoregressive 
(1) [AR(1)] covariance structure will be used, following this sequence until convergence is 
achieved. If the mode l still does not converge with AR(1) structure, no results will be reported. 
When the covariance structure is not UN, the sandwich estimator for the variance covariance 
matrix will be derived, using the EMPIRICAL option in the PROC MIXED statement in SAS.  
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used for 
the analysis of the change from baseline in TETRAS total performance score s, TETRAS 
performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor scores  and TETRAS ADL score s.  
Other efficacy analyses will be specified in the SAP. In general, data will be analyzed using 
appropriate descriptive statistics or prespecified statistical methods as applicable; participant  
listings will be provided for all efficacy data. Participant s will be analyzed according to 
randomized treatment for the purpose of efficacy unless otherwise specified.  
Sensitivity analyses will be described in the SAP. 
13.6. Safety Analyses  
Safety and tolerability of SAGE -324 will be evaluated by AEs, concomitant medication us age, 
 
 Safety data will be listed by participant  and 
summarized by treatment group . All safety summaries will be performed on the Safety Set using 
treatment received.   
13.6.1.  Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 22.1 
or higher. A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as  an AE with onset after the 
first dose of IP. The analysis of AEs will be based on the concept of TEAEs. The incidence of 
TEAEs will be summarized by System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term. In addition, 
summaries will be provided by intensity (mild, m oderate, severe) and by causality (related, not 
related) to IP.  
Any TEAEs leading to discontinuation of treatment or withdrawal from the study and any 
treatment -emergent SAEs  will be summarized.  
All AEs and SAEs (including those with onset or worsening b efore the start of IP) through the 
end of the study will be listed.

52 13.6.3.  Physical Examinations  
The occurrence of a physical examinatio n, including MSE, (yes/no) and the date performed will 
be listed by participant . 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
13.6.6.  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications will be recorded at each study visit during the study and will be coded using World 
Health Organization -Drug dictionary (WHO -DD) September 2015, or later .  
All medi cations taken within 30 days prior to informed consent through the duration of the study 
will be recorded. In addition, all psychotropic medications taken in the previous 30 days prior to 
screening will be recorded. Those medications taken prior to the ini tiation of the start of IP will 
be denoted “Prior”. Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the IP and continuing 
beyond the initiation of the IP or those medications started at the same time or after the initiation 
of the IP will be denoted “Co ncomitant”.  
Medications will be presented according to whether they are “Prior” or “Concomitant” as 
defined above. If medication dates are incomplete and it is not clear whether the medication was 
concomitant, it will be assumed to be concomitant.  
Detail s of prior and concomitant medications will be listed by participant , start date, and 
verbatim term.  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 2  CONFIDENTIAL  
53 13.8. Sample Size  and Power  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 3 points difference i n the change 
from baseline Kinesia ONE accelerometer between SAGE -324 and placebo with a standard 
deviation of 3.5 points. Under these assumptions, a sample size of 25 evaluable participants per 
group would provide 85% power for detecting a placebo -adjuste d treatment difference of 3 
points in Kinesia accele rometer assuming a 2 -sided test at an alpha level  of 0.05. By including 
2 treatment groups and using a 1:1  randomization, a total of 50 evaluable participants are 
required. Assuming a nonevaluability rate of  15%, approximately  60 participants  will be 
randomized.  Additional participants may be enrolled if the dropout rate is greater than 15%.

6 Study Description : 
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group  study to evaluate the efficacy, 
safety, and tolerability of SAGE -324 in individuals with ET. Participants, site staff, and sponsor 
personnel will be masked to treatment allocation.  
This study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 2 9-day treatment period  (28 days of dosing) , 
and a 14 -day follow up period. After providing informed consent, participants will undergo screening 
assessments as outlined in Table 2  to determine eligibility.  
Screening Period: The Screening Period begins with the signing of the inf ormed consent form (ICF). 
Eligible participants will visit the study center on Day 1 and complete additional eligibility  and baseline  
assessments, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ). Following completion of screening

7 and Day 1  eligibility check s, participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups ( SAGE -324 60 
mg daily , or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio.   
Double -Blind Treatment Period:  Starting on Day 1, participants will receive a single dose of 
investigational product (IP) once daily for  28 days on an outpatient basis , to be taken  in the morning 
with food that comprises a minimum of 400 calories . Doses occurring on scheduled clinic visits will be 
administered in the clinic, and doses occurring on all other days will be self -administered by the 
participant at home. During the Treatment Period, participants will r eturn to the study center 
approximately once per week for efficacy and safety assessments as specified in  Table 2 . Participants 
will be trained on the use  of software applications and devices necessary to complete questionnaires or 
other assessments.  During the study, a phone call will be conducted once per week , preferably midw ay 
between clinic visits,  to review current status of participant . 
Follow -Up Per iod: Follow -up visits will be conducted on an outpatient basis. Participants will continue 
to complete  questionnaires as indicated in Table 2  and will receive a phone call approximately 7 days 
after the last dose of IP (ie, Day 3 5) for safety monitoring. Participants will return to the study center for 
an end of study visit approxim ately 14 days following the last dose of IP (ie, Day 4 2). 
Number of Participants  (planned):  Approximately 60 participants, with approximately 30 per arm.

Investigati onal Product  Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
SAGE -324 (60 mg) or matched placebo oral tablets will be administered in the clinic or self -
administer ed once  daily , in the morning  with food  that comprises a minimum of 400 calories .  
Duration of Treatment:  
Each participant will receive a single dose of SAGE -324 oral tablet s or matching placebo administered 
once  daily for 28 days.   
Statistical Methods:  
A separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide a detailed description of the data analyses to be 
performed in the study. The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.  
General Considerations  
For the purpose of all efficacy and safety analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the last 
measurement prior to the start of IP administration.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each time point 
and summari zed descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will include counts and 
percentages.  
Analysis Sets  
The Randomized Set is defined as all participants who are randomized.  
The Safety Set will include all participants who were administered  IP.  
The Full Analysis Set will include all randomized participants who received any amount of IP and have 
a baseline and at least one postbaseline TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor score .  
 
 
The Per Protocol Set will include all participants in the F ull Analysis Set  without any major protocol 
deviations that could affect efficacy. The review of major protocol deviations will be completed, and 
the decision on whether the deviation affects efficacy will be documented before database unblinding.  
Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 3 -point difference in the change from 
baseline TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor scores  between  SAGE -324 and 
placebo with a standard deviation of 3.5 points. Under these assumptions, a sample size of 25 evaluable 
participants  per group would provide 85% power for detecting a placebo -adjusted treatment difference 
of 3 points in TETRAS performance subscale par t 4 upper limb tremor score , assuming a  2-sided test at 
an alpha  level  of 0.05. By including  2 treatment groups and using a 1:1 randomization, a total of 
50 evaluable participants  are required.  Assuming a nonevaluability rate of  15%, approximately 
60 participants  will be randomized.  Additional participants  may be enrolled if the drop -out rate is higher 
than 15%.  
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The estimand for the primary efficacy analysis is the treatment difference between SAGE -324 and 
placebo in me an change from baseline in clinic -based TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper limb 
tremor score at Day 2 9 based on the Full Analysis Set . This will be analyzed using a mixed -effects 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 3  CONFIDENTIAL  
11 model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline TETRAS 
performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor score , assessment timepoint, and timepoint -by-treatment 
as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables will be treated as fixed effects. All postbaseline 
clinic visits will be included in the model. The main comparison will be between SAGE -324 and 
placebo at the 2 9-day timepoint. Model -based point estimates (ie, least squares means, 95% confidence 
intervals, and p -values) will be reported where applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be 
used to model the within -subject errors. If there is a convergence issue with the unstructured covariance 
model, Toeplitz compound symmetry or Autoregressive (1) [AR(1)] covari ance structure will be used, 
following this sequence until convergence is achieved. If the model still does not converge with AR(1) 
structure, no results will be reported. When the covariance structure is not unstructured , the sandwich 
estimator for the va riance covariance matrix will be derived, using the EMPIRICAL option in the 
PROC MIXED statement in SAS.  
Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used to analy ze 
of the chan ge from baseline in TETRAS total performance score s, Kinesia ONE accelerometer scores  
and TETRAS ADL score s. Individual items of the TETRAS subscales will be summarized.  
Safety Analysis  
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by incidence of TEAEs /serious adverse events, 
Interim Analysis  
The sponsor may conduct an interim analysis . Detailed descriptions of planned  data analyses will be 
provided in a  separate interim statistical analysis plan (SAP) , if applicable .

23 5. INTRODUCTION  
SAGE -324 is a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of A -type γ -aminobutyric acid -gated 
chloride channel (GABA A) receptors, the major class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in 
the brain.  In addition to being developed as an adjunctive therapy in epilepsy and other seizure 
disorders  under IND 139201, SAGE -324 is also being developed for the treatment of Essential 
Tremor (ET).  
Essential tremor is a permanently debilitating, neurologically determined, common movement 
disor der characterized by involuntary rhythmic oscillation of a body part due to intermittent 
muscle contractions typically occurring when not at rest, thus interfering with fine motor skills 
associated with daily activities ( Olanow 2008 , Deuschl 2011 , Hopfner 2016, NIH 2019 ). 
Although the pathophysiology and etiology of ET is not fully understood, it is postulated that 
approximately 50% of ET patients feature an autosomal dominant pattern of familial inheritance 
and that non -inherited cases may have toxin -based  or other causality ( Olanow 2008 , Hopfner 
2016). ET is the most common movement disorder in the US, with prevalence estimated to be 
approximately 2.2% of the population, representing a substantial societal medical burden with 
over an estimated 7 million ET  patients in the US alone ( Louis 2014 ). 
In general, active tasks of daily life are adversely impacted by ET, including but not limited to 
speech, handwriting, household tasks, and occupational demands, contributing negatively to 
psychosocial well -being, ge neral anxiety, and overall quality of life  (Koller, 1989 ). Although 
benign in term of its effect on life expectancy, ET is a progressive neurodegenerative condition 
whose symptoms are typically disabling, often forcing patients to change jobs or seek early  
retirement ( Zappia, 2013 ). In some cases, serious disability may ensue.   
The pharmacological profile  of SAGE -324 is theorized to  induce therapeutic effect  in the 
treatment of ET. Based on preclinical studies of  SAGE -324, which features a different 
mechanism of action than that of propranolol, the pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamic (PD) 
profile suggests SAGE -324 may safely ameliorate symptoms in patients suffering from ET, 
regardless of propranolol use . 
There are current ly ongoing Phase 1 clinical studies of SAGE -324 in healthy adults  and in adults 
with ET . These studies , in addition to preclinical studies of SAGE -324, are detailed in the 
investigator’s brochure.  
With a GABA A receptor -based mechanism of action  featuring  positive allosteric modulation  
capability , SAGE -324 represents a novel approach to the treatment of ET, which may help 
address the unmet medical need of the ET population , warranting further study of SAGE -324 as 
a potential treatment for this common movement disorder.  
Henceforth, this double -blind, placebo -controlled efficacy and safety study of SAGE -324 will be 
conducted in adults  and is designed to assess the effect of SAGE -324 on a variety of outcome 
measures specific to ET disease characte ristics  and associate d quality of life  domains . 
5.1. Dose Justification  
The d ose of SAGE -324 planned for  this study  is 60 mg given as oral tablets, to be  administered 
once daily in the morning with food. Th e dose  was selected based on preliminary data from 
3 active studies of SAGE -324, which included : unblinded data from completed cohorts in 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 3  CONFIDENTIAL  
24 324-CLP-101 Part A (oral solution SAGE -324 doses of 3 mg, 10 mg, 30  mg, 45 mg, 60 mg) ; 
Part C (oral solution SAGE -324 doses of 30 mg) ; Part D (oral suspension SAGE -324 doses of 
30 mg) in healthy subjects ; and  preliminary data from open -label Part E (oral suspension 
SAGE -324 doses of 45 mg and 60 mg) in participants with ET; additional preliminary data from 
324-CLP-102 cohorts 1 through 6  (cohorts 1 to 5 unblinded, cohort 6 blinded) , which evaluated 
oral suspension doses ranging from 5 mg to 60 mg; and preliminary unblinded data from 
324-CLP-104, which compared the relative bioavailability of the oral tablet (30 mg) vs oral 
suspension (30 mg) formulations of SAGE -324 and separately the effect of food on the PK of the 
SAGE -324 oral tablet. In 324 -CLP-101 and 324 -CLP-102 studies, doses were administered in a 
fasted state. The preliminary data from all of these active studies collectively info rmed the route 
of administration (oral) and dose strength of 60 mg as oral tablets planned for further evaluation 
in this study .  
SAGE -324 was generally well -tolerated in participants with ET and in healthy volunteers, as was 
shown in the preliminary data of 324 -CLP-101 Part E at single administration doses of 45 mg 
and 60 mg, and in 324 -CLP-102 through once -daily administered doses of up to 60 mg  for 
14 days. In addition, tremor reduction was observed at both doses on TETRAS and Kinesia 
accelerometry, with greater improvement seen at 60  mg compared to 45  mg.  
In the clinically complete  study 324-CLP-104, preliminary data showed that SAGE -324 oral 
tablets, when coadministered with a meal, resulted in exposures approximately equivalent to t hat 
of SAGE -324 oral suspension under fasted conditions. Therefore, the SAGE -324 oral tablets are 
recommended to be administered with food.  
5.2. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Based on the mechanism of action of SAGE -324 and the results of completed nonclinical studies 
and preliminary data of currently ongoing clinical studies of SAGE -324, it is theorized that 
participants  may have  symptomatic ameliorat ion, ie, tremor reduction and possibly improved 
quality of life  from p otentially stabilizing disease characteristics associated with ET. 
Potential risks anticipated in this study are based on available data from toxicology studies of 
SAGE -324 in addition to preliminary data from 3 ongoing, currently active Phase 1 clinical 
studies of SAGE -324.  
Available preliminary clinical data are summarized in the SAGE -324 Investigator’s Brochure.  
There have been no deaths or SAEs  related to IP , and  based on the preliminary clinical data 
available , there have been  no confirmed  clinically significant trends in clinical laboratory 
evaluations, vital signs, or physical examinations.  
Based on available preliminary clinical data  from SAGE -324 active clinical studies , AEs of 
somnolence and feel ing of relaxation are considered adverse drug reactions.  In addition to 
scheduled clinic visits, the current status of study participants will be reviewed via weekly phone 
calls, in between clinic visits.

27 7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SAGE -324 in individuals with ET. Participants, site staff, and 
sponsor personnel will be masked to treatment allocation  (see Section  9.5). 
This study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 2 9-day treatment period consisting of 
28 days of dosing with the end of treatment visit  intended to be on Day 29 at trough , and a 
14-day follow -up period  relative to final dose  (Figure 1). After providing informed consent, 
participants will undergo screening assessments as outlined in Table 2  to determine eligibility .  
The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF). Eligible 
participants will visit the study center on Day 1 and complete additional eligibility assessments 
of safety and efficacy,  as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ). Following 
completion of screening and Day 1 eligibility checks, participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 
treatment groups ( SAGE -324 60 mg daily, or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio.   
During the double -blind Treatment Period, s tarting on Day 1, participants will receive a single 
dose of investigational product (IP) once daily in the morning with f ood for 28 days on an 
outpatient basis. Doses occurring on scheduled clinic visits will be administered in the clinic,  and 
doses occurring on all other days will be self -administered by the participant at home  as 
specified in Table 2 . During the Treatment Period, participants will return to the study center 
approximately once per week for efficacy and safety assessments as specified in  Table 2 . In 
addition, a phone call will be conducted once per week , preferably mid -way between clinic 
visits, to review current status of the participant.  
In addition to Kinesia ONE -specific training, c linical study center staff and study p articipants 
will be trained on the use of software applications and devices necessary to complete 
quest ionnaires or  other assessments as required.  During in-clinic visits, c linical study center staff 
will be available to assist participants as needed , to ensure they can  access and us e the software  
applications and devices  correctly according to the training . 
During the fo llow-up period, visits will be conducted on an outpatient basis. In addition to the 
phone calls to review current status, p articipants will receive a phone call approximately 7 days 
after the last dose of IP (ie, Day 35) for safety monitoring. Participants will return to the study 
center for an end of study visit approximately 14 days following the last dose of IP (ie, Day 42) .

28 7.2. Number of Participan ts 
Approximately 60 participants  are planned , with approximately 30 participants enrolled per arm , 
to produce 25 evaluable participants per arm  for primary efficacy  analysis . Additional 
participants may be randomized if the drop -out rate is higher than anticipated ( ie, >15%). 
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
Participants will be assigned to IP (active or placebo) in accordance with the randomization 
schedule on Day 1. Additional details on randomization and blinding  are provided in Section  9.5.  
7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria   
If participants report adverse events that are  considered by the investigator to be related to the IP 
and not tolerable , the investigator may reduce the dose of IP from 60 mg in 15 mg decrements 
(ie, 60 , to 45 , to 30 mg) , as medically appropriate . The dose may not be reduced below 30 mg: if 
intolerable adverse events persist at the 30 mg dose, the IP should be per manently stopped.  The 
reduced dose of IP will continue to be administered once daily at the same schedule as specified 
in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2). The dose of IP may not be increased for the remainder 
of the study .  
Otherwise, IP doses will not be further adjusted for this study except as clinically necessary , eg, 
interrupting dose due to an AE or serious adverse event ( SAE ) considered related to IP . 
7.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
Sage Therapeutics may terminate this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety 
reasons including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting unacceptable risk to 
participant s, or for administrative reasons . In the event of study termination, Sage Therapeutics 
will provide written notification to the investigator . Investigational sites must promptly notify 
their IRB, where required,  and initiate withdrawal procedures for participa ting participant s.

8.4.1.  Investigational Product  Discontinuation  
A participant may discontinue IP at any time at his/her own request for any reason. The 
investigator may discontinue a participant from IP for safety, behavioral, compliance, or 
administrative reasons. Participant s who discontinue IP will be encouraged by the investigator to 
remain on study and complete the EOT visit , the safety phone call 7 days later , and then , after a 
further 7 days,  the End of Study /Early Termination visit (EOS/ETV) , as specified in the 
Schedul e of Assessments ( Table 2). If the participant withdraw s consent to collect protected 
health information , the EOS/ETV will be conducted . 
The reason for IP discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s study r ecord and 
recorded in the participant’s electronic case report form (eCRF).  
The investigator must notify the sponsor and/or the medical monitor when a participant stops IP 
for any reason.  
Participant s who discontinue IP due to an AE, regardless of invest igator -determined causality, 
should be followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the investigator determines 
the event is no longer clinically significant.

324-ETD -201, Version 3  CONFIDENTIAL  
32 8.4.2.  Early Termination from the Study  
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request for any reason. 
The investigator may discontinue a participant from the study for safety, behavioral, compliance, 
or administrative reasons.  
The reason for early termination from the study must be documented in the participant’s study 
record and recorded in the participant’s electronic case report form (eCRF).  
The investigator must notify the sponsor and/or the medical monitor when a participa nt stops 
participation in the study for any reason.  
If a participant  is persistently noncompliant, the investigator should discuss with the sponsor the 
potential discontinuation of the participant . Any reasons for unwillingness or inability to adhere 
to the protocol must be recorded in the participant ’s eCRF, including:  
• missed visits;  
• interruptions in the schedule of study drug administration;

35 9.4. Treatment Adherence  
The first dose of IP will be received and administered by participants in the clinic . Participant s 
will be dispensed a  7-day supply of IP to orally self -administer  at home with instructions 
specifying to administer in the morning with food. Treatment adherence will be monitored by the 
site staff at each in-clinic visit  by direct questioning  and counting  returned tablets  and will be 
documented . Details on drug accountability are included in  Section  10.6. 
Patients will be asked to record the dates and times of their IP dose administrations  at home in a 
diary. They will also record details around how well they complied with the study instructions 
for self -administering IP at home . 
9.5. Randomization and Blinding  
This is a  randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study. Participants will be random ized in 
a 1:1 rat io to treatment group s (SAGE -324, 60 mg or placebo) . Participants, site staff, and the 
sponsor will be blinded to treatment allocation. Randomization schedules will be generated by an 
independent statistician . The randomization schedules will be kept stri ctly confidential, 
accessible only to authorized  personnel until the time of unblinding. The blinding of the study  
will be broken after the database has been locked.  
9.5.1.  Emergency Unblinding  
During the study, the blind is to be broken only when the safety of a participant  is at risk and the 
treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received. Unless a participant  is at immediate 
risk, the investigator should  make diligent attempts to c ontact Sage prior to unblinding the study 
treatment administered to a participant . Request s from the investigator about the treatment 
administered to study participant s should  be discussed with the Sage  Medical Monitor . If the 
unblinding occurs without Sag e’s knowledge, the investigator must notify Sage within 24 hours 
of breaking the blind. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly 
documented in the source records.  
In all cases where the IP allocation for a participant  is unblin ded, pertinent information 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the participant ’s records and on the 
eCRF.  
If a participant or any study personnel become unblinded to treatment, the participant will be 
excluded from the Per Protocol  analysis set, as detailed further in the statistical analysis plan.

39 11. EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  AND CLINICAL PHARMA COLOGY 
ASSESSMENTS  
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1.  The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale  
TETRAS is a validated , comprehensive clinical assessment of essential tremor  (Elble 2013).  
Three different components of TETRAS will be assessed in this study. The TETRAS ADL 
subscale, total performance score, and performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor  score  will 
each be separately assessed  at each clinic visit as specified in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2 ). 
The ADL subscale assesses how ET is impacting typical activities of daily living (ie, speech, 
eating, drinking, dressing, personal hygiene, writing, occupational impairment, social impact, 
and activities affected by upper limb tremor). It consists of 12 items that are  each rated on a scale 
from 0  (normal activity)  to 4 (severe abnormality) . The overall ADL score range is 0 to 48.  
The total performance score is based on overall rating  of tremor amplitude in the voice, limbs , 
head, face,  trunk, while performing pre -specified tasks, and also  measures functional task 
capabi lities, ie, handwriting, spirography,  and holding a pen over a dot . Each of these items is 
rated on a scale from 0  (no tremor) to 4 (severe tremor). Collectively, the performance items  
generate an  overall performance score from 0 to 64 .  
For the performanc e subscale part 4 upper limb tremor  score , all 3 maneuvers in the upper limb 
assessments  of part 4 (subscale items 4a, 4b, and 4c) will be completed for both arms, first for 
the left arm and then for the right . The part 4 subscale ordinally rates postural  (limbs extended 
forward  maneuver, and wing -beating  [elbows flexed] maneuver) , and kinetic  (finger -nose-finger 
maneuver)  tremor on a 0 to 4  severity scale  in 0.5 -point increments.  
In this study, a videographer  will video tape each TETRAS administration . 
11.1.2.  Kinesia ONE™ Accelerometer Score  
Kinesia ONE™ is an ISO -certified wireless motion sensor worn distally on the index finger, 
which utilizes 3 orthogonal accelerometers and 3 orthogonal gyroscopes to monitor 
3-dimensional mot ion. Data is transmitted wirelessly from the sensor to a Bluetooth technology -
enabled device to use with the Kinesia ONE software (eg,  Apple iPad or similar device with 
preinstalled Kinesia ONE software). The device has received FDA clearance.  
Via the Kine sia ONE software application, measures of 3-dimensional motion are converted to 
scores ranging from 0 to 4, per assessed maneuver; higher scores indicate greater tremor severity. 
Motion in both arms is captured.  
Participants will complete this assessment a t each clinic visit as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 2 ).

43 11.3. Other Patient -Reported Assessment s 
11.3.1.  Patient Perception of Res ponse Burden  
The Patient Perception of Response Burden Questionnaire is a patient -reported measure that 
assesses the multidimensional construct of response burden ( Atkinson 2019 ). 
Participants respond to 6 items assessing 1) how well the questions related to their actual 
concerns, 2) how comfortable the participants were with answering the questions, 3) how well 
the survey characterized their health and well -being, 4) the length of time to complete the 
questionnaires, 5) whether questions seemed unimportant  or repetitive, and 6) what additional 
information should have been gathered. Items 1 to 3 are assessed on a 0 to 10 scale, item 4 is 
assessed on a 1 to 3 scale, and items 5 and 6 are open -ended. Items 1 and 4 are reverse scored. A 
composite score can be c alculated to create a weighted representative index of relevance, 
comfort, and well -being relative to time to completion (ie, items 1, 2, and 3 were summed and 
multiplied by item 4) for a range of 0 to 72, with higher scores indicative of elevated endorsed  
response burden. The open -ended items will be summarized thematically. The Patient Perception 
of Response Burden Questionnaire will be performed as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 2 ).

All assessments will be conducted according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 ). 
12.1.1.  Demograph y and Medical History  
Demographic characteristics (age, race, sex, ethnicity) and a full medical history will be 
documented . Whether the participant is left -handed or right -handed will be recorded. This must  
also additionally include  participant  recall of history of  ET, disease duration, past treatments  
used, and responsiveness to  alcohol  and/or other treatments  with use intended  as off-label  
treatment  of ET (eg, primidone  or similar t herapies ). 
12.1.2.  Weight and Height  
Height and weight wi ll be measured and documented . Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated 
and documented.   
12.1.3.  Physical Examination  
Whenever possible, the  same individual should perform all physical examinations . Physical 
examinations will include assessment of body systems (eg, head, eye, ear, nose and throat; heart; 
lungs; abdomen; and extremities) as well as cognitive and neurological examination and MSE . 
Unscheduled physical examinations may also be conducted p er the Investigator’s discretion.  
Any abnormality in physical examinations will be interpreted by an investigator as abnormal, not 
clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) in source documents .  
12.1.4.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise  blood pressure and heart rate  (supine and standing) , respiratory rate, and 
temperature. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate are to be measured after the 
participant  has been supine for at least 5  minutes  and then repeated 1 minute and 3 m inutes after  
standing .  
Vital signs are measured once at each timepoint with the exception of predose on Day 1, when 
blood pressure and heart rate are measured supine and standing in triplicate at least 15 minutes 
apart . 
Any abnormality in vital signs will be interpreted by an Investigator as abnormal, NCS; or 
abnormal, CS in source documents . 
12.1.5.  Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed . The standard intervals (heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF ) 
as well as any rhythm abnormalities will be recorded.  
Electrocardiograms will be performed after the participant  has been resting in a supine position 
for at least 5 minutes. When ECG measurement s coincide with safety assessments, vital signs 
assessment or blood draws, procedures should be carried o ut in said order  (vital  signs , ECG, 
blood draw) .

48 • The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opinion of an 
Investigator, between the participant ’s consent to participate in the study and at the 
time of the procedure or treatment.  
12.2.3.  Definition of Adverse Events of Special Interest  
There are no kno wn adverse event s of special inter est as of the date of signature approval of this 
clinical protocol.  
12.2.4.  Relationship to Inves tigational Product  
The investigator must make the determination of relationship to the IP for each AE (not related, 
related ). The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the relationship of AEs 
and SAEs to the IP.  
Not Related  An AE will be considered “not rela ted” to the use of the IP if there is not a reasonable 
possibility  that the event has been caused by the IP. Factors pointing towards this 
assessment  include but are not limited to : the lack of temporal relationship between 
administration of the IP and the  event, the presence of biologically implausible 
relationship between the product and the AE, or the presence of a more likely 
alternative explanation for the AE  
Related  An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the IP if there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the product under investigation. 
Factors that point towards this assessment include but are not limited to: a positive 
rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administration of the drug and 
the eve nt, a known response pattern of the suspected drug, improvement following 
discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the 
drug and the AE, or a lack of alternative explanation for the AE  
12.2.5.  Recording Adverse Events  
AEs spontaneously reported by the participant  and/or in response to an open question from the 
study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational site . The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible . For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome  and seriousness  (if 
applicable), and whether or not it caused the participa nt to discontinue the IP or withdraw early 
from the study . 
Intensity will be asses sed according to the following scale:  
• Mild : symptom(s) barely noticeable to participant  or does not make participant  
uncomfortable; does not influence performance or function ing; prescription drug not 
ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s)  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 3  CONFIDENTIAL  
49 • Moderate : symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make participant  uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activity is influenced; participant  is able to continue in study; 
treatment for sym ptom(s) may be needed  
• Severe : symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or 
significant impact on participant ’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of 
treatment with IP; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or participant  
hospitalized   
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs . Severity is a measure  of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section  12.2.2 . An AE of severe intensity 
may not necessarily be  considered serious.  
12.2.6.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
In order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting an SAE(s), the study site 
must notify Sage or designee within 24 hours of the study site staff becoming aware of the 
SAE(s). The investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE repor t form , verify the accuracy 
of the information recorded on the SAE report form  with the corresponding source documents, 
and send a copy to  Sage or designee.  
Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Sage or designee  
within 24 hours  of receipt on a follow -up SAE report form  and placed with the original SAE 
information and kept with the appropriate section of the eCRF and/or study file.  
SAEs occurring after the designated follow up time for the study, should be reporte d to Sage or 
designee according to the timelines noted above only if the investigator considers the SAE 
related to IP.  
Sage , or designee,  is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events . It is the principal investigator’ s responsibility to notify the IRB/EC of all SAEs that occur 
at his or her site . Investigators will also be notified of all suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions  (SUSARs ) that occur during the clinical study. Each site is responsible for notifying  its 
IRB of all SUSARs .  
In addition, appropriate personnel in Sage  Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance or designee will 
unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regulatory reporting. Sage  or designee will submit SUSARs 
(in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies according to local law. Sage , or 
designee, will submit SUSAR s to investigators in a blinded fashion.  
12.3. Pregnancy  
If a participant  becomes pregnant after the first adminis tration of IP, pregnancy information must 
be collected and recorded on the pregnancy form  and submitted to the sponsor within 24  hours of 
learning of the pregnancy. Details will be collected for all  pregnancies for which conception was 
likely  to have occur red after the start of IP administration until 5 terminal half -lives following 
the last administration of IP or until the completion of the study whichever is longer . Any 
pregnancy occurring in that time frame will be followed until delivery or termination  of the 
pregnancy.  The investigator will also attempt to collect pregnancy information on any 
participant ’s partner who becomes pregnant after the participant has received the first 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 3  CONFIDENTIAL  
50 administration of IP . After obtaining the necessary signed informed consen t from the pregnan t 
partner directly, the investigator will follow the same pregnancy reporting procedures specified 
for pregnant participant s.  
The participant  or participant ’s partner will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. The outcome of all pregnancies ( eg, spontaneous abortion , elective abortion , normal 
birth) must be followed and documented even if the participant  was discontinued  from the study. 
The investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant  or partic ipant ’s partner and 
the neonate , and the information will be forwarded to Sage or designee. Generally, follow -up 
will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless  of fetal status (presence or absence of 
anomalies) or indication for the procedure . 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that a n IP may have 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Any complicat ion during 
pregnancy ( eg, anemia, infections, preeclampsia) should be reported as an AE/SAE. If the 
outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie,  
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death ), the investigator should follow the procedures 
for reporting an SAE.  
12.4. Overdose  
An overdose is any dose of study treatment given to a participant  or taken by a participant  that 
exceeds more than one extra tablet within 24 hours as described in protocol. Overdoses are not 
considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE on the eCRF; however , all overdoses must 
be recor ded on an overdose form and sent to Sage or d esignee within 24 hours of the site 
becoming aware of the overdose.  An overdose must be reported to Sage or designee even if the 
overdose does not result in an AE. If an overdose results in an AE, the AE must be recorded .

51 13. STATISTICS  
Detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study will be provided in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock. 
Any changes  or additions to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the 
clinical study report.  
13.1. Data Analysis Sets  
The Randomized Set will include all participants who are randomized.   
The Safety Set will include all participant s administered IP.  
The Full Analysis Set will include all randomized participant s who received any amount of IP 
and have a baseline and at least one postbaseline TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper 
limb tremor score .  
 
  
The Per Protocol Set will in clude  all participant s in the Full Analysis Set without any major 
protocol deviations that could affect efficacy. The review of major protocol deviations will be 
completed, and the decision on whether the deviation affects efficacy will be documented befor e 
database unblinding.  Note that a positive cotinine test on Days 1, 8, 15, 22 or 29 constitutes a 
major protocol deviation.  
13.2. Handling of Missing Data  
Every attempt will be made to avoid missing data . All participant s will be used in the analyses, 
as per the analysis populations, using all nonmissing data available . No imputation process will 
be used to estimate missing data .  
13.3. General Considerations  
All participant  data, including those that are derived, that support the tables and figures will be 
presente d in the participant  data listings. Some data may be presented only in participant  data 
listing, some may be presented with a corresponding table or figure; these will be indicated in 
relevant sections below. Participants will be summarized according to tr eatment received.  
For the purpose of all primary and secondary analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as 
the last measurement prior to receipt of IP.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimu m, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each 
time point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will 
include counts and percentages.  
13.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Dem ographic data, such as age, race, and ethnicity, and baseline characteristics, such as height, 
weight, and BMI, will be summarized using the Safety Set.  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 3  CONFIDENTIAL  
52 Pregnancy  test results and drug screen results will be listed but not summarized .  
Medical history wil l be listed by participant .  
13.5. Efficacy Analysis  
The estimand for the primary efficacy analysis is the treatment difference between SAGE -324 
and placebo in mean change from baseline in clinic -based TETRAS performance subscale part 4 
upper limb tremor  scores at Day 2 9 based on the Full Analysis Set . This will be analyzed using a 
mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline 
TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor score , assessment timepoint, and 
timepoint -by-treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables will be treated as 
fixed effects. All postbaseline clinic visits will be included in the model. The main comparison 
will be between SAGE -324 and placebo at the 2 9-day timepoint. Model -based point estimates 
(ie, least squares  means, 5% confidence intervals, and p -values) will be reported where 
applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -subject errors. 
If there is a con vergence issue with the unstructured covariance model, Toeplitz compound 
symmetry or Autoregressive (1) [AR(1)] covariance structure will be used, following this 
sequence until convergence is achieved. If the model still does not converge with AR(1) 
struct ure, no results will be reported. When the covariance structure is not UN, the sandwich 
estimator for the variance covariance matrix will be derived, using the EMPIRICAL option in 
the PROC MIXED statement in SAS.  
Similar to those methods described above fo r the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used for 
the analysis of the change from baseline in TETRAS total performance score s, Kinesia ONE 
accelerometer  scores  and TETRAS ADL score s.  
Other efficacy analyses will be specified in the SAP. In general, data wi ll be analyzed using 
appropriate descriptive statistics or prespecified statistical methods as applicable; participant  
listings will be provided for all efficacy data. Participant s will be analyzed according to 
randomized treatment for the purpose of effic acy unless otherwise specified.  
Sensitivity analyses will be described in the SAP. 
13.6. Safety Analyses  
Safety and tolerability of SAGE -324 will be evaluated by AEs, concomitant medication usage, 
 
 
 Safety data will be listed by participant  and summarized by treatment group . All 
safety summaries will be perf ormed on the Safety Set using treatment received.   
13.6.1.  Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 22.1 
or higher. A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE with onset after the 
first dose of IP. The analysis of AEs will be based on the concept of TEAEs. The incidence of 
TEAEs will be summarized by System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term. In addition, 
summaries will be provided by intensity (mild, moderate, severe) and by causality  (related, not 
related) to IP.  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 3  CONFIDENTIAL  
53 Any TEAEs leading to discontinuation of treatment or withdrawal from the study and any 
treatment -emergent SAEs  will be summarized.  
All AEs and SAEs (including those with onset or worsening before the start of IP) through th e 
end of the study will be listed.   
13.6.3.  Physical Examinations  
The occurrence of a physical examination , including MSE, (yes/no) and the date performed will 
be listed by participant . 
13.6.6.  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications will be recorded at each study visit during the study and wil l be coded using World 
Health Organization -Drug dictionary (WHO -DD) September 2015, or later .  
All medications taken within 30 days prior to informed consent through the duration of the study 
will be recorded. In addition, all psychotropic medications take n in the previous 30 days prior to 
screening will be recorded. Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the start of IP will 
be denoted “Prior”. Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the IP and continuing 
beyond the initiation of the IP or those medications started at the same time or after the initiation 
of the IP will be denoted “Concomitant”.  
Medications will be presented according to whether they are “Prior” or “Concomitant” as 
defined above. If medication dates are incomplete and it is not clear whether the medication was 
concomitant, it will be assumed to be concomitant.  
Details of prior and concomitant medications will be listed by participant , start date, and 
verbatim term.  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 3  CONFIDENTIAL  
54 13.8. Sample Size  and Power  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 3 points difference in the change 
from baseline TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor score  between 
SAGE -324 and placebo with a standard deviation of 3.5 points. Under these assum ptions, a 
sample size of 25 evaluable participants per group would provide 85% power for detecting a 
placebo -adjusted treatment difference of 3 points in TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper 
limb tremor score  assuming a 2 -sided test at an alpha level  of 0.05. By including 2 treatment 
groups and using a 1:1  randomization, a total of 50 evaluable participants are required. Assuming 
a nonevaluability rate of  15%, approximately  60 participants  will be randomized.  Additional 
participants may be enrolled if t he dropout rate is greater than 15%.  
13.8.1.  Interim and Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) Analys es 
13.8.1.1.  Interim Analysis  
The sponsor may conduct an interim analysis. Detailed description s of planned data analyses will 
be provided in a separate interim statistical analysis plan (SAP) , if applicable .

Before an investigational site can enter a participant  into the study, a representative of Sage 
Therapeutics will visit the investigational study site  per Sage SOPs  to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Sage Therapeutics  or its repres entatives . 
This will b e documented in a Clinical Trial  Agreement between Sage Therapeutics  and 
the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Sage Therapeutics  or representative will have regular contacts 
with the investigational site, for the followin g: 
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that IP accountabil ity checks are being 
performed  
• Perform source data verification . This includes a comparison of the data in the case report 
forms with the participant ’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records 
relevant to the study . This will require direct access to all original records for each 
participant  (eg, clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Sage Therapeutics . 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to Sage Therapeutics  and those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB or EC. 
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs  
information or advice.  
14.2. Audits and Inspect ions 
Sage Therapeutics or a uthorized representatives of Sage Therapeutics , a regulatory authority, or 
an independent E C or an I RB may visit the site to perform an audit (s) or inspection (s), including 
source data verification . The purpose of a  Sage Therapeu tics audit or a regulatory authority 
inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and 
documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, 
analyzed, and accurately reported accord ing to the protocol, GCP/ICH GCP guidelines , and any 
applicable regulatory requirements . The investigator should contact Sage Therapeutics

6 Study Description : 
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group  study to evaluate the efficacy, 
safety, and tolerability of SAGE -324 in individuals with ET. Participants, site staff, and sponsor 
personnel will be masked to treatment allocation.  
This study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 29-day treatment period  (28 days of dosing) , 
and a 14 -day follow up period. After providing informed consent, participants will undergo screening 
assessments as outlined in  Table 2  to determine eligibility.  
Screening Period: The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF). 
Eligible participants will visit the study center on Day 1 and complete additional eligibility  and baseline  
assessments, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 ). Following completion of screening  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
7 and Day 1  eligibility check s, participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups ( SAGE -324 60 
mg daily , or placebo) in a 1:1 r atio.   
Double -Blind Treatment Period: Starting on Day 1, participants will receive a single dose of 
investigational product (IP) once daily for  28 days on an outpatient basis , to be taken  in the morning 
with food that comprises a minimum of 400 calories. Doses occurring on scheduled clinic visits will be 
administered in the clinic, and doses occurring on all other days will be self-administered by the 
participant at home. During the Treatment Period, participants will return to the study center 
approximately once per week for efficacy and safety assessments as specified in  Table 2 . Participants 
will be trained on the use of software applications and devices necessary to complete questionnaires or 
other assessments.  During the study, a phone call will be conducted once per week, preferably midw ay 
between clinic visits,  to review current status of participant . 
Follow -Up Period:  Follow -up visits will be conducted on an outpatient basis. Participants will continue 
to complete  questionnaires as indicated in Table 2  and will receive a phone call approximately 7 days 
after the last dose of IP (ie, Day 3 5) for safety monitoring. Participants will return to the study center for 
an end of study visit approximately 14 days following the last dose of IP (ie, Day 4 2).

Investigational Product  Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
SAGE -324 (60 mg) or matched placebo oral tablets will be administered in the clinic or self -
administer ed once  daily , in the morning, at approximately the same time each day , with food  that 
comprises a minimum of 400 calor ies.  
Duration of Treatment:  
Each participant will receive a single dose of SAGE -324 o ral tablets or matching placebo administered 
once  daily for 28 days.   
Statistical Methods:  
A separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide a detailed description of the data analyses to be 
performed in the study. The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.  
General Considerations  
For the purpose of all efficacy and saf ety analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the last 
measurement prior to the start of IP administration.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from ba seline values will be calculated at each time point 
and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will include counts and 
percentages.  
Analysis Sets  
The Randomized Set is defined as all participants who are randomized.  
The Safety Set will include all participants who were administered IP.  
The Full Analysis Set will include all randomized participants who received any amount of IP and have 
a baseline and at least one postbaseline TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper lim b tremor score.  
 
The Per Protocol Set will include all participants in the F ull Analysis Set  without any major protocol 
deviations that could  affect efficacy. The review of major protocol deviations will be completed, and 
the decision on whether the deviation affects efficacy will be documented before database unblinding.  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
10 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 3-point difference in the change from 
baseline TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor scores between  SAGE -324 and 
placebo with a standard deviation of 3.5 points. Under these assumptions, a sample size of 25 evaluable 
participants  per group would provide 85% power for detecting a placebo -adjusted treatment difference 
of 3 points in TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor score , assuming a  2-sided test at 
an alpha  level of 0.05. By including  2 treatment groups and using a 1:1 randomization, a total of 
50 evaluable participants  are required.  Assuming a nonevaluability rate of  15%, approximately 
60 participants will be randomized.  Additional participants  may be enrolled if the drop- out rate is higher 
than 15%.  
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The estimand for the primary efficacy analysis is the treatment difference between SAGE -324 and 
placebo in mean change from baseline in clinic -based TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper limb 
tremor score at Day 2 9 based on the F ull Analysis Set . This will be analyz ed using a mixed -effects 
model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline TETRAS 
performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor score , assessment timepoint, and timepoint-by- treatment 
as explanatory variables. All explanatory v ariables will be treated as fixed effects. All postbaseline 
clinic visits will be included in the model. The main comparison will be between SAGE -324 and 
placebo at the 2 9-day timepoint. Model-based point estimates (ie, least squares means, 95% confidence 
intervals, and p -values) will be reported where applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be 
used to model the within -subject errors. If there is a convergence issue with the unstructured covariance 
model, Toeplitz compound symmetry or Autoregr essive (1) [AR(1)] covariance structure will be used, 
following this sequence until convergence is achieved. If the model still does not converge with AR(1) 
structure, no results will be reported. When the covariance structure is not unstructured , the sand wich 
estimator for the variance covariance matrix will be derived, using the EMPIRICAL option in the 
PROC MIXED statement in SAS.  
Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be us ed to analyze 
of the change from baseline in TETRAS total performance score s, Kinesia ONE accelerometer scores 
and TETRAS ADL score s. Individual items of the TETRAS subscales will be summarized.  
Safety Analysis  
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by incidence of TEAEs /serious adverse events, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Interim Analysis  
The sponsor may conduct an interim analysis . Detailed descriptions of planned  data analyses will be 
provided in a  separate interim statistical analysis plan (SAP), if applicable .

• The suggested order of assessments during clinic visits is: vital signs , TETRAS, Kinesia  ONE, ECG, blood sample collection for  and clinical 
laboratory assessments, and questionnaires . 
• All assessments will be performed predose  unless specified in a footnote . 
 
a Randomization  will occur on Day 1 after meeting all eligibility criteria.  
b Complete physical examinations (including MS E and comprehensive  neurologic examination) should be performed as specified and additionally as clinically 
necessary (see Section  12.1.3 ).  
c Predose on Day 1, supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate will be collected in triplicate a t least 15 minutes apart, measured after the participant has 
been in the supine position for at least 5 minutes and then repeated 1 minute and 3 minutes after standing. Respiratory rate and temperature are collected once 
predose on Day 1. Vital signs will be collected once predose at all other visits. All postdose vital signs will be collected once at approximately 3 hours (±60 
min) after dosing . 
d ECGs will be collected and read centrally. ECGs will be performed predose and approximately 3 hours  (±60 min)  postdose. All ECGs must be performed after 
the participant has been in a supine position for at least 5 minutes.

f Kinesia ONE will be assessed subsequently to TETRAS P erformance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor .  
g The TETRAS Performance and TETRAS ADL subscales will be assessed at Screening and predose at each cl inic visit. The TETRAS P erformance subscale 
part 4 upper limb tremor will be assessed before  Kinesia  ONE. In addition, on Day 15,  the TETRAS Performance  subscale will be assessed at 5 and 8 hours 
(±30 min) postdose . A videographer will record each TETRAS administration.  
h Participants will be trained by study personnel on the use of software applications , Investigational Product Diary,  and devices necessary for the conduct of the 
study.  
i Prior medications will be re corded during Screening and will include all medications and supplements  taken within the 30 days prior to signing the ICF  through 
the first dose of IP , as well as a complete history of all treatments for ET since the year of diagnosis . Concomitant medications will be recorded thereafter 
throughout the duration of the study.

22 5. INTRODUCTION
SAGE -324 is a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of A -type γ- aminobutyric acid -gated 
chloride channel (GABA A) receptors, the major class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in 
the brain. In addition to being developed as an adjunctive therapy in epilepsy and other seizure 
disorders under IND 139201, SAGE -324 is also being developed for the treatment of Essential 
Tremor (ET).  
Essential tremor is a permanently debilitating, neurologically determined, common movement disorder characterized by involuntary rhythmi c oscillation of a body part due to intermittent 
muscle contractions typically occurring when not at rest, thus interfering with fine motor skills 
associated with daily activities (Olanow 2008, Deuschl 2011, Hopfner 2016, NIH 2019).  
Although the pathophysiology and etiology of ET is not fully understood, it is postulated that 
approximately 50% of ET patients feature an autosomal dominant pattern of familial inheritance 
and that non- inherited cases may have toxin -based or other causality ( Olanow 2008, Hopfner 
2016). ET is the most common movement disorder in the US, with prevalence estimated to be 
approximately 2.2% of the population, representing a substantial societal medical burden with 
over an estimated 7 million ET patients in the US alone ( Louis 2014).  
In general, active tasks of daily life are adversely impacted by ET, including but not limited to 
speech, handwriting, household tasks, and occupational demands, contributing negatively to 
psychosocial well-being, general anxiety, and overall quality of life  (Koller, 1989). Although 
benign in term of its effect on life expectancy, ET is a progressive neurodegenerative condition 
whose symptoms are typically disabling, often forcing patients to change jobs or seek early 
retirement ( Zapp ia, 2013). In some cases, serious disability may ensue.   
The pharmacological profile of SAGE -324 is theorized to  induce therapeutic effect in the 
treatment of ET. Based on preclinical studies of  SAGE -324, which features a different 
mechanism of action than  that of propranolol, the pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamic (PD) 
profile suggests SAGE -324 may safely ameliorate symptoms in patients suffering from ET, 
regardless of propranolol use . 
There are currently ongoing Phase 1 clinical studies of SAGE -324 in healthy adults and in adults 
with ET . These studies, in addition to preclinical studies of SAGE -324, are detailed in the 
investigator’s brochure. 
With a GABA
A receptor -based mechanism of action  featuring  positive allosteric modulation  
capability , SAGE -324 represents a novel approach to the treatment of ET, which may help 
address the unmet medical need of the ET population, warranting further study of SAGE -324 as 
a potential treatment for this common movement disorder.  
Henceforth, this double -blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study of SAGE -324 will be 
conducted in adults and is designed to assess the effect of SAGE -324 on a variety of outcome 
measures specific to ET disease characteristics and associate d quality of life domains. 
5.1. Dose Justification  
The d ose of SAGE -324 planned for this study is 60 mg given as oral tablets, to be administered 
once daily in the morning with food. Th e dose w as selected based on preliminary data from 
3 active studies of SAGE -324, which included : unblinded data from completed cohorts in 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
23 324-CLP-101 Part A (oral solution SAGE -324 doses of 3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg, 60 mg); 
Part C (oral solution SAGE -324 doses of 30 mg); Part D (oral suspension SAGE -324 doses of 
30 mg) in healthy subjects ; and preliminary data from open- label Part E (oral suspension 
SAGE -324 doses of 45 mg and 60 mg) in participants with ET; additional preliminary data from 
324-CLP-102 cohorts 1 through 6 (cohorts 1 to 5 unblinded, cohort 6 blinded) , which evaluated 
oral suspension doses ranging from 5 mg to 60 mg; and preliminary unblinded data from 
324-CLP-104, which compared the relative bioavailability of the oral tablet (30 mg) vs oral 
suspension (30 mg) formulations of SAGE -324 and separately the effect of food on the PK of the 
SAGE -324 oral tablet. In 324- CLP-101 and 324- CLP-102 studies , doses were administered in a 
fasted state. The preliminary data from all of these active studies collectively informed the route 
of administration (oral) and dose strength of 60 mg as oral tablets planned for further evaluation 
in this study .  
SAGE -324 w as generally well -tolerated in participants with ET and in healthy volunteers, as was 
shown in the preliminary data of 324- CLP-101 Part E at single administration doses of 45 mg 
and 60 mg, and in 324- CLP-102 through once- daily administered doses of up to 60 mg for 
14 days. In addition, tremor reduction was observed at both doses on TETRAS and Kinesia ONE 
accelerometry, with greater improvement seen at 60  mg compared to 45 mg.  
In the clinically complete  study 324- CLP-104, preliminary data showed that SAGE -324 oral 
tablets, when coadministered with a meal, resulted in exposures approximately equivalent to that of SAGE -324 oral suspension under fasted conditions. Therefore, the SAGE -324 oral tablets are 
recommended to be admi nistered with food.  
5.2. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Based on the mechanism of action of SAGE -324 and the results of completed nonclinical studies 
and preliminary data of currently ongoing clinical studies of SAGE -324, it is theorized that 
participants  may have symptomatic amelioration, ie, tremor reduction and possibly improved 
quality of life from p otentially stabilizing disease characteristics associated with ET. 
Potential risks anticipated in this study are based on available data from toxicology studies of SAGE -324 in addition to preliminary data from 3 ongoing, currently active Phase 1 clinical 
studies of SAGE -324.  
Available preliminary clinical data are summarized in the SAGE -324 Investigator’s Brochure.  
There have been no deaths or SAEs related to IP , and based on the preliminary clinical data 
available, there have been  no confirmed  clinically significant trends in clinical laboratory 
evaluations, vital signs, or physical examinations.  
Based on available preliminary clinical data from SAGE -324 active clinical studies, AEs of 
somnolence and feeling of relaxation are considered advers e drug reactions.  In addition to 
scheduled clinic visits, the current status of study participants will be reviewed via weekly phone 
calls, in between clinic visits.

26 7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
7.1. Overall Study Design
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SAGE -324 in individuals with ET. Participants, site staff, and 
sponsor personnel will be masked to treatment allocation  (see Section  9.5). 
This study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 29-day treatment period consisting of 28 days of dosing with the end of treatment visit intended to be on Day 29 at trough, and a 14-day follow-up period relative to final dose  (Figure 1) . After providing informed consent,
participants will undergo screening assessments as outlined in  Table 2  to determine eligibility .
The Screening Perio d begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF). Eligible 
participants will visit the study center on Day 1 and complete additional eligibility assessments 
of safety and efficacy, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 ). Following 
completion of screening and Day 1 eligibility checks, participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 
treatment groups (SAGE -324 60 mg daily, or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio.   
During the double-blind T reatment Period, s tarting on Day 1, participants will receive a single 
dose of investigational product (IP) once daily in the morning with food for 28 days on an 
outpatient basis (see Section  10.5) . Doses occurring on scheduled clinic visits will be 
administered in the clinic,  and doses occurring on all other days will be self -administered by the 
participant at home as specified in  Table 2. During the T reatment Period, participants will return 
to the study center approximately once per week for efficacy and safety assessments as specified 
in Table 2 . In addition, a phone call will be conducted once per week , preferably mid -way 
between clinic visits, to review current status of the participant.  
In addition to Kinesia ONE- specific training, c linical study center staff and study p articipants 
will be trained on the use of software applications and devices necessary to complete 
questionnaires or other assessments as required.  During in -clinic visits, clinical study center staff 
will be available to assist participants as needed , to ensure they can  access and use the software  
applications and devices  correctly according to the training . 
During the follow -up period, visits will be conducted on an outpatient basis. In addition to the 
phone calls to review current status, participants will receive a phone call approximately 7 days 
after the last dose of IP (ie, Day 35) for safety monitoring. Participants will return to the study 
center for an end of study visit approximately 14 days following the last dose of IP (ie, Day 42).

27 7.2. Number of Participants 
Approximately 60 participants  are planned , with approximately 30 participants enrolled per arm, 
to produce 25  evaluable participants per arm  for primary efficacy  analysis. Additional 
participants may be randomized if the drop-out rate is higher than anticipated (ie, >15 %). 
7.3. Treatment Assignment 
Participants will be assigned to IP  (active or placebo) in accordance with the randomization 
schedule on Day 1. Additional details on randomization and blinding are provided in Section  9.5.  
7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
If participants report adverse events that are considered by the investigator to be related to the IP 
and not tolerable , the investigator may reduce the dose of IP from 60 mg in 15 mg de crements 
(ie, 60, to 45, to 30 mg), as medically appropriate. The dose may not be reduced below 30 mg: if 
intolerable adverse events persist at the 30 mg dose, the IP should be per manently stopped. The 
reduced dose of IP will continue to be administered once daily at the same schedule as specified 
in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 ). The dose of IP may not be increased for the remainder 
of the study.  
Otherwise, IP doses will not be further adjusted for this study except as clinically necessary , eg, 
interrupting dose due to an AE or serious adverse event ( SAE ) considered related to IP . 
7.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
Sage Therapeutics may terminate this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety reasons including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting unacceptable risk to 
participant s, or for administrative reasons . In the event of study termination, Sage Therapeutics 
will provide written notification to the investigator. Investigational sites must promptly notify 
their IRB, where required, and initiate withdrawal procedures for participa ting participants.

324-ETD -201, Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
31 The reason for early termination from the study must be documented in the participant’s study 
record and recorded in the participant’s electronic case report form (eCRF).  
The investigator must notify the sponsor and/or the m edical monitor when a participant stops 
participation in the study for any reason.  
If a participant is persistently noncompliant, the investigator should discuss with the sponsor the 
potential discontinuation of the participant. Any reasons for unwillingness or inability to adhere 
to the protocol must be recorded in the participant’s eCRF, including: 
• missed visits;  
• interruptions in the schedule of study drug administration; 
• non-permitted medications  
If the participant withdraws from the study after completing 28 days of dosing with IP, they will 
be encouraged to attend follow -up visits for safety assessments at Day 35 and Day 42 , as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 ). If the participant withdraw s their consent to 
collect protected health information , the EOS/ETV  visit will be conducted and t he participant 
will be permanently discontinued from the study at that time . 
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor will retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
If a participant withdraws from the stu dy, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken 
and not tested, and the i nvestigator must document this in the site study records.  
8.4.3. Loss to Follow- up

9.3. Intervention after the End of the Study  
There is n o planned intervention following the end of the study. 
9.4. Treatment Adherence  
The first dose of IP  will be received  and administered by participants in the clinic . Participants 
will be dispensed a 7-day supply of IP  to orally self- administer  at home with instructions 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
34 specifying to administer in the morning with food. Treatment adherence will be monitored by the 
site staff at each in -clinic visit by direct questioning and counting returned tablets  and will be 
documented. Details on drug accountability are included in Section  10.6.  
Patients will be asked to record the dates and times of their IP dose administrations at home in a 
diary. They will also record details around how well they complied with the study instructions 
for self-administering IP  at home. 
9.5. Randomization and Blinding 
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants will be randomized in 
a 1:1 ratio  to treatment group s (SAGE -324, 60 mg  or placebo). Participants, site staff, and the 
sponsor will be blinded to treatment allocation. Randomization schedules will be generated by an 
independent statistician . The randomization schedules will be kept strictly confidential, 
accessible only to authorized  pers onnel until the time of unblinding. The blinding of the study 
will be broken after the database has been locked.  
9.5.1. Emergency Unblinding  
During the study, the blind is to be broken only when the safety of a participant  is at risk and the 
treatment plan is de pendent on the study treatment received. Unless a participant is at immediate 
risk, the investigator should make diligent attempts to contact Sage prior to unblinding the study 
treatment administered to a participant. R equest s from the investigator about the treatment 
administered to study participant s should be discussed with the Sage  Medical Monitor . If the 
unblinding occurs without Sage’s knowledge, the investigator must notify Sage within 24 hours of breaking the blind. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly 
documented in the source records.  
In all cases where the IP allocation for a participant is unblinded, pertinent information 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the participant’s records and on the 
eCRF.  
If a participant or any study personnel become unblinded to treatment, the participant will be 
excluded from the Per Protocol analysis set, as detailed further in the statistical analysis plan.

will be kept in the study files.  
The designated site staff will dispense the supplied participant -specific kits to participants at the 
planned dispensation visit intervals outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ). 
An interactive response technology (IRT) will be used to capture participant- identifying 
information. The IRT will be used to randomize the eligible participant into the study and 
provides the kit number of the IP to be dispensed to that participant.  
If dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered by site staff or sponsor’s designee, the 
sponsor must be notified immediately. The IP provided is for use only as directed in this protocol. The investigator or designee must 
keep a record of all IP  received, used and returned/discarded.  
Sage Therapeutics will be permitted access to the study supplies at any time with appropriate 
notice during or after completion of the study to perform drug accountability reconciliation.  The investigator, pharmacist, or qualified designee is responsible for drug accountability, 
reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). At the end of the study, any unused IP  tablets will be returned to Sage Therapeutics for 
destruction or destroyed locally per the site’s procedures ; disposition of IP will be  documented. 
IP may not be destroyed until accountability and reconciliation procedures have been completed 
and monitored. 
10.7. Product Complaints

38 11. EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
ASSESSMENTS  
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1. The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale 
TETRAS is a validated , comprehensive clinical assessment of essential tremor  (Elble 2013).  
Three different components of TETRAS will be assessed in this study. The TETRAS ADL 
subscale, total performance score, and performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor  score will 
each be separately assessed  at each clinic visit as specified in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2 ). 
The ADL subscale assesses how ET is impacting typical activities of daily living (ie, speech, 
eating, drinking, dressing, personal hygiene, writing, occupational impairment, social impact, 
and activities affected by upper limb tremor). It consists of 12 items that are  each  rated on a scale 
from 0  (normal activity)  to 4 (severe abnormality). The overall ADL score range is 0 to 48. 
The total performance score is based on overall rating  of tremor amplitude in the voice, limbs , 
head, face,  trunk, while performing pre -specified tasks, and also  measures functional task 
capabilities, ie, handwriting, spirography, and holding a pen over a dot. Each of these items is 
rated on a scale from 0  (no tremor) to 4 (severe tremor). Collectively, the performance items  
generate an  overall performance score from 0 to 64 .  
For the performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor  score, a ll 3 maneuvers in the upper limb 
assessments of part 4 ( subscale items 4a, 4b, and 4c) will be completed for both arms, first for 
the right arm and then for the left. The part 4 subscale ordinally rates postural  (limbs extended 
forward  maneuver, and wing -beating  [elbows flexed] maneuver), and kinetic (finger-nose-finger 
maneuver) tremor on a 0 to 4  severity scale in 0.5- point increments.  
In this study, a videographer will videotape each TETRAS administration . 
11.1.2. Kinesia ONE™ Accelerometer Score 
Kinesia ONE™ is an ISO -certified wireless motion sensor worn distally on the index finger, 
which utilizes 3 orthogonal accelerometers and 3 orthogonal gyroscopes to monitor 3-dimensional motion. Data is transmitted wirelessly from the sensor to a Bluetooth technology -
enabled device to use with the Kinesia ONE software (eg,  Apple iPad or similar device with 
preinstalled Kinesia ONE software). The device has received FDA clearance.  
Via the Kinesia ONE software application, measures of 3-dimensional motion are converted to 
scores ranging from 0 to 4, per assessed maneuver; higher scores indicate greater tremor severity. Motion in both arms is captured. 
Participants will complete this assessment at each clinic visit as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table 2 ).

42 11.3. Other Patient- Reported Assessment s 
11.3.1. Patient Perception of Response Burden  
The Patient Perception of Response Burden Questionnaire is a patient -reported measure that 
assesses the multidimensional construct of response burden ( Atkinson 2019).  
Participants r espond to 6 items assessing 1) how well the questions related to their actual 
concerns, 2) how comfortable the participants were with answering the questions, 3) how well 
the survey characterized their health and well -being, 4) the length of time to comple te the 
questionnaires, 5) whether questions seemed unimportant or repetitive, and 6) what additional 
information should have been gathered. Items 1 to 3 are assessed on a 0 to 10 scale, item 4 is 
assessed on a 1 to 3 scale, and items 5 and 6 are open -ended. Items 1 and 4 are reverse scored. A 
composite score can be calculated to create a weighted representative index of relevance, 
comfort, and well-being relative to time to completion (ie, items 1, 2, and 3 were summed and 
multiplied by item 4) for a range of 0 to 72, with higher scores indicative of elevated endorsed 
response burden. The open- ended items will be summarized thematically. The Patient Perception 
of Response Burden Questionnaire will be performed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 ).

43 12. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
12.1. Safety Parameters  
All assessments will be conducted according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 ). 
12.1.1. Demograph y and Medical History  
Demographic characteristics (age, race, sex, ethnicity) and a full medical history will be 
documented. Whether the participant is left -handed or right-handed w ill be recorded. This must 
also additionally include pa rticipant  recall of history of ET, disease duration, past treatments  
used, and responsiveness to alcohol and/ or other treatments  with use intended as off- label  
treatment of ET (eg, primidone or similar therapies). 
12.1.2. Weight and Height  
Height and weight wi ll be measured and documented . Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated 
and documented.  
12.1.3. Physical Examination  
Whenever possible, the same individual should perform all physical examinations . Phy sical 
examinations will include review  of systems (eg, head, eye, ear, nose and throat; heart; lungs; 
abdomen; and extremities) as well as comprehensive neurological examination and MSE. 
Unscheduled physical examinations may also be conducted per the Inves tigator’s discretion.  
Any abnormality in physical examinations will be interpreted by an investigator as abnormal, not 
clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) in source documents .  
12.1.4. Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise blood pressure and heart rate  (supine and standing) , respiratory rate, and 
temperature. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate are to be measured after the 
participant  has been supine for at least 5  minutes  and then repeated 1 minute and 3 minutes after 
standing.  
Vital signs are measured once at each timepoint with the exception of predose on Day 1, when 
blood pressure and heart rate are measured supine and standing in triplicate at least 15 minutes apart . 
Any abnormality in vital signs will be interpreted by an Investigator as abnormal, NCS; or abnormal, CS in source documents. 
12.1.5. Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed . The standard intervals (heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF ) 
as well as any rhythm abnormalities will be recorded.  
Electrocardiograms will be performed after the participant  has been resting in a supine position 
for at least 5 minutes. When ECG measurement s coincide with safety assessments, vital signs 
assessment or blood draws, procedures should be carried out in said order (vital signs , ECG, 
blood draw). 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL

47 • The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opinion of an 
Investigator, between the participant ’s consent to participate in the study and at the 
time of the procedure or treatment.  
12.2.3. Definition of Adverse Events of Special Interest  
There are no known adverse events of special inter est as of the date of signature approval of this 
clinical protocol.  
12.2.4. Relationship to Investigational Product 
The investigator must make the determination of relationship to the IP for each AE (not related, 
related ). The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the relationship of AEs 
and SAEs to the IP .  
Not Related  An AE will be considered “not related” to the use of the IP if there is not a reasonable 
possibility that the event has been caused by the IP. Factors pointing towards this 
assessment  include but are not limited to : the lack of temporal relationship between 
administration of the IP and the  event, the presence of biologically implausible 
relationship between the product and the AE, or the presence of a more likely 
alternative explanation for the AE 
Related  An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the IP if there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the product under investigation. 
Factors that point towards this assessment include but are not limited to: a positive rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administration of the drug and 
the event, a known response pattern of the suspected drug, improvement following discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the 
drug and the AE, or a lack of alternative explanation for the AE  
12.2.5. Recording Adverse Events  
AEs spontaneously reported by the participant  and/or in response to an open question from the 
study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational site. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology  when 
possible. For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome and seriousness (if 
applicable), and whether or not it caused the participant to discontinue the IP  or withdraw early 
from the study . 
Intensity will be assessed  according to the following scale: 
• Mild : symptom(s) barely noticeable to participant  or does not make participant 
uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not 
ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s)  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
48 • Moderate: symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make participant uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activity is influenced; participant  is able to continue in study; 
treatment for symptom(s) may be needed  
• Severe: symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or 
significant impact on participant’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of 
treatment with IP; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or participant 
hospitalized   
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs . Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section  12.2.2. An AE of severe intensity 
may not necessarily be considered serious.  
12.2.6. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
In order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting an SAE(s), the study site must notify Sage or designee within 24 hours of the study site staff becoming aware of the 
SAE(s). The investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE report form, verify the accuracy 
of the information recorded on the SAE report form with the corresponding source documents, 
and send a copy to Sage or designee.  
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should all be sent  to Sage or designee 
within 24 hours of receipt on a follow -up SAE report form and placed with the original SAE 
information and kept with the appropriate section of the eCRF and/or study file. 
SAEs occurring after the designated follow up time for the study, should be reported to Sage or 
designee according to the timelines noted above only if the i nvestigator considers the SAE 
related to IP .  
Sage , or designee, is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events. It is the principal investigator’s resp onsibility to notify the IRB/EC of all SAEs that occur 
at his or her site . Investigators will also be notified of all suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions  (SUSARs ) that occur during the clinical study. Each site is responsible for notifying its 
IRB of all  SUSARs .  
In addition, appropriate personnel in Sage  Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance or designee will 
unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regulatory reporting. Sage  or designee will submit SUSARs 
(in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory age ncies according to local law. Sage , or 
designee, will submit SUSARs to i nvestigators in a blinded fashion. 
12.3. Pregnancy 
If a participant becomes pregnant after the first administration of IP , pregnancy information must 
be collected and recorded on the pregnancy form and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy. Details will be collected for all pregnancies for which conception was 
likely  to have occurr ed after the start of IP administration until 5 terminal half- lives following 
the last administration of IP  or until the completion of the study whichever is longer. Any 
pregnancy occurring in that time frame will be followed until delivery or termination of the 
pregnancy. The investigator will also attempt to collect pregnancy information on any 
participant ’s partner who becomes pregnant after the participant has received the first 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
49 administration of IP . After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant 
partner directly, the investigator will follow the same pregnancy reporting procedures specified 
for pregnant participant s.  
The participant  or participant ’s partner will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. The outcome of all preg nancies ( eg, spontaneous abortion, elective abortion, normal 
birth) must be followed and documented even if the participant was discontinued from the study. 
The investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant  or participant’s partner and 
the neonate, and the information will be forwarded to Sage or designee. Generally, follow-up 
will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimat ed delivery date. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of 
anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an IP  may have 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Any complication during 
pregnancy ( eg, anemia, infections, preeclampsia) should be reported as an AE/SAE. If the 
outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SA E (ie,  
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death), the investigator should follow the procedures 
for reporting an SAE.  
12.4. Overdose 
An overdose is any dose of IP  given to a participant or taken by a participant that exceeds the 
dose described in the protocol. Overdoses are not considered AEs and should not be recorded as 
an AE on the e CRF; however, all overdoses must be recor ded on an overdose form and sent to 
Sage or designee within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the overdose. An overdose must be reported to Sage or designee even if the overdose does not result in an AE. If an overdose 
results in an AE, the AE must be recorded .

50 13. STATISTICS  
Detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study will be provided in the 
statistical  analysis plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock. 
Any changes or additions to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the 
clinical study report. 
13.1. Data Analysis Sets  
The Randomized Set will include all participants who are randomized.  
The Safety Set will include all participants administered IP.  
The Full Analysis Set will include all randomized participant s who received any amount of IP  
and have a baseline and at least one postbaseline TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper 
limb tremor score.  
 
 
The Per Protocol Set will include all participant s in the Full Analysis Set without any major 
protocol deviations that could affect efficacy. The review of major protocol deviations will be completed, and the decision on whether the deviation affects efficacy will be documented before database unblinding. Note that a positive cotinine te st on Days 1, 8, 15, 22 or 29 constitutes a 
major protocol deviation.  
13.2. Handling of Missing Data  
Every attempt will be made to avoid missing data . All participant s will be used in the analyses, 
as per the analysis populations, using all nonmissing data available. No imputation process will be used to estimate missing data .  
13.3. General Considerations  
All participant data, including those that are derived, that support the tables and figures will be 
presented in the participant data listings. Some data may be presented only in participant data listing, some may be presented with a corresponding table or figure; these will be indicated in 
relevant sections below. Participants will be summarized according to treatment received.  
For the purpose of all primary and secondary analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to receipt of IP .  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each time point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will 
include counts and percentages. 
13.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic data, such as age, race, and ethnicity, and baseline characteristics, such as height, weight, and BMI, will be summarized using the Safety Set .  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
51 Pregnancy test  results and drug screen results will be listed but not summarized .  
Medical history will be listed by participant .  
13.5. Efficacy Analysis  
The estimand for the primary efficacy analysis is the treatment difference between SAGE -324 
and placebo in mean cha nge from baseline in clinic -based TETRAS performance subscale part 4 
upper limb tremor  scores at Day 2 9 based on the Full Analysis Set. This will be analyzed using a 
mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline 
TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor score, assessment timepoint, and 
timepoint- by-treatment as explanatory variable s. All explanatory variables will be treated as 
fixed effects. All postbaseline clinic visits will be included in the model. The main comparison will be between SAGE -324 and placebo at the 29-day timepoint. Model- based point estimates 
(ie, least squares me ans, 5% confidence intervals, and p- values) will be reported where 
applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within- subject errors. 
If there is a convergence issue with the unstructured covariance model, Toeplitz compound symmetry or Autoregressive (1) [AR(1)] covariance structure will be used, following this 
sequence until convergence is achieved. If the model still does not converge with AR(1) structure, no results will be reported. When the covariance structure is not UN,  the sandwich 
estimator for the variance covariance matrix will be derived, using the EMPIRICAL option in 
the PROC MIXED statement in SAS.  
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used for 
the analysis of the chang e from baseline in TETRAS total performance score s, 
Kinesia ONE 
accelerometer  scores  and TETRAS ADL score s.  
Other efficacy analyses will be specified in the SAP. In general, data will be analyzed using 
appropriate descriptive statistics or prespecified statistical methods as applicable; participant  
listings will be provided for all efficacy data. Participants will be analyzed according to randomized treatment for the purpose of efficacy unless otherwise specified.  
Sensitivity analyses will be described in the S AP. 
13.6. Safety Analyses  
Safety and tolerability of SAGE -324 will be evaluated by AE s, concomitant medication usage, 
 
Safety data will be listed by participant  and summarized by treatment group . All 
safety summaries will be performed on the Safety Set using treatment received.   
13.6.1. Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 22.1 
or higher. A treatment- emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE with onset after the 
first dose of IP . The analysis of AEs  will be based on the concept of TEAEs. The incidence of 
TEAEs will be summarized by System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term. In addition, 
summaries will be provided by intensity (mild, moderate, severe) and by causality (related, not related) to IP.  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
52 Any TEAEs leading to discontinuation of treatment or withdrawal from the study and any 
treatment- emergent SAEs  will be summarized.  
All AEs and SAEs (including those with onset or worsening before the start of IP ) through the 
end of the study will be listed.  
  
 
 
 
  
13.6.3. Physical Examinations  
The occurrence of a physical examination , including MSE, (yes/no) and the date performed will 
be listed by participant . 
13.6.6. Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Medications will be recorded at each study visit during the study and will be coded using World Health Organization -Drug dictionary (WHO -DD) September 2015, or later .  
All medications taken within 30 days prior to informed consent through the duration of the study 
will be recorded. In addition, all psychotropic medications taken in the previous 30 day s prior to 
screening will be recorded. Those medications taken prior to the ini tiation of the start of IP  will 
be denoted “Prior”. Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the IP and continuing 
beyond the initiation of the IP  or those medications started at the same time or after the initiation 
of the IP  will be denoted “Concomitant”.  
Medications will be presented according to whether they are “Prior” or “Concomitant” as defined above. If medication dates are incomplete and i t is not clear whether the medication was 
concomitant, it will be assumed to be concomitant.  
Details of prior and concomitant medications will be listed by participant, start date, and 
verbatim term.  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
53 13.8. Sample Size  and Power 
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 3 points difference in the change 
from baseline TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor score  between 
SAGE -324 and placebo with a standard deviation of 3.5 points. Under these assumptions, a 
sample size of 25 evaluable participants per group would provide 85% power for detecting a 
placebo -adjusted treatment difference of 3 points in TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper 
limb tremor score assuming a 2- sided test at an alpha level  of 0.05. By including 2 treatment 
groups and using a 1:1 randomization, a total of 50 evaluable participants are required. Assuming 
a nonevaluability rate of 15%, approximately  60 participants  will be randomized.  Additional 
participants may be enrolled if the dropout rate is greater than 15%. 
13.8.1. Interim and Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) Analyses 
13.8.1.1. Interim Analysis  
The sponsor may conduct an interim analysis. Detailed descriptions of planned data analyses will

14.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a participant into the study, a representative of Sage 
Therapeutics will visit the investigational study site  per Sage SOPs  to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Sage Therapeutics or its representatives . 
This will be documented in a Clinical Trial Agreement between Sage Therapeutics and 
the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Sage Therapeutics or representative will have regular contacts 
with the investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being  
accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that IP accountability checks are being 
performed  
• Perform source data verification . This includes a comparison of the data in the case report 
forms with the participant’s medical records at the hospital or  practice, and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each 
participant  (eg, clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Sage Therapeutics. 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any SAEs have been forwarded to Sage Therapeutics and those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB or EC. 
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Sage Therapeutics or authorized representatives of Sage Therapeutics, a regulatory authority, or an independent EC or an IRB may visit the site to perform an audit(s) or inspection(s), including 
source data verification . The purpose of a Sage Therapeutics audit or a regulatory authority 
inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study- related activities an d 
documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, 
analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP/ICH GCP guidelines , and any 
applicable regulatory requirements . The investigator should contact Sage Therapeutics

7 Study Description : 
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group  study to evaluate the efficacy, 
safety, and tolerability of SAGE -324 in individuals with ET. Participants, site staff, and sponsor 
personnel will be masked to treatment allocation.  
This study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 29-day treatment period  (28 days of dosing) , 
and a 14 -day follow up period. After providing informed consent, participants will undergo screening 
assessments as outlined in Table 2  to determine eligibility.  
Screening Period: The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF). 
Eligible participants will visit the study center on Day 1 and complete additional eligibility  and baseline  
assessments, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ). Following completion of screening 
and Day 1  eligibility check s, participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups ( SAGE -324 60 
mg daily , or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio.   
Double -Blind Treatment Period: Starting on Day 1, participants will receive a single dose of 
investigational product (IP) once daily for  28 days on an outpatient basis , to be taken  in the morning 
with food that comprises a minimum of 400 calories . Doses occurring on scheduled clinic visits will be 
administered in the clinic, and doses  occurring on all other days will be self-administered by the 
participant at home. During the Treatment Period, participants will return to the study center 
approximately once per week for efficacy and safety assessments as specified in  Table 2 . Participants 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 5 CONFIDENTIAL  
8 will be trained on the use of software applications and devices necessary to complete questionnaires or 
other assessments.  If on Day 1 or at any point during the treatment period participants experience 
moderate or severe AEs of somnolence, drowsiness, dizziness or similar, or have these events at any 
severity with associated symptoms such as confusion or balance impairment, they must have a dose 
interruption (drug holiday) of at l east 1 day (missing at least 1 dose). Following a drug holiday, the dose 
of study drug must then be reduced by 15 mg decrements to tolerability ( ie, from 60  mg to 45 mg to 
30 mg). The dose of IP may not be increased for the remainder of the study.  At the i nvestigator’s 
discretion, participants unable to tolerate the 30  mg dose may be discontinued from study drug. During 
the study, a phone call will be conducted at least once per week , preferably midw ay between clinic 
visits,  or as deemed appropriate by  the investigator, to review the current status of the participant .   
Follow -Up Period:  Follow -up visits will be conducted on an outpatient basis. Participants will continue 
to complete  questionnaires as indicated in Table 2  and will receive a phone call approximately 7 days 
after the last dose of IP (ie, Day 3 5) for safety monitoring. Participants will return to the s tudy center for 
an end of study  (EOS) v isit approximately 14 days following the last dose of IP (ie, Day 42).

Investigational Product  Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
SAGE -324 (60 mg) or matched placebo oral tablets will be administered in the clinic or self -
administer ed once  daily , in the morning, at approximately the same time each day , with food  that 
comprises a minimum of 400 calories .  
Duration of Treatment:  
Each participant will receive a single dose of SAGE -324 o ral tablets or matching placebo administered 
once  daily for 28 days.   
Statistical Methods:  
A separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide a detailed description of the data analyses to be 
performed in the study. The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.  
General Considerations  
For the purpose of all efficacy and safety analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the last 
measurement prior to the start of IP admini stration.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each time point 
and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoint s, descriptive summaries will include counts and 
percentages.  
Analysis Sets  
The Randomized Set is defined as all participants who are randomized.  
The Safety Set will include all participants who were administered IP.  
The Full Analysis Set will include all randomized participants who received any amount of IP and have 
a baseline and at least one postbaseline TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor score.  
 
The Per Protocol Set will include all participants in the F ull Analysis Set  without any major protocol 
deviations that could affect efficacy. The review of major protocol deviations will be com pleted, and 
the decision on whether the deviation affects efficacy will be documented before database unblinding.  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 5 CONFIDENTIAL  
11 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 3 -point difference in the change from 
baseline TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor scores between  SAGE -324 and 
placebo with a standard deviation of 3.5 points. Under these assumptions, a sample size of 25 evaluable 
participants  per group would provide 85% power for detecting a placebo -adjusted treatment difference 
of 3 points in TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor score, assuming a  2-sided test at 
an alpha  level of 0.05. By including  2 treatment groups and using a 1:1 randomization, a total of 
50 evaluable participants  are required.  Assuming a nonevaluability rate of  15%, approximately 
60 participants will be randomized.  Additional participants  may be enrolled if the drop-out rate is hi gher 
than 15%.  
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The estimand for the primary efficacy analysis is the treatment difference between SAGE -324 and 
placebo in mean change from baseline in clinic -based TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper limb 
tremor s core at Day 2 9 based on the F ull Analysis Set. This will be analyzed using a mixed -effects 
model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline TETRAS 
performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor score , assessment timepoint, and timepoint-by- treatment 
as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables will be treated as fixed effects. All postbaseline 
clinic visits will be included in the model. The main comparison will be between SAGE -324 and 
placebo at the 2 9-day timepoint. Model-based point estimates (ie, least squares means, 95% confidence 
intervals, and p -values) will be reported where applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be 
used to model the within -subject errors. If there is a convergence issue with the unstructured covariance 
model, Toeplitz compound symmetry or Autoregressive (1) [AR(1) ] covariance structure will be used, 
following this sequence until convergence is achieved. If the model still does not converge with AR(1) 
structure, no results will be reported. When the covariance structure is not unstructured , the sandwich 
estimator fo r the variance covariance matrix will be derived, using the EMPIRICAL option in the 
PROC MIXED statement in SAS.  
Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used to analyze 
of the change from baseline in TETRAS total performance score s, Kinesia ONE accelerometer scores 
and TETRAS ADL score s. Individual items of the TETRAS subscales will be summarized.  
Safety Analysis  
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by incidence of TEAEs /serious adverse events, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Interim Analysis  
The sponsor may conduct an interim analysis . Detailed descriptions of planned  data analyses will be 
provided in a  separate interim statistical analysis plan (SAP), if applicable .

23 5. INTRODUCTION  
SAGE -324 is a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of A -type γ- aminobutyric acid -gated 
chloride channel (GABA A) receptors, the major class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in 
the brain. In addition to being developed as an adjunctive therapy in epilepsy and other seizure 
disorders under IND 139201, SAGE -324 is also being developed for the treatment of Essential 
Tremor (ET).  
Essential tremor is a permanently debilitating, neurologically determined, common movement disorder characterized by involuntary rhythmi c oscillation of a body part due to intermittent 
muscle contractions typically occurring when not at rest, thus interfering with fine motor skills 
associated with daily activities (Olanow 2008, Deuschl 2011, Hopfner 2016, NIH 2019).  
Although the pathophysiology and etiology of ET is not fully understood, it is postulated that 
approximately 50% of ET patients feature an autosomal dominant pattern of familial inheritance 
and that non- inherited cases may have toxin -based or other causality ( Olanow 2008, Hopfner 
2016). ET is the most common movement disorder in the US, with prevalence estimated to be 
approximately 2.2% of the population, representing a substantial societal medical burden with 
over an estimated 7 million ET patients in the US alone ( Louis 2014).  
In general, active tasks of daily life are adversely impacted by ET, including but not limited to 
speech, handwriting, household tasks, and occupational demands, contributing negatively to 
psychosocial well-being, general anxiety, and overall quality of life  (Koller, 1989). Although 
benign in term of its effect on life expectancy, ET is a progressive neurodegenerative condition 
whose symptoms are typically disabling, often forcing patients to change jobs or seek early 
retirement ( Zapp ia, 2013). In some cases, serious disability may ensue.   
The pharmacological profile of SAGE -324 is theorized to  induce therapeutic effect in the 
treatment of ET. Based on preclinical studies of  SAGE -324, which features a different 
mechanism of action than  that of propranolol, the pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamic (PD) 
profile suggests SAGE -324 may safely ameliorate symptoms in patients suffering from ET, 
regardless of propranolol use . 
There are currently ongoing Phase 1 clinical studies of SAGE -324 in healthy adults and in adults 
with ET . These studies, in addition to preclinical studies of SAGE -324, are detailed in the 
investigator’s brochure. 
With a GABA
A receptor -based mechanism of action  featuring  positive allosteric modulation  
capability , SAGE -324 represents a novel approach to the treatment of ET, which may help 
address the unmet medical need of the ET population, warranting further study of SAGE -324 as 
a potential treatment for this common movement disorder.  
Henceforth, this double -blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study of SAGE -324 will be 
conducted in adults and is designed to assess the effect of SAGE -324 on a variety of outcome 
measures specific to ET disease characteristics and associate d quality of life domains. 
5.1. Dose Justification  
The d ose of SAGE -324 planned for this study is 60 mg given as oral tablets, to be administered 
once daily in the morning with food. The dose w as selected based on preliminary data from 
3 active studies of SAGE -324, which included : unblinded data from completed cohorts in 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 5 CONFIDENTIAL  
24 324-CLP-101 Part A (oral solution SAGE -324 doses of 3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg, 60 mg); 
Part C (oral solution SAGE -324 doses of 30 mg); Part D (oral suspension SAGE -324 doses of 
30 mg) in healthy subjects ; and preliminary data from open- label Part E (oral suspension 
SAGE -324 doses of 45 mg and 60 mg) in participants with ET; additional preliminary data from 
324-CLP-102 cohorts 1 through 6 (cohorts 1 to 5 unblinded, cohort 6 blinded) , which evaluated 
oral suspension doses ranging from 5 mg to 60 mg; and preliminary unblinded data from 
324-CLP-104, which compared the relative bioavailability of the oral tablet (30 mg) vs oral 
suspension (30 mg) formulations of SAGE -324 and separately the effect of food on the PK of the 
SAGE -324 oral tablet. In 324- CLP-101 and 324- CLP-102 studies , doses were administered in a 
fasted state. The preliminary data from all of these active studies collectively informed the route 
of administration (oral) and dose strength of 60 mg as oral tablets planned for further evaluation 
in this study .  
SAGE -324 w as generally well -tolerated in participants with ET and in healthy volunteers, as was 
shown in the preliminary data of 324- CLP-101 Part E at single administration doses of 45 mg 
and 60 mg, and in 324- CLP-102 through once- daily administered doses of up to 60 mg for 
14 days. In addition, tremor reduction was observed at both doses on TETRAS and Kinesia ONE 
accelerometry, with greater improvement seen at 60  mg compared to 45 mg.  
In the clinically complete  study 324- CLP-104, preliminary data showed that SAGE -324 oral 
tablets, when coadministered with a meal, resulted in exposures approximately equivalent to that of SAGE -324 oral suspension under fasted conditions. Therefore, the SAGE -324 oral tablets are 
recommended to be admi nistered with food.  
5.2. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Based on the mechanism of action of SAGE -324 and the results of completed nonclinical studies 
and preliminary data of currently ongoing clinical studies of SAGE -324, it is theorized that 
participants  may have sym ptomatic amelioration, ie, tremor reduction and possibly improved 
quality of life from potentially stabilizing disease characteristics associated with ET. 
Potential risks anticipated in this study are based on available data from toxicology studies of SAGE -324 in addition to preliminary data from 3 ongoing, currently active Phase 1 clinical 
studies of SAGE -324.  
Available preliminary clinical data are summarized in the SAGE -324 Investigator’s Brochure.  
There have been no deaths or SAEs related to IP , and based on the preliminary clinical data 
available, there have been  no confirmed  clinically significant trends in clinical laboratory 
evaluations, vital signs, or physical examinations.  
Based on available preliminary clinical data from SAGE -324 active clinical studies, AEs of 
somnolence and feeling of relaxation are considered adverse drug reactions (ADRs) . In addition 
to scheduled clinic visits, the current status of study participants will be reviewed via phone calls 
in between clinic visits , or more frequen tly for AE monitoring .

27 7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design 
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SAGE -324 in individuals with ET. Participants, site staff, and 
sponsor personnel will be masked to treatment allocation  (see Section  9.5). 
This study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 29-day treatment period consisting of 
28 days of dosing with the end of treatment visit intended to be on Day 29 at trough, and a 14-day follow-up period relative to final dose  (Figure 1). After providing informed consent, 
participants will undergo screening assessments as outlined in Table 2  to determine eligibility .  
The Screening Perio d begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF). Eligible 
participants will visit the study center on Day 1 and complete additional eligibility assessments 
of safety and efficacy, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ). Following 
completion of screening and Day 1 eligibility checks, participants will be randomized to 1 of 
2 treatment groups (SAGE -324 60 mg daily, or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio.   
During the double-blind T reatment Period, s tarting on Day 1, participants will receive a single 
dose of investigational product (IP) once daily in the morning with food for 28 days on an 
outpatient basis (see Section  10.5) . Doses occurring on scheduled clinic visits will be 
administered in the clinic,  and doses occurring on all other days will be self -administered by the 
participant at home as specified in Table 2. During the T reatment Period, participants will return 
to the study center approximately once per week for efficacy and safety assessments as specified 
in Table 2 . If on Day 1 or at any point during the treatment period, participants experience 
moderate or severe AEs of somnolence, drowsiness, dizziness or similar, or experience these 
events at any severity with associated symptoms such as confusion or balance impairment , they 
must have a dose interruption (drug holiday) of at least 1 day (missing at least 1 dose). Following a drug holiday, the dose of study drug must then be reduced by 15 mg decrements to tolerability (ie, from 60  mg to 45 mg to 30 mg). The dose of IP may not be increased for the remainder of 
the study. At the investigator’s discretion, participants unable to tolerate the 30- mg dose will be 
discontinued from IP. During the study, a phone call will be conducted once per week, preferably 
midw ay between clinic visits,  or more frequently if deemed appropriate by the investigator, to 
review the current status of the participant.  Details regarding dose adjustment criteria and procedures are provided in Section  7.4. 
In addition to Kinesia ONE- specific training, c linical study center staff and study p articipants 
will be trained on the use of software applications and devices necessary to complete 
questionnaires or other assessments as required.  During in -clinic visits, clinical study center staff 
will be available to assist participants as needed , to ensure they can  access and use the software  
applications and devices  correctly according to the training . 
During the follow -up period, visits will be condu cted on an outpatient basis. In addition to the 
phone calls to review current status, participants will receive a phone call approximately 7 days 
after the last dose of IP (ie, Day 35) for safety monitoring. Participants will return to the study center for an end of study visit approximately 14 days following the last dose of IP (ie, Day 42).

7.2. Number of Participants 
Approximately 60 participants  are planned , with approximately 30 participants enrolled per arm, 
to produce 25  evaluable participants per arm  for primary efficacy  analysis. Additional 
participants may be randomized if the drop-out rate is higher than anticipated (ie, >15 %). 
7.3. Treatment Assignment 
Participants will be assigned to IP  (active or placebo) in accordance with the randomization 
schedule on Day 1. Additional details on randomization and blinding are provided in Section  9.5. 
7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria 
If a part icipant reports moderate or  severe adverse eve nts (as defined i n Section  12.2.5 ) of 
somnolen
ce, drowsiness, dizziness, o r similar eve nts or expe riences th ese events at an y seve rity 
with associated symptom s such as confusion  or balance impairment  on Day 1 or at any point 
during the treatment period, the participant must 
have a drug holiday (dose interruption) of at 
least 1 d ay (missing at least 1 dose) (Table 2 ). The drug holiday must be followed by reducing 
the dose of IP from 60 mg to 45 mg (i e, from 4 tablets of 15 mg to 3 tablets of 15 mg).   
If the events persist and continue to be moderate or severe, despite the drug holiday and dose 
reduction, or the participant experi ences a new moderate or severe AE of somnolence, 
drowsiness, dizziness or similar, the participant must have a further drug holiday  of at least 1 
day and a further dose reduction from 45 mg to 30 m g (from 3 t ablets 
to 2 tablets).  
The participant’s condition must be closely monitored via phone calls or in-person visits to 
assess the impact of any drug holiday and dose reduction. 
The reduced dose 
of IP will continue to be administered once daily at the same schedule as 
specified in
 the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2). The dose of IP may not be increased for the 
remainder of the study.  
Following a second drug holiday and dose reduction 
to 30 m g, if the events persist or recur and 
are 
moderate or severe, the 
investigator must discontinue the participant from the IP. The dose 
may not be reduced below 30 mg. 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 5 CONFIDENTIAL  
29 The investigator will continue to institute drug holidays, dose reductions, or IP discontinuation 
over and above this minimum as clinically appropriate.  
7.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
Sage Therapeutics may terminate this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety 
reasons including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting unacceptable risk to 
participant s, or for administrative reasons . In the event of study termination, Sage Therapeutics 
will provide written notification to the investigator. Investigational sites must promptly notify 
their IRB, where required, and initiate withdrawal procedures for participating participants.

8.4. Investigational Product Discontinuation and Early Termination from 
the Study  
8.4.1.  Investigational Product Discontinuation  
A participant may discontinue IP at any time at his/her own request for any reason. The 
investigator may discontinue a participant from IP for safety, behavioral, compliance, or 
administrative reasons. Participants who discontinue IP will be encouraged by the i nvestigator to 
remain on study and complete the EOT visit, the safety phone call 7 days later, and then, after a 
further 7  days, the End of Study/ Early Termination visit (EOS/ETV) , as specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ). If the participant withdraw s consent to collect protected 
health information , the EOS/ETV will be conducted . 
The reason for IP discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s study record and 
recorded in the participant’s electronic case report form (eCRF).  
The investigator must notify the sponsor and/or the m edical monitor when a participant stops IP  
for any reason.  
Participant s who discontinue IP  due to an AE, regardless of i nvestigator -determined causality, 
should be followed until the event is resolved, considered stable , or the i nvestigator determines 
the event is no longer clinically significant.  
8.4.2.  Early Termination from the Study  
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request for any reason. 
The investigator may discontinue a participant fro m the study for safety, behavioral, compliance, 
or administrative reasons.  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 5 CONFIDENTIAL  
33 The reason for early termination from the study must be documented in the participant’s study 
record and recorded in the participant’s electronic case report form (eCRF).  
The investigator must notify the sponsor and/or the m edical monitor when a participant stops 
participation in the study for any reason.  
If a participant is persistently noncompliant, the investigator should discuss with the sponsor the 
potential discontinuation of the participant. Any reasons for unwillingness or inability to adhere 
to the protocol must be recorded in the participant’s eCRF, including: 
• missed visits;  
• interruptions in the schedule of study drug administration;  
• non-permitted medications  
If the participant withdraws from the study after completing 28 days of dosing with IP, they will 
be encouraged to attend follow -up visits for safety assessments at Day 35 and Day 42 , as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ). If the participant withdraw s their consent to 
collect protected health information , the EOS/ETV  visit will be conducted and the participant 
will be permanently discontinued from the study at that time . 
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor will retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken 
and not tested, and the i nvestigator must document this in the site study records.  
8.4.3. Loss to Follow- up 
A participant will be deemed lost to follow -up after 3 attempts at contacting the participant have 
been unsuccessful .

9.3. Intervention after the End of the Study  
There is n o planned intervention following the end of the study. 
9.4. Treatment Adherence  
The first dose of IP  will be received and administered by participants in the clinic . Participants 
will be dispensed a 7-day supply of IP  to orally self- administer  at home with instructions 
specifying to administer in the morning with food. Treatment adherence will be monitored by the 
site staff at each in -clinic visit by direct questioning and counting returned tablets  and will be 
documented. Details on drug accountability are included in Section  10.6. 
Patients will be asked to record the dates and times of their IP dose administrations at home in a 
diary. They will also record details around how well they complied with the study instructions 
for self-administering IP  at home. 
9.5. Randomization and Blinding 
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants will be randomized in 
a 1:1 ratio  to treatment group s (SAGE -324, 60 mg  or placebo). Participants, site staff, and the 
sponsor will be blinded to treatment allocation. Randomization  schedules will be generated by an 
independent statistician . The randomization schedules will be kept strictly confidential, 
accessible only to authorized  personnel until the time of unblinding. The blinding of the study 
will be broken after the database has been locked.  
9.5.1. Emergency Unblinding  
During the study, the blind is to be broken only when the safety of a participant  is at risk and the 
treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received. Unless a participant is at immediate 
risk, the investigator should make diligent attempts to contact Sage prior to unblinding the study 
treatment administered to a participant. R equest s from the investigator about the treatment 
administered to study participant s should be discussed with the Sage  Medical Monitor . If the 
unblinding occurs without Sage’s knowledge, the investigator must notify Sage within 24 hours of breaking the blind. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly documented in the source recor ds.  
In all cases where the IP allocation for a participant is unblinded, pertinent information 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the participant’s records and on the eCRF.  
If a participant or any study personnel become unblinded to treatment, the participant will be 
excluded from the Per Protocol analysis set, as detailed further in the statistical analysis plan.

ASSESSMENTS  
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1. The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale 
TETRAS is a validated , comprehensive clinical assessment of essential tremor  (Elble 2013).  
Three different components of TETRAS will be assessed in this study. The TETRAS ADL 
subscale, total performance score, and performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor  score will 
each be separately assessed  at each clinic visit as specified in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2 ). 
The ADL subscale assesses how ET is impacting typical activities of daily living (ie, speech, 
eating, drinking, dressing, personal hygiene, writing, occupational impairment, social impact, 
and activities affected by upper limb tremor). It consists of 12 items that are  each  rated on a scale 
from 0  (normal activity)  to 4 (severe abnormality). The overall ADL score range is 0 to 48. 
The total performance score is based on overall rating  of tremor amplitude in the voice, limbs , 
head, face,  trunk, while performing pre -specified tasks, and also  measures functional task 
capabilities, ie, handwriting, spirography, and holding a pen over a dot. Each of these items is 
rated on a scale from 0  (no tremor) to 4 (severe tremor). Collectively, the performance items  
generate an  overall performance score fr om 0 to 64.  
For the performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor  score, a ll 3 maneuvers in the upper limb 
assessments of part 4 ( subscale items 4a, 4b, and 4c) will be completed for both arms, first for 
the right arm and then for the left. The part 4 sub scale ordinally rates postural (limbs extended 
forward  maneuver, and wing -beating  [elbows flexed] maneuver), and kinetic (finger-nose-finger 
maneuver) tremor on a 0 to 4  severity scale in 0.5- point increments.  
In this study, a videographer will videotape each TETRAS administration . 
Prior medications for ET  must be discontinued prior to Screening TETRAS rating s (see 
Section  9.2.2 for w ashout periods). 
11.1.2. Kinesia ONE™ Accelerometer Score 
Kinesia ONE™ is an ISO -certified wireless motion sensor worn distally on the index finger, 
which utilizes 3 orthogonal accelerometers and 3 orthogonal gyroscopes to monitor 3-dimensional motion. Data is tra nsmitted wirelessly from the sensor to a Bluetooth technology -
enabled device to use with the Kinesia ONE software (eg,  Apple iPad or similar device with 
preinstalled Kinesia ONE software). The device has received FDA clearance.  
Via the Kinesia ONE software  application, measures of 3-dimensional motion are converted to 
scores ranging from 0 to 4, per assessed maneuver; higher scores indicate greater tremor severity. 
Motion in both arms is captured. 
Participants will complete this assessment at each clinic visit as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 2 ).

11.3.1. Patient Perception of Response Burden  
The Patient Perception of Response Burden Questionnaire is a patient -reported measure that 
assesses the multidimensional construct of response burden ( Atkinson 2019).  
Participants respond to 6 items assessing 1) how well the questions related to their actual 
concerns, 2) how comfortable the participants were with answering the questions, 3) how well 
the survey characterized their health and well -being, 4) the length of time to complete the 
questionnaires, 5) whether questions seemed unimportant or repetitive, and 6) what additional 
information should have been gathered. Items 1 to 3 are assessed on a 0 to 10 scale, item 4 is 
assessed on a 1 to 3 scale, and items 5 and 6 are open -ended. Items 1 and 4 are reverse scored. A 
composite score can be calculated to create a weighted representative index of relevance, 
comfort, and well-being relative to time to completion (ie, items 1, 2, and 3 were summed and 
multiplied by item 4) for a range of 0 to 72, with higher scores indicative of elevated endorsed response burden. The open- ended items will be summarized thematically. The Patient Perception 
of Response Burden Questionnaire will be performed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ).

12.1. Safety Parameters  
All assessments will be conducted according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 ). 
12.1.1. Demograph y and Medical History  
Demographic characteristics (age, race, sex, ethnicity) and a full medical history will be 
documented. Whether the participant is left -handed or right-handed will be recorded. This must 
also additionally include pa rticipant  recall of history of ET, disease duration, past treatments  
used, and responsiveness to alcohol and/ or other treatments  with use intended as off- label  
treatment of ET (eg, primidone or similar therapies). 
12.1.2. Weight and Height  
Height and weight wi ll be measured and documented . Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated 
and documented.  
12.1.3. Physical Examination  
Whenever possible, the same individual should perform all physical examinations . Physical 
examinations will include review  of systems (eg, head, eye, ear, nose and throat; heart; lungs; 
abdomen; and extremities) as well as comprehensive neurological examination and MSE. 
Unscheduled physical examinations may also be conducted per the Investigator’s discretion. 
Any abnormality in physical examinations will be interpreted by an investigator as abnormal, not 
clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) in source documents .  
12.1.4. Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise blood pressure and heart rate  (supine and standing) , respiratory rate, and 
temperature. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate are to be measured after the 
participant  has been supine for at least 5  minutes  and then repeated 1 minute and 3 minutes after 
standing.  
Vital signs are measured once at each timepoint with the exception of predose on Day 1, when 
blood pressure and heart rate are measured supine and standing in triplicate at least 15 minutes apart . 
Any abnormality in vital signs will be interpreted by an Investigator as abnormal, NCS; or abnormal, CS in source documents. 
12.1.5. Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed . The standard intervals (heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF ) 
as well as any  rhythm abnormalities will be recorded.  
Electrocardiograms will be performed after the participant  has been resting in a supine position 
for at least 5 minutes. When ECG measurement s coincide with safety assessments, vital signs 
assessment or blood draws, procedures should be carried out in said order (vital signs , ECG, 
blood draw). 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 5 CONFIDENTIAL  
46 All abnormal ECGs will be interpreted by an investigator as abnormal, NCS, or abnormal, CS in 
source documents. 
12.1.6. Laboratory Assessments  
Blood and urine samples for clinical labora tory assessments will be collected . Analytes to be 
evaluated are summarized in Table  4.

Schedule of Assessments  (Table 2 ): amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, 
cannabinoids /THC, cocaine, methadone , MDMA, methamphetamines, opiates, oxycodone, 
tricyclic  antidepressants, and PCP . 
Urine samples will  be collected and tested for cotinin e. Either urine dipstick or breathalyzer will 
be used for alcohol testing. 
12.1.6.2. Pregnancy Screen  
A serum pregnancy test will be conducted for all female participants at Screening ; subsequently, 
a urine pregnancy test will be conducted for all participants of childbearing potential as specified 
in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ).  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 5 CONFIDENTIAL  
47 12.1.9. Safety Phone Call  
A phone call will be conduct ed once per week , preferably mid -week in between clinic visits  (as 
specified in  Table 2 ), and again at Day 35, to collect information  about current health status, 
general well -being, IP compliance, or to gather other pertinent health -related information as per 
investigator judgem ent. 
If a dose interruption (drug holiday) followed by a dose reduction is  required , the investigator 
will speak with the participant to provide instructions  via the phone or the participant will have 
an in-person visit.  
12.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
12.2.1. Adverse Event  Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship  
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.  
A TEAE is defined as an AE with onset after the start of IP , or any worsening of a preexisting 
medical condition/AE  with onset after the start of IP  and throughout the study. The term IP  
includes any Sage IP, a comparator, or a placebo administered in a clinical trial.

49 • The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
schedu led (or on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the participant ’s 
consent to participate in the study.  
• The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opinion of an 
Investigator, between the participant ’s consent to participate in the study and at the 
time of the procedure or treatment.  
12.2.3. Definition of Adverse Events of Special Interest  
There are no known adverse events of special interest as of the date of signature approval of this clinical protocol.  
12.2.4. Relationship to Investigational Product 
The investigator must make the determination of relationship to the IP for each AE (not related, 
related ). The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the relationship of AEs 
and SAEs to the IP .  
Not Related  An AE will be considered “not related” to the use of the IP if there is not a reasonable 
possibility that the event has been caused by t he IP. Factors pointing towards this 
assessment  include but are not limited to : the lack of temporal relationship between 
administration of the IP and the event, the presence of biologically implausible 
relationship between the product and the AE, or the presence of a more likely 
alternative explanation for the AE 
Related  An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the IP if there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the product under investigation. 
Factors that point towards this assessment include but are not limited to: a positive 
rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administ ration of the drug and 
the event, a known response pattern of the suspected drug, improvement following 
discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the 
drug and the AE, or a lack of alternative explanation for the AE  
12.2.5. Recording Adverse Events  
AEs spontaneously reported by the participant  and/or in response to an open question from the 
study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational site. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome and seriousness (if 
applicable), and whether or not it c aused the participant to discontinue the IP  or withdraw early 
from the study . 
Intensity will be assessed  according to the following scale: 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 5 CONFIDENTIAL  
50 • Mild : symptom(s) barely noticeable to participant  or does not make participant 
uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not 
ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s)  
• Moderate: symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make participant uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activity is influenced; participant  is able to continue in study; 
treatment for symptom(s) may be needed  
• Severe: symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or 
significant impact on participant’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of 
treatment with IP; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or participant 
hospitalized   
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs . Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section  12.2.2. An AE of severe intensity 
may not necessarily be considered serious.  
12.2.6. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
In order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting an SAE(s), the study site must notify Sage or designee within 24 hours of the study site staff becoming aware of the 
SAE(s). The investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE report form, verify the accuracy 
of the information recorded on the SAE r eport form with the corresponding source documents, 
and send a copy to Sage or designee.  
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should all be sent  to Sage or designee 
within 24 hours of receipt on a follow -up SAE report form and placed with the original SAE 
information and kept with the appropriate section of the eCRF and/or study file. 
SAEs occurring after the designated follow up time for the study, should be reported to Sage or 
designee according to the timelines noted above only if the i nvestigator considers the SAE 
related to IP .  
Sage , or designee, is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events. It is the principal investigator’s responsibility  to notify the IRB/EC of all SAEs that occur 
at his or her site . Investigators will also be notified of all suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions  (SUSARs ) that occur during the clinical study. Each site is responsible for notifying its 
IRB of all  SUSARs .  
In addition, appropriate personnel in Sage  Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance or designee will 
unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regulatory reporting. Sage  or designee will submit SUSARs 
(in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies according to local law. Sage , or 
designee, will submit SUSARs to i nvestigators in a blinded fashion. 
12.3. Pregnancy 
If a participant becomes pregnant after the first administration of IP , pregnancy information must 
be collected and recorded on the pregnancy form and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy. Details will be collected for all pregnancies for which conception was 
likely  to have occurr ed after the start of IP administration until 5 terminal half- lives following 
the last administration of IP  or until the completion of the study whichever is longer. Any 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 5 CONFIDENTIAL  
51 pregnancy occurring in that time frame will be followed until delivery or termination of the 
pregnancy. The investigator will also attempt to collect pregnancy informatio n on any 
participant ’s partner who becomes pregnant after the participant has received the first 
administration of IP . After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant 
partner directly, the investigator will follow the same pregnancy  reporting procedures specified 
for pregnant participant s.  
The participant  or participant ’s partner will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. The outcome of all pregnancies (eg, spontaneous abortion, elective abortion, normal 
birth) must be followed and documented even if the participant was discontinued from the study. 
The investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant  or participant’s partner and 
the neonate, and the information will be forwarded to Sage or designee. Generally, follow-up 
will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or ab sence of 
anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an IP  may have 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Any complication during 
pregnancy ( eg, anemia, infections, preeclampsia) should be reported as an AE/SAE. If the 
outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie,  
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE.  
12.4. Overdose 
An overdose is any dose of IP  given to a participant or taken by a participant that exceeds the 
dose described in the protocol. Overdoses are not considered AEs and should not be recorded as 
an AE on the e CRF; however, all overdoses must be recor ded on an overdose form and sent to 
Sage or designee within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the overdose. An overdose must be reported to Sage or designee even if the overdose does not result in an AE. If an overdose 
results in an AE, the AE must be recorded .

324-ETD -201, Version 5 CONFIDENTIAL  
52 13. STATISTICS  
Detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study will be provided in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock. 
Any changes or additions to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the clinical study report. 
13.1. Data Analysis Sets  
The Randomized Set wil l include all participants who are randomized.  
The Safety Set will include all participants administered IP.  
The Full Analysis Set will include all randomized participant s who received any amount of IP  
and have a baseline and at least one postbaseline TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper 
limb tremor score.  
 
 
The Per Protocol Set will in clude all participant s in the Full Analysis Set without any major 
protocol deviations that could affect efficacy. The review of major protocol deviations will be completed, and the decision on whether the deviation affects efficacy will be documented befor e 
database unblinding. Note that a positive cotinine test on Days 1, 8, 15, 22 or 29 constitutes a 
major protocol deviation.  
13.2. Handling of Missing Data  
Every attempt will be made to avoid missing data . All participant s will be used in the analyses, 
as per th e analysis populations, using all nonmissing data available. No imputation process will 
be used to estimate missing data .  
13.3. General Considerations  
All participant data, including those that are derived, that support the tables and figures will be 
presented in the participant data listings. Some data may be presented only in participant data 
listing, some may be presented with a corresponding table or figure; these will be indicated in 
relevant sections below. Participants will be summarized according to treatment received.  
For the purpose of all primary and secondary analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to receipt of IP .  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each time point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will 
include counts and percentages. 
13.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic data, such as age, race, and ethnicity, and baseline characteristics, such as height, weight, and BMI, will be summarized using the Safety Set .  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 5 CONFIDENTIAL  
53 Pregnancy test  results and drug screen results will be listed but not summarized .  
Medical history will be listed by participant .  
13.5. Efficacy Analysis  
The estimand for the primary efficacy analysis is the treatment difference between SAGE -324 
and placebo in mean cha nge from baseline in clinic -based TETRAS performance subscale part 4 
upper limb tremor scores at Day 2 9 based on the Full Analysis Set. This will be analyzed using a 
mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline 
TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor score, assessment timepoint, and 
timepoint- by-treatment as explanatory variable s. All explanatory variables will be treated as 
fixed effects. All postbaseline clinic visits will be included in the model. The main comparison will be between SAGE -324 and placebo at the 29-day timepoint. Model- based point estimates 
(ie, least squares me ans, 5% confidence intervals, and p- values) will be reported where 
applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within- subject errors. 
If there is a convergence issue with the unstructured covariance model, Toeplitz compound symmetry or Autoregressive (1) [AR(1)] covariance structure will be used, following this 
sequence until convergence is achieved. If the model still does not converge with AR(1) structure, no results will be reported. When the covariance structure is not UN,  the sandwich 
estimator for the variance covariance matrix will be derived, using the EMPIRICAL option in 
the PROC MIXED statement in SAS.  
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used for 
the analysis of the chang e from baseline in TETRAS total performance score s, 
Kinesia ONE 
accelerometer  scores  and TETRAS ADL score s.  
Other efficacy analyses will be specified in the SAP. In general, data will be analyzed using 
appropriate descriptive statistics or prespecified statistical methods as applicable; participant  
listings will be provided for all efficacy data. Participants will be analyzed according to randomized treatment for the purpose of efficacy unless otherwise specified.  
Sensitivity analyses will be described in the SAP. 
13.6. Safety Analyses  
Safety and tolerability of SAGE -324 will be evaluated by AE s, concomitant medication usage, 
 
 Safety data will be listed by participant  and summarized by treatment group . All 
safety summaries will be performed on the Safety Set using treatment r eceived.   
13.6.1. Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 22.1 
or higher. A treatment- emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE with onset after the 
first dose of IP . The analysis of AEs  will be based on the concept of TEAEs. The incidence of 
TEAEs will be summarized by System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term. In addition, summaries will be provided by intensity (mild, moderate, severe) and by causality (related, not related) to IP.  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
324-ETD -201, Version 5 CONFIDENTIAL  
54 Any TEAEs  leading to discontinuation of treatment or withdrawal from the study and any 
treatment- emergent SAEs  will be summarized.  
All AEs and SAEs (including those with onset or worsening before the start of IP ) through the 
end of the study will be listed.  
13.6.3. Physical Examinations  
The occurrence of a physical examination , including MSE, (yes/no) and the date performed will 
be listed by participant . 
13.6.6. Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Medications will be recorded at each study visit  during the study and will be coded using World 
Health Organization -Drug dictionary (WHO -DD) September 2015, or later .  
All medications taken within 30 days prior to informed consent through the duration of the study 
will be recorded. In addition, all psychotropic medications taken in the previous 30 day s prior to 
screening will be recorded. Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the start of IP  will 
be denoted “Prior”. Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the IP and continuing 
beyond the initiation of the IP  or those medications started at the same time or after the initiation 
of the IP  will be denoted “Concomitant”.  
Medications will be presented according to whether they are “Prior” or “Concomitant” as 
defined above. If medication dates are incomplete and it is not clear whether the medication was 
concomitant, it will be assumed to be concomitant.  
Details of prior an d concomitant medications will be listed by participant, start date, and 
verbatim term.

324-ETD -201, Version 5 CONFIDENTIAL  
55 13.8. Sample Size  and Power  
The sample size of this study is based on the assumption of a 3 points difference in the change 
from baseline TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper limb tremor score  between 
SAGE -324 and placebo with a standard deviation of 3.5 points. Under these assumptions, a 
sample size of 25 evaluable participants per group would provide 85% power for detecting a 
placebo -adjusted treatment difference of 3 points in TETRAS performance subscale part 4 upper 
limb tremor score assuming a 2- sided test at an alpha level  of 0.05. By including 2 treatment 
groups and using a 1:1 randomization, a total of 50 evaluable participants are required. Assuming 
a nonevaluability rate of 15%, approximately  60 participants  will be randomized.  Additional 
participants may be enrolled if the dropout rate is greater than 15%.

57 14. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
14.1. Study Moni toring  
Before an investigational site can enter a participant into the study, a representative of Sage 
Therapeutics will visit the investigational study site  per Sage SOPs  to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and ot her personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Sage Therapeutics or its representatives . 
This will be documented in a Clinical Trial Agreement between Sage Therapeutics and 
the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Sage Therapeutics or representative will have regular contacts 
with the investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investig ational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that IP accountability checks are being 
performed  
• Perform source data verification . This includes a comparison of the data in the case report 
forms with the participant’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each participant  (eg, clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Sage Therapeutics. 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any SAEs have been forwarded to Sage Therapeutics and those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB or EC. 
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Sage Therapeutics or authorized representatives of Sage Therapeutics, a regulatory authority, or an independent EC or an I RB may visit the site to perform an audit(s) or inspection(s), including 
source data verification . The purpose of a Sage Therapeutics audit or a regulatory authority 
inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and 
documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, 
analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP/ICH GCP guidelines , and any 
applicable regulatory requirements . The investigator should contact Sage Therapeutics 
immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency  or IRB/EC  about an inspection.

324-ETD-201 Protocol Administrative Letter # 1 
 
The purpose of this letter is to notify Investigators of an upcoming protocol amendment on the 
management of participants  experiencing adverse events of somnolence or similar events.   
 
This letter should be submitted to the local Independent Review Board (IRB) and filed within 
the Investigator Site File.  
 
The following represents the minimum action  an investigator must take in response to an 
experience of somnolence or similar adverse events experienced by a participant .  The 
investigator should, as always, continue to use their clinical judgement and institute drug 
holidays, dose reductions and IP discontinuations over and above these instructions  to ensure 
the safety and well -being of all participants . 
 
If a participant  experiences moderate or severe  adverse events of somnolence, drowsiness, 
dizziness or similar on Day 1 or at any point during the treatment period:  
 The Investigator must c arefully assess the participant before they leave the clinic  
 The Investigator must instruct the participant  prior to resuming study drug dosing via 
phone  call or in person  to ensure that:  
o The participant  has a drug holiday of at least one day (they must miss at least 
one dose)  
o The participant ’s daily dose of study d rug must then be reduced from 60 mg to 
45 mg  when study drug dosing resumes  
 The Investigator must closely monitor the participant ’s condition via phone call  or in 
person visit  to assess the effectiveness of the drug holiday and dose reduction.  
 
Following the first  drug holiday and dose reduction,  if the events persist and continue to be 
moderate or severe , or the participant  experiences a new moderate or severe AE of 
somnolence, drowsiness, dizziness or similar :  
 The Investigator must instruct the particip ant prior to resuming study drug dosing via 
phone  call or in person  to ensure that:  
o The participant  has another  drug holiday of at least one day (they must miss at 
least one dose)  
o The participant ’s daily dose of study drug must then be further reduced from 45  
mg to 30 mg when study drug dosing resumes  
 The Investigator must closely monitor the participan t’s condition via phone call  or in 
person visit  to assess the effectiveness of the drug holiday an d dose reduction

Following the  second drug holiday and  dose reduction to 30 mg , if the events persist or recur 
and are moderate or severe : 
 The investigator must discontinue the participant from the Investigational Product (See 
Section 8.4.1 of Protocol: I nvestigational Product Discontinuation)  
  
If at any time somnolence, drowsiness, dizziness or similar  events of any severity are also 
associated with symptoms such as confusion or balance impairment:  
 The Investigator must f ollow the instructions as above  on drug holidays , dose reductions  
and IP discontinuation .

STUDY SYNOPSIS  
 
 
 
PROTOCOL TITLE  A Phase II, Double -blind, Randomized, Placebo -controlled, 
Multic enter Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of VM202 in 
Subjects with Critical Limb Ischemia  
  
STUDY PHASE  II 
 
INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT  VM202  
 
DOSE Two doses will be tested: 8  mg and 16 mg of VM202.  
 
POPULATION  Patients aged ≥ 18 years to ≤ 90 years diagnosed with critical limb 
ischemia (CLI).  
 
STUDY DESIGN  A phase II, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, 
multicenter, 12 -month study designed to assess the safety  and 
efficacy of unilateral intramuscular injection in the calf of VM202 
in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI).  Fifty (50) patients 
will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of three treatment 
groups:  
 
• Low Dose: 8 mg VM202 – 20 patients  
• High Dose: 16  mg VM202 – 20 patients  
• Control – placebo  (normal saline ) – 10 patients  
 
Up to twenty sites will participate in the study.  Safety will be 
monitored throughout the study by a Data Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB).  
 
STUDY OBJECTIVES  1. To evaluate the safety of  IM administration of VM202 in 
subjects with moderate or high -risk CLI (Rutherford Clinical 
Severity Score equal to 4 or 5) who are poor or non - candidates 
for surgical or percutaneous revascularization.  
2. To evaluate potential bioactivity of IM administrati on of 
VM202 in subjects with CLI, when compared with placebo, on 
rest pain (as assessed by frequency of rest pain, pain medication 
use history, sleeping history, and intensity of rest pain) or leg 
ulcer healing (as assessed by ulcer surface area, time to 
complete healing), perfusion (MRA), hemodynamic assessment 
(ABI & TBI ), tissue oxygenation (TcPO 2) and the incidence and

STUDY ENDPOINTS  The primary study endpoint is to assess the difference in pain level 
between baseline and the 9 month follow -up as determined by 
VAS.  Active and placebo arms will be compared to determine 
treatment effect.  
 
Other secondary endpoints will include:  
• Difference in pain level between baseline and the 9 month 
follow -up as determined by VAS by sex and by comorbidities 
(esp. diabetes or renal dysfunction)  
• Change in tissue oxygenation (TcPO 2) from baseline to 6, 9 and 
12 months following the first treatment  
• Change in hemodynamic measures (ABI and TBI) from 
baseline to Day 28, Day 90, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months  
following the first treatment 
• Change in perfusion (MRA) from baseline to 9 mo nths 
following the first treatment 
• Wound healing (no ulcer: change of skin condition, one ulcer: change of ulcer size, multiple ulcer: change of ulcer number) from baseline to 9 months following the first treatment  
• Change in VAS score from baseline to  Day 14, Day 28, Day 42, 
Day 90, at 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months.  
• Change in QOL score ( VascuQol ) at 90 Days, 9 months  and 12 
months;  
• Major limb a mputation rate at six months and twelve months 
following the first treatment 
• Mortality at six and twelve months  after first treatment 
 
SAFETY  Any patient who receives VM202 will be included in the safety 
analysis population.  Adverse events (including serious adverse 
events, and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation) 
throughout the 12 month follow -up will be described according to 
severity and their relationship  to the study drug and / or device and 
procedure.  Descriptive statistics (N, mean, median, SD, minimum 
and maximum values, where applicable) will be used to 
characterize safety parameters.  
 
All patients will  undergo testing as presented in the American 
Cancer Society Cancer Screening Guidelines as part of their 
baseline testing to rule out cancer.

1.1. PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE  
The term “peripheral arterial disease” (PAD) is widely used to refer to 
atherosclerotic disease that obstructs the blood supply to the lower limbs.  The 
clinical manifestations of PAD are a major cause of  acute and chronic illness.   
Patients with PAD exper ience progressive decrements in  functiona l capacity and 
quality of life .  PAD frequently coexists with coronary and  / or cerebrovascular 
disease, likely due to a similar underlying pathology and shared  risk factors  (e.g., 
smoking , hyperlipidemia, hypertens ion, and diabetes).   Patients with PAD have  a 
20% - 60% increased risk for myocardial infarction (MI), a two - to six -fold 
increased risk of cardiovascular death, and a 40% increased risk of stroke.1, 2  This 
higher level of morbidity and mortality  occur s, in part, because many affected 
patients are asymptomatic and remain un diagnosed for years , allowing the disease to 
progress unchecked .  Clinical symptoms often only manifest when the disease state 
is advanced.3   
 
It is estimated that PAD now affects 8 to 12 million people in the United States.  The 
prevalence of symptomatic PAD increases with age and with number of risk factors.  
PAD occurs in 1% - 4% of the population over the age of  40, and is reported to be as 
high as  30% in patients over 70 or in patients  older than  50 years with a history of 
diabetes, smoking, or both .4-6  As the population ages, this number will increase.   
 
 
1.2. CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA  
Critical limb ischemi a (CLI) is the end-stage manifes tation of PAD .  One to three 
percent of newly diagnosed PAD patients initial ly present  with CLI; 5% -10% of all 
other PAD patients eventually progress to CLI .  The natural history of CLI has been 
well documented to have an inexorable downhill course.  CLI patients  experience 
ischemic rest pain (Rutherford category 4), ischem ic skin lesions, and ulcers or 
gangrene (Rutherford category 5-6).  Amputation of the affected limb remains a 
commo n procedure and is likely to occur more frequently due to an aging 
population.7  The incidence of major amputations ranges  from 120 to 
500/million/year.6  In patients with the comorbidities of diabetes mellitus or renal 
insufficiency, the rate of amputation can be much greater.7, 8 
  
1.3. T
REATMENT OPTIONS  FOR CLI 
The primary treatment goals in patien ts with CLI are to relieve isch emic pain, heal 
(neuro) ischemic ulcers, prevent limb loss, improve patient function and quality of 
life and prolong overall survival.   Therefore, reestablishing blood supply to the 
affected limb , when possible, is critical.  In addition to successful revascularization, 
the institution of lifestyle changes, atherosclerotic risk factor modification, and 
pharmacologic therapies are also us ed to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and 
mortality.   Narcotic medications are often used  for analgesia  and for assistance with 
sleeping.

  Page 19 of 90  
1.3.1.  REVASCULARIZATION OPTIONS  
Revascularization options for patients with CLI range from open surgical procedures 
(bypass grafts) to various endovascular procedures .  The treatment approach depends 
on a careful evaluation of a patient’s current medical condition ( comorbidities ), the 
location and extent of the lesion, and the availability of an autologous conduit (e.g. 
saphenous vein).9-11  Although arterial bypass surgery has long been consider ed the 
preferred first line treatment modality, many of the newer endovascular technologies 
can be used with similar success rates and with reduced morbidity.12, 13  
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) has been shown to be effective, with limb salvage rates compar able to  surgical procedures.  Stents placement is usually 
attempted after  failed PTA .  Adjunctive therapies such as lasers, thermal angioplasty 
and atherectomy devices have not yet demonstrated  improved efficacy when 
compared with conventional lower extremity interventions.
14, 15  
 
1.3.2.  AMPUTATION  
Amputation is considered when revascularization is not feasible due to the location 
and extent of atherosclerosis, when a p atients is unable to tolerate a procedure, or 
when a patient is  unlikely to have a functional extremity despite restoration of distal 
flow (e.g. due to dementia, chronic illness , etc.).  While amputation does eliminate 
the source of pain at rest and all necrotic tis sue,11 it is associated with a significantly 
elevated perioperative and one year mortality rate.1, 6, 16    
 
1.3.3.  UNMET CLINICAL NEED 
In the absence of revascularization  options , most patients with CLI  require 
amputation within 6 months.  Patients requir ing major amputation face a diminished 
quality of life, an unfavorable natural history and need extensive resources for their post-amputation rehabilitation an d course.   The 1 -year amputation- free survival rate 
for patients diagnosed with CLI is 45%; the mortality rate is approximately 25% and 
may be as high as 45%  in those who have undergone amputation.
1, 6, 16  Management 
of this end -stage disease process consumes a significant amount of healthcare 
resources.17, 18  Clearly, new therapeutic approaches are required.  
 
 
 
1.4. THERAPEUTIC ANGIOGENESIS IN ISCHEMIC LIMB DISEASE  
Two key processes determine the amount of blood flow to skeletal muscle in patients 
with CLI: 1) the degree of arterial occlusion, and 2) the degree to which an 
endogenous angiogenic response is mounted  to compensate for the occlusion.  
Ischemic tissue injury causes the release of numerous mediators, i ncluding growth 
factors, tran scription factors, an d signaling molecules  known to  stimulate 
angiogenesis and growth of collateral vessels.  19, 20  However, this physiologic 
response to pathophysiologic processes is often inadequate to prevent clinical 
manifesta tions of ischemia.

  Page 20 of 90 A growing area of research has focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms 
underlying angiogenesis.  The goal is to identify and harness the critical molecular 
players that initiate and / or regulate angiogenic growth.  A number of cytokines 
such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)  have been studied intensively and early phase I/II studies have been 
conducted.  The data thus far have been mixed.
21-26 
 
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)  has been shown to be a potent angiogenic  growth 
factor stimulating the growth of endothelial cells and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells.
27, 28  It is a multi- functional mesenchyme -derived cytokine with potent 
angiogenic and anti -apoptotic effects 27-30  HGF stimulates DNA, RNA and protein 
synthesis by endothelial cells in a dose -dependent manner and attenuates high D -
glucose -induced endothelial cell death.  HGF has also been shown to upregulate 
VEGF expression, and has demonstrated greater  mitogenic activity than that of 
VEGF alone in human aortic endothelial cells in vitro .31, 32  Recently, HGF 
gene transfer  has been shown to produce significant augmentation of collateral 
formation in rabbit hind limb ischemia model.28  Furthermore, a significant  increase 
in blood flow was achieved by HGF gene transfer  both in rat diabetic and non-
diabetic  hind limb ischemia models.30, 33   
 
Because of its pluripotent capabilities, increasing the availability of HGF in ischemic 
tissues to achieve therapeutic angiogenesis has been a growing area of research.  The 
challenge associated with delivering a targeted sustained dose of exogenous HGF to 
ischemic tissues is in overcoming the instability of HGF in blood circulation and its rapid clearance by the liver; HGF has an in vivo  half-life of less than 15 minutes.
34, 35  
 
One approach to increasing HGF in ischemic tissues is to develop a gene transfer 
strategy that would allow for persistent expression of HGF protein in vivo .  Although 
plasmid DNA is one of the least efficient gene transfer systems currently  in use, the 
fact that it is associated  with limited persistence and no propensity for genomic 
integration , (particularly in skeletal muscle tissue ) makes it an attractive option for 
local targeted delivery in ischemic tissue s. 
 
 
1.5. VM202 
The investigational agent being studied in this protocol is VM202.  VM202 is a 
DNA plasmid that contains novel genomic cDNA hybrid human hepatocyte growth 
factor (HGF) coding sequence (HGF -X7) expressing two isoforms of HGF, HGF 728 
and HGF 723. 
 
The key feature of HGF -X7 is that it was designed by inserting a series of intron 
sequences into certain sites of HGF cDNA so that both isoforms of HGF protein are expressed simultaneously and efficiently as in the human genome.  Because there is 
no change  in the coding region of the HGF gene, HGF proteins generated from 
VM202 are identical to the wild -type human HGF proteins.  VM202 has been 
developed using the pCK DNA plasmid that has been safely used in previous

known as VMDA -3601.   
 
 
Figure 1. VM202 construct  
 
Safety of VM202.   The use of plasmids for targeted delivery of angiogenic  factors 
into muscle tissue is a particularly attractive and a relatively safe therapeutic approach, because plasmids have been shown to effectively transfect postmitotic 
cells such as skeletal and heart muscle and to successfully express angiogenic genes 
with very little dissemination and persistence at distant sites.  Following 
intramuscular injection, the plasmid that persists is extrachromosomal and 
integration into host DNA, if it occurs, is negligible.
36-38  This local effect of 
conventionally injected naked plasmid DNA is well known .39, 40   
 
Potential Efficacy of VM202.   VM202 has demonstrated potential for stimulating 
angiogenesis in animal models.  The development of new blood vessels may 
improve blood flow to peripheral nerves and potentially replace damaged capillary bed.  VM202 may have the ability to increase perfusion and wound healing, as well 
as decrease pain  due to neuropathy  brought on by i schemia . 
 
 
1.6. PRECLINICAL DATA 
The non- clinical safety of VM202 has been evaluated for general toxicity following 
single intramuscular and intravenous doses in rats.  In addition, the general toxicity of VM202 following multiple intermittent (weekly or monthl y) intramuscular doses 
has been evaluated in rabbits and rats, respectively.  The potential for genomic integration at the injection site as well as the potential for distribution to and 
persistence of VM202 in reproductive tissues was evaluated in rats. The ability of 
VM202 to induce humoral immune responses was evaluated following intramuscular 
administration with or without adjuvant in mice.  All species utilized for these 
studies (mouse, rat, and rabbit) were shown in in vivo  experiments to be able to 
express the plasmid following intramuscular injection.  
 
An ischemic heart disease efficacy study in a Yorkshire swine model demonstrated 
that intrammyocardial  administration of VM202 increased the capillary density and 
regional perfusion in ischemic myocar dium and improved ischemic left ventricular 
function.  An ischemic heart disease efficacy study in rats demonstrated that

  Page 22 of 90 histologically identifiable capillaries increased following intramuscular  
administration of VM202 (versus pCK and pCK -VEGF 165; p< 0.001). 
 
Collectively, VM202 has been well -tolerated in all studies conducted to date, with 
the only evidence of toxicity consisting of mild, transient injection site irritation in rats at a dose level 6-fold above the human clinical dose of 16 mg (0. 23 mg/kg for a 
70 kg patient), the maximum dose administered on a single day in the phase I study.  There has been no evidence of systemic toxicity in any study and human HGF has 
not been detected in the sera of rats or rabbits following intramuscular injection  
[lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) = 125 pg/ mL].  There is no evidence of genomic 
integration, potential germ cell transmission, or immunostimulatory effects 
following intramuscular administration of VM202 to animals.  
 
Therefore, the nonclinical efficac y and safety studies support the continued clinical 
investigation of VM202 in patients  with critical limb ischemia .  
  
1.7. C
LINICAL DATA 
VM202was  evaluated for treatment of critical limb ischemia in a prospective, dose-
escalation Phase I study .  The study consist ed of four (4) cohorts of three (3) ‘no-
option’ CLI patients .  Patients received either 2 mg, 4 mg , 8 mg, or 16 mg VM202.  
For each dose cohort, VM202 was administered as local intramuscular injection s 
with half of the dose administered at Day 0 of the study and the second half 
administered 2 weeks later .  Preliminary efficacy (hemodynamic assessments), 
safety and tolerability were evaluated at Baseline (screening) and at designated time 
points throughout the study.  Clinical evaluations were to be c onducted at baseline, 
Days 15, 28, 59, 91, 180, and 365.  All dose cohorts were followed for a year from 
the time of the first dose of study drug administration.  
 
Enrollment is now complete.  Between March of 2007 and October of 2008, twelve  
(12) patients participated in the study (median age, 72 years, 53% male and 75% 
were a current or former smoker).  No deaths occurred during the 12- month follow 
up, but one patient underwent a major amputation.  Median ABI and TBI 
significantly increased from 0.35 to 0. 52 (P=0.005) and 0.15 to 0.24 ( P=0.01) at 12 
months follow -up.  TCPO2 showed a trend of increase.  A significant reduction in 
pain was reported by nine of eleven patients, with median VAS decreasing from 58 
to 16 ( P=0.03) at 6 months follow -up. VAS score reduction tracked well with the 
hemodynamic data.   
 
In general, there was more improvement over baseline in Cohort II (4 mg VM202) 
than in any other cohort.  Cohort I (2 mg of VM202) also experienced a significant 
reduction in pain and modest improvement i n hemodynamic measurement.  
Interestingly, 2 patients in each of these cohorts (pt ID 001102, 001103, 001104, and 001109) all had diabetes), possibly suggesting some benefit of VM202 in this 
subpopulation.  Doses of aspirin above 81 mg daily may have an inhibitory effect on 
the therapeutic activity of VM202.

  Page 23 of 90  
VM202 appears to be well tolerated at doses as high as 16 mg.  There were no 
unexpected adverse events in the study.  None of the serious adverse events were 
directly attributable to VM202 (eight SAEs in five subjects, 5/12, 41. 7%).  There 
was one  amputation  caused by osteomyelitis which was assessed as unrelated to 
VM202.   
 
Preliminary Conclusions.   These early data support the feasibility of intramuscular 
injections of VM202 in subjects with cri tical limb ischemia.  They suggest that this 
therapeutic approach may improve functional outcomes and provide symptomatic 
relief.  VM202 is rapidly eliminated from circulation, and appears to remain active 
only at the injection site.  The incidence of complications, while high, did not appear 
to be significantly different between treatment cohorts .  Continued study of VM202 
in patients with CLI and / or diabetes is warranted.  
  
1.8. S
TUDY AND DOSE RATIONALE  
Based on the promising results seen in the phase I stu dy, two doses (8 mg and 16 mg 
final VM202 dose) will be tested and compared to placebo injections  in this phase II 
study .  Patients will be treated with a final dose of 8 mg VM202, 16 mg VM202 or 
placebo  by intramuscular injections in the affected calf on Day 0, Day 14, Day 28 
and Day 42.  VM202 will be delivered in a solution of 0.5 mg VM202 / mL.  
 
As there are currently no approved drugs that can reverse CLI and as most patients 
have exhausted surgical and endovascular intervention options, inducing 
angio genesis in the affected limb with VM202 may result in an increase in tissue 
perfusion, which, in turn improve wound healing, reduce pain and improve limb salvage rates.

3.1. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The objective of this Phase II study is to evaluate the safety of IM administration of 
VM202 in subjects with moderate or high -risk CLI (Rutherford Clinical Severity 
Score equal to 4 or  5) who are poor or non - candidates for surgical or  percutaneous 
revascularization; and, to evaluate potential bioactivity of IM administration of 
VM202 in subjects with CLI, when compared with placebo, on rest pain (as assessed 
by frequency of rest pain, pain medication use history, sleeping history, and intensity 
of rest pain) or leg ulcer healing (as assessed by ulcer surface area, time to complete 
healing), perfusion (MRA), hemodynamic assessment ( ABI & TBI ), tissue 
oxygenation (TcPO 2) and the incidence  and extent of lower leg amputation or other 
surgical interventions . 
 
 
3.2. STUDY DESIGN  
This is a 12 month phase II, double-blind, r andomized, placebo -controlled, 
multicenter study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of VM202 in subjects 
with critical limb ischemia .  Patients with critical limb ischemia  will be screened for 
study eligibility after giving informed consent.  Screening will include assessment of 
study eligibility, a complete medical history, physical exam, cancer screening tests, 
viral scre ening, ABI & TBI , TcPO 2, VAS, 12 lead EKG, retinal fundoscopy, clinical 
chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and pregnancy test (women of childbearing potential only), and documentation of any ulcers or gangrenous areas.   With the 
exception of ulcer measurement , VAS, ABI & TBI  and TcPO
2 which will be 
repeated prior to first injection , procedures conducted during screening will 
represent the baseline reference values.   Screening/ Baseline assessments should 
occur within the 60 days prior to Day 0 (day o f injection).   
 Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned in a 2 :2:1 fashion 
to one of the three treatment arms:  Low Dose ( 8 mg VM202) , High Dose ( 16 mg 
VM202) , or placebo, respectively.  Assignm ent to a treatment arm will be 
centralized, using an  independent predetermined randomization scheme in a double -
blinded fashion .  Blinding  will be achieved by having  the study medication (test and 
control products) prepared by the study pharmacist. Reconstituted VM202 is indistinguishable  from saline solution.  
 Prior to the first injection, vital signs, concomitant medications, serum chemistry and 
hematology, ulcer evaluation, VAS, ABI & TBI , TcPO2, VascuQol , serum HGF, 
and copies of VM202 will be determined.  MRA will also be conducted as  a sub -
study at up to two sites.   
 
Patients will receive VM202 or placebo (normal saline) by intramuscular injections 
in the calf chosen for treatment on Day 0, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42.  VM202 will 
be delivered in a solution of 0.5 mg VM202 / mL .  Study drug will only be 
administered unilaterally.

Prior to recruitment of any patients into the study, written approval of the protocol 
and informed consent must be obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB ). 
 
3.4.1.  INFORMED CONSENT  
The investigator will explain the study purpose, procedures, and patient’s 
responsibilities to the potential participant.  The patient's willingness and ability to meet the follow -up requirements will be determined and written informed consent 
will be obtained (
Appendix 2).  The patient will sign and date the informed consent  
form.  The person executing the consent  will also sign and date the consent fo rm.  
The original informed consent form will be retained with the patient records ; a copy  
will be provided to the patient.   
 Following is a detailed list of study visits from screening to final follow -up and the 
required procedures / tests.  Methodologies  for specific tests/ procedures are 
described in Section 4. 
 
3.4.2.  P
ATIENT IDENTIFICATION  
To maintain confidentiality, the patient’s name should not be recorded on any st udy 
document other than the informed consent form.   All patients that give informed 
consent (sign the informed consent form) will be assigned a unique identifier.   
 3.4.3.  S
CREENING (DAY -60 TO DAY 0) 
Patient enrollment is subject to the rules established in Section 3.2 for 
randomization , but screening procedures can proceed provided the Investigator waits 
for enrollment confirmation from ViroMed or its Designee. 
 
The foll owing procedures / evaluations will be conducted at screening:  
 
• Obtain informed consent prior  to any study -related p rocedures  
• Evaluation of eligibility  
• Complete Medical History  
• Vital Signs  
• Complete Physical Exam 
• Concomitant Medications  
• Cancer screening – including cancer markers  (carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), 
alpha fetoprotein (AFP), CA19 -9, and CA125 ( females  only) ); pap smear and 
mammogram if not performed within past 12 months (females only); chest X -ray 
or CT scan of the chest (if the patient  has a previous history of tobacco use, a CT 
scan will be performed instead of the chest X -ray) within 3 months prior to study 
entry; PSA (males only); for patients ≥ 50 years old, colonoscopy within past 10 
years  
• Retinal Fundoscopy  - fluorescei n angiography may be conducted in cases where 
fundoscopy alone is deemed insufficient

Patient s not meet ing all study entry criteria will  be designated as a screen failures.   
End of study procedures will not be performed for these patients, but their reason for 
discontinuation will be recorded on the CRF.  Screen failures will be replaced.  
 
3.4.4.  TREATMENT AUTHORIZATION  
After providing written informed consent, potential study participants will undergo 
Screening assessments.  The site will complete a Treatme nt Authorization Form  
(TAF) for patients  determined to be eligible for study participation .  The TAF  
includes the patient identification number, demographic information (gender, date of 
birth ) and indication  that the patient meets all in clusion and exclusi on criteria.   The 
completed TAF  will be faxed to ViroMed or its designee.   ViroMed  or its designee 
will confirm whether  the patient can be treated, update the TAF  with specific 
treatment instructions , and return it  to the investigational site by fax. Upon receipt, 
the Investigator  will schedule the patient to undergo the study treatment.   Note: 
adherence to this process is mandatory to track enrollment and to assure proper 
randomization.  
 3.4.5.  R
ANDOMIZATION & BLINDING  
A randomization schedule with subjects allocated to high dose, low dose or control 
in a 2:2:1 ratio will be sent to a centralized drug depot, which will prepare individual 
kits that are sequentially numbered and contain the appropriate treatment based on 
the randomization schedule.  When a site identifies a subject and treatment 
authorization is granted, the site will notify the drug depot.  
The drug depot will : 
 1. Send the next kit in sequence to the site, labeled with the site number and subject 
number.  
2. Record which kit number was assigned to which site/subject and the date.  
3. Include in the kit, a sealed envelope that identifies the site number, subject 
number and kit number on the outside and the assigned treatment inside, to be 
opened by the Investigator or designee only in the case of a medical emergency.

number and kit number on the outside and the assigned treatment inside, to be 
opened by the Sponsor or designee only in the case o f a medical emergency.   
 Blinding will be achieved by having the study medication (VM202) prepared by the 
study pharmacist. Reconstituted VM202 is indistinguishable from saline solution. . 
The site pharmacist prepares the vials according to the instruction s in the kit (which 
vials to reconstitute with water for injection [WFI] .  The drug depot, site pharmacist 
and select individuals at Synteract  (but not including study monitors) will be 
unblinded to the treatment assignments. The subject and study personne l, including 
core lab, investigator and study coordinators, will remain blinded until all data has 
been entered into the database and the database is locked.  
 IN CASE OF EMERGENCY ONLY, i.e. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) 
AND ONLY WHEN THIS INFORMATION INFLUENCES THE PATIENT'S 
MANAGEMENT, the Investigator may open the sealed envelope to immediately 
start the appropriate treatment (to be recorded in the case report form [CRF]).  
 For each opened envelope, the Investigator will provide the name of the person who  
opened the envelope, reason, date, and signature on the envelope.  At the end of the study, all (opened and unopened) envelopes will be returned with the study products 
to the Sponsor.

3.5.3.  PREMATURE STUDY TERMINATION  
The Sponsor rese rves the right to discontinue the study for any safety, ethical or 
administrative reason at any time.  
  
3.6. I
NVESTIGATIONAL DRUG PRODUCT AND ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
3.6.1.  INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG PRODUCT  
VM202 is a DNA plasmid containing a novel genomic cDNA hybrid human 
hepato cyte growth factor (HGF) coding sequence (HGF -X7) expressing two 
isoforms of HGF, HGF 728 and HGF 723.  The key feature of HGF -X7 is that it was 
designed by inserting a series of intron sequences into certain sites of HGF cDNA so 
that both isoforms of HGF protein are expressed simultaneously and efficiently as in 
the human genome.  Because there is no change in the coding region of the HGF 
gene, HGF proteins generated from VM202 are identical to the wild -type human 
HGF proteins.   
 The plasmid  has 7,377 base pairs , a HCMV enhancer / promoter, a growth hormone 
polyadenylation terminator sequence, ColEl originator, and the Kanamycin 
resistance gene, on a pCK backbone.   
 VM202 is supplied in a sterile glass vial containing 2.2 mg of lyophilized study 
product.  VM202 should be stored in a refrigerator at temperatures between 2
oC and 
8oC in an appropriately locked room accessible only to the pharmacist or a duly 
designated person.  Since VM202 does not contain preservatives, opened vials of 
VM202 and VM202 reconstituted with water for injection ( WFI) must be used 
within 6 hours when stored at room temperature. VM202 should never be frozen.   A 
complete description of test article administration can be found in Appendix 4. 
 
3.6.2.  PLACEBO  
The placebo will be sterile normal saline.  Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is a 
sterile, nonpyrogenic solution for fluid and electrolyte replenishment.  It contains no 
antimicrobial agents.  The nominal pH is 5.5 (4.5 to 7.0)  and it contains 9.0 g/L 
Sodium Chloride, USP (NaCl) with an osmolarity of  308 mOsmol/L (calc).  
Visually, n ormal saline is indistinguishable from reconstituted VM202.  
 
3.6.3.  PRODUCT ACCOUNTABILITY  
In accordance with federal regulations (21CFR 312.62), all Investigators are required 
to keep accurate records showing final disposition of all investigational drugs.

  Page 36 of 90  
Investigational drugs  are to be used only in accordance with this protocol and under 
supervision of the Principal Investigator.  The Principal Investigator or his designee 
will maintain an accurate record of the receipt of the test drug as shipped by the 
Sponsor/Designee, incl uding the date received.  In addition, an accurate drug 
disposition record will be kept, specifying the amount dispensed to each patient and the date of dispensation.  This inventory record must be available for inspection at 
any time.  Copies of this reco rd will be provided to the Sponsor by the Principal 
Investigator at the conclusion of the study.  
 
After the study is completed, the Principal Investigator must account for all drug 
used, unused and partially used.  Unused s tudy medication from the study site will 
be returned to the Sponsor/Designee as directed in writing by the Sponsor for gross reconciliation.  
 
3.6.4.  D
OSE AND ADMINISTRATION  
VM202 is supplied in a sterile glass vial containing 2.2 mg of lyophilized study 
product.  Before administration, it will be reconstituted with 4.4 mL of water for 
injection (WFI) by the study pharmacist for a final VM202 concentration of 0.5 mg / 
mL.  Each reconstituted vial is only to be used for one subject.  Patients assigned to 
either the placebo arm or the Low Dose arm will receive normal saline injections .  
The placebo group will receive only normal saline injections; the Low Dose arm will 
receive VM202 for the first two injection visits  (Day 0 and Day 14), and then normal 
saline for the next two injection visits (Day 28 and Day 42).   Visually, normal saline 
is indistinguishable from reconstituted VM202.   A complete description of test 
article administration can be found in Appendix 4. 
 
 
 
3.7. PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT MEDICATION  
All concomitant medications (taken within 60 days of the first injection) will be 
recorded on the CRF at each study visit.   
 
For each medication taken, the following information will be collected:  
• Medication trade name;  
• Indication for which the medication was given;  
• Dose/strength, route, and frequency of administration;  
• Date started and  
• Date stopped  (or continuation) .

4.1. EVALUATIONS CONDUCTED AT BASELINE ONLY 
 
4.1.1.  COMPLETE MEDICAL HISTORY  
A complete medical history will be obtained at Baseline.  All positive and negative 
findings will be carefully documented on the CRF.  Any new finding discovered 
during the B aseline evaluation and prior to the first study drug administration (Day 
0) will be considered to be part of the medical history and will not be recorded as an 
adverse event.  
 The Investigator will perform an especially detailed assessment of past peripher al 
arterial disease history to include all events and interventions for critical limb 
ischemia and to excluded other (e.g. structural abnormalities  such as fibromuscular 
dysplasia or connective tissue disorders , inflammatory conditions, thromboembolic 
disease, impingement/entrapment, venous claudication, etc.).   
 
4.1.2.  C
OMPLETE PHYSICAL EXAM  
A complete physical exam will be performed at Baseline.  The exam will include the 
following: head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT), heart, lungs, abdomen, extremities, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal, neurological, gastrointestinal and 
dermatological systems. Any clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded in the patient’s CRF.  
 
4.1.3.  CANCER SCREENING  
All patients  participating in this trial must undergo routine cance r screening.  The 
history and diagnosis of potential or apparent malignant, and non- malignant diseases 
and neoplasms will be assessed through several diagnostic tests and procedures.  
Some diagnostic tests and procedures performed prior to study consent an d 
documented in the patient’s medical history may be acceptable where noted.  Routine cancer screening includes the following:  
 1. For patients ≥ 50 years old, colonoscopy within past 10 years  
2. Chest X -ray or CT scan of the chest (if the patient  has a previous  history of

ISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS)  SCORE  
Pain will be measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) at screening, before the 
first treatment ( injection ) on Day 0, pretreatment on Days 14, 28 and 42, Day 90, 6 
months , 9 months  and 12 months .  The VAS scoring instrument is a 10 -cm line, 
oriented horizontally , with the left end indicating “no pain” and the right end  
representing “pain as bad as it can be”.  The patient is asked to mark a place on the 
line corresponding to the current pain intensity.  The distance along the  scale is then 
converted into a numeric reading as detailed in the study manual . 
 
4.2.8.  PATIENT QUESTIONNAIRE (VASCU QOL) 
The VascuQol patient questionnaire was specifically developed for use in patients 
with lower limb ischemia.42   This questionnaire has 25 questions that review five 
domains: activity level, symptoms, pain, emotional status and social items.  VascuQol was found to be better at detecting im provement in symptoms, disease 
severity than SF -36 in CLI patients and correlated well with the Rutherford 
classification .
43  This test will be administered pre- injection on Day 0, at Day 90, 9 
months, and 12 months .  The VascuQol can be found in Appendix 5. 
 4.2.9.  A
NKLE BRACHIAL INDEX (ABI)  AND TOE BRACHIAL INDEX (TBI)  
Ankle -Brachial Index (ABI) and Toe Brachial Index (TBI) will be determined at 
screening, before the first treatment (injection) on Da y 0, before the third injection 
on Day 28, on Day 90, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months .  ABI and TBI will be 
determined as described in the Study Manual .

Transcutaneous oxygen pressure  (TcPO 2) will be measured at screening, before the 
first treatment (injection) on Day 0, at 6, 9 and at 12 months.   TcPO 2 measurement 
sites will include  the anterior and posterior calf and dorsum of the foot.  Because 
TcPO 2 measurements are instrument dependent , investigator s should use the same 
instrument for all TcPO 2 assessments and follow the standard procedures defined by 
their instrument’s manufacturer.   If a sensor placement site is unavailable due to 
amputation or areas of ulceration/gangrene, sensor placement site will be assigned a 
clinically equivalent default TcPO 2 value of zero pressure (“0 mmHg”).  Hard copy 
instrumentation printout will be included in the source documentation to support the TcPO
2 data.  The limb/chest TcPO 2 index will be calculated by  using the lesser of the 
lower limb measurements.   
 
4.2.11.  PHOTOGRAPH AND MEASUR EMENT OF ULCER  
Two p hotographs of any ulceration s or gangren ous areas will be taken for 
documentation purposes only  if present at screening or immediately before treatment 
on Day 0 .  If present prior to the first injection, t wo photographs of each 
ulceration/gangrene area will be obtained pretreatment on Days 14, 28 and 42, on 
Day 49, Day 90, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months .  A metric ruler (cm and mm) 
will be photographed in the low er right hand corner of the frame to allow for scale 
determination.  During the monitoring visit, the monitor will retrieve one of the two 
photographs for each ulceration/gangrene area.  The border of all photographs will be labeled with the photograph dat e, patient ’s initials, and the patient ’s study number 
assignment.   Ulcer dimensions will be measured and recorded as detailed in the 
Study M anual .  
 
4.2.12.  INJECTION SITE REACTION ASSESSMENT  
Local injection sites reactions will be assessed on Day 0 post injection , pre and post 
injection on Days 14, 28 and 42, and on Day 49  using the grading defined by the 
National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology for Adverse Events v3.0.  The 
grading categories are as follows and will be recorded on the CRF  as described in

5. EVALUATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
5.1. DEFINITIONS  
An Adverse Event (AE) is the development of an untoward medical occurrence or 
the deterioration of a pre- existing medical condition following  or during exposure to 
an investigational product, whether or not considered causally related to the product.   
 
An untoward medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs 
(e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or clinically significant abnormal results of an 
investigation (e.g., laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  
An adverse reaction  means any adverse event caused by a drug.  Adverse reactions 
are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
 Suspected adverse reaction  means any adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence t o suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, 
which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence which:

  Page 43 of 90  
• Results in death;  
• Is life-threatening ; 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization which is not 
specifically required by the protocol or is elective ; 
• Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a 
body structure ; or 
• Requires medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure . 
 
Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life-
threatening or require hospitalization may be considered SAEs when they jeopardize 
the patient or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the serious 
outcomes listed above.  Examples of such medical events include: allergi c 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  Medical and scientific judgment 
must be exer cised when classifying events as serious.  
 Life-threatening  means that the patient is, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred.  It does not include an AE which, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death.  
Persistent or significant disability/inc apacity means that the event resulted in 
permanent or significant and substantial disruption of the patients’ ability to carry 
out normal life functions.   
 
An unexpected AE  is an AE, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with 
the applicable pr oduct information (e.g. Investigator Brochure for an unapproved 
product).  Expected means that the event has been previously observed with the test 
article and is identified and/or described in the applicable product information.  It 
does not mean that the  event is expected with the underlying disease(s) or 
concomitant medications.  It is expected that certain disease states will have reoccurring adverse events some of which may be considered expected over time.  
 
 
5.2. ASSESSMENT OF AES 
All AEs, regardless of se verity, occurring following the first study drug 
administration and the 12 month follow -up visit  of the study by a patient must be 
recorded on the AE form provided with the CRF.  This will include the following 
information:  
 
• Description of the AE  
• Date of o nset 
• Duration  
• Frequency 
• Severity

  Page 44 of 90 • Seriousness (yes/no)  
• Treatment  
• Outcome  
• Relationship to study medication, injection procedure  and/or  underlying disease  
 
All AEs and SAEs must be followed until resolution, or the condition stabilizes .  The 
Investigator is responsible to ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental 
investigations as may be indicated to elucidate as completely as possible the nature 
and/or causality of the AE or SAE.  This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care 
professionals.  ViroMed or its designee may request that the Investigator perform or 
arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations.  
 
5.2.1.  AE CAUSALITY  
The study investigator will determine whether an AE is related or unrelated to study 
medication, the procedure (intramuscular  injection ) and / or the underlying disease  
using the following criteria : 
 
Not relate d: An adverse event that is not related to the use of the test article or 
administration procedure.    
 
Possibly related: An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test article or 
administration procedure. An alternative explanation, e.g., concomitant study 
product(s), conc omitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is 
reasonable; therefore, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   
 Probably related: An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test article  or 
administration procedure. The relati onship in time is suggestive. An alternative 
explanation is less likely, e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s).  
 
Definitely related : An AE that is due to the use of the test article or administration 
procedure . The event cannot be reasonably explained by an alternative explanation – 
e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s).  
 
5.2.2.  AE
 INTENSITY  
The intensity of the AE/SAE will be defined by the following criteria:  
Mild : The AE is noticeable to the patient but does not interfere with 
routine activity . 
Moderate : The AE is discomforting and interferes with routine activity.  
Severe: The AE significantly limits the patient’s ability to perform 
routine activities despite symptomatic therapy.

  Page 45 of 90 5.3. REPORTING /RECORDING OF AES 
Throughout the course of the study, all efforts will be made by the investigator to 
remain alert to possible AEs.  The first concern will be the safety of the patient , and 
for providing appropriate medical intervention.  The period of observation for 
collection of AEs starts during the first intramuscular injection procedure (Day 0) 
until the 12 month follow -up visit.  Any AE should be recorded on the appropriate 
CRF page(s).  
 
 5.4. R
EPORTING / RECORDING OF SAE S 
 
5.4.1.  INVESTIGATOR ’S RESPONSIBILITY  
SAES will be recorded following the first study drug administration and the 12 
month follow -up visit.  Any serious adverse event that occurs during this 
investigation, whether or not related to the study medication, must be r eported 
immediately (within 48 hours) to the study sponsor and / or Synteract , the designated 
CRO.    
 
Each SAE must be followed with appropriate medical management until resolved or 
assessed as chronic or stable regardless of whether or not, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, the event is thought to be related to the study medication.   
 The Investigator will be required to provide complete information concerning each 
SAE to the CRO and Sponsor within 5 calendar days of the event.  This information 
must be recorded in the patient ’s medical record and then transcribed onto the SAE 
Form.  The completed SAE F orm (including the Investigator’s opinion of the 
relationship of the SAE to the study medication), copies of related results/reports, consultant report(s), and other relevant information will be faxed and mailed to the 
CRO.  
 In the event of an SAE leading to hospitalization, every effort will be made by the 
investigational site to obtain medical records, including a hospital discharge summary.  In the event of a fatal AE, documentation of any available postmortem 
findings, including autopsy, will be provided to ViroMed or their designee.  In any 
event, the Investigator will provide a narrative summary of circumstances, events 
related to the death, and cause of death, if known.  Any follow -up information 
obtained must be recorded on an SAE follow -up report fo rm. 
 
The Investigator must comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements 
related to the reporting of SAEs to regulatory authorities and the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB), Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) .  Upon receipt from 
ViroMed of an initial or follow -up IND Safety Report or other safety information, 
the Investigator must promptly notify his or her IRB, IBC.

  Page 46 of 90 5.4.2.  SPONSOR ’S RESPONSIBILITY  
All AEs and SAEs will be reported on and annual basis to FDA in accordance with 
the IND  regulation (21 CFR Part 312).  Per the 2010 FDA Guidance Document  for 
Industry and Investigators “Safety Reporting Requirements for  
INDs and BA/BE Studies,”  events categorized as ‘possibly’ or ‘probably’ related 
will be treated as ‘suspected adverse reactions.’  Event s categorized as ‘definitely’ 
related will be treated as an ‘adverse reaction.’  
 
All serious , unexpected  adverse reactions and suspected adverse reactions  will be 
reported to FDA and to all participating investigators as an IND Safety Report 
within 15 calendar days of the event after the sponsor determines that the suspected 
adverse reaction qualifies for reporting  (21 CFR §312.32).  Any unexpected fatal or 
life-threatening AEs will be reported to the Agency within 7 calendar days  after the 
sponsor’s initial receipt of the information . 
 
Any incident s of neoplasia or retinopathy will be reported to FDA in an expedited 
report (within 7 days of occurrence).  
 
ViroMed will notify all participating investigators of any new safety information that 
alters the current risk -benefit  assessment of the study medication or that would be 
sufficient to consider changes in VM202 administration or in the overall conduct of 
the trial.  
 
 
 
 
6. STATISTICAL METHODS  
The objective of this Phase II study is to evaluate the safety of IM administration of 
VM202 in subjects with moderate or high -risk CLI (Rutherford Clinical Severity Score 
equal to 4 or 5) who are poor or non - candidates for surgical or percutaneous 
revascularization; and, to evaluate potential bioactivity of I M administration of VM202 in 
subjects with CLI, when compared with placebo, on rest pain (as assessed by frequency of rest pain, pain medication use history, sleeping history, and intensity of rest pain) or leg 
ulcer healing (as assessed by ulcer surface area, time to complete healing), perfusion 
(MRA), hemodynamic assessment ( ABI & TBI ), tissue oxygenation (TcPO2) and the 
incidence and extent of lower leg amputation or other surgical interventions.  
 
6.1. GENERAL METHODS  
Means, standard deviations (SD), medians and minimum and maximums will be 
presented for continuous variables, the number and percentage of patients in each category will be presented for nominal and ordered categorical variables.  Statistical 
tests with a p value <0.05 will be considered statistically significant, unless 
otherwise stated.

6.2.1.  PRIMARY ENDPOINT  
The primary study endpoint is to assess the difference in pain level between baseline 
and the 9 month follow -up as determined by VA S.  Active and placebo arms will be 
compared to determine treatment effect.   The primary analysis will be conducted in 
the efficacy analysis dataset.  A secondary analysis will be conducted in the ITT 
analysis dataset, and further analyses conducted as necessary to explore any 
inconsistency between the two results.  
 
6.2.2.  SECONDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS  
Other secondary endpoints will include:  
 
• Difference in pain level between baseline and the 9 month follow -up as 
determined by VAS by sex and by comorbidities (esp. d iabetes or renal 
dysfunction)  
• Change in tissue oxygenation (TcPO 2) from baseline to 6, 9 and 12 months 
following the first treatment 
• Change in hemodynamic measures (ABI and TBI) from baseline to Day 28, Day 
90, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months  following the first treatment  
• Change in perfusion (MRA) from baseline to 9 months following the first 
treatment 
• Wound healing (no ulcer: change of skin condition, one ulcer: change of ulcer size, multiple ulcer: change of ulcer number) from baseline to 9 months 
following the first treatment 
• Change in VAS score from baseline to  Day 14, Day 28, Day 42, Day 90, at 6 
months, 9 months, and 12 months.  
• Change in QOL score ( VascuQol ) at 90 Days, 9 months  and 12 months;  
• Major limb a mputation rate at six months and twelve months following the first 
treatment 
• Mortality at six and twelve months after first treatment 
 
6.2.3.  S
AFETY  
Any patient who receives VM202 will be included in the safety analysis population.  
Adverse events (including serious adverse events, and adverse e vents leading to 
treatment discontinuation) throughout the 12 month follow -up will be described 
according to severity and to their relationship with the study drug and / or device and 
procedure.  Descriptive statistics (N, mean, median, SD, minimum and max imum 
values, where applicable) will be used to characterize safety parameters.  
 
All patients will all undergo testing as presented in the American Cancer Society 
Cancer Screening Guidelines as part of their baseline testing to rule out cancer.

For ethical reasons, and to ensure study integrity,  an interim examination of key 
safety data will be performed when approximately half of the patients (n=25) have 6 
months data .   The primary objective of this  analys is will be to evaluate the 
accumulating data for an unacceptably high frequency of negative clinical outcomes in either active treatment arm.  An independent data safety monitoring board 
(DSMB) will perform the review.  The DSMB Chair will review a limited set  of 
unblinded tables and listings, including all reported SAEs, monthly through to the 
full DSM B interim analysis (at 25-patient s) and then every three months thereafter.  
The DSMB chair may request additional data for review and/or additional meetings of the committee as he / she sees fit.  
 
 
 
6.3. PATIENT CATEGORIZATION  
Screen Failure  - Any patient who was consented and entered into the screening 
process appropriately, but subsequently did not meet the entry criteria in order to be 
treated.  Patients who fail screening will not be followed for safety or efficacy 
assessment, and no othe r study procedures will be performed.  
 Evaluable Patient  - Any patient who received the study drug.  
 
Lost to follow -up - A patient deemed to be lost to follow -up is any patient who 
received treatment, but who does not complete scheduled study visits.  This  includes 
those patients who withdraw consent and refuse further study participation and all 
attempts to contact the patient are deemed unsuccessful.

monitor, as a representative of ViroMed, has the obligation to follow this study closely.  In addition to conducting a site visit prior to initiation of enrollment, the clinical monitor will 
visit the s tudy facilities regularly, and utilize telephone and written communications on an 
ongoing basis to maintain current knowledge of the study.   
 
During periodic visits to the study site, the monitor will review the source documents used 
in the preparation of  the CRFs to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information 
contained in those reports in preparation for retrieval.  All source documents must be dated and signed by the person who performed the assessment or procedure, and must contain all 
infor mation required by the CRF.  All data generated during this study and the source 
documents from which they originated are patient  to inspection by ViroMed or its 
representative, the FDA and other regulatory agencies.

  Page 49 of 90 Upon completion of the study, the clinical monitor will conduct a final visit (close -out) to 
the site.  The objectives of this visit are to ascertain that all regulatory records and reports 
are complete, verify that study drug and other supplies have been accounted for and ensure 
that the investigator is aware of his/her responsibilities post -study. 
 
 
 
8. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
ViroMed employees and/or their contracted representatives utilize Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOP) designed to ensure that research procedures and documentation are 
consistently conducted/prepared to the highest quality standards.  These SOPs also require 
compliance with Health Authority regulations and Good Clinical Practice guidance.  
 
A Quality Assurance audit may be conducted by ViroMed or its designee at an y time 
during or after completion of a study.  The Investigator will be given adequate notice if he/she is selected for an audit.  The audit will include, but is not limited to, a review of all 
informed consent forms, a review of CRFs, associated source do cuments and medical 
records, a review of regulatory documentation, an assessment of study conduct and 
protocol compliance, and a review of the investigational drug accountability.  At the 
conclusion of an audit, the auditor will conduct a brief meeting wit h the Investigator to 
review the findings of the audit.  
  
 
9. I
NSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD  
Prior to the initiation of the study, the protocol, the informed consent form and 
investigator’s brochure will be submitted to the IRB for approval.  By signing the 
"Stat ement of Investigator" form (form FDA 1572), the investigator is assuring that an IRB 
which complies with the requirements set forth in 21 CFR Part 56 will be responsible for the initial and continuing review of the proposed clinical study.  A copy of the IRB 
approval letter for the protocol, the informed consent, and the protocol signature page must be submitted to ViroMed or its designee, prior to release of investigational supplies to the 
study site.  The approval letter must refer to the specific protoc ol and the informed consent 
form.  The study site must maintain an accurate and complete record of all reports, documents and other submissions made to the IRB concerning this protocol.  A list of the IRB members, their titles or occupations, and their ins titutional affiliation, or an IRB  
assurance number must be provided to ViroMed or its designee prior to release of study supplies.  
 FDA/relevant health authority regulations require that all advertisements for patient  
recruitment be approved by an IRB prio r to implementation.  The complete text and format 
must be submitted to ViroMed or its designee for approval prior to IRB  submission.  
 The investigator is responsible for notifying the IRB of any serious adverse events as 
required by the IRB.  A copy of the notification must be forwarded to ViroMed and to

Status reports must be submitted to the IRB  at least once a year (or more frequently as 
required by the IRB) and the IRB must be notified of completion or termination of the 
study.  A final report must be provided to the IRB and ViroMed within 1 month of study 
completion or termination.  This report should include: any deviations from the protocol, 
the number of participants evaluated, the number of participants who withdrew or were 
withdrawn and the reasons for withdrawal, any significant adverse events and the 
investigator's summation of the study.  
  
 
10. I
NSTITUTIONAL BIOSAFETY COMMITTEE (IBC)  
The site at which this trial is being conducted will ensure that an Institutional Biosafety 
Committee is in place that is composed of at least 5 appropriately -qualified members.  The 
IBC will ensure that the site conforms to the requirements set forth in the Section IV -B-2 of 
the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, promulgated by 
the National Institutes of Health/Office of Biotechnology Activities (NIH/OBA).  
 
The Investigator will be responsible for petitioning the IBC and obtaining approval prior to 
enrolling any patient  in the study.  The Investigator will also be required to obtain and 
follow all biohazard safety guidelines promulgated by the IBC, and to report all findings as required to the IBC and to NIH/OBA.  
 
 
 
11. INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to inform each patient, prior to the screen ing 
evaluation, of the purpose of this clinical trial, including possible risks and benefits and document the informed consent process in the patient’s chart.  A sample informed consent 
form containing the required elements of informed consent is provided in 
Appendix 2.  Any 
changes made to this sample must be approved by ViroMed or its designee, prior to submission to an IRB.  After approval by ViroMed or its designee,  the informed consent 
must be submitted to and approved by an IRB.  Prior to entry into the study or initiation of any study -related procedures, the patient must read, sign and date the informed consent 
form.  The person executing the consent must also sig n and date the final consent form 
page.  Patients will be asked to initial each page of the informed consent form to 
acknowledge awareness of its contents.  One original informed consent form is to be retained by the study site and a copy  is to be given to  the patient.  The informed consent 
process must be documented in the patient’s medical record.  
 
The informed consent must be written in a language in which the patient  is fluent.  If a 
foreign language translation is required, a statement of certification  of the translation must 
be issued.  Regulations require that foreign language informed consent forms be submitted to the IRB for approval.  The investigator must forward a copy of the consent form, the 
certified foreign language translation and an IRB app roval letter to ViroMed Co., Ltd.

12. CONFIDENTIALITY  
In accordance with GCP and with the national data protection laws, all information 
concerning the patients in the study must be treated as strictly confidential by all persons 
involved in the study . 
 
The investigator acknowledges that any and all information acquired from the Sponsor or 
its designee or developed or acquired in connection with the study are strictly confidential.  The investigator will not disclose any confidential information to any third party nor use 
confidential information for any purpose without first obtaining the consent of Sponsor in writing.  Such consent shall be deemed to have been given for disclosure to any person for 
whom the investigator is responsible at his/her center, but  only so far as required for the 
purposes of the study, and, in the case of disclosures to staff, only if such staff are bound by obligations of confidentiality no less strict than those set out herein.  
  
 
13. P
ROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  
The Sponsor will document modifications to the protocol in the form of a written 
amendment.   Protocol modifications that impact patient  safety or the validity of the study 
must be approved by the IRB before implementation.  In the case of a medical emergency, to remove immediate ap parent hazard to patients , a change may be made preferably after 
discussion with ViroMed or its designee.  In these instances, the IRB and FDA will be notified as soon as possible.  
  
 
14. D
ATA MANAGEMENT  
All data relating to study procedures will be entered i nto CRFs provided by ViroMed or its 
designee.  All requested information must be entered on the CRF.  If an item is not 
available or not applicable this fact should be indicated.   
 Obvious errors (self evident corrections) will be corrected and documented  by ViroMed or 
its designee.  Other errors or omissions will result in queries which will be sent to the 
investigational site on Data Clarification Forms  (DCF)  for resolution .  A copy of the signed 
DCF is to be kept by the site with the CRFs.  Once the ori ginal is received by ViroMed or 
is designee , the resolutions will be reviewed and entered into the database.   
 
Data will be entered into a computer database developed specifically for this trial.  Access 
to the database will be restricted to personnel responsible for data entry and to data 
management and statistics personnel who are directly involved in the management or 
analysis of this trial.  During the course of the trial, data queries will be generated for data 
items that are potentially erroneous and  require appropriate clarification or correction.  
Prior to database lock, statistical verification of the data will be undertaken in order to further assure data quality.

medical condition.   
 
Why is this study being done?  
You are being considered to participate in this research study because y ou have critical limb 
ischemia and are not a good candidate for a revascularization procedure.  
 
Because the blood vessels in your body have narrowed or become blocked, not enough blood 
flows to your legs, causing pain, swelling, and possibly an infection th at is slow to heal.  The 
growth of new blood vessels to supply blood to your limbs would help increase blood flow that may reduce pain, swelling, and infection.  Stimulating the growth of new blood vessels may also 
stimulate growth or regeneration of nerves and may reduce pain. Researchers have discovered that a protein called hepatocyte growth factor  (HGF) that your body naturally produces in small 
amounts can cause the growth of new blood vessels  and protect nerves.  Unfortunately, your 
body only makes a small amount of this protein and not always in the areas where you need it.  
Researchers have found a way to increase the amount of HGF in your legs.  They have isolated the genes responsible for directing the production of HGF, and have designed a product  that can 
be injected into your leg.  
 
In the research study the HGF gene will be injected  into your calf muscle cells to evaluate if it 
changes your pain related to critical limb ischemia .  The product being used in this study is 
called VM202.  VM202 is an  experimental drug that is not yet approved by regulatory authorities 
(the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]).  VM202 is a plasmid (a small piece of DNA), which includes the HGF gene s.  VM202 has been used in a study in Korea in patients with 
coronary artery disease and in another study in the United States in patients with critical limb 
ischemia (decreased blood flow to the legs).  VM202 has also been tested in people undergoing 
coronary bypass surgery.  It is hoped that VM202 injected into your calf m uscle will increase the 
blood flow to your foot ant reduce pain.  This study will examine whether VM202 injected into 
your leg is safe and tolerable at either low or high dose, and also will collect preliminary information about whether the plasmid increas es HGF and relieves your critical limb ischemia.  
This study is intended to help determine:  
• The safety  and tolerability of a low and high dose of  VM202 ; and,  
• if VM202 can improve  your critical limb ischemia and reduce your pain.   
 
VM202 will be injected in to your calf muscle using a syringe with a fine needle.   Only one leg 
will be treated in this study.   
 
Who is in charge of this study?  
The Principal Investigator is [INSERT PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR NAME ].  This study is 
sponsored and funded by ViroMed Co., Ltd.  [insert PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR NAME ] is 
being paid by ViroMed Co., Ltd. to conduct this study.  Together with your doctor, ViroMed Co., Ltd. will also use a specialized research company, called a contract research organization, in

How many people will take part in this research study? 
A total of 50 patients will take part in this study at up to 20 hospitals  in the United States.   
 
What happens if I  agree to be in this research study?  
After you sign this consent form indicating you want to participate in this study, you will need to undergo some tests done to see if you qualify for the study.  The list of the tests that will be done 
are listed below .  If you do not meet all of the study entry criteria, you will not be able to 
participate in the study and your doctor will discuss with you other options that you may have for 
treatment of your medical condition.   The study doctor  will tell you whether yo u are able to 
participate in this study after the initial test results are received and reviewed.   
 
This study is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized clinical study.  If you agree and are 
medically eligible to participate you will be “ randomly ” assigned (like drawing numbers out of a 
hat or flipping a coin) to one of three groups as listed below.  “ Double-blind” means that you and 
your doctor will not know the treatment you are getting in the study.  However, your doctor can 
find out if needed.  “Placebo controlled ” means not all participants will be assigned to a 
treatment group that will receive the study drug.  Some participants may only receive saline 
injections.  What group you are assigned to is done by a computer and is not known by your 
doctor until the study is completed.   
 You will be randomly assigned to one of three possible study groups:   
 
• Low Dose  VM202 Treatment Group  – if you are selected for this grou p, you will receive 8 
mg of  VM202 over the course of the first two injection visits (4 mg of VM202 at the Day 0 
visit and 4 mg of VM202 at the Day 14 visit) .  Each individual injection contains 0.5 mL of 
fluid with 0.25mg VM202.  You will receive 16 inject ions for a total of 8 milliliters ( 8 mL) 
of VM202 ( which is about a teaspoon and a half of fluid ) at the first two injection visits.  On 
the next two injection visits (Day 28 and Day 42) you will receive saline injections ( sixteen 
0.5 mL injections for a t otal of 8 mL at each injection visit) .  Approximately forty percent  of 
patients will be selected for this group.   
 
• High Dose  VM202 Treatment Group  – if you are selected for this group, you will receive 16 
mg of  VM202 over the course of the four injection visits (4 mg of VM202 at the Day 0 visit, 
4 mg of VM202 at the Day 14 visit, 4 mg of VM202 at the Day 28 visit,  and 4 mg of VM202 
at the Day 42 visit) .  Each individual injection contains  0.5 mL of fluid with 0.25mg VM202.  
You will receive a  total of 8 milliliters ( 8 mL) of VM202 (which is about a teaspoon and a 
half of fluid ) at each of the four  injection visits.   Approximately forty percent  of patients will 
be selected for this group.   
 
• Placebo  Control Group – if you are selected for this group, you will not receive VM202.  
You will only receive injections of saline.  At each of the four injection visits, you will 
receive sixteen injections of 0.5 mL of saline for a total of 8 milliliters ( 8 mL) of saline

What tests, procedures, and diagnostic studies will be done during this study?   
There are 10 visits which span 12 months total time from visit #2 to visit #10.  Depending on the 
visit, different tests will be done.  Visit #1 may actually take more than one visit to accomplish dependi ng on how many tests can be scheduled on that first day, but is usually completed within 
a few weeks before the first injection procedure (Visit #2).  Below is a detailed description of each of the required visits and the laboratory tests, procedures, and evaluations that will be done 
during the visits.   
 Description of the tests, procedures, and diagnostic studies to be done  
 Medical history – Discussion with your doctor of your medical history, including diabetes 
history and any changes that have happened.   
 Physical exam – Your doctor will examine you.  This exam includes taking your sitting blood 
pressure, temperature, and heart rate ( vital signs ).   
 Photograph and Measurement of Ulcer – any ulcerations or gangrenous areas present prior to 
the first injection will be photographed.  
 
Medication Review – Discussion with your doctor of what medications and dietary supplements 
you have taken or are currently taking.   
 
Assessment of critical l imb ischemia  – Assessment by your doctor of the condition of your feet 
and legs, your reflexes, and sensitivity to touch.  
 
Injection site reaction assessment – Assessment by your doctor of any pain or other reaction at 
the locations where VM202 was injected.  
Assessment of side effects – Assessment by your doctor of any unpleasant medical experiences, 
side effects, or discomforts that may have happened to you.   
 
Questionnaire – You will be asked to fill in a short questionnaire about feeling in your legs and 
feet at Screening.  You will be asked to complete brief questionnaires about pain in your feet and 
legs at some visits.

  Page 66 of 90 Cancer Screening  – Cancer screening includes testing for cancer markers; pap smear and 
mammogram if not performed within past 12 months (females only); PSA (males only); for 
patients ≥ 50 years old, colonoscopy within past 10 years; and x -ray or CT scan of chest.  
 Retinal Fundoscopy – An ophthalmologist may dilate your pupils and perform a retinal 
examination with retinal photographs at Screening.  If your ophthalmologist determines that a 
more detailed image of the blood vessels in your eye is necessary to determine if you are eligible for study participatio n, he / she may conduct another test called fluorescein angiography.   This 
involves injecting a dye into a vein in your arm; the dye then circulates through the bloodstream and to the blood vessels of your eye.  Retinal photographs of the back of your eye will be taken 
again at 12 months, but the fluorescein angiography will not be repeated.  If dilating eye drops 
are used, they may impair focusing of the eyes for several hours. Therefore, arrangements should 
be made for someone else to drive after the exa mination. Wearing sunglasses or tinted lenses 
may make dilated pupils more comfortable.  You should tell the examiner if you are allergic to 
any medications, are taking any medications, or have glaucoma or a family history of glaucoma.   
 Pregnancy test – If you are a female of child bearing age, you will have a urine pregnancy test 
done to confirm that you are not pregnant.  You cannot participate if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the course of the trial.   
 12 Lead ECG – An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a measurement of your heart’s electrical activity 
that is traced and sent to a machine, which can be read by your doctor.  This procedure is not painful and involves lying as still as possible for a few minutes with sticky pads  (electrodes)  on 
your chest, arms and legs which are connected through wires to the ECG machine.  This test typically takes approximately 15 to 20 minutes.  
 Urine and blood tests – Routine urine and blood tests will be done at certain visits.  Laboratory 
tests will als o include testing for VM202 and HGF  levels in the blood at certain visits.  The 
screening evaluation laboratory tests will include viral tests for various diseases including HIV  
(the AIDS virus), HTLV  (human T -cell lymphotropic virus), hepatitis B ( HBV ), and hepatitis C 
(HCV).  
 
Measuring blood pressure in your leg  (ABI & TBI ) – The ankle -brachial index (ABI) and the 
toe-brachial (TBI) index is the ratio of the blood pressure in the lower legs to the blood pressure 
in the arms. Compared to the arm, lower bl ood pressure in the leg is a symptom of blocked 
arteries.  Blood pressure measurements are taken at the arms and ankles or toes . You may 
experience some minor discomfort associated with compressing the artery with the cuff.  It will 
last only a few seconds . 
 
Transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO
2) – Transcutaneous  oxygen pressure ( TcPO 2) is a 
measurement of how much oxygen reaches your skin .  It requires that a small device be placed 
on the skin for 15 – 20 minutes .  There is no pain or risk associated with this procedure.

  Page 67 of 90 Additional imaging study  – One to two hospitals in this study will be conducting an additional 
imaging test called magnetic resonance angiogram  (MRA).  This study is being done to 
determine how we ll blood is flowing through your legs.  An MRA is a type of magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) scan that uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio wave energy to 
provide pictures of blood vessels inside the body.  With MRA, both the blood flow and the 
condit ion of the blood vessel walls can be seen.   You will lie on your back on a table that is part 
of an MRI scanner.  Your leg may be held with straps to help you remain still.  The table will 
slide into a space that contains the magnet.  Some MRI machines (op en MRI) are now made so 
that the magnet does not surround the person being tested. Open MRI is less confining than a standard MRI but may not prov ide the same quality of image.  Inside the scanner, you may hear 
a fan and feel air moving.  You may also hear  tapping or thumping noises as the MRA scans are 
taken.  You may want to ask for ear plugs to reduce the noise.  If contrast material is needed, the 
technologist will put it in an IV in your arm. The material may be given over 1 to 2 minutes. Then more MRI  scans are done.  An MRA test usually takes 30 to 90 minutes but can take as 
long as 2 hours.  
 Visit # 1: Screening/Baseline Evaluations  
Screening is a process of evaluating your initial health status and assessing the status of your 
critical limb ischemia .  Screening is usually completed within one month before the first study 
injection s if you qualify for this study.  If you agree to take part in this research study, you will 
first sign this consent form, and then undergo screening.  Screening will involve the following 
procedures:  medical history, physical exam, medication review, questionnaire, assessment of critical limb ischemia , cancer screening, retinal fundoscopy; urine and blood  tests including a 
viral screen; ABI & TBI , TcPO
2, photograph and measurement of ulcer, pregnancy test (if you 
are a female), and 12 lead ECG.  
 
Please note:   If any of your viral test results are positive you may need to have a second test done 
to make sure the results are the same.  The doctor or his/her nurse will tell you  how to find 
medical help and counseling as needed, and you will not be able to take part in this study.  The 
study sponsor will not pay for the cost of the repeat tests, or any other follow -up medical care, or 
counseling for a positive or abnormal test re sult.   
 
It takes approximately one to two weeks to get all of the initial test results.  After your doctor has 
reviewed the results of these tests he/she will determine whether you are eligible for participation 
in the study.  If you are eligible for the study and you do wish to continue, you will be assigned 
by chance (randomly) to either one of the groups to receive VM202 (low or high dose) or the 
placebo control group.  You will then be scheduled for the first set of injections  which will be 
done at you r next visit (Visit #2).

  Page 71 of 90 Participation in this study requires you to make sure that you are available to attend all your 
scheduled visits .   
 
During your participation in the study you will be asked to report any unpleasant medical 
experiences that you may have.   
 
You must not use any additional prescription medication during the treatment period without 
first checking with your study doctor.  If you use any non -prescription medication you should 
inform your doctor of the details (medication, dose, etc.) at each study visit.   
 
You also must not participate in any other clinical trial while participating in this study.   
 
What about my rights to  decline participation or withdraw from the study? 
You may choose not to be in the study, or, if you agree to be in the study, you may withdraw from the study at any time.  If you withdraw from the study, no new data about you will be 
collected for study p urposes unless the data pertain to a  side effect related to the study.  If such 
an event occurs, we may need to review your entire medical record.   
 
Your decision not to participate or to withdraw from the study will not involve any penalty or 
loss of ben efits to which you are entitled, and will not affect your access to health care.  If you do 
decide to stop your participation in the study, you should talk to your doctor immediately so he/she can advise you of any additional tests that may be needed for y our safety.  Your doctor 
may decide to take you off this study if your condition gets worse, if you have serious side effects, or if he/she determines that it is no longer in your best interest to continue.  The Sponsor 
or regulatory agencies may stop this  study at anytime without your consent.  If this occurs, you 
will be notified and your study doctor will discuss with you other options you may have.   
 
What are the risks of this research study? 
There are known risks and discomforts involved in some of the tests and evaluations.  There are 
also unknown risks.  Below is a description of these risks.   Your doctor will discuss the risks 
and procedures with you before you start in the study.   
 
Risks from Injection Procedures  
VM202 will be injected into the calf muscles using a fine needle.  There may be some pain at the injection site at the time of injection.   There may be swelling, bruising or inflammation near the 
injection site.   You may experience an increase in the level of pain in the treated leg.  The re may 
be a risk of an allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), fever or tissue damage from the injection 
(ulceration, necrosis).  Because HGF has the potential to create new blood vessels 
(angiogenesis), there may be risk of promoting tumor growth (cancer)  or of increasing the 
number of blood vessels in the back of your eye and damaging your retina (retinopathy) .   
 
Risks to women who can get pregnant or are breastfeeding

  Page 72 of 90 Being a part of this study while pregnant may expose the unborn child to significant risks.  
Therefore, pregnant women cannot take part in this study.  If you are a woman who can get 
pregnant, a urine pregnancy test will be done and it must show that you are not pregnant before 
you can participate in this study.  You must also agree not to become pregnant during this study.  
You may not take part in this study if you are breastfeeding.  If sexually active, you must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control for the whole study.   
 
The following birth control measures are acceptable:  
• Barrie r type devices (examples are condom, diaphragm, and contraceptive sponge) used only 
in combination with a spermicide;  
• Intrauterine device (IUD);  
• Birth control pills  
• Depo -provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate);  
• Levonorgestrel implants;  
 Abstention, the rhyth m method, and/or contraception by the partner are not acceptable methods 
of contraception.   
 
If you do become pregnant during this study or think that you might be pregnant, you must 
inform your study doctor immediately.  If this happens, the study doctor  will discuss with you 
what you should do.  If you get pregnant, you will be asked to stop taking part in the study and you will be asked for information about the pregnancy and the baby.   
 
Risks from taking a blood sample  
You will have routine blood samples taken from a vein in your arm by a needle stick.  Risks associated with drawing blood from your arm include slight discomfort and/or bruising.  
Infection, bleeding, clotting, or fainting are also possible, although unlikely.  The number of 
times that you will have a blood sample drawn for this study totals about 12 times over 
approximately 13 months.  Each time your blood is drawn roughly 1 to 2 tablespoons of blood 
will be taken.   
 
Risks from cancer screening  
Cancer scr eening includes testing for cancer markers; pap smear and mammogram if not 
performed within past 12 months (females only); PSA (males only); for patients ≥50 years old, 
colonoscopy within past 10 years; current fecal occult blood test; and x -ray or CT scan  of chest.  
Possible risks include  a small amount of radiation exposure from a chest x -ray (or chest CT 
scan, if you have a history of smoking) and mammogram (if you are female), discomfort associated with pap smear and mammography (if you are female), an d risks associated with 
taking a blood sample (as described above).  Possible risks from colonoscopy may include:  bowel perforation (a hole or tear in the wall of the colon) requiring a repair operation (fewer than 
1 out of 1,000 tests), heavy or persistent bleeding from biopsy or polyp- removal sites (1 out of 
1,000 tests), adverse reaction to sedative medication causing breathing problems or low blood

vomitin g, bloating, or rectal irritation caused by medicines taken by mouth to cleanse the bowel.  
 
Risks from Retinal Fundoscopy  
The test itself involves no risk.  If dilating eye drops are used, they may produce a brief stinging sensation when put in the eyes a nd a medicinal taste in the mouth caused by the medication 
draining from the tear ducts into the throat.  Dilating eye drops rarely produce nausea, vomiting, 
dryness of the mouth, flushing, dizziness, or an attack of narrow -angle glaucoma.  If glaucoma is 
suspected, drops generally are not used.  
 
Risks from Fluorescein Angiography(if deemed necessary by the ophthalmologist)  
Side effects associated with injection of fluorescein dye into a vein in the arm include nausea 
and/or vomiting (approximately 5% of patients) hives and itching (approximately 0.5% of 
patients) and rarely, a life threatening allergic reaction, consisting of possible seizures and 
difficulty in breathing (less than 0.01%).  There may be a local temporary discomfort at the site 
of injectio n. 
 
Risks from ECG  
In rare circumstances, a rash or irritation at the location of the electrocardiogram electrode placement can occur due to the adhesive.  If this should occur it will be assessed and treated 
using clinical standards of care with appropriate medication(s) and/or compresses.  
 
Unknown risks  
In addition to the risks already described, there may be other discomforts or risks from this study drug and/or procedures that we do not know about.  You will be watched for signs and symptoms 
of any sid e effects and you should tell your doctor if you do not feel well or experience any 
unusual symptoms.   
 
 
Are there benefits to taking part in this research study? 
There may be no direct benefit to you by participating in this study.  However, it is possible that 
the pain related to your critical limb ischemia  will improve. Knowledge from this study may help 
us better understand how to treat people with critical limb ischemia .     
 
What if new information becomes available? 
If additional data regarding potential safety risks become available during the study, your 
research doctor will tell you about it and discuss with you whether you want to continue in the 
study.  If you decide to withdraw from the study, your research doctor will make arrangements 
for you r care to continue.  If you decide to continue in the study you may be asked to sign an 
updated consent form which will explain the new information clearly.

  Page 78 of 90 MRI Measurements  
 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): MRI will be used to quantify the changes in the blood flow 
and muscle mass of the treated leg. Both large vessel (>500 Mm) and capillary level blood flow 
(perfusion) will be evaluated.  
 
Safety screening:  All participants who undergo MRI scans that include contrast agent injections 
will be required to have normal kidney function. A measurement of glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) taken no earlier than 24 hrs prior to the contrast injection will be used to d etermine kidney 
function. No subject with GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 will be administered contrast agent. The 
staff nurse of the Northwestern University MRI research facility (CAMRI) where these scan are 
performed will perform point -of-care (iSTAT) to determine GFR on the same day as the MRI 
scan. MRI scans that do not required the administration of MRI contrast agent may be evaluated using the non- contrast MRI scans (i.e. to evaluate muscle mass). Prior to the visit, participants 
will be interviewed to ensure they do not have contraindications to MRI testing (presence of 
metal or electrical devices in their body, such as a cardiac pacemaker, defibrillation wires, or 
metal foreign objects).   
 
MRI Scan Protocol:  Participants will be positioned on the MRI table.  An intravenous catheter 
will be inserted into the arm for infusion of the gadolinium -based MRI contrast agent. A signal -
reception coil will be placed to cover the low leg of the participant. Cross -sectional images will 
be acquired along the length of the participant’s legs. These images will be acquired to cover 
from the knee to the mid -leg, covering the entire calf muscle.  
 
Calf Muscle Area  
2D T1 weighted single slice acquired at the mid -calf. The localization will be kept consistent by 
measuring a 2D sl ice located at a fixed distant from the top of the tibia. A 2.5 mm thick 
transverse image will be acquired at the point of maximal muscle cross -sectional area. The distal 
end of the tibia will be used to scan a point located 66% of the distance from the di stal to the 
proximal tibial. This point represents maximum muscle area on > 95% of individuals.  
 
Perfusion  
Calf muscle will be calculated using a standard imaging technique. A multi -phase interleaved, 
multi- echo MRI pulse sequence (SR -FLASH) and (IR -FLASH) will be acquired in conjunction 
with an injection of MRI contrast agent (0.1 mmol/kg b.w.). Two slices wil l be prescribed for 
this scan. They will be separated by 5 cm with the lower of the two sliced co -localized at the 
level of the muscle mass image. Immediately prior to the images acquisitions participants will be asked to perform 50 heel -rises in the MRI s canning area. They will do this by balancing against 
the wall with their fingertips and raising up and down on their toes once per second until they have complete 50 heel -rises, or are too tired to continue (whichever comes first).  
  
Angiography (Collateralization)  
Time -resolved MRA images will be acquired, following the perfusion scans in conjunction with 
a second, single dose injection of contrast agent (Gd -DTPA or equivalent). These will be 
acquired as a second, single dose (0.1 mmol/kg b.w.) c ontrast injection. A time -series of T1 
weighted, 3D Fast Low Angle Shot gradient -recalled will be acquired of the peripheral

VM202 - VM202 is supplied in a sterile glass vial containing 2.2 mg of lyophilized study 
product.  Before administration, it will be reconstituted with 4.4 mL of water for injection 
(WFI) for a final VM202 concentration of 0.5 mg / mL.  Each reconstituted vial is only to be 
used for one subject.  For the Low Dose treatment arm, t he final doses of 8 mg of VM202 
will be divided evenly between the Day 0 administration and the Day 14 administration , 
with the Day 28 and Day 42 injections consisting of normal saline (see description of 
normal saline below) .  The High Dose treatment arm will receive final dose s of 16 mg of 
VM202 divided evenly between the Day 0, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42 administrations.  Individual injections will be 0.5 mL.  All injections  will be 0.5 mL administered by 
intramuscular injections . 
 
Placebo  - Patients assigned to either the placebo arm or the Low Dose arm will receive 
normal saline injections.  The placebo group will receive only normal saline injections; the Low Dose arm will receive VM202 for the first two injection procedures (Day 0 and Day 
14), and then normal saline for the next two injection visits (Day 28 and Day 42).   Visually, 
normal saline is indistinguishable from reconstituted VM202.

Cancer  
 
The following cancer screening guidelines are recommended for those people at average risk for cancer (unless 
otherwise specified) and without any specific symptoms.  
People who are at increased risk for certain cancers may need to follow a different scree ning schedule, such as 
starting at an earlier age or being screened more often. Those with symptoms that could be related to cancer should 
see their doctor right away.  
Cancer -related Checkup  
For people aged 20 or older having periodic health exams, a can cer-related checkup should include health 
counseling, and depending on a person's age and gender, might include exams for cancers of the thyroid, oral cavity, 
skin, lymph nodes, testes, and ovaries, as well as for some non -malignant (non -cancerous) diseases.  
Special tests for certain cancer sites are recommended as outlined below.  
Breast Cancer  
 Yearly mammograms are recommended starting at age 40 and continuing for as long as a woman 
is in good health.  
 Clinical breast exam (CBE) should be part of a peri odic health exam, about every 3 years for 
women in their 20s and 30s and every year for women 40 and over.  
 Women should know how their breasts normally feel and report any breast change promptly to 
their health care providers. Breast self -exam (BSE) is an option for women starting in their 20s.  
 Women at high risk (greater than 20% lifetime risk) should get an MRI and a mammogram every 
year. Women at moderately increased risk (15% to 20% lifetime risk) should talk with their doctors about 
the benefits and limitations of adding MRI screening to their yearly mammogram. Yearly MRI screening is 
not recommended for women whose lifetime risk of breast cancer is less than 15%.  
Colon and Rectal Cancer  
Beginning at age 50, both men and women should follow 1 of thes e 5 testing schedules:  
 yearly fecal occult blood test (FOBT)* or fecal immunochemical test (FIT)  
 flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years  
 yearly FOBT* or FIT, plus flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years**  
 double -contrast barium enema every 5 years  
 colonoscopy every 10 years  
*For FOBT, the take -home multiple sample method should be used. **The combination of yearly FOBT or 
FIT flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years is preferred over either of these options alone.  
All positive tests should be followed  up with colonoscopy.  
People should talk to their doctor about starting colorectal cancer screening earlier and/or undergoing screening 
more often if they have any of the following colorectal cancer risk factors:  
 a personal history of colorectal cancer o r adenomatous polyps  
 a strong family history of colorectal cancer or polyps (cancer or polyps in a first -degree relative

 a personal history of chronic inflammatory bow el disease  
 a family history of an hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome (familial adenomatous polyposis or 
hereditary non- polyposis colon cancer)  
Cervical Cancer  
 All women should begin cervical cancer screening about 3 years after they begin having vagi nal 
intercourse, but no later than when they are 21 years old. Screening should be done every year with the 
regular Pap test or every 2 years using the newer liquid -based Pap test.  
 Beginning at age 30, women who have had 3 normal Pap test results in a row  may get screened 
every 2 to 3 years. Another reasonable option for women over 30 is to get screened every 3 years (but not more frequently) with either the conventional or liquid-based Pap test, plus the HPV DNA test. Women who have certain risk factors s uch as diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure before birth, HIV infection, or a 
weakened immune system due to organ transplant, chemotherapy, or chronic steroid use should continue to 
be screened annually.  
 Women 70 years of age or older who have had 3 or more normal Pap tests in a row and no 
abnormal Pap test results in the last 10 years may choose to stop having cervical cancer screening. Women with a history of cervical cancer, DES exposure before birth, HIV infection or a weakened immune system should continue to have screening as long as they are in good health.  
 Women who have had a total hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and cervix) may also choose to 
stop having cervical cancer screening, unless the surgery was done as a treatment for cervical cancer or pre -
cancer. Women who have had a hysterectomy without removal of the cervix should continue to follow the guidelines above.  
Endometrial (Uterine) Cancer  
The American Cancer Society recommends that at  the time of menopause, all women should be informed about the 
risks and symptoms of endometrial cancer, and strongly encouraged to report any unexpected bleeding or spotting to 
their doctors. For women with or at high risk for hereditary non -polyposis col on cancer (HNPCC), annual screening 
should be offered for endometrial cancer with endometrial biopsy beginning at age 35.  
Prostate Cancer  
Both the prostate -specific antigen (PSA) blood test and digital rectal examination (DRE) should be offered annually,  
beginning at age 50, to men who have at least a 10 -year life expectancy. Men at high risk (African -American men 
and men with a strong family of one or more first -degree relatives [father, brothers] diagnosed before age 65) should 
begin testing at age 45. Men at even higher risk, due to multiple first -degree relatives affected at an early age, could 
begin testing at age 40. Depending on the results of this initial test, no further testing might be needed until age 45.  
Information should be provided to all men about what is known and what is uncertain about the benefits, limitations, 
and harms of early detection and treatment of prostate cancer so that they can make an informed decision about 
testing.  
Men who ask their doctor to make the decision on their b ehalf should be tested. Discouraging testing is not 
appropriate. Also, not offering testing is not appropriate.

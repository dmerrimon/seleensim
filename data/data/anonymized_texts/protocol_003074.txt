1.  Purpose and objectives.           List the purpose and objectives:  
 
The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the symptomatic benefits of immunomodulatory treatment with 
IVIG for POTS (postural tachycardia syndrome) patients with evidence of autoimmunity.  
 
Specific aims:  
Our primary aim is to determine if treatment with IVIG (Gammunex -C) is superior to active placebo (intravenous 
albumin) in improving the symptoms of POTS.  
 
We propose a double-blind placebo controlled crossover pilot study of IVIG for the treatment of POTS. We will 
enroll subjects who meet the consensus criteria for POTS diagnosis (Sheldon et al. 2015) who have moderate to 
severe symptom burden and also have clinical or laboratory evidence of autoimmunity. 
Secondary aims are to determine if IVIG treatment improves objective clinical measures and to evaluate the utility 
of clinical and laboratory measures to identify patients most likely to respond to therapy

a. Background  
Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is the most common autonomic disorder (Low et al. 2009) with 
prevalence estimated at 170/100,000 in the United States (Schondorf et al. 1999). POTS appears to be a 
heterogeneous syndrome that can arise from multiple distinct mechanisms and has been divided into several subtypes based on these proposed mechanisms (Benarroch 2012). One subtype is referred to as neuropathic subtype which describes the group of POTS with evidence of peripheral denervation in their lower extr emities (Benarroch 2012). Evidence of peripheral nerve dysfunction can be detected on 
neurologic exam, through sudomotor testing and/or skin biopsy to evaluate intraepidermal small nerve fiber density. Within the neurogenic subgroup, a smaller subset may have an underlying autoimmune mechanism contributing to the development of both the neuropathy and POTS. These patients may report a preceding viral illness or other physiological stressor (such as immunization, pregnancy, injury, 
or minor surgery), may hav e elevated levels of one or more serum autoantibodies, co -existing

autoimmunity (Thieben et al. 2007). A review of 100 POTS patients showed that there was higher 
prevalence of autoimmune markers and co -morbid autoimmune disorders in POTS patients compared to 
the general population with 25% having positive ANA, 7% with antiphospholipid antibody and 20% with co -morbid autoimmune disorders (Blitshteyn 2015).  
 
Gammunex -C, a form of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), is approved for the treatment of chronic 
inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP) or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) (see 
attached package insert) .  IVIG has been in use for many decades in the treatment of these disorders and 
many other inflammatory/autoimmune diseases.  It is generally very safe and well tolerated.  More recently, IVIG has been proposed as an effective treatment for presumed inflammatory neurological disorders which do not meet the criteria for CIDP.  Specifically, case reports and cases series have indicated th erapeutic responses to IVIG in autonomic neuropathies.  (See Goodman, B. P. (2017). 
"Immunoresponsive Autonomic Neuropathy in Sjogren Syndrome- Case Series and Literature Review." 
Am J Ther doi: 10.1097/MJT.0000000000000583. and Oaklander, A. L. (2016). "Immunotherapy 
Prospects for Painful Small-fiber Sensory Neuropathies and Ganglionopathies." Neurotherapeutics  
13(1): 108-117). 
 Intravenous Albumin is approved for the treatment of hypovolemia (see attached package insert). The use of albumin to increase plasma volume in patients with POTS has been suggested. In this study, albumin will be used as an active control treatment to provide the same volume and protein load as IVIG but without the immunomodulatory effects.  Significance: There have been few well designed clinical therapy trials aimed at POTS patients and even fewer that are aimed at a particular pathophysiological subtype of POTS. Evidence suggests that POTS is a heterogeneous disorder with differing underlying mechanisms. Several uncontrolled case series have suggested a benefit of IVIG for POTS, but the volume expansion associated with infusion of IVIG make it dif ficult to assess the immunomodulatory effects of this treatment. We propose to 
evaluate the effi cacy of IVIG using a double-blind randomized cross over design that will determine 
efficacy while reducing effects of inter -subject variability and placebo effect which are common 
problems in POTS therapy research. Even with the statistical advantages of a crossover design, the treatment cohort will be small, and this study is designed to be a pilot (phase II) study to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability and potential benefits of treatment. The results of this pilot study will provide the impetus and rat ionale for a larger multicenter clinical trial to definitively evaluate immunomodulatory 
treatment in POTS.  
 
 
b. Current practice  
Currently there are no pharmacological treatments for POTS  that have proven efficacy in randomized 
controlled trials .

As standard of care evaluation of POTS, patients will be evaluated with autonomic testing, pupillometry, 
supine and standing catecholamine levels, serological testing, and standing vitals. Skin biopsy (for determination of intraepidermal nerve fiber density) can be included at the discretion of PI in selected cases, Standard of care autonomic testing includes Q SART testing, heart rate variability testing (via ECG), 
continuous blood pressure recording, Head Up Tilt Test, and pupil testing. Patients will also complete several surveys including COMPA SS-31, Quality of Life questionnaire and fatigue symptom score. 
 Those patients with clinical features of  autoimmunity will be eligible to enroll in the treatment study.  
Consenting patients will be assigned randomly to one of two groups.  Both groups will receive both IVIG and albumin infusions 
(0.4 gm/kg) . One group will receive IVIG infusions every week for 4 weeks then 
every 2 weeks for an additional 8 weeks (12 weeks total) followed by albumin infusions weekly for 4 weeks then every 2 weeks for 8 weeks (12 weeks total). There will be a 6 week washout and evaluation period between the treatment phases. The second group will receive albumin infusions first followed by IVIG infusions.   
We will be following the Aston infusion center IVIG solution Infusion order. Patients will receive premedication’s with  10mg of Cetirizine (Zyrtec) by mouth and 500 mg Acetaminophen (Tylenol) by 
mouth 30 min. (+/- 5 min) prior to infusion. After premedication and placement of peripheral IV, they will receive D5W 25 mL IV at 300 mL/hour (immediately before infusion). Then t he patients will receive 
study medication in a blinded fashion. The dose of medication will be 0.4 g/kg (either Gammunex-C, 10% or Albumin, 10%). The dose will be rounded to the nearest 5 grams, and the dose will remain constant for each of the 8 study infusions even if weight changes. Since albumin is packaged at a 20% solution, this drug will be diluted to 10% using D5W prior to infusion. The prepared study drug dose will be provided by the research pharmacist in packaging marked with the study subject identifier and infusion number but will have no identifiers to indicate the drug identity (infusion nurse, patient and study coordinator must remain blinded to the treatment assignment). Infusion rate will start at 0.6 ml/kg/hour and may be increased by 0.6 ml/kg/hour every 15 min as, tolerated, to a maximum infusion rate of 210 ml/hour. Subsequent infusion rates may be started at the tolerat ed rate. Start and stop times and infusion rates will 
be recorded in the study log. Vital signs will be recorded at the start and end of the infusion and at the time of any changes of infusion rate or clinical symptoms. Once the study infusion is complete, the infusion 
nurse will alert the study coordinator, and the coordinator will check on the patient for any emergent AEs.

STU2018- 0005, Vernino, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_3, 12 -11-19 (1) -copy   5 Post infusion, the intravenous catheter will be flushed with D5W 25 mL IV at 300 ml/hour and then the 
catheter will be removed. Once the coordinator check is complete the patient can be discharged.  
 
Neither the patient nor the examiner will know if they are receiving IVIG or albumin until after the study is over. Patients in the study will be asked to complete a diary entry every day during the duration of the study (includes fluid intake, minutes of exercise, daily symptom score, and perceived side effects). More detailed assessment will be made at beginning, mid -point washout and end of study with including stand 
test, supine and standing catecholamine levels, COMPASS-31, fatigue score, quality of li fe score and 
symptom scores. Skin biopsy will be repeated at the assessment if the biopsy was performed at baseline and was abnormal.  
 
Assessments will be made on days -1, 84, 111 and 196, with stand test, and supine and standing catecholamine levels. Symptom surveys COMPASS-31, Quality of Life questionnaire (SF-36), fatigue score, and symptoms score will be repeated at days -14, -1, 84, 98, 111, and 196. The VOSS score will be be performed at screening, baseline, all visits during the washout phase, and at final visit. The analysis will compare responses in the IVIG and placebo groups including individual comparisons between treatment and placebo and group comparisons. A specialized repeated measures analysis will be used to separate the 
effects of time, treatment and sequence of treatment in this cross -over design. 
 The primary outcome will be change in COMPASS-31 score (Sletten et al. 2012) (Rea, Campbell, and Cortez 2017). Because both treatments will expand plasma volume, we anticipate that both the IVIG and albumin groups will result in  improve ment  in the COMPASS -31 orthostatic intolerance (OI) subscore. 
Accordingly, w e will analyze the change in both the total COMPASS-31 scores and the score with the OI 
subscore removed.  
Secondary outcomes will be patient subjective responses, reported activity level and objective measures 
including orthostatic tachycardia, supine and standing catecholamine profiles and skin biopsy results (nerve fiber density). The randomized crossover design will help reduce the confounding factors of interindividual symptom reporting variability and confounding effect of activity level on symptoms and drug carryover from phase 1 to phase 2 of the study. We will subsequently perform post hoc analysis comp aring responders to non- responders to determine if baseline characteristics can identify subjects most 
likely to respond to this intervention. 
Our statistician will plan to perform an interim analysis after the first 10 subjects have completed 
treatment.   
 
The small sample size makes the study sensitive to patient drop out from intolerable side effects or 
inability to tolerate study design. Patient screening will include careful discussions of the importance of 
following study protocols. The study includes a 2 week baseline period during which the subjects will follow the study procedures related to daily diary entries to be certain that the y are compliant.

5.  Safety Precautions.  (Describe safeguards to address the serious risks listed above.)  
a.  Describe the procedures for protecting against or minimizing any potential risks for each of the more than minimal risk 
research procedures  listed above.  
Serious side effects of IVIG include renal dysfunction/failure, hemolysis, thrombosis, aseptic meningitis or allergic reactio n. 
Common transient side effects include headache, fatigue, chills, vomiting, back pain, pain, elevated body temperature, 
abdominal  pain, diarrhea, cough, stomach discomfort, chest pain, joint swelling, flu like illness. Each infusion will include 
standard pre-medications with acetaminophen and cetirizine, and prn medications will be available for headache or nausea at 
each infusion.  
 
Patients will be able to receive Ondansetron (Zofran) 4mg by mouth every 6 hours PRN for nausea or vomiting.  
 
Vital signs will be taken prior to infusion, at each change of medication, at every rate increase, and at the end of the infu sion 
medication.  
 
All infusions will take place in the CRU infusion unit with experienced and qualified nurses.  
 Safety labs will be checked on weeks 2, 8, 15 and 24 and include complete blood count (CBC) and complete metabolic panel (CMP). If patient develops a serious side effect or intolerable and persistent common side effect during the treatment phase,  
infusion will be stopped and they will be considered a treatment failure for that part  of the study. If this occurs during Part 1 of 
the cross -over treatment, these subjects will be allowed to start part 2 after week 12.  
 
b.  Where appropriate, discuss provisions for ensuring necessary medical or professional intervention in the event of adverse 
events, or unanticipated problems involving subjects.  
Physicians/PI will be available by pager 24/7 and on site during the research infusions. In the case of a serious side effect, 
subjects will be immediately directed to the appropriate nearest emergency facility. 
 If the subjects reports any of the following symptoms the infusion nurse will contact the coordinator. Nausea/vomiting, 
flushing, headache, lightheadedness, and dizziness. The coordinator will inform the PI.

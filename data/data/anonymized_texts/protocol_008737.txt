1. Background and study rationale  
In mid -March 2020, the University of Pennsylvania Hospital System (UPHS) instituted a series of 
initiatives to expand in -patient capacity for a surge of COVID -19 patients and to reduce the risk of 
transmission of COVID -19 from  in-person visits. These efforts resulted in a 90 % reduction in surgical 
procedures and 80% reduction in outpatient visits to UPHS sites. With the stabilization of COVID -19 
cases within UPHS, plans are underway to resume surgical procedures and in -person visits. However, a 
recent national survey showed t hat only 15% of patients would be comfortable entering a local hospital 
for a medical procedure immediately after COVID -19 restrictions were lifted. Major concerns included 
risk of getting COVID -19 from other patients, lack of appropriate cleaning procedur es, lack of protective 
equipment, and medical costs. For many patients, a delay in diagnosis, treatment or preventive care will 
result in irreversible adverse health consequences that pose a greater risk to the patient than the risk of 
acquiring COVID -19 through a healthcare encounter. In addition, reluctance to return for in -person care 
may vary by level of education and race, magnifying existing health disparities.  
 We hypothesize that the use of established communication strategies shown in previous stu dies 
to be effective in behavioral change will increase the percentage of patients who present for in -person 
visits , compared with standard UPHS patient communications.   We also hypothesize that mailed letters 
will be more effective than messages  through t he electronic health record  (EHR) , irrespectiv e of the 
content.  
 
2. Study objectives  
2.1 Primary objective s 
1. To compare two letters whose content has  different approaches to  patient communication on the 
percentage of contacted patients who have an in -person visit or procedure at a UPHS site . 
2. To compare distribution of letter content via a message through the EHR to a mailed letter on the 
percentage of contacted patients who have an in -person visit or procedure at a UPHS  site. 
 
2.2 Secondary objective s 
To compare each of these  approaches to  patient communication on the following secondary outcomes:  
2 
 • Percent age of patients who schedule a visit 
• Percentage of patients who complete a telemedicine visit  
• Percentages o f patients who have each outcome stratified  by age, sex, race, ethnicity, income 
(estimated from zip code) , type of insurance, and primary encounter service line  
 
3. General design  
Randomized, double -blind, factorial design of intervention lette r vs. standard of care  letter and EHR vs 
mail delivery mechanism  
 
3.1 Intervention  and control  
Preparations are currently underway to inform UPHS patients that the hospitals and practices are open 
to patients who have previously cancelled  or postponed medical visits and procedures due to the 
emergence of COVID -19.  We expect this message to function as the control message in our trial.  The 
intervention message will modify this control message using an “inoculation strategy” in which patie nts’ 
perceived threats to safety are acknowledged and addressed early in the message. In addition, it will be 
personalized based on whether the patient is less than 65 years of age or 65 years of age or older.  
Informational equivalence  and word count  will be maintained  between control and interven tion 
messages .  
 
3.2 Randomization  
10% no extra communication vs. 90% extra communication  
Within the group who have extra communication:  
1:1 Standard UPHS message vs. customized message  
1:1 EHR vs. mail for patients with EHR message capability; mail only for those without EHR message 
capability  
Randomization will occur at the level of the patient.  
 
 
 
3.3 Primary study endpoint  
The percentage of contacted patients who have an in -person v isit or procedure at a UPHS site, including 
an inpatient or outpatient procedure or an in -person outpatient visit , within 1 month of contact.   
 
3.4 Secondary study endpoints  
The percentage of patients who schedule a visit within 1 month of contact.  
The percent age of patients who complete a telemedicine visit within 1 month of contact.

4 Study population  
4.1 Major inclusion criteria  
Patient s with a cancellation or failure to show for a procedure or visit from  March 9, 2020 through June 
7, 2020 (90 days) and who have not rescheduled as of the date of randomization  
All patients were scheduled patients in one of two service lines: Heart & Vascular  and Orthopaedics .  
 
4.2 Major exclusion  criteria  
Death  
 
5. Study procedures  
All patient lists will be generated and transferred behind Penn’s firewall. A list of service line providers 
will be generated for each service line and given to an analyst at the Penn Data Analytics Center (DAC). 
For each service line, a  list o f patients will be generated who had a visit scheduled to occur with a 
service line provider from March 9, 2020 through June 7, 2020 (90 days) that was missed (cancelled or 
no show) and not rescheduled as of the date of the search.  A separate list will be  generated for patients 
who have accessed myPennMedicine (MPM) within the past 6 months. By service line, 10% of all 
patients who have accessed MPM in the past 6 months will be excluded from receiving an extra 
communication. The remaining 90% will be rando mized to MPM or mail. Those randomized to MPM will 
be randomized to sending letter A (standard letter) or letter B /C (customized letter). The customized 
letter delivered will differ between those aged below 65  (letter B)  and age 65 years or above  (letter C ). 
For those age 65 years or above, the line “You are in an age group where you may have specific 
concerns about your safety in returning for a visit.” will be included. A PennChart analyst will design the 
code to send the MPM letters (A, B, or C) in bulk from each service line for those randomized to MPM 
distribution, according to randomization status.  
 
Two additional lists of randomized patients and addresses will be generated , by service line :  
1. MPM users who were randomized to receive a mailed letter, who will be  randomized to letter A 
or letter B/C.   
2. Non -MPM users,  who will be  randomized to letter A or letter B/C  after excluding 10% as a 
control group.  
 
AE Litho, which is used by Penn Medicine for mailing letters for the marketing department , will receive 
each randomization list for patients receiving letters and will mail the letters (A, B, or C) according to 
service line and letter assignment. The letters will not contain the patient name, pro vider name, patient 
diagnosis, or any protected health information.  
 
Outcome data and data for stratified analyses will be extracted from PennChart by a DAC analyst , 
deidentified, and compiled into an analytic dataset.  
 
5. Statistical plan  
Planned enrollme nt: We estimate that we will include a minimum of 3,000 patients from each service 
line, for a minimum sample size of 6,000 .  
 
Power calculation: We estimate that 20% of the control group will reschedule. We estimate that we will  
have  90% power to detect a  2% absolute difference between letter A and letter B/C and with 50% active 
MPM use, a 4% absolute difference between MPM and a mailed letter.  
  
We will use a chi-square d test to compare outcomes between groups  based on randomization (inten tion 
to treat) . Additional analyses will be stratified by age (< or ≥ 65 years ), sex, race, ethnicity, income 
4 
 (estimated from zip code), type of insurance  (commercial, Medicaid, Medicare, or none) , and service 
line.  
 
6. Risks and benefits  
All members of the resear ch team have completed CITI human subjects research training. Confidentiality 
risk will be minimized by deidentifying information after a clinical informatics analyst  at the Penn Data 
Analytics Center  extract s the outcome  data from PennChart.   
 
7. Informed  consent  
We are requestin g a waiver of informed consent  since this is low risk and impossible to evaluate with 
informed consent .

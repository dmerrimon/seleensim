Title:
A Randomized, Double- Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of 
Nem olizumab (CD14152) in Subjects with Moderate -to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis 
Investigational Product :
Nem olizumab (CD14152)
IND Number:
117122
Study Centers:
Approxim ately 150 study centers are planned in Europe, America s, and Asia -Pacific .
Phase:
3
Objectives:
Primary objective :The primary objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of nemolizumab (CD14152) 
after a 16-week treatment period in adult and adolescent subjects with moderate -to-severe atopic 
dermatitis ( AD)not adequately controlled with topical treatments.
Secondary objective :The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of maintenance 
treatment with nemolizumab (CD14152) for up to an additional 32 weeks.
Study Design:
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter, parallel -group study in adult and 
adolescent subjects w ith moderate -to-severe AD. Eligible subjects must have a documented history of 
inadequate response to topical AD medication (s).
Approximate ly 750 total subjects will be randomized (2:1) to receive either nemolizumab (CD14152) 
or placebo , stratified by baseline disease severity (Investigator ’sGlobal Assessment [IGA];moderate :
IGA =3; severe: IGA = 4) and peak pruritus numeric rating scale ( PP NRS )severity (PPNRS ≥7; 
PPNRS < 7).A minimum of 2 50 subjects will be ran domized in each PPNRS strata .Clinical 
responders at Week 16 (ie, the end of initial treatment/beginning of maintenance) will be re-
randomized (1:1:1) to different treatment regimens (injections every  4 weeks [ Q4W]orevery 8 weeks 
[Q8W]of nemolizumab [CD14152 ]or placebo Q4W ). 
Subjects will apply  a moisturizer at least once daily , beginning at screening . Subjects will also be 
provided or prescribed background topical therapy for AD (including a medium -potency topical 
corticosteroid [TCS]for the body and a low-potency TCS or topical calcineurin inhibitor (TCI) for 
sensitive areas such as the face, neck, intertriginous areas, etc for use throughout the study. If deemed to 
be medically necessary by the investigator (eg, to control intolerable AD signs /symptoms), rescue 
therapies can be prescribed to the subjects during the study ,except during the run-in period (ie, at least 
2 weeks [14 days] before Day 1 /baseline ).

CONFIDENTIALThe study consist sof 4 periods over approximately 60 weeks : screening (including run -in), initial 
treatment , maintenance, and follow -up(unless the subject is a non- respon derat Week 16 , at which 
theirparticipation could last up to 28 w eeks). Refer to Figure 1 for an overview of the treatm ent/study
design.
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will review and monitor subject safety throughout 
the study , and an independent adjudication committee ( IAC) w ill review all asthma -related events 
throughout the study . Details on the IDMC and IAC, including the plan of analysis for outputs ;the 
composition of the committees ;andthe procedures, roles, responsibilities ,and communications are 
provided in the respective IDMC and IAC charter s.
Screening Period (Screening to Initial Randomization/ Baseline)
The screening period (approximately 2-4 weeks before planned Day 1/baseline ) will evaluate subject 
eligibility and introduce standardized background topical therapy over a run -in period of at least 2 weeks 
(ie, 14 days )before Day 1/baseline .
Initial Treatment Period ( Baseline/Day 1 to Week 16 Pre-dose)
The initial treatment period is defined as Day 1 /baseline through Week 16(before the Week 16dose,
with last dose at Week 12).Eligible subjects w ill be randomized in a ratio of 2:1 at b aseline to receive 
subcutaneous injections of nemolizumab (CD14152) or placebo Q4W .
Subjects will continue to use b ackground topical therapy ,which should be adjusted according to the 
disease activity and tolerability, including tapering when signs and symptoms improve, discontinuation 
when lesions clear, and restarting if signs and symptoms recur, based on investigator clinical judgment.

Clinical assessments will occur according to the schedule of assessments through the Week 16visit (see 
Section 8.1.2 ).Subjects who are clinical responders at Week 16will continue to the maintenance period .
Subjects who are non-responders at Week 16 may be eligible to enroll into along-term extension (LTE) 
study (Protocol 118163). Subjects who require rescue therapy for clinical worsening of AD before Week 
16 may also be considered for the LTE study but will be required to continue with study visits until the 
Week 16 visit. The follow -up visit is not required for subjects who participate in the LTE study.
Subjects who decline or are not eligible to enter into the LTE study will complete a follow -up visit 12
weeks after their last study drug injection.
Subjects who discontinue the initial treatment period prem aturely should complete an early termination
(ET) visit and a follow -up visit 1 2weeks after the last study drug injection . 
Initial treatm ent period results maybe analyzed after all subjects have either completed the 
Week 16 visit or have withdrawn or been discontinued from the study before Week 16.To

Maintenance Period ( Re-Randomization: Week 16toWeek 48)
The maintenance period is defined as Week 16(maintenance baseline) toWeek 48. All nemolizumab
(CD14152) -treated subjects (ie, group 1) who are clinical responders at Week 16will be re- randomized 
(1:1:1) to study medication , as follows: g roup 1A,nemolizumab (CD14152) 30mg Q4W ; group 1B,
nemolizumab 30 mg Q8W ;or group 1C ,placebo Q4W.
Clinical responders are defined as : 
IGA of 0 (clear )or 1 (almost clear) at Week 16
OR
Eczem a Area and Severity Index (EASI )-75at Week 16
All placebo -treated subjects (ie, subjects in group 2 from theinitial treatment period ) who responded to 
placebo during the initial treatment period will continue to receive placebo Q4W in the maintenance 
period . 
Subjects who receive rescue therapy will be considered non -responders.
Based on the phase 2b results (Protocol 114322), it is estimated that 15% of subjects will drop out from 
the initial treatment period. Assuming a 45% responder rate in active treatment and 12% with placebo, 
approximately 216subjects will participate in the maintenance period (190 nemolizumab and 26 placebo 
subjects).

Beginning at Week 16, subjects in group 1A will receive active (ie, nemolizumab [CD14152 ]) study drug 
injections Q4W up to Week 44. Subjects in group 1Bwill receive active study drug injections Q8W, 
with placebo at alternating visits to maintain the blind. Group 1B subjects will receive the last active
study drug injection at Week 40(final injection at Week 44will be placebo) . Group 1C subjects will 
receive placebo Q4W (ie, through Week 44 ).
Subjects should continue the same background topical therapy usedin the initial treatment period 
leading up to the Week 16visit, including tapering or complete cessation ( no use ), if applicable. 
Throughout the maintenance period , adjustments to background topical therapy , as determined by the 
investigator, are permitted based on the subject’s clinical response.
Prim ary maintenance effect will be evaluated based on Week 48 assessments .All maintenance 
endpoints will be analy zed independently from each pivotal study and by using pooled data after the 
completion of both trials.

CONFIDENTIALSubjects requiring rescue therapy before the Week 32visit must undergo arequired wait period (with 
continu edstudy visits) until the Week 32 visit, at which time they may be considered for LTE
eligibility /participation .Thereafter, no wait period is required. 
Subjects who complete the Week 48visit may be eligible to enroll into the LTE study (Protocol 118163). 
Subjects requiring rescue medication before the Week 48 visit may be considered for LTE eligibility.
The follow -up visit is not required for subjects who participate in the LTE study .
Subjects who decline or are not eligible for the LTE study will be asked to complete the follow -up visit.
Subjects who discontinue the maintenance period prematurely should complete an ETvisit and a follow -
up visit 12weeks after the last study drug injection . 
Follow -up 
The follow -up visit will be conducted 12weeks after the last study drug injection for subjects who 
decline or are not eligible to enter the LTE study. (Twelve weeks corresponds to approximately 5 half-
lives when nemolizumab 30 mg is dosed subcutaneously Q4W .)The follow -up visit is not required for 
subjects who participate in the LTE study.
Number of Subjects: 
Approximately 750total subjects are planned to be randomized , including a minimum of 130
adolescent subjects aged 12 to 17 years.
Treatm ent:
Nem olizumab (CD14152) or placebo w ill be provided as lyophilized pow derfor solution for injection
for subcutaneous use only after reconstitution in a single -use, pre -filled, dual -chamber syringe (DCS) .
During the initial treatment period, e ligible subjects w ill be randomized to receive either 30 mg of 
nemolizumab (CD14152) in group 1 or placebo in group 2, administered as a subcutaneous injection 
only after reconstitution Q4W for 16 weeks (last injection at Week 12), with a loading dose of 60 mg 
on Day 1 /baseline . 
Subjects (and/or their caregivers) will have the option to self- inject study drug while at the study center 
under staff supervision. Subjects (and/or their caregivers) willbe trained on injecting the study drug at 
Day 1 and will be allow ed to inject study drug at all subsequent visits, while at the study center, under 
staff supervision. If the subject (and/or caregivers) isunwilling to perform the injections, study staff c an 
administer study drug at each visit.
Inthe maintenance period , group 1 subjects who are clinical responders will be re -randomized to 
receive either 30 mg of nemolizumab (CD14152) or placebo for 32 w eeks. Subjects in g roup 1A will 
receive a subcutaneous injection of nemolizumab Q4W (last injection at Week 44); group 1B will 
receive an injection of nemolizumab Q8W, with alternating placebo Q8W (last active injection at Week 
40andlast placebo injection at W eek 44); and group 1C w ill receive placebo Q4W . Subjects in group 2 
who are clinical responders will continue to receive placebo Q4W. 
Moisturizer
Subjects will apply a moisturizer at least once daily, and liberally as needed, to dry skin and AD lesions 
beginning at screening, and throughout the study. The subjects’ current moisturizer or a moisturizer 
recommended by the investigator may be used. To allow  for accurate assessment of skin dryness, use 
should not occur within 8 hours before each clinic/office visit. Whenever possible, subjects should use 
the same moisturizer throughout the study.

CONFIDENTIALBackground topical therapies
Subjects will be provided or prescribed authorized background topical therapy for use during the study, 
beginning at screening :
Medium -potency TCS therapy for non-sensitive areas :Subjects will apply the authorized medium -
potency TCS background therapy in areas of the body  where use of medium -potency TCS is 
considered safe (eg, trunk and extremities) ,beginning within the screening period and ≥14 days 
before Day 1(ie, run-in).Refer to the current version of the pharmacy manual for a listing of 
permitted medium -potency TCS medications that are commercially available in planned countries.
Low-potency TCS or TCI therapy for sensitive areas: Subjects will apply an authorized background 
therapy (ie, low -potency TCS or TCI) to areas of the body considered TCS -sensitive (eg, face, neck, 
intertriginous areas) or in cases where medium -potency TCS is not tolerated , beginning within the 
screening period and ≥ 14 days before Day 1(ie, run-in).The investigator may select either low-
potency TCS or TCI for each subject, per investigator discretion. The subject may only apply  one
medication to each affected area; concomitant use of low -potency TCS and TC I on the same lesion 
is not permitted. Refer to the current version of the pharmacy manual for a listing of permitted low-
potency TCS and TCI medications that are commercially available in planned countries.
Subjects will apply a thin layer of authorized background topical therapy on all AD lesions at a 
frequency that is necessary to ensure disease stability and prevent AD flare but which does not exceed 
the daily frequency recommended in the product labeling . Refer to the current version of the pharmacy 
manual for the authorized topical medications and perm itted daily frequency of use.“As needed” 
(PRN) use of TCS or TCI is not permitted. Only topical therapies specifically provided or prescribed 
for use in this study are permitted.
Background therapy useshould be adjusted to the disease activity and tolerability ofthe subject, 
including tapering when signs and symptoms improve ,discontinuation when lesions clear, and 
restarting if signs and symptoms recur , at the discretion of the investigator.
Rescue Therapies
If deemed to be medically necessary by the investigator ( eg, to control intolerable AD signs/symptoms ), 
rescue therapies can be prescribed to the subjects at any time during the study except during the run-in 
period. Subjects receiving rescue therapies during the run-in period are not eligible to participate in the
study. 
As a general guideline and per individual investigator judgment, rescue therapy should not be prescribed 
within the first 2 weeks after baseline (ie, Week 2) to allow  a minimum  time for study drug exposure in 
the presence of background therapy. 
Investigator assessments of efficacy should be performed before initiating rescue therapy. Subjects 
requiring rescue therapy between scheduled visits should return to the clinic (unscheduled visit) for 
investigator assessment of efficacy before starting rescue therapy.
Rescue treatments are only treatments that directly treat AD (mainly those that are approved or are 
standard of care) and include topical and systemic treatments as outlined. R escue therapies include:
Higher potency of TCS ( equivalent to class I-II accor ding to the U nited Statesclassification)2
Oral corticosteroids
Biologics (including their biosimilars)
Systemic nonsteroidal immunosuppressants /immunomodulators
Phototherapy

CONFIDENTIALAntihistamines, sleep aids, topical and systemic antibiotics , and anti-itch creams are notconsidered to 
be rescue therapy because they do not directly treat AD.
Whenever possible, investigators should first use topical medications as rescue therapy before escalating 
to systemic therapies. If subjects receive topical treatments or phototherapy as rescue therapy, study drug 
administration should be continued unless there is a safety concern according to the investigator’s 
judgment. If subjects receive systemic rescue therapy, the study drug administration must be perm anently 
discontinued .
Study Duration:
The expected duration for e ach subject’s participation in the study depends on the clinical response and
may be:
Up to 28weeks (including a 4-week screening period, a 16-week initial treatment period and a n 8-
week follow -up period [12-week s after thelast study medication injection ]) forsubjects who are 
non-responders at the completion of the initial treatment period (Week 16)
Up to 60 weeks (including a 4 -week screening period, a 16-week initial treatment period, a 32 -
week maintenance period ,and a n 8-week follow -up period [ 12-weeksafter thelast study 
medication injection ])in subjects who are clinical responders at the completion of the initial 
treatment period (Week 16)
The 12 -week follow -up visit is not required for subjects who w ill continue in the LTE study (Protocol 
118163).
Study Population:
Inclusion Criteria : To be eligible for study entry, subjects must satisfy all of t he following inclusion 
criteria.
1.Male or female subjects aged ≥12 years at the screening visit. 
Note: Enrollment of subjects aged 12 to 17 years has been opened after theIDMC has assessed 
interim safety data from the phase 2 study ( Protocol 116912) and provided recomme ndations to the 
sponsor ,who then determine dthe eligibility of this age group for enrollment in the study .The 
sponsor senta written communication to the site confirming that the study is open for enrollment of 
adolescents. Adolescents could not be enrolled in the study until such communication wa s received.
2.Chronic AD for at least 2 years before the screening visit, and confirmed according to American 
Academy of Dermatology Consensus Criteria (Appendix 1 )2at the time of the screening visit . 
3.EASI score ≥ 16 at both the screening and baseline visits .

5.AD involvement ≥10% of body surface area (BSA) at both thescreening and baseline visits .
6.Peak (maximum) pruritus NRS score of at least 4 .0at the screening and baseline visit.
Screening PP NRS score will be determ ined by a single PP NRS assessment (score ranging from 0 
to 10) for the 24 -hour period immediately preceding the screening visit.
Baseline PP NRS score will be determined based on the average of daily PP NRS scores (score 
ranging from 0 to 10) during the 7 days immediately preceding baseline (round ing is not perm itted) . 
A minimum of 4 daily scores out of the 7 days immediately preceding baseline is required for this 
calculation.

CONFIDENTIAL7.Documented recent history (within 6 months before the screening visit) of inadequate response to 
topical medications (TCS with or w ithout TCI) . All subjects must demonstrate inadequate 
response to TCS. All subjects who have used TCI within 6 months of the screening visit ,or for 
whom TCI is selected as background therapy for sensitive areas ,must also demonstrate inadequate 
response to TCI. Acceptable documentation includes patient records with information on TCS 
(with or w ithout TCI) prescription and treatment outcome, or written documentation of the 
conversation with the subject’s treating physician , if different than the investigator. 
Inadequate response to TCS treatments (with or w ithout TCI) is defined as:
7a.Failure to achieve o r maintain remission or low  disease activity (equivalent to IGA ≤ 2) despite 
treatment with a regimen of a medium -, high -,or very high-potency TCS (Class I -III according 
to the US classification)2(with or without TCI) , applied for at least 4 weeks or for the maximum 
duration per prescribing information ;
or
7b. Requirement of a long -term treatment (> 4 weeks) with a high -or very high -potency TCS (Class 
I-II according to the US classification)2(with or without TCI) to achieve or maintain remission 
or low  disease activity (equivalent to IGA ≤ 2);
or 
7c. If document ation of inadequate response to topical treatments is not available, subjects with a 
documented recent course of systemic treatment or phototherapy for AD (within 6 months 
before the visit) willalso beconsidered as inadequate responders to topical treatments .
If documentation is inadequate, subjects may be re- screened after such documentation is obtained .
8.Agree to apply a moisturizer throughout the study from the screening visit; agree to apply authorized 
topical therapy from the screening visit and throughout the study as determined appropriate by the 
investigator .
9. Fem ale subjects of childbearing potential (ie, fertile, following menarche and until becoming post-
menopausal unless permanently sterile) must agree either to commit to true abstinen cethroughout 
the study and for 12 w eeks after the last study drug injection ,when this is in line with the preferred 
and usual lifestyle of the subject, or to use an adequate and approved method of contraception 
throughout the study and for 12 w eeks after the last study drug injection. This criterion also applies 
to a prepubertal female subject who begins menses during the study. *In Germany only, i f a 
subject has reached Tanner stage 3 br east development, even if not h aving menarche, the subject 
will be considered a female of childbearing potential .
Adequate and approved methods of contraception applicable for the subject and/or herpartner are 
defined below:
Progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception
Com bination of male condom w ith cap, diaphragm ,or sponge with spermicide (double barrier 
methods) (*In Germ any only, double barrier methods are notconsidered ahighly effective
method of contraception)
Note: “Double barrier methods” refers to simultaneous use of a physical barrier by each partner. 
Use of a single barrier method (eg, condom) together with a spermicide is not acceptable.
Com bined (estrogen -and progestogen -containing) oral, intravaginal, or tran sdermal hormonal 
contraception
Injectable or implanted hormonal contraception
Intrauterine devices or intrauterine hormone -releasing system

CONFIDENTIALPrimary Endpoint :
The 2co-primary endpoints will be analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted for 
randomiz edstratification variable s (IGA severity and PP NRS).
Key Secondary E ndpoints :
All key secondary endpoints will be analyzed similar to the analysis of prim ary endpoint using a stratified 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test.
Secondary Endpoints during Initial Period
Binary endpoints will be analysed with the same method as prim ary endpoint using non-responder 
imputation.
Continuous and QoL endpoints will be analy zed using an analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA) including 
treatment group and randomization stratification factors as factors and appropriate baseline values as a 
covar iate,if applicable. Missing values will be imputed using MI under MAR assumption. In addition, 
EASI, PP NRS, BSA and SCORAD will be analyzed using a mixed -effect mod el for repeated measures 
(MMRM) approach, including terms of treatment group, stratification factors, and appropriate baseline 
values. An unstructured covariance will be used to model the within -patient errors in the analysis. A 
linear contrast will be used, within the MMRM framework, to estimate difference between nemolizumab
and placebo. Treatment difference betw een nemolizumab and placebo will be estimated along with 
associated 95% confidence intervals.
Secondary Endpoints during Maintenance Period
All s econdary endpoints during the maintenance period w ill be descriptively summarized .
Multiplicity Adjustment: 
The primary comparison of interest is nemolizumab 30mg compared to placebo for theco-prim ary 
endpoints in both population s(baseline PP NRS 4; baseline PP NRS 7). 
To control the type I error at 5% significance level, a serial gatekeeping approach will be implemented. 
The co-primary endpoints will be tested at 2.5% significance level for each population. If both co-prim ary 
endpoints are statistically significant at 2.5% significance level, the key secondary endpoints will be 
tested sequentially following hierarchical testing procedure using the pre-specified order of endpoints 
for each population. The comparisons for key secondary endpoints will be made sequentially, and the 
subsequent tests will be stoppedwhen no statistical difference is found.
Other secondary endpoint comparisons will not be adjusted for multiplicity.
Sample Size
To achieve at least 90% pow er for both co-primary endpoint sat 2.5% significance level, 1 50 subjects 
per group w ill be required to detect the following differences between treatment gr oups for 2co-
primary endpoints with 1:1 randomization ratio, assuming 15% dropout rate during the initial treatment 
period.
With a 2:1 randomization, 180 subjects in nemolizumab and 90 subjects in placebo w ill be required to 
detect the differences in both co-prim ary endpoints to achieve 90% pow er.
IGA Success: To detect a difference of 18%, assuming IGA response for nemolizumab 30% and 
placebo 1 2%at Wee k 16.
EASI- 75 Response: To detect a difference of 30%, assuming EASI -75 response for nemolizumab 4 9% 
and placebo 1 9%at Week 16 .

CONFIDENTIAL6INTRODUCTION
6.1 B ackground & Rationale
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease estimated to occur in 
10% to 20% of the population1and up to 25% of children.2The disease is 
characterized b y pruritus (itching), xerosis (skin dryness) ,and eczematous lesions 
whose features include erythema, infiltration/papulation, oozing with crusting, 
excoriations, and lichenification. Approximately  60% of A D patients have another 
concomitant atopic condition (eg, asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy ) and AD often 
constitutes the first step of atopic march (progression from 1 atopic disease to 
another). Although not a life-threatening disease, AD has a mar ked negative impact 
on patients’ quality oflife (QoL), and depression and anxiety  have been reported as 
comorbidities in AD patients.3Existing litera ture suggest that the prevalence of AD is 
highest in young children and graduall y reduces with age. Prevalence is higher in 
developed countries.
The overall lifetime prevalence of AD has increased over the past 30 years .2In most 
countries ,there has been an increase in AD prevale nce over a 5 -to 10 -year period .4In 
the United States (US) , the prevalence of AD in children has been reported between 
10% and 13% in 2 studies.5,6Many  environmental and geographic factors were shown 
to contribute to incidence rate and severity  in both studies. These variables included 
urban living, household income, par ental education level, and race.
The majority  of AD cases can be regarded as “mild”, with 10% to 20% of patients 
suffering from severe eczematous skin lesions, although the percentage of individuals 
experiencing severe disease appears to be higher in the a dult AD population.7Whereas 
the prevalence of moderate -to-severe AD is up to 71% in adults suffering from AD, the 
prevalence of moderate and severe ADin children with AD was found to be 14% and 
2%, respectivel y.8Evaluation of AD data collected through the US 2007 National 
Survey  of Children’s Health showed that 67% of pediatric AD patients had mild
disease , 26% had moderate disease , and 7% had severe disease, which translates to 
approximately  5.6, 2.2, and 0.6 million US children, re spectivel y.6
The clinical manifestations of AD vary with age.9The eczematous changes and its 
morphology  are seen in different locations, depending on the age of the patient ( child, 
adolescent, or adult ).
Atopic dermatitis oc curs in 3 main age -related stages10that may  be separated by  
periods of remission or overlap: the first, the infantile stage up to age 2 y ears, is 
typified b y highl y pruritic, red, scal y, crusted, and sometimes weeping patches on 
both cheeks and on the extensor parts of the extremities. Eczematous changes of the 
scalp and wheal formation may  also be seen. The diaper area is generally  spared ,and

CONFIDENTIALearly infantile ADmay be difficult to distinguish from seborrheic dermatitis on 
clinical grounds alone. The childhood stage from 2 y ears to 12 y ears shows papulation 
rather than exudation and occurs in the flexural areas, especially  the antecubital and 
popliteal fossae, the volar aspect of the wrists, ankles, and neck. Thickened plaques 
show lichenification and excoriation. I n the adult stage, from puberty  onward, patients 
may have had few or no skin problems since infancy  or may  have suffered a chronic 
relapsing course with periods of remis sion. L ichenification occur ringin the flexural 
areas and facial involvement is common, especially  the forehead and periorbital 
regions. The wrists, hands, ankles, feet, fingers, and toes are often involved.
The cause of AD, although still not completely  understood, is probabl y multifactorial 
and involves complex interrelation between susceptib ilitygenes, immunological 
factors, infections, and environmental factors to produce a skin barrier disturbance as 
well as immunologic d ysregulation and inflammation.11Abnormal protein (filaggrin 
and related proteins) and lipid (ceramide) metabolism may  also play  a key  role. Upon 
stimulation with allergens, dendritic cells in the skin stimulate ty pe 2 helper T cells
(Th2) and cause the subsequent release of pro- inflamma tory cytokines, including 
interleukin (IL) -4, IL -5 and IL -13. High levels of Th2 cy tokines in AD skin increase 
serine protease, which leads to further skin barrier dy sfunction, and IL -31, which 
leads to pruritus and further inflammation and barrier d ysfunction.12,13The 
pathophy siology  also involves Th1 cells in the chronic phase of AD. Involvement of 
Th17 and Th22 cells in AD pathogenesis has been more recentl y reported.14Of note, 
non-lesional skin alread y shows signs of subclinica l inflammation with increased 
numbers of Th2 cells, Th22 cells, and to a lesser degree, Th17 cells, and a pro -
inflammatory  cytokine milieu.15
The scratch ing behavior associated with pruritus is believed to exacerbate AD lesions 
by causing mechanical damage to the skin, allowing the penetration of foreign 
antigens, triggering inflammatory  responses, and leading to further aggravation of 
dermatitis and itching. This vicious circle of scratching exacerbation of dermatitis 
aggravation of itching is known as the “itch -scratch cy cle”.16
IL-31 is involved in both primary  AD pathoph ysiology  and perpetuation of the itch-
scratch cy cle. IL -31 is preferentially  produced b y Th2 cells, following induction by  
IL-4, and its expressi on is consistently  increased in the skin lesions of AD 
patients.12,17,18Furthermore, the IL -31 receptor A (IL-31 RA) was found to be 
expressed in several tissues including the dorsal root spinal ganglia, which contain 
sensory  nerve cells,19and keratinocy tes.20Through interaction with its receptor, IL -31 
promotes pruritus, Th2- driven inflammation, and keratinocy te proliferation and 
differentiation, which are crucial for skin barrier function.12,13,21,22Together, these 
findings suggest that IL-31 is involved in the pathogenesis of pruritus and is 
implicated in the inflammation of AD.

CONFIDENTIALAtopic dermatitis is currently  managed with topical and sy stemic treatments, as well 
as phototherap y. Topical agents are the mainstay of AD therap y. Moisturizers are 
used to improve skin dryness and skin barrier d ysfunction. Topical corticosteroids 
(TCS) are widely  prescribed in adults and children for their anti- inflammatory  effect, 
but thei r long -term use can lead to side effects, such as skin atrophy  and risks 
associated with s ystematic absorption (eg, h ypothalamic pituitary axis suppression 
and Cushing’s s yndrome). Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI ) are effective for acute 
and chronic tr eatment in adults and children, particularl y in selected anatomical areas. 
Stinging and burning are frequent local reactions, and both tacrolimus and 
pimecrolimus carry  a warning in the US prescription information that long -term 
safet y has not been establi shed due to reports of (rare cases of) malignancy . 
Crisaborole (Eucrisa®; Pfizer) is a topical phosphodiesterase ( PDE )-4 inhibitor with 
an acceptable safet y profile in adults and children but is most commonly  used in the 
treatment of mild -to-moderate AD. Hypersensitivity  reactions at or near the 
application site have also been observed.23
Despite the demonstrated efficacy  of topica l treatments, they  are not alway s sufficient 
to control moderate -to-severe AD in some patients, who therefore require the addition 
of phototherap y or a s ystemic treatment to achieve sufficient control of AD.24There 
are various forms, doses, and treatment protocols of phototherap y, which lead to 
heterogeneous treatment outcomes, including common side effects such as actinic 
damage, local ery thema and te nderness, pruritus, burning and stinging, as well as the 
long-term risk of skin cancer. S ystemic corticosteroids, while effective at controlling 
disease temporarily , should be avoided due to an overall unfavorable risk -benefit 
safet y profile, particularly  in pediatric populations. Oral antihistamines (including 
both sedating and non -sedating medications) have been studied in the management of 
AD but there is insufficient evidence of treatment benefit. Cyclosporine, 
methotrexate, azathioprine, or my cophenola te mofetil may  be considered when 
systemic treatment is required.24Most of these sy stemic immunosuppressants, except 
cyclosporine, have not been appr oved for the treatment of AD and are used off -label 
in both adults and pediatric patients. Cy closporine is approved for treatment of severe 
AD in the E uropean U nion and in a few other countries (eg, Japan), but not in the US. 
However, given the high response variability  and the known secondary  adverse 
effects of these drugs, there is a need for new drugs to better control the disease while 
decreasing the risk of secondary  adverse effects.
Several biological agents are currentl y being used or developed for t he treatment of 
AD. Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody  that blocks the signaling pathway  of 
both IL -4 and IL -13, is approved in adults with moderate- to-severe AD not 
adequatel y controlled with topical medications25and is being developed for use in

CONFIDENTIALpediatric populations. Two other anti -IL-13 therapies, lebrikizumab and tralokinumab, 
are also currently  in development.
Nemolizumab, a humanized anti -human IL -31 RA monoclonal antibody , inhibits the 
binding of IL -31 to IL -31RA and subsequent signal transduction. Transgenic mice 
overexpressing IL-31 exhibited skin lesions resembling those of AD and scratching 
behavior, which could be suppressed b y treatment with an anti- mouse IL -31 
antibody .26,27In dogs, lokivetmab, a caninized, anti- canine IL -31 antibody ,has been 
shown to reduce pruritus in a dose -dependent manner with a rapid onset of effect and 
decrease in dermatitis score compared to placebo.28In cynomolgus monkey s, 
nemolizumab suppressed IL -31-induced scratching.29In a phase 2a stud y 
(CIM003JG) in adult subjects with AD, nemolizumab improved both pruritus and 
lesional AD, while demonstrating an acceptable safet y profile.30In a randomized, 
placebo- controlled, double -blind, parallel -group (10 mg, 30 mg, 90 mg ,and placebo) ,
phase 2b dose -finding study , the 30-mg dose was selected as the final dose for further 
evaluation in phase 3. Nemolizumab has not been previously  studied in subjects under 
the age of 18 years.The safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the 30-mg dose, 
selected for further development based on the results of the phase 2b study  conducted 
in adult subjects, will be investigated in adolescent subjects with moderate -to-severe 
AD.
In conclusion, nemolizumab may  present a new treatment option for AD in pediatric 
as well as adult patients. Atopic dermatitis patients with associated pruritus and an 
insufficient response to topical therapies could particularl y benefit from such a 
therap y. The objective of this phase 3 pivotal study  is to evaluate the safet yand 
efficacy of nemolizumab administered concomitantly  with background topical therapy
in adult and adolescent subjects with moderate -to-severe AD who are not adequatel y 
controlled wi th topical treatments .
6.2 Clinical Studies
The Investigator’s Brochure (IB) contains detailed information on clinical and non -
clinical studies. Results of 3 completed clinical studies of nemolizumab in AD are 
summarized below.
6.2.1 Phase 1 Single -Dose Safety St udy
The safet y, tolerability , and PK of a single subcutaneous dose of nemolizumab were 
evaluated in a randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled phase 1 stud y including 
80 healthy  adult volunteers and 36 Japanese subjects with moderate- to-severe AD.31
Doses ranged from 0.003 to 3.0 mg/kg in hea lthy volunteers and f rom 0.3 to 3.0 
mg/kg in AD subjects . There were no deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs )

CONFIDENTIALreported in the stud y, and no dose -dependent increase in the incidence of adverse 
events ( AEs)was observed. 
Pharmacokinetic assessments following a single subcutaneous dose of nemolizumab 
showed a dose -dependent increase in serum nemolizumab concentration, AUC inf,and 
maximum drug concentration .Peak serum concentrations were observed 4 to 6 day s 
after nemolizumab administration, after which the drug gradually disappeared over a 
half-lifeof approximately  2 weeks.
6.2.2 Phase 2a Multi -Dose Safety and Efficacy Study
The safet y, tolerabili ty, and efficacy  of nemolizumab monotherap y was evaluated in 
264 moderate -to-severe AD subjects who were inadequatel y controlled b y or 
intolerant to topical therapy in a phase 2a study (CIM003JG) .30,32The study  included 
a 12-week ,randomi zed, double -blind, placebo -controlled period (Part A) and a 52-
week extension (Part B). At Week 12, various doses of nemolizumab (0.1 mg/kg, 0.5 
mg/kg ,or 2.0 mg/kg) administered subcutaneously  every  4 weeks (Q4W) were 
statistically  significantly  more effe ctive than placebo in reducing pruritus visual 
analogue scale (VAS) score, with 0.5 mg/kg and 2.0 mg/kg doses being more 
effective than 0.1 mg/kg. No additional benefit was observed with the 2.0 mg/kg 
Q4W or every  8 weeks ( Q8W )doses compared to 0.5 mg/kg Q4W.
During the entire stud y (Parts A and B), AEs that occurred in 5% or more of the 
nemolizumab -treated patients (all groups pooled) were nasophary ngitis, AD, 
increased blood creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ), upper respiratory  tract infection, 
headache, peri pheral edema, and impetigo. The majority of AEs were mild or 
moderate in intensity . No clinically  relevant findings were observed during the study  
for laboratory  tests, vital signs, ph ysical examination ,or electrocardiogram (ECG). 
Pharmacokinetic assessments after subcutaneous injections of various doses showed a 
dose-proportional increase of nemolizumab serum concentrations after repeated 
injections. L imited accumulation was observed, with median actual accumulation 
index below 2, and steady -state concentrations were achieved at Week 16 of
treatment . The PK profile of nemolizumab is predictable: I t is not affected by  the 
number of administrations. This might be partl y due to the low occurrence and 
minimal effect ofserum anti- nemolizumab antibodies (ADA), with ADA- positive 
subjects represent ing7.1% of all subjects treated with nemolizumab .In addition, in 
this study , 1 subject in the 0.1 mg/kg Q4W group with anti -nemolizumab antibodies 
from baseline developed neutralizing ADA at Week 64. I mportantl y, serum 
nemolizumab concentrations in ADA -positive subjects were not different from those 
in the ADA- negative subjects. Four subjects had treatment -emergent nemolizumab -

nemolizumab -specific IgE antibodies were observed.
6.2.3 Phase 2b Dose -Ranging Study
The phase 2b stud y was a randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, parallel -
group, dose -ranging study  to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of various doses of 
nemolizumab in moderate -to-severe AD subjects with severe pruritus ( peak pruritus 
numeric rating scale [ PP NRS ]≥ 7). 
A total of 226 adult subjects were randomized ( 1subject in the placebo group was 
randomized but not treated): 57 subjects were randomized to placebo an d 169 subjects 
were randomized to nemolizumab arms (55 subjects to 10 mg, 57 subjects to 30 mg ,
and 57 subjects to 90 mg). There were 176subjects ( 77.9%) who completed the 
treatment and 44subjects (19.5%) who discontinued the study . Overall, all 
demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar in all treatment groups.
At the Week 24 visit, a greater percent change reduction in Eczema Area and Severity  
Index (EASI )was observed with the nemolizumab 30 -mg dose ( least squares mean 
difference vs placebo = 16.7%) and the difference was statistically  significant (95% 
confidence interval [ CI]= -30.2, -3.2; p < 0.05) compared to placebo. The 
nemolizumab 10 -mg dose showed marginally  significant difference vs placebo ( least 
squares mean difference = 13.6%; 95% CI = - 27.3, 0.0; p = 0.05). However, the 
difference between the nemolizumab 90- mg dose and placebo did not achieve 
statistical significance.
The secondary  endpoint of Investigator’s Global Assessment ( IGA)success 
(clear/almost clear and 2 -point reduction) was not statistically  significant at Week 24 
(25.5% in nemolizumab 10 mg, 36.8% in 30 mg, 22.8% in 90 mg ,and 21.1% in 
placebo). However, the difference was statistically different for the 30 -mg dose 
compared to placebo at Week 16 (33.3% vs 12.3%; p = 0.008). The PP NRS 
responder (PP NRS improvement ≥ 4) rate was statistically  significant (p < 0.05) for 
the nemolizumab 10 -mg and 30 -mg doses at Week 24, and all nemolizumab doses 
were statisticall y significantly  superior to placeb o at Week 16 ( p< 0.05). 
Nemolizumab demonstrated an early  onset of action in pruritus as earl y as Week 1. I n 
addition, the proportion of EASI -75 responders was statistically  significantly  greater 
for nemolizumab 30 mg at Week 24 and for both the 30 -mg and 90-mgdoses at Week 
16 compared to placebo (p < 0.05) . The sleep disturbance NRS was highl y 
statistically  significant for all 3 nemolizumab doses at Week 24 (p < 0.001) vs 
placebo.
Among all nemolizumab doses, the 30 -mg dose showed statistically  significant and 
greater difference compared to placebo for all AD and pruritus endpoints at Week 16.

CONFIDENTIALProbably  due to TCS background therap y, there was increasing placebo effect in the 
study , shrinking the deltas between active arms and placebo as the study  progressed 
from Week 16 to Week 24. The dose-effect was closer to the maximum efficacy
model ,achieving the maximum efficacy  atthe30-mg dose and lower efficacy  with
the 10- mg and 90 -mg doses.
There was 1 non- related AE with a fatal outcome (8 2-year-old subject treated with the 
10-mg dose died due to non –study  drug related aspiration pneumonia and 
cardiopulmonary  arrest). Three suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions
(SUSARs) were recorded in the study : exacerbation of AD(10-mg dose, withdrawal 
from study ), septic shock ( 90-mg dose, sepsis, Staphylococcus aureus–positive blood 
culture, recovered/resolved without sequelae), and phlegmon/cellulitis of the right 
cheek (30-mg dose, recovered/resolved without sequelae). All doses of nemolizumab 
were associated with a slightl y higher incidence of serious treatment -emergent AEs 
(TEAEs )(1 [1.8%], 3 [5.5%], 2 [3.5%], and 2 ([3.5%] inplacebo, 10 mg, 30 mg ,and 
90 mg, respectivel y) but not severe TEAEs ( 6 [10.7 %], 3 [5.5%], 5 [8.8%], and 2 
[3.5%] inplacebo, 10 mg, 30 mg, and 90 mg, respectivel y) when compared to 
placebo. There was a comparable percentage of subjects discontinuing treatment due 
to TEAE in the placebo and active treat ment arms. All doses of nemolizumab were 
assoc iated with a slightly higher incidence of TEAEs when compared to placebo. 
There was no increase in the incidence of skin infections in the nemolizumab 
compared to the placebo groups, although there was a higher incidence of non -skin 
infections with nemoliz umab (mainly rhinopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract 
infections). There was a dose -dependent increase of asthma flares (1 [1.8%], 2 
[3.6%], 7 [12.3%], and 10 [17.5%] inplacebo, 10 mg, 30 mg ,and 90 mg, 
respectivel y) in subjects with pre -existing asthma . Events were mostl y mild or 
moderate ( 1 severe event with highest dose), manageable, and reversible under 
treatment with study  drug. Further, a higher incidence of AD exacerbation in the 
placebo arm compared to the nemolizumab treat ment arms was observe d. Local and 
systemic injection- related reactions (IRRs) occurred more frequentl y in the placebo 
compared to the active treat ment groups. Finally , there was a low incidence of 
peripheral edema, with no serious cases and no imbalance with the placebo arm. 
The safet y and efficacy  data generated in the p hase 2b dose -finding study  supported 
the selection of the 30-mg dose as the treatment dose for the phase 3 studies .
Based on the safety  data from the 3 completed studies, no additional risks for 
nemolizumab have been identified. Potential important risks to be monitored closely 
include newl y diagnosed asthma or worsening of asthma and infections.

A 16 -week, open- label, phase 2 study  (N = 20) will evaluate the safet y, efficacy ,and 
PKof nemolizumab 30 mg Q4W, administered concomitantly  with background TCS, 
in adolescent subjects (12 -17 years old) with moderate -to-severe AD who are not 
adequatel y controlled with topical treatments. 
Nemolizumab has not been previousl y studied in subjects under the age of 18 y ears. 
The safet y and PKprofile of the 30- mg dose, selected for further developme nt based 
on the results of the phase 2b study  conducted in adult subjects, will be investigated in 
adolescent subjects with moderate -to-severe AD. 
An interim anal ysis is planned to support enrollment of adolescent subjects in the 
current phase 3 pivotal study  for AD. 
6.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment
Topical medications are the mainstay  of AD therapy . Treatment options are however ,
limited for pa tients with moderate- to-severe AD whose disease cannot be adequatel y 
controlled with topical medications.
Results of previous clinical studies in adults demonstrated that treatment with 
nemolizumab had a marked effect on AD, pruritus, and pruritus- related sleep loss. 
Improvements in the s ymptoms of AD were consistent with the observed 
improvement in sleep quality (evaluated subjectively ) and QoL (evaluated using 
Dermatology  Life Quality  Index [DLQI ]). Continuous treatment fo r up to 64 weeks 
led to improvements in overall AD severit y, evaluated with various validated scales 
commonly  used in dermatology  clinical trials (ie, EASI , SCORing Atopic Dermatitis 
[SCORAD ],and I GA). Nemolizumab was also well tolerated overall when used as 
monotherap y or concomitantly with a TCS. 
Based on the currentl y available information on nemolizumab and the risks associated 
with biologic agents in general, the potential risks of nemolizumab treatment include 
local or s ystemic IRRs, newly diagnose d asthma or worsening of asthma , 
exacerbation of atopic dermatitis, and skin or non- skin infection s.The following 
specific risk-minimization and safet y follow -up measures have been planned in this 
clinical study : 
a.In the phase 2b (114322) dose -ranging st udy, a dose -dependent increase of asthma 
flares (1 [1.8%], 2 [3.6%], 7 [12.3%], and 10 [17.5%] in placebo, 10- mg, 30 -mg,
and 90- mgtreatment arms, respectivel y) in subjects with pre -existing asthma was 
observed. Events were mostly  mild or modera te (1severe event with highest 
dose), manageable ,and reversible under treatment with study  drug. The protocol

CONFIDENTIALwill exclude subjects with asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalization in the 
preceding 12 months before screening, subjects whose asthma has not be en well 
controlled (ie, s ymptoms > 2 day s per week, nighttime awakenings 2 or more
times p er week, or some interference with normal activities) during the last 3 
months before the s creening visit , Asthma Control Test (ACT) score ≤ 19,and 
subjects with pea k expiratory  flow (PEF) below 80% of the predicted value. At all
visits, all subjects will be asked about respiratory changes and a respiratory 
examination will be performed . Peak e xpiratory  flow measurements will be 
performed for all subjects at screening ,baseline , and regular intervals throughout 
the study . For subjects with a history  of asthma, PEF measurements and ACT will 
be administered at all visits. Subjects diagnosed with de novo asthma will perform 
PEF and ACT assessments at all visits starting w ith the visit in which the 
diagnosis was confirmed. Subjects with a medical history of asthma will be 
referred to the ph ysician managing their asthma if ACT ≤ 19, PEF < 80% of the 
predicted value, and/or unexpected worsening of asthma is observed or report ed. 
Subjects without a medical history  of asthma will be referred to a respiratory  
specialist if respiratory changes suggestive of asthma are observed or reported. An 
independent adjudication committee (IAC) will review all asthma adverse events 
reported during the course of the study .
b. The exclusion criteria of this clinical study  (ie, restricting entry  of subjects with 
recent/current infection sor known/suspected immunosuppression or unusually  
frequent, recurrent, severe, or prolonged infections ) will pre vent non- eligible
patients from receiving nemolizumab. As no data are available in pregnant or 
breastfeeding women, these patients are not eligible for this study . Patients who 
have recentl y receiv edlive vaccines may  be considered for enrollment after an 
appropriate time has elapsed before b aseline/Day 1. Administration of live 
vaccines is prohibited during the study . Administration of non -live vaccines is
permitted including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) vaccination.
c.A slight trend of dose -dependent increase of peripheral edema was reported in the 
nemolizumab phase 2a study  (CIM003JG). Most events were mild (11 of 21), no 
case was serious, and none resulted in premature treatment discontinuation; no 
case was associated with renal or cardiac AEs. The EASI values and thymus and 
activation -regulated chemokine (TARC) levels were relativel y higher in subjects
with peripheral edema indicating that peripheral edema might be related to more 
severe AD. There were a few subjects repo rting peripheral edema in the p hase 2b 
(114322) study  (2 [3.6%], 2 [3. 6%], 4 [7%], and 2 [3.5%] inplacebo, 10- mg, 30 -

of special interest ( AESI )in this study .

Facialedema
Elevated ALT or AST (> 3 × ULN) in combination with elevated bilirubin 
(> 2 ×ULN )

nemolizumab and the risk -minimization approaches to be implemented, the 
benefit/risk r atio of nemolizumab is considered to be favorable in this study.
6.4 Drug Profile
Nemolizumab is a humanized monoclonal modified immunoglobulin G 2 antibody  
comprising a structure of 2 H- chains (445 amino acid residues) and 2 L-chains (214 
amino acid residues) connected b y 16 disulfide bonds. Study  drug will be supplied as 
a lyophilized powder for solution in a pre -filled, dual chamber , single -use sy ringe

CONFIDENTIAL6.5 Dose Selection Rationale
Based on the outcome of the phase 2b dose -ranging stud yin adults , the 30- mg dose 
(with 60-mg loading dose), when administered Q4W , provided the best benefit/risk 
ratio of the 3 doses evaluated and is therefore selected as the final dose to be 
developed for the treatment of AD. Across the full range of subject body  weights in 
the phase 2b stud y, the 30 -mg dose (with 60 -mg loading dose) provided a comparable 
observed exposure with respect to the bod yweight -based dose of 0.5 mg/kg tested 
during the phase 2a study .
Adolescent subj ects will be enrolled after the sponsor confirms the safet y of the 30 -
mg Q4W dose in adolescents in a separate clinical study  (Protocol 116912).
The current study  includes a 32 -week maintenance period whereby  clinical responders 
on nemolizumab 30 mg Q4W at Week 16 will be re -randomized (1:1:1) to 30 mg 
Q4W, 30 mg Q8W ,or placebo to evaluate maintenance of effect. The nemolizumab 
30 mg Q8W regimen is proposed to evaluate whether a clinical response can be 
maintained with a lower dosing frequency . 
PK/pharmac odynamic ( PD)modeling was perfor med on three clinical endpoints 
(EASI, IGA, and PP NRS) to support selection of the additional Q8W dose regimen 
for Phase 3 maintenance. The medians of the active treatment arms were not 
contained within the range of the pl acebo for all clinical endpoints, indicating a 
benefit with active treatment over placebo in both dose regimens (Q4W and Q8W) . 
While higher efficacy  on all clinical endpoints was observed with the Q4W dose 
regimen, it was evidenced that subcutaneous nemoli zumab Q8W for 16 weeks will 
maintain clinical benefit compared to placebo . 
PK/PD modeling provides the rationale to evaluate and compare thesafet y and 
efficacy  of Q4W and Q8W dosing of 30 mg nemolizumab in the maintenance phase 
of the pivotal studies.

CONFIDENTIAL8INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan : Description
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter, parallel- group 
study  in adult and adolescent subjects with moderate -to-severe AD. Eligible subjects 
must have a documented history  of inadequate respons e to topical AD medications. 
Approximately  150 study centers are planned in Europe, Americas, and Asia -Pacific.
Beginning at screening, s ubjects will apply  a moisturizer at least once daily and an
authorized background topical therap y (including a medium- potency  TCS for the 
body  and a low-potency  TCS or a TCI  for sensitive areas such as the face, neck, 
intertriginous areas, etc) for use throughout the study . If deemed to be medically  
necessary  by the investigator ( eg, to control intolerable AD signs /sympto ms), rescue 
therapies can be prescribed to the subjects during the study, except during the run- in 
period (ie, at least 2 weeks [14 day s] before Day  1/baseline).
The study  consists of 4 periods over approximately  60 weeks: screening (including 
run-in), ini tial treatment, maintenance, and follow -up ( unless the subject is a non -
responder at Week 16, at which their participation could last up to 28 weeks ). Refer t o
Figure 2for an overview of the treatment/ study  design.
An IDMC will review and monitor subject safet y throughout the stud y. The IDMC 
will provide recommendations on the safet y of subjects. Details on the IDMC, 
including the plan of analysis for IDMC outputs, the composition of the IDMC, the 
procedures, roles, responsibilities and their communications are provided in the 
IDMC charter.
Screening Period (Screening to Initial Randomization/Baseline)
The screening period (approximately  2-4 weeks before planned Day 1/baseline) will 
evaluate subject eligibility  and introduce standardized background topical therapy  over 
a run -in period of at least 2 weeks (ie, 14 day s) before Day 1/baseline.
Subjects may be rescreened once unless the reason for screen failure is related to disease 
severit y inclusion criteria (IGA, EASI, BSA, and PP NRS). The latter subjects are not 
permitted to rescreen.
Initial Treatment Period ( Baseline/Day  1 to Week 16 Pre-dose)
The initial treatment period is defined as Day 1/baseline through Week 16 ( before the
Week 16 dose,with last dose at Week 12). Approximately  750 total subjects will be 
randomized ( 2:1)to receive either nemolizumab (CD14152) or placebo, stratified by  
baseline disease severit y (IGA;moderate :IGA = 3;severe :IGA =4) and PP NRS 
severit y [PP NRS ≥7; PP NRS < 7). A minimum of 250 subjects will be randomized 
in each PP NRS strata. Table 4 summarizes study  drug dosing during the initial 
treatment period .

Maintenance Period (Re -Randomization: Week 16 to Week 48)
The maintenance period is defined as Week 16(maintenance baseline) to Week 48. All 
nemolizumab (CD14152) -treated subjects (ie, group 1) who are clinical responders at 
Week 16will be re-randomized (1:1:1) tostudy medication , as follows: group 1A, 
nemolizumab (CD14152) 30mg Q4W ; group 1B, nemolizumab (CD14152) 30mg 
Q8W ;or group 1C, placebo Q4W (Table 5). 
Clinical responders are defined as: 
IGA of 0 (clear )or 1 (almost clear) at Week 16
OR
EASI -
75 at Week 16
All placebo- treated subjects (ie, subjects in group 2 from the initial treatment period) 
who responded to placebo during the initial treatment period will continue to receive 
placebo Q4W in the maintenance period . 
Subjects who receive rescue therapy will be considered non -responders.
Based on the phase 2b results (Protocol 114322), it isestimated that 15% of subjects 
will drop out from the initial treatment period. Assuming a 45% responder rate with 
active treatment and 12% with placebo, approximately 216subjects will participate in 
the maintenance period (1 90 nemolizumab and 26 placebo subjects).

CONFIDENTIAL8.2 Discussion of Study Design
8.2.1 Study Design
This study  will evaluate the safet y and efficacy  of nemolizumab (CD14152) in adolescent 
and adult subjects with AD. The rationale for the genera l study  design is based upon the 
prior phase 2b design conducted in adult subjects with AD , with background TCS therap y. 
The r ationale for the nemolizumab dose/dose regimen is provided in Section 6.5. 
Eligible subjects for this clinical study  will be adolescents and adults with moderate -to-
severe AD whose disease isnot adequately  controlled by topical treatments. The study 
population is selected based on the current unmet need in the management of AD in 
pediatric populations, the mode of action of nemolizumab (CD14152) , and the need to 
understand the safet yand long-term exposure of nemolizumab (CD14152) in the 
adolescent and adult population. The inclusion criteria for IGA, BSA ,and EASI  are 
consistent with the disease severit y targeted in the study  and in nemolizumab (CD14152) 
studies in adults: An IGA of 3 or 4 corresponds to moderate or severe AD,respectivel y; 
BSA of at least 10% is usually  observed in these more severe AD patients .An EASI 
threshold of 1 6is generally  recognized to be representative of moderate -to-severe AD and 
is consistent with the published analyses correlating IGA and EASI assessments in patients 
with AD.33,34Finally , subjects with associated pruritus are targeted because of prior studies
with nemolizumab (CD14152) andits marked effect on pruritus. Specifically, subjects with 
a PP NRS score of ≥ 7 were included based on the population evaluated inthe phase 2b 
study ; a lower PP NRS threshold of ≥ 4 was selected for this study  based on anticipated 
benefits for subjects with less severe pruritus as wel l.
The study  includes a 16- week initial treatment period , a 32- week maintenance period, and 
an 8-week follow -up period ( ie, 12weeks after last study  drug administration )for subjects 
who decline or are not eligible to enter the LTE study . A 16-week treatment is considered 
adequate to evaluate the safet yand efficacy of nemolizumab based on the results of the 
phase 2b study  (114322) and other registrational studies for the treatment of AD. The 
maintenance period will compare the maintenance of effect of 2 nemolizumab dosing 
regimens (30 mg Q4Wand30 mg Q8W) compared to placebo. The nemolizumab 30mg 
Q8W regimen is proposed to evaluate whether a clinical response can be maintained with 
a lower dosing frequency .Subject swho are clinical responder s at Week 16 w ill be re-
randomized (1:1:1) to 1 of 3 maintenance treatment groups.

Subjects who are non-responders at the Week 16 visit can be considered for LTE study  
eligibility . All subjects who complete the maintenance period (Week 48 visit) can be 
considered for LTE study  eligibility .
The selected endpoints for assessing the PK and safet y of nemolizumab (CD14152) are in 
accordance with current standards, as are the safet y endpoints of the trial. Blinding subjects 
and the designated study  team to the treatment assignment(s) ensures objectivity  and 
minimizes bias. Randomization through the interactive response technology  (IRT)guards 
against selection bias.
A follow -up visit is scheduled for subjects who decline participation in the LTE study  or 
are not eligible to participate. The duration of the follow -up period from the final 
nemolizumab dose (12 weeks) corresponds to approximately  5half-lives of nemolizumab ,
which is considered adequate to ensure subject safety .The follow -up visit is not required 
for subjects who participate in the LTE study  as its primary  objective is long-term 
evaluation of safet y.
Differences may be detectable during the study drug reconstitution process between active 
study  drug and placebo but appear similar after reconstitution is complete (approximately 
10 minutes) . Throughout the study , a pharmacist (or other qualified personnel) will prepare 
study  medication for injection, including confirmation of complete reconstitution, prior to 
delivery  of study  medication for injection. The pharmacist (or other qualified personnel) 
preparing stud ymedication should not be involved with any study assessments and should 
notdiscuss any aspects of study  drug reconstitution with the subject/caregiver or study  staff 
involved in subject interviews or study  assessments. 
Background topical therapy  includes the use of authorized TCS ± TCI throughout this 
study . This is in line with the current practice to use topical agents in conjunction with 
systemic treatment in more severe cases.2Background topical therap y will be started from 
the screening visit to ensure disease stability  and avoid flares. The potency  of TCS selected 
for this study  is clinicall y justified: a medium -potency  TCS will be used on the body , where 
considered safe (eg, trunk and extre mities). A low-potency  TCSor a TCI willbe used in

response to topical medications (TCS with or without TCI ). All subjects must 
demonstrate inadequate response to TCS. All subjects who have used TCI within 6 
months of the screening visit , or for whom TCI  is selected as background therapy  for 
sensitive areas ,must also demonstrate inadequate response to TCI. Acceptable 
documentation includes patient records with information on TCS (with or without 
TCI) prescription and treatment outcome, or w ritten documentation of the 
conversation with the subject’s treating ph ysician, if different than the investigator. If 
documentation is inadequate, subjects may be re -screened after such documentation is 
obtained.
Inadequate response to TCS treatments (with or without TCI) is defined as:

Good hy giene practices and clean techniques must apply  at alltimes.
Differences may be detectable during the study drug reconstitution process between active 
and placebo ,but active and placebo appear similar after reconstitution is complete 
(approximatel y 10 minutes). Throughout the study , a pharmacist (or other qualified 
personnel) will prepare study  medication for injection, including confirmation of complete 
reconstitution, prior to delivery of stud y medication for injection. T he pharmacist (or other 
qualified personnel) preparing study  medication should not be involved with any study 
assessments and should not discuss any aspects of study  drug reconstitution with the 
subject/caregiver or study staff involved in subject interviews or study  assessments. 
The study  drug does not contain preservatives. From a microbiological point of view, the 
preparation of the stud y drug has to be done as close to subject administration as possible, 
and the study  drug should be used immediatel y (less than 1 hour) after re constitution. I f 
not used immediately , the study  drug has to be used within 4 hours maximum after 
reconstitution stored at room temperature (below 30°C) and only  if the preparation has 
taken place appl ying strictly  good hy giene practices and clean techniqu es to ensure 
controlled aseptic conditions.
8.4.1.4 Study Drug Injection
All study  drug injections will occur at the study  center, following instructions provided in 
the current versions of the pharmacy  manual and Instruction for Use. After confirming that 
the study drug is fully reconstituted, the pharmacist (or other qualified person nel) will 
deliver the DCS to the investigator or other qualified personnel , for subcutaneous injection 
in the subject’s abdomen or alternative injection site. A different injection site should be 
selected for each injection. Refer to thecurrent versions of thepharmacy  manual and 
Instruction for Use for further details. The site of injection should be recorded in the 
subject’s treatment record as well as the CRF at each time point.
For subjects willing and able to self-inject ,or to have their caregiver inject study 
medication, study  center staff will provide training on study  medication injections. Subjects 
or caregivers will be allowed to inject medication at subsequent visits unde r supervision 
by study  center clinic staff (with DCS preparation including reconstitution performed by 
the pharmacist or other qualified person neland delivered for injection after reconstitution 
is complete). Study  center /clinic staff can perform all injections if the subject (or caregiver )
is unwilling or unable to perform injections. The CRF will record who performed study  
drug injection at each visit.

CONFIDENTIAL8.4.5 Method of Assigning S ubjects to Treatment G roups : Randomization and Re -
Randomization
Upon confirmation of eligibility  for a given subject to participate in the study, a unique 
randomization number will be assigned to that subject via IRT at the baseline visit .
Subjects will be randomized (2:1) to receive treatment of nemolizumab (CD14152) Q4W 
or placebo. Randomization wil l be strati fied by  disease severit y (IGA=3 , IGA=4) and 
prurit us severit y (PP NRS ≥ 7, PP NRS < 7).
Subjects who were randomized to nemolizumab in the in itial period and achieved clinical 
response (EASI -75 or IGA 0/1) at Week 16 will be re-randomized (1:1: 1) to receive 
nemolizumab Q4W ,nemolizumab Q8W ,or placebo via IRTin the maintenance period .
8.4.6 Selection of D oses in the Study
The 30-mg dose (Q4W or Q8W) proposed for this study  is supported b y the results of the 
nemolizumab phase 2b study  (114322) and other supportive data .Refer also to Section
6.5for further details.
8.4.7 Dose Modification
Dose modification of the study  drug will not be permitted during the clinical study . 
Any inadvertent dose modification (s)should be reported to the s ponsor/CRO. 
In the event of a missed dose (ie, temporary  discontinuation of the study  drug), it will be 
documented in the CRF that the drug has not been administered at the study  visit, 
together with the reason (eg ,for safet y). Subjects will be asked to return to the study  
center s for all remaining visits and complete all study  assessments and procedures as 
described in Section 8.1.2 .
Dosing frequency  is scheduled for Q4W , based on the baseline/Day  1 visit date. If a 
study  visit occurs outside the visit window, study  drug can be administered provided 
there is a minimum of 3 weeks since the last injection. Future visits should be scheduled 
within the required windows based on the baseline/ Day 1 visit date, while maintaining 
the minimum 3 -week interval between 2 injections.

CONFIDENTIAL8.4.8 Blinding
All attempts willbe made to keep the study  center staff and subjects blinded throughout 
the study . Members of the study  center staff, including those responsibl e for DCS 
preparation , will not have access to the randomized treatment assignment. 
To ensure double -blind administration of study  drug the study  center pharmacist(s) or 
other qualified personnel will prepare allnemolizumab (CD14152) or placebo treatments , 
according to the current version sof the pharmacy manual and Instruction for Use and 
assigned DCS provided by the IRT s ystem.
As there may  be detectable differences between active and placebo during the 
reconstitution process, the DCS is delivered for injection after the reconstitution is 
complete. The pharmacist (or other qualified personnel) preparing study  medication 
should not be involved with any  study  assessments and should not discuss any  aspects of 
study  drug reconstitution with the subject/caregiver or stud y staff involved in subject 
interviews or stud y assessments.
To maintain the integrit y of the study  blinding, the bioanaly tical laboratory  staff who 
process/ analyze the PK/PD/PGx samples will not provide an y information to sponsor, 
CRO, or investigational study  center personnel directly  involved with the ongoing 
conduct of the stud ythat may  lead to unblinding . 
Unblinding of a subject’s individual treatment code should occur onl y in case of a 
medical emergency  or in the eve nt of a serious medical condition that necessitates 
identification of the study drug for the welfare of that subject, as judged b y the 
investigator . The emergency  unblinding process utilizes I RT to allow the investigator to 
have unrestricted, immediate, an d direct access to the subject’s individual study  
treatment. When possible (ie, when the health of the subject is not immediately  at risk) , 
the investigator or sub-investigator is encouraged to consult with the m edical m onitor and 
the sponsor before breaking the blind.
If emergency  unblinding is required:
•Only  the investigator will make the decision to unblind the treatment assignment.
•Only  the affected subject will be unblinded.
•The I RT sy stem will provide the treatment assignment to the investigato r.

information on the steps for breaking the blind in the I RT s ystem.
When the blinding code is broken, the reason must be fully  documented. If the code is 
broken b y the investiga tor, the subject must be withdrawn from the study  and must also 
be appropriatel y followed for a minimum of 12 week safter the last dose of study  drug.
The reporting requirements for unblinding are the same for reporting an SAE. See also 
Section 9.2.1.3 .
The randomization code will remain blinded to all study  sites and study  team members 
until completion of the study and after the study database has been locked. Although 
initial treatment period results may be anal yzed after all subjects have either completed 
the Week 16 visit, or have withdrawn or been discontinued from the study before Week 
16, personnel from sponsor, CRO, and investigational sites direc tly involved with the 
ongoing conduct of the study  will not have access to any information that may  lead to 
unblinding for the ongoing maintenance evaluation .
The IDMC will review data at periodic intervals throughout the stud y as defined in the 
IDMC charter. The IDMC charter will specify  the procedures for unblinding to ensure 
that treatment assignment remains undisclosed to all individuals involved in the dire ct 
execution and management of the study until the final database is locked.
8.4.9 Prior and C oncomitant Therapy
Prior therapies are defined as therapies that have been stopped within the 3 months before 
the screening visit, unless relevant to the inclusion/exc lusion criteria. Whenever possible, 
prior therapies for AD should be documented. 
Concomitant therapies /medications are defined as follows:
Any existing therapies ongoing at the time of the s creening visit,
Any changes to existing therapies (such as chang es in dose, formulation or application 
frequency ) during the course of the study , or
Any new therapies received by  the subject since the screening visit
The following 2 categories are to be considered for prior and concomitant therapies: 
Drugs/ Therapies include but are not limited to prescription, over- the-counter, birth 
control pills/patches/hormonal devices, vitamins, moisturizers, sunscreens, herbal 
medicines/supplements, and homeopathic preparations.

sole purpose is diagnosis (non- therapeutic) are not included.
Prior and concomitant therapies for drugs/therapies or for medical/surgical procedures are 
to be recorded in the appropriate CRF. 
Concomitant therapies are to be recorded, reviewed, and updated at each visit. 
At each visit, investigators should also confirm concomitant therapies for contraception. 
Contraceptive counseling should occur at screening (or at applicable visits when pre-
pubertal subjects begin menses) . 
Any new concomitant therapy  or modification of an existing therapy  may  be linked to an 
AE. In such cases, a corresponding AE form should be completed to account for the new 
therap y or change in therapy , except in some cases such as dose modification for a 
chronic condition (see Section 8.4.7 ),in which case the medication will be linked to an 
item in the subject’s medical history .
8.4.9.1 Permitted Concomitant Therapy
Unless specified as prohibited therapies (see Section 8.4.9.2 ), all therapies are authorized ,
including basic skin care (cleansing and bathing), moisturizers, bleach baths, topical 
anesthetics, and antihistamines without a sedative e ffect.
The formation of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) metabolic enzy mes can be altered by  
increased levels of certain cy tokines (eg, IL -1, IL -6, IL -10) during chronic inflammation. 
Although there is no known evidence suggesting that IL- 31 affects the level or a ctivity  of 
CYP450 enzy mes, the impact of nemolizumab (CD14152) on such enz ymes has not been 
studied. Therefore, investigators should consider observ ing for clinical or laboratory  
signs that might indicate a potential effect of nemolizumab (CD14152) in subjects using 
concomitant therapies that are CYP450 substrates , particularl y those with a narrow 
therapeutic index. Typical examples of substrates with a narrow therapeutic range include 
warfarin, drugs that may cause torsade de pointes, almost all cy totoxic antineoplastic 
drugs, and aminogly coside antibiotics. A list of representative CYP450 substrates with 
narrow therapeutic index can be found in Appendix 3.

Subjects will apply  a moisturizer at least once daily,  and liberall y as needed, to dry skin 
and AD lesions beginning at screening, and throughout the study . The subject’s current 
moisturizer or a moisturizer recommended by  the investigator may  be used. Use should 
not occur within 8 h ours before each clinic/ office visit . Whenever possible, subjects 
should use the same moisturizer throughout the study .Moisturizer use and any  
adjustments should be documented in the CRF.
8.4.9.1.2 Background Topical Therapy
Subjects will apply  the authorized background topical therap y to all AD lesions 
beginning within the screening period and ≥ 14 day s before Day 1(ie, run- in). 
Medium -potency TCS Therapy for Non -Sensitive Areas : Subjects will apply  a 
medium -potency  TCS in areas of the body  where use of medium- potency  TCS is 
considered safe (eg, trunk and extremities). 
Low -potency TCS or TCI T herapy for Sensitive Areas: A low- potency  TCS or a TCI  
will be used in sensitive areas considered unsafe for medium- potency  TCS (eg, face, 
neck, intertriginous areas) or in cases where medium -potency  TCS is not tolerated. The 
investigator may  select either low -potency  TCS or TCI  for each subject, per investigator 
discretion . The subject may  only apply  1medication to each affected area; concomitant 
use of low -potency  TCS a nd TCI  on the same lesion is not permitted.
The prescribed use of background therapies and any adjustments should be documented 
in the CRF. Subjects will apply  a thin lay er of authorized topical therap y on all AD 
lesions at a frequency  that is necessary  to ensure disease stability  and prevent AD flare 
but which does not exceed the daily  frequency  recommended in the product labeling. 
Refer to the current version of the pharmacy  manual for authorized topica l therapies and 
permitted daily frequency  ofuse. “As needed” (PRN) use of TCS or TCI is not permitted.
Only  topical therapies specificall y dispensed or prescribed for use in this study are 
permitted.
The investigator should adjust b ackground therap y use during the study , according to the 
disease activity  and tolerability  ofthe subject , including tapering when signs and 
symptoms improve , discontinuation when lesions clear, and restarting if signs and 
symptoms recur .

background topical therapy  used in the initial treatment period leading up to the Week 16 
visit, in cluding tapering or complete ces sation (no use), if applicable. Throughout the 
maintenance period, adjustments to background topical therap y, as determined by the 
investigator, are permitted based on the subject’s clinical response.
8.4.9.1.3 Rescue Therapy
If deemed to be medically  necessary  by the investigator ( eg,to control intolerable AD
signs /symptoms), r escue therapies can be prescribed to the subjects at an y time during the 
study , except during the run- in period . (Subjects receiving rescue therapies during the 
run-in period are not eligible to participate in the study .)
As a general guideline and per i ndividual investigator judgment, rescue therapy  should 
not be prescribed within the first 2 weeks after baseline (ie , Week 2) to allow a minimum 
time for study  drug exposure in the presence of background therapy . 
Rescue treatments are only treatments tha t directly  treat AD (mainly  those that are 
approved or are standard of care) and include topical and sy stemic treatments as outlined.
Rescue therapies include:
Higher potency  of TCS ( equivalent to class I -II according to the US 
classification)2
Oral corticosteroids
Biologics (including their biosimilars)
Systemic nonsteroidal immunosuppressants/immunomodulators
Phototherapy  
Antihistamines, sleep aids, topical and sy stemic antibiotics , and anti -itch creams are not
considered to be rescue therap y because they  do not directly  treat AD.
Whenever possible, investigators should first use topical medication as rescue therap y 
before escalating to s ystemic therapies. If subjects receive topical treatments or 
phototherap y as rescue therap y, stud y drug administration should be continued unless 
there is a safet y concern according to the investigator’s judgment. If subjects receive 
systemic rescue therap y, the study  drug administration must be permanently 
discontinued.

9.1.1 Investigator ’sGlobal Assessment
The IGA is a 5-point scal e ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) used by the investigator or 
trained designee to evaluate the global severity  of AD and the clinical response to a 
treatment. Treatment success is defined as 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and a 2- point 
improvement from baseline (seeAppendix 4 ).35
9.1.2 Eczema Area and Severity Index 
The EASI is a validated measure commonly  used in clinic al trials and clinical practice to 
assess the severity  and the extent of AD signs. The EASI score is a composite score

excoriation, and lichenification will be assessed by the investigator or trained designee on 
a scale of 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) for each of t he 4 body  areas: head/neck, trunk, upper 
limbs, and lower limbs, with half points allowed. In addition, the extent of AD 
involvement in each of the 4 body  areas will be assessed as a percentage by  body  area of 
head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs, and converted to a score of 0 to 6. The EASI 
score will be calculated in the CRF.
9.1.3 Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale
The Pruritus NRS is a scale to be used by the subjects to report the intensity of their 
pruritus (itch) during the last 24 hours (see Appendix 6 ). Two measures of Pruritus NRS 
will be assessed (average and peak/maximum itch intensity ). The PP NRS has been 
validated in other AD clinical trials in adults, and the minimum clinically  important 
difference was shown to be 4.25
The average pruritus NRS (AP NRS) provides a measure of overall pruritus intensity  
over a given period and has clinical relevance to both subjects and phy sicians because 
peak pruritus may  show higher intensit y but short duration.
Subjects will be asked the following questions:
For average itch intensity (AP NRS) : “On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being ‘no itch’ 
and 10 being the ‘worst itch imaginable’, how would y ou rate y our itch overall during 
the previous 24 hours?”
For maximum itch intensity (PP NRS) : “On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being ‘no itch’ 
and 10 being the ‘worst itch imaginable’, how would y ou rate y our itch at the worst 
moment during the previous 24 hours?”
The screening PP NRS will be determined b y a single assessment using the PP NRS 
(score ranging from 0 to 10) for the 24 -hour period immediately  preceding the screening 
visit. The baseline PP NRS will be determined based on the average of daily  PP NRS 
(score ranging from 0 to 10) during the 7 day s immediately  preceding baseline (round ing 
to nearest whole number is not permitted) . A minimum of 4 daily  scores out of the 7 day s 
immediately  preceding baseline is required for this calculation. Subjects will receive 
instructions on how to record their pruritus NRS scores and will complete the assessment 
once dail y in the evening throughout the clinical study  (including the run -in and the 
follow -up period).

CONFIDENTIAL9.2.1 Adverse Events
Adverse Event Definition
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  subject 
administered a medicinal product which does not necessarily  have a causal relationship 
with this treatment . An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not it is related to the 
medicinal (investigational) product . This includes an exacerbation of pre- existing 
conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug interaction ,or the significant wo rsening 
of the indication under investigation that is not recorded elsewhere in the CRF under 
specific efficacy  assessments . 
Note(s) : 
Any new sign or s ymptom reported b y the subject that appears after accidental or 
intentional overdose or misuse should be reported as an AE.
Whenever possible, a diagnosis should be reported on the AE form, instead of 
signs, s ymptoms, or abnormal laboratory  values. 
Pregnancy  is not to be considered an AE; however, it must be monitored and 
reported as described in Section 9.2.1.5.
Each worsening of a chronic disease from the screening visit should be reported 
as a new AE.
The investigator or designee will report all AEs that occur from the time the I CF is signed 
until the end of the study . The sponsor/CRO should be informed if the investigator 
becomes aware of an y safety  information that appears to be drug related, even after the 
subject has completed the clinical study .
At each post -enrollment visit, the investigator (or sub-investigator) will question the 
subject about AEs using an open non -persuasive question to elicit reporting of AEs ( for 
example ,“Have you noticed an y change in your health since the last visit?” ).Directed 
questioning and examination will then be performed as appropriate. 
During optional subjects interviews, the subject will be queried on changes in his or her 
condition and perceived e ffects of the stu dy treatment. Any unfavorable changes reported 
by the subjects will be reported to the Investigator or designee by the designated CRO 
responsible for the interviews. The Investigator will be responsible for reporting all AEs ,

CONFIDENTIALincluding those reported during the interviews following the process described in the 
protocol. 
Any AE occurring during the AE reporting period, whether it is related to the study  
drug(s) or not, will be recorded immediatel y in the source document and described on the 
Adverse Event Form (“AE Form ”) along with the date of onset, severit y, relationship to 
the study  drug(s), and outcome, without omitting any requested and known information. 
Additional information will be requested under certain circumstances.
Adverse events assessed as related to the treatment or study  procedure will be monitored 
until they  have resolved or reached a stable condition. Other AEs will be monitored until 
the last visit if they  have not resolved or reached a stable condition. 
The investigator will obtain and maintain in the subject’s files all pertinent medical 
records, information and medical judgment from colleagues who assisted in the treatment 
and follow -up of the subject. If necessary , the investigator will contact the subje ct’s 
personal ph ysician or hospital staff to obtain further details.
Assessment of Severity
Each AE will be assigned a category  by the investigator as follows:
Mild : A n AE that is easily  tolerated by  the subject, causes minimal discomfort ,
and does not int erfere with every day activities.
Moderate : A n AE that is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with normal every day 
activities; intervention may  be needed.
Severe : A n AE that prevents normal every day activities; treatment or other 
intervention usually  needed.
If there is a change in severity  of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event.
Assessment of Causality
The investigator is to determine whether there is a reasonable causal relationship between 
the occurrence of the AE, and exposure to the study  drug (ie, nemolizumab or placebo) 
and/or study  procedure (eg, injection, topical background therap y, blood sample 
collection). Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering 
all relevant factors including the patte rn of the reaction, temporal relationships, relevant 
medical history , and confounding factors such as co -medication or concurrent diseases.

are facts or arguments to suggest a causal relationship (I CH E2A, Section IIIA 1).
The relationship assessment for an AE is to be completed using the following definitions
as a guideline for all AEs occurring during this clinical study :
Reasonable possibility:
According to the repor ting investigator, there is a reasonable possibility  (ie,suggestive 
evidence or arguments) that there is a causal relationship irrespective of the dose 
administered:
Between the stud y drug (nemolizumab) and the AE, and/or
Between the clinical study  protocol procedure (eg ,injection, topical background 
therap y, blood sample collection) and the AE
No Reasonable Possibility:
No suggestive evidence or arguments can be identified regarding a causal relationship 
between the stud y drug or the clinical study protocol procedure and the AE.
Action Taken
The investigator will describe the action taken in the appropriate section of the CRF, as 
follows:
 None
 Study  drug stopped
 Study drug temporarily  interrupted
 Concomitant medication (any additions or discontinuations)
 Other, specify
Follow -up of Adverse Events
All investigators should follow -up with subjects with AEs until the event is resolved or

An SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence or effect that , at an y dose,
 Results in death.
 Is life -threatening (an AE is life -threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred, ie, it does not include a reaction that might have 
caused death if it had o ccurred in a more seriou s form).
 Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization. (Complications occurring during 
hospitalization are AEs and SAEs if they cause prolongation of the current 
hospitalization. I npatient hospitalization is considered to have occurred if the 
subject has had to stay  for a night at the hospital. The criterion for prolongation of 
hospitalization is also defined as an extra night at the hospital. Hospitalization may 
not constitute sufficient grounds to be considered as an SAE if it is solely  for the 
purpose of diagnostic tests [even if related to an AE], elective hospitalization for an

The hematology laboratory  anal yses,clinical chemistry  laboratory  anal yses, and 
urinaly seswill be performed at a central laboratory . Reference ranges will be supplied by  
the central laboratory and used by  the investigator to assess the laboratory  data for 
clinical significance and patholog ical changes. 
The i nvestigator or medically  qualified sub-investigator must review and evaluate 
laboratory  values for each subject in a timely  manner. Study  centers should refer to the 
current version of the laboratory  manual for laboratory  values outside of normal limits.
For each out -of-range laboratory  result, the investigator or designee will evaluate whether 
he/she considers it to be clinically  significant, defined as meeting at least 1 of the 
following conditions: 
The abnormalit y suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity , or
The abnormalit y is of a degree that requires additional active management, eg,
discontinuation of the drug, close observation, more frequent follow -up assessments, 
or further diagnostic investigation. 
If the investigator observes a clinicall y significant laboratory result, the test will be 
repeated as soon as possible and the subject will be monitored until the value returns to 
normal and/or an adequate explanation for the abnormality  is found. 
Investigators will also be allowed to repeat specific lab oratory test(s) or procedure (s)

Subjects should be reminded to be well h ydrated before all visits for phlebotomy  
purposes. Subjects should fast for at least 8 hours before the visits whe n blood chemistry  
testing is planned, except for the screening visit. The screening visit laboratory  values 
must be available before the baseline visit. Laboratory testing conducted in a nonfasting 
state will not be a protocol deviation.
Total blood volume s to be drawn at each visit are provided in the clinical laboratory  
manual and in Appendix 11. Additional samples may  be required if medically  indicated

CONFIDENTIAL9.2.5 Tuberculosis Testing
Immunosuppressant biologic treatments have been shown to increase the risk of TB 
infection or to cause conversion from latent to active TB in some circumstances. Because 
of this, subjects willbe screened for active or latent TB before entry  into this study .
9.2.5.1 Definitions
Active TB is a disease caused by  Mycobacterium tuberculosis in any  part of the body  and 
that is in an active state as determined b y either a smear or culture taken from any source 
in the person’s bod y which tests positiv e for TB or by radiographic evidence. Individuals 
with active TB are s ymptomatic, depending upon the location of the disease (most 
commonly  in the lungs but also possibly  in the brain, kidney s, spine, or elsewhere), and 
can spread the infection to others. 
Latent TB is said to exist when an individual is infected with M tuberculosis , as 
evidenced b y a positive Interferon Gamma Release Assay ,39such as QuantiFERON -TB 
Gold, but is asy mptomatic and has no evidence of active infection on screening pathology  
or radiographic tests. Such individuals do not pass the disease to others and should 
commence a course of prophy lactic antimy cobacterial treatment to eliminate the infection 
and commit to completing the course of treatment.
9.2.5.2 Tuberculosis Screening
Ideally, as part of the medical history , the subject should be asked if they  have presented 
with active or latent TB in the past and whether they  have received a b acillus Calmette -
Guérin ( or BCG) vaccination. They  should also be asked if they  have been in contact 
with any  individuals known to have active TB or been placed in any  circumstances that 
may have exposed them to an increased risk of TB infection, such as travel to TB 
endemic regions, close contact with persons with active TB, or workplace risk (eg, 
prison, hospitals). 
Asubject who tests positive for latent TB (with a positive QuantiFERON- TB gold test)
should be referred to the subject’s treating ph ysician for appropriate follow -up. If the 
result is indeterminate , the test may  be repeated once . If confirmed indeterminate, the 
subject should then be managed as though he/she has a positive test result.

Subjects with a medical history  of asthma will take the ACT at visit saccording to Section 
8.1.2 before questioning and phy sical examination by  the investigator. Subjects with a 
new (de novo) diagnosis of asthma will take the ACT beginning at the visit the diagnosis 
was first confirmed and at all subseque nt study  visits thereafter . Subjects with an 
ACT score ≤ 19 willbe referred to the ph ysician managing their asthma. 
The ACT is an assessment to determine if a subject ’s asthma s ymptoms are well
controlled. The ACT is designed for adults and adolescents 12 years or older, and is 
composed of 5 questions. For each question, the subject will choose the best answer out 
of 5 possible answers. The test provides a numerical score ranging from 5 to 25 to assess 
asthma control; a higher score indicates better asth ma control while a score of 19 or less 
indicates the subject’s asthma may  not be under control. SeeAppendix 12.
9.2.9.2 Respiratory Examination
A respiratory  examination will be required to be performed for all subjects at all 
scheduled visits, according to Section 8.1.2 . The ACT will aid the investigator’s 
questioning of subjects with a medical history  of asthma and should be completed before 
the clinical questioning. After the s creening visit, all subjects will be asked non- leading 
questions about any  respiratory  changes. The investigator or designee will then perform a 
respiratory  examination of all subjects at all visits.

9.3 Pharmacokinetics
9.3.1 Blood Sampling
Blood samples will be collected according to Section 8.1.2 , Appendix 11, and the 
clinical laboratory  manual to determine the PK profile of nemolizumab. At each sampling 
time point for PK assessment, the collected blood will be placed to clot at room 
temperature (no more than 60 minutes after collection) and then centrifuged. The serum 
will be collected into storage tubes. 
As a guideline, PK samples should be collected at approximately  the same time of day  
throughout the stud y,to the extent possible , before study  drug injection (pre-dose 
samples) .The date and the time of each sample collection will be recorded in the CRF, 
together with the time of study  drug injection at the same visit (or missed injection if

Pharmacokinetic parameters of nemolizumab (CD14152) in the serum may be calculated , 
if needed, by a designated CRO using 2 anal yses:
PK parameters may be derived, if needed, using a non-linear mixed effect modeling 
approach with NONMEM. A pre -specified po pulation PK model based on existing 
information from previous studies in adults and adolescents (first -order absorption 
and a 1 -compartment distribution model) will be updated with the nemolizumab 
serum concentrations obtained in this study .
In addition, a static anal ysis based on serum concentration may be performed , if 
needed, using a noncompartmental anal ysis, for each subject based on concentration 
before dosing, to obtain areas under the curve. Data from subjects with missing 
concentration values (missing samples) may  be used if PKparameters can be 
estimated using the remaining data points.

theconduct of the stud y shall have access to the unblinded data before the completion of 
the trial in order to avoid introducing bias tothe remaining study  data .
10.1.10 Handling of Missing Data
Theprimary method to impute the missing values will be as follows:
Continuous Endpoints: For continuous endpoints during initial period , the MI under 
MAR assumption approach and the MMRM approach will be used to handle the missing 
data for the selected secondary  endpoints. QoL endpoints (eg, D LQI/cD LQI, EQ -5D, 
PIQ) may beimputed using last observation carried forward ( LOCF ), where applicable.
Binary Endpoints: All missing values will be treated as a non-responder for the binary  
endpoints. To assess the robustness of non- responder anal ysis, a tipping point analy sis 
will be performed. TheMI under MAR assumption, LOC F, and OCwill be used as 
sensitivity  anal ysis to im pute the missing values for the primary andkey secondary
endpoints.
Use of rescue therapy : All efficacy  data , except OC, will be set to missing after rescue 
medication is used. In OC analy sis, no observed data after subject has received rescue 
treatment will be excluded. There will be no imputations for missing data.

The following sensitivity anal yses will be conducted f or the robustness of the anal yses. 
Same anal ysis on Per -protocol population
Tipping point analysis will be performed b y converting non -responders due to 
missing data to responders in successive increments ( ∆) for both treatment groups to 
assess the robustness of analy sis.The value of ∆ that overturns (ie, non-significa nt) 
the primary  results will represent the tipping point. A graphic display  of all possible 
combination of the number of responders among both treatment groups will be 
presented.
Multiple imputation (MI) methods for missing data: The MI imputation will be 
carried out as follows.
1.Imputation Phase
a.A 50 imputed datasets with a monotone missing pattern will be created 
using SAS MI  procedure based on the observed data (Markov- Chain -
Monte -Carlo method, MCMC). The seed to be used is 118161 (the 
Protocol number). Pattern of missing data will be evaluated and it is 
expected that the pattern of missing data will be monotonic. For non -
monotone missing data patterns, MCMC method of MI procedure will be 
used to impute enough data so that the remaining missing data is 
monotone.
b.Each of the imputed datasets will be used to generate 50 complete 
datasets, usin g the following approaches:
i.Ordinal data (eg, IGA score): A logistic regression method to 
impute the ordinal missing data, including treatment, 
randomization strata, an d assessments from earlier time points as 
covariates. Response or total score of the subjects will be derived 
using these imputed data. 
ii.Continuous data (eg, EASI score): A linear regression model 
including treatment, randomization strata, and assessments from 
earlier time points as covariates will be used to impute the score. 
Response or total score of the subjects will be derived using these 
imputed data. 
2.Analy sis Phase :The analy sis will be conducted using the complete datasets.
a.Binary endpoint: The complete datasets will be modelled for the endpoint 
using CMH method as per anal ysis described in Section 10.1.3 .

applicable . LSMean s in each treatment arm, difference and standard errors 
will be calculated.
3.Pooling Phase: The results from the anal ysis phase will be combined a s follows. 
a.Binary endpoint: The results from the CMH analysis of the multiple 
imputed datasets will be combined using the Rubin (1987) and Li et al 
(1991) approach to produce pooled CMH statistics and p -value. Proportion 
of responders in each treatment arm, difference and standard error will be

Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) imputation method for missing data 
(or where rescue medication is received)
Observed Case (OC) -No data will be imputed. For this anal ysis, if an y rescue 
medication is received, and data are collected post rescue receipt, data post -rescue 
will be anal yzed as observed (ie, not set to missing).

Further details will be provided in SAP.
10.2 Determination of S ample Size
To achieve at least 90% power for each co -primary  endpoint at 2.5% significance level, 
150subjects per group will be required to detect the following differences between 
treatment groups for 2co-primary  endpoints with 2:1randomization ratio, assuming 15 % 
dropout rate during the initial treatment period.
With 2:1 randomization, 180 subjects in nemolizumab and 90 subjects in placebo will be 
required to detect the diff erences in both co-primaries to achieve 90% power.
IGA Success: To detect a difference of 18%, assuming IGA response for nemolizumab 
30% and placebo 12% at Week 16.
EASI -75 Response: To detect a difference of 30%, assuming EASI -75response for 
nemolizumab 49% and placebo 19% at Week 16.

Appendix 1 : American Academy of D ermatology Consensus Criteria forAD 
Diagnosis
Features to be considered in diagnosis of patients with atopic dermatitis:
ESSENTIAL FEATURES ; must be present:
Pruritus 
Eczema (acute, subacute, chronic):
oTypical morphology  and age -specific patterns* 
oChronic or relapsing history
*Patterns include :
1)Facial, neck, and extensor involvement in infants and children; 
2) Current or prior flexural lesions in any age group; 
3) Sparing of groin and axillary regions.
IMP ORTANT FEATURES ; seen in most cases, adding support to the diagnosis:
Early age of onset 
Atopy
oPersonal and/or family  history
oIgE reactivity  
Xerosis
ASSOCIATED FEATURES ; these clinical associations help to suggest the diagnosis of 
AD but are too non- specific to be used for defining or detecting AD for research and 
epidemiologic studies:
Atypical vascular responses (eg, facial pallor, white dermographism, delayed blanch 
response)
Keratosis pilaris / pity riasis alba / hy perlinear palms / ichthy osis 
Ocular / periorbital changes
Other regional findings (eg, perioral changes / periauricular lesions) 
Perifollicular accentuation / lichenification / prurigo lesions
EXCLUSIONARY CONDITIONS ; it should be noted that a diagnosis of AD depends 
on excluding conditions such as:
Scabies
Seborrheic dermatitis
Contact dermatitis (irritant or allergic)

COVID -19 Pandemic
This guidance applies during the COVID- 19 pandemic, as defined by  regional and/or 
local authorities. The updates summarized below are relevant to the referenced sections 
of the protocol.
Section 6.3 Risk/Benefit Ass essment
During the COVID -19 pandemic, additional risks to participants may  exist, including 
general environmental risks (eg, being outside the home, possible contact with 
unsanitized surfaces) and study -related activities (eg, interaction with study staff). 
Potential new subjects with known or suspected COVID -19 infection are ineligible for 
study  enrol lment until the infection has resolved. Furthermore, potential new subjects in a 
high-risk population for COVID -19 (e.g. 60 y ears and older or with comorbidities), 
should be temporaril y deferred until the COVID -19 risk has subsided at the location of 
the enrolling site, according to investigator judgement. Risk mitigation measures to be 
implemented for enrolled subjects and for new subjects during the COVID -19 pandemic 
are detailed in Additional Measures for Subjects Amidst COVID- 19 Pandemic below. 
Subjects with a known or suspected COVID -19 infection will immediately discontinue 
study  drug; instructions for resuming treatment are described in Section 8.3.4.2 and 
below in Guidance for Existing Subjects. Known or suspected COVID- 19 infection will 
also be followed as an AESI .
New Subsection to Section 8.1, Overall Study Design and Plan :
Additional Measures for Subjects Amidst COVID- 19 Pandemic
All investigational sites should act according to applicable site regulations, to 
guidelines and restrictions implemented by  local authorities, and to best practices 
for conducting clinical research during the COVID -19 pandemic. 
-Guidance for New Subjec ts:
Best practices currently  in place must be followed when evaluating eligibility  of 
subjects to participate in the study  during the COVID -19 pandemic.

CONFIDENTIALcomorbidities) or local guidelines, deferring participation in the study  should be 
considered. Deferment of enrollment is based on the potential risk posed by 
general environmental risks (e.g. being outside home, possible contact with 
unsanitized surfaces) and study -related activities (e.g. interaction with study  staff).
For potential subjects in the low -risk population for COVID -19 (e.g. less than 60 
years of age and without comorbidities), the risks and benefits of participation in 
the study  should be assessed on a case by  case basis. 
If at the time of screening, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject will not 
be willing and able to reach the investigational site and comply  with all of the time 
commitments and requirements of the clinical study  protocol, the subject should
not be considered for enrol lment. The subject may be rescreened at a later time.
Pre-screening phone calls should be conducted to exclude potential 
candidates/subjects who display possible symptoms of COVID -19 or are at high 
risk of having been exposed to COVID-19.
-Guidance for Enrolled Subjects:
If the local situation allows for subjects to reach the clinical investigational site 
and complete all study  procedures, the following measures should be taken:
-Implement and document in the subject records regular 
communication with the subject between visits to attempt to ensure 
early detection of potential signs/s ymptoms of COVID -19 infection, 
and provide adequate advice, as per local medical practice and public 
health guidelines for suspected COVID -19 infection. Please refer to 
the Centers for Disease Control (CDC; https://www.cdc.gov/ 
coronavirus/2019 -ncov/sy mptoms -testing/s ymptoms.html)/European 
CDC (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid- 19/questions-
answers )/local disease prevention agency  and applicable local 
guidelines for assessment of subjects’ COVID -19 status.
-Following the same guidelines, implement and document in the subject 
records an addition al communication to the subject just before the 
scheduled visit. 
-Discontinue study  drug administration in case of confirmed or 
suspected COVID -19 infection until the infection is resolved. See 
Section 8.3.4.2 .

If a subject misses a dose of study  drug due to the COVID -19 pandemic, study drug 
administration may  be continued. The following dosing schedules appl y. 
For subjects with a missed dose(s) during the initial treatment period (Baseline to Week 
16), study  drug administration can be continued based on one of the following scenarios 
(see also Diagram 1, below ):
1) Subject has missed one or more doses between Baseline and Week 16 but can 
come to the clinical site at Week 16 (see also Diagram 2a) :
- Subjects who are clinical responders (IGA of 0/1 or E ASI-75) at Week 16 
can continue into the maintenance period.
-Subjects who are non -responders at Week 16 may  be eligible to enroll in 
the long- term extension (LTE) study  RD.06.SPR.118163.
-Subjects who required rescue therap y before Week 16 may be considered
for the LTE stud y but will be required to continue with study  visits until 
Week 16 visit is due.
2) Subject has no missed doses through Week 12 but cannot reach the clinical site at 
Week 16 ( see also Diagram 2b ):
-The Week 16 visit can be delay ed by up to 8 weeks from the originally  
planned date . A remote Unscheduled visit should be planned between 
Week 12 and the delay ed Week 16 visit for safet y follow -up.
oSubjects who are clinical responders (IGA of 0/1 or EASI -75) at 
the rescheduled Week 16 visit can con tinue into the maintenance 
period.
oSubjects who are non -responders at the rescheduled Week 16 visit
may be eligible to enroll in the L TE study .
-If the subject still cannot come to the delay ed Week 16 visit within 8 
weeks of the originally  planned date, the delay ed Week 16 visit should be 
performed remotel y at the rescheduled date. A remote Unscheduled visit

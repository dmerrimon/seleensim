LETTER OF AMENDMENT #5 
DATE:       July 28, 2020 TO: ACTG CTU Principal In vestigators, CRS Leaders, and CTU/CRS Coordinators 
FROM:      A5360 Protocol Team SUBJECT: Letter of Amendment  #5 for Protocol A5360 
The following information affects the A5360 study and must be f orwarded to each site’s 
institutional review board (IRB)/ethics committee (EC) as soon as possible for their 
information and review. This Letter of Amendment (LOA) must be approved by the IRB/EC 
before implementation.  
The following information may also affect the Sample Informed C onsent. The IRB/EC is 
responsible for determining the process of informing participan ts of the contents of this LOA. 
Upon receiving final IRB/EC and any other applicable regulatory  entity approvals for this 
LOA, sites should implement the LOA immediately. Sites are stil l required to submit an LOA 
registration packet to the DAIDS Protocol Registration Office ( PRO) at the Regulatory Support 
Center. Sites will receive a registration notification for the LOA once the DAIDS PRO verifies 
Letter of Amendment #5           Page  2 of 4 28 Jul 2020 
ACTG A5360 Protocol Version 1.0 that all required LOA registration documents have been received and are complete. An LOA 
registration notification from the DAIDS PRO is not required pr ior to implementing the LOA. A 
copy of the LOA registration notification, along with this lett er and any IRB/EC 
correspondence, should be retained in the site’s regulatory file. 
The main reason for this LOA is to provide additional guidance for the resumption of study visits for 
non-US sites, in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and  in follow-up to the COVID-19-
related LOA #4, dated 06/22/20. 
This LOA is being implemented for the following reason: 
Given the evolving pandemic in non-US settings, a team decisio n has been made to extend the
upper window for the week 72 in-person visit for non-US sites to February 28, 2021, which is the 
last date for which this visit can be completed. If non-US site s are unable to complete the week 
72 in-person visit by this date, this will be considered a missed visit. In response, the following sections have been updated: Table 6.1-2, section 6.2.4, and section 6.2.5.  
The following are changes (noted in bold or strikethrough) to A5360, Version 1.0, dated 01/10/18, titled “A Single-arm Study to Evaluate the Feasibility and Effi cacy of a Minimal Monitoring Strategy to 
Deliver Pan-genotypic Ribavirin-free HCV Therapy to HCV Infected Populations who are HCV Treatment Naïve with Evidence of Active HCV Infection: The MINMON Study.” These changes will 
be included in the next version of the A5360 protocol if it is amended at a future date. Changes that 
have already been made (either by LOA or by CM) have been incor porated in the excerpted text 
shown below (and are no longer presented in bold or strikethrou gh).  
1. Table 6.1-2 (Schedule of Evaluations: Step 2 Visits Post SVR  Evaluation), the visit windows for

participants when sites are able to resume in-person research v isits to schedule the participant’s 
next visit. This contact can be considered the remote contact c orresponding to week 42 or week 
68 and must be documented in the participant’s study file. 
This LOA is being implemented for the following reasons: 
A t
eam decision has been made to extend the upper window for t he week 72 in-person visit
for US sites, to October 31, 2020, which is the last date for w hich this visit can be

CLARIFICATION MEMO  
DATE: April 9, 2020 
TO: 
ACTG CTU Principal Investigators, CRS Leaders, and CTU/CRS Coordinators 
FROM: A5360 Protocol Team 
SUBJECT: Clarification Memo #3 for Protocol A5360 (COVID-19) 
This clarification memo (CM) does not result in a change in the  protocol informed 
consent document. The Division of AIDS (DAIDS) has determined that these protocol 
changes and clarifications should be implemented immediately in  response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, which poses a safety risk to participants an d site staff. Sites do not 
need institutional review board (IRB) approval prior to implementing this CM. 
DAIDS does not require sites to forward this CM to their IRB; h owever, s ites must follow 
their IRB's policies and procedures. If IRB review of CMs is re quired at a site, that site 
must submit this document for review. 
Each site should file a copy of this CM with the protocol for r eference. 
Clarification Memo #3           Page 2 of 3 09 Apr 2020 
ACTG A5360 Protocol Version 1.0 The main reason for this CM is to provide guidance for study vi sits during the COVID-19 
pandemic. The instructions in this CM supersede the instruction s that were in the memo 
released by the A5360 Protocol Team on 03/23/20 with subject “C OVID-19: Temporary Pause 
for Protocol A5360 (MINMON Study) and Guidance for Enrolled Par ticipants.” 
All sites should contact study participants to inform them of t he temporary pause in all study 
visits and that they will be contacted to schedule their next visit when the pause is lifted. This 
contact must be documented in the participant’s study file but does NOT need to be recorded on 
the eCRFs and reported to the A5360 core team. 
When the temporary pause on study visits is lifted, sites shoul d contact study participants to 
schedule their next visit. This contact can be considered the r emote contact corresponding to 
week 42 or week 68. This contact must be documented in the participant’s study file. 
The A5360 Protocol Team is closely monitoring the situation con cerning the COVID-19 
pandemic. New guidance will be re leased in the beginning of May  2020, if needed. 
The following are clarifications (noted in bold or strikethroug h) to Protocol A5360, Version 1.0,

TO: ACTG CTU Principal Investigators, CRS Leaders, and CTU/CRS Coordin ators 
FROM: A5360 
Protocol Team 
SUBJECT: Letter of Amendment #2 for Protocol A5360, Version 1.0 , 01/10/18, 
entitled “A Single-arm Study to  Evaluate the Feasibility and Ef ficacy of 
a Minimal Monitoring Strategy to Deliver Pan-genotypic Ribaviri n-free 
HCV Therapy to HCV Infected Populations who are HCV Treatment 
Naïve with Evidence of Active HCV Infection: The MINMON Study” 
The following information impacts the A5360 study and must be f orwa rde d to 
your institutional review board (IRB)/ethics committee (EC) as soon as 
possible for their information and review. This Letter of Amend ment (LOA) 
must be approved by your IRB/EC before implementation.  
The following information may also impact the Sample Informed C onsent. You r 
IRB/
EC is responsible for determining the process of informing participants of 
the contents of this LOA. 
Upon receiving final IRB/EC and any other applicable regulatory  ent ity approvals 
for this LOA, sites should implement the LOA immediately. Sites  are still 
Letter of Amendment #2           Page 2 of 5 8 Aug 2018 
ACTG A5360 Protocol Version 1.0 required to submit an LOA registration packet to the DAIDS Prot ocol 
Registration Office (PRO) at the Regulatory Support Center. Sit es will receive a 
registration notification for the LOA once the DAIDS PRO verifi es that all 
required LOA registration documents have been received and are complete. An 
LOA registration notification from the DAIDS PRO is not require d prior to 
implementing the LOA. A copy of the LOA registration notification, along with 
this letter and any IRB/EC correspondence, should be retained i n the site’s 
regulatory files.  
The main reasons for this LOA are to clarify the requirement that the participant 
must contact the site to report taking the last pill of study d rug (SOF/VEL), 
including adding this information to the sample informed consen t; to add 
information on laboratory requirements for CD4+ post-entry; and  to update the 
protocol team roster. These changes were identified by the team . 
The following are changes to A5360  FINAL Version 1.0, dated 01/10/18: 
1. Per a new regulatory requirement by the Division of AIDS (DAIDS), a Protocol
Signature Page (PSP) is appended for submission to DAIDS Protoc ol Registration
System (DPRS) as part of the LOA registration packet.
2. Section 5.1.2, Administrat ion and Duration: The first paragr aph has been revised to read:
Participants will take SOF/VEL orally once daily with or withou t food and will receive
treatment for a duration of 12 weeks. Study staff will observe the first dose being taken
by the participant upon completion of all entry evaluations.
The site pharmacist should include numbering on the label of ea ch bottle (e.g., 1
of 3, 2 of 3, and 3 of 3) as well as a line to document the stu dy product completion
date on bottle 3. Participants should be instruct ed to open and finish one bottle  of
study product at a time, starting with bottle number 1 of 3 . When the participant
takes the last pill of SOF/VEL from the last bottle (i.e., bottle 3 of 3) each bottle,
he/she will be instructed to contact the site to document and/or report the completion
of the last bottle Participants will, therefore, contact a site a maximum o f three times to
indicate completion of bottle. See A5360 MOPS for additional in formation on reporting
of treatment stop date.
3. Section 6.3.10, Clinical Assessments, Study Treatment (Inter vention) Modifications:
This section has been updated to read as follows:
When the participant takes the last tablet of each the third bottle of SOF/VEL, he/she
will be instructed to contact the site to document and/or report the treatment stop date
study product completion date . This information self-reported by the participant
should be captured on the eCRF when reported outside of and during the week 24/ SVR
evaluation  visit. See section 5.1.2 and A5360 MOPS for additional details.
4. Section 6.3.12, Immunologic Studies (For HIV co-infected participants): This section
h
as been updated to read as follows:
CD4+
Obtain absolute CD4+ count within 90 days prior to entry from a laboratory that
Letter of Amendment #2           Page 3 of 5 8 Aug 2018 
ACTG A5360 Protocol Version 1.0 possesses a CLIA certification or equivalent. 
For post-entry evaluations, all laboratories must possess a CLI A certification 
or equivalent and must be certified for protocol testing by the  DAIDS 
Immunology Quality Assurance (IQA) Program.  
5. APPENDIX I, Sample Informed Consent (SIC), Section II Descri ption of Study Visits:
The fifth paragraph under Entry has been revised to read as fol lows:
At this visit, you will be given your study drugs. The study st aff will give you enough 
study drugs to last 12 weeks (3 months). Study staff will watch  you take your first dose 
before leaving the site. You can take the study medication (SOF /VEL) with or without 
food. You will receive adherenc e education and counseling on th e study drug, as 
described below. 
You will be given instructions on how to tak e the study medicat ion and what to do if you 
forget to take it. There will be instructions on the study medication bottle askin g 
you to call the site when you finish taking the last pill of th e last bottle (bottle #3), 
or you can write the date of when you took the last pill on the label of bottle #3 
and bring the bottle with you to your w eek 24/SVR evaluation vi sit. You may also 
note the date you finished the last pill within your phone or w rite it down on a 
separate piece of paper, as long as you bring this date with yo u to your week 
24/SVR evaluation visit. You will also receive a flier wi th information on two types of 
other medications (proton pump inhibitors and H2 inhibitors [e. g., heartburn medication]) 
that you should not take while taking study medication. [Sites: Please include local 
names of PPIs and H2 inhibitors on a flyer to give to participants at entry. Pictures 
should also be included on the flyer.]  
6. SIC, Section III Description of Study Evaluations: This sect ion has been revised to read

serum creatinine, total bilirubin, sodium, INR, albumin, platel ets, and pregnancy test 
(regardless of grade/ result) must be recorded on an eCRF. 
6. Section 6.3.13, Virologic Studies
The last sentence has been revised to read:
HCV RNA samples on study will be processed and shipped to the designated A5360 VSL
for real-time quantitative HCV RNA analysis.
7. Section 6.3.15, Questionnaires, Substance Use Questionnaire
The Substance Use Questionnaire paragraph has been revised to read:The substance use questionnaire w 
ill be administered at entry, week 24/SVR evaluation,
and weeks 48 and 72 visits to solicit participant-reported information regarding use of
substances (ie, alcohol, cigarettes, drugs). The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance
Involvement Screening Test (ASSI ST) survey that was developed f or the WHO by an
international group of researchers and clinicians as a technical tool to assist with early
identification of substance use-related health risks and substa nce use disorders will b e
used. This tool has been validated globally and captures inform ation on alcohol, smoking,
and injection and non-injection drug use.
See the A5360 MOPS for further details.
8. S ection 8.3, 
Pregnancy
The first paragraph has been revised to read:
Pregnancy will result in immediate d
iscontinuation of the study medication and initiation of
counseling regarding the lack of information on safety of SOF/V EL in pregnancy.
Participants who become pregnant while on study should contact the site to schedule an
unplanned study visit (only up to week 22) and will be followed  on study/off-treatment until
study completion. A visit following the end of pregnancy will b e conducted for evidence of
AEs in the participant, and an outcome eCRF will be completed. Male participants whose
partners become pregnant will continue treatment and should continue to follow t he
study procedures as outlined in the SOE. No additional reporting or monitoring is
required for male participants’ partners who become pregnant.
9. Section 14.2, Participant Confidentiality
The first paragraph has been revised to remove mention of “FDA” since this is a Non-IND
Letter of Amendment #1           Page 7 of 10 15 Jun 2018

All laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports, and other records that leave the site will 
be identified by coded number only to maintain participant conf identiality. All records will be 
kept locked. All computer entry and networking programs will be  done with coded numbers 
only. Clinical information will not be released without written  permission of the participant, 
except as necessary for monitoring by the ACTG, IRB/EC, FDA, NI AID, OHRP, other local, 
US, and international regulatory entities as part of their duties, or the industry supporter(s) or 
designee. 
10. Section 14.3, Study Discontinuation
The first paragraph has 
been revised to remove mention of “FDA” since this is a Non-IND
study.
The study may be discontinued at any time by the ACTG, IRB/EC, FDA, NIAID, OHRP,
other country-specific government agencies as part of their dut ies to ensure that research
participants are protected, or the industry supporter.
11. SAMPLE INFORMED CONSENT, Risks of Study Drug
The second paragraph has been revised to read:
SOF/VEL h
as limited drug interactions with HIV medications with the exception of three H IV
medications - efavirenz, tenofovir, etravirine, and tipranavir/ritonavir. If you are taking any of
these medications, your doctor will talk to you about these interactions in detail and what
symptoms to look out for. Your doctor may modify your HIV medications after discussing it
with you so that you can be included in this study.
12. SAMPLE INFORMED CONSENT, WHAT ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY?
The second and sixth pa ragraphs  ha
ve been revised to read:
Your records may be reviewed by the US Food and Drug Administra tion (FDA), the ACTG,

regulatory entities as part of their duties (insert name of sit e) institutional review board ( IRB)
(a committee that protects the rights and safety of participants in research), N ational
Institutes of Health (NIH), study staff, study monitors, drug c ompanies supporting this study,
and their designees. Having a Certificate of Confidentiality do es not prevent you fro m
releasing information about yourself and your participation in the study.

A Single -arm Study to Evaluate the Feasibility and Efficacy of a Minimal Monitoring Strategy to 
Deliver Pan- genotypic Ribavirin -free HCV Therapy  to HCV Infected Populations who are HCV 
Treatment Naïve with Evidence of Active HCV Infection : The MINMON Study  
 
DESIGN  This is a p hase IV open- label, multicenter , prospective study to assess 
the feasibility and efficacy  of a minimal monitoring (MINMON) approach in 
active hepatitis C virus ( HCV )-infected , treatment  naïve participants , with 
and without HIV-1 co-infection, and  with no cirrhosis or with compensated 
cirrhosis only . This study will enroll  a cohort of participants with active 
HCV -infection to follow a minimal monitoring protocol , at US and non- US 
sites:  
 
 No pre- treatment HCV genotyping;  
 Entire treatment course (84 tablets) given to participants at entry; 
 No scheduled on- treatment laboratory monitoring or clinic visits;  
 Remote contact with participants at week 4 (adherence counseling 
and locator update) and week 22 ( scheduling of SVR visit  and locator 
update).  
 
Participants will receive the fixed- dose combination (FDC)  of 
sofosbuvir/v elpatasvir ( SOF/VEL ) for 12 weeks.    
 
DURATION  72 weeks  (see schematic diagram below ) 
 
SAMPLE SIZE 400 participants   
   
POPULATION  M en and women aged 18 years or older  with active HCV -infect ion of any 
genotype, HCV treatment naïve,  with or without HIV-1 co- infection . 
Persons  with either  compensated cirrhosis  or without evidence of 
cirrhosis  are eligible .  
 
STRATIFICATION  The study will use stratification factors to limit enrollment by certain 
subgroups. These stratification factors include geographical location 
(limited to no more than 132 participants enrolled from sites in the US 
within the overall study sample), HIV-1 infection (limited to no more than 
200 participants being HIV -1 positive within the overall study sample), 
and cirrhosis status (limited to no more than 80 participants within the 
overall study sample having compensated cirrhosis).  There are no 
additional r estrictions regarding participants who are both HIV -co-infected 
and have compensated cirrhosis, and or/geographical distribution of 
those participants .

 2.0 INTRODUCTION  
 2.1 Background  
 
Global HCV E pidemiology  
There are an estimated 71 million persons who are chronically infected with HCV 
globally  [1]. Almost 90% of these persons reside in low -and-middle -income countries  
(LMICs) . While t he highest prevalence of HCV has been observed in central and East 
Asia, North Africa and the Middle East, the majority of the people chronically infected with HCV are believed to be residing in South and East Asia (>50 million in each;
 Figure 
2.1-1) [2]. India alone is estimated to be home to over 20 million H CV-1 infected 
persons.  
 
HCV has high genetic diversity with the most genetic diversity being seen in Africa. GT  1 
is most prevalent worldwide, whereas GT 3 is found more commonly in south and 
southw est Asia. GT 4 and GT 5 are almost exclusively found in north -central and 
southern Africa, respectively. Genotype 6 is found almost exclusively in southeast Asia 
[3].  
 
 
Figure 2.1 -1: Global distribution of persons chronically infected with HCV  
Darker red colors indicate higher prevalence and the size of the circle reflects 
the absolute number of people living with HCV.

  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
HCV  treatment access has been limited in most LMICs  despite the advent of directly 
acting antivirals (DAAs ) since most therapy until recently demonstrated highest efficacy 
rates in GT1 infection . Unlike HIV therapy, HCV therapy has varying response rates  and 
treatment duration  by genotype [4] . For example, the fixed dose combination (FDC)  of 
SOF and ledipasvir  (SOF/LDV) that is associated with cure rates of 97 % in real -world 
cohorts of GT1 patients is not recommended for use in GT3 patients  [5]. Similarly, while 
12 weeks of SOF + RBV is recommended for GT1 infections, in persons infected with 
HCV GT3 the treatm ent duration recommended is 24 weeks  [5, 6].    
 
World Health Organization (WHO)/American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases 
(AASLD)/  Infection Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/European Association for the 
Study of the Liver (EASL) HCV Treatment  Guidelines  
 
AASLD/IDSA (www.hcvguidelines.org) and the EASL (www.easl.eu ) guidance for 
monitoring of patients receiving HCV therapy are among the most commonly used in 
clinical practice  (Table 2.1-1 ), given that treatment was not available outside of US and 
Europe until mid- 2015. The 2014 WHO treatment guidelines , the first guidance on 
management of HCV disease released by the WHO,  were based on AASLD and EASL 
recommendations and drug- registration literature available at that time. Preferable 
regimens according to the 2014 WHO guidelines are essentially interferon -based [7]. 
Since the WHO issued these first guidelines in 2014, several new medicines for the 
treatment of HCV infection have been introduced. Of these, daclatasvir ( DCV), ledipasvir   
(LDV) , and a combination of ombitasvir, paritaprevir and dasabuvir were added to the 
WHO Model List of Essential Medicines in 2015 [8]. Currently, the regimens 
recommended by WHO , and other country -specific treatment guidelines are guided by 
genotype and the future incorporation of these new drugs will probably need new guidance in terms of monitoring treatment.

Because the 2014 WHO guidelines primarily include Interferon -based regimens, the 
proposed monitoring process is intensive [7]. More recent monitoring guidelines can be 
found in the February 2016 AASLD/IDSA guidelines  [9], which recommend visits or 
telephone contact as clinically indicated during treatment to ensure medication 
adherence and to monitor for adverse events and potential drug- drug interactions with 
newly prescribed medications. Complete blood count (CBC), creatinine level, calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and hepatic function panel are recommended after 4 
weeks of treatment and as clinically indicated. Quantitative HCV viral load testing is recommended after 4 weeks of therapy and at 12 weeks following completion of therapy. 
If HCV RNA is detectable at week 4 of treatment, repeat quantitative HCV RNA viral load 
testing is recommended after 2 additional weeks of treatment  (i.e., week 6). If 
quantitative HCV viral load has increased by greater than 10- fold (>1 log10 international 
units  [IU]/mL) on repeat testing at week 6 (or thereafter), then discontinuation of HCV 
treatment is recommended. The significance of a positive HCV RNA test result a t week 4 
that remains positive but lower at week 6 or week 8 is unknown. No recommendation is provided regarding whether to stop therapy or extend therapy in this rare clinical 
situation [1].
  
 While the WHO in their 2016 guidelines  recommend a  simpler monitoring protocol when 
using interferon and RBV -free DAAs for the monitoring of HCV therapy  [8], their 
recommendations have never been implemented in clinical care settings and are based 
on the assumption that simplification of monitoring will not adversely impact the safety 
and efficacy of treatment. To date, minimal monitoring has not been validated in any setting. I ndeed, clinicians  in LMICs have also, to date, largely followed the AASLD and 
EASL guidelines  when delivering HCV therapy . As such, t he impact of the reduced 
clinical contact and on- treatment monitoring remains unknown at this time.  
 
Monitoring of HCV Therapy in Brazil  
The current Brazilian guidelines for HCV and co -infections management were released 
on June 2015  [10]. In general, following diagnosis by the presence of HCV antibodies, 
HCV RNA quantification is performed to confirm the diagnosis and repeated before treatment initiation. The measurement of HCV RNA is recommended at week 4 of 
treatment as a futility rule if the regimen is pegylated inte rferon (PEG -
IFN)/RBV/d aclatasvir (DCV). Also, HCV RNA at the end of the treatment (i .e., week 12) 
and 12 weeks after the end of treatment are indicated to define SVR. HCV genotyping is 
performed if the participant fulfills the cri teria to start treatment in order to define the 
genotype- specific regimen. Liver biopsy,  FibroS can or Aspartate Aminotransferase to 
Platelet Ratio Index ( APRI )/FIB-4 is mandatory to define treatment eligibility for DAAs 
 20 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
(DAA naïve, HCV monoinfected patients with Metavir F3 or F4, cirrhosis identified 
clinically or by ultrasound, cryoglobilinemia, among others). HIV co -infected patients are 
eligible for treatment regardless of the presence of fibrosis. The available DAAs currently 
distributed free of charge by the Ministry of Health are SOF, DCV and simeprevir  (SMV) . 
Distribution of DAA started in the beginning of 2016, so there has been very little experience with monitoring associated with these  regimen s. The Brazilian guidelines 
include recommendation for routine laboratory evaluation of chronic HCV, with and 
without cirrhosis, as well as for liver cancer screening but do not have specific recommendations in terms of treatment follow -up aside from HCV RNA. In clinical 
practice, standard monitori ng of HCV th erapy will depend on  the modality of treatment 
and physician expertise. According to the Brazilian Infectious Diseases Society (BIDS) 
recommendation, treatment monitoring should include serum chemistries ( i.e., AST, 
ALT, GGT, Alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin prothrombin and albumin), renal function ( i.e., 
creatinine,  blood urea nitrogen), CBC, glucose, sodium and potassium as minimum 
monitoring for safety  at the end of the first month of treatment. Additional laboratory 
evaluations should be done according to specific patient needs, as well as repeated, if 
clinically necessary. In terms of viral response, the BIDS  suggest ion is to repeat  HCV 
RNA  PCR (polymerase chain reaction)  at week 4 in order to evaluate adherence and at 
post-treatment week s 12 and 24 to evaluate SVR  [11].

Monitoring of HCV Therapy in India 
Clinicians in India treating HCV -infected patients , primarily medical gastroenterologists,  
follow the Indian National Association for the Study of Liver guidelines  [12]. There is no 
special training for infectious diseases such as a fellowship following residency in India and most infectious diseases are treated by internist s. Until December 2015, SOF, 
pegylated interferons,  and RBV  (SOF+PEG -IFN/RBV  [PR]) were the only drugs 
 21 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
available in India. As of December 2015, DCV and LDV have also become available. 
The standard practice for initiation  of HCV therapy are quantification of HCV RNA  
following diagnosis by the presence of HCV antibodies, and HCV genotyping if HCV 
RNA is detected. Given the majority of patients (>75%) are GT3, the most commonly 
used regimen in India currently is SOF+DCV for 12 weeks with addition of RBV in 
cirrhotics. Hemogram and liver function tests are at 4 -week intervals – additionally, if 
SOF+PR is selected, additional tests recomme nded when using interferon (e .g., thyroid 
stimulating hormone, alfa fetoprotein) are performed prior to initiation of therapy . HCV 
RNA quantification is also routinely performed at end of treatment  (EOT) and if 
undetectable at EOT, an additional HCV RNA quantification is performed 12 weeks later 
to ascertain SVR status. The generic version of SOF/VEL was approved for use in Indi a 
in May 2017.   
 
Monitoring of HCV Therapy in Thailand 
As of January 05, 2017 , PR remains the standard of care  (SOC)  in national free -HCV 
treatment program. SOF and DCV have been registered in Thailand since October 2015 
but have been inaccessible because of the price. Approximately 700,000 Thais are 
suffering from chronic HCV infection of which HCV GT 3 is the most prevalent genotype 
(40-50%), followed by GT 1 (30- 40%), and GT 6 (15- 20%). Previous studies  showed that 
about 70% of Thai  HCV -infected participants  had significant liver fibrosis and 30% of 
them met the definition for cirrhosis, especially in HIV -1 co-infected individuals, but were 
unable to receive HCV treatment due to financial constr aints.   
 Currently, there is no national guideline for monitoring HCV therapy  in Thailand. Thai 
hepatologists usually treat chronic HCV based on the AASLD/IDSA guidelines. In 
Thailand, SOF and DCV are still expensive; therefore, HCV treatment is prioritized for 
patients who have an urgent medi cal need for HCV treatment. Diagnosis by the 
presence of HCV antibodies is followed by a non- invasiv e assessment of liver disease 
(FibroS can or APRI), to clarify whether the patient  has an urgent need for  HCV 
treatment. If APRI>1 or FibroS can>7.5KPa, HCV R NA quantification and HCV 
genotyping are performed. For 12 weeks of SOF+PR, CBC and blood chemistries are  
performed at 4- week intervals. Furthermore, additional safety laboratory tests such as 
thyroid- stimulating hormone are performed prior to initiation of therapy. For female 
patients, pregnancy testing is performed every 4 weeks until 6 months after completing the therapy. For interferon- free regimens  (SOF+DCV for GT3 or LDV/SOF for GT 1  and 
GT 6), CBC and blood chemistry are done prior to treatment and at 12 weeks post -
treatment. For all regimens, a  HCV RNA is performed on-treatment at  week  4 and post-
treatment at week 12 (SVR). 
 
Monitoring of HCV Therapy in the US  
As discussed above, HCV treatment guidance is provided by the AASLD/IDSA Panel and updated frequently on www.HCVguidelines.org . The US Panel recommends 
evaluation of the patients prior to and during HCV treatment with oral DAA regimens.  Specifically, the US Panel recommends visits or telephone contact as clinically indicated 
during treatment to ensure medication adherence and to monitor for adverse events 
(AEs) and potential drug- drug interactions with newly prescribed medications. After 4 
weeks of treatment, laboratory assessment including CBC, creatinine level, calculated 
 22 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
GFR, and hepatic function panel are recommended with additional testing as clinically 
indicated. Quantit ative HCV viral load testing is r ecommended after 4 weeks of therapy 
and at 12 weeks following completion of therapy.  If HCV RNA is detectable at week 4 of 
treatment, repeat quantitative HCV RNA viral load testing is recommended after 2 
additional weeks of treatment (i.e. , wee k 6). If quantitative HCV viral -load has increased 
by greater than 10- fold (>1 log10 IU/mL) on repeat testing at week 6 (or thereafter), then 
discontinuation of HCV treatment is recommended. In the US, the standard clinical practice is to evaluate patients taking HCV DAA therapy every 4 weeks during a typical 
12-week treatment course with office visits and laboratory testing. In addition, HCV DAA 
therapy  is dispensed by commercial pharmacy and patients are required to interact with 
their pharmacy every 4 weeks during treatment , and HCV RNA monitoring after 4 weeks 
of treatment is often required to meet criteria for ongoing treatment.

demonstrated, potent antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo against HCV GT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
and 6 (pan- genotypic)  [13, 14, 15]. SOF was  approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) in October 2013 and is widely available across the world, including 
as a generic agent manufactured in India which has the license to distribute SOF in 102 
countries . Velpatasvir  (VEL)  is an oral, second generation inhibitor of HCV NS5A with 
demonstrated potent antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo against HCV GT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
and 6 ( pan-genotypic). VEL was  evaluated with SOF as a FDC  tablet (SOF 400 mg/VEL 
100mg) taken by mouth once daily for 12 weeks in four clinical trials (ASTRAL -1, 2, 3, 
and 5) , which included participants with HCV GT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 with HIV -1 co-
infection (ASTRAL -5) [16] and among HCV mono- infection (ASTRAL 1, 2, 3) [17, 18] 
with and without compensated cirrhosis. The regimen evaluated was interferon- and 
RBV-free. Of note, ASTRAL- 4 tested SOF/VEL in participants  with decompensated 
cirrhosis (Child -Turcotte- Pugh classification B, [CTP B ]); patients with CTP B or C are 
excluded from the present study  [19]. Overall, the efficacy of SOF/VEL was high with 
SVR observed in 95- 99% of participants ( Table 2.1-3 ). In ASTRAL 1, 2, and 3, no HCV 
relapse was observed between the post -treatment week 12 ( SVR) and post -treatment 
week 24 (SVR 24), which is consistent with HCV eradication or cure. In the ASTRAL- 1 
(HCV GT 1, 2, 4, 5, 6) study, SOF/VEL was compared to placebo tablets (delayed 
treatment group) in a double- blind manner. Importantly, no difference in safety and 
tolerability was observed between SOF/VEL and placebo, with respect to the quantity 
and quality of reported AEs and observed laboratory abnormalities . In the ASTRAL -2 
(HCV GT 2) and ASTRAL -3 (HCV GT 3) studies, SOF/VEL was compared to SOF + 
RBV in randomized controlled trials. SOF/VEL was superior to SOF + RBV with respect 
to SVR (efficacy) as well as safety and tolerability.  In ASTRAL -5, two patients were 
incarcerated and hence did not have access to study drug while in prison, which resulted 
in failure to achieve SVR. In pooled analyses  of data of participants  from ASTRAL 1,  2 
and 3, the overall efficacy was estimated to 98%.  Epclusa (fixed dose single tablet 
regimen  of SOF/VEL) was approved by the US FDA on June 28, 2016. A marketing 
application for SOF/VEL has also been approv ed by the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA)  on July 06, 2016 .

As pa rt of the ASTRAL trials , participants were subject to an intense follow up, wherein 
clinic visits with  or without laboratory testing , and adherence counseling were performed 
at baseline, weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10  and 12. Such an intense followup schedule is difficult to 
implement in the real world . However, it is encouraging that the monitoring practices 
current ly followed as listed in Table 2.1-2 (above) for the delivery of other agents such 
as SOF/LDV in real-world  cohorts , such as the  HCV TARGET  [20] and TRIO [21] 
cohort , have resulted in SVR rates that are comparable to what were observed in the 
ION clinical trials of SOF/LDV.  Therefore, it  is likely that real -world SVR rates of 
SOF/VEL , with standard monitoring practices currently being used , will reflect what was 
observed in the ASTRAL trials.

Reinfection, Relapse, Cure 
Optimism for the eradication of HCV has been largely driven by the ability to cure HCV 
infection in a relatively short duration of time using agents tha t are safe and well 
tolerated. HCV c ure, in the DAA era,  is defined as the absence of HCV RNA in a 
quantitative PCR assay 12 weeks after the completion of treatment. However, it is important to note that HCV treatment induced cure is not associated with immunity to 
new HCV infection following exposure in the future.  There are two important caveats that 
need to be considered in the management of HCV namely, relapse and reinfection. A 
 24 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0

small proportion of patients remain free of HCV at the end of treatment but exhibit HCV 
viremia at a time point thereaf ter (SVR or later) —this scenario could be attributable 
either to relapse or re- infection. HCV sequencing is required to distinguish one from the 
other. If the sequence of the virus observed is genetically identical to the sequence that was observed at baseline, the person is considered to have relapsed. However, if  the 
sequence observed post SVR is unrelated to the sequence observed at baseline, the 
individual is considered to have been re -infected. In the pooled ASTRAL studies data 
which comprised particip ants from ASTRAL 1,  2, and 3 (n=1035), there were 12 
relapses and 1 reinfection [16 , 17, 18, 19; see summary here- 
http://www.gilead.com/news/press -releases/2015/9/gilead- announces -svr12 -rates -from-

and-velpatasvir -vel-gs5816- for-the-treatment -of-all-six-hepatitis -c-genotypes . In recent 
data presented from Australia and New Zealand [22, 23] , re-infection was observed in 5 
out of 54 participants (Incidence of re -infection: 8.88 per 100 p- y) who had undetectable 
HCV RNA at EOT —active  injection drug use was the strongest predictor of re- infection.  
Data on relapse and re -infection f rom settings in LMICs such as the study sites included 
in this study trial are lacking.   
 
Access to and Use of Mobile Phones and Text Messaging Among Non- US Sites  
Mobile phones and associated social media and messaging services are widely 
available in the participating countries. For example, in Brazil, WhatsApp  is commonly 
used to contact participants and remind them of clinic visits. In India, text messaging servi ces are used to remind participants of clinic visits. 
 
2.2 Rationale 
 
The MINMON strategy that is being proposed to evaluate in this study includes the 
following components:  
 
a) No pre- treatment genotyping  
b) Entire treatment course (84 tablets) given to participant  at baseline 
c) No scheduled on- treatment clinic visits  
d) No scheduled on- treatment monitoring 
e) Remote contact with participants at w eek 4 (adherence counseling and locator 
update) and week 22 (scheduling of SVR visit  and locator update) 
 The rationale for each of these components are listed below:  
 No pre- treatment genotyping: The availability of pan- genotypic HCV treatment regimens 
preclude the need for HCV genotyping. Prior to SOF/DAC and SOF/VEL, genotyping was used to select treatment regimen and/or treatment duration. However, SOF/VEL has demonstrated high levels of efficacy across genotypes 1- 6 and is approved by the 
US FDA for management of HCV disease in GT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. The generic version of the fixed dose single- tablet regimen of SOF/VEL was recently approved for production 
by Indian generic manufactures for use in India and in 102 additional countries. SOF/VEL is also being utilized as the primary treatment regimen in at least two countries with ongoing robust HCV elimination programs, Iceland and Georgia.  
 25 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
Entire treatment course (84 tablets) given to participant  at baseline and no on- treatment 
planned clinic visits:  Most HCV treatment programs require patients to come in for refills 
on a 4 -weekly basis and in some cases, every  2 weeks (e .g., Chennai, India). These 
visits could take considerable amount of time when accounting for travel and waiting 
time at the facility resulting in loss of wages. In the US, ensuring insurance papers are in 
place poses an additional burden to the patient. During these visits, patients are 
essentially provided with the next 2 - or 4-week supply, a physician consult and a lab 
draw for HCV RNA monitoring and/or safety labs. Given the safety and efficacy profile of 
SOF/VEL, it is possible that providing patients with the entire 12- week supply  of HCV 
treatment at initiation and not requiring any in- person follow -up could result in similar 
SVR rates as observed in the ASTRAL trials or real -world HCV cohorts such as 
TARGET and TRIO. Many HIV clinics globally provide ART  for 3- 6 month periods and 
viral suppression rates appear to be comparable to programs requiring participants to 
come in more frequently. More importantly, reducing the number of on -treatment clinic 
visits could minimize lost wages and dramatically decrease costs even in countries such 
as the US where manpower (physician/nurse/pharmacist) costs are significantly higher 
than in other settings. Further, the reduction in the number of clinic visits could 
potentially allow the clinic to deliver care to more patients with the same manpower. The 
provision of the entire 12 -week supply at initiation could also improve adherence and 
consequently, outcomes in populations who are at risk for HCV infection and travel 
frequently (e .g., truck drivers).  
 No scheduled on- treatment monitoring : In the ASTRAL- 1 trial the safety profile of 
SOF/VEL was comparable to that of the placebo arm —this raises the question of the 
necessity of on -treatment safety monitoring in a large majority of the patients. Further, 
given the relatively  short treatment duration (12 weeks) and absence of stopping rules 
for futility, the role of on -treatment HCV RNA monitoring is also debatable. HCV RNA 
testing is currently recommended and usually ordered at on -treatment week 4 and EOT 
(in some settings) t o assess adherence and to detect on- therapy virologic breakthrough. 
Virologic breakthrough is rare with SOF/VEL and has been generally linked to very poor adherence. In a pooled analysis of data from the ASTRAL trials on- treatment HCV RNA 
was not shown to be predictive of treatment response. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the HCV treatment course would be modified by the results of on -treatment RNA 
quantification. This is an important issue in LMIC settings where access to HCV RNA 
quantification is limited (and expensive where available) and the reduction in the number of these tests from treatment protocols is expected to greatly improve access. Therefore, 
the study team  proposes no planned on -treatment safety or HCV RNA monitoring. Of 
importance, participants  with decompensated cirrhosis and chronic HBV infection 
(HBsAg positive)  will be excluded from the study  as these participants  will not be eligible 
for a MINMON strategy ; it is equally important to note that these groups probably 
account for <20%  of persons chronically -infected with HCV globally.  
 
Remote contact with participants at week 4 (adherence counseling and locator update) 
and week 22 (scheduling of SVR visit  and locator update):  In the real world, programs 
are measured by their success in objectively quantifiable outcomes. For example, in 
HIV, viral suppression is the gold standard to assess program effectiveness. Similarly, for HCV, proportion of patients achieving SVR is the gold standard for the assessment of 
 26 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
treatment programs. There are two critical components to achieving SVR: (1) Treatment 
persistence (taking an adequate duration of therapy) and adherence (taking daily 
SOF/VEL); and (2) confirmation of HCV eradication (SVR) at least 12 weeks after 
completing treatment. In the US, approximately 20% of patients who complete treatment 
do not return for SVR assessment in a timely manner. In global HCV programs, such as 
the free HCV program in Punjab, India, program staff are currently facing challenges 
bringing patients back in for the SVR assessment visit and are using different strategies 
to track patients.  
 According to the AASLD/IDSA guidelines  [5, 9], the recommended approach to 
encourage treatment persistence/adherence and confirmation of SVR is pharmacist and/or clinicians contact with participants every 4 weeks and in most non-US setting s, 
HCV treatment programs and treating clinicians require patients to come in for refills or safety labs at least once every 4 weeks, if not more frequently. Therefore, this study will  
leverage existing technology to conduct remote contacts with participants at two time 
points dur ing the course of treatment and assessment of SVR. The remote contact will 
also be associated with minimal costs, which we will capture and factor into the cost analysis.  
 
It is anticipate d that  these remote contacts will  last less than 5 minutes and therefore, do 
not foresee this as burdensome on the staff as several programs already use similar approaches to track participants. The week 4 contact is not designed to be an intensive 
adherence intervention, rather a quick adherence check, clarification of the regimen, and 
re-enforcement of the importance of adherence early in the course of treatment . Despite 
detailed instructions at the time of clinical encounters , many participants  may leave 
unsure of medical instructions. Therefore,  the week 4 remote contact is in keeping with 
good clinical practice and will optimize outcomes in the subset of participants who may 
have misunderstood or have questions or concerns about the study medication. 
Responses will be standardized based on reasons for non -adherence: e.g., forgot,  side 
effects, chose not to take, lost study medication , or decided to stop. Standardizing 
responses will ensure that participants receive the same type of support regardless o f 
the mechanism used (i.e. , phone, text, WhatsApp, etc. ) This simple and inexpensive 
remote contact will also be helpful in assessing the success of the MINMON approach 
both in the trial and in the real world, as it may be possible for programs to estimate outcomes of participants who do not return for SVR assessment using week 4 
adherence data. Given the advances in technology and widespread adapt ation of newer 
informatics , remote participant  contact  could be pre- programmed to provide support and 
collect information at specific intervals, and the study team  believes that these newer 
forms of remote contact will be increasingly used in medicine.  
 An additional incentive for attending the SVR visit will be included in this clinical trial. The rationale is to minimize lost-to-follow -up (LTFU ) and measure SVR in as many 
participants as possible to validate the MINMON strategy. Any participant who does not return for the SVR visit will be considered a failure even if the true outcome was HCV 
cure with SOF/VEL. In light of the importance of determining the SVR outcome of the  
 27 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
MINMON study for  the applicability of this strategy outside the trial setting, this additional 
measure,  an incentive for attending the SVR assessment , is intended to minimize 
missed SVR visits . We will incorporate the value of this incentive into the cost -analysis.  
 
If the monitoring protocol that is being  proposed is found to be efficacious  and 
comparable to what is currently being observed in clinical settings globally , it would imply 
that the HCV -infected persons , for the large part , could be treated from settings with 
minimal infrastructure. In fact, HCV care could be rolled out of primary health care 
centers where routine blood work is available—at baseline, one would need to perform a complete blood panel, hepatic function panel and a renal panel to stage liver disease. 
Point -of-care HCV antibody tests are already available. If the individual is a 
decompensated cirrhotic, he/she could be referred to a tertiary care center. If not, 
treatment could be initiated following HCV RNA quantification. The availability of t he 
GeneXpert cartridges for quantification of HCV RNA [24] has the potential to transform 
any center with electricity and an individual with high- school level of education to 
perform HCV RNA quantification. There are approximately four to five times the number  
of people living with HCV globally compared to HIV —to ensure that treatment reaches 
them all and to truly have a shot at eradication of HCV, it is critical to improve access 
while reducing cost and associated treatment complexities.    
 
However, what is being p roposed is novel but high- risk and has never been piloted for 
the delivery of HCV care. It is possible that adherence and treatment completion rates , if 
the entire treatment supply is provided upfront with no health care contact thereafter for  
the remainder of the treatment duration, could be inferior to the SOC . This single -arm 
study,  open to US and non- US sites, will enroll 400 participants , all of who m will be 
followed using the MINMON protocol only . The rationale for limiting  enrollment  of HIV-
coinfected participants to <50% is to ensure the findings of this trial are generalizable to 
all HCV infected persons. Given that this trial will be recruiting from ACTG sites that are 
primarily HIV clinics, it is highly possible that there may be an overrepresentation of HIV-
infected persons.  
 The rationale for limiting enrollment of cirrhotics  to <20%  is also to ensure that the 
sample is representative of all HCV- infected persons globally. Since this study seeks to 
evaluate a low -cost treatment delivery strategy aimed at promoting the elimination 
agenda, the primary target population will be the >90% of the HCV -infected persons who 
are unaware of their status —it is likely the >80% of these individuals will be non- cirrhotic. 
Cirrhotic individuals are more likely to engage in care with more frequent clinic visits and 
consequently, more likely to be recruited into the study.  
 
Further, the findings from this study will inform the need for a future randomized clinical 
trial (RCT) that will compare the MINMON approach versus  SOC. If the findings from this 
trial conclusively indicate that the MINMON approach achieves high SVR (>96%) that is  
comparable to what is observed in routine clinical s ettings, a RCT  will not be needed as 
a high benchmark for SVR will be met. Conversely , if findings from this study  
conclusively indicate that the MINMON approach is inferior (evidence than SVR is <95%), an RCT will not be needed as a low benchmark for SVR will have been met and the characteristics of the MINMON approach will need to be reconsidered.  Finally, if 
 28 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
neither a high nor low benchmarks is met (ie, observed SVR 93- 97%), this study will 
inform the design and sample size of a potential future RCT comparing the MINMON 
approach to SOC.  
 
Plan for E nrollment of Subpopulations  
There are no exclusion criteria related to gender or race. The FDC of SOF/VEL  was not 
associated with adverse developmental outcomes in animal studies. However, this combination has not been studied extensively in pregnant women [EPCLUSA pac kage 
insert, 2016]. Therefore, we will exclude pregnant women and women of reproductive potential who are unwilling to use contraceptives while on study treatment.   
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 
This study will enroll 4 00 participants who will be followed using a MIN MON protocol f or 
a duration of 24 weeks in order to obtain primary outcome information regarding SVR 
status , as well as additional information for secondary objectives over the longer 
duration of 72 weeks. The MINMON strategy is comprised of: 1) minimal pre-treatment 
assessment including confirmation of viremia by HCV RNA and liver disease staging using routine  clinical exam and  non-invasive parameters (ALT, AST, and platelet count  
[and bilirubin, albumin, and INR in persons with evidence of cirrhosis by FIB-4]) and no 
genotyping ; 2) distribution of complete HCV treatment course at study initiation  (i.e., 84 
days of SOF/VEL); 3) no planned on- treatment laboratory monitoring; 4) no planned 
clinic or pharmacy visits  prior to SVR evaluation; and 5) remote con tact at treat ment 
week 4 and post -treatment at week 22 to update locator information and to facilitate 
attendance at the SVR evaluation visit (week s 22 to 28). The week 4 remote contact will 
include adherence assessment and reinforcement  which is also considered to  be a part 
of the MINMON strategy .  
 All participants will be treatment -naïve, with active HCV -infect ion, with or without HIV -1 
co-infection, and if cirrhotic, will be classified as compensated cirrhotics based on CTP 
score. All participants will receive study -provided treatment (FDC of SOF/VEL)  for a 
duration of 12 weeks followed by  evaluation 12 weeks  later to ascertain SVR status . 
Upon SVR evaluation, all participants will enter Step 2 of the study and will be followed 
for an additional 48 weeks  to examine liver disease regression post -SVR, measure the 
incidence of HCV re- infection , and other non- primary outcomes . Measures of disease 
regression after cure are important to understanding future disease burden  and cost 
associated with liver disease. Reinfection rates are critically important for both public 
health planning and advocacy purposes when seeking to expand the availability of HCV 
treatments. In addition, cost-benefit analyses  will be conducted using cost data and 
outcomes gathered from this study.  
 At entry  (Step 1) , all participants will receive the entire study -provided treatment supply , 
following study entry procedures, with the first dose being observed by study staff . The 
next planned study visit is the key primary outcome evaluation for SVR, scheduled at 
week 24. There will be no planned interim in- person study  visits with participants 
between entry  and week 24.  Detailed locator information will be collected at entry  (see 
section 6.3.21). In lieu of resource intensive in- person study visits, between entry and 
 29 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
the primary outcome evaluation at the week 24 visit, sites will contact participants at 
weeks 4 and 22, via a remote mechanism based upon the participant’s  choic e and 
availability, in order to assess adherence status  at week 4 and to schedule the SVR 
evaluation visit at week 24, as well as update the locator information. At week 4, t he 
participant will be asked if he/she is  taking the study medication and about adherence , 
changes in contact information, and reminders for the study visit for SVR evaluation. If 
participants report sub- optimal adherence or that they are not taking their HCV 
medication, they will be read (if a phone contact) or message  (if remote con tact is via 
email/text message/WhatsApp) a standard script highlighting the benefits of HCV 
therapy and the importance of adherence.  They will also be asked about reasons for 
their non -adherence and then receive standardized encouragement and clarification 
about the medication and importance of adherence. There will be no further site-initiated 
interaction with the participant  until week 22, at which time participants will be queried 
about any changes to their contact information and will also be reminded o f their 
upcoming SVR visit. These contacts are designed to help keep participants engaged 
with the study and keep their contact information up to date in order to minimize LTFU  
prior to the primary outcome- evaluation of SVR. Resource utilization, including staff time 
(both for remote contact as well as unplanned study visits) and any associated 
laboratory or other tests ordered during unplanned clinic visits (e.g. , Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging [MRI], ultrasonogram, blood tests) will be documented, tr anslated to 
costs using reimbursement rates from WHO CHOICE and the U.S. Center For Medicare and Medicaid Services, and incorporated into the cost analysis.   
 Following the SVR evaluation visit, which is expected to be at week 24, all participants  
will en ter Step 2 for two additional scheduled post -SVR evaluation study visits at weeks 
48 and 72. At each of these Step 2 study visits, a blood sample will be drawn and liver disease will be staged in all participants using FIB -4 (and calculated CTP if cirrhoti c), 
and where available, liver elastogr aphy , in addition to the  Model for End- Stage Liver 
Disease (MELD) score. Participants who have SVR evaluation after week 24 will enter 
Step 2 at the time of SVR evaluation and the schedule of an additional post-SVR 
evaluation visits will be dependent on the week of Step  2 entry. Step 2 will end at week 
72, from the time of study entry, independent of the time of Step 2 entry (for example, a 
participant who undergoes SVR evaluation at week 60 will have one remote contact visit 
at week 68 and a final visit at week 72).

4.1.6 HIV-1 infection status documented as either absent or present, as defined below:  
 
Absence of HIV -1 infection, as documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or 
HIV-1 enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit, within 60 
days prior to entry.  
 OR 
 HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV -1 E/CIA test 
kit at any time prior to entry and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV -1 antigen or plasma HIV -1 RNA viral load.  
 NOTE: The term "licensed" refers to a US FDA -approved kit, which is 
recommended. For sites that are unable to obtain an FDA -approved kit, a kit that 
has been certified or licensed by an oversight body within the country and 
validated internally is acceptable.  
 WHO and CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines 
mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is different 
from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test should be 
confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a 
different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (e.g. , indirect versus 
competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV- 1 RNA viral load .

4.5 Study Enrollment Procedures  
 
4.5.1  Prior to implementation of this protocol, and any subsequent full- version 
amendments, each site must have the protocol and the protocol consent form(s) 
approved, as appropriate, by their local institutional review board (IRB)/ethics 
committee (EC) and any other applicable regulatory entity (RE). Upon receiving 
final approval, sites will submit all required protocol registration documents to the 
DAIDS Protocol Registration Office (DAIDS PRO) at the Regulatory Support 
Center (RSC). The DAIDS PRO will review the submitted protocol registration packet to ensure that all of the required documents have been received.  
 
Site-specific informed consent forms (ICFs) WILL be reviewed and approved by 
the DAIDS PRO, and sites will receive an Initial Registration Notification from the DAIDS PRO that indicates successful completion of the protocol registration process. A copy of the Initial Registration Notification should be retained in the 
site’s regulatory files. 
 Upon receiving final IRB/EC and any other applicable RE approval(s) for the 
amendment, sites should implement the amendment  immediately. Sites are 
required to submit an amendment registration packet to the DAIDS PRO at the 
RSC. Site -specific ICF(s) WILL  be reviewed and approved by the DAIDS PRO, 
and sites will receive an Amendment Registration Notification from the DAIDS PRO t hat approves the site- specific ICFs and indicates successful completion of 
the amendment protocol registration process. A copy of the final Amendment Registration Notification issued by the DAIDS PRO should be retained in the 
site’s regulatory files. 
 
For additional information on the protocol registration process and specific 
documents required for initial and amendment registrations, refer to the current version of the DAIDS Protocol Registration Manual.

  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
Once a candidate for study entry has been identified, details will be carefully 
discussed with the participant . The participant  will be asked to read and sign the  
approved protocol consent form .  
 For participant s from whom a signed informed consent has been obtained, an 
ACTG Screening Checklist  must be entered through the Data Management 
Center (DMC) Participant  Enrollment System.  
 
4.5.2  Protocol Activation  
Prior to enrollment, sites must complete the Protocol Activation Checklist found 
on the ACTG Member website. This checklist must be approved prior to any 
screening of participants for enrollment.  
 
4.5.3  Participant  Registration  
 
For participant s from whom informed consent has been obtained, but who are 
deemed ineligible or who do not enroll into the initial protocol step,  an ACTG 
Screening Failure Results form  must be keyed into the database .  
 
Participants who meet the enrollment criteria will be registered to the study 
according to standard ACTG DMC procedures.  
 
4.6 Co-enrollment Guidelines   
 
US sites are encouraged to co- enroll participant s in A5128, “P lan for Obtaining  Informed 
Consent  to Use S tored  Human B iological M aterials  (HBM) for Currently  Unspecified 
Analyses .” Co-enrollment in A5128 does not require permission from the A5360 protocol 
chairs.  
 
Non-US sites are encouraged to co- enroll participants in A5243, “Plan for Obtaining 
Human Biological Samples at Non- U.S. Clinical Research Sites for Currently 
Unspecified Genetic Analyses.”  Co-enrollment in  A5243 does not require permission 
from the A5360  protocol chairs.  
 
For specific questions  and approval  for co -enrollment in other studies,  sites should first 
check the PSWP or  contact the protocol team  via email  as described in the Study 
Management section.  
 
If there are concerns about exceeding volume limits for blood draws, please note that A5128 and A5243 allow participants to consent to the study without allowing a blood sample to be collected. In these cases, if a future study wants to evaluate a participant’s 
DNA sometime later, sites would be able to access a stored aliquot from the initial study 
(if there are any available). It is also possible for a participant to enroll into A5128 or 
A5243 and postpone the required blood draw until a later time. For more input, contact 
the A5128 or A5243 teams.

5.0 STUDY TREATMENT  
 
Study treatment is  defined as the once- daily oral FDC sofosbuvir/ velpatasvir ( SOF/VEL  
[Tradename: Epclusa]) containing 400 mg of SOF and 100mg of VEL . If a participant is 
co-infected with HIV, HIV medications will NOT be provided as part of this study.   
 
5.1 Regimens, Administration, and Duration  
 
5.1.1  Regimen s 
 
Participants will receive FDC SOF/VEL  (400mg/100mg) orally once daily with or 
without food. 
 
5.1.2  Administration and Duration 
 
Participants will take SOF/VEL orally once daily with or without food  and will 
receive treatment for a duration of 12 weeks.  Study staff will observe the first 
dose being taken by the participant upon completion of all entry evaluations . 
Participants should be instructed to open and finish one bottle of study product at 
a time.  When the participant takes the last pill o f SOF/VEL from each bottle, 
he/she will be instructed to contact the site to report the completion of the bottle. 
Participants will, therefore, contact a site a maximum of three times to indicate 
completion of a bottle. See A5360 MOPS for additional information on reporting 
of treatment stop date.  
 In the scenario of lost study medication, the participant will be asked to contact 
the study site as soon as possible. If the participant has been off study 
medication less than 2 weeks ( ≤14 days), he/she  will be eligible for a one -time 
replacement of study medication to complete the 12 week course. Participants 
who report a subsequent loss of study medication will not be eligible for 
replacement and will enter the follow- up phase (week 24 visit). If the participant 
has not taken study medication for more than 2 weeks (≥15 days), study medication will not be replaced and the participant will enter the follow -up phase 
(week 24 visit).  
 
5.2 Study Product Formulation and Preparation  
 
5.2.1  Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir manufactured by Gilead Sciences, Inc. , will be supplied

6.2 Timing of Evaluations  
 
6.2.1 Screening Evaluations   
 
Screening evaluations must occur prior to the participant  starting any study 
medications, treatments, or interventions.  
 Screening evaluations to determine eligibility must be completed within 35 days 
prior to study entry unless otherwise specified  in section 4.0 . 
 
In addition to data being collected on participant s who enroll into the study, 
demographic, clinical, and laboratory data on persons who do not enroll  will be 
captured in an eCRF  and entered into the ACTG database.  
 
6.2.2 Step 1 Entry  Evaluations  
 
Step 1 entry evaluations must occur at least 24 h ours after screening  
evaluations , unless otherwise specified.  
 
Participants are expected to begin treatment with SOF/VEL within 24 hours after 
registration and upon completion of entry evaluations . The first dose of SOF/VEL 
will be provided to the participant and observed by study staff.   
 
6.2.3  Step 2 Registration Evaluations  
 
Participants who meet criteria in section 4.3 will register to Step 2 on the same 
day of the last visit on Step 1 and be followed per the SOE.  
 6.2.4 Post-Entry Evaluations  
 
Given the design of the MINMO N strategy, there will be  no on- treatment or EOT 
evaluations. See section 6.3.22  for post-entry site contact with participants via 
remote mechanism .  
 
Post-Treatment Evaluations   
Step 1: Following treatment completion at week 12 , participants  will undergo 
evaluations as outlined in the SOE 6.1-1. 
 NOTE : If the participant comes in for the week 24 visit during the -14 days 
window (i.e. , week 22), then the week 22 remote call is not needed.  
 
Week 24/ SVR Evaluation Visit 
The week 24  visit (visit window: week 22 -28) is ideally the visit where SVR 
should be assessed for all participants , and subsequently  they will be registered 
to Step 2. However, if a participant misses the visit window (>week 28), the week 
24 visit will be considered a misse d visit and he/she will need to be schedule d for 
an SVR visit prior to being registered to Step 2 of the study. The SVR visit can 
 43 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
take place at any time  point after week 28  and up to  week 72 and is mandat ory 
for the participant to be registered to Step 2.  
 
NOTE: Participants will be reminded of t he week 24/ SVR visit during the rem ote 
contact (at weeks 4 and 22), and participants only need to complete either the week 24 OR the SVR evaluation visit; they will not be required to complete both. 
If a p articipant completes week 24, his/her next visit will be at week 48  on Step 2. 
If a participant misses the week 24 visit and returns to the clinic for the SVR visit either at week 48 or 72, then only the SVR evaluations will be performed at that 
visit time  point.  Evaluations for week s 48 or 72 will be performed at the next 
scheduled study visit. However,  if a participant completes their SVR visit at w eek 
72, this visit will be  the partic ipants’ last study visit and they  will not enter Step 2.  
 
Step 2 Registration  
Following completion of the SVR evaluation on Step 1 (Week 24 OR SVR visit) , 
participants will be registered to Step 2 on that same day . Participants will 
undergo evaluations as outlined in the SOE 6.1 -2, within the +28-days visit 
window, as appropriate for the visit.  
 
NOTE: Participants who register into Step 2 within the week 48 visit window will 
complete the week 48 and 72 visits. If a participant registers into Step 2 after the 
week 48 visit window, site staff should have the participant return to the clinic to 
compl ete week 72 (final study visit).  
 
6.2.5  Study Completion Evaluations  
 
For Step 2, week 72 ±28-days will be the final study visit for all participants, 
independent of the entry week for Step 2.  
 For participants who do not enter Step 2, the final study visit will be the last visit 
they had on Step 1, regardless of when that occurred.  
 
6.2.6 Event -Driven Evaluations  
 
Step 1: Unplanned Study Visits  
Unplanned study visits should not occur after week 22 on Step 1.  
 The purpose of unplanned visits, should they occur, is to address common 
toxicities. Participants will be provided with a telephone number that they can call 
if they are having any problems (e .g., headache, fever, nausea, etc.) during the 
study treatment period (day 0 through week 12). Participants will be connected to 
the study staff who will talk to them and try to resolve the issue over the phone, 
whenever possible. Only if the study staff feels further investigations are required 
to resolve the complaint, an unplanned study visit should be scheduled within 5 
days with the participant so that additional investigations, as deemed appropriate 
by the study staff, may be performed. It is possible no tests are ordered or tests not included in the SOE are ordered; however, while the protocol does not 
 44 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
require any testing to be performed at these unplanned visits, if any laboratory  
test is ordered ( e.g., safety labs ), a plasma specimen should be stored.  
  
NOTE: If any laboratory, radiology , or other tests are ordered, they should be 
justified by medical need. Labs drawn for safety purposes are permitted. Any tests ordered are not meant to serve as an early indicator of a participant’s HCV 
treatment response. The performance of HCV RNA testing at unplanned study 
visits is strongly discouraged  and should be discussed with the core team . The 
purpose of these unplanned visits, should they occur, is to deal with common 
toxicities.    
 If a participant provides information about study treatment disposition, use (or 
change in use) of reportable concomitant medications, or gives information about reportable adverse events (e .g., AEs leading to change in study treatment 
regardless of severity grade)  at this unplanned study visit, then this information 
should be captured on the appropriate eCRFs.   
 
Participants who become pregnant while on study medications or up to week 22 
should contact the site to schedule an unplanned study visit (see section 8.3 for 
details ). 
 
6.2.7  Discontinuation  
 
Evaluations for Participant s Who Do Not Start Study Treatment  
All eCRFs must be keyed for the period up to and including the entry visit.  
 
Premature Treatment Discontinuation  
Participants who plan or who have discontinued their study medication prior to 
completing the full 84-day course will have been instructed to contact the site to 
alert them of premature discontinuation. The site staff will not be aware of any 
treatment discontinuations  unless the participants inform  the site. These 
participants will be encouraged, like all other participants, to return for their SVR 
evaluation visit at week 24 and remain on the study through study completion. No 
adjustments to the timing of the SVR evaluation will be made for premature treatment  discontinuation.  Participants will be provided a number to  call or send a 
text message informing the site of the stop date.  
 
6.3 Instructions for Evaluations  
 
All clinical and laboratory information required by this protocol is to be present in the source documents. Sites  must refer to the Source Document Guidelines on the  DAIDS  
website for information about what must be included in the source document: 
https://www.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/documents/sourcedocappndx.pdf . 
 All stated evaluations are to be recorded on the eCRF unless otherwise specified. Refer to section 7.0 for information on the DAIDS AE Grading Table and AE reporting of AE 
requirements.

documentation is not recorded on the eCRF.  
 6.3.2  Documentation of HIV -1 Status  
 
Section 4.1. 6 specifies assay requirements for HIV -1 documentation. HIV- 1 
documentation is not recorded on the eCRF.  
 
6.3.3  Calculated FIBROSIS -4 (FIB -4) Score 
 
Calculated FIB -4 score is needed to determine cirrhosis status for all participants, 
as per the SOE , in order to evaluate other outcomes such as regression of liver 
disease.  
 This calculatio n requires the following data: Participant age (years), serum 
alanine and aspartate aminotransferase level (U/L), and platelet count (10
9/L). 
 
Please refer to the A5360 PSWP  for the website link t o calculate the FIB- 4 score . 
 6.3.4  Model for End -Stage Liver Disease (MELD) Score 
 
The MELD score measures the  mortality risk in participants  with end- stage liver 
disease. It is used as a disease severity index to help prioritize allocation of 
organs for transplant. In order to calculate the MELD score,  total bilirubin  (mg/dl), 
sodium  (mEg/L) , INR , and serum creatinine (mg/dl)  values are needed.  
 
Please refer to the A5360 PSWP  for the website link t o calculate the MELD 
score.  
 
6.3.5  Documentation of Cirrhosis Status
  
 
Participants with calculated FIB -4 score of <3.25 are considered to be non -
cirrhotic.  
Participants with calculated FIB -4 score ≥3.25 are considered to have cirrhosis 
and must have a calculated CTP score of ≤6 (CTP A ) to be considered a 
compensated cirrhotic. See section 6.3.6 .   
 
6.3.6 Calculated Child -Turcotte -Pugh (CTP) Score  
 
Calculated CTP score is needed only for participants who are considered cirrhotics as determined by the FIB -4 score (≥3.25) as per the SOE.  CTP score 
must be ≤6 corresponding to Class A to be included in the st udy.

Screening HIV- 1 RNA must be performed within 90 days prior to study entry by a 
laboratory that possesses a CLIA certification or equivalent.  
 
HCV RNA  
Screening HCV RNA by PCR m ust be obtained by any FDA- approved test for 
quantifying HCV RNA at any local laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its 
equivalent. If no historical documentation is  available, the s creening HCV RNA 
must be obtained within 35 days prior to study entry.  
 All other samples will be collected per SOE.  Only samples from participants who 
have achieved SVR will be collected at weeks 48 and 72 and tested for the 
presence of H CV RNA .  
 HCV RNA samples on study will be processed and shipped to the designated A5360 VSL for real -time quantitative HCV RNA analysis.  
 
6.3.14 Stored Plasma/ PBMCs /Serum  
 
Stored plasma, PBMCs, and serum will be collected at the indicated visits for future HCV/HIV studies and shipped according to the A5360 Laboratory  
Processing Chart (LPC).  Stored specimens will be used after study completion 
for HCV genotyping/sequencing t o assess re -infection versus relapse a nd 
estimate SVR by genotype.  
 Further, the NS5A and NS5B regions of HCV will be sequenced for the earliest 
sample where HCV RNA is detected post -SVR and the corresponding entry 
sample will also be sequenced. Sequence data will assist in discriminating between reinfection (entry and post -SVR sequences are not related) versus 
relapse (entry and post -SVR sequences are identical). Incidence of reinfection 
will be calculated following the completion of sequencing.   
 Those who do not achieve SVR (SVR non -responders) will have both baseline 
and SVR specimens tested for HCV RASs by sequencing the NS5A and NS5B regions.  
 Any specimens collected  during unplanned visits  will be stored.  See section

 6.3.15 Questionnaires  
 
Adherence Assessment  
Adherence will be captured at the week 4 remote contact (see section 6.3.22 ) 
and week 24/SVR evaluation visit (i.e. , week 22 or beyond). At both 
assessments, participants will be asked to estimate their adherence using Likert -
type ques tions (all, most, half, some, or none). At the SVR visit, participants will 
also be asked to indicate the percentage of study medication that they actually 
took on a visual analog scale. At the week 4  remote contact assessment and 
week 24/SVR evaluation visit, participants who report less than perfect adherence will be asked about barriers to adherence.  
 
Health Outcomes Questionnaire (EQ-5D) 
The EQ -5D is a validated instrument used to collect data abou t quality of life 
(http://www.euroqol.org) . The instrument asks questions and each has three 
possible responses (EQ5D- 3L version). The instrument asks respondents to 
comment on their degree of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
and anx iety/depression, and then ask participants to record their current health-
related quality of life state using a vertical visual analogue scale (0 -100 range) . 
The instrument has been translated into a variety of languages and is available as a paper form, a  computer -based form, a tablet/cell phone form, or as an 
interview .  
 Responses must be recorded on an eCRF from the entry visit and week 24 /SVR 
evaluation, and weeks 48 and 72 visits . In addition, responses must be recorded 
in the event of an unplanned study visit.  
 
Health Care Utilization  Questionnaire  
The health care utilization questionnaire solicits participant -reported health care 
utilization in the past 4 weeks including: 1) nights spent in a hospital bed, 2) visits to an emergency department, and 3) visits to a doctor’s office. This questionnaire 
will be administer ed during visits at entry, week  24/SVR evaluation, and weeks  
48, 72 , and any unplanned visits. Responses must be recorded on an eCRF.  
 
Substance Use Questionnaire 
The substance use questionnaire will be administered at entry, week 24/ SVR 
evaluation and weeks 48 and 72  visits.  The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance 
Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) survey that was developed for the WHO  
by an international group of researchers and clinicians as a technical tool to 
assist with early identification of substance use- related health risks and 
substance use disorders will be used. This tool has been validated globally and 
captures information on alcohol, smoking,  and injection and non- injection drug 
use.

6.3.1 6 HCV Therapy Dispensed/ First Dose Observed 
 The entire quantity of study -provided drug (84 tablets) will be dispensed at the 
entry visit ( week 0).  Study staff will observe the first dose taken by the participant  
before he/she leaves  the site and record this observation on an eCRF. Refer to 
section 5.0 for details on study product dispensation.  
 6.3.17 Adherence Education and Counseling 
 
Adherence education and counseling will be conducted for all participants prior to 
entry . Adherence education and counseling is not recorded on the eCRF.   
 See the A5360 MOPS for further details.  
 
6.3.18 Pregnancy Prevention Counseling 
 
Pregnancy  prevention counseling  will be conducted for all participants at 
screening and  entry.  Pregnancy prevention counseling is not recorded on the 
eCRF.  
 
6.3.19  Cirrhosis Counseling 
 
All compensated cirrhotics will be counseled on secondary prevention and long-
term surveillance of liver disease according to the SOE . Cirrhosis counseling is 
not recorded on the eCRF.  
 See the A5360 MOPS for further details.    
 6.3.20  HCV Risk -reduction Counseling  
 
HCV risk -reduction counseling will be administered to all participants, per the 
SOE. See the A5360 MOPS for further details.    
 6.3.21  Locator Information  
 
At study entry, all participants will be asked to list their  primary mode of contact 
(e.g., telephone, email, text, or social media) and their secondary mode of 
contact. The site will capture these options for mode of contact (but will not record any participant locator this information on any eCRF), and use them t o 
contact study participants without requiring them to come in to the clinic. Sites will also capture information on another person that the site can contact if the participant cannot be reached (e .g., spouse, friend, neighbor, etc.); information 
on the secondary contact will not be recorded on any eCRF.  
 
 53 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
6.3.22 Remote Contact with Participants Outside of Planned Clinic Visits  
 When contacting participants remotely, s ites will have the flexibility to make 
adjustments to the mode of contact utilized at their discretion and at the 
participant’s convenience – the only mode that will not be allowed is to schedule 
clinic visits  in place of the remote contact . Sites  will also be able to use different 
modes to contact different  participants. Additionally, how the participant was 
contacted  (i.e., mode of contact) will be collected  on the eCRF.  
 Data that will be captured from the participant during the week 4 remote contact 
is whether the participant is taking study medication ( i.e., adherence), in the prior 
4 weeks. All participants will receive an individually tailored message, based on their adherence, which will be read or written to them in order to promote and/or 
encourage adherence through the end of treatment. The message  will highlight 
the benefit of treatment for HCV and the importance of adherence and will be 
tailored to  each participant’s response as to how well he/she is  adhering to the 
HCV treatment regimen. Additionally, at both weeks 4 and 22, locator information 
will be updated (if anything has changed) and participants will be reminded to 
return for their SVR evaluation visit. Sites will be allowed to contact and collect 
participant’s responses on adherence and to update his/her locator information 
using any of the options listed above, namely phone call, text message, email, or 
social media (e .g., WhatsApp, Fac ebook Messenger, Twitter, etc.; f or a complete 
list, please refer to the MOPS). If the participant comes in for the week 24 visit 
prior to the completion of  the week 22 remote call, or if the participant has 
completed the discontinuation visit, then the week 22 remote call is not needed.  
 
The remote contact is not designed to assess concomitant medications or AEs. 
At the end of each remote contact,  participa nts will be reminded that the 
information that they shared will not be communicated to the study team and that 
if they have concerns about symptoms or study questions they should contact 
the site via the telephone number provided by the site. This information should 
be reported in a medical record then reviewed and entered into an eCRF at the 
week 24/SVR evaluation visit . 
 Since it is common for participants to lose mobile phones or change service 
providers in a 6 -month period, it is critical to ensure that locator information is 
kept up -to-date to ascertain SVR
 status.  Locator information will be maintained 
securely by sites and specific locator information will not be reco rded onto an 
eCRF.  However, t he parts  of the locator information that were updated and the 
mode of contact used to update this information will be recorded on an eCRF.  
 Participants will be provided with a telephone number to contact the study staff  if 
they are experiencing any side effects or have any safety concerns. If the study 
staff contacted determines that the issue cannot be resolved over the phone, an 
unplanned study visit will be scheduled, as described in section 6.2. 6. If 
participant calls but does not come in for an unplanned study visit, details related 
 54 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
to the call should be reported in the participant medical record and reviewed at week 24/SVR evaluation visit and entered into the eCRF.   
 
See the A5360 MOPS for further details, including a script to be used by site staff 
when contacting participants.  
 
7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS AND STUDY MONITORING  
 7.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
 An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), sympt om, or diagnosis that occurs in a study participant during the conduct of 
the study  REGARDLESS of the attribution (i .e., relationship of event to medical 
treatment/study product/device or procedure/intervention). This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition.  
 
7.2 Adverse Event Collection Requirements for This Protocol  
 Post-entry, a ll AEs must be recorded on the eCRFs if any of the following criteria have 
been met.  
• All grade ≥ 3 AEs  
• All AEs that led to a change in study treatment/intervention regardless of grade  
• All AEs meeting SAE definition or EAE reporting requirement  
 NOTE: SAEs or events meeting EAE reporting requirements should also be entered into the DAIDS Adverse Experience Reporting System (DAERS ), an internet -based reporting 
system.  
NOTE: At week 24/SVR evaluation visit, information on any AEs participants may have 
experienced during the prior 24 weeks ( particularly while on study medication)  will be 
collected unless this information was already obtained during an unplanned study visit . 
 
All AEs that are reported must have their severity graded. To grade AEs, sites must refer 
to the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse 
Events (DAIDS AE Grading Table), corrected Version 2.1, July 2017, which can be 
found on the DAIDS RSC website at http://rsc.tech -res.com/c linical- research-
sites/safety -reporting/daids -grading -tables .

  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
• After the protocol -defined AE reporting period, unless otherwise noted, only 
suspected, unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs), as defined in 
Version 2.0 of the EAE Manual, will be reported to DAIDS if the study staff 
become aware of the events on a passive basis (from publicly available information).  
 7.4 Study Monitoring 
 
The Protocol Core Team will monitor the conduct and safety of the study via regular summaries of screening , accrual, data delinquency, study and study treatment 
discontinuation, data  and sample completeness with attention to evaluation and time of 
SVR evaluation, and SAEs .  
 The DAIDS clinical representative will review and assess EAE reports for potential 
impact on the study participant safety and protocol conduc t as per DAIDS policies, 
guidance documents, and SOPs as applicable. Additionally, the DAIDS clinical 
representative will receive aggregated SAE summaries prepared quarterly by the SDAC , 
as part of the core team monitoring referenced above.  
The study will  undergo interim review at least annually  by an ACTG -appointed St udy 
Monitoring Committee (SMC) . The first interim review will occur no more than one year  
after the enrollment of the first study participant  or 6 months after 25% of the study 
sample (100 participants) have completed 12 weeks on study, whichever occurs earlier . 
An interim review may also be convened if a concern is identified by the DAIDS clinical representative, the study chairs, or study statistician in consultation with the team. See 
Secti on 10 for statistical and other considerations related to interim monitoring.  
Detailed plans for study monitoring will be outlined in a Study Monitoring Plan developed 
by the Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC) prior to enrollment of the first 
participant.  
 
Items for SMC  interim review include the following:  screening and accrual, baseline 
characteristics of study sample, data (and specimen)  completeness, premature study 
treatment and study discontinuation, unplanned study visits , safety ( serious and other 
adverse events), evaluabilit y for primary efficacy outcome, and for interim reviews 
including efficacy outcome: SVR outcome estimation.  
 
8.0 CLINICAL MANAGEMENT  ISSUES 
 8.1 Toxicity  
 
Criteria for participant management, dose interruptions, dose adjustments and 
discontinuation, or changes in treatment will be described only for toxicities attributable to study drugs  (SOF/VEL) . The grading system for drug toxicities is located in the DAIDS 
AE Grading Table (see section 7.2).   
 
NOTE:  The team must be notified via e- mail within 72 hours regarding toxicities that 
result in a change in study regimen ( actg.corea5360@fstrf.org).  
 57 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
It is possible that some participants will experience transient or prolonged AEs during the study . However,  it is important to note that , in this trial, there are no scheduled on-
treatment visits and hence, participant s must  call the site and schedule  unplanned study 
visits in order  for AEs to be identified. AE-related unplanned study visits  will be handle d 
as listed below. However, at week 24, information on any AEs participants may have 
experienced during the prior 24 weeks, particularly while on study medication, will be collected.  
 
8.2 Management of Side Effects of SOF/VEL  
 
There are no signature abnormalities associated with SOF/VEL. If an SAE occurs, the 
site investigator has the option to discontinue  study treatment. However, prior to the 
discontinuation of study drugs, the study core team should be contacted by email (actg.corea5360@fstrf.org ).  
 
Participants  who meet any of the following laboratory criteria should stop treatment with 
SOF/VEL:  
• Confirmed elevation of ALT and/or AST >5 x entry values measured while on study 
treatment measured at unplanned study visits.  
• Confirmed direct  bilirubin 3 x ULN and >2.0 mg/dL  
• Any Grade 3 or greater rash associated with constitutional symptoms assessed as related to treatment with SOF/VEL.  
• Any Grade 4 event assessed as related to treatment with SOF/VEL 
 
Dose modification of SOF/VEL will not be allowed in the s tudy. If SOF/VEL is 
discontinued for toxicity reasons, it should not be restarted.  
 
NOTE: Grades 1 and 2 AEs associated with SOF/VEL require no change in study 
treatment.  
 
8.3 Pregnancy   
 
Pregnancy will result in immediate discontinuation of the study medication  and initiation 
of counseling regarding the lack of information on safety of SOF/VEL in pregnancy.  
Participants who become pregnant  while on study should contact the site to schedule an 
unplanned study visit (only up to week 2 2) and will be followed on study/off -treatment 
until study completion. A visit following the end of pregnancy will be conducted for 
evidence of AEs in the participant, and an outcome eCRF will be completed. Male 
participants whose partners become pregnant will continue treatment as outlined in the SOE.  
 If a female participant has completed the study or chooses to discontinue from the study before the end of the pregnancy, site staff should request permission to contact her 
regarding pregnancy outcomes at the end of pregnancy. If the information is obtained, 
pregnancy outcomes will be submitted on an eCRF at the end of the pregnancy.

9.0 CRITERIA FOR  DISCONTINUATION  
 9.1 Permanent  and Premature  Treatment Discontinuation 
 
• Drug -related toxicity (see section 8.1 Toxicity) . 
• Requirement for prohibited concomitant medications (see section 5.4). 
• Pregnancy  in a female participant . 
• Breastfeeding.  
• Completion of  treatment as defined in the  protocol.

NOTE: It is important to determine whether the treatment discontinuation is 
primarily due to an AE, lack of efficacy, or other reason.  
• Clinical reasons believed life threatening by the physician, even if not addressed in the toxicity section of the protocol . 
 
9.2 Premature Study Discontinuation 
 
• Request by the participant  to withdraw . 
• Request of the primary care provider if s/he thinks the study is no longer in the best interest of the participant . 
• Participant  judged by the investigator to be at significant risk of failing to comply with 
the provisions of the protocol so as to cause harm to self or seriously interfere with 
the validity of the study results . 
• At the discretion of the IRB/Ethics Committee, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , 
NIAID, Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP),  other government agenc ies 
as part of their duti es, investigator, or industry  supporter.  
 
10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
10.1 General Design Issues  
 
This is a single -arm study of 400 participants, to evaluate the feasibility, safety , and 
efficacy of a  MINMON  strategy  of delivering interferon and RBV-free, pan- genotypic 
DAA therapy to qualifying persons with active HCV . The outcomes of this study may be 
used to inform the feasibility and utility of a future randomized controlled trial including a 
study arm with the MINMON strategy . Because this study includes only one arm, there is 
no blinding of any study intervention component.

The primary completion date (PCD) for each participant will be timed to be the date when the SVR evaluation takes place. As defined below, SVR evaluation will take place at least 22 weeks following study entry, but may take place any time up to 76 weeks 
following study entry (i .e., the final study visit evaluation).  
Following SVR evaluation, participants will enter Step 2 for post -SVR evaluation follow -
up for secondary  and exploratory  objectives.  
 
10.2 Outcome Measures  
 
10.2.1  Primary Outcome Measures  
 
10.2.1.1  Efficacy: Sustained virologic response defined as <LLOQ of HCV RNA

10.3 Registration and Stratification 
 
There is no randomization to this single- arm study. Eligible participants will enroll to Step 
1 and then have the following required evaluations as described in section 6. The study 
will use stratification factors to limit enrollment to Step 1 by certain subgroups. These 
stratification factors include geographic location (limited to no more than 132 participants 
being enrolled from US- based clinic sites), HIV -1 infection (limited to no more than 200 
participants being HIV -1 positive within t he overall study sample) and cirrhosis status 
(limited to no more than 80 participants within the overall study sample having 
compensated cirrhosis).  There are no additional restrictions regarding participants who 
are both HIV -co infected and have compensa ted cirrhosis and/or geographic distribution 
of those participants. Step 2 enrollment occurs following SVR evaluation and is for post 
SVR evaluation follow -up for selected secondary and exploratory objectives. 
 
10.4 Sample Size and Accrual  
 
The sample siz e for this single- arm study is 400 participants.  
 
This sample size was chosen for benchmark properties listed below regarding the use of 
efficacy data from this study to informing the utility and feasibility of future studies of the MINMON approach, and the precision (based on CI width) about SVR efficacy outcome 
estimates.  
 
Table 10.4-1
 below describes SVR benchmarks and their properties.  
 The high benchmark is defined as when the lower confidence limit of the 2 -sided 95% CI 
about the SVR estimate is strictly greater than 96%. Observing 392 or more SVR
 
responders out of 400 participants (i.e. , ≥98% SVR responders) would meet this 
benchmark. Under a true SVR rate of 97%, there is only a small probability (0.15) of 
observing this benchmark with the study sample size of 400. However, as the true SVR 
rate becomes higher, the probability of observing this benchmark also increases (while 
holding the sample size at 400 participants). For instance, if the true SVR rate were 
98.5%, then there is 0.85 probability of observing this high benchmark in the proposed 
study sample size of 400.  If a high benchmark were observed, then a future RCT may 
not be needed, as the high benchmark implies that the SVR for the MINMON strategy exceeds 96%.  
 
 61 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
The low benchmark is defined as when the upper confidence limit of the 2- sided 95% CI 
about the SVR estimate is strictly less than 95%. Observing 371 or fewer SVR 
responders out of 400 participants (i.e. , ≤92.8 % SVR responders) would meet this 
benchmark. Properties of possible scenarios are given in Table 10.4-1. 
 
If neither the high nor low benchmark is met, a future RCT of the MINMON approach 
versus SOC  may be desired, and efficacy estimates from this study could be used to 
inform the design and sample size of that study.  
The low and high SVR benchmarks described above and in Table 10.4 -1 below were 
chosen to represent what is currently thought to be reasonable SVR rates based on 
studies presented and published, including clinical trials, as well as studies reporting use 
of this DAA regimen outside the context of a clinical trial.  
 
Properties of this study’s sample size regarding probability of not observing either 
benchmark  
Table 10.4-2 below summarizes the various probabilities that neither of the benchmarks 
(HIGH or LOW, as described above), are observed under a range of various true rates of 
SVR.

The sample size calculation has not been adjusted for losses to study follow -up as the 
definition of the primary efficacy outcome includes imputing missing evaluations as SVR non-responders. The impact of missingness contributing to the (lowering of the) S VR 
response rate will be addressed by both enumerating what led to non -SVR responder 
classification such as the following: missing HCV RNA values for SVR evaluation, HCV 
 63 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
RNA values observed >the assay LLOQ, early stopping of study treatment (e.g. , for 
intolerability, etc.). 
 
Assuming uniform accrual of 25 participants per month, total accrual to the study would 
be completed in 16 months. If initial accrual is assumed to be slower, at rates of 10 
participants per month for the first 6 months, 15 participants  per month for the next 6 
months, and 20 participants per month for the remaining time, the total accrual time 
would be about 24 months.  
 10.5 Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
10.5.1  Interim Monitoring Guidelines  
 
This study will be formally monitored at least annually by an ACTG -appointed 
SMC (via the standing committee for the Hepatitis TSG). The first interim review 
will occur no more than one year after the enrollment of the first study participant 
or 6 months after 25% of the study sample (100 participants)  have completed 12 
weeks on study, whichever occurs earlier.  
 A planned interim review for efficacy will be performed when SVR outcomes are 
available for approximately 100 participants, but could occur earlier (under case of a faster than anticipated accrual rate). The team wishes that an interim look at 
efficacy occur while the study is still accruing, so that if SVR rate is unacceptably low (i .e., futility), that there is still an opportunity to intervene before accrual to the 
study is completed.   
 For instance, assuming uniform accrual of 25 participants per month and SVR 
evaluation happening 24 weeks following study entry, the planned interim review for efficacy would occur around month 12 since study accrual commenced, with approximately 300 participants accrued, 100 participants with SVR outcome 
available, and 100 participants remaining to be accrued. Assuming the slower but 
increasing accrual rate over time  and same timing of SVR evaluation, the 
planned interim review for efficacy would occur approximately 17 months following study opening, with approximately 265 participants accrued, 105 participants with SVR outcome, and 135 participants remaining to be accrued.  
 Consideration would be given to closer monitoring or stopping the study if there 
is early and strong evidence to exclude the SVR rate from being 95% or higher 
(i.e., upper confidence bound on a 1- sided 99.9% CI is lower than 95%). With 
100 participants, this boundary would be met if the observed SVR rate were 86% or lower (which corresponds to 14 or more SVR non- responders out of 100). For 
additional information, SVR estimates will be provided separately for subgroups 
defined by geographical location stratification factor (ie , US versus non- US). 
 However, if the SMC sees early benefit of the MINMON intervention, the team 
intends the study to proceed with full accrual and follow -up in order to confirm 
early evidence, and gain precision on the efficacy outcome estimate and other 
 64 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
outcomes. At interim reviews, SVR will be calculated only among those with potential to contribute to SVR (by having at least 22 weeks elapsed since study entry). Imputation of missing SVR evaluation as non- SVR response will only 
occur for participants for whom more than 76 weeks since study enrollment has elapsed. In other words, early study discontinuations prior to week 22 will not be 
counted in SVR estimation at interim review, as these could bias the estimation 
of SVR towards futility. Instead, these early study discontinuations prior to week 22 (before available for SVR evaluation), and others missing SVR evaluation, will 
contribute to the interim monitoring trigger below.  
 If the analysis sample for the initial planned review for efficacy as outlined above 
includes fewer than 40% participants from non -US clinical rese arch sites, then a 
second planned review of efficacy will be triggered when SVR outcomes are available on approximately 230 participants (with the upper limit of US participants of 132, this estimates at least 40% non- US representation in the 
second effica cy look interim analysis sample). The same analysis plan and 
monitoring bounds as defined in the first look above would be applied to this 
second look at SVR.  
 
An unplanned interim review will be triggered if, at any time, more than 20 
persons are not evaluable for the SVR outcome before study discontinuation or 
76 weeks following study enrollment. Another trigger for an unplanned interim 
review is if, at any time, the number of participants experiencing an SAE exceeds 
5% of the interim analysis dataset , and the absolute number of participants with 
SAEs at least 10 (as 5% was the observed upper bound of the 95% CI on 
number of participants with any SAE from the ASTRAL- 5 trial).   
 Any/all SMC reviews will include administrative/ trial conduct data as well as  
safety data according to the safety -related outcomes enumerated above.  
 The following routine monitoring reports are distributed to core team and are 
detailed in the study monitoring plan (SMP): screening, accrual, data 
delinquency, study status, data and  sample completeness, with attention to 
evaluation and timing of SVR outcome. The routine safety monitoring report is 
distributed to the DAIDS Clinical Representative and a subset of the core team 
(to include the study chairs) every 3 months.  
 Further details about monitoring of this study are available in the SMP.  
 
10.6 Analyses  
 
Due to US federally mandated reporting of outcomes to clinicaltrials.gov, the timing of initiating 
analyses for those outcomes, are likely to occur prior to study follow -up being completed. 
Therefore, there will be separate primary and secondary statistical analyses reports to cover all the analyses listed below.  
 
 65 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
10.6.1  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
 
The primary efficacy outcome (SVR) will be estimated with a point -wise estimate 
as well as a 95%, two- sided CI. The confidence bound will be calculated with 
binomial distribution according to the method of Wilson (Score based interval). 
The impact of missingness contributing to the (lowering of the) SVR  response 
rate will be  addressed by providing the various reasons for non -SVR (e .g., 
discontinued treatment early due to various reasons including intolerability, HCV RNA > LLOQ, missing evaluation for SVR (and reasons as known), and the 
number of participants meeting each reas on for non -SVR.  
 
10.6.2  Primary Safety Analysis  
 
The primary safety outcome of SAEs will be enumerated, summarized and described for all qualifying outcomes. The number and relative frequency of 
participants experiencing one or more SAEs will also be summarized, and a CI 
about the probability of experiencing a SAE will be calculated (using CI methods 
as described above).   
 
10.6.3  Secondary Outcomes Analysis  
 
Premature discontinuation of study treatment will be defined from participant self -
report either via remote contact prior to SVR evaluation, or at an unplanned visit or by retrospective recall at the week 24 or SVR evaluation visit (whichever occurs first). Those participants missing information from all  these mechanisms 
will be assumed to have prematurely discontinued. The proportion of premature study treatment discontinuation will be estimated and a CI calculated to 
summarize the range of plausible values using methods parallel to other 
dichotomous outcomes described above.  
 
Non-serious AEs will be summarized by the Medical Dictionary of Regulatory 
Affairs (M eDDRA) System Organ Class by the reporting types described in 
section 7.2.  
 
Those who do not achieve SVR with an observed HCV RNA >LLOQ will have 
both baseline and SVR specimens tested for HCV RASs. Participants in this sub-
set with HCV RASs present in their SVR specimen that were not present in their 
baseline specimen will be enumerated along with the relative frequencies of new 
RASs. A description of the observed RASs will also be provided.   
 Among SVR responders, HCV RNA post SVR follow -up (i.e., Step 2) will be used 
to evaluate for the HCV reinfection outcome. Detectable HCV RNA, with and 
HCV sequence distinct from the baseline sequence will qualify for the outcome of 
HCV reinfection. The absolute number (and relative frequency) of participants 
meeting this outcome will be summarized along with a 95% CI using methods as 
described for other dichotomous study outcomes.  
 
 66 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
Among SVR  responders, HCV disease regression will be defined by the absolute 
change between baseline FIB -4 value and the final study  FIB-4 value. The 
distribution of these absolute changes will also be described using key 
percentiles.  
 
Further details are outlined in the study’s Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
 
11.0 PHARMACOLOGY PLAN  
 Not applicable.   
 
12.0  COST -BENEFIT ANALYSIS PLAN  
 
The cost -benefit analysis will employ the resource utilization data collected at 
planned/unplanned study visits until the SVR is assessed (week 24/SVR evaluation visit) 
as well as SVR data and utilization data to develop an estimate of cost/SVR attained. 
 
12.1  Objective  
 
12.1.1  To determine the cost/SVR attained using the MINMON protocol  
 
12.2 Primary Outcome  
 
12.2.1  Cost/SVR  attained - both globally and stratified by country - calculated using 
country -specific costs and expressed in US$ 2017.  
 12.3 General Approach to Costing 
 
The cost/SVR attained will be assessed from two perspectives . 
 
12.3.1  The perspective of the clinic/prog ram/site treating the participant  (program 
perspective). These costs include the cost of staff, laboratory monitoring, and 
medications involved in delivering HCV treatment to a participant . These costs 
begin at week 0 and continue through the week 24/ SVR evaluation. The 
program cost perspective is helpful to those who administer a clinic or treatment 
program who want to understand how MINMON would impact their program budget.  
 
There are two cost components from the program perspective: 
 1. Cost of HCV medications  
2. Cost of planned and unplanned study visit evaluations between week 0 and 
the week 24/ SVR evaluation visit 
 
12.3.2  The healthcare sector perspective—t he health sector perspective is broader 
than the program perspective. It includes the costs of staff, laboratory 
monitoring and medications between weeks 0 and 24, the cost of healthcare 
 67 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
utilization outside of the study site between weeks 0 and 24, and any changes  
in utilization that may occur in the future as the result of the participant attaining 
SVR.  
 
There are four cost components from the healthcare sector perspective: 
 1. Cost of HCV medications  
2. Cost of planned and unplanned study visit evaluations  between week 0 and 
the week 24/ SVR evaluation visit 
3. Cost of healthcare utilization outside of study sites  between week 0 and the 
week 24/ SVR evaluation visit 
4. Cost saving (or additional cost) that may accrue because a person attains 
SVR and subsequently uses fewer (or more) healthcare resources. This 
cost saving (cost)  is defined as the DIFFERENCE in healthcare  utilization 
per month measured at the week 48 visit comparted to the week 0 visit. The 
healthcare utilization questionnaire measures utilization over a 4- week 
recall period. This is defined as healthcare utilization per month. The 
difference in healthcare  utilization per month between the week 48 
assessment and the week 0 assessment is the monthly savings (or cost) 
attributable to attaining SVR. It will be  assumed that the monthly savings 
(cost) applies to every month between week 24 and week 72.  
 
In addition, because this estimate of cost savings is uncertain, sensitivity 
analyses  will be used to explore different estimates of saving attained including: 
1) difference in utilization measured at the week 72 visit and the week 0 visit, 2) 
difference in utiliz ation measured at week 72 and week 48 visits. In both of 
these sensitivity analyses, it will be  assumed that the monthly savings (or cost) 
we estimate applies to every month between weeks 24 and 72.  
 
Measures of utilization will be translated  to cost (expr essed in currency rather 
than units of resources consumed) using WHO CHOICE country -specific unit 
costs ( http://www.who.int/choice/cost- effectiveness/inputs/health_service/en/ ). 
 
It will be  assumed that all resource utilization between weeks 0 and 24 is 
related to HCV medications. As a result, the cost estimate will tend to be biased 
toward a higher cost/SVR attained.  
 
The primary analysis will be conducted in an intention to treat framework, 
whereby participants who are LTFU  and do not return for the week 24/SVR 
evaluation visit are assumed to be treatment failures and not counted as “SVR” 
in the cost/SVR attained calculation. This approach will also tend to bias results 
to a higher cost/SVR attained. A sensitivity analysis will explore cost/SVR when 
it is assumed that the rate of SVR among those lost to follow -up at week 24 is 
similar to the SVR rate among those with week 24 confirmation of cure.

12.4  Resource Utilization Data Collection 
 
12.4.1  Cost of HCV M edications  
 
We will price HCV therapy by country based on the negotiated price with 
ministries of health. In the U.S., there is no single cost of HCV therapy. For U.S. 
sites, we will price SOF/VEL using the federal supply schedule. Because the cost of therapy is dynamic and changes by setting and time, we will use 
sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of drug prices on the cost -benefit of 
treatment .  
 
12.4.2  Cost of P lanned and Unplanned Study V isits  
 
We will consider two components of the cost of a study visit: a) cost of provider time, and b) cost of labs and assessments. Cost of the healthcare visits 
(Doctor/physician and staff time) —we will use WHO CHOICE estimates of 
outpatient care delivery costs by country. We will include the week 0 visit (not 
the screening visit as it is a study procedure with no real -world analogue) and 
the visit for week 24/SVR evaluation. In addition, we will include any unplanned 
visits between week 0 and the week 24/SVR evaluation. 
 
We will cost laboratory tests using the national fee  schedule for public sector 
healthcare payers in each country. For example, we will use the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reimbursement schedule for laboratory test costs in the U.S. and the National Health Laboratory Service schedule for  
sites in South Africa.  
 
12.4.3  Cost of Healthcare U tilization  
 
To collect healthcare utilization data a questionnaire similar to the ACTG Instrument named “ACTG A5265 Resource Utilization Interview” will be used 
following minor adaptation for A5360.  
 Staff will administer this instrument at the entry visit, the week 24 /SVR 
evaluation visit, at the weeks 48 and 72 planned study visits, and at any 
unplanned study visit.  
 
To translate utilization to cost, we will use WHO CHOICE estimates of the cost of health care delivery (clinic visits, hospital nights, casualty ward visits) by

12.6  Estimation of Cost/SVR  Outcome 
 
12.6.1  Program perspective. We will estimate the mean cost per participant including:  
• Cost of medications  
• Cost of all planned and unplanned study visits between weeks 0 and 24/SVR evaluation including staff time and laboratory tests  
 
12.6.2  Healthcare sector perspective 
• Cost of medications  
• Cost of all planned and unplanned study visits between week s 0 and 
24/SVR evaluation including staff time and laboratory tests  
• Cost of healthcare utilization between week s 0 and 24/ SVR evaluation 
• The DIFFERENCE in  healthcare utilization as measured at weeks  0 and 48 
 
Cost/SVR attained in each country  will be calculated, as well as for the entire study 
population. Cost/SVR both in local currency and in international dollars  will be stated . 
The cost/participant who does NOT attain SVR will also be estimated. Sensitivity 
analyses will demonstrate the impact of HCV therapy costs on the cost -benefit of 
MINMON.  
 
In addition, although there is no control arm to which we can compare the cost/SVR  
attained in MINMON, we will estimate the cost/SVR attained for the standard of care 
treatment protocol based on the cost of laboratory tests and medications and the 
planned schedule of events for a standard of care treatment course.  
 
13.0 DATA COLLECTION AND M ONITORING  
 13.1 Records to Be Kept  
 
eCRFs  will be made available to sites for data entry. Participants must not be identified 
by name on any data submitted to the DMC. Participants will be identified by the patient 
identification number (PID) and study identification number (SID) provided by the ACTG 
DMC upon registration . 
 
13.2 Role of Data Manageme nt 
 
13.2.1 Instructions concerning entering  study data on eCRFs will be provided by the 
ACTG DMC . Each CRS  is responsible for keying the dat a in a timely fashion. 
 
13.2.2 It is the responsibility of the ACTG DMC  to assure the quality of computerized

INTRODUCTION   
 
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have been infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV, a virus that affects the liver), and have not been treated before for HCV. 
You may also be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the virus that causes AIDS). 
You may have compensated liver cirrhosis, which means that the liver is damaged, but is still working. This study is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. The doctor in charge of 
this study at this site is: (insert name of Principal Investigator). Before you decide if you want to 
be a part of this study, we want you to know about the study.  
 This is a consent form. It gives you information about this study. The study staff will talk with you about this information. You are free to ask questions about this study at any time. If you agree to 
take part in this study, you will be asked to sign this consent form. You will get a copy to keep.  
 
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 
Currently, people who are infected with HCV are often closely monitored by medical staff. This 
requires patients to come to the clinic at least five times for visits, medication refills, and blood 
tests over a 12- week course of treatment. These guidelines are based on older HCV 
medications that had more side effects and were less successful at curing HCV than the 
medications used in this study. New HCV medications can cure 95 out of 100 infected persons 
who receive treatment. The medication that is provided in this study is approved by the US FDA 
for use in persons infected with HCV and coinfected with HCV/HIV. In large clinical trials, the side effects reported by study participants were comparable to a placebo (no medicine).   
  This study is being done to see if a minimal monitoring approach is effective and safe when 
providing HCV treatment. The minimal monitoring approach will require fewer study visits and 
lab tests with no medication refills. This study is trying to see whether taking an HCV treatment 
with fewer clinic visits and laboratory tests can cure just as many people as the standard 
approach that uses more visits and laboratory tests. We will compare the results of this study 
with what we have observed in other studies using a standard approach.

People are considered cured of HCV if the HCV virus cannot be detected in the blood 12 weeks after they have completed HCV treatment. This is called a sustained virologic response (SVR).  
 
This study will measure the amount of HCV virus in your blood at entry, week 24, week 48 , and 
week  72. The study staff will share these results with you. If the HCV virus is detectable in your 
blood at week 24 or after, the study staff will let you know, and help you find a health care 
provider who can discuss your futur e treatment options. You can become re- infected with HCV 
after you are cured. The study staff will discuss with you how to remain HCV free after your 
treatment is completed.  
 The study will also examine the convenience to you and the cost to cure a person of HCV using 
this minimal approach.  
  HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL BE IN THIS STUDY?  
 About 400 people (men and women age 18 years and older) will take part in this study.  
  WHERE IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 This study will take place across the world and will include participants from the US and non -US 
sites. 
  
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THIS STUDY?  
 You will be in this study for up to 72 weeks.  
 
 
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO IF I AM IN THIS STUDY? 
 
If you decide to join this study and meet the study requirements after the screening visit, you will 
be enrolled into the study, unless enrollment has been closed to the subgroup(s) as described 
below.   
 Individuals with HIV infection and/or have compensated cirrhosis (liver is damaged but it is still 
working) are also eligible for the study. Enrollment, however, of HIV- infected individuals or those 
with compensated cirrhosis will be limited in the study (i.e. , only a certain number of persons will 
be included in the HIV -infected subgroup and compensated cirrhosis subgroup). The  study staff 
will let you know if this limit has been reached for either subgroup, and what this means for you.  
 At the entry visit, you will be given your study medication for all 3 months to take home.  You will 
need to store the medication in a safe place at room temperature (below 30°C [86ºF]) and take 
one tablet a day for the 3 -month period.

*After a person has successfully completed treatment for HCV, there is a period when HCV viral load in the blood is so low that even the most sensitive test cannot detect the virus. If this period of “undetectability ” lasts for 12 weeks  in a row  after the end of treatment, it is called SVR 
(sustained virologic response) . 
 
Everyone who enters the study will take a fixed -dose combination of sofosbuvir /velpatasvir 
(SOF/VEL) , which will be provided by the study. Anti -HIV drugs will not be provided by the 
study.  
 
While you are in this study, you will need to be seen in the clinic about 5 times. The longest visit, 
which will be your enrollment visit, could take up to 2 hours. Study staff will tell you about how 
long each visit will be. You may need to come to the clinic more often if you have side effects.  
More information about the study tests is given below. During the study, you will get the results 
from any routine tests that are done during the study and relevant to your care when they are 
available.  
 
If you do not enroll into the study  
If you decide not to take part in this study or if you do not qualify to take part in this study, we will still use s ome of your information. As part of the screening visit, some demographic (for 
example, age, sex, gender, race), clinical (for example, disease condition, diagnosis), and 
laboratory (for example, CD4+ T -cell count, HCV and HIV viral load) information is being 
collected from you so that ACTG researchers may see if there are patterns or common reasons why people do not join a study.  
 
Required Blood Tests  
Your blood will be drawn from a vein in your arm and used to measure your HCV viral load (the 
amount  of HC V virus in your blood), to measure levels of certain hormones (chemical 
messengers in your blood), to see if the hepatitis B virus (HBV; another virus that affects your liver) is in your body, and for routine safety tests and metabolic tests (to test how your body uses the food that you eat). If you are a woman able to become pregnant, you will have a 
pregnancy test at the screening and entry visits  and at later study visits if you think you might be 
pregnant . If you are infected with HIV, you will have blood drawn to measure your HIV viral load 
(the amount  of HIV viru s in your blood) and your CD4+  cell counts (these are cells in your blood 
that fight infection). You will be told the results of these tests when they become available.  
 Some of your blood will also be stored (with no information that will identify you) and used for 
HCV genotyping (a test to see the genetic makeup of the HCV virus) and sequencing (a test to 
check for the pattern/code of the genetic makeup of the HCV virus)  for this study. HCV 
genotyping and sequencing are used to see which genotype of HCV you are infected with.  
Since these stored samples will be tested in the future, the results will not be available to you.  
 
Blood will also be collected and stored for future testing at the end of the study.  Some of y our 
blood samples may be shipped and/or stored outside of the country from which they are 
collected.

Genetic (the message in your DNA) testing 
If you agree, your blood will be drawn and used to examine different genes (pieces of your DNA). Results of testing done on these samples may not be given to you because they will be 
done in the future.  If you do not agree to have genetic testing done, then the amount of blood 
drawn for future testing will be less (up to 20  mL less).  
 Please initial below if you agree to have any of your blood used for ACTG -approved future 
unspecified genetic testing. You may change your mind at any time and your samples w ill be 
destroyed.  
________ YES                     ________ NO  
 
Optional Tests  
If you agree, any blood left over after all required study testing is done may be stored (with no 
information that will identify you) and used for future ACTG- approved research. These blood 
samples may be stored for an unknown period of time. Results of testing done on these 
samples may not be given to you because they will be done in the future.  
 
Please initial below if you agree to have any of your leftover blood used for futu re ACTG -
approved research. You may change your mind at any time and reasonable efforts will be made to destroy your samples, though this may not always be possible.

II.  Description of Study Visits  
 
Screening 
After you have read and signed the consent form, you will be asked questions about your health, medical history, and medication history. You will have a complete physical 
exam to check your vitals (temperature, pulse, respiration rate, and blood pressure) and 
several tests, including blood tests, to make sure that you qualify to join the study. You 
will have your height and weight recorded.  
 
Up to 42 mL of blood will be drawn during this visit. You will have blood drawn for HCV 
RNA testing. Some of the blood taken will be shipped to a testing lab and some of the 
blood will be stored for future testing. Your  HCV infection and how long you have been 
infected will be confirmed. Your  HIV infection and cirrhosis status will also be evaluated.  
 If you are a woman able to become pregnant, you will have a blood draw or urine 
collected for pregnancy testing. You may not continue with the screening process if your 
pregnancy test is positive. If you are able to become pregnant or to impregnate a 
partner, y ou will receive pregnancy prevention counseling.  
 
Entry  
If all of the results from your screening tests show that you are eligible, you will be enrolled in the study. You will be asked about your health and the medications you are 
taking. You will also have a brief physical exam  to check your vitals (temperature, pulse, 
respiration rate, and blood pressure) . You will have your weight recorded.   
 Up to  51 mL of blood will be drawn during this visit. You will also have additional 
samples collected and stored for later testing. If you are a woman able to become 
pregnant, you will be asked to provide a blood or urine sample for pregnancy testing. 
You may not enroll in the study if your pregnancy test result is positive.  
 
If available at the site, liver elastography (scan of your liver) will be performed. This is 
described below in more detail. If you had a liver elastography done as part of standard 
care, this measurement will be recorded but it is not required for enrollment into the 
study.   
 
You will be asked for your primary preferred contact information as well as a second 
contact (spouse, friend, neighbor, etc.) in order for the study staff to reach you 
throughout the study. This is known as locator information. If you are not able to be 
reached through the primary contact information, then the study staff will try to reach you through the second contact you provide.  
 
At this visit, you will be given your study drugs. The study staff will give you enough 
study drugs to last 12 weeks (3 months). Study staff will watch you take y our first dose 
before leaving the site. You can take the study medication (SOF/VEL) with or without food. You will receive adherence education and counseling on the study drug, as 
described below. You will be given instructions on how to take the study medication and what to do if you forget to take it. You will also receive a flier with information on two

types of other medications (proton pump inhibitors and H2 inhibitors  [e.g., heartburn 
medication] ) that you should not take while taking study medication. [ Sites: Please 
include local names of PPIs and H2 inhibitors  on a flyer to give to participants at entry . 
Pictures should also be included on the flyer .] 
 
You will be asked to complete questionnaires that asks how you are doing and feeling, if 
you went to the hospital within the past 4 weeks, and if you use any  substances such as 
alcohol, cigarettes , and other drugs . If you have compensated cirrhosis, you will also 
receive counseling for your cirrhosis, as described below . If you are able to become 
pregnant or to impregnate a partner, you will receive pregnancy prevention counseling. You will also receive HCV risk -reduction counseling and adherence counseling, as 
described below .  
 
Post-entry visits  
Since you will be given enough study drugs to last you for 12 weeks of the treatment period, you will not need to come back to the clinic until week 24 (3 months later).  Study 
staff will contact you by the preferred contact  at weeks  4 and 22  to update your contact 
(locator) information and at week 4, to collect information about whether you are taking 
your study medication. If study staff are unable to reach you after two tries, they will try 
to reach you via your second contact. While you are taking the study drug, if you are not 
feeling well or have any questions about the study medication, you should contact the 
study site directly at ( Site to insert site contact information: Name - Number -). 
 
All participants will be seen post -treatment at week  24. If you miss the week 24 visit, you 
may come back to the site to have your SVR status checked any time after week 24, up 
until week 72. Following your SVR status check, you will be followed through week 72 . 
You will need to make two more visits  to the site -- one at week 48 and one at week 72, 
which is Part 2 of the study. These visits will last about 1 -1½ hours each.  
 
At the week 4 remote contact,  you will be asked how you are doing with taking your 
study medication.  At the week 24/SVR evaluation visit, you will be asked how you did 
with taking your study medication.   
 At weeks 24, 48, and 72, you will have blood samples collected for routine safety tests 
and for a few required blood tests (HCV RNA). Up to 76 mL of blood will be drawn during 
each of these visits . You will also have additional samples collected and stored for later 
testing. You will be asked about your health and any changes in your medicines since 
your last visit. You will have your weight reco rded. You will be asked to complet e 
questionnaires that asks how you are doing and feeling,  if you went to the hospital within 
the past 4 weeks, and if you use any substances such as alcohol, cigarettes,  and other 
drugs . 
 
Based on other tests done, the study staff will calculate different scores that will measure 
liver and kidney function and cirrhosis status. If you have compensated cirrhosis, you will 
also receive counseling for your cirrhosis, as described below.

WHY WOULD THE DOCTOR TAKE ME  OFF THIS STUDY EARLY?  
 The study doctor may need to take you off the study early without your permission if:  
 
• The study is cancelled.  
• Your doctor thinks the study is no longer in your best interest.  
• The site investigator thinks that you are at significant  risk of failing to comply with the 
requirements of the protocol.  
 
The study doctor may also need to take you off the study drugs without your permission if:  
 • You become pregnant.  
• You are breastfeeding.  
• Continuing the study drugs may be harmful to you.  
• You need a treatment that you may not take while on the study. 
 
If I have to permanently stop taking study drugs through the study, or once I leave the study, 
how can I get study drugs? 
 
If you must permanently stop taking SOF/VEL before the study is over, the study staff will talk 
with you about other options.  
 After you have finished the study, you will not be able to get SOF/VEL through the study. 
 
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  
 
Risks of Social Harm  
Although the study site will make every effort to protect your privacy and confidentiality, it is 
possible that others could find out that you are participating in this study and that social harm 
may result (because you could become labeled as being infected with HCV and/or HIV). For 
example, you could be treated unfairly or discriminated against by family members, friends, and/or the community.  
 
 86 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
Risks of Drawing Blood  
Drawing blood may cause some discomfort, lightheadedness, bleeding, swelling, or bruising where the needle enters the body, and in rare cases, fainting, or infection.  
 
Risks of Study Drug  
The study drug (SOF/VEL) is relatively safe and in controlled clinical trials it was found to have a safety profile similar to a placebo (no medicine). The most common side effects you may 
experience are headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and diarrhea.  
 SOF/VEL  has limited drug interactions with HIV medications with the exception of three HIV 
medications - efavirenz, tenofovir , and tipranavir/ritonavir. If you are taking any of these 
medications, your doctor will talk to you about these interactions in detail and what symptoms to 
look out for. Your doctor may modify your HIV medications after discussing it with you so that 
you can be included in this study.   
 
SOF/VEL  also has some interactions with other types of medications. There is risk of slow 
heartbeat if you also take amiodarone (a medication to help control heart rate).  While you are on 
the study, you will be instructed not to take any of the prohibited medications  (for example, 
heartburn medication mentioned earlier) . The study staff will explain the prohibited and 
precautionary medications and discuss alternative options if you must take any of these concomitant medications.    
 There is a risk of seriou s and/or life- threatening side effects when non- study medications are 
taken with the study drugs. For your safety, you must tell the study doctor or nurse about all 
medications you are taking before you start the study and also before starting any new 
medi cations while on the study. Also, you must tell the study doctor or nurse before enrolling in 
any other clinical trials while on this study.  
 
Other Risks  
There is a risk that your stored samples may be misused. There are laws against this kind of misuse, but they may not fully protect you. The chance that this will happen is considered small 
because of the security taken with your samples.  
 Your genetic in formation is unique to you. There is a risk in genetic research that someone 
using your samples may identify you. However, this risk is very small, but may increase with the 
progress of science. Researchers will inform you of any newly identified risks.  
 If you are cured of your HCV, you could still become infected again with HCV. You can get HCV  
from coming in contact with blood and/or sexual fluid that is infected with HCV . 
 
 ARE THERE RISKS RELATED TO DELAYING HIV THERAPY?  
 You are not required to be on HIV medications to enter this study. If you are not on HIV 
medications at the time of your HCV infection and you and your doctor do not think you need to 
start HIV medications, we will not exclude you from the study. We also do not recommend delaying HIV medications for entry into the study if your doctor feels they are medically 
 87 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
necessary. Although the dosing period of the HCV medication is short (84 days), a delay in necessary HIV medications could allow for progression of HIV disease, which can increase your risk of opportunistic infections and long- term after effects of HIV infection. If you have any 
concerns about these risks, we suggest that you discuss them with your medical provider.  
 
 
ARE THERE RISKS RELATED TO PREGNANC Y? 
 
The drugs or drug combinations in this study have not been studied extensively in pregnancy. If 
you are having sex that could lead to pregnancy, you must agree not to become pregnant  or to 
impregnate your partner  while you are taking the study medication  and for 6 weeks after 
stopping study medication. Note that if you become pregnant, study drug will be stopped and 
you will be asked to remain on the study. If you think you may be pregnant at any time during the study, tell your study staff right away.  Pregnancies occurring on study will be reported to the 
Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry, and study staff will request permission from you to obtain 
additional information after the baby is born.  
 Because of the risk involved, you must use at least one method of birth control that you discuss 
with the study staff. You must continue to use at least one method  as long as you are taking 
study medication  and for 6 weeks  after stopping study medication. You must agree to one or 
more of the birt h control methods listed below:  
• A condom (male or female) with or without a spermicide 
• Diaphragm or cervical cap with or without spermicide 
• An intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Tubal ligation  
• Hormone- based contraceptives  
 Male and female participants not of reproductive potential are not required to use 
contraceptives.  
 
Some of the methods listed above may not prevent the spread of HIV to other people. If you are 
also infected with HIV, you should discuss your contraceptive choices with your health care 
provider to choose the best way for you to both prevent pregnancy as required by this study and 
to prevent the spread of HIV to your partner.  
 Male participants should not donate sperm while on study treatment and for six weeks after 
stopping study medication.  
 
 
ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 If you take part in this study, there may be a direct benefit to you. The study is designed to treat 
your HCV infection with an approved study medication and you may be cured of your HCV. It is 
also possible that you may receive no benefit from being in this study. Information learned from this s tudy may help others who have HCV and/or  HIV.

 WHAT OTHER CHOICES DO I HAVE BESIDES THIS STUDY?  
 
Instead of being in this study, you have the choice of:  
• treatment with prescription drugs currently available to you 
• treatment with other experimental drugs, if you qualify  
• no treatment  
 
Please talk to your doctor about these and other treatment choices available to you and the 
risks and benefits of these choices.

Study Population and Design
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, multicohort, open -label study  that will be conducted in 
compliance wi th Internat ional Council for Harm onisati on (ICH) Good Clinical Pract ices (GCPs).  
Subjects satisfying the eligibilit y criteria will be assi gned to 1 of the fo llowing cohorts:
Cohort 1: will contain up to 20 subjects with anemia only that are not currently receiving 
RBC transfusio ns (these subjects will be referred to as “anemia only” throughout the 
protocol , defined as 0 RBC units/84 days immediately  prior to the C1D1 date)
Cohort 2: will contain up to 20 subjects that are RBC-transfusion dependent (these 
subjects will be referred to as “RBC -transfusio n dependent” throughout the protocol, 
defined as an average RBC transfusio n frequency of 2 to 4 RBC units/28 days over at 
least the 84 days immediately up to the C1D1 date )
Cohort 3A : will contain ≥ 10 subjects who meet the eligibilit y criteria for Cohort 1 
(anemia only) while being on a stable dose of ruxolit inib for at least 112 days
immediately  prior to the enrollment date
Cohort 3B: will contain approximately 46 subjects who meet the eligibilit y criteria for 
Cohort 2 (RBC -transfusio n dependent) while being on a stable dose of ruxo litinib for at 
least 112 day s immediately  prior to the enrollment date. Effect ive from Protocol  
Amendment 3, addi tional subjects for this cohort must also have a minimum prior 
treatm ent wi th ruxo litinib per their local standard -of-care for at l east 280 days (40 weeks)
without interruptions exceeding 2 consecut ive weeks, while being on a stable ruxo litinib 
dose for at least 112 days (16 weeks) immediately prior to the enrollment date.
Overall, the study  will enroll approximately 100subjects worl dwide across these parallel -
enrolling cohorts .  
The study  will consist of a :
Maximum 28-day Screening Peri od 
Up to a 2-year Treatm ent Peri od (consi sting of a 168 -day Primary  Phase, a Day  169 
Disease Response Assessment, and approximately 2-yearsor more forExtensio n 
Phase fo llowing the Cycle1 Day  1 (C1D1 )date, defined as the date of first dose of

continues to receive clinical benefit )from first dose of luspatercept ,and a Post treatm ent Follow -
up Peri od of  3 years. A roll -over study  will provi de continued access for subjects benefit ing from 
luspatercept in the Extensio n Phase of the Treatm ent Peri od and ensures the Posttreatm ent
Follow-up Peri od will  also be captured. 
The expect ed total study  durati on is approximately 6 years,which includes an enro llment period 
of approximately  26 m onths. 
The Screening Period 
Screening procedures aretotake place over a maximum  of28 days immediately prior to the 
enrollment date, which is def ined as the date in which subjects have been assigned a treatment cohort 
via Integrated R esponse Technology ( IRT).  
Review of historical bone marrow biopsy information will be used to confirm MPN -associ ated 
myelo fibrosis diagnosis.  The report (s)should co me fro m the most recent local bone marrow 
biopsy performed and shoul dcontain the mutational status of the disease (eg,Janus kinase 2
[JAK2] gene, calret iculin [CALR ]gene, and thrombopoiet in receptor [MPL ]gene).  
Transfusio n history  must be a vailable for at least the 84 days immediately prior to the subject’s 
C1D1 date.  Transfusio n data should include, but not be limited to, thenumber of units, volume 
of transfusio n, pretransfusio n hemoglo bin (Hgb)values, and date of transf usion.  Red bl oodcell 
transfusio ns given at outside local inst itutions must also be collected.  
Primary Phase of Treatm ent Peri od: Day  1 to Day  168 
The first dose of luspatercept should be administered as soon as possible (at the latest 3 calendar 
days) following the enrollment date and will be given on D ay 1 of each 21 -day treatm ent cycle 
(unless there are dose delays) .  In all cohorts, best supportive care (BSC) may be used in 
combinat ion with study  treatment when clinically  indicated per Invest igator. 
Day 169 Disea se Response Assessment 
The Day  169 Disease Response Assessment visit should be completed 169 days after the date of 
first dose, regardless of dose del ays.  
Extensio n Phase of Treatm ent Peri od: Day  169 through approximately 2 years or morefrom the 
date o f C1D1, if the subject continues to receive clinical benefit
Subjects who meet the clinical benefit criteria(refer to Secti on6.2.2 for more informati on)to 
remain on luspatercept treatment may cont inue dosing on Day 1 of each 21 -day treatment cy cle 
in the Extensio n Phase of the Treatment Period for approximately 2 years or moreuntil the 
subject is no longer receiving clinical benefit, experiences unacceptable toxicit ies, has disease 
progression, withdraws consent, or meets any other discontinuation criteria ( refer to Section 11
for more inform ation).  Best supportive care (BSC) may cont inue to be used in co mbinat ion with 
study  treatm ent when clinically  indicated per Investigator.  
The Disease Response Assessment sh ould be compl eted on Day  1 of every  Cycle in the 
Extensio n Phase until the subject is discont inued from treatment or wi thdraws consent .

Study Treatments
Each subject will receive a starting dose levelof luspatercept at 1.0 m g/kg subcutaneous 
inject ion every  3 weeks (administered on Day  1 of each 21 -day treatm ent cy cle).  The starti ng 
dose can be titrated (increased) during the Treatment Period (Primary Phase and Extensio n 
Phase) to 1.33 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 1.75 mg/kg, provided that the subject meets the 
appropriate criteria (refer to Section 7.3).  The subject’s dose may also be delayed, re duced, or 
discontinued, depending on the specific criteria (refer to Section 7.3).  
Subjects enrolling into Coh ort 3B following implementation of P rotocol  Amendment 3 will 
begin luspatercept treatment at a starting dose of 1.33 mg/kg and can have their dose increased to 
a maximum  dose of 1.75 m g/kg (wi th the total  dose not to exceed 168 mg).

Statistical Methods
For m ore specific inf ormation, please refer to Section 9of the protocol.  
The analysis populat ions for this protocol are the intent -to-treat (ITT) populat ion, the effi cacy 
evaluable (EE) populat ion,and the safet y popul ation.  
A sample size of approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled as follows:
-Cohort 1: approximately 20 subjects , but no l ess than 14 EE subj ects
-Cohort 2
: approximately 20 subjects
-Cohort 3: up to 60subjects 
A subject who meets all o f the inclusio n/exclusio n criteria will be considered “efficacy 
evaluable” upon receiving ≥ 3 cy cles of l uspatercept and rem ain in the study  for ≥ 21 day s 
following the third dose of luspatercept.  Subjects who attain H gb values > 13 g/dL in < 3 cy cles 
will also be considered efficacy evaluable.  Subjects not considered “efficacy evaluable” are in 
general those that receive < 3 cy cles of l uspatercept in which luspatercept is held or discontinued 
or who receive < 3 cyclesdue to a treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) or discontinued 
treatm ent for any  other reason (these subjects will be scored as a nonresponder).

Confident ial and Propri etary 11 ACE -536-MF-001 Amendment 4Final : 19 Feb 2020Subjects willbecome nonefficacy evaluable in certain cases (eg ,prohibited conco mitant 
medicat ion/s was/were used during the study ).  Subjects spec ifically  in Cohort 3 beco me 
nonefficacy  evaluable in certain cases (eg, the ruxolit inib dose was modified during the study ).  
The study  steering co mmittee willreview the allocation of all subjects to the EE populat ion. 
The Sponsor estimates that out of 20 enrolled subjects in Cohort 1, at least 14 will beco me 
efficacy  evaluable.  For Cohort 1, the probabilit y of observing no responses among 14 subjects is 
lessthan 0.05 if the response probabilit y is greater than 20%.  If no responses are observed in the 
first 14 eval uable subjects, the trial will be stopped because it can be concluded that the response 
rate for the primary endpo int is less than 20% in Cohort 1 , and not worthy  of further 
investigat ion.  Cohorts 2 and 3 will also be stopped due to clinical considerat ions. 
The sample size of Cohort 3 isincreased to approximately 60 ITT subjects by the addit ion of up 
to 27 addit ional subject s (a total ofapproxim ately 46subjects ) in Cohort 3B. The sample size of 
Cohort 3A remains the same. A total of 46 subjects in Cohort 3B would provide for 80% power 
to detect a 15% increase in response rate for luspatercept over a null response rate of 17%. This 
assumes a o ne-sided ztest of a bino mial proportion (with a 5% significance level).
All efficacy analyses will be conducted primarily in the ITT populat ion.  Confirmat oryanalyses 
will be conducted in the EE populat ion. 
The primary  efficacy  endpoint i s the proporti on of subjects that achieved anemia response as 
defined below: 
Cohort s1 (anemia only) and 3A: 
Proporti on of  subjects achieving ≥1.5 g/dL hemoglo bin increase fro m baseline over any  
consecut ive 84 -day period wi thout an RBC transfusion fro m Day 1 up throug h and including 
Day 168.  Thi s 84- day period will  begin as soon as the ≥1.5 g/dL hemoglobin increase is 
detected.  There must be ≥ 3 determinat ions of ≥1.5 g/dL hemoglobin increase from baseline
in this interval wit h no value showing a < 1.5 g/dL hemoglobin increase from baseline andno 
2measurements are ≥ 42 days apart.
Cohort s2 (RBC -transfusion dependent) and 3B: 
Propor tion of  subjects who beco me RBC -transfusion freeover any consecutive 84 -day 
period from Day 1 up through and includi ng Day  168.  Thi s 84- day period will begin from  
the date of the prior RBC transfusion that is given for a Hgb value ≤9.5 g/dL.
Anemia response rate ,together with a 95% confidence interval ,will be calculated for each 
cohort. 
Secondary  efficacy endpo intanalyses will include:
Time to anemia response will be summarized only  for subjects who achieved anemia 
response. It is defined as t ime from first dose to first onset of anemia response, calculated 
from Day 1 through and including Day 168. 
Duration of anemia response will be summarized only for subjects who achieved anemia 
response. It is defined as maximum durat ion of modified anemia response, calculated from 
Day 1 through end of treatm ent.

1.1. Myeloproliferative Neoplasm -associated Myelofibrosis
Myel oproliferative neopl asm (MPN )-associ ated myelo fibrosis is a clonal myelo id neoplasm 
characterized by  defective bone m arrow function, bone marrow fibrosis, extramedullary 
hematopoiesis, a propensit y fortransformation to blast phase, and an inflammatory  state.  Levels 
of hematopoi etic stem and progenitor cells in the blood are increased ,reflect ing abnormal 
homing of hematopoietic stem and progeni tor cells.  Hem atopoi esis in MPN -associ ated 
myelo fibrosis is clonal arising fro m a transformed multipotent hematopoiet ic progenitor cell.
The cause of MPN -associ ated myel ofibrosis is unknown and there are no known etiological 
factors.  About 50% of patients with MPN -associ ated myel ofibrosis have a mutation in the Janus 
kinase 2 ( JAK2) gene , about 33% of patients have a mutation in the calreticulin(CALR )gene,
and about 5% of patients have a mutation inthe thrombopoi etin receptor (MPL ) gene .  About 
25% of patients have no detectable mutation and are referred to as triple -negative .  Mutati ons in 
other genes such as TET2, ASXL1 and DMT3A are also sometimes found and can precede or 
follow development of the driver mutations.  
Myel oproliferative neopl asm (MPN )-associ ated myelo fibrosis can develop direct ly (primary 
myelo fibrosis [PMF] ) or evolve fro m other MPNs ,including po lycyt hemia vera (PV) and 
essent ial thrombocy themia (ET).  F or purposes of this study , MPN -associated myelo fibrosis is 
defined as PMF, post -polycyt hemia vera myelo fibrosis (post -PV MF), and post -essent ial 
thrombocy themia myel ofibrosis (post -ET MF).  
1.1.1. Signs and Symptoms 
Myel oproliferative neopl asm (MPN )
-associ ated myelo fibrosis is pre dominately a disease of the 
elderly  with a median age at onset in a range of 69 to 76 y ears ( Moul ard, 2013) .  Ery thropoiesis 
is qualitat ively and quant itatively abnormal result ing in anemia in about 30% of affected patients 
atdiagnosis .  However, eventually all affected p atients develop anemia .  Anemia is often 
confounded by comorbiditiestypical  of an o lder populat ion like atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease and cerebrovascular disease.  Severe anemia unresponsive to thera py can be fatal .  
Myel opoiesis is also qualitat ively and quant itatively abnormal result ing in decreased or increased 
granulocy tes and/or pl atelets.  Infect ion risk is increased because of decreased numbers of and/or 
dysfunct ional granulo cytes.  Furtherm ore, there may  be bleeding from decreased numbers o f 
and/or dysfunct ional platel ets.  Extra medullary hematopoiesis ,typical  of MPN -associ ated 
myelo fibrosis ,resul ts in spleen and liver enlargement (splenomegaly  and hepatom egaly , 
respectively ) in about 60% of affected patients at diagnosis result ing in early sat iety, wei ght loss, 
and const itutional symptom s.  
Myeloproliferat ive neoplasm ( MPN )-associated myelo fibrosis is a 
progressive disorder such that many o f the signs and symptom s discussed above will develop
with time even in patients in who m they are absent at di agnosis.  
1.1.2. Prognosis 
Median survival of patientswith MPN -associated myelo fibrosis is 5 to 6 years fro m diagnosis.  
Several prognostic scores are used that combine independent prognostic variables including age, 
gender, spleen and/or liver enlargement, hemoglobin (Hgb) level, red bl ood cell ( RBC)-
transfusio n dependence, numbers of leukocy tes and/or pl atelets, numbers of monocy tes or

2009; Dupri ez, 1996 ; Tefferi , 2007 ; Tefferi , 2009 ).  In a recent study  involving >1000 subjects ,
multivaria te analysis of parameters ob tained at di agnosis i dentified age > 65 years, constitutional 
symptoms, hemoglobin concentrati on < 10 g/dL, leukocy te levels >25
x 109/L and blood 
myelo blasts ≥ 1% as predictors of shortened survival.  Several o f these paramete rs are al so 
associ ated wi th an increased ri sk of transformat ion to bl ast phase.  In this study , the y early  
incidence rates for transformat ion to blast phase was 3.7% and deat hs due to transformat ion to 
blast phase within a 10 -year period was 18% ( Quintas -Cardama, 2013 ; updated by  personal  
communicat ion with Srdan Verstovsek 01 May  2017 ).  
Patients developing MPN -associ ated myelo fibrosi s after PV or ET have the same prognosis to 
those wi th PMF.
Recent ly, associat ions are reported between prognosis and mutational landscape.  For example, 
patients with CALR mutations have the best prognosis whereas those with no detectable mutation 
(triple negative ) have the worst prognosis.  The conco mitant presence of non-driver mutations,
such as those in ASXL1 , TET2 and DNMT3A ,are also associated with a worse prognosis.
1.2. Treatment of MPN -associated Myelofibrosis 
Two types of  therapi es are used in MPN -associated myelo fibrosi s: (1) targeting the cancer clone 
and (2) targeting signs and symptoms of the disease.  Current therapies have litt le impact on 
survival.  Commo nly used therap ies include drugs to reverse anemia (refer to below), drugs to 
decrease the size of t he neoplast ic clone ,and ant i-inflammatory  drugs , where s ometimes these 
targets overlap.  Splenectomy and/or spleen radiat ion are also sometimes done, whereas 
hematopoi etic cell transplants are rarely used because of advanced age and co -morbidities.
In 2011 and 2012, the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )and European Medicines Agency 
(EMA) , respectively ,approved ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase ( JAK)inhibitor intended for therapy  of 
MPN -associ ated myel ofibrosis.  Currently, it is the standard of care for trea ting spleno megaly 
and const itutional symptom s, offering significant improvements in spleen shrinkage, symptom 
mitigation, and overall survival.  However, therapy -induced cytopenias like anemia may impair 
administration of optimal therapeut ic doses as they can occur transient ly.
Several other JAK or signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT )inhibitors are 
currently in development , and though they are not targeted , they are effect ive in reducing 
splenomegaly  and const itutional symptom s in patients with and wi thouttheJAK2 mutation.  
However, t here is controversy whether they improve survival. Several other drug classes are in 
development including telo merase inhibitors and ant i-fibrotic drugs ( eg, pentraxin).  
1.2.1. Treatment for Anemia 
Anemia is present at diagnosis in about 30% of p atients with MPN -associated myelo fibrosis and 
develops in almost all patients.  The eti ology of anemia in MPN- associated myel ofibrosis is 
complex, as several mechanisms may operate in an affected person ( Barosi , 2010).   Some drugs 
used to treat MPN -associated myelo fibrosis ,such as hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) and 
ruxolitinib, worsen anemia.  
Overall, a nemia and RBC- transfusio ndependence are strong, independent prognostic variables 
for survival and for risk of transformat ion to bl ast phase (Passamo nti, 2010; El ena, 2011 ).

Confident ial and Propri etary 22 ACE -536-MF-001 Amendment 4Final : 19 Feb 2020Therapy  of anemia in MPN- associ ated myelo fibrosis is problemat ic, and there are no prove nor 
approved therapies .  Currently , there are no FDA -or EMA -approved drugs for the treatment of 
anemia wit h or without RBC -transfusion dependence in patients with MPN -associ ated 
myelo fibrosis , but c ommo nly used interventions include therapies such as corticosteroi ds, 
androgenic steroids, erythropoietin, thalido mide ,and pomalido mide.  None have been prove n
effect ive in an adequately powered, double -blind, rando mized clinical trial.  A recent large 
rando mized trial o f pomalido mide reported no benefit ,but other invest igational studi es of  
pomalidomide and corticosteroids report contradictory  data ( Tefferi, 2017; Schlenk, 2016 ).
In summary, no therapy  has been proven safe and effect ive to treat anemia in p atientswith MPN -
associ ated myel ofibrosis .  
1.2.1.1. Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents 
Erythropoi esis stimulat ing agent s(ESAs) are widely used for the treatment of anemia associated 
with both lymphoid and myelo id neopl asms.  In general, serum ery thropoi etin (EPO) levels in 
patients with MPN -associated myel ofibrosis are elevated for the degree of anemia and 
exogenous use of ESAs are of limited value ( Barosi, 1993). 
Some patients with EPO l evels < 500 IU/L receive pharmacological doses of reco mbinant human 
EPO.  Response rates a re <20% and complete responses are unco mmo n, while m ost responses 
are transient.  Currently, t here are no randomized clinical trials o f recombinant human EPO in 
patients with MPN -associated myelo fibrosis who are RBC -transfusio n dependent.  Retrospective 
series in such pat ients treated with EPO or darbepoetin reported occasional response (Cervantes, 
2004; Cervantes, 2006 ; Rodri guez, 1998 ; Tsiara, 2007 ).  The data suggest ESAs have limited 
therapeuti c act ivity in RBC- transfusio n dependent patients with MPN -associated myelofibrosis 
and anemia regardless of serum EPO levels ( Huang, 2009 ).
1.2.1.2. Androgenic Steroids 
Andr ogenic steroi ds are sometimes used to treat anemia in patients with MPN -associ ated 
myelo fibrosis.  A retrospective analys is of case reports i dentified 5 of 27 (18%) subjects with 
MPN -associ ated myel ofibrosis and RBC -transfusion -dependence responding to tre atment
with 
danazol (Cervantes, 2015 ).  Complete responses are unco mmo n and often transient , whi ch are in 
line with earlier studies .  Additionally, a ndrogenic steroids are associated with risks of liver 
toxicity and liver and prostate cancers.  Based on these data ,use of androgenic steroids in this 
setting is not proven safe and effect ive in patients with MPN -associated myelo fibrosis who are 
RBC- transfusio ndependent ( Branda, 1977; Brubaker, 1982 ; Cervantes, 2005 ;Levy, 1996 ).
1.2.1.3. Corticosteroids 
Corti costeroi ds do not produce sustained improvement in hemoglo bin concentrations in patients 
with MPN -associated myelo fibrosis.  Corticosteroids are poorly -tolerated, especially in o lder
patients, and increase infect ion risk in patients with decreased norma l spleen funct ion and in 
patients who have been splenectomized (Odeni ke, 2005) .  
1.2.1.4. Thalidomide, Lenalidomide , and Pomalidomide

reported to improve outcomes wit h MPN -associ ated myelo fibrosi s in nonrando mized clinical 
trials. However, the efficacy of thalido mide and lenalido mide are severely limited by adverse 
effects , toxi cities that are uncommo n with pom alidomide.  Furtherm ore, p omalidomide is m ore 
active in modulat ing levels of inflammatory  cytokines and growth factors.  Data from 
experimental models and a Celgene -sponsored trial indicate pom alidomide increases
erythropoi esis in mice wit h sickle cell disease and humans with MPN -associated myelo fibrosis.  
A rando mized Phase 3 study  showed no benefit of low -dose pom alidomide over placebo in 
subjects with RBC -transfusio ndependence (Tefferi, 2017 ).  However, a Phase 2 study  of a 
higher dose of pomalido mide co mbined with prednisone reported activit y (Schlenk, 2016 ).
1.2.1.5. Sotatercept
Sotatercept (ACE -011) i s a novel so luble receptor fusio n protein (activin recepto r type IIA 
linked to Fc fragment of human immunogl obulin [ Ig]G1) that “traps” ligands that bind to the 
activin ty pe IIA receptor.  
Sotatercept is extensively studied in humans and is active in treating anemia in pat ients 
associ ated wi th β-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ).  Like luspatercept, 
sotatercept targets mo lecules in the transforming growth factor -beta ( TGF -β)superfamily , but 
sotatercept contains the human activin t ype IIA receptor whereas luspatercept contains the 
activin ty pe IIB re ceptor.
Sotatercept is current ly being studied in subjects with MPN -associated myelo fibrosis and anemia 
receiving or not receiving ruxo litinib.  Preliminary results suggest sotatercept improves anemia 
and RBC -transfusio n dependence in pat ients with MPN -associated myel ofibrosis and i s well -
tolerated (Bose, 2016 ).
1.3. Luspatercept Backgroun d
Luspatercept (ACE -536) i s a recombinant fusio n protein consist ing of a modified form of the 
extracellular domain (ECD) of the human act ivin rec eptor ty pe IIB (ActRIIB) linked to the IgG1 
Fc domain ( Figure 1A). The ActRIIB receptor and its ligands are members of the transforming 
growth factor -β (TGF -β) superfamily, a group of proteins invo lved in the development, 
different iation, and/or maturation of various tissues.  No species differences have been described 
in the ligand- receptor interactions amo ng m embers of the TGF -β family  as the ligands and 
receptors are highly conserved across species ( Massague, 1998 ).  Thus, observat ions from  
pharmaco logy studi es of luspatercept or its murine ortholog RAP -536 in animal models provide 
significant insight into the potential o f luspatercept to treat human disease. 
Members of the TGF -β ligands ,through their binding to activin receptors, are invo lved in 
modulat ing the different iation of late -stage ery throcyte precursors (norm oblasts) in the bone 
marrow. In particular, luspatercept acts as a ligand trap for growth different iation factor 11 
(GDF11 )and other TGF -βfamily ligands to suppress Smad2/3 signaling. In nonclinical 
experiments, luspatercept has been shown to bind with high affinit y to some TGF -β ligands ( eg, 
GDF11, bone morphogenetic protein 6 [ BMP6 ]and activin B) but substant ially lessto others 
(eg, bone morph ogenet ic protein 9 [ BMP9 ]and activin A). The m echanism o f action of  
luspatercept is independent fro m that of erythropoietin ( EPO ) (Suragani, 2014). While EPO 
stimulates proliferat ion and different iation of early ery throid progeni tors, l uspatercept prom otes

bone marrow ( refer to Figure 1B).
During norm al erythropoi esis, GDF11 appears to inhibit different iation and m aintain the survival 
of immature ery throid progeni tors, but i ts expression is decreased as cells mature, and thus its 
effect is transient. In a mouse m odel of thalassemia, defects in ery throid differentiation led to an 
accumulat ion of GDF11 expressing cells that maintained their own survival ( Dussi ot, 2014 ). 
Recent studi es (Dussiot, 2014 ; Suragani, 2014) i dent
ified GDF11 as a regulator of erythropoiesis 
and showed that its inhibit ion in mouse m odels of anemia wit h ineffect ive erythropoiesis restores 
norm al erythropoietic different iation and improves anemia.

Confident ial and Propri etary 25 ACE -536-MF-001 Amendment 4Final : 19 Feb 20201.3.2. Summary of Clinical Experience
Luspatercept is current ly in Phase 3 of clinical  devel opment in MDS and beta -thalassemia. 
Luspatercept is current ly being assessed in two Phase 2 studies in subjects with MDS .  In these 
studi es,the preliminary  Internati onal Working Group ( IWG ) hem atologic improvem ent –
erythroid (HI-
E)response for subjects treated wi th luspatercept dose levels o f ≥ 0.75 m g/kg in 
the base study  (A536 -03) and the extensio n study (A536 -05) respectively were seen in 1 8out of 
29 (62% ) and 19 out of 23 (83%) subjects with ring si deroblast s (RS+)with EPO levels < 200 
U/L, as well as 5 out of 11 (46%) and 7 out of 8 (88%)RS+ subjects with EPO levels 200 to 500
U/L. Subjects were al so evaluated on the bas is of whether they  achieved RBC -transfusio n
independence (RBC- TI)for ≥8 weeks. The RBC -TI response for subjects treated wi th 
luspatercept dose levels o f ≥0.75 m g/kg in the base stu dy and extensio n study  respect ively were 
seen in 13 out of 19 (68%)and 10 out of 14 (71%
)RS+ subjects with EPO l evels < 200 U/L, as 
well as 3 out of 9 (33%) and 3 out of 5 (60%) RS+ subjects with EPO l evels 200 to 500
U/L. Furthermore, in the extension study, 17 out of 28 (61%) subjects overall had achieved 
transfusio n independence, in which the longest duration of ery throid response was up to 22 
months (treatment ongoing) (Platzbecker, 20 16).
Preliminary data for RS -subjects is encouraging for both HI -E response and RBC -TI.
In a Phase 3 (MEDALIST) trial, luspatercept resulted in a significant ly reduced transfusio n 
burden compared with placebo in pat ients with anemia due to R evised Intern ational Prognosti c 
Scoring Sy stem  (IPSS-R ) very low- , low-, or intermediate -risk MDS with ring sideroblasts who 
requi re RBC transfusio ns, and overall , was generally  well tol erated. Data demonstrated that 58 
out of 153 (37.9%) subjects in the luspatercept arm achieved RBC transfusio n independence for 
≥ 8 weeks compared to 10 out of 76 (13.2%) subjects in the placebo arm ( Fenaux, 2018).
Luspatercept is current ly being assessed in two Phase 2 studies i n subjects with β -thalassemi a.  
In these studies, 25 out of 31 (81%) transfusio n-depende nt (TD) subjects treated with ≥ 
0.6mg/kg had a ≥20% reducti on and 17 out of 31 subjects (
55%) had a ≥50% reduction in 
transfusio n burden over any 12- week peri od during the 3 -month study  (A536-04). For 
nontransfusio n dependen t (NTD) subjects treated with ≥ 0.6 m g/kg, 7 out of 21 subjects (
33%)
achieved an increase in Hgb ≥1.5 g/dL sustained for ≥14 day s and 13 out of 21 subjects (62%
)
achieved a m ean increase in Hgb ≥ 1.0 g/dL sustained for ≥12 weeks in the 3 -month treatment 
study (Piga, 2016 )
.
In a Phase 3 (BELIEVE) trial, luspatercept resulted in significant ly reduced transfusio n burden in 
adults wi th transfusi on-dependent β-thalassemia, and overall, was generally  well tolerated.  Data 
demonstrated that 48 out of 224 (21.4%) subjects in the luspatercept arm achieved a ≥ 33% 
reducti on from baseline in transfusio n burden during weeks 13 to 24 compared to 5 out of 112 
(4.5%) subjects in the placebo arm ( Cappellini, 2018 ).
Until now, no clinical trials invest igating the efficacy  of luspatercept in MPN -associated 
myelo fibrosis have been init iated/completed.  
Addit ional information regarding clinical experience with luspatercept is summarized in the 
current version of the luspatercept IB.

Confident ial and Propri etary 26 ACE -536-MF-001 Amendment 4Final : 19 Feb 20201.3.3. Potential Risks of Human Use 
Increases in hematol ogic parameters ( ie, RBC, Hgb, hematocri t, reticul ocytes) are expected 
pharmacologic effects of luspatercept treatment.  Increases in systolic and diastolic blood 
pressures may  occur i n concert wi th increases in hemoglobin values.  Excessive or rapid 
increases in hemoglo bin or blood pressure may occur and will be mo nitored.  Dos e modificat ion 
rules for individual subjects, including dose delay and/or dose reduction, will be utilized to 
minimize risks associated with increased RBC parameters. 
Adverse events observed in the Phase 1 study  in healthy volunteers and the ongoing P hase 2 
studi es that were consi dered probably or possibly  related to invest igational product included 
inject ion site reactions (hemorrhage, pruritus, rash), skin rash, hyperesthesia, muscle spasms, 
myalgia, pruritus, and hyperkalemia.
As wi th all bi ologics, the re is the potential for ant idrug antibodies (ADA) that can be associated 
with increased drug clearance and hypersensit ivity reacti ons.  Antidrug antibody ( ADA )
formation against l uspatercept as well as human ActRIIB protein will be monitored in the init ial
clinical studies. 
Luspatercept has exhibited maternal and developmental toxicit y in reproductive toxicit y studi es 
in preclinical species and therefore luspatercept should not be administered to pregnant or 
nursing women.  Male and female subjects of childbearing potential participating in studies of 
luspatercept must be willing to abstain from sexual intercourse or use adequate contraception 
during the treatment and fo llow-up peri od of  the study .  Please refer to the IB for addit ional 
inform ation regardin g findings fro m toxicol ogy studi es.  It i s unknown if humans will experience 
any of the effects of luspatercept that were noted in the rat and monkey toxico logy studi es.  
Safety effects will be mo nitored cl osely through adverse event (AE) reporting, clinic al laboratory  
tests, vi tal signs, and physical examinat ions. 
A co mprehensive review of luspatercept, as well as details regarding the informat ion 
summarized above, is provided in the IB.  The most recent version of the luspatercept IB should 
be reviewed pri or to init iating the study.
1.4. Rationale
1.4.1. Study Rationale and Purpose
Anemia and rel ated symptom s are important features of MPN -associated myelo fibrosis.  Patients 
with anemia and those receiving RBC transfusio ns have significantly worse survival and an 
increased risk of transformat ion to bl ast phase. Therapies such as ESAs, androgenic steroids ,
and corticosteroids are rarely  effect ivewith most responses transient ,while d ata regarding 
efficacy  of pomalido mide iscontroversial.  No drug is approved to treat an emia in patients with 
MPN -associ ated myel ofibrosis.  
Luspatercept is a novel recombinant fusio n protein consist ing of a modified form of the 
extracellular domain (ECD) of the human act ivin receptor ty pe IIB (ActRIIB).  Luspatercept 
stimulates the l ater, m aturati on phase of ery thropoiesis and improves anemia in patients with 
MDS and beta -thalassemia.  Sotatercept, active in patients with MPN -associated myelofibrosis 
and an emia, i s structurally  similar toluspatercept.

with MPN -associated myelo fibrosis and anemia with and without RBC- transfusio n dependence. 
1.4.2. Rationale for the S tudy Design
This study  is a multicenter, multicohort , parallel -enrolling, single -arm,Phase 2 study  of anemia 
response , where t he multicenter nature of the study provides assurance that the results are likely 
to have applicabilit y for planning a confirmatory  Phase 3 study .
Three cohorts with dist inct entry criteria are included.   The rati onale for each of the cohorts is as 
follows:
Cohort 1 (anemia only) : 
 
 
Cohort 2 (RBC -transfusion dependent) :  
 
 
Cohort 3 ( subjects on ruxolitinib as part of their standard -of-care therapy) :  
 
  
Beginning wit h Protocol Amendment 3, in addit ion to RBC
-transfusio n dependent subjects with 
a defined average RBC -transfusio n frequency of6to 12RBC units/ 84days, subjects with an 
RBC transfusio n burden of4to5RBC units/ 84days may also be eligible for enrol lment.
Eligibilit ycriteria are consistent wi th those in other studies of this populat ion.  Safety  is assessed 
by evaluat ing adverse events and laboratory data.  Adverse events and abnormal laboratory value 
severit y will be graded using versio n 4.03 of the Nati onal Cancer Institute Commo n 
Termino logy Cri teria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE).

3.1. Study Design
The study  will be conducted in com pliance wi th the International Council forHarm onisati on 
(ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceut icals for Hum an Use/Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory  requi rements.
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open -label study to evaluate the efficacy  and safet y of luspatercept 
in subjects w ith MPN -associated myelofibrosis and anemia with and without RBC
-transfusion 
dependence.  The study  is divided into a Screening Period, a Treatment Period (consist ing of a 
Primary Phase, a Day  169 Disease Response Assessment, and an Extensi on Phase), fo llowed by  
a Posttreatm entFollow -u
p Peri od.  The overall study  design is described in Figure 2, wi th more 
detailed descript ions for each phase of the study  design found in Secti on6.
Subjects satisfying the eligibilit y criteria will be assigned to 1of the following cohorts (which 
are enrolling in parallel) based on their eligibilit y: 
Cohort 1: will contain up to 20 subjects with anemia only that are not currently 
receiving RBC transfusio ns (these subjects will be referred to as “anemia only” 
throughout the protocol , defined as 0 RBC uni ts/84 day s immediately  upto the C1D1
date)
Cohort 2: will contain up to 20 subjects that are RBC -transfusion dependent ( these 
subjects will be r eferred to as “RBC -transfusio n dependent” throughout the protocol, 
defined as an average RBC transfusio n frequency of 2 to 4 RBC units /28 day sover at 
least the 84 days immediately up to the C1D1 date )
Cohort 3A : will contain ≥ 10 subjects who meet the eli gibilit y criteria for Cohort 1 
(anemia only) while being on a stable dose of ruxolit inib for at least 112 days
immediately  prior to the enrollment date
Cohort 3B : will contain approximately 46 subjects who meet the eligibilit y criteria 
for Cohort 2 (RBC -transfusio n dependent) while being on a stable dose of ruxo litinib 
for at least 112 days immediately  prior to the enrollment date. Effect ive from Protocol 
Amendment 3, additional subjects for this cohort must also have a minimum prior 
treatm ent wi th ruxo litinib per their local standard -of-care for at least 280 days (40 
weeks )without interruptions exceeding 2 consecutive weeks, while being on a stable 
ruxolitinib dose for at least 112 day s (16 weeks) immediately prior to the enrollment 
date.
Refer to the eligibilit ycriteria (Secti on4) for full cohort specifications.   
The subject must be enrolled at the latest 28 day s from  signing the informed conse nt form (ICF) , 
designated as the enro llment date .  The first dose of luspatercept (designated as Cycle 1 Day  1 
[C1D1 ]
) should be administered as soon as possible (at the latest 3 calendar days) following the 
enrollment date (but can occur on the same day a s the enrollment date) .
Subjects across each cohort will receive a starting dose level of luspatercept at 1.0 m g/kg 
subcutaneous inject ion every  3 weeks ( administered on Day  1 of each 21 -day treatm ent cy cle).

After a Screening Period of at most28 days immediately prior to their enrollment date, eligible 
subjects should receive luspatercept treatm ent through at l east 
the first 168 days of the study  
unless the subject experiences unacceptable toxicit ies, has disease progression, withdraws 
consent, or meets any other discont inuat ion criteria (refer to Section 11).

Confident ial and Propri etary 50 ACE -536-MF-001 Amendment 4Final : 19 Feb 2020cOn dosing days, local laboratory sample should be collected, with white blood count (WBC) and Hgb levels assessed prior to ea ch luspatercept administration to ensure dose 
modification rules are followed.  Blood myeloblasts sh ould also be assessed prior to luspatercept dosing.  In case a subject had an elevated blood myeloblast percentage at the 
previous treatment cycle ( ≥ 10%), the blood myeloblast percentage needs to be assessed within a week prior to the next treatm ent cycle .  In these circumstances, a split sample 
should also be collected and sent to the central laboratory for analysis.  Subjects must have blood pressure assessed prior t o each luspatercept administration.  Should a dose 
delay occur on the day of dosing, refe r to Section 7.3for more information .
dCentral assessments are not required when local test results confirming HIV, HepB, Hep C are available within 8 weeks immedia tely prior to the enrollment date. If bey ond this 
window, additional central laboratory testing will be requested.
eOnly serious adverse events (SAEs) related to luspatercept will be captured post the 42 -Day Follow -up Period.
fClinical site staff should confirm if any transfusions were received by the sub ject (including any at outside institutions in between study visits) prior to each dose of luspatercept
via use of a transfusion diary or other local procedure in place at the investigational site .  Subjects should record information relating to transfusions (eg, date of transfusion, 
pretransfusion Hgb levels, number of units transfused, volume of transfusion, etc.) they may have received outside the study site .  In addition to local procedures that may be in 
place at the site to capture this inf ormation, a transfusion diary will be provided to all subjects and will be reviewed by the site when/if returned by the subje ct.
gDuring the Treatment Period, the Day 169 Disease Response Assessment should be completed by the Investigator.  At Day 169, ba sed on the outcome of the Disease Response 
Assessment, subjects will either be discontinued from treatment and enter the Posttreatm ent Follow -up Period or continue treatment with luspatercept in the Extension Phase of 
the Treatment Period.  
hThe L ong-term Follow -up Period for transformation to blast phase, other malignancies/premalignancies, and data collection for subsequent myelof ibrosis therapies may be 
conducted by record review (including public records if allowed by local regulations) and/or telephone contact with the subje ct, family, or the subject’s treating physician.  The 
Investigator must make every effort to obtain inform ation regarding the subject’s survival status before determining the subject is lost to follow up.

designee.
All o f the protocol  requi red assessments are listed in Secti on5, Table 3, wit h an “X” indicat ing 
at whi ch visit s the assessments are to be performed. All data obtained from these assessments 
must be recorded in the subject’s source documentation.  Except for the Day 169 Disease 
Response Assessment, all study visits during the Treatm ent Peri od (both Primary  and Extensi on 
Phases) must occur within ± 3 days of the scheduled day .  A 14 -day window i s allo wed for the

up Peri od assessments ( ie, 
transformation to blast phase , posttreatment myelo fibrosis therapi es).  Procedures are described 
in detail below.
Safety laboratory  analyses and all laboratory  assessments will be performed centrally  (except 
otherwi se stated in this sect ion) during the Treatment Period.  
Local  laboratori es are only allowed in cases when timely  resul ts are needed ( eg, study  treatment 
dosing decisio ns, hematol ogy assessments between clinic visit s, adverse events).  In these 
circumstances, a split sample should st ill be co llected and sent to the central laboratory for 
analysis.  Local laboratory  data shoul d be collected in the electronic case report form ( eCRF)if 
relevant to dose administration, dose modification, an AE, or when no central laboratory  resul ts

6.1. Screening P eriod
Upon giving written informed consent, subjects enter the Screening Period to determine 
eligibilit y. Subject screening procedures (performed locally/centrally) aretotake place over a 
maximum o f 28 day simmediately prior to their enrollment date, which will be defined in this protocol 
as the date in which they have been assigned a treatment cohort via IRT.  The first dose of 
luspatercept (designated as the C1D1 date) should be administered as soon as pos sible (at the 
latest 3 calendar days) fo llowing the enrollment date . During the Screening Period, the subject 
will undergo safet y and other assessments to determine eligibilit y for the study .  Screening 
laboratory  values m ust dem onstrate subj ect eligibili ty but may be repea ted wi thin the screening 
window if clinically  justified.  Subjects that have met all eligibilit y criteria during the Screening 
Period will be eligible for enrollment.  
Review of historical bone marrow biopsy informatio n will be used to confirm MPN -associ ated 
myelo fibrosis diagnosis.  The report should co me from  the m ost recent local bone m arrow 
biopsy performed and shoul dcontain the mutational status of the disease ( eg, JAK2, MPL , and

6.2. Treatment Period
The subject will beenrolled into the study  following Sponsor review of eligibili ty.
The subject must be enrolled at the latest 28 day sfrom  signing the ICF.   The first dose of 
luspatercept (designated as C1D1) should be administered as soon as possible (at the latest 3
calendar days) following the enrollment date. In case a subject should beco me ineligible after 
being enrolled but prior to receiving the first dose of luspatercept, they  must be di scont inued 
from the study .  These subjec ts will be replaced.   
If screening assessments are performed within 72 hours of the C1D1 date, safet y laboratory  and 
physical examinat ions woul d not need tobe repeated during the C1D1 date, with the except ion 
of bloodpressure measurement s, hematol ogy, serum ferrit in, and serum EPO sample co llections.  
Ondosing days, l ocal laboratory  WBC and Hgb l evels shoul d be assessed pri or to each 
luspatercept administration. In case a subject had an elevated blood myelo blast percentage at the 
previous treatment c ycle, the blood myelo blast percentage needs to be assessed within a week 
prior to the next treatment cy cle.  These parameters are to ensure the dose modificat ion rules are 
followed as outlined in Section7.
In these circumstances, a split sample should also be co llected and sent to the central laboratory 
for analysis.  Subjects should also have blood pressure assessed (as detailed in Section6.1) and 
the clinical site must confirm with the subject if any transfusio ns were received at outside local 
centers in between study  visits prior to each luspatercept administration .
6.2.1. Primary Phase of the Treatment Period
Subjects will receive luspatercept on Day  1 of each 21 -day treatm ent cy cle (unless there are dose 
delays) through at least Day  168 fo llowing the C1D1 date unless the subject experiences 
unacceptable toxi cities, wi thdraws consent, or m eets any  other treatm ent di scontinuat ion criteria

must be confirmed upon the completion of the Disease Response Assessment by  the Investigator 
at the Day  169 visi t:
Cohorts 1 (anemia only) and 3A 
Subjects with ≥3 determinations showing a ≥1.5g/dL hemoglo binincrease above the 
baseline value (defined as the subject’s Hgb value observed on the C1D1 date prior to 
luspatercept administration) absent of RBC transfusions over a consecut ive ≥ 84- day period 
with no 2measurements ≥42 days apart (and no determinat ion <1.5 g/dL above the baseline 
value) at the time o f the Day 169 Disease Response Assessment will have the opportunit y to 
move into the Extension Phase o f the Treatm ent Period. The subject may remain on 
treatm ent for approximately 2 years or more from date of C1D1 at the Invest igator ’s 
discreti on until a determinat ion shows a value < 1.5 g/dL hemoglobin increase from the 
baseline value (absent ofbleeding or infect ion), there is recei pt of  anRBC transfusio n, 
disease progressi on,or any o fthe other cri teria for treatm ent discont inuat ionare met .  
If,at the Day  169 Disease Response Assessment, the subject has ≥3 determinat ions showing

42 
days apart (and no determinat ion <1.5 g/dL above the baseline value) in the absence of RBC 
transfusio ns over the preceding 56 days, the subject may cont inue on in the Extensio n Phase 
of the Treatm ent P eriod f or an addi tional 28 days. If,after this addi tional 28 days ,the 
subject meets the response criteria ,the subject can continue on in the Extensio n Phase of the 
Treatment Period and remain on treatment for approximately 2 years or morefrom the C1D1

Cohorts 2 (RBC -transfusion dependent) and 3B 
Subjects who are transfusio n-free over ≥ 84 consecutive days at the time of the Day 169 
Disease Response Assessment can enter the Extension Phase o f the Treatm ent Peri od and 
remain on treatm ent for approximately 2 years or morefrom the C1D1 date at the 
Invest igator ’s discret ion unt il they receive the next RBC transfusio n (absent of bleeding or

On days when subjects return to the invest igational si te for luspatercept administration, but 
luspatercept is not administered ( eg, due to protocol dose modi fication, dose delay rules 
[Secti on7.3]), all required assessments and procedures should be performed, regardless if 
luspatercept is administered. During the time period of dose delay, the fo llowing 
assessments/procedures should be performed:
If dose delay is due to a laboratory  or vi tal signs abnorm ality, the assessment that was the 
reason for the dose delay  should be repeated at least on a weekly basis.
If dose delay is due to increased Hgb level, perf orm hematol ogy assessments at least 
weekly.
If dose delay is due to an AE, perform hematology, serum chemistry , and serum ferrit in 
assessments at least every  3 weeks thereafter and before next dose ad ministration. 
Pharmacokinet ic (PK)/ADA samples should be collected on the first day of dose delay 
and prior to luspatercept administration on day dosing resumes.
Refer to the eCRF completion gui delines for detailed instructions related to eCRF data entry .
6.4. End of Treatment Visit 
An end of treatment (EOT) evaluat ion will be performed as soon as possible for subjects who are

7.1. Description of Investigational Product(s)
Luspatercept will be provided by the Sponsor. Luspatercept for injection is formulated as a 
sterile, preservat ive-free, ly ophilized cak e/powder.  Luspatercept for injection is available in 25 
mg and 75 mg vials and when reconst ituted, each consists of 50 mg/mL luspatercept in a  mM 
citrate buffer -based so lution (  mM citrate, pH % sucrose, % polysorbate 80).  
The recommended storage condi tion for luspatercept for inject ion (25 m g/vial  and 75 m g/vial; 
lyophilized powder form ulation) is 2°Cto 8°C.  Reconst ituted luspatercept in its original 
container closure system may  be held for up to 10 hours at 2°C to 8°C, however it shoul d be 
administered at room temperature. It is recommended that the reconstituted luspatercept for 
inject ion be used immediately. If not used immediately, the total in- use t ime of the reconstituted 
luspatercept for inject ion, fro m reconst itution to adminis tration, m ust not exceed 10 hours.  
Samples o f luspatercept drug product, held at the recommended storage condit ion, have been 
shown to be stable through the labeled shelf -life.
Subjects enrolled in Cohort 3 are receiving ruxolitinib as prescribed by thei r physician .  Cel gene 
will not be supplying ruxo litinib for this study.   Instead, ruxolit inib willbe obtai ned by the si tes 
according to local clinical study agreem ent and in accordance with local guidelines .
7.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule
Luspatercept will be administered on Day 1 of every  21-day cycle, at an init ial dose level of 1.0 
mg/kg (*Note for Protocol Amendment 3 : Addit ional subjects enro lling into Cohort 3B will 
begin luspatercept treatment at a starting dose of 1.33 mg/kg and can have their dose increased to 
a maximum  dose of1.75 m g/kg [with the total  dose not to exceed 168 mg]
).  Doses may  be 
titrated up starting in Cycle 3 as described in Section7.3.  Luspatercept will be administered as a 
subcutaneous inject ion to subjects by the study  staff at the clinical site and administration will be 
docum ented in the subject’s source record.  Subj ects m ust have their Hgb, WBC, bl ood 
myelo blast percentage ,and blood pressure assessed prior to each luspatercept administration. 
Subcutaneous inject ions will be given in the upper arm, thigh, and/or abdomen. Calculated doses 
requi ring reconst ituted volu me greater than 1.2 mL should be divided into separate ,similar 
volumeinjections across 2or 3separate sites using the same anatomical locat ion,but on opposite 
sides of  the body  (example l eft thigh and ri ght thi gh). The maximum volume per subcutaneous
inject ion shoul d not exceed 1.2 mL . The inject ion sites can be rotated according to Invest igator 
judgment, and the inject ions can be given in the following order as needed, for example: 1) right 
upper arm, 2) left upper arm, 3) right upper thigh, 4) left upper thigh.

For all cohorts : subject has ≥1 RBC transfusio n event (for pretransfusio n Hgb of ≤ 
9.5 g/dL) during the 2 most recent prior treatment cy cles (~6 weeks)
For all cohorts :  Hemoglobin decrease of ≥ 1 g/dL is observed and this decrease is 
not preceded by  an RBC transfusio n (the hemoglo bin decrease occurs ≥ 14 days after 
the last RBC transfusio n)
For subjects in Cohorts 1 and 3A :
Hemoglobin increase fro m baseline is < 1.5 
g/dL throughout the previous 2cycles at the same dose level
For subjects in Cohorts 1 and 3A : Hemoglobin increase fro m baseline is ≥1.5 g/dL 
but not sustained for at least 2consecut ive study  measurements during the previous 2
cycles at the sam e dose l evel 
For subjects in Cohorts 2 and 3B : Hgb value is not exceeding 1 g/dL increase from 
the baseline mean pretransfusio n Hgb value , which will be calculated using the 
reported RBC transfusio ns that confirmed the eligibilit y of the subject
The dose level should be titrated individually for each subject .

Confident ial and Propri etary 70 ACE -536-MF-001 Amendment 4Final : 19 Feb 20207.5. Method of Treatment Assignment 
The cohort assignment will occur at the end of the Screening Period, once all the required 
screen ing procedures have been co mpleted and all required data have been submitted to the 
Sponsor or i ts authori zed representative.  Upon receiving acknowledgment of subject’s eligibilit y
review from the Sponsor or its authorized representative, the subject can be assigned treatment 
using an IRT built for this study . 
Designated research personnel at each invest igational site will be assigned unique, password-
protected user accounts which give them the authorizat ion to utilize the IRT to enroll subjects.  
For dru g assignment, dose reduction or titrations, site staff must contact the IRT to record the 
new dose l evel and obtain the new study  treatm ent assignment.
7.6. Packaging and Labeling
The l abel(s) for luspatercept will include S ponsor name, address and telephone nu mber, the 
protocol  number, luspatercept name, dosage form and strength (where applicable), amount of 
luspatercept per con tainer, l ot number, expi ry date (where applicable), medication 
ident ificat ion/kit number, dosing instructions, storage condit ions, and requi red caut ion 
statements and/or regulatory  statem ents as applicable. Addit ional informat ion may be included 
on the l abel as applicable per local regulati ons.
7.7. Investigational Product Accountability and Disposal 
Accountabilit y for luspatercept that is administered during the course of the study  is the 
responsibilit y of the Investigator or designee.  Investigat ional clinical supplies must be received 
by a designated person at the clinical site and kept in a secure and temperature -controlled 
location.  Th e invest igational site must maintain accurate records demonstrating dates and 
amounts of luspatercept received, to whom it was administered (subject -by-subject accounting), 
and accounts of any luspatercept accidentally or deliberately destroyed or returned .  Accurate 
recording of all luspatercept administration will be made in the appropriate section of the 
subject’s eCRF and source documents.  Unless otherwise notified, all vials of luspatercept , both 
used and unused, must be saved for drug accountabilit y.  The used vials may be discarded, per 
the inst itution’s standard practice, after drug accountabilit y has been completed by  the m onitor.  
The Investigator must return all unused vials of luspatercept to the Sponsor at the end of the 
study , or luspatercept may be destroy ed at the clinical site wit h the permissio n of the Sponsor.  
For ei ther scenario, the outcome must be documented on the drug accountabilit y log.  The 
Sponsor will provide direct ion for the outcome of all unused vials.
Celgene (or desi gnee) wi ll review wit h the Invest igator and relevant site personnel the process 
for invest igational product return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilit ies for the 
site versus Celgene (or designee).
7.8. Investigational Product Compliance
Luspatercept will be administered as a subcutaneous inject ion at the clinical site by the study  
staff.  Monitoring for subject compliance with the treatment regimen is therefore unnecessary.
Accurate recording o f all luspatercept administration will be made in the appro priate secti on of  
the subject’s eCRF and source docum ents.

9.1. Overview
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open -label study to evaluate the effi cacy and safet y of luspatercept
in subjects wi th MPN -associated myelo fibrosis and anemia with and without RBC- transfus ion 
dependence.
The design of the study , including the proposed targeted subject populat ion, study  endpoints, and 
statist ical plan, is discussed below.
9.2. Study Population Definitions
Subjects will be enro lled to provide approximately 100ITTsubjects in this study , denoted by  the 
following cohorts:   
Cohort 1 (anemia only) :
Approximately  20subjects ,but no l ess than 14 efficacy  evaluable subjects ,with MPN -
associ ated myel ofibrosis who are RBC -transfusio n independent (no RBC transfusio ns wi thin 
at least 84 days immediately up to the C1D1 date) with anemia will be enro lled in Cohort 1 
and receive luspatercept at a starting dose levelof 1.0 m g/kg (subcutaneous inject ion on Day  
1 of a 21- day treatment cy cle) for up to 8 cy cles (or up through Day  168 in the event of dose 
delays).  Shoul d subjects meet the clinical benefit definit ion, they  may continue treatment for 
approximately 2 years or morefrom the C1D1 date following the Day  169 Disease Response 
Assessment.   
Cohort 2 (RBC -transfusion dependent ):
Approximately 20 subjects wi th MPN -associ ated myel ofibrosis and an average RBC-
transfusio n burden o f 2to 4RBC units /28 days (calculated from the 84 -day period 
immediately  up to the C1D1 date ) will be enro lled in Cohort 2 and receive luspatercept at a 
starting dose level of 1.0 m g/kg (subcutaneous injection on Day  1 of a 21 -day treatm ent 
cycle) for up to 8 cy cles (or up through Day  168 in the event of dose delays).  Shoul d 
subjects meet the clinical benefit definit ion, they  may cont inue treatment for approximately 2 
years or more, from the C1D1 date following the Day 169 Disease Response Assessment.   
Cohort 3 (subjects on ruxolitinib as part of their standard -of-care therapy):
Approximately 60subjects will be enro lled in Cohort 3 who must be on a stabl e dose of 
ruxolitinib for at least 112 day s(16 weeks) immediately up to the enro llment date .Effective 
from Protocol  Amendment 3, theadditional subjects enrolled into Cohort 3Bmust also have 
a minimum prior treatment with ruxolit inib per their local standard -of-care for at l east 280 
days (40 weeks) without i nterrupti ons exceeding 2 consecut ive weeks leading up to the date 
of enro llment.   These subjects will receive luspatercept at a starting dose level of 1.0 m g/kg 
(subcutaneous injection on Day  1 of a 21 -day treatment cy cle) for up to 8 cycles (or up 
through Day  168 in the event of dose delays) *Note for Protocol Amendment 3 :Addit ional 
subjects enrolling into Cohort 3B will be gin luspatercept treatment at a starting dose of 1.33 
mg/kg and can have their dose increased to a maximum dose of 1.75 mg/kg (with the total 
dose not to exceed 168 mg).  Should subjects meet the clinical response definit ion, they  may

Respon se Assessment.
Study  popul ations to be analyzed are defined as fo llows:
Intent -to-treat (ITT) Population: 
The intent -to-treat (ITT) populat ion will consist of all enrolled subjects regardless of whether or 
not the subject received luspatercept.  Efficacy analyses will be conducted primarily on the ITT 
popul ation.  
Efficacy E valuable (EE) Population :
A subject who meets all the inclusio n/exclusio n criteri a will be considered “efficacy evaluable” 
upon receiving ≥ 3 cycles of luspatercept and remain in the study  for ≥ 21 day s following the 
third dose of l uspatercept.  Subj ects who attain Hgb values > 13 g/dL in < 3 cycles will also be 
considered effi cacy evaluable.   Subjects not considered “efficacy evaluable” are in general those 
that receive < 3 cy cles of luspatercept in which luspatercept is held or discont inued or who 
receive < 3 cy cles due to a treatm ent-emergent adverse event (TEAE) or discont inued treatment 
for any  other reason.
Subjects will become nonefficacy evaluable in certain cases ( eg, prohibited conco mitant 
medicat ion/swas/were used during the study ).  Subjects specifically  in Cohort 3 beco me 
noneff icacy evaluable in certain cases (eg, the ruxolit inib dose was m odified during the study ).  
The study  steering co mmittee willreview the allocation of all subjects to the EE populat ion.  
Efficacy analyses will be conducted based on the ITT and EE populat ions.  
Safety Population : 
The Safet y Popul ation will consist of all subjects who were enrolled and received at least 1dose 
of luspatercept . 
Statistical methods to handle missing data will be described in the statist ical analysis plan (SAP).
The SAP will describe any  predefined rul es for including/excluding any subjects with data from 
any analyses ( eg, time windows, visit by  visit analysis, endpoint analysis, protocol vio lation).  
9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations
The Sponsor estimates that out of 20 enrolled subjects in Cohort 1 , at least 14 will beco me 
efficacy  evaluable.  
For Cohort 1, the probabilit y of observing no responses amo ng 14 subjects is less than 0.05 if the 
response probabilit y is greater than 20%. If no responses are o bserved in the first 14 evaluable 
subjects, the trial is stopped because it can be concluded that the response rate for the primary 
endpo int is less than 20% in Cohort 1.  
For Cohort 2, the probabilit y of observing no responses amo ng 14 subjects is less t han 0.05 if the 
response probabilit y is greater than 20%.  If no responses are observed in the first 14 evaluable 
subjects, enrollment in this cohort will be stopped because it can be concluded that the response 
rate for the primary endpo int is less than 2 0% in Cohort 2.

less than 0.05 if the true response probabilit y were greater th an 20%, while 46 subjects in Cohort 
3B woul d provi de for 80% power to detect a 15% increase in response rate for luspatercept over 
a null response rate of 17%. This assumes a one -sided z test of a bino mial proporti on (wi th a 5% 
significance l evel). 
9.4. Backg round and Demographic Characteristics
Subjects’ age, height, weight, and baseline characterist ics will be summarized using descript ive 
statist ics, while gender, race ,and other categorical variables will be provided using frequency 
tabul ations by dose coho rt.  Prior transfusio n history  will be summarized.  Medical history  data 
will be summarized using frequency tabulat ions by the Medical Dict ionary for Regul atory  
Activities(MedDRA) system  organ cl ass and preferred term.  Myeloproliferat ive neoplasm 
(MPN)-associated myelofibrosis diagnoses as well as RBC transfusio n dependence will be 
summarized using frequency  tabulat ions.
9.5. Subject Disposition
Subject disposit ion (analysis population allocat ion, entered, di scont inued, along wit h primary  
reason for discont inuat ion) will be summarized using frequency and percent for both treatment 
and fo llow-up phases.  A summary  of subjects enrolled by site will be provided.  Protocol 
deviat ions will be summarized using frequency tabulat ions.
9.6. Efficacy Analysis
Efficacy analyses will be primarily  conducted in the ITT populat ion, and confirmatory  analyse s
will be conducted in the EE populat ion.  Stati stical analyses will be primarily descript ive in 
nature since the goal of the study  is to establish efficacy and safet y of luspatercept for further 
investigat ion.  The results will be presented by cohort that subject is assigned to.   Subjects in 
Cohorts 3A and 3B will be summarized separately.   
9.6.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary  efficacy  endpoint i s the proporti on of  subjects that achieved anemia response as 
defined below: 
Cohort s1 (anemia only )and 3A : 
Proporti on of  subjects achieving ≥1.5 g/dL hemoglo bin increa se fro m baseline over any  
consecut ive 84 -day period wi thout an RBC transfusion fro m Day 1 up through and including 
Day 168. This 84- day period will  begin as soon as the ≥1.5 g/dL hemoglobin increase is 
detected.  There must be ≥ 3 determinat ions of ≥1.5g/dL hemoglobin increase from baseline
in this interval wit h no value showing a < 1.5 g/dL hemoglobin increase from baseline and
no 2 measurements are ≥ 42 day s apart.
Cohort s2 (RBC -transfusion dependent )and 3B : 
Proporti on of  subjects who beco me RBC -transfusion free over any consecutive 84 -day 
period from Day 1 up through and including Day 168.  This 84- day period will begin from  
the date of the prior RBC transfusion that is given for a Hgb value ≤9.5 g/dL.

Response rate will be calculated using the number of responders divided by number of subjects 
in the ITT populat ion (responders plus nonresponders ).
Anemia response rate ,together with a 95% confidence interval ,will be calculated for each 
cohort. 
9.6.2. Secondary Efficacy Analys es 
Time to anemia response will be summarized only  for subjects who achieved anemia response.
It is defined as time fro m first dose to first onset of anemia response, calculated fro m Day 1 
through and including Day  168. 
Duration of anemia response will be summarized only for subjects who achieved anemia 
response. It is defined as maximum durat ion of modified anemia response , calculated from Day 
1 through end of treatm ent.
Frequency of RBC transfusions will be assessed for Cohort 2 subjects and RBC -transfusio n 
dependent subjects in Cohort 3B.  It is defined as the mean number of RBC unit stransfused per 
subject per 28 days .It will be calculated from Day 1 through and including Day  168 and Day 1 
through end of treatm ent. 
Frequency of RBC -transfusion dependence will be assessed for Cohort 2 subjects and RBC
-
transfusio n dependent subjects in Cohort 3B. It is defined as the proporti on of  subjects who 
reduce thei r transfusio n burden by  ≥ 50% from baseline over any consecutive 84 -day period. It 
will be calculated from Day 1 through and including Day  168 and Day  1 through end of 
treatment. 
Symptoms response improvement will be assessed using the proporti on of  subjects who 
achieve ≥50% reduction in fatigue symptom as measure dby the MPN -SAF TSS , calculated fro m 
Day 1 through and including Day  168 and Day  1 through end of treatm ent.  The proportion of 
subjects who achieve ≥50% reduction in total symptom score (TSS) will also calculated.
Health -related quality of life (H
RQoL) will be assessed via the mean changes in domain scores 
over the study compared to baseline using the FACT -An and EQ-5D- 5L, cal culated fro m Day 1 
through an d including Day  168 and Day 1 through end of treatm ent.  Various schemes will be 
assessed for missing data imputation if needed.  
Changes in hemoglobin will be assessed for Coh orts1 and 3A subjects over the study  com pared 
to baseline in the absence of RB C transfusio ns, calcul ated fro m Day 1 through and including 
Day 168 and Day 1 through end of treatment.  
Mean hemoglobin increase of ≥ 1.5 g/dL fro m baseline over any  consecut ive 84 -day period 
without an RBC transfusio n will be assessed for Cohort s1 and 3A subjects, calculated fro m Day 
1 through and including Day  168 and Day  1 through end of treatment .  Duration of anemia 
response may be est imated using Kaplan -Meier methods. Point estimates and 95% confidence

Physical ex aminat ion data and vital sign measurements, including body  weight, will be 
listed for each subject at each visit.  Descript ive statist ics for vital signs, both observed 
values and changes fro m baseline, will be summarized by  cohort.
Graphical displays will be provided where useful to assist in the interpretation of results.
9.8. Timing of Analyses 
9.8.1. Interim Analysis 
No formal interim analysis is planned for the study.  Once the last subject completes or 
discontinues the Primary Phase of the Treatment Period, top -line results on efficacy and safet y 
endpo ints will be generated.   
9.8.2. Final Analysis 
The final analysis will be performed when all subjects have completed or discont inued the 
Treatment Period.  Addit ional follow-up analyses will be performed when subjects c omplete the 
Long -term Fo llow

10.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
An AE is any  noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen 
in a subject during the course of a stu dy.It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening 
concomitant illness, an injury , or any  concomi tant impai rment of  the subject’s healt h, including 
laboratory  test val ues (as specified by  the cri teria in Secti on 10.3), regardl ess of eti ology. Any 
worsening (ie, any  clinically significant adverse change in the frequency  or intensi ty of a pre -
exist ing condit ion) should be considered an AE.  A diagnosis or syndro me should be recorded on 
the AE page of the eCRF rather than the individual signs or s ymptoms o f the diagnosis or 
syndro me. 
Abuse, wi thdrawal , sensi tivity or toxi city to an investi gational product shoul d be reported as an 
AE. Overdose, accidental or intent ional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be 
reported on the overdose eCRF (See Secti on 7.2for the definit ion of overdose) .Any sequela of 
an accidental or intent ional overdose of an investigational product should b e reported as an AE 
on the AE eCRF .If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on 
an SAE report form and on the AE eCRF .The overdose result ing in the SAE should be 
ident ified as the cause of the event on the SAE report fo rm and eCRF but should not be reported 
as an SAE i tself.
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive 
supportive measures as necessary .  There i s no known specific ant idote for luspatercept
overdose. Actual treatm ent shoul d depend on the severit y of the clinical situat ion and the 
judgment and experience o f the treati ng physician.
All subjects will be mo nitored for AEs during the study .  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all o f the following param eters: the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory , 
pathol ogical, radi ological or surgical  findings, physical examinat ion findings, or findings from 
other tests and/or procedures.
All AEs (including serious adverse events [SAEs]), regardless of causal relati onship to 
luspatercept, will be recorded by  the Invest igator from the time the subject signs informed 
consent until 42 days after the last dose of luspatercept.  After the 42 -Day Follow -up Peri od, 
only those seri ous adverse events (SAEs) made known to the Invest igator that are suspected of 
being related to luspatercept will be recorded by  the Invest igator.
Adverse events ( AEs) and SAEs will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF and in the 
subject ’s source documents.  All SAEs m ust be reported to Celgene Dr ug Safet y within 24 hours 
of the Invest igator’s knowledge o f the event by  facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
10.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified Investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to:

Confident ial and Propri etary 81 ACE -536-MF-001 Amendment 4Final : 19 Feb 2020Results in death;
Is life -threatening (i e, in the opinio n of the Invest igator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death fro m the AE);
Requi res inpat ient hospi talizat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizati on 
(hospi talizat ion is defined as an inpatient admissio n, regardl ess of l ength of stay );
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y (a substant ial disrupt ion of the 
subject’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions);
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect;
Const itutes an important medical event.
Important m edical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately  life-
threatening or result in death, hospitalizat ion, or disabilit y, but may  jeopardi ze the subject or 
requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizatio ns for:
astandard procedure for protocol therapy administration.  However, hospitalizat ion or 
prolonged hospitalizat ion for a com plicat ion of therapy  administrati on will be 
reported as an SAE. 
routine treatm ent or m onitoring of the studi ed indicati on not associ ated wi th any 
deteri oration in condit ion.
the administration o f blood or pl atelet transfusio n as routine treatment of studied 
indicat ion.  However, hospitalizat ion or prolonged hospitalization for a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
aprocedure for protocol/disease -related invest igations ( eg, surgery , scans, endoscopy , 
sampling for laboratory  tests, bone m arrow sam pling).  However, hospitalizat ion or 
prolonged hospitalizat ion for a com plicat ion of such procedures remains a reportable 
SAE.
hospitalizati on or prol ongati on of  hospi talizati on for technical , practical , or s ocial 
reasons, in absence of an AE.
aprocedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to start of treatment on study); must be 
docum ented in the source document and the eCRF .  Hospi talizati on or prol onged 
hospi talizati on for a com plicati on remains a reportable SAE.
an elect ive treatment of or an elect ive procedure for a pre -exist ing condit ion, 
unrelated to the studied indicat ion, that ha s not worsened fro m baseline. 
emergency outpatient treatment or observat ion that does not result in admissio n, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.
If an AE i s considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.

Confident ial and Propri etary 82 ACE -536-MF-001 Amendment 4Final : 19 Feb 2020For each SAE, the Invest igator will provide information on severit y, start and stop dates, 
relationship to the luspatercept , acti on taken regarding the luspatercept , and outcome.
10.2.2. Severity/Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the Invest igator must assess the severit y/intensity of the event. 
The severi ty/intensi ty of AEs will  be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to the 
current active minor versio n of the Commo n Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, 
version 4.03);
https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html
Adverse events ( AEs)that are not defined in the CTCAE should be evaluated for 
severit y/intensity according to the following scale:
Grade 1 = Mild –transi ent or mild disco mfort; no limitat ion in act ivity; no m edical 
intervent ion/therapy  requi red
Grade 2 = Moderate –mild to moderate limitat ion in activity, som e assistance may  be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervent ion/therapy  required
Grade 3 = Severe –marked limitat ion in act ivity, som e assistance usually req uired; 
medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalizatio n is possible
Grade 4 =Life-threatening – extreme limitation in activit y, significant assistance 
requi red; significant medical intervent ion/therapy  requi red, hospi talizat ion or hospice 
care proba ble
Grade 5 =Death 
-the event results in death
The term  “severe” is often used to describe the intensit y of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarct ion); the event itself, however, may be of relat ively minor medical 
significanc e (such as severe headache).  This criterio n is notthe same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associ ated wi th events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or funct ioning.  
Seriousness, not severit y, serves as a gui de for defining regul atory  obligat ions.
10.2.3. Causality
The Investigator must determine the relat ionship between the administration o f luspatercept and 
the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: a causal relat ionship of the adverse event to luspatercept
administration is unlikely or remote , or other m edicat ions, 
therapeuti c intervent ions, or underlying condit ions provide a 
sufficient explanat ion for the observed event.
Suspected: there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of 
luspatercept caused the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibilit y’ 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship between 
the luspatercept and the adverse event.

If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or addit ional 
luspatercept that has not bee n manufactured or provided by  Celgene, pl ease provi de the name of 
the manufacturer when reporting the event.
10.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the Invest igator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.
10.2.5. Action Taken
The Investigator will report the action taken with luspatercept as a result of an AE or SAE, as 
applicable ( eg, discont inuat ion, interruption, or dose reduction of luspatercept , as appropriate) 
and report if conco mitant and/or addit ional treatm ents were given for the event. 
10.2.6. O utcome
The Investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discont inuatio n of the subject’s participat ion in the study  
must be fo llowed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with seq uelae, or death (due to 
the SAE ).
10.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest
The occurrence of a new malignancy  or prem alignant lesio n will be monitored as an event of 
special interest and shoul d be included as part of the assessment of adverse events throughout t he 
course of the study . Invest igators are to report the development of any new malignancy or 
prem alignant l esion as a seri ous adverse event, regardless of causal relat ionship to IP, occurring 
at any  time for the duration of the study , from the time of sig ning the ICF up to and including at 
least 5 years fo llowing the date of first dose of IP or 3 yearspost last dose of IP of the 
Posttreatm ent Follow -up Peri od, whi chever occurs later .
Events of new malignancy  and premalignant l esions(excluding benign tumo rs or benign 
neopl asia) are to be reported within 24 hours of the Invest igator’s knowledge of the event by fax, 
or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, and must be considered an “Important 
Medical Event” even if no other serious criteria ap ply; these events must also be documented in 
the appropriate page(s) of the eCRF and subject’s source documents. Documentation of the 
diagnosed m alignancy must be provided at the time of reporting as a serious adverse event ( eg, 
any confirmatory  histol ogy or cy tology resul ts, x-rays, computed tom ography  [CT]scans, etc.).
Malignancies or cancerous tumors are lesio nscapable of invading into adjacent tissues and may 
be capable of spreading to distant tissues.  A benign tumor has none of those properties.
Malignancy  or cancer is characterized by anaplasia, invasiveness, and metastasis.  For MPN -
associ ated myelo fibrosis studies, these also include transformat ion to bl ast phase , 
myeloproliferat ion (eg, clinically significant increase s in blasts), etc.

Confident ial and Propri etary 84 ACE -536-MF-001 Amendment 4Final : 19 Feb 2020Prem alignant or precancerous lesio ns refer to a state of disordered morpho logy of cells that i s 
associ ated wi th an increased ri sk of cancer.  If left untreated, these condit ions may lead to 
cancer.  Such condit ions are usually eit her dy splasia or benign neoplasia (and the dividing line 
between those is so metimes blurry).  Somet imes the term "precancer" is used to describe 
carcino ma in situ, whi ch is a noninvasive cancer that has not progressed to an aggressive, 
invasive stage.  Not all ca rcino ma in situ will  progress to invasive disease.
Prem alignant l esions are m orphol ogically at ypical ti ssue which appears abnormal under 
microscopic examinat ion and in which cancer is more likely to occur than in its apparent ly 
norm al counterpart.
10.4. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory  value is considered to be an AE ifthe abnorm ality:
resul ts in discont inuat ion from the study;
requi res treatm ent, m odificat ion/ interruption of luspatercept dose, or any other 
therapeuti c intervent ion; or
is judged to be of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease 
process and/or organ toxicit y, or is an exacerbat ion or worsening of an exist ing 
condi tion.
Regardless of severit y grade, only  laboratory  abnorm alities that fulfill a seriousn ess cri terion 
need to be document ed as a serious adverse event.
If a laboratory  abnorm ality is one com ponent of a di agnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF .  If the abnormalit y was not 
a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory  abnorm ality should be recorded as the AE. 
If possible, the laboratory  abnorm ality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply  as an 
abnorm al laboratory  resul t (eg,record thrombocy topeni a rather than decreased platelets).
10.5. Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in eit her a female subject of childbearing 
potenti al or partner of childbearing potential of a male subject are immediately reportable e vents .  
10.5.1. Females of Childbearing Potential:
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated β-hCG or posi tive pregnancy test in a 
female subject of childbearing potential regardless of disease state) occurring while the subject is 
on luspatercept , or wi thin 12 weeks of the subject ’s last dose of luspatercept , are considered 
immediately  reportabl e events.  Luspatercept is to be discont inued immediately . The pregnancy , 
suspected pregnancy , or posi tive pregnancy  test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y 
immediately  by email , phone or facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy  
Initial Report Form , or approved equivalent form.  
The female subject may be referred to an obstetrician- gyneco logist or another appropriate

related to the in utero exposure to the luspatercept shoul d also be reported to Celgene Drug 
Safety by facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Invest igator’s 
knowl edge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form .
10.5.2. Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject taking luspatercept beco mes pregnant, the male subject 
taking luspatercept shoul d notify  the Invest igator, and the pregnant female partner should be 
advised to call their healt hcare provider immediately.   
Males will be advised to use a latex condo m during any  sexual  contact wi th FCBP pri or to study  
entry  and cont inue for 12 weeks following the last dose of luspatercept , even if he has undergone 
a successful vasectomy .
10.6. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the complet ion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF .  All SAEs must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safet y and Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the Invest igator’s knowledge of 
the event by  facsimile, or other appropriate method ( eg, via email), using the SAE Report Form, 
or approved equivalent form.  This instruction pertains to init ial SAE reports as well as any  
follow-up reports.
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms are accurate and consistent.   
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relat ionship to luspatercept ) that occur during 
the study  (from the time the subject signs informed consent until 42 days after the la st dose of 
luspatercept) or any  SAE m ade known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that are 
suspected of being related to luspatercept .  Seri ous adverse events occurring prior to treatment 
(after signing the ICF) will be captured.
The SAE report sho uld provide a detailed descript ion of the SAE and include a concise summary 
of hospi tal records and other relevant documents.  If a subject died and an autopsy  has been 
perform ed, copi es of  the autopsy  report and death certificate are to be sent to Celgene Drug 
Safety as soon as these beco me available.  Any fo llow-up data should be detailed in a subsequent 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Celgene Drug Safet y.  
Where required by  local legislat ion, the Invest igator is responsible for informing the Inst itutional 
Review Board/Ethics Co mmittee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them wit h all relevant

10.7. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events
For the purpose of regulatory  reporting, Cel gene Drug Safet y will determine the expectedness of 
events suspected of being related to luspatercept based on the IB.
In the United States, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be 
reported in an expedited manner in accordance wit h 21 CFR 312.32.
For countri es wi thin the European Economic Area (EEA), Celgene or its authorized 
representative wi ll report in an expedited manner to Regulatory  Authori ties and Ethi cs 
Committees concerned, SUSARs in accordance with Direct ive 2001/20/EC and the Detailed 
Guidance on collect ion, verificat ion and presentation of adverse react ion reports arising from 
clinical tri als on invest igational products for human use (ENTR/CT3) and also in accordance 
with country -specific requirements.
Celgene or i ts authori zed representative shall notify  the Invest igator of the fo llowing 
inform ation:
Any AE suspected of being rela ted to the use of luspatercept in this study  or in other 
studi es that i s both seri ous and unexpected (i e, SUSAR);
Any finding fro m tests i n laboratory  animals that suggests a significant risk for 
human subjects including reports of mutagenicit y, teratogeni city, or carcinogenicit y.
Where required by  local legislat ion, the Invest igator shall notify his/her IRB/EC promptly o f 
these new serious and unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to subjects.
The Investigator must keep copies of all pert inent safet y infor mation on file including 
correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/EC.  (See Section 14.3 for record retention 
inform ation).

will be addressed by  the Celgene Safet y Management Team and will be brought to the attention 
of the Study  Steeri ng Co mmittee.
Excessive toxicit yin the context of this study is defined as a rate of treatm ent-emergent Grade 3 
or above serious adverse event sassessed by invest igator or Celgene as related to l uspatercept of 
20% or higher . 
If the posterior probabilit y of the toxi city rate exceeding 20% i s greater than 0.8, then further 
subject enrollment will be put on ho ld and afte r assessment of the findings by the Celgene Safet y 
Management Team and the Study  Steering Committee study  treatm ent for all  ongoing subjects 
receiving luspatercept might be stopped early. 
For the subject on ongoing treatment and addit ional enrollment of subjects into Cohort 3B the 
following stopping rule will apply, accounting for the subjects already enrolled in the study . This 
assumes a relat ively weak prior distribut ionof Beta ( 1/3, 1/3 ) for toxicit y rate, whi ch will  allow 
the accruing data on toxicit ies to dominate. This prior is also ‘neutral’ in the sense that the 
maximum likelihood estimate of toxicit y rate is approximately  at the posteri or median ( Kerman,

commencement. The Invest igator will conduct all aspects of this study  in accordance with 
applicable nat ional, state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory  authori ties.
13.2. Investigator Responsibilities
Invest igator responsibilit ies are set out in the ICH Guideline for GCP and in the local 
regul ations.  Celgene s taff or an authori zed representative will evaluate and approve all 
Invest igators who in turn will select their staff.
The Investigator should ensure that all persons assisting wit h the study  are adequately  informed 
about the protocol, amendments, study  treatments, as well as study -related duti es and funct ions, 
including obligat ions of confident iality of Celgene informat ion. The Investigator should 
maintain a list of Sub -invest igators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she 
has delegated significant study -related duti es.
The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all subjects who sign an informed consent 
form (ICF) and are screened for entry  into the study .  Subjects who fail  screening m ust have the 
reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents.
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow dire ct access to subject records ( eg, 
medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study -related charts) for source data 
verification.  The Invest igator must ensure timely and accurate complet ion of eCRF s and queri es.
The informat ion contained in the protocol and amendments (with the except ion of the

for com pliance wi th applicable governmen t regul ations with respect to current GCP and SOPs .
15.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after 
the study .  All aspects of the study  are reviewed with the Inves tigator and the staff at a study  
initiation visit and/or at an Invest igators’ Meeting.  Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a 
Celgene representati ve will review the protocol, eCRF s, procedures for ob taining informed 
consent, record keeping, and rep orting of AEs/SAEs with the Invest igator.  Monitoring will 
include on -site visi ts with the Investi gator and his/her staff as well as any  appropri ate 
communicat ions by mail, email, fax, or telephone.  During mo nitoring visits, the facilit ies, 
investigat ional product storage area, eCRF s, subject’s source documents, and all other study  
docum entati on will be inspected/reviewed by  the Cel gene representati ve in accordance wit h the 
Study  Moni toring Pl an.
Accuracy  will be checked by performing source data verificat ion that i s a di rect com parison of 
the entries made onto the eCRF s against the appropriate source documentation.  Any  resul ting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary 
correcti ons will be made direct ly to t he eCRF s or via queries by the Invest igator and/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusio n/exclusion 
criteria and docum entati on of  SAEs and their proper recording be verified.  Addit ional 
monitoring act ivities may be outlined in a study -specific m onitoring pl an.
15.2. Audits and Inspections
In addit ion to the routine monitoring procedures, a Good Clinical Pract ice Qualit y Assurance 
unit exists wit hin Celgene.  Representatives of this unit will conduct audi ts of clinical research 
activit ies in accordance with Cel gene SOPs to evaluate compliance wit h Good Clinical Pract ice 
guidelines and regulations.
The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilit ies where the study  took place, 
source documents, eCRF s and applicable supporting records of study  subject parti cipat ion for 
audits and inspect ions by IRB/ ECs, regul atory  authori ties (eg, FDA, EMA, Healt h Canada) and 
company authorized representatives.  The Invest igator shoul d make every  effort to be available 
for the audi ts and/or inspect ions.  If the Investigator is contacted by  any regulatory  authori ty 
regarding an inspect ion, he/she shou ld contact Celgene immediately.
15.3. Product Quality Complaint
A Product Qualit y Complaint (PQC) i s any  written, el ectroni c, or oral  communicati on that 
alleges deficiencies related to the ident ity, qualit y, durabilit y, reliabilit y, safet y, effect iveness, 
purity, or perform ance of any  drug product m anufactured by  or on behalf of Celgene Corporation 
after it is rel eased for distribut ion.  PQCs may  reduce the usabilit y of the product for its intended 
funct ion or affect performance of the product and therefore pose a significant risk to the subject.  
Examples of PQCs include (but are not limited to): mixed product, mislabeling, lack of effect, 
seal/packaging breach, product missing/short/overage, con taminati on, suspected falsified,

Protocol ACE -536-MF-001 Celgene Corporati on
Confident ial and Propri etary 3 ACE -536-MF-001 Amendment 4Final : 19 Feb 20201. JUSTIFICATION FOR AM ENDMENT
The fo llowing change was made to the protocol as subjects on luspatercept therapy  continue to 
demonstrate clinical benefit while on study  treatmen t in the absence of any  significant safet y 
signals.  To enable long -term access to l uspatercept therapy  (provi ded subjects continue to 
demonstrate clinical benefit as assessed by  the Investi gator and do not m eet any protocol  
treatm ent discont inuat ion criteria), the Extensio n Phase has been extended beyo nd 2years.
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
Prolongation of Extension Phase of the Treatment Period The primary purpose of 
this protocol  amendment is to amend the 2-year study  treatm ent limit for subjects in 
the Extensio n Phase of the Treatment Period to extend beyo nd 2years for those that
continue to receive benefit according to investigator assessment (eg, ≥ 50 % reducti on
of transfusio n burden from baseline) .Revised sections: Protocol Summary , Secti on
3.1, Secti on3.2, Section 6.2.2, Section 6.2.3 , and Secti on9.2The amendment also 
includes several other minor clarifications and corrections: Correction of 
Column Header and diagram text for Figure 2 in Section 3.1: w ording added to 
indicate Treatment Period may  extend past 2years fro m C1D1 date. Clarification 
made to Section 9.2 :text that ment ioned that subjects who are not efficacy evaluable 
will be scored as nonresponders wasremoved . Clarification made to Section 10: 
Removed and consolidated Section 10.6 “Other Malignancies/Premalignancies” with
Secti on 10.3 “Adverse Events of Special Interest” as these sect ions contained 
duplicate informat ionpertaining to “Other Malignancies/Premalignancies .”Added 
Sectio n 15.3 : provided contact informat ion for product qualit y complaints for drug 
products m anufactured by  Celgene Corporation Other addi tional administrative 
changes (ie, spelling, grammat ical error corrections, etc.) were also made throughout 
the docum ent.

Summary  of Changes ACE -536- MF-001 Celgene Corporati on
Confident ial and Propri etary 3 ACE -536-MF-001 Amendment 3 Final: 01 Aug 20191. JUSTIFICATION FOR AM ENDMENT
Significant changes included in the amendment are summarized below.  The following changes 
were m ade to provide a more accurate estimate of the luspatercept treatment effect to enable 
effect ive planning of a future potential Phase 3 study.  
Expansion of C ohort 3 enrollment
Expand total enrollment of Cohort 3B by  approximately 27 subjects for an 
approximate total of 46subjects.   This would result in an approximate total of 60 
subjects in Cohort 3 and an approximate total study  enrollment of 100 subjects.  
Revised sect ions: Protocol  Summary , Secti on 3.1, Secti on 4.1, Section 9.2, 
Secti on 9.3
Modifying Cohort s 2 and 3B inclusion criterion
Update inclusio n criterion to enable subjects with a transfusio n burden defined as 
4 to12 RBC units/84 days, with no in terval > 56 days between RBC transfusio ns

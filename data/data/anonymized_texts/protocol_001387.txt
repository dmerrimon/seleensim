Removed: Post -baseline 28 -day seizure frequency will be calculated as the total 
number of seizures in  the 17 -week DB treatment phase divided by the number of 
days with seizure data, observed or imputed, in the phase, multiplied by 28.  
Baseline 28 -day seizure frequency will be calculated as the total number of 
seizures in the baseline phase divided by the  number of days with seizure data in 
the phase, multiplied by 28.  
 
Replaced with: Post -baseline 28 -day seizure frequency will be calculated as 
the total number of seizures in the 17 -week DB treatment phase divided by the 
number of days with seizure data in  the phase, multiplied by 28. Baseline 28 -
day seizure frequency will be calculated as the total number of seizures in the 
baseline phase divided by the number of days with seizure data in the phase, 
multiplied by 28. If a subject experiences no primary sei zures during the 
baseline phase then the 28 -day seizure frequency in the baseline phase will be 
set to 0.5, equivalent to having 1 seizure during the phase, and 0.5 will be 
added to the 28 -day seizure frequency in the post -baseline phase.  Synopsis (Primary  
Endpoint, Statistical 
Methods), Section 9.13.1.2

continuous spikes and waves during sleep (CSWS), and LGS, and one in 
females with post -partum depression (Study 1042 -PPD -2002).  Enrollment is 
complete for St udy 1042 -0900; however, the study is still ongoing.  Enrollment 
is ongoing for Study 1042 -PPD -2002 and results remain blinded.  
In addition to the company -sponsored studies, 18 subjects were treated with GNX 
in completed studies not sponsored by Marinus.  T hese included 16 subjects who 
received oral GNX doses from 400 mg/day to 1200 mg/day in a smoking cessation 
study.  In addition, one pediatric subject received oral GNX up to 63 mg/kg/day 
under a special access scheme in Australia for treatment of refracto ry seizures 
associated with PCDH19 genetic epilepsy and one pediatric subject received 
intravenous GNX up to a dose of 2880 mg/day in an emergency Investigational 
New Drug (IND) Application to treat super refractory status epilepticus.  
  
Added:  As of 10  Oct 2018, 1557 unique subjects have received treatment with 
GNX in completed company -sponsored clinical trials ranging in duration from 
1 day to more than 2  years, using doses from 50 to 2,000  mg/day. In addition, 
30 subjects received GNX in an ongoing ope n-label Phase 2 study, and an 
estimated 65 subjects received GNX in ongoing Phase 2/3 double -blind studies.  
Of these 1557 unique subjects, 319  healthy subjects have received GNX 
treatment in Phase 1 studies and 1238  subjects have received GNX treatment 
in Phase 2/3 studies. The completed trials include 20 Phase  1 studies in healthy 
subjects and 20  Phase  2/3 studies in adults with epilepsy, children with seizure 
disorders, children with FXS, adults with PTSD and adults with migraine.  
Four company -sponsored clinical studies of GNX are ongoing and have 
enrolled over 200 unique subjects:  
 Study 1042 -0900 in pediatric epilepsies including female pediatric 
subjects with PCDH19 epilepsy and other rare genetic epilepsies 
including CDKL5 deficiency disorder, LGS and  continuous spikes 
and waves during sleep (CSWS)  
 Study 1042 -SE-2001 in adolescents and adults with SE  
 Study 1042 -PPD -2002 in women with PPD (GNX IV and oral capsule

smoking cessation study and 10  subjects who received oral GNX in a 
postmenopausal depre ssion  study.  One pediatric subject received oral GNX 
up to 63 mg/kg/day under a special access scheme in Australia for treatment of 
refractory seizures associated with PCDH19 genetic epilepsy.  In addition, two 
pediatric subjects received GNX in separate emergency INDs to treat super -
refractory status epilepticus: 1 subject received IV GNX up to a dose of 2880 
mg/day and 1  subject received IV GNX infusion up to a dose of 192  mg/day 
and transitioned to a GNX oral suspension dose of 1260  mg/day that was 
tapered over 6  weeks.[SAE Section 5.6 IB]  
Furthermore, 3 non -company -sponsored clinical studies are ongoing. In these 
studies, a total of 7  subjects continue to receive treatment with GNX through 
investigator -initiated INDs following participation in Marinus -sponsored 
studies as follows:  
 In one study, 3 subjects received GNX following participation in 
Study 1042 -0603 of adult subjects with drug -resistant partial -onset 
seizures.  
 In one study, 3 subjects (2 subjects with PCDH19 epilepsy and 1 
subject with LGS) r eceived GNX following participation in 
Study  1042 -0900.  
 In another study, 1 subject with CDD received GNX following participation in 
Study  1042 -0900  
Removed: Most rashes improved either while the drug was continued or following 
discontinuatio n.  Two subjects participating in the Phase  2 study investigating 
GNX in treatment of epilepsy developed a serious adverse event (SAE) of rash.  
Both events resolved after discontinuation of the investigational product.  
 Added:  One of the events was also r eported as an SAE and the event resolved 
after discontinuation of the study drug. In addition, in the ongoing study 1042 -
0900, an additional event of rash was reported as an SAE. There have been no 
cases of Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necroly sis or any other 
clinically important rashes reported in the clinical development program. 
Marinus considers rash as a potential risk associated with GNX and continues 
to monitor the occurrence of this AE in the clinical development program.  Section 1.2  
Added: condition aggravated (10/59 subjects; 16.9%), and upper respiratory

Removed: the standard deviation for the percent change in 28 -day seizure 
frequency for all seizures is estimated to be 28.4, although other relevant data 
suggest the actual standard deviation could be meaningfully higher.  If we assume 
the percent change in 28 -day seizure frequency on GNX minus that on PBO truly to 
be approximately 40%, then a trial with 30 (respectively, 50) biomarker -positive 
PCDH19 -related epilepsy patients randomized in a 1:1 manner will have about 
96% (respectively, 99%) power to detect this effect when using a test statistic that 
preserves a (1 -sided) 2.5% blinded positive error rate.  But if we assume the 
standard deviation to be 40, the n a trial with 30 (respectively, 50) biomarker -
positive PCDH 19 patients randomized in a 1:1 manner will have about 77% 
(respectively, 94%) power to detect this effect.   
 
The threshold for achieving statistical significance in the biomarker -positive cohort  
at the final analysis when 30 (respectively, 50) subjects have completed their 17 -
week DB phase would be an estimate of the difference that is 72% (respectively, 
55.5%) of the standard deviation.  (If the standard deviation is 28.4, then the 
threshold for  statistical significance is approximately 20.5% , (respectively, 
approximately 16%).  If the standard deviation is 40, then the threshold for 
statistical significance is approximately 29%, (respectively, approximately 23%). 
Added: the standard deviation fo r the percent change in 28 -day seizure 
frequency is estimated to be 28.4, although other relevant data suggest the 
actual standard deviation could be meaningfully higher. If we assume the 
standard deviation to be 40 and the percent change in 28 -day seizure  
frequency on GNX minus that on placebo truly to be ꟷ40%, then a trial with 
50 biomarker positive PCDH19 patients randomized in a 1:1 manner will have 
about 94% power to detect this effect when using a test statistic that preserves 
a (one -sided) 2.5% false  positive error rate. The threshold for achieving 
statistical significance in the biomarker positive cohort at the final analysis 
when 50 subjects have completed their 17 -week double -blind phase would be 
an estimate of the difference that is 55.5% of the s tandard deviation.  (If the 
standard deviation is 40, then the threshold for statistical significan ce is 
approximately ꟷ23%).    Section 9.5  
Revised : The Safety and ITT populations comprise all randomized subjects who

Removed: For the pri mary outcome measure, if a subject stops recording 
measurements permanently (anticipated to be zero or minimal in occurrence) prior 
to the end of the 17 -week DB phase, the corresponding median PBO data for the 
missing days will be imputed (irrespective of treatment arm) within each stratum, 
as follows:  
 Compute the median 28 -day seizure frequency in the PBO arm based on all 
available PBO measurements during the 17 -week DB treatment phase.  Label 
that ‘X’ and define ‘A’ to be ‘X’/28, (ie, the daily average on  PBO during the 
17-week during the DB phase).  
 For any days (whether they be on the PBO or GNX arm) that occur AFTER a 
subject has become lost to follow up, impute ‘A’ on that day.  
A conceptually similar imputation approach will be used will be used for the  
secondary outcome measures when a subject stops recording measurements 
permanently prior to the end of the 17 -week DB phase.  
Added: The primary analysis will use all available data. Careful educating 
and monitoring of the study sites will attempt to limit  the amount of missing 
data to nearly zero, but despite these efforts, some missing data may still arise. 
Thus, a sensitivity analysis, in which the missing data will be 
replaced/imputed, will be performed on the primary efficacy endpoint.  Section 9.13.1.1  
Removed: In order to explore the possibility that subjects who stop recording their 
seizure counts tend to have higher seizure counts than the other subjects, the 
imputation method described in the SAP will be modified to use the median of the 5 
highest counts, rather than the median count, among the PBO subjects with data.  
Added: Two sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint of change in 
28-day frequency of the primary seizure types will be performed:  
 
Intermittent (random/sporadic) missing data during the 17 -week DB phase 
and any missing data during the baseline phase will be assumed missing 
completely at random and the collected data will be used to calculate the 28 -
day seizure frequencies. For early drug termination prior to the end of the  17-
week DB phase, caregivers will be instructed to continue to provide daily 
seizure records until the end of the 17 -week DB phase (hence further 
preventing missingness).  
 
In the first sensitivity analysis, the following imputation approach will be used 
for the primary outcome measure when a subject stops recording 
measurements permanently (anticipated to be zero or minimal in occurrence) 
prior to the end of the 17 -week DB phase: for the missing days, the 
corresponding median PBO data will be imputed (irre spective of treatment 
arm), within each stratum, as follows:  
 Compute the median 28 -day seizure frequency in the PBO arm based on all 
available PBO measurements during the 17 -week DB treatment 
phase.   Label that ‘X’, and define ‘A’ to be ‘X’/28, (i.e., the daily average 
on placebo during the 17 -week during the DB phase).  
 For any days (whether they be on the PBO or GNX arm) that occur 
AFTER a subject has become lost to follow up, impute ‘A’ on that day.  
 The second sensitivity analysis will explore the possibi lity that subjects 
who stop recording their seizure counts tend to have higher seizure counts 
than the other subjects. The imputation method described above will be 
modified to use the median of the 5 highest counts, rather than the median 
count, among the  PBO subjects with data.  Section 9.13.3

 Added: As enrollment in the study was discontinued early due to 
administrative reasons, and only 15 biomarker -positive subjects are expected 
to be randomized, the study is not consider ed to have adequate power for 
formal testing of the statistical hypotheses. Since the reason for stopping 
enrollment is external to the study, the statistical analysis will be performed as 
planned. All p -values produced as part of the pre -specified analysi s would 
therefore be considered as nominal.   
  
 Previously: Formal interim analyses are planned, in addition to the final analysis, 
of treatment effect on the primary endpoint, in accordance with the SAP.  Synopsis (Interim 
Analysis) and Section  9.16 
Added : A drug screen (plasma) will be performed to test for THC and CBD at 
screening. If the screening drug test is positive, the subject can be retested, via 
plasma, after two weeks. A drug screen may be performed at any time at 
Investigator’s discretion. A posi tive drug test during the DB phase will result in 
early termination.

4 weeks aft er the taper for safety follow -up post -taper assessments.  Table 2  – footnote j  
   
 Revised : Any subject who completes the study or discontinues IP treatment at any 
time during the study  should undergo a 2 -week drug de -escalation (taper) period.    Sections 3.1 and 6.2.3.3  
Revised: Concomitant medications, other than AEDs , may be reduced or 
discontinued at the discretion of the investigator if medically warranted.

Section  6.2.3.3  for more details). Taper is not required if the subject is receiving 
the dose of 18 mg/kg/day or 450 m g/day (or lower).  
Revised: Any subject who completes the study or discontinues IP treatment at any 
time during the study  should undergo a 2 -week drug de -escalation (taper) period.    Section 6.2.3.3  
Revised : As a generally acc epted guideline, subjects should remain 80% 
compliant with diary entries.  Parents/caregivers who fall short of this standard  
will be re -educated on the importance of adhering to daily seizure, IP and non -
study AED recording and a deviation recorded . Sectio n 6.6  and 7.4.1  
Added: In the event of unforeseen circumstances, in -person study visit 
assessments may not be able to be performed. To conduct the study according 
to protocol while preserving patient safety, operational alternatives such as 
those listed b elow can be employed as long as the site’s actions are in 
compliance with the institution’s IRB/EC policies and regulations.  
 Telemedicine visits (video and/or audio communication methods)  
 In-home visits  
 Local physician visits  
 Use of local and/or off -site laboratories  
 Site-to-patient IP distribution  Section 7. 1 
Revised: A drug screen (plasma) will be performed to test for THC and non -
approved CBD during the DB phase  at Visit 1 (screening) , Visit 2 
(baseline/randomization) , and Visit 5 (final DB/first OL vi sit).  If the screening 
drug test is positive at Visit 1 (screening) , a confirmatory retest, via plasma, will 
be performed after 2 weeks. A drug screen may be performed at any time at 
Investigator’s discretion.    Sections 7.3.2  
Revised: If the subject has  a de novo PCDH19  VUS then the central assessor, PI, 
and Sponsor will review study inclusion.  Some subjects may have multiple 
PCDH19 mutations that include both VUS and pathogenic variants.   In these 
cases, the subject is known to have a pathogenic varian t and is eligible (does 
not require discussion with expert).  Section 7.3.5  
Added: If any test result is unexpectedly out of range, a repeat test can be 
performed at any time as decided by the PI to confirm the initial result.  Section 7.6.5  
Revised: Medication errors are reportable to the sponsor only as defined below.  
 Cases of subjects missing doses of the IP are not considered reportable  
(removed: as medication errors) . 
 (Removed: Medication errors should be collected and reported) Applicable 
only for the IP under investigation.  
 All IP provided to pediatric subjects should be supervised by the 
parent/caregiver/LAR. Lapses in supervision should be reported.  
 Section 8.1.7  
Revised : Once the subject’s parent/caregiver/LAR signs informed consent (and 
subject a ssent) , it is expected that all eDiary entries will be made daily  (removed: 
and no longer than 72 hours after each day) . 
Added: Retrospective entry of diary events (seizure and medication) can be 
completed by the caregiver up to 5 days later and proxy entr y by the site is 
also available to the site staff (greater than 5 days), but neither method is 
encouraged.  Section 9.1  
Revised:  If nominal  statistical significance is achieved in the biomarker -positive 
stratum, then efficacy will be assessed in the biomar ker-negative stratum.  
 
GNX efficacy in the biomarker -positive stratum will be established if that stratum ’s 
ITT analysis results are nominally  statistically significant.  Section 9.13.1.2

Added: No formal interim analysis is planned for this study. After all active 
subjects complete the17 -week double -blind phase, the double -blind data in 
the database will be locked and used to perform endpoint analysis. Data 
collected during the open label phase w ill be analyzed se parately.   
Removed:  As enrollment in the study was discontinued early due to 
administrative reasons, and only 15 biomarker -positive subjects are 
expected to be randomized, the study is not considered to have adequate 
power for formal testing of the statist ical hypotheses. Since the reason for 
stopping enrollment is external to the study, the statistical analysis will be 
performed as planned. All p -values produced as part of the pre -specified 
analysis would therefore be considered as nominal.  Synopsis ( Inter im 
Analysis ) and Section 
9.16 
Added: A total of 50 subjects (25 in each treatment group) w as planned to be 
enrolled in the study.  
 
Note: Protocol versions 5 and 6 were implemented after enrollment was stopped 
early due to administrative reasons. The fina l sample size is not based on 
statistical considerations. Formal hypothesis testing will be performed based on 
all available sample size at the time of the study discontinuation.  
 
Removed:  Based on data from the 7 biomarker -positive PCDH19 -related epilepsy  
in Study 1042 -0900 evaluating GNX, the standard deviation for the percent change 
in 28 -day seizure frequency is estimated to be 28.4, although other relevant data 
suggest the actual standard deviation could be meaningfully higher. If we assume 
the standar d deviation to be 40 and the percent change in 28 -day seizure frequency 
on GNX minus that on placebo truly to be ꟷ40%, then a trial with 50 biomarker - 
positive PCDH19 patients randomized in a 1:1 manner will have about 94% power 
to detect this effect when using a test statistic that preserves a (one -sided) 2.5% 
false positive error rate. The threshold for achieving statistical significance in the 
biomarker positive cohort at the final analysis when 50 subjects have completed 
their 17 -week double -blind phase  would be an estimate of the difference that is 
55.5% of the standard deviation.  (If the standard deviation is 40, then the 
threshold for statistical significance is approximately ꟷ23%). The actual analysis 
will use a Wilcoxon rank -sum test, which has app roximately the same power as the 
analysis of variance (ANOVA).  
 
As enrollment in the study was discontinued early due to administrative reasons 
and only 15 biomarker -positive subjects are expected to be randomized, the study 
is not considered to have adequ ate power for formal testing of the statistical 
hypotheses. Since the reason for stopping enrollment is external to the study and a 
purely administrative decision, the statistical analysis of this study will be 
performed as planned. All p -values produced a s part of the planned pre -specified 
analysis would be considered as nominal.  Section 9.5  
Added: The Randomized population comprises all subjects who are 
randomized to one of GNX or PBO treatment group.  
Revised: The Safety (Removed: and ITT) population  comprises all randomized 
subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. (Removed: In addition to 
being the population for the safety analyses, the biomarker -positive subjects in it is 
the primary population for the efficacy analyses.)  Section 9.6

Added:  The ITT p opulation comprises all randomized subjects who received 
at least one dose of study drug and  have at least one post -baseline efficacy 
assessment.  
Revised wording for clarification. No change to the content.  
Baseline seizure activity will be d etermined by prospective recording in subject ’s 
daily seizure eDiar ies, which are provided after signing informed consent/assent.  
Within the DB phase of the study, determination of  post-baseline seizure activity 
will begin on the day  following the first d ay of DB treatment.  Determination of  
post-baseline seizure activity assigned to the OL phase will begin on the day  
following the first OL treatment.  Section 9.7  
Revised : Tables will be provided using the ITT subject population as well as  
within each of t he biomarker -positive and biomarker -negative strata (Removed:  
and the primary endpoint table as well as the subject background and safety tables 
will also be provided as pooling over the strata.)  Section 9.7  
Revised: Medical history will be coded with the  Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) Terminology  version 22.0  (Removed : version 16.0) .   Section 9.11  
Revised: For the analyses of seizures, the baseline phase consists of the 8 - or -12 
week period  before the first day of treatment , and the DB phase starts the day 
following the first day of DB treatment and continues  until the final visit for 
subjects who do not enter the OL, and up to the day before the first dose of 
OL treatment for those who do. (Removed : The first day of treatment is not in 
either phase since the times of seizures are not collected .) 
Removed:  The estimand that is most clinically relevant as well as estimable in a 
manner that protects the integrity of randomization is the outcome measure (eg, the 
percent change in 28 -day seizure frequency), where ALL randomized subjects 
would be included in this analysis throughout the study period.  Hence, all 
available data will be used, even if they were collected after the subject stopped 
taking study medication, regardless of whethe r the subject took rescue medication.    Section 9.13.1  
Revised: Careful educating and monitoring of the study sites will attempt to limit 
the amount of missing data.  (Removed : to nearly zero, but despite these efforts, 
some missing data may still arise ) Sensitivity analyses  is, with replacement of 
missing data (Removed: will be replaced/imputed ), will be performed for the 
primary efficacy endpoint.  Section 9.13.1.1  
Added: Testing will be conducted in the following order:

GNX efficacy in the biomarker -positive stratum will be established if that stratum ’s 
ITT analysis results are nominally statistically significant.  Hierarchically, if GNX 
efficacy is established in the biomarker -positive stratum, it s efficacy will then be

the GNX and PBO gro ups in that stratum must be both clinically relevant and at 
least as large as would  be required for statistical significance in a n analysis of the 
pooled strata ITT pop ulation ( Rothmann 2012 ).   
Added:  
9.13.1.3.1.1.  Percent Change in Primary Seizure Frequency  
The percent change in 28 -day primary seizure frequency during the 17 -week 
DB Phase relative to baseline in biomarker -positive subjects.  
The same analysis methods for the primary endpoint will also be applied to 
this secondary endpoint. Please also refer to Section 9.13.1.2 for the hypothesis 
testing order.  Section 9.13.1.3 .1.1 
Revised : Except where indicated otherwise, all the seizure exploratory endpoints 
will be based on the primary seizure types  defined for inclusion in the primary 
efficacy endpoint.  Synopsis (Statistical 
Methods) and Section 
9.13.1.4.  
Added: To control the family -wise Type I error rate, hypothesis tes ting of the 
primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted sequentially in the order specified 
in Section 9.13.1.2.   
Removed: No formal hypothesis testing is planned in this study due to enrollment 
discontinuation for administrative reasons.  Section 9.13.4  
Revised throughout the protocol  for clarification. No change to the content.  
Revised: (removed: at the end of the 17 -week DB phase ) and replaced with : 
during  the 17 -week DB phase  
Revised : (Removed: 12-week ) when referencing statistical language  to read as  
just baseline or prospective baseline  
Revised : PCDH19 -related epilepsy  Entire document  
Administrative changes:  Minor changes involving grammar, rephrasing for clarity, 
punctuation, and other editorial changes have been made throughout the document.  Entire document

Rationale : 
Protocadherinl9 (PCDH19 )-related epilep sy is a serious epileptic condition characterized by early-on set cluster 
seizures , cogniti ve and senso1y impairment of varying degrees , and psychiatric and beha vioral distw-bance s 
affec ting primarily females (Camacho 2012 ). The condition is caused by an inherited mutation of the PCDH19 
gene located on the X chromosome . This gene encodes for a calcium -dependent cell-cell adhe sion molecule that 
is expre ssed in the central nervous system (CNS ; eg, hippocampus , cerebral cortex , thalamu s, amygdala ) and 
which appear s to be related to synaptic transmission and fo1mation of synaptic connec tions dw-ing brain 
development (D epienne 2009 ).

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January 2021 
The mean age of seizure onset in this condition is approximately 10 months (range of 3 -38 m onths) 
(Scheffer  2008 , Specchio 2011 , Dipienne 2011 , Cappelletti 2015 , van Harssel 2013 ).  The mean age of offset of 
epileptic seizures is approximately 12.5 years (1 -35 years) .  PCDH19 -related epilepsy has been described as a 
“semiprogressive” condition, meaning that seizure frequency increases during the first few years of life 
(Specchio  2011 ).  However, over time the seizure frequency lessens, and seizures become less frequent with 
increased age .   
There is also evidence supporting an allopregnanolone de ficiency as a proposed contributor to the onset of 
seizures in individuals with PCDH19 -related epilepsy ( Tan 2015 ).  It was found that individuals with this genetic 
mutation demonstrated a downregulation of steroid hormone -metabolizing enzymes resulting in  reduced 
allopregnanolone levels compared to non -affected, age -match ed controls .  Since th is neurosteroid is known to 
have strong anti -convulsant properties, it is hypothesized that treatment with neurosteroids with similar action, or 
analogs such as GNX, may have therapeutic benefit to seizure control.  
Ganaxolone is the 3β -methylated synthetic analog of allopregnanolone, an endogenous allosteric modulator of 
CNS γ-Aminobutyric acid type A ( GABA A) receptors .  Ganaxolone has potency and efficacy comparable t o 
allopregnanolone ( Carter 1997 ) in activating synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA A receptors at a site distinct from 
benzodiazepines and barbiturates .  Ganaxolone has protective activity in diverse rodent seizure models  
(Reddy  2012, Bialer 2010 ).  Clinical studies have demonstrated that GNX has anticonvulsant activity with an 
acceptable safety and tolerability profile in the dose range of 900 to 1800 mg in adults and children 
(Sperling  2017 , Laxer 2000 , Kerrigan 2000 , Pieribone 2007 ).  Further, GNX reduces seizures in children with IS 
and refractory pediatric epilepsy .  In an OL study, pediatric subjects aged 2 to 60 months with refractory seizures 
and a history of IS were treated with GNX doses up to 36 mg/kg for up to 3 months ( Kerrigan 2000 ).  Sixteen of 
the 20 subjects completed treatment, 15 o f whom had a history of IS .  Five of the 15 subjects had a decrease from 
baseline in the number of spasms of ≥ 50%, 5 had a decrease of 25 to 50%, and 5 had a decrease of <  25%.  One 
subject became spasm -free and 1 non -responder (with a decrease of < 25%) was spasm -free from weeks 2 to 7 .   
An anticonvulsant treatment effect signal of GNX in PCDH19 -related epilepsy has emerged from an ongoing OL 
flexible -dose exploratory study (Study 1042 -0900) of GNX in children (age range 2 -15 years) with rare genetic 
epilepsies (including PCDH19) with uncontrolled seizures despite multiple antiepileptic drug ( AED ) regimens 
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier :   [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) .  Following the screening and baseline evaluations, consenting 
subjects enrolled into a 26 -week study du ring which investigators could dose GNX starting with a titration up to 
1,800 mg/day for subjects whose body weight was > 30 kg or up to 63 mg/kg /day for subjects whose body -
weight was <  30 kg .  The dose could also be reduced for tolerability reasons .  The primary efficacy measure was 
the percent change from baseline in the 28 -day seizure frequency count .  Safety and tolerability assessments were 
among the secondary objectives .  The median change in 28 -day seizure frequency from baseline in the intent -to-
treat (ITT) population (primary endpoint) was a decrease of 2 5% (n = 11) .   
The median change from baseline in seizure -free days in the ITT population (key secondary endpoint) was an 
increase of 14% (n  = 11).  Baseline levels of allopregnanolone sulfate (Al lo-S, an endogenous neurosteroid) and 
28-day seizure rates were also assessed .  A ganaxolone -responder was specified by post -hoc definition, as having 
at least a 25% reduction in 28 -day seizure rate .  In the PCDH19 cohort, responders (n = 6) and non -respon ders (n 
= 5) had plasma Allo -S concentrations (mean ± SD) of 501 ± 430 pg mL-1 and 9,829 ± 6,638 pg mL-1, 
respectively .  When performing a retrospective separation of the PCDH19 cohort according to their Allo -S level, 
the 7 subjects with Allo -S levels belo w 2,500 pg mL-1 (biomarker -positive) had a 50% reduction in seizure rates 
while the 4 subjects with Allo -S levels above 2,500 pg mL-1 (biomarker -negative) had a 84% increase (performed 
in the research lab of Dr .  Graziano Pinna at the University of Illinoi s, Chicago, the only laboratory during the 
conduct of the study that could reliably produce results for sulphated neurosteroids) .  The Clinical Global 
Impression Scale rated by Investigators (CGI -I) and Caregivers (CGI -P) has been consistent with seizure c ontrol .  
In the OL study (1042 -0900), there were 4 SAEs ( 3 related to seizures and 1 related to rash) possibly related to 
the study drug in the PCDH19 subjects .   
In addition to anticonvulsant activity, GNX has shown positive effects on anxiety, hyperactiv ity, and attention in 
children with fragile X syndrome ( Ligsay 2016 ).  Similar behavior problems occur in individuals with PCDH19  
mutations ( Smith 2018 ).  It is hypothesized that GNX treatment will increase and improve GABA A-mediated 
signaling by boosting the signaling capacity of existing receptors and improve not only seizure control, but also 
other behavioral abnormalities in individuals with the PCDH19 mutation .

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January 2021 
Methodology :    This is a global, biomarker -stratified, DB, randomized, PBO -controlled tr ial of adjunctive GNX 
treatment in children with a confirmed pathogenic or likely pathogenic PCDH19  mutation .  The trial consists of a 
12-week prospective baseline period to collect seizure data, followed by a 17 -week DB phase, which is then 
followed by a long-term OL phase .  An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to randomize 
subjects, dispense drug, track treatment, and maintain the blind throughout the duration of the study.  
A 12-week daily historical seizure calendar will be reviewed at the screening visit to determine eligibility per 
inclusion/exclusion criteria .  Acceptable historical seizure data must include at least 12 consecutive weeks prior 
to the Screening visit of  documenting seizure type and frequency (also noting seizure -free d ays). Procedures 
specific to this protocol and not otherwise considered standard of care, will not be performed until written 
informed consent from the subject’s parent or legally authorized representative (LAR) and subject assent has 
been appropriately ob tained .  In the event that parent/caregiver/LAR do not routinely maintain a daily seizure 
calendar  or genetic testing has not been performed  per standard of care, written informed consent will be obtained 
from the parent/LAR and subject assent, and the sub ject will be asked to return to the clinic for the screening visit 
after they have maintained a 12 week daily historical seizure calendar  and/or genetic testing has been completed .   
During the screening visit , each subject’s  biomarker level  will be assess ed via a blood draw and subsequent 
analytical quantification.  Each subject  will then be assigned to 1 of 2  groups: biomarker -positive or biomarker -
negative.  A subject  will be considered biomarker -positive if her baseline Allo -S level is less than or equa l to 
2500 pg/mL (Pinna Lab method or similar).  The biomarker group assignment will remain blinded until database 
unblinding after the study has completed.  Based on the completed 11-subject 1042 -0900 Phase 2a study , it is 
estimated that approximately 65% o f all subjects will be biomarker -positive . 
Subject rescreening is allowed as agreed by Sponsor and Investigator unless there is a general concern for subject  
safety or an inability for the subject to become eligible (eg, GNX allergy, sensitivity or exposur e, non -PCDH19 
and/or other ineligible epilepsy, chronic prohibited medical condition or treatment) .  Subsequent screening should 
take place at least 30 days from the subject’s last visit.  
The DB phase includes 4 weeks of investigational product titration f ollowed by 13 weeks of dose maintenance .  
After meeting the eligibility criteria, approximately 25 children aged 1 -17 years (inclusive) with PCDH19 -related 
epilepsy  will be randomly assigned to receive GNX or PBO (1:1 ratio within each biomarker stratum) f or 17 
weeks in addition to their standard anti -seizure treatment .  Participants will be titrated to 63 mg/kg/day (max 1800 
mg/day) over 4 weeks, and then maintained at that dose for another 13 weeks .  Subjects who are not able to 
tolerate 63  mg/kg/day (or 1800  mg/day maximum) may be maintained on a lower dose .  A minimum dose of 
33 mg/kg/day or 900 mg/day is generally required following the DB escalation period, unless a lower dose is 
agreed to with the sponsor  due to tolerability issues  such as somnolence .   
Dose changes including alternative dosing paradigm s (e.g., lower dose during the daytime and higher dose in the 
evening) should be discussed with the clinical research organization (CRO)/sponsor medical monitor prior to 
making the change or within 48  hours of making the change . Of note , the sponsor defers the final decision to 
adjust IP  to the treating study clinician; dose changes may not exceed the maximum total daily dose defined by 
the protocol . For any subject who is unable to be maintained at the m inimum dose, the investigator should contact 
the sponsor to  discuss continued investigational product dosing .  Subjects who discontinue investigational 
product should undergo a 2 -week taper period , unless otherwise medically indicated  such as drug -induced rash.  
Subjects who discontinue investigational product treatment before the completion of the DB phase will continue 
to be followed per protocol and , at a minimum , subjects will be encouraged to maintain daily seizure eDiary 
entries until the DB phase is completed .  These subjects  will also return to the site 2 to 4 weeks after the taper for 
safety follow -up assessments.  
After completing the initial 17 -week, DB, PBO -controlled treatment phase, all subjects will be treated with GNX 
in the OL phase of the st udy.  Ganaxolone subjects will continue GNX treatment and PBO subjects will titrate 
onto GNX .  To maintain the blind, subjects initially randomized to GNX will undergo a blinded titration 
(increasing PBO doses) for 4 weeks, while PBO subjects will titrate up to 63 mg/kg/day GNX (1800  mg/day 
maximum) during the same time period .  Any subject who completes the study or discontinues investigational 
product treatment should undergo a 2 -week drug de -escalation (taper) period and return to the site 2 weeks later 
for safety follow -up assessments .  Taper is not required if the subject is receiving the dose of 18 mg/kg/day or 
450 mg/day (or lower).

c Subjects > 28 kg will be dosed on a fixed regimen in increments of 450 mg/day up to 1800 mg/day.  
Any subject not tolerating the next dose level  can be maintained at the lower dose for additional days before 
advancing to the next dose .  If the next dose level  is still not tolerated, the subject can drop back to the last 
tolerated  dose .  A minimum dose of 33 mg/kg/day or 900 mg/day is generally required following the DB 
escalation  period, unless a lower dose is  agreed to with the sponsor  due to tolerability issues such as somnolence .   
Dose changes  including alternative dosing paradigm (e.g., lower dose during the daytime and higher dose in the 
evening)  should be discussed with the sponsor /CRO medical monitor p rior to making the change or within 48 
hours of making the change . Of note , the sponsor defers the final decision to adjust IP  to the treati ng study 
clinician ; dose changes may not exceed the maximum total daily dose defined by the protocol . For any subje ct 
who is unable to be maintained at the minimum dose, the investigator should contact the sponsor to discuss 
continued investigational product dosing. Subjects who discontinue investigational product treatment before the 
completion of the DB phase will co ntinue to be followed per protocol and , at a minimum , subjects  will be 
encouraged to maintain daily seizure eDiary entries until the DB phase is completed .  These subjects will also 
return to the site 2  to 4 weeks after the taper for safety follow -up asses sments.  
During the OL phase, all subjects will be treated with GNX .  Those subjects who received GNX oral suspension 
in the 17 -week DB phase will receive the same GNX dose in the OL phase of the study .  However, to maintain 
the study blind, GNX subjects wi ll enter into a 4 -week blinded titration phase by increasing PBO doses in 
addition to maintaining GNX .  Subjects who received PBO oral suspension in the 17 -week DB phase will enter a  
4-week, GNX titration period in the OL phase of the study .

Refere nce Therapy, Dose and Mode of A dmini stration: Placebo is to be admini stered as an oral suspension 
TID with food during the 4-week, titration period of the DB phase of the study. 
Placebo will only be used in the OL phase of the study during the 4-week blinded titration phase for those subjects 
who were original ly randomized to GNX in the 17-week DB phase. 
Durati on of treatmen t: Eligible subjects will collec t 12 weeks of prospective baseline seizure data. Subjec ts 
will be randomized (1: 1 within each biomarker stratum) to a 17-w eek DB phase with GNX or PBO ( 4 weeks 
titration and 13 weeks dose maintenance) , follo wed by a long-tenn OL treatment phase with GNX. Following 
the completion of the 17-week DB phase , subjec ts randomized to PBO will transition to GNX (using blinded 
titration ), while subjec ts randomized to GNX will stay on 63 mg/k g/day suspension (1800 mg/day maximum) , or 
their maximum tolera ted dose (MTD) and also recei ve a blinded titration of PBO. Subjec ts will begin the 4-week 
blinded dose tit ration to 63 mg/k g/day (1800 mg/day or MTD) after completing the final DB visit. The OL phase 
will continue until the sponsor tenninates the developmen t of the investigational product in PCDH19-related 
epilepsy or GNX has been approved and marke ted in the subjec ts' respecti ve coun try. 
Participants who comp lete t he study or discontinue investigational produc t treatmen t before the end of the study 
will undergo a 2-week taper period , unless otherwise medically indica ted, after which she will return to the study 
site for a safety follow up visit. Subjects who discontinue investiga tional produc t treatment before the 
comp letion of the DB phase will continue to be followed per protocol and, at a minimum , subjects will be 
encouraged to maintain daily seizure eDiary entries until the DB phase is comp leted. 
Criteria for Evaluati on: 
Seizw ·es: All seizure types and frequency will be recorded daily in an eDiaiy. Days in which no seizures occur 
will also be noted . Subsets of seizw·e types will be defined below. 
Prim a1-y Endpoint (seizure control) 
The prima1y efficacy endpoin t is the percen t change in 28-day primary seizw·e frequency during the 17-week DB 
phase relative to the baseline. The primaiy seizure types are defined as countab le focal seizure s that include 
progres sive hypotonia and impaired awareness , or any countab le focal or generalized seizure with a clear motor 
component. Focal and genera lized nonmo tor seizure s and myoclonic seizw·e s do not coun t as the prima1y seizure 
types for the prima1y efficacy endpoin t. The analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed on the sum of the 
individual countab le seizure s and each series of continuou s uncoun table seizw·e s (each contributes 1 to the sum). 
Post-baseline 28-day seizure frequency will be calcula ted as the total number of seizure s in the 17-week DB

seizure frequency will be calculated as the total number of seizw·es in the baseline phase divided by the number 
of days with seizure data in the phase , multip lied by 28. The difference bet\¥een the GNX and placebo groups in 
the percen t change s will be tested using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum statistic. The prima1y analysis will be

The PK population will include all subject s who have recei ved at least 1 dose ofIP and who have had at least 1 
sample collected and a valid bioanalytical result obtained . The samples will be drawn between 1 and 5 hour s or 
between 4 and 8 hour s after the last dose during the double -blind and open label periods. Phaimacokinetic 
analyse s will be limited to listing of concentration s becau se sufficient concentration -time data will not be 
available for noncompartmental analy ses such as Cmax, AUC or fmax. Phanna .cokinetic data from this study may be 
used for a Population PK analy ses to be conduc ted separately from this study and reported separa tely. Further 
details will be provided in the SAP . 
Safety and Tolerabili ty Assessments: 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring vital signs (blood pressure [BP], hea1t rate [HR], 
respirato1y rate [RR] , body temperature , electrocardiograms (ECGs ), clinical laborato1y tests (hematology , 
chemi stty and urinaly sis), physical, neurological , and developmen tal examination s, and frequency , type, and 
severity of AEs during the 17-week , DB phase and the OL phase. Height and weight will also be measured.

The primaiy efficacy endpoin t (seizure control) is the percent change in 28-day primaiy seizure frequ ency dw-ing 
the 17-week DB phase relati ve to the baseline, based on all countab le focal seizures that include progres sive 
hypo tonia and impair ed awareness, or any countab le focal or generalized seizw-e with a clear motor component . 
The analyses of the primaty endpoint will be performed on the sum of the individual countable seizures and each 
series of continuous uncoun table seizw-es (each contribu tes 1 to the sum). Post-baseline 28-day seizure frequency 
will be calculated as the total number of seizures in the 17-week DB treatment phase divided by the number of 
days with seizw·e data in the phase, multip lied by 28. Baseline 28-day seizure frequency will be calculated as the 
total number of seizure s in the baseline phase divided by the number of days with seizure data in the phase, 
multiplied by 28. 
The prima1y analysis will be conducted in the ITT Popula tion. 
All secondary efficacy endpoints will compare GNX and PBO during the 17-week DB treatment phase relative to 
the prospective baseline phase. 
The percentage s of seizure -free days will be based on the primaiy seizure types. 
BRIEF (BRIEF -P where appropriate) will be assessed as follows: in the DB phase at Visit 2 
(baseline /randotnization ) and Visit 5 (Week 17; also Final DB Visit/First OL Visit in open label phase ); in the OL 
phase at Visit 7 (Week 36) and Visit 9 (Week 68) and thereafter eve1y 16 weeks for the duration of this phase ; 
and at the Final OL Visit. 
The ABC-C will be assessed as follows : in the DB phase at Visit 2 (baseline /randotniza tion) and Visit 5 (Week 
17; also Final DB Visit/First OL Visit in open label phase ); in the OL phase at Visit 7 (Week 36) and Visit 9 
(Week 68) and thereafter eve1y 16 weeks for the duration of this phase; and at the Final OL Visit.

With few exceptions , all of the analyses for the DB phase  will be repeated for the OL phase  with the following 
differences . 
Safety Analysis :    
All saf ety analyses will be performed in the Safety Population .  The results in the DB and OL phases will be 
summarized separately .  Adverse events will be tabulated by overall, system organ class, and Preferred Term 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Ac tivities (MedDRA) coding system .  Incidence and percentage of 
AEs will be presented .  Additional tables, with AEs classified by severity and by only those related to drug as 
assessed by the PI will be presented .  Subset listings will be produced for AEs th at cause withdrawal and for 
SAEs .  Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry and urinalysis), vital signs and ECGs will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics including changes from baseline .  Physical, neurological and developmental 
examination s will be summarized using number and percentage of subjects with abnormalities.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis :   A population PK approach addressing the relationship between GNX PK 
parameters and individual characteristics will be implemented during the study .  One blood sample will be 
obtained at the following visits for PK analyses:  
 During the DB Phase:  
- Visit 3 (Week 5) :  between 1 and 5 hours since the last investigational product dosing  
- Visit 4 (Week 9) :  between 4 and 8 hours since the last investigation al product dosing  
 During the OL Phase:  
- Visit 6 (Week 21) : between 1 and 5 hours since the last investigational product dosing  
- Visit 8 (Week 52 ): between 1 and 5 hours since the last investigational product dosing  
For all other PK draws, there is no specifi ed time to draw the PK sample and can be drawn when convenient during 
the study visits  for Visit 5 (Week 17), Visit 7 (Week 36), Visit 9 (Week 68), and every 16 weeks for the duration 
of the open -label phase . 
Exact time of sample withdrawal and drug intake  will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) .   
Neurosteroid serum and Concomitant AED levels :   Blood samples will be drawn at screening visit, Week 17, 
and the final OL visit to measure neurosteroid levels allopregnanolone and related end ogenous CNS -active 
steroids and sulfate metabolites .  Concomitant AED levels will not be mandatory but will be conducted per sites’ 
standard of care .  If AED levels are available, the results, date and time of last AED dose and date and time of 
AED PK samp le will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Interim Analysis:  No formal interim analysis is planned for this study.  After all active subject s complete the 17-
week double -blind phase , the double -blind data in the database will be locked  and used to perform endpoint 
analysis.  Data collected during the open label phase  will be analyzed separately.   
Data Monitoring Committee :   The emerging study data will be reviewed on a regular basis by an independent 
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) .  The mission of the DMC will be to  safeguard the interests of study 
participants and to enhance the integrity and credibility of the trial .  To enable the DMC to achieve their mission, 
the DMC will have ongoing access to efficacy and safety data and data regarding quality of trial conduct and will 
ensure the confidentiality of these data will be preserved .  A DMC Charter will provide the principles and 
guidelines for the DMC process .

Table 1.  Schedule of Assessments for the 17 -Week, Double -Blind Phase of the St udy:  Footnotes  
AED = antiepileptic drug , BP = blood pressure , CBD = cannabidiol , D/C = discontinuation , DB = double -blind , ECG = electrocardiogram , EEG = electroencephalogram , HR = 
heart rate , LAR = legally authorized representative , PK = pharmacokinetic , RR = respiratory rate , THC = tetrahydrocannabinol , WCBP = women of childbearing potential.  
a. Subject rescreening is allowed as agreed by Sponsor and Investigator unless there is a general concern for subject  safety or an inability for the subject to become  eligible ( eg, 
GNX allergy, sensitivity or exposure, non -PCDH19 and/or other ineligible epilepsy, chronic prohibited medical condition or treatment) .  Subsequent screening should take 
place at least 30 days from the subject’s last visit.  
b. Written informed c onsent/assent must be obtained from subject, parent or LAR before any study assessments are performed.  
c. In the event that the parent/caregiver/LAR does not routinely maintain a daily seizure calendar per standard of care, written  informed consent will be ob tained from the 
parent/LAR and subject assent, and the subject will be asked to return to the clinic for the screening visit after she has ma intained a 12-week daily historical seizure calendar.  
d. Review of medical history only .   
e. Genetic testing to be perfo rmed to confirm pathogenic or likely pathogenic PCDH19  variant.  If genetic testing is not performed  as Standard of Care, a pre -baseline screen ing 
visit will be scheduled  to obtain  informed consent/assent and complete  the genetic testing. If genetic testing  results are available per SOC, the genetic testing will be done at 
screening to confirm the results by the Sponsors designated lab.  
f. In addition, height and weight will be measured.  
g. In addition, weight will be measured.  At each visit, dosing will be review ed and adjusted as needed based on a subject’s current weight.  
h. Chemistry & Hematology .   
i. An attempt should be made to collect a urine sample for a urinalysis at screening ; otherwise, the urine sample can be collected at baseline for the urinalysis.  
j. A drug  screen (plasma ) will be performed to test for THC and CBD at screening . If the screening drug test is positive, the subject can be retested , via plasma , after two weeks .  
A drug screen may be performed at any time at Investigator’s discretion.   A positive  drug test during the DB phase will result in early termination.  
k. Serum pregnancy test is required for all girls/women of childbearing potential.   
l. Population PK will be conducted at these visits (Visit 3 :  between 1 -5 hours since last IP dosing, Visit 4 :  between 4 -8 hours since the last investigational product dosing) .   
m. Concomitant AEDs must be stable for 1 month prior to screening and cannot be changed at any time prior to Visit 5, but may be  adjusted during the open -label phase of the 
study.  
n. For record ing of seizures in the eDiary, seizure events will be recorded either as a countable seizure or a  series of continuous  uncountable seizures .  Both of these events will 
be counted as 1 seizure (equally weighted ) in the efficacy analysis .  A seizure cluster will be defined as 3 or more seizure events (either a countable or a  series  of continuous 
uncountable seizures), occurring within a period of time, followed by a period of at least 24 hours of seizure -freedom.  
Examples: ( Figure 2): 
 If a child experiences 3 seizure eve nts at 5:00, 5:30, and 6:00 PM on Monday, and the next seizure event occurs before 6:00 P M on Tuesday, the Monday and Tuesday 
seizure events are considered part o f the same seizure cluster ( Figure 2, Scenario 1) .   
 If a child experiences 3 seizure events at 5:00, 5:30, and 6:00 PM on Monday, and the next seizure event occurs at 6:00 PM or  later on Tuesday, the Tuesday seizure 
event is not considered part of the s ame cluster ( Figure 2, Scenario 2) . 
o. Caregiver given eDiary and instructions for use.  
p. During the screening visit, the principal investigator and parent/caregiver/LAR will decide on a domain and identify the spec ific behavior that the subject  exhibits that denotes 
the domain.  This behavior will be used at subsequent visits to assess change after the initiation of investigational product . 
q. Subjects  who discontinue investigational product early will be  encouraged to  continue with all procedures and scheduled visits.  
r. The 12 weeks between Screening and Randomization can be no less than 84 days and no more than 90 days.

Note:  The timin g of the final OL visit is not defined at this time, as the study is anticipated to continue until either the investigational  product is approved and 
marketed, or the Sponsor discontinues development of investigational product in PCDH19 -related epilepsy  (approximately an additional 3 years) .   
a. If the subject continues in the OL phase beyond Week 68, a telephone follow -up visit will occur in between clinic visits (8 weeks ± 14 days after each clinic 
visit) to assess the following adverse events and seizure a nd medication diary review.  
b. In addition, weight will be measured at every visit, except the safety follow -up visit.  
c. In addition, height will be measured annually after Visit 8 (Week 52), except the safety follow -up visit.  
d. After Visit 8 (Week 52), ECGs to b e performed annually (and at last OL visit).  
e. Chemistry & Hematology.  
f. Serum pregnancy test is required for all girls/women of childbearing potential . 
g. Conduct annually and at the final OL visit . 
h. For recording of seizures in the eDiary, seizure events will be  recorded either as a countable seizure or a  series of  continuous uncountable seizures .  Both of 
these events will be counted as 1 seizure (equally weighted) in the efficacy analysis .  For recording of seizures in the eDiary, seizure events will be recorde d 
either as a countable seizure or a  series  of continuous uncountable seizures.  Both of these events will be counted as 1 seizure (equally weighted) in the 
efficacy analysis.  A seizure cluster will be defined as 3 or more seizure events (either a countab le or a series of continuous uncountable seizures), occurring 
within a period of time, fo llowed by a period of at least 24 hours of seizure -freedom.  
Examples: ( Figure 2): 
 If a child experiences  3 seizure events at 5:00, 5:30, and 6:00 PM on Monday, and the next seizure event occurs before 6:00 PM on Tuesday, the 
Monday and Tuesday seizure events are considered part of the same seizure cluster ( Figure 2, Scenario 1) .   
 If a c hild experiences 3 seizure events at 5:00, 5:30, and 6:00 PM on Monday, and the next seizure event occurs at 6:00 PM or later  on Tuesday, the 
Tuesday seizure event is not considered part of the same cluster ( Figure 2, Scenario 2) . 
i. Population PK will be conducted at these visits (Visit 6: between 1 -5 hours since the last IP dosing and Visit 8: between 1 -5 hours since last IP dosing)  
j. Subjects who discontinue IP treatment before the completion of the DB phase will cont inue to be followed per protocol and, at a minimum, subjects will be 
encouraged to maintain daily seizure eDiary entries until the DB phase is completed.  These subjects will also return to the site 2 to 4 weeks after the taper 
for safety follow -up post -taper assessments.  Taper is not required if the subject is receiving the dose of 18 mg/kg/day or 450 mg/day (or lower).

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
1.1. Indication and Current Treatment Options 
Pediatric patients with rare epilepsy conditions, such as protocadherin 19 (PCDH19)-related 
epilepsy, cyclin-dependent kinase-like
 5 (CDKL5) Disorder (CDD), Dravet Syndrome, as well as 
many other refractory genetic epilepsy c
onditions that may share common seizure types and 
often their seizures, become treatment-resistant.  These
 seizure disorders may overlap idiopathic 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or other genetica
lly-based conditions with intractable epilepsy 
clinically resembling LGS.  This population has been at times, treated with, and responsive to, 
classes of corticosteroids like prednisone or adrenocorticotropic hormone.  
Other epileptic 
diagnostic conditions, such as continuous spike and wave during slow wave
 sleep (CSWS) or 
electrical status epilepticus in sleep, may also re
spond to corticosteroid medications, and be 
refractive to standard antiepileptic agents.  The mechanism by
 which any of these mutations 
contributes to the development of epilepsy is not well understood.  No sin
gle anticonvulsant has 
been found to be uniformly effective, and often multiple antic
onvulsants are needed; even then, 
patients still become treatment-resistant. 
The nee
d for novel treatments to address seizure control is critical for pediatric patients living 
with these conditions.  This study will assess the efficacy and s
afety of ganaxolone as an 
experimental drug with a new and distinct mechanism of acti
on. 
Ganaxolone (GNX) is the 3β -methylated synthetic a
nalog of allopregnanolone, an endogenous 
allosteric modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) re
ceptors in the central nervous 
system (CNS).  Ganaxolone has potency and effica
cy comparable to allopregnanolone in 
activating synaptic and extrasynaptic
 GABA A receptors at a site distinct from the benzodiazepine 
site.  Ganaxolone has protective activity in diverse rodent seizure models (Bialer 2010, 
Reddy 2012).  
Clinical studies have demonstrated that GNX has anticonvuls
ant efficac
y with an acceptable 
safety and tolerability profile in the dose range of 900 to 1800 m
g in adults and children 
(Sperling 2017, Laxer 2000, Kerrigan 2000, Pieribone 2007).  The present study will investigate 
whether GNX 
provides efficacy for children with uncontrolled se
izures and PCDH19-related 
epilepsy and other genetic epilepsies. 
Protocadherin 19- female-pediatric epilepsy, also known as PCDH19 female-limited epilepsy, or 
epilepsy in females with mental retardation (hereon referred to as PCDH19-related epilepsy)
, is a 
serious epileptic syndrome characterized by early-onset cluster seizures, cognitive and sensory 
impairment of varying degrees, and psychiatric and behavioral disturbances in some individuals 
(Camacho 2012, Depienne 2014).   
PCDH19-related epilepsy is associated with a mutation of the P
CDH19 gene, the gene that 
encodes for protoca
dherin19 on the X chromosome (Depienne 2014a, Dibbens 2008).  The 
mechanism by which this mutation contributes to the de
velopment of e
pilepsy and intellectual 
impairment is not fully understood.  Protocadherin is, however, a transmembrane protein of 
calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules that i
s strongly expressed in neural tissue (eg, 
hippocampus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and amygdale) and which appears to be related to 
synaptic transmission and formation of synaptic connec
tions during brain development

(Depienne 2009 ).  Research suggests that impairment of γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic 
signaling both at the agonist and receptor le
vels is present in girls with PCDH19 mutations and 
pediatric-onset epilepsy (Tan 2015). 
The hallmark characteristics of PCDH19-related epilepsy a
re clusters of seizures which start in 
infancy or early childhood that are often associated with fever or immunization (Depienne 2012, 
Higurashi 2013, Marini 2010).  Patients with PCDH19-related epilepsy may experience 
indi
vidual seizures in addition to clusters and multiple seizure types.  In some patients, seizures 
improve as patients reach puberty, possibly due to increased endogenous levels of progesterone 
and allopregnanolone (Camacho 2012, Specchio 2011, Scheffer 2008). 
The mean a
ge of onset of PCDH19-
related epilepsy is approximately
 10 months (range of 3-38 
months) (Scheffer 2008, Specchio 2011, Dipienne 2011, Cappelletti 2015, van Harssel 2013).  
The mean age of of
fset of epileptic seizures is approximately 12.5 years (1
-35 years).  PCDH19-
related epilepsy has been described as a “semiprogressive” con
dition, meaning that seizure 
frequency increases during the first few years of life (Specchio 2011); however, the seizure 
frequency decreases, and seizures become less frequent with increased age.   
There is also evidence supporting an allopregnanolone deficiency as a proposed contributor to 
the onset of se
izures in individuals with PCDH19-related epilepsy (Tan 2015).  It was found that 
individuals with this genetic mutation demonstrated a downregulation of steroid hormone-
metaboli
zing enzymes, r
esulting in reduced allopregnanolone levels compared to non-affected, 
age-match ed controls.  Since th is neurosteroid is known to have strong anti-convulsant 
properties, it is hypothesized that tre
atment with neurosteroids with similar action, or analogs 
such as GNX, ma
y have therapeutic benefit to seizure control. 
1.2. Product Background and Clinical Information 
Ganaxolone is the 3β-methylated synthetic analogue of the neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone, 
but it is designed to not activate nuclear (classical) progesterone receptors.  Ganaxolone differs 
from other GABA agents by interacting with both synaptic and extra-synaptic GABA A receptors 
and at binding sites distinct from benzodiazepines.  Whereas benzodiazepines might lose their 
inhibitor
y action, GNX does not because it selectively binds to GABA A rec
eptors containing the 
α and δ subunits.  By enhancing GABA A receptor function, GNX provides an alternative 
mechanism in the treatment of seizures, and could serve as 
effective therapy in the management 
of benzodiazepine-resistant seizure conditions, such as CDD.   
The anticonvulsant activity of G
NX was established in several in vivo  models of seizure activity.  
Ganaxolone was effective at behaviorally non-toxic doses in rodent models of seizures indu
ced 
by pentylenetetrazol, bicucilline, aminophylline, strychnine, and 
t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate and antagonized 4-AP lethality in mice.  Ganaxolone blocked 
tonic seizures induced by maximal electroshock in mice and rats, but only at doses that produced 
ataxia on the rotarod test.  Ganaxolone was a potent anticonvulsant against fully-kindled Stage-5 
seizures induced by corneal kindling in the rat at doses well below those that resulted in ataxia.  
Seizure threshold, as determined by the dose of intravenously-infused pentylenetetrazol required 
to induce clonus, was significantly elevated by non-toxic doses of GNX in the mouse.  These 
results indicate that GNX  blocks seizure propagation and elevates seizure threshold ( Carter 199 7, 
Kaminski 2004 , Reddy 2004 ).

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
As of 10 Oct 2018, 1557 unique subjects have received treatment with GNX in completed 
company
-sponsored clinical trials ranging in duration from 1 day to more than 2 years, using 
doses from 50 to 2,000 mg/day. In addition, 30 subjects received GNX in an ongoing open-label 
Phase 2 stud
y, and an estimated 65 subjects received GNX in ongoing Phase 2/3 double-blind 
studies.  
Of these
 1557 unique subjects, 319 healthy subjects have received GNX treatment in Phase 1 
studies and 1238 subjects have received GNX treatment in Phase 2/3 studies. The completed 
tria
ls include 20 Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects and 20 Phase 2/3 studies in adults with 
epilepsy
, children with seizure disorders, children with FXS, adults with PTSD and adults with 
migraine. 
Four company-sponsored clinical studies of GNX are ongoing and have enrolled over 200 
unique subjects :  
 Study 1042-0900 in pediatric epilepsies including female pediatric subjects with 
PCDH19 epilepsy and other rare genetic epilepsies including CDKL5 deficiency 
disorder, LGS and continuous spikes and waves during sleep (CSWS )  
 Study 1042- SE-2001 in adolescents and adults with SE  
 Study 1042- PPD-2002 in women with PPD (GNX IV and oral capsule multiple-dose 
escalation double-blind study)  
 Study 1042- PPD-2003 in women with PPD (GNX oral capsule multi-dose escalation 
open label study) 
For these 4 ongoing clinical studies, enrollment is complete for Study 1042-0900, 1042- PPD-
2002 and 1042- PPD-2003 and is ongoing fo
r Stud y 1042- SE-2001. 
In addition to the company-sponsored studies, 29 subjects were treated with GNX in completed 
studies not sponsored by Marinus.  These included 16 subjects who received oral GNX doses 
from 400 mg/day to 1200 mg/day in a smoking cessation study and 10 subjects who received 
oral GNX in a postmenopausal depression study.  One pediatric subject received oral GNX up to 
63 mg/kg/day under a special access scheme in Australia for treatment of refractory seizures 
associated with PCDH19 genetic epilepsy.  In addition, two pediatric subjects received GNX in 
separate emergency INDs to treat super-refractory status epilepticus: 1 subject received IV GNX 
up to a dose of 2880 mg/day and 1 subject received IV GNX infusion up to a dose of 192 mg/day 
and transitioned to a GN
X oral suspension dose of 1260 mg/day that was tapered over 6 weeks. 
[SAE Section 5.6 IB] 
Furthermore, 3 non-company-sponsored clinical studies are ongoing. In these studies, a total of 
7 subjects continue to receive treatment with GNX through investigator-initiated INDs following 
participation in Marinus
-sponsored studies as follows :  
 In one study, 3 subjects received GNX following participation in Study 1042-0603 of 
adult subje
cts with drug-resistant partial-onset seizures. 
 In one study, 3 subjects (2 subjects with PCDH19 epilepsy and 1 subject with LGS) 
receiv
ed GNX following participation in Study 1042-0900.

 IND 044020   Marinus Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
 In another study, 1 subject with CDD received GNX following participation in 
Study 1042-0900 
The overall
 frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) in company-sponsored 
placebo (PBO)-controlled studies was 61.7% (613/993 subjects) in subjects who received GNX 
and 51.8% (330/637 subj
ects) in subjects who received PBO.  The most frequently reported 
TEAEs in GNX-tre
ated subjects were somnolence, dizziness, fatigue, and headache.  All of these 
events, except for headache, occurred more frequently in GNX-treated subjects than PBO-treated 
subjects.  Central nervous system-related even ts appeared to be dose-related, with the majority of 
these events occurring at doses ≥ 500 mg , and were anticipated based on the mechanism of 
action of GNX
.  These events were non-serious, mild to moderate in severity, and did not lead to 
discontinuation of treatment.   
I
n the GNX development program overall, no clinically significant trends have been noted for 
electrocardiogram (ECG) intervals, vital signs, physical or neurologic examinations, or mean 
changes from baseline in clinical laboratory results.  Overall, there have been a few clinically 
significant individual changes from baseline in clinical laboratory measurements in clinical trials 
of GNX.  In the completed PBO-controlled Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies, 0.3% of subjects treated 
with GNX and 0.5% of subjects treated with PBO exhibited elevated liver function tests during 
the study (aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase > 3 × the upper limit of normal 
[ULN]).  The
re have been no cases of Hy’s law considered to be related to GNX  in the GNX 
developme
nt program. 
In controlled clinical trials of GNX, 1.1% of subjects receiving PBO and 1.7% of subjects 
receiving GNX re
ported an adverse event ( AE) of rash suggesting there is no obvious imbalance 
between drug
 and PBO in terms of frequency of this AE.  However, in PBO-controlled studies, 
rash led to discontinuati
on in GNX-treated subjects in 6 cases (0.6%) compared to no cases (0%) 
in PBO-treated subjects.   One of the events was also reported as an SAE and the event resolved 
after discontinua
tion of the study drug. In addition, in the ongoing study 1042-0900, an 
additional event of rash was reported as an SAE. There have been no cases of Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis or any other clinically important rashes reported in the 
clinical development program. Marinus considers rash as a potential risk associated with GNX 
and continues to monitor the occurrence of this AE in the clinical development program. 
Pediatric Safety 
Marinus has completed 2 double-blind (DB), randomized trials and 5 open-label ( OL), 
uncontrolled clinical trials of GNX in the pediatric population.  One additional pediatric trial, OL 
S
tudy 1042-0900 in children with various genetic epilepsies and LGS, is ongoing.  This study 
has enrolled 30 subjects of which 7 are subjects with the CDKL5 mutation.   
Approximately 224 pediatric subjects aged 4 months to 17 years (data cutoff October 10, 2017) 
have rece
ived at least 1 dose of GNX.  The largest cohorts received 12 to 54 mg/kg/day, 
although some subjects received doses as high as 63 mg/kg/day or 1800 mg/day for adolescents.  
As of October 10, 2017, 4 subjects were treated ≥ 4 years, 9 subjects were treated ≥ 2 years, 
39 subjects were treated ≥ 1 year, and 66 subjects were treated ≥ 6 months. 
The major
ity of the pediatric subjects were refractory epilepsy patients who had uncontrolled 
seizures despite trying other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (range 1- 8).  Overall, GNX was 
 
Confidential Page 63 of 136  
 IND 044020   Marinus Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
generally safe and well tolerated.  In the incomplete crossover Study 1042-0500 (N = 56; all 
subjects received GNX during the trial), 39 subjects with infantile spasms ( IS) treated w ith GNX 
doses up to 54 mg/kg/day for up to 20 days reported at least 1 TEAE.  The most frequently 
reported AEs (≥
 8% of subjects) were vomiting (7 subjects), somnolence (5 subjects), and cough 
(5 subjects).  Most AEs 
were mild or moderate; 1 severe AE of lethargy occurred in 1 GNX 
subject.  During the 8-day PBO-controlled treatment period, the most frequent AEs noted were 
vomiting (11% in bot
h GNX and PBO groups) and cough (8% GNX, 5% PBO).  Other AEs 
attributed to GNX included flatulence, insomnia, irritability, lethargy, and somnolence.  Adverse 
events reporte
d in the other uncontrolled refractory pediatric epilepsy studies were consistent 
with the GABAergic mechanism of action or disease under study.   
In another randomized, DB, PBO-controlled study of 59 subjects (aged 5-17 years) with fragile 
X syndrome who w
ere treated with GNX up to 36 mg/kg/day (maximum 1800 mg/day) or PBO, 
the percentag
e of subjects who reported at least 1 TEAE was comparable between the treatment 
groups (85.2% versus 83.1% in the PBO and GNX treatment groups, respectively).  The most 
frequently reported TEAEs among subjects who received GNX included fatigue (29/59 subjects; 
49.2%), somnolence (20/59 subjects; 33.9% ), condition aggravated (10/59 subjects; 16.9%), and 
upper respira
tory tract infection (9/59 patients; 15.3%).  Both fatigue (49.2% vs 20.4%) and 
somnolence (33.9% vs 5.6%) occurred more frequently in GNX-treated subjects compared with 
PBO-treated subjects, respectively.  
Among subjects who received PBO, headache (6 subjects; 11.1%) and agitation (8 subjects; 
14.8%) were r
eported more frequently compared with GNX-treated subjects.  Severe TEAEs 
were reported for 3/59 (5.1%) GNX subjects and 1/54 (1.9%) PBO subjects.  Severe events in 
the GNX group 
were somnolence and fatigue in 1 subject each and agitation and aggression in 1 
subject. 
To date, AEs have been consistent with the GABAergic mechanism of GNX, disease understudy, 
or pediatric studies
.  There have not been any emerging safety concerns with respect to vital 
signs, ECG, physica
l/neurological examinations, or clinical laboratory measures.

2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE 
2.1. Rationale for the Study 
Protocadherin19 (PCDH19)-related epilepsy is a serious epileptic condition characterized by 
early-onset cluster seizures, cognitive and sensory impairment of varying degrees, and 
psychiatric and behavioral disturbances affecting primarily females (Camacho 2012).  The 
condition is ca
used by an inherited mutation of the PCDH19 gene located on the X chromosome.  
This gene encodes for a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecule that is expressed in the 
CNS (hippocampus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, amygdala) and which appears to be related to 
synaptic transmission and formation of synaptic connections during brain development 
(Depienne 2009 ). 
The mean age of seizure onset in this condition is approximately 10 months (range of 
3-38 months) (Scheffer IE 2008, Specchio N 2011, Dipienne 2011, Cappelletti 2015, 
van Harssel
 2013).  The mean age of offset of epileptic seizures is approximately 12.5 years 
(1-35 years).  PCDH19-related epilepsy has been described a
s a “semiprogressive” condition, 
meaning that seizure frequency increases during the first few years of life
 (Specchio 2011).  
However, over time the seizure frequency decreases, and seizures become less frequent with 
increased age.   
There is also evidence supporting an allopregnanolone deficien
cy as a proposed contributor to 
the onset of seizures in individuals with PCDH19-related epilepsy (Tan 2015).  It was found that 
individuals with this genetic mutation demonstrated a downregulation of steroid hormone-
metabolizing enzymes resulting in reduced allopregnanolone levels compared to non-affected, 
age-match ed controls.  Since th is neurosteroid is known to have strong anti-convulsant 
properties, it is hypothesized that treatment with neurosteroids with similar action, or analogs 
such as GN
X, may have therapeutic benefit to seizure control. 
Ganaxolone is the 3β-methylated synthetic analog of allopregnanolone, an endogenous allosteric 
modulator of CNS GABA A receptors.  Ganaxolone has potency and efficacy comparable to 
allopregnanolone (Carter 1997 ) in activating synaptic and extrasyn
aptic GABA A receptors at a 
site distinct from benzodiazepines and barbiturates.  Ganaxolone has protective a
ctivity in 
diverse rodent seizure models (Reddy 2012, Bialer 2010 ).  Clinical studies have demonstrated 
that GNX ha
s anticonvulsant activity with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in the dose 
range of 900 to 1800 mg in adults and children ( Sperling 2017 , Laxer 2000 , Kerrigan 2000 , 
Pieribone 2007 ).  F
urther, GNX reduces seizures in children with IS and refractor
y pediatric 
epilepsy.  In an OL  study, pediatric subjects aged 2 to 60 months with refractory seizures and a 
history of 
IS were treated with GNX doses up to 36 mg/kg for up to 3 months ( Kerrigan 2000 ).  
S
ixteen of the 20 subjects completed treatment, 15 of whom had a history of IS.  Five of the 15 
subjects had a decrease from baseline in the number of spasms of ≥ 50%, 5 had a decrease of 25 
to 50%, and 5 had a decrease of < 25%.  One subject became spasm-free and 1 non-responder 
(with a decrease of < 25%) was spasm-free from weeks 2 to 7.   
An antic
onvulsant treatment effect signal of GNX in PCDH19-related e
pilepsy has emerged 
from an ongoing OL flexible-dose exploratory study (Study 1042-0900) of GNX in children (age 
range 2-15 years) with rare genetic epilepsies (including P
CDH19) with uncontrolled seizures 
despite multiple AED regimens (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]).  Following the 
 
Confidential Page 65 of 136  
 IND 044020   Marinus Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
screening and baseline evaluations, consenting subjects enrolled into a 26-week study during 
which investigators could dose GNX starting with a titration up to 1,800 mg/day for subjects 
whose body weight was > 30 kg or up to 63 mg/kg /day for subjects whose body-weight was 
< 30 kg.  The dose could also be reduced for tolerability reasons.  The primary efficacy measure 
was the percent change from baseli
ne in the 28-day seizure frequency count.  Safety and 
tolerability assessments were among th
e secondary objectives.  The median change in 28-day 
seizure frequency from baseline
 in the intent- to-treat (ITT) population (primary endpoint) was a 
decrease of 25% (n = 11).   
The median change from baseline in seiz
ure-free days in the ITT population (key secondary 
endpoint) was an increase of 14% (n = 11).  Baseline levels of allopregnanolone sulfate (Allo-S, 
an endogenous neurosteroid) and 28-day
 seizure rates were also assessed.  A ganaxolone-
responder was specified by post-hoc d
efinition, as having at least a 25% reduction in 28 -day 
seizure rate.  In the PCDH19 cohort, responders (n = 6) and non-responders (n = 5) ha d plasma 
Allo-S concentrations (mean ± S
D) of 501 ± 430 pg mL-1 and 9,829 ± 6,638 pg mL-1, 
respectively.  When performing a
 retrospective separation of the PCDH19 cohort ac cording to 
their Allo- S level, the 7 subjects with Allo-S levels below 2,500 pg
 mL-1 (biomarke r-positive) 
had a 50%
 reduction in seizure rates whil
e the 4 subjects with Allo-S levels above 2,500 p g mL-1 
(biomarker-negative) had a 84%
 increase (performed in the research lab of Dr.  Gra ziano Pinna 
at the University of Illinois, Chicago, the onl
y laboratory during the conduct of the stud y that 
could reliably produce results for sulphated neurosteroids).  The Clinical Global Impr ession 
Scale rated by Investigat
ors (CGI-I) and Caregivers (CGI-P) has been consistent wit h seizure 
control.  In the OL study (1042-0900), there were 4 SAEs (3 related to seizures and 1 related to 
rash) possibly related to the study drug in the
 PCDH19 subjects.   
In addition to anticonvulsant activity
, GNX has shown positive effects on anxiety, h yperactivity, 
and attention in children with fragile X syndrome (Ligsay 2016).  Similar behavior pr oblems 
occur in individuals with PCDH19 mutations (Smi
th 2018 ). 
It is hypothesized that GNX treatment will i
ncrease and improve GABA A-mediated sig naling by 
boosting the signaling capacity of existing receptors and improve not only seizure c ontrol, but 
also other behavioral abnormalities in individuals with the PCDH19 mutation.

3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1. Study Design and Flow Chart 
This is a global, biomarker-stratified, DB, randomized, PBO-controlled trial of adjunctive GNX 
treatment in female children with a confirmed pathogenic or likely pathogenic PCDH19 
mutation.  The trial consists of a 12-week prospecti
ve baseline period to collect seizure data, 
followed by a 17-week DB treatment phase, which
 is then followed by a long-term OL phase 
(Figure 1 ).  An interactive web response sy
stem (IWRS) will be used to randomize subjects, 
dispense drug, track treatment, and maintain the blind throughout the durati
on of the study 
(Section 6.2.1).  
A 12-week daily historical seizure calenda
r will be reviewed at the screening visit to determine 
eligibility per inclusion/exclusion criteria
 (Section 4). Acceptable historical seizure data must 
include at lea
st 12 consecutive weeks prior to the Screening visit of documenting seizure type 
and frequency (also noting seizure-
free days). If genetic testing is not performed as Standard of 
Care, a pre-baseline scree
ning visit will be scheduled to obtain informed consent/assent and 
complete the genetic testing. I
f genetic testing results are available from SOC, the genetic testing 
will be done at screening to confirm the results by the Spons
ors designated lab. Genetic testing is 
to be performed to confirm pathogenic or likely pathog
enic PCDH19  variant.   Procedures 
specific to this protocol and not otherwise considered standard o
f care will not be performed 
until written informed consent from the subject’s parent or legally authorized representative 
(LAR) and subject assent has been appropriately obtained.  In the event that 
parent/caregiver/LAR do es not routinely maintain a daily seizure calendar or have genetic testing 
results per standard of care, written informed c
onsent will be obtained from the parent/LAR and 
subject assent. The subject will be asked to return to t
he clinic for the screening visit after she 
has maintained a 12-week daily historical seizure
 calendar.   
During the screening visit, each subjec
t’s biomarker level will be assessed via a blood draw and 
subsequent analytical quantification.  Each subject will then be assigned to 1 of 2 groups: 
biomarker-positive or biomarker-negative.  A subject will be considered biomarker-positive if 
her baseline Allo-S level is less than or equal to 2500 pg/mL (Pinna Lab method or similar). The 
biomarker group assignment will remain blinded unti
l database unblinding after the study has 
completed.  Based on the 11-subject OL study, it is estimated that approximately 65% of 
all-comers will be biomarker-positive. 
Subject rescreening is allowed as agreed by Sponsor and Investigator unless there is a general 
concern for subject safety or an inability for the subject to become eligible (eg, GNX allergy, 
sensitivity or exposure, non-PCDH19 and/or othe
r ineligible epilepsy, or chronic prohibited 
medical condition or treatment).  Subsequent screening should take place at least 30 days from 
the subjec
t’s last visit. If a subject fails to qualify because of Exclusion Criteria #4 ( ≤ 3 primary 
seizures during the 12-week baseline p
eriod), she will not be randomized. However, she can be 
rescreened after collecting
 another 12 or more weeks of seizure history that satisfies all eligibility 
criteria including I nclusion Criteria #5 and Exc
lusion Criteria #3. Each subject is allowed a 
maximum of 1 rescreening visit.  
The DB  phase includes 4 weeks of IP titration (Section 6.2.3.1 ) followed by 13 weeks of dose 
maintenance.  After meeting the eligibility criteria, approximately 25 children aged 1 to 17 years 
 
Confidential Page 68 of 136  
 IND 044020   Marinus Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
(inclusive) with PCDH19-related epilepsy will be randomly assigned to receive GNX or PBO 
(1:1 ratio within each biomarker stratum) for 17 weeks in addition to their standard anti-seizure 
treatment.  Subjects will be titrated to 63 mg/kg/d
ay (max 1800 mg/day) over 4 weeks and then 
maintained at that dose for another 13 weeks.  Subjects who ar
e not able to tolerate 63 mg/kg/day 
(or 1800 mg/day maximum) may be maintained on a lower dose
.  A minimum dose of 
33 mg/kg/day or 900 mg/day is generall y required following the DB escalation period, unless a 
lowe
r dose is agreed to with the sponsor due to the tolerability such as somnolence. At each visit, 
dosing will be reviewed and adjusted as neede
d based on subject’s current weight. 
Dose changes, including alternative dosing paradigm (e.g. lower dose during the daytime and 
higher dose in the evening), should be discussed with t
he clinical research organization 
(CRO)/sponsor medical monitor prior to making the change
 or within 48 hours of making the 
change.  Of note, the sponsor defers the final decision to a
djust IP to the treating study clinician; 
dose changes may not exceed the maxim
um total daily do defined by the protocol. For any 
subject who is unable to be maintained at the minimum dose, the inves
tigator should contact the 
sponsor to discuss continued IP dosing.  Subjects who discontinue IP should undergo a 2-week 
taper period, unless otherwise medic
ally indicated (Section 6.2.3.3).  Subjects who discontinue 
IP treatment before the completion of the DB phase will continue to be followed per protocol 
and, at a minimum, subjects will be encouraged to maintain daily seizure eDiary entries until the 
DB phase is compl
eted.  These subjects will also return to the site 2 to 4 weeks after the taper for 
safety follow-up post-taper assessments. 
After completing the initial 17-week, DB, PBO-co
ntrolled phase, all subjects will be treated with 
GNX in the OL phase of the study.  Ganaxolone subjects will continue GNX treatment and PBO 
subjects will titrate onto GNX.  To maintain the blind, subj
ects initially randomized to GNX will 
undergo a blinded titration (increasing P
BO doses) for 4 weeks, whereas PBO subjects will 
titrate up to 63 mg/kg/day GNX (1800 mg/day ma
ximum) during the same time period 
(Section 6.2.3.2).  Any subject who completes the stud
y or discontinues IP treatment should 
undergo a 2-week drug
 de-escalation (taper) period (Section 6.2.3.3) and return to the site 2 
weeks later for safe
ty follow-up post-tape
r assessments.   Taper is not required if the subject is 
receiving the dose of 18 mg/kg/day or 450 m
g/day (or lower).

Subjects will be required to complete an eDiary to determine the effect of GNX on drug-resistant 
seizures.  An electronic eDiary is 
the standard, in rare cases when an eDiary completion is not 
feasible, a paper diar
y will be used. These cases will need approval by the sponsor. A variety of 
clinician- and caregiver-
 administered instruments will be used to assess the efficacy of 
adjunctive GNX in PCDH19, and will include the following
: 
 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) 
 Aberrant Behavior Checklist – C
ommunity (ABC- C) 
 Children’s Sl
eep Habit Questionnaire (CSH Q) 
 Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory – Family Impact Module (PedsQL-FIM) 
 Quality of Life Inv
entory – Disability (QI-Disability) 
 Careg
iver Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) – Target Behavior, Clinical Global 
Impression – Improvement [care
giver], and Clinical Global Impression – Improvement 
[clinician].   
Safet
y and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring vital signs (blood pressure [BP], heart rate 
[HR], respiratory rate [R
R], body temperature, weight, and height); 12-lead ECGs, clinical 
laboratory tests (hematology, che
mistry, and urinalysis); physical, neurological, and 
developmental examinations;
 and frequency, type, and severity of AEs during the 17-week, DB 
phase and the OL phase. 
3.2. Duration a
nd Study Co
mpletion Definition 
In the event that the parent/caregiver/LAR does not routinely maintain a daily seizure calendar 
per standard of care, written informed consent will be obtained from the parent/LAR and subject 
assent, and the subject will be asked to return to the clinic for the screening visit after she has 
maintained a 12-week daily historical seizure calendar. Additionally, if genetic testing is not 
completed as standard of care, 
a pre-baseline screening visit can be conducted to do so. 
Eligible subjects will collect 12 weeks of prospective baseline seizure data.  During the screening 
visit, each subject’s biomarker level wil
l be assessed via a blood draw and subsequent analytical 
quantification.  Each subject will then be assigned to 1 of 2 groups: biomarker-positive or 
biomarker-negative.  A subject will be considered biomarker-positive if her baseline Allo-S level 
is less than or equal to 2500 pg/mL (Pinna Lab method or similar). Subjects will then be 
randomized (1:1 GNX:  PBO within each biomarker stratum) to a 17-week DB treatment phase 
(4 weeks titration and 13 weeks dose maintenance), followed by a long-term OL treatment phase 
with GNX. The
 biomarker group assignment will remain blinded until database unblinding after 
the study has completed. 
Following 
comple tion of the 17-week DB phase, subjects ra ndomized to PBO will transition to 
GNX (using blinded titration
, Section 6.2.3.2), while subj ects randomiz ed to GNX will stay on 
63 mg/kg/day (1800 mg/day or MTD) suspension or their maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and 
also receive a blinded titration of
 PBO.  Subjects will beg in the 4-w eek blinded dose titration to 
63 mg/kg/day (1800 mg/day or MTD) after completing t he final DB visit.  The OL phase will 
conti
nue until the sponsor terminates the development of the IP in PCDH19-related epilepsy or 
GNX has been approved and marketed in the subje
cts’ respective country.

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
Subjects who complete the study or discontinue IP treatment before the end of the study will  
undergo a 2-week taper period 
(Section 6.2.3.3), unless otherwise medically indicated, afte r 
which they will return to the study site for a sa
fety follow up visit.  Subjects who discontinue  IP 
treatment before completion of the DB pha
se will continue to be followed per protocol and, at a 
minimum, subjects will be encouraged to m
aintain daily seizure eDiary entries until the DB  
phase is completed.   
3.3. Sites and Regions 
This multicenter study is to be conducted globally, with approximately 11 sites planned to 
participate.   
3.4. Discussion
 of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control Gro up 
Treatment will be based on doses that have been shown to be safe in multiple studies with 
normal volunteers and children with epilepsy.  In this study, subjects will be randomized to 
receive either oral suspension GNX or PBO (1:1 ratio within each biomarker stratum), pre scribed 
in increments of 15 mg/kg/day up to 63 mg/kg
/day (maximum 1800 mg/day).  Full details o f 
GNX dosing is provided in Section 6.2.3. 
The DB  pha
se will be followed by an OL phase in which all subjects will receive GNX up to a n 
addit
ional 3 years or more, providing long-term safety and tolerability data on GNX.  
Ganaxolone subjects will continue GNX treatment and PBO subjects will titrate onto GNX .  To 
maintain the study blind, GNX subjects will enter into a 4-week 
blinded titration phase by 
increasing PBO doses in addition to mainta
ining GNX.  Subjects who received PBO oral 
suspension in the 17-week DB phase will enter a 4-
week, GNX titration period in the OL phase 
of the study.  Administration of GNX adjunctive therapy to background AEDs provides 
standard
-of-care therapy in addition to any benefit that IP might provide. 
Any subject not tolerating the ne
xt dose level can be maintained at the lower dose for additional 
days before advancing to next dose
.  If the next dose level is still not tolerated, the subject can 
drop back to the last tolerated dose.  A mini
mum oral suspension dose of 33 mg/kg/day or 900 
mg/day is generally require
d following the DB escalation period, unless a lower dose is agreed to 
with the sponsor due to tolerability issues such as 
somnolence. 
Dose changes including alternative dosing paradigm (e.g., lower dose during the daytime and 
higher dose in the evening) should be dis
cussed with the sponsor/CRO  medical monitor prior to 
making the change or within 48 hours of making the change. Of note, the sponsor defers the final 
decision to adjust IP to the treating
 clinician; dose changes may not exceed the maximum daily 
dose defined by the protocol. For any subject who is unable to be maintained at the minimum 
dose, the investigator should contact the sponsor to discuss continue
d investigational product 
dosing. Subjects who discontinue IP shoul d undergo a 2-week taper period, unless otherwise 
medically indicated.  Subjects who discontinue
 IP treatment before the completion of  the DB 
phase will continue to be followed per protocol and, at a minimum, subjects will be encouraged 
to maintain daily seizure eDiary ent
ries until the DB phase is completed.  These subjects should 
also re
turn to the site after the taper for safety follow-up post-taper assessments.

medically acceptable method of birth control inc
ludes intrauterine devices in place for at 
least 3 months prior to the screening visit, surgical sterilization, or adequate barrier 
methods ( eg, diaphragm or condom and foam).  An oral contraceptive alone is not 
considered adequate for the purpose
 of this study.  Use of oral contraceptives in 
combination with another method (eg, a spermicidal cream) is acceptable.  In subjects 
who are not sexually active, abstinence is an acceptable form. 
4.2. Exclusion Criteria

4.4.1. Contraception 
Sexually active fe
males of childbearing potential should be using a medically acceptable form of 
birth control.  Females of childbea
ring potential must be advised to use medically acceptable 
birth control throughout the study period and for 30 da
ys after the last dose of IP.  If hormonal 
contraceptives are used, they should be administered per the package insert.   
Females of childbearing potential 
who are not currently sexually active, but who become 
sexually active during th
e period of the study and 30 days after the last dose of IP must agree to 
use acceptable contraception, as de
fined below: 
 Premenarchal and either Tanner stage 1 or < 9 years or age, or  
 S urgically sterile (having undergone 1 of the following surgical acts:  hysterectomy, bilateral 
tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectom
y, or bilateral salpingectomy) and at least 8 weeks’ post-
sterilization, or

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
 Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control only if this is in line with the preferred 
and usual lifestyle of the subject.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.  
 Medically acceptable methods of birth control include: 
a. Intrauterine device plus condoms 
b. Double-barrie
r methods ( eg, condoms and diaphragm with spermicidal gel or 
foam) 
c. Hormonal contraceptives (oral, patch, injectable, or vaginal ring), stabili zed for at 
least 1 month prior to screening visit, plus condoms.  Note:  I f a subject  becomes 
sexually active during the study, she should use 1 of the other acceptable  methods 
noted above in addition to the hormonal contraceptive until it has bee
n stabilized 
for 30 days prior to screening visit.   
4.5. Discontinuation of Subjects 
A subject may withdraw — or their parent/LAR may withdraw the subject — from the  study at 
any time for any reason without prejudic
e to their future medical care by the physician or a t the 
hospital.  The PI  or sponsor may withdraw the subject at any time (eg, in the interest of subj ect 
safet
y).  The PI is encouraged to discuss withdrawal of a subject from IP with the medic al 
moni
tor when possible. 
Subjects who discontinue IP treatment before the completion of the DB phase will conti nue to be 
followed per protocol and, at a minimum, subjects will be encouraged to maintain dail y seizure 
e
Diary entries until the DB phase is completed.  These subjects should also return to the  site after 
the taper for safety follow-up post taper a
ssessments (Section 7.2.7).   
If the IP is disconti
nued at any time, subjects should follow the 2-week taper schedule, unless 
otherwise medically indicated (Section 7.2.6)
.  If the subject discontinues during the OL pha se, 
evaluations listed for the Taper Visit are to be performe
d as completely as possible.  W henever 
possible, all subjects who discontinue should also undergo the pr
otocol-specified Safet y Follow-
up Post-Taper visit (Section 7.2.7).  Comments (spontaneous or elicited) or complaints made  by 
the subject m
ust be recorded in the source documents.  The reason for termination, date of  
stopping IP, and total amount of IP taken must be recorded in the electronic case report f orm 
(eCRF) a
nd source documents.  Discontinuation of IP due to AEs must also be reflected on the  
AE eCRF page. 
4.5.1. Subject Withd
rawal Criteria 
All subjects or her parent/LAR reserve the
 right to withdraw from the clinical study at any time, 
as stated in the informed consent/assent form.  The PI may discontinue subjects from the clinical 
study for any of the following reasons: 
 Subjec
t is found to have entered the study in violation of the protocol; 
 Subject requires the use of a disallowed concomitant medication; 
 Subject’s condition changes after entering the clinical investigation so that the subject no 
long
er meets the inclusion criteria or develops any of the exclusion criteria; 
 
Confidential Page 76 of 136  
 IND 044020   Marinus Ph armaceuticals Inc.  
Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
 Subject or parent/LAR withdraws consent or assent to participate in the study; 
 Subject is noncompliant with the procedures set forth in the protocol; 
 Subject ex
periences an AE/SAE that warrants withdrawal from the study; 
 I
t is the PI ’s opinion that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue in the study; 
 Subject has an AST or ALT increase > 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) during the study.  
NOTE :  If this occurs, th
e subject should be followed with weekly laboratory repeat testing 
and continue in the study if levels are trending down.  Discontinuation of treatment should be 
considered 
if levels do not decline to under 3 x ULN and if presented with the appearance of 
fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or 
eosinophilia (>5%) and if there are no initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum ALP) or 
other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased ALT or AST and total 
bilirubin, such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; preexisting or acute liver disease; or another drug 
capable of causing the observed injury; or 
 Subject has a total bilirubin increase to 1.5 x ULN or more during study.  NOTE :  if this 
oc
curs, the subject should be followed with weekly laboratory repeat testing and continue in 
the study if levels are trending down.  Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if 
levels do not decline
 to under 1.5 x ULN within the time period that is considered reasonably 
safe per PIs’ judgment.  Laboratory, medical, or clinical finding for which clinical 
intervention should take precedence over study participation. 
Decisions to discontinue the study will be made at each participating site by the PI.  If feasible, 
the reason for discontinuation should be discussed with the sponsor’s medical monitor prior to 
subject discontinuation.  Subjects who discontinue IP during the DB phase will continue to 
record da
ily seizure frequency at minimum until the completion of the DB phase. 
I
f a subject must be abruptly discontinued from the investigational product (e.g., severe rash), 
careful attention should be paid for the possibility of withdrawal symptoms such as increase in 
seizure number or severity.   Consideration should be made by the investigator for providing 
another GABA A receptor modulator medication for 1-2 weeks such as clobazam to mitigate the 
potential risk of withdrawal from a positive modulator of GABA A receptors.   
4.5.2. Reasons for Early Discontinuation 
The reason for
 early discontinuation must be determined by the PI and recorded in the subject’s 
source docume
nts and on the eCRF.  If a subject is withdrawn for more than 1 reason, each 
reason should be do
cumented in the source document and the most clinically relevant reason 
should be entered on the eCRF.   
Reasons for early termination include but are not limited to the following: 
 Adverse event in which the character, severity or frequency is new in comparison to the 
subje
ct’s existing risk profile with the exception of somnolence and seizures.   
 An Adverse Event that is associated with non-reversible target organ dysfunction, with the 
associated labor
atory abnormalities as defined in exclusion criteria 11, 12 or 13.  An 
allowance may be made for continued treatment if the abnormality is not medically

significant (non-life-threatening or does not require ongoing treatment that could be life-
threatening)   
 A laboratory abnorma
lity or vital sign change that is irreversible and considered medically 
significant, associated with use of the investiga
tional product 
 Protocol violation/protocol deviation 
 Withdrawal by subject or parent/LAR 
 Lost to follow-up 
 Lack of eff
icacy 

 Death 
 Phy
sician decision 
 Other (must be specified in the subj
ect source document and eCRF)  
 Pregnancy  
4.5.3. Subje
cts Lost to Follow-u
p Prior to Last Scheduled Visit 
A minimum of 3 documented attempts must be ma
de to contact any subject lost to follow-up at 
any time point prior to the last scheduled contact (office
 visit or telephone contact).  At least 1 of 
these documented attempts must include a wr
itten communication sent to the subject’s last 
known address via courier or mail (with an acknowledgment of receipt request) asking that she 
return to the site for fina l safety e
valuations and return any unused IP.  If contact is made but the 
subject refuses or is una ble to return to the site for the final Safety Follow-up Post-Taper visit 
(Section 7.2.7), it shoul d be documented in the 
eCRF. 
4.6. Subject N umbering 
During the scre
ening  visit and after consent is obtained, each subject will be assigned a unique 
6-digit subject number by the IWRS.  The subject number will consist of a 3-digit clinical 
investigational site number assigned by
 the sponsor, followed by a 3-digit subject number 
(eg, 001) assigned by the IWRS.  This subject number will also serve as the screening number.  
A separate randomization number will be
 assigned once the subject is randomized, but the 
randomization number will not be used to track the subjec
t.  The unique 6-digit subject number 
will serve as the subject number and be used to t
rack the subject throughout the study.  Each 
randomized 
subject ’s number will correspond with a treatment (active or PBO) as determined by 
the randomization schedule.   
The cli
nical site is responsible for maintaining a
 current log of subject number assignments and 
bottle numbers of the IP administered to each subject.  The unique subject number is required to 
be entered on all clinical investig
ation documentation (eCRFs, labeling of clinical materials and 
samples containers, drug accountability logs, etc.).

5. EXCLUDED, PRIOR, AND CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS 
The study physician should assess all concomitant medications at  every visit, and at the 
scre
ening visit in particular to ensure that the subject is not taking excluded medications.   
5.1. Prior 
Medications 
Prior medications include all treatment, including but not limited to herbal treatments, vitamins, 
surgical implants (such as VNS), and prescribed medications received within 30 days (or PK 
equivalent of 5 half
-lives, whichever is longer) of the date prior to screening.  Prior treatment 
information, if avail
able, must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. 
5.2. Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications refer to all treatment taken between the date of the first dose of IP and 
the date of the last dose
 of IP.  Concomitant treatment information must be recorded on the 
appropriate e
CRF page.  Concomitant as needed (PRN) topical and intranasal steroids for 
dermatologic reactions and allergic rhinitis are allowed and do not warrant exclusion from study.  
If the subject is currently taking an excluded medication at the time of the screening visit, then 
the subject must undergo a washout period equivalent to 5 half-lives of the drug before they may 
enter the prospective 12-week baseline period. 
Concomitant medica
tions, other than AEDs, may be reduced or discontinued at the discretion of 
the investigator if medically warranted. 
5.2.1.  Concomitant Antiepileptic (AED) Medications 
Concomitant AED regimens must have been stable for at least 1 month prior to the screening 
visit and must remain stable from screening to the end of the DB phase. Ketogenic diets and 
modified Atkins diets
 should be unchanged for 3 months prior to the screening visit and must 
remain stable throu
ghout baseline and the DB phase. 
Subjects with surgically implanted VNS will be allowed to enter the study provided that all of 
the following conditions are met: 
 The VNS has been in place for ≥ 1 yea r prior to the screening visit. 
 The settings must have remained constant for 3 months prior to the screening visit and 
remain consta
nt throughout baseline and the DB phase. 
 The battery is expected to last for the duration of baseline and the DB phase. 
Conc
omitant AEDs ma
y be reduced or discontinued at the discretion of the investigator if 
medically warranted. 
5.3. Rescue Medications 
The use of rescue medication is allowed on an occasional basis and as medically needed.  The 
type, dose
, date, and frequency will be recorded.

5.4. Excluded Medications 
Excluded medications include oral steroid medications, other IPs, ketoconazole and other 
investigational drugs or devices.  Use
 of St.  John’s Wort and concurrent use of strong inducers 
or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5/7 is not pe rmitted.  A list of CYP3A4/5/7 inhi
bitors and inducers is 
included in Section 12.1.  Any stron g
 inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A4/5/7 must be discontinued 
at least 28 days before Ba
seline/Randomi zation Visit; note that this does not apply to approved 
AED medications. 
Products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or non-approved CBD are excluded in the DB  
phase of the study but allowed in the OL phase.  T
HC or non-approved CBD should be washed 
out for at lea
st 2 weeks before
 screening.  Subjects with a positive result on THC or non-
approved cannabidiol CBD test (via plasma
 drug screen) can be retested, via plasma, after 2 
weeks.  
Note that if a subject is taking
 marke ted E
pidiolex (may go by another name in countries outside 
the United States) then the parent/car
egiver will have to provide evidence of an active 
prescription or confirmation from prescriber.

6. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 
Both GNX and PBO will be packaged in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with a child 
resistant closure. 
GNX will be supplied at a concentration of 50 mg/mL (GNX equivalent) in 120 mL bottles, 
containing 110 mL GNX.  A PBO suspension, which is identical in taste and appearance, will be 
supplied at an equal volume. 
All IP will be labeled according to regional regulatory requirements.  At minimum, labels will 
contain the study number; a blinded bottle number; contents including quantity; dose and form; 
route of administration; storage conditions; instructions for IP administration; caution that this 
compound is an inve
stigative drug intended for clinical trial use only; warning to keep out of 
reach of children; and the identity of manufacturer and sponsor.  For those regions that require it, 
a blinded lot number and an expiry date will also be listed. 
All IP will be stored at the research pharmacy prior to dispensing, or in a locked cabinet 
accessi
ble only to members of the investigative research team after the completion of each study 
visit.  Study medication should be stored at room temperature 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F).

6.2. Administration of Investigational Products 
6.2.1. Interactive Web Response System for Investigational Product Management 
For the DB  pha
se and the titration period of the OL phase and thereafter an IWRS will be 
utilized for
 the following IP tasks: 
 Randomization 
 Supply
 management 
 Inventory management and supply ordering 
 Expirati
on date tracking 
 Emerg
ency unblinding 
6.2.2. Allocation of
 Su bjects to Treatment  
Subjects will be stratified into 2 groups during the Screening period as either Allo-S biomarker-
positive or A
llo-S biomarker-negative. A subject will be considered biomarker-positive if her 
baseline Allo-S level is less than or equal to 2500 pg/mL.  Eligible subjects will then be 
randomly a
ssigned at a 1:1 ratio (GNX:PBO) based on a randomization schedule at Visit 2 
(Week 0).  Onl
y the IP supplier and the sponsor’s IP mana ger will be unblinded as to the 
contents of each bottle of IP.  Study staff as well as subject and caregiver will be blinded to 
treatment assi
gnments. In addition, the biomarker group assignment will remain blinded until 
database unblinding after the study has completed. 
An IWRS will centrally randomize subjects.  The randomization schedule will be generated 
using a standard, v
alidated method and maintained by the IWRS vendor and an unblinded 
statistician.  The PI  will be instructed by the IWRS, which numbered bottle to use to dose a 
subject.  The
 PI and research staff will be aware of the ascending dose design of the clinical 
investiga
tion; however, the PI, the research staff, and the subjects will be blinded with respect to 
who is receiving active drug versus PBO.   
The contents of each bottle will be blinded using labels.  The IWRS will use the randomization 
schedule to match a subj
ect number to a bottle number.  Upon completion of baseline evaluations 
for each subject, the PI or appropriate designee will log into the IWRS to receive assigned 
bottle(s).  Compl
ete instructions for obtaining a bottle number will be provided to the clinical 
sites prior to init
iating the study.  The designated personnel  at the clinical site will match the 
assi
gned bottle number with the correct bottle of IP and distribute the bottle to the PI or designee .   
6.2.3. Dosing 
6.2.3.1. Double-
Blind Period 
Ganaxolone is to be administered in increments of 15 mg/kg/day up to 63 mg/kg/day (maximum 
1800 mg/day) 
given as an oral suspension with food.  Any subject not tolerating the next dose 
level can be maintained at the lower dose for additional days before advancing to next dose.  If 
the next dose level is s
till not tolerated, the subject can drop back to the last tolerated dose.  A 
minimum dose of 33 mg/kg/day or 900 mg/day is generally required following the DB escalation 
 
Confidential Page 82 of 136

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
period, unless a lower dose is agreed to with the Sponsor due to tolerability issues such as 
somnolence.  Dose changes, including alternative
 dosing paradigm (e.g., lower dose during the 
daytime and higher dose in the evening
) should be discussed with the CRO/sponsor medical 
monitor prior to making the change or within 48 hours of makin
g the change. Of note,  the 
sponsor defers the final decision to adjust IP to the trea
ting study clinician; dose changes may not 
excess the maximum total daily dose defined by the protocol.  At each visit, dosing will be 
reviewed and adjusted as needed ba
sed on subject’s current weight. Dosing for subjects weighing 
≤ 28 kg and > 28 kg is described in Table 3.

Investigational product may be stopped immediately and without down-titration in the case  of an 
emergency, although a down titration in the event of an e arly termination is recommended.  Dose 
de-escalation (taper) will occur in decreasing increments of 15 mg/kg/day or 450 mg/day 
approximately every 3 days ove
r 2 weeks whenever feasible (See Section 6.2.3.3  for more 
details). Taper is not re
quired if the subject is rece
iving the dose of 18 mg/kg/day or 450 mg /day 
(or lower). 
6.2.3.2. Open-Label Period 
Foll
owing the completion of the 17-week, DB phase, subjects randomized to PBO will transition 
to GNX, whereas subjects randomized to GNX will sta
y on their MTD (minimum of 33 
mg/kg/day [900 mg/day]; maximum of 63 mg/kg/day [1800 mg/day]) in a blinded fashion.   
Subjects will begin the 4-week blinded dose titrati
on up to 63 mg/kg/day or 1800 mg/day (or 
MTD) after completing Visit 5.  To maintain the blind of the DB phase, subjects initially 
randomized to GNX will undergo a blinded titration (increasing PBO doses) for 4 weeks, while

 IND 044020   Marinus Ph armaceuticals Inc.  
Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
PBO subjects will titrate up to 63 mg/kg/day GNX (1800 mg/day maximum or MTD) during the 
same time period.   
Dosing transition from DB to OL for subje
cts weighing ≤ 28 kg and > 28 kg is described in 
Table 4. All subjects will be dispensed 2 groups of bottles:   Bottle Group A (Maintenance) and 
Bottle Group B (T itration).  In addit
ion to the maintenance dose from Bottle Group A, subjects 
will be instructed to take a second dose from Bott
le Group B: 
 Subjects initially randomized to GNX:  Bottle Group A will contain GNX ; Bottle Group 
B will c
ontain PBO. 
 Subjects initially randomized to PBO:  Bottle Group A will contain PBO ; Bottle Group B 
will contain GNX.   
Dosing from both Bottle Gr
oup A and Bottle Group B will begin at the end of Visit 5 (Week 17), 
the last visit in the DB phase, and continue until the end of the OL 4-week titration period, when 
subjects return to t
he site for evaluation (Visit 7, Week 21).  Subjects will have an interim safety 
visit at Visit 6 (Week 19), 2 weeks after starting th
e OL phase, in which they will receive a new 
set of medication bott
les.

6.2.3.3. De-escalation (Taper) Period  
Any subject who completes the study or discontinues IP treatment at any time during the study 
should undergo a
 2-week drug de-escalation (taper) period.  The schedule will be dependent on 
the maintenance dose.  Typically, doses will be reduced by 15 mg/kg/day or 450 mg/day 
approximatel
y eve ry 3 days until the subject is completely off IP.  Subjects should then return for 
a Safety
 Follow-up Post-Taper visit. Taper is not required if the subject is receiving the dose of 
18 mg/kg/day
 or 450 mg/day (or lower).

6.2.4.  Dose Administration 
Investigational product will be provided as an oral suspension.  Ganaxolone must be taken 
with a meal or snack .  
Note :  Grapefruit and grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, star fruit, and 
gr
apefruit containing products are prohibited 14 days prior to 1st dose and for the duration of the 
study 
Ganaxolone oral suspension  will be administered through an oral dosing syringe administered 
by parents/caregivers 3 times daily (TID), following the morning, noon, and evening meal or 
snack.  Each dose should be separated by a minimum of 4 hours and a maximum o f 12 hours.  A 
missed dose of IP may
 be taken up to 4 hours before the next scheduled dose; otherwise, the 
missed dose should not be giv
en.  Subjects and their parent or legal guardian will be informed 
about possible side effects from the IP and cautioned to avoid quick postural changes, at least 
until they know how the IP affects them.  Subjects will be advised that the IP might affect mental 
aler
tness.  They will also be cautioned that non-adherence to the dosing instructions (eg, 
increasing the dose or ta
king the IP doses too close together) could produce side effects.   
6.2.5.  Missing a Dose 
Ganaxolone oral suspension:  A missed dose of IP may be taken up to 4 hours before the next 
scheduled dose; otherwise, the missed dose should not be given. 
Parents/caregivers should be instructed that if the subject misses IP 2 days in a row or more, the 
site should be c
ontacted to determine whether any adjustment in IP is needed. The site will 
confer with the
 medical monitor to devise a dosing plan.   
Parents/caregivers should be instructed to minimize the number of missed doses the subject 
experienc
es and be re-educated on proper dosing procedures at each visit to ensure that missed 
doses are avoided.

If it is deemed necessary to unblind a subject’s treatment in order to provide medical 
management of an AE or to provide emergency treatment, unblinding will be conducted through 
the IWRS
.  Unblinding should only occur if necessary, for the medical management of the 
subject.  The
 sponsor’s Medical Monitor does not have to be contacted to initiate unblinding in 
the IWRS
 system. Prior to unblinding or immediately following, the sponsor’s Medical Monitor 
must be contacted.  Subjects who are unblinded during the DB phase will be discontinued from

6.4.1. Labeling 
Labe
ls containing study information and bottle identification are applied to the IP container.   
All IP is l
abeled with a minimum of the following:  protocol number, medication identification 
number (if applicable), dosage form (including product name and quantity in pack), directions 

 
Confidential Page 86 of 136  
 IND 044020   Marinus Ph armaceuticals Inc.  
Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
for use, storage conditions, batch number and/or packaging reference, the statements “For 
investigational use only” and/or “Caution:  New Drug—Limited by Federal (or US) Law to 
Investigational Use” and “Keep out of reach of children,” and the sponsor’s name and address.  
Additional labe
ls may, on a case- by-case basis, be applied to the IP in order to satisfy local or 
hospital require
ments, but must not: 
 Contradict the clinical study label 
 Obscure the clinical study label 
 Identify the study subject by name, without consultation with the sponsor 
Additional labels may not be added without the sponsor’s prior full agreement. 
6.4.2. Packaging 
Investi
gational product will be supplied as an oral suspension.  The suspension formulation can 
be used for subje
cts regardless of weight.   
IP will be provided to the site as individual bottles containing 110 mL in 120-mL HDPE bottles 
at a concentra
tion of 50 mg/mL.   
Changes to sponsor-supplied packaging prior to dosing may not occur without full agreement in 
advance by the sponsor. 
6.4.3. Storage 
The PI  has overall responsibility for ensuring that IP is store d in a secure, limited-access 
location.  L
imited responsibility may be delegated to the pharmacy or member of the study team, 
but this delegation must be documented.  Investigational products are distributed by the 
pharmacy or by a nominated member of the study team.   
Investigational product should be stored at room temperature 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). 
I
nvestigational product must be stored in accordance with labeled storage conditions.  
Temperature monitoring of the IP is required at the storage location to ensure that the IP is 
maintained within an establis
hed temperature range.  The PI is responsible for ensuring that the 
temperature is m
onitored throughout the duration of the study and that records are maintained; 
the temperature should be monitored continuously by an in-house system, by a mechanical 
recording device such as a calibrated chart recorder, or by manual means, such that both 
minimum and maximum thermometric values over a specific time period can be recorded and 
retrieved as required.  Such a device (i.e., certified min/max thermometer) would require manual 
resetting upon each recording.  The sponsor must be notified immediately upon discovery of any 
excursion from the e
stablished range.  Temperature excursions will require site investigation as 
to cause and remediation.  The sponsor will determine the ultimate impact of excursions on the 
IP and will provide supportive documentation as necessary.  Under no circumstances should the 
product be dispensed to subjects until the impact has been determined and the product is deemed 
appropriate for
 use by the sponsor. 
The sponsor should be notified immediately if there are any changes to the storage area of the IP 
that could affect the integrity of the product(s), such as fumigation of a storage room.

6.5. Investigational Product Accountability 
Investigators will be provided with sufficient amounts of the IP to carry out this protocol for the 
agreed numbe
r of subjects.  The PI  or designee will acknowledge receipt of the IP, documenting 
shipme
nt content and condition.  Accurate records of all IP dispensed, used, returned, and/or 
destroyed mus
t be maintained as detailed further in this section. 
The PI has overall responsibility for administering/dispensing IP.  Where permissible, tasks may 
be delega
ted to a qualified designee ( eg, a pharmacist) who is adequately trained in the protocol 
and who works under the dire
ct supervision of the PI.  This delegation must be documented in 
the applicable 
study delegation of authority form. 
The PI  or their designee (as documented by the PI in t he applicable study delegation of authority 
form) will administer and/or dispense the IP only to subjects included in this study following the 
procedures set out i
n the study protocol.  Each subject will be given only the IP carr ying her 
treatment assignment.  All administered and/or dispensed IP will be documented on the eCRF s 
and/or othe
r IP record.  The PI is responsible for ensuring the retriev al of all IP and study 
supplies from subjec
ts.   
The subject’ s pa
rent/caregiver must be instructed to save and bring their unused IP and 
empty/used IP packaging to the clinic and final follow-up visit or to ship it back to the site via 
secure c
ourier.  Investigational product accountability must be assessed at the 
container/packaging level for unused IP that is contained within the original tamper-evident 
sealed containe
r (eg, bottles) or at the individual count level for opened containers/packaging.  
The pharmacist/nominated person will record details on the IP accountability form. 
No IP stock or returned inventory from a Marinus-sponsored study may be removed from the site 
where origin
ally shipped without prior knowledge and consent by the sponsor.  If such transfer is 
authorized by
 the sponsor, all applicable local, state, and national laws must be adhered to for the 
transfer. 
The sponsor or its representatives must be permitted access to review the supplies storage and 
distribution procedures and records.  
At the end of the study, or as instructed by the sponsor, all unused stock, subject-returned, or 
expired IP are either to be sent to a nominated contractor on behalf of the sponsor for destruction 
or are to be
 destroyed by the site.  Investigational products being returned to the sponsor’s 
designate
d contractors or approved to be destroyed by the site counted/measured and verified 
will be rec
onciled by clinical site personnel and the sponsor (or designated CRO ).  Shipment 
return forms, when used, will be signed prior to shipment from the site.  Returned IPs will be 
packed in a ta
mper-evident manner to ensure product integrity.  Shipment of all returned IP must 
comply with loc
al, state, and national laws. 
With the written agreement of the sponsor, unused stock, subject-returned, and expired IP may 
be destroye
d at the site or a local facility.  In this case, destruction records identifying what was 
destroyed, when, and how must be obtained with copies provided to the sponsor.  Destruction of 
IPs must be in accordance with local, state, and national laws.

Based on entries in the site ’s drug accountability forms, it must be possible to reconcile IPs 
delivered with those used and returned.  All IPs must be accounted for and all discrepancies 
investig
ated and documented to the sponsor’s satisfaction. 
6.6. Subject Compliance 
Subject compliance will be tracked through the electronic seizure and medication diary.  
Parent/c
aregiver are to record daily seizure frequency and type in addition to study medication 
and non-study AED administration.  Compliance with IP treatment will be monitored by 
inspecting the e
lectronic diary entries and returned supplies with queries as necessary.  As a 
generally accepted guideline, subjects should remain 80% compliant with diary entries. 
Parents/caregivers who fall short of this standard will be re-educated on the importance of 
adhering to dail
y seizure, IP and non-study AED recording and a deviation recorded.

In the event of unforeseen circumstances, in-person study visi t assessments may not be able to be 
performed. To conduct the study acco
rding to protocol while preserving patient safety, 
operational alternatives such as those listed below can be employed as long as the site’s actions 
are in compliance with the institution’s IRB/EC policies and regulations.  
 Telemedicine visits (video and/or audio communication methods)

7.2. Study Procedures (Doubl
e-Blind Phase) 
7.2.1. Pre-Screen/Screen/Baseline 
7.2.1.1. Historical Se
izure Type and Frequency and/or Genetic Testing (Pre-Baseline 
Screening Visit (Visit 0))
 
Potential subjects will have already been p
re-identified by the site because of confirmed or 
suspected PCDH19 genetic mutation testing as part of their standard of care epilepsy work-up.   
It is also very common that parents/care
givers/LARs of PCDH19-related epilepsy subjects 
maintain daily seizure calendars, which capture
 both seizure type and frequency and days when 
no seizures occur as part of their standard of care treatment regimen.  A 12-week daily historical 
seizure calendar will be reviewed 
at the screening visit to determine eligibility per 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Acceptable daily historical seizure calendars will need to denote 
seizure types, frequency, 
and days that no seizures occurred. 
If genetic testing is not done as Standard of Care, a pre-screen visit will be scheduled where 
informed consent/assent is obtained to complete the ge
netic testing. If genetic testing results are 
available per SOC, the genetic testing will
 be done at screening to confirm the results by the 
Sponsors designated lab.  
Procedures specific to this protocol and not otherwise considered standard of care, will not be 
performed until written informed consent (and subject assent) from the subject’s parent or legal 
guardian has been appropriately obt
ained.  In the event that parents/caregivers/LAR do not 
routinely maintain a daily seizure c
alendar or in a situation where the child’s PCDH19-related 
epilepsy diagnosis has not been c
onfirmed with genetic testing per standard of care, written 
informed consent/assent will be obtained and the subje
ct will be asked to return to the clinic for 
the Screening (Visit 1) after she has maintained a 12-week daily historical seizure calendar 
and/or completed genetic testing.

7.2.1.2. Screening Visit – Start to Baseline (Visit 1, Week –12) 
Additional procedures/as
sessments to be completed during the screening period may include the 
following: 
 In
formed consent from parent/LAR (or subject assent) 
 De
mographics and medical history 
 Historical seizure calendar review 
 Review of inclusion/exclusion criteria 
 Genetic testing to confirm pathogenic or likely pathogenic PCDH19  variant  by Sponsor 
identified lab, if not done at pre
screening.  
 Seizure Identification and Diagnostic Review Form (SIF/DRF) (Epilepsy Study Consortium) 
 Vital signs
 (to include BP, HR, RR, body temperature, weight, and height) 
 P
hysical, neurological, and developmental examination 
 Clinical laboratory tests (to include complete blood count [CBC] with automated differential, 
cre
atinine, blood urea nitrogen, and comprehensive metabolic panel) 
 Urinalysis (An attempt should be made to collect a urine sample at this screening visit.  
Otherwise, the u
rine sample can be collected at baseline) 
 Drug screen (plasma) 
 S
erum pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential  
 Tanner sta
ging 
 Concomi
tant AED review and levels if per standard of care (SOC) 
 Neurosteroid lev

 Electronic
 seizure and medication diary set up and review 
A screen failure is a subject for whom full informed consent/assent has been obtained and has 
failed to meet the inclusion criteria and/or met at least 1 of the exclusion criteria and has not been 
administere
d the IP. 
Subject rescr
eening is allowed as agreed by Sponsor and PI unless there is a general concern for 
subject sa
fety or an inability for the subject to become eligible (eg, GNX allergy, sensitivity or 
exposure, non-PCDH19 and/or other ineligible epilepsy, chronic prohibited medical condition or 
treatment).  Subsequent screening should take place at least 30 days from the subject’s last visit. 
If a subject fails 
to qualify because of Exclusion Criteria #4 (≤ 3 primary seizures during the 
12-week baseline period), she will not be randomized. However, she can be rescreened after 
collecti
ng another
 12 or more weeks of seizure history that satisfies all eligibility criteria 
including Inclusion Criteria #5 and Exclusion Criteria #3. Each subject is allowed a maximum of 
1 rescreening visit. 
7.2.1.3. Baseline Visit – Randomization (Visit 2, Week 0 + 6 days) 
The following study pro
cedures/assessments to be completed, the results received, and the 
investigator must ensure the subject meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to IP 
administrati
on. The 12 weeks between Screening and Randomization can be no less than 84 days 
and no more
 than 90 days.

7.3. Screening and Diagnosis 
Potential subjects will be pre-identified by the site because of confirmed or suspected PCDH19 
genetic mutation
 testing as part of their standard of care epilepsy work-up.  Potential subjects 
will
 have historical seizure diary charting 12 weeks prior to screening.  Eligible historical seizure 
diaries will need to include daily logs of seizure types and frequency and denote the absence of 
seizures on those
 days where no seizures occurred.

 IND 044020   Marinus Ph armaceuticals Inc.  
Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
7.3.1.  Informed Consent / Assent 
Procedures sp
ecific to this protocol and not otherwise considered standard of care, will not be 
performed until written informed consent/Assent from the subject/parent/caregiver/LAR has 
been appropriately obtained.   
7.3.2. Drug Screen 
A drug sc
reen (plasma) will be performed to test for THC and non-approved CBD during the DB 
phase at Visit 1 (screening), Visit 2 (baseline/randomization), and Visit 5 (final DB/first OL 
visit).  If the screening drug test is positive at Visit 1 (screening), a confirmatory retest, via 
plasma, will be perf
ormed after 2 weeks. A  drug screen may be  performed at any time at 
Investigator’s discretion.  A positive drug test during the DB phase will result in early 
termination.
 
7.3.3. Demographics and Medical History 
Demographics includi
ng age, gender, ethnicity and race will be collected. In addition to the 
genetic confirmation of pathogenic or likely pathogenic PCDH19  variant, relevant medical 
history, including but not limited to the age of seizure onset, other physical disabilities such as 
scoliosis, visual impairment, sensory problems and gastrointestinal difficulties will also be 
assessed; the subject’s developmental history will also be assessed.  Demographics and Medical 
History will be reviewed and collected at the Visit 1 (screening).  A review of the subject’s 
Medical History will be performed again at Visit 2 (baseline/randomization ). 
7.3.4. Historical Seizure Calendar Review 
It is ver
y common for parent/caregivers/LARs to maintain daily seizure calendars for this subject 
population, which capture both seizure type and frequency.  A 12-week historical seizure 
calendar wil
l be reviewed at the screening visit to determine eligibility per inclusion/exclusion 
criteria.  Acceptable historical seizure calendars will need to denote both seizure type and 
frequenc
y and days that no seizures occur. 
In the event the subject is not able to provide eligible historical seizure diary (at least 12 weeks 
prior to screening), the informed consent/assent will need to be obtained and the parent/caregiver 
will need to chart prospective
ly.   
7.3.5. Genetic Testing 
Molecular con
firmation of a pathogenic or likely pathogenic PCDH19  mutation is required.  
Gene
tic mutations will be confirmed by the sponsor’s chosen central laboratory.  The PI must 
review the results of the genetic analysis and confirm that the causal relationship to the epilepsy 
syndrome is likely.  If the subject has a de novo PCDH19 VUS then the central assessor, PI, and 
Sponsor will review study inclusion. Some subjects may have multiple PCDH19 mutations that 
include both VUS a
nd pathogenic variants.  In these cases, the subject is known to have a 
pathogenic variant and is elig
ible (does not require discussion with expert).

 IND 044020   Marinus Ph armaceuticals Inc.  
Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
In the event that parents/caregivers/LAR do not have genetic testing results with a confirmed 
PCDH19-related epilepsy diagnosis per standard of care, written informed consent/assent will be 
obtained.  
Instructions for genetic testing sample collection and processing can be found in the central 
laboratory manual. 
7.3.6. Seizure Identification and Diagnostic Review 
Per the inclusi
on criteria, enrollment into the study will be based on the presence and frequency 
of all countable focal seizures that include progressive hypotonia and impaired awareness, or any 
countable focal or generalized seizure with a clear motor component.   
To standardize seizure identification and classification in the study, a SIF/DRF will be submitted 
and reviewed by the Epilepsy Study Consortium.  Approval of the SIF/DRF will be required 
prior to randomization.  In addition to this form, videos of the subject’s seizure types will also be 
reviewed to confirm proper classification provided that the parent/caregiver is able to capture 
video of these seizure types, parents/caregivers are able to provide videos to the site for upload 
onto a secure encrypted server in a manner consistent with ICH/GCP and if local IRB/EC 
regulations grants approval for collection of such videos.  Parents/caregivers must make every 
effort to capture
 1 example of each of the primary seizure types that their child experiences.  
Although it is acknowled
ged that some seizure types (e.g., atonic/drop seizures) may be more 
difficult to capture
 on video, this information will provide valuable verification of this seizure 
type and the attempt should be made. 
Instructions for completion of the SIF/DRF and submission of videos can be found in the 
Investigator Site File. 
7.4. Efficacy Assessments 
Efficacy as determined by a reduction in seizures will be  evaluated by collecting daily seizure 
ty
pe and frequency in an electronic seizure diary.   
7.4.1. Seizure Type and Frequency 
Parent/
caregiver/LAR will record daily seizure frequency denoting seizure type and frequency in 
an electronic seizure diary (eDiary).  In rare cases when an eDiary completion is not feasible, a 
paper diary will be used to log daily seizure type and frequency.  These cases will need approval 
by the sponsor.  Primary seizure types of c ountable focal seizures that include progressive 
hypotonia a
nd impaired awareness, or any countable focal or generalized seizure with a clear 
motor component, will be
 counted towards the primary endpoint.   
Subjects or pare
nt/caregiver/LAR are to record administration of IP and background AEDs in the 
eDiary/seiz
ure calendar.  Compliance with IP treatment will be assessed by inspecting the 
subjects’ eDiar
y/seizure calendar and returned supplies with queries as necessary. As a generally 
accepted guideline, subjects should re
main 80% compliant with diary entries. Parents/caregivers 
who fall short of this standard will be re-educated on the importance of adhering to daily seizure, 
IP and non-study AED recording and a deviation recorded.

 IND 044020   Marinus Ph armaceuticals Inc.  
Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
For recording of seizures in the eDiary, seizure events will be recorded either as a countable 
seizure or a series of continuous uncountable seizures.  Both of these events will be counted as 1 
seizure (equally weighted) in the e
fficacy analysis. 
A seizure cluster will be defined as 3 or more
 seizure events (either a countable or a series of 
continuous uncountable seizures), occurring
 within a period of time, followed by a period of at 
least 24 hours of seizure-freedom.  For e
xample (Figure 2):  
1. If a child experiences 3 seizure events at 5:00, 5:30, and 6:00 PM on Monday, and the 
next seizure event occurs before 6:00 PM on Tues
day, the Monday and Tuesday seizure 
events are considered part of the same seizure cluster ( Figure 2, Scenario 1).   
2. If a child experiences 3 seizure events at 5:00, 5:30, and 6:00 PM on Monday, and the 
next seizure event occurs at 6:00 PM or later on Tue
sday, the Tuesday seizure event is 
not considered part of the same cluster ( Figure 2 , Scenario 2).

7.4.2. Rescue Medication 
The type, dose, date, and freque
ncy of rescue medication will be recorded in the eDiary and 
reviewed every visit. 
7.4.3. Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) 
The Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire
 (CSHQ) is a psychological questionnaire designed to 
measure sleep behaviors in children and adolescents.  The 33-question test is filled out by the 
parent/caregiver/LAR.   
CSHQ will
 be assessed as follows:  in the DB phase a
t Visit 2 (baseline/randomization) and Visit 
5 (Week 17; also Final DB Visit/First OL Visit in OL phase); in t
he OL phase at Visit 7 (Week 
36) and Visit 9 (Week 68) and thereafter every 16 weeks for the duration of this phase; and at the 
Final OL Visit.

7.4.4.  Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF, Preschool Version 
BRIEF-P)  
The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) is  an 86-item questionnaire 
designed to assess executive function beha
viors in the school and home environments in 
individuals 5-18 years of age.  The preschool version (BRIEF-P) is a 63-item modified form and 
is typically utilized in ind
ividuals 2-5 years of age.  For this study, the BRIEF-P will be used for

7.6.5. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Clinica
l laboratory tests are 
listed in Section 12.2 and will be collected per the schedules listed in 
Table 1 and Table 2.  If an
y test result is unexpectedly out of range, a repeat test can be 
performed at any time as decided by the PI
 to confirm the initial result. 
The following liver function and eGFR tests will be monitored throughout the study as follows.   
 If AST or ALT increases > 3 times ULN during the study, subject should be followed with 
weekly laboratory repeat testing a
nd continue in study if levels trending down.  Subject will 
be discontinued if levels do not decline to under 3 x ULN.  
 
 If total bilirubin increases to 1.5 x ULN or more during study, the subject will be 
discontinued.   
 S
ubjects with significant renal insuff
iciency, eGFR < 30 mL/min (calculated using the 
Cockcroft-Gault formula), will be disconti
nued if the criterion is met post baseline. 
If any of the criteria above are deemed clinically significant by the PI, then the sponsor’s medical 
monitor should be contacted. 
Due to the difficulty in obtaining urine samples, urinal
ysis will be conducted as follows:  during 
the DB phase at Visit 1 (screening) or baseline/randomization (Visit 2), Visit 3, and at Week 17 
(Visit 5; also Final DB  Visit/First OL Visit in OL phase); in the OL phase a t Visit 7 (Week 36), 
Visit 8 (Week 52) and annually thereafter, or at the Safety Follow-up Post-Taper visit if IP is 
discontinued; and at the Final OL Visit.  An atte
mpt will be made to collect a urine sample at 
screening to perform the study-related urina
lysis.  Otherwise, the urine sample for the urinalysis 
can be collected at baseline. 
7.6.6. Tanner Staging 
The Tanner sc
ale (also known as the Tanner stages) is a scale of physical development in 
children, adolescents, and adults.  The scale defines physical measurements of development 
based on external primary and seconda
ry sex characteristics.  Subjects will be evaluated and 
rated as Tanner I, Tanner II, Tanner III, Tanner IV, and Tanner V.  Tanner staging will occur 
during the DB phase at Visit 1 (screening)
; during the OL phase at Visit 8 (Week 52) and 
thereafter assessed annually for the dura
tion of the subject’s participation in this phase; and at the 
Final OL Visit
.

Concomitant AED levels are not mandatory but will be collected per sites’ standard of care.  If 
AED levels are considered SOC, they will be assessed as follows:  during the DB phase at Visit 
1 (scree
ning), Visit 2 (baseline/randomization), Visit 3 (Week 5), Visit 4 (Week 9), and Visit 5 
(Week 17; also Final DB Visit/First OL Visit in OL phase); in the OL phase of the study at the 
timepoints not

Taper Visit.  The results, date, and time of last AED dose and date and time of AED PK sample 
will be recorded in the eCRF. 
7.6.9. Adverse Events
 
Details regarding AEs and SAEs are provided in Secti
on 8.   
7.7. Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
A populati
on PK approach addressing the relationship between GNX PK parameters and 
individual characteristics will be implemented during the study.   
Blood sampling for PK  evaluation must be performed at the protocol-scheduled times within the 
windows specified in Table 1 and Table 2.  Exact time of
 sample withdrawal and drug intake will 
be recorded in the electronic case report form (e
CRF).  One blood sample will be obtained at the 
following visits for PK analyses: 
During the DB Phase: 

 Visit 3 (Week 5):  between 1 and 5 hours since the last investigational product dosing  
 Visit 4 (Wee
k 9):  between 4 and 8 hours since the last investigational product dosing 
During the OL Phase: 
 Visit 6 (Week 21): between 1 and 5 hour
s since the last investigational product dosing 
 Visit 8 (Week 52): between 1 and 5 hours since the last investigational product dosing 
For all other P
K draws, there is no specified time to draw the PK sample and can be drawn when 
convenient during the study visit for Visit 5 (Week 17), Visit 7 (We
ek 36), Visit 9 (Week 68), 
and every 16 weeks for the duration of the open-la
bel phase.  
Exact time of sample withdrawal and drug intake will be
 recorded in the electronic case report 
form (eCRF).

8. ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT ASSESSMENTS  
8.1. Definition of Adverse Events, Period of Observation, Recording of 
Adverse Events 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject who has been 
administered a pharmaceutica
l product; it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a n 
abnorma l laboratory finding), sympt
om, or disease temporally associated with the use of a  
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigationa l) 
product ( International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH] Guidance E2A March 1995 ).   
All AEs are collected from the time the informed consent (and subject assent) is signed unti l the 
defined follow-up period.  This includes events oc
curring during the screening phase of the  
study, re gardless of whether or not the IP has been administered.  All AEs reported after the  
initiation of IP will be considered trea
tment-emergent AEs.  Where possible, a diagnosis ra ther 
than a list of symptoms should be recorded.  
If a diagnosis has not been made, then each 
symptom should be listed individually.  All AEs should be captured on the appropriate AE  pages 
in the eCRF and in source documents.  In addition to untoward AEs, unexpected benefits outside 
the IP indication should also be captured on the AE eCRF page.   
All AEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to baseline status or all 
variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the 
study.  Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization is achieved (the PI does not 
expect any further improvement or worsening of the event), or the event is otherwise explained.  
When appropriate, medical tests a
nd examinations are performed so that resolution of event(s) 
can be documented.  
8.1.1.  Severity Categorization 
The severity of AEs must be recorded during the course of the event, including the start and stop 
dates for each change in severity.  An event that changes in severity should be captured as a new 
event.  Worsening of pretreatment events, after initiation of the IP, must be recorded as new AEs 
(eg, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dyspepsia prior to dosing of the IP, but the 
dyspepsia becomes severe
 and more frequent after the first dose of the IP has been administered, 
a new AE of severe dyspepsia [with t
he appropriate date of onset] is recorded on the appropriate 
eCRF page). 
The medical assessment of severity is determined by using the following definitions: 
Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual 
activities of daily living. 
M
oderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention.  The 
event interferes with usual activit
ies of daily living, causing discomfort, but poses 
no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject. 
Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, that significantly 
affects clinical status, or that may require intensive therapeutic intervention.

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
8.1.2.  Relationship Categorization 
A physician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship between the IP and each AE.  
The PI  should decide whether, in their medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that 
the eve
nt may have been caused by the IP.  If there is no valid reason for suggesting a 
relationship, the AE should be classified as “not related.”    If a relationship between the AE and 
the investigational product is at least reasonably possible (i.e. the relationship cannot be ruled 
out) the AE should be considered "related.” The causality assessment must be documented in the 
source document. 
The following additional guidance may be helpful: 
Term  Relationship definition  
Related  The temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the IP is compelling and/or 
follows a k nown or suspected response pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained 
by the subject’s medical condition, other therapies, or accident.  
Not related  The event can be readily explained by other factors, such as the subject’s underlying medic al 
condition, concomitant therapy, or accident, and no plausible temporal or biologic relationship 
exists between the IP and the event.  
8.1.3.  Outcome Categorization 
The outcome of AEs must be recorded during the course of the study on the eCRF.  Outcomes 
are as follows: 
 Fatal  
 Not rec
overed/not resolved 
 Recovered/resolved 

 Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
 Rec
overing/resolving 
 Unknown 
8.1.4. S
ymp
toms of the Disease Under Study 
Symptoms o
f the disease under study should not be classified as AEs as long as they are within 
the normal day- to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease and are part of the 
efficacy data to be collected in the study; however, significant worsening of the symptoms 
should be recorded as an AE.   
8.1.5. Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Evaluations 
A chang
e in the value of a clinical laboratory, vital sign, ECG assessment can represent an AE if 
the change is clinically significant or if, during treatment with the IP, a shift of a parameter is 
observed from a normal value to an abnormal value, or there is a further worsening of an already 
abnormal value.  When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the reference 
range, the duration until return to the reference range (either while continuing treatment or after 
the end of treatment with the IP), and the range of variation of the respective parameter within its 
reference range must be taken into consideration. 
 
Confidential Page 108 of 136 
 IND 044020   Marinus Ph armaceuticals Inc.  
Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are abnormal clinical laboratory, vital sign, or ECG 
values that were not present in the pretreatment findings observed closest to the start of study 
treatment, further investigations should be performed until the values return to within the 
reference range or until a plausible explanation ( eg, concomitant disease) is found for the 
abnormal values. 
The PI  should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a subject, whether 
a change
 in a clinical laboratory, vital sign, or ECG parameter is clinically significant and 
therefore represents an AE. 
8.1.6.  Pregnancy 
All pregnancies are to be reported from the time informed consent (and subject assent) is signed 
until the defined follow-up period. 
Any report of pre
gnancy for any study subject must be reported within 24 hours to the Marinus 
Safety Department or its delegate using
 the Pregnancy Report Form.  A copy of the Pregnancy 
Report Form (and any applicable follow
-up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Marinus 
medical monitor using the details specified in the emergency contact information section at the 
beginning of the protocol.  The pregnant study subject must be withdrawn from the study. 
Every effort should be made to gather infor
mation regarding the pregnancy outcome and 
condition of the infant.  It is the responsibility of the PI to obtain this information within 30 
calendar days after the initial notification and a
pproximately 30 calendar days after delivery.   
Pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnor mality 
are considered SAEs and must be reported a s outlined in Section 8.2.2 of the protocol usi ng the 
Marinus C
linical Study Serious Adverse Event Form.  Non-serious AEs are to be reporte d as per 
cli
nical eCRF guidelines.  Note:  An elective  abortion is not considered an SAE. 
In addition to the above, if the PI determines that the pregnancy meets serious criteria , it must be 
reported as an SAE to the Marinus Safety D
epartment or delegate as outlined in Section 8.2.2 of 
the protocol using the Marinus Clinical Study Serious Adverse
 Event Form.  The test date of the 
first positive serum/urine -human chorionic gonadotropin test or ultrasound result will
 
determine the pregnancy onset date. 
8.1.7. Abuse, Misuse, Overdose, and Medication Error 
Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error must be re
ported to the sponsor per the SAE 
reporting procedure whether or not it results in an AE/SAE as described in Section 8.2.2.  Note:  
The 24-hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not appl
y to reports of abuse, misuse, 
overdose, or medication errors unless these result in an SAE.

 IND 044020   Marinus Ph armaceuticals Inc.  
Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
The categories below are not mutually exclusive; the event can meet more than 1 category. 
 Abuse :  Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of an IP for a  nonmedical purpose ( eg, to 
alter one’s sta
te of consciousness or get high) in a manner that may be detrimental to the 
individual and/or society. 
 Misuse:  Intentional use of an IP other than as directed or indicated at any dose.  (Note:  This 
includes a situati
on in which the IP is not used as directed at the dose prescribed by the 
protocol.) 
 Overd
ose:  Intentional or unintentional inta ke of a dose of an IP exceeding a prespecified 
total daily dose of the product.   
 Medication error:  An error ma de in prescribing, dispensing, administering, and/or use of an 
IP.  Medication errors are reportable to the sponsor only as defined below. 
 Cases of subjec ts m
issing doses of the IP are not considered reportable. 
 Applicable only for 
the IP under investigation. 
 The a
dministration and/or use of an expired IP should be considered as a reportable 
medication err
or. 
 All IP provided to pediatric subjects should be supervised by the parent/caregiver/LAR. 
Lapses in 
supervision should be reported. 
8.2. Serious Adverse Event Procedures 
8.2.1.  Reference Safety Information 
The reference for safety information for this study is the GNX Investigator’s Brochure, which 
the sponsor has provided under separate cover to all PI s. 
8.2.2. Reporting Procedures 
All initial and fo
llow-up SAE reports must be reported by the PI to the Marinus Safety 
Department or its de
legate and the CRO/Marinus medical monitor within 24 hours of the first 
awarene
ss of the event.  Note:  The 24-hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply to 
reports of abuse
, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless they result in an SAE.   
The PI  must complete, sign, and date the Marinus Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event Form 
and ve
rify the accuracy of the information recorded on the form with the corresponding source 
documents (Note:  Source documents are not to be sent unless requested) and fax or e-mail the 
form to the Marinus Safety Department or its delegate.  A copy of the Marinus Clinical Study 
Serious Adverse Event Form (and any applicable follow-up reports) must also be sent to the 
CRO/Marinus medical monitor using the details specified in the emergency contact information 
section of the protocol.

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
8.2.3.  Serious Adverse Event Definition 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to IP or not) that 
at any dose:
 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening.  Note:  The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to 
an event in whic
h the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to 
an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  Note:  
Hospitaliz
ations, which are the result of elective or previously scheduled surgery for 
preexisting conditions that have not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not be 
classified as SAEs.  For example, an admission for a previously scheduled ventral hernia 
repair would not be
 classified as an SAE; however, a complication resulting from a 
hospitalization for an elective or previously scheduled surgery that meets serious criteria 
must be reported as an SAE. 
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 Is a
 congenital abnormality or birth defect 
 Is a
n important medical event.  Note:  Important medical events that may not result in death, 
be li
fe-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAEs when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of 
such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.   
8.2.4.  Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame 
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study) are collected from the time the 
parent/caregiver/LAR/subject signs the informed consent/assent until the defined follow-up 
period stated and must be reported to the Marinus Safety Department and the CRO/Marinus 
medical monitor w
ithin 24 hours of the first awareness of the event.   
In addition, any SAE considered “related” to the IP and discovered by the PI at any interval after 
the study has c
ompleted must be reported to the Marinus Safety Department within 24 hours of 
the first awareness of the event. 
8.2.5. Serious Adverse Event Onset and Resolution Dates 
The onset date of th
e SAE is defined as the date the event meets serious criteria.  The resolution 
date is the date the event no longer meets serious criteria, the date the symptoms resolve, or the 
date the event is considered chronic.  In the case of hospitalizations, the hospital admission and 
discharge dates are considered the onset and resolution dates, respectively. 
In addition, any signs or symptoms experienced by the subject after signing the informed consent 
form (and subject assent) or leading up to the onset date of the SAE, or following the resolution 
date of the SAE, must be recorded a
s an AE, if appropriate.

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
8.2.6.  Fatal Outcome 
Any SAE that results in the subject’s death (i.e., the SAE was noted as the primary cause of 
death) must have fatal checked as an outcome, with the date of death recorded as the resolution 
date.  For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s 
death, the outcome should be conside
red not resolved, without a resolution date recorded. 
For any SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless 
another IP action was previously taken ( eg, the drug wa s interrupted, reduced, or withdrawn), the 
action taken with the IP should be recorded as “dose not changed” or “not applicable” (if the 
subject never 
received the IP).  The IP action of “withdrawn” should not be selected solely as a 
result of the subject’s death.   
8.2.7. Regulatory Agency, Institutional Review Board, Ethics Committee, and Site 
Reportin
g 
The sponsor is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities in the United States 
(US) and the CRO is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities in rest of world 
of related, unexpected SAEs. 
In addition, the sponsor or the CRO is responsible for notifying active sites and central 
institutional review boards (IRBs) of all related, unexpected SAEs occurring during all 
interventiona
l studies across the GNX program.   
The PI  is responsible for notifying the local IRBs, local ethics committee, or the relevant local 
reg
ulatory authority of all SAEs that occur at their site as required.

9. DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL METHODS 
9.1. Data Collection 
The PI ’s authorized site personnel must enter the information required by the protocol on the 
eC
RF.  A study monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and review 
the eCRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy.  Discrepancies between 
source data
 and data entered on the eCRF will be addressed by qualified site personnel.  When a 
data discrepa
ncy warrants correction, the correction will be made by authorized site personnel.  
Data collection procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit and/or at the 
PI’s meeting.  Once a subject is screened, it is expected that site personnel will complete the 
eCRF e
ntry within approximatel y 7 business days of the subject’s visit. 
The subject
’s parent/caregiver/LAR must enter the information required by the protocol in the 
eDiary.  A study monitor will review all seizure diary entries in accordance with the monitoring 
plan for completen
ess and accuracy.  Discrepancies will be addressed by the subjects’ 
parent/caregiver/L
AR and qualified site personnel.  When a data discrepancy warrants 
correcti
on, the correction will be made by the subjects’ parent/caregiver/LAR and authorized site 
personnel.  Dat
a collection procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit 
and/or at the investi
gator’s meeting.  Once the subject’s parent/caregiver/LAR signs informed 
consent (and subject assent), it is expected that all eDiary entries will be made daily. 
Retrospecti
ve entry of diary events (seizure and medication) can be completed by the caregiver 
up to 5 days later and proxy entry by the site is also available to the site staff (greater than 5 
days), but neit
her method is encouraged. 
Telephone Follow-up visits are allowed to be conducted via secure email per institutional policy 
if granted by individual sites IRB/EC.  
9.2. Clinical Data Management 
Data will be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRO  data management plan.  
Quality c
ontrol and data validation procedures will be applied to ensure the validity and accuracy 
of the clinical database. 
Data will be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requiring further 
clarificati
on using computerized and manual procedures.  Data queries requiring clarification 
will be communicated to the site for resolution.  Only authorized personnel will make corrections 
to the clinica
l database, and all corrections will be documented in an auditable manner. 
9.3. Statistical Analysis Proce ss 
The study will be analyzed by the sponsor or its agent.  The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will 
provide the statistic
al methods and definitions for the analysis of the efficacy and safety data, as 
well as describe the approaches to be taken for summarizing other study information, such as 
subject dispo
sition, demographics, and baseline characteristics; IP exposure;  and prior and 
concomitant medications.  The SAP will also include a description of how missing data will be 
addressed.  To preserve the integrity of the statistical analysis and study conclusions, the SAP 
will be finalized prior to database lock.

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® (SAS Institute, Cary, NC 27513).  A 
summary o
f the statistical analyses is provided below; full, updated details are provided in a 
SAP. 
9.4. Data Monitoring Committee 
The emerging study data will be reviewed on a regular basis by an independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC).  The mission of the DMC will be to safeguard the interests of study subject s 
and to enhance the integrity and credibility of the trial.  To enable the DMC to achieve its 
mission, the DMC will
 have ongoing access to efficacy and safety data and data regarding 
quality of trial conduct and will ensure the confidentiality of these data will be protected.  A 
DMC charter 
will provide the principles and guidelines for the DMC process. 
9.5. Sample Size Calculation and Power Considerations 
A total of 50 subjects (25 in each treatment group) w as planned to be enrolled in the study.  
 
Note: Protoco l versi
ons 5 and 6 were implemented after enrollment was stopped early due to 
administrative reasons. T
he final sample size is not based on statistical considerations. Formal 
hypothesis testing will be performed based on all available sample size at the time of the study 
discontinuation. 
 
9.6. Study Pop
ulations 
The Randomized population comprises all subjects who are randomized to one of GNX or PBO 
treatment group. 
The Safety population comprises all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study 
drug. 
The 
ITT population comprises all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study 
drug and have at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment. 
The P
er-Protocol (PP) population includes all ITT subjects without major protocol violations 
(defined prior to database lock).   There will be no PP population for the OL period of the study. 
9.7. General St
atistical Considerations 
Source data for the summary tables and statistical analyses will be presented as subject data 
listings, which include data collected on the electronic case report forms (eCRFs) as well as any 
derived efficacy variables for all enrolled subjects.  
Except where noted, separate tables and data listings will be prepared for the DB and OL phases 
of the study.  Only events occurring before entry into the OL phase will be included in the DB 
phase outputs, and except where indicated, only baseline events and events occurring after entry 
into the OL phase will included in the OL phase outputs.  
Baseline seizure activity will be determined by prospective recording in subject’s daily seizure 
eDiaries, which are provided after signing informed consent/assent.  Within the DB phase of the 
study, determination of post-baseline seizure activity will begin on the day following the first day 
 
Confidential Page 114 of 136 
 IND 044020   Marinus Ph armaceuticals Inc.  
Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
of DB treatment.  Determination of post-baseline seizure activity assigned to the OL phase will 
begin on the day following the first OL treatment.  
Tables will be provided using the ITT subject population as well as within each of the biomarker-
positive and biomarker-negative strata. The within-stratum PBO group will consist of only the 
subjects within the corresponding stratum.  The tables for the DB phase will show the results for 
each DB
 treatment group and, where noted, combined over the groups as well.  The tables for the 
OL phase will show the results for each DB treatment group (all subjects will be receiving GNX 
in the OL phase) and combined over them.  For the efficacy endpoints, the results will be derived 
according to the randomized treatment group; for the other endpoints, they will be derived 
according to the treatment actually received.  
Baselines for non-seizure efficacy and safety assessments are defined as the last non-missing 
value of the assessment before the first dose of treatment.   
The OL phase will use the same baseline as the DB phase.  
9.8. Subject Disposition 
Disposition will be summarized within the DB treatment groups and overall among all subjects 
within both the DB and extension phases of the study. 
Subjects completing the DB phase of the study are those who completed the 17-week DB 
treatment phase, regardless of whether they entered the OL.  A listing of dispositions will be 
provided for all randomized subjects. 
9.9. Eligibility Criteria and Protocol Deviations 
The clinical team will identify deviations; these will be provided in a data listing.  A data listing 
of subjects who violate any of the inclusion/exclusion characteristics will also be provided, as 
well as a data listing of subjects with other protocol violations. 
9.10. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic data (age, gender, race, height, weight and body mass index (BMI), and ethnicity) 
and baseline characteristics (Tanner staging) collected prior to the first dose will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics. 
9.11. Medical History and Genetic Testing 
Medical history will be coded with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
Terminology version 22.0.  The number and percent of subjects with clinically significant 
medical history
 at screening will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term (PT) 
by treatment and overall in the safety population. 
The results of the genetic testing, historical seizure information, and seizure identification and 
diagnostic review will be summarized and listed.

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
9.12. Prior and Concomitant Therapies 
Prior medications are defined as medications that started and stopped prior to the first dose of 
DB study drug.  Concomitant medications are defined as medications (other than the study drug) 
taken on or after the
 first dose of the DB study drug, regardless of when the medications started.   
9.13. Efficacy Analyses 
9.13.1. Double-Blind Phase 
For the analyses of seizures, the baseline phase consists of the 8- or -12 week period before the 
first day of tr
eatment, and the DB phase starts the day following the first day of DB treatment 
and continues 
until the final visit for subjects who do not enter the OL, and up to the day before 
the first dose of OL treatment for those who do.    
Tests of significance between the 2 treatment groups will be performed for the primary endpoint 
with a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. 
9.13.1.1. Handling of Missing Data 
Careful educating and monitoring of the study sites will attempt to limit the amount of missing 
data to nearly zero, but despite these efforts, some missing data may still ari se.   
Intermittent (random/sporadic) missing data during the 17-week double blind phase and any 
missing data during the baseline phase will be assumed missing at random and the collected data 
will be used to calculate the 28-day seizure frequencies. 
For early
 drug termination prior to the end of the 17-week DB phase, caregivers will be 
instructed to continue to provide daily seizure records until the end of the 17-week DB phase 
(hence further preventing missingness).  
The primary analysis will use all available data. Careful educating and monitoring of the study 
sites will attempt to limit the amount of missing data. Sensitivity analys es, with replacement of 
missing data, will be performed for the primary efficacy endpoint.  
9.13.1.2. Prim
ary Endpoint (Seizure Control) 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change in 28-day primary seizure frequency during 
the 17-week DB phase relative to the baseline. The primary seizure types are defined as 
countable focal seizures that include progressive hypotonia and impaired awareness, or any 
countable focal or 
generalized seizure with a clear motor component. Focal and generalized 
nonmotor seizures and myoclonic seizures do not count as the primary seizure types.  
The analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed on the sum of the individual countable 
seizures and each series of continuous uncountable seizures (each contributes 1 to the sum).   
Post-baseline 28-day seizure frequency will be calculated as the total number of seizures in the 
17-week DB treatment phase divided by the number of days with seizure data in the phase, 
multiplied b
y 28. Baseline 28-day seizure frequency will be calculated as the total number of 
seizures in the baseline phase divided by the number of days with seizure data in the phase, 
multiplied by 28. The difference between the GNX and placebo groups in the percent changes 
will be tested using
 the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum statistic.  Testing will be conducted in the following

order: 
 The primary analysis will be conducted in the ITT Population.  
 If nominal statisti
cal significance is achieved in the ITT Population, the primary analysis will be 
conducted in the biomarker-positive stratum of the ITT population as a secondary endpoint.  
In addition, as an exploratory ana
lysis, efficacy will be assessed in the biomarker-negative 
stratum and compared with the biomarker-positive result.  
 
9.13.1.3. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
All secondary efficacy endpoints will compare GNX and PBO during the 17-week DB treatment 
phase relative to the prospective baseline phase, unless specifically indicated otherwise.   
9.13.1.3.1. Seizure Control Endpoints 
9.13.1.3.1.1.  Percent Change in P
rimary Seizure Frequency 
The percent change in 28-da

9.13.1.3.2. Behavioral/Neuropsychiatric Endpoints 
9.13.1.3.2.1. Behavior Rating Inventory of Exe
cutive Function (BRIEF, preschool version 
BRIEF- P) 
The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) is an 86-item questionnaire 
designed to assess executive function behaviors in the school and home environments in 
individuals 5-18 years of age.  The preschool version (BRIEF-P) is a 63-item modified form and 
is utilized in individuals 2-5 y
ears of age.  The questionnaire is completed by the 
parents/caregiver/LAR.   
BR
IEF (BRIEF-P where appropriate) will be assessed as follows:  in the DB phase at Visit 2 
(baseline/randomization) and Visi
t 5 (Week 17; also Final DB Visit/First OL Visit in open label 
phase); in the OL phase at Visit 7 (Week 36) and Visit 9 (Week 68) and thereafter every 16 
weeks for the duration of this phase; and at the
 Final OL Visit. 
9.13.1.3.2.2. Aberrant Behavior Checklist - Community (ABC- C) 
The ABC-C is a questionnaire designed to assess problematic behavior at home, in educational 
and work settin
g, and in residential and community-based facilities. 
IND 044020

The ABC -C will be assessed as follows: in the DB phase at Visit 2 (base line/randomizatio n) and 
Visit 5 (Wee k 17; also Final DB Visit/F irst OL Vi sit in open label phase); in the OL ph ase at 
Visit 7 (Wee k 36) and Visit 9 (Week 68) and thereafte r eve1 y 16 weeks for the d uration of this 
phase; and at the Final OL Visi t. 
9.13.1.3.2.3. Children' s Sleep Habit Questionnaire (CS HQ) 
The CSHQ is a psyc hological questio nnaire designed to measure sleep behav iors in childr en and 
adolesce nts and is filled out by the p arent/caregiver/LAR. An abbrev iated versio n contains 33 
items. The first 31 items are scored as 1 = Rarely (0-1 times per week), 2 = Sometimes (2-4 
times per week), or 3 = Usually (5 - 7 times per week) . Item 32 (Watc hing TV) and 33 (Riding 
in car) ask how sleepy the child h as appea red during those activities (1 = Not sleepy, 2 = Ve1 y 
sleepy , or 3 = Falls asleep). The questio nnaire includes 2 other qu antitative questio ns: 
• C hild's usual amount of sleep each day 
• N umber of minutes a night waking usually lasts 
The 33 items are pa1iit ioned into 8 domains: 
1. Bedtime resistance (items 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8) 
2. Sleep onset delay (item 2) 
3. Sleep duration (items 9, 10, 11) 
4. Sleep anxiety (items 5, 7, 8, 21) 
5. Night wakings (items 16, 24, 25) 
6. Paraso mnias (items 12-15, 17, 22, 23) 
7. Sleep disordered breathing (items 18, 19, 20) 
8. Daytime sleep iness (items 26-33) 
For scoring, first items 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, and 26 are r eversed (4-score) . The item scores are then 
summed within each domain. The domain subtotals, the total of the 33 items , and the 2 other 
quantitative questions will be summa rized with descriptive statistics of the baseline and 
post-baseline values and the ar ithmetic chan ges from base line. The usual amount of sleep each 
day will be sUllllllarized in hours.

20 Janua 1 y 2021 
Other than the wit hin-stratum analyses , no s ubgroup analyses are planned at this time. 
9.13.3. Sensitivity Anal yses 
Two sensitivity analyses of the primaiy efficacy endpo int of change in 28-day frequency of the 
primaiy seizure types will be perfo1med: 
futennittent (random/s poradic) missing data durin g the 17- week DB phase and any missing data 
durin g the baseline phase will be assumed missing complet ely at random and the collected data 
will be used to calculate the 28-day seizure frequencies. For eai·ly diug te1min ation prior to the 
end of the 17-week DB phase, cai·egivers will be instructed to continue to provide daily seizure 
records until the end of the 17- week DB phase (hence furth er preventing missingness) . 
fu the first sensitivity analysis, the following impu tation ap proach will be used for the prim aiy 
outco me m easure when a s ubject stops recording measuremen ts pennan ently (antic ipated to be 
zero or minim al in occmTence) prior to th e end of the 17- week DB phase: for the missing days , 
the conespond ing median PBO data will be impu ted (nTespective of treatinent aim), within each 
sti·atum, as follows:

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
 Compute the median  28-day seizure frequency in the PBO arm based on all available PBO 
measurements during the 17-week DB treatment phase.  Label that ‘X’ and define ‘A’ to be 
‘X’/28, (i.e., the daily avera
ge on placebo during the 17-week during the DB phase ). 
 For any days (whether they be on the PBO or GNX arm) that occur AFTER a subject has 
become lost to follow up, imput
e ‘A’ on that day. 
 
The se
cond sensitivity analysis will explore the possibility that subjects who stop recording their 
seizure counts tend to have higher seizure counts than the other subjects. The imputation method 
described above will be modified to use the median of the 5 highest counts, rather than the 
median count, among the PBO subjects with data. 
9.13.4. Protections for Multiplicity 
To control the family-wise Type I error rate, hypothesis testing of the primary e fficacy endpoint 
will be conducted sequentially in the order specified in Section 9.13.1.2.   
9.13.5. Open-Label Period Anal
yses 
All of the analyses for the DB phase, will be repeated for the OL phase with the following 
differences: 
 The results will be presented overall and also classified according to the DB treatment 
received by subj
ects. 
 P
ost-baseline seizure endpoints will be derived based on the first day of OL treatment. 
 No sensitivi
ty analyses will be performed 
 The seizure frequencies during the titration and maintenance phases will not be analyzed. 
 The time points for
 the efficacy, exploratory, and quality of life endpoints will be after 19 
weeks, 51 wee
ks, and every 16 weeks thereafter of OL treatment relative to the prospective 
baseline phase. 
 The differenc
es between the DB treatment groups in the percent changes from baseline of the 
28-day seizure frequencies w
ill not be tested for statistical significance. 
 No PP  analyses will be performed.

The complete list of differences will be outlined in the SAP.  
9.14. Safety Analyses 
All safety analyses will be performed in the Safety Population.  The results in the DB and OL 
phases will be summarized separately.  In both phases, the results will be summarized by the DB 
treatment actually received and, for the OL phase of the study, combined over the treatment 
groups.  The number and percentage of days that subjects received investigational product, th e 
highest perce
ntage of the maximum allowable daily dose (1800 mg or 63 mg/kg) that subjects 
received, and the total amount of investigational product received will be summarized. For the 
open-label phase, they will be summarized over just the open-label phase as well as over the 
entire study
 (combined DB and OL phases) but the classification by the double-blind treatment 
applies only for the open-label phase summary.  The summarization over the entire study will 
include the double-blind data only from subjects who were in the GNX group during the double-
blind phase, regardless of whether they entered the open-label phase, and all the subjects from 
the open-label phase.  
Adverse events will be tabulated by overall, system organ class, and Preferred Term using the 
Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding system.  Incidence and 
percentage of AEs will be presented.  Additional tables, with AEs classified by severity and by 
only those relate
d to drug as assessed by the PI will be presented.  Su bset listing s will be 
produced for AEs that cause withdrawal and for SAEs.  Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, 
chemistry and urinalysis), vital signs and ECGs will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
including changes from baseline.  In addition, shift tables cross-tabulating the baseline and post-
baseline low/normal/high classifications by visit will be provided for the laboratory tests.  
Physical, neurological and developmental examinations will be summarized using number and 
percentage of subjects with abnormalities. 
The Tanner scale (also known as the Tanner stages) is a scale of physical development in 
children, adolescents and adults.  The scale defines physical measurements of development based 
on external prim
ary and secondary sex characteristics.  Subjects will be evaluated and rated as 
Tanner I, 
Tanner II, Tanner III, Tanner IV and Tanner V.  The Tanner scale is administered 
following the first dose, 
only during the OL phase of the study. 
The baseline and post-baseline values and the arithmetic changes from baseline of the 
neurosteroid levels will be summarized using descriptive statistics.   
Concomitant AED levels are not mandatory but will be collected per sites’ standard of care.  A 
subject listing, including date and time of last AED dose and date and time of AED PK sample, 
will be provided. 
Detailed analysis and complete listings will be outlined in the SAP. 
9.15. Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
A listing of the PK collection times will be provided, but the analyses will be described in a 
separate
 report (analyses details will be provided in the SAP).   
The PK population will
 include all subjects who have received at least 1 dose and who have had 
at least 1 sample collected and a valid bioanalytical result obtained.  The samples will be drawn

between 1 and 5 hours or between 4 and 8 after the last dose during the double-blind and open 
label periods. Pharmacokinetic analyses will be limited to listing of concentrations because 
sufficient concentration-time data will not be available for noncompartment al analyses such as 
Cmax, AUC or t max. Pharma
cokinetic data from this study may be used for a Population PK 
analys
es to be conducted separately from this study and reported separately. 
9.16. Interim Analysis 
No formal interim analysis is planned for this study. After all active subjects complete the17-
week double-blind phase, the double-blind data in the database will be locked and used to 
perform endpoint analysis. Data collected during the open label phase will be analyzed 
separately.  
The emerging study data will be reviewed on a regular basis by an independent DMC.  The 
mission of the DMC will be to safeguard the interests of study participants and to enhance the 
integrity and credibility of the trial.  To enable the DMC to achieve their mission, the DMC will 
have ongoin
g access to efficacy and safety data and data regarding quality of trial conduct and 
will ensure the confidentiality of these data will be preserved.  A DMC Charter will provide the 
principles and 
guidelines for the DMC process.  Specific details of the monitoring boundaries are 
provided in the SAP and the
 DMC Charter.

Incorrect entries must be crossed with a single line as to not obscure the original entry.  
Corrections must be made adjacent to the item to be altered, initialed, and dated by an authorized 
PI or designee as stated in the site delegation log.  Overwriting of this information or use of 
liquid correcti
on fluid is not allowed. 
10.2.3.2. Electron
ic Diaries (eDiary) 
The eDiaries are supplied by the Sponsor designee and should be handled in accordance with 
instructions from t
he sponsor. In rare cases when an eDiary completion is not feasible, a paper 
diary will be used to log daily seizure type and frequency.  The Sponsor will provide the paper 
diary template which should not be modified.  
All data collected and sent to the sponsor must be endorsed by the PI. 
The CRA /study monitor will verify the contents of the eDiary data per the monitoring plan.  If 
the data are
 unclear or contradictory, queries are sent for corrections or verification of data. 
10.2.3.3. Recording, Access, and Retention of Source Data and Study Documents 
Original source data to be reviewed during this study will include, but are not limited to, the 
subject’s medical file, the subject ’s electronic or paper seizure diaries, and original clinical 
laboratory reports.   
All key data must be recorded in the subject’s medical records. 
The PI  must permit authorized representatives of the sponsor; the respective national, local, or 
fore
ign regulatory authorities; the IRB/EC; and auditors to inspect facilities and to have direct 
access t
o original source records relevant to this study, regardless of media. 
The CRA/study monitor (and auditors, IRB/EC, or regulatory inspectors) may check the eCRF 
entries against the source documents.  The consent form includes a statement by which the 
subj
ect agrees to allow the monitor/auditor from the sponsor or its representatives, national or

local regulatory authorities, or the IRB/EC to have access to source data ( eg, subject’s medical 
file, appointment books, original labo
ratory reports, EEGs, ECGs, etc.).   
These records must
 be made available within reasonable times for inspection and duplication, if 
required, by a properly authorized representative of any regulatory agency ( eg, the US Food and 
Drug Administra
tion [FDA], European Medicines Agency [EMA], United Kingdom [ UK] 
Medicines and H
ealthcare Products Regulatory Agency) or an auditor. 
Essential documents must be maintained according to ICH GCP requirements and may not be 
destroyed without written permission from the sponsor. 
10.2.3.4. Audit/Inspection 
To ensure compliance with relevant regulations, data generated by this study must be available 
for inspection upon request by representatives of, for example, the US FDA (as well as other US 
national and local regulatory authorities), the EMA, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products 
Regulatory
 Agency, other regulatory authorities, the sponsor or its representatives, and the 
IRB/EC for each site. 
10.2.3.5. Financial Disclosure 
The PI  is required to disclose any financial arrangement during the study and for 1 year after, 
whereby the o
utcome of the study could be influenced by the value of the compensation for 
conducting the study, or other payments the PI received from the sponsor.  The following 
information is colle
cted:  any significant payments from the sponsor or subsidiaries, such as a 
grant to fund ongoing research, compensation in the form of equipment, or retainer for ongoing 
consultation or honoraria; any proprietary interest in IP; and any significant equity interest in the 
sponsor or subsidiaries as defined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations 54 2(b) (1998 ). 
10.3. Ethical Considerations 
10.3.1. Informed Consent/Assent 
It is the responsibility of the PI to obtain written informed consent/assent from the 
subject/pa
rent/caregiver/LAR for all study subjects prior to any study-related procedures, 
including scree
ning assessments.   
All consent documentation must be in accord
ance with applicable regulations and GCP.  Each 
subject’s parent/caregiver/LAR/subject, as applicable, is requested to sign and date the subject ’s 
informed consent/assent form or a certified translation, if applicable, after they have received and 
read (or been read) the written subject information and received an explanation of what the study 
involves, including but not limited to the objectives, potential benefits and risk, inconveniences, 
and the subject’s rights and responsibilities.  A copy of the informed consent documentation 
(i.e., a c
omplete set of subject information sheets and fully executed signature pages) must be 
given to the subjec
t’s parent/caregiver/LAR, as applicable.  This document may require 
translation into the local language.   Signed consent forms must remain in each subject’s study 
file and must be available for verification at any time. 
Site personnel should document providing instruction for and understanding by the 
parent/caregiver/LAR of the safe, responsible storage and administration of the oral IP.

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
The PI provides the sponsor with a copy of the consent form that was reviewed by the IRB/EC 
and received their favorable opinion/approval.  A copy of the IRB/EC’s written favorable 
opinion/approval of these documents must be provided to the sponsor prior to the start of the 
study unless it is agreed to and documented (abiding by regulatory guidelines and national 
provisions) prior to study start that another party ( ie, sponsor or coordinating PI) is responsible 
for thi
s action.  Additionally, if the IRB/EC requires modification of the sample subject 
information and consent document provided by the sponsor, the documentation supporting this 
requirement must be provided to the sponsor. 
10.3.2. Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committ ee 
For sites outside the EU, it is the responsibility of the PI to submit this protocol, the informed 
consent document (a
pproved by the sponsor or their designee), relevant supporting information, 
and all types of subject recruitment information to the IRB/EC for review, and all must be 
approved prior to site initiation. 
Responsibility for coordi
nating with IRBs/ECs is defined in the investigator agreement. 
Prior to implementing changes in the study, the sponsor and the IRB/EC must approve any 
revisions of all informed consent documents and amendments to the protocol unless there is a 
subject safety issue. 
Investiga
tional product supplies will not be released until the CRO  has received written IRB/EC 
approval of a
nd copies of revised documents. 
For sites outside the EU, the PI is responsible for keeping the IRB/EC informed of the progress 
of the study a
nd of any changes made to the protocol, but in any case, at least once a year.  This 
can be done by the sponsor or PI for sites within the EU, or for multicenter studies, it can be 
done b
y the coordinating PI, according  to national provisions.  The PI must also keep the local 
IRB/EC informed of any SAEs and significant AEs. 
10.4. Privacy and Confidentiality 
All US-based sites and laboratories or entities providing support for this study, must, where 
applicable, comply with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996.  
A site that is not a c
overed entity as defined by HIPAA must provide documentation of this fact 
to the CRO . 
The confidentiality of records that may be able to identify subjects will be protected in 
accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines. 
After the subject’s parent/caregiver/LAR have consented to take part in the study, the sponsor 
and/or its representatives rev
iew the medical records and data collected during the study.  These 
records and da
ta may, in addition, be reviewed by others, including the following:  independent 
auditors who vali
date the data on behalf of the sponsor; third parties with whom the sponsor may 
develop, register, or market GNX; national or local regulatory authorities; and the IRB/EC  that 
gave a
pproval for the study to proceed.  The sponsor and/or its representatives accessing the 
records and data will take all reasonable precautions in accordance with applicable laws, 
regulations, and guidelines to maintain the confidentiality of subjects’ identities.

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
Subjects are each assigned a unique identifying number; however, their initials and date of birth 
may also be collected and used to assist the sponsor in verifying the accuracy of the data ( eg, to 
confirm that l
aboratory results have been assigned to the correct subject).   
The results of studies—containing subjects’ unique identifying numbers, relevant medical 
records, and possibly initials and dates of birth—will be recorded.  They may be transferred to, 
and used in, other countries that may not afford the same level of protection that applies within 
the countries where this study is conducted.  The purposes of any such transfer would include to 
support regulatory
 submissions, to conduct new data analyses to publish or present the study 
results, and to answer questions asked by regulatory or health authorities. 
10.5. Study Results/Publication Policy 
Marinus will endeavor to publish the results of all qualifying, applicable, and covered studies 
according to external g
uidelines in a timely manner regardless of whether the outcomes are 
perceived as positive, neutral, or negative.  Additionally, Marinus adheres to external guidelines 
(eg, Good Publication Practices 2) when forming a publication steering committee, which may 
be
 done for large, multicenter Phase 2 to 4 and certain other studies as determined by Marinus.  
The purpose of the
 publication steering committee is to act as a noncommercial body that advises 
or decides on dissemination of scientific study data in accordance with the scope of this policy. 
All publications relating to Marinus products or projects must undergo appropriate technical and 
intellectual property review, with Marinus agreement to publish prior to release of information.  
The review is aim
ed at protecting the sponsor’s proprietary information existing either at the 
commencement of the study or generated during the study.  To the extent permitted by the 
publisher and cop
yright law, the PI will own (or share with other authors) the copyright on 
his/her public
ations.  To the extent that the PI has such sole, joint, or shared rights, the PI grants 
the sponsor
 a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to make and distribute copies of such 
publications. 
The term “publication” refers to any public disclosure, including original research articles, 
review articles, or
al presentations, abstracts and posters at medical congresses, journal 
supplements, letters to the editor, invited lectures, opinion pieces, book chapters, electronic 
postings on medical/scientific websites, or other disclosure of the study results, in printed, 
electronic, oral, or other form. 
Subject to the terms of the paragraph below, the PI shall have the right to publish the study 
results, and an
y background information provided by the sponsor that is necessary to include in 
any publication of study results or necessary for other scholars to verify such study results.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no publication that incorporates the sponsor’s confidential 
information shall be submitted for publication without the sponsor’s prior written agreement to 
publish and shall be given to the sponsor for review at least 60 days prior to submission for 
publication
.  If requested in writing by Marinus, the hospital and PI shall withhold submission of 
such publication for up to an additional 60 days to allow for filing of a patent application. 
If the study is part of a multicenter study, the first publication of the study results shall be made 
by the sponsor in conjunction with the sponsor’s presentation of a joint, multicenter publication 
of the compiled and analyzed study results.  If such a multicenter publication is not submitted to 
a journal for publication by the sponsor within an 18-month period after conclusion,

abandonment, or termination of the study at all sites, or after the sponsor confirms there shall be 
no multicenter study publication of the study results, an PI may individually publish the study 
results from the
 specific site in accordance with this section.  The PI  must, however, 
acknowledge
 in the publication the limitations of the single-site data being presented. 
Unless otherwise required by the journal in which the publication appears, or the forum in which 
it is made, authorship will comply with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
current standards.  Participation as an investigator does not confer any rights to authorship of 
publications.

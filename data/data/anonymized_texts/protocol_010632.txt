2.0 Background 
2.1.  Current Status of High-Dose Chemotherapy (HDC) for Germ-C ell Tumors 
(GCT)
First-line cisplatin-based standard-dose chemotherapy (SDC) com binations yield 
long-term EFS rates around 90% and 50% in patients with good-ri sk and poor-risk 
advanced disease, respectively. Salvage SDC regimens cure about  25% of patients in first 
relapse. Patients in second relapse or beyond or those with cis platin-refractory tumors are 
considered largely incurable with SDC.
The use of HDC with autologous hematopoietic progenitor-cell su pport (AHPCS) for 
GCT has been studied in two different settings: as part of firs t-line therapy for metastatic 
disease, and in relapsed or refractory tumors. 
First-Line HDC for Metastatic NSGCT
Motzer and colleagues developed an elegant strategy of switchin g to HDC those patients 
with a reduced clearance of serum tumor markers during SDC [1, 2]. This approach 
yielded long-term 50% EFS, which seemed superior to their own h istorical controls. 
Schmoll et al. reported 69% long-term EFS rate in 221 patients with poor-prognosis 
advanced disease who received one cycle of SDC followed by thre e cycles of high-dose 
etoposide/ifosfamide/cisplatin.[3] Matched-pair comparisons wit h prior SDC trials 
suggested the superiority of HDC.[4]

A European randomized trial conducted in the 1980s that enrolle d 115 untreated 
poor-risk patients failed to show differences between a control  arm and an arm receiving 
a cisplatin-containing regimen at higher than standard doses wi th AHPCS.[5] The total 
platinum dose in this study was lower in the transplant than in  the control arm. In an US 
Intergroup trial Bajorin et al. randomized 219 patients with ne wly diagnosed disease with 
intermediate or poor risk features to receive 4 cycles of SDC o r 2 cycles of SDC followed 
by 2 cycles of HDC with cyclophosphamide/etoposide/carboplatin. [6] The complete 
remission rates did not differ significantly between the transp lant and control arms (52% 
vs. 48%, p=0.5). There were no significant differences in EFS ( p=0.4) or OS (p=0.9). A 
planned subset analysis according to early tumor marker clearan ce suggested a 
significant benefit of HDC among those patients experiencing a slow marker decline 
(p=0.03), in contrast with similar outcomes in both arms in the  group of patients with a 
satisfactory marker drop (p=0.5). 
HDC for Refractory/Relapsed GCT
The use of tandem cycles of high-dose carboplatin/etoposide in patients with relapsed 
tumors was pioneered by Einhorn and collaborators at Indiana Un iversity. In the latest 
update of their results at a median follow-up of 4 years (range , 1 to 10 years), they have 
reported 63% EFS in 184 consecutive patients, with 1.6% treatme nt-related mortality 
(TRM).[7] The EFS rates in patients transplanted in first or in  second or later relapse 
were 70% and 45%, respectively. The outcome was similar in pati ents with seminoma 
and non-seminoma histologies (74% v 60%). Of note, none of their patients had primary 
mediastinal tumors. 
Several groups have explored the addition of a third drug, such  as ifosfamide or 
cyclophosphamide to the carboplatin/etoposide backbone. Margoli n et al. treated 20 
patients with tandem cycles of ifosfamide/carboplatin/etoposide  (ICE) with a 40% 
long-term EFS rate.[8] Subsequently, these authors treated 31 p atients with high-dose 
paclitaxel/carboplatin/etoposide followed by paclitaxel/carbopl atin/ifosfamide, with 36% 
EFS rate at 5 years.[9] Overall, high-dose triplets achieve 40- 50% EFS rate in patients 
with cisplatin-sensitive tumors, and 4-20% in those with refrac tory disease.[10, 11] 
Beyer et al. conducted a multicenter multivariate analysis of 3 10 relapsed/refractory 
patients treated with high/dose carboplatin/etoposide.[12] Thes e authors identified the 
following independent adverse predictors: refractoriness to cis platin (progression within 
4 weeks after treatment with cisplatin), absolute refractorines s to cisplatin (no response to 
initial platinum chemotherapy), primary mediastinal tumor, and high tumor markers 
(HCG >1,000 U/L) at the time of HDC. A prognostic score based o n these variables was 
developed (Table 1). The resulting good, intermediate, and poor  risk groups presented 
2-year EFS of 51%, 27% and 5% (Table 2).

This prognostic score has been externally validated in an indep endent group of 45 
patients with cisplatin-refractory relapsed disease, treated wi th HDC using ICE x 2.[13] 
At median FU of 32 months, the EFS and OS rates were both 23.5% , with EFS curves 
plateauing after 17 months. The groups with good, intermediate and poor risk according 
to the prognostic score had 62%, 13% and 0% EFS rates, respecti vely.
Randomized Trials of HDC for Relapsed GCT
Pico and colleagues randomized 280 relapsed patients to receive  three cycles of SDC 
followed by a single course of high-dose carboplatin/etoposide/ cyclophosphamide or one 
more cycle of SDC.[14] At median follow-up of 45 months, the di fferences in EFS (42% 
vs. 35%, P=0.1) or OS (53% in both arms) were not statistically  significant.  
Lorch et al. randomized 216 patients with relapsed or refractor y disease to receive one 
cycle of very high-dose carboplatin/etoposide or two sequential  cycles of those drugs at 
slightly lower doses, requiring in both arms AHPCS.[15] Accrual  to this study stopped 
after an excessive 14% TRM was detected in the single cycle arm . At median FU of 3 
years, the differences in favor of the sequential HDC arm in EF S (40% v 37%) and OS 
rates (80% v 61%) did not reach statistical significance.  In summary, there is no consensus yet as to whether HDC should be administered to all 
relapsed patients. Because of the excellent results of tandem c ycles of HDC as salvage 
treatment many experts consider HDC a valuable salvage option.[ 16] The National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines contemplate HDC as the preferred 
option for patients with an incomplete response or relapse afte r salvage SDC, for those 
with unfavorable prognostic features for conventional salvage t herapy, such as an 
incomplete response to 1st line treatment, or for patients requ iring 3rd line therapy.[17] 
It seems likely that more than one cycle of HDC is necessary, p articularly in refractory 
patients, as it appears that a single cycle may either not be s ufficient, or too toxic if 
administered at ultra-high doses.

2.2. High-Dose Gemcitabine/Docetaxel/Melphalan/Carboplatin (Gem -DMC).
The HDC regimen we will first use in our tandem cycle strategy,  Gem/DMC, was 
developed by adding gemcitabine to a prior combination of docetaxel/melphalan/carboplatin (DMC). In the phase I trial of DMC, which enrolled 59 
patients with advanced refractory tumors, the maximally tolerat ed dose (MTD) of 
docetaxel was established at 400 mg/m2, in combination with mel phalan (150 mg/m2) 
and carboplatin (1,000 mg/m2).[18] Docetaxel presented linear p harmacokinetics (PK) 
over the range of doses tested. This regimen showed high activi ty with 97% response rate 
(RR), 47% CR rate, and 3-year EFS and OS rates of 26% and 36%, respectively. 
In a subsequent phase I study that enrolled 52 patients, gemcit abine was administered at 
fixed dose rate of 10 mg/m2/min prior to DMC in each treatment day.[19] The MTD of 
gemcitabine was defined at 5 hours/day x 4 (total 20 hours, tot al dose 12,000 mg/m2). 
This dose level was tolerable, with a reversible profile of sto matitis (28% grade 3), 
enteritis (12% G3), diarrhea (8% G3), constipation (8% G3), and  skin rash (8% G3), and 
no G4-5 toxicities. A high level of activity was again seen, wi th 97% RR, 50% CR rate, 
and encouraging 2-year EFS and OS rates of 56% and 78%, respect ively. The PK 
exposure to gemcitabine across the dose range was linear, with no changes in clearance.
A total of 10 patients with refractory GCT were treated in thes e two trials: 6 with DMC 
and 4 with Gem-DMC. Eight patients had tumors in refractory rel apse and 2 had relapsed 
primary mediastinal tumors. The median number of prior chemothe rapy lines was 3 (1-5). 
Only 2 patients were in partial remission at the time of HDC, a nd the other 8 patients had 
progressive disease. All 10 patients responded to HDC, with 9 C Rs and 1 PR. Six 
patients went on to receive a second cycle of HDC off study, wi th either 
carboplatin/etoposide or ICE. Six of the ten patients are alive  in complete remission, 3 to 
6 years after HDC. 
2.3. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in Germ Cell Tumo rs
The VEGF family of ligands consistes of five glycoproteins refe rred to as VEGF-A (or 
VEGF),  VEGF-B, C, D, and E. VEGF binds to two receptor tyrosin e kinases: VEGFR-1 
(Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (Flk-1/KDR), which are present on the surfa ce of endothelial cells 
(ECs), and bind with high affinity to VEGF. Activation of VEGFR -2 leads to 
autophosphorylation and signal activation. VEGFR-1 is thought t o act as a decoy 
receptor on ECs, although it may play a role in hematopoiesis. There is a third receptor, 
VEGFR-3 (Flt-4), involved in the regulation of the lymphatic sy stem, which 
preferentially binds VEGF-C and VEGF-D. 
VEGF is one of the most potent inducers of tumors angiogenesis.  The expression of 
VEGF depends on the oxygenation status and the VHL  gene. Under normoxia and normal 
VHL  function, oxygen promotes hydroxylation of the hypoxia inducib le factor 
(HIF)-1alpha at a proline residue. VHL protein then binds to th is hydroxylated residue, 
leading to ubiquitin attachment and proteasomal degradation of HIF-1alpha. Under 
2008-0378
February 26, 2015
Page 6
hypoxia, low pH or abnormal VHL  function, HIF-1alpha dimerizes with HIF-1alpha, 
leading to transcription of hypoxia-inducible genes, such as VEGF . VEGF expression can 
also be triggered during early stages of neoplastic transformat ion by genetic mutations, 
e.g., K-ras, p53 or HER2. Antineoplastic treatment itself may i ncrease VEGF production.
VEGF is overexpressed in most human tumors, with a direct corre lation with tumor 
progression or risk of recurrence. Because of the relatively lo w expression levels in adult 
healthy tissues, VEGF constitutes an attractive therapeutic tar get. In the case of GCT, 
metastatic tumors express higher levels of VEGF than nonmetasta tic tumors.[20] A direct 
correlation between tumor microvessel counts and VEGF levels in  metastatic GCt has 
been reported, as well as an independent adverse prognostic eff ect of VEGF 
overexpression.[21] 
2.4. Bevacizumab (Avastin ®)
Bevacizumab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) that target s VEGF. Bevacizumab 
has a reduced immunogenicity and longer half-life than its muri ne counterpart. Phase I 
studies demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics and no interaction s with chemotherapy.[22, 
23] 
A direct and rapid antivascular effect of bevacizumab has been shown on human tumors 
by Jain and coworkers.[24] Twelve days after a single dose of b evacizumab to patients 
with rectal carcinoma, bevacizumab decreased tumor perfusion, v ascular volume, 
microvascular density, tumor interstitial fluid pressure (IFP),  and circulating ECs and 
endothelial progenitor cells. Elevated IFP, a hallmark of solid  tumors, is a result of 
abnormalities in tumor vessels, and constitutes a major impedim ent for drug access to the 
inner layers of the tumor lesion. These authors also observed a n increase in vessel 
pericyte coverage after a single dose of bevacizumab, with no c hanges in tumor uptake in 
PET despite a 40-50% reduction in its microvessel density, sugg esting that the residual 
normalized vasculature was more efficient. 
Additionally, bevacizumab appears to have direct cytotoxic anti tumor effects, through 
blockade of VEGF binding to the neuropilin-1 receptor, which ca n result in apoptosis. A 
single dose of bevacizumab has been shown to cause a 67% decrea se in expression of 
phosphorylated VEGR-2 and a 130% increase in tumor apoptosis in  breast cancer 
patients.[25]  
In consequence, bevacizumab is synergistic with chemotherapy. V EGF inhibition 
transiently ‘normalizes’ the disorganized and dysfunctional tum or vasculature, improving 
the delivery of oxygen and cytotoxic drugs to tumor cells.[26] The bevacizumab-induced 
drop in IFP leads to a hydrostatic pressure gradient across the  tumor vasculature, which 
enhances penetration of large molecules in tumors.[27] Addition ally, increased 
oxygenation sensitizes cancer cells to cytotoxics. Finally, bev acizumab counteracts the 
chemotherapy-induced VEGF upregulation and increased tumor resi stance.[28] 
Phase III studies of bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy hav e shown efficacy in 
2008-0378

multiple metastatic settings, such as colorectal cancer,[29, 30 ] breast cancer,[31] or 
non-small cell lung cancer.[32] 
2.5. Toxicity Profile of Bevacizumab 
1.  Hypertension  is its most common side effect, with a 10-15% incidence of gra de 3 
events, and rare grade 4 cases. Its mechanism may be the decrea se of nitric oxide 
production. It responds well to treatment with angiotensin conv erting enzyme 
inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. It usually resolves onc e bevacizumab is 
discontinued.
2.  Proteinuria  is seen in 23% of patients, and is largely asymptomatic.
3. Minor bleeding complications , particularly epistaxis,  occur in 20-40% of patients, 
without changes in biochemical, coagulation or hematologic para meters. 
Life-threatening intratumor hemorrhages have been reported in p atients with 
centrally located, cavitated squamous cell lung cancer, or in p arenchymal brain 
metastases.
4. While there appears to be no increase in the risk of venous thromboembolism, 
there is a small increase in the risk of arterial thrombosis  (<4%). 
5. Wound healing complications  can occur in up to 10% of pts undergoing surgery 
during bevacizumab treatment, but there appears to be no increa sed risk in 
patients who had surgery more than 30 days prior to bevacizumab .
6. Bowel perforation . This complication has been observed in up to 11% of patients 
with heavily pretreated epithelial ovarian cancers. It has been  reported in 1% of 
the patients with colorectal cancer treated with bevacizumab, a nd has not been 
seen in any other tumor type treated with bevacizumab.    
2.6. Clinical Experience with Bevacizumab in Pediatric Patients
Bevacizumab is well tolerated in children at the same doses use d in adults.[33, 34] The 
side effects in the pediatric population are mild and similar t o that previously observed in 
adults: proteinuria, epistaxis, and neutropenia. 
2.7. Rationale for Combining Bevacizumab with High-Dose Chemothe rapy
The combination of bevacizumab and Gem/DMC and ICE may result i n major synergy. 
In murine models, the combination of bevacizumab and paclitaxel  significantly reduced 
tumor growth compared to paclitaxel alone.[35] In vitro and in vivo preclinical studies 
show that VEGF protects endothelial cells against the antiangio genic effects of docetaxel 
and that this action is inhibited by bevacizumab.[36] Encouragi ng activity has been 
observed using bevacizumab and docetaxel in patients with metas tatic breast cancer.[37] 
Synergy between platinum compounds and bevacizumab has also bee n shown in murine 
2008-0378
February 26, 2015
Page 8
models.[38] There is also good evidence of synergy between gemc itabine and 
bevacizumab [39,40]. 
The synergy between bevacizumab and chemotherapy seem to be due , at least in part, to 
bevacizumab-induced drop in intratumor IFP, which results in an  improved 
chemotherapy delivery to the tumor cells. Thus, this augmentati on effect likely depends 
on the peak concentration of the cytotoxic agent and a more rap id diffusion down a 
concentration gradient into the permeabilized tumor. This may e xplain why bevacizumab 
seems to add more efficacy to chemotherapy when this is adminis tered intravenously 
than when given in prolonged oral treatments, such as capecitab ine.[41]  
Additionally, the IFP changes induced by bevacizumab are transi ent by nature,[42] which 
suggests that this benefit is likely to disappear through long- term chronic treatments, as 
seen in all randomized trials comparing chemotherapy with or wi thout bevacizumab 
where the tails of the EFS curves merge. This should not apply to the limited use of 
bevacizumab prior to each of the two HDC cycles as proposed in this study.
We are currently testing the combination of bevacizumab with Ge m/DMC in a separate 
phase II trial for patients with relapsed ovarian cancer (#2007 -0368).

Every effort will be made to admit the patient for prehydration  on any day but Saturday 
or Sunday, so that the stem-cell infusion can proceed during a week day. 
The order of chemotherapy on days -6 to -3 will be as follows: The 96-hour infusion of 
Mesna will be started on day -6 thirty minutes prior to the fir st dose of Ifosfamide.The 
first of the two daily doses of Etoposide will be given after t he Ifosfamide infusion is 
complete. The daily dose of Carboplatin will be given after the  first daily dose of 
Etoposide. 
Patients with creatinine >1.2 mg/dL or performance status of 2 will receive a reduced 
version of this regimen:

Administration of antiemetics during chemotherapy is recommende d, following the 
departmental standards. The use of concomitant medications shou ld be avoided whenever 
possible to minimize potentially harmful interactions. Medicall y necessary medications 
or procedures shall ultimately be at the discretion of the trea ting physician. 
Acetaminophen (Tylenol) shall not be administered for 72 hr bef ore and on the day of 
administration of carboplatin or melphalan.

6.4. Determination of Dosing Body Surface Area (BSA)
For patients whose actual body weight (BW) is </= 20% above the  ideal BW, the actual 
BW is used to calculate the BSA. For patients whose actual BW i s >20% above ideal 
BW, an “adjusted BW”, defined as the midpoint between the actua l and ideal BW, will be 
used to calculate an “adjusted BSA” for chemotherapy dosing cal culation purposes.
7.0 Post Treatment Evaluation
During each course
Adverse events (toxicity) assessment while admitted in hospital , patients will be 
monitored on a daily basis by the in-patient team. Once dischar ged, once a week until 
admission for course 2.
Between course 1 and 2:
a) CBC, differential and platelet count, coagulation profile (PT  and PTT)
b) Chemistry panel including creatinine, albumin, electrolytes, glucose,albumin, total 
protein, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, bilirubin, LDH.c) Chest x-rayd) Urine dipstick. If proteinuria >/= 2+, a 24-hour urine collec tion for total protein will 
be performed.e) Tumor markers (AFP and/or B-HCG)

2):
Once discharged, from course 2, the patient will come once a we ek or as determined by 
primary physician until day +30. From that time on, patients wi ll be evaluated every 1-2 
months until day +100, at which time treatment safety completio n assessment will be 
performed with:  
1- Adverse events (toxicity) assessment (standard for autologou s stem cell 
transplantation):
a) History and physical examination.b) CBC, differential and platelet count, coagulation profile (PT  and PTT).

8.0 Evaluation Criteria
8.1.1 Neutrophil recovery:  is defined as the first day of a sustained absolute 
neutrophil count (ANC) >  0.5 x 109/L for 3 consecutive days by day 28. 
Graft Failure  is defined as failure to achieve an ANC >  0.5 x 109/L for 3 
consecutive days by day 28, with <10% cellularity on bone marro w biopsy.
Secondary graft failure  is defined as a sustained decline of ANC <0.5 x 109/L for 3 
consecutive days after initial documented engraftment. 
8.1.2 Response definitions : See Appendix E.
            8.1.3 Overall survival

if the patient is alive, or death from any cause
8.1.4 Event-free survival  will be estimated from the first day of HDC #1 (day-6) until 
tumor progression, relapse, or death from any cause. 
9.0 Adverse Events and Reporting Requirements
The intensity of adverse events (AE) will be assessed according  to the Common 
Terminology Criteria v3.0 (CTCAE).  Collection of adverse event s will reflect the 
onset and resolution date and maximum grade.  Intermittent even ts should be 
labeled as such and followed until resolution. If a patient is taken off study while 
an event is still ongoing, this will be followed until resoluti on unless another 
therapy is initiated.  Pre-existing medical conditions will be recorded only if an 
exacerbation occurs during the active treatment period. Co-morb id events will not 
be scored separately.
Adverse events (toxicities) known to be produced by the chemoth erapy regimen:
1- Mucositis : It starts early after transplant, peaks in severity around da y +2.
2- Diarrhea : It presents in the first hospital week after transplant.
3- Constipation/Ileus:  It can occur in the first week after transplant.
2008-0378
February 26, 2015
Page 15
4- Enterocolitis  (abdominal pain with/without bleeding, diarrhea or constipatio n): It can 
occur in the second week, and lasts for around one week. 
5- Hepatic : early and transient elevations of liver function enzymes, typ ically 
starting around day -3 and resolving within 1 week.
6- Pulmonary : manifested as progressive or acute dyspnea, tachypnea, 
hypoxemia and pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph that ar e sometimes 
accompanied by fever and cough, due to pulmonary edema, egnraft ment 
syndrome or, more rarely, toxic interstitial pneumonitis.
7- Skin : mild to moderate in severity, appearing in the first week aft er transplant 
as a macular or finely granular maculopapular pruritic eruption  on the trunk and 
extremities usually responds to moisturizing petrolatum ("Aquap hore") or topical 
corticosteroids
8- Nails:  Asymptomatic partial or complete nail loss can occur weeks aft er 
transplant. Nails grow back within 2 to 3 months.
9- Hand-foot syndrome : it appears in the first week after transplant and can be 
treated successfully with piridoxine.
10- Myoarthralgia : It appears early, typically around day -3, and lasts for arou nd 2-3 more 
days.
11- Asthenia (fatigue) : it is the most prominent symptom after hospital discharge. Mo st 
cases respond rapidly to mehtylphenidate ("Ritalin").
12- Neurologic : peripheral neuropathy that starts around 1-2 weeks after 
transplant and improves within a few weeks. A few patients can experience 
neuropathic pain. 
13- Neutropenic fever of unknow origin  with negative cultures during the 
second week. It is thought to be largely related to cytokine re lease. It can be 
prevented in many patients using steroids, a strategy that has been shown to be 
safe.
Adverse events (toxicities) known to be produced by other compo nents of the 
treatment:
The following events are not considered to be significant in re lationship with the 
study treatment, would not be considered adverse events, and wo uld not be 
collected in the study database.

medications) including steroid- related side effects.
Adverse Events Considered Serious (SAEs):
a) Prolonged hospitalization due to infections and/or organ fai lure requiring 
extensive supportive care (i.e. dialysis, mechanical ventilatio n)
b) Readmissions from any cause resulting in a prolonged hospita lization (>10 
days).c) Any expected or unexpected event resulting in an irreversibl e condition and/ or 
leading to death.
Reporting Requirements:
Drug toxicities will be evaluated according to CTC version 3 (A ppendix A). Serious and 
unexpected adverse events occurring during the patient particip ation on this study will be 
reported to the PI or his designate, who in turn will notify th e IRB and Clinical Research 
Compliance (CRC) office. 
In order to assure appropriate monitoring for toxicities, each patient will be followed for 
30 days after transplant or until documentation of reversal of all toxicities is obtained. 
Additionally, the patient will be seen approximately 3 months ( range 2-4 months) after 
transplant for follow-up of therapeutic and toxic effects.
All other life-threatening (grade 4) or fatal (grade 5) events with possible, probable or 
definite attribution to the study drug must have a written repo rt transmitted  within 24 
hours (next working day) of knowledge of the event to the CRC o ffice and the original 
submitted to the IRB
This study will be conducted as described in this protocol, exc ept for an emergency 
situation in which the protection, safety and well-being of the  patient requires immediate 
intervention, based on the judgment of the investigator or his/ her designee. In the event 
of a significant deviation from the protocol, the investigator will notify the IRB.
All laboratory and clinical data gathered in this protocol will  be stored in a 
password-protected database. All patient information will be ha ndled using 
anonymous identifiers. Linkage to patient identity is only poss ible after accessing 
a password-protected database. Access to the database is only a vailable to 
individuals directly involved in the study.
Information gathered for this study will not be reused or discl osed to any other 
person or entity, or for other research. Once the research has been completed, 
identifiers will be retained for as long as is required by law and by institutional 
regulations, and at that point will be destroyed.
10.0 Statistical Design
10.1. Objectives
2008-0378
February 26, 2015
Page 17
The original primary objective of this phase II trial was to ev aluate the efficacy of treating testicular 
cancer patients with the proposed treatment of tandem high-dose  cycles of 
bevacizumab/gemcitabine/docetaxel/melphalan/carboplatin and bevacizumab/ifosfamide/carboplatin/etoposide.  The primary endp oint is 2-year event-free survival 
(EFS).  The currently used HDC regimens in patients with relaps ed disease are associated with a 2-year 
EFS rate of 15% in the population targeted in this trial, and i t is expected that the proposed treatment may 
increase 2-year EFS to 50%.  In December 2014, because of data available from patients with the same 
indication treated without bevacizumab, the study will be modif ied to treat a new cohort of patients with a 
similar treatment regimen, which will no longer include bevaciz umab.  The modified primary objective is 
to evaluate EFS separately in the two patient cohorts.  A secon dary objective to compare outcomes 
between the two cohorts has been added.  A total of 40 patients  were treated as part of the original cohort, 
and we will treat a total of 40 patients in this new cohort.
10.2.  Efficacy Monitoring
The efficacy of the original cohort of patients was monitored u sing a Bayesian one-arm 
time-to-progression (TTP) design.  Details are provided in Appe ndix K.  A total of 40 patients was treated 
in this cohort, and the trial did not stop early for lack of ef ficacy.
In February 2015 the trial is modified to add a second cohort o f patients.  This cohort will be treated with 
the same regimen as the original cohort, except that patients w ill not receive bevacizumab.  We will use a 
similar monitoring rule to monitor patient data in the second c ohort of patients treated without 
bevacizumab.  We assume in this cohort that event-free survival  (EFS) follows an exponential distribution 
and first note that, under this assumption, an EFS rate of 15% at 24 months corresponds to a median EFS 
of 8.77 months.  Patients who are lost to follow-up before dise ase progression will be censored at the time 
of last follow-up in the calculation of EFS.  We note that a 50 % EFS rate at 24 months corresponds to a 
median EFS of 24 months.  We assume that the median EFS for the  standard of care (historical controls) 
has an inverse gamma (IG) distribution with parameters (21.23, 177.40), which has a mean of 8.77 
months and a variance of 4.0 months.  These prior parameters ca n be interpreted as providing information 
based on about 21 events observed over 177 months of trial time . The prior distribution for the median 
EFS for the experimental group in this trial is set to be IG(3,  17.54), which has the same mean, 8.77 
months, but a greater variance of 77 months. This wider varianc e reflects our uncertainty regarding the 
EFS rate in the experimental group.  
A maximum of 40 patients will be enrolled in this cohort. We wi ll continuously monitor EFS in the 
cohort based on the following futility monitoring rule: 
Stop accrual if Pr(Te2 > Ts+15 | data from the trial) < 0.01
where Te2 and Ts are the median EFS of the experimental arm (wi thout bevacizumab) and historical 
controls, respectively.  Ts is distributed as IG(21.23, 177.40)  as specified previously. In other words, if at 
any time during the course of the trial, the probability that t he median EFS is at least 15 months longer 
than the median EFS for historical controls is less than 1%, we  will stop the trial.  The stopping 
boundaries for this trial will be incorporated into the Clinica l Trial Conduct Monitoring website for this 
study found at https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/ClinicalTrialConduct
.  
Assuming an accrual rate of 1 patient/2 months and following th e monitoring boundaries according to the 
above rule, we summarize operating characteristics based upon 2 000 simulations of the trial under two 
scenarios: 1) a true EFS rate of 15% at 2 years, and 2) a true EFS rate of 50% at 2 years.  Under the first 
scenario, we will have a 98.2% chance of stopping the trial ear ly and declaring that the treatment does not 
work (and thus a 1.2% chance of falsely concluding that the tre atment dose work).  An average of 14.3 
2008-0378
February 26, 2015
Page 18
patients will be treated in this scenario.
Under the second scenario, we will have a 4.0% chance of stoppi ng the trial early and falsely concluding 
that the trial does not work. In this scenario, an average of 3 8.7 patients will be treated.
10.3. Safety Monitoring
In the original study design, in addition to monitoring EFS, we  also used a monitoring rule to ensure that 
the rate of treatment-related mortality (TRM) at 3 months is lo w.  Patients were monitored separately by 
risk (standard-risk and high-risk), and details are provided in  Appendix K.  Safety in the new cohort of 
patients treated without bevacizumab will be monitored using a similar rule, using the method of Thall, 
Simon, and Estey (1995) to monitor TRM, starting with the 5th p atient in the trial.  Separate monitoring 
rules are provided for standard-risk patients in the trial and high-risk patients, defined as those patients 
with a creatinine > 1.2 mg/dL or performance status of 2.  We e xpect two-thirds of the new cohort (27 
patients) to be standard-risk and the rest (13 patients) to be high-risk.
We will monitor the safety of the standard-risk patients by usi ng the following Bayesian decision 
monitoring rule: stop accrual of standard-risk patients if at a ny time during the course of the trial
Pr{TRM > 5% | data from the trial} > 0.95
In other words, we will stop if the probability is > 95% at any  time that the rate of 3-month TRM in the 
standard-risk patients is > 5%.  We will assume a Beta(0.1,1.9)  prior distribution for the TRM rate in 
these patients.  A Beta(0.1, 1.9) prior distribution has a mean  of 5%, the targeted maximum TRM rate, but 
carries little information.  This decision rule leads to the fo llowing stopping rule: stop the trial if 
[# of standard-risk patients with TRM at 3 months / # of standa rd-risk
patients evaluated at 3 months]:  >/=  2/2, 3/8, or 4/18
The operating characteristics of this rule based upon 10000 sim ulations of the trial are shown in the Table 
4.  The table provides the proportion of the time that the stan dard-risk group in the second cohort in the 
trial will stop early for different assumptions about the true 3-month TRM rate as well as the median and 
quartiles for the sample size.  For example, if the true TRM ra te in the standard-risk patients in this cohort 
is 5%, the cohort will stop early 8.5% of the time.  If the tru e rate of TRM is 20%, the cohort will 
terminate early more than 80% of the time.

10% 34.6% 16 27 27
20% 84.0% 5 12 21
30% 98.2% 4 6 11
We provide a separate monitoring rule for the high-risk patient s in the second cohort.  We expect to enroll 
13 such patients.  We will stop entry into this group if at any  time during the course of the trial
Pr{TRM > 10% | data from the trial} > 0.95
2008-0378
February 26, 2015
Page 19
In other words, we will stop entry in high-risk patients if the  probability is > 95% at any time that the rate 
of 3-month TRM in the high-risk patients is > 10%.  We will ass ume a Beta(0.2, 1.8) prior distribution for 
the TRM rate.  This prior distribution has a mean of 10%, the t argeted maximum TRM rate, but carries 
little information.  This decision rule leads to the following stopping rule: stop the trial if 
[# of high-risk patients with TRM at 3 months / # of high-risk
patients evaluated at 3 months]: >/=  2/2, 3/4, or 4/9
The operating characteristics of this rule based upon 10000 sim ulations of the trial are shown in the Table 
4.  The table provides the proportion of the time that the high -risk group in the second cohort will stop 
early for different assumptions about the true 3-month TRM rate  as well as the median and quartiles for 
the sample size.

10.4 Analysis Plan
The response rate (RR) and complete response (CR) rate will be estimated and reported along with 95% 
confidence intervals separately for each cohort and by risk sub groups.
Because the two cohorts of patients are not randomized, propens ity score analysis will be used to compare 
EFS and OS between the two patient cohorts.  We will explore bo th propensity score matching and 
inverse probability weighting techniques.  The response rates R R and CR will also be compared between 
the two patient cohorts by using propensity score analysis meth ods.
Safety data will be summarized, including the extramedullary si de effect profile and the engraftment rate 
for Bev/Gem/DMC and Bev/ICE.  Overall survival (OS) and event-f ree survival (EFS) will be estimated 
using the method of Kaplan and Meier.
Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency tables .  The Cox proportional hazards 
regression model will be used to assess the association between  covariates of interest on EFS and OS.  
Logistic regression will be used to assess the effects of covar iates of interest upon RR and CR.
11.0 Background Drug Information
11.1.  Melphalan (Alkeran®)
Melphalan is an alkylating agent of the bischloroethylamine typ e.  As a result, its 
cytotoxicity appears to be related to the extent of its interst rand cross-linking with DNA, 
2008-0378
February 26, 2015
Page 20
probably by binding at the N7 position of guanine.  Like other bifunctional alkylating 
agents, it is active against both resting and rapidly dividing tumor cells.
Formulation:   Melphalan for injection is supplied as a sterile, nonpyrogeni c, freeze-dried 
powder.  Each single-use vial contains melphalan hydrochloride equivalent to 50 mg 
melphalan and 20 mg povidone.
Preparation:   Melphalan for injection must be reconstituted by rapidly inje cting 10 mL of 
the supplied diluent directly into the vial of lyophilized powd er using a sterile needle and 
syringe.  This provides a 5 mg/mL solution of melphalan.  Immed iately dilute the dose to 
be administered in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to a co ncentration not greater 
than 0.45 mg/mL.  Administer the diluted product over a minimum  of 15 minutes.  
Complete the administration within 60 minutes of reconstitution .
Storage and stability:   Melphalan for injection vials should be stored at controlled room 
temperature 15o to 30o C (59o to 86o F) and protected from light.  The time between 
reconstitution/dilution and administration of melphalan should be kept to a minimum 
because reconstituted and diluted solutions of melphalan are un stable.  Over as short a 
time as 30 minutes, a citrate derivative of melphalan has been detected in reconstituted 
material from the reaction of melphalan with the diluent.  Upon  further dilution with 
saline, nearly 1% label strength of melphalan hydrolizes every 10 minutes.  A precipitate 
forms if the reconstituted solution is stored at 5o C.  Do not refrigerate the reconstituted 
product. 
Adverse events associated with melphalan:   The following information on adverse 
reactions is based on data from both oral and IV administration  of melphalan as a single 
agent, using several different dose schedules for treatment of a wide variety of 
malignancies.  Please refer to the Adverse Reactions and Warnin gs sections of the 
product package insert.
Hematologic:   The most common side effect is bone marrow suppression.  Whit e blood 
cell count and platelet count nadirs usually occur 2 to 3 weeks  after treatment, with 
recovery in 4 to 5 weeks after treatment.  Irreversible bone ma rrow failure has been 
reported.
Gastrointestinal:   Gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting, di arrhea, 
and oral ulceration occur infrequently.  Hepatic toxicity, incl uding veno-occlusive 
disease, has been reported.
Hypersensitivity:   Acute hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis were r eported 
in 2.4% of 425 patients receiving melphalan for myeloma.  These  reactions were 
characterized by urticaria, pruritus, edema, and in some patien ts, tachycardia, 
hypotension and bronchospasm.  These patients appeared to respo nd to antihistamine and 
corticosteroid therapy.  If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs,  IV or oral melphalan should 
not be readministered since hypersensitivity reactions have als o been reported with oral 
melphalan.
Carcinogenesis:  Secondary malignancies, including acute nonlymphocytic leukemia , 
2008-0378
February 26, 2015
Page 21
myeloproliferative syndrome, and carcinoma, have been reported in patients with cancer 
treated with alkylating agents (including melphalan).
Other:   Other reported adverse reactions include skin hypersensitivit y, skin ulceration at 
injection site, skin necrosis rarely requiring skin grafting, v asculitis, alopecia, hemolytic 
anemia, pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial pneumonitis. 
11.2. Gemcitabine
SYNONYM(S): Gemcitabine hydrochloride, 
difluorodeoxycytidine,2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine, dFdC, LY 188 011
COMMON TRADE NAME(S): Gemzar® (notice of compliance,1 December 1996; 
patent expires2 March 2004)
CLASSIFICATION: Antimetabolite, cytotoxic
Special pediatric considerations are noted when applicable, otherwise adult provisions 
apply.
MECHANISM OF ACTION: 
Gemcitabine, a pyrimidine analog, is structurally similar to cy tarabine, but has a wider 
spectrum of antitumour activity due to its different cellular p harmacology and mechanism 
of action.3 Gemcitabine is metabolized intracellularly to two a ctive metabolites, 
gemcitabine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and gemcitabine triphosphate ( dFdCTP). The 
cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine are exerted through incorporat ion of dFdCTP into DNA 
with the assistance of dFdCDP, resulting in inhibition of DNA s ynthesis and induction of 
apoptosis. emcitabine is a radiation-sensitizing agent.5 It is cell-cycle phase specific (S 
and G1/S-phases).
PHARMACOKINETICS: 
Interpatient variability: 3- to 4-fold interpatient and intrapa tient variability
Distribution: widely distributed into tissues; also present in ascitic fluid 
Volume of distribution: IV infusion < 70 min: 50 L/m2;IV infusi on 70-285 min: 370 
L/m2
Plasma protein binding: < 10%Metabolism: Metabolized intracellularly by nucleoside kinases t o active metabolites 
dFdCDP and dFdCTP; also metabolized intracellularly and extrace llularly by cytidine 
deaminase to inactive metabolite difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU)
Excretion: Urine 92-98% over one week (89% as dFdU, < 10% as ge mcitabine) after a 
single dose of 1000 mg/m2 given over 30 minutes

Hemolytic uremic syndrome has been infrequently reported and is characterized by 
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal f ailure. The syndrome 
can present either acutely with severe hemolysis, thrombocytope nia and rapidly 
progressive renal failure, or more insidiously with mild or no thrombocytopenia and 
slowly progressive renal failure. The etiology of hemolytic ure mic syndrome is 
unknown.The onset of the syndrome has been reported to occur du ring and shortly after 
gemcitabine therapy. If not treated promptly, the syndrome may result in irreversible

renal failure requiring dialysis. Therefore, patients with impa ired renal function should be 
monitored closely while being treated with gemcitabine.
Elevated liver enzymes: Gemcitabine causes transient and reversible elevations of liver  
function enzymes in about two-thirds of patients. However, thes e increases are rarely of 
clinical significance and there is no evidence of increasing he patic toxicity with either 
longer duration of gemcitabine treatment or cumulative dose.
 Fever/Flu-like symptoms:  Fever of any severity was reported in 37% of patients. It is 
frequently associated with other flu-like symptoms such as head ache, chills, cough, 
rhinitis, myalgia, fatigue, sweating and insomnia. These sympto ms are usually mild and 
transient, and rarely dose-limiting. The use of acetaminophen m ay provide symptomatic 
relief. 
Severe pulmonary toxicity : Acute dyspnea may sometimes occur with gemcitabine 
therapy, but is usually self-limiting. However, severe pulmonar y toxicities such as 
pulmonary edema, interstitial pneumonitis and adult respiratory  distress syndrome have 
rarely been reported. The symptoms are manifested as progressiv e dyspnea, tachypnea, 
hypoxemia and pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph that ar e sometimes 
accompanied by fever and cough. Pulmonary toxicities usually oc cur after several cycles 
of gemcitabine, but have also been seen as early as the first c ycle. Risk factors for 
pulmonary toxicities include prior radiation to the mediastinum . Because of its structural 
similarities to cytarabine, gemcitabine is thought to cause lun g injury by the same 
mechanism by inducing pulmonary capillary leakage. Management o f pulmonary 
toxicities consists of discontinuation of gemcitabine and early  supportive care with 
bronchodilators, corticosteroids, diuretics, and/or oxygen. Alt hough pulmonary toxicities 
may be reversible with treatment, fatal recurrence of severe pu lmonary symptoms was 
reported in one patient upon rechallenge with gemcitabine.
Skin rash : Typically mild to moderate in severity, with macular or finely granular 
maculopapular pruritic eruption on the trunk and extremities. I t is not dose-limiting and 
usually responds to topical corticosteroidsIf needed, antihista mines such as 
diphenhydramine can be used.

11.3. Carboplatin
Carboplatin injection
WARNING
Carboplatin for injection should be administered under the supe rvision of a qualified 
physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic age nts. Appropriate 
management of therapy and complications is possible only when a dequate treatment 
facilities are readily available.Bone marrow suppression is dose related and may be severe, resu lting in infection and/or 
bleeding. Anemia may be cumulative and may require transfusion support. Vomiting is 
another frequent drug-related side effect.
Anaphylactic-like reactions to carboplatin have been reported a nd may occur within 
minutes of carboplatin administration. Epinephrine, corticoster oids, and antihistamines 
have been employed to alleviate symptoms.

Carboplatin Description
Carboplatin for Injection USP is supplied as a sterile, lyophil ized white powder available 
in single-dose vials containing 50 mg, 150 mg, or 450 mg of car boplatin for 
administration by intravenous infusion. Each vial contains equa l parts by weight 
carboplatin and mannitol.Carboplatin is a platinum coordination compound that is used as  a cancer 
chemotherapeutic agent. The chemical name for carboplatin is pl atinum, diammine 
[1,1-cyclobutane-dicarboxylato(2-)-0,0’]-, (SP-4-2).
Carboplatin is a crystalline powder with the molecular formula of C6H12N2O4Pt and a 
molecular weight of 371.25. It is soluble in water at a rate of  approximately 14 mg/mL, 
and the pH of a 1% solution is 5 to 7. It is virtually insolubl e in ethanol, acetone, and 
dimethylacetamide.
Carboplatin - Clinical Pharmacology
Carboplatin, like cisplatin, produces predominantly interstrand  DNA cross-links rather 
than DNA-protein cross-links. This effect is apparently cell-cy cle nonspecific. The 
aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active  species, occurs at a slower 
rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it  appears that both carboplatin 
and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, cau sing equivalent lesions 
and biological effects. The differences in potencies for carbop latin and cisplatin appear to 
be directly related to the difference in aquation rates.
In patients with creatinine clearances of about 60 mL/min or gr eater, plasma levels of 
intact carboplatin decay in a biphasic manner after a 30-minute  intravenous infusion of 
300 to 500 mg/m2 of carboplatin. The initial plasma half-life ( alpha) was found to be 1.1 
to 2 hours (N=6), and the post-distribution plasma half-life (b eta) was found to be 2.6 to 
5.9 hours (N=6). The total body clearance, apparent volume of d istribution and mean 
residence time for carboplatin are 4.4 L/hour, 16 L and 3.5 hou rs, respectively. The Cmax 
values and areas under the plasma concentration vs time curves from 0 to infinity (AUC 
inf) increase linearly with dose, although the increase was sli ghtly more than dose 
proportional. Carboplatin, therefore, exhibits linear pharmacok inetics over the dosing 
range studied (300 to 500 mg/m2 ).
Carboplatin is not bound to plasma proteins. No significant qua ntities of protein-free, 
ultrafilterable platinum-containing species other than carbopla tin are present in plasma. 
However, platinum from carboplatin becomes irreversibly bound t o plasma proteins and 
is slowly eliminated with a minimum half-life of 5 days.
The major route of elimination of carboplatin is renal excretio n. Patients with creatinine 
clearances of approximately 60 mL/min or greater excrete 65% of  the dose in the urine 
within 12 hours and 71% of the dose within 24 hours. All of the  platinum in the 24-hour 
urine is present as carboplatin. Only 3 to 5% of the administer ed platinum is excreted in 
the urine between 24 and 96 hours. There are insufficient data to determine whether 
biliary excretion occurs.
2008-0378
February 26, 2015
Page 27
In patients with creatinine clearances below 60 mL/min the tota l body and renal 
clearances carboplatin decrease as the creatinine clearance dec reases. Carboplatin 
dosages should therefore be reduced in these patients.The primary determinant of carboplatin clearance is glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and 
this parameter of renal function is often decreased in elderly patients. Dosing formulas 
incorporating estimates of GFR to provide predictable carboplat in plasma AUCs should 
be used in elderly patients to minimize the risk of toxicity.
Contraindications
Carboplatin is contraindicated in patients with a history of se vere allergic reactions to 
cisplatin or other platinum-containing compounds.
Carboplatin should not be employed in patients with severe bone  marrow depression or 
significant bleeding.
Warnings
Bone marrow suppression (leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocy topenia) is 
dose-dependent and is also the dose-limiting toxicity. Peripher al blood counts should be 
frequently monitored during carboplatin treatment and, when app ropriate, until recovery 
is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receivin g single-agent carboplatin. 
In general, single intermittent courses of carboplatin should n ot be repeated until 
leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered.
Since anemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during t reatment with 
carboplatin, particularly in patients receiving prolonged thera py.
Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have recei ved prior therapy, 
especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients 
with impaired kidney function. Initial carboplatin dosages in t hese patients should be 
appropriately reduced and blood counts should be carefully moni tored between courses. 
The use of carboplatin in combination with other bone marrow su ppressing therapies 
must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimize 
additive effects.
Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with 
aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiolog ic toxicity, and caution 
must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinicall y significant hearing loss 
has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplat in was administered at 
higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxi c agents.
Carboplatin can induce emesis, which can be more severe in pati ents previously 
receiving emetogenic therapy. The incidence and intensity of em esis have been reduced 
by using premedication with antiemetics. Although no conclusive  efficacy data exist with 
the following schedules of carboplatin, lengthening the duratio n of single intravenous 
administration to 24 hours or dividing the total dose over five  consecutive daily pulse 
doses has resulted in reduced emesis.
2008-0378
February 26, 2015
Page 28
Although peripheral neurotoxicity is infrequent, its incidence is increased in patients 
older than 65 years and in patients previously treated with cis platin. Pre-existing 
cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity does not worsen in about 70% of  the patients receiving 
carboplatin as secondary treatment.
Loss of vision, which can be complete for light and colors, has  been reported after the use 
of carboplatin with doses higher than those recommended in the package insert. Vision 
appears to recover totally or to a significant extent within we eks of stopping these high 
doses.
As in the case of other platinum coordination compounds, allerg ic reactions to 
carboplatin have been reported. These may occur within minutes of administration and 
should be managed with appropriate supportive therapy. There is  increased risk of 
allergic reactions including anaphylaxis in patients previously  exposed to platinum 
therapy. 
High dosages of carboplatin (more than four times the recommend ed dose) have resulted 
in severe abnormalities of liver function tests.
Carboplatin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnan t woman. Carboplatin 
has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats. There  are no adequate and 
well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used  during pregnancy, or if 
the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the pat ient should be apprised of 
the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potent ial should be advised to 
avoid becoming pregnant.
PRECAUTIONS 
General
Needles or intravenous administration sets containing aluminum parts that may come in 
contact with carboplatin should not be used for the preparation  or administration of the 
drug. Aluminum can react with carboplatin causing precipitate f ormation and loss of 
potency.
Drug Interactions 
The renal effects of nephrotoxic compounds may be potentiated b y carboplatin.
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
The carcinogenic potential of carboplatin has not been studied,  but compounds with 
similar mechanisms of action and mutagenicity profiles have bee n reported to be 
carcinogenic. Carboplatin has been shown to be mutagenic both i n vitro and in vivo. It 
has also been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats r eceiving the drug during 
organogenesis. Secondary malignancies have been reported in ass ociation with 
multi-drug therapy.

Teratogenic Effects; Pregnancy Category D.
Nursing Mothers
It is not known whether carboplatin is excreted in human milk. Because there is a 
possibility of toxicity in nursing infants secondary to carbopl atin treatment of the mother, 
it is recommended that breast feeding be discontinued if the mo ther is treated with 
carboplatin.
Pediatric Use
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been es tablished.
Geriatric Use
Of the 789 patients in initial treatment combination therapy st udies (NCIC and SWOG), 
395 patients were treated with carboplatin in combination with cyclophosphamide. Of 
these, 141 were over 65 years of age and 22 were 75 years or ol der. In these trials, age 
was not a prognostic factor for survival. In terms of safety, e lderly patients treated with 
carboplatin were more likely to develop severe thrombocytopenia  than younger patients. 
In a combined database of 1942 patients (414 were ꞏ65 years of age) that received single 
agent carboplatin for different tumor types, a similar incidenc e of adverse events as seen 
in patients 65 years and older and in patients less than 65. Ot her reported clinical 
experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger 
patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals can not be ruled out. Because 
renal function is often decreased in the elderly, renal functio n should be considered in the 
selection of carboplatin dosage.
Adverse Reactions
Hematologic Toxicity
Bone marrow suppression is the dose-limiting toxicity of carbop latin. Thrombocytopenia 
with platelet counts below 50,000/mm3 occurs in 25% of the pati ents (35% of pretreated 
ovarian cancer patients); neutropenia with granulocyte counts b elow 1000/mm3 occurs in 
16% of the patients (21% of pretreated ovarian cancer patients) ; leukopenia with WBC 
counts below 2000/mm3 occurs in 15% of the patients (26% of pre treated ovarian cancer 
patients). The nadir usually occurs about day 21 in patients re ceiving single-agent 
therapy. By day 28, 90% of patients have platelet counts above 100,000/mm3; 74% have 
neutrophil counts above 2000/mm3; 67% have leukocyte counts abo ve 4000/mm3.
Marrow suppression is usually more severe in patients with impa ired kidney function. 
Patients with poor performance status have also experienced a h igher incidence of severe 
leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.The hematologic effects, although usually reversible, have resu lted in infectious or 
hemorrhagic complications in 5% of the patients treated with ca rboplatin, with drug 
related death occurring in less than 1% of the patients. Fever has also been reported in 
patients with neutropenia.
2008-0378
February 26, 2015
Page 30
Anemia with hemoglobin less than 11 g/dL has been observed in 7 1% of the patients who 
started therapy with a baseline above that value. The incidence  of anemia increases with 
increasing exposure to carboplatin. Transfusions have been admi nistered to 26% of the 
patients treated with carboplatin (44% of previously treated ov arian cancer patients).
Bone marrow depression may be more severe when carboplatin is c ombined with other 
bone marrow suppressing drugs or with radiotherapy.
Gastrointestinal Toxicity
Vomiting occurs in 65% of the patients (81% of previously treat ed ovarian cancer 
patients) and in about one-third of these patients it is severe . Carboplatin, as a single 
agent or in combination, is significantly less emetogenic than cisplatin; however, patients 
previously treated with emetogenic agents, especially cisplatin , appear to be more prone 
to vomiting. Nausea alone occurs in an additional 10 to 15% of patients. 
Both nausea and vomiting usually cease within 24 hours of treat ment and are often 
responsive to antiemetic measures. Although no conclusive effic acy data exist with the 
following schedules, prolonged administration of carboplatin, e ither by continuous 
24-hour infusion or by daily pulse doses given for five consecu tive days, was associated 
with less severe vomiting than the single dose intermittent sch edule. 
Emesis was increased when carboplatin was used in combination w ith other emetogenic 
compounds. Other gastrointestinal effects observed frequently w ere pain, in 17% of the 
patients; diarrhea, in 6%; and constipation, also in 6%.
Neurologic Toxicity
Peripheral neuropathies have been observed in 4% of the patient s receiving carboplatin 
(6% of pretreated ovarian cancer patients) with mild paresthesi as occurring most 
frequently. Carboplatin therapy produces significantly fewer an d less severe neurologic 
side effects than does therapy with cisplatin. However, patient s older than 65 years 
and/or previously treated with cisplatin appear to have an incr eased risk (10%) for 
peripheral neuropathies. In 70% of the patients with pre-existi ng cisplatin-induced 
peripheral neurotoxicity, there was no worsening of symptoms du ring therapy with 
carboplatin. Clinical ototoxicity and other sensory abnormaliti es such as visual 
disturbances and change in taste have been reported in only 1% of the patients. Central 
nervous system symptoms have been reported in 5% of the patient s and appear to be most 
often related to the use of antiemetics.
Although the overall incidence of peripheral neurologic side ef fects induced by 
carboplatin is low, prolonged treatment, particularly in cispla tin pretreated patients, may 
result in cumulative neurotoxicity.
Nephrotoxicity
Development of abnormal renal function test results is uncommon , despite the fact that 
carboplatin, unlike cisplatin, has usually been administered wi thout high-volume fluid 
2008-0378
February 26, 2015
Page 31
hydration and/or forced diuresis. The incidences of abnormal re nal function tests reported 
are 6% for serum creatinine and 14% for blood urea nitrogen (10 % and 22%, 
respectively, in pretreated ovarian cancer patients). Most of t hese reported abnormalities 
have been mild and about one-half of them were reversible.
Creatinine clearance has proven to be the most sensitive measur e of kidney function in 
patients receiving carboplatin, and it appears to be the most u seful test for correlating 
drug clearance and bone marrow suppression. Twenty-seven percen t of the patients who 
had a baseline value of 60 mL/min or more demonstrated a reduct ion below this value 
during carboplatin therapy.
Hepatic Toxicity
The incidences of abnormal liver function tests in patients wit h normal baseline values 
were reported as follows: total bilirubin, 5%; SGOT, 15%; and a lkaline phosphatase, 
24%; (5%,19%, and 37%, respectively, in pretreated ovarian canc er patients). These 
abnormalities have generally been mild and reversible in about one-half of the cases, 
although the role of metastatic tumor in the liver may complica te the assessment in many 
patients. In a limited series of patients receiving very high d osages of carboplatin and 
autologous bone marrow transplantation, severe abnormalities of  liver function tests were 
reported.
Electrolyte Changes
The incidences of abnormally decreased serum electrolyte values  reported were as 
follows: sodium, 29%; potassium, 20%; calcium, 22%; and magnesi um, 29%; (47%, 
28%, 31%, and 43%, respectively, in pretreated ovarian cancer p atients). Electrolyte 
supplementation was not routinely administered concomitantly wi th carboplatin, and 
these electrolyte abnormalities were rarely associated with sym ptoms.
Allergic Reactions
Hypersensitivity to carboplatin has been reported in 2% of the patients. These allergic 
reactions have been similar in nature and severity to those rep orted with other 
platinum-containing compounds, i.e., rash, urticaria, erythema,  pruritus, and rarely 
bronchospasm and hypotension. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported as part of 
postmarketing surveillance. These reactions have been successfu lly managed with 
standard epinephrine, corticosteroid, and antihistamine therapy .
Injection Site Reactions
Injection site reactions, including redness, swelling, and pain , have been reported during 
postmarketing surveillance. Necrosis associated with extravasat ion has also been 
reported. 
Other Events
Pain and asthenia were the most frequently reported miscellaneo us adverse effects; their 
relationship to the tumor and to anemia waslikely. Alopecia was  reported (3%). 
Cardiovascular, respiratory, genitourinary, and mucosal side ef fects have occurred in 6% 
or less of the patients. Cardiovascular events (cardiac failure , embolism, cerebrovascular 
2008-0378
February 26, 2015
Page 32
accidents) were fatal in less than 1% of the patients and did n ot appear to be related to 
chemotherapy. Cancer-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome has b een reported rarely.
Malaise, anorexia and hypertension have been reported as part o f postmarketing 
surveillance.
Overdosage
There is no known antidote for carboplatin overdosage. The anti cipated complications of 
overdosage would be secondary to bone marrow suppression and/or  hepatic toxicity.
Formula Dosing
Another approach for determining the initial dose of carboplati n for injection is the use of 
mathematical formulae, which are based on a patient's pre-exist ing renal function or renal 
function and desired platelet nadir. Renal excretion is the maj or route of elimination for 
carboplatin for injection. The use of dosing formulae, as compa red to empirical dose 
calculation based on body surface area, allows compensation for  patient variations in 
pretreatment renal function that might otherwise result in eith er underdosing (in patients 
with above average renal function) or overdosing (in patients w ith impaired renal 
function).A simple formula for calculating dosage, based upon a patients glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR in mL/min) and carboplatin for injection target area under  the concentration versus 
time curve (AUC in mg/mL•min), has been proposed by Calvert. In  these studies, GFR 
was measured by 51Cr-EDTA clearance.  CALVERT FORMULA FOR CARBOPLATIN DOSINGTotal Dose (mg) = (target AUC) x (GFR + 25) Note: With the Calvert formula, the total dose of carboplatin i njection is calculated in 
mg, not mg/m2.
The target AUC of 4 to 6 mg/mL•min using single agent carboplat in for injection appears 
to provide the most appropriate dose range in previously treate d patients. This study also 
showed a trend between the AUC of single agent carboplatin for injection administered 
to previously treated patients and the likelihood of developing  toxicity. 
Geriatric Dosing
Because renal function is often decreased in elderly patients, formula dosing of 
carboplatin based on estimates of GFR should be used in elderly  patients to provide 
predictable plasma carboplatin AUCs and thereby minimize the ri sk of toxicity. 
PREPARATION OF INTRAVENOUS SOLUTIONS
Immediately before use, the content of each vial must be recons tituted with either Sterile 
Water for Injection, 5% Dextrose in Water (D5W), or 0.9% Sodium  Chloride Injection, 
to a carboplatin concentration of 10 mg/mL.Carboplatin for injection can be further diluted to concentrati ons as low as 0.5 mg/mL 
with 5% Dextrose in Water (D5W) or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injecti on.
STABILITY
2008-0378
February 26, 2015
Page 33
Unopened vials of carboplatin for injection are stable for the life indicated on the package 
when stored at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F). See USP controlled ro om temperature and 
protect from light.When prepared as directed, carboplatin solutions are stable for  8 hours at room 
temperature 25°C (77°F). Since no antibacterial preservative is  contained in the 
formulation, it is recommended that carboplatin solutions be di scarded 8 hours after 
dilution.Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for parti culate matter and 
discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and con tainer permit.
STORAGE
Store the unopened vials at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F). See USP controlled room 
temperature. Protect unopened vials from light. Solutions for i nfusion should be 
discarded 8 hours after preparation.
11.4. Docetaxel
WARNING
Docetaxel Injection Concentrate should be administered under th e supervision of a 
qualified physician experienced in the use of antineoplastic ag ents. Appropriate 
management of complications is possible only when adequate diag nostic and treatment 
facilities are readily available.
The incidence of treatment-related mortality associated with Do cetaxel therapy is 
increased in patients with abnormal liver function, in patients  receiving higher doses, and 
in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of  prior treatment with 
platinum-based chemotherapy who receive Docetaxel as a single a gent at a dose of 100 
mg/m2 .
Docetaxel should generally not be given to patients with biliru bin > upper limit of normal 
(ULN), or to patients with SGOT and/or SGPT >1.5 x ULN concomit ant with alkaline 
phosphatase > 2.5 x ULN. Patients with elevations of bilirubin or abnormalities of 
transaminase concurrent with alkaline phosphatase are at increa sed risk for the 
development of grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, infect ions, severe 
thrombocytopenia, severe stomatitis, severe skin toxicity, and toxic death. Patients with 
isolated elevations of transaminase > 1.5 x ULN also had a high er rate of febrile 
neutropenia grade 4 but did not have an increased incidence of toxic death. Bilirubin, 
SGOT or SGPT, and alkaline phosphatase values should be obtaine d prior to each cycle 
of Docetaxel therapy and reviewed by the treating physician.
Docetaxel therapy should not be given to patients with neutroph il counts of < 1500 
cells/mm3. In order to monitor the occurrence of neutropenia, w hich may be severe and 
result in infection, frequent blood cell counts should be perfo rmed on all patients 
receiving Docetaxel .

Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, 
hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylax is, have been reported in 
patients who received the recommended 3-day dexamethasone preme dication. 
Hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of  the Docetaxel infusion 
and administration of appropriate therapy. Docetaxel must not b e given to patients who 
have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to Docetaxe l or to other drugs 
formulated with polysorbate 80. 
Severe fluid retention occurred in 6.5% (6/92) of patients desp ite use of a 3-day 
dexamethasone premedication regimen. It was characterized by on e or more of the 
following events: poorly tolerated peripheral edema, generalize d edema, pleural effusion 
requiring urgent drainage, dyspnea at rest, cardiac tamponade, or pronounced abdominal 
distention (due to ascites).
DESCRIPTION
Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent belonging to the taxoid fa mily. It is prepared by 
semisynthesis beginning with a precursor extracted from the ren ewable needle biomass of 
yew plants. The chemical name for docetaxel is (2R,3S)-N-carbox y-3-phenylisoserine,N-
tert-butyl ester, 13-ester with 5ß-20-epoxy-1,2
 ,4,7ß,10ß,13
-hexahydroxytax-11-en-9-one 4-acetate 2-benzoate, trihydrate. D ocetaxel has the 
following structural formula: 
Docetaxel is a white to almost-white powder with an empirical f ormula of 
C43H53NO14• 3H2O, and a molecular weight of 861.9. It is highly  lipophilic and 
practically insoluble in water. Docetaxel Injection Concentrate  is a clear yellow to 
brownish-yellow viscous solution. Docetaxel is sterile, non-pyr ogenic, and is available in 
single-dose vials containing 20 mg (0.5 mL) or 80 mg (2 mL) doc etaxel (anhydrous). 
Each mL contains 40 mg docetaxel (anhydrous) and 1040 mg polyso rbate 80.
Docetaxel Injection Concentrate requires dilution prior to use.  A sterile, non-pyrogenic, 
single-dose diluent is supplied for that purpose. The diluent f or Docetaxel contains 13% 
ethanol in water for injection, and is supplied in vials.
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent that acts by disrupting th e microtubular network in 
cells that is essential for mitotic and interphase cellular fun ctions. Docetaxel binds to free 
tubulin and promotes the assembly of tubulin into stable microt ubules while 
simultaneously inhibiting their disassembly. This leads to the production of microtubule 
bundles without normal function and to the stabilization of mic rotubules, which results in 
the inhibition of mitosis in cells. Docetaxel's binding to micr otubules does not alter the 
number of protofilaments in the bound microtubules, a feature w hich differs from most 
spindle poisons currently in clinical use.

HUMAN PHARMACOKINETICS
The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel have been evaluated in cancer  patients after 
administration of 20-115 mg/m2 in phase I studies. The area und er the curve (AUC) was 
dose proportional following doses of 70-115 mg/m2 with infusion  times of 1 to 2 hours. 
Docetaxel's pharmacokinetic profile is consistent with a three- compartment 
pharmacokinetic model, with half-lives for the 
 , ß, and 
 phases of 4 min, 36 min, and 
11.1 hr, respectively. The initial rapid decline represents dis tribution to the peripheral 
compartments and the late (terminal) phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of 
docetaxel from the peripheral compartment. Mean values for tota l body clearance and 
steady state volume of distribution were 21 L/h/m2 and 113 L, r espectively. Mean total 
body clearance for Japanese patients dosed at the range of 10-9 0 mg/m2 was similar to 
that of European/American populations dosed at 100 mg/m2, sugge sting no significant 
difference in the elimination of docetaxel in the two populatio ns.
A study of 14C-docetaxel was conducted in three cancer patients . Docetaxel was 
eliminated in both the urine and feces following oxidative meta bolism of the tert-butyl 
ester group, but fecal excretion was the main elimination route . Within 7 days, urinary 
and fecal excretion accounted for approximately 6% and 75% of t he administered 
radioactivity, respectively. About 80% of the radioactivity rec overed in feces is excreted 
during the first 48 hours as 1 major and 3 minor metabolites wi th very small amounts 
(less than 8%) of unchanged drug.
A population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out after Doc etaxel treatment of 535 
patients dosed at 100 mg/m2. Pharmacokinetic parameters estimat ed by this analysis 
were very close to those estimated from phase I studies. The ph armacokinetics of 
docetaxel were not influenced by age or gender and docetaxel to tal body clearance was 
not modified by pretreatment with dexamethasone. In patients wi th clinical chemistry 
data suggestive of mild to moderate liver function impairment ( SGOT and/or SGPT >1.5 
times the upper limit of normal [ULN] concomitant with alkaline  phosphatase >2.5 times 
ULN), total body clearance was lowered by an average of 27%, re sulting in a 38% 
increase in systemic exposure (AUC). This average, however, inc ludes a substantial 
range and there is, at present, no measurement that would allow  recommendation for dose 
adjustment in such patients. Patients with combined abnormaliti es of transaminase and 
alkaline phosphatase should, in general, not be treated with Do cetaxel .
Clearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin wa s similar to that 
previously observed following monotherapy with docetaxel. The p harmacokinetic profile 
of cisplatin in combination therapy with docetaxel was similar to that observed with 
cisplatin alone.
The combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorou racil in 12 patients with 
solid tumors had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each i ndividual drug.
A population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma data from 40 pa tients with 
2008-0378
February 26, 2015
Page 36
hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer indicated that do cetaxel systemic clearance 
in combination with prednisone is similar to that observed foll owing administration of 
docetaxel alone.
A study was conducted in 30 patients with advanced breast cance r to determine the 
potential for drug-drug-interactions between docetaxel (75 mg/m 2), doxorubicin (50 
mg/m2), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) when administered in c ombination. The 
coadministration of docetaxel had no effect on the pharmacokine tics of doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide when the three drugs were given in combination  compared to 
coadministration of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide only. In a ddition, doxorubicin 
and cyclophosphamide had no effect on docetaxel plasma clearanc e when the three drugs 
were given in combination compared to historical data for docet axel monotherapy. 
In vitro  studies showed that docetaxel is about 94% protein bound, main ly to 
 1-acid 
glycoprotein, albumin, and lipoproteins. In three cancer patien ts, the in vitro  binding to 
plasma proteins was found to be approximately 97%. Dexamethason e does not affect the 
protein binding of docetaxel.
In vitro  drug interaction studies revealed that docetaxel is metabolize d by the CYP3A4 
isoenzyme, and its metabolism can be inhibited by CYP3A4 inhibi tors, such as 
ketoconazole, erythromycin, troleandomycin, and nifedipine. Bas ed on in vitro  findings, 
it is likely that CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or substrates may lead to substantial increases in 
docetaxel blood concentrations. No clinical studies have been p erformed to evaluate this.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Docetaxel is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity 
reactions to docetaxel or to other drugs formulated with polyso rbate 80.
Docetaxel should not be used in patients with neutrophil counts  of <1500 cells/mm3.
WARNINGS
Docetaxel should be administered under the supervision of a qua lified physician 
experienced in the use of antineoplastic agents. Appropriate ma nagement of 
complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and tre atment facilities are 
readily available.
Premedication Regimen
All patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids ( see below for prostate 
cancer) such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day ( e.g., 8 mg BID) for 3 days starting 1 day 
prior to Docetaxel to reduce the severity of fluid retention an d hypersensitivity reactions. 
This regimen was evaluated in 92 patients with metastatic breas t cancer previously 
treated with chemotherapy given Docetaxel at a dose of 100 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks.
The pretreatment regimen for hormone-refractory metastatic pros tate cancer is oral 
dexamethasone 8 mg, at 12 hours, 3 hours and 1 hour before the Docetaxel infusion.

Hypersensitivity Reactions
Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reacti ons, especially during the 
first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions c haracterized by generalized 
rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have 
been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticost eroids. Hypersensitivity 
reactions require immediate discontinuation of the Docetaxel in fusion. Patients with a 
history of severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rech allenged with Docetaxel .
Hematologic Effects
Neutropenia (< 2000 neutrophils/mm3) occurs in virtually all pa tients given 60-100 
mg/m2 of Docetaxel and grade 4 neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) oc curs in 85% of 
patients given 100 mg/m2 and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m2. Fr equent monitoring of 
blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjus ted. Docetaxel should not be 
administered to patients with neutrophils < 1500 cells/mm3.
Hepatic Impairment
Docetaxel should generally not be given to patients with biliru bin > upper limit of normal 
(ULN), or to patients with SGOT and/or SGPT >1.5 x ULN concomit ant with alkaline 
phosphatase > 2.5 x ULN. Patients with elevations of bilirubin or abnormalities of 
transaminase concurrent with alkaline phosphatase are at increa sed risk for the 
development of grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, infect ions, severe 
thrombocytopenia, severe stomatitis, severe skin toxicity, and toxic death. Patients with 
isolated elevations of transaminase > 1.5 x ULN also had a high er rate of febrile 
neutropenia grade 4 but did not have an increased incidence of toxic death. Bilirubin, 
SGOT or SGPT, and alkaline phosphatase values should be obtaine d prior to each cycle 
of Docetaxel therapy and reviewed by the treating physician.
Fluid Retention
Severe fluid retention occurred in 6.5% (6/92) of patients desp ite use of a 3-day 
dexamethasone premedication regimen. It was characterized by on e or more of the 
following events: poorly tolerated peripheral edema, generalize d edema, pleural effusion 
requiring urgent drainage, dyspnea at rest, cardiac tamponade, or pronounced abdominal 
distention (due to ascites).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has occurred in patients given 
anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuva nt therapy for breast 
cancer. AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received Docetaxe l , doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorour acil, doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide
Pregnancy
Docetaxel can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant wo men. Studies in both 
rats and rabbits at doses >  0.3 and 0.03 mg/kg/day, respectively (about 1/50 and 1/300 the  
daily maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis), adminis tered during the 
period of organogenesis, have shown that Docetaxel is embryotox ic and fetotoxic 
2008-0378
February 26, 2015
Page 38
(characterized by intrauterine mortality, increased resorption,  reduced fetal weight, and 
fetal ossification delay). The doses indicated above also cause d maternal toxicity.
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant w omen using Docetaxel . 
If Docetaxel is used during pregnancy, or if the patient become s pregnant while receiving 
this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential haza rd to the fetus or potential 
risk for loss of the pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential  should be advised to 
avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with Docetaxel .
PRECAUTIONS
General
Responding patients may not experience an improvement in perfor mance status on 
therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in 
performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been 
established. 
Hematologic Effects
In order to monitor the occurrence of myelotoxicity, it is reco mmended that frequent 
peripheral blood cell counts be performed on all patients recei ving Docetaxel . Patients 
should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Docetaxel unt il neutrophils recover to a 
level > 1500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100,0 00 cells/mm3.
A 25% reduction in the dose of Docetaxel is recommended during subsequent cycles 
following severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) lasting 7 days or  more, febrile 
neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a Docetaxel cycle.
Hypersensitivity Reactions
Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes follo wing initiation of a 
Docetaxel infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or loca lized skin reactions occur, 
interruption of therapy is not required. More severe reactions,  however, require the 
immediate discontinuation of Docetaxel and aggressive therapy. All patients should be 
premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiatio n of the infusion of 
Docetaxel .
Cutaneous
Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by de squamation has been 
observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dos age is recommended. The 
discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for  metastatic breast cancer 
patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-d ay corticosteroids, there 
were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient d iscontinued Docetaxel due 
to skin toxicity.
Fluid Retention
Severe fluid retention has been reported following Docetaxel th erapy. Patients should be 
premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each TAXOTERE a dministration to

reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention. Patients with pre-existing effusions 
should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possibl e exacerbation of the 
effusions.
When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in  the lower extremities and 
may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg.
Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day cortico steroids, moderate fluid 
retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%.  The median cumulative 
dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/ m2. 9.8% (9/92) of 
patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patie nts discontinued with severe 
fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid ret ention. The median 
cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid reten tion was 1021 mg/m2. 
Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversibl e with a median of 16 
weeks from the last infusion of Docetaxel to resolution (range:  0 to 42+ weeks). Patients 
developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measur es, e.g., salt restriction, 
oral diuretic(s).
Neurologic
Severe neurosensory symptoms (paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) w ere observed in 5.5% 
(53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 
6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If sy mptoms persist, 
treatment should be discontinued Patients who experienced neuro toxicity in clinical trials 
and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution o f the event was 
available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of  9 weeks from onset 
(range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mai nly manifested as distal 
extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965).
Asthenia
Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metasta tic breast cancer patients 
but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms  of fatigue and weakness 
may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated w ith deterioration of 
performance status in patients with progressive disease.
Drug Interactions
There have been no formal clinical studies to evaluate the drug  interactions of Docetaxel 
with other medications. In vitro  studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may 
be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that  induce, inhibit, or are 
metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4, such as cyclosporine, terfe nadine, ketoconazole, 
erythromycin, and troleandomycin. Caution should be exercised w ith these drugs when 
treating patients receiving Docetaxel as there is a potential f or a significant interaction.
Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility
No studies have been conducted to assess the carcinogenic poten tial of Docetaxel . 
Docetaxel has been shown to be clastogenic in the in vitro  chromosome aberration test in 
CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo  micronucleus test in the mouse, but it did not induce 
mutagenicity in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation as says. Docetaxel 
2008-0378
February 26, 2015
Page 40
produced no impairment of fertility in rats when administered i n multiple IV doses of up 
to 0.3 mg/kg (about 1/50 the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis), but decreased 
testicular weights were reported. This correlates with findings  of a 10-cycle toxicity 
study (dosing once every 21 days for 6 months) in rats and dogs  in which testicular 
atrophy or degeneration was observed at IV doses of 5 mg/kg in rats and 0.375 mg/kg in 
dogs (about 1/3 and 1/15 the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis, respectively). 
An increased frequency of dosing in rats produced similar effec ts at lower dose levels.
Pregnancy
Pregnancy Category D. 
Nursing Mothers
It is not known whether Docetaxel is excreted in human milk. Be cause many drugs are 
excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for seriou s adverse reactions in 
nursing infants from Docetaxel , mothers should discontinue nur sing prior to taking the 
drug.
Pediatric Use
The safety and effectiveness of Docetaxel in pediatric patients  have not been established.
Geriatric Use
In a study conducted in chemotherapy-naïve patients with NSCLC (TAX326), 148 
patients (36%) in the Docetaxel +cisplatin group were 65 years of age or greater. There 
were 128 patients (32%) in the vinorelbine+cisplatin group 65 y ears of age or greater. In 
the Docetaxel +cisplatin group, patients less than 65 years of age had a median survival 
of 10.3 months (95% CI : 9.1 months, 11.8 months) and patients 65 years or older had a 
median survival of 12.1 months (95% CI : 9.3 months, 14 months) . In patients 65 years 
of age or greater treated with Docetaxel +cisplatin, diarrhea ( 55%), peripheral edema 
(39%) and stomatitis (28%) were observed more frequently than i n the 
vinorelbine+cisplatin group (diarrhea 24%, peripheral edema 20% , stomatitis 20%). 
Patients treated with Docetaxel +cisplatin who were 65 years of  age or greater were more 
likely to experience diarrhea (55%), infections (42%), peripher al edema (39%) and 
stomatitis (28%) compared to patients less than the age of 65 a dministered the same 
treatment (43%, 31%, 31% and 21%, respectively).
When Docetaxel was combined with carboplatin for the treatment of 
chemotherapy-naïve, advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma, pat ients 65 years of age or 
greater (28%) experienced higher frequency of infection compare d to similar patients 
treated with Docetaxel +cisplatin, and a higher frequency of di arrhea, infection and 
peripheral edema than elderly patients treated with vinorelbine +cisplatin.
Of the 333 patients treated with Docetaxel every three weeks pl us prednisone in the 
prostate cancer study (TAX327), 209 patients were 65 years of a ge or greater and 68 
patients were older than 75 years. In patients treated with Doc etaxel every three weeks, 
the following TEAEs occurred at rates >  10% higher in patients 65 years of age or greater 
compared to younger patients: anemia (71% vs. 59%), infection ( 37% vs. 24%), nail 
changes (34% vs. 23%), anorexia (21% vs. 10%), weight loss (15%  vs. 5%) respectively.

In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316), Docetaxel in comb ination with doxorubicin 
and cyclophosphamide was administered to 744 patients of whom 4 8 (6%) were 65 years 
of age or greater. The number of elderly patients who received this regimen was not 
sufficient to determine whether there were differences in safet y and efficacy between 
elderly and younger patients.
Among the 221 patients treated with Docetaxel in combination wi th cisplatin and 
fluorouracil in the gastric cancer study, 54 were 65 years of a ge or older and 2 patients 
were older than 75 years. In this study, the number of patients  who were 65 years of age 
or older was insufficient to determine whether they respond dif ferently from younger 
patients. However, the incidence of serious adverse events was higher in the elderly 
patients compared to younger patients. The incidence of the fol lowing adverse events (all 
grades): lethargy, stomatitis, diarrhea, dizziness, edema, febr ile neutropenia/neutropenic 
infection occurred at rates >  10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older 
compared to younger patients. Elderly patients treated with TCF  should be closely 
monitored.
Of the 174 patients who received the induction treatment with D ocetaxel in combination 
with cisplatin and fluorouracil for SCCHN (TAX323), 18 (10%) pa tients were 65 years 
of age or older.
The clinical study of Docetaxel in combination with cisplatin a nd fluorouracil in patients 
with SCCHN (TAX323) did not include sufficient numbers of patie nts aged 65 and over 
to determine whether they respond differently from younger pati ents. Other reported 
clinical experience with this treatment regimen has in response s between elderly and 
younger patients.
11.5. ETOPOSIDE
DESCRIPTION: Etoposide (VP-16) is a semisynthetic podophyllotox in derivative with 
antineoplastic activity.
PHARMACEUTICAL DATA: VP-16 is supplied as 100 mg/5cc ampules. SOLUTION PREPARATION: The contents of the ampule are diluted wi th 50 volumes 
of NaCl solution for injection, USP.
ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION: Oral or slow IV infusionKNOWN SIDE-EFFECTS: Myelosuppression, primarily granulocytopeni a is the 
dose-limiting toxicity. Other side effects include gastrointest inal toxicity comprising of 
nausea, emesis and mucositis. At high doses reversible hepatoto xicity is seen. Acute side 
effects include occasional bronchospasm and hypotension. These can be avoided by slow 
intravenous administration.
PHARMACOKINETICS: The main site of metabolism is in the liver. Major metabolites 
of etoposide are hydroxy acids and cistactone which appear in t he plasma and urine. The 
2008-0378
February 26, 2015
Page 42
half-life of the drug is 4 to 11 hours. 
MECHANISM OF ACTION: Two different dose dependent responses are  seen. At high 
concentrations (10 ug/ml) lysis of cells entering mitosis is se en. At low concentrations 
(0.3 to 10 ug/ml) cells are inhibited from entering prophase. T he predominant 
macromolecular affect of etoposide appears to be the induction of DNA strand breaks by 
an interaction with DNA topoisomerase II or by the formation of  free radicals.
11.6. IFOSFAMIDE
DESCRIPTION: Ifosfamide is a chemotherapeutic agent chemically related to nitrogen 
mustards and a synthetic analogue of cyclophosphamide.
PHARMACEUTICAL DATA: Ifosfamide is available in vials of 1g or 3g. 
SOLUTION PREPARATION: It is reconstituted with sterile water fo r an approximate 
concentration of 50 mg/ml. Intact vials should be stored at roo m temperature (22 to 25 
degrees Centigrade) or below. Ifosfamide will liquefy at temper atures above 35 degrees 
Centigrade. Intact vials have an expiration date of 5 years fro m the date of manufacture. 
Reconstitution as recommended results in a solution that is che mically stable for 7 days 
when stored at room temperature and for 6 weeks when refrigerat ed (2 to 8 degrees 
Centigrade). Further dilution of the reconstituted solution to concentrations of 16 mg/ml 
and 0.6 mg/ml in compatible infusion solutions results in a 1 t o 5% degradation in 7 days 
at room temperature and no degradation in 6 weeks under refrige ration. In 6 weeks at 
room temperature, decomposition generally ranges from 12 to 18% .
ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION: IV infusionEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS: MyelosuppressionUNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS: Nephrotoxicity and urotoxicity. The incidence of 
urotoxicity can be reduced significantly by the use of Mesna, h ydration and fractionation 
of the dose. Central nervous system toxicity like somnolence, c onfusion, hallucinations 
and coma is also seen and may require cessation of therapy.
PHARMACOKINETICS: Pharmacokinetics of Ifosfamide are dose-depen dent. Single 
doses of 3.8-5 g/m
2 exhibit a biphasic elimination with a half-life of 15 hours; do ses of 
1.6 to 2.4 g/m2/day are eliminated monoexponentially with a ter minal half-life of 
approximately 7 hours. Ifosfamide is extensively metabolized. T he percent of metabolites 
and parent drug renally excreted is dose-dependent. 
11.7. MESNA
Mesna is used to reduce the incidence of ifosfamide-induced hem orrhagic cystitis. Mesna 
disulfide is reduced to the free thiol compound, mesna, which r eacts chemically with the 
urotoxic ifosfamide metabolites, resulting in their detoxificat ion.

Page 43
Pharmacokinetics
Absorption
Urinary bioavailability of oral mesna is 45% to 79%.
Distribution
Protein binding is 69% to 75%; Vd is 0.652 L/kg.
Metabolism
The major metabolite is dimesna.
Elimination
Approximately 32% is excreted in urine within 24 h. The t ½ is 1.2 to 8.3 h (after IV plus 
oral dose); the plasma Cl is 1.23 L/kg/h. The mesna disulfide i s reduced to the free thiol 
compound that reacts chemically with the urotoxic ifosfamide me tabolites, resulting in 
their detoxification. At doses of 2 to 4 g, the terminal elimin ation t ½ is approximately 4 to 
8 h. It is rapidly eliminated by the kidneys.
Indications and Usage
Prevention of ifosfamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.
Unlabeled Uses
Prevention of cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.
Contraindications
Standard considerations.
Dosage and Administration
Adults  
IV Mesna dose is given as bolus injections in a dosage equal to  20% of ifosfamide dose 
at time of administration, 4 h after, and 8 h after each ifosfa mide dose (eg, for ifosfamide 
1,200 mg/m 2 , give mesna 240 mg/m 2 at 0, 4, and 8 h after each ifosfamide dose). The 
total daily dose of mesna is 60% of the ifosfamide dose. Repeat  this dosing schedule on 
each day that ifosfamide is administered. When the dosage of if osfamide is adjusted, 
modify the dose of mesna accordingly.
Adults  
PO Following the initial IV mesna dose (20% of ifosfamide dose) , the oral mesna dose is 
40% of ifosfamide dose 2 and 6 h after each ifosfamide dose.
General Advice
Repeat the oral dose or administer IV bolus dose if patient vom its within 2 h of 
administration. For IV bolus administration only. Not for intradermal, subcutan eous, IM, or intra-arterial 
administration.

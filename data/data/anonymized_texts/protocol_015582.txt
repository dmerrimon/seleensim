  BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION FOR CLINICAL STUDY Approximately 1900 transplants are performed in the US annually. Lung transplantation remains the gold standard treatment for patients with end stage lung disease. This includes patients with range of etiologies such as Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, COPD and Cystic Fibrosis. One of the more common post-operative complications in patients undergoing lung transplantation is the development of atrial fibrillation. Recent studies have demonstrated that approximately 1/3 of patients will develop atrial fibrillation during their post-operative course. While it is uncertain if the development of post-operative atrial fibrillation affects survival, it does significantly increase length of hospital stay. Importantly, a portion of the patients that develop atrial fibrillation post-operatively will require cardioversion prior to discharge.   Currently one of the main stays of treatment for post-operative atrial fibrillation is systemic (oral or intravenous) amiodarone, which is a class III antiarrhythmic agent. While this particular drug is effective, it does carry the risk of several known complications. Due to the drug’s pharmacokinetics, amiodarone concentrates in organs with high lipid content such as the thyroid, liver and lung. Amiodarone has several known adverse effects on the lung ranging from acute respiratory distress syndrome to more chronic disease such as Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Amiodarone can have detrimental effects on the liver which in rare cases could lead to cirrhosis. Additionally, amiodarone can cause thyrotoxicosis as early as a few weeks after the initiation of amiodarone.   The adverse events listed above are related to the cumulative dose of amiodarone. Typically, when amiodarone is initiated, patients receive a loading dose of 600-800mg daily until the cumulative dose reaches 10 grams, after which patients will receive 200mg daily as a maintenance dose. Minimizing the cumulative dose of amiodarone by using a local application, could mitigate the potential adverse drug toxicities. In a previous study, the application of an amiodarone releasing hydrogel performed intraoperatively was shown to significantly decrease the rates of post-operative atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass. Currently for patients undergoing lung transplantation, there is not a safe and effective measure available to prevent post-operative atrial fibrillation.  We aim to study the intraoperative application of an amiodarone containing hydrogel for prevention of post-operative atrial fibrillation in lung transplant patients.  In patients undergoing lung transplantation, post-operative atrial fibrillation is common and leads to prolonged hospital course and increased healthcare expenditures. Amiodarone is a main stay of therapy for atrial fibrillation, however this drug does have potential serious complications when administered systemically. The local application of amiodarone, could potentially decrease the rates of atrial fibrillation, while avoiding the systemic complications.  This has the potential to decrease length of stay and decrease additional procedures (ie. Cardioversion) in patients undergoing lung transplantation.

 RISKS AND BENEFITS OF THE CLINICAL STUDY 3.1 DESCRIPTION OF SUBJECT POPULATION  Male and female patients, age 18 years and older with end stage lung disease requiring lung transplantation and are currently on the lung transplant waiting list are the population for this research. 3.2 ANTICIPATED CLINICAL BENEFITS Lung transplant patients have approximately 30% risk of developing atrial arrhythmias post-operatively. Currently, there is no preventive treatment strategy to reduce this burden. By conducting this study, we anticipate to demonstrate that amiodarone application through a hydrogel during the surgery is a safe and effective treatment strategy for the prevention of atrial arrhythmias. 3.3 ANTICIPATED ADVERSE EVENTS AND ADVERSE DRUG EFFECTS 3.3.1 ANTICIPATED ADVERSE EVENTS AND ADVERSE DRUG EFFECTS SECONDARY TO AMIODARONE HYDROGEL APPLICATION Currently, the only additional risk incurred by participating in the described in this clinical investigation plan is temporary bradycardia (slow heart rate). In a previous study, by Feng et al, in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, a similar intervention using amiodarone gel was assessed and the only complication noted in those patients was bradycardia. This complication was temporary and was not clinically significant. In the above study this was a common complication (greater than 10%), however it was not serious and did not require any additional treatment.  If bradycardia is severe enough to be symptomatic, transvenous pacing may be required, in order to maintain a normal heart rate. The risks from this procedure include but are not limited to: death, femoral hematoma, arrhythmias, fever, cardiac tamponade, deep venous thrombosis, and sepsis.  Animal studies and a previous human study did not demonstrate any evidence that the local application of an amiodarone gel to the heart could result in tissue damage. However, tissue damage has been reported if leaks from the vein occur when using intravenous amiodarone  A one-time dose of amiodarone will be used in the preparation of the amiodarone hydrogel.  While, the dose used in this study is extremely low, there are several known side effects of amiodarone use, which typically occur when amiodarone is administered systemically for an extended period of time. These potential side effects include: nausea, vomiting, photosensitivity, fatigue, dizziness, paraesthesias, constipation, anorexia, visual disturbances, liver damage, pulmonary fibrosis, hypo or hyperthyroidism, insomnia, headache, sleep disturbances, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, SA node dysfunction, abdominal pain, hepatic disorders, flushing, abnormal taste and smell, edema, abnormal salivation and coagulation abnormalities.   3.3.2 ANTICIPATED ADVERSE EVENTS AND ADVERSE DRUG EFFECTS SECONDARY TO LUNG TRANSPLANT There are numerous risk to patients undergoing lung transplantation which include but are not limited to: death, hemorrhage, infection, viral infections, arrhythmias, rejection of transplant lung, bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, hemothorax, empyema, pulmonary embolism, post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, recurrence of primary disease and bronchogenic carcinoma.  3.4 RESIDUAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DRUG UNDER INVESTIGATION, AS IDENTIFIED IN THE RISK ANALYSIS REPORT Due to the short half-life and one time application of the amiodarone gel, no long term residual risk is anticipated.

Subject risk from study participation will be mitigated by ensuring that only experienced personnel will be involved in the care of research subjects. The study staff will undergo product, application and study training prior to initiating study activities, and all subjects will be closely monitored throughout the study duration, at pre-specified time points to assess their clinical status. 3.7 RISK-TO-BENEFIT RATIONALE The potential benefit to patients who undergo the intraoperative application of an amiodarone containing hydrogel at the time of lung transplantation is a reduction in post-operative atrial fibrillation. Currently 1/3 of lung transplant patients develop atrial fibrillation during the post-operative course following lung transplantation. The development of atrial fibrillation significantly increases length of stay and cost of hospitalization for patients following lung transplantation.  In a previous study in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the application of an amiodarone gel significantly reduced the incidence of post-operative atrial fibrillation.  The potential benefit of the reduction of atrial fibrillation outweighs the small risk of a transient episode of bradycardia, which was seen in previous studies.    
 STUDY DESIGN 4.1 PURPOSE The purpose of the study is to evaluate the intraoperative application of an amiodarone containing hydrogel for prevention of post-operative atrial fibrillation in lung transplant patients. 4.2 STUDY DESIGN AND SCOPE This study will prospectively evaluate the use of an amiodarone releasing hydrogel applied to the pulmonary veins and atria at the time of lung transplantation. This study will include patients undergoing lung transplantation at Jewish Hospital, Louisville KY. The prospective group will be compared to historical controls from the same institution. We will access medical records and database entries for those patients undergoing lung transplantation after January 1st 2005 in order to obtain matched controls for analysis.  Informed consent will be obtained from the prospective cohort prior to patient enrollment. This pilot study will be used to obtain preliminary data in order to proceed with a larger randomized, controlled trial.   4.2.1 Intraoperative Application The Amiodarone Hydrogel will be prepared per study protocol (see attached). CoSeal Surgical Sealant (Baxter Healthcare) consists of 2 formulations of synthetic polyethylene glycols, a dilute hydrogen chloride solution along with a sodium phosphate/sodium carbonate solution. These separate solutions are mixed at the time of application to form a hydrogel. Amiodarone hydrochloride powder (1mg/kg) will be mixed with CoSeal at the time of application to form an amiodarone containing hydrogel. The dosing of amiodarone is based on previous study using amiodarone hydrogel in post-operative coronary artery bypass patients. This hydrogel will be delivered utilizing a CO2 driver along the pulmonary vein and arterial anastomoses, and to the surface right and left atria.   4.2.2 Data Collection Data from the prospective cohort will be collected and stored in a HIPAA compliant, encrypted and secured database. A detailed preoperative history will be obtained from the patients including: age, gender, reason for transplant, pre-transplant oxygen requirement, previous myocardial infarction, previous sternotomy, previous arrhythmia, smoking history, diabetes, stroke, hypertension. Intraoperative patient characteristics obtained will include: single lung transplant, double lung transplant, cardiopulmonary use, and ischemic time. Post-operative

 PROCEDURES   A subject is considered to have successfully completed the study upon completion of the 1-year visit    Screening Visit Baseline Data Collection Lung Transplant and hospital follow up Standard of Care Follow up Consent Process X    Data collection from medical records  X X X Confirm Eligibility X X X  Application of Amiodarone gel   X   6.1 PROCEDURES The clinical study will be conducted in accordance with the CIP.  All parties participating in the conduct of the clinical study will be qualified by education, training, or experience to perform their tasks and this training will be documented appropriately.  The clinical study will not commence until approval from the IRB and relevant regulatory authorities are obtained.   6.2 Visit Schedule  6.2.1 Screening  Study personnel will screen all patients listed on the lung transplant waiting list to determine subject eligibility for the study. Potential subjects will be contacted to explain the study and determine if they would be interested in participating. 6.2.2 Consent It potential subjects are interested in participating in the study; they will meet with a study team to discuss the study and sign consent.  No study procedures or data collection will occur before a consent form is signed. 6.2.3 Baseline data collection  Data will be collected from the subject’s medical records including medical/surgical history, physical exam, current medications, laboratory assessments, electrocardiogram results, pulmonary function test, CT scan results.  These tests are conducted as standard of care for subjects undergoing lung transplant. 6.2.4 Prior to lung transplant When a consented subject is informed that they are scheduled for a lung transplant, the study team will review their medical record to confirm they are still eligible to participate in the study.  If they meet any of the exclusion criteria since the initial consent was signed, they will be considered a screen failure and will not undergo the study procedure. 6.2.5 During Lung Transplant Surgery During the lung transplant surgery the amiodarone-containing hydrogel will be delivered utilizing a CO2 driver along the pulmonary vein and arterial anastomoses, and to the surface of the right and left atria.

Standard of care visits include weekly Clinic visits for 1-month post discharge following lung transplantation. Patients will then have monthly regularly scheduled clinic appointments for the first year after transplantation.   In case the subject was already consented to participate in the study, but becomes ineligible by a change in status so that they no longer meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, the following actions will be taken.  • If study procedure/drug implant has not occurred: • Document enrollment information (name of the study, date of consent and inclusion/exclusion) in the hospital records; complete the Enrollment and Withdrawal Forms. The form must be authorized / approved by the principal or delegated investigator. • Inform the subject about the screen failure.  • The EC/IRB and CA should be notified appropriately about any deviations with regards to obtaining the informed consent (if applicable).  6.3 EARLY TERMINATION The study team will attempt to collect all relevant information for the study subjects who withdraw from the study early (including CRF Study Completion Form). The following information will be collected: • Updated medical and surgical history • Assessment of AEs that occurred since the last visit • Abbreviated physical examination (only significant changes since Enrollment) including vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure), and weight • Medication Review  All reasonable efforts will be made to retain subjects in the clinical trial until its completion. Subjects lost to follow-up will be withdrawn only after a minimum of two documented phone calls are made by personnel at the study center to the patient or emergency contact.    6.4 CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES FOR SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL OR DISCONTINUATION Subjects must be informed about their right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without sanction, penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled and withdrawal from the study will not jeopardize their future medical care or relationship with the investigator. Subjects will be asked to specify the reason for the termination, but have the right not to answer.  The investigator may decide to withdraw a subject from the study at any time with reasonable rationale. The subject’s future care will not be influenced by a decision, voluntary or otherwise, to withdraw from the study. All reasonable efforts should be made to retain the subject in the clinical study until completion of the study.  Reasons for subject’s withdrawal include, but are not limited to:  • Subject refuses to continue participating in the study • Subject does not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and does not require additional follow-up for safety reasons. • Subject is deceased (cause must be documented) • Subject’s non-compliance • Subject’s participation is terminated by the PI or investigator, although the subject consented, since participation is no longer medically appropriate • Subject is ‘lost to follow up’: Subject does not adhere to the scheduled follow up visits but has not explicitly requested to be withdrawn from the clinical study. Site personnel should at all times make

A subject will be considered ‘Lost to Follow Up’ after a minimum of 2 phone calls of a physician or delegate at the investigational site to the subject or contact. These 2 phone calls need to be documented in the subject’s hospital records.  Note: If a subject misses one or more of the scheduled follow up visits (inclusive of the assigned visit windows), this will be considered as a missed visit. The subject may therefore still return for subsequent visits and will not be excluded from the study.  If a subject withdraws from the clinical study, the site will record the subject’s reasons for withdrawal (if available), on a Withdrawal CRF.  When subject withdrawal from the clinical study is due to a study related adverse event the subject will be followed until resolution of that adverse event or determination that the subject’s condition is stable. The status of the subject’s condition should be documented at the time of withdrawal.   
 RISK There are numerous risks when undergoing lung transplantation. Subjects will be informed of these risks and sign a separate surgery consent. Currently the only identified potential risk incurred by participating in this study is temporary bradycardia (slow heart rate). In a previous study in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, a similar intervention using amiodarone gel was assessed and the only complication noted in those patients was temporary, not clinically significant bradycardia. In the previous study this was a common complication (greater than 10%), however it was not serious and did not require any additional treatment.  If bradycardia is severe enough to be symptomatic, transvenous pacing may be required, in order to maintain a normal heart rate. The risks from this procedure include but are not limited to: death, femoral hematoma, arrhythmias, fever, cardiac tamponade, deep venous thrombosis, and sepsis.  Animal studies and a previous human study did not demonstrate any evidence that the local application of an amiodarone gel to the heart could result in tissue damage. However, tissue damage has been reported if amiodarone leaks from the vein when using intravenous amiodarone.  A one-time dose of amiodarone will be used in the preparation of the amiodarone hydrogel.  While, the dose used in this study is extremely low, there are several known side effects of amiodarone use, which typically occur when amiodarone is administered systemically for an extended period of time. These potential side effects include: nausea, vomiting, photosensitivity, fatigue, dizziness, paraesthesias, constipation, anorexia, visual disturbances, liver damage, pulmonary fibrosis, hypo or hyperthyroidism, insomnia, headache, sleep disturbances, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, SA node dysfunction, abdominal pain, hepatic disorders, flushing, abnormal taste and smell, edema, abnormal salivation and coagulation abnormalities.   Any serious, related, and unanticipated adverse events will be reported to the IRB within 5 working days of awareness of the event.  All drug related, serious, unanticipated adverse drug reactions will be reported to the company and FDA within 15 working days of the event.  
 COMPLIANCE TO CIP 8.1 STATEMENTS OF COMPLIANCE The study will be performed in accordance with the most current versions of the FDA regulations, and any regional and/or national regulations, as appropriate.  The investigator will not start enrolling subjects or requesting informed consent from any subject prior to obtaining FDA and IRB approval.

The investigator is not allowed to deviate from the CIP, except as specified under emergency circumstances.    In some cases, failure to comply with the CIP may be considered failure to protect the rights, safety and well being of subjects, since the non-compliance exposes subjects to unreasonable risks. For example, failure to adhere to the inclusion/exclusion criteria: these criteria are specifically defined by the investigator/manunfacturer to exclude subjects for whom the drug is not beneficial and the use involves unreasonable risks. This may be considered failure to protect the rights, safety and well being of the enrolled subject. Similarly, failure to perform safety assessments intended to detect adverse events may be considered failure to protect the rights, safety and well being of the enrolled subject. Investigators should seek minimization of such risks by adhering to the CIP.  Simultaneously, in the event that adhering to the CIP might expose the subject to unreasonable risks, the investigator is also required to protect the rights, safety and well being of the subject by intentionally deviating from the requirements of the CIP, so that subjects are not exposed to unreasonable risks.   It is the responsibility of the investigator to provide adequate medical care to a subject enrolled in a study.  Regulations require that the PI maintain accurate, complete, and current records, including documents showing the date of and reason for every deviation from the Clinical Investigational Plan.  Relevant information for each deviation will be documented on a Deviation Case Report Form.   Regulations require Investigators obtain approval from IRB before initiating changes in or deviations from the protocol, except when necessary to protect the life or physical well being of a subject in an emergency.  Under emergency circumstances, deviations from the CIP to protect the rights, safety and well being of human subjects may proceed without prior approval of the IRB. Such deviations shall be documented and reported to the IRB as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days.

There must be evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the medicinal product and the adverse event, i.e. the relationship cannot be ruled out.    • Adverse Event (AE): Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including laboratory findings), symptom or disease that occurs to a subject while enrolled in a clinical investigation.  Medical conditions that exist at study enrollment are not considered an AE unless condition worsens after enrollment.  • Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR): Any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  1. Results in death 2. Is life threatening 3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of current hospitalization related to the use of the study materials 4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 5. Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 6. Requires a medical or surgical intervention to prevent a permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.  • Unanticipated Adverse Event (UAE) / Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction (UADR)/or Other Unexpected Problems: Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) means that:   1. The event and/or reaction was not previously described in the research procedures included in the protocol-related documents, such as the protocol, or consent document, or in other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling or package inserts.   OR   2. The event and/or reaction was not previously described given the characteristics of the participant or the participant population being studied such as natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder or condition of the participant experiencing the adverse event/reaction, and the participants predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse event/reaction.   • Relatedness to study drug or participation in the research.  The investigator will determine the causality of the AE or SAE (definitely not related, probably not related (unlikely), possibly related, probably related, definitely related).  • Problem suggests that the research places subject or others at a greater risk of harm (physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.   • Unanticipated / unexpected problems involving risks to participants or others are defined as meeting all of three of the following criteria:   1. The event is unanticipated because it is not included in the currently approved research study documents, package insert, or study protocol or the event exceeds the described frequency or severity, or it is unexpected that it would occur given the study population described in the research.  AND   2. The event is definitely related, probably related or possibly related to procedures involved in the research.  AND   3. The event suggests that the research places the participants or others at a greater risk of harm than previously thought.

Ancillary testing:  abnormalities of vital signs, laboratory tests, and other diagnostic procedures (other than outcome measures: the results of which are not being captured as AEs).  Assessment of Clinical Adverse Events  The subject’s medical record will be accessed to determine the occurrence of any adverse events. The study team will review the medical records in a timely manner to determine adverse events and enable timely reporting:  1. Type of event 2. Date of onset and resolution (duration) 3. Severity (mild, moderate, severe) 4. Seriousness (does the event meet the above definition for an SAE) 5. Causality, relation to investigational product and disease 6. Action taken regarding investigational product 7. Outcome  Relatedness of Adverse Event to Investigational Product  The relationship of the AE to the investigational product should be specified by the Site, using the following definitions:  1. Definitely Not Related: Concomitant illness, accident or event with no reasonable association with treatment. 2. Unlikely (probably not related): The reaction has little or no temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product, and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists. 3. Possibly Related: The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product and follows a known response pattern to the suspected investigational product; the reaction could have been produced by the investigational product or could have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or by other modes of therapy administered to the subject. (suspected ADR) 4. Probably Related: The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from administration of investigational product; is confirmed by discontinuation of the investigational product or by re-challenge; and cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state. (suspected ADR) 5. Definitely Related: The reaction follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of investigational product; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the investigational product; and that is confirmed by improvement on stopping or reducing the dosage of the investigational product, and reappearance of the reaction on repeated exposure. (suspected ADR) 9.3  PROCEDURE FOR ASSESSING, RECORDING, AND REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS, DRUG DEFICIENCIES/COMPLAINTS, ADVERSE DRUG EFFECTS, SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS, AND SERIOUS ADVERSE DRUG EFFECTS:  Safety surveillance within this study and the safety reporting both performed by the investigator, starts after the subject is enrolled in this study (date of signature of the informed consent) and has undergone the study intervention.  The safety surveillance and the safety reporting will continue until the last investigational visit has

All adverse event data including deaths will be collected throughout the clinical study and will be recorded on a dedicated case report form.   Records relating to the subject’s subsequent medical course will be maintained at the site until the overall outcome has been ascertained and the record retention period for the site has expired. Adverse events related to the study intervention will be monitored until they are adequately resolved.  The status of the subject’s condition will be documented at each visit.    It is the responsibility of the Investigator or Sub-Investigator(s) to perform periodic assessments of all AEs as well as identifying SAEs. The AE and SAE reporting period for this study is from the study intervention through study termination.  Any AEs, ADEs, SAEs and SADEs that occur during the study will be treated by established standards of care that will protect the life and safety of the subjects.   If at the time the Investigator completes an initial SAE form and the SAE has not resolved, the Investigator will complete a follow-up report as soon as the event resolves (or upon receipt of significant information if the event is still ongoing).   All AEs and ADRs will be reported in the subjects’ research record. Any serious, related, and unanticipated adverse events will be reported to the IRB within 5 working days of awareness of the event.  All drug related, serious, unanticipated adverse drug reactions will be reported to the company and FDA within 15 working days of the event.  
 SUBJECT DEATH 10.1.1 Procedure for recording and reporting subject death All subject deaths will be collected throughout the clinical study and will be recorded on a dedicated case report form.  
 DATA MANAGEMENT The investigative team will manage the data. The investigative team will capture the data in the RedCap database provided by the university. RedCap is a secure method of capturing and storing the data.  The Sponsor/Investigator will be responsible for compiling and submitting all required reports to governmental agencies.  The privacy of each subject and confidentiality of his/her information will be preserved in reports and when publishing any data. Confidentiality of data will be observed by all parties involved at all times throughout the clinical study.  All data will be secured against unauthorized access.  11.1 DOCUMENT AND DATA CONTROL 11.1.1 Traceability of documents and data The investigator will ensure accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported on the CRFs and in all required reports.   11.1.2 Recording data Source documents will be created and maintained by the investigational site team throughout the clinical study.

 MONITORING  Monitoring will occur through routine internal data review.  This monitoring is designed to identify missing and inconsistent data, data outliers, and potential protocol deviations that may be indicative of non-compliance.  
 REGULATORY INSPECTIONS An investigator who has authority to grant access will permit authorized governmental agency employees, at reasonable times and in reasonable manner, to enter and inspect any establishment where drugs are held (including any establishment where drugs are used or where records or results are kept).  An investigator, or any person acting on behalf of such a person with respect to the study, will permit authorized governmental agency employees, at reasonable times and in reasonable manner, to inspect and copy all records relating to the study.  An investigator will permit authorized governmental agency employees to inspect and copy records that identify subjects, upon notice that governmental agency has reason to suspect that adequate informed consent was not obtained, or that reports required to be submitted by the investigator have not been submitted or are incomplete, inaccurate, false or misleading.  
 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 14.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN, HYPOTHESES, METHOD AND ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES This clinical study will provide data to support the safety, preliminary efficacy, and performance of the use of the Amiodarone hydrogel in preventing atrial arrhythmia during lung transplantation. The study has a treatment arm and a control arm. The control arm is the historic controls and will use the previously treated lung transplant patients at the facility. The treatment arm will use investigational amiodarone hydrogel. The study sample size calculation is based on typical regulatory criteria for a feasibility study to assess for safety and preliminary effectiveness hence it is not based on a power analysis to show statistically significant difference between the groups. However, the reported rate of early atrial fibrillation post lung transplantation is approximately 30% and assuming that the use of amiodarone gel will result in prevention of atrial fibrillation in 90% patients a sample size of 20 in each arm may have sufficient power to answer the question of preliminary effectiveness and safety.  Endpoint analysis will be on “as-treated” basis as historical control data will be used. Patients who will dropout or withdraw from the study before reaching the primary end-point will be excluded from the study and replaced by new enrollees to have at least 20 patients enrolled the study arm.  The primary end-point analysis will be based on the study groups as per the protocol (treatment group vs. control groups). Subjects, who withdraw consent, will not be included in analyses.   All clinically relevant baseline and follow up variables will be tabulated.  Means, medians, proportions and 95% confidence intervals will be reported. Comparisons of data collected at baseline and at follow-up will be analyzed as follows: categorical variables will be tested using contingency tables analyses (exact or chi-square approximations), and continuous variables will be tested using unpaired Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, depending on variable distribution. The post-transplant AFIB was evaluated between study and control groups for overall occurrence, AFIB lasting < 24 hours and AFIB lasting > 24 hours. All the data were analyzed using SAS 9.4 software (SAS Inc., Cary, NC).

 DOCUMENT RETENTION The investigator will maintain all clinical study documents from prior, during and (as specified) after the clinical study on file at the site for a minimum of 5 years after the termination of this study, or longer as per local laws, or when it is no longer needed, whichever is later.    All original subject files must be stored for the longest possible time permitted by the regulations at the hospital, research institute, or practice in question. All data and documents will be made available on request of the relevant authorities in case of an audit. 
 AMENDMENTS TO CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN Study related documents such as, the package inserts, Report of Prior Investigations (RPI) CIP, CRFs, Informed Consent form and other subject information, or other clinical study documents will be amended as needed throughout the clinical study, and a justification statement will be included with each amended section of a document.   The amendments to the CIP and the subject’s Informed Consent will be notified to, or approved by, the IRB and regulatory authorities, if required. The version number and date of amendments will be documented.  The amendment will identify the changes made, the reason for the changes and whether the implementation of the amendment is mandatory or optional to implement the amendment.  Any amendment affecting the subject requires that the subject be informed of the changes and a new consent be signed and dated by the investigator at the subject’s next follow up.  Changes to, or formal clarifications of, the CIP will be documented in writing and provided to the investigators. This information will be incorporated when an amendment occurs.    
 INVESTIGATION SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION 17.1 PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE WHOLE CLINICAL STUDY The Sponsor/Investigator reserves the right to stop the study at any stage, with appropriate written notice.   Possible reasons for early termination of the study by the investigator may include, but are not limited to:  • The drug/therapy fails to perform as intended • Occurrence of USADE which cannot be prevented in future cases • Request from Regulatory bodies • Concern for subject safety and welfare • Failure to secure subject Informed Consent prior to any investigational activity • Failure to report unanticipated adverse drug effects to IRB • Inability to successfully implement this CIP • Violation of the Declaration of Helsinki 2008 (refer to Appendix C) • Violation of applicable national or local laws and regulations  The study will be terminated according to applicable regulations.  If suspicion of an unacceptable risk to subjects arises during the clinical study or when so instructed by the IRB or regulatory authority, the study may be suspended as appropriate while the risk is assessed.  The Sponsor/Investigator will terminate the clinical study if an unacceptable risk is confirmed.

The transplant surgery may result in an irregular heart rhythm call atrial fibrillation after the operation. This study is being conducted to determine if there may be an a treatment to reduce the chances of the irregular heart rhythm in post surgery. This study is being conducted under the direction of Victor van Berkel, MD, PhD, Matthew Fox, MD and William Whited, MD at the University of Louisville.  About 20 local subjects will be invited to take part in this research.

Template: AMGeL                                                                                                                       Page 28 of 45  Purpose The purpose of this study is to test a new method to decrease rates of atrial fibrillation after lung transplantation. Approximately one-third of patients will develop atrial fibrillation after lung transplantation. Atrial fibrillation is a type of irregular heart rhythm or arrhythmia in which the heart does not pump effectively. This can lead to problems, such as stroke, palpitations (irregular heart beats that you can feel) and prolonged hospital stays. The purpose of this study is to determine if the application of a medication (amiodarone) containing gel to the heart at the time of lung transplant will decrease the rates of atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing lung transplantation.    Procedures   Your participation in this study will last for 1 year.  If you consent to participate you will have the following procedures:  Screening and enrollment You will meet with a member of the study team to discuss the study.  After you have discussed the study and had time to ask any questions, if you agree to be in the study, you will sign this consent form.  This will take approximately 1 hour of your time.  After you have signed the consent form, the study team will collect information from your medical records.  Lung transplant When you are notified that you will be undergoing a lung transplant, the study team will review your medical records to make sure you still qualify to be in the study.  If something has changed and you no longer qualify, you will not receive the gel application during your surgery.    If you still qualify for the study, during your lung transplant surgery you will receive one application of a medication (amiodarone) containing gel. The gel will be applied to your heart during your operation.  After Surgery  The remainder of your hospitalization and follow up care will not be different from standard of care in any additional ways.  The study team will collect information from your medical records.  Follow up visits You will return to the clinic for your standard care visits.  The study team will collect information from your medical records.    Potential Risks  In a previous study in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery , a similar intervention, amiodarone gel was assessed and the only complication noted in those patients was bradycardia (a slow heart beat) . This complication was temporary and was not clinically significant. In the above study this was a common complication (greater than 10%), however it was not serious and did not require any additional treatment.  There may also be other procedures required as part of the study.  If bradycardia is severe enough to be symptomatic, transvenous pacing (a bedside procedure where a temporary pacemaker is placed into the heart through a vein in your neck) may be required, in order to maintain a normal heart rate. The risk from this procedure include but are not limited to: • Death

However, tissue damage is reported if amiodarone leaks from the vein when using intravenous(in the blood vessels) amiodarone.   A one-time dose of amiodarone will be used in the preparation of the amiodarone hydrogel.  While, the dose used in this study is extremely low, there are several known side effects of amiodarone use. These side effects typically occur when amiodarone is administered systemically (either by mouth or in the vein) for an extended period of time. These potential side effects include:   Most Common side effects (occur in up to 33% of subjects) • nausea • vomiting  Common side effects (occur in 4-9% of subjects) • sensitivity to light • tiredness • dizziness • feelings of “pins and needles” (paraesthesias) • constipation • anorexia (loss of the urge to eat) • visual disturbances • liver damage • pulmonary fibrosis (lung damage)  Less Common (occurs in 1-3% of subjects) • hypo or hyperthyroidism (changes in the level of thyroid hormone) • insomnia • headache • sleep disturbances • heart problems (congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, SA node dysfunction) • abdominal pain • liver disorders • flushing • abnormal taste and smell • swelling (edema) • abnormal salivation • blood clotting abnormalities.   In addition, you may suffer harms that we have not seen before.

Poverty
has
been
identified
as
a
powerful
predictor
of
child
maltreatment
and
child
welfare
involvement.
Recent
research
shows
that
even
modest
economic
and
concrete
supports
are
associated
with
reduced
child
maltreatment
and
involvement
with
child
welfare.
Toward
that
end,
the
New
York
State
Office
of
Children
and
Family
Services
(OCFS),
in
partnership
with
the
Office
of
Temporary
Disability
Assistance
(OTDA)
and
the
Center
for
Guaranteed
Income
Research
(CGIR),
University
of
Pennsylvania
is
conducting
a
randomized
controlled
trial
of
unconditional
cash
transfers
among
families
with
prior
child
welfare
referrals
in
three
New
York
counties
in
2023.
B .
T r e a t m e n t
The
project
will
enroll
approximately
150
households
in
Monroe,
Onondaga,
and
Westchester
counties
in
New
York
state
to
receive
$500
per
month,
unconditionally,
via
a
debit
card
over
a
one-year
period,
totaling
$6,000
per
family.
Another
300
will
be
assigned
to
the
control
group
and
will
not
receive
the
unconditional
cash
transfers
but
will
be
eligible
to
participate
in
research
activities.
Families
will
be
eligible
if
they
have
a
recently
closed
case
managed
by
OCFS
through
their
differential
response
system,
called
Family
Assessment
Response
(FAR)
in
New
York
State.
FAR
is
used
for
CPS
reports
that
have
been
accepted
by
the
New
York
State
Central
Register
for
Child
Abuse
and
Maltreatment
(SCR)
where
there
is
no
safety
concern
that
rises
to
the
level
of
immediate
or
impending
danger
for
the
child
and/or
family.
Often,
families
served
in
the
FAR
track
have
been
referred
for
poverty-related
social
needs.

Households
referred
and
determined
eligible
for
Family
Assessment
Response
(FAR)
will
be
invited
to
participate
in
a
randomized
controlled
trial
of
unconditional
cash
transfers.
Approximately
150
individuals
will
be
randomly
assigned
to
the
treatment
group
and
will
receive
monthly
$500
unconditional
cash
transfers
for
one
year.
Another
300
will
be
assigned
to
the
control
group
and
will
not
receive
unconditional
cash
transfers
but
will
be
eligible
to
participate
in
compensated
research
activities.
We
will
randomly
select
50
individuals
per
county
into
the
treatment
arm,
and
100
individuals
per
county
into
the
control
arm.
Youth
Research
Inc.
(YRI),
an
agency
contracted
by
the
New
York
Office
of
Child
and
Family
Services
(OCFS),
will
disburse
treatment
funds
on
a
debit
card.
Longitudinal
repeated
measures
will
be
collected
through
online
surveys
conducted
before
treatment
begins,
at
6
months
after
treatment
begins,
12
months
after
treatment
begins,
and
18
months
(6
months
after
treatment
ends).
Future
maltreatment
reports
and
case
outcomes
handled
by
OCFS
will
be
measured
using
agency
administrative
data.
E l i g i b i l i t y

Data
and
Study
Samples
The
study
sample
will
be
recruited
from
the
population
of
eligible
households
in
Monroe,
Onondaga,
and
Westchester
counties,
New
York.
We
will
randomly
select
50
households
per
county
into
the
treatment
arm,
and
100
households
per
county
into
the
control
arm.
Data
will
be
obtained
from
two
sources:
1)
A
web-based
survey
for
all
study
participants
at
baseline,
at
6
months
after
treatment
begins,
at
12
months
after
treatment
begins,
and
at
18
months
after
treatment
begins
(6
months
after
treatment
ends).
This
survey
will
collect
information
on
caretaker
and
child
demographic,
health,
behavioral,
educational,
and
social
characteristics.
All
variables
will
be
collected
at
baseline.
We
will
repeat
data
collection
for
all
time-varying
variables
at
each
post-baseline
wave
of
the
survey.
2)
OCFS
administrative
records
linked
to
the
study
participants
and
their
children
using
the
DOB
and
name
of
the
study
participant
and
all
minor
children
in
the
participant's
household.
Data
will
be
provided
by
OCFS
as
family-specific
and
child-specific
counts
of
a
series
of
events
related
to
child
maltreatment
reports
and
agency
interventions.
D.2.
Planned
Outcomes
P r i m a r y
O u t c o m e s :
Primary
outcomes
are
measured
as
event
counts
between
baseline
and
18
months
after
the
beginning
of
study
interventions
using
OCFS
administrative
data.
We
will
treat
all
primary
outcome
events
as
integer
count
variables,
with
the
exception
of
preventive
services
which
will
be
treated
as
binary
(services
delivered
/
no
services
delivered).
In
the
event
that
observed
study
outcomes
are
rare
in
the
sample,
we
will
treat
primary
outcomes
as
binary
(occurred
/
did
not
occur)
instead
of
treating
rare
outcomes
as
event
counts.
The
primary
study
outcomes
(and

are:
●

o u t c o m e s :
Secondary
outcomes
are
related
to
child
and
family
health,
well-being,
and
stability.
All
outcomes
are
measured
during
each
wave
of
survey
data
collection
[baseline,
6
months,
12
months,
18
months].
For
all
measures
derived
from
additive
indices,
we
will
treat
measures
as
continuous.
If
the
empirical
distributions
of
additive
indices
are
roughly
symmetric,
we
will
treat
them
as
continuous
real
numbers.
If
the
empirical
distributions
of
additive
indices
are
skewed,
we
will
treat
them
as
non-negative
integers.

E.1.
Evaluation
of
randomization,
balance,
and
attrition
We
will
test
for
balance
between
treatment
and
control
based
upon
observable
baseline
characteristics
for
the
overall
study
population.
Because
differential
attrition
correlated
with
treatment
could
introduce
bias
into
our
results,
we
will
also
evaluate
the
attrition
rate
and
assess
for
balance
between
treatment
and
control
based
upon
both
baseline
characteristics
for
the
final
analytic
sample
(and
attritors)
and
potential
causes
of
attrition.
E.2.
Statistical
specification
Our
primary
analytic
approach
is
an
analysis
based
on
the
intent-to-treat
principle
that
compares
outcomes
for
those
randomized
into
the
treatment
group
to
those
who
were
randomized
into
the
control
group.
Our
models
account
for
time-stable
heterogeneity
across
individuals
and
treatment
sites
using
random
intercepts
for
each
individual
enrolled
in
the
study,
for
each
time
period
during
which
surveys
are
collected,
and
for
the
county
from
which
their
qualifying
OCFS
case
originated.
These
random
effects
adjust
for
correlation
induced
by
repeated
measurements
of
individuals
over
time,
time
period
effects,
and
clustering
of
outcomes
within
counties.
Our
regression
models
for
outcome
variable
y
take
the
following
general
form:

Where
T
indicates
selection
into
the
treatment
group,
X
is
a
matrix
of
demographic
characteristics,
i
indicates
an
individual
participant,
k
indicates
county
of
residence
at
the
time
of
study
enrollment,
j
indicates
survey
time
period,
𝛼
is
a
vector
of
individual-level
intercepts,
𝛿
is
a
vector
of
time
period
intercepts,
𝛾
is
a
vector
of
county-level
intercepts,
𝛽
is
the
time-stable
component
of
the
treatment
effect,
c
is
a
vector
of
time-varying
components
of
the
treatment
effect,
and
𝜃
is
a
vector
of
coefficients
for
demographic
predictors.
The
relationship
between
the
treatment
and
outcomes
of
interest
may
vary
as
a
function
of
time.
We
treat
temporal
relationships
as
potentially
nonlinear,
and
model
the
relationship
between
time,
treatment,
and
outcomes
of
interest
using
a
series
of
time-period
intercepts.
We
estimate
a
unique
intercept
for
each
treatment
period
as
well
as
an
interaction
between
treatment
status
and
treatment
period
to
capture
time-varying
effects
of
treatment.
For
all
continuous
(additive
index)
outcomes
with
a
roughly
symmetric
distribution,
we
treat
the
outcome
as
following
a
linear
model
where
For
all
binary
outcomes,
we
treat
the
outcome
as
following
a
Bernoulli
model
And
for
all
count
outcomes
and
additive
index
outcome
with
a
non-symmetric
distribution,
we
treat
the
outcome
as
following
a
negative
binomial
model
where
𝛹
is
a
shape
parameter.
The
average
treatment
effect
is
identified
as
E.3.
Subgroup
analyses

Families
involved
with
OCFS
have
varying
levels
of
exposure
to
structural
racism.
Because
of
this
we
expect
that
treatment
effects
may
vary
as
a
function
of
participant
race/ethnicity.
We
examine
possible
treatment
heterogeneity
by
modifying
our
general
regression
model
as
follows:
where
d
is
an
interaction
coefficient
for
participant
race
𝓁
on
both
the
time-stable
and
time-varying
components
of
the
treatment
effect.
E.4.
Alternative
specifications
and
sensitivity
analyses
We
evaluate
the
sensitivity
of
all
analyses
to
the
specification
of
informative
priors
derived
from
prior
studies
of
the
impacts
of
guaranteed
income
in
a
Bayesian
framework
by
estimating
all
models
specified
above
using
MCMC.
Prior
parameter
distributions
will
be
specified
within
conservative
bounds
based
on
established
empirical
research.
E.5.
Statistical
significance
and
adjustments
for
multiple
comparisons
Statistical
significance
was
defined
as
two-sided
P<0.05
for
the
primary
outcome.
We
will
use
the
Benjamini-Hochberg
or
similar
procedures
to
calculate
adjusted
p-values
that
account
for
testing
of
multiple
outcomes.

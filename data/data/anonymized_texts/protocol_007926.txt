Rationale/background for changes:
Following review of the Day  85 interim anal ysis and the additional interim anal ysis 
performed on available immunogenicit y data from Phase I  subjects who had completed 
their Visit 10 (Month 14 + 28 day s), the Sponsor made the decision not to pursue the 
clinical development of the investigational supra -seasonal influenza vaccine. Based on 
these interim anal yses results, some assay s will not be performed or developed as 
initially  planned, either because limited or no response is expected to be observed, or 
because the assay  results are no longer relevant in light of the decision not to pursue 
the development of the investigational supra- seasonal influenza vacc inebased on the 
chimeric hemagglutinin technology .
The changes are as follows:
The cell -mediated immune response will not be assessed at Month 14 and later
timepoints . The blood sampling for cell-mediated immunity  atVisit 12 (Month 26)
has been removed.
The hemagglutination inhibition assay  (HI) will not be performed on the
inactivated influenza quadrivalent vaccine H1N1 component , cH11/1N1,
cH6/1N5, H5N8 and H1N1 swine flu strains. For cH5/1N1 and cH8/1N1 the HI
assay  will only  be performed until Visit 6 (Day  85).
The micro -neutralisation (MN) assay  will only  be performed for cH6/1N5 and
H1N1 until Visit 6 (Day  85). MN assay  will not be performed for H5N8.
The anti -group 2 hemagglutinin (HA) stalk response by  ELISA will not be
performed.
The immune respon se in terms of anti -neuraminidase antibodies will not be
assessed.
The passive transfer experiment in mice will not be performed for the Month 14
and Month 26 timepoints. The blood collection at Month 26 for passive transfer
has been removed.
The anti -H9 full length HA ELI SA will not be performed.
Anti
-stalk antibody  functionality  will not be further investigated, except for the
antibody -dependent cell -mediated cy totoxicity until the interim analy sis at Day  85.
Occurrence of RT -PCR- confirmed influenza cases endpoint w as removed
.
In case samples have already  been taken but not t ested y et, they  will be stored for 
future research.
In addition, the list of contributing authors has been updated.

Detailed Title A Phase I/II, randomized, controlled, observer -blind, multi-
center stud y to assess the reactogenicity, safet y and 
immunogenicit y of three GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) 
Biologicals’ investigational supra -seasonal universal influenza 
vaccines (SUIVs) (unadjuvanted or adjuvanted with AS03 or 
AS01) administered as a 1 or 2 -dose priming schedule 
followed b y a booster dose 12 months post- primary 
vaccination in 18 to 39 year-old healthy  subjects.
Indication Active immunization for the prevention of disease caused b y 
influenza virus.
Rationale for the 
study and study 
designRationale for the study
Current seasonal influenza vaccines show good efficacy  when 
they are well -matched with the circulating virus strains. 
However, influenza viruses constantly  change their surface 
glycoproteins that are the targets of most immune responses, 
allowing them to e scape pre -existing immunity , a process 
called antigenic drift. Therefore, seasonal influenza vaccines 
have to be reformulated and re- administered on an annual 
basis. I n addition, novel viruses can appear at irregular 
intervals and cause influenza virus pan demics that can claim 
millions of lives.
Influenza A hemagglutinins ( HAs) are ph ylogenetically  
divided into influenza A group 1 (H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, 
H11, H12, H13, H16, H17 and H18) and influenza A group 2
(H3, H4, H7, H10, H14, and H15) based on sequence 
similarities. Protection from influenza viruses is usually  
correlated with antibodies that bind to the membrane distal 
head domain of the HA molecule, thereb y blocking the virus 
from attaching to host cell receptors. However, the head 
domain has high plasticity  and is the main site of antigenic 
drift.
The membrane proximal stalk domain of the HA is more 
conserved than the head domain and antibodies that target this 
domain have been shown to broadly  neutrali ze influenza 
viruses across several subty pes.The stalk domain is immuno -
subdominant compared to the head domain and is therefore 
usually  not targeted by  the immune sy stem following 
exposure to influenza virus vaccines [Krammer, 2016] .

Protocol Amendm ent 4 Final
11-JUL -2019 9The proposed appro ach of the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) supra -
seasonal universal influenza vaccine (SUIV) is to circumvent 
the immunodominance of the head domain b y sequential 
exposure of the immune sy stem to chimeric HAs (cHAs) that 
pair the globular head region of an exotic (f or example, avian) 
HA with the HA stalk of a currently  circulating seasonal 
influenza virus. The purpose of this approach is to boost pre-
existing cross- reactive memory  responses to the HA stalk 
without further boosting strain -specific responses against th e 
head region of HA. This approach has previousl y provided 
good protection in mice [Goff , 2013a ; Krammer , 2014 a; 
Nachbagauer, 2016] and ferrets [ Krammer , 2014b ].The use 
of adjuvants enhanced the induction of stalk -reactive 
antibodies in mice [Krammer , 2014a ; Goff , 2013b]. Although 
the final formulation of SUIV is planned to be a trivalent 
vaccine containing three inactivated split virion cHA 
components (i.e. one from influenza A group 1 (H1), one 
from influenza A group 2 (H3) and one from influenza B), the 
Company  will first assess monovalent SUI Vs, each containing 
one inactivated split virion cHA antigen from influenza A 
group 1. It is expected that achieving the optimal immune 
response will require improvement of the immunogenic 
properties of the chime ric HAs. This will be assessed in this 
clinical study  by comparing two adjuvanted formulations (i.e. 
a formulation adjuvanted with AS03 and a formulation 
adjuvanted with AS01) with the immunogenicity of a non -
adjuvanted formulation. These adjuvants were ta ken into 
consideration for inclusion in the investigational SUIVs as 
they are the most commonly  used adjuvant sy stems in other 
GSK Biologicals’ vaccines (such as in the pandemic influenza 
vaccine, Pandemrix , which is adjuvanted with AS03 A; and the 
malaria 
vaccine, Mosquirix, which is adjuvanted with AS01 E).
An informative study  performed by  Nachbagauer et al.,
[Nachbagauer , 2014] demonstrated that human sera from 
subjects who had received an inactivated H5N1 vaccine were 
able to protect mice against challen ge with an influenza virus 
expressing an unmatched HA head, but a similar HA stalk. 
This study  supports the concept of a chimeric HA universal 
influenza vaccine based on re -focusing the immune response 
to the conserved stalk domain by sequential exposure t o HAs 
with divergent globular head domains, but conserved stalk 
domains. I t has also been demonstrated in mice that a 
chimeric HA -based vaccination regimen induced higher stalk 
antibody  titers than the seasonal influenza vaccine.

11-JUL -2019 10The stalk antibody  responses were long lasting, cross -reactive 
to distantly  related HAs and provided protection in vivo in a 
serum passive transfer / challenge model, which further 
support the development of a universal influenza virus 
vaccine candidate bu ilt on the chimeric HA technology  
platform [Nachbagauer, 2016].
Rationale for the study design
Approximately  470 subjects 18 -39 years of age will be 
equally  randomized in 10 different treatment groups to receive 
2 or 3 doses of a monovalent influenza A group 1
investigational SUIV or to receive an annual quadrivalent 
inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine. Each SUIV contains a 
split inactivated influenza virus expressing a chimeric HA 
with the same stalk domain (H1 stalk) at each dose, but a 
different ex otic influenza A group 1 head. The antigen dose of 
15 g in each vaccine in this study  is based on the standard 
antigen dose for inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines.
Although it is assumed that a minimum of two priming doses 
followed b y at least one bo oster dose may  be required to 
induce long- term protection, the use of the adjuvant could 
significantl y improve the anti -
stalk immune response and 
induce adequate response with only  one dose, especially in 
adults that have been previously  exposed to the conserved HA 
stalk domain by  natural exposure or vaccination. In a recent 
study  it has been shown that, in an adult population, anti- stalk 
antibodies are present at high titers pre -vaccination and that 
they are boosted after a single dose of Pandemrix (AS03 -
adjuvant edpandemic H1N1) [Tete, 2016]. I n this study , itwas 
also demonstrated that these H1 HA stalk -specific antibodies 
had neutralizing activity  and they  were detected alread y at 
baseline (i.e. prior to vaccination). Vaccination resulted in a 
significant increase in HA stalk- specific neutralizing 
antibodies in the absence of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) 
activity . It was also shown that the avidity  of the anti -H1 stalk 
response was 3 -fold greater relative to the avidity  of the anti -
HA head res ponse to Pandemrix . Knowing that the H1N1pdm 
virus contained a novel HA head domain that was different 
from the pre -pandemic seasonal H1 virus, this paper provides 
rationale for testing, in adults who are likel y to be alread y 
“primed”, a single SUIV dose, 
followed b y a booster dose 14 
months later with a SUIV conta ining a different HA construct.

11-JUL -2019 11Therefore, the vaccine regimen in the SUIV groups will 
consist of sequential primary  intramuscular immunization 
with one dose (Day  1) or 2 doses (Day  1 and Day  57) 
followed b y a booster dose at Month 14 of a vaccine 
containing split inactivated influenza virus expressing a 
chimeric HA with at each dose the same stalk domain (H1 
stalk) but a different exotic head. The SUIV vaccine will be 
adjuvanted with AS03 Aor AS 01Eor non- adjuvanted. The 
interval of two months between the two priming doses was 
selected to ensure optimal priming in a setting where the 
vaccin ecanbe administered the whole year round without 
time pressure for completion of vaccination in contrast w ith a 
seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccination setting. The 
booster dose at Month 14 is anticipated to be necessary  to 
obtain an adequate and persisting anti -stalk antibody  response. 
In the control group, subjects will be administered one dose of 
Fluarix Quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) on 
Day 1 and then re -vaccinated at Month 14 with the next y ear’s 
formulation.
The main purpose of this study  will be to assess the safet y and 
the reactogenicit y of each SUI V compared to IIV4. This study  
will also evaluate the adjuvant effect of AS03 Aand AS01 Eon 
the immune response when compared to the non -adjuvanted 
formulation. I n addition, the immune response after 1 priming 
dose and after 2 priming doses will be evaluated, as well as 
the immune response after a booster dose given 14 or 12 
months after a one dose priming schedule or a 2 -dose priming 
schedule, respectivel y. Since the vaccine sequence of the 
priming dose and the booster dose in the one dose -priming 
schedule groups varies, the effect of the chimeric HA vaccine 
sequence on the humoral immune response will also be 
assessed. Finally , the cell -mediated immune response and the 
protective effect in vivo of the anti -stalk antibodies will be 
explored. P assive surveillance will be put in place in order to 
capture the occurrence of influenza -like illnesse sduring the 
entire study  period. (Amended: 11July 2019)

Adequate contraception: Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive 
method with failure rate of less than 1% per y ear when 
used consistently  and correctl y and when applicable, in 
accordance with the product label for example:
Abstinence from penile -vaginal intercourse, when 
this is their preferred and usual lifesty le,
Combined estrogen and progesterone oral 
contraceptives,
Injectable progestogen,
Implants of etenogestrel or levonorgestrel,
Contraceptive vaginal ring,
Percutaneous contraceptive patches,
Intrauterine device or intrauterine s ystem,
Male partner sterilization prior to the female 
subject’s entry  into the study , and this male is the 
sole partner for that subject,
The information o n the male sterility  can come from 
the site personnel’s review of the subject’s medical 
records; or interview with the subject on her 
medical history .
Male condom combined with a vaginal spermicide 
(foam, gel, film, cream or suppository ),and/or 
progestero ne alone oral contraceptive.
Adequate contraception does not apply  to subjects of 
child bearing potential with same sex partners, or for 
subjects who are and will continue to be abstinent from 
penile -vaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent 
basis, when this is their preferred and usual lifest yle.
Adverse event: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product.
An adverse event (AE) can therefore be an y unfavorable
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product. For marketed medicinal prod ucts, this also

11-JUL -2019 34includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of 
efficacy ), abuse or misuse.
Blinding: A procedure in which one or more parties to the trial are 
kept unaware of the treatment assignment in order to
reduce the risk of biased study outcomes. The level of 
blinding is maintained throughout the conduct of the 
trial, and only  when the data are cleaned to an 
acceptable level of quality will appropriate personnel be 
unblinded or when required in case of a s erious adverse 
event .In an observer -blind study , the subject and the site 
and sponsor personnel involved in the clinical evaluation 
of the subjects are blinded while other study  personnel 
may be aware of the treatment assignment (see Section 
5.3for details on observer -blinded studies).
Eligible: Qualified for enrolment into the study  based upon strict 
adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria.
End of Study (EoS):
(Synony m of End of Trial)For studies with collection of Human Biologicals 
Samples or imaging data, EoS is defined as the date of 
the last testing/reading released of the Human Biological 
Samples or imaging data, related to primary  and 
secondary  endpoints. EoS must be achi eved no later than 
8 months after L ast S ubject Last V isit.
Epoch: An epoch is a set of consecutive timepoints or a single 
timepoint from a single protocol. Epochs are defined to 
support a main purpose which is either to draw 
conclusions on subject participation or to draw a 
complete conclusion to define or precise the ta rgeted 
label of the product. Supporting means that data 
collected at the timepoints included in an epoch must be 
sufficient to fulfil the purpose of the epoch.
Typical examples of epochs are screening, primary  
vaccinations, boosters, yearl y immunogenicity follow -
ups, and surveillance periods for efficacy  or safet y.
eTrack: GSK’s tracking tool for clinical trials.
Evaluable: Meeting all eligibility  criteria, compl ying with the 
procedures defined in the protocol, and, therefore, 
included in the per-protocol analysis (see Sections 6.7.2
and 10.5 for details on criteria for evaluability ).

factors that might increase susceptibility  to the 
infectious agent.
Influenza- like illness 
(ILI) :ILI is defined as at least one of these s ystemic 
symptoms:
Temperature (oral)  37.8°C/98.6°F and/or ,
Myalgia (widespread muscle ache) ;
AND at least one of these respiratory  symptom s:

unapproved indication, or when used to gain further 
information about an approved use.
Mean Geometric 
Increase:Geometric mean of the fold increase in serum HI titers 
post-vaccinati on compared to Day  1.
Medically attended event: An event for which the subject received medical 
attention defined as hospitalization, an emergency room 
visit or a visit to or from medical personnel (medical 
doctor) for an y reason.
Menarche: Menarche is t he onset of menses for the first time in a 
young female and is preceded by  several changes 
associated with pubert y including breast development 
and pubic hair growth. Menarche usuall y occurs within 
1-2 years of breast development, thelarche. However, a 
young female can become pregnant before her first 
menses. Thus, a conservative definition of non-
childbearing potential in a pre- menarcheal female is a 
young female who has not y et entered pubert y as 
evidenced b y lack of breast development (palpable 
glandular breast tissue).
Menopause: Menopause is the age associated with complete 
cessation of menstrual cycles, menses, and implies the 
loss of reproductive potential by  ovarian failure. A 
practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year

1.1. Background
Influenza viruses are enveloped negative -sense RNA viruses with a segmented genome 
belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family . They  are classified on the basis of their core 
proteins into three distinct ty pes, A, B, and C. Influenza A and B viruses are prima rily 
responsible for human disease, with t ype A being the most pathogenic. The main 
antigenic determinants of influenza A and B viruses are two surface gl ycoproteins: 
neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA), both capable of eliciting immune response 
in human beings [ Cox, 1998].
Influenza viruses are a serious public health problem, and cause variable but often high 
rates of seasonal disease in the human populati on, with consequent signif icant morbidity  
and mortality . Uncomplicated influenza disease is characterized by  the abrupt onset of 
constitutional and respiratory  symptoms which usually  resolve within a week. However, 
in vulnerable populations such as the eld erly and children, influenza can aggravate 
existing medical conditions and potentially  lead to l ife-threatening complications. During 
seasonal epidemics, 5 -15% of the population is typically
 infected, resulting in 3 -5 million 
cases of severe illness and a quarter to half a million excess deaths worldwide annuall y.
Most deaths associated with influenza in industrialized countries occur among people age 
65 years or older [ WHO , 2016], although infection is most common in children [ O'Brien , 
2004; Izurieta , 2000].
Annual influenza vaccination is currently the most effective means of controlling 
influenza and preventing its complications and mortality  [WHO , 2016].

1.2. Rationale for the study  and study  design
1.2.1. Rationale for the study
Current seasonal influenza vaccines show good efficacy  when they  are well -matched 
with the circulating virus strains. However, influenza viruses constantly  change their 
surface gly coproteins that are the targets of most immune responses, allowing them to 
escape pre -existing immunity , a process called antigenic drift. Therefore, seasonal 
influenza vaccines have to be reformulated and re- administered on an annual basis. In 
addition, novel viruses can appear at irregular intervals and cause influenza virus 
pandemics that can claim millions of lives.

11-JUL -2019 40Influenza A HAs are ph ylogenetically divided into influenza A group 1 (H1, H2, H5, H6, 
H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, H16, H17 and H18) and influenza A group 2 (H3, H4, H7, H10, 
H14, and H15) based on sequence similarities. Protection from influenza viruses is 
usually  correlated with antibodies that bind to the membrane distal head domain of the 
HA molecule, thereb yblocking the virus from attaching to host cell receptors. However, 
the head domain has high plasticity  and is the main site of antigenic drift.
The membrane proximal stalk domain of the HA is more conserved than the head domain 
and antibodies that target this domain have been shown to broadl y neutralize influenza 
viruses across several subty pes. The stalk domain is immuno -subdominant compared to 
the head domain and is therefore usuall y not targeted b y the immune system following 
exposure to influenza virus vaccines [Krammer , 2016] .
The proposed approach of the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biological’s investigational 
SUIV is to circumvent the immunodominance of t he head domain b y sequential exposure 
of the immune sy stem to chimeric HAs (cHAs) that 
pair the globular head region of an 
exotic (for example, avian) HA with the HA stalk of a currentl y circulating seasonal 
influenza virus. The purpose of this approach is to boost pre -existing cross- reactive 
memory  responses to the HA stalk without further boosting strain- specific responses 
against the head region of HA. This approach has previously  provided good protection in 
mice [ Goff , 2013a ; Krammer , 2014a ; Nachbagauer , 2016] and ferrets [Krammer , 2014 b]. 
The use of adjuvants enhanced the induction of stalk-r eactive antibodies in mice
[Krammer , 2014a ; Goff , 2013 b].Although the final formulation of SUIV is planned to be 
a trivalent vaccine containing three inactivated split virion cHA components (i.e. one 
from influenza A group 1 (H1), one from in fluenza A group 2 (H3) and one from 
influenza B), the Company  will first assess monovalent SUIVs, each containing one 
inactivated split virion cHA antigen from influenza A group 1. It is expected that 
achieving the optimal immune response will require impr ovement of the immunogenic 
properties of the chimeric HAs. This will be assessed in this clinical study  by comparing 
two adjuvanted formulations (i.e. a formulation adjuvanted with AS03 and a formulation 
adjuvanted with AS01) with the immunogenicity of a n on-adjuvanted formulation. These 
adjuvants were taken into consideration for inclusion in the investigational SUI Vs as they  
are the most commonl y used adjuvant s ystems in other GSK Biologicals’ vaccines (such 
as in the pandemic influenza vaccine, Pandemrix , which is adjuvanted with AS03 A; and 
the malaria vaccine, Mosquirix, which is adjuvanted with AS01 E).
An informative study  performed by  Nachbagauer et al., [Nachbag auer, 2014] 
demonstrated that human sera from subjects who had received an inactivated H5N1 
vaccine were able to protect mice against challenge with an influenza virus expressing an 
unmatched HA head, but a similar HA stalk. This study
 supports the concept of a 
chimeric HA universal influenza vaccine based on re-focusing the immune response to 
the conserved stalk domain by  sequential exposure to HAs with divergent globular head 
domains, but conserved stalk domains. I t has also been demonstrated in mice that a 
chimeric HA -based vaccination regimen induced higher stalk antibody  titers than the 
seasonal influenza vaccine. The stalk antibod y responses were long lasting, cross- reactive 
to distantly  related HAs and provided protection in vivo in a serum passive transf er /
challenge model, which further support the development of a universal influenza virus
vaccine candidate built on the chimeric HA technology  platform [ Nachbagauer , 2016].

11-JUL -2019 411.2.2. Rationale for the study  design
Approximately  470 subjects 18 -39 years of age will be equally  randomized in 10 
different treatment groups to receive 2 or 3 doses of a monovalent influenza A group 1 
investigational SUIV or to receive an annual quadrivalent inactivated seasonal influenza 
vaccine. Each SUIV contains a split inactivated influenza virus expressing a chimeric HA 
with the same stalk domain (H1 stalk) at each dose, but a different exotic influenza A 
group 1 head. The antigen dose of 15 g in each vaccine in this study  is based on the 
standard antigen dose for inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines.
Although it is assumed that a minimum of two priming doses followed b y at least one 
booster dose may  be required to induce long -term protection, the use of the adjuvant 
could significantly  improve the anti -stalk immune response and induce adequate response
with only  one dose, especially  in adults that have been previousl y exposed to the 
conserved HA stalk domain by  natural exposure 
or vaccination. In a recent study , it has 
been shown that, in an adult population, anti- stalk antibodies are present at high ti ters 
pre-vaccination and that they  are boosted after a single dose of Pandemrix (AS03 -
adjuvant edpandemic H1N1) [ Tete, 2016]. I n this study , it was also demons trated that 
these H1 HA stalk- specific antibodies had neutralizing activity  and they  were detected 
alread y at baseline (i.e. prior to vaccination). Vaccination resulted in a significant 
increase in HA stalk
-specific neutralizing antibodies in the absence o f hemagglutination 
inhibition (HI ) activity . It was also shown that the avidity  of the anti -H1 stalk response 
was 3 -fold greater relative to the avidity  of the anti -HA head response to Pandemrix . 
Knowing that the H1N1pdm virus contained a novel HA head dom ain that was different 
from the pre -pandemic seasonal H1 virus, this paper provides rationale for testing, in 
adults who are likel y to be alread y “primed”, a single SUIV dose, followed by a booster 
dose 14 months later with a SUIV containing a different HA construct.
Therefore, the vaccine regimen in the SUIV groups will consist of sequential primary  
intramuscular immunization with one dose (Day  1) or 2 doses (Day  1 and Day  57) 
followed b y a booster dose at Month 14 of a vaccine containing split inactivated
influenza virus expressing a chimeric HA with at each dose the same stalk domain (H1 
stalk) but a different exotic head. The SUIV vaccine will be adjuvanted with AS03 Aor 
AS01 Eor non- adjuvanted. The interval of two months between the two priming doses 
was selected to ensure optimal priming in a setting where the vaccin ecanbe administered 
the whole year round without time pressure for completion of vaccination in contrast with 
a seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccination setting. The booster dose at Mont h 14 is 
anticipated to be necessary  to obtain an adequate and persisting anti- stalk antibody  
response. In the control group, subjects will be administered one dose of Fluarix 
Quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) on Day  1 and then re -vaccinated at 
Month 14 with the next y ear’s formulation.

SUIV compared to IIV4. This study  will also evalu ate the adjuvant effect of AS03 Aand 
AS01 Eon the immune response when compared to the non -adjuvanted formulation. I n 
addition, the immune response after 1 priming dose and after 2 priming doses will be 
evaluated, as well as the immune response after a boo ster dose given 14 or 12 months 
after a one dose priming schedule or a 2 -dose priming schedule , respectively . Since the 
vaccine sequence of the priming dose and the booster dose in the one dose -priming 
schedule groups varies, the effect of the chimeric HA vaccine sequence on the humoral
immune response will also be assessed. Finall y, the cell -mediated immune response and 
the protective effect in vivo of the anti -stalk antibodies will be explored. Passive 
surveillance will be put in place in order to capture the occurrence of influenza -like

Influenza vaccines: Fluarix Quadrivalent and SUIVs
Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis reactions have been 
reported in people who had 
influenza vaccination. People 
allergic to any ingredients in Fluarix 
Quadrivalent or SUIV vaccines 
could have an allergic reaction to 
the vaccine. The viruses for the 
vaccine are grown in eggs; 
therefore, people allergic to eggs 
could have an allergic reaction to 
Fluarix Quadrivalent or SUIVs.The investigators are advised of 
possible anaphylaxis following Fluarix 
Quadrivalent or SUIVs administration 
by information included in product 
label or IB.
As with all injectable vaccines, 
appropriate medical treatment and 
supervision should always be rea dily 
available in case of an anaphylactic 
event following the administration of 
the vaccine. Subjects will be closely 
monitored for at least 60 minutes 
(Phase I subjects) or 30 minutes 
(Phase II subjects) after vaccination. 
Subjects with history of any rea ction 
or hypersensitivity likely to be 
exacerbated by any component of the 
vaccine, or anaphylaxis following the 
administration of influenza vaccine(s) 
will be excluded from the study.
Narcolepsy Epidemiological data developed by 
organizations not associated with 
GSK suggest an increased risk of 
narcolepsy following vaccination 
with Pandemri xH1N1 in children 
and adolescents . Due to the 
methodological limitations of the 
studies, which are retrospec tive 
observational studies, further 
research is needed to determine 
whether the observed risk is related 
to the vaccine, environmental 
effects, genetic factors, other 
factor sor a combination of factors. 
Arepanrix, another AS03 -
adjuvanted vaccine produced in 
Quebec, Canada, with a slightly 
different H1N1 viral antigen 
manufacturing process, has not 
been associated with an increased 
risk of narcolepsy comparable to 
Pandemrix [Montplaisir , 2014].Close monitoring of pIMDs in clinical 
development programs using 
adjuvants systems. The potential risk 
of events of possible autoimmune 
etiology to occur (like narcolepsy) is 
mentioned in the ICF.
Subjects with a history or with a 
current auto -immune disease will be 
excluded from this study.

mechanistic studies.
No such risk has been identified in 
clinical trials of AS03 -adjuvanted 
vaccines against other pandemic

11-JUL -2019 45Vaccine -associated enhanced respiratory  disease (VAERD )has been described in 
influenza -naïve pigs vaccinated with inactivated H1 influenza vaccine and subsequently  
challenged with an antigenicall y mismatched H1 virus [Vincent , 2008; Gauger , 2011]. 
Although VAERD is a reproducible observation under well -controlled laboratory  
conditions with pigs, it has never been observed in natural conditions or in other 
laboratory  animal model used to study  influenza viruses (i.e. mice and ferrets). VAERD 
has not been described with GSK Biologicals’ AS03 -adjuvanted H5N1 -pandemic 
vaccination . The latter is a relevant surrogate for the SUIV candidate since it elicits a 
robust immune response to the H1 HA stalk domain without inducing a strong serum 
neutralizing antibody response to A/H1N1pdm09 virus. Although VAERD is not 
considered as a potential safet y risk in the current stu dy, surveillance will be performed 
to capture all influenza like illnesses for the duration of thestudy .
In addition, a ll cases of respiratory  illness, as an y safet y data, will be closely  monitored 
by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The theoretical risk of VAERD 
will be stated in the ICF.
1.3.2. Benefit A ssessment
Benefits considerations for the subjects include:
Contribution to the process of developing a universal influenza vaccine that would 
potentially  provide protection against all influenza A and B strains.
Gaining information about their general health status through the medical 
evaluations/assessments assoc iated with this study  (i.e. phy sical examination, blood 
testing [ hematology  and biochemistry  data ]
).
Subjects may  have the benefit of being protected against seasonal influenza A and B 
if they  are enrolled in the IIV4 group.
Subjects receiving one of the i nvestigational monovalent influenza A group 1 SUIVs 
may potentiall y have the benefit of being protected against influenza A group 1 
viruses (e.g. H1, H5, H9 …) . However , the efficacy  of the investigational SUIVs has 
not y et been assessed.
1.3.3. Overall Benefit:R isk Conclusion
It has been demonstrated in mice that the chimeric HA-based vaccination regimen with 
investigational SUIVs similar as the ones used in this study  induced higher stalk antibody  
titers than the seasonal influenza vaccine. The stalk antibody  responses were long lasting, 
cross -reactive to distantly  related HAs and provided protection in vivo in a serum passive 
transfer challenge mouse model [ Nachbagauer , 2016]. The investigational SUI Vs are 
currentl y in a very  early stage of clinical development and no vaccine efficacy  has been 
demonstrated in humans. Taking into account the measures take n to minimize risk to
subjects participating in this study , the potential risks identified in association with the 
SUIVs are justified by  the potential benefits linked to the development of the SUIV .

5. CONDUCT OF THE STUDY
5.1. Regulatory  and ethical considerations, including the 
informed consent process
The study  will be conducted in accordance with all applic able regulatory  requirements.
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on 
Harmonization ( ICH) Guideline for GCP , all applicable subject privacy  requirements and 
the guiding principles of the Declaration of H elsinki.
GSK will obtain favorable opinion/approval to conduct the study  from the appropriate 
regulatory  agency , in accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements, prior to a site 
initiating the study  in that country .
Conduct of the study  includes, but is not l imited to, the following:
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (I EC) review and 
favorable opinion/approval of study  protocol and any  subsequent amendments.
Subject informed consent.
Investigator reporting requirements as stated in the protocol.
GSK will provide full details of the above procedures to the investigator, either verbally , 
in writing, or both.
Freely  given and written or witnessed informed consent must be obtained from each 
subject , as appropriate, prior to participation in the study .
GSK Biologicals will prepare a model Informed Consent Form (ICF) which will embody  
the ICH GCP and GSK Biologicals required elements. While it is strongly  recommended 
that this model I CF is to be followed as closely  as possible, the informed consent 
requirements given in this document are not intended to pre
-empt an y local regulations 
which require additional information to be disclosed for informed consent to be legall y 
effective. Clinical judgement, local regulations and requirements should guide the final 
structure and content o f the local version of the ICF.

respecting the mandatory requirements of local regulations. The ICF generated b y the 
investigator with the assistance of the sponsor’s representative must be acceptable to 
GSK Biologicals and be approved (along with the protocol, and an y other necessary  
documentation) b y the IRB/IEC.
5.2. Subject identification and randomization
5.2.1. Subject identification
Subje ct identification numbers will be assigned sequentially  to the subjects who have 
consented to participate in the study, according to the range of subject identification 
numbers allocated to each study  center .
5.2.2. Randomization of treatment
5.2.2.1. Randomization of supplies
The randomization of supplies within blocks will be performed at GSK Biologicals, using 
MATerial EXcellence (MATEX), a program developed for use in Statistical Anal ysis 
System (SAS®) (Cary , NC, USA) by  GSK Biologicals. Entire blocks will be shipped to 
the study  centers/warehouse(s).
To allow GSK Biologicals to take advantage of greater rates of recruitment than 
anticipated at individual centers in this multi -center study  and to thus reduce the overall 
study  recruitment period, an over- randomiza tion of supplies will be prepared.
5.2.2.2. Treatment allocation to the subject
The treatment numbers will be allocated b y dose.
5.2.2.2.1. Study group and treatment number allocation
The target will be to enroll 470eligible subjects who will be randomly  assigned to 10
study groups in a (1:1:1:1 :1:1:1:1:1:1 ) ratio ( 47subjects in each group).
Allocation of the subject to a study  group at the investigator site will be performed using 
SBIR. The randomization algorithm will use a minimization procedure accounting for 
center, sex, age (18-
30 years vs. 31- 39 years) and history  of influenza vaccination since 
the 2014/2015 season (y es vs. no). Minimization factors will have equal weight in the 
minimization algorithm.
After obtaining the signed and dated ICF from the subject and ha ving checked the 
eligibility  of the subject, the site staff in charge of the vaccine/product administration will 
access SBIR. Upon providing the subject identification number, the randomization
system will determine the study  group and will provide the tre atment number to be used 
for the first dose .

11-JUL -2019 58The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration screen.
When SBI R is not available, please refer to the SBIR user guide or the SPM for specific 
instructions.
5.2.2.2.2. Treatment number allocation for subsequent doses
For each dose subsequent to the first dose, the study  staff in charge of the vaccine/product
administration will access SBI R, provide the subject identification number, and the 
system will provide a treatment number consistent with the allocated study group.
The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration screen.
5.3. Method of blinding
Data will be collected in an observer -blind manner. By  observer- blind, it is meant that 
during the course of the study , the vaccine s/products recipient and those responsible for 
the evaluation of an y study  endpoint ( e.g. safety , reactogenicity ) will all be unaware of 
which vaccine/product was administered. To do so, vaccine/produc t preparation and 
administration will be done by  authorized medical personnel who will not participate in 
any of the study  clinical evaluation assay s.
The site staff will work in an observer- blind manner during the entire study . As the 
vaccines appearance and preparation are different, two teams of study  personnel will be 
set up:
A team of unblinded personnel (responsible for the reception, preparation and 
administration of the vaccines).
A team of blinded personnel (responsible for the clinical safet y evaluation of the 
subjects).
Please refer to the SPM for more information on vaccine preparation and administration 
while maintaining the blind.
An anal ysis of data collected up to Day  85 and Month 14 + 28 day s will be done on as 
cleaned as possible data u p to Visit 6 and Visit 10, respectively (refer to Section 10.11.1
for more information). At Day 85 anal ysis, the GSK statistician will be unblinded (i.e.
will have access to the individual subject treatment assignment). The remaining GSK 
study  personnel will stay  blinded (i.e. will not have access to the individual subject 
treatment assignment) until study  end. It is possible however, due to the limi ted sample 
size, that unblinding occurs for a few subjects having a specific adverse event ( AE)or 
serious adverse event ( SAE )(e.g. an AE/SAE occurring onl y in a single group). 
Therefore an yone having access to the anal ysis of Day  85 could become unblinde d 
regarding those specific cases.

5.4. General study  aspects
Supplementary  study  conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is 
provided in the accompany ing SPM. The SPM provides the investigator and the site 
personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that do es not impact the 
safet y of the subjects.
5.4.1. Independent data monitoring committee
An IDMC will be established by  GSK Biologicals for the purpose of monitoring the 
study  and to provide independent, non- binding advice on safety  and ethics. The IDMC 
will provide recommendations about stopping, continuing or modify ing the trial. Refer to 
Section 8.8 for a description of the holding rules and safet y monitoring put in place for 
this study .
5.4.2. Influenza -like illness surveillance
ILI is defined as at least one of these s ystemic s ymptoms:
Temperature (oral) 37.8°C/98.6°F and/or,
Myalgia (widespread muscle ache);
AND at least one of these respiratory  symptoms:
Cough and/or,
Sore throat.
All ILIs will be reported as unsolicited AEs or SAEs, as applicable
.
Passive surveillance will be carried out from Visit 1 (after Dose 1) until the end of the 
study  (Visit 12). All study  participants will be instructed to contact the investigator/study  
staff in case they  experience signs s ymptoms of ILI as defined above.
The investigator/study  staff will schedule a visit for the collection o f nasal and throat 
swab specimens preferably  within 24 hours (but not later than 7 day s) after the onset of

5.6.13. Study vaccines/products administration
After completing all prerequisite procedures prior to vaccination, one dose of study  
vaccine s/products will be administered intramuscularly  (IM) in the deltoid of the 
non-dominant arm (refer to Section 6.3for detailed description of the 
vaccines/pr oducts administration procedure). If the investigator or delegate 
determines that the subject’s health on the day  of administration temporarily  
precludes vaccines/products
administration, the visit will be rescheduled within the 
allowed interval for this v isit (refer to Table 7).
The subjects will be observed closel y for at least 
60minutes (Phase I subjects) or 30 
minutes (Phase II subjects) following 
the administration of the vaccines/ products, 
with appropriate medical treatment readily  available in case of anaphy laxis.
5.6.14. Surveillance for influenza -like illness and documentation of signs 
and sy mptoms
Subjects will be instructed to contact the investigator/study  staff as soon as they  
experience ILI signs or sy mptoms from Visit 1 (after Dose 1) until the end of the study  
(Visit 12) (see Section 5.4.2
).The subjects will be requested to come to the study  site to 
collect nasal and throat swabs as soon as possible after the onset of the ILI symptoms 
(preferabl y within 24 hours and not later than 7 day s after the onset of an ILI). In case the 
subject has no possibility  to come , a study  staff member will visit the subject to collect 
nasal and throat swabs. All samples will be obtained, if possible, before 
antimicrobial/influenza antiviral thera py is started. However, if microbial/antiviral 
therap y has started, the swab will be collected and the therap y will be recorded on the ILI 
diary  cards. The most suitable time for collecting the swabs is in the morning before a 
meal. If the sample cannot be collected in the morning, the subject should be instructed 
not to take an y meal at least one hour before sampling.
The ILI date of onset, the ILI signs and s ymptoms and the date of swab specimen 
collection will be collected in the eCRF. In addition, all c ases of ILI have to be recorded 
as unsolicited AE or SAE inthe eCRF.
An ILI not reported to the study  team within 7 day s following the onset of ILI will be 
considered and recorded in the CRF as a miscase. For these miscases, no swabs will be 
collected.

Please refer to the SPM for details on biospecimen management (handling, storage and 
shipment).
Samples will not be labelled with in formation that directly  identifies the subject but will 
be coded with the identification number for the subject (subject number).
Collected samples will be used for protocol mandated research and purposes related 
to the improvement, development and quality assurance of the laboratory  tests 
described in this protocol. This may include the management of the quality  of these 
tests, the maintenance or improvement of these tests, the development of new test 
methods, as well as making sure that new tests are comparable to previous methods 
and work reliably .
It is also possible that future findings may  make it desirable to use the samples 
acquired in this study  for future research, not described in this protocol. Therefore, 
all subjects in countries where this is allowed will be asked to give a specific consent
to allow GSK or a contracted partner to use the samples for future research. Future 
research will be subject to the laws and regulations in the respective countries and 
will only  be performed once an indepen dent Ethics Committee or Review Board has 
approved this research.
Information on further investigations and their rationale can be obtain ed from GSK 
Biologicals.
Any sample testing will be done in line with the consent of the individual subject .
Refer also to the Investigator Agreement , where it is noted that the investigator cannot 
perform an y other biological assay s except those described in th e protocol or its 
amendment(s).
If additional testing is performed, the marker priority  ranking given in Section 5.7.4 may 
be changed.
Collected samples will be stored for a maximum of 20 y ears (counting from when the last 
subject performed the last study  visit), unless local rules, regulations or guidelines require 
different timeframes or different procedures, which will then be in line with the subject 
consent. These extra requirements need to be communicated formall yto and discussed 
and agreed with GSK Biologicals.

When materials are provided by  GSK Biologicals, it is MANDATORY that all clinical 
samples (including serum samples) be collected and stored exclusively  using those 
material s in the appropriate manner. The use of other materials could result in the 
exclu sion of the subject from the per -protocol analy sis (see Section 10.5 for the definition 
ofanalysis sets ).The investigator must ensure that his/her personnel and the 
laboratory (ies) under his/her supervision compl y with this requirement. However, when 
GSK Bio logicals does not provide material for collecting and storing clinical samples, 
appropriate materials from the investigator’s site must be used. Refer to the Module on 
Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM.

The study  vaccines/products must be stored at the respective label storage temperature 
conditions in a safe and locked place. Access to the storage space should be limited to 
authorized study  personnel. The storage conditions will be assessed during pre- study  
activities under the res ponsibility  of the S ponsor study  contact. The storage temperature 
should be continuously  monitored with calibrated (if not validated) temperature 
monitoring device(s) and recorded. Refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the 
SPM for more details on storage of the stud y vaccines/products.
Temperature excursions must be reported in degree Celsius.
Any temperature excursion outside the range of 2.0to +8.0C (for +2 to +8°C/+36 to 
+46°F label storage condition) impacting investigational medicinal products (I MPs) must 
be reported in the appropriate (electronic) temperature excursion decision form ([e]TDF). 
The impacted IMPs must not be used and must be stored in quarantine at label 
temperature conditions until usa ge approval has been obtained from the sponsor.
Refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM for details and instructions on 
the temperature excursion reporting and usage decision process, packaging and 
accountability  of the study vaccine s/products.
6.3. Dosage and administration of stud y vaccines/ products
Dose preparation is to be performed b y an unbli nded member of the site staff. Detailed 
instructions for vaccine preparation will be provided separatel y in the SPM.
For stud y vaccines adjuvanted wi th AS03, preparation of the AS03 A-like adjuvant 
through dilution of AS03 (presented in multi -dose vials) with the accompany ing PBS 
diluent is required prior to mixing with the investigational flu freeze -dried cake for 
reconstitution. After reconstitution , the individual dose of the appropriate study  vaccine 
will be withdrawn into a syringe using aseptic technique. The needles used for vial 
withdrawal are to be disposed of and replaced b y new needles for intramuscular (IM) 
injection.
For stud y vaccines adjuvanted with AS01 , preparation of the AS01 E-like adjuvant 
through dilution of AS01 B(presented in single -dose vials) with the accompany ing PBS 
diluent is required prior to mixing with the investigational flu freeze -dried cake for 
reconstitution. After r econstitution, the individual dose of the appropriate study  vaccine 
will be withdrawn into a syringe using aseptic technique. The needles used for vial 
withdrawal are to be disposed of and replaced b y new needles for IM injection.
For non -adjuvanted study  vaccines, thorough mixing of two components (accompany ing 
PBS diluent and investigational flu freeze- dried cake) is required for reco nstitution. The
individual dose of the appropriate stud y vaccine will be withdrawn into a syringe using 
aseptic technique. The needles used for vial withdrawal are to be disposed of and 
replaced by new needles for IM injection.

vaccinations
At each stud y visit, the investigator or delegate should question the subject about any  
medication s/product s taken and vaccinations received by  the subject.
6.7.1. Recording of concomitant medications/products and 
concomitant vaccination s
The following concomitant medication(s
)/product (s)/vaccine (s)must be recorded in the 
eCRF:
All concomitant medications/products, except vitamins and dietary  supplements, 
administered during the period star ting on the day of administration of the first dose 
of study  vaccines up to study  end (Day  1 to Month 26) .
Any concomitant vaccination administered duringthe period starting 30days before 
the first dose of stud y vaccine s/product sand ending at the last study  visit (Day  -30 to
Month 26).
Prophy lactic medication (i.e. medication administered in the absence of ANY 
symptom and in anticipation of a reaction to the vaccination).
E.g. an anti -pyretic is considered to be prophy lactic when it is given in the abse nce 
of fever and an y other s ymptom, to prevent fever from occurring (fever is defined as 
temperature 38.0°C/100.4°F regardless the location of measurement) . The 
preferred location for measuring temperature in this study  will be the oral cavity .
Any conco mitant medications/products/vaccines listed in Section 6.7.2
.
Any concomitant medication s/product s/vaccine s relevant to a SAE/pIMD to be 
reported as per protocol or administered at an y time during the stud
y period for the 
treatment of a SAE /pIMD. In addition, concomitant medications relevant to SAEs 
and pIMD need to be recorded on the expedited Adverse Event report.
6.7.2. Concomitant medica tions/products/vaccines that may  lead to the 
elimination of a subject from per- protocol analy ses
The use of the following concomitant medications/products/vaccines will not require 
withdrawal of the subject from the study  but may  determine a s ubject’s eval uability  in the 
Per-Protocol anal ysis. See Section 10.5 for the analy sis sets .
Any investigational or non- registered product (drug or vaccin e) other than the study
vaccine s/products used during the stud y period.

The investigator or site staff is/are responsible for the detection, documentation and 
reporting of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE as provided in 
this protocol.
Each subject will be instructed to contact the investigator immediatel y should they  
manifest an y signs or s ymptoms they  perceive as serious.
8.1. Safet y definitions
8.1.1. Definition of an adverse event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporall y 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with 
the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse.
Examples of an AE include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-
existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after study vaccines/products administration 
even though they  may  have been present prior to the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study
vaccines/products or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be 
reported as an AE/SAE).
Signs, sy mptoms temporally  associated with study vaccines/products 
administration.
Significant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action.
Pre-or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol- mandated procedures 
(i.e. invasive procedures, modification of subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).
AEs to be recorded as endpoints (solicited AEs) are described in Section 8.1.3 . All other 
AEs will be recorded as UNSOLI CITED AEs.
Examples of an AE DO NOT include:
Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. endoscop y, appendectom y); the cond ition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE/SAE.

convenience admission to a hospital, admission for routine examination).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or s ymptoms present in a subject prior to the 
firststudy  vaccination. These events will be recorded in the medical history  section 
of the eCRF .
8.1.2. Definition of a serious adverse event 
A SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that:
a.Results in death,
b.Is life -threatening,
Note: The term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetically  might have caused death, had it been more severe.
c.Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization ,
Note: I n general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been admitted at the 
hospital or emergency  ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or in an out -patient setting. Complications 
that occur during hospitalization are also cons idered AEs. If a complication prolongs 
hospitalization or fulfi lls any other serious criteria, the event will also be considered 
serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘ hospitalization ’ occurred or was necessary , the 
AE should be considered serious.
Hospital ization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is 
NOT considered an AE.
d.Results in disability /incapacity , OR
Note: The term disability means a substantia l disruption of a person’s ability  to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea , influenza like illness, and acc idental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) 
which may  interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect in the offspring of a study  subject.

11-JUL -2019 91Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
subject or may  require medical or surgica l intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. 
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic broncho spasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization.
8.1.3. Solicited adverse events
Solicited AEs ( Table 18 and Table 
19) occurring during the 7 -day follow -up period after 
each vaccination (day  of vaccination a nd 6 subsequent day s) will be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the eCRF. The investigator should record in the eCRF an y pain 
relief and/or antipy retics taken by  the subject to correct the AEs (local and/or general) 
during the 7 -day follow -up period a fter vaccination.
8.1.3.1. Solicited local (injection -site) adverse events

eCRF.
8.1.5. Clinical laboratory  parameters and other abnormal assessments 
qualify ing as adverse events or serious adverse events
In absence of diagnosis, abnormal laboratory  findings (e.g. clinical chemistry ,
hematology , urinaly sis) or other abnormal assessments (e.g. physical examination 
findings ) that are judged by  the investigator to be clinically  significant will be recorded as 
AE or SAE if they  meet the definition of an AE or SAE (refer to Sections 8.1.1 and 
8.1.2). The grading of laboratory  parameters will be based on the Food and Drug 
Administration ( FDA )Guidance for Industry  “Toxicity  Grading Scale for Healthy  Adult 
and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials” (refer to 
APPENDIX C).Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal 
assessments tha t are present at baseline and significantly  worsen following the start of the 
study  will also be reported as AEs or SAEs.
In case of clinicall y significant grade 3 and above abnormal laboratory findings that 
cannot be reasonabl y explained (e.g. due to a pr
e-existing or current medical condition), 
the investigator will be recommended to recall the subject in a timely  manner (preferabl y 
within 7 day s after investigator’s awareness/assessment of the abnormal findings) for a 
repeat test to confirm the result.
The investigator will exercise his/ her medical and scientific judgement in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically  
significant.
8.1.6. Adverse events of specific interest
8.1.6.1. Potential immune -mediated diseases
AEs of specific interest for safet y monitoring include pIMDs , a subset of AEs that 
include autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory  and/or neurologic disorders of 
interest which may or may  not have an autoimmune etiology . AEs that need to be 
recorded and reported as pI MDs include those listed in Table 20.
However, the investigator will exercise his/her medical and scientific judgement in 
deciding wheth er other diseases have an autoimmune origin (i.e. pathoph ysiology  
involving sy stemic or organ
-specific pathogenic autoantibodies) and should also be 
recorded as a p IMD.
Once a pIMD is diagnosed (serious or non -serious) in a subject, the investigator (or 
de
signate) must complete, date and sign the electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report.

When there is enough evidence to make any of the above diagnoses, the AE must be 
reported as a pIMD. S ymptoms, signs or conditions which might (or might not) represent 
the above diagnoses, should be recorded and reported as AEs but not as pIMDs until the 
final or definitive diagnosis has been determined, and alternative diagnoses have been 
eliminated or shown to be less likely .
In order to facilitate the documentation of pIMDs in the eCRF , a pIMD standard 
questionnaire and a list of preferred terms (PTs) and PT codes corresponding to the above 
diagnoses will be available to investigators at study  start.

8.2.1. Pregnancy
Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating at the time of vaccination must not receive 
additional doses of study  vaccine s/products but may  continue other study  procedures at 
the discretion of the investigator.
While pregnancy  itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any  adverse pregnancy  outcome 
or complication or elective termination of a pregnancy  for medical reasons will be 
recorded and reported as an AE or a SAE.
Note: The pregnancy  itself should alway s be recorded on the electronic pregnancy  report.
The foll owing should alway s be considered as SAE and will be reported as described in 
Sections 8.4.1 and 8.4.3:
Spontaneous pregnancy  loss, including:
Spontaneous abortion, (spontaneous pregnancy  loss before/at 22 weeks of 
gestation) .
Ectopic and molar pregnancy .
Stillbirth (intrauterine death of fetus after 22 weeks of gestation).
Note: the 22 weeks cut -off in gestational age is based on WHO -ICD 10 noted in the

11-JUL -2019 988.3.2. Post -study adverse events and serious adverse events
A post -study  AE/SAE is defined as any  event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE 
reporting period defined in Table 21. Investigators are not obligated to actively  seek AEs 
or SAEs in former stud y participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE at 
any time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the 
event reasonabl y related to the study vaccine s/product s, the investigator will promptly  
notify  the Study  Contact for Reporting SAEs.
8.3.3. Evaluation of adverse events and serious adverse events
8.3.3.1. Active questioning to detect a dverse events and serious adverse 
events
As a consistent method of collecting AEs, the subject should be asked a non -leading 
question such as:
‘Have you felt different in any way since receiving the vaccine s/product s or since the 
previous visit? ’
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory  and diagnostics reports) relative 
to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an 
AE/SAE in the eCRF. T he investigator is not allowed to send photocopies of the subject’s 
medical records to GSK Biologicals instead of appropriatel y completing the eCRF . 
However, there may  be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are 
request ed by GSK Biologicals. In this instance, all subject identifiers will be blinded on 
the copies of the medical records prior to submission to GSK Biologicals.
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on 
signs, s ymptoms, and/or other clinical information. I n such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms.
8.3.3.2. Assessment of adverse events

11-JUL -2019 100The intensity  should be assigned to one of the following categories:
1 (mild) =An AE which is easil y tolerated by  the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities.
2 (moderate) =An AE which is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with 
normal every day activities.
3 (severe) =An AE which prevents normal, every day activities. I n adults, 
such an AE would, for example, prevent attendance at 
work/school and would necessitate the administration of 
corrective therap y.
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 
3 is a category  used for rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -
defined outcomes as described in Section 8.1.2
.
Note that the grading of laboratory  parameters will be based on the FDA Guidance for 
Industry  “Toxicity  Grading Scale for Health y Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled 
in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials” (refer to Section 8.1.5 and APPENDIX C).
8.3.3.2.2. Assessment of causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y vaccines/products 
and the occurrence of each AE/SAE using clinical judgement. In case of concomitant 
administration of multiple vaccines/products, if possible, the investigator should specify  
if the AE could be causally  related to a specific vaccine/product administered ( i.e.
investigational, control/placebo or co -administered vaccine). When causal relationship to 
a specific vaccine(s)/product(s) cannot be determined the investigator should indicate the 
AE to be related to all products.
Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history of the underl ying diseases, 
concomitant therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
study  vaccines/products will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also 
consult the IB and/or SmPC and/or Prescribing Information for marketed products to 
determine his/her assessment.
There may  be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to includ
e in the initial report to GSK Biologicals. However, it is very  
important that the investigator alway s makes an assessment of causality  for every  event 
prior to submission of the Expedited Adverse Events Report to GSK Biologicals. The 
investigator may  chan ge his/her opinion of causality  in light of follow -up information and 
update the SAE information accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory  reporting requirements.

11-JUL -2019 101All solicited local (injection site) reactions will be considered causall y related to 
vaccination. Causality of all other AEs should be assessed by the investigator using the 
following question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused 
by the study vaccine/produc t?
YES :There is a reasonable possibility  that the study vaccines/products
contributed to the AE. 
NO :There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally  related to the 
administration of the study  vaccines/products . There are other, more likel y 
causes a nd administration of the study  vaccines/products is not suspected to 
have contributed to the AE.
If an event meets the criteria to be determined as ‘serious’ (see Section 8.1.2 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed b y the investigator in order to determine ALL 
possible contributing factors for each SAE.
Possible contributing factors include:
Medical history .
Other medication.
Protocol required procedure.
Other procedure not required by  the protocol.
Lack of efficacy  of the vaccines/product s, if applicable.
Erroneous administration.
Other cause ( specify ).

Not recovered/not resolved.
Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae.
Fatal (SAEs onl y).

For each solicited and unsolicited sy mptom the subject experiences, the subject will be 
asked if he/she received medical attention defined as hospitalization , 
or an otherwise

8.4.7. Regulatory  reporting requirements for serious adverse events
The investigator will promptly  report all SAEs to GSK in accordance with the procedures 
detailed in Section 8.4.1. GSK Biologicals has a legal responsibility  to promptly  notify , 
as appropriate, both the local regulatory  authorit y and other regulatory  agencies about the 
safet y of a pro duct under clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by  the 
investigator to the Stud y Contact for Reporting SAEs is essential so that legal obligations 
and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of other subjects are met.
Investigator safety reports are prepared according to the current GSK policy and are 
forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator safet y report is prepared for a 
SAE(s) that is both attributable to the study vaccines/products and unexpected. The 
purpose of the re port is to fulfil l specific regulatory  and GCP requirements, regarding the 
product under investigation.

All AEs documented at a previous visit/contact and designated as not recovered/not 
resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until 30 
days after the l ast vaccination .
8.5.1.2. Follo w-up after the subject is discharged from the study
The investigator will follow subjects:
With MAEs, 
SAEs, pI MDs (serious or non- serious), or subjects withdrawn from the 
study  as a result of an AE, until the event has resolved, subsided, stabilized , 
disappeared, or until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -
up.
With other non- serious AEs, until the event is otherwise explained or they  are lost to 
follow -
up.
If the investigator receives additional relevant information on a previousl y reported SAE, 
he/she will provide this information to GSK Biologicals using a paper /electronic 
Expedited Adverse Events Report and/or pregnancy  report as applicable.
GSK Biologica ls may  request that the investigator performs or arranges the conduct of 
additional clinical examinations/tests and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully  as possible 
the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obliged to assist. I f a 
subject dies during participation in the study  or during a recognized follow -up period, 
GSK Biologicals will be provided with an y available post -mortem findings, including 
histopathology .

Pregnant subjects will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . At the end 
of the pregnancy , whether full -term or premature, information on the status of the mother 
and child will be forwarded to GSK Biologicals using the electronic pregnancy  report and 
the Expedited Adverse Events Report if applicable. Generall y, the follow -up period 
doesn’t need to be longer than six to eight weeks after the estimated date of delivery .
Regardless of the reporting period for SAEs for this study, if the pregnancy outcome is a 
SAE, it should alway s be re ported as SAE.
8.6. Treatment of adverse events
Treatment of an y AE is at the sole discretion of the investigator and according to current 
good medical practice . Any medication admi nistered for the treatment of a SAE/ pIMD
should be recorded in Expedited Adverse Event Report of the subject’s eCRF (refer to 
Section 6.7).
8.7. Subject card
Study  subjects must be provided with the address and telephone number of the main 
contact for information about the clinical study .
The investigator (or designate) must therefore provide a “subject card” to each subject. In 
an emergency  situation this card serves to inform the responsible attending phy sician that 
the subject is in a clinical study  and that relevant information may  be obtained by  
contacting the investigator.
Subjec ts must be instructed to keep subject cards in their possession at all times during 
the study  duration .
8.8. Holding rules and safety monitoring
Study  holding rules (see Section 8.8.1) and safety  monitoring (see Section 8.8.2
) have 
been defined.
The investigator is not permitted to administer Dose 2 of the study  vaccine to the subj ects 
enrolled in the Phase I until receipt of the favorable outcom e of the IDMC safet y 
evaluation based o n safety  data collected up to 7 dayspost-Dose 1 in at least 60 Phase I  
subjects .
Vaccination in Phase II subjects can onl y start after receipt of the favorable outcom e of 
the IDMC safet y evaluation based on safet y data collected up to 7 days post -Dose 1 in all
Phase I subjects (N = 80) (refer to Enrolment design).
During the entire stud y period, there will be regular IDMC reviews (monthly  during the 
vaccination phases and every  6 months during the safet y follow- up phases).

11-JUL -2019 107Dose 3 (booster) can only  be administered to Phase II subjects upon favorable outcome of 
the 7- day post -Dose 3 safety  data review of Phase I subjects by  the IDMC.
In addition, if an y safety concern is identified b y the investigator (i.e. meeting of holding 
rules 1a -1dsee Table 24or any  other safet y concern), he/she should inform GSK
Biologicals immediately , and vaccination may  be put on hold as a consequence.
If any safet y concern is identified in other stud y(ies)in which the investigational SUI V is 
used, GSK Biologicals might also request to put the vaccination in this study on hold 
during the period needed to perform the assessment of safet
y data of the other study (ies).
8.8.1. Holding rules
Study holding rules which w ill be applied during the safet y evaluation are defined below.
If a holding rule 1a through 1d is observed b y the investigator, it will be reported 
promptly  to GSK within 24 hours. Meeting the other holding rules will be determined by  
IDMC review of safety data at regular intervals.
These holding rules have been written under the assumption that safety  data of all 
subjects will be available. Therefore, the investigator will be requested to record safet y 
data meeting the criteria of holding rules in the eCRF within 24 hours after reception of 
the data to ensure that all necessary  information are available for IDMC reviews. If the 
data from all subjects are not available, the holding rules will be assessed on a pro -rata 
basis.
Upon meeting of an y holding rules , further vaccination will be immediately  put on hold 
pending safet y review and consultation with the GSK Biologicals’ Vaccine Safety 
Monitoring Board (VSMB), as appropriate.
GSK Biologicals’ decision on whether to suspend, modify , or continue the conduct of the 
study  on all groups or on selected groups will be communicated to the investigators, to 
CBER, and to the IRBs/IECs.
In case of a safet y concern, the final responsibility to recommend whether or not the trial 
should be stopped permanently  rests with the sponsor, after having considered all the 
safet y information available. If the trial is stopped, a letter indicating the reasons for 
stopping the study  will be sent to the I RBs/IECs via the investigator(s), and to CBER via 
GSK Biologicals.

Figure 2gives the probability  of not meeting each holding rule 1 and 2 for 45 subjects in 
an investigational group . This evaluation was performed for the sample size of th e initial 
protocol (i.e. 450 subjects, 45/group) and it was not repeated at the time of the protocol 
amendment 1 because of the small difference in the number of subjects per group (now 
470 subjects in total, 47/group).

incidence rate below 1.0% and has less than 5% of chance of not being met for an event 
with a true incidence rate above 7%.

8.8.2. Safety  monitoring
An IDMC will be established by  GSK Biologicals for the purpose of monitoring the 
study  and to provide independent, non -binding advice on safety  and ethics. The IDMC 
will provide recommendations about stopping, holding, continuing or modify ing the trial. 
During the whole stud y period, there will be regular IDMC reviews (monthly  during the 
vaccination phases and every  6 months during the safet y follow -up phases. The frequency  
of these reviews may  be adapted upon IDMC recommendation if deemed necessa ry).
During the Phase I enrolment, subjects will be vaccinated one at a time, at least 60 
minutes apart, with a maximum of 10 subjects per day  until 80 subjects are enrolled (i.e. 
to obtain treatment groups of a t least 8 subjects/group):
If no safety  issue is identified upon review of the 7 dayspost-Dose 1 safety  data 
(Day s 1-7) of at least 60 Phase I subjects, Dose 2 will be administered to Phase I 
subjects .
If no safety  issue is identified upon review of the 7 -day post -Dose 1 safet y data 
(Day s 1-7) of allPhase I subjects (N = 80), Phase II enrolment will start.
Phase I subjects will be vaccinated one at the time, at least 60 minutes apart, with a 
maximum of 10 subjects a day . This is applicable for Dose 1 (Day  1), Dose 2 (Day  57) 
and D ose 3 (booster) (Month 14) of the Phase I subjects.
Phase II subjects will be enrolled and vaccinated without limitation on the number of 
vaccinees per day  or tim e between consecutive subjects.

9. SUBJECT COMPLETION A ND WITHDRA WAL
9.1. Subject completion
A subject who returns for the concluding visit foreseen in the protocol (Visit 12) is
considered to have completed the study .
9.2. Subject w ithdrawal
Withdrawals will not be replaced.
9.2.1. Subject w ithdrawal from the study
From an anal ysis perspective, a ‘withdrawal’ from the study  refers to any  subject who did 
not come back for the concluding visit foreseen in the protocol.
All data collected until the date of withdrawal/last contact of the subject will be used for 
the anal ysis.
A subject is considered a ‘withdrawal’ from the study  when no study  procedure has 
occurred, no follow -up has been performed and no further information has been collected 
for this subject from the date of withdrawal/last contact.
Investigators will make an attempt to contact those subjects who do not return fo r
scheduled visits or follow -up.
Information relative to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator 
will document whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the stud y was made b y 
the subject himself/herself, or b y the investigator , as well as which of the following 
possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal:
Serious adverse event.
Unsolicited non- serious adverse event.
Solicited adverse event
Protocol violation (specify ).
Consent withdrawal, not due to an adverse event*.
Moved from the stud y area.
Lost to follow -
up.
Other (specify ).

Subjects who are withdrawn from the stud y because of SAEs/AEs must be clearl y 
distinguished from subjects who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will 
follow subjects who are withdrawn from the study  as result of a SAE/AE until resolution 
of the e vent (see Section 8.5.1.2).
9.2.2. Subject w ithdrawal from study vaccine s/product s
A ‘withdrawal’ from the study vaccine s/product srefers to an y subject w ho does not 
receive the complete treatment, i.e. when no further planned dose is administered from 
the date of withdrawal. A subject withdrawn from the study vaccine s/product smay not 
necessarily  be withdrawn from the study  as further study  procedures or follow -up may  be 
performed (safet y or immunogenicit y) if planned in the study  protocol.
Information relative to premature discontinuation of the study vaccine s/product s will be 
documented on the Vaccine Administration screen of the eCRF. The investigator w ill 
document whether the decision to discontinue further vaccination/treatment was made b y 
the subject himself/herself , or b y the investigator, as well as which of the following 
possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal:
Serious adverse event.
Unsoli cited n on-serious adverse event.
Solicited adverse event
Not willing to be vaccinated

During the study  conclusion visit, the investigator will ask each subject if they  are 
interested to participate in a long -term study . If a subject is not interested in participating 
in the long -term study , the reason for refusal will be documented in the subject’s eCRF.
9.4. Screening failures
Only  applicable for Phase I subjects : Screening and baseline failures are defined as 
subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study  after giving informed consent, 
but before receiving the study  vaccine at Day  1. Data reported to the eCRF for these 
subjects will be limited to:
ICF information,

10.4. Determination of sample size
10.4.1. Descriptive objectives
The primary  objectives of the study  are to assess the reactogenicit y and safety of each 
vaccine dose throughout the study  and to describe the anti -H1 stalk immune response 28 
days after each priming dose.
At the time of the protocol amendment 1, it was decided to increase the sample size from 
450 to 470 subjects to take into account a la rger rate of non -evaluable subjects than 
anticipated. The power computations from the initial protocol relative to safety  endpoints 
were not modified because of the small sample size increase (about 2 subjects per group, 
from 45 to 47). The immunogenicity  endpoints evaluation will be done primarily  on the 
Per-Protocol set, which is not deemed to increase (about 43 subjects per group).
Table 
25shows the true proportions associated with a 90% probability  to observe an 
event in 45 subjects (e.g. SAE, pI MD).

The advantage of adding an adjuvant and the preference for a specific priming 
sequence/number of priming doses will be assessed by  making use of the factorial nature 
of the trial design, which is summarized in Table 28. The anti -H1 stalk antibody  titers by  
ELISA will primarily  be modelled. The standard deviation (SD) used for the calculation 
cannot be obtained at the present stage due to unavailability  of the final assay  under 
development at Néomed. As a consequence, the assumed SD of log 10titers was derived 
from study  FLU -CC-SUIV -001 (e -track number 201598). In 
thatstudy , anti- H1 HA stalk 
ELISA antibody  titers were obtained using the existing anti-stalk ELISA
[Pica, 2012],
and the observed SD of log 10titers was 0.43 (Day  42). SDs of 0.45 and 0.50 were thus 
considered in the present power calculations.

10.4.2. Confirmatory objective
The most important secondary  objective in the study  is to establish whether an adjuvant 
system is needed
. This evaluation will primarily  be based on levels of anti-
H1 stalk titers 
by ELISA at Day  29 and Day  85 (i.e. 28 day s post -last vaccination). Power calculations 
were conducted for the detection of differences in GMTs between each of the 3 pooled 
groups o f 129 subjects (AS01, AS03, no adjuvant) considering a margin of superiorit y of 
1.5 fold. The 2 -sided significance level (alpha) of each test is 0.0554; it corresponds to a 
critical value from a 2 -sided Dunnett test (accounting for the comparison of AS01 to non 
adjuvanted and AS03 to non- adjuvanted) of 1.922 (2 -sided alpha = 0.10, DF = 384 (129 
subjects/pooled group), 3 pooled groups).
Table 30 provides the power associated with different true GMT ratio values using PASS 
12.0.2 Two-Sample T- Test (Superiority  by a Margin) Power Anal ysis. Again, SDs of 
log 10 (titers) of 0.45 and 0.50 were considered. With a standard deviation of 0.45, the
power reaches 80% if the actual difference is 2.14 fold or greater. Similarly, with a SD of 
0.50, the power reaches 80% if the actual difference is 2.23 fold or greater .SD of log 10(titers) SD of group Means Dete ctable Fold increase

The cut -off value is defined by  the laboratory  before the analy sis and is described in 
Section 5.7.3. A seronegative subject is a subject whose titre is below the cut- off 
value. A seropositive subject is a subject whose titre is greater than or equal t o the 
cut-off value.
The GMTs calculations are performed b y taking the anti -log of the mean of the log 
titre transformations. Antibody  titres below the cut- off of the assay  will be given an 
arbitrary  value of half the cut -off for the purpose of GMT calcula tion.
TheMGI is defined as the geometric mean of the fold increase in serum HI titres
post-vaccination compared to Day  1.
All CI s are 95% CIs. The 95% CI s for GMT are obtained within each group 
separately . The 95% CI for the mean of log -transformed titre is first obtained 
assuming that log -transformed titres are normall y distributed with unknown variance. 
The 95% CI for the GMT 
is then obtained by  exponential -transformation of the 95% 
CI for the mean of log- transformed titre.
Handling of missing data: for a given subject and a given immunogenicity  
measurement, missing or non -evaluable measurements will not be replaced. 
Therefore, anal ysis will exclude subjects with missing or non -evaluable 
measurements.
Reactogenicit y and safety
For the anal ysis of solicited sy mptom, missing or non -
evaluable measurements 
will not be replaced. Therefore the analy sis of the solicited sy mptoms based on 
the ES will include only  subjects/doses with documented safet y data (i.e. 
symptom screen completed). 
For the anal ysis of unsolicited AEs/MAEs/ ILIs/ SAEs/concomitant medication,
all vaccinated subjects will be considered and subjects who did not report an 
event wi ll be considered as subjects without an event.
10.7. Analysis of demographics
Demographic characteristics (center, age at study  vaccination in y ears, gender, ethnicit y, 
geographic ancestry , history  of influenza vaccination since the 2014/2015 season) and

The anti H1 HA stalk ELISA titers will be modelled us ing an ANCOVA model. Twent y-
eight day s post priming/post booster log 10 (titers) will be modelled as a function of the 
adjuvant (AS01, AS03, no adjuvant) and of the priming sequence (cH8/1N1, cH5/1N1, 
cH8/1N1 and cH5/1N1), including the pre
-vaccination titer as covariate. The primary 
analysis will not include any  interaction term.
For the parameter related to the priming sequence, in absence of a reference group, the 
overall test of difference (to reject the null h ypothesis of no difference) will be done at 
significance level 0.10. If the test is statistically  significant at level 0.10, the different 
pairwise comparisons will be performed at the same alpha level.

11-JUL -2019 12310.10. Interpretation of analy ses
Comparative anal yses will be descriptive with the aim to characterise the difference in 
reactogenicity /immunogenicity  between groups.
With respect to the secondary  objective and decision rule linked to the use of an adjuvant, 
the interpretation will be done according to the CI for the GMT ratios (pooled AS01 vs 
pooled non- adjuvanted and pooled AS03 vs pooled non-adjuvanted). The use of the 
adjuvant (AS01 or AS03) will be considered justified if the lower limit of the 94.46% CI 
of the GMT ratio (adjuvanted vs non- adjuvanted ) is > 1.50.
10.11. Conduct of analy ses
Any deviation(s) or change(s) from the original statistical plan outlined in this protocol 
will be described and justified in the final Study  Report .
10.11.1. Sequence of analy ses
All interim analy ses will be conducted on data as clean as possible. The final anal ysis 
will be performed on fully clean data.
Excluding the IDMC monitoring anal yses, the analy ses will be performed in a stepwise 
manner:
Interim anal yses will be performed when safet y, reactogenicity and immunogenicity 
(including at least H1 anti- stalk ELISA ) data from all subjects are available up to 
Day 85 and up to Month 14 + 28 day s*. 
The GSK statistician/statistical analy st will 
be unblinded for these analy ses (i.e. will have access to the individual subject 
treatment assignment). The remaining GSK stud ypersonnel will remain blinded (see 
Section 5.3).
*Note that for this timepoint, an additional interim analy sis will be performed on all 
available immunogenicity data when Phase I subjects eligible for booster vaccination 
have completed their Visit 10 according to the allowed interval.
A final analysis of all data will be performed when all data up to study  conclusion 
are available. This analy sis wil
l be reported in an integrated Study  Report and made 
available to the investigators.
If the data for tertiary  endpoints beco me available at a later stage, (an) additional 
analysis/anal yses will be performed. These data will be documented in annex(es) to the 
Study  Report and will be made available to the investigators at that time.
10.11.2. Statistical considerations for interim analyses
No statistical adjustment will be made for the interim analy ses, which are intended to 
provide final outputs related to the different endpoints and timepoints in a phased

To comply  with ICH GCP administrative obligations relating to data collection, 
monitoring, archiving data, audits, confidentiality, public disclosure requirements and 
publications must be fulfilled. 
11.1. electronic Case Report Form instructions
A validated GSK defined electronic data collection tool will be used as the method for 
data collection.
In all cases, subject initials will not be collected nor transmitted to GSK. Subject data 
necessary  for anal ysis and reporting will be entered/transmitted into a validated database 
or data s ystem. Clinical data management will be performed in acc ordance with 
applicable GSK standards and data cleaning procedures.
While completed eCRFs are reviewed b y a GSK Biologicals’ Site Monitor at the study 
site, omissions or inconsistencies detected b y subsequent eCRF review may necessitate 
clarification or co rrection by  the investigator or appropriatel y qualified designee. In all 
cases, the investigator remains accountable for the study  data. 
The investigator will be provided with a CD-ROM of the final version of the data 
generated at the investigational site once the database is archived and the study  report is 
complete and approved by all parties.
11.2. Stud y Monitoring by  GSK Biologicals
GSK will monitor the stud y to verify  that, amongst other items, the:
Data are authentic, accurate, and complete.
Safety  and rights of subjects are being protected.
Study  is conducted in accordance with the currently  approved protocol, any other 
study  agreements, GCP and all applicable regulatory  requirements. 
The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where appl icable) agrees to 
allow the monitor direct access to all relevant documents.
The investigator must ensure provision of reasonable time, space and qualified personnel 
for monitoring visits.
Direct access to all stud y-site related and source data is mandator y for the purpose of 
monitoring review. The monitor will perform a eCRF review and a Source Document 
Verification (SDV). By  SDV we understand verifying eCRF entries b y comparing them 
with the source data that will be made available by the investigator for this purpose.

investigator and should be filed in the investigator’s study  file. An y data item for which 
the eCRF will serve as the source must be identified, agreed and documented in the 
source docum entation agreement form.
Upon completion or premature discontinuation of the study , the monitor will conduct site 
closure activities with the investigator or site staff, as appropriate, in accordance with 
applicable regulations, GCP, and GSK procedures.
11.3. Record retention
Following closure of the study , the investigator must maintain all site study  records 
(except for those required by  local regu lations to be maintained elsewhere) in a safe and 
secure location. The records must be easily  accessible, when needed (e.g. audit or 
inspection), and must be available for review in conjunction with assessment of the 
facility , supporting s ystems, and staff . Where permitted by  applicable laws/regulations or 
institutional policy , some or all of these records can be maintained in a validated format 
other than hard copy (e.g. microfiche, scanned, electronic); however, caution needs to be 
exercised before such a ction is taken. The investigator must ensure that all reproductions 
are legible and are a true and accurate cop y of the original and meet accessibility  and 
retrieval standards, including re -generating a hard copy, if required. Furthermore, the 
investigator must ensure that an acceptable back- up of the reproductions exists and that 
there is an acceptable quality  control procedure in place for making these reproductions.
GSK will inform the investigator/institution of the time period for retaining these recor ds 
to comply  with all applicable regulatory  requirements. The minimum retention time will 
meet the strictest standard applicable to a particular site, as dictated b y ICH GCP, any  
institutional requirements, applicable laws or regulations, or GSK standards/ procedures , 
otherwise, the minimum retention period will default to 25 y ears after completion of the 
study  report.
The investigator/institution must notify  GSK of any  changes in the archival 
arrangements, including, but not limited to archival at an off -site facility , transfer of 
ownership of the records in the event the investigator leaves the site.
11.4. Qualit y assurance
To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory  requirements, GSK may  
conduct a qualit y assurance audit. Regulatory agencies may  also conduct a regulatory  
inspection of this study . Such audits/inspections can occur at any  time during or after 
completion of the study. If an audit or inspection occurs, the investigator and institution 
agree to allow the auditor/inspector direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate 
his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and 
any relevant issues.

Anti -stalk ELISA protocol:
The prevalence of anti- stalk antibodies will be measured by  ELISA using reagents based 
on HA -group specific chimeric HAs. The chimeric HA consists of anexotic head domain 
on top of a vaccine -antigen stalk domain. For example, the cH6/1 antigen has been 
constructed to measure anti -stalk antibodies against H1. Since humans are naïve to the
H6 head domain, reactivity  measured with this substrate indicates reactivit y to the H1 
stalk. Chimeric antigens will be developed for the twoHA groups (group A 1andgroup 
A2)
and will be used in a classical ELISA. Briefly, the antigen is coated on 96 well 
plates. After blocking, the serum is added and sequentially  diluted. After incubation and 
washing steps, a detection antibody  is used to distinguish serum antibodies attached to the 
antigen and optical density  measurement provides quantitative information about the 
amount of antibodies in the serum. Positive and negative controls are developed in 
addition of an antigen -specific standard.
The brea dth of the immune response within the group 1 HA subty peswill be measured
using a full length HA ELISA.
Microneutralization (MN) a
ssay protocol:
The functionalit y of the stalk- reactive antibodies is evaluated b y MN assays developed 
using chimeric viruses. As done for the ELISA, the objective is to avoid interference 
caused by antibodies directed against HA head but also caused b y antibodies directed 
against NA ; for that purpose we use viruses expressing an HA with an HA group -specific 
stalk and an HA head d omain and NA to which humans are naïve . Briefl y, measurements 
are conducted on thawed frozen serum samples. Samples are heat inactivated for 30 min 
at 56°C. A standardized amount of virus is mixed with serial dilutions of serum and 
incubated to allow binding of the antibodies to the virus. A cell suspension, containing a 
defined amount of Madin -Darb y Canine Kidney  (MDCK) cells is then added to the 
mixture of virus and antiserum and incubated at 35°C ( 2°C) . After the incubation 
period, virus replication is visualized ( by hemagglutination of red blood cells or OD 
reading )and a neutralization titer is calculated between the highest serum dilution able to 
totally  neutralize the virus and one of the next serum dilution where viruses remain 
detectable. Each serum sample is tested once.
Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay protocol:
HI antibody  titers are determined using the method derived from the WHO Manual on 
Animal I nfluenza Diagnosis and Surveillance, WHO/CDS/CSR/ NCS/2002.5.
Measurements are conducted on thawed frozen serum samples with a standardized and 
comprehensivel y validated micro -method using 2 hemagglutinating units (2 HAU) of the 
appropriate antigens and a 0.45% fowl ery throcy te suspension. Non -specific se rum 
inhibitors are removed by heat treatment and receptor- destro ying enzy mes.

11-JUL -2019 130Starting with an initial dilution of 1:10, a dilution series (b y a factor of 2) is prepared up 
to an end dilution of 1:10240. The titration end- point is taken as the highest dilution step 
that shows complete inhibition of hemagglutination. All assay s are performed in 
duplicate. The usual cut- off value is 10 1/DIL.
ELISPOT (memory B cell detection assay) :
The B -cell ELISPOT allows the quantification of antigen -specific memory  B-cells. These 
cells are responsible of long term (humoral) memory  and will be the cells recalled during 
an infection subsequent to vaccination. This assay is designed to evaluate the frequency  
(per million memory  B-cells) of HA stalk specific memory  B-cells fr om peripheral blood 
samples.
The protocol is adapted from the assay  developed by  [Crotty , 2004] , and involves the 
incubation of PBMC that have been differentiated into antibody  secreting cells in nitro-
plates coated with either the antigen of interest (for the detection of antigen -specific 
memory  B-cells) or anti
-human Ig (for the detection of total memory  B-cells). A 
conventional immuno- enzy matic procedure [ Crotty , 2004] is applied to detect 
antibody /antigen spots enumerating memory  B-cells and the results are expressed as the 
frequencies of antigen -specific memory  B-cells within the total memory  B-cell 
population.
Flow Cytometry B -
cells (FCB) for plasmablasts detection
The FCB assay  has been developed to allow detection of HA stalk specific plasmablasts. 
Upon vaccination or natural challenge, these differentiated B- cells are transiently  present 
in the periphery  (peak at Day  7 post -antigen encounter) and are the cells producing the 
antibodies. The FCB assay has been set up to detect the cells producing the anti -HA stalk 
antibodies that the SUIV is designed to induce .
The P BMC are thawed and immuno-stained for surface markers allowing phenoty pic 
identification of the plasmablasts (CD14- / IgD-/ CD20 -/ CD19+ / CD38+). Cells are 
then permeabilized and immune -stained with a specific biotiny lated probe (here the 
chimeric HA pr otein cH6/1) which will bind to the cognate antibodies (here the anti -HA 
stalk antibodies) within the plasmablasts . The probe is then detected with a fluorescentl y 
labelled streptavidin, and anal ysis performed by  multi- parametric flow cy tometry . Results 
are expressed as frequencies of antigen specific plasmablasts per million PBMC.
T-cell detection by I ntracellular Cy tokine Staining (ICS) assay:
This assay  is applied to measure the frequency  of antigen -specific T- lymphocy tes in 
peripheral blood. CD4+ T -lymphocy tes are critical helper cells supporting the 
differentiation of antibody secreting cells (B -cells). CD8+ T -lymphocy tes are direct 
effector cells able to kill virus -infected cells.

onto a Lymphoprep cushion within 24 hours following collection. PBMC suspensions are 
stored in liquid nitrogen until analy sis. To measure T- cell responses elicited by  the 
vaccine candidate, samples are thawed and stimulated with relevant antigen (sy nthetic 
peptides covering the HA stalk domain). Re -stimulated cells are then immunostained for 
surface markers such as CD3, CD4 and CD8 followed b y cell permeabilization and 
immunostaining for effector molecules (cy tokines/activation marker) such as IL -2, IFN -γ, 
TNF -α and CD40L (additional effector molecules could also be explored). Analy sis is 
performed b y mult iparametric flow cy tometry , and the results are expressed as 
frequencies of CD4+ (or CD8+) T -cells producing various combinations of the 
cytokine/activation markers assessed per million CD4+ (or CD8+) T -cells.
RT-qPCR assay for influenza d etection:
Viral R NAs extracted from the clinical sample are amplified and detected using Flu -A 
and Flu -B specific primers and probes (designed in the Matrix gene). Viral Load values 
are quantified and the sample is considered positive when the measured Viral Load is 
equal to or above the assay  cut-off. Several controls are included throughout the process, 
both at the extraction and RT- PCR steps to monitor the extraction and RT -PCR 
efficiencies and an y potential contamination that may occur during each run.
RT-PCR assay for influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 typing:
A RT -PCR allowing the identification of Flu -A/H1N1 and Flu- A/H3N2 is performed on 
the nucleic acids generated for Flu-A and Flu- B detection. Specific primers designed in 
the HA gene of Flu- A/H1N1 and Flu- A/H3N2 are used 
to perform the discrimination. I n 
addition, Flu -A/H1N1 and Flu- A/H3N2 RT -PCR positive controls corresponding to the 
RNA from reference strains are evaluated in parallel with the samples. No template 
controls are also used to monitor any  potential contamina tion during each RT -PCR run.
RT-qPCR assay for RSV detection:
Viral RNAs extracted from the clinical sample are amplified and detected using RSV -A 
and RSV -B specific primers and probes designed in the N gene encoding the 
nucleocapsid protein. Viral load values are quantified and the sample is considered 
positive when the measured viral load is equal to or above the assay  cut-off. Several 
controls are included throughout the process, both at the extraction and RT- PCR steps to 
monitor the extraction and RT -PCR efficiencies and any potential contamination that may

GRA DING SCA LE FOR HEA LTHY ADULT AND 
ADOLESCENT VOLUNTEERS ENROLLED IN 
PREVENTIVE VA CCINE CLINICA L TRIA LS 
(SEPTEMBER 2007)
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’ s) current thinking 
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not 
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach 
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and re gulations. If you want to 
discuss an alternative approach, contact the appropriate FDA staff. If you cannot identify 
the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this 
guidance.
i.INTRODUCTION
Preventive vaccines are usua lly developed to prevent disease in a healthy  population. The 
Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Centre for Biologics Evaluation and Research, 
regulates preventive vaccines under authorit y of section 351 of the Public Health Service 
Act (42 U.S.C. 262), as well as specific sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act, and reviews investigational new drug applications (INDs) and biologics license 
applications (BLAs). (See, for example, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 
Parts 312, 600, and 601). Most of the clinical trials of preventive vaccines conducted to 
support INDs and BLAs enroll health y volunteers in all phases of vaccine testing. The 
enrolment of healthy  volunteers warrants a very  low tolerance for risk in those clinical 
trials.
This guidance provides you, sponsors, monitors, and investigators of vaccine trials, with 
recommendations on assessing the severit y of clinical and laboratory abnormalities in 
healthy  adult and adolescent volunteers enrolled in clinical trials. The grading system 
described in the table can also be useful in defining a particular study ’s stopping rules 
(e.g.a certain number of AEs, as defined in the table, may  call for stopping the study ). 
Less extreme observations ( e.g.mild) may  not require discontinuing the study  vaccine 
but can still contribute to evaluating safety  by identify ing parameters to focus upon in 
subsequent product development. Uniform criteria for categorizing toxicities in healthy  
volunteers can improve comparisons of safet y data among groups within the same study  
and also between different studies. We, FDA, recommend using toxicity  grading scale 
tables, provided below, as a guideline for selecting the assessment criteria to be used in a 
clinical trial of a preventive vaccine. We recommend in corporation of such appropriate, 
uniform, criteria into the investigational plan, case report forms, and study  reports and 
correspondence with FDA, sponsors, monitors, investigators, and IRBs.
This guidance finalizes the draft guidance of the same title dated April 2005 (70 FR 
22664, May 2, 2005).

11-JUL -2019 135FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally  enforceable 
responsibilities. I nstead, guidances describe FDA’s current thinking on a topic and should 
be viewed onl y as recommendations, unless specific regulatory  or statutory  requirements 
are cited. The use of the word should in FDA’s guidances means that something is 
suggested or recommended, but not required.
ii.BACKGROUND
Standardized toxicity  assessment scales have been widely  used to e valuate products 
treating specific diseases. For example, the National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity  
Criteria Scale and the Division of AIDS’ Toxicity  Grading Scale standardize the 
evaluation of adverse events (AEs) among patients with cancer and HIV/ AIDS, 
respectivel y (Refs. 1, 2). The defined toxicity  parameters in those scales are designed for 
patients who may  already  experience mild, moderate, or severe adverse clinical or 
laboratory  events due to the disease process, and m ay not be appropriate for healthy  
volunteers.
In the development of the toxicity  grading scales for health y volunteers, we chose 
parameter limit values based on published information, when such values were available 
(Refs. 1-6). For example, the Brighton Collaboration has developed case definitions and 
guidelines to evaluate some AEs associated with administering vac cines (Ref. 3). In some 
cases, parameter limit values were based on clinical experience and experience reviewing 
vaccine clinical trials that enroll normal health y subjects.
Toxicity  grading scales for laboratory  abnormalities should consider the local laboratory  
reference values when the parameter limit values are defined. The characterization of 
laboratory  parameters among some populations of healthy  adults and adolescents may  
require the exercise of clinical judgment, for example, consideration of the potential for 
ethnic differences in white blood cell (WBC) counts or gender differences in creatine 
phosphokinase (CPK) values.
iii.TOXICITY GRADING SCALE TABLES
AEs in a clinical trial of a n investigational vaccine must be recorded and monitored and, 
when appropriate, reported to FDA and others involved in an investigation (sponsors, 
IRBs, and investigators). (See, for example, 21 CFR 312.32, 312.33, 312.50, 312.55, 
312.56, 312.60, 312.62, 312.64, and 312.66). Although the use of a toxicity  grading scale 
for AEs would not replace these regulatory  requirements, using a scale to categories 
adverse events observed during a clinical trial may assist you in monitoring safet y and 
making required re ports. Nonetheless, we believe that categorization or grading of data as 
outlined in this document is supplementary  to and should not replace full and complete 
data anal ysis.

11-JUL -2019 136These guidelines for toxicity  grading scales are primarily intended for healthy  adult and 
adolescent volunteers. The parameters in the tables below are not necessarily  applicable 
to every  clinical trial of healthy  volunteers. The parameters monitored should be 
appropriate for the specific study vaccine. For some preventive vaccines und er 
development, it may  be appropriate to include additional parameters to be monitored 
during a clinical trial or to alter the choice of values in the toxicity  table. For example, 
additional parameters might be added based on one or more of the following: safet y 
signals observed in pre -clinical toxicology  studies, the biological plausibility of the 
occurrence of certain AEs, or previous experience with a similar licensed product.
As discussed above, the tables do not represent a recommendation to monitor all the 
listed parameters in all clinical trials of health y volunteers, nor do the tables represent all 
possible parameters to be monitored. I n addition, these tables do not represent study  
inclusion or exclusion criteria. We recommend that the parameters monitored be 
appropriate for the stud y vaccine administered to healthy  volunteers participating in the 
clinical trial.

This study is considered as part of exploratory read -outs in the clinical protocol.
1.The in vivo protective effect of transferring pooled adult human serum from subjects 
from the FLU D- SUIV -ADJ-001 study  cohort to mice and subsequentl y challenging 
them with chimeric head -stalk HA virus, for example cHx/1Ny  virus (Hx = most 
likely  H6/1, Ny =most likely  N5; to be decided) or circula ting H1N1 (most likely  
H1N1 strain contained in the IIV4 control annual vaccines in accordance with WHO 
recommendation) will be assessed in terms of the following endpoints:
1A: Survival over 14 days post- challenge (day  of death or euthanasia for weight 
loss > 25% baseline bod y weight) in groups of 10 to 35mice/human -
group/ timepoint (number of mice = most likely  25, to be decided upon the 
pathogenicity  of the challenge virus in mice ; the exact sample size will be

11-JUL -2019 140Passive transfer experimental method :
Twenty  to 35 mice per timepoint per virus challenge will be transferred with a 
standard amount of undiluted human pooled serum (volume to be determined, within 
the range 150 -250L). The exact sample size by  challenge study  will be specified in 
an annex statistical report. Also, most lik ely all the human group serums will be 
tested but some groups might be excluded depending on the results obta ined,as the 
clinical trial progresses and in accordance with the animal ethical 3R’s principles.
Pre-transfer pooled serum human IgG titers against HA proteins or influenza virus 
will be evaluated b y ELISA as previously  mentioned .
Two hours post serum 
transfer,  the mice will be sedated and:
Blood will be collected for determination of post-transfer human IgG titers 
against HA proteins or influenza viruses by ELISA .
Then challenged with 10 x LD 50delivered b y the IN/IT route.
Mice will be monitored dail y for 14 days for weight -loss and will be euthanized if 
they lose > 25% of their initial body  weight or if any  human endpoints defined in the 
ethical protocol are met.
On Day 3 and /or Day 6 post- infection ,5 mice per timepoint/virus will be euthanized 
to assess viral lung titer s.This will occur at Day  3 or Day  6 post -challenge, or both, 
depending on anticipated additional supportive pre -clinical data. Upon results, lung 
histopathology  may be performed at selected timepoints on relevant groups.
Weighing of the mice and lungs processing will be performed in an open fashion. 
Viral plaques will be counted by  a blinded technician.
Lung suspensions will be made by  homogenization in PBS and frozen at - 80°C for 
later plaque assay  using a standard method.
Statistical analytical plan :
Statistical analy sis will be performed to evaluate the improved survival after challenge of 
any vaccine groups (mice receiving human pooled serum from chimeric HA- approach 
groups) compared to control group (mice receiving human pooled serum from IIV 4 
group), measured at each time point. Additional analysis might be added to the study  to 
detect potential association between post -transfer titers and survival , post -transfer titers 
and w eight loss or between lung -titers at Day 3 or Day 6 and survival.
The anal yses and reporting of those data will be handled by  the pre -clinical team 
according to their processes. No data will be incorporated in the clinical study  report, but 
presented as an appendix.
Ethical statement :
The study  protocol will be ethicall y reviewed and approved by the appropriate ethical 
committee and the study  will be carried out in accordance with national and international 
directives and the GSK Biologicals’ policy  on the care, welfare and treatment of animals.

Co-ordinating author: , Scientific Writer (XPE Pharma 
& Science for GSK Biologicals)
Rationale/background for changes:
This protocol is amended for the following reasons:
!To ensure that only healthy subjects with no risk factors for severe influenza-
related complications can be enrolled, an additional exclusion criterion has been added:
#Any condition that puts the subject at risk for serious influenza-related 
complications, as identified by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
!To account for an higher rate of non-evaluable subjects, the sample size has been 
increased by 20 subjects.
!The possibility to use a qualitative assay for the RSV-PCR assay has been added.
!To add the possibility to assess the lung titers in mice in the passive transfer 
experiment at Day 3 or at Day 6 post-challenge, or both, depending on anticipated 
additional supportive pre-clinical data; and to clarify that the pool of serum will be obtained using serum samples from evaluable subjects.
!To update the list of potential Immune-Mediated Diseases (pIMDs) to be aligned 
with the new version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. In addition, gout was added as the monitoring plan for this event (now considered a pIMD) became a commitment for the Company.

At the time of the protocol amendment 1, it was decided to increase the sample size 
from 450 to 470 subjects to take into account a larger rate of non -evaluable subjects 
than anticipated. The power computations from the initial protocol relative to safety 
endpoints were not modified because of the small sample size increase (about 2 
subjects per group, from 45 to 47). The immunogenicity endpoints evaluation will be 
done primarily on the Per- Protocol set, which is not deemed to increase (about 43 
subjects pe r group).
[…]
Table 27 presents the 95% CI s for different possible rates of immunological response 
within each group. A rate of unevaluable subjects of 2/45 (4%) has initially been 
considered for the immune response post -primary vaccination. As from protoc ol 
amendment 1, a rate of non-evaluable subjects of 4/4 7(9%) has been considered for 
the immune response post-primary vaccination .

Rationale/background for changes:
This protocol is amended for the following reasons:
!Based on recommendations from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, 
wording has been added to ensure that subjects with clinically significant grade 3 and above abnormal laboratory findings that cannot be reasonably explained maybe followed up with a repeat test.
!To add an hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay against cH6/1N5, H5N8 and 
H1N1 swine virus (as a tertiary objective/endpoint). These strains are the same as those to be tested by micro-neutralization (MN) assay .This will permit the measurement of the induction of antibodies reactive against the head domain of the antigens.
!To change the description of the influenza virus strain for the H2 full length 
ELISA testing.
!The results of the MN assay were removed from the data to be included the 
interim analysis planned at Day 85 due a delay in the availability of this testing.
!The protocol for the passive transfer/virus challenge experiment has been updated.
In addition, minor corrections/updates have been made and the list of contributing 
authors has been updated.

Sciences for GSK Biologicals)
Rationale/background for changes:
Following review of the Day 85 interim analysis and the additional interim analysis 
performed on available immunogenicity data from Phase I subjects who had completed their Visit 10 (Month 14 + 28 days), the Sponsor made the decision not to pursue the clinical development of the investigational supra-seasonal influenza vaccine. Based on 
these interim analyses results, some assays will not be performed or developed as 
initially planned, either because limited or no response is expected to be observed, or because the assay results are no longer relevant in light of the decision not to pursue the development of the investigational supra-seasonal influenza vaccine based on the chimeric hemagglutinin technology.
The changes are as follows:
!The cell-mediated immune response will not be assessed at Month 14 and later 
timepoints. The blood sampling for cell-mediated immunity at Visit 12 (Month 26) 
has been removed.
!The hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI) will not be performed on the 
inactivated influenza quadrivalent vaccine H1N1 component, cH11/1N1, cH6/1N5, H5N8 and H1N1 swine flu strains. For cH5/1N1 and cH8/1N1, the HI assay will only be performed until Visit 6 (Day 85).
!The micro-neutralisation (MN) assay will only be performed for cH6/1N5 and 
H1N1 until Visit 6 (Day 85). MN assay will not be performed for H5N8.
!The anti-group 2 hemagglutinin (HA) stalk response by ELISA will not be 
performed.
!The immune response in terms of anti-neuraminidase antibodies will not be 
assessed.

and Month 26 timepoints. The blood collection at Month 26 for passive transfer has been removed.
!The anti-H9 full length HA ELISA will not be performed.
!Anti-stalk antibody functionality will not be further investigated, except for the 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity until the interim analysis at Day 85.
!Occurrence of RT-PCR-confirmed influenza cases endpoint was removed.
In case samples have already been taken but not tested yet, they will be stored for

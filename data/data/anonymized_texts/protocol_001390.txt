 1. INTRODUCTION  46 
Peritoneal dialysis  (PD) is a form of renal replacement therapy indicated for those with acute 47 
kidney injury or end stage renal disease  (ESRD) . In 2013 PD was utilized  in approximately 7%  of 48 
the 660,000 prevalent patients with ESRD in the United States . Within that time, the  prevalence 49 
of PD has seen an increase by over 30% between 2007 – 2014.1 During  PD, a hyperosmolar 50 
solution  is introduced into the peritoneal cavity allowing solute exchange between the dialysate - 51 
contained in the cavity and  blood from the perfused peritoneum. A concentration gradient is thus 52 
created allowing ultrafiltration and diffusional clearance of toxic materials.  PD fluids  are available 53 
as glucose -based or non -glucose based solutions. Commonly prescribed glucose -based PD 54 
solutions hav e been associated with peritoneal membrane injury and negative systemic effects 55 
leading to suboptimal patient and technique survival. On the other hand, newer non -glucose 56 
based solution marketed in the United States  have shown to improve fluid removal duri ng long 57 
dialysis exchanges and offer  greater  peritoneal membrane  protection .2   58 
 59 
Principles of Peritoneal Dialysis  60 
Currently, two modalities of PD exist and is individualized based on patient and life -style specific 61 
factors. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) allows 4 – 5 exchanges performed 62 
manually whereas automated periton eal dialysis (APD) involves continuous, automated , cyclical  63 
exchanges performed by a device at home during the night.3 APD offers advantages over CAPD 64 
by allowing fluid -free or “dry” daytime dwel ls thereby permitting those who require PD liberty 65 
for their activities of daily living. In addition, several other advantages such as lower incidences 66 
of infection and hernias, enhanced solute clearances, and positive psychosocial impact have been 67 
reporte d.3 Overall, the prevalence of APD has been increasing throughout the years as  the 68 
number of patients utilizing CAPD declines.4  69 
 70 
Vancomycin in Peritoneal Dialysis  71 
Peritonitis is a common complication in PD and accounts for  a large portion  of hospital 72 
readmission and mortality.1,5 In addition, severe or prolonged peritonitis can lead to membrane 73 
failure prompting the switch from PD to hemodialysis.  The International Society of Peritoneal 74 
Dialysis (ISPD) recommends intraperitoneal administration  as the preferred route to deliver 75 
antibiotics in the absence of systemic bacteremia.5 Vancomycin is the most common antibiotic 76 
recommended and has notabl e gram -positive coverage used empirically during suspected 77 
peritonitis.   78 
Rationale for the Proposed Study  79 
Vancomycin is eliminated unchanged in the urine through glomerular filtration and is best 80 
characterized by a distribution and elimination phase foll owing parenteral administration. 81 
Vancomycin’s bactericidal activity is considered time -dependent with the ratio of the 24-hour  82 
area -under -the-concentration (AUC) versus time/minimal -inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio 83 
(AUC/MIC) being the best pharmacokine tic/pharmacodynamic predictor of effectiveness. The 84 
preferred AUC/MIC ratio is > 400. Dosing in the range of 15 -30 mg/kg is recommended by several 85 
Pharmacokinetics of Vancomycin in Automated Peritoneal Dialysis  
PROTOCOL  
Page 4 of 14 
 professional societies including ISPD to maintain a serum concentration level of 15 mg/L in order 86 
to maximize  efficacy and reduce toxicity , although this trough is only loosely correlated with 87 
corresponding AUC/MIC .5,6 Furthermore , the evidence supporting  this recommend ed trough  is 88 
essentially nonexistent  in PD patients on APD, where data on vancomycin bioavailability and 89 
clearance with varying degrees of peritoneal function is sparse.  In addition,  early 90 
pharmacokinetic studies were conducted only in patients on CAPD modalities, glucose -based 91 
prescriptions, or those on intravenous vancomycin.7-9  Lastly, the relationship between serum 92 
concentration and site of action at the peritoneal cavity wall is not established.  In totality, the 93 
goal is to close the knowledge gap in this very common use of vancomycin.  94 
Although the ISPD advisory comm ittee on peritonitis management recommends a 25% increase 95 
in antibiotic dose in non -anuric patients, residual kidney function may affect the  exposure, 96 
clearance, distribution and serum half -life for those antibiotics administered. This however is an 97 
empiric recommendation and there is no formal quantification of how residual kidney function 98 
(RKF)  may impact pharmacokinetics. The impact on RKF on vancomycin in PD is also lacking. RKF 99 
is critical for the welfare and survival  of PD patients. Indeed, 2 la rge multicenter studies, the 100 
Netherlands Cooperative Study on the Adequacy of Dialysis (NECOSAD -2) (AJKD;41:1293 -2302, 101 
2003) and the Canada/USA Peritoneal Adequacy Study (CANUSA)  (JASN, 12:2158 -2162, 2001) , 102 
both have shown statistically significant (by mul tivariable analyses) 12% reductions in mortality 103 
per ml/min/1.73 m2 residual GFR increase or per 5L/week  residual GFR increase, respectively.  104 
Hence, it is important to assess vancomycin pharmacokinetics in PD patients with RKF for two 105 
reasons. First, the enhanced vancomycin clearance of RKF may result in under -dosing and 106 
secondly, overdosing may result in nephrotoxicity and loss of critically important RKF. This 107 
presents a challenge when considering the bi -exponential pharmacokinetic behavior of 108 
vancomycin  and produces a significant source of variability allowing controversy in the role of 109 
monitoring serum vancomycin in patients on APD.10,11 110 
Interestingly, a  recent retrospective analysis examining residual renal function and peritonitis 111 
outcomes show that the  odds of peritonitis treatment failure for those with urinary creatinine 112 
clearances of greater than 5 mL/min were greater when co mpared to those who were anuric.12 113 
These associations further challenge the need for optimal vancomycin dosing strategies in 114 
patients on rapid -cycling modalities to maximize the efficacy, safety, and cost.   115 
Moreover, icodextrin a non -glucose based PD fluid, is an increasingly used PD dial ysate solution 116 
to complement conventional glucose -based PD fluids. Commonly prescribed glucose -based PD 117 
solutions have been associated with peritoneal membrane injury and negative systemic effects 118 
leading to suboptimal patient and technique survival. Non -glucose based solutions such as 119 
icodextrin marketed in the United States have shown to improve fluid removal during long 120 
dialysis exchanges and offer greater peritoneal membrane protection.  In-vitro studies conducted 121 
with 7.5% icodextrin demonstrate physic al compatibility and chemical stability, however there is 122 
a lack of information for the clearance, stability and effect on the minimum inhibitory 123

 concentration of vancomycin in -vivo.13 As there will be increasing use of icodextrin, 124 
characterization of vancomycin pharmacokinetics will be important.  125 
Therefore, this current study a ims to explore the pharmacokinetics  and pharmacodynamics  of 126 
intraperitoneal administered vancomycin in un -infected subjects on APD and explore the in -vivo 127 
behavior of vancomycin in 7.5% icodextrin PD solution.    128

and volume of dialyzer fluid (Kt/V), to vancomycin pharmacokinetics  146 
3. STUDY DESIGN  147 
3.1 Overvi ew and Design  148 
This is a  prospective,  single -site, open -label , pharmacokinetic study of vancomycin in infection - 149 
negative healthy adult patients on peritoneal dialysis. Prospective patients will be identified  150 
through Thomas Jefferson University Hospital nephrology practice. Subjects will be asked to 151 
consent prior to participation in the study . The majority  of research activities will take place at 152 
the Thomas Jefferson University Clinical Research Unit (CRU).  153 
 154 
Subjects will be on an APD  regimen consisting of a 12 -hour overnight dwell followed by a 9 -hour 155 
on-cycler exchange  (figure 1) . Vancomycin will be administered via intraperitoneal injection in 1 156 
liter of icodextrin solution. There will be 4 exchanges during  the 9 -hour exchange period. A sparse 157 
sampling approach will be used in collecting blood samples. A total of 16 blood samples will be 158 
collected.  159

Page 11 of 14 
 Dialysate parameters will be estimated following an NCA analysis.  Systemic bioavailability  from 377 
the peritoneal cavity and absorption constant will be estimated.  378 
 379 
5.2 Secondary Pharmacokinetic E ndpoint s 380 
Residual kidney function as it relates to vancomycin w ill be assessed based on vancomycin total 381 
urinary clearance and cumulative drug excretion. The total dialysate clearance of vancomycin will 382 
be explored based on the biological fluids obtained. The safety, tolerability, and stability of 383 
vancomycin in 7.5% i codextrin solution will also be described.  384 
 385 
5.3 Exploratory  Pharmacokinetic -Pharmacodynamic E ndpoints  386 
Parameters generated from the non-compartmental analysis will be used to parameterize the 387 
population pharmacokinetic model  to explore v arious dosing pro files. The AUC/ MIC ratio will be 388 
explored to correlate exposures to the effect of vancomycin in patients on APD.    389

 7. SAMPLE SIZE AND ANALYSIS PLAN  414 
8.1 Sample Size  415 
Due to the exploratory nature of this pharmacokinetic study, no fo rmal sample size calculation 416 
was performed. A total of 4 subjects will be enrolled.  417 
8.2 Statistical and Pharmacokinetic Analysis  418 
A non -compartmental analysis (NCA) will be utilized to estimate vancomycin pharmacokinetic 419 
parameters in patients on APD. The values generated from the NCA will be used to parameterize 420 
the population pharmacokinetic model.  421 
 422 
Data from all patients will be analyzed simultaneously using nonlinear mixed -effects modelling 423 
software (NONMEM). A base model will be developed to characterize the data. Covariate analysis 424 
will also be evaluated in the model to explain for any intra - and inter -patient PK variability. M odel 425 
qualification will be validated by using appropriate internal validation procedures based on the 426 
data and model development process.  427

and meets compliance standards mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and 432 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) and FDA 21 CFR  Part 11. Data files can be conveniently exported into 433 
various data formats (e.g. Microsoft Excel, SAS Statistical Software, R, SPSS, or STATA) for further 434 
analysis.  435 
8.2 Case Report Forms and Data Entry  436 
Clinical and demographic data will be collected from  paper source documents . Information will 437 
be entered into an electronic case report form (eCRF). Each enrolled subject’s eCRF will then be 438 
transcribed into REDCap and will serve as a central repository of all enrolled subjects in the study. 439 
A data monitor will monitor the accuracy of the study charts and data entry.  440 
8.3 Case Report Form Storage and Backup  441 
The eCRF will be stored in the Department  of Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics 442 
secured server. Access will only be granted by the principal investi gator or co -investigators.  443 
9. SAFETY  444 
Vancomycin has been previously studied  in non -infected patients on peritoneal dialysis. In 445 
addition, the dose selected in this study is not devoid of the doses used in previous studies 446 
administered intravenously or through the intraperitoneal route.7,9 The safety and tolerability of 447 
vancomycin administered through the intraperitoneal route will be assessed in this study by 448 
clinical evaluation of vital si gns, physical examinations, and laboratory safety evaluations. In 449 
addition, continual serum concentration monitoring through blood sampling will be performed 450

 as part of this research study. In addition, the likelihood for rare adverse events to vancomycin 451 
such as ototoxicity will be unlikely to occur based on the minimal dose used compared to 452 
literature.14 Nephrotoxicity from a single IP 20 mg/kg dose of vancomycin would be extremely 453 
unlikely in stable, non -septic patients receiving no other p otentially nephrotoxic medicatio ns or 454 
intravenous contrast . Major risk factors for nephrotoxicity related to vancomycin dosing include 455 
large daily doses (> 4grams/day), prolonged duration , and concurrent potentially toxic antibiotics 456 
(aminoglycosides or piperacillin -tazobactam), none of which apply to this study protocol. Other 457 
associated adverse events relating to vancomycin such as anaphylaxis and development of 458 
Clostridium difficile  infections are considered unlike ly.15 In the event that greater than two 459 
unexpected and treatment related serious adverse events occur, the study will be halted unti l 460 
review from an independent study monitor is conducted. Cumulative blood draws will be 461 
restricted to less than 3 mL per sampling procedure and will be kept in strict accordance with 45 462 
CFR 46.402(a) OHRP expedited review categories. Subjects who enrolled in the study will already 463 
have hemoglobin levels greater than 9 g/dL eliminating the concern for anemia requiring blood 464 
transfusion.  465

1. INTRO DUCTION  
The purpose of the Lung Institute is to collect and process a patient’s own stem cells and platelet rich plasma (PRP) and 
deliver them back to the patient same -day through an intravenous catheter and sometimes by nebulizer. Lung Institute’s 
treatme nt is limited to self -funded patients with chronic lung diseases – chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
and interstitial lung disease (ILD). The patient’s stem cells and platelet rich plasma are collected through venous, adipose 
or bone marrow harv esting techniques. After the stem cells and platelet rich plasma have been isolated they are 
administered back to the patient. An inhaled antioxidant, glutathione, is administered during treatment to help mobilize lung  
secretions.  
 
Researchers have demonst rated that  using autologous stem  cells (those derived from the patient) with  minimal 
manipulation is safe and effective to promote the healing of lung tissue affected by COPD and ILD. The administration of 
glutathione to mobilize secretions in the lung has  been determined a safe and effective addition to treatment (Jones, 2011).  
In a pilot study conducted by Dr. Jack Coleman at Lung Institute Nashville, after following approximately 100 treated 
patients, Dr.  Coleman discovered that within three months of treatment, 84 percent of patients reported improvement in 
their quality of life (Coleman, 2016). For millions of people suffering from COPD, a natural decline in pulmonary health is 
a harsh reality. Based on  these results, stem  cell therapy gives promise to  improving their quality of life and slowing down 
the progression of disease.  
At this time, autologous stem cell collection and administration is not commercially available and therefore is 
considered an inve stigational agent under the standards of the Texas Medical Board.  
Lung Institute’s collection and administration of stem cells as investigational agents in the state of Texas is part of a 
systematic program monitored under the strict oversight of Lung Inst itute’s business associate and medical management 
services company, Regenerative Medical Solutions (RMS). Lung Institute and RMS are committed to the highest level of 
concern and caution for the welfare, safety and comfort of the patient to whom the cell t herapy treatment is administered.  
The hypothesized outcomes of Lung Institute therapy are safety and minimization of adverse events, a perceived 
improvement in the patient’s lung condition (to be determined by their ability to be more physically active; wa lking greater 
distances with or without oxygen and improved quality of life scales), an improvement in their FEV1 5 -10% or more, the 
ability to reduce their use of oxygen and possibly to stop it., the ability to function well without the use of rescue inha lers, 
reduction or ceasing of secondary pulmonary infections, reduction in emergency room visits and hospitalizations related 
to their disease, and an improvement in their six minute walk test.

22..  BACKGROUND  
Currently, literature on the outcomes of autologous stem cell treatment for COPD is lacking.  
• A white paper released by the Medical Director at Lung Institute Nashville found an 84 percent re sponse rate 
in improved quality of life indicators among 100 patients followed after treatment (Coleman,  2016).  
• The Lung Institute is a leader in the field of regenerative medicine with strong clinical protocols and a solid 
understanding of the safety and efficacy of stem cell treatment for chronic lung  disease.  
2a. Situating the Researcher  
Melissa Rubio is a doctorally -prepared Family Nurse Practitioner certified by the American Nurses Credentialing Center 
and licensed to practice in the state of Texas. A member of the Southern Nursing Research Association, Dr. Rubio has 
experience designing and conducting qualitative and quantitative research and mixed -methods studies. Her doctoral 
dissertation was a qualitative study involving a marginalized popu lation of drug -addicted women (Rubio, 2013). She has 
also done pilot work on a population of incarcerated women  using quantitative methods. Dr. Rubio has a current manuscript 
pending review on using the interpretive phenomenological inquiry method for qual itative research. Dr. Rubio is well -
experienced in the protection of human research subjects. She is an expert in the promoting rigor in qualitative research 
design and situating its importance in medical research.  
Dr. Rubio is a nationally certified and p racticing Family Nurse Practitioner. In addition to her research role, Melissa will be 
the primary clinician at the research site, providing physical assessments, reviewing patient medical records and formulating  
the patient plan of care. Because each pati ent of the Lung Institute is treated using the same protocols (there are no control 
groups), this minimizes the conflict of interest, randomization and blinding that must occur with experimental studies.  
33..  AIM(S)  OF STUDY  
Through the collection of qualitativ e and quantitative data, Lung Institute aims to explore and describe the safety and 
efficacy of autologous stem cell treatment for chronic lung disease with dissemination to the public and to the medical 
community for the advancement of regenerative medici ne. The study aims to confirm the safety of autologous cell therapy, 
explore the effect of autologous cell therapy treatment on pulmonary function, and to describe the anecdotal quality of life 
changes of patients following treatment using both quantitativ e and qualitative measures.  
44..  RESEARCH  QUESTIONS  
The research questions to be informed by this investigation are as follows:  
1. Is the collection and administration of autologous stem cells for the treatment of chronic lung disease  safe?  
2. Does treatment with aut ologous stem cells for chronic lung disease improve measurements of 
pulmonary function (specifically  FEV1)?  
3. Does treatment with autologous stem cells for chronic lung disease improve the patient’s perceived quality  of 
life? 
5. HYPOTHESES  
5a. Primary Hyp othesis/Quantitative Arm  
Null hypothesis: Following autologous stem cell treatment for chronic lung disease, patients will have no improvement in 
pulmonary function (measured by FEV1) at six months  
Alternative hypothesis: Following autologous stem cell tre atment for chronic lung disease, patients will have an increase in 
pulmonary function (measured by FEV1) of 5 to 10% or more

5b. Secondary Hypothesis/Quantitative A rm 
There will be no adverse events reported following autologous stem cell treatment for chronic lung disease.  
5c. Qualitative Arm  
An ass umption of qualitative research is that no pre -determined hypothesis is made. Following autologous stem cell 
treatment for chronic lung disease, patients will report improvement in at least one of several quality of life indicators.  
66..  STUDY  DESIGN  
This study  uses a concurrent mixed -methods approach to collect and analyze both qualitative and quantitative data. The 
quantitative arm will use a non -experimental, descriptive approach to measure and analyze pre - and post -stem cell 
treatment pulmonary function test  results of treated patients. Measurement of the occurrence of adverse events will also 
be part of the quantitative arm.  
Pre-treatment pulmonary function test results (measured by FEV1) will be compared with a six -month post -treatment 
pulmonary function te st result (FEV1) for each patient.  The aim of this method is to generalize an improvement in pulmonary 
function (measured by FEV1) among the general population of all individuals treated by autologous cell therapy for chronic 
lung disease.  
The qualitative arm of the study uses an interpretive phenomenological approach to collect and analyze pre - and post - cell 
therapy anecdotal data regarding perceived quality of life among treated patients. Phenomenological research involves 
investigating the lived experie nce. 
Qualitative research has several assumptions (D. Nicholls, 2009; Ritchie & Lewis, 2003 ). Primarily, there is no 
predetermined theoretical framework - rather the theory, if any, is derived from the data. Secondly, qualitativ e research is 
context -driven. Finally, qualitative researchers focus on the emic perspective that concerns itself with the view, perspectives 
and descriptions of others.  
This study uses an interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) approach throughout th e study from planning to data 
collection to analysis. This methodology is used to illuminate each participant’s variation of the same general phenomenon 
(in this case, COPD) (Reissman, 2008 ; Ritchie & Lewis, 2003 ). 
Data from both arms of the study will be combined following data collection for analysis, discussion and presentation. Safety  
data on adverse outcomes will be tracked and reported separately as a descriptive, quantitative analysis.

1111..  STUDY  PROCEDURES  
Informed Consent Form is obtained. Consent form must be complete, signed,  and dated without forgeries or alterations. 
Information should be delivered in a manner in which the Patient and/or the patient’s legal representative could reasonably 
be expected to understand.  
A review of the patient’s medical record will be conducted t o approve for treatment. Approved treatment plans will be 
documented in the patient’s electronic medical record. Medical records obtained from external providers will be kept in the 
patient’s medical record and must include recent laboratory data, results of any outside office notes, chest x -ray results and 
any relevant information as required per treatment inclusions and exclusions protocol.  
Prior to Bone Marrow aspiration, Adipose extraction, and Venous stem cell administration, the clinician will perform a 
physical assessment. Attached are the following Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for each type of cell therapy that 
Lung Institute pr ovides to qualified candidates:  
• Venous Procedure  
• Adipose Extraction Procedure  
• Bone Marrow Aspirate  Procedure  
Patient follow -up may be conducted at the Lung Institute facility or may be completed by telephone at 2 weeks, 3 months 
and 6 months post -treatment  to measure adverse events and quality of life. Patient participation in these phone calls is 
voluntary. Data collected at these time points will be entered into password -protected database for data management and 
reporting. Patients will be issued a journ al during their treatment to record quality of life indicators from the time they are 
discharged from the clinic until they are called for follow -up. This allows the patients to better recall how they felt/are feeling 
to better communicate progress during follow -up appointments/calls.  
Patients will have pulmonary function testing 6 months post -treatment. This will be done at the Lung Institute facility, or by 
their primary care physician, or pulmonologist.  
All adverse events are reported to the Principal In vestigator.  The Medical Director and Compliance Department are notified 
within 24 hours  for appropriate follow -up. These events  are documented in the patient’s medical  record. Additionally, 
adverse events will be reported to the Quality Improvement & Risk Management (QI&RM) Committee for interdepartmental 
transparency and to meet internal and external reporting requirements. Per MaGil IRB Investigators Handbook §5 -
Investigator Responsibilities, the IRB will be notified within 5 days from the PI becoming awa re of any adverse events 
requiring immediate intervention to prevent serious harm, and within 10 days for any problem or unanticipated occurrence.  
11a. Recruitment of participants  
Patients are included in treatment by self -referral. Patient coordinators co nduct a series of questions with prospective 
patients to determine initial candidacy. If prospective patients are found to meet candidacy criteria, records are obtained 
to be reviewed by the mid -level provider and/or physician to determine final eligibilit y and approval for treatment.  
11b. Randomization  
Neither the participants, nor the investigator, or those assessing/analyzing the outcome(s), will be blind (or masked) to 
group assignment; all patients will receive treatment.  
11c. Measurement tools used  
Pulmonary function test (FEV1)  
Quality of life questionnaire (see attached)

11e. Safety considerations/Patient safety  
The safety of research participants is foremost. S trict policies and procedures and standard operating procedures have 
been developed to ensure the safety of patients during the stem cell retrieving and administration procedures. Adverse 
events, as well as near -miss events are reported to the Principal In vestigator, Medical Director, Compliance Department, 
and the Quality Improvement & Risk Management (QI&RM) Committee. The Lung Institute’s management services 
company, Regenerative Medicine Solutions (RMS) provides continuous oversight and closely monitors  the adherence to 
regulatory standards and policies and procedures. The Compliance Program ensures that all staff are trained on the 
appropriate identification and reporting of adverse events and near -misses, including potential breaches in protocols or 
patient safety and privacy standards.  
Patient safety and risk management protocols are incorporated throughout our Policies & Procedures (P&Ps) and the 
oversight and trending of our protocols, as well as their effectiveness and adherence is monitored by and reported to the 
Quality Improvement & Risk Management (QI&RM) Committee . 
Patient’s p rotected health information is also strictly protected; adherence to HIPAA & HITECH standards are continuously 
monitored by the Compliance Department. Staff is trained on protection of patient health information protocols within the 
first 30 days from hire , and annually thereafter.  
All Lung Institute Dallas clinical staff are trained in the protection of human subjects for research. Additionally, each 
clinical staff member is trained on job functions and assessed for competency on an annual basis.  
11f. Data  monitoring and Storage  
The Compliance department of Regenerative Medicine Solutions will oversee the conduct of research and data 
management.  
Although identifying information will not be used for the final presentation of findings, data will not be de -identified at the 
point of collection or storage. Texas Medical Board code requires that full contact information be kept on all stem -cell treated 
patients and available for presentation to the Board within 14 days if requested.  
12. STATISTICAL  CONSI DERATIONS  AND  DATA  ANALYSIS  
12a. Sample size  
The anticipated sample size for this study is two hundred patients.  
12b. Statistical methods  
For the quantitative, descriptive arm of this study, sample characteristics will be collected to include age, sex and diagnosis. 
Pre- and post -treatment FEV1 measurements will be collected on each patient and evaluated by simple measures of central 
tendency (mean, median and mode). Sufficient descriptive data will be collected and reported to encourage replication of 
our study.  
For the qualitative, anecdotal arm of the study, Lung Institute utilizes CCQ, the Clinical COPD Questionnaire to document 
patient’s perceptions on improved quality of life. The information will be collected and interpreted by evaluating for common  
themes within the anecdotes. As a note regarding the rigor of qualitative research: is important in qualitative research to 
ensure that the study is credible and trustworthy (Smith, Flowers and Larkin, 2009). A number of guidelines for assessing 
this qualit y look toward establishing credibility. Psychologist Lucy Yardley’s work in 2000 provides the principles for 
assessing the quality of qualitative research and how the interpretive phenomenological method can address them. First, 
the study must provide good  sensitivity to context . In this study, the immersion in the clinic through field experience, the 
existing literature on COPD and stem cell treatment, and the anecdotes obtained  
 
Rev_2/5/16 Page 7 of 10  
Research Protocol  
Lung Institute Dallas  
 
from the participants will contribute to building an awareness of the phenomena. Awareness of the patient, empathy, active 
listening, and providing comfort to the participants will be used (Smith et al., 2009).  
Yardley’s second broad  principle is commitment. Commitment comes from the degree of attentiveness to the participant 
during the interview, the thoughtfulness of the work, and the completeness of the analysis undertaken. As described, the 
analysis needs to be conducted systemati cally and also be sufficiently interpretative - rather than simply describing, the 
analysis must also be interpretive and reflective. The third broad principle is transparency and how clearly the stages of the 
study are presented to the reader. This princip le suggests a careful description of how the participants were selected, how 
the interview was conducted and the steps used to analyze the data. Also the study must provide cohesiveness, and the 
themes need to mesh together logically. With this, the founda tional steps of the IPA method need to be clearly demonstrated 
(Smith et al., 2009). In this study, each stage of the study will be defined in the presentation of data. This will allow ano ther 
researcher to replicate the study if desired.  
Yardley’s fourth principle, impact and  importance , relates to the study’s ability to tell the researcher something interesting, 
important or useful” (Smith et al., 2009). This study will inform the public and medical community on the safety and efficacy  
of autologous stem cell treatment for chronic lung disease.  
1133..  RISK  AND  BENEFIT  ANALYSIS  
All measures are taken to minimize or mitigate risks to the patient. The following lists the potential risks as indicated on the 
patient informed consent:  
• Adverse reaction to stem cells - There is a possibility of an adverse reaction to the application of stem cells. This risk 
is minimized by using autologous (your own) unaltered stem  cells.
• Anemia - There have been reports of anemia with harvesting of stem cells from the circul ation. This risk is low. To minimize 
this risk we request blood work  (CBC).
• Embolus development - An embolus is a clot that may be from blood or cells such as fat or bone marrow. There is a chance 
that an embolus or emboli (plural) may develop with stem ce ll procedures. This risk is low and is minimized due to our stem 
cells processing  protocols.
• Failure of the procedure - There is a chance that undergoing stem cell application will not alleviate symptoms, 
resolve inflammation, or assist in regenerating  tissue.
• Fever - Fever associated with stem cell harvesting usually responds to acetaminophen. If fevers persist, a work -up for 
infection must be  completed. 
• Infection - Infection may occur at the donor site where the bone marrow or fat was harvested or at the IV site and recipient 
site of application.  To minimize risk infection prevention protocols are maintained and followed during the treatment process 
and patient education is provided on post treatment cleaning and wound care. 
• Pain - Any procedure can result  in pain. To minimize this risk we ask that our patients communicate any discomfort so that 
we can reduce or  mitigate.
• Numbness/tingling – Although a low risk, this has been reported with leukapheresis (the process of separating stem cells 
from peripheral blood in the vein). Laboratory analysis may be required along with calcium  infusion.
• Respiratory difficulties - Breathing difficulties (which are usually temporary) or post -operative pneumonia, may occur as a 
result of any procedure or surger y. Pulmonary embolus, a blood clot causing blockage of an artery in the lungs may occur as 
a result of any procedure or surgery. Pulmonary embolus may be  fatal.
• Stroke - Though a low risk and unlikely, there is a possibility that a stroke will occur during the procedure or in the 
recovery  period.
• Transfers of undiagnosed cancer – There is a risk that undiagnosed cancer in the area where the stem cells are harvested 
may b e transferred to the recipients area of transplantation. To minimize risks, stem cells will not be altered in any way, 
thereby reducing the risk of tumor induction by  carcinogens. 
 
Rev_2/5/16 Page 8 of 10  
Research Protocol  
Lung Instit ute Dallas  
 
• Administration of incorrect stem cells – The stem cells administered are the recipients own stem cells. There is a low risk 
of administration errors.  Materials are clearly marked before they leave the procedure room, eliminating the risk of a r ecipient 
receiving someone else’s stem cells in error. 
• Unintended differentiation - The unintended differentiation of stem cells was found in a single study in which extensive 
intra-myocardial calcification after unselected bone -marrow cells transplantatio n was seen in the peri -infarct and infarct areas 
in rats. Though a low risk, unintended differentiation could occur in areas of stem cell  implantation. 
The following lists the potential benefits of treatment:  
• Increased Activity - Ability to be more physica lly active; walking greater  distances. 
• PFT - Improvement in their FEV1 5 -10% or more. 
• Oxygen - Ability to reduce their use of oxygen and possibly to stop  it.
• Reduction in Medications - Ability to function well without the use of their bronchodilator inhalers and  Prednisone. 
• Increased Pulmonary Health - Reduction or ceasing of secondary pulmonary  infections
1144..  ETHICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
This study will be conducted in full conformance with princip les of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and within the laws and 
regulations of the state of Texas and the United States regarding stem cell treatment. It is the priority of the participants ’ 
interests over those of science or of society that will be safeguarde d. 
Informed consent for treatment is paramount. This ensures that participants can read and understand the information they 
need to make an informed decision about their voluntary treatment . A copy of the informed consent is attached to this 
protocol.  
Patients are treated by the Lung Institute on a fee -for-service basis. This introduces an ethical consideration that the 
treatment  is available  only to  those patients who can afford  treatment. Therefore,  results  of our  study and th e 
experiences of our patients may not be generalizable to those who cannot pay for treatment.  To mitigate the risk of ethical 
implications, patients will never be coerced into treatment, promised that they will see a definite improvement in their 
condition , or will be compensated for their treatment.

Study Description                                                                                                               
This study involves exploring the outcomes of treatment using your body’s own, unaltered stem 
cells to promote repair of damaged lung tissue from chronic lung disease. The aim of the study is 
an improvement in your pulmonary function an d quality of life after treatment.  
 
This Study Involves Research  
Because this study uses cells from your own body, we are exempt from Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) oversight. In the state of Texas, whenever stem cell treatment is used it is 
considered  investigative and strict procedures and oversight of your treatment are required and 
ensured. In addition, we will be tracking data on the outcomes of all of our treated patients in 
order to inform future patients and the future of stem cell medical thera py.

How many participants will be enrolled in t he study?  
Approximately 200 patients will be enrolled in the study.  
 
What will I be asked to do if I participate in the study?  
The application of autologous (patient’s own) stem cells is performed to diminish inflammation 
and improve pulmonary function. Th e application of stem cells can be utilized as a stand -alone 
procedure or as an adjunct to other procedures.  
 
What is the purpose of this study?  
The purpose of this study is to obtain information regarding the efficacy of stem cell treatments 
for treating COPD and ILD. The application of autologous (patient’s own) stem cells is performed 
to diminish inflammation and improve pulmonary function. The application of stem cells can be 
utilized as a stand -alone procedure or as an adjunct to other procedures.  
 
How  long will I be asked to participate in this study?  
Treatments are conducted over the course of three days; thereafter, you will be expected to 
provide Lung Institute  with feedback regarding your progress, specifically as it relates to your 
quality of life improvements and PFT results. Feedback will be obtained over the course of six 
months, and up to a year.  Outreach to obtain results will be conducted at a minimum of 2 weeks, 
3 months, and 6 months.

Risks and Minimizing Risks                                                                                               
What risks will I face by participating in this study?  
Although there are risks as sociated with the application of stem cell treatments, the risks 
are minimized by applying autologous stem cells same day and additional risk factors may 
be mitigated with appropriate protocols focused on patient safety; therefore the overall risk 
to benef it relationship results in a treatment with minimal risks which can improve a patient’s 
quality of life.  
• Abdominal or pelvic organ perforation - Stem cells harvested from bone marrow are 
obtained from the pelvis (posterior iliac crest). There is a small ri sk of organ (bowel, bladder, 
ureter, urethral) perforation when obtaining the bone marrow from the pelvis. Perforations may 
not be diagnosed immediately. This risk is low. All perforations require surgical repair. This risk 
is minimized by careful introduc tion of the harvesting needle into the bone marrow and by  
extensive training of the providers.  
• Adverse reaction to stem cells - There is a possibility of an adverse reaction to the 
application of s tem cells. This risk is minimized by using autologous (your own) unaltered stem  
cells.  
• Anemia - There have been reports of anemia with harvesting of stem cells from the 
circulation. This risk is low. To minimize this risk we request blood work  (CBC).  
• Bleed ing - It’s possible, though unusual, to experience an episode of bleeding, which may be 
excessive, during or after a procedure or treatment. Bleeding may require additional treatment 
or transfusion of blood or blood products. Certain medications, such as a spirin, anti - 
inflammatory drugs, or blood thinners may increase the risk of bleeding. This risk will be 
minimized by a review of your medical history and medications prior to your procedure as well  
as the application of appropriate pressure to the treatment site whenever bleeding could occur.  
• Blood clot development - Blood clots may occur with any type of procedure or treatment. 
Clots can block blood flow and cause complications, including pain, swel ling, inflammation, 
tissue damage, pulmonary emboli, or death. We will minimize this risk by utilizing safe and 
appropriate treatment  modalities.  
• Cardiac complications - There is a small chance that having the procedure could cause an 
irregular heartbeat o r a heart attack. To minimize this risk we obtain  EKG.  
• Death - Although the risk is remote, death may occur during or soon after any procedure 
or surgical procedure. We will minimize this risk by using safe and appropriate treatment  
modalities.  
• Dizziness - Dizziness after blood donation may occur. It has also been reported after 
harvesting of stem cells from the bone marrow. It usually responds to IV fluids. You can 
minimize this risk by ensuring that you are well -hydrated and have eaten the day of your  
procedure.  
• Embolus development - An embolus is a clot that can be from blood or cells such as bone 
marrow. There is a chance that an embolus or emboli (plural) may develop with stem cell 
procedures. This risk is low and is minimized due to our stem cells proc essing  protocols.  
• Failure of the procedure - There is a chance that undergoing stem cell application will not 
alleviate symptoms, reduce inflammation or improve lung function. Recurrence of pulmonary 
symptoms may  recur.  
• Fever - Fever associated with stem cell harvesting usually responds to acetaminophen. 
If fevers persist, a work -up for infection must be  completed.  
• Fracture - Fracture of the bone where the bone marrow is harvested can lead to significant 
pain and possibly the n eed for surgery. This complication is not common and will likely heal with 
simple activity modification. This risk will be minimized by careful introduction and removal of 
the harvesting needle into and out of the bone and only after extensive training of the provider.  
• Hypotension - Hypotension or low blood pressure has been reported after harvesting of stem 
cells from the bone marrow. It usually responds to IV fluids. This risk can be minimized by 
ensuring that you are well -hydrated and have eaten the day of the  procedure.  
Rev_9/22/2016 Page 3 of 7  
20Sep2016 - Version 3.0  
LI-001 
 
• Infection - Infection may occur at the donor site where the bone marrow was harvested or at 
the IV site and recipient site of application. To minimize risk infection prevention protocols are 
maintained and followed during the treatment process and patient education is provided on post 
treatment cleaning and wound  care. 
• Pain - Any procedure can result in pain. To minimize this risk we ask that our patients 
communicate any discomfort so that we can reduce or  mitigate.  
• Nausea/vomiting - Nausea and vomiting have been rep orted with bone marrow harvesting. 
This is usually temporary and responds to supportive care. Again, this can be minimized 
with good hydration and nutrition the day of the  procedure.  
• Numbness/tingling - Although a low risk, this has been reported with leuk apheresis (the 
process of separating stem cells from peripheral blood in the vein). Laboratory analysis may be 
required along with calcium  infusion.  
• Respiratory difficulties - Breathing difficulties (which are usually temporary) or post -operative 
pneumonia , may occur as a result of any procedure or surgery. Pulmonary embolus, a blood 
clot causing blockage of an artery in the lungs may occur as a result of any procedure or 
surgery. Pulmonary embolus may be  fatal. 
• Scar Formation - Scar tissue forms as a part of the natural healing process after any 
procedure, surgery, or injury. In rare circumstances, some patients can form excessive amounts 
of scar tissue that can be a source of pain. Scarring can by minimized by massage and applying 
vitamin E oil to the site  after the incision has healed completely. Unfortunately, not all scarring 
can be  prevented.  
• Soreness - Pain at the site of stem cell harvesting or site of application will occur. It is unlikely 
to be permanent. We will minimize this risk using local anest hetic during the  procedure.  
• Stroke - Though a low risk and unlikely, there is a possibility that a stroke will occur during 
the procedure or in the recovery  period.  
• Transfers of undiagnosed cancer - There is a risk that undiagnosed cancer in the area 
where the stem cells are harvested may be transferred to the recipients area of transplantation. 
To minimize risks, stem cells will not be altered in any way, thereby reducing the risk of tumor 
inductio n by carcinogens.  
• Administration of incorrect stem cells - The stem cells administered are the recipients own 
stem cells. There is a low risk of administration errors. Materials are clearly marked before they 
leave the procedure room, eliminating the risk of a recipient receiving someone else’s stem 
cells in  error. 
• Tumorigenicity - There is no evidence that point -of-care adult stem cells cause tumors. Initial 
concerns on tumorigenicity (formation of tumors) after adult stem cell therapy decreased as 
experim ental and clinical data have revealed no such complication reported to date. Human 
mesenchymal stem cells can undergo spontaneous transformation following long -term in vitro 
(out of the body) culture of approximately 4 -5 months. Your stem cells will not be  cultured and  
will be used immediately during the procedure, thereby minimizing this risk.  
• Unintended differentiation - Stem cells are cells that have the ability to develop into one of 
several different types of cells. The cells may transplant into an are a of the body and start to 
grow into certain types of cells that we do not want them to grow into. Although rare, in a single 
study it was found that bone -marrow harvested stem cells transplanted into rats caused a 
calcification, or hardening, of the cells  of the rat's heart that was not intended. Though a low  
risk, unintended differentiation could occur in areas of stem cell implantation.  
• If Pregnant - Or may become pregnant, there may be risks to you, the embryo, or fetus that are 
unforeseeable. If you ar e pregnant, or have reason to believe that you may be pregnant, you must 
notify the Lung Institute Principle Investigator  immediately.

Source of Fundy for the Study                                                                                          
Will I be charged anything for participating in this study?  
There is no cost to you to participa te in the data collection and investigation of your response 
to treatment.  
 
At this time, insuranc e companies are not covering the cost of stem cell therapy therefore 
the cost of treatment is the responsibility of the patient. It will likely be a few more years 
before insurance covers the cost of stem cell treatment. If you have questions about this, a  
patient coordinator will be able to help.  
 
Are subjects paid or given anything for being in the study?  
No. You are not given any payments for your participation during or after the study.

results in scientific journals or at scientific conferences. Only the Principal Investigator and 
clinic staff will have immediate access to the information. However, the Institutional Review 
Board or appropriate f ederal agencies like the Office for Human Research Protections may 
review your records.  
 
Why is my information collected?  
It is important to us and to the future of stem cell therapy that we track your response to 
treatment over time. This information will  be used to inform future patients and the 
medical community of the results of stem cell treatment for chronic lung  disease.  
 
How is my information protected?  
The pro tection of confidential health information is of the highest importance. Your electronic 
medical record is protected by safeguards to ensure that only the staff that are required to view 
your records do so. Oversight of clinic staff and of your protected h ealth information is enforced

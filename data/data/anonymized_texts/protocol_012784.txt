Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  7 Confidential  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PD) Correlations:  
The PK/PD relationship and immunogenicity of OKZ will be assessed by:  
• Characterizing the dose/exposure- response relationships related to efficacy endpoints 
(e.g., ACR20  response) and identifying potential factors that may impact the efficacy endpoints  
• Characterizing the dose/exposure- response relationships related to safety endpoints (e.g., lipids and 
neutrophils) and identifying potential factors that may impact the safety endpoints  
• Evaluating the impact of ADAs on subject safety, efficacy, and PK of OKZ  
Exploratory Endpoints:  
• Exploratory pharmacogenetic (PG) assessments (in subjects who sign the separate PG  informed 
consent form [ ICF] only) to examine whether individual genetic variation in genes relating to drug 
metabolism, RA, and the drug target pathway confers a differential response to OKZ.  
• Exploratory biomarker assessments aiming to identify potential markers that are associated with 
treatment response to OKZ, correlated with the severity or progression of RA, or are cardiovascular 
(CV) surrogate biomarkers.  
Safety Endpoints:  
• The nature, incidence, severity, and outcome of adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESIs)  
• Proportions of subjects with AEs, SAEs, and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities  
• Assessment of changes over time in clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, and physical examination findings  
• Incidence and titer of ADAs to OKZ, incidence of neutralizing antibodies, and the time course of antibodies  
Methodology:  
The CREDO 3 study includes a 4 -week Screening Period, a double -blind Treatment Period from Week  0 to 
Week 24, and a S afety  Follow -Up Period from Week  24 to Week 44. 
Subjects will be assessed for eligibility to enter the study during a 4 -week Screening Period.  At randomization, 
a total of 350 eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 2 :2:1 ratio (140, 140, 
and 70 subjects  per group , respectively) : 
1. OKZ 64  mg q4w:  SC injection of OKZ 64 mg q4w (alternating with SC injection of placebo OKZ 
q4w to maintain blinding)  + MTX . 
2. OKZ 64  mg q2w:  SC injection of OKZ 64 mg q2w  + MTX . 
3. Placebo:  SC injection of placebo q2w  + MTX.  
Throughout the double -blind Treatment Period, all subjects will be required to remain on a stable dose of 
background MTX at 15  to 25 mg/week (or ≥ 10 mg/week if there is documented intolerance to higher doses) 
with a stable route of admin istration , and concomitant treatment with folic acid ≥5  mg per week or equivalent is 
required for all subjects .  Following Visit 2 ( randomization ), subjects will return to the study site at least every 
other week through Week 24 for response and safety assessments as per the study Schedule of Events .  Blood 
samples to assess OKZ concentrations in plasma will be collected periodically during the T reatment Period as 
per the study Schedule of Events.  
Subjects in the placebo group wil l receive their l ast dose of placebo  at Week 14.  Starting a t Week  16, all 
subjects in the placebo group will be randomized in a blinded fashion to receive either OKZ 64 mg q2w or OKZ 64 mg q4w  for the remainder of the double -blind Treatment Period  such that  equal number s of subjects 
are assigned to each OKZ treatment group.   The last dose of OKZ will be at Week 20 for subjects receiving 
OKZ 64 mg q4w and at Week  22 for subjects receiving OKZ 64 mg q2w . 
Subjects will be classified in terms of their response to study treatment at Week  14, with n onresponders  defined 
as subjects in any treatment group who do not improve by at least 20% in swollen and tender joint counts 
(66-68 joint  assessment ).  Starting at or as close as possible to Week 14, nonresponders wil l be administered

After completion of the 2 4-week , double -blind Treatment Period, subjects will either roll over into the 
long-term open -label extension (OLE) study or enter the S afety Follow -Up Period .  During the Safety 
Follow -Up Period, subjects will return for visits  +4, +8, and + 22 weeks after the last dose of study treatment  at 
Week  22 as per the S chedule of Events (Visits  SFU-1 [Week  26], SFU-2 [Week  30], and SFU-3 [Week  44], 
respectively).  
Adverse events will be assessed throughout the study (starting when the subject signs the ICF) and evaluated 
using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.  
Subjects who discontinue the randomized treatment prematurely  will be required to come for the End  of 
Treatment (EoT) Visit 2 weeks after the last study treatment  administration and then continue with the  
scheduled study visits as per the Schedule of Event s. 
There will be ongoing monitoring of safety events, including laboratory findings, by the Sponsor or the 
Sponsor’s designee.   In addition, safety will be assessed throughout the study by an independent Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB).  
Planned number  of subjects:  A total of 350 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment 
groups in a 2:2:1 ratio (140, 140, and 70 subjects  per group , respectively) . 
Treatment population:  Subjects with moderately to severely active RA and an inadequate response to treatment with TNF i therapy . 
Diagnosis and  
main criteria for inclusion:  Male or female subjects ≥18  years of age with diagnosis of moderately to 
severely active adult -onset RA and an inadequate response to treatment 
with TNFi  therapy . 
Test product, dose and mode of administration:  Olokizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody  specific for 
interleukin -6 (IL-6). 
Subjects randomized to receive OKZ will be administered OKZ 64  mg via 
SC injection by blinded study site staff either q2w or q4w, depending on 
the randomization group . 
Reference therapy, dose, and mode of administration:  Placebo :  The placebo will contain  no active pharmaceutical ingredients .  
Subjects  randomized to the placebo group  will be administered placebo by 
blinded study site staff via SC in jection q2w.  
To maintain the blind, subjects randomized to receive OKZ q4w will also 
receive placebo injectio ns at the alternate q4w interval (e.g., Week  2, 
Week  6, etc).  Placebo will be administered in blinded syringes with the 
same appearance as syringes containing OKZ . 
MTX :  Subjects in all 3  treatment groups  will continue their  concomitant 
background therapy (MTX) at a stable dose of 15  to 25 mg/week (or 
≥10 mg/week if there is documented intolerance to higher doses) with a 
stable route of administration (oral, SC, or intramuscular [ IM]). 
Statistical Methods: 
Calculation of Samp le Size  
Given that the study will be considered successful if at least 1  of the 2  OKZ dose regimens is shown to be 
efficacious and that a priori both OKZ dose regimens are assumed to be efficacious, disjunctive power (i.e., a 
probability of detecting a significant treatment effect for at least 1  OKZ treatment regimen)  will be used  as a 
criterion for the estimation of the sample size.  Sample size requirements are calculated to provide sufficient disjunctive power to evaluate the primary endpoint (superiorit y of OKZ relative to placebo with respect to 
ACR20  response rate at Week 12 ) and the first secondary endpoint (superiority of OKZ relative to placebo with 
respect to the proportion of subjects with DAS28 (CRP ) <3.2 at Week 12 ).  Sample size was estimated taking 
into account a multiplicity control procedure and the resulting α adjustment that will be used in this study  to 
control an overall Type  I error rate in the strong sense at a 1-sided  α = 0.025 across the primary and secondary

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  9 Confidential  endpoints.  For the firs t secondary endpoint, t he disjunctive power represents a probability of establishing a 
significant treatment effect for 1  or 2 OKZ dose regimens for the primary endpoint and a significant treatment 
effect for 1  or 2 OKZ dose regimens for the first secondar y endpoint, conditional on the fact that each dose 
regimen tested for the secondary endpoint must have the null hypothesis previously rejected for the primary 
endpoint based on a fixed order of testing as per the gate -keeping procedure.  
Treatment effect as sumptions used in the simulation -based sample size calculations involving the primary and 
the first secondary endpoints are as follows.  
The ACR20  response rate at Week 12  for the placebo group  is estimated to be 20% in this study population.  
The OKZ ACR20  response rates for the 64 mg q4w and q2w treatment groups  at Week 12  are expected to be at 
least 45% and 50% , respectively, resulting in an expected difference in ACR20  response rates of 25  and 
30 percentage points between the respective OKZ groups  and pl acebo.  
The DAS28  low disease activity (based on DAS28  [CRP] <3.2) response rate at Week 12  is estimated to be 5 % 
in the placebo group  and 18% and 21% in the OKZ 64 mg q4w and q2w treatment groups  respectively, 
resulting in an expected difference of 1 3 and 16 percentage points between respective OKZ treatment groups  
and placebo.  
The ACR20 and DAS28 response rates cited above are assumed to reflect approximately 10% of subjects 
discontinuing randomized treatment prior to Week 12 .  In this study, subjects who discontinue prior to Week 
12 will be classified as nonresponders  for the primary endpoint of ACR20 at Week 12  and for the secondary 
endpoint of DAS28 (CRP ) <3.2 at Week 12 . 
The primary endpoint as well as the secondary endpoints that are binary in nature w ill be analyzed using a 
2×2 chi-squared test for equality of proportions for each OKZ treatment group compared with placebo.   A 
continuity correction may be used if the expected cell count is <5.  
Based on the treatment effect assumptions and the methodolog y for estimating sample size via simulation to 
ensure sufficient disjunctive power as described above, a sample size of 350 subjects randomized in a 
2:2:1 ratio ( 140, 140, and 70 subjects  per group , respectively ) will yield 99% disjunctive power for testin g the 
primary hypothesis (ACR20 at Week 12 ) and 82% disjunctive power for the evaluation of the secondary 
endpoint of DAS28 (CRP) <3.2  rate at Week 12 . 
Analysis Populations  
• Intent -to-treat (ITT) population :  The ITT population will include all randomized subjects .  Subjects 
will be analyzed according to the treatment group  to which they were randomized .  The ITT 
population will be the primary analysis population.  
• Modified Intent -to-treat (mITT) population :  The mITT population will include all randomized 
subjects who receive at least 1  dose of study treatment .  Subjects will be analyzed according to the 
treatment group  to which they were randomized .  The mITT population , if sufficiently different from 
the ITT population  (>5% of ITT subjects excluded from m ITT across all treatment groups) , will be 
used for supportive analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.  
• Per Protocol (PP) population :  The PP population will include all ITT subjects who do not have any 
major protocol violations .  Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment group  to which they 
were randomized .  Major protocol violations and t he inclusion of subjects in the PP population will be 
finalized prior to study unblinding .  The PP population will be used for supportive analyses of the 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.  
• Safety population :  The Safety population will include all subjects who receive at least 1  dose of study 
treatment .  Subjects in the S afety population will be analyzed according to the treatment the y actually 
received .  In addition  to the primary safety analysis the incidence of AEs will be analyzed separately 
for subjects administered an additional disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drug ( DMARD ) as rescue 
medication during the Treatment Period  and for  subjects who did not receive rescue medication . 
• Pharmacokinetics population :  The PK population will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose 
of OKZ  and have at least 1 evaluable postdose O KZ concentration without important protocol 
deviations or events affecting the PK results .

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  10 Confidential  Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy analyses will be conducted using the ITT population .  Supportive analyses of the primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints will also be conducted using the mITT  (if sufficiently different from the ITT 
population) and PP  populations .  All comparisons for efficacy assessments up to Week 16 will be carried out 
based on study treatment groups  to which the subjects were originally randomized  at baseline .  For assessments 
at time points after Week 16, no statistical hypothesis testing will be performed and only descriptive summaries 
will be generated for treatment groups representing treatment sequences (i.e., OKZ 64 mg q4w, OKZ 64 mg q2w, placebo -  OKZ 64 mg q4w, and placebo -  OKZ 64 mg q2w).  
No adjustmen t for covariates will be included in the primary analysis of the primary endpoint or the analysis of 
the secondary and other endpoints that are binary in nature .  Analyses of the continuous efficacy endpoints will 
be adjusted for baseline values of the cor responding parameters.  
Endpoints that are binary in nature will be analyzed using a 2×2  chi-squared test for equality of proportions .  A 
continuity correction may be used with the 2×2 chi -squared test if the expected cell count is <5.  E ndpoints that 
are continuous in nature will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model and adjusted for 
the baseline value of the corresponding parameter.  
Other statistical methods and models will be used to investigate sensitivity to missing data and adheren ce to 
randomized treatment . 
Multiplicity Adjustment  
Each of the OKZ treatment groups  (64 mg q2w and 64 mg q4w) will be compared with placebo for each of the 
primary, secondary, and other endpoints  up to Week 12 .  The overall Type I error rate will be controlled for 
testing hypotheses of the primary and secondary endpoints at the overall 1 -sided  α = 0.025 . 
The α- control strategy will be based on using the Bonferroni adjustment for the tests related to each of the 
2 OKZ dose regimens versus placebo (i.e., using the 1 -sided  α = 0.0125 for each  OKZ  dose regimen) .  A 
gate-keeping strategy will be used for tests associated with the primary and secondary endpoints for each OKZ 
dose regimen independently .  In other words, ea ch OKZ dose regimen will be tested at 1 -sided  α = 0.0125 for a 
given endpoint if null hypotheses are rejected at 1-sided  α = 0.0125 for this dosing regimen for all previous 
endpoints based on the established order .  Conversely, the testing will stop for a given OKZ dose regimen at the 
endpoint for which the null hypothesis is accepted at 1 -sided  α = 0.0125.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Olokizumab concentrations  will be summarized descriptively by scheduled collection time and dose regimen .  
Time to steady state  will be graphically evaluated for the OKZ trough data collected over the study period.   
Olokizumab concentrations from placebo subjects who are randomized to receive OKZ starting at Week 16 will 
be summarized separately and will not be part of the time to  steady state evaluation.   Pharmacokinetic 
relationships will be explored graphically and with linear or non -linear modeling approaches, as appropriate.  
Data collected in this study may be combined with data from other OKZ studies in support of population  PK 
analyses . 
Safety Analysis  
Major components for the safety analysis will include:  
• AEs will be solicited at every study visit, recorded, and coded according to the most recent version of 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ). 
• SAEs  
• Vital signs and physical examination findings  
• Laboratory parameters  
• Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) and other specialized test findings  
All AEs will be analyzed in terms of descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis .  Adverse events will be listed 
for each su bject and summarized by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) according to the most 
recent  version of  the
 MedDRA .  In addition, summaries of AEs by severity and relationship to study treatment  
will be presented .  All safety and tolerability data  recorded during the study will be listed and summarized by

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  11 Confidential  treatment group /sequence , and over time, as appropriate.  
Safety results will be summarized and presented with particular focus on safety concerns identified as AESIs , 
based either upon the safety data available to date for OKZ or drug class -related events for a biologic 
IL-6 inhibitor.  
Cardiovascular Risk Assessment  
The RA population is known to have an increased risk of CV events .  To fully assess the CV risks associated 
with OKZ, the following approach  will be used : 
1. Potential major adverse cardiac events (MACE) will be adjudicated by an independent Cardiovascular 
Adjudication Committee ( CVAC ) according to a predefined charter .  The charter will define the 
criteria, data, and source documentation  required to adjudicate all MACE . 
2. Baseline CV risks including individual risk factors  (e.g., tobacco use, presence of hypertension, 
diabetes mellitus, and lipid profile ) will be assessed . 
3. Known CV risk factors will be monitored and assessed to detect any trends related to  long- term 
exposure.  
Safety Follow -up Assessments  
Given the long half -life of OKZ (approximately 31 days), all subjects will be followed up for approximately 
5 OKZ half -lives (i.e., 22  weeks) after the final dose of study treatment . 
Subjects who discontinue randomized treatment early (i.e., prior to Week 24) will adhere to the established 
double -blind Treatment Period visit schedule outlined in the study Schedule of Events, as if they were still 
receiving study treatment.  In addition, all subjects who discontinue treatment early will undergo  a full safety 
assessment at the Eo T Visit +2 weeks after the last dose of study treatment  (OKZ or placebo) , as well as 
extended Safety Follow -Up assessments +4, +8, and +22 weeks after the last dose of study treatment . 
For subjects remaining on ran domized therapy until the last scheduled dose of study treatment and not entering

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  23 Confidential  2. INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Background  
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic immune/inflammatory disease characterized by 
persistent synovitis, with synovial cell proliferatio n and destructive changes in bone and 
cartilage of multiple joints .  Untreated, RA can lead to destruction, deformation, and 
dysfunction of affected joints, which may result in significant morbidity, and accelerated mortality ( Jacobsson et al, 2007) .  Moderately to severely active RA is often treated with 
disease- modifying anti- rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), with methotrexate (MTX) being the 
most commonly used conventional DMARD (cDMARD) .  For patients  with an inadequate 
response  to cDMARDs, biologic agents (i.e., biologic DMARDs [bDMARDs]) are the next 
step, and include, but are not limited to, tumor necrosis factor -α (TNF -α) inhibitors (TNFi), 
interleukin -6 (IL -6) receptor (IL -6R) antagonists, and T -cell co -stimulation modulator s.  
Among these, TNFi, especially in combination with MTX, are used most often 
(Smolen  et al, 2014) .  Despite early treatment with cDMARD and/or bDMARD therapy, 
approximately 30% to 40% of patients  with established RA fail to respond and 50% to 60% 
of patients  fail to achieve a major clinical American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 
response or good European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response 
(Marchesoni  et al, 2009; Rubbert -Roth and Finckh, 2009; Cohen et al, 2008) .  Even among 
responders, the majority do not achieve remission.  T hus, there continues to be an unmet 
medical need for new therapeutic approaches in the RA patient population. 
One such therapeutic approach is to target  IL-6 directly instead of indirectly via a receptor 
antagonist .  Interleukin- 6 is a pleiotropic, pro- inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety 
of cell types including lymphocytes, monocytes, a nd fibroblasts .  It is involved in multiple 
immunologic processes such as T -cell activation, B -cell proliferation, initiation of 
acute- phase response, stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell growth, differentiation and 
trafficking, as well as osteoclas t differentiation , which subsequently contributes to joint 
destruction.  D ue to the key role played by IL -6 in several RA mechanisms, targeting IL -6 is 
considered an attractive therapeutic option.  
2.2 Study Treatment  
2.2.1 Olokizumab  
Olokizumab (OKZ; CDP6038; L04041) is being developed by R -Pharm for the treatment of 
moderately to severely active RA .  Olokizumab was previously developed by 
UCB  Pharma SA, and was transferred to R -Pharm for further global development.

Olokizumab  
Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  24 Confidential  Olokizumab is a humanized (complementarity determining region [CDR] -grafted) 
monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) of immunoglobulin (Ig) G4/kappa isotype, developed as an 
antagonist of IL -6 that is anticipated to have utility in a wide range of 
autoimmune/inflammatory conditions.  
Interleukin- 6 is a multifunctional cytokine that has been shown to play a central role in 
immune regulation, inflammation, hemopoiesis, and oncogenesis, and has been linked to a 
wide range of human diseases .  It is a glycoprotein of 184 amino acids that is produced by a 
wide range of cell types including monocytes/macrophages, fibroblasts, epidermal 
keratinocytes, vascular endothelial cells, renal mesangial cells, glial cells, chondrocytes, 
T and B cells, and some tumor cells .  Stimuli of IL -6 production include TNF -α, 
lipopolysacchari des, and viral infections; inhibitors of IL -6 production include 
glucocorticoids .  Within the context of an immune and inflammatory response, IL -6 has been 
shown to exert a wide range of effects, such as those described below:  
• Induction of antibody product ion by B cells  
• Important role in the generation of a subpopulation of T -helper cells, Th17 cells, which 
may play an important pathogenic role in a number of autoimmune diseases  
• Key driver of the acute phase response (the increased production, mainly by the  liver, of 
soluble factors, such as C -reactive protein [CRP] and serum amyloid A [SAA], during 
inflammation)  
In developing an antagonist mAb  to IL -6, potential therapeutic strategies include inhibition 
of nonsignaling IL-6R receptor alpha chain (gp80), which gives the IL -6 family members 
their specificity, and the IL-6R signal -transducing subunit (gp130) .  The identification of the 
optimum epitope to target on IL -6 (binding IL -6 in a region that is predicted to be involved 
with gp80 or gp130) was conducted using antibodies with similar affinities , but different 
binding axes, as determined by surface plasmon resonance ( BIAcore ).  Antibodies directed 
against mouse or human IL -6 that targeted the gp130 axis were more potent than  those that 
targeted the gp80 axis in inhibiting IL -6-dependent phosphorylation of signal transducer and 
activator of transcription  3 in in  vitro cell based assays and in inhibiting the secretion of the 
acute phase protein SAA in  vivo.  O lokizumab binds to a region of IL -6 involved with 
gp130 binding .  The epitope recognized by OKZ was initially established by BIAcore and 
confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance studies .  Olokizumab has been shown to have a 
high affinity for human IL -6 as determined using  BIAcore analysis .  In vitro whole blood and 
cell line assays as well as animal studies have shown that OKZ potently neutralizes IL-6-mediated effects in vitro and in vivo, respectively .  Data suggest that OKZ neither 
significantly binds to nor affects the  function of other IL -6 family members, nor does it 
appear to activate the IL -6 signaling pathway under a range of conditions tested.

Olokizumab  
Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  25 Confidential  Currently, patients  with moderately to severely active RA are often treated with c DMARDs , 
with MTX being the most commonly  used.  For patients with an inadequate response to 
cDMARDs, biologic agents that  inhibit TNF -α, especially in combination with MTX, are 
indicated ( Smolen et al, 2014).  Nonetheless, a substantial proportion of patients receiving 
biologics (i .e., approximately 40% to 50% of those receiving TNFi therapy ) have inadequate 
response to such treatment ( Marchesoni et al, 2009; Rubbert -Roth and Finckh, 2009; 
Cohen et  al, 2008).  Thus , there is an unmet need for new therapeutic approaches utilizing 
alternative modes of action in this patient population. 
Olokizumab is being developed to address the unmet needs of patients with these se vere, 
progressive, and debilitating disorders through a different therapeutic approach, utilizing an 
alternative mode of action .  Within the class of therapeutic antibodies targeting the 
IL-6 pathway, OKZ is anticipated to be more potent because of its hig h affinity for IL -6 and 
its axis of intervention (inhibiting the interaction between IL -6 and gp130) .  Also, since OKZ 
is of the Ig G4 isotype, it would not be expected to mediate significant levels of antibody -mediated complement fixation or cell- mediated  cytotoxicity.  
Olokizumab is being developed for the treatment of RA to reduce signs and symptoms of disease, improve physical functioning, and induce higher levels of response .  The proposed 
indication for OKZ is to be used in combination with MTX for the  treatment of moderately to 
severely active RA in adult patients who have been inadequately controlled by previous TNFi treatment.   A separate study is planned to address the use of OKZ in a similar RA 
population who are inadequately controlled by MTX trea tment.  
Refer to the most recent version of the Investigator’s Brochure  for additional information on 
OKZ including:  
• In vitro activity  
• Nonclinical pharmacokinetics (PK) and product metabolism  
• Nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology  
• PK, efficacy, and safety profile in clinical studies  
2.2.2 Nonclinical Development  
Nonclinical studies have shown that inhibition of IL -6 signaling  does not result in any 
life-threatening effects either in animal models or formal toxicology studies.  There is no 
evidence from in vitro a nd in vivo nonclinical data to suggest that there is a risk of OKZ 
inducing an uncontrolled biological cascade.  All nonclinical data generated to date are consistent with OKZ functioning as an effective antagonist of the IL-6 pathway.  Cellular

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  26 Confidential  in vitro assay data suggest that OKZ neutralizes  the biological effects of IL-6 in both humans 
and cynomolgus monkeys with similar potency.  Therefore , the cynomolgus monkey is 
considered an appropriate species to evaluate the potential toxicity of OKZ.  Due to the  lack 
of activity of OKZ on IL-6 in rats and mice, the toxicology program was restricted to using a 
single non- rodent species, the cynomolgus monkey.  
Olokizumab is well tolerated in the cynomolgus monkey, with a no observed adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) of 200 mg/kg/week and 50 mg/kg/week after intravenous ( IV) and 
subcutaneous ( SC) administration , respectively . 
In a study aimed at assessing the effects of OKZ  on prenatal and postnatal development in 
the cynomolgus monkey, the treatment was well tolerated du ring the pregnancy  and had no 
abortifacient effect .  However, some OKZ -treated females experienced dystocia and 
placental retention, sometimes associated with significant urogenital bleeding, which resulted in some deaths.  Given similar human and cynomolg us monkey physiology during pregnancy 
and the risk of dystocia and hemorrhage at parturition, inhibition of IL -6 signaling during 
pregnancy is not recommended.  
Taken together, the currently completed nonclinical studies support continued clinical 
developme nt for marketing approval of OKZ.  
2.2.3 Summary of Clinical Experience  
Nonclinical data were deemed sufficient to support clinical development of OKZ in humans 
for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA (lead indication), other auto -immune 
inflammatory diseases, and oncological diseases with IL -6 pathophysiology.  
The safety, efficacy, and PK of OKZ have been investigated in 3  Phase I clinical studies 
(RA0001, RA0010, and RA0074) and 2 Phase II clinical studies (RA0056 and RA0083) .  
The s afety and efficacy of OKZ were also studied in long -term open -label extension (OLE) 
studies for both Phase II studies (RA0057 and RA0089). 
The information in this section of the protocol regarding clinical studies with OKZ  is current 
as of 29 January 2016 (for  updated information on results of clinical studies , refer to the most 
recent version of the Investigator’s Brochure ).

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  28 Confidential  2.2.3.2 Summary of Safety Data from Olokizumab Studies  
Study RA0001 
There were no deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs) reported during the study and no 
subject discontinued the study as a result of an adverse event (AE) .  The overall incidence of 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was slightly higher in the placebo group overall 
(18 subjects [52.9%]; 35 events) than in the OKZ treatment groups overall (11 subjects 
[33.3%]; 26 events) .  No increase in the incidence of TEAEs was observed with increasing 
dose of OKZ.  
The most commonly  reported TEAEs were in the system organ classes (SOCs ) of 
gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, general disorders, and infections and infestations .  The 
incidence of GI disorders was similar in both the OKZ group overall (12.1%) and the placebo group overall (11.8%); however, at the preferred term (PT) level, abdominal distension (1 subject [3.0%]), abdominal pain (1 subject [3.0%]), and vomiting (2 subjects [6.1%]) were 
only seen in the OKZ group.  T he most frequently reported TEAEs (occurring in ≥ 3% of 
subjects in any treatment group) by PT were influenza -like illness (11.8% placebo, 
6.1%  OKZ), headache (11.8% placebo, 3.0%  OKZ), nasopharyngitis (8.8% placebo, 
3.0%  OKZ), rhinitis (8.8% placebo, 0.0% OKZ), diarrhea (5.9% placebo, 3.0% OKZ), and 
vomiting (0.0% placebo, 6.1% OKZ).  
For the majority of hematology  and clinical chemistry parameters there were no clinically 
significant differences in mean actual values between the placebo group and OKZ treatment  
groups, and no clinically significant fluctuations in mean actual values over time. 
Study RA0010 
There were no deaths during Study RA0010.  T wo subjects (1  subject in the placebo 
IV+MTX group and 1 subject in the OKZ 1  mg/kg SC+MTX group) experienced SAEs :  
Bowen ’s disease and worsening of RA, respectively .  Neither event was considered by the 
Investigator to be related to the study treatment.  O ne subject in the placebo+MTX overall 
group withdrew from the study as a result of exacerbation of their RA .  All subjects (100%) 
in the placebo+MTX overall group and 96.7% of subjects in the OKZ+MTX overall group 
experienced at least 1  TEAE .  The incidence of TEAEs did not increase with increasing dose 
of OKZ+MTX administered ; although, a slightly higher number of AEs were experienced by 
subjects in the OKZ  (1 mg/kg and  3 mg/kg) +MTX SC treatment groups 
(16 subjects  [94.12%]; 101 events) compared with the OKZ  (0.1 mg/kg and 1  mg/kg)  + MTX 
IV treatment groups (13 subjects [100%]; 54 events).

In Study RA0074, there were no deaths, SAEs, severe AEs, or AEs that led to 
discontinuation.  T he incidence of TEAEs was higher in the OKZ groups compared with the 
placebo group.  In the placebo group, 50% of subjects (2 of 4) had TEAEs (6  events), 
compared with 75% of subjects (3 of 4) in the OKZ 3 mg/kg treatment group (1 1 events), and 
100% of subjects (4 of 4) in each of the OKZ 0.3 mg/kg (16  events), OKZ 1  mg/kg 
(25 events), and OKZ 6 mg/kg (24  events) treatment groups .  The incidence of TEAEs did 
not appear to be related to the dose of OKZ administered.  
The most commonl y reported TEAEs were within the SOCs of general disorders and 
administration site conditions ; investigations ; GI disorders ; infections and infestations ; 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders ; and skin and SC  tissue disorders .  Events 
occurring in >20% of subjects in the OKZ overall group, by PT, included injection site 
hematoma (31.3%), abdominal pain (25.0%), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased 
(25.0%) .  The overall incidence of TEAEs in the OKZ -treated groups was higher than in the 
placebo -treated group, but given the small number of subjects in each treatment group, it is 
not possible to make any meaningful conclusions.  
In Studies  RA0001, RA0010, and RA0074, OKZ was tolerated at doses of up to 3 mg/kg SC 
(all studies), 6  mg/kg SC ( Study RA0074 only), and 10 mg/kg IV ( Study RA0001 only) .  
There were no deaths in any of these studies and only 2 SAEs in Study RA0010.  O ne subject 
in Study RA0010 discontinued the study early due to an AE (exacerbation of RA symptoms), but no subjects withdrew from Study RA0001 or Study RA0074 due to TEAEs. 
Study RA0056 
In Study RA0056, OKZ was well tolerated at doses of up to 240 mg q2w .  Serious AEs were 
reported by 6 subjects in the OKZ groups and 3 subjects in the placebo groups .  A total of 
11 subjects in the OKZ and placebo groups discontinued due to TEAEs (10  subjects in the 
OKZ group and 1 subject in the placebo group ).  Overall, 10 subjects in the OKZ groups 
reported 13 TEAEs leading to discontinuation, with the most subjects discontinuing due to 
TEA Es in the OKZ 60 mg q4w group (5 subjects [22.7%] compared with 2 subjects [10%] in 
the OKZ 60 mg q2w group, 1 subject [4.5%] in the OKZ 120 mg q2w group, and 2 subjects 
[8.7%] in the OKZ 240 mg q2w group) .  One subject (4.5%) in the placebo q2w group also 
discontinued due to TEAEs .  No TEAE PT leading to discontinuation was reported by more 
than 1 subject in any treatment group.  
Treatment -emergent AEs were reported by 17  subjects (77.3%) in the placebo q4w group, 
19 subjects (86.4%) in the placebo q2w group, 18 subjects (81.8%) in the OKZ 60 mg

The majority of these TEAEs were reported during the T reatment P eriod.  
The most commonly reported TEAEs (>10% of subjects in any treatment group) in the 
OKZ  q4w, OKZ q2w, and placebo groups were in the SOCs of GI disorders, gene ral 
disorders and administration site conditions, infections and infestations, investigations, and 
nervous system disorders. 
The TEAEs that  occurred with the greatest incidence (i.e., occurring in ≥ 10% of subjects) in 
any OKZ treatment group included:   diarrhea, injection site reaction, injection site pruritus, 
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, ALT increased, 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, and liver function test (LFT) abnormal.  
When considering TEAEs by grade according to the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), the majority of subjects in all treatment groups ( ≥59.1%) had 
CTCAE Grade  1 TEAEs .  The CTCAE Grade 3 TEAEs included head injury, anemia, chest 
pain, basal cell carcinoma, in jection site reaction, contusion, abscess limb, laceration, 
musculoskeletal pain, mania, breast discharge, breast swelling, erythema, pruritus, 
osteoarthritis, ligament sprain, back pain, cellulitis, and spinal cord compression.  N o 
CTCAE Grade  3 TEAE was reported by more than 1 subject .  Of the CTCAE 
Grade 3 TEAEs, all were reported during the Treatment P eriod, with the exception of 
1 subject in the OKZ 60 mg q4w (4.5%) group who reported CTCAE Grade  3 TEAEs during 
the Safety Follow -Up Period .  No CTCAE Grade 4 or 5  TEAEs were observed in any 
treatment group .  There were no deaths reported in Study RA0056.  Overall, 6  subjects in the 
OKZ groups reported 7 SAEs (3  subjects [15.0%] reporting 3 events in the OKZ 60 mg q2w 
group [chest pain, basal cell carcin oma, and mania], 1 subject [4.5%] reporting 1 event in the 
OKZ 60  mg q4w group [LFT abnormal], and 2 subjects [9.1%] reporting 3  events in the 
OKZ 240 mg q4w group [pneumonia, perineal abscess, and back pain]) .  No subjects in the 
OKZ 120 mg q2w or q4w groups or in the OKZ 240 mg q2w group experienced SAEs .  A 
total of 3  subjects in the placebo treatment groups reported 3 SAEs (2  subjects [9.1%] 
reporting 2  events in the placebo q2w group and 1  subject [4.5%] reporting 1 event in the 
placebo q4w group).  
Of the SAEs reported in the OKZ groups, only LFT abnormal (1 subject [4.5%] in the OKZ 60 mg q4w group) was judged to be related to the study treatment by the Investigator .  
Additionally, only the SAEs of LFT abnormal (1 subject [4.5%] in the OKZ 60 mg q4w 
group), and chest pain (1 subject [5.0%] in the OKZ 60 mg q2w group), led to 
discontinuation from the study .  All of the SAEs were reported as recovered/resolved with

Overall, 33 subjects reported 321 TEAEs leading to discontinuation during the study .  The 
most common TEAE PT  leading to discontinuation was upper respiratory tract infection 
(8 subjects [4.2%]). 
Three additional subjects experienced TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of OKZ  
(bladder cancer, palmar pustular dermatitis, and cholecystitis chronic) .  These subjects were 
not represented within the patient data sets or tables as this additional information was based 
on source documentation received from the respe ctive study  sites after the clinical datab ase 
had been locked.  
Treatment -emergent AEs were reported by 178 subjects ( 93.7%).  T he most commonly 
reported TEAEs (>10% of subjects) were in the SOCs of infections and infestations; musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders; GI disorders; investigations; general 
disorders and administration site conditions; respiratory, thoracic a nd mediastinal disorders; 
skin and SC  tissue disorders; injury, poisoning and procedural complications; nervous system 
disorders; metabolism and nutrition disorders; and vascular disorders.  
When considering TEAEs by CTCAE grade, the majority of subjects had CTCAE Grade 1 (85.8%) and/or Grade 2  (56.3%) TEAEs.  At the SOC level, infections and 
infestations was the TEAE that occurred most frequently  (68.4% of subjects ), with a 
maximum intensity of mild (102  subjects  [53.7%] ; 239 events), moderate (58  subject s 
[30.5%]; 103 events), and  severe (14  subjects [7.4%]; 17 events) .  At the PT  level, CTCAE 
Grade 3  TEAEs that occurred in ≥2 subjects included cellulitis, pneumonia, staphylococcal 
infection, urinary tract infection, back pain, RA , pulmonary embolism, and chest pain .  No 
CTCAE  Grade 3  TEAE was reported by more than 3 subjects  for any PT .  A total of 
93 subjects ( 48.9%) reported TEAEs (281 events) that  were judged as related to the study 
treatment  by the Investigator .  The TEAE most frequently assessed as being drug- related by 
the Investigator was injection site reaction SOC (21  subjects [11.1%] ; 29 events ). 
There were 2  deaths reported in Study RA0057.  The first subject experienced the 
treatment -emergent SAE of a road traffic accident, reported as severe and considered not 
related to the study treatment.  The second subject had multiple co- morbidities and 
experienced necrotizing fasciitis, acute renal failure, multi -system organ failure, and sepsis 
after approximately 9 months of exposure to OKZ .  Two mont hs prior to death, OKZ  was 
discontinued as the subject was lost to follow -up.  The Investigator and Sponsor judged that  
necrotizing fasciitis and sepsis  were related to the study treatment, and that  acute renal failure 
and multi -system organ failure  were n ot related to the study treatment.

5 subjects in the OKZ treatment groups reported a total of 9 TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation.  D iscontinuations due to TEAEs were reported by very few subjects in any 
4-week cumulative dose group:   2 subjects each in the placebo, OKZ 60 mg, and OKZ

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  33 Confidential  The incidence of TEAEs of hepatic function abnormal and nasopharyngitis increased with 
higher cumulative doses of OKZ.  
When considering TEAEs by CTCAE grade, there were no Grade  4 or 5  TEAEs.  
The majority of subjects across all 4 -week cumulative dose groups ( ≥56.3%) had CTCAE 
Grade 1 TEAEs .  Three subjects reported Grade 3 TEAEs :  1 subject in the OKZ 120 mg 
4-week cumulative dose group reported face edema and 2 subjects in the placebo group 
reported exacerbation of RA.  
Treatment -emergent AEs considered related to the study treatment by the Investigator were 
reported at a higher incidence across the OKZ 4 -week cumulative dose groups compared 
with the placebo group.  The overall incidence of drug- related TEAEs was highest in the 
OKZ 60  mg 4 -week cumulative dose group.  T he most commonly reported individual 
drug- related TEAEs were nasopharyngitis, stomatitis , injection site erythema, rash, and 
headache.  T he incidences of drug -related TEAEs of injection site erythema, injection site 
swelling, and nasopharyngitis were highest in the OKZ 240 mg 4 -week cumulative dose 
group.  T here wer e no deaths reported in any treatment group during Study RA0083.  S erious 
TEAEs were reported by 2  subjects (6.9%) in the placebo group (RA in both subjects; both 
events led to study discontinuation and were considered resolved after 44 days) and 1 subject  
each (3.1% and 3.8%) in the OKZ 60 and 240 mg 4 -week cumulative dose groups (cellulitis 
and pneumonia, respectively) .  No SAEs were reported by subjects in the OKZ 120 mg 
4-week cumulative dose group.  Both the cellulitis and pneumonia SAEs in subjects 
receiving OKZ were reported as moderate in intensity and not related to the study treatment.  
The cellulitis event led to study discontinuation and resolved after 11 days .  The pneumonia 
event required hospitalization, but the subject continued in the study and the event resolved 
after 57  days.

A total of 14 subjects (13.6%) reported 20 SAEs.  The highest incidence of events was 
observed for the infections and infestations SOC ( 7 subjects [ 6.8%]).  At the PT  level, 
cellulitis occurred with the highest frequency (2  subjects [1.9%]; 2 events).  No other PT  was 
reported more than once.

(1 subject each) were judged to be r elated to the study treatment by both the Investigator and 
Sponsor. 
One SAE (infectious pleural effusion) was judged to be related to the study treatment by the 
Investigator, but not related by the Sponsor. 
There was 1  subject who reported an SAE of pulmonary TB  that was considered by the 
Investigator to be related to OKZ .  The subject had no history of active or latent TB , chronic 
productive cough, persistent fever, persistent asthenia, human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) 
infection, or organ transplants.  C hest imaging revealed increased infiltration of bilateral lung 
fields, borderline heart size, and calcified lesion over the left aspect of the upper 
mediastinum.  C hest X -ray and bronchial culture were positive for TB , and the diagnosis was 
confirmed by ac id fast bacillus stain.  The subject was treated with 250 mg tranexamic acid 
4 times per day /capsule, rifampin 5 tablets daily, and ethambutol 800 mg daily for TB .  There 
was no action taken with OKZ  due to the event , as the event was confirmed during the 
follow -up period of the study, after the last dose of study treatment had been administered.  
The subject completed the entire anti -TB treatment course, and the event resolved.  The 
Investigator and the Sponsor asses sed the event to be related to OKZ .

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  35 Confidential  2.2.3.3 Summary of Efficacy Data from Olokizumab Studies  
Study RA0010 
Preliminary efficacy data in terms of the Disease Activity Score 28 -joint Count 
(DAS28 ) (CRP) were obtained in Study RA0010.  An indication of the efficacy of  OKZ was 
obtained in the subpopulation of subjects with a baseline DAS28 (CRP) of >3.2 (i.e., those 
with moderate to high disease activity) .  Although the number of subjects falling into this 
moderate to high category was small, improvements in DAS28 (CRP)  were seen following 
OKZ+MTX administration, especially in the OKZ 1  mg/kg SC+MTX group.  
Study RA0056 
In Study RA0056, a greater improvement in least squares (LS) mean DAS28 (CRP) from 
baseline at Week  12 was observed across all OKZ treatment  groups compared with the 
placebo groups, with the greatest improvement observed in the OKZ 240 mg q2w group.  
The overall dose -response trend (across the q4w and q2w dosing frequencies) was 
statistically significant (p<0.0001) .  Comparisons of dosing frequency (q2w versus q4w) and 
dose-by-dose frequency interactions (q2w trend versus q4w trend) were not statistically 
significant.  T he secondary efficacy variables were ACR  20% (ACR20), 50% (ACR50), and 
70% (ACR70) response criteria at Week  12 for the OKZ and placeb o treatment groups .  The 
ACR20  and ACR50 estimated response rates at Week  12 were higher in all OKZ treatment  
groups compared with the placebo groups .  Very few subjects in any treatment group were 
ACR70  responders; however, those subjects that were ACR70 responders were all in the 
OKZ treatment groups.  
Study RA0083 
In Study RA0083, a greater improvement in LS mean change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) 
at Week  12 was observed across all OKZ 4 -week cumulative dose groups compared with the 
placebo group, with the greatest improvement observed in the OKZ 240 mg 4 -week 
cumulative dose group.  The overall dose -response trend (for the 4- week cumulative dose) 
was statistically significant (p<0.0001), as were the differences between each treatment  
group versus placebo (p<0.0001 for each treatment group) .  The comparisons of dosing 
frequency (OKZ  120 mg group [60 mg q2w versus 120 mg q4w] and OKZ 240 mg [120 mg 
q2w versus 240 mg q4w]), dosing frequency effect (q4w versus q2w dose frequency), and dose frequency interact ions (individual doses by dose frequency interaction) were not 
statistically significant.  The ACR20 and ACR50 estimated response rates at Week  12 were 
higher in all OKZ 4 -week cumulative dose groups compared with the placebo group.  T he 
overall dose -response trend at Week  12 was statistically significant, as were all treatment

 Study RA0057 
Study RA0057 was designed to collect safety data and had no primary efficacy endpoints ; 
however, some trends could be identified.  A ll treatment groups described in 
Study  RA0057 belong to Study RA0056, from which the subjects were transferred to a single 
treatment group of 120 mg q2w in Study RA0057.  The change in DAS28 (CRP) was 
summarized at Weeks  12, 24, and 48 relative to baseline (Week  0) in Study RA0056 and 
baseline in Study RA0057.  Relative to the Study RA0057 baseline, all treatment groups 
(excep t OKZ  60 mg q4w group at Week 12) showed a further decrease in DAS28 (CRP) at 
Week s 12, 24, and 48.  Subjects  switching from the placebo group in Study RA0056 to 
treatment w ith OKZ 120 mg q2w in Study RA0057 showed a marked improvement in 
DAS28  (CRP), simi lar to the improvement shown by subjects in the OKZ  groups in the 
parent RA0056 study .  The ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response criteria were summarized 
at Week s 0, 12, 24, and 48.  Relative to the Study RA0056 baseline, a  clinically relevant 
proportion of subjects achieved  ACR20  at Week  24 across all the treatment groups, ranging 
from 30 .0% of subjects in the OKZ  240 mg  q4w group to 66.7% of subjects in the OKZ  
240 mg q2w group.  Fewer subjects achieved  ACR50  at Week  24, ranging from 11.8% to 
43.8% of subjects.  Very few subjects achieved  ACR70  at Week  24, ranging from 0% to 25% 
of subjects.  
Study RA00 89 
All treatment groups described in Study RA0089 belong to Study RA0083, from which the 
subjects were tr ansferred to a single treatment group of 120 mg q2w in Study RA0089.  The 
baseline values in Study  RA0089 corresponded to the baseline values from Study  RA0083, 
and the Week  0 values in Study RA0089 corresponded to the Week 12 values from 
Study  RA0083.  Th e change in DAS28  (CRP) was summarized at Weeks 12, 24, and 
48 relative to baseline (Week  0) in Study RA0083 and baseline in Study RA0089.  Relative 
to the Study RA0089 baseline, all treatment groups showed a notable decrease in 
DAS28  (CRP) at Week s 12, 24, and 48.  Subjects assigned to placebo in 
Study  RA0083 showed marked improvements in all parameters of disease activity after they 
began therapy with OKZ  in Study  RA0089, with an improvement in DAS28 (CRP) similar to 
the improvement shown by subjects in the OKZ  groups in the parent RA0083 study .  The 
ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response criteria were summarized at Week s 0, 12, 24, and 48.  
Relative to the Study RA0083 baseline, a  clinically relevant propor tion of subjects achieved  
ACR20  at Week  24 across all the treatment groups, ranging from 46.7% of subjects in the

2.2.3.4 Summary of Pharmacokinetic  Data from Olokizumab Studies  
Studies RA0001, RA0010, and RA0056 
Single dose PK of OKZ were studied in Studies RA0001 (healthy non- Asian), 
RA0074 (healthy Japanese), and RA0010 (subjects with RA) .  Sparse sampling following 
repeated administration of OKZ was performed in non-Asian and Asian subjects with RA in 
Studies RA0056 and RA0083, respectively .  Expos ure to OKZ following single dose 
administration appeared to be similar in non- Asian and Asian volunteers .  Following SC 
administration, maximum plasma concentrations were generally reached between 
approximately 4  days (in Study RA0074, 6 mg/kg SC) and 14 days (in Study RA0001, 
1 mg/kg SC) .  Over the 0.3 to 6 mg/kg SC dose range evaluated in Studies RA0001 and 
RA0074, the median terminal half -life ranged from 30.1 to 39.6 days .  The PK profile of 
OKZ in Study RA0010 (non- Asian RA volunteers) was similar to that seen in healthy 
volunteers in Study RA0001 for the same doses .  The maximum concentration of OKZ 
following SC administration was achieved within a median of 7  to 13 days following 
3 mg/kg and 1  mg/kg dosing, respect ively .  The estimate of terminal half -life across doses 
and routes of administration was 31 days (median range:   12 to 63 days).  
Pharmacokinetic bioavailability of OKZ via SC administration was estimated to be 63% across the 3  studies evaluated ( Studies RA 0001, RA0010, and RA0056) .  Population PK 
analysis utilizing sparse plasma concentration versus time data collected in RA0056  along 
with intense PK data collected in Studies RA0001 and RA0010 indicated similar PK characteristics of OKZ in subjects with mod erately to severely active RA and in healthy 
subjects .  Body weight was found to be the only “statistically significant” covariate on 
volume of distribution.  
2.2.4 Rationale for Dose Selection  
The dose regimens of OKZ to be evaluated in this Phase III study are 64 mg q2w and 64 mg q4w.  The rationale for selecting these dose regimens for further investigation is provided 
below. 
In the Phase II studies , RA0056 and RA0083, the primary efficacy variable was met in all 
OKZ treatment groups, demonstrating improvement compared with placebo groups and a 
statistically significant overall dose -response trend as evidenced by the change from baseline 
in DAS28 (CRP ).  Study RA0001 demonstrated that OKZ was pharmacologically active at 
all doses tested .  This finding was supported by the PD and clinical findings of the 
R-Pharm  
CL04041025:  Clinical Rheumatoid Arthritis Development for Olokizumab (CREDO) 3  
Olokizumab  
Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  38 Confidential  subsequent Phase I/IIa study , RA0010, conducted in subjects with mild to moderate RA .  The 
data from  these studies highlight the potency of OKZ as well as the existence of 
dose-response dependence, shown by the results of the concentration effect relationship 
evaluation for efficacy outcomes .  The relatively flat concentration -effect relationship for 
safety outcomes and the dose -dependent occurrence of injection site reactions for the 
OKZ  240 mg dose regimen, in contrast to the modest efficacy gains versus the 120 mg dose 
regimens, led to the exclusion of the 240 mg dose regimen from further evaluation in the 
Phase III program .  This decision was further supported by the inconvenience of 
administering 2 injections of 120 mg OKZ in order to achieve the 240 mg dose level even 
with the new 160 mg/m L formulation . 
In a thorough dose -response analysis using the combined database from the 2 Phase II 
studies, it was confirmed that a plateau of efficacy was reached at a cumulative monthly dose of 120 mg .  The 60  mg monthly dose seemed to have slightly lower efficacy in the modeling 
analysis ; however , in both Phase II studies that were conducted in relatively difficult to treat 
population of subjects  resistant to 1 or more TNFi biologics, the 60 mg monthly treatment  
groups showed statistically significant efficacy .  While there was not a detectable inc rease in 
safety events observed with doses above 120 mg monthly, there also did not seem to be a 
substantial gain in efficacy with higher doses .  Thus, the 120 mg monthly dose, administered 
as either 60  mg q2w  or 120 mg q4w , seemed to be associated with optimal efficacy/safety 
ratio.  The lower 60 mg monthly dose was also efficacious with a potential for a safety 
advantage, especially over the long -term treatment.  
Due to an increase in the concentration of the formulation subsequent to Phase II, it should be noted that the lowest volume that  can be used in Phase III (0.4 mL) results in a nominal 
dose of 64 mg rather than 60 mg . 
Consequently, using the primary efficacy outcomes from individual Phase II studies, and additional dose -response analysis performed on a combined database derived from these 
studies, 2 OKZ dose regimens were selected for further investigation :  64 mg SC q2w and 
64 mg SC q4w since totality of the data strongly suggested that both of these dose regimens could potentially be successful in a large Phase III program.  
2.3 Rationale for the Study  
The double -blind, randomized, parallel -group, placebo -controlled design  used in this study is 
consistent with the precedent set for  Phase III trials of other biologics and is in accordance  
with health aut hority guidelines . 
The goal of this Phase III study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of  OKZ in 
subjects with moderately to severely active RA who have responded inadequately to TNFi

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  39 Confidential  therapy .  The primary endpoint of the trial is at Week 12.  Olokizumab is expected to reduce 
the disease activity and induce an improvement in physical function.  T he study is  expected 
to provide safety information in a large group of subjects  over at least a 24- week period. 
Due to the nature of RA and the outcome measures used (ACR response and DAS), a 
placebo group is necessary to obtain a reliable assessment of efficacy.  The inclusion of a placebo group and the duration of placebo treatment  are in accordance with health au thority 
guidelines.  Due to the availability of multiple treatment options for RA,  all subjects 
identified as nonresponder s at Week 14, including those receiving  placebo , will receive 
rescue medication starting  at or as close as possible to Week 1 4 (see Se ction 6.13.3).  In 
addition, all subjects receiving placebo will be randomized to receive active treatment (OKZ  64 mg q2w or OKZ 64 mg q4w) starting at Week 16 and continuing for the remainder 
of the double -blind Treatment Period.  The inclusion of a control group with non- active 
treatment (placebo) is also justified because subjects will continue to receive their prior background therapy (MTX) during the study.  Up to 30% of placebo  subjects may still 
continue to demonstrate increasing therapeutic benefit over 6 months of MTX therapy at the 
same dose ( Keystone et al, 2004).  
2.4 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Olokizumab has undergone extensive nonclinical testing , and 7 clinical studie s have been 
completed.   In the difficult -to-treat population of RA patients who previously failed TNFi 
therapy, OKZ has demonstrated efficacy in 2 Phase II stud ies (Study RA0056 [ extended with 
Study RA0057]  in 221 subjects and Study RA0083 [ extended with Study RA0089]  in 
119 Asian subjects)  using the doses of OKZ that are proposed for this Phase III study; at 
higher doses, the safety profile was similar .  Bioavailability of OKZ via SC administration 
was estimated to be 63% across 3  studies evaluated (RA0056, RA0001, and RA0010) . 
The clinical program to date suggests that OKZ is effective in reducing disease symptoms in subjects with RA, and that OKZ is generally well tolerated (f or further efficacy and safety 
information , refer to the most recent version of  the Investigator’s Brochure ).  The safety 
profile of OKZ is consistent with the known effects of IL -6 blockers.  Overall, the 
benefit/risk profile for subjects in the proposed study is favorable.  The study will provide  
valuable information on the efficac y, safety, tolerability , and PK  of OKZ in subjects with 
RA, which may subsequently help to address  the unmet medical needs for this patient 
population. 
The design of this study contains adequate measures to mitigate risk factors and adequate 
safety monitor ing to protect the subjects.  Nonresponders at Week 14, defined as all subjects 
who do not improve by at least 20% in both swollen joint counts (SJC) and tender joint 
counts (TJC)  (66-68 joint  assessment ), will receive rescue medication (sulfasalazine and/or

Week  14.  In addition, all subjects in the placebo group will be randomized in a blinded 
fashion to receive OKZ starting at Week 16 and conti nuing for the remainder of the double -
blind Treatment Period.  In the context of the progressive, severe, and debilitating nature of 
RA, the balance between risks that have been identified from cumulative safety data for OKZ and the anticipated efficacy/be nefit remains favorable.

endpoints  
• Characterizing the dose/exposure -response relationships related to safety endpoints 
(e.g.,  lipids and neutrophils) and identifying potential factors that may impact the safety 
endpoints  
• Evaluating the impact of ADAs on subject safety, efficacy, and PK of OKZ  
4.6 Exploratory Endpoints  
• Exploratory pharmacogenetic (PG) assessments (in subjects who sign the separate PG 
informed consent form [ ICF] only) to examine whether individual genetic variation in 
genes relating to drug metabolism, RA, and the drug target pathway confers a differential 
response to OKZ.  
• Exploratory biomarker assessments aiming to identify potential markers that are associated with treatment response to OKZ, correlated with the s everity or progression of 
RA, or are cardiovascular (CV) surrogate biomarkers.  
4.7 Safety Endpoints  
The safety of OKZ will be assessed by:  
• The nature, incidence, severity, and outcome of AEs, including SAEs and adverse events of special interest (AESIs)  
• Proportions of subjects with AEs, SAEs, and clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities  
• Assessment of changes over time in clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, and 
physical examination findings

5.1 Summary of Study Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo- controlled, multicenter 
Phase III study that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of OKZ in subjects with moderately 
to severely active RA inadequately controlled by TNFi therapy.  
Inadequate response to TNFi  therapy is defined as a subject with at least 12  weeks of therapy  
prior to Screening  with ≥1 licensed TNFi, and is classified as either:  
• Primary failure (the absence of any documented clinically significant response); or  
• Secondary failure (documented initial clinical response with subsequent loss of that 
response or partial response)  
This study will be conducted at approximately 180 global sit es across Russia, Turkey, the 
US, the EU, Asia, and Latin America.  A total of 350 subjects will be randomized . 
Subjects will be assessed for eligibility to enter the study during a 4 -week Screening  Period .  
Eligible subjects will be randomized at Visit 2 in a  2:2:1 ratio (140, 140, and 70 subjects  per 
group, respectively)  to 1 of 2 dosing frequencies (q 2w or q4w) of 64 mg OKZ , or to placebo 
as described in Section 5.2.  T he study will consist of a 24- week double -blind T reatment 
Period .  All subjects in the placebo group will be  randomized in a blinded fashion to receive 
either OKZ 64 mg q2w or OKZ 64 mg q4w starting at Week 16 and continuing for the 
remainder of the double -blind Treatment Period.  T he last dose of OKZ  will be  administered 
at Week  20 for subjects receiving OKZ 64 mg q4w and at  Week  22 for subjects receiving 
OKZ 64 mg q2w .  After completion of the double -blind T reatment P eriod , subjects will be 
offered the opportunity to enter the long -term OLE study.   Subjects who do not consent  to 
participate in the OLE study will come to the End  of Treatment (EoT) V isit (Visit 15, 
Week  24) 2 weeks after the last dose of the study treatment  for scheduled assessments.  After 
the EoT V isit, these subjects will be scheduled for Safety Follow -Up Visit SFU -1 (Week  26), 
Visit SFU -2 (Week  30), and Visit SFU -3 (Week  44) to perform adequate safety assessments .  
For subjects not entering the  OLE , the total amount of time to complete the study will be 
approximately 48 weeks (inclusive of the Screening , Treatment, and Safety Follow -Up 
Periods ). 
Subjects who discontinue randomized study treatment early  will adhere to the double -blind 
Treatment Period visit schedule outlined in Table 1, as if  they were still receiving study 
treatment .  In addition, all subjects who disc ontinue study treatment early will be required to

Once subjects have successfully completed the 4 -week Screening  Period, a  total of 
350 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 2:2:1 ratio ( 140, 140, 
and 70 subjects per group, respectively) , as follows:  
1. OKZ 64 mg q4w:  SC injection of OKZ 64 mg q4w (alternating with SC injection of 
placebo OKZ q4w to maintain blinding) + MTX  
2. OKZ 64 mg q2w:  SC injection of OKZ 64 mg q2w + MTX  
3. Placebo:  SC injection of placebo q2w + MTX  
This is a double -blind study; as the placebo differs in  appearance from OKZ, study treatment 
will be prepared by  an independent unblinded pharmacist or designee  (e.g., nurse) out of 
sight of the subject and any blinded study team members  and provided to blinded site staff in 
blinded syringes that are identical  in appearance.  T he SC injections of OKZ or  placebo will 
be administered every other week by blinded trained study staff .  In addition, the study site 
staff will be trained in methods that must be followed and documented to maintain the blind .  
Guidance o n specific blinding procedures will be provided in the Study Reference Manual.  
As noted above for treatment group No. 1, in order to maintain the blind, subjects 
randomized to receive OKZ q4w will receive placebo injections at the alternate q4w interval (e.g., Week  2, Week  6, etc) at prespecified visits as described in Table 1.  
Throughout the double -blind T reatment P eriod, all subjects will be required to remain on a 
stable dose of background MTX at 15 to 25 mg/week (or ≥ 10 mg/week if there is 
documented intoleranc e to higher doses) with a stable route of administration, and 
concomitant treatment with folic acid ≥5 mg per week or equivalent is required for all 
subjects .  All subjects in the placebo group will be randomized in a blinded fashion to receive 
either OKZ 64 mg q2w or OKZ 64 mg q4w starting at Week 16 and continuing for the 
remainder of the double -blind Treatment Period.  From Week  0 through Week 24, subjects 
will return to the study site at least every other week for response and safety assessments as 
per Table 1.  Blood samples to assess OKZ concentrations in plasma will be collected 
periodically during the Treatment Period as per  Table 4.   
Subjects will be classified in terms of their response to study treatment at Week 14, with 
nonresponders  defined as subjects from any treatment group who do not improve by at leas t 
20% in both SJC and TJC  (66-68 joint assessment ).  Starting a t or as close as possible to 
Week  14, nonresponders  in all groups will be administered sulfasalazine and/or 
hydroxychloroquine as rescue medication in addition to OKZ  (see Section  6.13.3).

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  55 Confidential  The last dose of OKZ will be at Week 20 for subjects receiving OKZ 64 mg q4w and at 
Week  22 for subjects receiving OKZ 64 mg q2w . 
After completion of the 2 4-week , double -blind T reatment P eriod, subjects will either roll 
over into the long- term OLE study or enter the S afety Follow -Up Period .  During the S afety 
Follow -Up Period , subjects will return for visits  +4, +8, and + 22 weeks after the last dose of 
study treatment at Week  22 as per Table 1 (Visit SFU -1 [Week  26], Visit SFU -2 [Week  30], 
and Visit SFU -3 [Week  44], respectively).  
Subjects who discontinue randomized treatment early  will adhere to the double -blind 
Treatment Period visit schedule outlined in Table 1, as if  they were still receiving study 
treatment.   In addition, a ll subjects  who  discontinue study treatment early will be required to 
attend the EoT Visit +2  weeks  after the last dose of study treatment, as well as  extended 
Safety  Follow -Up assessments +4 weeks (Visit SFU -1), +8 weeks (Visit  SFU -2), and 
+22 weeks (Visit SFU -3) after the last dose of study treatment.  
Adverse events will be assessed throughout the study and evaluated using the CTCAE 
version 4.0. 
There will be ongoing monitoring of safety events, including laboratory findings, by 
R-Pharm and /or R-Pharm ’s designee.  In addition, safety will be assessed throughout the 
study by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) (see Section 7.6.4 for 
further details).  
5.2.1 Cardiovascular  Risk Assessment  
The RA population is known to have an increased risk of CV events .  In order to fully assess 
the CV risks associated with OKZ, the following approach will be implemented:  
1. Potential major adverse cardiac events (MACE) will be adjudicated by an 
independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee ( CVAC ) according to a 
predefined charter .  The charter will define the criteria, data, and source 
documentation required to adjudicate all MACE . 
2. Baseline CV risks including individual risk factors  (e.g., tobacco use, presence of 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and lipid profile ) will be assessed . 
3. Known CV risk factors will be monitored and assessed to detect any trends over 
long-term exposure. 
Cardiovascular risk assessment data will be  provided to the CVAC for use in review and 
adjudication of MACE  (see Section  7.6.4.2) .

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  56 Confidential  5.2.2 Safety Follow -up Assessments  
Given the long half -life of OKZ (approximately 31 days), subjects will be followed  up for 
approximately 5 OKZ half -lives (i.e., 22 weeks) after the final dose of study treatment.  
For subjects remaining on randomized therapy until the last scheduled dose of study 
treatment  at Visit 14 (Week 22) and not entering the OLE study, a full safety assessment will 
be performed at the EoT Visit (Visit 15 [ Week 24 ]) and extended Safety Follow -Up 
procedures will be performed at visits scheduled + 4, +12, and + 22 weeks after the last dose 
of study treatment (i.e., Visits  SFU -1 [Week  26], SFU -2 [Week  30], and SFU -3 [(Week  44], 
respectively).  
Subjects who discontinue randomized study  treatment early  (i.e., prior to Week 24) will 
adhere to the established double -blind Treatment Per iod visit schedule outlined in Table 1, as 
if they were still receiving study treatment.  In addition, all subjects who discontinue study  
treatment early will have extended Safety Follow -Up assessments performed at the following 
time points : 
• Full safety assessment 2 weeks after the last dose of study  treatment  (EoT Visit) 
(see Section  5.4.2)  
• Safety Follow -Up Visit +4 weeks after the last dose of study treatment  (Visit SFU -1) 
(see Section 5.4.3.1)  
• Safety Follow -Up Visit +12 weeks after the last dose of study treatment (Visit SFU -2) 
(see Section  5.4.3.2)  
• Safety Follow -Up Visit +22 weeks after the last dose of study treatment (Visit SFU -3) 
(see Section 5.4.3.3)  
Depending on the timing  of study treatment discontinuation, it is possible that the 
double -blind Treatment Per iod visits (Visits 2 through 15) may occur at the same time as the 
Safety Follow -Up Visits.  In such cases, t he study site staff  should complete all study 
procedures required by both visits; i f there are overlaps in the required laboratory tests, 
however, only one  set of tests will be performed.  
All s ubjects will be reminded of study contact information to report potential SAEs and are 
to inform the Investigator if they experience such events during the Safety Follow -Up Period.  
5.3 Selection of Study Population  
The study population will consist of a representative  group of subjects  of at least 18  years of 
age, fulfilling ACR 2010 revised classification criteria for RA for at least 24 weeks prior to

All subjects are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time, for any reason, 
specified or unspecified, and without prejudice to further treatment.  
If premature withdrawal occurs for any reason, the Investigator  must make every effort to 
determine the primary reason for a subject’s premature withdrawal from the study and record this information on the source documents and appropriate electronic case report form 
(eCRF ). 
Subject will be  completely withdrawn from study treatment and all assessments in the 
following cases:  
• Withdrawal of informed consent  
• Death of subject  
• Subject lost to follow -up 
− Note:  If the subject is lost to follow -up, the  Investigator should attempt  to contact  
the subject until the last scheduled Follow -Up Visit at  Week  44.  T he date of 
study termination for the subject is the date of last contact with subject.  
If the subject withdraws from the study and withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be 
collected .  R-Pharm may retain and continue to use any data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.  
Investigators are strongly encouraged to discuss the withdrawal of a subject with R -Pharm or 
R-Pharm’s desig nee in advance whenever possible.  
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced.  
5.4 Study Procedures  
Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -required tests and procedures are 
completed as described .  However , it is anticipated  that from time to time there may be 
circumstances outside of the control of the Investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test .  In these cases, the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safety and wellbeing of the subject .

relative to the last dose of study treatment (+4, +8, and +22  weeks, respectively).  
As much as possible, s ubjects should be seen for all scheduled visits on the designated day .  
If a subject is unable to attend a scheduled visit on the design ated day, the subject should be 
seen as closely as possible to the original ly scheduled  visit day . 
The following visit windows are allowed (see Table 1) , although thei r use should be avoided 
if possible : 
• Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 2 ( baseline):  ± 0 days  
• Visit 3 (Week 1) :  ±2 days  
• Visits 4 through 15/EoT  (Weeks 2 through 24) :  ±3 days  
• Visits SFU -1, SFU -2, and SFU -3:  ±7 days  
In all cases , there must be at least 1 week  between each administration of the study treatment .  
If a subject misses a visit and comes for an Unscheduled V isit, procedures for the assessment 
of safety and efficacy should be performed according to the most recent visit that was 
omitted .  When a prot ocol-required procedure cannot be performed, the Investigator will 
document in the source documents the  reason for this and any corrective and preventive 
actions that  he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as 
possible .  The study team should be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion. 
Subjects  are required to fast for at least 9 hours  (water and concomitant medications are 
allowed) prior to the following visits :  Visit 1 ( Screening ), Visit 2  (Randomization , Week  0), 
Visit 3 (Week 1), Visit 5 ( Week  4), Visit 7 (Week 8), Visit 9 ( Week  12), Visit  11 (Week 16), 
Visit 12 (Week 18), Visit 13 (Week 20), Visit 15 ( Week  24), Visit SFU -2 (Week  30), and

5.4.1.1 Screening (Visit 1 , Days  -28 to - 1) 
A separate ICF is completed for the main study and the PG study ( optional ).  W ritten 
informed consent must be obtained prior to the performance of any protocol -specific 
procedures at Screening .  The Investigator at each study  site will ensure that each subject has 
been provided with full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, 
and available details of possible risks an d benefits of the study.  
Subjects must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study treatment or 
the whole study at any time .  The Investigator will discuss with the subject  the importance of 
participation in the study despite the discontinuation of study treatment.  T he subject should 
be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed adequate time to consider the written 
information provided.  T he Investigator must retain the original, signed ICF for the study file .  
A copy of the signed ICF must be given to the subject .  Once informed consent has been 
obtained, the subject ’s eligibility to enter the study will be verified in accordance with the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria (refer to Sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.2, respectively).  
Enrollment will occur using  an Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS ) at Screening  upon 
ICF signature .  The IWRS will assign a unique subject number at Screening . 
Screening may be conducted up to 28 days  prior to  randomization. 
If the Investigator considers Screening  laboratory tests wi th exclusionary results to be due to 
laboratory error or a transient condition, these tests may be repeated once during the

to Screening , and if  the films or images are  available and included in the subject's 
source documents . 
• Perform joint counts (Independent Joint Assessment) . 
− Joint assessor will be independent to the rest of the study team.  A n independent joint 
assessor, blinded to other study assessments as well as the dosing regimen, will be identified at each study site to perform the SJC and TJC .  To ensure consistent joint 
evaluation throughout the study, individual subjects  should be evaluated by the same 
joint assessor for all study visits whenever possible.

• Perform urinalysis  (see Section 7.6.6.1) . 
5.4.1.2 Randomization (Visit 2, Week 0)  
The results of all Screening  procedures must be available at or prior to the Baseline Visit 
(Visit 2) to determine eligibility for enrollment into the study .  The Investigator must 
evaluate the results of laboratory tests performed at Screening  to determine if any laboratory 
test results are outside the ranges specified in the eligibility criteria , and joint counts should 
be reconfirmed before randomization; no exceptions to these requirements will be allowed.  
If a subject meets all study eligibility criteria, the Investigator  will randomize the subject via 
the IWRS ; if not, the subject should be recorded a s a screen failure in the IWRS.

All eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:2:1  ratio to the OKZ and placebo 
treatment groups described in Section 5.2.  A detailed description of the study treatment 
(OKZ and placebo) is provided in S ection 6.2. 
Background Therapy  
All subjects will continue to receive their prior background therapy (MTX) during the study.  
As per inclusion criterion No. 4 (see Section  5.3.1) , subject s must have been treated with 
MTX at a dose of 15 to 25 mg/week (or ≥ 10 mg/week if there is documented intolerance  to 
higher doses) for at least 12  weeks prior to Screening  with a stable dose and an unchanged 
mode  of administration (oral, SC, or IM) for at least 6 weeks prior to Screening . 
The dose of background MTX should remain unchanged throughout the study and may be 
adjusted only for safety reasons  according to Investigator discretion.  If the Investigator 
judges that the dose of MTX must be adjusted for safety reasons, this may only be done once during  the study .  If needed, a reduction in the MTX dose may be made according to the 
guidelines in Appendix 4 (see Section 13.4).  
Rescue Medication  
Starting at Week 14, nonresponders will be assigned rescue medication ( sulfasalazine and/or  
hydroxychloroquine ) in addition to their assigned study treatment (see Section 6.13.3).

Manufacturing Practices and all applicable local country regulations with information on the 
study protocol number, drug identification, storage conditions, and dosage information. 
6.4 Storage  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for the safekeeping and correct storage of the 
study treatment (OKZ and placebo) at the study site.  
Olokizumab will be shipped and stored refrigerated at +2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) in a 
secure, temperature- controlled refrigerator .  Placebo  must be stored as per the manufacturer ’s 
requirement s.  Both OKZ and placebo will  be supplied centrally by a clinical supplies 
vendor .  In order to maintain the blind, study treatment s will be stored separately at th e study 
site in a secure area inaccessible to blinded study site staff .  Please refer to the Pharmacy 
Manual for additional details on storage requirements. 
6.5 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Group  
Once a subject’s eligibility has been confirmed, subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio  
by blinded study staff using the IWRS (an automated web randomization system) .  All 
subjects randomized to the placebo group will also be randomized by blinded study staff using  the IWRS in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the 2 OKZ  treatment regimens starting a t 
Week 16 and continuing for the remainder of the double -blind Treatment Period .  The IWRS 
will allocate the treatment group and assign the study treatment.  T his system will also 
manage drug supply management and visit dispensation.  B linded study staff will request 
study treatment assignment s via the IWRS for all sub sequent t reatment study visits.  Further 
details on the IWRS and requirements for each study visit can be found in the separate IWRS Manual.  
6.6 Study Treatment Accountability  
The unblinded pharmacist or an unblinded delegate at the study site is responsible for 
mainta ining an adequate record of the receipt and distribution of study treatment .  The study 
treatment  accountability records must be kept current, available for monitoring by the 
unblinded monitor, and available for inspection at any time .  Study treatment materials 
should be kept in a secured location that is  inaccessible to blinded study staff .  The used 
study treatment must be discarded as a biohazard , and the handling, disposal , and destruction 
details will be detailed in the Pharmacy M anual.

administration and study treatment compliance.  
Detailed instructions on drug accountability are provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
6.7 Treatment Compliance  
The Investigator  should promote compliance by stating that compliance is necessary for the  
subject’s safety and the validity of the study .  The prescribed dosage, timing, and mode of 
administration may not be changed.  A ll dates and times of study treatment administration  
and any departures from the intended regimen must  be recorded on the appropriate  eCRF 
page.  
An unblinded monitor will review the pharmacy records at each study site including the drug 
dispensing records on which the pharmacist or designated person should record all study 
treatment  released for subject use.  T he unblinded monitor  will compare the dispensing 
record and vials with the individual subject ’s identifier s and visit schedule to confirm that the 
subject received the correct treatment  and dose, and that the dosing schedule is correct .  
Errors that are identified will be communicated to the study site  staff  to ensure that the errors 
are not repeated .  Unblinded study staff will be notified in an unblinded manner, and blinded 
study staff will be notified in a blinded manner.  T he monitor ’s report will include details of 
any missed doses, errors in dose, treatment errors, or scheduling errors and the associated explanations .  All supplies and pharmacy documentation must be made available throughout 
the study for the monitor to review.  
It will not be necessary for study sites to retain used syringes .  Compliance with the study 
treatment  is defined as the administr ation of the study treatment conforming to no less than 
90% of the dose regimen specified in this protocol  since study treatment will be administered 
by study site  staff .  Any subject who deviates from the dosing schedule or misses any  
scheduled treatment should be reported to R -Pharm and/or R -Pharm’s designee  promptly for 
determination of possible schedule adjustments and continued eligibility  (in the event of 
multiple missed doses) .  If a subject is found to be persistently noncompliant, R -Pharm 
and/or R -Pharm’s designee, in conjunction with the Investigator , will make a decision as to 
whether the subject should be  discontinued from the study  treatment  (see Section  6.11) . 
6.8 Preparation and Administration of Study Treatment 
An independent unblinded pharmacist (or designee) will prepare OKZ and placebo in syringes of 0.4  mL for SC injection.  In order to maintai n the blind, olokizumab and placebo 
will be prepared in blinded SC syringes as per the instructions in the Pharmacy Manual prior 
to dispensing, in a manner that both treatments will be identical in appearance.

stipulated stability time of the prepared product.  The solution may remain in the syringe for 
a maximum of 4  hours prior to its administration.  The prepared SC syringes should be 
warmed at room temperature pr ior to study treatment  administration . 
At randomization, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of the 3 treatments 
discussed in Section 5.2.  A ll subjects in the placebo group will also be randomized in a 
blinded fashion to receive 1 of the 2 OKZ treatments described in Section 5.2 starting at 
Week 16.  Qualified blinded study staff will administer 1  SC injection (0.4 mL  of OKZ or 
placebo ) q2w or q4w at the relevant time points as per Table 1.  To maintain the blind, the 
study site staff will be trained in methods that must be followed and documented.  Guidance 
on specific blinding procedures will be provided in the Study Reference Manual.  If desired, 
SC injections may be rotated among the thighs and abdomen.  A ll subjects will remain at the 
study site for at least 30 minutes following each administration of study treatment (or 2 hours 
after Visit 2 [ Week 0 ] and Visit 11 [ Week  16]) to be assessed for onset of any systemic 
injection  reactions (see Section 7.6.3.2) . 
The date, time, and location of the SC injection should be recorded in the eCRF .  The 
Investigator should also record in the eCRF whether or not the full dose was administered. 
There must be at least 1 week between each administration of the study treatment  (refer to 
Section 5.4 for the  visit windows allowed for each study visit) . 
Detailed instructions on study treatment preparation and handling are provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
6.9 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject

• ALT and/or AST remain >3× ULN with total bilirubin ≤2× ULN after repeat laboratory 
testing and there are no symptoms consistent with he patic injury (fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, or rash).  The Investigator may 
consider restarting study treatment only after discussion with the R -Pharm Medical 
Advisor or designee (see also Appendix 4 [Section 13.4]).  
Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should be re -tested and followed until 
resolution, stabilization, or return to baseline values , and the Investigator should contact the 
Medical Monitor for guidance regarding restarting the study treatment.  
Study treatment should not be administered to subjects with active or clinically significant infections.

monitoring  or remain ing abnormalities after retesting which do not require premature 
discontinuation of the study tre atment but could be harmful for the patient according to the  
Investigator’s jud gement , or other clinically significant newly diagnosed co- morbidity that 
requires additional assessments  for clarification of t he diagnosis, and the severity of which  
could wor sen if study treatment is continued).  
The Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor for guidance regarding restarting the study treatment.  
6.11.2 Permanent Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
The criteria for enrollment are to be followed explicitly.  
If a su bject who does not meet enrollment criteria is inadvertently enrolled, R -Pharm or 
R-Pharm’s designee must be informed immediately  and the subject must be immediately and 
permanently discontinue study treatment . 
If, in the opinion of the Investigator, a sub ject is consistently noncompliant with the protocol 
in regards to study procedures , use of concomitant medications, or dosing with the study 
treatment , the case will be reviewed by R -Pharm on a case -by-case basis and noncompliant 
subjects can be discontinued from the study treatment. 
If the Investigator judges that the subject ’s health is deteriorating or not improving, the 
Investigator can elect to discontinue  the subject from the study  treatment.  Appropriate 
standard of care, at the discretion of the Investigator, will be initiated.  
In addition to the above , study treatment will be discontinued in the following circumstances: 
• Investigator decides that the subject should be discontinued from study treatment .  If this 
decision is made because of an intol erable AE or a clinically significant laboratory value, 
the study treatment is to be discontinued, appropriate measures are to be taken , and 
R-Pharm or R -Pharm ’s designee  is to be notified . 
• Subject is unwilling to continue the study  treatment.  If the subj ect discontinues  from the 
study  treatment,  the Investigator should inquire about the reason for discontinuing.  
• Subject presents with any of the following elevated LFTs (see also Appendix 4

− Creatinine value >2 × ULN  
• Subject has confirmation of a pregnancy during the study, as evidenced by a positive 
pregnancy test . 
• R-Pharm , a regulatory agency , or an ethical committee  stops the study for any reason.  
• Administration of a live vaccine during the study.  
• Subject has a GI perforation.  
• Subject has a severe or  life-threatening  infection that requires hospitalization (which is 
also an SAE; see Section 7.6.2).  
• Confirmed active TB is an SAE  (see Section 7.6.2 ), must be recorded on the relevant AE 
pages of the eCRF , and will be provided to R -Pharm in accordance with SAE reporting 
requirements as outlined in Section 7.6.5.2.  As with all SAEs, periodic follow -up reports 
should be completed according to protocol requirement s (i.e., through 22 weeks of safety 
follow -up) until such time as the TB disease resolves.  
6.12 Blinding  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled study.  Access to randomization

blinded study team memb ers and provided to blinded site staff in blinded syringes that are 
identical in appearance.  The study site staff will be trained in methods that must be followed 
and documented to prevent unblinding .  Guidance on specific blinding procedures will be 
provided in the Study Reference Manual.  The treatment codes will be held by the IWRS.  
Only the unblinded pharmacist (or their unblinded designee) or dedicated unblinded study 
staff who are not directly involved in subject management will be aware of the randomized 
drug assignment.  The storage and preparation of the study treatment will be at a secured 
location that is not accessible to blinded study  staff.  
Additional measures to ensure that both Investi gators and subjects remain blinded to study 
treatment include the following:  
• Joint assessments will be made by an independent assessor, blinded to both the dosing 
regimen  and all other study assessments. 
• Laboratory results for CRP and ESR samples collected  during the Treatment Period will 
not be available to blinded study site staff.  As ESR will be tested locally, the testing will be performed, reviewed, and registered by unblinded study site staff who are not 
responsible for managing subjects. 
• Certain eff icacy assessments (ACR20, ACR50, ACR70, DAS28 (CRP), DAS28 (ESR), 
SDAI, and CDAI) will not be calculated by the Investigator during the course of the study, but will instead be computed in the statistical database for analysis purposes.  
All blinding procedures should be  respected . 
Members of the independent DSMB will separately review safety data during the study.   In 
the event that ongoing safety monitoring uncovers an issue that needs to be addressed by unblinding at the treatment group level, only member s of the DSMB are permitted to conduct 
additional analysis of the safety data.  
6.12.1 Unblinding  
The process for unblinding will be handled through the IWRS, which will be accessible at all times.   Investigators are strongly discouraged from requesting the blind be broken for an 
individual subject, unless there is a subject safety issue that requires unblinding and would change subject management.   Any study site that breaks the blind under inappropriate 
circumstances may be asked to discontinue its participation in the study.  If the blind is 
broken, it may be broken for only the subject in question.  The Investigator should make every effort to discuss the subject ’s case with R -Pharm (or its designee) prior to unblinding.

6.13 Prior and Concomitant Treatments  
Concomitant treatment with MTX is detailed in Section  6.1.  Specifically, at the discretion of 
the Investigator , the dose of MTX can be reduced once during the study for safety reasons  
according to the guidelines in Appendix 4 (see Section 13.4).  
Concomitant treatment with folic acid ≥5 mg per week or equivalent is required for all subjects starting by Visit 2 (Week 0).  Folic acid or equivalent should not be taken on the 
same day as MTX.  
Other specifically allowed medications are discussed in Sect ion 6.13.2. 
Specific treatments prohibited prior to (as applicable) and during the course of the study are described in Table 3.  Other medications and non -drug therapies not listed within Table 3 that 
are considered necessary for the subject’s safety and well -being  may be given at the

6.13.1 Olokizumab  Potential Impact on C ytochrome P and Transporter Pathways  
Based on nonclinical data ( refer to the most recent version of the  Investigator’s Brochure ), it 
is possible that OKZ may reverse IL -6-mediated inhibition of CYP or transporter pathways 
such as CYP1A1/2, 2B6, 2C9, 3A4/5, and 2C19 and sodium/taurocholate co- transporting 
polypeptide .  If CYP or transporter activity is de -suppressed (i.e., increased to any relevant 
extent), this may result in decreased level of drugs eliminated by these pathways .  As such, 
OKZ  may have clinical relevance for CYP substrates with narrow therapeutic index and for

7.1.10 Health Assessments and P atient -Reported Outcomes  
The PROs that will be utilized for efficacy assessments are discussed in this section.  
7.1.10.1 Health Assessment Q uestionnaire – Disability Index  
The HAQ- DI is a patient -reported questionnaire that provides an assessment of the impact of 
the disease and its treatment on physical function .  The HAQ- DI assesses the degree of 
difficulty experienced in 8 domains of daily living activities using 20  questions .  The 
domains are dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and 
common daily activities, and each domain (activity) consists of 2 or 3  items .  For each 
question, the level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 where 0  = without any difficulty, 
1 = with some difficulty, 2  = much difficulty, and 3 =  unable to do.  E ach category is given a 
score by taking the maximum score of each question (i.e., question in each categ ory with the 
highest score for that category).  
If the maximum score is 0  or 1, but a device related to that category is used, or help from 
another person is provided for the category, then the category score is increased to 2.  If the 
category score is alr eady a 2  (or above), the score in that category remains 2  with or without 
any aids or device use .  If the subject does not provide an answer for any questions within a 
category, no score will be provided for that category .  The HAQ -DI will be calculated by  
dividing the sum of the category scores by the number of categories with at least 1 question answered .  If fewer than 6  categories have responses, no disability score will be calculated.  
The HAQ- DI will also include patient assessments of pain and health on a scale of 0 to 100.  
7.1.10.2 Short Form -36 
The SF -36 health survey is a patient -reported survey of health; it is commonly used in health 
economics as a variable in the quality -adjusted life year (QALY) calculation to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of a health  treatment .  The SF -36 consists of 8 scaled scores, which are the 
weighted sums of the questions in their section.  E ach scale is directly transformed into a 0  to

more disability .  The higher the score , the less disability (i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to 
maximum disability and a score of 100  is equivalent to no disability).  
The 8  domains of the SF -36 are as follows:  
• Vitality  
• Physical functioning  
• Bodily pain 
• General health perceptions  
• Physical role functioning 
• Emotional role functioning 
• Social role functioning 
• Mental health  
7.1.10.3 European Quality of Life – 5 Dimensions  
The conceptual basis of the  EQ-5D is the holistic view of health, including both the medical 
definition  and the fundamental importance of independent physical, emotional , and social 
functioning .  The concept of health in EQ -5D also encompasses both positive aspects 
(well -being) and negative aspects (illness).  
The EQ -5D consists of a questionnaire and a VAS and is a self -rated health status .  The 
EQ-5D records the subject ’s perceptions of their own current overall health, and can be used 
to monitor changes with time .  The self -assessment questionnaire is a description of 
5 dimensions (i.e., mobility, se lf-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression) .  The subject is asked to grade their own current level of function in each 
dimension into 1 of 5 degrees of disability ( extreme, severe, moderate, slight, or none) .  The 
combination of these with the conditions “death” and “unconscious” enables a description of 
3127 different health states .  Each health state can be ranked and transformed as a single 
score called the utility . 
The EQ -5D health states  may be converted into a single summary index by applying a 
formula that attaches values to each of the levels in each dimension .  The index can be 
calculated by deducting the appropriate weights from 1, the value for full health (i.e., state 
11111) .  Value sets have been derived for EQ -5D in se veral countries using the European

The WPS -RA measures the impact of RA and treatmen t on subject productivity within and 
outside the home during the previous month.  It contains 9  questions addressing employment 
status, productivity within and outside the home, and daily activities .  One item of the 
WPS- RA addresses current labor market p articipation .  This is a strong indicator of work 
ability because not working implies complete loss of paid productivity .  There are also 
normative and comparative data available on employment status .  Two items capture 
self-reported work absences due to a rthritis, and 2 items capture the same concept but applied 
to non- paid work.  T hese are separated into full and partial days (i.e.,  days of work missed 
and days with productivity reduced by at least half) .  Additional items capture the 
respondent's estimat e of the extent to which arthritis has interfered with the subject ’s work 
productivity (paid and non- paid) on a scale of 0  to 10, the number of days in the last month 
outside help was hired because of arthritis, and the number of days in the last month family, 
social, or leisure activities were missed because of arthritis.  
7.1.10.5 Funct ional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue Scale  
FACIT -Fatigue is a 13 -item tool that measures an individual’ s level of fatigue during their 
usual daily activities during the most recent week .  The level of fatigue is measured on a 
4-point Likert scale.  
The sum of the scoring (total score) will be used for the statistical evaluation .  If an item is 
not scored, the total score will be set to missing.

7.4 Pharmacogenetics  
The following PG endpoints are exploratory and are not intended to be used for regulatory 
judgments pertaining to the safety or efficacy of the investigational drug.  However, these 
data may be considered for voluntary submission, consistent with applicable r egulatory 
guidance on this topic, in order to develop the knowledge base necessary to establish the 
validity of new genomic biomarkers.  
This study includes an optional exploratory PG assessment which requires signature of a 
separate informed consent if the subject agrees to participate.  The identity of the subject will 
not be revealed.  It is required as part of this protocol that the Investigator presents these 
options to the subject. 
Exploratory PG studies are planned as a part of this study with the obj ectives of identifying 
inherited genetic factors that may (1) predict response to treatment with OKZ, (2) predict 
relative susceptibility to drug -drug interactions, (3) predict genetic predisposition to side 
effects, or (4) be related to RA and also predic t response to treatment with OKZ.  R -Pharm 
hopes to develop a better understanding of how subjects with RA respond to OKZ.  
At all study sites, 1 optional blood sample will be collected in subjects for PG assessment at Visit 2 (baseline) after a separate PG  ICF has been signed as indicated in Table 1.  If the

Laboratory  manuals will be provided with detailed information o n sample collection, 
handling, and shipment.  The actual sample collection date must be entered on the C entral 
Laboratory  Assessment eCRF page.  
Any DNA derived from the sample that remains after anal ysis may be stored for up to 
15 years to address scientif ic questions related to OKZ or RA.  
7.5 Serum Biomarkers Related to Targeted Pathway  
Biomarkers are objectively measured and evaluated indicators of normal biological 
processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention.  
This search for biomarkers of disease and drug response will involve an integrated molecular 
approach examining genetic and serum protein profiles.  These exploratory assessments aim 
to identify potential markers of response and/or loss of response, and to c haracterize 
molecular mechanisms of treatment with OKZ.  
Any biomarker samples may be stored for up to 20 years (depending on local regulations) to research scientific questions related to OKZ,  RA , and related diseases with a potential 
involvement of IL 6.  The material can be destroyed on subject’s request at any time.  Details on the collection, handling , and shipment of the samples to the central laboratory will be 
provided to Investigators in the Laboratory Manual. 
Any results from these exploratory biomarker assessments will be reported separately.  
Serum biomarkers related to systemic inflammation, bone and joint metabolism, and CV risk will be measured.  The final selection of analytes will be driven by assay availability, new 
information from the pub lic domain, results obtained in other OKZ clinical studies, as well as 
by hypotheses generated by other exploratory biomarker assessments.  In addition, selected 
markers exploring the effect of OKZ treatment on co -morbidities may be assessed.  At all 
study  sites, blood samples will be collected for soluble serum markers predose at the 
scheduled time points  as indicated in Table 1.  Samples should then be processed and shipped 
as detailed in the Laboratory Manual.  The actual sample collection date will be entered on 
the corresponding eCRF page.  Sampling problems will be noted in the Comments section of 
the eCRF.  
7.6 Safety  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all AEs, including SAEs , 
nonserious AESIs , and pregnancies ; measurement of safety laboratory assessments; 
measurement of vital signs , ECGs, physical examinations ; and other tests that are deemed

study treatment.  As discussed in Section 7.6.2.3, any pregnancy that occurs while a subject 
is enrolled in the study will also be monitored and reported according to the appropriate regulations . 
The Investigator remains responsible for following, through an appropriate health care option, AEs that are serious and nonserious that caused the subject to discont inue before 
completing the study .  Any AE, including any AE still ongoing at the end of the study, 
should be followed until it has resolved, it has a stable sequelae, the Investigator  determines 
that it is no longer clinically significant, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  I f no follow -up is 
provided, the  Investigator must provide a justification . 
In addition to records of observations made at specific times, unexpected signs and symptoms and concomitant medications will be recorded in the clinical study records throughout the study .  Further routine medical assessments in addition to those specified in 
Table 1 may take place during the study as clinically indic ated (e.g., chest X -rays to 
investigate lung lesions, ECG, etc).  
Safety measures in this study include, but are not limited to, SAEs, AEs, vital signs, body 
weight, and laboratory evaluations , and  if required,  this information must be present in the 
AE/SAE  report made by the Investigator.  
7.6.1 Adverse Events  
For the purposes of this study, an AE will be define d as any untoward medical occurrence in 
a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment .  An AE can therefore be 
any of the following:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product . 
− If the Investigator determines a laboratory abnormality to be clinically significant, it is considered a laboratory AE; however, if the abnormal laboratory value is consistent with a current diagnosis (or signs or symptoms if a diagnosis is not possible)  and is 
not a clinically significant worsening from the baseline laboratory parameter , it 
should be documented accordingly without being reported as a separate laboratory 
AE. 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a known condition).

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  111 Confidential  The Investigator is responsible for recording all AEs observed during the study  from the time 
the subject signs the ICF .  All AEs are recorded throughout the study until the last visit of the 
subject .  The Investigator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of the subjects 
during the entire study.  
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity, seriousness, and causal relationship to the 
investigational drug .  For all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information 
adequate both to determine the outcome of the AE and to asses s whether it meets the criteria 
for classification as a n SAE .  The Investigator is required to assess causality  as described 
below .  For AEs with a causal relationship to the study treatment, follow -up by the 
Investigator is required until the event has resolved, it has a stable  sequelae , the Investigator  
determines it is no longer clinically significant, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
Severity  
The severity of AE s will be characterized according to the CTCAE grades and definitions 
summarized in  Table 5. 
Table 5 CTCAE Grades and Corresponding AE Severity  
CTCAE Grade  Corresponding AE Severity  
Grade 1   Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL
 
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL  
Grade 4   Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5   Death related to AE

for Adverse Events.  
Causality Assessment  
The Investigator is responsible for making an assessment of the causal relationship between 
the study treatment and the AE .  Investigators should use their knowledge of the subject, the 
circumstances surrounding the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to 
determine whether or not an AE is considered to be related to the study treatment.  The 
causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE must be characterized as 
“related” or “not related.”  T he following guidance should be taken into consideration:

• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, discontinuation 
of the study treatment, or reintroduction of the study treatment.  
• Known association of the event with the study treatment, or with similar treatments . 
• Known associati on of the event with the disease under study . 
• Presence of risk factors in the subject or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event . 
• Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurr ence of the event.  
The Investigator should report the relatedness of each event  based on the most likely causal 
relationship , and t he study site staff is responsible for obtaining any  missing information.  
7.6.1.1 Eliciting Adverse Event  Information  
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting AE 
information at all subject evaluation time points .  Examples of nondirective questions from 
the Investigator to the subject include the following:  
• “How have you felt since your las t clinic visit?”  
• “Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?” 
7.6.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE experience or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to the study treatment or not) that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (the subject is at a risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect

jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of 
the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above . 
− Examples of such events are blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anemia requiring 
blood transfusion, etc) or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization.  
− Confirmed cases of active TB should be recorded and reported as SAEs . 
− Potential hepatotoxicity events that fulfill any of the following criteria should be recorded and reported as SAEs:  
 ALT >3× ULN and total bilirubin >2× ULN  
 ALT >8× ULN at any time, regardless of total bilirubin or accompanying 
symptoms  
 ALT >5× ULN for ≥2 weeks, regardless of total bilirubin or accompanying symptoms
 
 ALT >3× ULN, accompanied by symptoms consistent with hepatic injury (fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, or rash)
 
Any AE that results in an un planned hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be 
documented and reported as an SAE .  The following hospitalization scenarios are examples 
of events not cons idered to be SAEs:  
• Hospitalization for a pre -existing condition, provided that all of the following criteria are 
met: 
− Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition. 
− Elective or preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since the start of study treatment. 
− Treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a n SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission . 
− Social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the subject’s  
general condition . 
Any SAEs occurring after a subject has received  the last dose of study treatment  will be 
colle cted and reported to R -Pharm’s designee through the end of the Safety Follow -Up 
Period  (i.e., for a period of 22 weeks after the last dose of study treatment) , regardless of the

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  114 Confidential  Investigator ’s opinion of causality .  The Investigator must also inform partic ipating subjects 
of the need to inform the Investigator of any SAE that occurs within this period.  Any SAE 
with a start date after the Safety Follow -Up Period is  not required to be reported unless the 
Investigator thinks that  the event may be  related to either the study treatment, study treatment 
administration, or a protocol procedure.  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period, regardless of 
relationship to the study treatment , must be recorded on the SAE page in the eCRF and 
immediately reported to R -Pharm ’s designee.  T his includes death attributed to progression 
of RA . 
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event .  The event or condition that 
caused or cont ributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the  description of event  on 
the SAE page in the eCRF .  Generally, only 1  such event leading to death should be reported.  
The use of the term “ sudden death ” as the description of an event should only be used for 
the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a subject with or without pre -existing heart disease, within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms or, 
in the case of an unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the subject was last seen alive and 
stable .  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, 
“unexplained death” should be recorded on the SAE page  as the description of the event  in 
the eCRF .  If the cause of death lat er becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), “unexplained 
death” should be replaced by the established cause of death.  
7.6.2.1 Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of R heumatoid Arthritis  
Medical occurrences or symptoms of deterioration that are anticipated as part of RA should 
be recorded as an AE if judged by the Investigator to have unexpectedly worsened in severity 
or frequency or changed in nature at any time during the study .  When recording an 
unanticipated worsening of RA on the AEs eCRF page, it is important to convey the concept 
that the condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., “accelerated RA”) .  
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying 
disease, as determined by the Investigator , should not be recorded as AEs ; these data will be 
captured as efficacy assessment data only .  Every effort should be made to document 
progression using objective criteria .  If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is an 
AE or due to disease progression, it should be reported as an AE . 
Any worsening of RA that  meets the criteria for seriousness should be reported as an SAE.

7.6.2.3 Reporting and Follow -up Requirements for Pregnancies  
Pregnancies in Female Subjects  
A serum pregnancy test will be conducted on all fema les of childbearing potential at 
Screening, and urine pregnancy tests will be conducted thereafter as presented in the 
Schedule  of E vents ( Table 1).  
If a subject becomes  pregnant after the administration  of any study treatment, R -Pharm 
and/or R -Pharm’s designee should be informed immediately .  Study treatment should be 
discontinued as s oon as the pregnancy is known and the following  should be completed:  
• The subject should immediately discontinue further administration of study treatment.  
• The subject should return for an EoT Visit.  
• All scheduled safety assessments must be performed unless  contraindicated by pregnancy 
(harmful to fetus) or the subject withd raws informed consent . 
The Investigator must inform the subject of information currently known about potential risks  and about available treatment alternatives .  The pregnancy should be f ollowed up to 
determine outcome including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or  
newborn complications.  
Full details will be recorded on a P regnancy Report eCRF and submitted via the Electronic 
Data Capture (EDC) system , and reporting details will be detailed in the S tudy M anual .  The

Male subjects will be instructed through the ICF to immedia tely inform the Investigator if 
their partner becomes pregnant during the study and up to 3 months  after the subject received 
the last injection of study treatment.  A  Pregnancy Report eCRF should be completed by the 
Investigator within 1  working day after  learning of the pregnancy and submitted via the EDC  
system .  Attempts should be made to collect and report details of the course and outcome of 
any pregnancy in the partner of a male subject exposed to the study treatment.  T he pregnant 
partner will need to sign an Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health 
Information to allow for follow -up on her pregnancy .  Once the authorization has been 
signed, the Investigator will update the Pregnancy Report eCRF with additional information 
on the course and outcome of the pregnancy .  An Investigator who is contacted by the male 
subject or his pregnant partner may provide information on the risks of the pregnancy and the 
possible effects on the fetus, to support an informed decision in cooperation w ith the treating 
physician and/or obstetrician.  
7.6.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The following safety concerns were identified as AESIs based upon either the safety data 
available to date for OKZ ( refer to the most recent version of the Investigator’s Br ochure ) or 
drug class -related events for a biologic IL -6 inhibitor:  
• Infections (particularly serious infections), including TB and opportunistic infections  
− Confirmed cases of active TB must also be recorded as an SAE.  
• Malignancies  
− The Investigator will be asked to provide relevant medical 
information/documentation (e.g., pathology/histology reports) on all malignancy 
cases, whether considered serious or not, as these cases will be recorded in the safety 
database.  
• Elevation of blood lipids (e.g., hypercholes terolemia, blood cholesterol increased, blood 
triglycerides increased, hypertriglyceridemia, and elevation of LDL)  
• Systemic injection reactions and hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis  
− Refer to Appendix 6 (Section 13.6) for details on diagnosing anaphylaxis.

Section  7.6.3.4) . 
• Injection site reactions  
• Demyelination in peripheral or central nervous system  
• Autoimmune disorders . 
All of the events listed above will be analy zed as AESIs ; some of these events are further 
detailed below . 
7.6.3.1 Infections  
Frequency, duration, and severity of infectious complications along with those requiring 
treatment (e.g., antibiotic, antiviral, etc) will be monitored and evaluated.  I nvestigators will 
also educate subjects, parents, and/or caregivers about the symptoms of infections and will 
provide instructions on dealing with these infections . 
Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of OKZ in subjects with a histo ry of recurring infection or with underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes) that may 
predispose subjects to infections.  Study Treatment should not be administered to subjects 
with active  or clinically significant infection.  Vigilance for timely detection of  serious 
infection is recommended for subjects receiving biologic agents for treatment of RA, as signs 
and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened due to suppression of the acute phase 
reaction.  Subjects must be instructed to contact their physicia n immediately when any 
symptom suggesting infection appears, in order to assure rapid evaluation and appropriate 
treatment.  The Investigator may be asked to provide relevant medical 
information/documentation (e.g., result of bacterial examination or cultures).  
Any infection that meets the criteria for seriousness should be reported as an SAE. 
7.6.3.2 Systemic Injection  Reactions , Including Anaphylaxis  
A systemic injection reaction is any untoward medical hypersensitivity like event, other than 
injection site react ions, occurring during or after study treatment administration that can be at 
least possibly attributed to the study treatment.  Systemic injection reactions are further

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  118 Confidential  classified as acute and delayed based on timing and presentation of symptoms typical f or 
hypersensitivity reactions.  
Acute and delayed reactions to the study treatment should be reported according to the 
judgment of the Investigator, based on the typical clinical features.  
Any systemic allergic reaction that meets the criteria for seriousne ss should be reported as an 
SAE.  
Subjects will be observed for AEs at the study site during the 30 minutes following each 
administration of study treatment (or 2 hours after Visit 2  and Visit 10 ), and subjects will be 
asked to contact the Investigator if a ny reactions occur within the 2 hours following study 
treatment  injection.  
Acute injection reactions are usually defined as at least 1 of the following signs or symptoms 
occurring during or within 2 hours of the study treatment injection: 
• Hypotension  
• Urtic aria 
• Flushing 
• Facial or hand edema  
• Throat tightness, oral cavity, or lip edema  
• Headache  
• Shortness of breath.  
The Investigator should report any AE of acute systemic injection reaction as “anaphylaxis” if it meets the Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis, as specified in Appendix 6 ( Section 13.6).  
The study site must have adequate arrangements to manage anaphylactic reactions . 
Delayed injection reactions are usually defined as at least 2 of the following 4 signs or symptoms occurring within 1 day to 14 days following  the injection: 
• Rash  
• Fever (more than 100°F [38°C])

7.6.3.3 Gastrointestinal Perforation  
Timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment may reduce the potential for complications of 
diverticulitis and thus reduce the risk of GI perforations .  Therefore, subjects should be made 
aware of the symptoms potentially indicative of diverticular disease, and they should be 
instructed to alert their healthcare provider as soon as possible if these symptoms arise .  
Permanent d iscontinuation of study trea tment is required  for subjects who develop GI 
perforation. 
Any GI perforation that meets the criteria for seriousness should be reported as an SAE.  
7.6.3.4 Hepatotoxicity  
The Investigator will be asked to provide relevant medical information/documentation (e.g., 
laboratory test results) for all serious and non- serious cases of potential hepatotoxicity.  
Potential hepatotoxicity is defined as laboratory results that fulfill an y of the following 
criteria (in all cases, AST may be substituted for ALT if ALT results are not available):  
• ALT >3× to ≤5× ULN  
• ALT >5× ULN  
• ALT >3× ULN and total bilirubin >2× ULN  
Laboratory results that satisfy any of the criteria for potential hepatotoxicity  should be 
followed by a repeat test  within 72 hours , which must include total bilirubin, direct and 
indirect bilirubin, GGT, INR, alkaline phosphatase, creatine phosphokinase, and hematology 
assessment.  After that, testing should be repeated at least  weekly and followed until 
resolution, stabilization, or return to baseline values.  Additional  testing may be limited to 
ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin if all other laboratory results are within normal limits.  The number of LFTs included in each repeat testing may be further reduced to 
include only those param eters which remain abno rmal (i.e., abnormalities that stabilize, 
resolve, or return to within baseline values do not require repeat testing).  
Potential hepatotoxicity events that fulfill any of the following criteria must also be recorded as SAEs in the eCRF  (in all cases, AST m ay be substituted for ALT if ALT results are not 
available):  
• ALT >3× ULN and total bilirubin >2× ULN  
• ALT >8× ULN  at any time , regardless of t otal bilirubin or accompanying symptoms

• ALT >3× ULN , accompanied by symptoms consistent with hepatic injury (fatigue, 
nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, or rash)  
For SAEs of potential hepatotoxicity , the Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor for 
guidance,  as additional tests are needed to investigate all potential causes of liver toxicity  
(e.g.,  alcohol  use, hepatitis infection, biliary tract disease, and concomitant medications ).  
Work -up includes, but is not limited to:  
• Obtaining a more detailed  history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  
• Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications and 
herbal/dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special 
diets.  
• Ruling out acute viral hepatitis (types A, B, C, D, and E), cytomegalovirus, Epstein- Barr 
virus, autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy, and biliary tract disease.  
• Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemic al agents.  
• Obtaining additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct bilirubin, biliary tract ultrasonography/imaging results, liver biopsy).  
• Considering  gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.  
All additional investigations should be recor ded in the eCRF via the EDC system, and all 
records should be kept as source documents at the study site.  
7.6.3.5 Injection Site Reactions  
An injection site reaction is any untoward medical event occurring at the injection site during 
or after  study treatment administration that can be at least possibly attributed to the study 
treatment  (i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out) . 
An assessment of pain, redness, swelling, induration, hemorrhage, and itching at the injection site will be perfor med by a physician and recorded on the specific page of the eCRF.  At all 
specified visits (see Table 1), the assessment of injection site reactions will be made prior to any administration of study treatment.  All local reactions that are observed will be monitored until they resolve. 
7.6.4 Study Committees

7.6.4.1 Data Safety Monitoring Board 
The independent DSMB members will perform ongoing safety surveillance and provide recommendations to R -Pharm regarding study conduct .  These recommendations will be 
based mainly on the review of data for AEs and laboratory  parameters.   In the event that the 
DSMB uncovers an issue  that needs to be addressed by unblinding at the treatment group 
level, only members of the DSMB are permitted to conduct additional analysis of the  
unblinded safety data.  
7.6.4.2 Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee  
The CVAC will be responsible for evaluating MACE and will remain blinded to treatment 
assignment .  The importance of the CVAC is to ensure that all potential MACE  that have 
been reported are judged uniformly by a single group, using the same adjudication criteria . 
Data on the following fatal and nonfatal potential MACE ( as further defined in the CVAC 
Charter) will be collected and the events will be adjudicated by the CVAC (as well as assessed by the DSMB) : 
• Cardiovascular death  
• Non-fatal myocardial infarction  
• Non-fatal stroke of all classifications  
• Transient ischemic attack  
• Hospitalization for unstable angina requiring unplanned revascularization 
• Non-fatal coronary revascularization procedures

All AEs that occur after the ICF is signed , regardless of severity, are to be recorded on the 
appropriate AE pages in the eCRF (either serious or nonserious) .  The Investigator should 
complete all the details requested including dates of onset, severity, action taken, outcome, 
and relationship to study treatment.  E ach event should be recorded separately.  
Investigators will be instructed to report to R -Pharm ’s designee their assessment of the 
potential relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure, studied disease state, study treatment, and/or drug delivery system via eCRF.  
Study site staff will record any dosage of study treatment that exceeds the assigned dosage in 
the protocol via eCRF.  
Any clinically significant findings from laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, other procedures, etc should be reported to R -Pharm ’s designee  via eCRF, EDC, and/or designated 
data transmission methods .  Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts 
when recording AEs on the AEs eCRF page, avoiding colloquialisms and abbreviations .  
Only 1  AE term should be recorded in the event field on the AEs eCRF page .  For AEs other 
than injection -related reactions, a diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the AEs eCRF 
page rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases) .  However, if a constellation of 
signs and/or sym ptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the AEs eCRF page .  If 
a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported AEs based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by 1 AE report based on the single diagnosis, 
with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.  
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity, seriousness , and potential relatedness to the 
study treatment.  T he action taken and the outcome must also be recorded in the AE page of 
the eCRF.

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  123 Confidential  7.6.5.1 Patient- Reported Outcome  Data  
Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data .  However, if any subject responses 
suggestive of a possible AE are identified during study site review of the PRO 
questionnaires, study site staff will alert the Investigator, who will determine if the criteria 
for an AE have been met and will document the outcome of this assessment in the subject's 
medical record per study site practice.  If the event meets the criteria for an AE, it will be 
reported on the AEs eCRF.  
7.6.5.2 Reporting of S erious Adverse Events  
All SAEs  that occur after the subject has signed the ICF , regardless of the Investigator ’s 
assessment on causality , must be recorded on the relevant  pages of the eCRF  and reported to 
R-Pharm according to  protocol requirements.  
Investigators must report the SAE within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the event .  All 
SAEs must be reported via the EDC system by completing the relevant eCRF pages in 
English .  In the event that the EDC system is not functioning, SAEs must be reported within 
24 hours of first becoming aware of the event using the back- up paper SAE report form 
(instructions provided in the Investigator binders) .  Once the EDC system is operating 
normally again, Investigators must enter the SAE in the eCRF pages .  All SAEs should be 
followed up until resolution or permanent outcome of the event or  until the event is otherwise 
explained .  The timelines and procedure for follow -up reports are the same as those for the 
initial report.  R -Pharm’s designee  is responsible for managing the safety database.  
R-Pharm will be alerted of all SAEs occurring dur ing a subject ’s follow -up regardless of the 
Investigator ’s assessment of causality .  SAEs occurring after a subject has received the last 
dose of study treatment will be collected  and report ed to R -Pharm ’s designee through the end 
of the Safety Follow -Up P eriod (i.e., for a period of 22 weeks after the last dose of study 
treatment ), regardless of the Investigator’s opinion of causality.  The Investigator must  also 
inform participating subjects of the need to inform the Investigator of any SAE that occurs within this period.  Any SAE with a start date after the Follow -Up Period is not required to 
be reported unless the Investigator thinks that an event may be related to either the study treatment , study treatment administration, or a protocol procedure.  
7.6.5.3 Repor ting of S erious Adverse Events  to Regulatory Authorities and 
Investigators  
R-Pharm ’s designee will be responsible for reporting all suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (SUSARs) and any other applicable SAEs to regulatory authorities, ethics comm ittees, and Investigators, in accordance with national regulations in the countries where 
the study is conducted.  Relative to the first awareness of the event by/or further provision to 
R-Pharm

Olokizumab  
Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  124 Confidential  R-Pharm ’s designee, SUSARs will be submitted within 7  days for fatal and life -threatening 
events and 15 days for other SUSARs, unless otherwise required by national regulations .  
R-Pharm ’s designee will also prepare an expedited report for other safety issues where these 
might materially alter the current benefit- risk assessment of OKZ or that would be sufficient 
to consider changes in the study treatment administration or in the overall conduct of the 
study .  The study  site will also forward a copy of all expedited reports to the relevant  
Independent Ethics Commit tee (IEC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with 
national regulations.  
7.6.5.4 Follow -up of A dverse Events  
Any AEs that occur after the subject has signed the ICF  until the end of the Safety 
Follow -Up Period (i.e., 22 weeks after the last dose of s tudy treatment ) will be followed up 
to resolution.  R esolution means that the subject has returned to a baseline state of health , the 
Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE , or the subject 
is lost to follow -up.  For AEs  with a causal relationship to the study treatment , R-Pharm or its 
designee must concur with the Investigator’s assessment. 
For SAEs, nonserious AESIs , and pregnancies, R -Pharm ’s designee  may follow -up by 
telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and 
outcome information (e.g., from hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, or autopsy 
reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case.  
7.6.5.5 Follow -up of S erious Ad verse Events by  the Investigator  
Any SAEs that occur after the subject has signed the ICF until the end of the Safety 
Follow -Up Period (i.e., 22 weeks after the last dose of study treatment ) regardless of the 
Investigator’s opinion of causality, will be followed up.  The Investigator should follow each 
SAE until the event has resolved to the baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as 
stable by the Investigator, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the subject withdraws consent .  
If the subject is lo st to follow -up, the SAE will be categorized based on the Investigator ’s last 
assessment .  Every effort should be made to follow all SAEs considered to be related to OKZ 
or study -related procedures until an outcome can be reported.  
During the study, resolution of SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the SAE page of 
the eCRF and in the subject ’s medical record to facilitate source data verification .  If, after 
follow -up, return to the baseline status or stabilization cannot be established, an expl anation 
should be recorded on the SAE page of the eCRF.  
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome.

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  125 Confidential  7.6.6 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Clinical laboratory tests will be reviewed for results of potential clinical significance at all 
time points throughout the study .  The Investigator will evaluate any change in laboratory 
values .  If the Investigator determines a laboratory abnormality to be clinically significant, it 
is considered a laboratory AE; however, if the abnormal laboratory value is consistent with a current diagnosis  (or signs or symptoms if a diagnosis is not possible)  and is not a clinically 
significant worsening from the baseline laboratory parameter , it should be documented 
accordingly without being r eported as a separate laboratory  AE.  The central laboratory will 
analyze the samples .  Further details of the procedures to be followed for sample collection, 
storage, and shipment will be documented in a Laboratory M anual .  Additional and repeat 
laborato ry testing not specified in Table 1 may be performed at the discretion of the 
Investigator either at the local lab oratory  or at the central lab oratory  to ensure that the safety 
of subjects is protected.  
7.6.6.1 Laboratory Parameters

general appearance, skin (including site of study treatment injection ), respiratory, CV , and 
GI. 
All significant findings that are present at Screening  must be reported on the relevant 
Medical H istory/C urrent Medical C onditions eCRF .  Significant findings made after 
randomization that meet the definition of an AE must be recorded on the AEs eCRF.  
7.6.7.2 Vital Signs  
Vital signs ( temperature, h eart rate, BP , and respiratory rate ) will be measured as indicated in 
Table 1, and when clinically indicated .  Whenever possible, vital sign assessments should be 
performed by the same study site staff member and using the same validated device(s) 
throughout the study .  Blood pressure and heart rate should be measured after the subject 
rests 5  minutes in a sitting position . 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an AE .  A vital sign result should be reported as 
an AE if it meets any of the following criteria:  
• Results in a change in RA treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or 
treatment discontinuation)  
• Results in a medical intervention or  a change in concomitant therapy  
• Clinically significant in the Investigator ’s judgment  
It is the Investigator ’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings .  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sig n abnormality should 
be classified as an AE.  
7.6.7.3 Body Weight  and Heigh t 
Body weight ( to the nearest 0.1  kilogram  [kg]) and h eight ( in cm) will be recorded at the time 
points specified in Table 1.  Body weight and h eight should be measured in indoor clothing 
without shoes .  Whenever possible, body weight measurement should be performed by the 
same study site staff member and using the  same validated scale throughout the study.   The 
subject ’s body mass index will be calculated automatically in the eCRF.  
7.6.7.4 Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12- lead ECG will be performed at the time points specified in Table 1.  
Subjects should rest in a supine position in a controlled, calm environment for at least 15 minutes prior to the recording and should be motionless during the recording.

abnormalities , including the baseline ECG, should be recorded on the AE e CRF page.  
All ECG  records  collected during the study  should have a printed cop y kept as a source 
document  at the study site  (if the ECG record is printed on thermal paper, a photocopy 
should be made).  
7.6.7.5 Evaluation of Chest X -ray 
A chest X -ray (both lateral a nd posteroanterior)  not older than 8 weeks evaluated and 
interpreted by a certified specialist at Screening  as part of Screening  procedures to confirm 
the absence of TB or other pulmonary infection will be acceptable; if no such chest X -ray is 
available, this should be performed.  The Investigator should consult with certified TB 
specialist or pulmonologist who is familiar with diagnosing and treating TB (as acceptable 
per local practice) , if required .  Films  available at Screening  and collected during the  study 
should be evaluated by a certified specialist and kept as source documents . 
7.6.8 Safety Monitoring 
R-Pharm ’s designee will monitor safety data throughout the course of the study .  The 
designee  will, as is appropriate, consult with a functionally independent subject safety , 
therapeutic area physician , or clinical scientist, and review trends, laboratory data, and AEs 
at periodic intervals.  
In the event that ongoing safety monitoring uncovers an issue that needs to be addressed by unblinding at the treatment group level, only members of the DSMB (an external advisory 
group for this study formed to protect the integrity of data) can conduct additional analyses 
of the safety data.  S ee also Section 7.6.4 for detail s regarding the DSMB.  
7.6.9 Tuberculosis Risk Questionnaire s 
The questionnaire s “Tuberculosis Risk Questionnaire  for Screening Visit ” and “Tuberculosis 
Risk Questionnaire for Post -Screening Visits”  (see Appendix 5 [ Section  13.5] ) should be 
used as source document s.  The questionna ire “Tuberculosis Risk Questionnaire for 
Screening Visit” will be completed at Visit 1 ( Screening ), and the questionnaire 
“Tuberculosis Risk Questionnaire for Post -Screening Visits” will be completed at Visits  7, 
10, 15, and SFU -2 as noted in Table 1.  
At the Screening Visit, if question No. 1 (Does the subject have a currently active TB disease 
or a history of active TB disease) or question No. 2 (Has the subject been in close contact

for Screening Visit” is answered  “Yes” the subject  is not allowed to enter the study (see 
exclusion  criterion No. 19, Section 5.3.2) .  A “Yes” response to any of the other questions 
within the questionnaire at Screening should trigger further careful assessment to determine 
the subject’s risk of TB disease.  
At all post -Screening visits , a “Yes” response on the “Tuberculosis Risk Questionnaire for 
Post-Screening Visits” should be treated as follows:  
• Question 1:  If a subject answers “Yes” study treatment should be discontinued if active 
TB is confirmed (see Section  6.11).  
• Questions 2 through 6:  If a subject answers “Yes” to any question, they should be 
assessed (TB risk questionnaire and physical examination) 12 weeks from the time of 
exposure to determine if the subject developed TB.  The Investigator should consult with a certified TB specialist or pulmonologist, if needed.  
• Questions 7 through 12:  If a subject answers “Yes” to any question, this should trigger a 
careful assessment to determine if the subject developed TB (see Section  7.6.10).  
This risk questionnaire s are not to be used to exclude TB disease or confirm diagnosi s. 
7.6.10 Management of T uberculosis  
Subjects who  develop evidence of latent or active TB once enrolled in the study (and 
receiving study treatment) must immediately discontinue further administration of study treatment , and the subject  should be examined by a certified TB specialist or pulmonologist 
who is familiar with diagnosing and treating TB (as acceptable per local practice) . 
If active TB is confirmed, the subject must permanently discontinue study treatment (see Section  6.11) .  Confirmed active TB is an SAE that  must be recorded on the relevant pages 
of the eCRF  and provided to the Sponsor in accordance with SAE reporting requirements.  
Details regarding follow -up of SAEs are provided in Section 7.6.5.5. 
If latent TB is confirmed, the subject may resume the administration of study treatment if 
they active T B is ruled out be a certified TB specialist or pulmonologist who is familiar with

According to the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) (CPMP/International Council 
for Harmonisation [ICH]/135/95), R -Pharm and R -Pharm ’s designee  are responsible for 
implementing and maintaining quality assurance and quality control systems with written 
standard operating procedures (SOPs).  
Quality control will be applied to each stage of data handling.  
The following steps will be taken to ensure the accuracy, consistency, completeness, and reliability of the data:  
• Investigator meetings  
• Central laboratories for clinical laboratory parameters  
• Study s ite initiation visit 
• Early  study  site visits after enrollment  
• Routine study site monitoring  
• Ongoing study site communication and training 
• Data management quality control checks  
• Continuous data acquisit ion and cleaning 
• Internal review of data  
• Quality control check of the final clinical study report  
In addition, R -Pharm ’s (or designee’ s) Clinical Quality Assurance Department may conduct 
periodic audits of the study processes, including study site, study s ite visits, central 
laboratories, vendors, clinical database, and final clinical study report .  When audits are 
conducted, access must be authorized for all study -related documents including medical 
history and concomitant medication documentation to R -Pharm’s designee and regulatory 
authorities.  
8.1 Monitoring  
R-Pharm ’s designee will perform all monitoring functions within this clinical study.  The 
designee’s monitors will work in accordance with established  SOPs and have the same rights 
and responsibilities as monitors from R -Pharm .  Monitors will establish and maintain regular

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  133 Confidential  contact between the Investigator and R -Pharm.   There will be both blinded and unblinded 
monitors, as appropriate.  
Monitors will evaluate the competence of each study site, informing R -Pharm about any 
problems relating to facilities, technical equipment, or medical staff .  During the study, 
monitors will check that written informed consent has been obtained from all subjects 
correctly and that data are recorded correctly and completely .  Monitors are also entitled to 
compare entries in eCRFs with corresponding source data and to inform the Investigator of 
any errors or omissions .  Monitors will also control adherence to the protocol at t he study 
site.  They will arrange for the supply of study treatment and ensure appropriate storage 
conditions are maintained. 
Monitoring visits will be conducted according to all applicable regulatory requirements and 
standards .  Regular monitoring visits will be made to each study site while subjects are 
enrolled in the study .  The monitor will make written reports to R -Pharm on each occasion 
contact with the Investigator is made, regardless of whether it is by phone or in person.  
During monitoring visits,  entries in the eCRFs will be compared with the original source 
documents (source data verification) .  Please refer to the Monitoring Plan for further details . 
Data Management/Coding  
Data generated within this clinical study will be handled according to the relevant SOPs of the Data Management and Biostatistics departments of R -Pharm ’s designee . 
An EDC system will be used for this study, meaning that all eCRF data will be entered in electronic forms at the study site .  Data collection will be completed by authorized study site 
staff designated by the Investigator .  Appropriate training and security measures will be 
completed with the Investigator and all authorized study site staff prio r to the study being 
initiated and any data being entered into the system for any study subjects.  
All data must be entered in English .  The eCRFs should always reflect the latest observations 
on the subjects participating in the study .  Therefore, the eCRFs are to be completed as soon 
as possible during or after the subject ’s visit .  To avoid interobserver variability, every effort 
should be made to ensure that the same individual who made the initial baseline 
determinations completes all efficacy and s afety evaluations .  The Investigator must verify 
that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct .  If some assessments are not done, 
or if certain information is not available or not applicable or unknown, the Investigator should indicate this in the eCRF .  The Investigator will be required to electronically sign off 
on the clinical data .

The eCRF will be compared with the source documents to ensure that there  are no 
discrepancies between critical data.  A ll entries, corrections , and alterations are to be made by 
the responsible Investigator or his/her designee .  The monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs .  
Once clinical data of the eCRF have been submitted to the central server, corrections to the 
data fields will be audit trailed, meaning that the reason for change, the name of the person 
who performed the change, together with time and date will be logged.  R oles and rights of 
the study site staff responsible  for entering the clinical data into the eCRF will be determined 
in advance .  If additional corrections are needed, the responsible monitor or Data Manager 
will raise a query in the EDC application .  The appropriate study site staff will answer 
queries sen t to the Investigator .  This will be audit trailed by the EDC application meaning 
that the name of study site  staff, time and date stamp are captured.  
The eCRF is essentially considered a data entry form and should not constitute the original 
(or source) medical records unless otherwise specified .  Source documents are all documents 
used by the Investigator or hospital that relate to the subject ’s medical history, that verify the 
existence of the subject, the inclusion and exclusion criteria , and all recor ds covering the 
subject ’s participation in the study .  They include laboratory notes, ECG results, memoranda, 
pharmacy dispensing records, subject files, etc.  
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining source documents .  These will be made 
available f or inspection by the monitor at each monitoring visit.  T he Investigator must 
submit a completed eCRF for each subject who receives study treatment, regardless of 
duration.  A ll supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as laboratory or 
hospit al records, should be clearly identified with the study and subject number .  Any 
personal information, including subject name, should be removed or rendered illegible to preserve individual confidentiality.  
Electronic case report form records will be autom atically appended with the identification of

9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
Given that the study would be considered successful if at least 1  of the 2 OKZ dose regimens  
is shown to be efficacious and that a priori both OKZ dose regimens are assumed to be 
efficacious, disjunctive power (i.e., a probability of detecting a significant treatment effect 
for at least 1  OKZ treatment regimen) will be used as a criterion for the estimation of the 
sample size . 
Sample size requirements are calculated to provide sufficient disjunctive power to evaluate 
the primary endpoint ( superiority of OKZ relative to placebo with respect to 
ACR20  response rate at Week 12 ) and the first secondary endpoint ( superiority of OKZ 
relative to placebo with respect to the proportion of subjects with DAS28  [CRP] <3.2 at 
Week 12 ). 
Sample size was es timated taking into account a multiplicity control procedure and the 
resulting α  adjustment to control an overall Type  I error rate in the strong sense at a 1- sided  
α = 0.025 across the primary and secondary endpoints .  More specifically, the α -control 
strategy will be based on using the Bonferroni adjustment for the tests related to each of the 
2 OKZ dose  regimen s versus placebo (i.e., using the 1- sided  α = 0.0125 for each dose) .  A 
gate-keeping strategy will be used for tests associated with the primary a nd secondary 
endpoints for each OKZ dose regimen independently, with a fixed order of hypothesis tests 
for the primary and secondary endpoints within each OKZ dose  regimen . 
Sample size was estimated based on simulation that implemented the above α adjustme nt and 
gate-keeping procedure including the primary endpoint of ACR20 response rate at Week 12  
and the first secondary endpoint . 
Based on this simulation, an adequate sample size was selected to provide sufficient 
disjunctive power for the primary endpoint  and the first secondary endpoint based on 
DAS28  (CRP ) <3.2 rate at Week 12 .  For the first secondary endpoint, the disjunctive power 
represents a probability of establishing a significant treatment effect for 1  or 2 OKZ dose 
regimens for the primary endpoint and a significant treatment effect for 1  or 2 OKZ dose 
regimens for the first secondary endpoint, conditional on the fact that each dose regimen 
tested for the secondary endpoint must have null hypothesis previously rejected for the primary endpoint based on  a fixed order of testing as per the gate- keeping procedure.  
Treatment ef fect assumptions used in the simulation -based sample size calculations involving 
the primary and the first  secondary endpoint are as follows.

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  137 Confidential  The ACR20 response rate at Week 12  for the placebo group is estimated to be 2 0% in this 
study population ( Emery et al, 2008; Burmester et al, 2013; Genovese et al, 2014) .  The OKZ 
ACR20  response rates  for 64 mg q4w and q2w  treatment groups  at Week 12  are expected to 
be at least 45%  and 50% , respectively , resulting in an expected difference in 
ACR20  response rates of 25  and 30 percentage points between the respective OKZ treatment 
groups  and placebo.  
The DAS28  low disease activity (based on DAS28  [CRP] <3.2) response rate at Week 12  is 
estimated to be 5% in the placebo group (Emery et al, 2008; Cohen et  al, 2006) and 18% and 
21% in 64 mg q4w a nd q2w  OKZ groups , respectively , resulting in an expected difference of 
13 and 16 percentage points between respective OKZ groups  and placebo.  
The references cited above for ACR20 and DAS28 response rates are assumed to reflect 
approximately 10% of subjects discontinuing randomized treatment prior to Week 12 .  In this 
study, subjects who discontinue prior to Week 12  will be classified as nonresponders  for the 
primary endpoint of  the ACR20  response rate at Week 12  and for the secondary endpoint of 
DAS28  (CRP ) <3.2 at Week 12 .  Details regarding subjects who discontinue treatment and/or 
study participation prematurely can be found in Section 9.4.9. 
The primary endpoint as well as the secondary endpoints that are binary in nature will be 
analyzed using a 2 ×2 chi -squared test for equality of proportions for each OKZ treatment 
group compared with placebo.  A continuity correction may be used if the expected cell 
counts are <5.  
Based on the treatment effect assumptions and the methodology for estimating sample size 
via simulation to ensure sufficien t disjunctive power as described above, a sample size of 
350 subjects randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio (140, 140, and 70 subjects per group, respectively) 
will yield 99% disjunctive power for testing the primary hypothesis (ACR20 at Week 12 ) and 
82% disjunctive power for the evaluation of the secondary endpoint of DAS28 (CRP) 
<3.2 rate at Week 12 .

A Kaplan -Meier plot of time to treatment discontinuation in each tre atment sequence group 
will be presente d, where the time to treatment discontinuation will be calculated as the 
number of days from randomization at Baseline to the last dose of study treatment (regardless 
of any switch from placebo to OKZ).  Subjects who c omplete the Treatment Period as

Prior and concomitant medications will be separately summarized as the number and 
percentage of subjects by World Health Organization (WHO) drug class, preferred name, and 
treatment  sequence group .  Medications will be coded using the WHO Drug dictionary, 
Anato mic Therapeutic Class (ATC) level 2, and preferred drug name.  
Prior medications will be distinguished from concomitant medications by a stop date before the first dose of the study treatment.  M edications that stopped on the same date as the first 
dose of the study treatment will be considered a prior medication .  Any medication that a 
subject started before the first dose of double -blind study treatment and continued to take 
during the study, and any medication that the subject began taking after the first  dose of 
study treatment will be classified as concomitant.  
Medications administered as rescue medication  (as described in S ection  6.13.3) will also be 
summarized as the number and percentage of subjects by WHO drug class, preferred name, and treatment  sequence group. 
9.4.5 Exposure and Compliance  
Exposure to study treatment and compliance will be summarized descriptively by treatment sequence group (see Section 9.4) for the Safety population. 
For a given study period, e xposure to double -blind study treatment will be calculated as the 
number of doses received during the study period for each respective treatment sequence group.  Duration of exposure will be defined as the total number of days a subject was 
exposed to study treatment  in the appropriate period, calculated as : 
Date of last dose  in study period – D ate of first dose  in study period +  1 day 
Overall compliance (expressed as a percentage)  will be calculated as :

Each of the OKZ treatment groups  (64 mg q2w and 64 mg q4w) will be compared with 
placebo for each of the primary, secondary, and other endpoints . 
The overall Type I error rate will be controlled for testing hypotheses of the primary and 
secondary endpoints at the overall 1- sided  α = 0.025. 
The α-control strategy will be based on using the Bonferroni adjustment for the tests related 
to each of the 2  OKZ dose  regimen s versus placebo (i.e., using the 1 -sided  α = 0.0125 for 
each dose) .  A gate-keeping strategy will be used for tests associated with the primary and 
secondary endpoints for each OKZ dose regimen independently with the same order of 
testing  as the secondary endpoints defined above .  In other words, each OKZ dose regimen 
will be tested at 1- sided  α = 0.0125 for a given endpoint if null hypotheses are rejected at 
1-sided  α = 0.0125 for this dosing regimen for all previous endpoints based on the 
established order .  Conversely, the testing will stop for a given OKZ dose regimen at the 
endpoint for which the null hypothesis is accepted at 1- sided  α = 0.0125.  
The above multiplicity control procedure will be applied to the primary analysis of the 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints  based on the ITT population, and will not be 
applied to the sensitivity analyses of these endpoints. 
9.4.7 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects achieving an ACR20 response 
and remaining on randomized treatment and in the study at Week 12 , analyzed using the 
ITT population as the primary efficacy analysis .  Supportive analyses of the primary endpoint 
will also be done using the mITT, if sufficiently different from the ITT pop ulation, and 
PP populations.  
The ACR20 response at Week 12  for each of the OKZ 64 mg treatment groups  (q2w and 
q4w) will be compared with placebo using a 2× 2 chi -squared test for equality of proportions . 
The overall Type I error rate will be controlled using a procedure in the strong sense at a 1-sided  α = 0.025 for testing multiple hypotheses for the 2 OKZ treatment groups versus 
placebo across the primary and secondary endpoints as described in Section 9.4.6. 
As a supportive analysis, the difference between proportions of responders in each of the 
OKZ treatment groups and placebo (relative risk) wil l be estimated together with the 
corresponding 97.5% 2 -sided confidence interval for difference of proportions using the 
Newcombe hybrid score method .

secondary endpoints is described in Section 9.4.6.  
Missing data  and data collected after premature study treatment discontinuation  will be  
handled as described in Section 9.4.9.

remain on study and be evaluated as per the planned S chedule of Events .  For the main 
analysis of all binary endpoints, inability to remain on randomized treatment through the time 
point of interest is defined as treatment failure (nonresponse) .  For the main analysis of 
continuous endpoints, subjects who discontinue randomized treatment prematurely but remain on study thro ugh the time point of interest will be included using all collected 
measurements , including those from  assessments after treatment discontinuation .

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  144 Confidential  Missing Data Resulting from Study Withdrawal  
The main method for handling missing data resulting from prema ture withdrawal of a subject 
from the study will be based on a clinical approach where no  treatment benefit will be 
attributed to study treatment at any time point after study withdrawal, if the subject was 
unable to complete the study for the planned dura tion. 
Therefore, for all binary endpoints, all subjects who discontinue prematurely, regardless of 
reason, will be considered as nonresponders  with respect to the definition of the 
corresponding endpoint . 
Similarly, for all endpoints that are continuous in nature, a return to baseline values will be assumed and will be implemented using a multiple imputation  (MI)  methodology  allowing to 
account for the uncertainly of missing data according to the methodolog y of Rubin 
(Rubin, 1987) .  Imputed values will be sampled from a posterior Bayesian distribution of the 
baseline values of each continuous parameter (for all treatment groups combined) using a 
regression imputation model with age, sex, time from RA diagnosis to first study dose, and 
duration of prior MTX t reatment as predictor variables .  Multiply imputed data will be 
analyzed with an ANCOVA model  and the results will be combined using the Rubin’ s rule 
(Rubin, 1987) .  Additional details will be provided in the SAP.  
Intermediate Missing Data  
Missing data may also result from missed intermediate visits for subjects who completed the 
study .  For all binary endpoints, missing intermediate responder status will be imputed from 
the surrounding visits .  If the status at visits both before and after the missed visit is classified 
as responder, the subject will be considered a responder at the missed visit .  Otherwise, the 
subject will be considered a nonresponder .  If an assessment for a given binary endpoint at 
the last visit is missing for a completing subject, data from the 2  previous visits will be used 
with the same logic for determining the response status .  For the ACR20/50/70 endpoints, if 
only some components of the response criteria are missing but the available components 
allow classifying the subject as a responder, the responder category will be used.  O therwise, 
the method based on surrounding visits as described above will be applied.   Similarly, for all 
continuous endpoints, an average of values from the surrounding visits will be imputed for the missing visit.   For placebo subjects completing treatment through Week 16, if the 
assessment at Week 16 is missing, the 2  previous visits will be u sed as surrounding visits.

Sensitivity to Data Following Premature Discontinuation of Randomized Treatment  
Supportive analyses will be performed to assess the effect of Standard of Care treatmen t that 
the subject s may receive after premature discontinuation of randomized treatment while the 
subjects remain on study and continue to be evaluated. 
In this supportive analysis, all binary efficacy endpoints will be defined regardless of 
adherence to r andomized treatment through the time point of interest.  D efinitions will be 
based on the criteria of achieving the corresponding clinical response (e.g., ACR20) using all 
data collected at the time point of interest, i.e., including data collected after premature 
discontinuation of randomized treatment .  Subjects who discontinue from the study overall, 
will be considered nonresponders  at time points after study discontinuation.  
For the supportive analysis of continuous endpoints, data collected after premature 
discontinuation of randomized treatment will be excluded and replaced with values imputed based on the return to baseline approach implemented with MI as described in Section  9.4.9.1. 
These supportive analyses will be performed for all efficacy  endpoints . 
Sensitivity to Missing Data Assumptions   
The method of handling missing data that considers discontinued subjects as nonresponders  
or imputes continuous data with baseline values may be regarded as not conservative if the proportion of subjects dropping out is greater in the placebo group than in the OKZ groups .  
To address the possibility of this scenario, an alter native strategy will be used to stress -test 
the analysis  of the efficacy endpoints . 
Analysis of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be repeated using all collected 
data (including data after premature study treatment discontinuation) but with missing data 
after study withdrawal  (for subjects withdrawing prior to Week 12 ) imputed under the 
following assumptions .  Missing post study withdrawal data for subjects discontinuing from 
the placebo group will be imputed under the assumption of the missing -at-random ( MAR ) 
mechanism, where these discontinued subjects are assumed to have postwithdrawal values in 
line with similar placebo subjects who remained in the study, taking into account their values observed prior to discontinuation.  F or subjects discontinuing from the OKZ treatment 
groups , missing postwithdrawal data will be imputed from the same MAR -based imputation 
model estimated from the placebo subjects, assuming that after discontinuation, the OKZ subjects will drift towards the mean response of the placebo group.  T his approach is likely to

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  146 Confidential  result in more favorable imputations for the placebo group compared with the 
nonresponder/return to baseline assumption, while for the OKZ treatment groups , it will not 
assume a treatment effect beyond the study effect and the effect of the background MTX 
therapy .  This approach will be more conservative compared with  the primary analysis if the 
proportion of subjects discontinuing from the study  is greater in the placebo group than in the 
OKZ treatment groups . 
This approach will be implemented with MI  using 2 steps , with both steps using only data 
collected up to Week 12 .  First, intermediate missing data of each continuous parameter will 
be multiply imputed under the MAR assumption within each treatment group using a multivariate normal imputation model and the Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) metho d.  
Second, intermediate missing d ata imputed in this way will then be used together with 
observed data for the estimation of the MAR -based model from the placebo grou p, which 
will be done using sequential regression imputation models applied to each continuous 
parameter  (Ratitch  et al, 2013) .  The MAR -based placebo imputation model for each 
parameter will be estimated based on data from placebo subjects and will include baseline 
value of the corresponding parameter and all postbaseline values prior to study 
discontinuation as explanatory variables .  Poststudy discontinuation missing values up to 
Week 12  in all 3  treatment groups  will then  be imputed from this single placebo imputation 
model. 
Binary endpoints will then be computed from the multiply imputed data  regardless of 
adherence to randomized treatm ent through the time point of interest based on the criteria of 
achieving the corresponding clinical response .  Multiply imputed datasets will be analyzed 
using the same methods as in the primary analysis, followed by combining the results using 
Rubin’ s rule (Rubin, 1987).  
Additionally, for the primary and secondary endpoints that are binary in nature, a tipping 
point analysis will be performed.  F irst, binary response status at the time point of interest 
will be computed using  all collected data regardless of adherence to randomized treatment 
through the time point of interest based on the criteria of achieving the corresponding clinical response .  For subjects who withdraw from the study overall , all possible combinations of t he 
number of responders and nonresponders  in each treatment group will be considered.  T he 
results of analysis for all possible combinations will be summarized graphically , depicting a 
boundary between combinations that result in a statistically significan t treatment effect vs not 
statistically significant.  C linical plausibility of the combinations on the boundary will be 
discussed in the c linical s tudy r eport  to evaluate the robustness of study conclusions to

Amendment 1 .1 (United States) : 28 May 2018  147 Confidential  For the secondary endpoint that measures physical ability based on the HAQ -DI 
improvement at Week 12 , a continuous responder analysis will also be performed.  S ubjects 
will be considered responders at a specified improvement threshold if they experience 
percent age improvement in the HAQ -DI score from baseline to Week 12  that is greater or 
equal to the specified threshold and if they remain on the randomized treatment and in the study through Week 12 .  This analysis will be performed for a range of improvement 
thresholds from 0%  to 100% in 5% increments .  The results will summarized using a graph 
of proportion of responders in each treatment group versus improvement thresholds. 
Sensitivity to Data Following Initiation of Rescue Medication  
Sensitivity analyses classifying subjects who receive any rescue medication  as nonresponders 
will be performed for binary efficacy endpoints defined at time points from Week 16 to Week  24. 
9.4.10 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Pharmacokinetic concentrations for OKZ in plasma will be summarized descriptively by 
scheduled collection time and dose regimen.  Time to steady  state will be graphically 
evaluated for the OKZ trough data collected over the study period.  Olokizumab 
concentrations from placebo subjects who are ran domized to receive OKZ starting at 
Week  16 will be summarized separately and will not be part of the time to steady state 
evaluation.  Pharmacokinetic relationships will be explored graphically and with linear or nonlinear modeling approaches, as appropria te.  Data collected in this study may be 
combined with data from other OKZ studies in support of population PK analyses.  
The related endpoints are described in in Section 4.4.  Further details for the PK analysis will be provided in the SAP . 
9.4.11 PK/PD Correlations  
The PK/PD relationship and immunogenicity of OKZ will be determined as described in the endpoints by Section 4.5.  Analyses may include statistical comparisons and/or population PK/PD analyses.  Further details for evaluation of PK/PD and PK/safety correlations will be 
provided in the SAP  or a separate population PK/PD analysis plan.  
9.4.12 Immunogenicity  
Immunogenicity results , including overall ADA results ( Screening , confirmatory, and titers, 
as appropriate), neutralizing ADA results, and the time course of ant ibodies (defined as the 
time to first observation of a positive ADA response) will be listed .  The number and

may be summarized by treatment group using appropriate descriptive statistics.  
9.4.13 Pharmacogenetics  
The exploratory PG studies are designed to investigate the association between genetic 
factors (genotypes) and clinical assessments (phenotypes) which are collected during the 
clinical trial.  Without prior evidence of a strong association, a number of possible 
associations are evaluated with exploratory analyses.  A range of statistical tests (chi -square 
tests, ANCOVAs, li near and logistic regression) are used for the an alyses.  Additional data  
from subsequent clinical trials are often needed to confirm associations.  Alternatively, if the number of subjects enrolled in the study is  too small to complete proper statistical analyses, 
these data may be combined, as appropriate, with those from other studies to enlarge the data 
set for analysis.  
9.4.14 Biomarkers  
Soluble marker panel studies investigate differences in the level of expression of proteins or 
peptides between individuals  in a given biofluid.  The goal of such studies is to allow the 
identification of potential protein or peptide biomarkers of drug action or disease, and to better understand the associated underlying molecular mechanisms.  By applying statistical analysis methods (e.g., principal component analysis) between subject groups, distinct study 
time points, or between study groups from other clinical trials, it may be possible to identify 
patterns which are associated with disease state or response to drug treatme nt.  However, the 
exact type of data analysis method will depend on the type of data obtained in the study and 
thus the analysis of this data will be data driven.  
9.4.15 Safety Analyses  
Analysis of safety endpoints (see Section 4.6) will be done based on the S afety population.  
Subjects in the S afety population will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually 
received , using the treatment sequence g roups described in Section 9.4.  A dditionally to the 
primary safety analysis , the incidence of AEs  will be analyzed separately for subjects 
administered additional DMARD s as rescue medication during the Treatment Period  and for 
subjects not receiving additional DMARDs as rescue medication.  
Additional summaries will be provided for changes from the last  value prior to Week 16 
dosing to time points after Week 16 dosing for subjects switching from placebo to OKZ at Week 16.

9.4.15.1 Adverse Events  
All AEs will be analyzed in terms of descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis .  Adverse 
events will be listed for each su bject and summarized by SOC and PT according to the most 
recent  version of the MedDRA.  In addition, summaries of AEs by severity  (evaluated using 
the CTCAE version 4.0)  and relationship to study treatment will be presented .  All safety and 
tolerability da ta recorded during the study will be listed and summarized by treatment 
sequence group, and over time, as appropriate.  Additionally to the  primary safety analysis , 
the incidence of AEs  will be analyzed separately for subjects administered additional 
DMARD as rescue medication during the Treatment Period  and for subjects not receiving 
additional DMARDs as rescue medication . 
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as AEs that first occur  or wo rsen in severity after the 
first administration of the study treatment.  For placebo subjects initiating OKZ treatment at Week  16, AEs will be summarized as follows :  AEs that occur after the first administration 
of placebo and prior to any administration of OKZ at or after Week 16 will be summarized as 
treatment -emergent under placebo treatment; AEs that occur  after the first administration of 
OKZ at or after Week 16 will be summarized as treatment- emergent under OKZ treatment.  
Adverse event summaries wil l include incidence of TEAEs, SAEs including deaths, AEs that 
led to study treatment discontinuation, and AEs by maximum severity and relationship to 
study treatment.  A ll summaries will be presented by the MedDRA SOC and PT for each 
treatment sequence group.

Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled:  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both ( e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or  flushing, swollen 
lips-tongue -uvula)  AND AT LEAST 1 OF THE FOLLOWING  
a. Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced 
PEF, hypoxe mia) 
b. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end- organ dysfunction (e.g., hypotonia 
[collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for 
that patient (minutes to several hours):  
a. Involvement  of the skin- mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen 
lips-tongue -uvula)  
b. Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced 
PEF, hypoxemia)  
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):  
a. Infants and children:   low systolic BP (age specific) or greater th an 30% decrease 
in systolic BP
a 
b. Adults:   systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that 
person’s baseline  
Abbreviations :  BP  = blood pressure ; PEF = peak expiratory flow.  
a.  Low systolic BP for children is defined as less than 70 mm Hg from 1 month to 1 year, less than (70 mm Hg+[2×age]) 
from 1 to 10 years, and less than 90 mm Hg from 11 to 17 years.

Changes have been made to the original protocol.  Based on the information presented in this 
amendment, there are no changes to th e risk profile of olokizumab (OKZ).  
This amendment is specific to the United States  (US) . 
The protocol originally specified that study sites in the US would receive placebo from a single  supplier.  However, d ue to a n unforeseen disruption in the supply cha in for the 
specified supplier , the protocol has been amended  to accom modate  alternative suppliers  of 
placebo for study sites  in the US . 
Individual revisions to the protocol  are summarized below, with new  text presented in

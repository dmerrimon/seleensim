IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/02/2018   General Information  
 
The optimal strategy for providing effective and safe pain management after traumatic 
injury remains unknown. Although opioids have been a mainstay for pain management for 
decades, they have been increasingly re cognized to be related to increased adverse events, 
increased costs and resource utilization, long -term dependence or addiction, and death. While 
opioid -minimizing, multi -modal analgesic strategies are promising, there is no high -quality 
evidence to guide their use or implementation. The proposed project is a randomized 
comparative effectiveness study of current pain management strategies in acutely injured trauma 
patients. A parallel group, randomized trial of two different multi -modal, opioid minimizing 
analgesic strategies will be performed and analyzed using Bayesian statistics.  
 
 
Background Information  
 
Opioid prescribing 
practices after traumatic 
injuries and surgeries are a 
significant driver of the 
current opioid epidemic.  
Over the last two decades, 
75% of patients s eeking 
treatment for heroin 
addiction were introduced to 
opioids via prescription 
drugs.[1]  
In particular, 
surgeons have a high rate of 
opioid prescribing (36.5%), 
second only to pain 
medicine specialists.[2] The 
incidence of persistent 
opioid use in opioi d-naïve 
patients after minor and  
major surgery is 6%, although rates can range as high as 24% in surgical sub -specialties such as 
orthopedics.[3, 4] Furthermore, the link between prescription opioids and transition to heroin 
has resulted in a significant r ise in opioid -related deaths, which are now more common than 
deaths due to motor vehicle -related injuries ( Figure 1 ).[5] 
Pain control after trauma must be timely and effective in order to allow patients earlier 
mobilization and improved functional status. Due to their injuries, 59% of trauma patients 
experience moderate to severe pain and, in 73% of patients, this pain interferes with activity 
during their acute hospitalization.[6] Pain control after traumatic injury must also be safe.  
Traditionally, pain r egimens have relied on the administration of narcotics; however opioid - 
based analgesic strategies are associated with significant short - and long -term adverse 
consequences. In the short -term, opioid -related adverse events include respiratory failure, urin ary

may result. In addition, adequacy of pain control as measured by pain scores is increasingly 
being used as a patient -centered outcome and evidence suggests that there is a lack of equity in 
pain management based on socioeconomic status, race, age, and gender.[8 -10] While multi - 
modal analgesia is a promising strategy to reduce opioid use, it is unknown if this is the most 
efficient and cost -effective strategy for post -trauma pain control.  
 
Preliminary Data  
 
Multi -modal analgesic regimens have sought to minimize reliance on opioids for pain 
control by utilizing combinations of medications from different drug classes including non - 
steroidal an ti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), gabapentinoids, weak mu agonists, and central 
prostaglandin inhibitors. In 2013, our trauma service introduced a multi -modal analgesic 
regimen. Traumatically injured patients were immediately started on scheduled pain medica tions 
from each of the different drug classes. While this idea of a multi -modal strategy decreased mean 
opioid use in morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per patient per day ( Table 1 ), there was 
and continues to be significant heterogeneity in the actual regimens prescribed by surgeons.

Objectives  
 
Aim 1: To perform a parallel group, randomized controlled trial comparing two 
multimodal pain strategies on clinical outcomes, patient -reported outcomes, and 
resource utilization  
Aim 2: To better understand the effect of the different multi -modal strategies by 
evaluating heterogeneity of treatment effect by performing hypothesis -testing and 
hypothesis -generating subgroup analyses to identify characteristics associated 
with the need for one strategy over the  other

Setting  
This study will be conducted at the Texas Trauma Institute at Memorial Hermann  
Hospital -Texas Medical Center (MHH -TMC). It is one of two Level 1 trauma centers in the 
Houston metropolitan area, an area in which over 6 million people reside, and is the busi est 
trauma center in the country, with approximately 2,000 admissions to the adult Trauma Service 
per year.  
 
Time Period  
IRB submission for the study will occur in December 2017. Enrollment of eligible 
patient will begin in April 2018 and continue for 12 m onths.  
 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-18-0036 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/02/2018   Outcomes  
The primary outcome of the study is opioid use per day until discharge or 30 days post 
admission (whichever is sooner), calculated by tallying the MME of all opioids received and 
dividing by the number of days hospitalized. This outcome captures the effect iveness of the 
combined non -opioid medications in not only achieving pain control but also in reducing opioid 
administration.  
 
The secondary outcomes of the study include:  
 Pain scores until discharge or 30 days post 
admission (whichever is sooner): an aver age 
will be calculated of the average daily numeric 
rating scale of pain (0=no pain, 10=worst 
pain).  
o Pain scores are currently recorded by 
nursing staff at standard intervals based 
upon the patient’s level of  care.  
o The numeric rating scale of pain is already 
assessed by nurses multiple times per day 
at hospitals across the United States, 
including Memorial Hermann Hospital - 
Texas Medical Center, and will not require 
additional training or man power to  collect.  
 Discha rge from the hospital with an  opioid 
prescription  
 Incidence of opioid -related complications, 
such as ileus, aspiration, unplanned  intubation, 
unplanned admission to an intensive care unit, 
and use of an opioid -reversal  agent.  
o Until discharge or 30 days pos t admission (whichever is  sooner)  
o Measures of  safety  
o Some of these complications are already recorded by the Trauma  Quality 
Improvement Project (TQIP) and the hospital as a core  measure.  
 Costs: overall and pharmacy  costs  
 Lengths of stay: ventilator -/hospit al-/ICU -free days 
 Measures of function that may be limited by pain, such as percent of predicted daily 
incentive spirometry volumes (which is based on ideal body weight) and failure to 
work with physical therapy due to pain (until discharge or 30 days post  admission 
[whichever is  sooner])

patient care aspects other than the randomization to multimodal treatment strategy will follow 
the MHH -TMC policies a nd guidelines.  
 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Patients will be excluded if they are a pediatric patient (<16 years), pregnant, or a 
prisoner. Additionally, patients placed in observation (i.e. not admitted to the hospital) will be 
excluded. While certain pa tients may have contraindications for select drug classes (e.g. NSAID 
contraindicated in acute kidney injury, tramadol contraindicated in patients with seizures, 
acetaminophen contraindicated in Child’s C cirrhosis), patients will not be excluded based on 
these individual drug contraindications. Randomization should balance these patients in both 
treatment strategies.  
If a patient meets inclusion criteria without any exclusion criteria, they will be 
randomized  in the Emergency  Department  so that medications  can be ordered  and administered 
as quickly as  possible.  
 
Study  Procedures  
 
Randomization  
Allocation will occur through sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes kept in the 
research assistants’ office in the emergency department. Envelopes will be opened up on trauma 
resident writing admission orders in the Emergency Department An independent statistician will 
determine the randomization sequence and oversee the labeling of cards and envelopes.  
Randomization will be stratified by unit of admission (ICU, IMU, floor).  
 
Data Collection  
Data collection will occur by one of two methods: manual entry or automatic capture of 
data. Data points to be collected are detailed in Supplement One.  
Supplement One also indicates the manner by which data points will be collected – 
manually, from National Trauma Data Base registry, or automatic capture from the electronic 
medical record.  
 
Follow up  
No study -specific follow -up will be required.  
 
Statisti cs 
Sample  Size 
The function of this preliminary study is to provide the most precise, unbiased estimate of 
treatment effect possible. The precision of this estimate is largely a function of sample size. As 
such our goal is to conduct the largest feasible s tudy in a 12 month period upon which to base 
these estimates. We believe we will be able to enroll 75% of admissions to the trauma service, 
which would be approximately 1,506 patients in the 12 month period.

to the adult trauma surgery service are: 1,974 (FY 2015), 2,022 (FY 
2016), and 2,026 (FY 2017). This equates to 167 pat ients admitted per 
month.

Data Analysis Plan  
We plan a Bayesian statistical approach for three reasons:  
 
1) At an early stage in the development and implementation of an intervention, 
investigators must decide whether to invest further time and resources on a specific 
approach given the data they have thus far observed. Fundamentally, this requires 
evaluation of  the probability that the alternative hypothesis is true (i.e. the probability that 
an effect of some magnitude exists). Frequentist approaches to statistical reasoning do not 
directly estimate the probability of the alternative hypothesis, focusing instea d on the 
rejection of the  null; 
2) Bayesian approaches combine any salient prior information with the observed data to 
form a posterior distribution which then captures the current state of the evidence for the 
probability that an effect of some magnitude exi sts. This posterior distribution may then 
function as an empirically derived, informative prior that provides information in the 
evaluation of subsequent samples. This permits the analyses from the current project to 
inform the design and analysis of subse quent  studies;  
3) the process of updating a prior with data provides a mechanism for  continued 
monitoring of an established program for quality control  purposes.  
 
The following data analytic approach applies to evaluation Aims 1 and 2, though we 
present it on ly once to conserve space. Broadly, the data analytic strategy will use generalized 
linear  multilevel  modeling  with level -two random  effects  to account  for clustering  of participants 
within site and, where applicable, observations within participants. Modeling will use R v. 3.4 
and Stan v. 1.10.[11, 12]. Initial analyses examining group differences for baseline variables will 
use cross -tabulation, ANOVA’s, and examination of correlations between baseline variables and 
specified outcomes. For the purposes of evaluating the comparability of groups, a posterior 
probability of > 95% will constitute evidence for statistically reliable differences. Baseline or 
demographic variabl es on which group differences are detected and which are correlated with 
outcomes meet the definition of confounders and will result in two sets of analyses: one in which 
the relevant variable is included as a covariate and one in which it is not.[13, 14] This will 
permit determination of the degree to which any group differences might confound conclusions 
regarding  treatment.  
All analyses will be conducted on an intention -to-treat basis. Bayesian approaches will 
implement joint modeling of observed outcome s and the missing data which is robust to 
ignorable missingness (i.e., MCAR and MAR).[15] Sensitivity analyses will evaluate robustness 
of analytic conclusions to missing data. Non -ignorable missing data patterns will be addressed 
through pattern -mixture m odeling methods.[16] Convergence of Bayesian analyses on the 
posterior distributions via Monte -Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) will be assessed via graphical  60% 1,204

evidence. Evaluation of posterior distributions will permit statements regarding the probability 
that effects of varying magnitudes exist, given the data. Specification of diffuse, neutral priors 
will reflect the initial uncertainty regarding effect sizes . For all generalized linear multilevel 
models, priors for regression coefficients will be specified as ~Normal (µ=0, σ2=10) on the 
identity or log -scale depending upon the model, level one error variances will be specified as  
~Half -T (df = 3, mean = 0, st andard deviation = 100). Prior distribution for level two variances 
will use ~Half -T (df = 3, mean = 0, standard deviation = 10). Priors for the comparison of 
proportions will be specified as ~Beta (α=0.5, β=0.5). For all subgroup analyses using multilevel  
models the approach will follow that used in Tyson, et al.[17]  
 
Ethics  
 
Due to the acute clinical status of the trauma patient population (intubation, intoxication, 
severe pain), it is often not feasible to obtain truly informed consent from a patient or legally 
authorized representative (LAR) before pain medications are prescribed. Therefore, we will use 
delayed consent. The patient will be randomized and enrolled prior to consent.  
Once the patient is enrolled, a member of the trauma research team will make attempts to 
contact either the patient or LAR to obtain consent for this study. Consents will be obtained by 
trained research personnel Monday through Friday during the day. If a consent needs to be 
obtained on the weeknight or weekend, research personnel will be available. Once appropriate to 
approach the patient for consent, a study team member will explain the study, its implications for 
the patient, and give the patient written  study information. Additionally, an educational pamphlet 
on safe opioid use will be given to the patient.  
If the subject consents to participation, they will sign the consent document. If the subject 
refuses, data collection will stop at time of refusal.  
Due to the high enrollment rate, the study team will attempt to inform and consent the 
patients/LARs for at least five days. If, after 5 days, the patient remains unable to self -consent 
and no LAR is available to consent, the consent will be waived and dat a included. Additionally, 
if the subject does not survive following the traumatic injury or is discharged from the hospital 
before the study team is able to obtain consent, their information will be included in the data 
analysis.  
 
Data Handling and Record Keeping  
 
If data is to be extracted by hand, it will be entered into a standardized case report form 
and entered into a RedCap™ database. Each subject will be assigned a study -specific number. 
Data will be collected until hospital discharge.  
All hard copy source documentation will be kept in a secured, locked cabinet in the 
research coordinator’s office. All study documents will be maintained in a secure location for 
two years following study completion.

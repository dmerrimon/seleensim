Study Title:
Exploratory Pilot Studies to Demonstrate
Mechanisms of Preventing Antibiotic-Associated
Diarrhea and the Role for Probiotics
Protocol Title: Observing and Understanding antibiotic-induced Reduction in SCFAs and time dependent
administration of BB-12 proBIOTIC (OURBIOTIC)
Phase:
Mechanistic Study
Population
: 124 healthy adults ages 18-65 years
Number of Sites:
Single Center
Study Duration:
R33 Phase: 36 months
Description of Study Design:
Randomized, double-blinded,
controlled clinical trial
National Clinical Trial (NCT) Number: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Georgetown University Institutional Review Number: STUDY00002431
Primary Objective:
To determine the ability of BB-12 to impact antibiotic-induced reduction in SCFA concentration, as
reflected by the levels of acetate. The effect size according to an adjusted Cohen’s d will be calculated at
day 7 and 30. SCFA produced by anaerobic gut microbiota will be quantified from human fecal samples
via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and adjusted for each participant’s
own baseline value. Also, to determine the impact of concurrent versus delayed administration of BB-12
in relation to the antibiotics.
Secondary Objectives:
To determine the ability of BB-12 to impact antibiotic-induced disruption of the gut microbiota with 16S
rDNA profiling, with the addition of the time variable. This will be assessed at days 7 and 14. Changes in
absolute abundance of specific bacterial genera (with a particular emphasis on known butyrate
producers in the Firmicutes phylum) will also be assessed with qPCR. Also, to determine the role of
acetate produced by BB-12 in situ as cross-feeder to butyrate producers in the Firmicutes phylum
resulting in an up-regulation of butyrate biosynthetic pathways.
Design and Outcomes:
This is a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blinded, single center, mechanistic study to test the
mechanism of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (B. lactis) strain BB-12 (BB-12) yogurt in AAD,
compared to yogurt without BB-12, in healthy adults.
Interventions and Duration:
The probiotic-supplemented yogurt is composed of the investigational agent, BB-12, and contains the
yogurt starter culture YF-L702 (a mixed culture of
Streptococcus thermophilus
and
Lactobacillus
delbrueckii
subsp.
bulgaricus
). The yogurt starter
culture will be present and alive in the control yogurt.
Participants are to provide informed consent at Baseline and complete a 30-day run-in period, during
which they will refrain from all probiotics, and begin the antibiotic and yogurt interventions on Day 1.
Participants will be randomized into five groups in a 28:28:28:28:12 ratio with proper allocation
concealment (
Figure 1
).

Group 1 (n=28): Probiotic BB-12 supplemented yogurt, 4-ounces (which delivers
≥10
10
CFU of BB-12)
taken orally for 14 days concurrently with amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC) 875/125 mg, twice daily, for 7
days.
Group 2 (n=28): Probiotic BB-12 supplemented yogurt, 4-ounces taken orally for 14 days. Yogurt is
consumed four hours after taking AMC 875/125 mg, twice daily, for 7 days.
Group 3 (n=28): Control yogurt, 4-ounces taken orally for 14 days concurrently with AMC 875/125 mg,
twice daily, for 7 days.
Group 4 (n=28): Control yogurt, 4-ounces taken orally for 14 days. Yogurt is consumed four hours after
taking AMC 875/125 mg, twice daily, for 7 days.
Group 5 (n=12): No Yogurt. AMC 875/125 mg, twice daily, for 7 days.
Figure 1.
Fecal samples will be collected at home (at baseline (pre and post run-in), days 7, 14, 21 and 30) for
SCFA and microbiome testing. Participants will be given detailed, written and illustrated instructions on
proper sample collection procedures,
and research
staff will review these protocols with participants during
enrollment.
Follow-up phone visits will be completed on Days 7, 14, and 30. Participants will keep a daily diary to track
number, shape and consistency of bowel movements, if/when antibiotic and/or yogurt was consumed,
Bristol Stool chart, general health, use of other medicines or products, adverse events, and the
Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) - Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) version.
Duration: Each participant will be in the study for approximately 8 weeks total. During the first 30 days, 
the participant will refrain from antibiotics and probiotics (run-in period) and provide two baseline
samples. The participant will be taking the antibiotic intervention for 7 days and taking the yogurt
intervention for 14 days. There are two more data collection visits on day 21 and 30.

Sample Size and Population:
The population will be generally healthy adults of ages 18-65 years. This randomized controlled trial is
open to all eligible adults who meet the inclusion criteria. We are not proposing exclusion of any specific
sex/gender or racial/ethnic group. Approximately one hundred and fifty participants will be recruited from
the greater community and clinical sites in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, and one hundred and
twenty-four (n=124) participants will be randomized and commence the study. Based on the
demographics of the network and recruitment rates in previous studies at our site, we anticipate about
50% of participants will be women, 20% will be primary Spanish speakers, and 30-40% will self-identify
as one of the racial or ethnic minority populations.
1. STUDY OBJECTIVES
1.1
Primary Objective
To determine the ability of BB-12 to impact antibiotic-induced reduction in SCFA concentration as
reflected by the levels of acetate. on day 7. The R33 will also add a time variable to determine the impact
of concurrent versus delayed administration of BB-12 in relation to the antibiotics. SCFA produced by
anaerobic gut microbiota will be quantified from human fecal samples via liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and adjusted for each participant’s own baseline value. As a secondary
analysis, we will also perform normal area under the curve (AUC) analysis of the percent change in
acetate from baseline.
Primary Hypothesis
: Antibiotics will result in a reduction
in fecal SCFA by day 7. BB-12 supplementation
will protect against antibiotic-induced SCFA reduction and/or be associated with a quicker return to
baseline SCFA levels, as compared to the control group. We hypothesize that concurrent administration
of the probiotic and antibiotic is not necessary for the probiotic impact on SCFA.
1.2
Secondary Objectives
To determine the ability of BB-12 to impact antibiotic-induced disruption of the gut microbiota with 16S
rDNA profiling. This will be assessed at days 7 and 14. Also, to determine the impact of concurrent
versus delayed administration of BB-12 in relation to the antibiotics. Changes in absolute abundance of
specific bacterial genera (with a particular emphasis on known butyrate producers in the Firmicutes
phylum) will also be assessed with qPCR.
Secondary Hypothesis
: Antibiotics will result in a
decrease in the overall number and diversity of bacterial
species present in the fecal microbiota. We hypothesize that concurrent administration of the probiotic
and antibiotic is not necessary for the probiotic effect on the composition of the gut microbiota. This will
be assessed at baseline and days 7, 14, 21 and 30, and we would expect a decrease in at least days 7
and 14. BB-12 supplementation will protect against antibiotic-induced shifts in the microbiota and/or will
be associated with a quicker return to a baseline microbiota composition, as compared to the control
group. Microbiota composition will be assessed with 16S rDNA profiling and qPCR.

Tertiary Hypothesis and Aim
: We hypothesize that acetate produced by BB-12 in situ will cross-feed
butyrate producers in the Firmicutes phylum resulting in an up-regulation of butyrate biosynthetic
pathways. We will longitudinally characterize the gut microbiota with high-throughput metatranscriptomics
in order to generate complementary information on the impact of antibiotics plus and minus BB-12 on
overall microbiome function.

BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
2.1
Background Information
Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in sufficient amounts, may improve health.(
1
)
Often, probiotics are ingested as supplements in powder, pill or liquid forms, designed specifically for
medicinal benefit. Such supplements have shown potential benefits in treatment and prevention of varied
diseases, including diarrhea, asthma, necrotizing enterocolitis and allergies.(
2-6
) As an alternative
to
supplements, probiotics are also included as ingredients in fermented dairy products to produce
functional foods; that is foods providing health benefits beyond their nutritional value.(
7-10
) Yogurt, for
example, is a fermented milk product often considered a functional food. In fact, two-thirds of primary
care physicians who counsel patients about nutrition recommend consuming yogurt containing live active
cultures for the health benefits associated with this food.(
11
) Despite this common practice, however,
evidence for beneficial health outcomes is limited.
2.2
Microbiota Play an Important Role in the Gastrointestinal Tract
The gastrointestinal tract contains a complex commensal microbiota that contributes to homeostasis in
the gastrointestinal tract. The intestinal microbiota includes hundreds of species of facultative and
obligate anaerobes.(
12
) The human intestine is home
to over 100 trillion microorganisms. When
functioning appropriately, this high-species diversity produces homeostasis of the gut.(
13
) This balance
is often disturbed by medical interventions such as antibiotics or viral diseases, causing a disturbance of
the fecal microbiota and resulting in, among other effects, decreased short chain fatty acid metabolism.
This causes the accumulation of luminal carbohydrate, subsequent pH changes, and water
absorption.(
14
) Supplemental probiotics may help regulate
the microbiota when disturbed by outside
influences.(
15
)
2.3
General
Bifidobacterium
Information
Probiotics marketed as nutritional supplements and found in functional foods, such as yogurts, are
principally members of the genera
Bifidobacterium
and
Lactobacillus
. Members of these genera are
Gram-positive facultative anaerobes and are also classified as lactic acid bacteria (LAB).
Bifidobacterium
species, particularly
B. lactis
BB-12, the principal
focus of this study, can be found in the gastrointestinal
tract (GIT) as both autochthonous (native to a particular place) and allochthonous (derived from outside a
system) residents.(
16
) Newborns, especially those
that are breast-fed, are colonized with bifidobacteria
within days after birth. Once the child is weaned, the population of these bacteria in the colon appears to
be relatively stable until advanced age when it appears to decline.(
16
,
17
) Furthermore,
B. lactis
, unlike
the majority of anaerobic bifidobacteria, are moderately tolerant of oxygen. It is for this reason that
B.
lactis
is so extensively used for research and commercial
application.(
18
)
2.4
Likely Mechanisms of BB-12 Health Effects
There are many potential mechanisms by which probiotics are believed to exert their effects. Possible
mechanisms of probiotic effect include: 1) production of antimicrobial substances; 2) binding to and
penetrating gastrointestinal receptors; 3) competition for nutrients; 4) enhancement of mucosal barrier
function; 5) altered immunoregulation, including both anti-inflammatory and immunostimulatory
responses; and, 6) ferment glucose, lactose, and fructose, thereby lowering fecal pH.(
19-25
) Due to the
immune system’s role in a multitude of disease states, many studies have concentrated on the
immunoregulatory effect of probiotics, examining probiotics’ role in diseases, such as eczema with
potential mechanisms involving T cell, B cell, epithelial cell, dendritic cell, macrophage, nature killer cell,
IRB ID: STUDY00002431
Page

of
68
January 25, 2022 v 1.4
IND # 13691 Merenstein/Fraser
Clinical Research Protocol
antibody, and cytokine effects.(
26-28
) After providing infants who manifested atopic eczema (mean age
of 4.6 months) with a BB-12 infused formula, Isolauri, et al., found significant skin improvements in the
probiotic group compared to the control group (P=0.002).(
28
)
Additionally, many believe that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) appears to be caused by immune
responses to commensal enteric bacteria in predisposed individuals.(
24
) A commercial blend of eight
different probiotic strains (Streptococcus thermophilus, three strains of
Bifidobacterium
species and four
strains of
Lactobacillus
species), VSL3, has been
shown to limit epithelial inflammatory responses in vivo
and in vitro, and is often prescribed for individuals with IBD.(
29-34
)
Further support of an immunoregulatory response is a study conducted by Fukushima et al. on healthy
Japanese children between the ages of 15 and 31 months. The children were fed a follow-up formula
infused with 10
9
CFU BB-12 and were found to have
a significant increase in total IgA and anti-poliovirus
IgA, respectively.(
35
) This suggests ingestion of
the probiotic formula containing BB-12 and colonization
by the strain can trigger IgA production by the host. This type of data demonstrates that probiotics
positively influence the maturation process of immunity.
2.5
BB-12 Survival in Stools
The ability to isolate an orally administered probiotic in the stools is considered to be a good indicator
that the strain is able to reach key target sites throughout the intestinal tract. The ability of BB-12 to
survive intestinal transit has been documented in several studies.(
36-39
) Taken together, these studies
document the ability of BB-12 to survive gastrointestinal transit and persist for 1-3 weeks post feeding.
However, the degree of persistence is likely due to doses fed, delivery vehicle, host factors and the ability
of BB-12 to grow during colonization. Studies such as the one proposed here are needed to document
the success of probiotic survival in foods supplemented with probiotics.
2.6
Safety of Use of BB-12
Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in foods have a long history of safe use. LAB and related organisms (with the
exception of enterococci) are seldom associated with infections, except in immunodeficient individuals or
individuals with severe underlying illness.(
40
) Although
bifidobacteria are not naturally found in food, they
have been used as ingredients of dietary supplements and added to foods as functional ingredients for
decades.(
16
) The BB-12 strain has been used in numerous
controlled human studies in pediatric and
adult populations with no adverse incidents reported. BB-12, in combination with a strain of
S.
thermophilus
, was the subject of a GRAS petition to
the FDA March 2002 (Agency GRAS Notice GRN
000049), where the FDA did not object to use of these bacteria in infant formula.
Although transferable antibiotic resistances are not very common among LAB, they do occur. BB-12 was
evaluated for such resistance genes and was found to contain the tetracycline resistance gene
tet
(W).
Nestlé provided these data to the FDA in support of its view that the presence of
tet
(W) does not affect
the safety of BB-12 as an ingredient in infant formula. In November 2005, the FDA responded to this
additional information stating that:
“Based
on
the
information
provided
by
Nestlé,
as
well
as
other
information
available
to
FDA,
the
agency
has
no
questions
at
this
time
regarding
Nestlé's
conclusions
that
the
presence
of
the
tet
(W)
gene
in
their
B.
lactis
strain
does
not
affect
the
safety
of
the
intended
use
of
B.
lactis
as
an
ingredient
in
infant
formula
and
that
the
discovery
of
the
tet
(W)
gene
in
B.
lactis
does
not
change
their
previous
conclusion
that
B.
lactis
is
GRAS
for
its
intended
use
as
an
ingredient
in
infant formula.”

Clinical Research Protocol
A summary of the BB-12 safety articles, using the identical strain as in this protocol, is included in the
Appendix
. Consistent with this data the R61 demonstrated
more proportional adverse events in the
control than active group. All adverse events were self-limiting and no serious adverse events occurred.
2.7
Probiotics Treating and Preventing Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea (AAD)
Acute diarrhea is commonly caused by infections or antibiotics. Children and adults are often placed on
antibiotics and the rate of diarrhea associated with antibiotic usage is 20-35%, with 10-20% of the
diarrhea due to
Clostridium difficile
.(
41-49
)
Antimicrobial resistance, stemming from antibiotic use, is a multifactorial problem. Major elements of the
problem include over-prescription of antibiotics by physicians and poor compliance by patients.(
50
)
Although educating physicians and the lay public has led to dramatic decreases in antibiotic
prescriptions, approximately 25% of all visits for children under age five still results in a prescription for
antibiotics.(
48
,
49
,
51-53
) In fact, children ages
three to 36 months average over two antibiotic
prescriptions per year, with nearly 30% receiving over four prescriptions per year.(
49
)
Probiotics have the potential to reduce the rate of AAD. Numerous meta-analyses have examined the
potential role of probiotics, with the positive studies showing an effect size of 25-35%.(
54-59
) In a recent
study, Correa et al. enrolled 80 children between six and 36 months of age who were receiving oral or
parental antibiotic therapy. In addition to the antibiotics, infants were given either a combination of 10
7
B.
lactis
and 10
6
S. thermophilus
or a placebo. In this
study, 31% of the placebo group experienced diarrhea
compared to 16% of the probiotic group (p, 0.044).(
60
)
In a similar study, Arvola et al. enrolled children
on antibiotics and gave them either a matching placebo or LGG at 2x10
10
CFU/day. After two weeks, 5%
of the LGG group had diarrhea compared to 16% of the placebo group, with a treatment effect of -11%
(95% confidence intervals of -21%, 0%).(

Functional Foods and Yogurt
Consuming foods to provide health benefits beyond basic nutritional needs is a well-accepted practice in
the United States. For example, many parents feed their children cereal fortified with minerals and
nutrients. Another example is the addition of folic acid to many food products; this has greatly decreased
the incidence of neural tube defects in the U.S.(
62
,
63
) Functional foods are enriched or enhanced foods
that provide health benefits beyond the inherent nutritional value of the food.(
64
) For example,
BENECOL® is a margarine type food proven in clinical trials to reduce LDL cholesterol.(
65
,
66
) The
promise of using functional foods to mitigate disease and promote health is one of the major reasons so
many resources are being devoted to this exciting new field.(

)
Yogurt is defined as milk fermented with two specific bacterial species,
L. bulgaricus
and
S. thermophilus
.
To differentiate yogurt containing live and active cultures and those pasteurized after fermentation, the
National Yogurt Association developed a seal, the Live Active Culture Seal. Any yogurt containing 10
8
CFU/g at the time of manufacture may display this seal. A dose of probiotics of 10
8
-10
10
cfu/day is
the
amount that has generally been studied and has resulted in health benefits. However, several surveys
suggest the probiotic content of yogurt and probiotic supplements may be lower than labels would imply.
Hamilton-Miller et al. examined 52 European probiotic products, including 11 yogurts, and found that
none gave any indication of actual numbers and less than 50% accurately stated the bacterial species
contained in the product.(
71
) This study highlights
the lack of useful information available to consumers
when selecting products containing probiotics.
Beniwal et al. studied the effect of yogurt containing
L. acidophilus
on AAD in an unblinded manner in

hospitalized patients receiving oral or intravenous antibiotics. The 105 patients in the yogurt group
received two 8-ounce vanilla yogurt containers for eight days. Yogurt supplemented with
L. acidophilus
decreased AAD from 24% to 12%.(
72
) However, the unblinded
nature of this study makes these results
only suggestive.

Summary and Significance
Bifidobacterium lactis
strain BB-12 is a commercially
available probiotic strain that has been used in a
number of feeding and clinical trials.(
73-84
) BB-12
has been found to survive transit through the
stomach, small intestine and colon.(
85-87
) Additionally,
long term consumption of probiotic-containing
formula at levels as high as 1 billion cfu/g (240 g serving) was found to be safe and well tolerated by
children.(
88
,
89
)
Along with providing health benefits, BB-12 is a highly sought probiotic because it has a high resistance
to acids in fermented dairy products and is aerotolerant.(
90
)
Importantly for our study, it is believed that
dairy products provide a protective environment allowing for probiotic bacteria to remain viable through
digestion.(
90
) An issue concerning probiotic delivery
in dairy products is a decrease in viable cells by the
end of the product’s shelf-life. McBearty et al. manufactured a probiotic cheddar cheese containing 10
8
cfu/ml BB-12.(
91
) The levels of BB-12 remained constant
throughout six months of ripening at a pH of
5.3. Fukushima et al. incorporated BB-12 into an unfermented, canned infant formula.(
35
) The levels of
viable BB-12 cells did not decrease for at least 18 months in the sealed can and for 30 days after the can
was opened. BB-12 appears to persist in dairy products; however, the persistence of BB-12 in yogurt,
where the pH is lower than 5.0, has not been as widely studied.
Nearly 190 million outpatient antibiotic prescriptions were given in the period of 1998-99. Nearly one
quarter (22%) of all pediatric visits resulted in antibiotic prescriptions. A study of 1992 data reported that
office visits for colds, upper respiratory tract
infections,
and bronchitis resulted in approximately 12 million
antibiotic
prescriptions, accounting for 21% of antibiotic
prescriptions.(
92
) Another study found that
antibiotics were prescribed for 78% of acute bronchitis episodes, 65% of acute pharyngitis episodes,
81% of acute sinusitis episodes, and 33% of nonspecific URI episodes, many of which are of viral
etiology.(
93
)
Noncompliance with prescriptions is often due to side effects, most commonly AAD.(
94
) Diarrhea is a
common and costly disease of children in the U.S. Children less than five years of age experience 20-35
million episodes of diarrhea per year. These episodes lead to 2-3.5 million physician visits (which
account for 10% of all visits by children), more than 200,000 hospitalizations (13% of hospital admissions
in children less than five years), and 325-425 deaths annually.(
95-98
) There have been many promising
studies demonstrating the potential benefits of probiotic supplementation in preventing diarrhea.
However, currently, probiotics are generally given in powder, pill or liquid forms and generally sold at
health food stores. Yogurt, which is more readily available and accepted, has the potential to greatly
influence health if efficacious probiotic dosages and species are available in the product.
This study will evaluate whether a well-defined, probiotic-containing yogurt can be used as an effective
delivery vehicle for probiotics. Our long-term goal is to create yogurt with sufficient probiotic dosages to
positively impact many different aspects of childhood and adult health. There is widespread acceptance
of yogurt with added cultures among the general population and this is one of the reasons we believe
yogurt will be more acceptable than supplements.

objective of this Phase 1 study was to establish safety of probiotic BB-12 supplemented yogurt
consumed daily for 10 consecutive days by adults concurrently taking antibiotics for an upper respiratory
infection. Forty subjects were randomized into two groups, BB-12 supplemented yogurt and control
yogurt without BB-12, using the random allocation rule. Forty participants were recruited through the
Capital Area Primary Care Research Network (CAPRICORN), a practice-based research network. The
participants in the study were healthy individuals between the ages of 18-65 years and who were
prescribed treatment with a penicillin class antibiotic regimen for an upper respiratory infection. A
respiratory infection was classified as any infection the physician designates as strep or non-strep
pharyngitis, otitis media, pneumonia, sinusitis or bronchitis that results in a 10-day prescription of
antibiotics. All reported adverse events were tabulated by type and treatment group (see
Table 1
). There
were no serious adverse events reported. No participants withdrew from the study due to adverse
events.
II. Safety of BB-12 Supplemented Strawberry Yogurt For Healthy Children:
The primary objective of
our Phase 1 pediatric study was to assess the safety of strawberry flavored yogurt supplemented with
Bifidobacterium animalis
subsp.
lactis
strain BB-12
when consumed daily for 10 consecutive days by
generally healthy children. The secondary objective was to assess the ability of BB-12 to survive gastric
transit. The participants in the study were healthy individuals between the ages of 1-5 years. Participants
were recruited through CAPRICORN. Twenty-nine participants received the BB-12 yogurt and 31
participants received the control yogurt. All reported adverse events were tabulated by type and
treatment group (
Table 2
). Three serious adverse events
were reported (details in
Table 2
). No
participant deaths were reported and no participants withdrew from the study due to adverse events.
Both studies, Safety of BB-12 Supplemented Strawberry Yogurt For Healthy Adults on Antibiotics and
Safety of BB-12 Supplemented Strawberry Yogurt For Healthy Children were conducted under the same
IND.

III. The Study to Investigate the Potential of Probiotics (SIPPY I and II)
:
We have also conducted two
previous, non-IND but structure/function studies using the same investigational product,
strawberry-flavored BB-12 supplemented yogurt. Both were
double-blinded, randomized,
placebo-controlled, allocation concealment clinical trials consisting of a combined 354 healthy children
between the ages of 1 and 5 years who attended daycare/school at least 3 days per week. The active
BB-12 and control products were
the same as used in
the two Phase I trials. The primary objective was
to determine if daily consumption of a probiotic-containing yogurt-based drink for 90 consecutive days
decreased absences from daycare for the children, a structure/function outcome. Thus, the total days of
BB-12 yogurt consumption was over 30,000 days. There were no significant differences in the days of
missed school per group. Importantly there were no differences in adverse events (see
Table 3
) among
BB-12 and control groups.

Rationale
The rationale for focusing on food as a vehicle for the transmission of probiotics is that it has the potential
to benefit a much larger public health population than using probiotics in a more medicinal manner, such
as pills or capsules. Compliance with most medicinal regimens is around 50%; although certain
interventions such as simplifying a regimen, collaboration with patients, different formulations, and
increased convenience improve compliance.(
99-102
)
We believe a readily available drink containing a
high dose of probiotics has the potential to improve compliance through many of these mechanisms. This
product also has the potential to positively impact the health of children and adults around the world, as
yogurt will likely be more appealing to both children and their parents for long term consumption than
pharmaceutical-like preparations. In addition to the benefits associated with the consumption of
probiotics, there is an increased health benefit from consuming yogurt, a nutrient dense food.
2.12
Potential Risks and Benefits
2.12.1
Potential Risks
Yogurt:
Potential risks and side effects related to
the probiotic cultured yogurt include: allergic reaction to
drink ingredients, most likely strawberry, or digestive problems such as stomachaches or loose, watery
bowels due to lactose intolerance.

IND # 13691 Merenstein/Fraser
Clinical Research Protocol
Amoxicillin-clavulanate
: nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhea, upset stomach and mild skin rash. The most
serious potential risk is diarrhea caused by a
Clostridium
difficile
infection.
Symptoms of
C.
difficile
infection include stomach pain or tenderness, bloody stools, fever, nausea, and diarrhea.
There may also be side effects, other than those listed above that we cannot predict. Many side effects
may go away shortly after the yogurt or antibiotic consumption is stopped, but in some cases side effects
can be serious, long lasting or permanent.
Stool Collection:
There is no known risk to stool
collection.  However, there may be some discomfort
with collecting stool samples.
2.12.2
Known Potential Benefits
BB-12:
Bifidobacterium lactis
strain BB-12 is a commercially
available probiotic strain used in a number
of feeding and clinical trials. Such supplements have shown potential benefits in treatment and
prevention of various diseases including diarrhea, asthma, necrotizing enterocolitis and allergies. It has
also been found to significantly improve skin conditions in eczema patients.
Yogurt:
Yogurt has its own known benefits coming from
milk. For every 6-ounce serving, there are about
9 grams of animal protein, plus several other nutrients found in dairy foods, like calcium, vitamin B-2,
B-12, potassium, and magnesium. Yogurt with active cultures is found to help certain gastrointestinal
conditions including lactose intolerance, constipation, and diarrhea. Yogurt, which is more readily
available and accepted by the general public, has the potential to greatly influence health if efficacious
probiotic dosages and species are available in the product. Therefore, we believe that the benefits of the
BB-12 supplemented yogurt far outweigh the discomfort and small risks participants might experience.

3. STUDY  DESIGN
In order to determine the ability of BB-12 to impact antibiotic-induced perturbation and recovery, we will
conduct a randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial in 124
healthy participants
, ages 18-65 years.
The full inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Section 4. All participants will be given a 7-day
prescription for 875/125 mg of amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC), taken twice daily. In order to control for
confounding by disease state and specific antibiotic used, all participants randomized to a yogurt
intervention group will receive the same daily dose --a four-ounce (approximately 100 ml) serving of
probiotic (which delivers ≥10
10
CFU of BB-12) or control
yogurt-- and length of antibiotic treatment after a
30-day run-in period.
Participants are to provide informed consent on at baseline, complete the 30-day run-in --during which
they will refrain from all probiotics-- and begin the antibiotic and yogurt interventions on Day 1. As with
our previous studies, enrollment and informed consent will occur at a private location, either in Dr.
Merenstein’s laboratory at Georgetown University Medical Center, or at the participant’s home, as per
the participant’s preference. All interventions will be delivered in coolers to the participants’ homes prior
to day 1, at a time of their choosing.
This is a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blinded, single center, mechanistic study to test the 
mechanism of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (B. lactis) strain BB-12 (BB-12) yogurt in AAD,
compared to yogurt without BB-12, in healthy adults. 124 participants will be randomized into one of five
groups. One group (N=12) will receive only antibiotics and no other interventions. The other four groups
will receive either the active or control yogurt, or one of the control arms of the study. The active and
control yogurt groups will each have two groups that will take the yogurts at different times, and the
control non-yogurt arm will have one group, for a total of five groups. All participants will be given a 7-day
prescription for 875/125 mg of amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC), taken twice daily. Participants in the two
active arms will be given BB-12 supplemented yogurt and instructed to consume the yogurt concurrently
with the antibiotics (N=28) or four hours after taking the antibiotics (N=28). Participants in the two control
yogurt arms will be given yogurt without the BB-12 supplement, and will be instructed to consume the
yogurt concurrently with the antibiotics (N=28) or four hours after taking the antibiotics (N=28).
Fecal samples will be collected at home (twice at baseline (pre-run-in and post-run-in), and on days 7, 
14, 21 and 30) into a maximum of three (1 sample for SCFA, 1 sample for microbiome testing, and 1
sample for potential future analysis) sterile, screw-capped tubes and frozen within one hour of collection
in a home freezer. Participants will be given detailed, written and illustrated instructions on proper
sample collection procedures, using protocols from the Fraser laboratory and as described in previous
studies.
Research staff will review these protocols
with participants during enrollment. Immediately after
collection and freezing, a member of the research team will be alerted to retrieve and transport the
samples to the laboratory. The samples will be stored at -80°C until transport to The IGS. All staff will
receive certification on handling procedures.
Follow-up phone visits will be completed on Days 7, 14, and 30. Participants will keep a daily diary to
track number, shape and consistency of bowel movements, if/when antibiotic or yogurt was consumed,
Bristol Stool chart, general health, use of other medicines or products, adverse events, and the GSRS -
IBS instrument.
3.1
Primary Outcome Measure
The primary outcome is to determine the ability of BB-12 to impact antibiotic-induced reduction in SCFA
as reflected by the levels of acetate. The effect size according to an adjusted Cohen’s d will be calculated
at day 7 and 30. We will also explore the impact of concurrent versus delayed administration of BB-12 in
IRB ID: STUDY00002431
Page

Clinical Research Protocol
relation to the antibiotics. SCFA produced by anaerobic gut microbiota will be quantified from human
fecal samples via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and adjusted for each
participant’s own baseline value.  As a secondary analysis, we will also perform normal area under the
curve (AUC) analysis of the percent change in acetate from baseline.
Primary Hypothesis: Antibiotics will result in a reduction in fecal SCFA. BB-12 supplementation will
protect against antibiotic-induced SCFA reduction and/or be associated with a quicker return to baseline
SCFA levels, as compared to the control group. We also hypothesize that concurrent administration of
the probiotic and antibiotic is not necessary for the probiotic impact on SCFA.
3.2
Secondary Outcome Measures
The secondary aim is to determine the ability of BB-12 to impact antibiotic-induced disruption of the gut
microbiota using 16S rDNA profiling, and the impact of concurrent versus delayed administration of
BB-12 in relation to the antibiotics. This will be assessed at days 7 and 14. Changes in absolute
abundance of specific bacterial genera (with a particular emphasis on known butyrate producers in the
Firmicutes phylum) will also be assessed with qPCR.
Secondary Hypothesis: Antibiotics will result in a decrease in the overall number and diversity of bacterial
species present in the fecal microbiota. BB-12 supplementation will protect against antibiotic-induced
shifts in the microbiota and/or will be associated with a quicker return to a baseline microbiota
composition, as compared to the control group. We also hypothesize that concurrent administration of
the probiotic and antibiotic is not necessary for the probiotic effect on the composition of the gut
microbiota.
Tertiary Hypothesis and Aim: We hypothesize that acetate produced by BB-12 in situ will cross-feed
butyrate producers in the Firmicutes phylum resulting in an up-regulation of butyrate biosynthetic
pathways. We will longitudinally characterize the gut microbiota with high-throughput metatranscriptomics
in order to generate complementary information on the impact of antibiotics plus and minus BB-12 on
overall microbiome function.
The experiments in the R33 phase of the study will provide sequential samples from which data on both
microbial composition (based on 16S rDNA profiling) and total bacterial numbers (based on qPCR data)
can be generated. Longitudinal 16S rDNA profiling will provide insight into several distinct shifts in the
microbiota (e.g., overall decreases in bacterial numbers, loss of taxa, loss of overall community diversity)
that reflect the impact of antibiotics (control group) and antibiotics plus BB-12 (active yogurt group). We
will follow the extent and time course of recovery of the microbiota following cessation of antibiotic
therapy.
The following exploratory outcomes, while not adequately powered due to a relatively small sample size,
will be examined and listed on ClinicalTrials.gov.: diarrhea, loose stools, constipation, fever, flatulence,
lack of appetite, pain, rash, vomiting, allergic reaction, dyspepsia, and nausea. We will also examine
whether acetate changes are associated with any of the listed outcomes.
We anticipate that a subset of participants, conservatively 15%, will develop diarrhea, and we will
generate data on microbiota changes during the progression from the diarrheal state to the non-diarrheal
state. This will allow us to ask if changes in the relative abundance of specific members of the gut
microbiota (either alone or in combination) correlate with a clinical outcome.
The most likely outcomes from the study are:
1. +/- impact of BB-12 on fecal SCFA levels
2. +/- impact of BB-12 on gut microbiota composition (measured to quantify level of disruption achieved

3. +/- impact of BB-12 on AAD (measured, but study not powered to detect clinical difference of AAD).
4. +/- impact of BB-12 influenced by the timing between AMC dose and BB-12 consumption.
4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS
4.1
Recruitment Strategy
We will enroll and randomize 124 participants; 28 will be in the BB-12 yogurt concurrent consumption
group, 28 will be in the BB-12 yogurt delayed consumption group, 28 in the control yogurt concurrent
consumption group, 28 in the control yogurt delayed consumption group, and 12 in the no yogurt group.
Statistical analysis on the primary outcome will be performed using the intention-to-treat principle; all
subjects enrolled and randomized will be accounted for in the final analysis in their randomized group.
Flyers and posters will also be displayed in clinics, offices and community centers participating in the
study prior to initiation.
The CAPRICORN research network is specifically designed to help conduct clinical trials. Ideas for
studies either come from practicing physicians or University researchers. Regardless of where studies
originate, they are then reviewed and sent out to physicians for comment. Thus, not all physicians or
offices participate in each study; but are allowed to choose which studies that they have interest in and
work within their office flow. Because of this grassroots approach, CAPRICORN has been very
successful in fulfilling recruitment goals set forth a priori in studies. The network has helped the PI recruit
over 1,500 participants in eight randomized controlled trials.
4.2
Inclusion Criteria
Participants will be
eligible
if:
1.
S/he is between ages of 18-65 years
2.
S/he has the ability to read, speak and write English or Spanish
3.
S/he has refrigerator for proper storage of the intervention
4.

4.3
Inclusion of Women and Minorities
This is an adult study and no one under age 18 will be included. All adults who meet the
inclusion/exclusion criteria, regardless of religion, sex, or ethnic background will be enrolled if they sign
the informed consent.
Based on rates of patients seen in our network, we anticipate about 50% of the potential participants will
be female. Many of our practices are based in the inner-city and have an over-representation of ethnic
minorities.
4.4

Study Enrollment Procedures
Research staff will meet with area physicians via the CAPRICORN network and community members to
inform them about the study. Flyers and posters will also be displayed in clinics, offices, and community
centers participating in the study approximately three months prior to initiation of the study. Information
about the study procedures and criteria will be available on a public, study-specific website (content
pre-approved by the GU IRB).
Potential participants will be pre-screened over the phone or in-person using the Pre-screening Form
(PS). If they meet basic entry criteria, the potential participant will be offered the opportunity for study
participation and will be given a copy of the informed consent form and/or link to the website, and time to
review before making the choice about participation. If the participant agrees, an enrollment and
informed consent visit will be scheduled at a mutually agreed time and location. Information provided
during the consent process include, the purpose of the study, procedures, withdrawal procedures,
subject termination, risk/discomforts, benefits, costs, compensation, and alternatives to participation.
This study design is such that potential participants sign the informed consent about 45-60 days before
starting any interventions. About 1-3 weeks after signing the informed consent, the participants have at
least a 30-day wash out period where they refrain from consuming any probiotic products and antibiotics;
after which, they will start the intervention period. Due to the time lag between enrollment and the start of
the interventions, some participants decide to withdraw in the interim before starting any interventions.
Since this is a study to understand the mechanisms of preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea using
probiotics, in order to accomplish the study aims, it is critical to have data collected from 124 participants
who have been randomized and commenced the interventions. As such, we may enroll approximately
200 individuals to account for the withdrawal rates, so that study is completed with a final sample size of
124 participants.

5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS
5.1
Interventions, Administration, and Duration
The probiotic-supplemented yogurt is composed of the investigational agent, BB-12, and contains the
yogurt starter culture YF-L702 (a mixed culture of
Streptococcus thermophilus
and
Lactobacillus
delbrueckii
subsp.
bulgaricus
). The yogurt starter
culture will be present and alive in the control yogurt.
Starter culture alone is unlikely to impact AAD, as it does not survive the acidic stomach environment
and is not recovered alive in the feces.
Details about
yogurt preparation, and enumeration and PCR
verification of BB-12 have been previously published and reviewed by the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).
Participants in the four yogurt groups will take the same amount of either the BB-12 or control yogurt, as
determined by random assignment. Participants will each consume a four-ounce daily dose orally for 14
days while on amoxicillin-clavulanate for 7 days. Each four-ounce daily dose of the active yogurt will
deliver no less than 10
10
CFU of BB-12 per day.
Study interventions
BB-12 yogurt and amoxicillin-clavulanate, or 
Control yogurt and amoxicillin-clavulanate, or 
No yogurt and amoxicillin-clavulanate
Administration

Once manufactured, the probiotic-supplemented yogurt-drink will be packaged in pint-size plastic
containers, which will yield 4 servings of the 4-ounce daily dosage. Four containers of the yogurt drink
with their randomly assigned bin number will be provided to the participants after enrollment and the
4-week run-in period, prior to day 1, along with the plastic cups and markings that denote levels of 2, 4,
6, and 8 ounces. The daily dose is one serving of 4-ounces of yogurt each day. This will deliver no less
than 10
10
CFU per day of BB-12.
Each plastic container will bear the label “Caution: New Drug-Limited by Federal (or United States) law to
investigational use” in addition to its manufactured date and time.
5.2.1.3
Yogurt Drink Manufacture
Yogurt drink manufacture is broken into two major activities, 1) preparation of the yogurt and 2) blending
with other ingredients to prepare the drink. To make the yogurt, a yogurt base is formulated to contain
9.0% milk solids non-fat (MSNF), 1.3% fat and 3.0% sugar using skim milk, cream, non-fat dry milk and
sugar. The wet ingredients (skim milk and cream) are mixed together and then blended with previously
weighed dry ingredients (sugar and non-fat dried milk). After blending the yogurt mix is pasteurized and
homogenized (2000 psi first stage, 500 psi second stage) at 83°C for 29 sec.  The pasteurized,
homogenized mix is pumped to the fermentation tank and given an additional heat treatment of 85°C for
30 min to denature whey proteins, then cooled to 42°C prior to inoculation with 0.02% of the yogurt
starter culture (YFL-720). The inoculated mix is agitated for 15 minutes and then allowed to incubate
quiescently until the pH reaches 4.6.
To prepare the yogurt drink the gel structure of the fermented yogurt is disrupted by agitation and
blended with a mixture of pectin, 36 DE corn syrup solids, sugar and water.  The pectin-containing
mixture is prepared by heating water, sugar, 36DE corn syrup solids, and pectin to 80°C, holding for 1
hour.  This mixture is then cooled to 40°C and added to the fermented white mass resulting in the
unflavored yogurt drink base.  To flavor the product, strawberry puree is then added to the yogurt drink.
The composition of the yogurt drink is shown in Table 4 and the ingredients used in manufacture are
listed in Table 5.  At this point, a portion of the yogurt drink is homogenized (1500 psi first stage, 500 psi
second stage) for a second time to create a drinkable consistency and packaged in plastic bottles. To
prepare the yogurt drink containing BB-12, an appropriate amount of (BB-12) is added to the yogurt
drink, allowed to mix for 15 minutes and then homogenized and packaged as described above. The
packaged yogurt is stored at 4°C.

5.2.1.4
Enumeration of BB-12 from the Yogurt
The viable count of BB-12 in the product is measured the day of manufacture (Day 0) and weekly until
Day 30 of shelf-life. The yogurt drink is diluted in sterile peptone water blanks (3M, St. Paul, MN) and
then appropriate dilutions of the product are cultured by pour plating on an MRS-based selective
bifidobacteria medium.(
103
) Modified MRS agar is made
by adding 4.5 grams Agar (Difco, BD, Sparks,
MD) to 300 ml MRS broth (Difco, BD, Sparks, MD). After autoclaving, the agar is used immediately after
addition of three selective components, 1.5mL of 0.01% Dicloxacillin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO); 3.0
mL of 10% Lithium Choride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO); and 1.5 mL of 10% Cysteine Hydrochloride
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Plates are anaerobically incubated (VWR, West Chester, PA) at 37°C
and counted after 72 hours. The final yogurt drink also is evaluated for the presence of coliforms using
high sensitivity Petrifilm
TM
Coliform Count Plates
(3M
TM
, Burlington, North Carolina) and Petrifilm
TM
aerobic plate counts according to the 17
th
edition
of Standard Methods for the Examination of Dairy
Products, #7.072 and #6.040, respectively.
5.2.1.5
PCR Verification of BB-12 Level in Finished Yogurt
To further verify the selectivity of the BB-12 agar, colonies of varying morphology are selected for
identification using
B. lactis
specific PCR primers
according to the method of Ventura et al.(
104
) Cells
are
lysed according to the microwave method of Bollet et al. as modified by Kullen et al.(
105
,
106
) The
sequence of the forward primer, Bflact2, is 5’-GTGGAGACACGGTTTCCC-3’ and the reverse primer,
Bflact5, is 5’-CACACCACACAATCCAATAC-3’. Amplicons from PCR are electrophoresed through a 2%
agarose gel at 110 volts for 2 hours, stained with ethidium bromide (Promega, Madison, WI), destained
with distilled water and visualized using an Alpha-Imager (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). The
presence of amplicons of the appropriate size is taken as evidence the colonies are indeed
B. lactis
.
5.2.1.6
Acceptability Testing
We also completed two previous studies using the same BB-12 yogurt drink in a combined total of 354
children ages 1-4 years to determine the effects of BB-12 yogurt on daycare absences.  Participants

consumed the same amount of yogurt we are proposing for this trial (four ounces daily) for 90
consecutive days. Only minimal adverse events were reported by 17 participants in over 30,000 total
days of product consumption; all were non-serious and self-limited. High rates of compliance, over 92%,
were reported in both trials, indicating the safety and tolerability of the BB-12 yogurt drink, at this
dosage.(

)
5.2.1.7
Final Product
Table 6 contains information about the initial population of BB-12 in the product as well as the results of
viable count analysis conducted up through the end of shelf life for 42 separate yogurt-drink
manufacturing experiments.  The total solids of the product ranged from 20.53 to 22.11% with a mean of
21.2%. The fat content of the product ranged from 0.52 to 1.29% with a mean of 0.9%. The pH of the
product ranged from 4.42-4.7 with a mean of 4.42 on the day of manufacture and remained relatively
constant throughout shelf life.  The population of BB-12 declined slowly throughout the self-life but
remained within the target level (log 9 CFU/g).  Viable counts of BB-12 remained about the target value
in subsequent weeks (data not shown) but we chose to set the shelf life at 30 days.
Thus a 100 ml
serving would supply no less than 10
10
CFU per day
of BB-12.

Dosage, Preparation and Administration of Investigational Product
Enrolled participants will be given a total 14-day supply of the yogurt following the 4-week washout
period. Participants will drink four (4) ounces of yogurt each day for 14 consecutive days. Yogurt will be
administered via mouth.
5.2.3
Accountability Procedures for the Investigational Product
Written records of receipt and storage of the investigational product, including date of receipt, quantity
received, amount distributed to participants, and final disposition will be maintained. Any known
discrepancies in the accountability will be documented. The investigator will not use the product in an
investigational manner other than that provided for in the protocol; however the product is also a yogurt
and the investigator requests the use of the surplus yogurt for teaching, charitable, and other educational
purposes.
5.2.4
Product Transportation, Handling and Storage
5.2.4.1
Transportation and Handling
The BB-12 and control products will be transported under refrigeration in coolers packed with ice from
the Penn State area via a van driven by Penn State personnel. A member of the study personnel will
meet the Penn State van at a designated meeting point halfway between the two campuses.  The Study

Clinical Research Protocol
personnel will then transport the products, still in its coolers with ice, the remainder of the trip to the
Washington, DC area.  While in transport, each cooler will be equipped with VWR® Digital
Refrigerator/Freezer Thermometer with Alarm, which will alert the study personnel by audible alarm if the
temperature of the coolers increased above the preset acceptable levels (between 32°F and 45°F) at any
time during transport.
5.2.4.2
Storage After Arriving in Washington, DC Area
Once the yogurt drinks arrive at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, they will immediately be
transferred to two refrigerators that are exclusively used for the study. Each refrigerator is equipped with
a lock and a thermometer.  Study personnel will take a daily temperature reading in each refrigerator to
ensure that the yogurt drinks are kept between 32°F and 45°F.  Each refrigerator is equipped with a
SENSAPHONE
®
2.8K Weatherproof Temperature Sensor,
which are connected to a SENSAPHONE
®
400
Remote Monitoring and Alarm Notification System.  The sensor system will trigger an alarm when the
temperature falls below or rises above customizable limits (between 32°F and 45°F) or if there is a power
failure, and will contact up to four study personnel phone numbers.
BB-12 and control yogurt products expire one month from the date of manufacture. The date of
manufacture can be found printed on each bottle of the yogurt drink. Approximately every three weeks,
study personnel will make arrangements with Georgetown University Facilities Management to dispose
of the products before or on the date of expiration.
5.2.4.3
Transportation and Storage While Being Dispensed to Participants
The products will be transported to the participants’ homes in cooler bags. Prior to each delivery, the
study personnel will arrange and confirm a mutually convenient time with the participants to ensure that
they will be home to receive the drink.  This ensures that the participants can place the yogurt drinks into
their home refrigerators immediately upon receipt.
5.2.4.4
Duration of Storage
The products are stored in the study refrigerators at Georgetown University from the day they are
delivered from Penn State (same day delivery) until transported via coolers to study participants.  As
mentioned above, all bottles are labeled with the dates of manufacture and will thus be stored at
Georgetown University until expiration—one month after the manufacture date. Extra yogurt may be
delivered upon request by the participants due to spillage, spoilage or any other reasons as needed.
5.2.4.5
Instructions to Participants Regarding Storage and Dosing
BB-12 and control yogurt products expire one month from the date of manufacture.  The date of
manufacture can be found printed on each bottle of yogurt drink.  Since the drinks are only to be
consumed during a 14-day period and deliveries to participants will coincide with the arrival of fresh
product from Penn State, participants should always have enough unexpired product in their possession
to continue the study.  Participants will also be advised to dispose of any product that has been left out of
the refrigerator for longer than one hour. In such cases, they may contact study personnel for fresh
yogurt drinks to be delivered.
5.2.5
Assessment of Subject Compliance with Investigational Product
DNA extracted from stool samples collected at baseline and at day 7 will be amplified using
B. lactis
specific PCR primers, in order to assess compliance. Participants will not be withdrawn from the study for
missed specimen collections but it will be noted in the study file.

Concomitant Interventions
5.3.1
Allowed Interventions
Once enrolled, participants are allowed interventions or medications as needed, at the guidance of their
personal physician. Since the use of additional or concomitant interventions could bias results,
participants will be asked to report any of these additional treatments. Participants will be advised
multiple times before enrollment to avoid concomitants, but once enrolled they will be told of the
importance of articulating usage. All participants will be given a list of products they should avoid during
the study. Due to the intention-to-treat principle, participants will not be removed from the study but will
continue with all planned study interventions and data collection.
If the participant takes any antibiotics within the 30-day run-in period, they will repeat another 30-day
run-in upon completion of the antibiotics, prior to initiation of the interventions.
5.3.2
Required Interventions
Probiotic supplemented yogurt or control yogurt (if randomized to one of the four groups), and
amoxicillin-clavulanate (all groups) provided by the study.
5.3.3
Prohibited Interventions
Participants will be
ineligible
if they are taking
the following medications at the time of enrollment:
●
Daily diabetes or asthma medication
●
Any gastrointestinal medications, i.e. medicines for irritable bowel syndrome, gastroesophageal
reflux disease, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.
(a
full medication list will be reviewed by the PI
prior to enrollment).
Participants must also avoid the following for the duration of the study:
●
Any probiotic not provided by the study.
●
Any antibiotic not provided by the study.
5.4
Adherence Assessment
We will assess adherence to the yogurt interventions in three distinct manners. First, we will assess
adherence to the antibiotic and yogurt interventions via the daily assessment diary. Second, participants
will take photos of the remaining antibiotics and yogurts bottles at the end of the intervention periods and
send them to the research assistant. Third, at all follow-up phone calls, participants will be asked if they
consumed the yogurt each day and how much was consumed.
Protocol compliance is defined as consuming 2 or more ounces of the assigned study yogurt per day, for 
at least 11 of the 14 days. Participants will not be withdrawn from the study for missed interventions or
specimen collections, but these adherence assessments may be used for any per-protocol analysis.

Clinical Research Protocol
6.2.1
Sample Collection and Analyses
6.2.1.1
Sample Collection
Stool samples will be collected into three sterile, screw-capped tubes and frozen immediately. The
participants will be instructed on how to collect the samples and be provided with written, illustrated
instructions. (Refer to Section 6.2.3, “Stool Collection Instructions for Participants.”)
6.2.1.2
Transport
After collection, a member of the research team will be phoned and instructed to retrieve the samples
and transport them to the laboratory. As part of their training, students and the entire research team will
sign an informational sheet documenting their understanding of the risk of handling potentially infectious
materials. The stool will be transported back to the lab and placed in -80
0
Celsius to freeze for batch
transport to the Institute for Genomic Sciences at the University of Maryland Baltimore (Fraser Lab).
(Refer to Section 6.2.2, “Stool Collection Instructions for Study Personnel.”)
6.2.1.3
Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) Analysis
Primary fecal SCFA produced by anaerobic gut microbiota in the colon (acetate, propionate, butyrate) will
be quantified via a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. Primary fecal SCFA
produced by anaerobic gut microbiota in the colon (acetate, propionate, butyrate) will be quantified via a
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. Fecal samples will be homogenized in 50%
aqueous acetonitrile, vortex mixed and centrifuged to yield a supernatant containing SCFAs. SCFA in the
supernatant are then derivatized with 3-nitrophenylhydrazine to enhance sensitivity of detection. Heavy
isotope labeled derivatizing agent (
13
C
6
-3nitrophenylhydrazine)
is reacted with authentic standards of
SCFAs to generate stable isotope-labeled internal standards for each analyte. SCFA will be separated
using a Waters BEH C18 (2.1 x 100mm, 1.7micron) UPLC column using an acetonitrile/water/formic
acid-based gradient mobile phase where LC-MS/MS analysis will be conducted on either an AB Sciex
5500 QTRAP or a Thermo TSQ QuantumUltra triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in negative
ion mode.
6.2.1.4
Microbiome Community Profiling
The gut microbiota will be characterized by sequencing bacterial 16S rDNA gene amplicons from fecal
samples as previously described.(
109-113
) Raw 16S
rDNA reads will be processed using published
protocols.(
110-112
) Within- (ɑ-diversity) and between-
(β-
diversity) sample comparisons will then be
performed using QIIME.(
113
) Microbiota will be compared
cross-sectionally and longitudinally, with
emphasis on parameters such as the Bray-Curtis similarity score,(
114
) Chao1 metric (ɑ-diversity or
richness), the Shannon index (abundance and evenness of species in a community), determined using
standard tools, such as Mothur,(
115
) QIIME,(
113
) and
statistical R package (www.r-project.org). In
addition, statistically significant correlations between specific microbiota members and clinical outcomes
will be determined using bioinformatics tools, such as eLSA,(
116
) Metastats,(
117
) and LEfSe.(
118
) The
16S rRNA dataset will also be used to simulate the function of the microbiota using PiCRUSt(
119
) which
uses available genome sequence data to infer functional gene contents based on the 16S rRNA
microbiota composition.
6.2.1.5
Real Time qPCR Analysis of Total Bacterial Number
Reactions will be performed in duplicate using the microbial qPCR DNA kit (Qiagen) and analyzed on the
Fluidigm Biomark platform.

Screening Evaluation and Consenting Procedure
Individuals who are interested in participating in this study will contact a member of the research team by
phone, e-mail, or in-person. A member of the research team will establish contact with the individual,
either by phone or in-person, and provide a brief overview of the study and answer any questions. If the
individual would still like to participate, the research coordinator or assistant will ask questions from a
pre-screening form to assess eligibility and exclusion criteria. A visit for enrollment and informed consent
will be arranged at the participant’s home or the Merenstein lab at the Georgetown University Medical
Center, per the participant’s preference.
If the basic screening criteria are met, the potential participant will be offered the opportunity for study
participation and consent will be obtained in-person. Information provided during the consent process
include the purpose of the study, procedures, withdrawal procedures, study termination, risk/discomforts,
benefits, costs, compensation, and alternatives to participation.
If the individual does not qualify after the pre-screening, or decides not to participate, the pre-screening
form will document the reason, and will be filed separately from the participant records, without
personally identifiable information. The research staff will maintain a screening log to track screen fails
and enrollments.
A single informed consent form is initiated prior to an individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and
continuing throughout an individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of risks and possible
benefits of this study will be provided to the participants. A single consent form describing in detail the
study interventions/products, study procedures, and risks, are given to the participants and written
documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting intervention/administering study product.
The research team will discuss all information outlined in the informed consent document with
prospective participants to ensure that they understand the nature of the research and can voluntarily
decide whether or not to participate.
Research staff will document the following on the Informed Consent Process Documentation form:
a) Were the Informed Consent Form, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
Authorization and related study documents thoroughly reviewed with the study participant?; b) Did the
study participant have sufficient time to review the documents and ask questions?; c) Was the Informed
Consent and HIPAA Authorization signed prior to the initiation of any study related procedures?; d) Were
copies of the signed documents given to the study participant?
6.5
Enrollment, Baseline, and Randomization
6.5.1
Enrollment
The enrollment/baseline visit will take place at the participants’ homes or an office where comfort and
confidentiality is assured. There is no clinic visit associated with this study. The purpose of this visit is to
have in-person time to collect baseline data, explain all forms, go over the schedule of visits and
intervention, and give the participant the initial compensation. No physical exams or medical
assessments will be conducted as part of the screening or enrollment process.

6.5.2
Baseline Assessments
Once informed consent is given and it is confirmed that the participant meets all inclusion and exclusion
criteria, baseline data will be collected. These include: Baseline Health Status and Demographic
Information.
Stools will be collected multiple times throughout the study. Research staff will be trained on how to
properly transport stool and how to instruct participants on collecting stool.
During the initial visit, participants will also be given all materials to collect stools, the diary, and study
materials as well as the initial compensation. The participant will commence the 30-day run-in period.
During this 30-day run-in period, the participant will refrain from antibiotics and probiotics (a “What Not to
Eat list will be provided) and provide two baseline stool samples--one pre run-in, and one post run-in
(prior to starting the yogurt and antibiotics).
Following the run-in period and prior to the yogurt start day (day 1), research staff will contact the
participant in order to complete the Post Run-in Health Status form and repeat the Inclusion/Exclusion
form to ensure that the participants are still eligible. Participants who start an exclusionary medication or
experience an onset of an exclusionary, nontransient health condition from the time of enrollment will be
withdrawn from the study.
Should the participant take any antibiotics during this 30-day run-in period, they will start another 30-day
run-in cycle after the antibiotics are completed. The initiation of the yogurt and antibiotic interventions
(day 1) will be delayed until this additional run-in cycle is complete. Participants who take any non-study
probiotics during this 30-day run-in period will document any use on the Post Run-In Health Status form.
Participants who need to delay their day 1 (initiation of the yogurt and antibiotic intervention), e.g. to
complete a full 30-day run-in or due to transient conditions, can be held for a future cohort for up to 90
days from the day the informed consent was signed, without the need to re-consent. After 90 days, the
participant will be re-consented prior to starting the interventions.
Participants who are still eligible based on the completion of the Post Run-in Health Status and post
run-in Inclusion/Exclusion forms will then be randomized to receive the BB-12 yogurt, control yogurt, or
no yogurt for days 1 through 14 to be taken once a day. In addition, they will also receive measuring cups
that denote a level of 4 ounces. The amount of BB-12 supplemented yogurt drink to be supplied will be 4
ounces per day, which is slightly more than 100 grams/day.
6.5.3
Randomization
The group allocation ratio is 28:28:28:28:12: 28 in each of the two BB-12 yogurt groups, 28 in each of the
two control yogurt groups, and 12 in the no yogurt control group. The randomization scheme will be
generated by the study statistician using permuted blocks sizes of 4, 8, and 12 in random order. It will be
impossible for research personnel involved with participants to adjust randomization or discern what
drinks participants were receiving, ensuring true allocation concealment. Participants who receive the
control product will receive all identical interventions (i.e. stool collection, follow-up, etc.) that the BB-12
group receives.
Randomization will be completed after the participant consents to the study and completes the baseline
assessment and run-in. The yogurt or antibiotic interventions may only be initiated after randomization.

Clinical Research Protocol
6.6
Blinding
Each participant in the four yogurt groups will be randomly placed into one of the two arms receiving
yogurt, randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either BB-12-supplemented yogurt or an identical yogurt
without the added BB-12 probiotic. Both contain the starter culture YF-L702 (a mixed culture of
Streptococcus thermophilus
and
Lactobacillus delbrueckii
subsp.
bulgaricus
). The yogurts are similar in
taste and will have identical nutritional value, such as the same amount of calcium, protein, calories, etc.
The yogurts are packed in identical packaging with four different bin numbers. The participants, PIs,
research staff are all blinded to the treatment allocation.
The study statistician will generate two group-labels (e.g. A, B) where two bin numbers correspond to
one group, and two bin numbers correspond to the other group. . However, Dr. D’Amico will be blinded to
which group received the BB-12 yogurt and which received the control yogurt. The non-yogurt group will
be considered as a separate arm before unblinding.
PSU will send yogurt in four bins with distinct numbers, two of which will be the control yogurt and two
will be the BB-12 yogurt. Only the researchers at Maryland will know which bin numbers correspond to
‘group 1’ and which correspond to ‘group 2’, but will not know which is the active or control. PSU and
Maryland have no contact with participants and will not release this information to the study team until
the analyses are completed and databases are locked.
All study personnel at Georgetown and Dr. D’Amico will remain blinded throughout the study until the
databases are locked. In the unfortunate event that a participant experiences a serious adverse event or
emergency that requires unmasking the treatment groups, Dr. Ranit Mishori, a member of the
Department of Family Medicine who is not affiliated with the study, will discuss the assignment and
follow-up with the participant and their treating physician. Dr. Mishori has done this for our previous
clinical trials.
6.7
Follow-up Visits
6.7.1
Telephone Follow-up
Follow-up phone visits will be completed on Days 7, 14 and 30 (±2 days). It is imperative that all visits be
completed in a timely and regular fashion. Generally, the Follow-Up Form will be the only form completed
during the phone calls, but at times depending on participant’s report, there may be another form or two.
The follow up period includes all the time previous to the day of the interview.  Any incidents that happen
the day of the visit would be captured in the next Follow Up Visit.
There will be a set day that each subsequent visit should be completed for each participant. The
research personnel should call all participant’s phone numbers at least one time per day in order to
collect the data. If more than 3 business days have passed from the set day, the RA should alert the PI
that this week’s Follow-Up Form has not yet been completed. If the RA is not able to contact the
participant, a Missed Visit Report Form should be completed instead and the PI should be alerted once
again.
If a participant is unmasked at any point in time during the study, the PI will be alerted immediately. A
Georgetown University employee in the Department of Family Medicine not associated with the study will
follow up with this participant from this point on. This particular research personnel is not to discuss any
information regarding this occurrence with any other personnel other than the PI.

6.7.2
Telephone Follow Up Script
In general, the Day 7, 14 and 30 (±2 days) follow up will be administered over the phone, but may be
completed in person. These phone visits are when the primary data will be collected. It is imperative that
all visits be completed in a timely and regular fashion.
1)
[If assigned to a yogurt group]
Drink Bin Number:
Make sure the participant has the correct drink bin
number as you are completing the Follow-Up Form.
a)
Ask the participant the number on the drink bottles and this should be confirmed with the
randomization form.
b)
If this number is not consistent, the participant should be alerted not consume any more drinks
until further notice and the project coordinator should be immediately alerted after completing this
week’s Follow-Up Form.
c)
Remind the participant when they are supposed to take the yogurt (concurrently or delayed).
2)
Daily Assessment Diary:
Ask the participant to collect
the Daily Assessment
Diary for the phone
conversation. A lot of the information that will be collected on the Follow-Up Form has been collected
by the participant on their Daily Assessment Diary. If they have not been using the Daily Assessment
Diary, please positively stress the importance of the Daily Assessment Diary.
3)
Explain to participant that we are supposed to fill out this Follow-Up Form today and it should take
about 5 minutes.
4)
Administer Follow-Up Form.
●
When entering sick days, missing school or work, etc., this should be generally whole integers.
However, it is possible that a participant missed only 2 hours to go to the doctor. All numbers
under 4 hours should be counted at 0.5 days, and all those above rounded up to the next integer.
●
The participant needs to decide if any activities were missed due to an illness. This is for all
illnesses, even those that we are not collecting data about.
●
For some questions the RA may say, “Did you visit a doctor?”  A doctor is defined as any medical
personnel in this study.  Therefore, the participant may say, “Never, but s/he saw a nurse
practitioner.”  Please count this the same as seeing the doctor.
●
Compliance:
Please let the participant know that we
would like them to consume the
interventions, diaries, and sample collections as per the schedule, but regardless, we appreciate
their participation.
●
Adverse Events:
If the participant believes any AE
occurred, it is imperative that the RA
immediately fill out an AE Form, and if there are any SAE, alert the PI and project coordinator
immediately.
●
Confirm the date and time for the next visit or call.
●
At day 7, remind the participant to take a photo of the remaining antibiotics bottles.
●
[If assigned to a yogurt group] At day 14, remind the participant to take a photo of the remaining
yogurt bottle.

SAFETY ASSESSMENTS
7.1
Specification of Safety Parameters
We will alert the participants of the common reactions to yogurt and by listing common reactions for them
to monitor. We will also have close follow-up and 24-hour phone line accessibility if there is a question of
an allergic or idiosyncratic reaction.
Details of all adverse events reported by participants or observed by research personnel will be recorded
in the adverse event report forms. All adverse events observed will be recorded separately and all will be
reported to the IRB on IRB Adverse Event forms.
In order to prevent the occurrence of adverse events, we will be stringent in enforcing our exclusion
criteria, paying particular attention to the potential for an allergic reaction to strawberry or yogurt on the
part of the participant.
Any participants who develop evidence of allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the
investigational product
will be withdrawn from the
clinica
l
study and receive no further doses of either
drink. We will continue to follow these participants for safety for the remainder of the study.
7.2
Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters
Unanticipated problems will be recorded in the data collection system throughout the study.
Details of all expected and unexpected adverse events reported by participants during follow -up calls,
spontaneously, or observed by research personnel must be recorded in the adverse event report forms.
Participants will be provided with a daily diary with a list of the most likely possible adverse events (see
Table 10
), where they can document expected and other
unexpected events not already listed. All
non -serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB during continuing review. All AEs regardless of
severity level will be evaluated by the DSMB during scheduled meetings.
If a participant reports an AE/SAE that does not yet have a Date of Resolution (ongoing) and is
continuous (no more than two days without interruption) across two follow -up periods, this AE/SAE will
be considered one event. The total duration of the AE/SAE will be collected but only one AE/SAE report
form will be completed for this particular event. If the symptoms resolved for more than two days before
recurrence, these will be reported as separate events.
The study staff will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent
is obtained until 7 (for non- serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At
each study visit, the study staff will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events
will be followed for outcome information until satisfactory resolution or stabilization. In the event of SAEs,
all clinical and laboratory investigations considered necessary by the investigator will continue until
values have returned to normal. The investigator will provide the IRB with copies of results of
examinations and treatment carried out during the follow -up of SAEs. These reports will be provided to
the FDA and the NCCIH Program Official.
7.3
Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An
adverse event (AE)
is any untoward medical occurrence
in a participant during participation in the
clinical study or with use of the experimental agent being studied. An adverse finding can include a sign,
symptom, abnormal assessment (laboratory test value, vital signs, electrocardiogram finding, etc.), or
any combination of these regardless of relationship to participation in the study. This includes events not
present at the start of the study, or worsening in grade during the course of the study. An AE can be

68
January 25, 2022 v 1.4
IND # 13691 Merenstein/Fraser
Clinical Research Protocol
reported anytime after study enrollment; a participant is considered enrolled once the informed consent
form is signed.
A
serious adverse event (SAE)
is one that meets one
or more of the following criteria:
●
Results in death
●
Is life -threatening (places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred)
●
Results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
●
Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity
●
Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect
An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization
may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize
the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in
this definition.
Unanticipated Problems (UP):
The Office for Human
Research Protections (OHRP) considers
unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident,
experience, or outcome that meets
all
of the following
criteria:
●
Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are
described in the protocol related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied;
●
Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the
procedures involved in the research); and
●
Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical,
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.
7.4
Characteristics of an Adverse Event
7.4.1
Relationship to Study Intervention
To assess relationship of an event to study intervention, the following guidelines are used:
1.
Related (Possibly Related, Probably Related, Definitely Related)
a. The event is known to occur with the study intervention.
b. There is a temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset.
c. The event abates when the intervention is discontinued.
d. The event reappears upon a re challenge with the intervention.
2.
Not Related (Unlikely Related, Not Related)
a. There is no temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset.
b. An alternate etiology has been established.
7.4.2
Expectedness of SAEs
The Study PIs and Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be responsible for determining whether an
SAE is expected or unexpected. An adverse event will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity,
or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the
intervention.

Severity of Event
Adverse events will be graded according to the National Cancer Institutes’ Common
Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0:
1.
Grade 1 Mild
: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical
or diagnostic observations only; no
intervention indicated; no to minimal impact on activities of daily living (ADL).
2.
Grade 2 Moderate
: minimal, local, or non invasive
intervention indicated; moderate impact on ADL.
3.
Grade 3  Severe
: severe or medically significant
but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization
or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; needs major assistance with ADL.
4.
Grade 4  Potentially life -threatening
: life -threatening
consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
5.
Grade 5  Death
: death related to AE.
Please note that a severe AE and an SAE are distinct terms.
7.5
Expected Risks
The expected risks and side effects (listed in
Table
10
) for each intervention and procedure are as
follows:
●
Cultured yogurt: digestive/gastrointestinal problems such as stomach ache, constipation, diarrhea,
flatulence, fever, lack of appetite, vomiting, and loose, watery bowels, and allergic reaction to any of
the yogurt ingredients, most likely strawberry.
●
Amoxicillin -clavulanate: nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhea, upset stomach and mild to severe skin
rash. The most serious potential risk is diarrhea caused by a
Clostridium difficile
infection.
Symptoms of
C.
difficile
infection include stomach
pain or tenderness, bloody stools, fever, nausea,
and diarrhea.
●
Fecal sample collection: there are no known risks. However, there may be some discomfort with
fecal sample collection.
These risks are considered to be minimal and are addressed in the protocol and consent form.
It will be explained to the participants that there may also be side effects, other than those listed, that we
cannot predict. Many side effects go away shortly after the treatments are stopped, but in some cases
side effects can be serious, long lasting or permanent. Participants will be informed to discuss any
questions about potential risks with the researchers and their primary care providers. Anyone who
develops evidence of allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the yogurt products will be
withdrawn from the study and receive no further doses. We will continue to monitor these participants for
safety until the event sufficiently resolves.
7.6
Reporting Procedures
7.6.1
Unanticipated Problem Reporting
Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for unanticipated problems require the creation and
completion of an unanticipated problem report form. OHRP recommends that investigators include the
following information when reporting an adverse event, or any other incident, experience, or outcome as
an unanticipated problem to the IRB:
●
Appropriate identifying information for the research protocol, such as the title, investigator’s name,
and the IRB project number;
●
A detailed description of the adverse event, incident, experience, or outcome;
IRB ID: STUDY00002431
Page
42
of
68
January 25, 2022 v 1.4
IND # 13691 Merenstein/Fraser
Clinical Research Protocol
●
An explanation of the basis for determining that the adverse event, incident, experience, or
outcome represents an unanticipated problem;
●
A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are
proposed in response to the unanticipated problem.
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, unanticipated problems will be reported using the
following timeline:
●
Unanticipated problems that are serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB, DSMB, and
NCCIH within 7 days of the investigator becoming aware of the event.
●
Any other unanticipated problem will be reported to the IRB, DSMB, and NCCIH within 14 days of
the investigator becoming aware of the problem.
●
All unanticipated problems should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by
an institution’s written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and OHRP
within one month of the IRB’s receipt of the report of the problem from the investigator.
7.6.1
Adverse Event Reporting
SAEs that are unanticipated, serious, and possibly related to the study intervention will be reported to the
DSMB, IRB, and NCCIH in accordance with requirements.
If any SAEs are reported, the PIs will be alerted immediately, as well as the IRB. If deemed necessary,
members of DSMB will be alerted immediately. The PIs and/or IRB will decide if stopping criteria have
been met. If they believe so, an ad hoc teleconference will be arranged by the DSMB Administrator. No
other participants will be enrolled until after the teleconference, which will occur within 24 hours.
Additionally, SAEs will be reported using the following timeline:
●
Unexpected fatal or life-threatening AEs related to the intervention will be reported to the NCCIH
Program Officer, and DSMB within 3 days of the investigator becoming aware of the event. Other
serious and unexpected AEs related to the intervention will be reported within 7 days.
●
Anticipated or unrelated SAEs will be handled in a less urgent manner but will be reported to the
DSMB, IRB, and other oversight organizations in accordance with their requirements and will be
reported to NCCIH on an annual basis.
●
All other AEs documented during the course of the trial will be reported to NCCIH on an annual basis
by way of inclusion in the annual report and in the annual AE summary which will be provided to
NCCIH and to the DSMB. The DSMB Report will state that all AEs have been reviewed.
7.7
Follow-up for Adverse Events
The following applies only for non-serious adverse events; SAEs will follow the aforementioned policies
for reporting and monitoring of serious adverse events.
For non-serious AE, if the AE has not resolved by the Day 14 follow-up, then depending on the type of
AE (expected or unexpected) the research assistant will either continue to follow-up with the participant
or consider Day 14 as the final Date of Resolution:
●
If the AE reported is listed on the Adverse Event Report Form (Codes 1-12; as listed in
Table 10
)
as a possible, expected AE, the research assistant will continue to follow-up the participant a
minimum of every 4 days until the AE resolves to record the Date of Resolution.
●
If the AE reported is listed as “Other” (Code 13), or unexpected, and the Principal Investigator

Clinical Research Protocol
AND participant considers the AE is not related/or is unlikely related to the intervention, the
research assistant will not continue to follow-up past the Day 14 follow-up and will consider Day
14 as the final Date of Resolution.
7.8
Safety Monitoring
7.8.1
Data Safety Monitoring Board
The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will function as an independent oversight committee charged
with overseeing participant safety and providing recommendations to the PIs and Co -investigators
regarding the continuing conduct of the study. The DSMB will review periodic blinded Safety Reports.
Unblinded but sealed Safety Reports will be available to each DSMB member, should the committee
determine that review of unblinded safety data is warranted.
The DSMB will include independent individuals not involved in this research study and is comprised of
members Nicole Prewitt (community representative), Alexander Krist (physician), Geoffrey Preidis
(probiotics and microbiome physician- scientist) and Chair, Elizabeth Carter (statistician). No member of
the Committee has collaborated or co -published with the PIs within the past three years. They are
qualified to review the patient safety data generated by this study because of their unique expertise. The
clinical PI (Merenstein) and research team will provide the DSMB with an up to date data set to ensure
safety, effective data collection and progress. During the course of the study, the DSMB will meet
regularly to review adverse events data and approve continuation of the protocol.
7.8.2
Safety Reports
Study progress and safety will be reviewed 25%, 50% and 75% data completion (and more frequently if
needed). Progress reports, including patient recruitment, retention/attrition, and AEs will be provided to
the DSMB. A Safety Report will be compiled and will include a list and summary of AEs. In addition, the
reports will address (1) whether AE rates are consistent with pre -study assumptions; (2) reason for
dropouts from the study; (3) whether all participants met entry criteria; (4) whether continuation of the
study is justified on the basis that additional data are needed to accomplish the stated aims of the study;
and (5) conditions whereby the study might be terminated prematurely. The report will be sent to the
DSMB and will be forwarded to the IRB and NCCIH. The IRB and other applicable recipients will review
the progress of this study on an annual basis.
The study team will generate Study Reports for the DSMB and will provide information on the following
study parameters: the status of follow -ups, adverse events and enrollment updates. Study Report tables
will be generated only from aggregate (not by group assignment) baseline and aggregate safety data for
the study population.

Clinical Research Protocol
8. INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION
Study enrollment and/or interventions may be temporarily suspended or terminated if:
●
Any study participant experiences death that the DSMB, PIs or IRB believes may be related to the
study interventions.
●
If a statistically or clinically significant number of SAEs or hospitalizations occur that the DSMB
believes may be related to the treatment.
●
New information from outside studies reveals that it would be unethical to continue enrolling
participants in the study.
●
The IRB decides that the study should be stopped.
●
If statistical differences among the primary outcomes will be determined that require stopping. For
example, if the differences among certain interventions make it unethical to continue or if the effect
size is so small that it is implausible a positive outcome could occur.
A safety review by the DSMB, IRB, and/or NCCIH will be convened to determine if the study
should continue per protocol, proceed with enhanced monitoring, be further investigated, be
discontinued, or be modified and then proceed. The FDA and NCCIH retain the authority to
suspend additional enrollment and study interventions and administration of study product for the
entire study, as applicable.
This study will be stopped prior to its completion if:
(1)
the intervention is associated with adverse effects that call into question the safety of the
intervention;
(2)
difficulty in study recruitment or retention will significantly impact the ability to evaluate the study
endpoints;
(3)
any new information becomes available during the trial that necessitates stopping the trial; or
(4)
other situations occur that might warrant stopping the trial.
Individuals may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following:
●
Adverse events; the clinical PI (DM) will discuss AEs with the participant, and possibly with their
personal physician, as needed, to determine whether the participant should be withdrawn from the
study.
●
If participants are deemed to be non cooperative (e.g. refuse to participate in follow- up calls or fail to
complete diaries).
●
If participants are lost to follow up, i.e. more than 7 days without contact with study personnel during
the follow-up period.
●
Participants will not be withdrawn from the study solely for missed interventions or specimen
collections, but may be withdrawn for non-cooperation or lost to follow-up.
●
Serious adverse events related to the interventions, as determined by the PIs, participant or
participant’s physician.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
9.1
General Design Issues
Primary Hypothesis:
Antibiotics will result in a reduction
in fecal SCFA. BB-12 supplementation will
protect against antibiotic-induced SCFA (with acetate levels being used to represent the production of
SCFA by gut microbiota) reduction and/or be associated with a more rapid return to baseline SCFA levels
(acetate), compared to participants who receive a control yogurt without BB-12.
As reported by Hoverstad et al. (1986) and Clausen (1991), we hypothesize that antibiotic administration
for 7 days will decrease mean fecal acetate levels for each participant, and that upon conclusion of
antibiotic therapy fecal acetate levels will return toward baseline values for each participant. This is
consistent with what we observed in our R61 study.
We will compare the mean fecal acetate levels at days 7 and 30 versus the baseline values for
participants receiving BB-12 or control yogurt. A significantly higher mean level of fecal acetate,
calculated using one-way analysis of variance (Ganes-Howell
post hoc
test) in participants receiving
BB-12 yogurt compared to the control yogurt during or after antibiotic administration, will be consistent
with our findings in the R61 on the effect of BB-12.
We are moving into the R33 phase because the R61 demonstrated the expected changes described for
each signature, in the direction a priori predicted.
Timing Hypothesis: There is widespread hypothetical belief that timing of probiotic consumption may
impact efficacy. However, to our knowledge this has not been studied while simultaneously providing
antibiotics. We do not believe timing of probiotic and antibiotic consumption will impact SCFA changes.
Secondary Hypothesis:
Antibiotics will result in a
decrease in the overall number and diversity of
bacterial species present in the fecal microbiota. BB-12 supplementation will protect against
antibiotic-induced shifts in the microbiota and/or will be associated with a quicker return to a baseline
microbiota composition, as compared to the control group. Microbiota composition will be assessed with
16S rDNA profiling and qPCR.
9.2
Sample Size and Randomization
Sample size calculations were informed by our data from the R61 Phase. In our data, we compared
changes in mean SCFA levels between fecal samples from the control group and the active (BB-12
treated) collected at baseline and those collected after seven days administration of antibiotics or placebo
(day 7) as well as subsequent timepoints at day 14, day 21, and day 30. We assume that we will see a
similar baseline and variability at the various time points as our average baseline acetate levels (based
upon our data combining both the control and active group) of 47 ± 20 µM. In the R61 phase, we proposed
to compare differences at day 7 and day 30. Since we observed the most pronounced difference in acetate
at day 30, we calculated the R33 sample size based upon those changes. In our proposed R33 study , we
assume we will see a similar acetate value in the control as we did in the R61 phase which was (decrease
of 25% from average baseline) 35.25 ± 20 µM and a similar acetate level in the active (BB-12) which was
(decrease of only 2% from average baseline) 46 ± 20 µM. Assuming equal sample size per group, SD=20,
and four groups in total [(i) BB-12: concurrent dosing, (ii) control: concurrent dosing, (iii) BB-12: 4 hour
delay, (iv) control: 4 hour delay], a total sample size of 108 participants (27/group) will achieve a power of
80% to detect a difference of 0.05 between the BB-12/concurrent dosing and the BB-12/4 hour delay
groups from the control. In order to balance randomization over time, the number per group has been

Clinical Research Protocol
updated to 28/group and 12 in the antibiotic-only group (divisible by 4 treatment groups), for a total
enrollment of 124 participants.
9.2.1
Treatment Assignment Procedures
See Section 6.5.3 on Randomization.
The group allocation ratio is 28:28:28:28:12: 28 BB-12 yogurt concurrent consumption, 28 BB-12 yogurt
delayed consumption, 28 control yogurt concurrent consumption, and 28 control yogurt delayed
consumption, and 12 no yogurt control participants.
The web-based system will integrate the randomization scheme and automatically assign enrolled
participants to the corresponding allocation. All research personnel will be naive to group assignments.
9.3
Definition of Populations
Statistical analysis on the primary outcome will be performed using the intention to treat principle; all
subjects enrolled and randomized will be accounted for in the final analysis in their randomized group.
We will also examine the per protocol group separately and report both the intention-to-treat and per
protocol analyses.
The mixed effect model will be
used, which is compatible with unbalanced outcome
measurements. The multiple imputation analysis will be performed when the covariates are missing.
9.4
Interim Analyses and Stopping Rules
Since this is a mechanistic study, analyses of primary and secondary outcome data will not be conducted
before the study is completed. The main purpose is to examine the effects of the treatment of BB-12 (on
SCFA and microbiome changes), and thus non-inferiority or bio-equivalence testing is not indicated. There
will be no interim or futility analysis due to mechanistic hypotheses.
9.5
Outcomes
9.5.1
Primary Outcome
The primary outcome is a difference, measured at day 7, in antibiotic-induced changes in fecal SCFA
(with a particular focus on acetate) in participants receiving BB-12-supplemented yogurt versus
non-supplemented control yogurt.
9.5.2
Secondary Outcomes
The secondary outcome is a difference, measured at days 7 and 14, in antibiotic-induced changes in the
number and diversity of bacteria in the gut microbiota.
9.6
Anticipated Results
The most likely outcomes from the study are:
1.
+/- impact of BB-12 on fecal SCFA levels
2.
+/- impact of BB-12 on gut microbiota composition (measured to quantify level of disruption
achieved by antibiotics as a comparator within this study)
3.
+/- impact of BB-12 on AAD (measured, but study not powered to detect clinical difference of
AAD).
4.
4. +/- impact of BB-12 influenced by the timing between AMC dose and BB-12 consumption.
Since BB-12 was found to have a positive effect on the biological signature (acetate levels) as compared

Clinical Research Protocol
to the control, the work to be carried out in the R33 will replicate the R61 methods in a second cohort of
patients, with the addition of timing of probiotic administration, as well as expanding the analysis to
characterize the functional microbiome using metatranscriptomic methods. This information will provide a
framework for future research in the characterization of other probiotic strains for AAD.
9.7
Data Analyses
To examine the primary hypothesis that BB-12 supplementation will protect against antibiotic-induced
SCFA reduction, the mixed model will be used to analyze the treatment effect on the antibiotic-induced
SCFA reduction. Statistical analyses will be performed using intent-to-treat analytic strategies. The mixed
effect model will be used, which is compatible with unbalanced outcome measurements. The change of
SCFA from baseline will be considered as the outcome variable of the mixed model. All time points will
be included for the analysis. Covariates including age, sex, BMI and time (a continuous variable) will be
adjusted when necessary. In addition, the time and treatment interaction term will be assessed by the
likelihood ratio test. The random intercept will be used and the AR1 and/or compound symmetry
covariance structure will be considered (and then the likelihood test can help to determine the more
appropriate covariance structure). The final model selection will be performed based on information
criteria such as Akaike information criterion (AIC) or Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Power: with a
sample size of 40 subjects in the treatment arm and 20 subjects in the placebo arm and attrition rate of
5% at day six and 20% at day 30, we would have power of 82% to detect a moderate effect size of
Cohen’s d = 0.63 (assuming the intra-correlation correlation coefficient is 0.3). The 
α 
level of 0.05 will be
used for the analysis. Since the effect size of previous study (reduction in acetate levels) is Cohen’s d
=1.23, we should have ample power to detect the treatment effect. (The power calculation is based on
the R software and packages simr, sjstats, and pwr).
9.8
Missing Data
We understand the importance of limiting missing data and as in previous studies the PI and project
coordinator will work very closely to prevent missing data. However, there will be some missing data,
which we anticipate will be missing at random (MAR). Although it is challenging to test the assumption
MAR versus missing not at random (random) due to incomplete information for such test (122), we will
carefully examine the missing patterns and perform sensitivity analysis for the MAR assumption (123).
The multiple imputation will be used to deal with the missing data (e.g. the missing covariate and
baseline outcome variable).
A sensitivity analysis could be used to explore the impact of departures from the MAR assumption
underlying the main analysis. For example, we let the mean of observed data and the mean of the
unobserved data differ from each other, adjusted for other observed variables. Under an MAR
analysis, 
the difference
is assumed to be zero.  We
then evaluate the impact of difference on treatment
effect inference under MAR assumption.
To test the secondary hypothesis, we will examine the treatment effects on multiple microbiota
composition scores, for example, Bray-Curtis similarity score, Chao1 metric (
α-
diversity or richness), the
Shannon index. We will apply mixed models to analyze these metrics and then perform multiple testing
adjustments using FDR and/or FWER correction..

10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
10.1
Data Collection Forms
Blinded research assistants will be collecting participant information in person or over the phone, and will
be responsible for picking up samples from participants. All investigators and research personnel will
take required classes on human subject research and the protection of individually identifiable health
information prior to any contact with the participants.
Participants will be completing questionnaires with protected health information, and the release of
confidential information is a risk. The research staff will take all necessary precautions to minimize this
risk. Participants’ addresses and phone numbers will be collected, as will other private health
information. In accordance with the appropriate HIPAA regulations, all information will be protected and
kept confidential at all times. All contact and study information will be kept on password-protected
computers or online databases, participants will be identified by code, and no information will be released
without proper approvals or permissions.
10.2
Data Management
Data management is a joint effort between the study team, PIs, and the biostatistician. The investigators
are responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.
All source documents and data should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate and
complete (ALCOAC). The investigators will maintain adequate case histories of study participants,
including accurate case report forms (CRFs), and source documentation.
10.2.1
Data Collection
Data collection and accurate documentation are the responsibility of the study staff under the supervision
of the investigator. All source documents and laboratory reports are maintained by the study team, who
will ensure that they are accurate and complete. Unanticipated problems and adverse events must be
reviewed by the investigator or designee.
10.2.2
Data Management System
This study uses a project database within the Remote Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system hosted
by MedStar Health Research Institute (MHRI), and is FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliant. The database will
be secured with individual account
logins and password
protection. Each user must use their unique,
assigned user account and password.
The database incorporates an electronic audit trail to show change(s) to data after original entry
including the date/time and user making the change. REDCap has some built in validation processes to
ensure data quality, including minimum/maximum ranges, data type, calculations, date, and branching
logic fields.
The data entry system is designed to allow information contained on a single form to be entered over one
or multiple keying sessions. For direct electronic capture, it is recommended to enter any one form in its
entirety rather than breaking up a single form into multiple keying sessions. Once an entry is created, any
later additions or changes to incomplete forms or sessions will require the user to log a ‘change reason’.
The data collection forms were also designed for keying directly into the data entry system without the
need for additional transcription.

Clinical Research Protocol
Entries in REDCap may be saved locally on the device and then backed up on the server once the
device is online. In the case of an outage of the REDCap system, a backup paper form will be used to
collect the data, and will be entered into the database at a later time.
The biostatistician will receive only coded information that is entered into the database under study
identification numbers. Electronic communication with outside collaborators will involve only de-identified
information.
10.2.3
Source Documentation
Source documents are original documents, data, and records (e.g., hospital records, clinical and office
charts, laboratory reports, memoranda, diaries or evaluation checklists, or pharmacy dispensing records)
which first records a finding, observation, or other activity during a study.
Since this study will enroll generally healthy participants and data are entered directly into the electronic
database, the case report and data collection forms will serve as the source documents. Any hardcopy
participant study records, such as case report forms, medical records (if applicable), and participant files,
are kept in a locked cabinet inside a locked office. Electronic records, identified by study ID code only,
are stored in the REDCap database or on Georgetown University secure servers, both of which require a
username and password. Only authorized, trained research staff will have access to the data.

Quality Assurance
10.3.1
Training
All study staff will complete training on appropriate data collection and entry procedures, as well as the
study specific databases. Completed trainings will be recorded in the training log, which is on file in the
study regulatory binder. All key personnel (all individuals responsible for the design and conduct of this
study) have completed Human Subjects Research Protection Training.
10.3.2
Quality Control
The PI of the recruitment site, Dr. Merenstein, is responsible for quality management for this study. The
Research Associate has been designated by Dr. Merenstein to be responsible for the implementation of
the quality management plan.
All source documents and case report forms are to be completed in a manner to ensure the data is
attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate and complete. ALCOAC applies to both paper
and electronic source data, and the records that hold that data. The REDCap system uses an electronic
audit trail and signature capability to ensure each addition or change in the database is attributable to a
unique user, when it was added/changed, the reason for the change, and when the review of the record
is completed.
10.3.3
Metrics
Data validation and quality reports will be generated on a bi-monthly basis. This report will include
validation errors and other discrepancies in the data. The study staff will be responsible for resolving
errors and discrepancies by checking the source documents and making the necessary changes in the
database. Discrepancies should be resolved within 10 business days.
Performance reports will be sent to Dr. Merenstein quarterly. These will report on performance trends, i.e.
enrollment status compared to enrollment goals, rates of missed visits, lost to follow- ups, and missing
data. The PIs can use these reports to gauge how the study team is performing in the study.
10.3.4
Protocol Deviations
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol or Good Clinical Practice (GCP)
requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigators, or the
study personnel. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site and
implemented promptly. It is the responsibility of the study personnel to use continuous vigilance to
identify protocol deviations. All deviations from the protocol must be addressed in study subject source
documents. Protocol deviations must be sent to the local IRB per their guidelines. The PIs/study
personnel will be responsible for knowing and adhering to their IRB requirements.
10.3.5
Monitoring
During the first year of recruitment, an internal source verification and file audit will be conducted on
three randomly selected participant records. Study personnel will not be notified of the three charts in
advance and must be prepared to pull all source documents. The audit is expected to last one day and
will be conducted by Tina Tan, the research associate.

Clinical Research Protocol
During the audit, the study databases will be compared with the source documents, and the reviewer will
check that all participants have signed informed consents, verify protocol procedures and records, and
ensure that the research personnel have up to date study documentation available. The reviewer will
provide a written report of all findings to the PI within 10 business days of the audit. The PI will send a
written response within 10 business days of receiving the audit report to document the response and
corrective action plans. Significant protocol deviations or issues will be added to the next DSMB report.

11. PARTICIPANT RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY
11.1
Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review
Prior to enrollment of subjects into this trial, the approved protocol and the informed consent form as well
as all internal and external advertisements will be reviewed and approved by the Georgetown University
IRB. The Georgetown University IRB operates under the appropriate Federal Regulations, and the
research team have taken required classes on human subject research, ethics and HIPAA.
The responsible official at the Georgetown University IRB will provide the IRB letter of approval of the
protocol prior to the start of this trial. Any amendments to the protocol will be submitted to the IRB and
approval obtained prior to implementation.
11.2
Informed Consent Forms
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to an individual’s agreeing to participate in the study
and continuing throughout an individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of risks and possible
benefits of this therapy will be provided to the participants. Consent forms describing in detail the study
interventions/products, study procedures, and risks are given to the participants and written
documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting interventions or administering study
products. The research team will discuss all information outlined in the informed consent document with
prospective participants to ensure that they understand the nature of the research and can voluntarily
decide whether or not to participate.
After screening, research personnel will meet with the participant and administer the informed consent
process. Dr. Merenstein will review, sign and date each consent form after the participant signs it.
11.3
Participant Confidentiality
Participant confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the investigators, their staff, and the sponsor(s) and
their agents. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological samples in addition to the
clinical information relating to participants. In accordance with the appropriate HIPAA regulations, all
information will be protected and kept confidential at all times. All hardcopy participant study records,
such as case report forms, will be kept in a locked cabinet inside a locked office. All contact and study
information will be kept on password-protected computers or online databases, participants will be
identified by code, and no information will be released without proper approvals or permissions.
The FDA, study monitor, or other authorized representatives of the sponsor may inspect all documents
and records required to be maintained by the investigators. The clinical study site will permit access to
such records.
11.4
Study Discontinuation
The study may be discontinued at any time by the IRB, the NCCIH, the OHRP, the FDA, or other
government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research participants are protected.
11.5   Ethical Standard
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with the principles set forth in
The Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research
of the US National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral
Research (April 18, 1979) and codified in 45 CFR Part 46 and the ICH E6 (R2); 83 FR 8882.

APPENDIX 2: Summary of BB-12 Safety Articles Using the Identical Strain
A) Langhendries, J.P., et al., Effect of a fermented infant formula containing viable bifidobacteria on the fecal flora 
composition and pH of healthy full-term infants. J Ped Gastro Nutr, 1995.
21
(2): p. 177-81. 
In a double-blind, randomized controlled three-armed study, 54 healthy infants were breast-fed, given a fermented 
infant formula containing BB-12, or fed a non-acidified formula during the first two months of life. Growth, tolerance, 
acceptability and fecal flora were assessed.
No adverse
events were reported.
The BB-12 formula was found
to 
be well-tolerated and promoted normal growth during the first two months of life, as compared to the breast-fed 
infant group.
B) Haschke, F., et al., Clinical trials prove the safety and efficacy of the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium Bb12 in 
follow-up formula and growing-up milks. Monatsschr Kinderheilkd (Suppl 1), 1998. 146: p. S26-S30. Double blind, 
randomized, controlled feeding studies with BB-12 in the U.S., China, and Thailand demonstrated normal growth of 
healthy children between 4 and 36 months of age and catch-up growth in malnourished children. Feeding the 
milk-based formula with BB-12 resulted in protection from rotavirus infection, fewer periods with hard bowel 
movements and a lower incidence of diaper rash.
No
adverse events were reported.
C) Saavedra, J.M., et al., Long-term consumption of infant formulas containing live probiotic bacteria: tolerance and 
safety. Am J Clin Nutr, 2004.
79
(2): p. 261-7. 
In a double-blind, randomized placebo controlled study, 118 healthy infants age 3-24 months consumed formula for 
210±127 days. Thirty-nine infants received a standard milk-based formula supplemented with a high dose of BB-12 
and TH-4, 39 infants received a low supplementation of BB-12 and TH-4 and 40 infants received an 
unsupplemented formula. The supplemented formulas were well accepted and were associated with a significantly 
lower frequency of reported colic or irritability (p<0.001) and a lower frequency of antibiotic use (p<0.001) than 
unsupplemented formula. Of the 5 infants who developed an intercurrent illness or complaint, 4 had vomiting and 
diarrhea (1 in the placebo group and 3 in the high dose group) and 1 (high dose group) had otitis media. Three 
infants ended their participation because of an effect perceived by their parents to be related to formula 
consumption. Of these three, one infant developed a rash (after consuming the formula for 30 days), but was 
diagnosed as being viral by the pediatrician. The second infant had loose stools and the third had loose stools and 
vomiting (both in the high dose group).
Results showed
no significant differences between groups in growth, 
health care attention seeking or other health variables, and therefore can be concluded that long-term 
consumption of BB-12 and TH-4 supplemented formulas are well tolerated and safe.
D) Bin-Nun, A., et al., Oral probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight neonates. J Pediatr, 
2005.
147
(2): p. 192-6. In this study, 145 neonates
of less than or equal to 1500g birth weight were given a daily 
feeding of a BB-02, BB-12 and TH-3 supplemented probiotic mixture or were given no feed supplements. Using 
Bell’s criteria, development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) was assessed. There were no differences in the 
incidence of any signs of feeding intolerance such as diarrhea, abdominal distension, or vomiting between the 
study and control groups. Three infants in the study group versus eight infants in the control group died (P=.218; 
RR 0.38; yielding a relative risk reduction of 62%; 95% CI: 0.38-1.38). The three deaths in the control group were 
attributed to NEC, whereas there were no NEC-associated deaths among the treated infants. There were no other 
significant differences in the characteristics of those who died between the two groups.
No other adverse
events 
were reported.

probiotic agents: a pilot study. J Am Coll Nutr, 2006.
25
(5): p. 415-9. Fifty-nine full-term infants aged
3-65 days were 
randomly assigned for 4 weeks to a standard milk-based formula supplemented with either BB-12, Lactobacillus 
reuteri (ATCC 55730) or a probiotics-free formula. The supplemented formulas were well accepted and did not 
reveal any adverse effects. A comparison of growth parameters, and variables of feeding, stooling, crying and 
irritability did not reveal any significant differences between groups. No adverse events were reported in any of the 
participants. Therefore, use of formula supplemented with either BB-12 or Lactobacillus reuteri in early infancy, was 
safe, well tolerated and did not adversely affect growth, stooling habits or infant behavior.

supplemented with probiotics Bifidobacterium bifidum and Streptococcus thermophilus or a formula without 
probiotics. Subjects were evaluated for diarrhea and rotavirus shedding for 4447 patient-days during 17 months. All 
infants maintained or improved their nutritional status throughout the study. There were no adverse effects judged 
to be associated with the feeding of either formulas, and adequate growth was recorded in all subjects. The 
probiotic formula was well tolerated by the infants, many of whom were initially malnourished or 
immunocompromised.

therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication. Aliment Pharmacol Ther, 2002.
16
(9): p. 1669-75. 
One hundred and sixty Helicobacter pylori-infected patients were randomized to receive either 1 week of triple 
therapy without supplements or triple therapy with Bifidobacterium BB-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 yogurt 
(AB-yogurt). In the triple-plus-yogurt group, AB-yogurt was continued for 4 weeks after completion of triple therapy. 
Common side-effects, such as vomiting, constipation, diarrhea and metallic taste, were significantly 
decreased in the triple-plus-yogurt group
, with 15
events reported in the triple-plus-yogurt group and 53 reported 
in the triple-only group. In summary, supplementation with AB-Yogurt can improve drug compliance and thus 
enhance the intention-to-treat eradication rate of H. pylori after triple therapy. Furthermore, continued 
supplementation with AB-Yogurt after triple therapy can restore Bifidobacterium in stools after 4 weeks.
H) Phuapradit, P., et al., Reduction of rotavirus infection in children receiving bifidobacteria- supplemented formula.

82 Suppl 1
: p. S43-8. One
hundred and seventy-five children aged 6-36 months were 
randomized to receive either a milk based follow-up formula, formula supplemented with BB-12 alone or formula 
supplemented with BB-12 and Streptococcus thermophilus for a period of 8 months. There were 81 episodes of 
diarrhea during the study period, most of which were caused by bacterial enteropathogens and only 3 were of 
rotavirus origin. The caregivers of the participants reported no adverse events.

Ten 
patients operated with ileal-pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis were given a fermented milk product 
containing live lactobacilli (La-5) and bifidobacteria (BB-12) daily for 4 weeks. The results suggested that probiotics 
primarily act superficially, with change of gross appearance of the mucosa at endoscopy, but without significant 
effect on histological picture, mucosal perfusion or faecal calprotectin, during a relatively short period of 4 weeks. 
No adverse effects were recorded.

53
(2): p. 241-5. In a double blind, randomised placebo
controlled study, 137 patients for elective laparotomy were 
enrolled 2 weeks prior to receive a combination of pre- and probiotics (synbiotic) Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, 
Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, together with the prebiotic 
oligofructose or a treatment of placebo capsules and sucrose powder. Seventy-two patients were in the synbiotic 
group and 65 patients in the placebo group.
There
were no differences in the incidence of septic morbidity 
between the placebo and synbiotic groups.
The most
common sites of infection were the urinary tract, 
respiratory tract and surgical wound.
K) Anderson, A.D., et al., Randomized clinical trial of multimodal optimization and standard perioperative surgical 
care. Br J Surg, 2003.
90
(12): p. 1497-504. Twenty-five
patients undergoing colonic resection were randomized into 
two groups receiving a ten-point optimization program or standard care. Optimized care included pre- and probiotic 
treatments for 7–14 days before surgery. The prebiotic used was oligofructose and the probiotic capsules contained 
Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12 and Streptococcus 
thermophilus. Five patients in the conventional group reported 6 instances of postoperative complications: urinary 
retention (one patient), atrial fibrillation (two), respiratory depression related to PCA (two) and ileus (one); compared 
to four patients reporting of 5 instances of complication in the optimization group: ineffective epidural (two patients), 
ileus (one), urinary tract infection (one) and wound infection (one).
No adverse events inconsistent with 
post-operative recovery were reported.
One patient
in the control group died from a perioperative myocardial 
infarction on the first postoperative day. In conclusion, optimization of surgical care significantly improved patients’ 
physical and psychological function in the early postoperative period and facilitated early hospital discharge.

critically ill patients: a randomised controlled trial. Clin Nutr, 2004.
23
(4): p. 467-75. 
The aim of this study was to determine whether the oral administration of a synbiotic preparation could alter gut 
barrier function in critically ill patients and thus reduce sepsis. Ninety patients admitted to an intensive care unit 
were randomised to either synbiotic or placebo preparations (45 into each group). The synbiotic preparation 
consisted of Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, Streptococcus thermophilus and 
Lactobacillus bulgaricus (probiotics), in dose of one capsule three times a day, with oligofructose (prebiotic), 
administered twice a day. The median duration of intake of study medication was 10 days in both groups. Fifty-nine 
patients developed one or more septic complications during the study; 33/45 (73%) in the synbiotic group and 
26/45 (58%) in the control group.
This did not represent
a statistically significant difference
(χ
2
2.41,
P=0.12). 
The mortality rate was similar in both groups; 49% (22/45) in the synbiotic group and 45% (20/45) in the control 
group (
χ

39
(12): p. 1228-35. Forty-one
patients with ulcerative colitis and ten patients with familial 
adenomatous polyposis operated with ileal-pouch-anal-anastomosis were given 500 ml of a fermented milk product 
(Cultura) containing BB-12 and LA-5 daily for 4 weeks. The aim of the study was to determine, in conjunction with 
an earlier study, if mucosal perfusion in the distal part of the ileal pouch is reduced in patients on probiotic 
intervention. All patients completed the treatment period and reported intake of Cultura according to the study 
protocol
with no report of adverse effects.

(1): p. 43-51. In a
previous double-blind, randomized, controlled study, clinical 
improvement of symptoms was demonstrated in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) operated on with 
ileal-pouch-anal-anastomosis (IPAA), during intervention with live probiotic microbes Lactobacilli and 
Bifidobacteriae. The aim of the present study was to confirm the previous results in a larger population, including 
clinical symptoms, fecal flora and endoscopic evaluation, and to compare the results in UC/IPAA patients with those 
of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) with IPAA and UC patients with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA). 
Five hundred millilitres of a fermented milk product (Cultura) containing live lactobacilli (La-5) and bifidobacteriae 
(BB-12) was given daily for 4 weeks to 51 UC patients and 10 patients with FAP, operated on with IPAA, and six UC 
patients operated on for IRA.
No adverse events related
to consumption of product were reported.

Thirty-nine patients undergoing major elective colonic 
resection were randomized to receive a ten-point multimodal optimization package or conventional perioperative 
care. The optimized program included the supplementation of Trevis (
Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Lactobacillus 
bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12 and Streptococcus thermophilus)
daily 7-14 days before surgery. 
Twenty-four patients developed complications, nine in the optimized group and 15 in the control group, and five 
patients required readmission within 30 days of surgery (one and four, respectively). There was one death, which 
occurred after a perioperative myocardial infarct in a patient randomized to multimodal optimization.
There were no 
differences in morbidity and mortality between the optimization and conventional group.

(5): p. 
395-401. In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial, 29 patients with collagenous colitis and diarrhea 
were divided into two groups; 21 patients consumed Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis 
subsp. lactis BB-12 capsules (AB-Cap-10) and 8 patients consumed a placebo for 12 weeks. The overall tolerance 
of AB-Cap-10 and placebo was good, with only minor adverse events.
In no case were side effects the
cause of 
withdrawal from study.
Only the gastrointestinal symptoms
were considered possibly related to AB-Cap-10. In the 
probiotic group, worsening of diarrhea (n=1), abdominal pain and constipation (n=2), stomach burn (n=1), nausea 
(n=1), and flatulence (n=1) were reported. In the placebo group, 4 patients complained of nausea.

because probiotics were isolated from the feces more often in the treated infants than the control infants. Parents 
were asked to document whether their infants showed any symptoms as a result of the study formula.
The
study 
formula with or without the probiotic supplementation was well tolerated. They did not note any difference 
between the groups.

product every day. The product had > 10 e 8 cfu / ml of LGG and BB-12 and > 10 e 7 cfu/ ml of La-5.
The probiotic 
reduced the number of days with gastrointestinal symptoms (1.7 days for the probiotic product compared 
to 3.0 days for the placebo, i.e. 43% lower mean of the probiotic product, p=0.02) No significant difference 
between treatments was seen with respect to respiratory symptoms.

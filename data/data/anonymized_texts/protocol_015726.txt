  Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of once daily (QD) 75 mg and 225 mg doses of 
CRV431 in presumed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)  fibrosis stage 2 (F2)/fibrosis 
stage 3 (F3) subjects compared to placebo control over 28 days of dosing;  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a QD dose of CRV431, its major metabolites 
and fra ction unbound in presumed NASH F2/F3 subjects over 28 days of dosing.  
Secondary: 
• To evaluate non- invasively the antifibrotic activity of a QD dose  of CRV431, as 
measured by quantification of selected biomarkers of fibrosis, in presumed NASH F2/F3 
subjects  over 28 days of dosing.  
Exploratory Objectives:  
• To generate exploratory data regarding the antifibrotic activity of a QD dose of CRV431 
over 28 days of dosing by performing hepatic evaluations via laboratory assessments of biomarkers such:  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
− Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analyses to assess concentration effect relationship on all biomarkers;  
− Alanin e aminotransferase (ALT) and /or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) decrease 
from baseline.  
Number of subjects (planned): Thirty -six (36) adult male or female subjects will be enrolled.  
• Cohort A:   Twelve (12) presumed NASH F2/F3 subjects on CRV431 75 mg QD;  
• Cohort B:  Six (6) presumed NASH F2/F3 subjects on  matching  placebo  for Cohort A . 
• Cohort C:   Twelve (12) presumed NASH F2/F3 subjects on CRV431 225 mg QD;  
• Cohort D:  Six (6) presumed NASH F2/F3 subjects on matching placebo  for Cohort C .

  Methodology:  
This is a randomized, single -blind, placebo -controlled, multi- center study to evaluate the safety and 
PK of CRV431 in subjects with presumed NASH F2/F3 fibrosis. Antifibrotic biomarker activity will 
be evaluated on an exploratory basis.

This study consists of 3 phases: (i) Screening and Randomization; (ii) treatment; and (iii) follow up. 
During Screening, each subject will provide informed consent prior to starting any study specific 
procedures. The randomization of subjects in each cohort will be performed in a 2:1 ratio (12 CRV431 subjects and 6 placebo subjects). During the treatment period, randomized subjects will be 
provided the t reatment and assessments according to  Schedule of Events,  
Table 3 . In the follow up 
phase, investigational product (IP) will be discontinued followed by 14 Days of safety follow -up. 
Subjects randomized into either Cohort A or Cohort B will receive a 75 mg QD  dose of CRV431 or 
matching placebo in a fasted state, respectively . Subjects randomized into either Cohort C or Cohort 
D will receive a 225 mg QD dose of CRV431 or matching placebo in a fasted state, respectively.   
 
Safety and available PK data will be reviewed by a DSMB prior to proceeding with the next higher 
dose cohort.  The DSMB will also conduct a safety review if stopping criteria are met.  
 
Subjects who do not complete the study may be replaced within the dosing cohort, unless a stopping 
rule (see Section  7.5) precludes replacement .  
 
Subjects who miss more than 2 consecutive QD doses of CRV431 may be replaced, unless a stopping 
rule (Section  7.5) precludes replacement.

  5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Background 
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its more severe form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH) are significant health burdens and are on the rise across  the globe. Nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease is characterized by fat accumulation in the liver and often is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus,  dyslipidemia, hypertension, and other aspects of metabolic 
syndrome. N onalcoholic steatohepatitis shares these characteristics but additionally is 
characterized by liver inflammation , hepatocyte necrosis  and potentially  fibrosis, which places 
patients at increased  risk of developing cirrhosis and liver cancer.   
The prevalence of NAFLD, NASH and HCC are on the rise throughout the world. In a recent 
study published by Estes et al. ( Estes, 2018), NAFLD cases in the USA are projected to increase 
from 83.1 million in 2015 to 100.9 million in 2030. This equates to a 33.5% prevalence among 
adults over the age of 15. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis cases in the U SA are projected to rise 
from 16.5 million in 2015 to 27 million in 2030.  In addition, the incidence of HCC is projected to increase by 137% from 2015 to 2030 leading to an incr ease in liver related deaths.  From 2015 
to 2030, the estimate of nearly 800,000 excess liver deaths are expected.  From a global 
perspective, NAFLD prevalence is 25.4% with the highest rates in the Middle East and South America.  This correlates with a 40.76% rate of NASH and/or fibrosis  progression.  The HCC 
incidence was 0.44 per 1,000 person years in NAFLD patients.  Liver associated mortality had a 
higher risk ratio 1.94 compared to overall mortality 1.05 in a NAFLD patient population 
(Siddiqui, 2018).   When looking at the  USA, it is reported the NAFLD rates to be between 10 
and 30%.  These rates also apply to Europe and Asia ( Younossi, 2016).  
There are currently no USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  approved medications 
specifically for NAFLD or N ASH, but many drug candidates are in development.  
Many pathological processes contribute to NASH, including the toxic effects of fat 
accumulation, oxidative stress, cell injury and cell death, leukocyte recruitment and activation of 
infiltrating cells and resident macrophages, profibrogenic activation of hepatic stellate cells, 
fibrosis, and carcinogenic transformation of liver cells.  Effective therapies for NASH likely will 
require targeting multiple pathogenic mechanisms.  Targeting late -disease processes, especially 
those related to fibrosis, is especially important.  Most patients with NAFLD and early NASH 
are asymptomatic and therefore it is expected that they will already have moderately advanced NASH by the time that they are diagnosed.  Also, fibrosis is the strongest predictor of adverse 
clinical outcomes associated with NASH  such as progression to cirrhosis and HCC .  Whereas 
therapies targeting dyslipidemia, inflammation, and other triggers of NASH will be important for halting disease progression,  it is vitally important to develop treatments that more directly inhibit 
fibrogenesis, stimulate fibrolysis, promote restoration of liver function, reduce the risks of 
carcinogenesis, and restrict tumor progression.  CRV431 is a drug candidate that is proposed to 
directly target many of these pathological events.  
5.2. Rationale  
CRV431 is a chemically modified analog of the immunosuppressive drug, cyclosporine A (CsA). 
Cyclosporine A exerts its immunosuppression by a two- step process. C yclosporine A first binds 
Protocol HEPA -CRV431 -201  Hepion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 5.0 
01 March 2021 Confidential   Page 20 of 64 
  to cyclophilin A  (Cyp A), a peptidylprolyl isomerase that regulates target protein structure and 
function by influencing the cis -trans conformation of proline peptide bonds.   Then the CsA -Cyp 
A duplex binds to and inhibits the activity of the phosphatase, calcineurin, in lymphocytes.   
CRV431 is chemically and functionally different from CsA in that it retains binding to Cyp A , 
but the CRV431- cyclophilin duplex does not strongly bind to calcineurin and therefore does not 
have significant immunosuppressive potential.  
CRV431 binding and inhibition of Cyp A is 13 -times more potent than that of CsA with an 
inhibitor constant, Ki = 1 nM, and it is this high- affinity, cyclophilin inhibition that is proposed 
to mediate therapeutic effects of CRV431. Moreover, CRV431 inhibits not only Cyp A but also 
other cyclophilin isoforms, notably cyclophilin B  (Cyp B)  and cyclophilin D (Cyp D), which 
contribute to a variety of pathological processes ( Nigro  et al., 2013; Naoumov, 2014; Bukrinsky, 
2015; Dawar et al., 2017a, b; Briston et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Xue et al., 2018). For example, Cyp A is an abundant cytosolic cyclophilin that influences many intracellular signaling 
pathways.  It is released from injured cells and stimulates inflammation by binding to CD147 and 
contributes to cancer cell adaptation to hypoxia and is recruited into the life cycles of many 
viruses, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV).  Cyclophilin B is located 
in the endoplasmic reticulum where it participates in protein fo lding and secretion of proteins. 
Notably, Cyp B regulates  procollagen hydroxylation, formation of procollagen triple -helices , and 
rates of secretion of procollagen from cells .  Impairment  of Cyp B -regulated  procollagen 
production is hypothesized to be the major mechanism by which CRV431 decreases liver 
fibrosis.   Cyp D is located in the mitochondrial matrix and is the primary regulator of 
mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTP).  These mitochondrial pores open in 
response to common types of cellular injury, such as oxidative stress and calcium overload, 
leading to mitochondrial destruction and cell necrosis.  Inhibition of Cyp D protects cells from a 
variety of insults and may be important for reducing cell loss and ensuing pathological cas cades 
in NASH livers. Cyclophilin D also is implicated in liver steatosis and in oncogenic events 
related to the tumor suppressor, p53, to which Cyp D binds. In summary, several cyclophilin-
dependent pathological processes in NASH livers are likely to be attenuated by CRV431.   For 
information on mechanism of action and additional preclinical data, please refer to the CRV431 
Investigational Brochure.   
5.3. Rationale for this Stu dy Design and Dose Selection  
CRV431 has consistently demonstrated the ability to prevent the progression of liver fibrosis in a 
variety of animal models and in precision- cut human liver slices.  The primary mechanism of 
action to prevent collagen synthesis is via Cyp B inhibition although a dditional mechanisms may 
involve Cyp A and Cyp D.  The half maximal inhibitory concentration  (IC50 ) for cyclophilin 
inhibition range s from 3.2 to 9.5 ng/mL.  Human whole blood concentrations after a single dose 
75 mg of CRV431 achieved a maximum observed whole blood concentration (Cmax) of 334 ± 
106 ng/mL.  Steady state concentrations for 75 mg QD dosed for 28 days achieved a C max of 
1397.5 ± 97.8 ng/mL with a mean trough level of 889.5 ± 70.4 ng/mL demonst rating that whole 
blood concentrations are above  the cellular IC50 range for the entire dosing period which ensures 
target engagement.  In order to evaluate the potential dose response of CRV431 on safety and 
NASH biomarkers , a second dose of  225 mg QD demonstrat ing a steady -state Cmax of 1844 ±  
321.9 ng/mL  will be explored.

  7. INVESTIGATIONAL P LAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a randomized, single -blind, placebo-controlled, QD dose study of CR V431 in presumed 
NASH F2 /F3 subjects. This study will consist of 3 phases: (i) Screening and Randomization; (ii) 
treatment; and (iii) follow up .  
7.1.1.  Screening and Randomization Period  
Screening visits will be conducted within 30 days prior to study Day 1. During the Screening  
Phase , each potential subject will provide informed consent prior to starting any study- specifi c 
procedures.  
Due to the logistics and time needed for the retest of the , for those subjects 
that an investigator request s a retest  of these samples , as described in Section  8.2, the screening 
period  may be extended an additional 30 days for a screening period of up to 60 days total in 
order to allow subjects who are waiting the retest results the opportunity to meet all study entry 
criteria.  
Once a subject is considered eligible, prior to Day 1, a concomitant medication form will be 
completed by the site and sent to the sponsor for approval. See Section  7.4.1  for prohibited 
medications . 
Subjec ts who are eligible will be randomized as described in  Section  7.3.3  and as shown in Table  2.

Potential study subjects who me et all inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study, but who, for 
personal or administrative reasons, are not included in the study may be re -screened if more than 
30 days has passed since their previous screening. For these subjects, use of  results 
previously obtained for this study will be extended for an additional 30 days up to a total of 60 
days. There are no restrictions on the number of re -screens permitted.  
Potential study subjects who previously screened and failed only  but met all 
other inclusion criteria and met none of the exclusion criteria for this study may be re -screened.

  7.1.2.  Treatment Period  
Subjects will receive treatment  with CRV431  or matching placebo from Day 1  to Day 28 . Study 
visit days that include treatment administration occur on Days 1, 2, 7, 14, and 28. Visit windows 
will be allowed and are as follows: Day 7 and Day 14, the visit window is ± 1 day  and Day 28 the 
visit window is + 2 days .  If the study visit  for Day 28 is extended , the subject must continue taking 
study drug until the visit is complete d. 
Whole blood samples will be collected pre -dose and through Day 42 or early termination for 
safety and PK assessments  as shown in Table 3  and Table 6 , respectively . AEs will be collected 
as described in Section  11.4. 
7.1.3.  Follow Up Period  
After completion of the treatment period, the subjects will be monitored for additional 14 days.  
A visit window of ±2 days will be allowed for the Day42/EOS visit . 
Subjects who do not complete the study may be replaced within a dosing cohort, unless  a 
stopping rule precludes replacement.  Safety criteria for dose adjustments or stopping rul es are 
provided in Section 7.5. 
The overall study design of all scheduled procedures is shown in Table 3 .

a If an Early Termination visit and a scheduled visi t coincide, procedures for both visits should be completed without duplication.  
b Subjects must provide written informed consent prior to initiating any study procedures. To participate in this study, subjects must consent to all procedures 
outlined in Table  3,  
c All females of childbearing potential will have a serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test or urine dipstick pregnancy test at Screening, and 
urine dipstick pregnancy tests at all oth er indicated visits.  
d Blood pressure will be measured with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer or an automated oscillometric blood pressure monitor after the subject has been 
resting in a supine position for at least 5 minutes.  Heart rate will be measured by an automated vital signs machine.  Respiratory rate will be measured only if 
medically ind icated.  
e Twelve -lead ECGs should be performed after the subject has been supine for 5 minutes and should be scheduled 1½ to 3 hours after the  morning dose. On Day 
1 and Day 28, ECGs will be performed prior to the 2 hr. PK draw. ECGs performed on non -dosing Days should be completed within the same time window as 
the ECGs that were done 1½ to 3 hours after the time the morning doses were administered.  The timing of the ECG may be adjus ted to C max as new data 
becomes available.  
f HbA1c will be checked at Screening, D28, EOS and ET only.  
g Subjects in all cohorts will have blood PK and fraction unbound samples collected at the time points indicated in Table  6. 
h PK not performed  if ET visit occurs after Day 28.

  7.2. Number of Subjects  
A total of 36 adult male or female subjects  with presumed NASH F2/ F3 will be enrolled. Of the 
36 subjects, 12 subject s will be enrolled in Cohort A  to receive 75mg of CRV431 , 6 subjects will 
be enrolled  in Cohort B to receive the matching placebo  of Cohort A , 12 subjects will be enrolled 
in Cohort C to receive 225mg of CRV431 and 6 subject s will be enrolled in Cohort D to receive 
the matching placebo of Cohort C . 
7.3. Treatment  
Subjects in Cohort A will receive CRV431 75 mg (1 x 75 mg softgel  capsule) QD and subjects in 
Cohort B will receive  the matching placebo  (1 x placebo softgel capsule)  for Cohort A . 
Subjects in Cohort C will receive CRV431 225 mg (3 x 75 mg softgel capsules) QD and subjects 
in Cohort D will receive  the matching placebo  (3 x placebo softgel capsules)  for Cohort C . 
7.3.1.  Treatment Administration  
Subjects will take study drug on the morning of each dosing day, with approximately  240 mL of 
water. On Day 1  and Day 28 , subjects will fast overnight for at least 8 hours, will take CRV431 
or matching placebo and will fast for an additional 2 hours after treatment administration . On 
subsequent days, subject will fast overnight for at least 8 hours, will take CRV431 or matching 
placebo and will fast for an additional 30 minutes after treatment administration .  On visit days, 
the exact time of dosing will be decided based on logistics and will be documented in the source 
documents. 
7.3.2.  Treatment Compliance 
While in the Clinical Research Unit, study treatment will be administered under the supervision 
of site personnel. Compliance during the non- study visit days will be assessed by subject 
reporting and pill count. Study personnel should counsel subjects on study medication 
compliance during each study visit. A qualified designee will be responsible for monitoring the 
administration of the timed oral doses on study visit days.  
7.3.3.  Randomization and Blinding  
Upon determination that a subject meets all eligibility criteria, the subject will be randomized on 
Study Day -1 to receive either CRV431 or  matching  placebo in a 2 :1 subject ratio ( 12 CRV431  
75mg to 6 matching  placebo  and 12 CRV431 225mg to 6 matching placebo) in accordance with 
a computer -generated randomization schedule generated by a non- study statistician.  Using this 
randomization schedule, pharmacy staff or designee will assign treatment sequentially to each 
eligible subject within a given cohort.     
This is a single blind study where the investigator and sponsor are unblinded.  However, the 
subject is blinded and will not know if he or she will receive CRV431 or matching placebo.

  7.4. Study Restriction  
7.4.1.  Prohibited and Concomitant Medication  
Any prescription medication or over the counter medication taken from 30 days prior to the time 
of consent to the End of Study/Early Termination Visi t will be recorded in the subject’s medical 
record (source document) and Case Report F orm ( CRF ).  
Once a subject is considered eligible, prior to Day 1, a concomitant medication form will be 
completed by the site and reviewed by the sponsor for approval.  
Use of the following medication  prior to and during the study is prohibited: 
• Any drugs or substances known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 and 
drugs whose major elimination pathway is via the BSEP or OAT3 transporters, and 
drugs that are majo r substrates of the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and 
OATP1B3 received within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug. ( NOTE: 
Please refer to Appendix A  and if there are questions, please contact the sponsor);  
• Systemic immunosuppressants, with the exception of short -term treatment for asthma, 
received within 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug and during the study;  
• Any investigational product or investigational device received within 30 days prior to 
the first dose of study drug and during the study.  
For questions regarding the use of medications, the investigator should contact the sponsor for 
further discussion.  In case of an acu te medical emergency, discussion with the Sponsor is 
excluded and the subject should be treated according to the judgement of the PI.  
 
Consumption of foods and beverages containing the following substances will be prohibited as 
indicated:  
• Xanthines/caffein e:  24 hours prior to dosing and throughout the period of PK sample 
collection; 
• Alcohol:  48 hours prior to dosing and throughout the period of PK sample collection;  
• Grapefruit/Seville orange:  14 days prior to dosing and throughout the period of PK 
sample  collection.  
7.4.2.  Meals  
On Day 1 and Day 28, subjects will fast overnight for at least 8 hours, will take CRV431 or 
matching placeb o and will fast for an additional 2 hours after administration of study drugs.  On 
subsequent days, subject will fast overnight for at least 8 hours, will take CRV431 or matching 
placebo and will fast for an additional 30 minutes after administration of study drugs. 
7.5. COVID -19 Vaccine  
Hepion in no way wishes to preclude subjects  from re ceiving the COVID -19 vaccine. However, 
in order to minimize potential adverse events associated with the vaccine, if possible , the subject 
should try to receive their second dose of the vaccine seven days prior to the commencement of 
receiving study drug ( Day 1) or receive their first dose of the vaccine 96 hours after their last 
dose on Day 28.  
Protocol HEPA -CRV431 -201  Hepion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 5.0 
01 March 2021 Confidential   Page 32 of 64 
  Enrolled study subjects who have an opportunity to be vaccinated against COVID -19 should do 
so. Study subjects will be permitted to continue on the study if they r eceive the COVID -19 
vaccine.  
The COVID- 19 vaccine should be recorded in  the subject’s Concomitant Medications CRF page 
if the subject  receives the vaccine after consent and through Day 42/EOS.   
7.6. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSM B) will monitor  the trial .  The DSM B will 
comprise of medical professionals with expertise in NASH  and clinical trials and are external to 
the Sponsor.  The DSMB will meet periodically or as needed to review accumulating safety  data 
and any available PK data collected  throughout the trial.  
Safety and available PK data will be reviewed by the DSMB prior to proceeding with the next 
higher dose cohort. The DSMB  will review safet y data when at least six (6) subjects in Cohort A 
(CRV431 75 mg) and at least three (3) subjects in Cohort B (matching placebo) have reached 28 
days of dosing, as described in Section  12.3.1 . The DSMB  will also review  the Day 28 safety 
data from the remaining  subjects to confirm there are no changes to the prior safety assessment.   
The roles and responsibilities will be further defined in a Charter.  
7.7. Safety Criteria for Adjustment or Stopping Doses  
7.7.1.  Individual Subject Criteria  
If any of the criteria below are met by an individual subject, then no further dosing will occur  at 
any of the  study sites until a review of all available safety information is performed by the 
DSMB,  Medical Monitor, and Sponsor.   Appropriate Regulatory Agencies and Ethics 
Committees will be informed as applicable. If it is later determined that further dosing can be 
performed safely then an application for a substantial protocol amendment will be submitted to the appropriate Regulatory Agencies and Ethics Committees, if applicable. Stopping criteria for 
an individual subject  includes: 
• Grade 3 or higher CTCAE AEs possibly or probably related to study drug  as 
determined by the investigator and sponsor; 
• Grade 4  CTCAE  AEs regardless of relation to study drug as determined by the 
investigator and sponsor; 
• Any SAE s thought to be related to the study drug as determined by the investigator 
and sponsor.  
For s ubjects experiencing any hepatic AE s or SAE s judged by the investigator or sponsor to be 
related to study drug, the investigator , DSMB, Medical Monitor  and S ponsor will review all 
available safety data and make a determination to proceed with one of the following options : 
• If the event was a drug-induced liver injury ( DILI ), considered  as increases in  
aminotransferases (AT) >3 x ULN or >3 x baseline where baseline is defined as the 
average values of Screening and Day -1, no additional subjects will be dosed until it 
is determined  that it is safe to proceed and in addition the frequency of blood 
chemistries will increase to daily, if appropriate.

  − Repeat testing of ALT, AST, ALP, TB L will be performed within 48- 72 hours to 
confirm the abnormality.  
− If there are persistent elevations  of AT  > 3 x ULN or a 2 -fold increase above 
baseline values (for those subjects with elevated values prior to drug exposure) 
upon repeat testing then close observation visits should be implemented and/or discontinuation of drug should be considered.  Close  Observations are described in 
Section  7.8. 
• If the event was not a DILI, as defined above, one of the following actions will be 
taken:  
− Dose an entire additional cohort at the same or lower dose than the dose taken by 
the subject that experienced the event in question;  
− Continue to pause the study, until it is determined, that it is safe to proceed.  
A decision to discontinue or temporarily interrupt the study drug for a subject will be  considered 
based on following criteria:  
• If ALT/AST baseline measurements (BLM) are <2 x ULN, discontinue if ALT or 
AST increases to >5  x BLM ; 
• If ALT/AST BLM ≥2 x ULN but <5  x ULN, discontinue if ALT or AST increases to 
3 x BLM ; 
• If ALT/AST BLM ≥5 x ULN, discontinue if ALT or AST increases to >2 x BLM 
AND the increase is accompanied by a concomitant increase in TBL  to >2  x BLM 
OR the International Normalized Ratio ( INR) concomitantly increases by >0.2; 
• Any subjects with signs and symptoms of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, and/or rash, accompanied by a >5% increase in  
eosinophils; 
• Subjects who miss more than 2 consecutive QD doses of study drug. Subjects may be replaced unless a stopping rule precludes replacement.  
7.7.2.  Study  Criteria  
Dosing of study drug within the study will be stopped and recruitment into the study will be 
paused unt il a review of all available safety information is performed by the DSMB, Medical 
Monitor, and Sponsor if any of the following occur:  
• ≥3 subjects in the study experience an SAE that is judged to be related to study drug 
by the investigator and sponsor; 
• ≥3 subjects in the study experience a Grade 3 or Grade 4 CTCAE AE in the same 
system organ class (SOC) that are judged to be related to study drug by the investigator and sponsor;

  − QTcF interval change from baseline ≥60 msec that has an absolute value 
≥ 480 msec ; 
 The value of an individual ECG time point is the average of the triplicate 
values  
 “confirmed” is defined as the abnormality duplicated, at least 1 hour after 
the abnormality is first noted, by the results of a set of 3 ECGs performed 
in triplicate , at least 5, but not more than 10 minutes between each 
assessment . 
• ≥1 subject with AT >3 x ULN or   >3 x subject baseline that is  confirmed, not 
initially cholestatic, and judged to be adversely related to study drug (DILI) by the investigator and sponsor. 
7.7.2.1.  Study Stopping Criteria  
Study will be stopped and a review of all available safety information is performed by the 
DSMB, Medical Monitor, and Sponsor  if any of the below criteria is met:  
• ≥1 subject develops a Grade 5 CTCAE adverse event attributed to CRV431 
• ≥2 subjects develop a Grade 4 CTCAE advers e event attributed to CRV431 
• ≥3 subjects develop the same Grade 3 CTCAE adverse event attributed to CRV431 
 
The study may be restarted depending on the specific AE , relationship to the study drug and with 
the agreement of the DSMB, Medical Monitor and Sponsor.  
7.7.3.  Pharmacokinetic Criteria for Dose Adjustment  
Dose adjustment is not available for subjects  in Cohort A receiving 75 mg of CV431 QD. If a 
patient demonstrates adverse events that trigger the need for stopping, that patie nt will be 
stopped and a n additional patient will be started on the same dose unless the study data indicate s 
a problem with the dose level as recommended by the DSMB. Subjects  in Cohort C, receiving 
225 mg of CRV 431 QD, experiencing a drug exposure relate d Grade 3,4 or 5 CTCAE can have a 
dosage reduction to 150 mg of CRV431 once daily.  
7.8. Close Observatio n 
Upon detection and confirmation of early signs of possible DILI (see Section  7.7.1 ), close 
observation should be initiated immediately .   
Close observation will include the following:  
• Repeating liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests 2 or 3- times weekly. The frequency 
of ret esting can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize or the trial 
drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic;  
• Obtaining a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases;  
• Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use including non- prescription medications 
and herbal and dietary supplement preparations, alcohol use, recreational drug use, 
and special diets;

  • Ruling out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E, autoimmune or alcoholic 
hepatitis, hypoxic/is chemic hepatopathy, and biliary tract disease;  
• Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents;  
• Obtaining additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct 
bilirubin ); 
• Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations; 
• Consider liver biopsy.  
7.9. Criteria for Study Termination  
Conditions may arise during the study that could prompt the study to be halted.  Conditions that may prompt such considerations include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• The discovery of unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to subjects enrolled in the 
study; 
• A decision on the part of the sponsor or regulatory authority to suspend, discontinue, or 
shorten the study 
• Study conduct at a study site may warrant termination under conditions that include the 
following:  
− Failure of the site to enroll eligible subjects into the study; 
− Failure of the investigator to comply with FDA, country- specific, or local 
regulations;  
− Submission of false information from the research facility to the sponsor, the 
clinical Monitor, or a regulatory authority;

medical evaluation.  
Potential study subject s who met all inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study but who, for 
personal or administrative reasons, were not included in a study cohort may be re -screened if 
more than 30 days ha ve passed since their previous screening . For these subjects, use o f ELF or 
Pro-C3 results previously obtained for this study will be extended for an additional 30 days up to 
a total of 60 days . There are no restrictions on the number of re -screens permitted for these 
subjects . 
Potential study subjects who previously screened and failed only ELF or only P ro-C3 but met all 
other inclusion criteria and met none of the exclusion criteria for this study may be re -screened.  
8.3. Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
8.3.1.  Early Termination of Subjects from the Study  
Subjects who discontinue the study should complete all scheduled safety assessments at the 
Early Termination Visit. If an Early Termination Visit and a scheduled visit coincide, procedures 
for both visits should be completed, without duplication.  Subjects must discontinue  the study for 
the following reasons:  
• Subject withdraws consent ; 
• Subject unwilling or unable to follow study procedures, per judgment of the 
investigator; 
• Investigator , sponsor, or Regulatory Authority judge that further dosing with study 
drug would be  harmful to the subject ;

related to study drug; 
• Subject experiences a Grade 3 CTCAE AE judged, by the investigator and the 
sponsor, to be related to study drug;  
• Subject experiences a Grade 4 CTCAE AE judged, by the investigator a nd the 
sponsor, regardless of the relation  to study drug;  
• Subject experiences a Grade 3 or Grade 4 CTCAE laboratory abnormality judged by 
the investigator and the sponsor, to be related t o study drug except for asymptomatic 
elevations in cholesterol or triglycerides which are accepted ;

cholestatic ALT >3 x ULN and bilirubin >2  x ULN OR subjects with elevated ALT at 
baseline who experiences confirmed, non- cholestatic ALT >10 x baseline value and 
bilirubin >2 x ULN ; 
• Subject experiences a confirmed,  
− QTcF interval 500 msec ;  
OR 
− QTcF interval change from baseline ≥60 msec that has an absolute value 
≥480 msec . The value of an individual ECG time point is the a verage of the 
triplicate values

abnormality is first noted, by the results of a set of 3 ECGs performed in 
triplicate , at least 5, but not more than 10 minutes between each assessment ; 
• Subject experiences any hepatic AE or SAE judged by the investigator or sponsor as 
DILI and to be related to study drug and not to the subject’s underl ying NASH. 
Subjects who discontinue the study due to the safety stopping criteria will be replaced if the 
investigator and s ponsor agree and the criteria outlined in Section  7.5 are not violated.  Subjects 
who discontinue the study for non- safety reasons may be replaced . 
If a subject is withdrawn from the study the reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented in the subject’s medical record and CRF.  A n Early Termination Visit should be performed.  All 
subjects must be followed for safety until the time of the follow -up evaluation or until study drug 
related toxicities resolve, return to baseline or are deemed irreversible, whichever is longer.  
Subjects who cannot be reached after  3 documented attempts to be contacted to schedule a 
follow- up visit will be considered lost to follow up.  
8.4. Subject Replacement  
Subjects who do not complete the study may be replaced, at the sponsor’s discretion  to ensure 
that the  study is fully populated, unless a stopping rule precludes replacement. Replacement  
subjects will receive the same treatment assignment as the subject they are replacing . Each 
enrolled subject  may only participate in this study once.  The study is designed to have 12 
subjects on active treatment and 6 subjects on placebo  to complete the study.   
 
Protocol HEPA -CRV431 -201  Hepion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

  11. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
11.1. Safety Parameters  
11.1.1.  Demographic 
Demo graphic details  will be collected at Screening only. 
11.1.2.  Vital Signs  
Vital sign assessments will comprise of blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and respiratory 
rate measurements.  Blood pressure will be measured with a standard mercury  
sphygmomanometer or an automated oscillometric blood pressure monitor, after the subject has 
been resting in a supine position for at least 5 minutes.  Heart rate will be measured by an 
automated vital signs machine. Respiratory rate will be measured only if medically indicated.  
Vital signs will be performed for all subjects at the time points indicated in  Table 3 , or as 
applicable.  
11.1.3.  Weight and Height  
Weight and height will be assessed at the Screening  visit only. 
11.1.4.  Physical Examination  and Medical History  
Physical examinations will be performed at Screening. Additional examinations may be performed throughout the study, if considered medically necessary.  The examinations will 
include the following body systems: general appearance; eyes, ears, nose, and throat; head and neck; chest and lungs; cardiovascular; abdomen; musculoskeletal; lymphatic; dermatologic; 
neurologic; psychiatric; and extremities.  
A det ailed medical history will be collected at the Screening  visit only. 
11.1.5.  Electrocardiogram  
Twelve- lead ECGs will be performed after the subject has been supine for 5 minutes, and 1½ to 
3 hours after the morning dose.  On Day 1 and Day  28, ECG s will be perform ed prior to the 2  hr. 
PK draw.  Electrocardiograms performed on non-dosing D ays should be completed within the 
same time window as the ECGs that were done 1½ to 3 hours after the time the morning doses 
were administered.  These ECG schedules will therefore be close to the time of day the previous 
post- dose ECGs were obtained.  The timing of the ECG may be adjusted to C
max values as new 
data becomes available.  All ECGs should be interpreted by the investigator or qualified designee 
within 12 hours of the time the ECGs were performed.  Electrocardiograms will be performed for 
all subjects at the time points indicated in  Table 3 , or as applicable.  
11.1.6.  Laboratory Assessments  
All samples should be collected and shipped as directed in the Laboratory Procedures Manual.

  Routine clinical laboratory testing will be performed for all subjects at the time points indicated 
in Table 3 , or as applicable.  Samples may be stored up to 20 years.  
If the  investigator believes that access to laboratory data is medically indicated and that a delay 
in access to central laboratory safety results would pose a potential safety risk to the subject, the 
sample will be split; a portion will be sent to the local la boratory for appropriate laboratory tests, 
and the other portion will be sent to the central laboratory for routinely scheduled testing.  
Samples will be collected and stored for testing for additional safety or PK testing as necessary.   
11.1.6.1.  Hematology and Co agulation

least 24 consecutive months (i.e., who have had menses within the preceding 24 months ), or 
women who have not undergone surgical sterilization; specifically, hystere ctomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, hysteroscopic sterilization, and/or tubal ligation, must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening , within  the 24 hour period prior to Day 1 and at  all 
other time points indicated in  Table 3 , or as applicable. A t Screening a serum beta human 
chorionic gonadotropin  or urine dipstick pregnancy test will be performed. A urine dipstick 
pregnancy test will be performed at all other time points . 
All post -menopausal females will have an FSH test at Screening.  
11.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
11.2.1.  Adverse Event s 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical st udy subject associated with 
the use of a drug (investigational or non- investigational) in humans, whether or not considered 
drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
Protocol HEPA -CRV431 -201  Hepion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 5.0 
01 March 2021 Confidential   Page 49 of 64 
  finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any 
judgement on causality.  An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in 
combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, 
including overdose.  
All AEs that occur after any subject has been consented, before treatment, during treatment, or 
up to and including the End of Study or Early Termination Visit, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on forms provided by Hepion.  
11.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event s  
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it fulfills at least one of the following:  
• Results in death;  
• It is immediately life -threatening; 
• It requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; 
• It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect;  
• It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject  or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
All SAEs that occur after any subject has been consented, before treatment, during treatment, or up to and including the End of Study or Early Termination Visit, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on forms provided by Hepion.  
11.2.3.  Other Adverse Event s  
Other AEs will be identified by the investigator and if applicable also by the medical monitor 
during the evaluation of safety data for the Clinical Study Report.  Adverse events of special 
interest , other than SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation of the subject from the study, will be 
classified as other AEs.  For each of these other AEs , a narrative may be written and included in 
the Clinical Study Report.  
11.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
An investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the 
investigational product, when appropriate, for each AE (unrelated, possibly related or probably 
related).  The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product.  If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “unrelated.”  If there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause  and effect 
relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE 
should be considered “related.”  
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be “possible” or “probable” the event will be considered to be related to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.

  11.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events  spontaneously reported by the subject and/or in response to an open question from 
the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational site.  Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, and pulse 
requiring an intervention should be reported as AEs. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible.  For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the 
onset (date and time), resolution (date and time) , severity, causality, action taken, serious outcome 
(if applicable), and whether or not it caused the subject  to discontinue the study.   
Adverse events  should be collected and recorded in the source documents and on the eCRF 
beginning at the time of signing the informed consent. Adverse events 
and SAEs should be reported 
through End of Study V isit or Early Termination V isit.  Both AEs and SAEs should be followed until 
resolution/stabilization or until a time that is mutually agreed upon between the medical  monitor 
and i nvestigator.   
Subject s who experience any AE or SAE should receive appropriate treatment and medical 
supervision as clinically indicated.  
All AEs will be graded for severity according to the Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse 
Events t able v5.0 ( CTCAE , 2017 ). 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section  11.2.2 . An AE of severe intensity 
may not be considered serious.  
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on Hepion’s pregnancy form.  Pregnancy, in itself, is  not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an investigational 
product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject  was 
discontinued from the study.  
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abo rtions without complications should not be 
handled as AEs.  
11.5. Reporting Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event along with an assessment of causality.  If at the time the 
investigator submits an initial SAE report and the SAE has not been resolved, the investigator must provide a follow -up report as soon as the event resolves (or upon receipt of significant 
information if the event is still ongoing).  Additional follo w-up information, if required or 
available, should reported to the Sponsor within one business Day of receipt. This should be completed on a follow -up SAE form and placed with the original SAE information and kept with 
the appropriate section of the CRF an d/or study file.  
All SAEs must be followed until resolution/stabilization or until a time that is mutually  agreed 
upon between the Medical Monitor and the Investigator.

  Hepion (or representative) is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authori ties of 
certain events.  It is the Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB or IEC of all SAEs that 
occur at his or her site.  Investigators will also be notified of all unexpected, serious, drug- related 
events that occur during the clinical trial.  Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB or IEC of 
these additional SAEs.

  AUC 0-inf and C max. These ratios will be expressed as a percentage relative to t he F2/F3 presumed 
NASH placebo control group.  
Ninety percent (90%) confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratios will be derived by exponentiation 
of the CIs obtained for the difference between F2/F3 presumed NASH groups LSM resulting 
from the analyses on the ln-transformed AUC 0-inf and C max. The CIs will be expressed as a 
percentage relative to the F2/F3 presumed NASH placebo control group.  
12.3.4.  Pharmacokinetics Analyses  
Values will be calculated for the whole blood concentrations and the PK parameters listed in  
Section  10.4, using appropriate summary statistics to be fully outlined in the SAP.  Population 
PK/PD analysis will be used to explore PK d ependent covariates and quantitative concentration -
effect relationships.  
12.3.5.  Safety Analyses  
All safety data will be populated in the individual CRFs. All safety data will be listed by 
subjects.  
Adverse events  will be coded using the most current version of Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) summarized by treatment for the number of subjects reporting 
the treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) and the number of TEAEs reported. A by -subject 
AE data listing including verbatim term, coded term, treatment, severity, and relationship to 
population will be provided.   
Safety data including ECGs, vital signs assessments and clinical laboratory results, will be summarized by population and point of time of collection.  
Descriptive statistics using appropriate summary statistics will be calculated for quantitative safety data as well as for the difference to baseline, when appropriate. In addition, a shift table 
describing out of normal range shifts will be provided for clinical laboratory results.   
Concomitant medications will be listed by subject and coded using the most current version of 
WHO drug dictionary. Medical history will be listed by subject.

  13. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
13.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigator can enter a subject  into the study, Hepion (or representative) may visit the 
investigational study site to:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities;  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Hepion (or representative).  This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between Hepion (or 
representative) and the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Hepion (or representative) will have regular contacts with the 
investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s);  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable;  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the CRF, and that investigational product accountability 
checks are being performed;  
• Perform source data verification . This includes a comparison of the data in the CRF 
with the subject ’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records 
relevant to the study.  This will require direct access to all original records for each 
subject  (e.g., clinic charts);  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Hepion (or representative);  
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs and confirm any SAEs have been forwarded to Hepion (or representative) and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
13.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized Hepion employee (or representative ), regulatory authority personal , or members of 
IEC or IRB may visit the site to perform audits or inspections including source data verification.  
The purpose of an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data 
were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical 
Practice, guidel ines of the International Conference on Harmonization , and any applicable 
regulatory requirements.  The investigator should contact Hepion immediately if contacted by a 
regulatory agency about an inspection.

 Treatment  Period  
Subjects will receive treatment with CRV431 or placebo from Day 1 to Day 28.  
 Follow Up Period  
After completion of the treatment period, the subjects will be monitored for additional 14 days.  
3.2 Treatment  
Subjects in Cohort A will receive CRV431 75 mg (1 x 75 mg softgel capsule) QD and subjects in 
Cohort B will receive  the matching placebo (1 x placebo softgel capsule) for Cohort A. 
Subjects in Cohort C will receive CRV431 225 mg (3 x 75 mg softgel capsules) QD and subjects in Cohort D will receive the matchin g placebo (3 x placebo softgel capsules) for Cohort C. 
 Treatment Administration  
Subjects will take study drug on the morning of each dosing day, with approximately 240 mL of water. On Day 1 and Day 28, subjects will fast overnight for at least 8 hours, will take CRV431 or matching placebo and will fast for an additional 2 hours after treatment administration. On subsequent days, subject will fast overnight for at least 8 hours, will take CRV431 or matching placebo and will fast for an additional 30 minutes after treatment administration.  
 Treatment Compliance

investigational product, when appropriate, for each AE (unrelated, possibly related or probably 
related). The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product. If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “unrelated.”  
If there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause and effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related.”  If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be 
“possible” or “probable” the event will be considered to be related to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.
 
 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it fulfills at least one of the following: 
• Results in death  
• It is immediately life -threatening  
• It requires in -patient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may requir e medical  
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
 Adverse Event Summaries  
All AEs (serious and non-serious) occurring after completion of the informed consent process and before the end of study, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be included and classified by SOC and PT using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).     
For treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), the following will be summarized and presented for the 
safety  analysis set:  
i. An overall summary of TEAEs, which includes:   
a. the number and percentage of subjects experiencing a TEAE  
b. the number and percentage of subject s experiencing a TEAE by strongest 
relationship to study medication 
c. the number and percentage of subjects experiencing a TEAE by greatest severi ty 
d. the number and percentage of subject s experiencing a TEAE leading to study 
withdrawal  
e. the number and percentage of subject s experiencing a treatment emergent SAE 
(TESAE)  
ii. the number and percentage of subjects experiencing a TEAE by SOC and  PT

iii. the number and percentage of subject s experiencing a TEAE by SOC, PT and the 
highest severity  
iv. the number and percentage of subject s experiencing a TEAE by SOC, PT and the 
strongest relationship to study medication 
v. the number and percentage of subjects experiencing a TESAE by SOC and PT 
vi. the number and percentage of subject s experiencing a TEAE leading to study 
withdrawal by SOC and PT 
In the overall summary of TEAEs table (i), besides tabulating the number and percentage of 
subject s, the total number of TEAE episodes will also be provided. If a subject  has repeated 
episodes of a particular TEAE, all episodes will be counted in the summary table.   
In the remaining summary tables, the incidence of TEAEs will be calculated by dividing the 
number of subject s who  have experienced the event by the total number of subject s in the safety  
set.  Thus, the incidence of TEAEs is shown in terms of the total number of subject s and not in 
terms of the total number of episodes.  If a subject  has repeated episodes of a particular TEAE, 
only the most severe episode, or the episode with the strongest causal relationship to study drug, 
will be counted in the summary tables.  
A subject  with more than one type of TEAE in a particular SOC will be counted only once in the 
total of subjects experiencing TEAEs in that particular SOC.  Since a subject could have more 
than one type of TEAE within a particular SOC, the sum of subject s experiencing different 
TEAEs within the SOC could appear larger than the total number of subjects experiencing 
TEAEs in that SOC.  Similarly, a subject  who has experienced a TEAE in more than one SOC 
will be counted only once in the total number of subject s experiencing AEs in all SOCs. 
All occurrences of all AEs will be listed for each subject , grouped by cohort.  The listing will 
contain the following information: treatment group, verbatim term, SOC, PT, severity, relationship to study medication, date and day of onset, date and day of resolution, treatment given to treat the adverse event, the outcome, whether the event was an SAE, whether it led to withdrawal and whether it is a TEAE .  Listings will be sorted by subject  identification number, 
onset date, SOC, and PT. If the onset date is completely missing, then these events will be presented first . If the onset date is missing a month or a day, then these events will be presented 
before any complete dates.  
7.3 Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
Hematology, Coagulation, Blood Chemistry and Urinalysis  data will be summarized by 
treatment group and visit.  All clinical laboratory data  will be converted to International System 
of Units ( SI). Both raw and change from baseline values will be summarized by presenting the 
descriptive statistics by treatment group and visit. 
Central and local drug and alcohol test results and pregnancy tests results will be listed.  
7.4 Vital Signs  
Vital sign s raw and change from baseline values will be summarized by presenting the 
descriptive statistics
 of blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and respiratory  rate measurements  
by treatment group and visit.

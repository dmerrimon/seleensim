4.· Purp�e. (tfi Investigation:
:Clearing'.tfie battlefield quickly and providing the best care possible for the wounded is a
priorify·.for·milliary medics. The primary mode of patient transport whether by land, sea or air is 
on a litter (NA TO litter for USAF aircraft) 3·�·7• Litter stands provide the support necessary to
transform a litter into an operating room (OR) table or hospital bed. Patients can spend several 
hours and/or days resting on a litter in a field hospital, or in transit to the next level of care 6-7•
Injuries or illness that prevents patients from normal movement and repositioning place them at 
increased risk of pressure ulcer development 8• Specialty beds and mattresses are available in 
most liospitals to help prevent pressure ulcer development in patients. Unfortunately, these 
products are not currently available for contingency or aeromedical evacuation (AE) operations. 
The purpose of this study is to measure peak skin interface pressures and the total area of the 
body exposed to skin interface pressure above 30 mm Hg at different areas of the body in the 
supine position on two different support surfaces applied to a standard North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) litter (NSN: 6530-01-380-7309) and a Raven 90C Litter (NSN6530-01-
432-5114). The Raven 90C is the official litter for the U.S. Navy. It is approved for flight on
USAF aircraft. It can be easily folded for storage and transport to remote settings. The support
surfaces are the Warrior Evacuation Litter Pad (WELP) and the Dolphin Fluid Immersion
Simulation Stretcher System (FIS). In theory, mattresses that reduce and/or minimize pressure on
the capillary bed's perfusion can help reduce pressure related injury such as pressure or
decubitus ulcer development. Skin interface pressure measurements using a pressure mapping
system along with transcutaneous oxygenation readings will allow us to determine these
differences between support surfaces. A better understanding of skin interface pressure
associated with the litter support surfaces is vital for military nurses to develop and implement
preventative interventions to reduce pressure ulcer development in our patients. In addition, this
study will provide information to help determine the usefulness and feasibility of incorporating
the fluid immersion system (FIS) as a litter support surface.

6.Proposed Research:
6.1. Background and Review of Literature:
Background (investigator names redacted 23 Jan 20) 
DGMC Human Research Protocol 
Each year, 2.5 million people in the United States (U.S.) develop pressure ulcers 1• 11,
while approximately 60,000 die of pressure ulcer (PU) related complications each year 9•
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid estimate that each pressure ulcer adds $43,000. in 
costs to a hospital stay 26• 31, as much as $70,000 for management of a single full 
thickness pressure ulcer, and an annual financial burden estimate of $11 billion per year 
25•Medicare considers Stage III and IV pressure ulcers a health care-associated condition
and will not pay for the additional treatment of patients who acquire them in the hospital
9• The incidence of pressure ulcers has increased in combat casualties returning from
Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) from 2003 to the
present 7• Inter-theater patient movement can have injured and or/ill patients resting on
litters for >8 to 10 hours 6• Research conducted by Lt Col Susan Dukes using the Joint
Theater Trauma Registry (JTTR) from 2008-2012 found 164 patients developed pressure
ulcers (PU) within three days after enroute care (ERC) transport and 142 (87%) were
Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCA TT) patients 43• The number of CCA TT patients
with PUs was only 5% of the total number of patients transported; however, it was still
relatively close to the 7% of hospital acquired pressure ulcers reported for acute care
facilities in the U. S. 6• 24• Prevention of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPU) is a
nursing quality outcome measure used to evaluate the effectiveness of nursing care and
optimal patient outcomes 1•7•9•10•11•18• 23• 28•30• In October 2008, the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services added prevention of HAPU to the National Patient Safety Initiatives
31•Preventing HAPU is also a priority for improving the quality care in the current
Healthy People 2020 objectives 26•
Pressure Ulcers 
Pressure ulcers (PU) are defined by the United States National Pressure Ulcer 
Advisory Panel (NPUAP) and the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) as 
"localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue usually over a bony prominence, as 
a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear" 8•9• Pressure ulcers develop
when soft tissue is compressed between a bony prominence and a hard surface for an 
extended period of time. In an alert person with normal motor and sensory function, 
nociceptors sense increased pressure and signal the brain. As a result of the signal, the 
person naturally repositions. But if a patient is anesthetized, has a condition that impairs 
their ability to reposition (such as decreased level of consciousness or paralysis), or is 
taking opioids that decrease the pain messages, this protective mechanism is blunted or 
completely disappears raising the risk of pressure ulcer development 9• 18• 3940• While PUs 
can appear in as little as 24 hours, it can take as long as five days before they appear 10•13•
20,35• Prevention of PU development is extremely important as they lead to decreased 
quality of life, increased length of hospital stay, pain, increased morbidity and decreased 
mortality 1• Pressure ulcers are both high cost and high volume adverse events. Although

multiple factors contribute to ulceration such as nutritional status, level of bladder/bowel 
control (continence), physical condition, level of consciousness, immobility, exposure to 
pressure, shear and friction forces, the key factor in tissue damage is unrelieved pressure 
2, 5,9, 18, 20, 27•Therefore, surfaces that can redistribute pressure across the body are
important 19•
Mattress Surfaces 
In the past, purchasing hospital mattresses was a simple task carried out by 
housekeeping staff or supply custodians. Now with advanced clinical understanding of 
how a mattress can effect skin/wound development and healing, mattress selection has 
increased in importance 14• 17• 19•22• 32•36• The choice of a medical mattress must be made
with a clinical focus on therapy and treatment. A variety of support surfaces are on the 
market. Many manufacturers claim that their product relieves or reduces the external 
forces that contribute to pressure ulcer development. 
Fluid Immersion System (FIS) 
The U.S. Navy trained dolphins for military exercises to use their sophisticated sonar 
abilities. However, the transport of dolphins outside of water subjects them to the vertical 
shear forces of gravity causing internal organ trauma and circulatory distress. An Auto 
Vector surface was created in response to minimize the effects of the gravity's shearing 
forces. Biologics Inc. began development of a Fluid Immersion Simulation (FIS) 
software technology to mimic the fluid buoyancy of a body in salt water. This new 
technology was further developed for medical patients. Joerns Healthcare now offers the 
health care industry hospital beds, operating room tables, stretchers and wheelchairs with 
this FIS technology. Dolphin FIS software uses complex algorithms, a microprocessor 
and sophisticated dynamic pressure waveform analysis to precisely adjust the density of 
the surface for the unique anatomical features of the patient. It is reported to continuously 
monitor the patient's weight, three dimensional (30) surface area and movements to 
automatically calculate the exact settings to effectively manage the pressure of the 
patient's body in the medium. The result is that the patient is truly floating, cradled in a 
simulated fluid environment and suspended in a near neutrally buoyant state (according 
to the manufacturer/product developer). Distortion to the body is minimized and 
orientation of bone, muscle and subcutaneous tissue is normalized (using volumetric 
pressure redistribution). Dolphin FIS technology is easy to use. There's virtually no 
programming, no manual data input, and no need for caregiver/staff intervention. Simply 
plug it into the wall and place the patient on the Auto Vector (mattress) surface. Auto 
Vector "Dolphin" Stretcher Mattress with FIS is customizable to any stretcher regardless 
of make or model 41-42• Therefore, this technology could be designed to fit a NATO litter 
with or without the Special Medical Emergency Evacuation Device (SMEED) commonly 
used to support equipment with critical care aeromedical transport team (CCA TT) 
patients. It also remains inflated up to eight hours with full operation under its own 
internal battery supply. This is a FDA approved commercially available product.

DGMC Human Research Protocol 
A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of studi�s focusing on the 
effectiveness of pressure redistribution support surfaces in the prevention of pressure 
ulcers found good evidence that higher specification foam mattresses, sheepskin and 
. some overlays are effective in preventing pressure ulcers. However, the benefits ofhigh­
tech constant low pressure and alternating pressure for pressure ulcer prevention are still 
unclear. Further research is recommended19•21•
Limited data exists on blood flow perfusion using the Dolphin FIS technology 32•33•
Kohanzadeh et al. (2009). 33 investigated the effect ·or the FIS stretcher system on the 
body's cutaneous microcirculation using laser doppler flow instrumentation inl O healthy 
subjects on a hospital gurney. Skin perfusion was measured at pressure points of the 
bilateral shoulders of each subject. This technique allowed investigators to monitor the 
dynamic changes in the microcirculation in real time. A significant difference was 
observed in perfusion of 90.52% vs. 22.31 % on a regular gurney mattress and Dolphin 
FIS, respectively. This significant improvement in microcirculation using the Dolphin 
FIS technology when compared to regular gurney foam support mattress may result in 
reduced pressure sores and greater patient comfort. These results are supported from 
observations by Evers et al. (2009)32• Researchers found significantly improved blood 
flow on the Dolphin FIS when compared to the standard gurney/bed despite such 
encouraging results, the studies were small scale with limited sample sizes. Therefore, 
further study with this new FIS technology is recommended 33•
NATO Litter 
Very little literature is published on the use of NATO litters and/or litter padding and 
pressure ulcer development37•38• The interface pressure areas were compared in two 
subjects on the screw and plate strip NA TO litter and tacked canvas NA TO litter (NA TO 
6530-99-138-8737). Both litter versions were evaluated without mattresses. Pressure 
varied greatly on the screw and plate litter than the tacked litter. Pressure was highest 
when the subject's sacrum rested over a ridge on the screw and plate stretcher (138 
mmHg and 104 mmHg) compared with 38 and 43 mmHg on the tacked litter. The authors 
concluded that the tacked litter might possibly be better than the screw and plate version 
38 
In a larger study, investigators explored the differences in skin interface pressures of 
subjects on the NA TO litter (the standard canvas NA TO litter with wooden poles, NSN 
6530-00-783-7905) 3• Thirty-two subjects (18 women/14 men, ages 18-55) underwent 
skin interface pressure measurements on multiple locations over the body (bilateral heels, 
calves, buttocks, scapula, elbows, occiput and sacrum) using the X Sensor pressure 
mapping system. The measurements were taken with subjects on various litter 
configurations: the litter without any padding, with a military wool blanket for padding, 
with the standard aeromedical evacuation (AE) litter pad and with the Baxter Maxifloat 
Mattress. Pressure measurements were taken with the subjects in various physical 
positions (supine, 30° degree lateral position with 0° degree backrest elevation and supine 
with 40° degree backrest elevation) for each litter iteration (with and without the 
padding). There was a significant and progressive decrease in peak pressures between the

litter with no padding and the litter with the AE mattress. The greatest pressure decrease 
was found with the Maxifloat mattress. The wool blanket added the least amount of 
pressure reduction (mainly in the region of the buttocks). The AE mattress reduced 
pressures in all areas measures when compared to the litter with no padding and the litter 
with the wool blanket. The Maxifloat mattress reduced pressure areas on an average of 20 
mmHg more than the AE mattress. However, peak pressures over the high risk body 
areas (e.g. occiput, heels and sacrum) were all higher than the critical closing pressure 
(30 mmHg). This finding indicated a potential risk for pressure ulcer development. 
These peak pressures were also higher than those on the Maxifloat mattress. Elevating 
heels, turning or repositioning are recommended for patients at risk for pressure ulcer 
development. Unfortunately on an AE mission with critically injured and/or ventilated 
patient, turning and repositioning may not be possible. The investigators recommended 
further study using litter stanchions, the Raven litter and a mesh decontamination litter. 
They also recommended that transcutaneous oxygenation and blood flow be measured3•
Pressure Mapping 
Pressure mapping systems determine the actual pressure between the body surface and 
the resting platform (mattress, bed, seat cushion, etc.). The mapping system consists of a 
thin, sensor-filled mat with monitoring capabilities placed between the patient and the 
surface he's lying, sitting, or standing on. The sensors convey interface pressures to a 
computer, which produces a color-coded image of the pressure distribution on a computer 
screen. Different colors represent different pressure ranges. Typically, the colors blue and 
green represent lower pressure ranges while yellow, orange, and red indicate 
progressively higher pressure levels 15• Although the amount of pressure and/or duration
of pressure causing skin damage·remain equivocal, evidence suggests that 30 mm Hg be 
considered the threshold for pressure measurement. Pressures �30 mmHg is believed to 
exceed capillary filling pressure, causing ischemia and skin damage 35•
6.2. Relevance/Significance: 
The war wounded are not immune to pressure ulcer development and unfortunately, as a 
result of the severity of their injuries and the process of medical evacuation, the risk for pressure 
ulcer development in wounded personnel returning from Iraq and Afghanistan has increased. 
Furthermore, the risk for pressure ulcers was identified, with one of the major military treatment 
centers noting an increase in the incidence of pressure ulcers among the returning wounded 7• 43• 
Pressure ulcers are characteristically more prevalent in adults �65 years of age due to changes 
associated with advanced age and failing health. They are also associated in individuals with 
limited or no mobility such as spinal cord injuries. The Global War on Terror has created a new 
population of young polytrauma patients with new challenges for the military health care system, 
one of which is preventing pressure ulcer development. Their injuries were most likely sustained

in a hostile and austere environment where care was focused primarily on immediate life­
threatening interventions and medical evacuation to a higher level of care. Medical evacuation 
most likely occurred on a NA TO field litter, which can produce peak interface pressures greater 
than 30 mm Hg over bony prominences3 and limit tissue perfusion 35• The combination of poly­
trauma, traumatic brain injury, hypoperfusion, sedation, cervical collars, and medical evacuation 
places injured individuals at high risk for pressure ulcer development early in the care 
continuum. Finding ways to reduce or eliminate pressure ulcer development is a patient 
safety/quality of care issue. Interventions to help reduce/eliminate this problem as early in the 
continuum of care as possible would improve patient safety outcomes and raise quality of care. 
In the operational setting, that starts with the transport litter. 
Purpose: 
The purpose of this study is to measure peak skin interface pressures and the total area of the 
body exposed to skin interface pressures above 30 mm Hg while subjects are in the supine 
position. Two different support surfaces will be applied to a standard North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) litter (NSN: 6530-01-380-7309) and a Raven 90C Litter (NSN6530-01-
432-5114). The support surfaces are the Warrior Evacuation Litter Pad (WELP) and the Dolphin
Fluid Immersion System (FIS). These pressure measurements along with transcutaneous
oxygenation readings will allow us to determine differences between support surfaces.
This research protocol has one major aim: 
To determine the difference in the pressure redistribution qualities between the WELP and the 
Dolphin FIS 
There are also two secondary aim.s: 
1.To determine the difference in the pressure redistribution qualities of the WELP when used as
the mattress on the NA TO litter and Raven litter.
2.To determine the difference in the pressure redistribution qualities of the Dolphin FIS when
used as the mattress on the NA TO litter and Raven litter.
6.3. Hypotheses or Research Questions or Objectives:
Research Questions: 
1.Is there a significant difference in pressure redistribution qualities between the WELP and
Dolphin FIS mattresses on the NA TO Litter?
2.Is there a significant difference in the pressure redistribution qualities between the WELP and
Dolphin FIS mattresses on the Raven Litter?

Hypotheses: 
1.Pressure redistribution qualities will be greater for subjects on the Dolphin FIS than the WELP
in the supine position.
2.There is a difference in pressure distribution between men and women, given BMI level (high,
ideal) for subjects on the WELP padded NA TO with Raven litters.
3.There is a difference in pressure distribution between men and women, given BMI level (high,
ideal) for subjects on the Dolphin FIS padded NA TO with Raven litters.
4.There is a difference in pressure redistribution qualities of the WELP for subjects on the
NA TO and Raven litters.
5.There is a difference in pressure redistribution qualities of the Dolphin FIS for subjects on the
NA TO and Raven litters.
Outcome measures: 
Pressure Redistribution: Peak Pressure Index & Total Surface Area (TSA) 
Pressure redistribution qualities will be measured in mmHg using XSensor X3 pressure mapping 
technology. To minimize the risk of a faulty sensor or false reading over one sensor, the average 
of eight cells around the region will be recorded and referred to as the Peak Pressure Index (l>PI). 
Peak interface pressure is the highest average pressure (mm Hg) measured over vulnerable bony 
prominences ( occiput, sacrum, and bilateral scapula, buttocks, and heels). 
TSA will be measured in centimeters squared (cm2). Vulnerable bony prominences with skin 
interface pressures exceeding 30 mm Hg will be documented. 
Tissue Perfusion: Transcutaneous Oxygenation: 
Transcutaneous partial pressures of oxygen (tcp02) in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) is non­
invasive measurement/monitoring of the skin's surface partial pressure of oxygen. For purposes 
of this study, tcp02 measurements will be captured in the scapula region and expressed in mm 
Hg. Transcutaneous tissue perfusion has been used as the index of tissue viability by several 
groups 44•45•49• From the early work of Seiler et al. (19�7, 1983) 47•48, a baseline tcp02 value for

uncompressed soft tissue was established as 80 mmHg (10.7kPa). When tissue is subjected to 
pressure load, the tcp02 decreases dramatically due to occlusion of the blood flow underneath the 
pressure point. Bogie et al. ( 1992) 46 suggested a threshold value of tcp02 as 30 mmHg to 
indicate a significantly higher risk to tissue viability below this value. Bogie et al. ( 1995) so later 
suggested the threshold value for tcp02 as 44 mmHg. 
Body Mass Index (BMI) will be obtained for men and women obtained using tools (BMI 
calculator and/or tables) from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National 
Institutes of Health, Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. For the purposes of this study, BMis will 
be categorized as high or ideal.

6.4. Research Design and Methods: 
Research Design 
This protocol is a Quasi Experimental Cross Factor study. The subject sample is 
nonrandomized. Subjects will be their own control and have repeated measurements to 
compare baseline and supine transcutaneous oxygenation levels on four different surface 
combinations. Interface pressure will be measured using the XSensor X3 Pressure 
Mapping System 32x 80 medical mattress, W' resolution, 10,240 sensing points, 5-50 
& 10-200mmHg pressure range. The XSensor system uses force transducer arrays, which 
consist of a grid of transducers with half inch square resolution aligned in a matrix which 
is embedded in a 32 x 80 thin mat which is placed under the subject to map the entire 
body. Calibration of the pressure mapping system will be performed before and after each 
participant and the amount of drift evaluated. Mattress will be sanitized with disinfectant 
wipes between each participant. The sequence of the four surface combinations will be 
randomly assigned using Research Randomizer at https://www.randomizer.org for each 
participant. A stratified sampling scheme will be used to ensure adequate representation 
of the following attributes: gender, normal weight and overweight or obese as determined 
byBMI. 
Healthy adults with authorized access to Travis AFB will be offered the opportunity to 
participate in this study. After the consenting process is completed, subjects will be

scheduled for study participation. If time allows, the subject may be able to participate 
directly after completing the consent process. The subject will be assigned an 
identification (ID) number which will be annotated on the consent form and all of the 
data collection documents. The subject's name will only appear on the study consent 
form. All other study documents and data collection forms will only have the subject's ID 
number and no other personally identifiable information (PII). Subjects will be asked to 
wear a nonrestrictive single layer of garments for the study. They will be given a hospital 
gown to wear over the upper body. This will allow the study staff easy access to the 
subject's back for application of the transcutaneous oxygenation transducers. Females 
will not be required to remove their bra. Subjects will be asked their age and have their 
height and weight measured by a study team member. They will also be asked their litter 
and mattress preferences at the end of the study. The study portion should take 
approximately two hours to complete and can be broken into segments for multiple visits 
if necessary to accommodate a subjects schedule. 
Prior to skin oximetry readings, subjects will be asked to refrain from exercising, 
smoking and drinking caffeinated beverages for at least two hours before data collection. 
These readings will be performed using specialized equipment from the DGMC 
hyperbaric clinic. Bilateral transcuta.neous oxygenation will be obtained using a 
radiometer or Perimed™ instrument and by placing electrochemical transducers 
bilaterally in the region of the subject's scapula. The transducers and probes will be 
affixed to the skin after the site has been cleaned. To increase permeability of the skin to 
oxygen at the measuring sites, transducers will be heated to 44° C (11 l.2°F). After a 
calibration period of approximately 10-15 minutes, a constant transcutaneous partial 
pressure of oxygen will be obtained and recorded onto the patient data sheet. Baseline 
measurements will then be obtained ( about five additional minutes) with the subject 
sitting upright and no pressure applied to the back. 
Next, the subject will be asked to lay supine on the first of four randomly assigned litter 
mattress combinations. Because the litters will be resting on top of stands, special care 
will be taken by study team members to en�ure subjects safely mount and dismount litters 
without injury. Subjects will be secured to the litters in accordance with Aeromedical 
Evacuation Equipment Standards (AFil0-2909, 23 July 2013 pages 73-74). 
"5.4.4.1. The patient is placed on the litter, covered with the sheet and blanket as 
necessary, and secured to the litter with 2 litter straps. The straps are placed mid-thigh 
and on the upper chest of the patient. Secure the litter straps so the buckles are on the 
aisle side of the litter, and lay the excess strap flat over the patient. DO NOT tie the 
excess strap in a knot. Litter straps will be visible for inspection. 
5.4.4.2. A mattress pad is recommended to prevent skin breakdown. " 
After the subject is positioned comfortably on the litter, the pressure mapping will begin.

body region) will be measured for the occiput, sacrum, bilateral scapula, buttocks and 
heel areas. The total body surface area exposed to skin interface pressure greater than 
30mm Hg will also be measured in centimeters squared ( cm2) for each body region. 
Measures of tissue perfusion using the tcp02 in mmHg will be measured for comparison 
to baseline data. This process will take approximately twenty minutes for each of the four 
iterations. An additional 30 minutes is required to change the ·litter and mattress 
configurations. After baseline data are captured and tcp02 measurements are taken with 
the subject supine on all four litter/mattress combinations, the session is complete. 
Data from subjects who do not complete all four litter/mattress combinations will be 
excluded from the analysis. An estimated 25% attrition rate is factored into this study to 
ensure that 43 completed data sets are obtained. 
6.S. Risks/Benefits:
•There is a potential risk of injury from falling off the litter while attempting to mount or
dismount. This risk will be minimized by having a member of the research staff present
whenever a subject is on the litter. Staff will be available to assist participants on and off
the litter. A step stool will also be available to assist participants in safely mounting and
dismounting the litter.
•There is also a potential risk of skin reaction to the adhesive which will hold the
transcutaneous oxygenation transducers in place. If a participant shows signs and/or
symptoms of skin irritation from the adhesive (redness, itching, rash or hives), the
adhesive will be removed and the participant will be encouraged to see their primary care
provider if the signs and/or symptoms do not quickly resolve or becomes worse after the
adhesive is removed. If the participant's initial reaction to the adhesive pads is severe
( difficulty breathing, face/lips, throat swelling, loss of consciousness) the subject will be
taken to the DGM C Emergency Department for treatment.
•There is a potential risk of superficial bum from the tcp02 transducers. They are heated to
44 degrees Celsius which is 111.2 degrees Fahrenheit. If a participant shows signs and/or
symptoms of skin irritation (redness) or complains of burning, stinging or discomfort in
the area of the transducers, the transducers will be removed and the participant will be
encouraged to see their primary care provider if the signs and or symptoms do not
quickly resolve or become worse. If the participant needs immediate medical assistance,
they will be taken to the DGM C emergency department for treatment.
•There is no anticipated individual benefit to subjects attributed to participation in
this study. Given the economic and overall health impact of pressure ulcer development,
a litter mattress system that can help reduce and/or eliminate pressure sore development
will be beneficial to military patients in theater and during transport.

6.8. Data Collection/ Analysis: 
A sarriple size of 43 subjects is required for this study. This is similar to the sample size used by 
Col Elizabeth Bridges and colleagues in a study of skin interface pressure on a NATO litter3. In 
their study, a stratified sample (n= 32) with four support surfaces using a single canvas style 
NA TO litter was used. The surface effect was statistically significant for all peak pressure and 
surface area analyses (repeated-measures analysis of variance, p < 0.01, a 0.05, p 0.20). 
Interface pressure will be measured using XSensor X3 Pressure Mapping 32x 80 medical 
mattress, 5-50 & 10-200mmHg pressure range. The XSensor system uses force transducer arrays, 
which consist of a grid of transducers with half inch square resolution aligned in a matrix which 
is embedded in a 32 x 80 inch thin mat. This mat is placed under the subject to map their entire 
body. Calibration will be performed before and after each participant and the amount of drift 
evaluated. Mattress will be sanitized with disinfectant wipes between each participant. 
A stratified sampling scheme will be used to ensure adequate representation of the following 
attributes: gender, normal weight and overweight or obese as determined by BMI. 
The dependent variables (pressure mapping index= mmHg, Total body surface area {TSA) 
greater than 30 mmHg = cm2 ; transcutaneous oxygenation (tcp02) = mm Hg) will be measured 
on four different support surface combinations using the independent variables -
litters/mattresses: (l) NATO litter with the WELP; (2) NATO litter with the Dolphin FIS; (3) 
Raven litter with the WELP and (4) Raven litter with the Dolphin FIS. 
The subjects will service as their own controls. Baseline measures of tcp02 over bilateral 
scapular regions will be taken with the subjects sitting upright prior to having them lay supine on 
the support surfaces for pressure mapping with repeated tcp02 measurements. 
Data collected will include the subject's age, race, gender, height and weight the weight will be 
measured on a calibrated scale. 
Subject height arid weight will used to determine their BMI. 
BMI is an individual's weight (in kilograms) divided by their height squared (in centimeters). 
The BMI calculator or tables from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) web will be used to calculate BMI for this study. 
http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose wt/BMI/bmi tbl.htm 
NIH BMI Categories: For the Purposes of this study: BMI 
Underweight = <18.5 
Normal weight = 18.5-24.9 Ideal = 18.5-24.9 
Overweight= 25-29.9 High= 25 or greater 
Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater

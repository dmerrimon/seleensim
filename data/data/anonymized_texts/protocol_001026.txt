2.0    BACKGROUND  
      2.1     Umbilical cord blood tr ansplantation in hema tologic malignancies 
 
Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells  derived from bone marrow and       
peripheral blood of sibling and unrelated donors has been us ed successfully to treat 
patients with high-risk or recurrent hema tological malignancies.  However, bone 
marrow transplants (BMT) are limited by the lack of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 
matched donors and the high risk of gr aft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after 
transplantation.  Although there are more th an 10 million registered donors worldwide, 
more than 30% of patients requiring transpla nts are unable to find a matched donor.
1  
This proportion is higher for patients of  minority descent.  Patients who receive 
unmatched transplants have decreased surv ival secondary to severe GVHD (80%) and 
opportunistic infections.2  
 
In order to increase the donor pool, umbilical  cord blood (UCB) is now being used for 
transplants.  Unrelated UCB tr ansplants have a high rate of engraftment with a low risk 
of acute GVHD even in the 1-2 HLA mis-matched setting in children3-5 and adults.6  
However, delayed engraftment and associ ated treatment-related toxicity and 
opportunistic infections result in high treatment-related mort ality in adults.  Laughlin et 
al emphasized the importance of nucleated cell dose in hematopoietic recovery while 
HLA compatibility played a less significan t role.  Clearly demonstrated was an 
increased event-free survival rate in patient s who received grafts containing more than 
1.2 x 105 CD34+ cells per kilogram.6  Recently the Institute of Medicine commissioned 
a study of UCB outcomes from p ooled data of 755 cases of adults and children in the 
United States.  This study showed a clear e ffect of HLA matching on  survival, with 6/6 
matches faring better than 5/6 or 4/6 matches.   The magnitude of this effect, however, 
was most apparent at lower cell doses (<2.5 x 107 total nucleated cells per kilogram), 
emphasizing the effect of cell dose relative to HLA match.7        
 
2.2   Double cord blood transplantation, Hapl oidentical transplantation, and Combined 
Haploidentical and Cord Blood transplantation 
 
Disappointed with the delayed engraftment after cord blood transplantation, several 
groups have tried to en hance recovery by (1) in vitro  expansion of cords;8 (2) infusion 
of multiple cords;9 or (3) combination of cord blood transplant with cells from other 
IRB#:  14736B    
4        11/19/2012 origins.  One way to increase the nucleated cell dose is to combine UCB units.  Initial 
animal studies have shown that combined gr afts have a higher su rvival than single 
grafts.10 In a pilot series of patients with hemato logic malignancies, Barker et al showed 
that combined transplantation of two partia lly matched UCB units resulted in a median 
time to neutrophil engraftment of 23 days (range 15-41).9  Interestingly, in each case, 
permanent hematopoiesis was derived from one  of the two cords.  The other cord was 
eliminated.   While total nucleated nor CD34+ cell counts nor  HLA match predicted 
which donor would predominate, the predom inating unit had a significantly higher 
CD3+ dose (p<0.01).  Nucleated cell and CD 34+ dose in the predominating unit were 
significantly associated with speed of neutrophil recover y.  With a median follow-up of 
10 months (range 3.5 months-2.5 years), di sease-free survival (DFS) was 57% at one 
year, with 72% of patients a live at one year if transpla nted in remission or chronic 
phase.11  Ballen et al reported results of a pha se 1 study of double cord transplantation 
using a reduced intensity conditioning regi men of fludarabine, melphalan, and rabbit 
antithymocyte globulin  (rATG, Thymoglobulin).10  The median time to neutrophil 
engraftment was 20 days (range 15-34).  Th e 100 day transplant-related mortality was 
14%.  Chimerism analysis showed predominance of one cord by Day +100 in 79% evaluable patients.  In 85% of these patients, the first cord infused predominated.  With a median follow-up of 7 months (range 2- 16 months), the overa ll survival was 79%, 
and the DFS was 64%.  Two patients (both with MDS complicating aplastic anemia) 
experienced primary graft failure.
11      
 
Haploidentical transplantation, the transpla ntation of stem cells from a partially 
matched related donor (typically a parent, child or sibling) has been explored starting in 
the early 1980’s.  Initial studies were charac terized by a high incidence of graft failure, 
immunodeficiency, and GVHD.2  The administration of massive doses of CD34-
selected (thus T-cell depleted) stem cells ca n prevent  graft rejection, perhaps through a 
veto mechanism, and assure reliable engraftment without excessive GVHD.12  I n  
clinical trials of pediatric and young adul t patients, this has resulted in acceptable 
outcomes.13  We have previously tested this approach in adults with advanced 
hematologic malignancies with disappointing results.  Reliable and rapid engraftment 
occurred, and the incidence of GVHD was ve ry low.  But patients had prolonged severe 
immunosuppression, and there was a high inci dence of delayed fatal opportunistic 
infections.14 
 
In order to augment recovery of hematopoi esis following cord blood transplantation, a 
Spanish group has studied combined haploi dentical and cord blood transplantation.  
Their observations indicated that initial rapid engraftment was obtained from the 
haploidentical T-cell depleted graft; subsequent hematopoies is resulted from the cord 
blood which appeared to permanently repl ace the haploidentical hematopoiesis.15  
 
In an oral presentation at the 2004 American Society of Hematology Meetings16, 
Fernandez summarized result s of this work, which has been updated at the 2005 Third 
Annual International Umbilical Cord  Blood Transplantation Symposium17 and in a 
recent publication18.  His group has transplanted 28 pati ents with advanced hematologic 
malignancies.  The median age was 30 (16- 63) and weight 67 (43- 87) Kg.  The basic 
IRB#:  14736B    
5        11/19/2012 conditioning regimen was fluda rabine, cyclophosphamide, tota l body irradiation (TBI), 
and equine antithymocyte globulin (ATGAM), with modifications in 6 patients.  The 
UCB units had 2.37 (1.31-3.7) x107 TNC/Kg and 0.11 (0.035-0.37) x106 CD34+ 
cells/Kg and were 0-2 HLA mismatches to th e recipient.  The 3rd party donor was an 
HLA haploidentical relative for 24 (mother fo r 4; also father, sibling, son, nephew), a 
higher HLA mismatched (mm) relative for 3, and a fully HLA mm unrelated donor for 
1.  All 3rd party cells were extensively T-cell depleted so that the infused cells 
contained a median of 2.31 (1.05-2.58) x106 CD34+/Kg and 0.25 (0.05-0.98) x104 
CD3+/Kg. 
 
Initially, post-transplant ci rculating granulocytes were  predominantly from the 3rd party 
donor in all patients except th e four receiving maternal CD 34+ cells.  Analysis of DNA 
polymorphisms showed initial predomin ance of the 3rd party donor both in 
granulocytes and mononuclear  cells and subsequent progressive replacement by UCB 
cells.  Excluding the 4 patients who received maternal mobilized peripheral blood cells, 
the corresponding data was: median time to ANC>0.5x109/L was 9.5 days (9-17); CB-
ANC>0.5x109/L was 22 days; and full CB chimerism 54 days; median time to platelets 
>20x109/L and >50x109/L was 30 and 54 days, respec tively.  The 4 who received 
maternal cells had no significant engraftmen t of these cells, although 3 had exclusive 
UCB chimerism, 2 of which reached fu ll UCB engraftment (days 20 and 36).  
Replacement of the 3rd party graft by the UCB engraftment may be due to rejection by 
the UCB-derived immune system or im munization to minor histocompatibility 
antigens.18 
 
20 of 27 (74%) patients had acute GVHD (a -GVHD) of any grade after day 11 post- 
transplant; 4 of 27 (14.8%) reach ed grade III-IV.  Most of  the patients with a-GVHD 
responded to corticosteroid therapy.  Ther e were two deaths pr imarily related to a-
GVHD, one occurred in one of two patients who did not receive ATG as part of the 
preparative regimen.  DNA analysis of sk in biopsies of GVHD lesions showed UCB 
DNA in several instances, but in no case were third party donor cells  detected.  Only 4 
out of 20 patients at risk developed manifestions of chronic GVHD (c-GVHD), which 
was limited in all.     
 
8 deaths have been reported related to the procedure (toxicity 2; graft failure 1; GVHD 
>II 2; opportunistic infection 3) .  The 2 deaths due to toxici ty occurred in patients who 
received 1.2 Gy TBI without fludarabine.  One developed multi-organ failure and the 
other veno-occlusive disease.  Two of the d eaths due to opportunistic infection were 
due to CMV; the other from toxoplasmosis.  With a median follow up of 10 months (1-
75) for all patients and 16 months (3-75) fo r the 20 living (9 surv iving >2years), the 4 
year overall survival is  67% for the whole group.17       
 
2.3 Rationale for the current study 
The applicability of BMT is limited by th e availability of a matched donor.  As 
described   earlier, umbilical cord transplants provide an additional source for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).  Partia lly matched UCB transplants have already 
been shown to engraft with reduced acute GVHD.  The major limitation to UCB 
IRB#:  14736B    
6        11/19/2012 transplants is delayed engraftm ent which is related to nucleat ed cell dose.  Our patient 
population is relatively older, has advanc ed disease, and often suffers from 
comorbidities.  Prolonged neutropenia is not tolerated, and intensive conditioning is necessary to induce durable disease contro l.  We are therefore interested in 
recapitulating the Spanish data in a patient  population with more advanced disease.  
 
For patients transplanted in remission, we will use a conditioning regimen of fludarabine-melphalan because it is relativel y well tolerated and effective in assuring 
engraftment and preventing GVHD.
 11, 19    
 
For high risk patients, we will use either fludarabine-thiotepa-TBI20 or busulfan-
fludarabine21, as currently evaluated at University of Chicago. 
 
Correlative studies will include those related to engraftment and i mmune reconstitution. 
 
The essential differences between our proposed study and the Spanish study will be the following: 
 
1. Patient selection. The median age in our studies is usually over 50, more than two 
decades older than in the Spanish studies.  Age-related differences in the immune 
system may profoundly affect our outcomes.  2. Differences in conditioning regimen, which are influenced by our institutional experience.   
2.4 Preliminary Data as of February 2012 
 
We published our initial experience with reduc ed intensity conditioning of this regimen 
(Liu, Blood, Oct 2011 pre-published online). Over all, this regimen has been promising 
with early engraftment in th e majority of subjects and cord-blood predominance later. 
We also had shifted from TBI based regimens  for active disease to an alternative non-
radiation approach of diseas e reduction before transplant with chemotherapy and then 
at the nadir of cytopenia, using reduced inte nsity conditioning.  This  is an approach we 
have used for matched donors with success.

4.0    PATIENT SELECTION AND STEM CELL SOURCE  
      4.1    Patient selection   
 
Patients are eligible for enrollment if th ey are an appropriate  candidate for   
transplantation, and an HLA-id entical related or unrelated  donor cannot be identified 
within an appropriate time frame. 
 
     4.2    Hematopoietic stem cell source 
IRB#:  14736B    
8        11/19/2012  
Umbilical cord cells will be obtained from established um bilical cord bl ood centers.  
Umbilical cord preparation procedure wi ll be according to established cell lab 
procedures in accordance with FACT/FDA guidelines.  
 
     4.3    Selection of grafts 
 
4.3.1 Cord Blood. Preliminary searches of umbilical cord -blood banks will be         
performed using the patient’s HLA phenot ype, as determined by molecular typing 
for class I HLA-A, B, C; and class II DR  and DQ.  Preferred cord-blood units are 
those that are antigen-matched for greater than 3 of 6 HLA loci (HLA A, B, DR) 
and contain a minimum cell count of 1 x 107 nucleated cells per kilogram of the 
recipient’s body weight before freezing.  A less closely matched graft with higher 
nucleated cells will be selected over a more closely matched graft with fewer nucleated cells.  
            4.3.2     Third Party Donor. The preferred 3
rd party donor will be a young, non- maternal 
HLA haploidentical relative. After appr opriate evaluation as per transplant 
program critera (Appendix I) , the donor will receive G-CSF (filgrastim) 5 
mcg/kg SQ BID for four consecutive days . Apheresis will start on the morning of 
the fifth day and proceed until sufficient cells have been co llected. Apheresis 
procedure will be conducted as per transplant program policy (Appendix J)  Typically four total blood volumes (TBV) are collected. The use of pediatric 
donors is restricted to donors who are ove r the age of 14 and weigh more than 50 
kg.

 Rabbit antithymocyte globulin  (Thymoglobulin, r-ATG) 
 
             5.2.2     High Risk Patients  (refer to ASBMT Criteria
22):  
 
                  5.2.2.1  Fludarabine-Thiotepa-TBI  as per institutional guidelines (See Appendix B). 
IRB#:  14736B    
9        11/19/2012                    Rabbit antithymocyte globulin  (Thymoglobulin, r-ATG) 
 5.2.2.2  Busulfan-Fludarabine  as per institutional guidelines will be considered if 
the patient is not eligible for TBI  (See Appendix C). Busulfan will be 
targeted if possible to an AUC of 4800 to 6000 per day using therapeutic 
drug monitoring 
 
          Rabbit antithymocyte globulin  (Thymoglobulin, r-ATG) 
 
5.2.2.3  Cytoreductive therapy at the treati ng physicians discretion followed 7 – 
21 days later (although longer if clinically required) 
 
 Fludarabine-Melphalan as per institutional guidelines (See Appendix A) 
                               
 Rabbit antithymocyte globulin  (Thymoglobulin, r-ATG) 
 
 
     5.3    Umbilical cord blood infusion 
 
  On day 0 or day 1 the cord  blood product will be prepared  and infused according to   
transplant program policy 431.02 “Infusio n of Cryopreserved  Hematopoietic 
Progenitor Cells by Nurses” (see Appendix H). 
 
     5.4     Haploidentical stem cell preparation 
 
 Stem cells will be collected from a haploidentical donor. The preferred 3
rd party 
donor will be a young HLA haploidentical re lative. After appropr iate evaluation as 
per transplant program criteria, the donor will receive G-CSF (filgrastim) 5 mcg/kg 
SQ BID daily for four consecutive days. (doses rounded to the nearest vial size) 
Apheresis will start on the mo rning of the fifth day and proceed until sufficient cells 
have been collected.  
      Based on Spanish experience, the maternal donor will be avoided. 
 
 After collection and prior to cryopreservation, cells will be T-cell depleted using    
the Isolex  300i CD34 depletion device. The ta rget will be to obtain a product 
containing less than 1x104 CD3+ cells per kg of recipient body weight and no more 
than 3x106/kg CD34 positive cells.  The haploide ntical cells will be infused on day 
0 or day 1 according to transplant unit policy. 
 
 As of early April 2010, the Isolex 300 CD34 depletion device is no longer 
commercially available and instead we use the Miltenyi Clinimax device which 
serves a similar purpose. An IND has been  obtained that covers both the device and 
the need for all cord bloods to be  licensed or fall under an FDA IND.

17        11/19/2012 8.0    CRITERIA FOR STUDY EVALUATION 
 
 Event Free Survival 
 
Relapse will be recorded by the day of initial detection of malignant cells if these cells 
were on subsequent testing confirmed to be increasing in number. The molecular 
detection of MRD will not be taken into account  for the definition of clinical recurrence. 
The diagnosis of disease recurrence will be ba sed on clinical and pathological criteria. 
 
 Toxicity 
 
Toxicity will be scored acco rding to NCI-CTC criteria.   
 Acute GVHD will be scored according to the criteria proposed by Przepiorka et al. 
(Appendix F).
23  
 Chronic GVHD will be scored according to th e NIH Consensus Development Project on 
Criteria for Clinical Trials in Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease:  I. Diagnosis and 
Staging Working Report (A ppendix G and Appendix H).
24  
 
 Definitions of Engraftment 
 
Myeloid engraftment will be defined as th e first day in which the ANC is > 500/mm3 for 
three consecutive days.  Cytogenetic and chim erism studies will be performed to confirm 
donor origin. 
  
Platelet engraftment will be defined as th e first day the platelet count is > 20,000/mm3 
without transfusion support for seven consecutive days.  
 
Failure to engraft will be de fined as lack of ev idence of hematopoietic  recovery (ANC < 
500/mm3 and platelet count < 20,000/mm3) by day +35, confirmed by a biopsy revealing 
a marrow cellularity < 5%.  Graft failure will also be defined as initial myeloid 
engraftment by day +35, documented to be of  donor origin, followe d by a drop in the 
ANC to < 500/mm3 for more than three days, inde pendent of any myelosuppressive 
drugs, severe GVHD, CMV, or other infection.   
There may be rare cases in which the haploide ntical transplant is rejected, but the 
cord transplant engrafts with delay.  Loss of established haploi dentical engraftment 
will be considered graft failure.  
 
Graft rejection will be defined as graft failure with documentation of return of recipient hematopoiesis as determined by cyto genetic and/or chimerism studies. 
 Chimerism studies will be used to determine the percentage cord vs  haploidentical donor 
engraftment. 
IRB#:  14736B    
18        11/19/2012 9.0    STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
The primary endpoint of this tria l is the rate of e ngraftment (which is the opposite of graft 
failure).  Up to 53 patients will be enrolled in  the trial.  Graft failu re will be monitored 
using the group sequential procedure described in O’Brien and Fleming25 to test the null 
hypothesis that the graft failure ra te is < 10%, against the alternative that the rate is > 10%.  
Four interim analyses will be performed after n=10, 20, 30, and 40 patients have been 
enrolled, followed by a final analysis at n=53 us ing a simple z-test.  Fo r a one-sided test at 
the overall 0.10 alpha level, the critical  z-values are 3.50, 2.24, 1.87, 1.59, and 1.41, 
respectively.  Applying a continui ty correction, this im plies that if 5 or more of the first 10 
patients, 6 or more of the first 20, 7 or more of the first 30, or 8 or more of the first 40 
patients experience graft failure, the trial may be terminated.  The null hypothesis will also 
be rejected if, at the end of the trial, 9 or more graft failu res have occurred.  Rejection of 
the null hypothesis will indicate that the graft failure rate is  unacceptably high, i.e., the rate 
of engraftment is too low.  Th e test has 80% power if the true  graft failure rate is 20%. 
 
GVHD is the secondary endpoint, and we are partic ularly interest ed in monitoring high risk 
extensive GVHD.  We will revi ew the data after the first 5, 10, 15, and 20 patients with 
successful engraftment and without evidence of  relapse reach their 18-month landmark.  
Evidence that the rate of high-risk, extensive GVHD in this subset of patients is >40% will 
lead to consideration for early stopping.  Specifica lly, if 4 of 5, 6 of 10, 9 of 15, or 11 of 20 
such patients develop high-risk, extensive GVH D at any time prior to 18 months, we will 
consider terminating the trial.  The probab ility of having these many poor outcomes (or 
more) if the true rate of GVHD is 40% is 0.087, 0.17, 0.10, and 0.13, respectively.   
 Given the heterogeneity of the patient population included, one cannot formulate 
expectations regarding overall  survival and progression-fre e survival (PFS).  Unless the 
above described monitoring boundaries are exceede d, the protocol will continue to accrue 
until 53 patients have been enrolled.  At th e conclusion of the study, 95% confidence 
intervals will be generated for PFS, the incide nce of graft failure, and the frequency of 
active and extensive GVHD.  Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free and overall 
survival rates will be cal culated, both overall and fo r the good and high risk groups 
separately, and the median progression-free and overall survival times and their associated 
95% confidence intervals derived using the method described in Brookmeyer and 
Crowley.
26  Descriptive statistics related to the fr equency of adverse events and of changes 
in laboratory values  will be generated. 
 
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will be established to review the 
data and make recommendations regarding the c ontinuation or discontinua tion of the trial.   
 Addendum: As of March 2010, 34 patients have b een accrued to the protocol and no excess 
graft failure or GVHD have been observe d (Rich etal, ASH ab stract 3114, 2009). The 
protocol is being modified for use of th e Miltenyi column because of market supply 
reasons. But the stopping ru les  no longer apply.  
Addendum 2 as of March 2012. We will expand the number of subjects to provide more 
robust estimates of outcome. The vast majority  of subjects received fludarabine, melphalan 
IRB#:  14736B    
19        11/19/2012 conditioning for AML/MDS. Of  73 subjects en rolled so far, 60 have received fludarabine 
and melphalan reduced intensity. We recently reported our experience with the first 45 
subjects receiving reduced in tensity fludarabine melphalan (Liu, Blood 2011).  Only four 
of 45 had graft failure (lack of haplo and cord blood engraftment). The stopping rules 
indicate that if 8 or more of  the first 40 have graft failure , the trial would be stopped. 
Engraftment will continue to be monitori ed. A secondary endpoint was GVHD and the 
rates have been low and below the 40% chr onic GVHD considered for stopping the trial. 
The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV GVHD was 24% and for cGVHD 6 % at one year. 
 Since the safety of this approach has been established based on low graft failure and low GVHD, overall survival and progression free su rvival become more of  interest. One year 
overall survival was 55% and progression free -survival 42%.  The majority 29 (64%) had 
AML and MDS.  In addition, 21/45 (47%) had high risk disease defi ned as refractory, 
untreated relapse. Expanding our sample size will allow us to generate OS and PFS estimates in those by disease risk (high-ri sk versus standard/low ) and for those with 
AML/MDS.  A better estimate of efficacy is essential as future studies are now being 
planned including a randomized trial. An additional 20 subjects will accrue approximately 87 who will receive fludarabine-melphalan divi ded into 46 with low to standard risk 
disease and 41 with high-risk disease (assumi ng the proportion in the first 45 subjects is 
maintained). This will also result in en rolling approximately 55 to 56 subjects with 
AML/MDS and of those, we estimate 30 will have  low to standard risk disease. Generating 
estimates in the cohort of MDS/AML with standa rd risk disease has emerged as essential as 
this represents the most co mmon transplant indication. 
 
10.0   DATA AND PROTOCOL MANAGEMENT  
 PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE Patients will be re viewed weekly during admission by the 
study investigators who will score the patient fo r standard endpoints. After discharge they 
will be reviewed at least once a month. 
 DATA ENTRY Data must be entered into the Protocol Data Management System before 
a course of therapy can be given.  A brie f explanation for required but missing data 
should be recorded as a comment. 
 ACCURACY OF DATA COLLECTION The Study Ch airman will be th e final arbiter of 
toxicity should a difference of opinion exist. 
 
IRB#:  14736B    
20        11/19/2012 11.0   CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM PROTOCOL 
 At patient request. 
 Clinical progression. Such patients may be tr eated on other treatment protocols or at the 
investigator’s discretion. Such  patients will continue to be monitored for end-points 
relating to engraftment, GVHD and immune reconstitution. 
12.0   REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
      
 Any unexpected, life-threatening an d/or serious (grade 3 or 4)  toxicity or grade 3 or 4 
GVHD will be reported immediately to the Study Chairman.  The Chairman will be 
responsible for notifying the Surveillance Committee.   
 
 Expected toxicities are those listed in th e consent form and include regimen-related 
toxicities, myelosuppression, opportunistic in fections such as CMV reactivation, or 
GVHD.  These will not be routinely repor ted to the IRB even if they require 
admission. 
 
 On the other hand, such toxicities will be monitored by the PI and the transplant team 
and reported regularly at th e High Risk Protocol Committ ee of the Cancer Center. 
 
 All deaths that are not due to the disease recurrence will be reported to the IRB. 
 
13.0   RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW 
 
As of October 2012, we plan to retrospectively analyze the resu lts of this haplo-cord SCT 
protocol with the results of Haploidentical stem cell transplant at Peking Institute of 
Hematology in Beijing.  The analysis will focus on the AML/MDS population first. The main purpose of the analysis is to compare th e patient characteristics, pre-transplant co-
morbidities, and outcomes of transplant fr om these two centers; including neutrophil, 
platelet engraftment; progression free survival , overall survival, incidence of acute GVHD, 
and chronic GVHD et al. In a ddition, we would like to comp are the immune re-constitution 
after these two types of transplant.  The datase ts will be shared between the University of 
Chicago and the Peking institute of Hemato logy in Beijing without  identifiable patient 
information (coded), each patient will be mark ed by code without name or medical record 
number.  Both centers have IRB approval for the transplant protocol. The IRB has 
approved the Peking Institute of Hematology retrospective review.

BACKGROUND DRUG INFORMATION 
 
 
BUSULFAN 
 
AVAILABILITY 
Commercially available in 60 mg/ 10 mL ampuls. 
  
STORAGE & STABILITY 
Store ampuls under refrigeration at 2oC to 8oC.  The diluted solution is stable for up to 8 hours at room 
temperature (25oC), but the infusion must also be completed wi thin that 8-hour time frame.  Dilution of 
busulfan injection in 0.9% sodium chloride is stable for up to 12 hours under refrigeration (2oC to 8oC), 
but the infusion must also be completed within that 12-hour time frame. 
 
PREPARATION 
Dilute busulfan injection in 0.9% sodium chloride injection or dext rose 5% in water per institutional 
pharmacy guidelines.  
ADMINISTRATION 
Intravenous busulfan should be administered via a central venous catheter per institutional guidelines. 
 TOXICITY 
Severe myelosuppression with marrow ablation, alop ecia, and mild nausea/vomiting are expected.  
Alopecia may not be completely reversible.  Live r toxicity, including severe and possibly fatal veno-
occlusive disease (<5%), may occur.  Pulmonary toxicity  is rare.  Darkening of the skin may occur and 
may last several months.  Seizures may occur (<5%).  Anti-seizure prophylaxis should be administered 
per transplant guidelines.  Benzodiazepines, eg. Clonazepam (Klonopin ) 1 mg PO TID, may be used.  
Busulfan causes immunosuppression with the risk of opp ortunistic infection even after resolution of 
neutropenia.  Busulfan is expected to cause near ly universal infertility in the doses used, although men 
may occasionally father children.  Grade III mucos ities, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, hemorrhagic 
cystitis, “hand-foot syndrome” with neur opathic pain has also been reported. 
 
  
FILGRASTIM   (G-CSF:  Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor, Neupogen )   
 
AVAILABILITY 
G-CSF is commercially available in 1.0 and 1.6 mL vials containing 300 mcg and 480 mcg G-CSF, and in 
prefilled syringes containing 300 mcg/0.5 mL and 480 mcg/0.8 mL.   STORAGE & STABILITY 
Intact vials and prefilled syringes should be stored unde r refrigeration.  Do not allow the drug to freeze.  
 
ADMINISTRATION 
IRB#:  14736B    
28        11/19/2012 The daily dose of G-CSF should be injected subcutan eously in one or two sites.  The dose following 
peripheral blood stem cell infusion is 5 mcg/kg/day.   The dose of G-CSF may be rounded up to the 
nearest vial size. 
 
TOXICITY 
The most common side effect associated with G-CSF is bone pain.  Bone pain is  usually reported as mild 
or moderate and, if necessary, may be tr eated with non-opiod or opiod analgesics. 
 
 
 
FLUDARABINE (Fludara) 
      
AVAILABILITY 
Fludarabine is commercially available as a white, l yophilized powder.  Each vial contains 50 mg of 
fludarabine, 50 mg of mannitol and sodium hydroxide to adjust pH.   
 
STORAGE & STABILITY 
Intact vials should be stored under refrigeration.  Reconstituted vials are stable for 16 days at room 
temperature or under refrigeration.  Solutions diluted in D 5W or NS are stable for 48 hours at room 
temperature or under refrigeration. 
 
PREPARATION 
Fludarabine should be reconstitute d with Sterile Water for Injection, USP or normal saline per 
institutional pharmacy guidelines.    
ADMINISTRATION 
Fludarabine will be administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes.  
TOXICITY 
Myelosuppression, (dose-limiting toxicity), fever, mi ld nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, skin 
rashes, myalgia, headache, agitation, hearing lo ss, transient episodes of somnolence and fatigue, 
autoimmune hemolytic anemia (may be life-threateni ng), peripheral neuropathy, and pulmonary toxicity.  
(Both pneumonia and hypersensitivity r eactions have been reported.  Fatal pulmonary toxicity has been 
described, especially when fludarabine was used in  combination with pentostatin.  Severe, fatal CNS 
toxicity presenting with loss of vision and progressive deterioration of mental status was encountered 
almost exclusively after very high doses of fludarabine.   Such toxicity has only been rarely demonstrated 
at the 25-30 mg /m
2 dosage of fludarabine.  Very rarely described complications include transfusion-
associated graft versus host disease.  Tumor lysis synd rome has been observed, especially in patients with 
advanced bulky disease.  Opportunistic infections (pro tozoan, viral, fungal, and bacterial) have been 
observed.     
 
  
MELPHALAN (Alkeran) 
 
AVAILABILITY 
Melphalan for IV use is commercially available in sterile 50 mg vials.  The product is a lyophilized 
powder with 20 mg povidone per vial.  Also provided is  10 mL of special diluen t for use in reconstituting 
the product.  The special diluent has 0.20 g sodium c itrate, 6 mL propylene glycol, 0.5 mL 95% ethanol, 
and sterile water. 
IRB#:  14736B    
29        11/19/2012   
STORAGE & STABILITY 
Intact vials should be stored at room temperature (15oC-30oC) and protected from light.  Reconstituted 
solutions are chemically and physically stable for at least 90 minutes at room temperature.  Solutions 
further diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride to a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 0.45 mg/mL are stable for at least 60 minutes.  Solutions diluted to 1 mg/mL are reporte d to be physically stable for at least 4 hours at 
room temperature-chemical stability of this dilution is not known.  Because of the relative instability of 
melphalan solutions, it is recommended that administra tion of the diluted solution be completed within 60 
minutes of reconstitution.  Reconstituted so lutions should not be refrigerated. 
 
PREPARATION 
Melphalan should be prepared immediately before intende d use.  Each vial is reconstituted with 10 mL of 
the special diluent to yield a concentration of 5 mg /mL.  The reconstituted solution may be diluted with 
0.9% sodium chloride to a concentra tion of 0.1 mg/mL to 0.45 mg/mL.   
 
ADMINISTRATION 
The total dose of melphalan will be administered by short IV infusion over 30-60 minutes, as per 
institutional pharmacy guidelines.  TOXICITY 
The major toxicity of melphalan is bone marrow suppressi on, usually lasting four to eight weeks.  Other 
toxicities include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis.  Less common toxicities include pulmonary 
fibrosis, interstitial pneumonitis, vascul itis, alopecia, hemolytic anemia, and allergic reactions.  Transient 
rises in BUN and creatinine have occurred with high dose melphalan and also acute renal failure. Tissue 
necrosis may result if infiltration occurs.

and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. 
 
ADMINISTRATION 
Oral therapy should be started as soon as possibl e as per protocol and 8 to 12 hours after stopping 
intravenous therapy.  Oral doses will be administer ed twice a day.  The conversion from IV to oral 
therapy should take into account concom itant medications (such as voriconazole). 
 
TOXICITY 
In patients receiving tacrolimus, 5% to 47% experi enced anemia, 8% to 32% experienced leukocytosis, 
and 14% to 24% experienced thrombocytopenia.  Rare  cases of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia have 
been reported.  Chest pain was reported in 19%.  Mild to moderate hypertension is a common adverse 
effect associated with tacrolimus therapy.  Antihy pertensive therapy may be required.  The most common 
adverse effects of tacrolimus have involved the cen tral nervous system, and include headache (37% to 
64%), tremors (48% to 56%), insomnia (32% to 64%),  paresthesia (17% to 40%), and dizziness (19%).  
Tremor and headache may respond to dosage reduction.  Visual changes, agitation, anxiety, confusion, 
seizures, depression, hallucinations, myoclonus, neur opathy, psychosis, incoordination, and abnormal 
dreams have been reported in 3% to 15%.  Hype rkalemia (13% to 45%), hypokalemia (13% to 29%) 
hypophosphatemia (49%) and hypomagnesemia (16% to  48%) have been associated with tacrolimus 
therapy.  Hyperuricemia has been reported in >3%.  Gastrointestin al adverse effects included nausea 
(32% to 46%), vomiting (14% to 29%), anorexia (7% to 34%), constipation (23% to 35%), and diarrhea 
(37% to 72%).  Nephrotoxicity was reported in 38% to 52% of liver and kidney transplant patients, 
respectively.  Hematuria h as been reported in greater than 3%.  Abnormal liver function tests have been 
reported in 6% to 36% of patients; ascites in 7% to 27%.    Other effects reported in clinical trials include pain, fever, asthenia, back pain, and peripheral edema.  The 
incidence of hyperglycemia was 17% and may requi re therapy with insulin.  Other less frequently 
occurring effects include abscess, chills, peritonitis, a nd photosensitivity reactions.  Anaphylaxis has been 
reported in a few patients receiving intravenous tacrolimus.  T acrolimus injection contains cremophor 
which in other drugs has been associated with  anaphylaxis.  Because tacrolimus is an 
immunosuppressant, the risk of opportunistic infections is increased.      
IRB#:  14736B    
32        11/19/2012 DRUG INTERACTIONS   
Tacrolimus is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4.  Drugs that are inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole) of 
inducers (e.g. phenytoin) of 3A4 might be expected to increase or decrease tacrolimus concentrations, 
respectively, possibly resulting in increased or decreased effects.

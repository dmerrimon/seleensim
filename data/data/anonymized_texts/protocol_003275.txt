2.1 NAME AND INTENDED USE OF THE DEVICE   
 
Device Classification  & Generic Name:  Class III; Total Disc Replacement  
 
Device Trade Name : Simplify ® Cervical Artificial Disc  
 
Indication:  Simplify ® Cervical Artificial  Disc is indic ated for use in skeletally mature patients for 
reconstruction of the disc at one or two level s from C3 -C7 following discectomy for 
intractable radiculopathy (arm pain and/or a neurological deficit) with or without neck 
pain, or myelopathy due to abnormalit y localized to the disc space and manifested by at 
least one of the following conditions confirmed by radiographic imaging (e.g., X -rays, 
computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)): herniated nucleus 
pulposus, spondylosis (defined by the p resence of osteophytes), and/or visible loss of 
disc height as compared to adjacent levels. Patients receiving Simplify ® Cervical 
Artificial  Disc should have failed at least six weeks of non -operative treatment or 
demonstrated  progressive signs or symptoms  despite nonoperative treatment  prior to 
implantation.  Simplify ® Cervical Artificial  Disc is implanted via an open anterior 
approach.  
  
2.2 PURPOSE OF STUDY  
This study is intended to demonstrate the 5-year long-term safety and efficacy of the Simplify ® 
Cervic al Artificial Disc ( “Simplify Disc ”) in subjects enrolled in the non -randomized two-level 
Simplify Disc IDE study .  This study was conducted under IDE G1 50206 . 
2.2.1  DESCRIPTION OF DEVICE  
 
The Simplify Disc is a cervical artificial disc manufactured from PEEK en dplates and a mobile, 
zirconia -toughened alumina ceramic core. The PEEK endplates have a plasma -sprayed titanium 
coating. The articulating surfaces on the endplates have a concave surface and the core has two 
convex surfaces.

Figure 1. Representative Image of Simplify Disc  
For the Simplify Disc family, two core options (i.e., either small or large) are used for all assemblies. 
The articulating features of superior and inferior endplates are identical and congruent with the 
approp riate core. Superior and inferior endplates are available in three footprints, three thicknesses, 
and two lordosis angles. The superior endplates have a retention ring feature. All endplates are 
titanium coated on the bone interfacing surfaces, with two op tions available for coating thickness. All 
endplate components, regardless of configuration, have identical manufacturing process flow, 
including packaging and sterilization.  
 
The Simplify Disc is designed to provide a theoretical maximum of ± 12° in any c ombination of 
flexion -extension and lateral bending, unlimited axial rotation, and 1 -2 mm translation. This range is 
intended to permit the patient’s anatomy to determine actual range of motion without imposing an 
artificial limit that may be restrictive t o the patient’s kinematic profile. The maximum range of 
motion in vivo will be dictated by the patient’s anatomical boundaries or the device limits, whichever 
is smaller.  
2.3  PROTOCOL STUDY CONDUCT  
2.3.1  STUDY OBJECTIVE  
The objective of this clinical study is to e valuate the 5 year long-term safety and effectiveness of the 
two-level Simplify  Disc compared to conventional anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (“ ACDF ”) 
in skeletally mature patients for reconstruction of two contiguous discs from C3 to C7 following 
discectomy at two contiguous levels for intractable radiculopathy (arm pain and/or a neurological 
deficit) with neck pain or myelopathy due to abnormalit ies localized to the level s of the two 
contiguous disc space s that are unresponsive to conservative man agement.

Version Date June 14 , 2021  00000 7 2.3.2  STUDY HYPOTHESIS  
The study hypothesis is that in subjects with  intractable radiculo pathy (arm pain and/or a neurological 
deficit) with neck pain or myelopathy due to abnormalit ies localized to the level s of the two 
contiguous disc space s at two c ontiguous discs  level s from C3 to C7 that are unresponsive to 
conservative management, the Month 60  composite clinical success  (CCS)  rate of the Simplify  Disc 
will be no worse than conventional ACDF . Individual success for Simpl ify Disc and the historical 
control ACDF is defined as follows:  
 Neck Disability Index (NDI) score improvement of at least 15 points from pre -operative;  
 Maintenance or improvement in neurological status;  
 No serious adverse event classified as implant associated or implant/surgical pro cedure 
associated; and  
 No additional surgical procedure classified as a “failure.”  
 
2.3.3   STUDY DESCRIPTION  
This is a prospective, multi -center post -approval study  (PAS)  evaluating subjects in the non -
randomized two level Simplify Disc IDE study compared to ACDF subjects in a non -concurrent 
historical control  .  The historical control population will only include the subjects 
who were selected  using a PS model developed  in the two level Simplify Disc IDE study  and 
reviewed by FDA in the approve d PMA  to establish comparability between the study populations.  
 
2.3.4  STUDY POPULATION  
This will include up to 1 70 subjects eligible for study enrollment from sixteen (16) sites in the two 
level Simplify Disc IDE study who consent to long -term follow -up.  Addit ionally, up to 1 7 training 
subjects from the two level Simplify Disc IDE study from seven teen (17) sites will be enrolled.  Up to 
151 historical ACDF control subjects will be included in the PAS population.  The final number of 
included ACDF subjects is not  yet known as CEC adjudications are on going of the post month 24 
data.   
2.3.4.1  INCLUSION CRITERIA  
All subjects enrolled in the two level Simplify Disc IDE study  are considered for this long -term 
follow -up study.

2.3.5  STUDY DESIGN  
2.3.5.1  OVERALL STUDY DESIGN 
This is a prospective, multi -center post -approval study  to evaluat e the  5-year long term safety and 
effectiveness of the Simplify Disc  at two levels .  The historical control population will only include 
the fusion subjects who were selected  using a PS model developed in the two level Simplify Disc IDE 
study  and approved PMA . The Simplify Disc data from the training subjects  will be summarized 
separately and not used in the primary comparison to control.  Study subjects will be evaluated 
annually  (± 2 months  for the 36 -month visit and ± 3 months for the 48 - and 60 -month visits ) for 
componen ts of the primary endpoint , secondary study endpoints  and safety up through 5 -year post -
implantation.  Fusion  (control)  subjects were not evaluated at the 48 -month visit.  Primary study  
success will be evaluated at the 5 -year timepoint.  
2.3.6  STUDY PROCEDURES  
2.3.6.1  INFORMED CONSENT

2.3.6.2.3  Study Completion, Termination or Loss to Follow -up 
Simpliy Disc s ubjects are expected to remain in the study until the 60  months post implantation 
assessment.  The study completion/ termination  evaluation will be made at the 60 months assessment , 
or at earlier time point if the subject withdraws or is withdrawn from the study.  
 
Subjects may be withdrawn from a clinical study early due to withdrawal of Informed Consent, loss 
to follow -up, or Investigator medical decision .  Any premature termination from the study will be 
documented, including the primary reason for withdrawal.  In the event of a secondary index surgery 
requiring removal of a spinal system, every effort will be made to retrieve the  explanted device for 
analysis.  The instructions for the surgical technique for device removal  of the Simplify Disc  are 
included in the Study Manuals.   Any subjects with a device removal of the Simplify Disc or who have 
any other secondary index surgery will be discontinued from the study after the next follow -up stu dy 
visit.

2.3.7  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
2.3.7.1  PRIMARY ENDPOINT  
The study hypothesis is that in subjects with  intractable radiculo pathy (arm pain and/or a neurological 
deficit) with neck pain or myelop athy due to abnormalit ies localized to the level s of the two 
contiguous disc space s at two contiguous  level s from C3 to C7 that is unresponsive to conservative 
management, the Month 60 composite clinical success (CCS) rate of the Simplify Disc will be no 
worse than conventional ACDF when success of ACDF is evaluated at Month 60.  Individual success 
for Simpl ify Disc and the historical control ACDF is defined as follows:  
 Neck Disability Index (NDI) score improvement of at least 15 points from pre -operative;  
 Maintenance or improvement in neurological status1; 
 No serious adverse event classified as implant associated or implant/surgical procedure 
associated; and  
 No additional surgical procedure classified as a “failure.”  
 
Overall success will be determined bas ed on data collected during the  36 months to  60 months of 
follow -up.  Each element of the neurological study exam will be evaluated for maintenance or 
improvement.   
 
All secondary index surgeries will be classified as failures.  
 
Per FDA Guidance for the P reparation of IDEs for Spinal Systems, the following definitions apply  for 
the PAS : 
 Reoperation - any surgical procedure at the index level(s) that does not involve  modification, 
addition or removal of any components of the device and is not considered a r emoval, 
revision, or supplemental fixation.  
                                                      
 
1 Maintenance or improvement in neurological status will be based on motor, sensory, and myelopathic gait 
assessments.

Version Date June 14 , 2021   00000 13  Revision – any procedure in the postoperative or follow -up period that adjusts or in any way 
modifies either one or both of the original implant configurations (e.g., adjusting the position 
of the original config uration, removal with replacement with same type of study implant).  
 Removal – a procedure that removes one or more components of the original implant 
configuration without replacement with the same type of trial implant.  
 Supplemental fixation – a procedure  at the index level(s) in which additional spinal devices 
not approved as part of the protocol are placed.   
Other – any additional surgical procedure not classified as a removal, revision, supplemental fixation, 
or reoperation.  
2.3.7.2  STUDY SUCCESS  
The null hypot hesis is that the probability of achieving Month 60 composite clinical success (CCS) 
for patients implanted with the Simplify Disc device at two levels is no more than 0.10 smaller than 
the probability of ACDF control patients achieving Month 60 CCS.  This study will be considered a 
success if the PS-quintile adjusted , multiple imputation based,  1-sided p -value for rejecting this null 
hypothesis is less than or equal to 0.05.  
2.3.7.3  DESIGN OF THE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY 
Two hundred (200)  subjects were enrolled in the  two level  Simplify Disc IDE population. Of these, 
18 Simplify Disc subjects were training subjects. The historical ACDF control population included 
 subjects. The  available subjects ( 182 Simplify Disc (excluding training subjects) and  
historical  ACDF control) were assessed via the Propensity Score (PS) sub -classification process. 
After applying an established heuristic for 3 iterations (6 models), a total of 1 82 Simplify Disc and 
170 historical ACDF control subjects were retained in the final PS designed sample. Analysis of 
subject demographic and baseline data showed no meaningful differences between the treatment 
groups. The PS -selected population and PS sub classes defined in the IDE study  G150206  will be 
utilized for the purposes of this study . Per the exclusion criteria, additional subjects are not enrolled 
into the PAS due to reasons that preclude long -term Simplify Disc data collection (e.g., SSI).  
 
2.3.7.4  JUSTIFICATION OF CONTROL AND EXPIRMENTAL GROUP SUCCESS RATES 
Based on multiple imputation and  including N=1 82 Simplify  Disc subjects and N=1 70 historical 
controls, the Month 24 PS adjusted success rates were estimated to be 86.7% and 7 7.1%, respectively, 

NuVasive , Inc                              Post Approval Study Protocol              Confidential  
Version Date June 14 , 2021   00000 14 for a group difference of 9.6% (90% LB CI 2.1%). The lower bound of the 90% 2 -sided CI is 
equivalent to the lower bound of the 95% 1 -sided non -inferiority CI. In the completer’s analysis set, 
153 of 173 Simplify  Disc subjects achieved Month 24 overall success, and 105 of 145 Controls 
achieved Month 24 overall success.  
2.3.7.5  SAMPLE SIZE ANALYSIS  
For the purposes of sample size calculation, it is estimated that 85% of the estimated 170 Simplify  
Disc subjects (N=1 45) who are not terminal failures or lost to follow -up will be available at year 5. It 
is estimated that 70% of the estimated 151 (N=106) Control subjects who are not terminal failures 
(defined as SSI or Intra -op deviation) or died , will be available at year 5.  This calculation reviewed 
the available NDI scores at month 60 among the 151 subjects who were not known to already be not 
included. It is e xpected that this number will be not be exact due to on going safety adjudication by 
the CEC.   
 
Based on these results, it was conservatively estimated that the 5 -year overall success rates would be 
70% of the observed rates, that is, 6 2% and 5 4% for Simpl ify Disc and historical ACDF  control , 
respectively. If the success rates in both groups are larger, statistical power will be larger and so this 
power analysis would be conservative. With sample sizes of 1 45 and 106 and assuming 6 2% and 54% 
success, the po wer to detect non -inferiority is 89% at a one -sided 0.05 significance level.   
 
2.3.7.6  SUPERIORITY TESTING  
If the non -inferiority study success criterion is met, superiority testing will be performed in the 
primary  analysis set.  It will be concluded that the Simp lify Disc is superior to the ACDF control if 
the PS-quintile adjusted one -sided p -value determined from the multiple imputation is less than 0.05.  
2.3.7.7  ADDRESSING MISSING PRIMARY OUTCOME DATA 
Because of the availability of subject level data in controls that co rrespond to the subject level data to 
be collected in the prospective study, missing data will be addressed in the same fashion to how 
missing data would have been addressed in a randomized clinical trial. Multiple imputation will be 
used to impute missing  final NDI in patients otherwise evaluable for primary CCS. For each of 20 
imputed data sets, the primary PS stratified device group difference will be made resulting in a 
standard error for each.  The final device group difference will be the average of t he multiple imputed 
datasets and its standard error will account for both within (usual) and between imputation error.

In addition to multiple imputation, sensitivity analysis will be provided based on tipping point 
analyses. These are analyses in which  all possible combinations of successes and failures are assumed 
for patients missing primary CCS and the fraction of scenarios in which the statistical conclusion 
changes is summarized. Best case and worst case, all missing success, and all missing failur es 
scenarios will also be summarized .   
 
2.3.7.8  ANALYSIS OF SECONDARY ENDPOINTS  AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
Secondary effectiveness endpoints will be compared between groups over time using PS-adjusted 
group differences and 95% PS-adjusted confidence intervals for group d ifferences.  Should the 
number of events be too small or zero for one group, the undjusted group specific rate will only be 
provided as was done in the 2 -level PMA.  Adverse events will be summarized by event counts and 
per subject incidence rates for catego ries of AE, for specific AEs, by relationship to device and 
procedure, and for SAEs. Counts will also be summarized by  time of onset category and by AE 
severity. Where applicable, AE summary tables will include 95% confidence intervals for group 
difference s in incidence rates.  
For each study group and for important subgroups separately, the primary outcome (i.e., patient 
success) and secondary endpoints, as well as the incidence of specific complications, will be tabulated 
and presented by follow -up interva l.  Comprehensive tables will provide frequency and percentage 
distributions and descriptive statistics as appropriate in total and for each study group separately.   
Survival analysis methods will be used to describe time to event outcomes including time to 
secondary surgical intervention.  
2.3.7.8.1  Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints include:  
 Clinically significant improvement in one or more radicular symptoms or myelopathy at each 
annual timepoint  compared to baseline  in the IDE study  for the two level Simplif y Disc and 
for the historical control ACDF.  The data collected will reflect the number of patients who 
improved (numbers will be stratified to reflect clinical improvement), who remain 
unchanged, and who deteriorated at each study time point.  These endpo ints will be graded 
and defined as follows:  
o Pain questionnaires will be used to evaluate each of the following pain locations:

 Arm pain  
 Left arm pain (investigational group only);  
 Right arm pain (investigational group only);  
o Motor status - A chan ge of one or more grade levels in muscle strength will be 
regarded as clinically significant.  
o Sensory status - Sensation will be graded as normal or abnormal (diminished or 
absent).  Any changes from abnormal to normal or absent to diminished will be 
regar ded as clinically significant improvement.2. 
 Time to recovery defined as the earliest time at which a minimum 15 -point (out of 100) NDI 
improvement is reached.  
 Disc height at each annual timepoint  compared to baseline  (6 weeks) in the IDE study  for the 
two level Simplify Disc. Both levels had to be a disc height success to claim success for 
overall disc height. Disc height success for each level is based on either the anterior or 
posterior measurements meet the following criterions:  
o Post-operative Height – 6 Week Post -operative Height ≥ -2 mm  
 Adjacent level deterioration at each annual timepoint compared to baseline  in the 
investigational group of the IDE study  for the two level Simplify Disc.  
 Displacement or migration of the device  for the investigational gr oup; only changes of > 
3 mm will be considered significant due to the margin of error in radiographic determination 
of displacement distances.  
 Return to work status post -operatively.  
 Patient satisfaction and perceived effect at each annual timepoint . Succe ss for each 
satisfaction question (three) will be defined as either a “Definitely True” or “Mostly True” 
response. Success for the perceived effect will be defined as either a “Completely 
Recovered,” “Much Improved,” or “Slightly Improved” response.  
 Healt h Survey (SF -36) at each annual timepoint  compared to baseline.  Success will be 
expressed in terms of the PCS (physical component summary) and MCS (mental component 
summary) scores and will be defined as a maintenance or improvement in status post -

device related will require d etailed reporting on the appropriate case report form.    
2.3.8  SAFETY ASSESSMENT  
2.3.8.1  ADVERSE EVENTS  
An adverse event is defined as any clinically adverse sign, symptom, syndrome, or illness that occurs 
or worsens  during the operative and postoperative periods of th e trial, regardless of causality, that is 
not otherwise being measured in the trial. Adverse events, whether or not device related, must be 
reported on the appropriate case report form. . Any adverse event that occurred prior to treatment with 
the medical device will be documented in the patient’s pre -operative medical history  in the two level 
Simplify Disc study .  Only adverse events which occurred in the Month 36 through Month 60 visits 
or are continuing from the two level Simplify Disc  IDE study  or are new or have worsened during the 
course of this study will be evaluated in the safety assessment.  
 
Analysis of adverse events will be conducted using the methods specified in section 2.3.7.8 . 
 
2.3.8.2  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S  
2.3.8.2.1  Description  
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  is an adverse event which : 
1. Led to a death,  
2. Resulted in life threatening illness or injury,  
NOTE: the term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the patient was at a 
risk of death at the time of the even t; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
3. Resulted in subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
4. Resulted in subject disability or permanent damage or required interventi on to  
       prevent permanent impairment/damage.

Version Date June 14 , 2021   00000 20 2.3.8.3  UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECTS    
2.3.8.3.1  Description   
An Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  (UADE)  is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or 
any life threatening problem or death caused by, or  associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, 
or death is not identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in this Protocol; or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare  of 
the subjects.  
2.3.8.3.2  Reporting  
Adverse event information will be collected on all subjects.  At each subject encounter, the 
investigator will determine if there has been an AE since the last encounter and if any previous AE’s 
are ongoing or have resolved.  Al l adverse events must be reported on the Adverse Event Form.    
 
If an Investigator is unsure about whether to report a finding as an adverse event, s/he should report 
the event on the AE form.   
 
SAEs  and UADEs  must be reported to the Sponsor , as soon as possible, but in no event later than 10 
working days after the Investigator first learns of the event . SAEs and UADEs must also be reported 
to the approving IRB per the IRB’s reporting requirements.  
2.3.8.4  POTENTIAL RELATIONSHIP OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
The CEC will be asked to assess the potential relationship of the adverse event to the implanted 
device and to the procedure and classify the causality of the event according to the following 
definitions.  
 Implant -associated: An AE for which there is a reasonable possibili ty that the event may have 
been caused primarily by the implant(s).  
 Surgical procedure -associated:  An AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
event may have been caused primarily by the surgical procedure.  
 Implant/Surgical procedure -associ ated:  An AE for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the event may have been caused both by the implant(s) and surgical procedure.  
 Not Related: An AE for which sufficient information exists to indicate that the etiology is 
unrelated to the implant (s) or surgical procedure.

Version Date June 14 , 2021   00000 21  Undetermined: An AE for which sufficient information is not available at the time of the 
event to determine its causality.  
2.3.8.5  ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY  
The CEC will use the following terms for assessment of severity:  
 Mild (grade 1): Th e AE is noticeable to the patient, but does not interfere with routine 
activity.  The AE does not require removal of the implant(s).  
 Moderate (grade 2): The AE interferes with routine activities of the patient, but responds to 
symptomatic therapy or rest.  The AE does not require removal of the implant(s).  
 Severe (grade 3): The AE significantly limits the patient’s ability to perform routine activities 
despite symptomatic therapy and may require hospitalization.  In addition, the AE may 
require removal of t he implant(s).  
 Life-Threatening (grade 4): The AE requires removal of the implant(s), or the patient is at 
immediate risk of death, even if not related to the implant(s).  
2.3.8.6  CLINICAL EVENTS COMMITTEE  
The Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will adjudicate all rep orted adverse events. This will include 
all SAEs, including secondary surgeries at the index and adjacent levels, primary endpoint failure, 
and neurologic deterioration.  
The CEC may determine neurologic status has declined at 60 months compared to baselin e based on 
changes including:  
 Motor Assessment: shift from baseline.  
 Sensory Examination: shift from normal to absent or impaired; impaired to absent.  
 Myelopathic Gait Abnormality Class: any worsening.  
The CEC will also review all UADEs.  Adverse events wi ll be classified by the CEC based on 
seriousness, relationship to device and procedure, and severity .  The CEC will also adjudicate 
protocol deviations.  The CEC will consist of three members with related expertise in spine surgery or 
neurosurgery, with th e option for one position to be filled by a radiologist,  who are not affiliated with 
the Sponsor or who are not participating in the study.  The recommendations of the CEC and become 
part of the clinical trial data set.

Version Date June 14 , 2021   00000 22 2.4 RISK ANALYSIS  
2.4.1  RISKS 
No physical risk s are anticipated as a result of participation in the long -term follow -up study. The 
amount of radiation exposure to subjects is relatively small.  
 
Subjects may require additional surgery at the treated spinal level:  
 Reoperation - any surgical procedure a t the index level(s) that does not involve  modification, 
addition or removal of any components of the device and is not considered a removal, 
revision, or supplemental fixation.  
 Revision – any procedure in the postoperative or follow -up period that adjusts  or in any way 
modifies either one or both of the original implant configurations (e.g., adjusting the position 
of the original configuration, removal with replacement with same type of study implant).  
 Removal – a procedure that removes one or more compone nts of the original implant 
configuration without replacement with the same type of trial implant.  
 Supplemental fixation – a procedure at the index level(s) in which additional spinal devices 
not approved as part of the protocol are placed.   
 Other – any ad ditional surgical procedure not classified as a removal, revision, supplemental 
fixation, or reoperation.  
 
 Risks associated with the use of both the Simplify Disc and control spinal systems are expected to be 
comparable.  All secondary index surgeries wil l be regarded as failures and reported accordingly.  
   
2.5 STUDY MONITORING

Title of Study:  
A Phase 1 Dose- Escalation Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of LAM-002A 
(apilimod dimesylat e capsules) Administered Orall y in Subjects with Relapsed or Refrac tory 
B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma 
Study Center(s):  
Dose Escalation Stage : Up to ~10 US sites are planned 
Expansion Stage: ~15 US sites are planned 
Extension Stage: Up to 2 US sites are planned  
Objectives:  
The overall purpose of this Phase 1 study is to explore the safety and tolerability of 
LAM-002A when given alone and in combination for the treatment of subjects with relapsed 
or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (N HL).  
Primary:  
• To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of daily oral adminis tration of LAM-
002A in subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). 
Secondary: 
• To evaluate the plasma pharmacok inetics (PK) of apilimod, and its active metabolite s, 
administered orally in subjects with relapsed or refractory NHL. 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of daily oral administration of LAM-002A in 
subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL. 
• To evaluate the preliminary  anti-tumor activity of LAM-002A. LAM-002A-NHL-CLN01

AI Therapeutics Confiden tial and Proprietary Page 6 of 312 Exploratory: 
• To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of LAM -002A, administered orally, in plasma 
assays and surrogate ti ssue (gene expression in peripheral blood mo nonuclear cells 
[PBMCs]/B cells and plasma cytokines [including (IL)-12 a nd IL-23]).  
• To evaluate tumor and/or plasma for gene expression and genetic alt erations (with saliva 
or B-cell-depleted PBMC collection for germ-line control) and surrogate tissue 
(PBMC/B cells) for gene expression tha t may predict anti-lymphoma activity. 
• To evaluate plasma for changes in analytes or tumor for protein expression that may 
predict anti-lymphoma activity . 
Methodology:  
This is a Phase 1, single–arm, open-label, dose- escalation and cohort-expansion study 
evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodyn amics, and antitumor activity of 
LAM-002A administered orally in s ubjects with relapsed or refractory B -cell NHL. The 
study consists of 3 stages, a dose-escalation stage, an expansion stage, and an extension 
stage.  
In the dose-escalation stage (Stage 1), a 3 + 3 design w ill be utilized to define an MTD of 
LAM-002A, first when administered continuously and then when admini stered 
intermittently. Cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will be sequentially enrolled at progress ively higher 
starting dose levels of LAM-002A, as indicated in Table S-1. The initial cohort of subjects 
will be prescribed  LAM-002A at Dose Level 0 (50 mg twice per d ay [BID]). Dose level -1 
(25 mg BID) is provided to permit a dose decrement in subjects experiencing DLT at 
Dose Level 0.

AI Therapeutics Confiden tial and Proprietary Page 7 of 312 For each cohort of 3 subj ects in the continuous and interm ittent administration appro aches, 
dose escalation to the next higher dose may proceed if no dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) is 
observed within the first cycle of the 3 subjects accrued to a cohort. If 1 of 3 subjects in the 
cohort experiences a DLT, up to a total of 6 s ubjects will be enrolled. If 2 or more of the 3-6 
subjects in a cohort experience a DLT, dose escalat ion will cease, and additional subjects 
will be treated at a lower dose level or with another schedule. If de-e scalation to the previous 
dose cohort is und ertaken, this co hort will be expanded to ≥6 subjects. Additional subjects 
(up to 12 total per cohort) may be evaluated to refine the estimation of the MTD and RP2D a t 
the planned dose levels or at an intermediate dose level between the h ighest previously 
tolerated total dose and the next planned total daily dose. The MTD is de fined as the highest 
dose at which < 33% of subjects experiences a DLT in the total dose  and schedule cohort. 
The investigators and sponsor will review available data including t oxicity, PK and anti-
tumor activity data to rea ch consensus on dose levels and determination of the MTDs with 
continuous and intermittent dosing. 
Once the MTD and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D and schedule is deter mined, the 
study will enter the expansion stage (Stage 2), in which cohorts of subjec ts will be accrued in 
order to obtain additional information on safety, tolerability, preliminar y anti-tumor activity, 
PK, and pharmacodynamic data at the RP2D and schedule when LAM-002A is admini stered 
alone or in combination with rituximab /rituximab hyal uronidase human or atezolizumab. 
Expansion-stage cohorts will comprise groups of subjects with specific  types of previously 
treated, relapsed, progressive, and measurable NHL who will receive LAM-002A 
monotherapy or LAM-002A-containing combination therapy as shown in Table S-2. For 
both monotherapy and combination cohorts, the starting dose of LAM-002A will be  125 mg 
BID administered continuously.

data cutoff date may  electively continue their current regimen of study therapy in Stage 3, 
receiving clinical care and diagnostic testing consistent with c onventional practice  standards 
as deemed appropriate by the trea ting investigator. Therapy in Stage 3 may continue in the 
absence of protocol- defined reasons to discontinue therapy. During Stage 3, collection of 
clinical data by the sponsor will be limited t o serious adverse event (SAE) reports. Study 
drug accountability will be managed per site procedu res; relevant pharmacy records may be 
collected by the sponsor to document study drug disposition.  
Each subject’s course on study will consist of the following periods: 
• Pre-Treatment Period : The subject is consent ed and undergoes screening assessmen ts to 
be qualified for the study. 
• Treatment Period : The subject is  treated, monitored for safety (including assessments of 
adverse events [AEs], vital signs, electro cardiograms [ECGs], laboratory tests and 
concomitant me dications), and PK and biomarker samples are collected.  
• Post-Treatment Period : Subjects should be followed until the later of eithe r 30 days after 
the last dose of study tre atment or until resolution/ stabilization of any ongoing drug-
related AEs and/or SAEs. For subj ects with events that require follow-up, information 
regarding concomitant medications should be colle cted. Any necessar y follow-up may be 
obtained in person or by telephone contact.  
Subjects who have discontinued study treatment for reasons other than pr ogressive disease 
(PD) will be assessed per standard response criteria for NHL or chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL ) at a minimum o f every 12 weeks until 
documentation of PD, start of new anti-cancer therapy or for up to 1 ye ar from the last 
enrolled subject’s first treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1), whichever comes first.  
Long-term follow-up surviva l information will be obtained in all surv iving subjects who 
permanently discontinue study therapy. Such information may be collected at ~3- to 6-month 
intervals at the spo nsor’s discretion through 3 years. This long- term follow-up information 
will be gathered during routine clinic visits, other s tudy site contact with the subjects, or via 
telephone or e- mail with the subjects/caregivers o r referring physician offices. 
Number of Subjects (planned): 
As many as 145 future subjects may be enrolled, assuming t hat: 
• In the dose-escalation stage of the s tudy, the total number of subjects will depend upon 
the numbers of subjects accrued to each do se level and the number of dose leve ls 
evaluated. If 6 subjects are enrolled at all open starting dose levels (Dose Levels 5, 6, 7, 
and 8) and 6 additional subjec ts are enrolled at the MTD or RP2D, as many as 30 
subjects could be enrolled. To allow for the possibi lity that some subjects may not be 
fully evaluable for DLT or that an intermediate dose level might be evaluated, up to 
~45 subjects may be enrolled.  
• In the expansion stage of the study, if all 8 potential expansion cohorts are accrued, as 
many as ~76 subjects could be enrolled. To allow for the possibility that some sub jects 
may not be fully evaluable for efficacy  or to establish bounds on efficacy estima tes with Clinical Study Report

For subjects allocat ed to LAM-002A/atezolizumab, the a tezolizumab will be administered 
intravenously in the clinic at a dose of 1200 mg every 3 weeks. 
Duration of T reatment:  
Subjects may continue to receive study therapy until the earliest of subject withdrawal of 
informed consent, documented progression of cancer while on therapy, unacceptable study-
drug-related toxicity despite appropriate dose modification, development of i ntercurrent 
illness that precludes continued study therapy, physician decision that continuatio n is not in 
the subject’s best interest , treatment of th e cancer with another therap eutic regimen, 
pregnancy or breastfeeding, substantial noncompliance with study procedures, or  study 
discontinuation. If medically appropriate, sub jects allocated to combin ation therapy may 
continue with protocol- specified thera py for the therapeutic agent  (LAM-002A, rituximab, or 
atezolizumab) that continues to be tolerated, even if the other agent  need to be discontinued 
due to drug-specific toxicity. 
Criteria for Evaluation: 
Safety: 
Safety evaluations will include assessments  of AEs, vital signs, ECGs, laboratory tests, and 
concomitant medications. Adverse event seriousness, severity grade, and r elationship to 
study treatment will be assessed by t he investigator. Severity grade will be defined using the 
National Cancer Institu te (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 4.0. 
Pharmacokinetics:  
PK assessments (for apilimod and circulating active met abolites) on Cycle Day 1, Cycle 
1 Day 8, and Cycle 1 Day 15 will determine PK parameters that will be estimated using 
standard non-compartmental method s. Dose proportionality and drug accumulation will be 
assessed. 
Pharmacodynamics: 
Pharmacodynamic evaluat ions will explore the e xtent of PIKfyve in hibition as determined b y 
plasma assays, changes in gene expression in PBMCs /B cells, changes in plasma cytok ines 
(including IL-12 and IL-23), correlations between genetic alterations a s determined by next 
generation sequencing and/or gene expression in tumor tissue, plasma or PBMCs/B-cells and 
anti-lymphoma activity following treatment with LAM -002A, and correlations between 
changes in plasma bioanalytes and anti cancer activity following treatment with LAM -002A 
as determined by proteom ic tools. 
Efficacy:  
Efficacy will be determined base d on standard definitions of response and progression for 
NHL and CLL/SLL. Rates of response and time-to-event parameters will be calculated.  Clinical Study Report

Analysis Sets: 
Appropriate data analys is sets will be defined. The full-analysis set will include data from all 
patients who receive ≥1 dose of study therap y. Other analysis sets (responder and evaluable 
analysis sets) will be defined, as appropriate, and will include dat a from patients who ha ve 
the necessary base line and on study measurements t o provide interpretable results for specific 
parameters of interest.  
Patient Disposition and Baseline Cha racteristics:  
Based on the full-analysis set, information regarding patient dispositi on, demographics, 
disease history, tumor characteristics, and oth er baseline characteristics will be described.  
Study Drug Exposure, Concomitant Medications, and S afety:  
Study drug administration and compliance, concomitant medication use, AEs, laboratory 
abnormalities, vital signs, performance status, body weight, and ECOG performa nce status 
will be described and summarized. For safety analyses, AEs will be classified using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The sever ity of AEs will be graded 
by the investigator according to the CTCAE, Version 4.03. Standard regulatory definitions of 
seriousness will be applied to AEs. Laboratory abnormalities will be graded according to 
CTCAE severity grade. Concomitant medication use will be coded using the  World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary into Anatomic al Therapeutic-Chemical classification (ATC) 
codes. Quantitative and qualitative ECG assessments of rhythm abnorma lities, cardiac 
intervals, wave form abnormalities, and ectopy will be reported. 
Pharmac okinetics:  
Noncompartmental methods will be used to de rive pharmacokinetic parameters. Drug and 
metabolite concentrations and derived pharmacokinetic parameters will be described  and will 
be summarized using appropriate graphical and tabular methods. The r elationship between 
the parameters of drug exposure and dose may be examined using the power model or similar 
regression techniques. Drug accumulation over time will be described. 
Pharmacodynamics:  
Pharmacodynamic measures will be liste d and will be summar ized using appropriate 
graphical and tabular methods. As appropriat e, statistical analysis of changes from baseline 
in pharmacodynamic parameters will be performed using appropriate para metric or 
nonparametric methods.  
Efficacy:  
For endpoints relating to tumor control, analyses will be based on the full-analysis and 
responder data sets. Tumor response and progression will be assessed using standard 
response and progression criteria appropriate for the patient’s dise ase type (NHL or 
CLL/SLL). Response rates  will be presented with corresponding 95% CIs. Time- to-event 
endpoints will be summ arized using Kaplan -Meier methods.

Version 9, 18 Feb 2020 
AI Therapeutics Confiden tial and Proprietary Page 16 of 312 Using appropriate regression or stratification techniques, associati ons between patient 
characteristics (eg, sex, race, age, weight, tumor characteristics, dose) and outcome me asures 
(eg, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters) may be assessed. Simil arly, 
associations between outcome measures (eg, relationships between pharm acokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic parameters) may be evaluate d. 
Basis for the Planned Sample Size (Dose -Escalation Sta ge): 
In the dose escalation, the cohort size allows evaluation of regimen s afety using a standard 
definition of MTD (i.e., a dose associated with DLT in < 33 % of patients during Cycle 1 of 
therapy). With the 3+3 dose-escalation paradigm, there is high probability of dose escalation 
if the true underlying proportion of DLT is low. Conversely, there is a l ow probability of 
dose escalation if the true underlying proport ion of DLT is high. 
Basis for the Planned Sample Sizes (Expansion Sta ge): 
As indicated in Table S-2 above, expansion cohorts of ≥ 6 subjects will be accrued. 
Enrollment of 6 subjects per cohort offers the opportunity to deter mine if there is any 
antitumor activity sufficien t to warrant further development in the selected tumor types. An 
overall response rate ( ORR) of ≥ 35% is considered of potential interest in each of the 
selected indications. If 0/6 subjects in a cohort experience an object ive response, then a 
population ORR of ≥  35% for that cancer can be excluded with > 90% certainty (1-sided 
exact binomial 90% CI upper bound = 32%).   
Based on the observation of objective response s among study sub jects with FL receiving 
either LAM-002A monotherapy or LAM-002A/rituximab, expanded accrual of subjects with 
relapsed FL is planned to evaluate the level of ac tivity with these 2 regimens. Preference will 
be given to enrolling subjects to receive LAM-002A monotherapy b efore enrolling subjects 
to receive LAM-002A/rituximab.  
Based on historical data with other treatments, it is known that an ORR of < 20% in subjects 
with relapsed FL receiving LAM-002A monotherapy would be uninteresting while achieving 
a target ORR of ≥ 40% would suggest that further development is warranted. Sequential 
boundaries will be used to continuously monitor that the ORR is ≥ 40% while excluding an 
ORR of < 20% using a 1- sided test with a significance level of 0.05. A significant result with 
this testing would conclude with 95% confidence that the actual ORR is ≥ 20%. Accrual of 
up to ~20 evaluable subjects will be considered with the poten tial to stop accrual early if the 
boundary is cross ed. Thus, accrual can be considered sufficient if the following n/N valu es 
are observed: 4/5, 4/6, 4/7, 5/8, 5/9, 5/10, 5/11, 6/11, 6/12, 6/13, 6/14, 7/15, 7/16, 7/17, 8/18, 
8/19, 8/20. For all these value s, the ORR is ≥ 40% with a lower 1-sided binomial confidence 
bound of ≥ 20%. 
As noted above, the target ORR with LAM-002A alone is ~40%. Adding rituximab or 
rituximab hyaluronidase human to LAM-002A would be expected to enhance the ORR over 
that associated with single-agent LAM-002A. Thus, the combination of 
LAM-002A/rituximab could warrant further development if an ORR of ≥ 60% could be 
targeted in preference to an ORR of < 40%.  Accordingly, for combination therapy, 
sequential boundaries will be used to continuously monitor that the ORR is ≥ 60% while 
excluding an ORR of 39% using a 1-sided test with a significance level of 0.05. A significant 
result with this testing  would conclude with 95% confidence that the actual ORR is > 39%. Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confiden tial and Proprietary Page 17 of 312 Accrual of up to ~20 evaluable subje cts will be considered with the potential to stop accrual 
early if the boun dary is crossed. Thus, accrual can be c onsidered suffici ent if the following 
n/N values are observed: 7/10, 8/11, 8/12, 9/13, 9/14, 10/15, 10/16, 11/ 17, 11/18, 12/19, 
12/20. For all these values,  the ORR is ≥ 60% with a lower 1-sided binomial confidence 
bound of ≥ 39%.  
Experience indicates the rates of discontinuations from rituximab or a tezolizumab therapy are 
< 5%. A rate of AE discontinuations of therapy due to adverse events o f ≥ 25% in the 
2 combination therapy groups of LAM-0 02A/rituximab (N  = 12) or 
LAM-002A/atezolizumab (N = 12) would suggest a potential adverse interaction among the 
components of the combination therapy. Sequential Pocock-type boundaries will be used to 
continuously monitor the rate of AE discontinuations and to test the null hypothesis, after 
each subject, that the event rate is ≥  0.25 using a 1-sided significance test of ~ 0.05. AE 
discontinuation rates will be considered excessive if the following n/N  values are 
observed: -/1, -/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/5, 4/6, 5/7, 5/8, 5/9, 6/10, 6/11, 7/12. With this method, the 
probability of detecting an AE discontinuation safety signal ranges from 0.091 to >0.820 for 
true discontinuation rates of 25% to ≥  60%. If excessive lev els of AE discontinuation are 
observed, the sponsor, working in collaboration with the investigators, will ta ke appropriate 
actions (eg, continuation of the cohort with modifications in design or monitor ing plan, 
interruption of cohort accrual, cohort therapy discontinuation). 
Basis for the Planned Sample Sizes ( Extension Stage): The sample size in the extension 
stage of the study will be no higher than the total number of subjects on study therapy on the 
data cutoff date that  concludes the dose- escalation and expansion stages of the clinical trial.

AI Therapeutics  is developing LAM-002A (apilimod dimesylate  capsules) for the treatment of 
patients with malign ancies including recurrent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Initially, 
apilimod dimesylate, and apilimod, t he free base (LAM-002), were under development by Synta 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Synta) for the treatment of psoriasis (IND # 62,112) and Crohn’s Dise ase 
(IND # 70,204). Under these INDs, over 700 subjects were exposed to total daily doses up to 
200 mg dimesylate and 210 mg free base (the equivalent of 294 mg apilimod di mesylate) for 
time periods rangin g from a single day to 12 w eeks.  
4.1. Product Summary  
LAM-002A is intended for oral administration. Each capsule will contain 25 mg or 50 of 
apilimod dimesylate (eq uivalent to 17.1 mg or 34.3 mg of apilimod free base, respectively). The 
25-mg capsule is Swedis h orange and the 50-mg caps ule is white. Both the 25- and 50-mg
capsules are Size 0 and both have a total fill weight of 175 mg.
Inactive components in active c apsules are microcrystalline cellulose, silicified microcrystalli ne 
cellulose, anhydrous lactose, cros carmellose sodium, colloidal silicon dioxide, and magnesium 
stearate.  
4.1.1.  Pharmacology 
Apilimod and apilimod dimesylate were originally introduced into clinical  trials based on 
apilimod’s immunomodulatory proper ties (Wada 2007; Wada 2012). Apilimod inhibits the 
production of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL-23), and was effective in preclinical 
animal models of various autoimmune diseases that are mediated by the inappropriate expression 
of T-helper cell phenotype (Th1) cytokines (Wada 2007).  
Recently published data have shown that apilimod is a potent and highly selective first-in-class 
phosphatidylinositol-3-p hosphate- 5 kinase (PIKfyve) inhibitor (Cai 2013, Gayle 2017). In total, 
AI Therapeutics has tested 456 kinases, including di sease-relevant kinases, for their ability to 
bind to apilimod. The screening concentration of apilimod was 1 µM, a concentration that is > 
12,000 times greater than the Kd (81 picomolar) for apilimod against PIKfyve. The results 
showed that apilimod did not bind to any of the 456 kinases tested. 
Inhibition of PIKfyve by pharmacological methods as well as RNA interference (RNAi) 
produces swollen vacuoles and disruption of  endomembrane dynamics. In cell culture, the 
pharmacological disruption of PIKfyve with apilimod induces selective lethality  of specific 
cancer cell lines, presumably through disruption of intracellular trafficking that leads to 
noncanonical cell death (Gayle 2017). 
PIKfyve kinase is a 240-kDa endosomal phosphatidyl inositol (PI ) 5 lipid kinase that catalyzes 
the phosphorylation of PI3 phosphate to PI (3, 5) P2 as shown in Figure 1.  Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confiden tial and Proprietary Page 33 of 312 under the curve ( AUC) were, in general, less th an proportional to the increase in the dose. After 
oral administration, apilimod  was rapidly absorbed. The time to maximum concentration (t max) 
generally occurred within 1 to 2 hours after oral dosing and the terminal eliminatio n half-life (t½) 
ranged from 1 to 4 hours. Apilimod is highly protein bound (≥ 99%) to rat, dog, and human 
plasma proteins. 
Six primary metabolites were identified in vitro (rat and human) and in vivo (rat and dog). 
Human, rat, rabbit and dog studies showed a qualitatively similar metabolic profile. Reaction 
phenotyping studies indicated that CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent CYP1A2 and/ or CYP2D6, 
contribute to the metabolism of apilimod. The primary metabolites were S TA-5864 
(CYP1A2/2D6), STA-5908 (CYP3A4) and STA-5944 (CYP3A4). STA-5864 is further 
metabolized via CYP3A4 to STA-5919. STA-5908 undergoes CYP3A4- mediated metabolism to 
STA-5919 and STA-6048. Further CYP3A4 mediated metabolism of STA-5944 results in 
STA-6035 and STA-6048. As with the parent compound, the primary metabolites of apilimod  
are similarly short -lived in circulation. Generally, tmax occurred within 1 or 2 hours after the oral 
dose of apilimod, consistent with the rapid elimination of this compound from the c irculation. 
The distribution of [14C]-apilimod derived radioactivity was widespread after a single or al 
administration to rats. The tissues with the highest activity were  liver, kidney, stomach, adrenal 
gland, Harderian gland, brown fat, preputial gland, spleen, and esophagus. Most t issues reached 
Cmax 1 hour after dosing. Approximately 60% of the total dosed radioactivity was recovered in 
bile from bile duct cannulated rats. Concentrations were generally high in the gastrointestinal 
(GI) tract, consistent with biliary excretion. Renal cl earance was a minor route of elimination  
accounting for approximately 20% of the total dosed radioactivity. 
The tissue distribution of apilimod and its metabolites was further evaluated in a study in rats 
using material that was not radiolabeled.  In this study it was determined that the rank order for 
plasma AUC and Cmax was STA-5944 > STA-5908 > STA-5326 (apilimod). Brain to plasma 
AUC ratios were highest for STA-5326 (apilimod) > STA-5908 >STA-5944, r anging from 3.1 
for STA-5326 (apilimod) to 0.19 for STA-5944. Tissue to plasma AUC ratios of each analyte 
were greater than 4.6 for intestine, kidneys, and liver. The exception was STA -5944 which 
generally had low liver concentrations. 
4.1.3.  Toxicology 
A series of nonclinica l safety assessment studies was conducted using apilimod and apilimod 
dimesylate in the CD-1 mouse, Sprague- Dawley rat, the beagle dog, and Cynomolgus monkey. 
Studies included safety pharmacology, general toxicology up to 6 to 9 months in dur ation, and 
fertility and developmental toxicology studies. Assessments of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
were also performe d. 
Single- and repeat-dose toxicology studies were conducted in the mouse (up to 90 days), rat (up 
to 6 months), dog (up to 9 months) and monkey (up to 9 months). In the mouse, rat and dog, 
clinical signs at toxic doses included GI findings (emesis and soft stools in rats and dogs; 
diarrhea in the dog only), central nervous system (convulsions, tremors, ataxia ), hypoactivity, 
ptosis, and hunched posture, decreased weight gain, and reduced food consumption. 
Relevant clinical pathology findings at toxic doses included increases i n blood urea nitrogen 
(BUN), creatinine, potassium, inorganic phosphorous, and decreases in total pr otein and Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confiden tial and Proprietary Page 34 of 312 albumin. These i ncreases were attributed to dehydration (pre-renal) as well as decreased 
glomerular filtration (renal).  
Histopathology findings attributed to the investigational drug were intracellular  vacuolation in 
the cervix, uterus, liver, spleen, thymus, bone marrow, intest inal tract, adrenal cortex, urinar y 
bladder, chief cells in the parathyroid gland, renal tubular epithelium and tubule 
regeneration/degeneration with excess tubular cell mitotic cell figures and the vacuolation of 
epidermal cells in the distal ca put and corpus region of the epididymis. Upo n cessation of drug 
administration, all histology findings, with the exception of the epididymis, ha d returned to 
normal. These data strongly suggest the kidney is the target organ of toxi city.  
In an immunotoxicology study in the rat, there were no biolog ically significant changes in spleen 
or thymus weights or adverse anatomic pathology findings. Additionally, there were no 
significant changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets or immunologically a dverse findings 
in splenic antibody-forming cells. In a chronic monkey study in virally infected monkeys, 
apilimod dimesylate  did not elicit lymphomas , or compromise T-cell mediated antibody 
responses. 
In a combined male and female fertility and general reproduction toxic ity study, oral 
administration of apilimod dimesylate had no effects on libido, mating, fertility and estrus. The 
reproductive no-observed- effect level (NOEL) for male and female rats is 38.38 mg/kg/day. 
Administration of apilimod dimesylate  to gravid rats and rabbits during the period of 
organogenesis (implantation to closure of the hard palate) demonstrated that it is a non-selective 
developmental toxicant in the rat. There were no fetal effects in the rabbit.  
Apilimod and apilimod dimesylate  were not demonstrated to be mutagenic, clastogenic, or 
aneugenic. In 2-year carcinogenicity studies in rodents, apilimod dimesylate  was not 
carcinogenic. 
4.1.4.  Pharmacokinetics, Clinical Efficacy and Safety 
4.1.4.1.  Pharmacokinetics  
In humans, apilimod is orally bioavailable, rapidly absorbed, and extensively metabol ized. 
Pharmacokinetic studies revealed generally dose-dependent increases in both Cmax and AUC. t max 
following oral administration was 1 hour in the absence of food and 2 to 3 hour s when taken with 
food; in normal healthy vo lunteers and subjects with psoriasis, tmax ranged from 2 to 4 hours. 
Approximately 90% or more of the absorbed drug was cleared from circul ation within 8 to 10 
hours following administration, after which any remaining drug was elimina ted with a terminal 
half-life of 5 to 10 hours following administration on the first day, increasing to 12 to 21 hours 
on Day 14. These findings suggest that either daily (QD) or BID dosing regimens may be 
appropriate. A small food effect was observed but is not deemed to be clinically significant.  
The 2 dosage forms (apilimod dimesylate  and apilimod formulations) used to date in clinical 
trials are bioequivalent. The 50-mg dose of apilimod dimesylate  provides the same amount of 
active ingredient as the previously used 35- mg capsule of apilimod. Similarly, a 100-mg dose of 
apilimod dimesylate  is equivalent to 70 mg apilimod. Future studies will utilize apilimod 
dimesylate capsules (LAM-002A). Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confiden tial and Proprietary Page 35 of 312 4.1.4.2.  Efficacy 
In Study LAM-002A- NHL-CLN01, efficacy has been assessed  in subjects with NHL. Decreases 
in tumor metabolic activity were noted in 3 subjects with relapsed D LBCL receiving LAM-002A 
monotherapy but these changes did not meet formal criteria for objective response.  Nine subjects 
with FL treated w ith LAM-002A monotherapy, LAM-002A in combination with rituximab, or 
LAM-002A in combination with atezolizumab have had substantial tumor regr essions 
compromising 2 complete responses (CRs) and 7 partial responses (PRs) . The responses have 
been long-lasting, with durations exceeding 12 months among several subjects with mature dat a. 
One subject with MZL receiving LAM-002A/rituximab also experien ced a durable PR.  
4.1.4.3.  Safety 
Apilimod dimesylate  has been generally well tolerated in humans. In patient populations with 
Crohn’s disease or psoriasis , more frequent (> 10%) AEs experienced to date included headache, 
upper respiratory tract infection, and nausea; less frequent (>  5% to 10%) AEs included 
dizziness, fatigue, and nasopharyngitis; and rare (2% to 5%) AEs included diarrhea, arthralgia, 
fever, abdominal pain, peripheral edema, and vomiting. In general, most AEs were assessed as 
mild in severity.  
In the ongoing trial of LAM-002A in patients with hematological cancers, dose-dependent 
gastrointestinal events of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been observed. One patient with 
DLBCL developed acute transient elevations in serum creatinine and blood- urea nitrogen (BUN) 
due to tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) shortly after starting LAM-002A at a dose of 125 mg BID. 
One patient with a hem atological malignancy receiving the drug at 150 mg BID developed 
asymptomatic Grade 3 hyponatremia th at was attributed to the combined effects of LAM-002A-
induced diarrhea and hydrochlorothiazide adm inistration. No other clinically significant saf ety 
signals in laboratory, physical examination, or vital sign findings have been  noted. 
Cardiac monitoring in clinical studies to date  has not revealed any major issues. However, in a 
thorough QT/QTc study, apilimod dimesylate  at doses of 50 mg and 150 mg was associated with 
repolarization findin gs in excess of those deemed negative by International Conference on 
Harmonisation ( ICH) E14 guidance. The magnitude of the change was modest (~8.5 msec) and 
the root-mean-square based an alyses did not demonstrate as large an increase in cardiac 
repolarization time (≤ 1.22 msec) as that identified using the Fridericia meth od. Therefore, the 
significance of this finding is unclear. Preliminary QTc observations in the ongoing st udy in 
patients with hematological malignancies suggest the potential for dose - and exposure- dependent 
Grade 1 or 2 QT prolongation. 
4.1.5.  Overview of Indic ation 
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is a collective term for a heterogeneous group of 
lymphoproliferative malignancies with differing severities, rangi ng from slow growing to 
aggressive subtypes, and varying responses to treatment. In 2015,  it is estimated that there will 
be 71,850 new cases of NHL and an estimated 19,790 people will die of this disease 
(National Cancer Institute SEER webpage). The two most common types, diff use large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL), will account for about half of these 
(Martelli 2013). Other relatively common lymphomas include chronic lymphocytic leukemia/
small lymphocytic  lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (6%), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL, 6%), Clinical Study Report

and “ABC” (also called “non-GCB”), based on resemblance to  normal stages of B-cell 
development by gene expression profiling ( Alizadeh 2000 , Rosenwald 2002). The GCB 
(germinal center B-cell) type arises from malignant transformation of normal germinal center B-
cells, and the ABC (activated B-cell) type arises from post-germinal center B-cells in the process 
of differentiating into plasma cells. ABC DLBCLs have an inferior prognosis compared to GCB 
DLBCLs, but several novel agents are in development with unique activity in ABC disease 
(Hans 2004 , Cultrera 2012).  
The median age at diagnosis of NHL is the seventh decade of life, though they can occ ur at any 
age. The prognosis of NHL depends on the histologic type, stage, and treatment.  
Management of NHL varies widely depending upon histology. NH L patients are usually treated 
with chemotherapy, wi th or without radiation. Virtually all B-cell lymphomas are treated with 
chemotherapy in combination with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab 
(Zelenetz 2014). If NHL persists or recurs after standard treatment, autologous stem-c ell 
transplantation (ASCT) may be a potentially curative option for patients with DLBCL 
(Raut 2014), though the cure rate for ASCT is low for patients relapsing after standard R-CHOP 
(rituximab, cyclophosphami de, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone).  
Patients with DLBCL who relapse after, or who are not candidates for ASCT, as well as patients 
with relapsed MCL, MZL, FL, and CLL/SL L are not considered curabl e with conventional 
therapies. Patients with recurrent disease are commonly given sequentia l regimens of 
chemotherapeutic, immunotherapeutic, o r investigational agents in an attempt to control disease 
manifestations.  Rituximab is commonly employed in combination with other agents 
(Zelenetz 2014). Newer immunopotentiating approaches using anti-PD1/PDL1 inhibitors 
(including atezolizumab [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]1] ) are being explored 
and have shown evidence of activity in p atients with recurrent NHL (Ilcus 2017). However, 
despite use of agents with differing mechanisms of action, progressive resistance to treatment 
typically develops. Patients with refractory or multiply relapsed progressive disease have poor 
prognoses and are ultimately likely to die of their cancers. Novel mechanisms  of action are 
needed that can be administered al one or in combination with existing chemoimmunotherapeut ic 
approaches to offer additional treatment options for patients with hematological cancers who 
have experienced diseas e progression. 
4.1.6.  Previous Clinical Experience with Apilimod and Apilimod Dimesylate in 
Nonmalignant Conditions  
There is substantial experie nce administering apilimod or apilimod dimesylate  to human 
subjects. Clinical trials in normal healthy volunteers were initiated in May 2003 by a previou s 
pharmaceutical sponsor. These were followed by studies in patients with Crohn’s disease, 
psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. To date, more than 700 individuals have participate d in 
clinical studies that evaluated apilimod/apilimod dimesylate. Clinical e xperience has been 
generated in 255 subjects dosed with total daily doses of apilimod dimesylate  100 mg or the 
equivalent apilimod dose of 70 mg free base.  
The starting dose for this P hase 1 clinical study in B- cell NHL is based on 2 Phase 2, 
randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials conducted in subjects with C rohn’s disease or 
plaque psoriasis. Study 5326-07 enrolled 220 subjects with Crohn’s disease. Subjects were Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confiden tial and Proprietary Page 37 of 312 randomized to once d aily placebo or apilimod dimesylate  at doses of 50 or 100 mg. Of the 
147 subjects who received any dose of apilimod dimesylate , 46% were dosed for durations 
between 4 and 6 weeks (53% at 50 mg; 38% at 100 mg) while 12% were dosed for mor e than 
20 weeks. No deaths occurred on study. The most common treatment- emergent AEs reported as 
related to study drug during the blinded portion of the study were nausea (14%) , headache (7%), 
and dizziness (5%). The incidence of related nau sea was more than double in t he 100-mg group 
(20%) compared with the 50-mg group (8%) while the incidence of headache and dizziness was 
identical in the 2 groups. Adverse events of Grade 3 or higher severity were reported for 15% of 
subjects during the blinded portion of the study. A total of 7 subjects disconti nued due to an AE.  
Study 5326-04 was a randomized, placebo -controlled, double-blind, study. A total of 
212 subjects with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were randomized to placebo or to 
apilimod at 7, 21 or 35 mg (equiva lent to apilimod dimesylate  at 10, 30, 50 mg, respectively) 
twice daily (BID) for 12 weeks. Treatment groups were balanced: 60% of subjects complete d the 
study with roughly 30 completers in each treatment group. There were no deat hs. Slight trends 
toward increased frequency of AEs (i.e., dizziness, upper respiratory infections) were observed 
in the highest dose group (35 mg BID) though no trends were observed in the most common 
treatment-related AEs (headache and fatigue). A total of 16 (8%) patients d iscontinued from the 
study due to an AE: 8% in the placebo group, 4% in the 7 mg BID group, 6% in the  21 mg BID 
group, and 12% in the 35 mg BID group.  
4.1.7.  Starting Dose 
As noted in Studies 5326-04 and 5326-07, apilimod was found to be safe and well -tolerated at 
daily doses up to 100 mg/day as a single daily dose of apilimod dimesylate or BID at a total dose 
of 70 mg of apilimod (equivalent to apilimod dimesylate  100 mg). The s tarting dose selected for 
this Phase 1 dose escalation t rial is LAM-002A 50 mg BID. This d ose is expected to achieve a 
Cmax of ~ 70-80 ng/mL, or 180 nM, with predicted plasma half -life of 5 - 10 hours. 
Concentrations required for 90% inhibition of highly sensitive NHL subtypes in in vitro assays is 
~50 nM. It is acknowledged that this star ting dose level will likely result in plasma levels over a 
24-hour period that are lower than the in vitro concentrations cited ; however, the LAM-002A 
50-mg-BID dose for the first cohort is chosen to minimize the risk of potential toxicities in this 
highly pre-treated NHL population.  
Dose escalation will proceed by a mod ified Fibonacci schema as outlined  in Table 3. If 
additional dose exploration beyond the highest dose shown in Table 3 is required to define the 
maximum tolerated dose ( MTD), then dose escalation may pr oceed at increments ≤ 33%.  
The subject population in this study will be comprised of subjects with B -cell NHL who have 
relapsed or were  refractory to previous t herapy (including at least one prior  
chemoimmunotherapy regimen ), and failed or were ineligible or unwilling to undergo ASCT in 
the setting of DLBCL. Clinical Study Report

6.1. Overall Study Design 
This is a Phase  1, single-arm, open-label, dose-escalation study of safety and PK of apilimod 
administered to subjects with refractory or relapsed B- cell NHL. This study will be conducted in 
3 stages. 
6.1.1.  LAM-002A Dose Escalation Stage (Stage 1) 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined during the dose-escalation stage , 
evaluating both continuous and intermittent dosin g regimens. Subjects will accrue using a 3 + 3 
design. During this stage, the decision to open a new cohort at a higher or lower dose level will 
be made by the participating clinical invest igators and sponsor when all subjects in the current 
cohort have be en treated through at least W eek 4 or once 2 DLTs have occ urred in that dose 
cohort. All availabl e safety and PK data wi ll be considered in a decision by the medical monitor 
in collaboration with the investigators to dose escalate, de -escalate, expand the  current cohort or 
explore alternate regimens of drug administration. The MTD will be determined based primarily 
on DLTs observed through Week 4 in ≥ 6 subjects.  
6.1.2.  Expansion Stage (Stage 2) 
Once the MTD and /or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule is determined, the study 
will enter the expansion stage, in which cohorts of subjects will be accrued in order  to obtain 
additional information on safety, tolerability, preliminary anti -tumor activity, PK, and 
pharmacodynamic data at the RP2D and schedule when LAM-002A is administered alone or in 
combination with rituximab/rituximab hyaluronidase or atezolizumab . Expansion-stage cohorts 
will comprise gr oups of subjects with specific types of previously treated, relapsed, progressive, 
and measurable NHL who will receive LAM-002A monotherapy or LAM-002A-containing 
combination therapy as shown in Table 2. For both monotherapy and combination cohorts, the 
starting dose of LAM-002A will be 125 mg BID administered continuously.  Clinical Study Report

6.1.3.  Extension Stage (Stage 3) 
The extension stage ( Stage 3) can begin once the last study subject has completed at least 
8 cycles of study treatment. At this time, the study sponsor will conclude the dose-escalation and 
expansion stages of the study , will collate and verify all study data through an appropriate data 
cutoff date, and will lock the study database for preparation of a study report. Subjects who are 
still safely benefiting from Stage 1 or Stage 2 study therapy as of the data cutoff date may  
electively continue their current regimen of study therapy in Stage 3, receiving clinical care and 
diagnostic testing consistent with c onventional practice standards as deemed appropriate by the 
treating investigator. Therapy in Stage 3 may continue in the absence of protocol-defined reasons 
to discontinue therapy. During Stage 3, collection of clinical data by the sponsor will be limited 
to serious adverse event (SAE) reports. Study drug accountability will be managed per site 
procedures; relevant pharmacy records may be collec ted by the sponsor to document study drug 
disposition.  
6.1.4.  Subject Allocation  (Stage 1 and Stage 2) 
Subjects will be allocated to the cohorts by the study sponsor working in col laboration with each 
investigator considering the availability of openings for enrollment in St age 1 or 2, dise ase type 
(i.e., FL, MZL, DLBCL- GCB, DLBCL -ABC, or other indications), therapy history (e.g., prior 
use of anti-CD20 or anti- PD1/PDL1 antibodies), and current disease status (e.g., potential to 
benefit from rit uximab treatment based on past responses to anti-CD20 antibody therapy).  
During Stage 1 dose ranging with LAM-002A monotherapy, allocation will be performed 
according to a 3+3 dose-escalation procedure with the requirement that  each cohort of 3 subjects 
be observed for ≥4 weeks before another cohort is enrolled (as detailed in Section 6.6). During 
Stage 2 cohort expansion evaluating LAM-002A monotherapy, allocation will be performed as 
subjects present to the acc ruing clinics and there will be no specific restrictions on the cadence of 
enrollment.  During Stage 2 cohort-expansion of LAM-002A combinations with ri tuximab and Clinical Study Report

such th at each subject must be enrolled sequentially and observed for ≥3 weeks before the next 
subject is enrolled. Beginning with the 4th patient in each combination group, further enrollment 
may proceed without restriction as long as the continuous reassessment  boundaries for toxic drug 
discontinuations are not met (as detailed in Section 6.8.4.4 and Section 14.1.2). 
6.1.5.  Subject Evaluability  
A Stage 1 subject will be considere d evaluable if the subject meets  the definition for evaluability 
of Cycle 1 DLT as described in Section 6.6. A Stage 2 subject will be considered evaluable if the 
subject has both baseline and ≥1 on -study tumor assessments sufficient to allow a determination 
of response to study therapy. 
6.2. Number of Subjects 
As many as 145 subjects will be enrolled, assuming that: 
• In the dose-escalation stage of the study, the total number of subjects will depend upon the 
numbers of subjects accrued to each dose level and the number of dose le vels evaluated. If 6 
subjects are enrolled at all open starting dose levels (Dose Levels 5, 6, 7, and 8) and 
6 additional subjects are enrolled at the MTD or RD, as many as 30 subjects could be 
enrolled. To allow for the possibility that some subjects may not be fully evaluable for DLT 
or that an intermediate dose level might be evaluated, up to ~45 subjects may be enrolled.  
• In the expansion stage of the study, if all 8 potential expansion cohorts are accrued, as many 
as ~76 subjects could be enrolled. To allow for the possibility that some su bjects may not be 
fully evaluable for efficacy  or to establish bounds on effica cy estimates with greater 
confidence, up to ~100 subjects may be enrolled.   
• In the extension stage of the study, the total number of subjects will include ≤4 subjects who 
have participated in the expansion stage of the study and are still receiving  study therapy on 
the data cutoff date that co ncludes the dose- escalation and expansion stages of the clinical 
trial. 
6.3. Randomization and Blinding  
This is an open-label study and there is no randomization of subjects. 
6.4. Treatment Assignment  
Inclusion and exclusion cri teria will be reviewed for each p otential subject by the investigator . If 
the consented subject is eligible for study participation, the site will send the eligibility form to 
Ce3 (see Study Manual).  
Ce3 will review the subject’s eligibility form to confirm each subject’s eligibility and  will 
complete the enrollment form with  treatment cohort, treatment dose and frequency. The 
enrollment form will be sign ed and a copy sent to the study site. Once the site receives the 
completed enrollment form, the subject will begin treatment accordingly. The treatment will be 
conducted in an open- label manner. Study sites cannot start dosing the subject without receiving 
the assigned dose on the returned Subject Enrollment and Eligibility Form .  Clinical Study Report

6.5. Overall Treatment Period s 
6.5.1.  Pre-Treatment Period  
The subject is consented and undergoes screening assessments to be qualified for the  study. The 
Schedule of Assessments can be found in Section 8.7. 
6.5.2.  Treatment Period 
The subject is treated and monitored for safety ( including assessments of AEs, vital signs, ECGs, 
laboratory tests and concomitan t medications). Additionally, preliminary anti -tumor activity will 
be assessed and PK and biomarker samples will be collected .   
6.5.3.  Post-Treatment Peri od  
Subjects should be followed until the later of either 30 days after the  last dose of study treatment 
or until resolution/stabilization of any ongoing drug-related AEs and/or SAEs. For subject s with 
events that require follow-up, information regarding concomitant medications should be 
collected. Any necessary follow -up may be obtained in person or by telephon e contact. 
Subjects who have discontinued study treatment for reasons other than PD will be assessed per 
Revised Response Criteria for NHL or Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of CLL at a 
minimum of every 12 weeks until documentation of PD, start of new anti- cancer therapy or for 
up to 1 year from the last enrolled subject’s first treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1) whichever comes 
first.  
Long-term follow-up survival information will be obtained in all surviving subjects who 
permanently discontinue study therapy. Such information may be collected at ~3 - to 6-month 
intervals at the sponsor’s discretion through 3 years. This long-term follow-up information will 
be gathered during routine clinic visits, other study site contact with the subjects, or via 
telephone or e-mail with the subjects/caregivers or referring physician offices. 
6.6. LAM-002A Dose-Escalation Procedure s 
LAM-002A will be administered on a twi ce daily (BID), or thrice daily (TID) oral dosing 
regimen with a cycle length of 28 days. Subjects on a BID schedule will be advised to take the 
doses at the same time each day, ~12  hours apart. Subjects on a TID sche dule will be advised to 
take the doses at the same time each day at intervals of ~6 to  8 hours. On PK days, subjects on a 
TID schedule should receive the morning dose and complete the blood collect ions through 
8 hours thereafter before taking the second do se on that day.  
Other drug administration schedules may be considered if the initial BID or TID regimen’s 
safety, PK and/or pharmacodynamics sugge st that a different schedule would be better tolerated 
and might allow for serum exposures required for anti-lymph oma activity. This might include a  
treatment break such as 3 weeks on/1  week off treatment or 5 days on/2 days off over a 4- week Clinical Study Report

A 3 + 3 design will be utilized to define an MTD. For cohorts consist ing of 3 subjects, dose 
escalation to the next higher dose may proceed if no DLT is o bserved within the first cycle of the 
3 evaluable subjects ac crued to a cohort (See Section 6.1.1). If 1 of 3 subjects in the cohor t 
experiences a DLT, up to a total  of 6 evaluable subjects will be en rolled. If 2 or more of the 3-
6 evaluable subjects in a cohort experience a DLT, dos e escalation will cease, and additional 
subjects will be treated at a lower dose level  or with another schedule. If de-escalation to the 
previous dose cohort is undertaken, this cohort may be expanded to ≥6 subjects. Additional 
subjects (up to 12 total per cohort) may be evaluated to refine the e stimation of the MTD and 
RP2D at the planned dose levels or at an intermediate dose level be tween the highest previously 
tolerated total dose and the next planned total daily dose. The MTD is defined as t he highest dose 
at which < 33% of subjects experience a DLT in the total dose cohort. 
Dose escalation decisions will be evaluated in a DLT -evaluable population. The DLT- evaluable 
population will include subjects who complete Cycle 1 dosing or who are wi thdrawn from study 
due to a DLT in Cycle 1. A subject will be deemed non-evaluable for de termining DLTs and will 
not be counted toward the total cohort size if the subject did not experi ence a DLT, did not Clinical Study Report

the planned first- cycle doses or discontinued from the study prior to completing necessary safety 
evaluations through the first 28 days of study treatment. These subjects m ay be replaced unless 
accrual to the cohort  has stopped due to DLT. 
Following the above guidelines, the participating investigators and sponsor will review available 
data including toxicity, PK and anti-tumor activity data to reach consensus on dose levels and 
determination of the MTD. This group w ill review available safety data for each cohort and will 
determine whether the MTD has been reached and decide upon further s ubject enrollment. Any 
detected cumulative toxicity may require later dose reductions or other  action as appropriate, and 
may be evaluated in determining the RP2D and schedule.  
The RP2D and schedule will be determined in discussion between the spons or and participating 
investigators. Observations related to PK, pharmacodynamics and any drug-related toxicities 
may be included in the rationale supporting the RP2D and schedule. 
6.7. Definition of LAM-002A Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
A DLT will be defined as an AE or abnormal laboratory value meet ing the criteria in Table 4 and 
that is assessed as un related to disease, a comorbid condition, intercurrent illness, or concom itant 
medications). For the purposes of dose escalation and determination of the LAM-002A MTDs, 
DLTs that occur within the first cycle of trea tment must be included in decisions regarding dose 
escalation. DLTs or other clinically significant toxicities that occur after Cycle 1 may also be 
considered when determining the RP2D.

6.8. Treatment Guidelines  
6.8.1.  Tumor Lysis Syndrome Prophylaxis and Therapy 
The risk for TLS must be considered based on e stablished algorithms (Cairo 2010, 
MDACC 2013, Roberts 2016): 
•Low-risk: Serum LDH ≤  ULN, all measurable lymph nodes < 5 cm, and absolute lymphocyte
count (ALC) < 25 × 109/L
•Intermediate risk : Serum LDH >  1 to ≤ 2 × ULN, ≥ 1 measurable lymph node with an LD of
≥ 5 but < 10 cm, or ALC ≥  25 × 109/L
•High risk: Serum LDH >  2 × UL N, ≥ 1 measurable lymph node with a LD of ≥  10 cm, or
both ≥ 1 measurable lymph node with an LD of ≥  5 but < 10 cm and ALC ≥  25 × 109/L
Subjects who are at intermediate or high risk of TLS must receive medical prophylaxis according 
to the following prophyl axis regimens or similar institutional regimens : 
•Intermediate Risk of TLS : These subjects should receive allopurinol, 100 to 300 mg orally
every 8 hours starting ≥  24 to 48 hours before the initial administration of LAM-002A on
Cycle 1-Day 1 of therapy; of note, the maximum daily allopurinol dose is 800 mg, doses ≤
300 mg need not be divided (but may be insufficient for high-risk subjects), a nd doses should
be reduced by ≥  50% in subjects with renal insufficiency. In addition, subjects who develop
hyperuricemia should receive rasburicase, 0.2 mg/kg.
•High Risk of TLS: These subjects should receive allopurinol, 100 to 300 mg orally every
8 hours starting ≥  24 to 48 hours before the initial administration of LAM-002A on
Cycle 1-Day 1 of therapy; of note, the ma ximum daily allopurinol dose is 800 mg, doses ≤

should receive rasburica se, 0.2 mg/kg, administered 3 to 4 hours prior to the first dose of 
LAM-002A. 
In addition, subjects who are at high risk of TLS should be considered for i n-hospital monitoring 
during the first 24 to 48 hours of LAM-002A administration. 
Subjects who develop TLS may experience hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyper uricemia, 
hyperphosphatemia, cardiac dysrhythmias, and acute renal failure; thus, cl ose monitoring of 
electrolytes is important after initial therapy.  
Subjects with TLS should receive intravenous hydration, rapid reversal  of hyperkalemia, 
antihyperuricemic agents, and appropriate cardiac and renal support, includi ng dialysis as 
indicated. Upon recovery to baseline functioning and as medically appropriat e, such subjects 
should continue with protocol therapy to maintain tumor control. 
6.8.2.  LAM-002A 
6.8.2.1.  Premedications  
Subjects taking LAM-002A by continuous administration may be offered antiemetics and 
antidiarrheals as necessary to control g astrointestinal symptoms  as described in Section 6.8.2.6.1. 
For subject who do develo p such adverse effects , sites should consider providing study 
participants with antiemetics and antidiarrheals so that these suppor tive care medications are 
readily available in case gastrointestinal sym ptoms related to LAM-002A recur or persist .  
Subjects taking LAM-002A by intermittent administration are required to receive prophylactic 
antiemetic supportive care  as described in Section 6.8.2.6.2.   
6.8.2.2.  In-Clinic LAM-002A Administration  
For subjects receiving the continuous LAM-002A regimen, the morning dose of LAM-002A 
should be orally administered on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 8 (after a minimum fast of 
6 hours) by site staff after the collection of the biom arker samples and pre -dose PK sample. 
Subjects are allowed to eat after PK Sample #4 ( Hour 2) has been collected. On Cycle 1 Day 15, 
the morning dose of LAM-002A should be orally administered ( after a minimum fast of 6  hours) 
by site staff immediately afte r collection of the pre-dose PK and biomarker samples.  
For subjects receiving the intermittent LAM-002A regimen, prophylactic antiemetics are a 
required component of the regimen as described in Section 6.8.2.6.2. After initiation of the 
antiemetic regimen, the morning dose of LAM-002A should be orally administered on Cycle 1 
Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 10 (after a minimum fast of 6 hours) by site staff after the collection of 
the biomarker samples and pre- dose PK sample. Subjects are allowed to eat after PK Sample #4 
(Hour 2) has been collected. Similarly, on Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 1 Day 15, the antiemetic 
regimen should be initiated and the morning dose of LAM-002A should be orally administered 
(after a minimum fast of 6 hours) by site staff immediately after collectio n of the pre-dose 
samples.  
When given as a component of combination therapy with rituximab , LAM-002A will be started 
on Cycle 1 Day 1 with a BID schedule . LAM-002A will be administered after administrat ion of 
premedications (see Section 6.8.3.1) and ~15 to 30 minutes prior to the start of the initial Clinical Study Report

after premedications (see Section 6.8.3.1) and ~15 to 30 minutes prior to the rituximab 
infusion/injection. 
When given as a component of combination therapy with atezolizumab, LAM-002A will be 
started on Cycle 1 Day 1 with a BID schedule. LAM-002A will be administered  ~15 to 
30 minutes prior to the start of the init ial atezolizumab infusion.  On Cycle 1 Day 8, the morning 
dose of LAM-002A will be administered in the clinic . 
6.8.2.3.  LAM-002A Self-Administration  
Except for the days where treat ment is administered in the clinic, LAM -002A will be self-
administered orally, BID or TID of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or other 
discontinuation criteria are met. When taking the drug at home, subjects should be advised to 
take LAM-002A with ≥ 4 oz. (~160 mL) of water at the same time s each day. Subjects on a BID 
schedule will be advised to take the doses at ~12 hours apart (e.g., 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM) (+/-
 1-hour window). Subjects on a TID schedule will be advised to take th e doses at inter vals of ~6 
to 8 hours. When self-administering LAM-002A at home, subjects may take the drug in the fed 
or fasted state. On PK days, subjects should come to clinic fasted (a minimum fasting state of 6 
to 8 hours) and take the dose at the site under supervision. All subject s will be required to 
complete a dosing diary, which must be returned to the site for review at each si te visit.   
For those subjects taking LAM-002A with continuous administration, the drug s hould be taken 
according the prescribed BID o r TID schedule without interruption unless toxicity or intercurrent 
illness requires a modification to the dosing regimen (see Section 6.8.2.5 ).  
For those subjects taking LAM- 002A with intermittent administrati on, the drug should be taken 
in repeated 7-day sequences comprising BID self-administration for 3 days (6 doses) followed by 
4 days without dosing. If the cadence of the on -off periods is interrupted due to toxicity, 
intercurrent illness, or other reasons, the medical monitor should be consulted regarding the 
timing of therapy resumption and dose modification (see Section 6.8.2.5).  
6.8.2.4.  LAM-002A Dose Schedule Interruptions  and Vomited Doses 
Subjects on a BID schedule who have a delay in administration of a dose of LAM-002A of 
< 6 hours should take the planned dose as soon as possible after the intende d time of 
administration. For subjects who have a delay in administration of LAM-002A of ≥ 6 hours, the 
dose should not be taken. The planned timing of subsequent LAM-002A dosing should not be 
altered.  
Subjects on a TID schedule who inadvertently have a delay in administr ation of a dose 
LAM-002A of ≤ 1 hour, the planned dose should be taken with no changes to the subsequent 
dose schedule. For subjects who have a delay of > 1 hour but ≤ 4 hours, the planned dose should 
be taken; however, all future doses for that day should be shifted lat er by a corresponding 
amount. It is recommended that subjects take the last dose of study m edication no later than 
12:00 midnight on any study treatment day. For example, if the 7:00 AM dose is taken at 
10:00 AM, the next dose should be taken ≥  6 hours later (after 5:00 PM), and the last dose 
should be taken ≥ 6 hours thereafter (between 11:00 PM and 12:00 midnight). For subjects on a  
TID schedule who have a delay in administration of LAM-002A of > 4 hours, the dose should Clinical Study Report

up and the planned timing of subsequent LAM-002A dosing should not be altered. 
For subjects who vomit shortly after taking LAM-002A, the vomited dose should not be 
replaced. The planned timing of subsequent LAM-002A dosing should not be altered. 
6.8.2.5.  LAM-002A Dose Modifications  
The AEs associated with LAM -002A administration have included gastrointestinal toxicities of 
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, typically beginning shortly after initiation of drug administration.  
If a subject experiences an AE that is suspected to be related to LAM-002A, appropriate 
supportive care (e.g., antiemetics, antidiarrheals, thera py for tumor lysis syndrome [TLS]) should 
be instituted consistent with the nature of the event.  
If a subject experiences an LAM-002A-related DLT (reference Table 4) or other AE requiring a 
dose modification, then the LAM-002A administration should be interrupted until the toxicity 
recovers to Grade ≤  1 or baseline. Upon resumption of LAM-002A, the total daily dos e of 
LAM-002A should be reduced using an appropriate dose level or sche dule (reference Table 3) as 
agreed between the investigator and medical monitor. Successive adjust ments to progressively 
lower total daily dose levels can be made. If the subject cannot to lerate LAM-002A after a 
decrease to Dose Level -1 (25 mg BID), then the subject should be discontinued from 
LAM-002A therapy unless continued treatment is permitted by the medical moni tor.  
After the LAM-002A dose is reduced, the dose can be maintained at that dose level or schedule, 
even if there is minimal or no toxicity wi th the reduced dosing regimen. However, if the subject 
tolerates a reduced total daily dose of LAM-002A for ≥ 4 weeks then the LAM-002A dosing 
regimen may be reescalated to a higher total daily dose level at t he discretion of the investigator 
and with the concurrence of t he medical monitor. Such reescalation may be particularly 
warranted if the AE comprised TLS or if further evaluation reveal s that the AE that led to the 
dose reduction was not related to LAM-002A. Successive adjustments to progressively hig her 
total daily dose levels can be made. However, the escalated dose cannot exceed the total daily 
starting dose level for that subject during the first 2 cycles of the rapy.  
Individual subjects who initiated treatment at a total daily dose level at or below the lower of the 
currently established MTD or the RP2D and who have not experienced a DLT after ≥  2 cycles of 
treatment may have the LAM-002A total daily dose escalated to the next higher dose level if 
both the principal investigator and the medical mon itor agree that a dose escalation is medically 
warranted (e.g., for a subject with stable disease who is tolerat ing the current dose level of 
LAM-002A therapy). In such subjects, successive adjustments to progressively hi gher total daily 
dose levels can be  made at interva ls of ≥ 4 weeks with the condition that the escalated total daily 
dose level cannot exceed a LAM -002A dose of 150 mg BID when administered continuously or 
the lower of the currently established MTD or RP2D of LAM-002A when given intermittently.  
In a subject who experiences a DLT precluding resumption of LAM-002A therapy during a 
cycle, a new cycle of treatment may begin at the later of Day 29 or when AEs or laboratory 
abnormalities related to LAM-002A have returned to baseline levels. If drug -related AEs or 
laboratory abnormalities precluding further administration of study drug a re not resolved to Clinical Study Report

instituted. When all drug-related AEs and laboratory abnormalities have returned to baseline, the 
next cycle of therapy can be initiated. Upon initiation of a new cycle  of therapy, the prior cycle 
of therapy will be considered completed. 
Investigators are to discuss modifications in the dosing regimen w ith the medical monito r. The 
appropriate clinic staff should dispense the LAM-002A for the new dose level or schedule and 
instruct the subject/caregiver about the change in the dosing regimen. 
6.8.2.6.  LAM-002A Supportive Care 
6.8.2.6.1.  Antiemetics for Subjects Taking LAM -002A by Continuous Admin istration 
For subjects taking LAM-002A via continuous administration, sites should c onsider providing 
study participants with antiemetics and antidiarrheals so that these s upportive care medications 
are readily available in case gastrointestinal symptoms r elated to LAM -002A develop.  
For subjects taking LAM-002A via continuous administration, it is recomm ended that, if 
prophylactic or therapeutic antiemetics are required, subjects be off ered 2 mg of the serotonin 
antagonist, granisetron (Kytril®, Granisol®), as an oral tablet or soluti on every 6 hours as 
needed. If subjects have persistent nausea or vomiting, consideration ca n be given to a 10-mg 
subcutaneous injection of the extended release form of granisetron (Sustol ®). Alternatively, 
application of a 31.3 mg granisetron transdermal patch (Sancuso®) every 3 to 7 days can be 
offered. For transdermal prophylaxis, 24 to 48 hours may be necessary to allow a s ufficient 
period to achieve effective granisetron systemic concentrations. U se of the serotonin antagon ists, 
ondansetron (Zofran®, Zuplenz®) or dolasetron (Anzemet®), is discouraged due t o the 
possibility that such agents could prolong the cardiac QT interval.  
The dopamine antagonist, olanzapine (Zyprexa®), at doses of 2.5 to 10 mg, may be considered 
alone or in conjunction with serotonin antagonists or other types of antiemet ic agents. 
Olanzapine doses of 10 mg may be sedating, which could be helpful for certain subjects, but may 
represent a concern for others, particularly for those who are elder ly.  
Based on currently available information regarding LAM-002A metabolism, the ne urokinin 1 
receptor antagonist, rolapitant (Varubi®), can be considered, but aprepita nt (Emend®) or 
netupitant+palonosetron (Akynzeo®) should be avoided because these drugs may inhib it 
CYP3A4 and/or CYP2C9 activity.   
Other classes of antiemetic medications that may be employed inc lude dopamine antagonists or 
benzodiazepines if such drugs do not pose risks of QT prolongation or drug-drug inte ractions. 
Given the possibility that LAM-00 2A may alter immunological mechanisms, use of systemic 
corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) should be minimized (particularly when coadministered 
with atezolizumab) to avoid immunocompromise; however, corticosteroids can be introduced if 
other types of an tiemetic agents a re not sufficiently effective.  
6.8.2.6.2.  Antiemetics for Subjects Taking LAM -002A by Intermittent Administration  
Because LAM-002A induces dose- dependent nausea and vomiting, subjects who are taking 
LAM-002A by intermittent administration are requir ed to receive antiemetic supportive care.  Clinical Study Report

LAM-002A 3-day treatment sequence : 
•Dexamethasone 12 mg PO on Day 1 and then 8 mg PO on Day 2 and Day 3
•Granisetron 2 mg PO on Day 1 and then 1 mg PO BID on Days 2 and 3
•Olanzapine, 10 mg PO on Day 1 and then 10 mg PO on Days 2 and 3
The study subject must be sent home from the clinic with sufficient dexamethasone, granisetron, 
and olanzapine to ensure that the supportive care medications are readily available to the subject  
for each of the four 3-day courses of LAM-002A therapy during each 28- day cycle.   
Doses of dexamethasone and olanzapine may be adjusted to tolerance .  Other antiemetic drugs 
(eg, neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists, dopamine antagonists, or benzodiazepines) may be 
considered in consultation with the medical monitor. 
6.8.2.6.3.  Antidiarrheals  
For management of diarrhea related to LAM -002A, it is recommended that subjects take 
loperamide, 4 mg, at the occurrence of the first loose stool and then 2 mg every 2 hours until 
they are diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. More aggressive lopera mide prophylactic or 
therapeutic administration and titration of loperamide dosing for each loose bowel movement 
may be considered. During the night, subjects may take 4 mg of loperamide eve ry 4 hours. 
Subjects should be advised to avoid dehydration through adequate fluid intake. Drugs such as 
5HT3 antagonists or octreotide may be considered for their anti- secretory effects.   For subjects 
who develop diarrhea while also receiving atezolizumab, the possibility of  atezolizumab-induced 
colitis should be considered (see Section 6.8.4.4 ). 
6.8.3.  Rituximab or Rituximab/Hyaluronidase Human 
6.8.3.1.  Premedications  
In accordance with rituximab/rituximab hyaluronidase human prescribing information 
(Genentech 2016 , Genentech 2018), subjects should be premedicated with an antipyretic and an 
antihistamine to reduce the incidence and severity of infusion/injection reactions. A 
recommended regimen is diphenhydramine, 25 mg orally, and acetaminophen ( paracetamol), 
650 mg orally, both given ~30 minutes prior to each rituximab administration. Intravenous 
corticosteroids may also be administered as a premedication. Local practices and guidelines may 
be followed. 
6.8.3.2.  Rituximab Administration 
Based on past experience with this regimen (Ghielmini 2004, Martinelli 2010), rituximab will 
be administered intravenously or rituximab/hyaluronidase human will be administered 
subcutaneously i n the clinic for a total of 8 treatments: 
Intravenous rituximab (Rituxan®)

Subcutaneous rituximab (rituximab/hyaluronidase human ; Rituxan Hycela®) 
•An initial dose of 375 mg/mg2 will be administer ed intravenously on Cycle 1 Day1.
•Three subcutaneous injections of 1,400 mg/23,400 Units (1,400 mg rituximab and
23,400 Units hyaluronidase human ) will be administered weekly on Cycle 1 Day 8,
Cycle 1 Day 15, and Cycle 1 Day 22.
•Four subsequent maintenance subcutaneous injections o f 1,400 mg/23,400 Units
(1,400 mg rituximab and 23,400 Units hyaluronidase hum an) will be administered every
8 weeks on Cycle 4 Day 1, Cycle 6 Day 1, Cycle 8 Day 1, and Cycle 10 Day 1.
The dose calculation of body surface area for infused rituximab will be based on the subject’s 
height and actual body weight prior to therapy. Once established  based on the pretreatment body 
weight, the total dose of rituximab for the subject should not be altered during therapy based on 
fluctuations in body weight unless required by institutional policy. 
At Cycle 1 Day 1, ~30 minutes after administration of the required antipyretic and antihistamine 
premedications and ~15 to 30 minutes after administration of the first dose of LAM-002A, the 
first infusion of rituximab will be administered via an infusion pum p. For the initial infusion, the 
recommended infusion rate is 50 mg/hour. In the absence of infusion toxicity, the infusion rate 
can be increased in 50-mg/hour increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hour. 
For subsequent rituximab infusions, the required antipyr etic and antihistamine premedications 
will be given and the rituximab will be infused via an infusion pump. For these infusions, the 
infusion can be initiated at 100 mg/hour. In the absence of infusion toxicity, the infusion rate can 
be increased in 100-mg/hour increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hour. 
Alternatively, for subjects who tolerate the first infusion with G rade ≤3 infusion toxicity, 
subsequent infusions can be administered over a planned infusion time of 90 minutes, with ~20% 
of the total dose administered in the first 30 minutes and the remaining 80% of the total protein 
dose administered in the subsequent 60 minutes  (Dakhil 2014, Genentech 2016 ).  
For subsequent rituximab/hyaluronidase human injections, the required antipyretic and 
antihistamine premedications will be given and the rituximab/hyaluronidase human will be 
injected into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen over ~5 minutes. Areas where the skin is 
red, bruised, tender or hard, or areas where there are moles or scars should be avoided. No data 
are available on performing the injection at other sites of the body. If administration of 
rituximab/hyaluronidase human is interrupted, drug a dministration can continue at the same site 
or at a different site but restricted to the abdomen. Patients should be observed for ≥15 minutes 
following the completion of injection. During treatment with rituximab/hyaluronidase human, do 
not administer other medications for subcutaneous use at the same sites. Clinical Study Report

Version 9, 18 Feb 2020 
AI Therapeutics Confiden tial and Proprietary Page 53 of 312 6.8.3.3.  Management of Rituximab Infusion/Injection Toxicity 
Rituximab can cause severe, including fatal, infusion reactions (Genentech 2016). Patients with 
pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions, those who experienced prior cardiopulmonary 
adverse reactions to rituximab, and those with high numbers of circulating malignant cells 
(≥25 x 109/L) may be at particular risk. Severe reactions typically occur during the first infusion 
and are generally less frequent and less severe with subsequent infusions. The time to onset of 
infusion toxicity ranges from 30 to 120 minutes. R ituximab-induced infusion reactions and 
sequelae include urticari a, hypotension, angioedema, hypoxia, bronchospasm, pulmonary 
infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction,  ventricular fibrillation, 
cardiogenic shock, and/or anaphylactoid events. 
Rituximab infusions/injections should be interrupted or slowed in subjects experiencing Grade 
≥3 rituximab-related infusion reactions. Medical management (eg, oxygen, epinephrine, 
bronchodilators, and/or glucocorticoids) should be instituted, as needed. Upon improvement of 
symptoms, the infusion may be continued at 50% of the previous rate. At the discretion of the 
investigator, rituximab therapy may be permanently discontinued in subjects with Grade 4 
infusion/injection reactions or with reactions requiring substantial intervention. 
6.8.3.4.  Rituximab/Rituximab Hyaluronidase Human Dose Modifications and 
Supportive Care 
Rituximab-related noninfectious pneumonitis has been described ( Subramanian 2010 ) with an 
incidence of ~4.3% (Salmasi 2010). In patients developing rituximab-associated pneumonitis, 
the mean time from the first rituximab infusion to the onset of respiratory symptoms was 
3 months, with a peak incidence after administration of a mean cumulative dosage of 
1600 mg/m2 (Lioté 2010). 
Severe, including fatal , mucocutaneous reactions can occur in patients receiving rituximab 
during infusion or at later timepoints. Non-infus ion related events have included paraneoplastic 
pemphigus, Stevens Johnson syndrome, lichenoid dermatitis, vesiculobullous dermatitis, and 
toxic epidermal necrolysis  (Genentech 2016 ). The onset of these reactions has varied from 1 to 
13 weeks following initiation of rituximab exposure. 
Among patients receiving rituximab in combination with chemotherapy, rare instances of life-
threatening bowel obstruction or perforation has been observed ( Ram 2009), primarily in 
patients with NHL. In post-marketing reports, the mean time to documented gastrointestinal 
perforation was 6 (range 1–77) days from start of chemoimmunotherapy.  
Fulminate and fatal HBV infection and reactivation can occur during or after treatment with 
rituximab (Genentech 2016 ). The risk is very low among patients with negative anti-HBc 
serology (Matsue 2010) and/or undetectable HBV DNA as assessed by quantitative PCR. 
Because subjects with such evidence of persistent HBV infection are excluded from this study, 
reactivation is not anticipated. Other serious bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral

6.8.4.1.  Premedications  
No specific premedications are recommended for administration prior to atezolizumab 
administration.  Given the potential for interference with desired atezolizumab 
immunopotentiation, systemic corticosteroid administration should be avoided. 
6.8.4.2.  Atezolizumab  Administration 
Atezolizumab will be administered intravenously in the clinic every 3 weeks.  The dose for each 
infusion will be 1200 mg. 
Using an infusion pump, atezolizumab should be administered through an intravenous line with 
or without a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein binding in- line filter (pore size of 0.2 to 
0.22 μm). Other drugs should not be coadministered with atezolizumab through the same 
intravenous line. 
At Cycle 1 Day 1, ~15 to 30 minutes after administration of the first dose of LAM-002A, the 
first infusion of atezolizumab will be administered over 60 minutes . If the first infusion is 
tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be delivered over 30 minutes. Atezolizumab should not 
be administered  as an intravenous push or bolus.  
6.8.4.3.  Management of Atezolizumab Infusion Toxicity 
While infrequent (incident <2%), severe infusion reactions have occurred in clinical trial subjects  
receiving atezolizuma b. For subjects with Grade 1 or 2 infusion reactions, the atezolizumab 
infusion should be interrupted or slowed. For subjects with Grade ≥3 infusion reactions, 
atezolizumab therapy should be permanently discontinued. 
6.8.4.4.  Atezolizumab  Dose Modifications  and Supportive Care  
In clinical trials supporting its approval as therapy for patients with previously treated advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic bladder  cancer (Weinstock 2017, Ning 2017), 
atezolizumab administration has been associated with immune-related AEs of pneumonitis, 
hepatitis, pancreatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies (hypophysitis, thyroiditis, adrenal insufficiency, 
diabetes mellitus), and neurological toxicity  (meningitis/encephalitis,  motor/sensory 
neuropathies, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome) . Immune-
related AEs can be observed within days to months after starting atezolizumab therapy 
(Genentech 2017). 
Severe infections, including pneumonias, urinary tract infections, sepsis, herpes encephalitis, and 
mycobacterial infection have occurred.  
Systemic immune activation  is a rare condition characterized by an excessive immune response.  
Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab, systemic immune activation is considered a 
potential risk when atezolizumab is given in combination with other immunomodulating agents.  
Systemic immune activation should be included in the differential diagnosis for study subjects 
who, in the absence of an alternative etiology, develop a sepsis-like syndrome after  
administration of atezolizumab.  The initial evaluation should include:

6.9. Other Supportive Care Recommendations  
Consistent with subject safety and comfort, administration of any pres cription or over-the-
counter drug products other than study medication will be minimized during t he study period. 
Subjects should be discouraged from use of herbal remedies, self-pres cribed drugs, tobacco 
products, or street drugs during their participation in the clinical st udy and should be counseled 
to minimize use of alcohol or nonmedical marijuana.  
If considered necessary for the subject’s well -being, drugs for concomitant medical conditions or 
for symptom management may be given at the discretion of the investigat or. The investigat or’s 
decision to authorize the use of any drug other than study drug will take int o account subject 
safety, the medical need, the potential for drug interactions, the possibi lity for masking 
symptoms of a more significant underlying event, and whether use of the dr ug will compromise 
the outcome or integrity of the study. 
Subjects will be instructed about the importance of the need to inform  the clinic staff of the use 
of any drugs or remedies (whether prescribed, over-the-counter, or illic it) before and during the 
study.  
Recommendations regarding specific types of concomitant therapies, suppor tive care, diet, and 
other interventions are provided below. To minimize variations in supportive care, the 
recommended supportive care agents (eg, loperamide, granisetron) should be used unless there is 
a medical rationale in a specific subject for use of an alternative p roduct. 
6.9.1.  Antibiotics, Antifungals, and Antivirals 
Care should be taken to avoid or minimize concomitant administration of prophylactic or 
therapeutic antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral, agents that are moderate or strong CYP3A4 or 
CY2C9 inhibitors or inducers (see Section 6.9.6 and Appendix 3).  
For subjects with a history of recurrent infections, prophylaxis with intravenous gamma-globulin 
may be offered and consideration may be given to initiation of antibiotic prophylaxis against 
pneumocystis infection (eg, with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, dapsone, aerosolized 
pentamidine, or atovaquone) beginning prior to study drug administration. Such support also 
offers the benefit of reducing the risk for other bacterial infections (Stern 2014). Local practices 
or guidelines regarding infection prophylaxis may be followed.  
Subjects developing an intercurrent infection during study drug treatment may receive 
therapeutic antibacterial, antiviral, or antifungal drugs for intercurrent infections as needed. 
Continuation of study therapy during t reatment for an intercurrent infection  is at the discretion of Clinical Study Report

subjects receiving combination therapy. 
6.9.2.  Anticancer Therap ies Other than the Study Drugs  
No systemic anticancer therapies (including chemotherapy, antibody therapy, hormonal therapy, 
immunotherapy, or other experimental therapies) for the subject’s cance r are permitted while the 
subject is receiving study treatme nt. Subjects are not allowed to participate concurrently in any 
other therapeutic clinical or imaging study. 
The use of palliative radiotherapy should be minimized given the potential of such treatment to 
confuse assessments of study drug safety or therapeutic effect. Howe ver, administration of 
limited-fraction radiotherapy is permitted to control local tumor- related symptoms if irradiation 
is unlikely to induce major organ toxicity or affect target lesions bei ng followed for tumor 
response and progression. 
If required to maintain disease control, study drugs may be continued with caution during 
radiotherapy administration.  
6.9.3.  Anticoagulants 
Use of local anticoagulation or antithrombotic agents to maintain a venou s access catheter is 
permitted. While not prohibited, use of systemic anticoagulants (eg, unfra ctionated heparin, low-
molecular-weight heparin, fractionated heparin, warfarin or other oral anticoagula nts, aspirin) 
after a subject is on study should be avoided unless necessary for developm ent of a serious 
intercurrent thrombotic or embolic condition. Subjects who develop conditions tha t require 
anticoagulant therapy are permitted to receive such drugs and are not r equired to discontinue 
study participation if they appear to be safely benefiting from study t herapy. Subjects should be 
closely monitored for bleeding events when on systemic anticoagulant therapy. 
6.9.4.  Antihistamine , Antiinflammatory, or Antipyretic, Drugs  
Antihistamines (e g, cetirizine, diphenhydramin e), and antiinflammatory/antipyretic  drugs (eg, 
acetaminophen [paracetamol], nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAI Ds]), may be used 
during the study, as medically warranted. The potential for adverse hepa tic effects with 
acetaminophen and platelet inh ibitory effects with NSAIDs should be considered in the selection 
of the appropriate drug for the clinical situation. 
6.9.5.  Corticosteroids  
At study entry, subjects may not be using systemic or enteric corticost eroids but may be 
receiving inhaled or topical corticosteroids. During study therapy, subject s may use systemic, 
enteric, topical or enteric corticosteroids as required by protocol or for treatment-emergent 
conditions. Use of systemic or enteric corticosteroids as premedica tions or for other reasons 
should be minimized but can be considered after consul tation with the medical monitor.  
6.9.6.  Drugs with Potential for Drug -Drug Interactions with LAM-002A 
No information is available regarding interactions of LAM-002A with the rapeutic agents or other 
substances in humans. In vitro data suggest that concomitant administration of potent inhibitors 
or inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 might alter LAM-002A clearance and lead to clinically Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confiden tial and Proprietary Page 60 of 312 significant increases or decreases in LAM-002A exposure. Consequently, the concomitant us e of 
strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 (see Table 15) should be avoided when 
possible.  
Based on these considerations, protocol candidates who require therapy with strong CYP3A4 or 
CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers listed in Table 15 should not be enrolled into the study.  
During study participation, coadministration of LAM-002A with CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 inhibitors 
or inducers (see Table 15) should be avoided, if possible. However, a subject who develops a 
condition that may require use of such drugs is not required to permanently discontinue 
LAM-002A if the subject is experiencing clinical benefit and other options f or treating the 
subject’s cancer are limited. If medically a ppropriate, investigators may wish to use a therapeutic 
alternative that would not be expected to affect these enzymes. For s ubjects who require 
temporary use of a drug that does affect these enzymes (e.g., t reatment with a systemic 
antifungal agent), LAM-002A can be interrupted (or the doses reduced) during use of the other 
medication and then resumed after completion of the other drug. For subjec ts who require 
initiation of chronic therapy with a drug that p otently affects these enzymes, investigators mus t 
consult with the medical monitor to consider the best course of action.  
6.9.7.  Drugs Known to Prolong the QT Interval 
In a thorough QTc study, apilimod dimesylate at doses of 50 mg and 150 mg was a ssociated with 
repolarization findings in excess of those deemed negative by regulatory g uidance. The 
magnitude of the change was modest (~8.5 msec), peaked at 4 hours and did not demonstrate a 
dose trend. Preliminary QTc observations in the ongoing study in patients wi th hematological 
malignancies suggest the potential for dose- and exposure dependent Grade 1 or 2 QT 
prolongation. 
As a precaution, the clinical potential of LAM-002A to prolong the QT interval will be assessed 
in this study. Accordingly, co- administration of LAM-002A and known QT-prolonging drugs is 
to be minimized because use of such drugs might confound interpretation of QT  data from the 
trial.  
Based on these considerations, protocol candidates who require therapy wit h drugs known to 
prolong the QT inter val (as listed in Table 16) should not be enrolled into the study. If medically 
justified, protocol candidates may be enrolled if such drugs can be dis continued or alternative 
drugs that do not affect QT can be substituted >7 days before the firs t dose of study drug.  
After the subject is enrolled to the protocol, use of drugs known to prolong the  QT interval 
should be minimized but is not prohibited if administration of such drug is ne cessary and the 
subject appears  to be benefiting from protocol therapy. 
6.9.8.  Hematopoietic Support  
Granulocyte colony -stimulating factor ( G-CSF) (eg, filgrastim, filgrastim snd, pegfilgrastim, 
lenograstim) may be administered in response to Grade ≥3 neutropenia or neutropenic 
complications.  
Granulocyte-macrophage colony- stimulating factor ( GM-CSF) should not be administered given 
the potential for GM-CSF-related inflammatory symptoms.  Clinical Study Report

Red blood cell or platelet transfusions may be administered as medic ally indicated. 
6.9.9.  Immunization  
There is no information regarding t he effects of LAM-002A or atezolizumab on the safety or 
response to immunization against infectious pathogens.  
In randomized clinical trials, rituximab has been shown to reduce the antibody response to 
pneumococcal vaccination (a T-cell-independent antigen) or to anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin 
antibodies (a novel protein antigen) (Genentech 2016 ). Response to tetanus toxoid vaccine (a 
T‑cell-dependent antigen with existing immunity) or maintenance of a positive Candida skin test 
(as a measure of T-cell-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity) was not altered. The specific 
clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.  
For subjects who are at substantial risk of an infection (eg, influenz a) that might be prevented by 
immunization, consideration should be given to providing the vaccine prior to initiati on of study 
therapy. Vaccination with live virus vaccines during study treatment is  not recommended. 
6.9.10.  Procedures/Surgery  
The extent to which LAM-002A or other study drugs may affect wound healing or the risk of 
would infection is unknown. Investigators may use clinical discretion in deciding whether to 
interrupt protocol therapy before and after surgery or other invasive procedures.  
6.9.11.  Skeletal Event Prophylaxis 
Bisphosphonates or denosumab are permitted if a subject was receiving such therapy at the time 
of screening and will continue on a stable regimen throughout protocol therapy. The need to start 
such drugs while on therapy may be an indication of disease progression and should be discussed 
with the sponsor prior to implementation. 
6.10. Study Restrictions  
6.10.1.  Breast Feeding 
There is no information regarding the presence of LAM-002A or its metabolites in animal or 
human breast milk and the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or on milk production are 
unknown. 
Rituximab is secreted in the milk of lactating cynomolgus monkeys, but it is not specifically 
known whether rituximab is secreted into human milk (Genentech 2016 ). There is similarly no 
information regarding the presence of atezolizumab in human milk ( Genentech 2017 ). However, 
because human IgG is excreted in human milk, there is a hypothetical potential for absorption 
and harm to an infant from administration of these types of therapeutic antibodies.  
For these reasons, women who are nursing are not eligible to participate in this study. Lactating 
women who do participate in this clinical trial must discontinue nursing during protocol therapy 
and should avoid nursing for ≥2 months after LAM-002A and for ≥5 months after the last dose 
of rituximab or atezolizumab.  Clinical Study Report

Version 9, 18 Feb 2020 
AI Therapeutics Confiden tial and Proprietary Page 62 of 312 6.10.2.  Contraception  
Animal studies have been conducted to assess the effects of apilimod on fertility and 
organogenesis. In studies conducted to date , apilimod or apilimod dimesylate did not affect 
fertility or cause reproductive harm. One patient receiving the drug for Crohn disease conceived 
during therapy; a normal pregnancy was carried to term and a healthy infant was born. However, 
no other experience is available with the drug in pregnant patients.  
Reproduction studies of rituximab in cynomolgus monkeys at maternal exposures similar to 
human therapeutic exposures have shown no teratogenic effects (Genentech 2016 ). However, B-
cell lymphoid tissue was reduced in the offspring of these animals; B-cell counts returned to  
normal levels and immunologic function was restored within 6 months of birth. In humans,
B-cell lymphocytopenia generally lasting <6 months can occur postnatally in infants exposed to  
rituximab in utero.
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atezolizumab to evaluate its effect on 
reproduction and fetal development. A literature-based assessment of the effects on reproduction 
demonstrated that a central function of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway is to preserve pregnancy by 
maintaining maternal immune  tolerance to a fetus (Genentech 2017 ). Blockage of PD-L1 
signaling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to a fetus and to 
result in an increase in fetal loss; therefore, potential risks of administering atezolizumab during 
pregnancy include increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. As reported in the literature, there 
were no malformations related to the blockade of  PD-L1/PD-1 signaling in the offspring of these 
animals; however,  immune-mediated disorders occurred in PD-L 1 and PD-1 knockout mice. 
Based on its mechanism of action, fetal exposure to atezolizumab may increase the risk of 
developing immune-mediated disorders or altering the normal immune response. 
Accordingly, sexually active females of childbearing potential must agr ee to use a protocol-
recommended method of contraception during heterosexual intercourse from the  start of the 
screening period until ≥ 5 months days after the final dose of study therapy.  
In the context of this protocol, a female subject is considered to be of childbearing potential 
unless she has had a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy; has 
medically documented ovarian failure (with serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level 
>35 mIU/mL and a negative serum or urine beta βHCG); or is menopausal (amenorrhea for
≥12 months).
Sexually active male subjects who can father a child and are having in tercourse with females of 
childbearing potential who are not using adequate contraception must agree  to use a protocol-
recommended method of contraception from the start of study therapy until ≥ 5 months days after 
the final dose of the study therapy and to refrain from sperm donation fr om the start of study 
therapy until ≥ 5 months after administration of the fina l dose of study therapy. 
In the context of this protocol, a male subject is considered able to father a child unless he has 
had a bilateral vasectomy with documented aspermia or a bilateral orchiectomy.

Because LAM-002A is a substrate of CYP3A4, subjects should be advised to avoid ingestion of 
grapefruit, grapefruit juice, or Seville oranges (which contains a pot ent CYP3A4 inhibitor) and 
should not use St. John’s wort, which is a potent CYP3A4 inducer. No other spec ific dietary 
restrictions are required.  
6.11. Duration of Subject Participation  
Subjects may continue receiving LAM-0002A until the occurrence of any event s requiring 
treatment discontinuation as defined in Section 6.8.2.5 and Section 6.12. 
Subjects allocated to LAM -0002A/rituximab may continue to receive rituximab or rituximab 
hyaluronidase human until the earliest of a maximum of 8 infusions or the occurrence of any 
events requiring treatment discontinuation as de fined in Section 6.8.3.4 and Section 6.12. 
Subjects allocated to LAM -0002A/atezolizumab may continue to receive atezolizumab until the 
earliest of any events requiring treatment disc ontinuation as defined in Section 6.8.4.4 or 
Section 6.12. 
Note: If medically appropriate, subjects allocated to combi nation doublet therapy may  
continue with protocol -specified therapy for the ther apeutic agent ( LAM -002A, rituximab , 
rituximab hyaluronidase human, or atezolizumab) that continues to be tolerate d, even if the 
other agent need to be discontinued due to drug -specific toxicity.  
Subjects who have discontinued study treatment for reasons other than PD will be assessed per 
Revised Response Criteria for NHL or Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of CLL at a 
minimum of every 12 weeks until documentation of PD, start of new anti -cancer therapy or for 
up to 1 year from the last enrolled su bject’s first treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1), whichever comes 
first. Long-term follow-up survival information will be obtained in all surviving subjects who 
permanently discontinue study therapy. Such information may be collected at ~ 3- to 6-month 
intervals at the sponsor’s discretion through 3 years. This long- term follow-up information will 
be gathered during routine clinic visits, other study site contact with the subjects, or via 
telephone or e-mail with the subjects/caregivers or referring physic ian offices. Clinical Study Report

Participation 
Subjects may be withdrawn from further study treatment for any of the  following reasons: 
• Subject withdrawal of informed consent 
• Disease progression of cancer while receiving study therapy Note: Apparent worsening of 
disease during temporary interruption of study therapy (e.g.,  for drug -related toxicity or 
intercurrent illness) may not indicate true can cer progression. Study subjects undergoing 
PET for lymphoma assessment can experience transient disease flare on imagin g before 
having subsequent  therapy -induced tumor regression. Worsening of constitutional 
symptoms or performance status in the absence of  objective evidence of worsening 
lymphoma (e.g.,  due to infection) may not repre sent definitive disease progression . For 
these reasons, if there is uncertainty regarding whether there is tru e disease progression 
and if medically appropriate, the subject ma y continue or resume study treatment and 
remain under close observation (e.g.,  evaluated at 4- to 8- week intervals) while relevant 
radiographic, clinical, and/or laboratory assessments are performed to document whet her 
tumor control can be maintained or wh ether disease progression has truly occurred. If 
subsequent evaluations suggest that the subject has experienced persistent definitive 
disease pr ogression, then the date of progression will be the timepoint at which 
progression was first objectively docume nted.  
• Unacceptable study-drug-related toxicity despite appropriate dose modific ation 
• Development of intercurrent illness that precludes continued study therapy  
• Physician decision that continuation is not in the subject’s best interest 
• Treatment of the can cer with another therapeutic regimen  
• Subject becomes pregnant or begins breastfeeding 
• Substantial noncompliance with study drug administration, study procedures, or s tudy 
requirements in circumstances that increase risk or substantially c ompromise the 
interpretation of study results 
• Termination of the study by the sponsor , relevant regulatory agencies, or the IRB/IEC 
The investigator must determine  the primary reason for a subject’s withdrawal from the study 
and record this information on the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
Unless they withdraw consent for further follow-up, subjects who discontinue s tudy therapy will 
continue on study for acqui sition of safety information through ≥30 days after the last dose of 
study treatment, and for further collection of long- term information regarding survival. 
6.13. Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects not meeting the criteria for evaluability defined in Section 6.1.5  may be replaced at the 
discretion of the sponsor . If a subject needs to be replaced, the associated subj ect ID will not be 
used again. Clinical Study Report

All trial data during the dose-e scalation stage (Stage 1) and expansion stage (Stage 2) will be 
recorded on the eCRFs. Timing of study procedures for the dose-escalation stage (Stage 1) and 
expansion stage (Stage 2) are listed in schedules of assessments tables – Table 8: Schedule of 
Assessments (LAM-002A Continuous Monotherapy Administration ), Table 9: Schedule of 
Assessments (LAM-002A Intermittent Monotherapy Administration ), Table 10: Schedule of 
Assessments (LAM-002A/Rituximab Combination Therapy ), and Table 11: Schedule of 
Assessments (LAM-002A/Atezolizumab Combination Therapy) – in Section 8.7.  During the 
extension stage (Stage 3), collection of clinical data by the sponsor will be limited t o serious 
adverse event (SAE) reports. Study drug accountability will be managed per site procedu res; 
relevant pharmacy records may be collec ted by the sponsor to document study drug disposition. 
8.1. Screening/Baseline Evaluatio ns Only 
8.1.1.  Informed Consent 
Each potential subject must sign a written informed consent form (ICF)  prior to performing any 
study-specific procedure. Principal investigators (PIs) at each site are responsible for maintaining 
a record of all subjects screened, including both those who enter the study and those who are 
excluded. 
8.1.2.  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
During Screening, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed for each potential  subject 
and confirmed by Day 1 of Cycle 1.  
8.1.3.  Medical History 
At Screening, a complet e medical history will be obtained from each subject, including relevant 
medical history, current primary cancer diagnos is, pathology reports (including corresponding 
flow cytometry and cytogenetic reports), prior cancer treatments (chemo - and immunotherap ies, 
radiation therapy, surgeries), and disease- specific characteristics, such as tu mor stage and 
histology.  
8.1.4.  Demography 
At Screening, subject demographic data will be collected, including date  of birth, gender, race, 
and ethnicity. 
8.1.5.  Disease Status Assessment for Subjects with NHL  
Pretreatment tumor assessments wi ll be performed within 30 days of the first dose of study 
treatment and will include diagnostic CT scans (with intravenous contrast) or Positron Emission 
Tomography (PET)/Computerized Tomography S cans (CT scan) for patients with ly mphoma, 
bone marrow aspirate/biopsy, complete blood counts and physical examination. I t is anticipated 
that in most cases the PET /CT scans will be conducted using a single instrument, i.e., as a 
PET/CT scan (CT scans shou ld be performed using a contiguous reconstruction algorithm o f 
≤ 5 mm). However, MRI is an acceptable alternative method for assessi ng disease in subjects Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confiden tial and Proprietary Page 70 of 312 who cannot receive intravenous contrast with CT scans. In such subjects MRI and PET s cans 
will have to be obtained separately.  
Suitable scans performed prior to screening and within 30 days before first dose may be used for 
baseline tumor assessments . Similarly bone marrow biopsies /aspirates performed within 
2 months prior to first dose may be used for ba seline assessments. For subjects wi th NHL, 
baseline bone marrow biopsies/aspirates may be omitted if not deeme d essential for response 
assessment or patient management  and there is another source of tumor tissue for pretreatment 
evaluation of gene expression and prognosis. For subjects with CLL/SLL, a baseline bone 
marrow aspirate is required unless the presence of sufficient circu lating cells in the peripheral 
blood (e.g., ALC ≥  10 x 109/L) permits assessment of baseline parameters for gene  expression 
and prognosis. Details of assessments w ill be collected on the e CRF and must be filed in the 
subject’s medical record . 
Fresh tumor tissue (preferred) or archival tumor tissue that was obtained within 4 months prior to 
the start of screening  (provided adequate quantities are available )  must be obtained pretreatment  
for nucleic acid extraction . For subjects undergoing a biopsy, adequate tumor tissue should be 
acquired via excisional biopsy, incisional biopsy or core needle biopsy (e.g., ≥ 3 passes using a 
16-gauge core needle).  Confirmation of tumor in biopsy with fine needle aspirate, touch prep, or 
FFPE processing is requested when possible.  T he tumor lesion selected should not have been 
previously irradiated and should not be an index lesion that is followed for response assessment.  
Alternatively, cells from a bone marrow aspirate may be obtained in subjects with bone marrow 
involvement due to NHL (≥50% of cells) . Tissue will be submitted for  evaluation of the 
percentage of tumor cells and  analysis of genetic alterations and/or gene expression that may 
predict anti-lymphoma activity and/or pharmacodynamics activity.  
In addition, tumor tissue from the fresh biopsy or most recently availably biopsy or surgery will 
be evaluated for known prognost ic characteristics ( e.g., for DLBCL: ABC or GCB subtype; 
expression of BCL2, BCL6, Ki-67, CD20, and MYC; other mutational status), f or PDL1 status, 
and for immune infiltratio n. The baseline biopsy procedure (if required) should ideally be 
performed after t he study candidate has undergone the baseline radiology examination and is 
otherwise considered eligible for study participation. 
8.1.6.  Disease Status Assessment s for Subjects with  CLL/SLL  
All subjects with CLL must have baseline imaging (with CT scans [preferred] or MRI scans ).  
Subjects with CLL/SLL must provide either a fresh blood sample conta ining circulating tumor 
cells or a bone marrow aspirate sample pretrea tment. Tissue wi ll be submitted for evaluation of 
the percentage of tumor cells and analy sis of genetic alteration s and/or gene expression that may 
predict anticancer activity and/or pharmacodynamic activity. In addition, for subjects with 
CLL/SLL, the spo nsor may arrange for a portion of the sample to be evaluated at a sponsor-
specified labor atory for known prognostic markers (e.g., quantitative immunoglobulins, FISH 
panel [chromosome 11q deletion, 13q deletion, 17p deletion and 12 trisomy], DNA mutational  
analysis for p53, IgHV [including IgHV3-21], and other genes of interest i n CLL [e.g., Notch]; 
flow cytometry [for CD5, CD10, CD11c, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD38, CD45, kappa and lambda 
light chains and ZAP- 70], and/or β2-microglobulin). The baseline bone marrow aspiration 
procedure (if required) should ideally be p erformed after the study candidat e has undergone the 
baseline radiology examination and is otherwise considered eligible for study participation.  Clinical Study Report

Complete physical examination (PE) will be performed at  Screening and may include evaluation 
of head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat, dermatological, respiratory, cardiova scular, gastrointestinal, 
endocrine/metabolic, neurological, lymphati c, and musculoskeletal systems. A directed PE, 
including weight, will be performed within 72 hours prior to the start of each cycle and at End of 
Treatment.  
ECOG Performance Status will be assessed at the same time points as P Es (See Appendix 1). 
8.2.2.  Pregnancy Test  
Serum or urine pregnancy test will be performe d for WCBP at Screening, within 72 hours of 
Day 1 of each treatment cycle, and at the EOT visits. The test does not need to be repeated at 
Cycle 1 Day 1 if ba seline testing was performed within 72 hours of first dose. However, the 
result must be negative f or the subject to be enrolled in the study and to continue participation.  
8.2.3.  Urinalysis  
A urine sample will be obtained at Screening, within 72 hours of Day 1 of each treatment cycle, 
and at the EOT visit. Analysis will include asse ssment of appearance, spe cific gravity and pH as 
well as a semi-quantitative “dipstick” evaluation of glucose, protein, bilirubin, ketones, 
leukocytes and blood. Microscopic examination of sediment will be performed if urinalysis is 
positive for white bloo d cells (WBCs), proteins, or blood. 
8.2.4.  Electrocardiogram   
A 12-lead ECG with subject resting for 5 minutes will be done at Scre ening. Additional ECGs 
will be conducted according to Table 8: Schedule of Assessments (LAM-002A Continuous 
Monotherapy Administration ), Table 9: Schedule of Assessments  (LAM-002A Intermittent 
Monotherapy Administration ), Table 10: Schedule of Assessments  (LAM-002A/Rituximab

the eCRFs from Cycle 1 Day 1 through 30 days  after the last dose of study treatment. Study 
treatment related AEs/SAEs that are ongoing 30 days after the last dose of study treatment 
should continue to be followed until resolution or stabilization. AE assessment will be done at a 
minimum at each  scheduled visit. For the weeks that the subject is not required to come to the 
study site, the investigator will monitor each subject for possible AEs via telephone contact as 
needed. 
8.6. Treatment Compliance  
The investigator will dispense the study medication only for use by subjects e nrolled in the study 
as described in this proto col. The study medication is not to be used for reasons other than those 
described in this protocol. 
The investigator or other study staff will supervise LAM-002A treatment given at the  site and 
instruct the subject on study medication self -administration.  Subjects will be asked to bring their 
dosing diary with them at each visit. Compli ance with protocol-defined LAM-002A intake will 
be checked by pill count at the end of each cycle and compliance decisions will be made by th e 
investigator. 
A subject is con sidered to be DLT-evaluable if he/she has taken at least 75% (42/56 BID 
schedule; 63/84 TID schedule, 18/2 4 intermittent schedule ) of the planned first-cycle doses and 
has sufficient safety data, or has experienced a DLT in the first cycle.  Clinical Study Report

I Pregnancy testing (serum or urine) will be required for women of c hildbearing potential (WCBP) only. Testing is  required at Screening; within 72 ho urs of 
Day 1 of each cycle and at EOT. Test does not need to be repeated on C1D1 if baseline was negat ive and conducted within 72 hours of first dose.  
J Imaging as appropriate for disease indication will be conducted wit hin 30 days of the first dose of stu dy treatment. Suitable scans  performed prior to 
screening and within 30 days before first dose may be used for baseline  tumor assessments.  
K Assessment of disease status will be conducted with standard cl inical measureme nts: PE, CBCs, bone marrow aspirates/biopsies, and imaging as ap propriate 
for indication. During treatment, scans will be repeated for tumor  assessment within 7 days of Day 1, Cycles 3, 5, and 7 then  every 3 months until PD or use 
of alternative antineoplastic therapy. For subjects still in response after 1 year, inter vals for radiographic surveillance may be every 6 months. Subjects with 
CLL who achieve CR will require assessment of MRD by flow cytome try of bone marrow and peripheral blood.  
L Imaging at EO T is not required if PD has already been radiographically docume nted or last imaging was within 30 days of EOT visit.  
M  Subjects with CLL/SLL must provide either a fresh blood sample cont aining circulating tumor cells or a bone marrow aspirate s ample pretreatment. Tissue 
will be submitted f or evaluation of the percent age of tumor cells and analysis of genetic alterations and/or gene expres sion that may predict anticancer activity 
and/or pharmacodynamic activity. In addition, for subjects with CLL/SL L, the sponsor may arrange for a portion of  the sample to be evaluated at a 
sponsor-specified laboratory for known prognostic markers (e.g., quantitati ve immunoglobulins, FISH panel [chromosome 11q deletion, 13q deletion, 
17p deletion and 12  trisomy], DNA mutatio nal analysis for p53, IgHV [includin g IgHV3-21], and other genes  of interest in CLL [e.g., Notch]; flow cytometry 
[for CD5, CD10, CD11c, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD38, CD45, kappa and lambda lig ht chains and ZAP -70], and/or β2-microglobulin). The baseline bone 
marrow aspiration procedure (if required) should be performed afte r the study candidate has undergone the baseline radiology examination and is othe rwise 
considered eligible for study participation. All subjects with CLL /SLL must have baseline imaging (with CT scans [preferred] or MRI scans).  
N Blood sampling for determ ination of the plasma concentrations and activity of LAM-002A and metabolites will be performed on C1D1 and C1D8 as follows: 
pre-dose, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours post -first dose of the day. Sampling on C1D15 will be pre-dose only. Subjects are require d to come to the study site in

bone marrow biopsies/aspirates may be omitted if not deemed essential for response assessment or patient management  and there is another source of tumor 
tissue for pretreatment evaluation of gene expression and prognosis . For subjects with CLL/SLL, a baseline  bone marrow aspirate is required unless the 
presence of sufficient circulating cells in the peripheral blood ( e.g., absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] ≥  10 x 109/L) permits assessment of baseline 
parameters as described in Footnote m, above.  
P If necessary per ap plicable response criteria, a repeat bone marrow biopsy or aspira te will be required for subjects who have a CR by imaging an d physical 
examination. 
Q Fresh tumor tissue (preferred) or archival tissue from the most recent available biopsy or surgery (within 4 months prior to the start of screen ing) must be 
obtained pretreatment for nucleic acid extraction. For subjects undergoi ng a biopsy, adequate tumor tissue should be acquired via excisional biopsy, incisional 
biopsy or core needle biopsy (e.g., ≥  3 passes using a 16 -gauge core needle). Confirmation of  tumor in biopsy with fine needle aspirate, touch prep, or FFPE 
processing is requested when possible .  The tumor lesion selected should not have been previou sly irradiated and should not be an index lesion  that is 
followed for response assessment.  Alternatively, cells from a bone marrow aspirate may be obtained in subjects wit h bone marrow involvement due to NHL 
(≥50% of cells). Tissue will be submitted for evaluation of the per centage of tumor cells and analysis of genetic alterations and/or gene expression that may 
predict anti-lymphoma activity and/or pharmacodynamics activity. In addition, the fresh biopsy or tumor tissue from the  most recently availably biopsy or 
surgery will be evaluated for known prognostic characteristics (e. g., for DLBCL: ABC or GCB subtype; expression of BCL2, BCL6 , Ki-67, CD20, and 
MYC; other mutational status), for PDL1 status, and for immune  infiltration. The baseline biopsy procedure (if required) should ideally be performed af ter the

B Complete PE will be performed at  Screening. A directed PE, including weight, wi ll be performed within 72 hours prior to the start of each cycle and EOT.  
C Assessment/test does not need to be repeated on C1D1 if baseline wa s within normal limits and conducted within 72 hours of first dose . 
D Obtained on Day 1 for all cycles. For C1D1 and C1D8 obtained prior to dosing and 1 hour (± 15 minutes after dosing), 2 hours (± 30 minutes), 
4 hours (± 1 hour), and 8 hours (± 1 hour) postdose. For C1D15, obtained prior to dosing.  
E Hematology includes  hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC count, platelet co unt, WBC and differential. 
F All hematology and chemistry laboratory parameters shou ld be assessed at Screenin g, on C1D1, C1D8, C1D15, C≥2D1 (all subsequent cycles), and at EOT.  
Obtaining a chemistry laborator y parameter on C1D2 and C1D3 is only required in subjects with intermediate or high risk of TLS (per the risk definition in 
Section 6.8.1).  Except for C1D1, C1D2, and C1D3, t hese parameters may be ob tained within 72 hours prior to the planned day of collection.  
G Serum chemistry includes albumin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, BU N, calcium, carbon dioxide,  chloride, creatinine, glucose, inorganic phosphorus, 
potassium, total protein, LDH, ALT, AST, sodium, and uri c acid. 
H Urinalysis includes appearance, specific gravity and pH as well as  a semi-quantitative “dipstick” evaluation o f glucose, protein, biliru bin, ketones, leukocytes, 
and blood. Microscopic examination of sediment will be performed if ur inalysis is positive for WBC, proteins or blood. Urinalysis may be obtained within 
72 hours prior to the planned day of collection.  
I Pregnancy testing (serum or urine) will be required for women of c hildbearing potential (WCBP) only. Testing is required at S creening; within 72 hours of 
Day 1 of each cycle and at EOT. Test does not need to be repeated on C1D1 if baseli ne was negative and  conducted within 72 hours  of first dose. 
J Imaging as appropriate for disease indication will be conducted wit hin 30 days before C1D1. Suitable scans performed prior to Screening and within 30 days 
before first dose may be used for baseline tumor assessme nts. 
K Assessment of disea se status will be conducted with standard imaging as appropriate for indication. During treatment, scans will be repeated for tumor 
assessment within 7 days before C3D1, C5D1, C7D1, and then every 3 c ycles (12 weeks) until PD or use of alternative antineop lastic therapy.  
L Imaging at EOT is not required if PD has already been radiographica lly documented or last imaging was within 4 weeks of EOT visit. 
M Blood sampling for determination of the plasma concentrations and activity of LAM-002A and metabolites w ill be performed on C1D1 and C1D8 as follows: 
pre-dose, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours post -first dose of the day. Sampling on C1D15 will be pre-dose only. Subjects are required to come to the study site in 
a fasting state prior to the collection of certa in PK samples.  
N Bone marrow aspirates/biopsies performed within 2 months prior to fi rst dose may be used for  clinical baseline assessments. Baseline bone marrow 
biopsies/aspirates may be omitted if not deemed essential for re sponse assessment or patient management and there is another source of tumor tissue for 
pretreatment evaluation of gene expressi on and prognosis.  
O If necessary per applicable response criteria, a repeat bone marrow bio psy or aspirate will be required for su bjects who have a CR by imaging and PE 
p Fresh tumor tissue (preferred) or archival tissue from the most recent available biopsy or surgery (within 4 months prior to the start of screen ing) must be 
obtained pretreatment for nucleic acid extraction. For subjects undergoi ng a biopsy, adequate tumor tissue should be acquired via excisional biopsy, incisiona l 
biopsy or core needle biopsy (e.g., ≥  3 passes using a 16 -gauge core needle). Confirmation of  tumor in biopsy with fine needle aspirate, touch prep, or FFPE 
processing is requested when possible .  The tumor lesion selected should not have been previou sly irradiated and should not be an index lesion  that is 
followed for response assessment.  Alternatively, cells from a bone marrow aspirate may be obtained in subjects wit h bone marrow involvement due to NHL 
(≥50% of cells). Tissue will be submitted for evaluation of the per centage of tumor cells and analysis of genetic alterations and/or gene expression that may 
predict anti-lymphoma activity and/or pharmacodynamics activity. In addition, the fresh biopsy or tumor tissue from the  most recently availably biopsy or 
surgery will be evaluated for known prognostic characteristics (e. g., for DLBCL: ABC or GCB subtype; expression of BCL2, BCL6 , Ki-67, CD20, and 
MYC; other mutational status), for PDL1 status, and for immune  infiltration. The baseline biopsy procedure (if required) should ideally be performed af ter the 
study candidate has undergone the baseline radiology examination and is othe rwise considered eligible for study participation .

10.1. Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for the detection and doc umentation of events meeting the 
definition of an AE or SAE as provided in this protocol. Monitoring of AEs will be initiated 
upon treatment with LAM-002A . 
10.1.1.  Definitions 
10.1.1.1.  Adverse Events  
An AE is defined as any untow ard medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse 
experience) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a n abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally as sociated with the use of a 
drug, and does not imply any judgment about causality (i.e., whether or not consider ed related to 
the drug). An AE can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., use in combination with another drug) 
and with any route of administration, for mulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
Note that progressive disease should not be reported as an AE. In cases of SAEs, sites can use 
progressive disease if there are no alternative terms that can be satisfactorily substituted. In those 
cases, the AE can match the SAE.  
10.1.1.2.  Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Suspected adverse reactions are a subset of all AEs for which ther e is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the AE. Reasonable possibil ity means that there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser 
degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means  any AE caused by a drug. 
The investigator is responsible fo r determining whether there is a reasonable p ossibility that the 
drug caused the AE, and will capture the causality assessment in the eCRF. 
10.1.1.3.  Adverse Reaction  
An adverse reaction means any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of  all 
suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to co nclude the drug caused the event. 
10.1.1.3.1.  Unexpected 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it  is not listed in the 
investigator brochure (IB) or is not listed at the specificit y or severity that has been observed. 
The sponsor is respons ible for determining whether an event meets the definition of 
“unexpected,” based on adverse reactions listed in the A pilimod IB. Clinical Study Report

Version 9, 18 Feb 2020 
AI Therapeutics Confidential an d Proprietary Page 92 of 312 10.1.1.3.2.  Serious 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE 
− Note: An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-thr eatening” if, in the 
view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at 
immediate risk of de ath. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospitalization is a hospital admission that lasts more  than 24 hours or 
prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• Leads to congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Important medical events that may not result  in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization m ay be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and/or may require medical or s urgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result  in 
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
10.1.1.4.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) comprise TLS occurring in any study subject. Among 
study subjects receiving atezolizumab  the following treatment -emergent AEs will be considered 
AESIs: 
• AE suggestive of hypersensitivity, infusion- related reactions, c ytokine-release syndrome, 
influenza-like illness, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, or systemic immu ne 
activation 
• Autoimmune hemolytic anemia  
• Cardiac disorders Grade ≥ 2: atrial fibrillatio n, myocarditis, pericarditis 
• Colitis 
• Cutaneous reactions: St evens-Johnson syndrome, bullous dermatitis, toxic epidermal 
necrolysis 
• Drug-induced liver injury (Grade ≥ 3 serum ALT or AST increase in combination with a 
Grade ≥ 2 serum total bilirubin)  
• Endocrinopathy: diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, adrenal i nsufficiency, hyperthyroidism, 
or hypophysitis Clinical Study Report

AESIs will be described in narratives  as indicated in Section 10.6. 
10.2. Study Drug Related AE or SAE  
A study drug-related AE or SAE is defined as an AE or SAE that is relate d to the treatment with 
study drug. 
10.3. Further AE and SAE Definitions  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syn drome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified. However, if an observed or reported sign or sympt om is not 
considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by the investigator, it should be 
recorded as a separate AE . Laboratory data are to be collected as stipulated in this protocol. 
Clinical syndromes associated with laboratory abnormalities are to be recorded as appropriate 
(e.g., diabetes mellitus rather than hyperglycem ia). 
Scheduled hospitalizations or elective surgical procedures will not be considered as AEs or 
SAEs. Prolongation of a scheduled hospitalization can be considered an SAE as discussed in 
Section 10.1.1.3.2. Complications associated with scheduled procedur es are considered AEs or 
SAEs. Clinical Study Report

met: 
•The test finding is accompanied by cli nical symptoms
•The test finding necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or medical/surgical
intervention; including significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other
therapy. Note: simply repeating a test finding, in the absence of any of the ot her listed
criteria, does not con stitute an AE
•The test finding leads to a ch ange in study drug dosing or discontinuation of subject
participation in the clinical research study
•The test finding is considered an AE by the investigator
10.4. AE and SAE Assessment Criteria 
AEs and SAEs are evaluated and severity determined by the investigator. 
10.4.1.  Assessment of Causality 
The relationship between an AE and the study product will be determined by the investigator on 
the basis or his/her clinical judgment and the following definitions: 
10.4.1.1.  Related 
The AE follows a reasonable temporal  sequence from study drug administration, and cannot be 
reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state or other factors (e.g., disease under study, 
comorbid diseases, concomitant medications)  or is a known reaction to the drug under study or 
its chemical group, or is predicted by known pharmacology, or a known reaction to agent or 
chemical group. 
10.4.1.2.  Not Related 
The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence from study drug administration, or can be 
reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state or other factors (e.g., disease under study, 
comorbid diseases, a nd concomitant medications). 
10.4.2.  Grading of Severity 
Each AE or SAE will be graded for severity using the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.0. (NCI 2010) However for 
those events not listed in the NCI CTCAE, the following scale should be used: 
•Mild: Minor awareness of signs and symptoms that are easily tolerated without specific
medical intervention
•Moderate: Discomfort that interfe res with usual activities and may require minimal
intervention
•Severe: Significant signs or symptoms that are incapacitating with an inability to work or
perform routine activities and/or th at require medical int erventionClinical Study Report

10.5. Responsibilities and Procedures  
The responsibility for the safety of an individual subject lies in all  cases with the investigator. 
This includes the timely review of all safety data obt ained during the course of the study. An 
investigator must instruct his/her subjects to report any AE and SAEs they experience. 
Investigators capture, evaluate, and document all AEs and SAEs occu rring during a subject’s 
enrollment in the study, commencing with first treatment up to 30 days after the last dose of 
study drug on source documents and on designated eCRF pages. 
Investigators should assess AEs at each scheduled and non-scheduled visi t, by the use of 
open-ended questioning, physical examination, an d review of lab oratory results.  
Note: It is importa nt to record all AEs and SAEs that result in temporary and permanent 
discontinuation of study drug, regardless of severity. 
Investigators are required to promptly report all events to the Institutional Rev iew Board (IRB) 
according to the IRB’s reporting requ irements. 
10.6. SAE and AESI Reporting 
• The investigator is obligated to immediately report to  AI Therapeutics each SAE and each 
AESI that occurs during this investigation, within 24 hours from knowledge of the  event, 
whether or not it is consid ered study-drug related.  
• All requested supplementary documents (e.g., discharge summary, autopsy report) and 
relevant data (e.g., ECGs, laboratory tests, discharge summaries, post mortem results) must 
be faxed or emailed  within 24 hours to  
The information provided in a SAE or AESI report should be as complete as possible, but 
contain a minimum of the following: 
• A short description of the AE (diagnosis) and th e reason why the AE was categorized as an 
SAE or AESI 
• Subject identification and treatment  
• Investigator’s name and tele phone number (if applicable) 
• Name of the suspect medicinal product  and dates of adm inistration 
• Assessment of c ausality. 
If any questions or considerations regarding SAE or AESI report requirement s or report 
completion arise, the principal investigator/site staff should contact AI Therapeutics. Medically 
related questions or conc erns regarding treatment should be directed to the sponsor ’s medical 
monitor.  
If all information about the SAE or AESI is not yet known, the investigator will be required to 
report any additional information within 24 hours as it becomes available . SAEs and AESIs must 
be followed and reported upon until the event has com pletely resolved to G rade 0 or baseline or 
until the event becomes a new stable baseline c ondition for a subject. Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confidential an d Proprietary Page 96 of 312 All SAEs and AESIs will be evaluated by the sponsor ’s medical monitor  or designee.  
The investigators must notify their governi ng IRB of any SAEs in accordance with Section 18.1. 
For any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected (not  documented in the 
IB or package insert), an Investigational New Drug (IND) safety report or revision to the IB may 
be issued to inform all investigators involved in any study with LAM-002A. 
10.6.1.  Post-treatment Safety Follow -up 
In this study, all AEs occurring after first treatment will be captured on the eCRF. All subjects 
should be instructed to report AEs or SAEs occurring up to 30 days after the last dose of study 
drug. Unresolved study drug-r elated AEs and SAEs at the time of treatment discontinuation or 
new study-drug related AEs and SAEs that occur during the 30-day post dose tim e frame will be 
followed until they have, in the opinion of the investigator, resolved to baseline, have stabilized, 
or are deemed to be irreversible.  
10.7. Pregnancy Reporting 
Pregnancy occurring in a subject is not considered an AE. However, the investigator must 
capture pregnancy information for subject and/or subject’s partner (as applicable) on a pregnancy 
report form within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. Then the site 
• Completes the pregnancy form with as much infor mation as possible; however, at a 
minimum the subject identification number, name of product, and name of reporter is 
required; 
• Signs Pregnancy Notif ication form; and 
• FAX the form to  AI Therapeutics at .  
Subjects determined to be pregnant must be imm ediately removed from treatment  and will be 
followed by the investigator until termination of the pregnancy or deliver y of the child. 
Additional information on the course of the pregnancy should be sup plied on follow-up forms as 
it becomes availa ble and at minimum at termination or birth.  Clinical Study Report

Tumor response will be assessed in the Dose Escalation Stage and Expansion Sta ge using 
modified Lugano Response Criteria for NHL (Cheson 2014) and revised gui delines for the 
diagnosis and treatment of CLL (Hallek 2008, Cheson 2012) (see Appendix 2). 
Pretreatment tumor assessments will be performed within 30 days of the first dose (bone marrow 
assessment may be performed within 2 months prior to first dose) and will include diagnostic CT 
scans (with intravenous contract) or PET/CT for subjects with lymphoma (CT only for subjects 
with CLL/SLL), bone marrow aspirate/biopsy, complete blood counts and physical examination. 
It is anticipated that in most cases the PET and CT scans will be conducted using a  single 
instrument, i.e., as a PET/CT scan (CT scans should be performed using a contiguous 
reconstruction algo rithm of ≤ 5 mm). However, MRI is an acceptable alternative method for 
assessing disease in subjects who cannot receive intravenous contrast with CT scans. In such 
subjects MRI and PET scans will have to be obtained separately. Baseline bone marrow 
biopsies/aspirates may be omitted if not deemed essential for response assessment or patient 
management. 
During treatment, radiology studies will be performed for tumor assessments as indicated in 
Table 8: Schedule of Assessments (LAM-002A Continuous Monotherapy Administration), 
Table 9: Schedule of Assessments (LAM-002A Intermittent Monotherapy Administration ), 
Table 10: Schedule of Assessments (LAM-002A/Rituximab Combination Therapy ), and 
Table 11: Schedule of Assessments (LAM-002A/Atezolizumab Combination Therapy)  in 
Section 8.7 until PD or use of alternative antineoplastic therapy. If necessary per applicable 
response criteria , a repeat bone marrow biopsy or aspirate will be required for subjects who have 
a Complete Response (CR) by imaging and physical examination. Subjects with CLL/SLL who 
achieve CR will require assessment of minimal residual disease  (MRD) by flow cytometry of 
bone marrow and peripheral blood. Clinical Study Report

laboratory will measure plasma conc entrations of apilimod using a validated analytic method. 
PK parameters will be estimated using standard non- compartmental methods  will include: Cmax, 
tmax, AUC0-t, AUC τ; t½, trough concentrations on Days 8 and 15, and a comparison of AUC0-t 
from Days 1 and 8 or Days 1 and Day 10 (as appropriate) ; additional parameters may b e 
determined based on the available data. Accu mulation will be asses sed by calculating the 
accumulation ratios I for Cmax and AUC when comparing Day 8 to Day 1 for all continuous 
LAM-002A regimens (whether given as monotherapy or in combination) or when comparing 
Day 10 to Day 1 for the intermittent L AM-002A regimen. Dose proportionality for C max and 
AUC0-t will be assessed by applying an appropriate power model to t he data. Descriptive 
statistics of PK parameters  will include minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, percent 
coefficient of variation  (%CV), and range.  
Pharmacokinetic samples will b e collected for determination of plasma apilimod and active 
metabolite concentrations at the time points indicated in Table 13. All subjects must participate 
in PK assessments. Fasting st atus must be recorded at the time of each PK blood draw. Clinical Study Report

For subjects with NHL, fresh tumor tissue (preferred) or archival tissue from the most recent 
available biopsy or surgery ( within 4 months prior to the start of screenin g) must be obtained 
pretreatment. For subjects undergoing a biop sy, adequate tumor tissue should be acquired via 
excisional biopsy, incisional biopsy or core needle biopsy (e.g ., ≥ 3 passes using a 16-gauge core 
needle). Confirmation of tumor in biopsy with fine needle aspirate, touch prep, or FF PE 
processing is requested when possible.  T he tumor lesion selected should not have been 
previously irradiated and should not be an index lesion that is followed for response assessment.  
Alternatively, cells from a bone marrow aspirate may be obtained in subjects with bone marrow 
involvement due to NHL (>50% NHL cells) . Tissue will be submitted for evaluation of the 
percentage of tumor c ells and analysis of genetic alterations and/or gene expression that may 
predict anti-lymphoma activity and/or pharmacodynamics activity. In addition, tumor may be  
evaluated for known prognostic characteristics (e.g., for DLBCL: AB C or GCB subtype; 
expression of BCL2, BCL6, Ki-67, CD20, and MYC; other mutational status), for PDL 1 status, 
and for immune infiltration .  
Subjects with CLL/SLL must prov ide either a fresh blood sample containing circulating tumor 
cells or a bone marrow aspirate sample pretreatmen t. Tissue will be submitted for evaluation of 
the percentage of tumor cells and analysis of genetic alterations  and/or gene expression that may 
predict anticancer activity and/or pharmacodyna mic activity. In addition, for subjects with 
CLL/SLL, the sponsor may arrange for a portion of the samp le to be evaluated at a 
sponsor-specified laboratory for known prognostic markers (e.g., quantitative im munoglobulins, 
FISH panel [chromosome 11q deletion, 13q deletion, 17p deletion and 12 trisomy], DNA 
mutational ana lysis for p53, IgHV [including IgHV3-21], and other genes of interest in C LL 
[e.g., Notch]; flow cytometry [for CD5, CD10, CD11c, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD38, CD45, 
kappa and lambda light chains and ZAP- 70], and/or β2-microglobulin).  
A saliva sample will be obtained during Screening as a normal-tissue control for gene mutation 
studies in tumors. Clinical Study Report

14.1. Determination of Sample Size
14.1.1.  Dose Escalation Stage (Stage 1) 
The planned sample size for the dose-escalation is not based on a specific statistical hypothesis 
but on experience in the conduct of similar trials in subjects with c ancer.  
In the dose escalation, the cohort sizes of 3 to 6 subjects allow eva luation of regimen safety using 
a standard definition of MTD (ie, a starting dose associated with DLT in <33 % of subjects 
during the first cycle of therapy). Based on the planned 3+3 do se-escalation scheme, Table 14 
shows the probability of esca lating to the next dose level or proceeding to the next stage, based 
on the true rate of DLT at the current dose level.  
Table 14: Statistical Basis for 3+3 Dose-Escalation Paradigm  
True Incidence of DLT  Probability of Escalating  
10% 0.91 
20% 0.71 
30% 0.49 
40% 0.31 
50% 0.17 
60% 0.08 
Abbreviation:  DLT=dose-limiting toxicity  
Thus, if the true underlying proportion of DLT is low (eg, ≤10% at the current dose level, there 
is a high probability ( ≥0.91) of dose escalation to the next dose level. Conversely, if the true 
underlying proportion of DLT is high (eg, ≥60%) at the current dose level, there is a low 
probability ( ≤0.08) of escalation to the next dose level.  
14.1.2.  Cohort Expansion Stage (Stage 2) 
As indicated in Section 6.1.2, expansion cohorts of 6 subjects will be accrued. Enrollment of 
6 subjects per cohort offers the opportunity to determine if there is any antitumor activity 
sufficient to warrant further development in the selected tumor types. An ORR of ≥ 35% is 
considered of potential interest in each of the selected indications. If 0/6 subjects in a cohort 
experience an objective response, then a popul ation ORR of ≥ 35% for that cancer can be 
excluded with > 90% certainty (1-sided exact binomial 90% CI upper bound = 32%). 
Based on the observation of objective responses among study subj ects with FL receiving either 
LAM-002A monotherapy or LAM-002A/rituximab, expanded accrual of subjects with relapsed 
FL is planned to evaluate the level of activity with these 2 regimens. Preference will be given to 
enrolling subjects to receive LAM-002A monotherapy before enrolling subjects to receive 
LAM-002A/rituximab.  
Based on historical data with other treatments (Zelenetz 2014), it is known that an ORR of 
< 20% in subjects with relapsed FL receiving LAM-002A  monotherapy would be uninteresting 
while achieving a target ORR of ≥ 40% would suggest that further development is warranted. 
Sequential boundaries will be used to continuously moni tor that the ORR is ≥ 40% while Clinical Study Report

result with this testing would conclude with 95% confidence that the actual ORR is ≥ 20%. 
Accrual of up to ~20 evaluable subjects will be considered with the potential to stop accrual 
early if the boundary is crossed. Thus, accrual can be considered sufficient if the following n/N 
values are observed: 4/5, 4/6, 4/7, 5/8, 5/9, 5/10, 5/11, 6/11, 6/12, 6/13, 6/14, 7/15, 7/16, 7/17, 
8/18, 8/19, 8/20. F or all these values, the ORR is ≥ 40% with a lower 1-sided binomial 
confidence bound of ≥ 20%. 
As noted above, the target ORR with LAM-002A alone is ~40%. Adding rituximab or rituximab 
hyaluronidase human to LAM-002A would be expected to e nhance the ORR over that associated 
with single-agent LAM-002A. Thus, the combination of LAM-002A/rituximab could warrant 
further development if an ORR of ≥ 60% could be targeted in preference to an ORR of < 40%.  
Accordingly, for combination therapy, s equential boundaries will be used to continuously 
monitor that the ORR is ≥ 60% while excluding an ORR of 39% using a 1-sided test with a 
significance level  of 0.05. A significant result with  this testing would conclude with 95% 
confidence that the actual ORR is > 39%. Accrual of up to ~20 evaluable subjects will be 
considered with the potential to stop accrual early if the boundary is crossed. Thus, accrual can 
be considered suffici ent if the following n/N values are observed: 7/10, 8/11, 8/12, 9/13, 9/14, 
10/15, 10/16, 11/17, 11/18, 12/19, 12/20. F or all these values, the ORR is ≥ 60% with a lower 
1-sided binomia l confidence bound of ≥ 39%.
Experience indic ates the rates of discontinuations from r ituximab or atezolizumab therapy a re    
< 5% (Genentech 2016 , Genentech 2017). A rate of AE discontinuations of t herapy due to 
adverse events of ≥25 % in the 2 combination therapy groups of LAM-002A /rituximab (N = 12) 
or LAM-002A/atezolizumab (N = 12) would suggest a potential adverse interaction among the 
components of the combination therapy. Sequential Pocock-type boundaries will be used to 
continuously monitor the rate of AE discontinuations and to test the null hypothesis, after each 
subject, that the event rate is ≥ 0.25 using a 1-sided significance test of ~ 0.05. AE 
discontinuation rates will be considered excessive if the following n /N values are observed: -/1, 
-/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/5, 4/6, 5/ 7, 5/8, 5/9, 6/10, 6/11, 7/12. With this method, the probability of 
detecting an AE discontinuation safety signal r anges from 0.091 to >0.820 f or true 
discon tinuation rates of 25% to ≥  60%. If excessive levels of AE discontinuation are observed, 
the sponsor, working in collaboration with the cooperating companies and investigators,  will 
take appropriate actions (eg, continuation of the cohort w ith modifications in design or 
monitoring plan, interruption of cohort a ccrual, cohort therapy discontinuation) . 
14.1.3.  Extension Stage (Stage 3) 
The sample size in the extension stage of the study will be no higher than the total number of 
subjects on study therapy on the data cutoff date that concludes the dose-escalation and 
expansion stages of the clinical trial.

dropouts, or other reasons, the data will be analyzed based on reduced denom inators.  
Results will be summarized by dose cohorts. 
14.3. Analysis Sets 
14.3.1.  Full Analysis Set  
The full analysis set includes all subjects who receive ≥  1 dose of study drug. This analysis set 
will be used in the analyses of subject characteristics, study drug administration and compliance, 
safety, and cate gorical and time -to-event efficacy outcomes. I n analyses of response rates in the 
full analysis set, subjects who do not have sufficient baseline and on-st udy tumor assessments to 
characterize response ( i.e., have a best overall response of NE) will be cou nted as failures. 
14.3.2.  Responding Analysis Set  
The responding analysis set includes subjects in the full analysis set w ho have measurable 
disease, who can be evaluated for tumor response with both baseline and on- study tumor 
evaluations, and who achieve a CR, CRi, or PR. This analysis set wil l be used in the analyses of 
time to response and duration of response. 
14.3.3.  Evaluable Analysis Sets 
The evaluable analysis sets include subjects in the full analysis s et who have th e necessary 
baseline and on-study measurements to provide interpretable results for specific parameters of 
interest. These analysis sets will be used in the analyses of c hanges in tumor dimensions, PK 
parameters, and pharmacodynamic parameters.  
14.4. Demographics and Baseline Disease Characteristics

treatment) 
• Changes in laboratory test results  
• Changes in vital signs including blood pressure, pulse, and temperature 
• Changes in electrocardiogram results  
Adverse events will be coded using the latest available version of the  Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDR A). Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as AEs that start on or 
after the first dose of study drug and within approximately 30 days of the  last administration of 
study drug. Adverse events will be summarized by the number and percentage of subjects who 
experienced the event, according to system organ class and preferred te rm. A subject reporting 
multiple cases of the same AE will be counted once within each system organ class and similarl y 
counted once within ea ch preferred term.  
Unless specified otherwise, the denominator for these calculations will be based on the number 
of subjects in each cohort who received at least one administration of  LAM-002A irrespective of 
the total number of doses or treatment cycles administered. These conventions will be 
appropriately modified to calculate AE incidence rates separately for each cycl e that study 
therapy is administered.  
AEs will also be summarized by NCI -CTCAE Version 4.0 severity grade and by relationship to 
each study drug. Additional summaries may also be provided for SAEs, and events  resulting in 
the permanent discontinuation of therapy. All AEs will be included in individual s ubject listings. 
The changes in hematology, chemistry, and other laboratory values will be summarized 
descriptively for each scheduled and unscheduled protocol assessment tim e point. Changes will 
be calculated relative to the values collected at baseline and on the fi rst day of each cycle of 
treatment.  
The incidence of DLT will be provided b y treatment cycle and across all treatment cycl es. The 
toxicity grades for laboratory tests will be based on NCI- CTCAE Version 4.0 criteria. Subject 
listings of all laboratory data collected during the study will be pre sented. Laboratory values 
outside normal limits will be identified in the subject li stings and will include flags for high and 
low values. 
Vital sign results (blood pressure, pulse, respirations, and temperatur e) will be summarized 
descriptively for each scheduled and unscheduled protocol time point. Changes will be 
calculated relative to  the assessments at baseline and on the first day of each cycle of therapy. 
14.8. Biomarkers 
Descriptive statistics will be primarily used to summarize the biomarker and other laboratory 
data generated in this study. For continuous variables, the number of subjects  with non-missing 
data, mean, either the st andard error or standard deviation, median, 25th percentile (first quartile), 
75th percentile (third quartile), minimum, and maximum will be presented. For discrete data, the 
frequency and percent distribution w ill be presented.  Clinical Study Report

changes in biomarker levels. Additionally, correlations may be assessed by calculating 
Spearman’s correlation coefficient between pairs of biomarkers or other parameters. 
14.9. Efficacy Analysis 
The tumor response will be assessed by the modified cr iteria for NHL ( Cheson 2014) and revised 
guidelines for the diagnosis and trea tment of CLL ( Hallek 2008, Cheson 2012) (see Appendix 2). 
The objective response rate will  be estimated for each dose escalation cohort and each expanded 
cohort. The estimate of the objective response rate will  be calculated based on the maximum 
likelihood estimator (i.e., crude proportion of subjects whose best overall response is CR or 
partial remission  [PR]). The estimate of the objective response rate will be accompanied by 
2-sided 95% exact binomial confidence intervals.
The duration of objective response will be calculated for subjects who achieve CR or PR. For 
such subjects, the duration of objective response is defined as the number of days from the start 
date of PR or CR (whichever response is achieved first) to the first date that progressive disease 
is objectively documented. The duration of objective response will be right-censored for subjects 
who achieve CR or PR and meet 1 of the following conditions: 1) non-protocol anticancer 
treatment started before documentation of disease progression, 2) death or documented disease 
progression after more than 1 missed disease assessment visit, or 3) alive and does not have 
documentation of disease progression before a data analysis  cutoff date.  
The duration of objective response will be summarized descriptively using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. The 50th percentile of the Kaplan-Meier distribution will be used to estimate the median 
response duration. 
Progression-free survival (PFS) will be measured as from the date of enrollment to the date of 
documented progression or death (whatever the cause). Subjects who are alive and progression 
free at last follow-up (up to a year from first treatment at Cycle 1 day 1) will be censored. Those 
who start another anticancer treatment without evidence of progression will be censored at start 
date of the new therapy. 
The PFS will be summarized descriptively using the Kaplan-Meier method. The 50th percentile 
of the Kaplan-Meier distribution will be used to estimate the median PFS of each cohort of 
subjects. 
14.10.  Interim Analysis 
Dose escalation decisi on will be made as outlined based on available safety and available 
PK/pharmacodynamic information. N o statistical analyses are planned to aid the dose escalation 
decision.

1.LYMPHOMA
1.1. Tumor Assessm ent Criteria 
The determination of response and progression  for subject with NHL will be based 
on standardized criteria (Cheson 2014 ). 
1.2. Method of Assessment  
Imaging-based evaluation will be used in this study as the primary basis of lymphoma 
assessment. CT scan is the preferred metho d for radiographic tumor assessment. Contra st-
enhanced scanning is preferred, bu t contrast material may be omitted in subjects for whom use of 
a contrast agent becomes medically contraindicated or if CT scanning is done in c onjunction 
with PET. If availabl e, PET scan data will be considered in resp onse and progression assessment; 
however, PET scanning will not be a required component of as sessment in this s tudy. As 
necessary, bone marrow aspirate/biopsy (e.g., for confirmation of CR) or cytological/histolog ical 
evaluation of lymph nodes, effusions, ascites, or other organ abnormaliti es) will be also be 
considered. Clinical palpation, chest x-ray, ultrasound, endoscopy, laparoscopy, ra dionuclide 
scan, or tumor markers will not be considered for response assessment. MR I scanning is not 
advised but may be used at the investigator’s discr etion in subjects for whom this becomes a 
necessary alter native to CT scanni ng. 
For radiographic assessments, the same me thod of assessment and the same technique (e.g., scan 
type, scanner, subject position, dose of contrast, inj ection/scan interval) should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported le sion at baseline an d during study treatment and 
follow-up. CT of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed with c uts of 
≤ 0.5 mm in slice thickness c ontiguously. If performed, whole-body F DG PET-CT scanning 
should be extended from the base of the skull to mid -thigh. 
All relevant radiographic and clinical information required to make each tumor status assessment 
must be made available for source verification as  requested by the study sponsor. 
1.3. Timing of Assessments 
During screening, clinical and imaging-based tumor assessments should be performed within the 
specified screening period. On-study tumor assessments should be perform ed as stipulated in 
Section 8.7. An end-of-therapy tumor assessment should be performed unless the subject already 
has radiographic confirmation of disease progression ≤ 4 weeks prior to study drug 
discontinuation. If a subject permanently discontinues t reatment prior to o bjective documentation 
of lymphoma progression, investigators should ideally continue further follow-up of tumor status 
with assessments a t ~12-week intervals until disease progression is documented or until the 
initiation of a new post-study therapy for the sub ject’s lymphoma.  Clinical Study Report

1.4.1.  Index Lesions 
Up to 6 lesions (e.g., lymph nodes, liver or spleen nodules, and/or other circumsc ribed 
extranodal masses) should be sele cted as index lesions that will be used to quantitate the status of 
the disease during study treatment. Ideally, the index lesi ons should be located in dispa rate 
regions of the body and include mediastinal, abdominal, and retrope ritoneal areas of disease 
whenever these sites are involved. For sub jects with FDG -avid lymphomas undergoing PET, 
selection of FDG-avid lesions is preferred. 
Index lesions will be mea sured and recorded at baseline and at the stipulated intervals during 
treatment. The largest cross -sectional dimensions (i.e., the LD × LPD will be recorded (in  cm) 
for each index lesion. Using the LD and LPD, the product of the perpendicular diam eters (PPD) 
for each index lesion will be calculated. The PPDs and the SPDs for al l index lesions will be 
calculated and reco rded. The baseline and nadir PPDs of individual lesion s and the baseline and  
nadir SPDs will be used as referen ces by which objective tumor response and prog ression will be 
characterized during treatment. All PPD and SPD measurements will b e reported in centimeters 
squared. 
1.4.2.  Nodal Index Lesions  
A nodal mass may be selected as a nod al index lesion if it is both abnorm al and measurable at 
baseline. A lymph node l esion is considered abnormal if it has a single diameter  that is > 1.0 cm 
and is considered  measurable if it has 2 perpendicular diameters that can be  accurately measured 
in cross section with the LD being ≥ 1.0 cm and the LPD also being ≥ 1.0 cm.  
Abnormal, measurable nodal lesions will be subcategorized as ei ther large or small.  
• Large nodal lesions h ave an LD that is >  1.5 cm and an LPD that is ≥ 1.0 cm.  
• Small nodal lesions  have an LD that is >  1.0 cm and ≤ 1.5 cm and an LPD that is 
> 1.0 cm. 
Index lesions measuring > 1.5 cm in the LD, regardless of the meas urement of the LPD, will be 
prioritized during baseline index lesion selection. 
At follow-up timepoints, the PPDs for individual nodal lesions and the SPD of all nodal index 
lesions will be considered. Because nodal index lesions that have one or both diameters > 0 cm 
and < 1.0 cm cannot be reliably measured, a defau lt value of 1.0 cm will be assig ned for each 
diameter that meets these criteria and the resu lting PPD will be used in SPD  calculations. Based 
on this convention, a CR may be achieved even if an SPD value is >  0 cm2 (i.e., if all lymph 
nodes measure < 1.0 cm2). 
New or enlarging nodal lesions that are still ≤ 1.0 cm by ≤ 1.0 cm will not be considered to 
represent recurrent or PD. A new node th at measures > 1.5 cm in any diameter or a new node 
that measures > 1.0 cm to ≤ 1.5 cm in the LD and measures > 1.0 cm in the LPD will be 
considered PD. 
In cases in which a lar ge lymph node mass has split into multiple components, only those 
elements that a re > 1.0 cm in ≥ 1 diameter will be considered abnormal and used in calculating Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confidential an d Proprietary Page 126 of 312 the SPD. Components that are ≤ 1.0 cm in the LD are assumed to be normal lymph node 
structures. PD will not be based on the growth of a lesion sub-component unt il it meets the 
criteria for abnormal. Lesion sub- components that are ab normal (> 1.0 cm in ≥ 1 diameter) will 
have the true PPDs calc ulated with the result used only for calculating an accurate nadir. Lesion 
subcomponents that are normal ( ≤ 1.0 cm in the LD) will have the default PPD of 1.0 cm2 
(1.0 cm x 1.0 cm) stored only for the purposes of calculating the nadir va lue.  
If lesions merge, a boundary between the lesions will be established so the LD of eac h individual 
lesion can continue to be measured. If the lesions have merged in a wa y that they can no longer 
be separated by this boundary, the newly merged lesion w ill be measured bid imensionally. 
1.4.3.  Extranodal Index Lesions  
An extranodal mass may be selected as an index lesion if it is both abnormal and m easurable at 
baseline. An extranodal mass of any size is considered abno rmal. It is considered meas urable at 
baseline if it has 2 perpendicular diameters that can be accurately measured in cross section wit h 
the LD being ≥ 1.0 cm and the LPD also being ≥ 1.0 cm. 
At follow-up timepoints, the PPD of each single extranodal index lesion and the SP D of all 
extranodal index lesions will be con sidered. Because extranodal  index lesions that have one or 
both diameters < 0.5 cm and > 0 cm cannot be reliably measured,  a default value of 0.5 cm will 
be assigned for each diameter that meets  these criteria and the res ulting PPD will be used in SPD 
calculations. If an extranodal lesion is no longer clearly visible, it will be considered resolved 
and its PPD will be defined  as 0 cm2.  
If an extranodal lesion that had resolved (i.e., had a PPD of 0 cm2) subsequently reapp ears, the 
subject will be considere d to have PD. A new extranodal l esion of any size that appears at a site 
that was not previously involved with lymphoma and is discernible to the radi ologist by CT scan 
will be considered PD. 
1.4.4.  Non-Index Lesions  
Any other measurable and ab normal nodal or ext ranodal lesions not selected for quantitation as 
index lesions may be considered non-index lesions. In addition, non- measurable evidence of 
lymphoma such as abnormal, non- measurable nodal lesion s, extranodal lesions with both 
diameters < 1.0 cm, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis of the skin or lung, abdominal masses that are not c onfirmed and 
followed by imaging techniques, cystic lesions, previously irradiated lesions , or lesions with 
artifacts may be considered as non-index disease.  
If present at baseline, up to 6 non-index lesions should be recorded. Measure ments are not 
required.  
Non-index disease will be used as a general reference  to further characterize re gression or 
progression of lymphoma dur ing assessments of the objective tumor response during treatment. 
These lesions should be followed as “present” or “ab sent”. Clinical Study Report

Qualitative assessments of the sizes of the spleen and liver will be performed. In addition, the 
presence or absence of splenic nodules will be recorded.  
At baseline and follow-up timepoints, the spleen and liver size will be reported as normal, 
enlarged not due to lymphoma (no nodules present), enlarged due to lymphoma (≥ 1 nodule 
present), unequivocal increase not due to lymphoma (no nodules present), or unequivocal 
progression ( ≥ 1 nodule present) . For subjects with splenomegaly or  hepatomegaly at baseline or 
at the nadirs for assessments of spleen and liver , evaluations will consider only changes relative 
to the enlargement of the organ (i.e., the portion of the LVD that is > 12 cm by imaging for the 
spleen and > 18 cm in LVD for the liver) at baseline or nadir, not changes relative to the total 
splenic LVD. 
By imaging, the s pleen will be considered enlarged if it  is > 12 cm in LVD (Bezerra 2005, 
Asghar 2011), with the LVD being obtained by multiplying the number of sections on which the 
spleen is visualized by the thickness of the sections (e.g., if the spleen is seen in 14 contiguous 
cross-sectional images  with 0.5-cm thickness, the LVD is recorded as 7 cm). An increa se in 
splenic enlargement  by ≥ 50% (minimum increase of 2 cm) from nadir and the presence of  
≥ 1 splenic nodule is required for declaration of splenic progression. Subjects with a normal 
spleen LVD (i.e., a LVD of ≤ 0 cm by physical examination or ≤ 12 cm by imaging) at nadir will 
only be considered to have progressed if the spleen attains a LVD of > 14 cm by imaging and 
there is ≥ 1 splenic nodule. 
By imaging, the liver will be considered enlarged if it is > 18 cm in LVD (Erturk 2006). An 
increase in liver enlargement by ≥ 50% (minimum increase  of 2 cm) from nadir and the presence 
of ≥ 1 hepatic nodule is required for declaration of hepatic progression. Subjects with a normal 
liver LVD (i.e., a LVD of ≤ 18 cm by imaging) at nadir will only be considered to have 
progressed if the liver attains a LVD of > 20 cm by imaging and there is ≥ 1 hepatic nodule. 
1.4.6.  Bone Marrow 
Bone marrow assessments will be based on morphologic evaluation of bone m arrow biopsies. 
Immunohistochemistry may b e used to assess response if the sample is indeterminate by 
morphology.  
In a subject who has a baseline bone marrow biopsy showing bone m arrow lymphoma or does 
not have a baseline bone marrow examination, declaration of an on-study CR requires bone 
marrow biopsy documentation of the absence of bone marrow lymphoma. In a subje ct who has a 
baseline bone marrow biopsy showing no evidence o f lymphoma, declaration of an on-study CR 
does not require bone marrow examination as long as other criteria f or CR are met. Of note, in 
subjects with an FDG-PET avid lymphoma, declaration of an on-study CR ca n be based on 
FDG-PET documentation of the abse nce of bone marrow involvement, even if a bone marrow 
biopsy is not performed or not available.

who has a lymph node biopsy indicating transformation to an aggressive lymphoma w ill be 
considered to have PD even in the absence of other evidence of PD. If the subject has no earli er 
objective documentation of PD, the dat e of the lymph node biopsy will be considered the date of 
PD.  
1.5. Definitions of Tumor Response and Progression  
Responses will be categorized as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease 
(SD), or progressive disease (PD). In addition, a re sponse category of nonevaluable (NE) is 
provided for situations in which there is inadequate information to otherw ise categorize response 
status.  
The best overall response will be determined. T he best overall respo nse is the best on- treatment 
response from baseline recorded from the start of treatment until PD/recurrence. Th e baseline 
measurement will be taken as a reference  for determinations of response. The nadir measurement 
will be taken as a reference for PD; t his measurement constitutes the smallest me asurement 
recorded, including the baseline measurement if this is the smalles t measurement. For FDG -avid 
tumors, metabol ic criteria for response by PET -CT will take precedence over anatomic cr iteria 
for response by contrast CT when assessing CR. 
1.5.1.  Complete Response 
To satisfy criteria for CR, all of the following conditions must be  attained: 
• No evidence of new disease 
• Regress ion of all index nodal lesions to normal size (≤  1.5 cm in the LD for no des 
that were conside red large at baseline and ≤  1.0 cm in the LPD for nodes that were 
considered small at baseline) (see Section 1.4.2 for definitions of large and small 
nodes) 
• Regression to normal of all nodal non-index disease  
• Disappearance of all detectable extranodal index and non-index disease 
• Normal spleen and liver size by imaging studies, no hepatic or splenic l ymphoma 
nodules, and no new liver or spleen enlargement 
• Morphologically negative bone marrow based on an adequate unilateral core biopsy 
(> 20 mm unilateral core); if the sample is indeterminate by morphol ogy, it should be 
negative by immunohistochemistry  
• If PET performed, no  evidence of residual disease – i.e., score of 1 (no uptake above 
background), 2 (uptake ≤ mediastinum), or 3 (uptake > mediastinum but ≤  liver) on 
the Deauville 5 -point scale. 
• Negative for bone marrow involvement by PET for a PET-avid tumor or b y an 
adequate unilateral core biopsy (>  20 mm unilateral core); if the bone marrow biopsy 
is indeterminate by morphology, it should be negative by immunohistochemistry. Clinical Study Report

To satisfy criteria for PR, all of the following conditions must be  attained: 
• No evidence of new disease 
• A ≥ 50% decrease from baseline in the SPD of the index nodal and extranodal  lesions  
• No increase from the nadir in the size of non -index disease 
• No increase from the nadir in the size of the liver or spleen a nd no new liver or sple en 
enlargement 
• If PET performed:  
− Typically FDG-avid lymphoma: if no base line PET scan or if the PET scan was 
positive before therapy, the on- treatment PET is positive in ≥ 1 previously 
involved site– i.e., score of 4 (uptake moderately > liver) or score of  5 (uptake 
markedly > liver) on the Deauville 5-point scale but with red uced uptake 
compared with baseline . If baseline PET was performed and was negative, there is 
no new PET evidence of disease. 
− Variably FDG-avid lymphoma/FDG-avidity unknown: if no pretr eatment PET 
scan or if the pretreatment PET scan was negative for lymphoma, CT criteria 
should be used in assessing the tumor during treatment. If the PET scan was 
positive before therapy, the on- treatment PET is positive in ≥ 1 previously 
involved site. 
• Persistence of bone marrow involvement in a subject who meets other criteria for CR 
based on the disappearance of all nodal and extranodal masses 
1.5.3.  Stable Disease  
To satisfy criteria for SD, all of the following conditions must be  attained: 
• No evidence of new disease 
• Neither sufficient tumor shrinkage from baseline to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
evidence of tumor growth to qualify for PD 
• If PET-CT performed, the results show a score of 4 (uptake moderately > liver) or 
score of 5 (uptake markedly > liver) on the Deauville 5 -point scale with no significant 
change in uptake compared with baseline. 
1.5.4.  Progressive Disease  
The occurrence of any of the following events indicates progressive dis ease (PD): 
• Evidence of any new disease that was not present at baseline:  
− A new node that measures > 1.5 cm in any diameter  
− A new node that measures > 1.0 cm to ≤ 1.5 cm in the LD and > 1.0 cm in the

Note: Study subjects undergoing PET for lymphoma assessment can experienc e transient 
disease flare on imaging before having subsequent therapy -induced tumor regression. 
Worsening of constitutional symptoms or performance status in the absence  of objective 
evidence of worsening lymphoma (e.g.,  due to infection) may not represent  definitive disease 
progression. Further, transient worsening of disease  during temporary interruptions of study 
therapy (e.g.,  for drug -related toxicity or inter -current illness) may not indicate definitive 
progressive lymphoma. If there is uncertainty regarding whether there is  true lymphoma 
progression and if medically appropriate, the subject may continue or resume stu dy treatment 
and remain under close observation (e.g.,  evaluated at 3 - to 6- week intervals) while relevant 
radiographic, clinical, and/or  laboratory assessments are performed to document whether 
tumor control can be maintained or whether disease progression has truly occurred. If 
subsequent evaluations suggest that the subject has experienced persist ent definitive disease 
progression, then the date of progression will be the timepoint at which progress ion was f irst 
objectively documented.

2.1. Tumor Assessment Criteria
The determination of CLL/SLL response and progression will be based on standardized criteria 
(Hallek 2008), as recently updated (Cheson 2012).  
2.2. Method of Assessment  
In addition to clinical examination, imaging -based evaluation will be used in this study in all 
subjects enrolled. CT scan is the preferred method for radiographic t umor assessment. MRI 
scanning may be used at the investigator’s discretion in subjects for w hom this may be a 
preferred alternative to CT scanning; however, if MRI is performed, a non-contrast CT of the 
chest should be performed. Contrast-enhanced scanning is preferred, but iodine- containing or 
gadolinium contrast material may be omitted in subjects for whom use of a contrast agent would 
be medically contrain dicated. Chest x-ray, ultrasound, endoscopy, laparoscopy, PET, 
radionuclide scans, or tumor markers will not be considered for respons e assessment. Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confidential an d Proprietary Page 132 of 312 For radiographic evaluations, the same method of assessment and the sam e technique (e.g., scan 
type, scanner, subject position, dose of contrast, injection/scan interval)  should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and dur ing study treatment and 
follow-up. However, if a subject is imaged without contrast at basel ine, subsequent assessments 
should be performed with contrast, unless the subject canno t tolerate the contrast.  
All relevant clinical and radiographic information required to make e ach tumor status assessment 
must be made available for source verification as requested b y the study sponsor. 
2.3. Timing of Assessments  
During screening, clinical, laboratory, and imaging-based tumor assessmen ts should be 
performed within the specified screening period. Clinical tumor asses sments should be 
performed at each designated clinical vis it. On-study CT/MRI tumor assessments should be 
performed as indicated i n Section 8.7. An end-of-study CT/MRI tumor assessment should be 
performed unless the subject already has radiographic confirmation of di sease progression 
≤ 4 weeks prior. If a subject permanently discontinues study drug prior to objective 
documentation of CLL/SLL progression, investigators should optimally attempt  to obtain further 
follow-up at ~12-week intervals until CLL/SLL progression is documente d or until the initiation 
of a new post-study therapy for the subject’s CLL/SL L.  
2.4. Identification and Measurement of Tumor Lesions and 
Organomegaly  
2.4.1.  Index Lesions  
At baseline, up to 6 lymph nodes should be selected as index lesions that wi ll be used to 
quantitate the status of the disease during study treatment. Ideally, the index lesions should be 
located in disparate regions of the body. Only peripheral nodes need be sel ected as index lesions. 
However, it is optimal if mediastinal and retroperiton eal areas of disease are assessed whenever 
these sites are involved.  
Index lesions will be measured and recorded at baseline and at the stipulated intervals.  The cross-
sectional dimensions (the largest cross- sectional diameter, i.e., the LD × LPD) will be recorded 
(in cm) for each index lesion. The product of the perpendicular diameters (PPD)  (in cm2) for 
each index lesion and SPD (in cm2) for all index lesions will be calculated and recorded. The 
baseline SPD will be used as references by which objective t umor response will be characterized 
during treatment. The nadir LD of individual lesions and the nadir SPD w ill be used as 
references by which CLL/SLL progression will be characterized. All LD and LPD diameters will 
be reported in centimeters and all PPDs and SPDs will be reported in centimeters squared. 
A nodal mass may be se lected as a noda l index lesion if it is both abnormal and measurable at 
baseline. A lymph node lesion is considered abnormal if it has a single  diameter that is > 1.5 cm 
and is considered measurable if it has 2  perpendicular diameters that can be accuratel y measured 
in cross section with the LD being ≥ 1.0 cm and the LPD also being ≥ 1.0 cm. 
Index lesions measuring > 1.5 cm in the LD, regardless of the measure ment of the LPD, will be 
prioritized during baseline index lesion selection. Clinical Study Report

Version 9, 18 Feb 2020 
AI Therapeutics Confidential an d Proprietary Page 133 of 312 At follow-up timepoints, the LDs for individual lesions and the SPD of all nodal i ndex lesions 
will be considered. Because nodal index lesions that have one or both diame ters > 0 cm and 
< 1.0 cm cannot be r eliably measured, a default value of 1.0 cm will be assigned for each 
diameter that meet s these criteria and the resulting PPD will be used in SPD calcu lations. Based 
on this convention, a CR may be achieved even if an SPD value is > 0 cm2, (i.e., if all lymph 
nodes measure <  1.0 cm2). 
A new node that measures > 1.5 cm in any diameter or a new node that measures >  1.0 cm to 
≤ 1.5 cm in the LD and measures >  1.0 cm in the LPD will be considered progressive disease. 
In cases in which a large lymph node mass has split into multiple c omponents, only those 
elements that are > 1.0 cm in ≥ 1 diameter will be considered abnormal and used in calculating 
the SPD. Progression of the lesion can only be based on the SPD of abnorma l sub-components. 
Lesion sub-components t hat are considered normal but measurable will have the true PPDs 
calculated, with the result used only for calculating an accurate nadir. Sim ilarly, lesion sub-
components that are visible but neither abnormal nor measurable will ha ve the default PPD of 
1.0 cm2 (1.0 cm × 1.0 cm) stored only for the purposes of calculating the nadir SPD value . 
If lesions merge, a boundary between the lesions will be established so the LD of each individual 
lesion can continue to be measured. If the lesions have merged in a wa y that they can no longer 
be separated by this boundary, the newly merged lesion will be measured bi-dimensionally. 
2.4.2.  Spleen and Liver  
Both the spleen and liver will be assessed by CT/MRI scan and by physical examination at 
baseline and at the stipulated intervals during treatment. The baseline and nadir values for the 
longest vertical dimension  (LVD) of each organ will be used as reference to further characterize 
the objective tumor response of the measurable dimensions of the CLL/SLL during treatment. 
All spleen and liver LVD measurements should be recorded in centimeters. 
Physical examination  of the spleen should comprise assessment of its LVD below the left costal 
margin by palpation. By physical examination, the spleen will be considered enlarged if it is 
palpable below the left costal margin. If the spleen is not palpable below the left costal margin,  it 
should be assigned a value of 0 cm for physical examination assessment. By imaging, the spleen 
will be considered enlarged if it is > 12 cm in LVD (Bezerra 2005, Asghar 2011), with the LVD 
being obtained by multiplying the number of sections on which the spleen is visualized by the 
thickness of the sections (e.g., if the spleen is seen in 14 contiguous cross-sectional images  with 
0.5-cm thickness, the LVD is recorded as 7 cm).  
For subjects with splenomegaly at baseline or at the splenic LVD nadir, respective response and 
progression evaluations of the spleen will consider only changes relative to the enlargement of 
the spleen (i.e., the portion of the LVD that is > 0 cm by physical examination or > 12 cm by 
imaging) at baseline or nadir, not changes relative to the total splenic LVD.  
A 50% decrease from baseline (minimum  decrease of 2 cm) in the enlargement of the spleen in 
its LVD or to ≤ 12 cm by imaging, or regression to a spleen LVD of ≤ 0 cm by physical 
examination, is required for declaration of a splenomegaly response. Conversely, an increase in 
splenic enlargement  by ≥ 50% (minimum incre ase of 2 cm) from nadir is required for declaration 
of splenic progression. Subjects with a normal spleen LVD (i.e.,  a LVD of ≤ 0 cm by physical Clinical Study Report

spleen attains a LVD of > 14 cm by imaging or > 2 cm by physical exam. 
Physical examination of the liver should comprise assessment of its LVD at the right 
midclavicular line by percussion. By physical examination, the liver will be considered enlarged 
if it is > 15 cm in LVD as assessed by percussion (Walker 1990). By imaging, t he liver will be 
considered enlarged if it is > 18 cm in LVD (Erturk 2006). 
A 50% decrease (minimum  decrease of 2 cm) from baseline in the enlargement of the liver in its 
LVD or to ≤ 18 cm by imaging, or regression to a liver LVD of ≤ 15 cm by physical 
examination, is required for declaration of a hepatomegaly response. Conversely, an increase in 
liver enlargement by ≥ 50% (minimum increas e of 2 cm) from nadir is required for declaration of 
hepatic progression. Subjects with a normal liver LVD (i.e., a LVD of ≤ 15 cm by physical 
examination or ≤ 18 cm by imaging) at nadir will only be considered to have progressed if the 
liver attains a LVD of > 20 cm by imaging or > 17 cm by physical exam. 
2.4.3.  Non-Index Lesions  
Any other measurab le and abnormal nodal lesions not selected for quantitation as index le sions 
may be considered non-index lesions. In addition, non- measurable evidence of CLL/SLL such a s 
nodal lesions with both diameters < 1.0 cm, extranodal lesions, bone lesions , leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusions, lymphangitis of the skin or lung, abdominal 
masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques, cystic lesions, previously 
irradiated lesions, and lesions with artifac ts may be considered as non -index disease. 
The presence or absence of non -index disease should be recorded at baseline and at the stipulated 
intervals during treatment. If present at b aseline, up to 6 non-index lesions should be recorded. 
The non-index dis ease at baseline  will be used as a general reference to further characterize 
regression or progression of CLL/SLL during assessments of the objec tive tumor response 
during treatment. Measurements are not required and these lesions shoul d be followed as 
“present” or “absent”.  
2.5. Definitions of Tumor Response and Progression 
Responses will be categorized as complete response (CR), partial res ponse (PR), stable disease 
(SD), or progressive disease (PD). In addition, a response category of non evaluable (NE) is 
provided for situations in which there is inadequate information to otherw ise categorize response 
status.  
The best overall response will be determined. The best overall respons e is the best response 
recorded from the start of treatment until disease/recurre nce progression (taking as a reference 
for disease progression the smallest measurements recorded since tr eatment started). Subjects 
with a best overall response of NE or ND will be counted in the denom inators in calculations of 
tumor response rates. Where  imaging data are available, these data will supersede physical 
examination data in determining tumor status.  Clinical Study Report

2.5.4.  Progressive Disease  
The occurrence of any of the following events indicates PD:  
• Evidence of any new disease:  
− A new node that measures > 1.5 cm in any diameter  
− New splenomegaly as def ined in Section 2.4.2 
− New hepatomegaly as defined in Section 2.4.2 
− New non-index disease (e.g., effusions, ascites, or other organ abnormalities 
related to CLL/SLL)  
Note: Isolated new effusions, ascites, or other organ abnormalities are not suffi cient evidence 
alone of PD unless histologically confirmed. Thus, a declaration of PD should not be  made  if 
this is the only manifestation of apparently new disease.  
• Evidence of worsening of index lesions, spleen or liver, or non-index disease:  
− Increase from the nadir by ≥ 50% from the nadir in the SPD of index lesions 
− Increase from the nadir by ≥ 50% in the LD of an individual node or extranodal 
mass that now has an LD of > 1.5 cm and an LPD of > 1.0 cm 
− Splenic progression as defined in Section 2.4.2 
− Hepatic progression as defined in Section 2.4.2 Clinical Study Report

other organ abnormalities related to CLL /SLL)  
− Transformation to a more aggressive histology (e.g., Richter syndrome) as  
established by lymph node biopsy (with the date of the lymph node biopsy being 
considered the date of CLL/SLL progression if the subject has no ear lier objective 
documentation of CLL/SLL progression) 
• Decrease in platelet count or hemoglobin that is attributable to CLL/SLL, is not 
attributable to an autoimmune phenomenon, and is confirmed by bone marrow biopsy 
showing an infiltrate of clonal CLL/SLL cells  
− The current platelet count is <  100 x 109/L and there has been a decrease by 
> 50% from the highest on-study platelet count  
− The current hemoglobin is < 110 g/L (11.0 g/dL) and there has been a dec rease by 
> 20 g/L (2 g/dL) from the highest on-study hemoglobin  
Note: If there is uncertainty regarding whether  there is true progression, the subject should 
continue study treatment and remain under close observation (e.g.,  evaluated at 4- week 
intervals)  pending confirmation of progression status. In particular, worsening of 
constitutional symptoms in the absence of objective evidence of worsenin g CLL/SLL will not 
be considered definitive disease progression; in such subjects, both CLL/SL L-related and 
non- CLL/SLL -related causes for the constitutional symptoms should be considered. 
Worsening of disease during tempor ary interruption of study treatment ( e.g., for intercurrent 
illness) is not necessarily indicative of resistance to study treatment. In thes e instances, 
CT/MRI or other relevant evaluations should be considered in order to document  whether 
definitive disea se progression has occurred. If subsequent evaluations suggest that the subject 
has experienced persistent definitive CLL/SLL progression, then the dat e of progression 
should be the timepoint at which progression was first objectively docume nted.  
2.5.5.  Nonevaluable 
In a subject who does not have evidence of PD, the occurrence of any of  the following conditions 
indicates a response status of NE:  
• There are no images or inadequate or missing images 
• Images of the liver and spleen are missing at that timepoint (with the exception that 
absence of splenic images will not result in an NE designation in a  subject known to 
have undergone splenectomy). 
2.5.6.  Lymphocytosis during Therapy  
Lymphocytosis early in therapy may not represent disease progression in subj ects who have 
persistent control of other CLL/SLL-related signs and symptoms. In the absence of other 
objective evidence of disease progression, lymphocytosis alone will not prec lude subjects from 
meeting the criteria for PR if other criteria for PR are met and will not b e considered evidence 
of disease progression if occurring in isolation.  Subjects with lymphocytosis should be 
continued on study drug until the occurrence of definitive disease progressi on (i.e., disease Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprietary Page 145 of 312 Appendix 4. Summary of Protocol Changes  
Changes made in Amendment 1 (17 Jul 2015) 
The primary purpose of this amendment is to reflect a change in manufact uring of Invest igational 
Product from a tablet to capsule. Wording throughout the protocol as well a s the description of 
the Investigational Pr oduct has been amended accordingly. Additional changes have been made 
to provide clarity and consistency and include the following: 
• Provisional Dose Le vels Table 2 was revised to correctly reflect the percent increase 
from 200 mg to 275mg (37.5%).  
• A statement has been added to prohibit administration of live vaccines during the study 
due to the potential immunomodulatory effect of apilimod dimesylate .  
• Schedule of Assessments Table 4 has been revised to delete the Da y 8 column for Cycle 
3 and Beyond as the re are no assessments, other than at home dosing, on this day.  
• Statement(s) regarding self-administered dosing have been amended to clarify that 
subjects must fast for 2 hours prior to and 2 hours after dose administ ration.  
• Protocol section 12 has been r evised to indicate that blood samples for plas ma 
concentration (PK) levels of product and metabolites will be collect ed during Dose 
Expansion as well a s Dose Escalation.  
• The PK sample collection window was revised in Table 6 from +/- 1 hr to +/- 10 minute s 
for the 6 hr collection time points on Day 1 and Day 8.  
Changes made in Ame ndment 2 (14 Oct 2015) 
The primary purpose of this amendment is to update the biomarker / tumor tissue analysis and 
associated time points. Blood smears from treated subjects wil l be analyzed by microscopy for 
changes in the extent of vacuolation in white blood cells as a phenotypic ma rker of PIKfyve 
inhibition. Tumor tissue w ill be examined for the presence of infiltrating immune cells (e.g., 
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, tumor  associated macrophages) as a means to underst and the 
potential immunomodulato ry effect of LAM -002A. Additionally plasma will be assayed by 
proteomic technology for analytes that may predict anti -lymphoma activity . 
Changes made in Amendment 3 ( 21 Mar2016) 
This amendment documented a change in the medical monitor for the study. Infor mation 
regarding acquisition of data for exploratory endpoints was clarified or updated. Methods of 
efficacy analysis were updated and were made more complete. Eligibili ty criteria were updated 
regarding tumor measurability in patients with CLL/SLL, allowe d concomitant medications, and 
acquisition of tumor, surrogate, and contr ol samples at baseline . Treatment guidelines and dose-
modification provisions were simplified and clarifi ed. The reasons for discontinuing a subject 
from study therapy were made more s pecific. Information regarding the disposition and 
destruction of study drug was clarified.   
Changes made in Amendment 4 (07 Nov 2016) 
In this amendment, the description of the drug product was updated with inf ormation relating to 
newly introduced 50- mg capsules. Descriptions of emerging safety and effic acy data were Clinical Study Report

The maximum number of s ubjects was increased to accommodate the large r number of dosing 
regimens to be evaluated. Post -treatment follow -up methods were clarified. The types of archival 
or fresh tissue to be collected during screening were clarified. Re commendations regarding 
management of gastrointestinal AE s were updated t o reflect the evolving safety pro file of the 
study drug. The definitions of analys is sets to be evaluate d were clarified. 
Changes made in Amendment 5 (14 Apr 2017) 
In this amendment, medical prophylaxis has b een mandated for subjects at intermediate to h igh 
risk of TLS and a recommendation has been included that subjects at high risk of TLS be 
monitored as inpatients during the first 24 to 48 hours of LAM-002A administr ation. In addition, 
TLS has been removed as a DLT exclusion. Serum chemistry laboratory  monitoring for TLS has 
now been included on Days 2 and 3 of Cycle 1 for subjects at intermediate to high risk of TLS 
(as defined in Section 6.8.1 of the protocol). 
Changes made in Amendment 6 (25 Oct 2017) 
This amendment modified the protocol to evaluate the safety and tolerabilit y of LAM-002A 
when given alone and i n combination with rituximab or atezolizumab for the treatment of 
subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.  In support of the addition 
of combination therapy to the protocol: 
• Additional information was added to support the rationale for combination therapy with 
LAM-002A and rituximab or atezolizumab. 
• The trial objectives and endpo ints were revised to indicate that LAM -002A will be 
evaluated alone and in combination with other drugs and to indicate changes in the types 
of pharmacodynamic assays that were to be performed as a result of evolving experience 
with these exploratory assays. 
• The study design was modified to: 
− include further dose exploration using an in termittent LAM -002A dosing regimen 
with antiemetic and antidiarrheal su pport as a result of previous findings that nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea were treatment- limiting when LAM-002A was given 
continuously at doses ≥150 mg twice per day (BID),  
− identify the disease indications and combination regimens to be administered in th e 
expansion stage, 
− include additional information on subject allocation given the plan to explor e 
monotherapy and combination therapy and place r estrictions of Stage 1 and 2 
enrollment, 
− clarify subject evaluability criteria for the dose -ranging and cohort-expansion 
portions of the study, and 
− revise the number of subjects participating in each portion of the trial. 
• The LAM-002A dose-escalation proce dures were revised consistent with the new dose-
escalation and cohort-expansion portions of the study, and additional information on Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprietary Page 147 of 312 premedications, administration of LAM-002A  in the clinic and on an outpatient basis, 
dose modifications, and supportive care was added. 
• Information (including description, packaging, source, storage and stability, solution 
preparation, and accountability) was added for rituximab and atezolizumab. Instructions 
were added regarding administration,  dose modifications, and suppor tive care for 
rituximab and atezolizumab. 
• A section on study restrictions was added to provide guida nce for the investigators with 
regard to breast feeding, contraception, and diet. 
• The duration of study participation was revised to include instructions for administration 
of LAM-002A as monotherapy and as combination therapy. Consistent with intention- to-
treat principles designed to maximize collection of safety and efficacy data, sub jects were 
allowed to continue on either of the combination agents even if the ot her agent were to be 
discontinued due to toxicity. 
• The subject inclusion /exclusion criteria were revised as follows: 
− On mechanistic grounds, primary mediastinal B -cell lymphoma (PMBL) might 
respond to LAM-002A therapy; for this reason, patients with this type of lymphoma 
could be accrued to the dose-ranging portion of the trial. 
− A requirement for prior rituximab therapy was no longer mandated given that some 
patients (eg, those with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small ly mphocytic leukemia 
[CLL/SLL]) might not have received rituximab as prior therapy based on changing 
standards of care.  
− Organ function cri teria for hematological function, hepatic function, and renal 
function were updated based on the evolving safety profile of LAM-002A  showing 
that the drug is unlikely to adversely alter thes e organ systems. 
− The contraception enrollment criteria were made more speci fic. 
− The requirements for baseline bone marrow collection in patients wi th lymphoma 
were clarified. 
− Prior therapy prohibitions were now included for study candidates under 
consideration for combination therapy to minimize the likelihood th at they would 
have disease that is totally resistant to rituximab or atezolizumab.  
− Restrictions on use of live-virus v accines, ongoing therapy for hepatitis B vi rus, 
recent therapy with immunostim ulatory agents, ongoing use of immunosuppressive 
therapies, recent serious i nfection, a history of autoimmunity, or inability to tolerate 
required supportive care were included; these excl usions were intended to enhance 
subject safety and to avoid comorbid conditions that could confuse interpretation of 
safety findings. 
− The requirements relating to baseline serological testing for chronic viral inf ections 
were clarified. 
• Separate schedules of activities were prepared for LAM-002A continuous monotherapy 
administration, LAM-002A intermittent monotherapy administratio n, Clinical Study Report

• Additional information regarding collection of samples for pharmacokinetic and 
biomarker determinations was added. 
• The statistical section was revised to provide:  
− more detailed infor mation on the statistical basis for the Stage  1 dose-ranging 
approach, and 
− the statistical basis for the planned  Stage 2 cohort size.  
In addition to the above, administrative chang es in section ordering were made to enhance the 
organization of information in the protocol. 
Changes made in Amendment 7 (14 Jan 2019) 
The following substantive changes were made to the protocol in this amendment:  
• Introductory information regarding LAM-002 A efficacy and safety was updated .  
• Information regardin g the total potenti al accrual to the study was updated consis tent with 
modifications to the protocol to evaluat e single-agent LAM-002A or the 
LAM-002A/rituximab combination  in additional p atients with FL.  
• A statistical justific ation for accrual of additiona l patients with FL to receive LAM -002A 
monotherapy or LAM-002 A/rituximab was include d. 
• In subjects receiving the LAM-002A/rituximab, combination u se of either intravenously 
administered rituximab o r subcutaneously administered rituximab hyaluronida se human 
was permitted. Relevant changes were made throughout the protocol to prov ide necessary 
dosing, administration, and drug product information for rituximab hyaluronida se human. 
The following clarifying changes were made to the protocol in this amendment:  
• The exploratory obje ctives and endpoints were updated to reflect changes to the 
substrates and parameters  being analyzed. 
• Biopsy procedures were clarified.   
• The severity of hypertension warranting exclusion from protoco l therapy was clarified.  
• The text was clarified to indicate that past pathology data should be collected as part of 
each subject’s medical history.  
• In the schedules of activities, text regarding the timing of laboratory assessments was 
clarified. 
• Information regarding pharmacovigilance r eporting of pregnancies was corrected. 
• Information regarding drugs with known risk of QT prolongation or torsades de pointes

Section 4.1.1 Pharmacology: Updated with references for immunomodulatory properties of 
LAM-002A. 
 
Apilimod and apilimod dimesylate w ere originally introduced into clinical trials based on 
apilimod’s immunomodulato ry properties (Wada 2007; Wada 2012 ). Apilimod inhibits the 
production of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL-23), and was effective in 
preclinical animal models of various autoimmune diseases that are mediated by the 
inappropriate expression of T-helper cell phenotype (Th1) cytokines (Wada 2007).

Approximately 75 evaluabl e subjects (evaluable subjects include those who complete Cycle 1 
dosing [administered at least 7580% of doses] and have sufficient safety data, or who a re 
withdrawn from the study due to a DLT in Cycle 1) will be enrolled, assuming that :

and a copy sent to the study site. Once the site receives the completed enrollment f orm, the 
subject will begin treatment accordingly . The treatment will be conducted in an open-label 
manner. Study sites cannot start dosing the subject without receiving t he assigned dose on the 
returned Subject Enrollment and Eligibility Form subject number first .  
Section 6.4.1.2 T reatment Period  
Change:  The text has been updated for cons istency with other sections of the protocol that now 
indicate th e full list of reaso ns for treat ment discontinuation. 
The subject is treated and monitored for safety (including assessments of AEs, vital signs, ECGs, 
laboratory tests and concomitant medications). Additionally, preliminary anti- tumor activity will 
be assessed and PK and biom arker samples will be collected. In the absence of progressive 
disease (PD) and/or intolerab le toxicityprotocol-defined reasons to discontinue therapy,

Section 6. 5 Dose Esc alation Proc edure s 
Changes:  The text has been reorganized so as to use a consistent approach in both the synopsi s 
and body of the protocol in p resenting dose escalation information.  
 For clarity, additional information regarding the dose levels to be stu died is now 
provided.  
 The DLT criterion relating to the required amount of first- cycle ther apy has been 
made mo re specific to enhance  interpretab ility. 
Subject enrollment will proceed according to a 3 + 3 design. The starting dose of LAM002A 
(apilimod dimesylate capsules) will be 50 mg administered orally BID. In the absence of DL T, 
subsequent dose levels will increase sequentially acc ording to Table 3 , adjusted to accommodate 
available capsul e strengths.  
Apilimod dimesylate will be administered on a twice daily (BID) oral dosing regimen w ith a 
cycle length of 28 days. Subjects will be advised t o take the doses at the same time eac h day, 
approximately 12 hours apart.  Less dose intensive schedu les may be considered  if the initial 
BID regimen’s safety, PK and/or pharmacodynamics suggest that a diffe rent schedule would be 
better tolerated and might allow for serum exposures required fo r anti-lymphoma activity. This 
might include a treatment break such as 3 weeks on/1 w eek off treatment or 5 days on/2 days off 
over a 4 week cycle or an asymmetric (AM dosing > PM dosing) or once-daily dosing schedule. 
If a less dose-intensive treatment regime n is evaluated, then the initial dose tested on this 
schedule will be a daily do se that has been previously evaluated and tolerated on the more dose-
intensive, BID schedule.  
Cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will be seque ntially enrolled at progressively higher starting dose 
levels of apilimod dimesylate, as indicated i n Table 2.The initial cohort of subjects will be 
prescribed apilimod dimesylate at Dose Level 0 (50 mg BID). Dos e level -1 (25 mg BID) is 
provided to permit  a dose decrement in subjects experiencin g DLT at Dose Level 0.

Version 9, 18 Feb 2020 
AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprietary Page 160 of 312 A 3 + 3 design will be utilized to defin e an MTD. For cohorts consisting of 3 subjects, dose 
escalation to the next higher dose may p roceed if no DLT is observed within the fi rst cycle of the 
3 evaluable subjects accrued to a cohort (See Section 6.1.1). If 1 of 3 subjects in the cohort 
experiences a DLT, up to a total of 6 evaluable subjects w ill be enrolled. If 2 or more of the 3-6 
evaluable subjects in a cohort experience a DLT, dose escalation will cease, and additional 
subjects will be treated at a lower dose level. If de-escalation to the previous dose cohort is 
undertaken, this cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects. The MTD is defined a s the highest dose at 
which no more than 1 of 6 subjects (i.e., < 33%) experiences a DLT in the  dose cohort. 
Dose escalation decisions will be evaluated in a DLT evaluable population. The DLT evaluable  
population will include subjects who complete C ycle 1 dosing or who are withdrawn from study 
due to a DLT in Cycle 1. A subject will be deemed non- evaluable for determi ning DLTs and will 
not be counted toward the total cohort size if the subject did not experi ence a DLT, did not 
receive at least 75% (42/56) of the 80% of their assigned planned first-cycle doses or 
discontinued from the study prior to completing necessary s afety evaluations through the first 28 
days of study treatment. These subjects may be replaced unless a ccrual to the cohort has stopped 
due to DLT. 
Section 6.6. Treatment Guid elines  
Changes: Instructions for TLS prophylaxis have been included as a safeguard should th is 
appear as a drug- related adverse event.   
 Information regarding study drug adm inistration  has been moved from a later section 
of the protocol to consolidate instructions regarding study treatment in one section of 
the protocol.  
 Because foo d does not a pprec iably influence study drug absorption, subjects will not 
be limited to inges tion of the  drug under fasting conditions except on  specified days of 
intensive  PK monitoring.  
 Information regarding management of interruptions in scheduling and vomited do ses 
is provided in more detail.  
 The dose modification criteria for the protocol have been clarifie d. In particular, the 
dose modif ication rules have been upda ted to provide consistent practice relating to 
dose modification for DLT in both Cycle 1 and lat er cycles . This approach permits 
patients the maximal opportunity to derive clini cal benefit .  
 Mandatory discontinuation c riteria a re removed consistent with o ther changes to the 
dose modification criteria . These intent is  to allow the investi gators and m edica l 
monitor to judge the clinical significance of each event relative to the potential 
clinical b enefit being experienced by the patient in determining wheth er continued 
therapy is appropriate. 
 Typographical errors in t he DLT criteria have been corrected , the criterion for 
neutropenic DLT has been made more stringent by the omission of growth factors 
from the definition, and the hepat ic DLT criteria have been  made more stringent by 
the addition of substantial elevations in AST as a laboratory event of p otent ial 
concern.   Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprietary Page 161 of 312  Criteria regarding required durations of first- cycle exposure  as compone nts of DL T 
have been made more specific for clarity and interpretabi lity. 
6.6.1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) Prophylaxis  
The risk for TLS should be consi dered based on established algorithms ( Cairo 2010, MDACC 
2013, Roberts 2016 ): 
• Low-risk: Serum LDH ≤ ULN, all measurable lymph nodes <  5 cm, and absolute 
lymphocyte count (ALC) <  25 × 109/L 
• Intermediate risk: Serum LDH >  1 to ≤ 2 × ULN, ≥ 1 measurable lymph node with an 
LD of ≥ 5 but < 10 cm, or ALC ≥  25 × 109/L 
• High risk: Serum LDH >  2 × UL N, ≥ 1 measurable lymph no de with a LD of ≥  10 cm, 
or both ≥ 1 measurable lymph node with an LD of ≥  5 but < 10 cm and 
ALC ≥ 25 × 109/L 
If, during the dose escalation it is observed that the study drug appears to induce TLS, 
subsequent subjects who are at risk should be considered for medical prophylaxis of TLS 
and according to local prevention paradigms. Alternatively, investigato rs may wish to 
consider the following regimens for pro phylaxis in subjects at intermediate or high risk of 
TLS: 
• Intermediate Ris k of TLS: These subjects c an receive allopurinol,  100 to 300 mg orally 
every 8 hours starting ≥  24 to 48 hours before the initial administration of apilimod 
dimesylate on Cycle 1- Day 1 of therapy; in addition, subjects who develop 
hyperuricemia should receive rasb uricase, 0.2 mg/kg. 
• High Risk of TLS : These subjects can receive allopurinol, 100 to 300 mg orally every 
8 hours starting ≥  24 to 48 hours before the initial administration of apilimod 
dimesylate on Cycle 1- Day 1 of therapy; in addition, high- risk subjects can receive 
rasburicase, 0.2 mg/kg, administered 3 to 4  hours prior to the first dose of apilimod 
dimesylate. 
Information regarding the management of TLS is provided in Section 8.6.1.  
6.6.2  Description of Study Drug  
LAM-002A (apilimod dimesylate capsule)  is intended for oral administration. Eac h capsule 
will contain 25 mg of apilimod dimesylate (equivalent to 17.1 mg apil imod free base) and 
the total fill weight of each capsule will be 175 mg. LAM-002 A is formulated as a blend 
with excipients in Size 0 Sw edish Orange gelatin capsules. For additional information, see 
Section 9.1. 
6.6.3 In-Clinic LAM-002A (Apilimod Dimesylate Capsules) Administration  
On Cycle 1 Day 1, and Cycle 1 Day 8 the dose of LAM-002 A (apilimod dimesylate capsules) 
should be orally administered (a minimum fasting state of 6 to 8 hours) by s ite staff 
immediately after the collection of the biomarker samples and p re-dose PK sample. 
Subjects are allowed to eat after PK Sample #4 (hour 2) has b een collected. On Cycle 1 Day 
15, the dose of LAM-002A (apilimod dimesylate capsules) should be orally administered (a Clinical Study Report

dose PK and biomarker samples.  
6.6.4 LAM-002A (Apilimod Dimesylate Capsules) Self -Administration  
Except for the days where treatment is administered in the clini c, LAM-002A (apilimod 
dimesylate capsules) will be self -administered orally, BID of each 28- day cycle until disease 
progression or other discontinuation criteria are met. Subjects s hould be advised to take 
study drug with ≥  4 oz. (~160 mL) of water at the same time each day, 12 hours apart (e.g., 
8 AM and 8 PM) (+/- 1 hour window). When self -administering the study drug at home, 
subjects may t ake the drug in the fed or fasted state . On PK days, subjects should come to 
clinic fasted (a minimum fasting state of 6 to 8 hours) and ta ke the dose at the site under 
supervision. All subjects will be required to complete a Dosing  Diary, which must be 
returned to the site for review at each sit e visit. 
6.6.5 Dose Schedule Interruptions and Vomited Doses  
Subjects who have a delay in administration of a dose of apilimod  dimesylate of <6 hours 
should take the planned dose as soon as possible after the intend ed time of administration. 
For subjects w ho have a delay in administration of apilimod dimesylate of ≥  6 hours, the 
dose should not be taken. The planned timing of subsequent apilimod dime sylate dosing 
should not be altered.  
For subjects who vomit shortly after taking apilimod dimesylate, the vomited dose should 
not be replaced. The planned timing of subsequent apilimod dimesyla te dosing should not 
be altered. 
6.6.6. Dose Modifications 
If a subject experiences an AE that is suspected to be related to  apilimod dimesylate, 
appropriate supportive care (e .g., antiemetics, antidiarrheals, therapy for tumor lysis 
syndrome [TLS]) should be instituted consistent with the nature of the event.  
If a subject experiences an apilimod dimesylate -related DLT (reference Table 3), then the 
study drug administration should b e interrupted until the toxicity recovers to Grade ≤  1 or 
baseline. Upon resumption of study drug, the dose of apilimod dime sylate should be 
reduced by 1 dose level (reference Table 3). Successive adjustments to progressively lower 
dose levels can be made. If the subject cannot tolerate apilimod  dimesylate after a decrease 
to Dose Level -1 (25 mg BID), then the subject should be discontinued from apili mod 
dimesylate therapy unless continued treatment is pe rmitted by the medical monitor.  
After the apilimod dimesylate dose is reduced, the dose can be maintained at that dose 
level, even if there is minimal or no toxicity with the reduced dose. However, if the subject 
tolerates a reduced dose of apilimod dimes ylate for ≥ 4 weeks then the apilimod dimesylate 
dosing regimen may be reescalated to the next higher dose level at the discretion of the 
investigator. Such reescalation may be particularly warranted if t he AE comprised TLS or 
if further evaluation reveals  that the AE that led to the dose reduction was not related to 
apilimod dimesylate. Successive adjustments to progressively h igher dose levels can be 
made. However, the escalated dose cannot exceed the starting dose  level for that subject 
during the first 4 cycles of therapy.  Clinical Study Report

Version 9, 18 Feb 2020 
AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprietary Page 163 of 312 Individual subjects who initiated treatment at a dose level below the lower of the currently 
established MTD or the RP2D and who have not experienced a DLT after ≥  4 cycles of 
treatment may have the apilimod dimesylate dose escalated to the next higher dose level if 
both the principal investigator and the medical monitor agree t hat a dose escalation is 
medically warranted ( e.g., for a subject with stable disease who is tolerating the curren t 
dose level of apilimod dimesylate therapy). In such subjects,  successive adjustments to 
progressively higher dose levels can be made at intervals of ≥  4 weeks with the condition 
that the escalated dose level cannot exceed the lower of the currently establi shed MTD or 
RP2D.  
In a subject who experiences a DLT precluding resumption of apili mod dimesylate therapy 
during a cycle, a new cycle of treatment may begin at the later of  Day 29 or when AEs or 
laboratory abnormalities related to apilimod dimesylate have retur ned to baseline levels. If 
drug-related AEs or laboratory abnormalities precluding further adm inistration of study 
drug are not resolved to baseline by Day  29, week-by-week delays in initiating the new 
cycle of treatment should be instituted. When all drug -related AEs and laboratory 
abnormalities have returned to baseline, the next cycle of therapy can be initiated. Upon 
initiation of a new cycle of therapy, the prior cycle of therapy  will be considered completed.  
Investigators are to discuss modifications in the dosing regim en with the medical monitor. 
The appropriate clinic staff should dispense the study drug for the new dose level and 
instruct the subject/caregiver about the change in dose level.  
During a cycle of treatment, study drug should continue to be administered as  planned unless a 
DLT has occurred.  
6.6.2 New Cycle of Therapy Guidelines  
In the absence of otherwise dose limiting toxicity (DLT), in order for a subject to beg in a new 
cycle of therapy, the following criteria must be met on Day 1 of the n ew cycle. 
• Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be ≥ 1.0 x109/L (1,000/mm3) 
• Platelet count must be ≥ 75 x 109/L (75,000/mm3) 
• All non-hematologic toxicities considered related to study treatment must be 
≤ Grade 1 (except alopecia) or returned to baseline.  
If the subject does not meet these criteria, dosing will be delayed and the subject should be re
evaluated within 48  72 hours. Dosing may resume if these criteria hav e been met. However, if 
the next cycle is delayed by > 14 days because of insufficient recovery from a treatmentrelated 
toxicity, this will be considered a dose limiting event (See Section Deleled). If the next cycle is 
delayed due to treatment related toxicity by > 21 days, then the subject must be removed from 
study treatment.  
6.6.3 6.6.7  Definition of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
A DLT will be defined as an AE or abnormal laboratory value m eeting the criteria in  Table 3 and 
that is assessed as unrelated to disease, a comorbid condition,  intercurrent illness, or 
concomitant medications. For the purposes of dose escalation and determin ation of the MTD, 
DLTs that occur within the first cycle of treatment must be included in decisions regarding dose Clinical Study Report

considered when determining the MTD/RP2D. 
If at any time during the study a subject experiences a DLT, the study treatment must be stopped 
and the toxicity in question must be followed until resolution or stabiliza tion. If treatment is to be 
resumed then re initiation criteria must be met and administration must be resumed at a low er 
dose (Section 6.6.4).

6.6.4 6.6.8 Follow-up for DLTs and AEs Leading to Discontinuation 
Subjects who experience a non -laboratory DLT must be evaluated weekly, at a minimum, for 
4 weeks until resolution to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline and then at least monthly until return to 
baseline or stabilization of the event, whichever comes first. For abnorma l laboratory values that 
qualify as a DLT, subjects will initially be followed at least twice w eekly until values resolve to 
≤ Grade 2 or return to baseline. If not resolved or stabilized within 2 wee ks then subjects should 
be followed at least weekly until return to baseline or stabilization,  whichever comes first.  
Subjects who discontinue the study for a study-related AE or an abnormal l aboratory value must 
be followed at least once a we ek for 4 weeks, and subsequently at 4- week intervals until 
resolution or stabilization of the AE or laboratory abnormality, whicheve r comes first.  
QTc: An immediate evaluation by a qualified site physician should be conducte d for any subject 
with a new Fridericia correction formula (QTcF) > 500 msec. Following the event, t he subject 
should be monitored by the investigator with hourly ECGs until the QTcF is ≤ 500 msec and the 
QTcF has returned to < 30 msec from baseline. A blood sample should be obtained as soon as 
possible following the observation of a QTc > 500 msec to determine le vels of potassium and 
magnesium as well as evaluation of circulating apilimod. Management  of abnormal potassium 
and magnesium levels as well as other clinical factors such as ox ygenation should be addressed 
immediately.  
Upon resolution of the QTc event, the decision to continue treatment at a reduced dose requires 
discussion between the investigator and the subject, and the investigator a nd the sponsor. 
6.6.5 Criteria for Re initiation of Therapy Following Occurrence of a DLT After Cycle 1 
Study treatment will be stopped if a subject experiences a DLT (S ee Section Deleted)  at any time 
during the study. Additional AE management is provided in Section 8.6.1. Study treatment may 
resume, except as noted under “Discontinuation of therapy due to treatment related toxicity”, 
with applicable dose adjustments if the following criteria are met:  
• ANC must be ≥ 1.0 x109/L (1,000/mm3) 
• Platelet count must be ≥ 75 x 109/L (75,000/mm3) 
• All other non-hematologic treatment -related toxicities must be ≤ Grade 1 (except 
alopecia) or returned to baseline.  Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprietary Page 166 of 312 6.6.6 Dose Modification Guidelines 
6.6.6.1 Dose Reductions Following DLTs  
Subjects who experience a DLT (See Section Deleted ) in Cycle 1 will be discontinued from 
treatment. However, subjects who develop a DLT in subsequent cycles of treatment may 
continue treatment at a reduced dose level (a minimum reduction of  at least one dose level) if the 
following criteria are met:  
• the AE reverts to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 within 21 days,  
• the subject is clearly deriving clinical benefit, and  
• the subject has an otherwise favorable risk/benefit profile 
The decision to continue treatment at a reduced dose requires discuss ion between the investigator 
and the subject, and the investigator and the sponsor.  
Once a dose level reduction has occurred, subjects will continue to rec eive this reduced dose. See 
Section 8.6.1 for the management of toxicities.  
6.6.6.2 Discontinuation of Therapy Due t o Treatmentrelated Toxicity  
Study treatment should not be resumed in the case of the following treat mentrelated events: 
• Occurrence of a DLT in Cycle 1 (including > 14 day dose delay secondary to 
insufficient recovery from a treatment -related toxicity)  
• ≥ Grade 3 cardiac event  
• Non-hematologic events of Grade 4 severity  
• > 21 day dose delay due to a treatment-related event in Cycle 2 and beyond . 
See Section Deleted for the management of toxicities 
6.6.7 6.6.9 Duration of Subject Participation  
All subjects will be treated for at least 1 cycle unless there is evidence of u nacceptable toxicity or 
PD. Although subjects may continue to receive study treatment until exper iencing unacceptable 
toxicity or disease progression, it is estimated that each subject w ill participate for an average of 
6 months of treatment and an additional 1 month of follow-up. Subjects who have  discontinued 
study treatment for reasons other than PD will be assessed per R evised Response Criteria for 
NHL or Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of CLL at a m inimum of every 12 weeks 
until documentation of PD, start of new anti-cancer therapy or for up to 1 year from the last 
enrolled subject’s first treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1), whichever com es first.  
Section 6.7. Criteria for Study Termination  
Change: Treatment withdrawal criteria have been updated for clarity and interpretability . 
The sponsor may terminate this study at any time, provided a written notice is sub mitted at a 
reasonable time in advance of the intended termination.  
Subjects may be withdrawn from further study treatment for any of the following re asons: 
• Subject withdrawal of informed consent Clinical Study Report

Version 9, 18 Feb 2020 
AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprietary Page 167 of 312 • Disease progression of cancer while receiving study therapy Note: App arent 
worsening of disease during temporary interruption of study therapy (e.g., for dr ug-
related toxicity or intercurrent illness) may not indicate true c ancer progression. Study 
subjects undergoing PET for lymphoma assessment can experience transient  disease 
flare on imaging before having subsequent therapy-induced tumor r egression. 
Worsening of constitutional symptoms or performance status in the absenc e of 
objective evidence of worsening lymphoma (e.g., due to infection) may not repre sent 
definitive disease progression. For these reasons, if there is uncer tainty regarding 
whether there is true disease progression and if medically appropriat e, the subject 
may continue or resume study treatment and remain under close observatio n (e.g., 
evaluated at 4- to 8-week intervals) while relevant radiographic, clinical, and/or  
laboratory assessments are performed to document whether tumor control can be  
maintained or whether disease progression has truly occurred. If subse quent 
evaluations suggest that the subject has experienced persistent def initive disease 
progression, then the date of progression will be the timepoint at which pr ogression 
was first objectively documented.  
• Unacceptable study -drug-related toxicity despite appropriate dose modification 
• Development of intercurrent illness that precludes continued study therapy  
• Physician decision if that continuation is not in the subject’s best interest 
• Treatment of the cancer with another therapeutic regimen  
• Subject becomes pregnant or begins breastfeeding  
• Substantial noncompliance with study drug administration, study procedures, or s tudy 
requirements in circumstances that increase risk or substantially c ompromise the 
interpretation of study results 
• Termination of the study by the sponsor , relevant regulatory agencies, or the IRB/IEC  
The investigator must determine the primary reason f or a subject’s withdrawal from the study 
and record this information on the electronic case report form (eCR F). 
Section 6.9. Schedule of Assessment  
Changes: The table has been corrected to include screening viral serology. 
 The request for an on-study tumor biopsy has been removed. 
 Confirmation of eligibility need not o ccur precisely on Day 1; thus, the relevant 
footnote has been changed to indicated that it must occur by Day 1. 
 The enrollment criteria have been modified to only include subjects with measurable 
lymphadenopathy and so caveats relating to subjects with CLL without adenopathy 
have been removed because they are no longer applicable. 
 Greater specificity have been provided in the baseline peripheral blood or bone 
marrow aspirate assessments req uired for subjects with CLL/SLL in order to ensure 
clarity regarding the studies to be performed. Clinical Study Report

Changes: Inclusion criteria have been updated to indicate that all study subjects must have 
measurable lymphadenopa thy. 
 In view of the fact that the study drug is not expected to be substantially 
myelosuppressive and that study therapy has the hypothetical potential to improve 
disease- related cytopenias, study candidates who have Grade ≥3 neutropenia or 
thrombocytopen ia due to disease infiltration of the bo ne marrow are permitted to 
enroll. 
 The study will require that candidates with NHL be willing to provide archival or 
fresh tissue prior to enrollment. 
 The study will require that candidates with CLL/SLL be willing to provide CLL cell s 
from peripheral blood or bone marrow prior to enrollment. 
4.  Subjects must have radiographically measurable lymphadenopathy or extranodal 
lymphoid malignancy (defined as the presence of ≥  1 lesion that measures ≥  2.0 cm 
in the longest dimension [LD] and ≥  1.0 cm in the longest perpendicular dimension 
[LPD] as assess ed radiographically).  Subjects may have measurable or non
measurable disease but to be eligible their disease must be clinica lly evaluable for 
improvement or progression. 
7. The subject has organ and marrow function as follows: 
c. Absolute neutrophil count (A NC) ≥ 1.0 × 109/L (1,000/mm3).

Section 7.3  Treatment of Subjects  
Changes: This information was moved from this section and consolidated with other drug 
administration information earlier in the protocol document. 
 Because food does not appreciably influence study drug absorption, subjects will not 
be limited to ingestion of the drug under fasting conditions except on specified days of 
intensive PK monitoring.  
 Furth er information regarding management of interruptions in scheduling is now 
provided in more detail in other sections of the study protocol document. 
7.3.1 Description of Study Drug  
LAM002A (apilimod dimesylate capsule) is intended for oral administration. Each capsule will 
contain 25 mg of apilimod dimesylate (equivalent to 17.1 mg apilimod free bas e) and the total 
fill weight of each capsule will be 175 mg. LAM002A is formulated as a blend with excipients 
in Size 0 Swedish Orange gelatin capsules. For add itional information, see Section 9.1. 
7.3.2 In-Clinic LAM-002A (Apilimod Dimesylate Capsules) Administration  
On Cycle 1 Day 1, and Cycle 1 Day 8 the dose of LAM002 A (apilimod dimesylate capsules) 
should be orally administered (a minimum fasting state of 6 to 8 hours) by site sta ff immediately 
after the collection of the biomarker samples and pre dose PK sample. Subjects are allowed to 
eat after PK Sample #4 (hour 2) has been collected. On Cycle 1 Day 15, the dose of LAM002A 
(apilimod dimesylate capsules) should be orally administered (a minimum fasting state of 6 to 8 
hours) by site staff immediately after collection of the pre dose PK and biomarker samples.  
7.3.3 LAM-002A (Apilimod Dimesylate Capsules) Self -Administration Dosing Diary  
Except for the days where treatment is administered in the clinic, LAM002A (apilimod 
dimesylate capsules) will be self administered orally, BID every 12 hours (e.g., 8 AM and 8 PM) 
of each 28day cycle until disease progression o r other discontinuation criteria are met.  
Administration guidelines: Subjects should be advised to take study drug with 12 oz. water at the 
same time each day, 12 hours apart +/  1 hour window. Subjects should not take drug if > 3 
hours from scheduled dos e and the +/ window. Subjects should not eat within 2 hours prior to

taking a dose, that dose should not be taken again. 
Dosing should occur at the same time each day whenever possible. All subj ects will be required 
to complete a Dosing Diary, which must be returned to the site fo r review at each site visit.  
Section 8.1.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Changes: Confirmation of eligibility need not occur precisely on Day 1; thus this provision has  
been changed. 
At During Screening, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed for eac h potential subject 
and confirmed on by Day 1 of Cycle 1.  
Section 8.1.5 Disease Status Assessment  for Subjects with NHL  
Changes: The requirements for baseline imaging and bone marrow analyses have been 
clarified.  
 The procedures for baseline acquisition of tumor tissue in study candidates with 
lymphoma have been updated and clarified.  
Pretreatment tumor assessments will be performed within 30 days of the first dose of study 
treatment and will include diagnostic CT scans (with intravenous contrast ) or Positron 
Emission Tomography (PET)/Computerized Tomography Scans (CT scan) for patients with 
lymphoma (CT for subjects with CLL/SLL) , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy, complete blood 
counts and physical examination. It is anticipated that in most cases  the PET/ and (CT scans) will 
be conducted using a single instrument, i.e., as a PET/CT scan (CT sc ans should be performed 
using a contiguous reconstruction algorithm of ≤ 5 mm). However, MRI is an acceptable 
alternative method for assessing disease in subject s who cannot receive intravenous contrast with 
CT scans. In such subjects MRI and PET scans will have to be obtaine d separately. 
Suitable scans performed prior to screening and within 30 days before f irst dose may be used for 
baseline tumor assessments. Similarly bone marrow biopsies/aspira tes performed within 
2 months prior to first dose may be used for baseline assessments. For subjects with NHL, 
baseline bone marrow biopsies/aspirates may be omitted if not  deemed essential for 
response assessment or pati ent management. For subjects with CLL/SLL, a baseline bone 
marrow aspirate is required unless the presence of sufficient circulati ng cells in the 
peripheral blood (e.g., ALC ≥  10 x 109/L) permits assessment of baseline parameters for 
gene expression and pr ognosis. Baseline bone marrow biopsies/aspirates may be omitted if not 
deemed essential for response assessment or patient management. Details of assessments will be 
collected on the eCRF and must be filed in the subject’s medical r ecord. 
Archival tissue from the most recent available biopsy or surgery or fresh tumor tissue must 
be obtained pretreatment. For subjects undergoing a biopsy, adequate  tumor tissue should 
be acquired via excisional biopsy, incisional biopsy or core nee dle biopsy (e.g. , ≥ 3 passes 
using a 16-gauge core needle). Tissue will be submitted for  evaluation of the percentage of 
tumor cells and analysis of genetic alterations and/or gene expression that may predict 
anti-lymphoma activity and/or pharmacodynamics activity. In addition, tumor may be 
evaluated for known prognostic characteristics (e .g., for DLBCL: ABC or GCB subtype; Clinical Study Report

biopsy procedure (if required) should ideally be performed after  the study candidate has 
undergone the baseline radiology examination and is otherwise considered eligible for 
study participation.  
Section 8.1.6. Disease Status  Baseline  Assessment s for Subjects with CLL /SLL  
Changes: Greater specificity have been provided  in the baseline imaging and peripheral blood 
assessments for subjects with CLL/SLL in order to ensure clarity regarding the 
studies to be performed. 
All subjects with CLL must have baseline imaging (with CT s cans [preferred] or MRI 
scans). 
Subjects with CLL/SLL must provide either a fresh blood sample c ontaining circulating 
tumor cells or a bone marrow aspirate sample pretreatment. Tissue w ill be submitted for 
evaluation of the percentage of tumor cells and analysis of geneti c alterations and/or gene 
expression that may predict anticancer activity and/or pharmacodynami c activity. In 
addition, for subjects with CLL/SLL, the sponsor may arrange for  a portion of the sample 
to be evaluated at a sponsor-specified laboratory for known prognost ic markers (e.g., 
quantitative immunoglobulins, FISH panel [chromosome 11q deletion, 13q deletion, 
17p deletion and 12  trisomy], DNA mutational analysis for p53, IgHV [including IgHV3-
21], and other genes of interest in CLL [e.g., Notch]; flow cytom etry [for CD5, CD10, 
CD11c, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD38, CD45, kappa and lambda light chains and ZAP-70], 
and/or β2-microglobulin). Subjects with CLL  will have the following baseline assessments 
performed direct antiglobulin test (DAT), quantitative immunoglobulins, Fluorescence  in Situ 
Hybridization (FISH) panel, flow cytometry and β2 microglobulin. Imaging and bone marrow 
aspirate/biopsy will be conducted as above at Screening/Baseline, Eac h Cycle and End of 
Treatment. 
Section 8.3.1 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Change: Information regarding the locations for clinical laboratory testing has been clarified. 
Clinical laboratory tests during the first 2 cycles  will be performed by the investigative site’s 
local laboratory. Samples will be collected from subjects at sche duled study visits before the 
administration of study drug unless otherwise noted, and more frequently if c linically indicated. 
Clinical laboratory tests may be performed up to 72 hours prior to the sc heduled visits (See 
Section Deleted  for Schedule of Assessments). Upon completion of Cycle 2, subjects m ay use 
the investigative site’s laboratory or  their local laboratory for clinical lab oratory assessments. 
Accredited certification, such as College of American Pathologists  (CAP) and Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA), and valid reference ranges must be collected for 
all clinical laboratories used by subjects. 
Section 8.3.1.1  Hematology  
Change: The text has been edited to allow reporting of either aPTT or PTT depending upon 
the type of test done at the site . Text rega rding on-study tumor biopsies is no longer 
applicable because the on-study tumor biopsies have been removed as components of 
this study.  Clinical Study Report

Coagulation parameters (aPTT [or PTT] and INR) should be performed at Screening. 
Additionally these labs should be repeated per institutional guidelines pri or to any onstudy 
tumor biopsies.  
Section 8.3.1.2  Blood Chemistry  
Change: The text has been edited to match the plan for reporting of bilirubin on the case 
report forms. Total bilirubin should be recorded and direct bilirubin should be 
reported if available. If necessary, the indirect bilirubin will be calculated 
programmatically.  
Albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin, calcium, carbon dioxi de, chloride, 
creatinine, glucose, inorganic phosphorus, potassium, total pro tein, ALT, AST, lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), sodium, BUN, and uric acid will be collected at Sc reening and Days 1, 8, 
and 15 of Cycles 1 and 2 then at least once prior to start of all s ubsequent cycles and at EOT. If 
the total bilirubin concentration is > 1.5 times the upper normal limit, total bilirubin should be 
differentiated and the total and direct bilirubin should be reported. into the direct and indirect 
reacting bilirubin.   
Section 8.3.1.3  PK and Biomarker Assessments  
Change: The text has been edited  for accuracy.  
Biomarker samples will be obtained at time points indicated  in Section 13. Comprehensive 
information on tissue acquisition, handling, storage, and sample shipments c an be found in the 
biomarker sample process documents.  Laboratory manual.  
Section 8.5 Adverse Events  
Change: Information that is already described in other sections of the protocol has been 
deleted in order to avoid redundancy and/or inconsistency. 
The frequency of AE monitoring increases for subjects who experie nce a DLT as outlined below 
and in Section Deleted. See Section 6.6.5 for dosing adjustment/termination criteria. Subjects 
who experience a DLT (See  Section Deleted ) in Cycle 1 will be discontinued from treatment.  
If at any time d uring the study a subject experiences a DLT, the study treatment must be stopped 
and the toxicity in question must be followed until resolution or stabiliza tion. Subjects who 
experience a non laboratory DLT must be evaluated weekly, at a minimum, for 4 weeks unt il 
resolution to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline and then at least monthly until return to baseline or 
stabilization of the event, whichever comes first. For abnormal labor atory values that qualify as a 
DLT, subjects will initially be followed at least twice w eekly until values resolve to ≤ Grade 2 or 
return to baseline. If not resolved or stabilized within 2 weeks then s ubjects should be followed 
at least weekly until return to baseline or stabilization, whichever  comes first. 
For patients who discontinue study treatment due to a studyrelated AE, t he reporting time period 
may be extended. These patients must be followed at least once a we ek for 4 weeks, and 
subsequently at 4week intervals until resolution or stabilization of the  AE or laboratory 
abnormality, whichever comes first.  Clinical Study Report

Management  
Change: Recommendations for TLS management have been included for completeness. 
Information regarding TLS prophylaxis is provided in Section 6.8.1. 
Subjects who develop TLS may experience hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia,  hyperuricemia, 
hyperphosphatemia, cardiac dysrhythmias, and acute renal failure;  thus, close monitoring 
of electrolytes is important afte r initial therapy.  
Subjects with TLS should receive intravenous hydration, rapid reversal of hyperkalemia, 
antihyperuricemic agents, and appropriate cardiac and renal support , including dialysis as 
indicated. Upon recovery to baseline functioning and as m edically appropriate, such 
subjects should continue with protocol therapy to maintain tu mor control. 
Section 8.6.4  8.6.5 Other Concomitant Medications  
Change: The text has been changed to allow more latitude regarding the implementation of 
bisphosphonates under circumstances in which the occurrence of disease progression 
is not certain.  
 Instructions on the concomitant administration of corticosteroids during study 
therapy are now provided. 
Bisphosphonates: Bisphosphonates are permitted if a subject was re ceiving ongoing 
bisphosphonate therapy at time of screening and will continue on a stable r egimen throughout 
protocol therapy. The need to start bisphosphonates while on therapy may be an indication of 
disease progression and should be discussed with the sponsor prior to implementation will 
be seen as an indication of disease progression and the subject should be  withdrawn from 
therapy. 
Corticosteroids: Subjects may be using topical, intra-articular , nasal, or inhaled 
corticosteroids at study entry and may u se such drugs during therapy. The use of systemic 
or enteric corticosteroids is precluded at study entry because such dru gs may confound 
interpretation of pharmacodynamic, immunological, or toxic responses  in subjects on this 
study. However, such drugs are permitted if a subject develops intercurrent conditions that 
require corticosteroid therapy.  
Section 8.7 Drug Interactions  
Change: Restrictions on coadministration of drugs that may alter apilimod dimesylate 
disposition have been updated. 
Drug Interaction s: No information is available regarding interactions of LAM-002 A (apilimod 
dimesylate capsules) with therapeutic agents or other substances in humans. In vitro data 
suggest that concomitant administration of potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or 
CYP2C9 might alter apilimod dimesylate clearance and lead to clini cally significant 
increases or decreases in apilimod dimesylate exposure. Consequentl y, the concomitant use 
of strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 (see Table  15) should be avoided 
when possible.  Clinical Study Report

Protocol: LAM-002A- NHL-CLN01 
Version 9, 18 Feb 2020 
AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprie tary Page 178 of 312 Based on these considerations, protocol candidates who require th erapy with CYP3A4 or 
CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers listed in Table 15 should not be enrolled into the study .  
During study participation, coadministration of apilimod dimesylat e with CYP3A4 or 
CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers (see Table 15) should be avoided, if possible. However, a 
subject who develops a condition that may require use of such drug s is not required to 
permanently discontinue apilimod dimesylate if the subject is  experiencing clinical benefit 
and other options for treating the subject’s cancer are limited. If medically appropriate, 
investigators may wish to use a therapeutic alternative that would not b e expected to affect 
these enzymes. For subjects who require temporary use of a drug tha t does affect these 
enzymes (e.g., treatment with a systemic antifungal agent), apilimod dimesylat e can be 
interrupted (or the doses reduced) during use of the other medicatio n and then resumed 
after completion of the other drug. For subjects who require initi ation of chronic therapy 
with a drug that potently affects these enzymes, investigators  must consult with  the medical 
monitor to consider the best course of action.  However, theoretically interactions may occur 
with medications metabolized in the following pathways: CYP3A4 and CYP2C 9. Subjects will 
be excluded from concomitantly receiving strong inducers or inhibitors of C YP2C9 and 
CYP3A4 (Table 15). Investigators are also advised that subjects should not be treated wi th 
moderate inducers/inhibitors of these enzymes if alternative treatmen t is available. If such 
treatments are required, concomitant medications should be started at the low est effective dose 
level.  
Section 8.8  Treatment Compliance  
Change: Consistent with other sections of the protocol document, this DLT criterion has be en 
made more specific to enhance in terpretability . 
A subject is considered to be DLT- evaluable if he/she has taken 80% at least 75% (42/56) of 
the planned first-cycle doses and has sufficient safety data, or has experienced a DLT  in the 
first cycle.

same time each day, 12 hours apart +/  1 hour window. Subjects should not eat within 2 hours of 
or within 2 hours after dose administration; no solid diet restricti ons otherwise. Subjects may 
consume clear liquids in the 2hour pre and postdose window. On PK days, subject s should 
come to clinic fasted and take dose in the clinic under supervision.  
Missed Dose: Dosing should occur at the same time each day whenever  possible. If the subject 
forgets to take a dose by > 3 hours then the dose should not be taken and will be reported as 
‘missed’ in the subject’s diary. The next dose should be taken on schedule.  
If the subject vomits after taking a dose, that dose should not be taken a gain. 
Dosing Diary: All subjects will be required to complete a Dosing Dia ry, which must be returned 
to the clinic for review at each clinic visit.  
9.5 9.4 Study Drug Accountability  
Study drug will be dispensed to subjects in labeled bottles at the beginning of each cycle. 
Subjects should be instructed to bring all bottles, including empty bottles, t o each Day 1 or End 
of Treatment study visit for a compliance and product accountability che ck. Returned study drug 
should be retained for monitor review prior to destruction at the site return to the drug depot , 
unless contraindicated by site standard operating procedures ( SOPs). If contraindicated by the 
site SOP, approval of site process by the sponsor must be obtained and fil ed in the pharmacy file Clinical Study Report

Section 11 Assessment of Efficacy  
Changes: Citations have been updated and associated references in the bibliography have been 
corrected. 
Following subjects with diagnostic CT scans to evaluate efficacy is now also 
permitted.  
Patients with CL L must have lymphadenopathy to be enrolled in the study. 
Tumor response will be assessed in the Dose Escalation Stage and Expansion Stage using 
modified Lugano Response Criteria for NHL (Cheson 2014 NCCN 1 2015) and revised 
gGuidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of CLL (Hallek Blood 2008 , Cheson 2012) (See 
Appendix 2). 
Pretreatment tumor assessments will be performed within 30 days of the first dose (bone marrow 
assessment may be performed within 2 months prior to first dose) and will include diagnostic 
CT scans (with intravenous contract) or PET/CT for subjects with lymphoma  (CT only for 
subjects with CLL/SLL), bone marrow aspirate/biopsy, complete blood counts and physical 
examination. It is anticipated that in most cases the PET and CT scans will be conducted using a 
single instrument, i.e., as a PET/CT scan (CT scans should be performed using a contiguous 
reconstruction algorithm of ≤ 5 mm). However, MRI is an acceptable alternative method for 
assessing disease in subjects who cannot receive intravenous contrast with CT scans. In such 
subjects MRI and PET scans will have to be obtained separately. Baseline bone marrow 
biopsies/aspirates may be omitted if not deemed essential for response assessment or patient 
management. 
During treatment, radiology studies  PET/CT scans will be performed for tumor assessments 
within 7 days prior to Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 7 and then every 3 months thereafter until PD or use 
of alternative antineoplastic therapy. If necessary per applicable response criteria Additionally, 
a repeat bone marrow biopsy or aspirate will be required for subjects with bone marrow 
infiltration at baseline who have a Complete Response (CR) by imaging and physical 
examination. For subjects with CLL without nodal disease, splenomegaly or masses on baseline 
imaging, CT surveillance will not be required except for confirmation of CR. Also subjects with Clinical Study Report

A saliva sample will be obtained on Cycle 1 Day 1 as a normal- tissue control for gene 
mutation studies in tumors. 
Tissue from the most recent available biopsy or surgery prior to first dose will be submitted for 
biomarker analysis to determine genetic alterations or gene expression and determination of 
immune cell infiltration that may predict response to LAM002A  (apilimod dimesylate capsules). 
Although tumor samples are not required for enrollment of subjects, obtaining and submitting 
fresh or archival samples is strongly encourage d. Plasma bioanalytes will be examined by 
proteomic technology at Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 8 to determine changes that may predict 
response to LAM002A. 
Additionally, a bone marrow aspirate (if positive at baseline) and core tumor biopsy will be 
obtained at the time of the first scheduled tumor assessment (end of Cycle 2). However, the 
requirement for core tumor biopsy may be waived for subjects whose tumor cannot be safely 
biopsied or for whom the investigator deems the procedure inappropriate.  These tissues will be 
analyzed for inhibition of PIKfyve by measuring the extent of vacuolation by microscopy. Tissue 
will also be analyzed by immunohistochemistry for determination of the extent of immune cell 
infiltration (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, tumor associated macrophages). Additionally, 
ribonucleic acid  (RNA) will be collected from fresh samples for gene expression analysis.

Dose escalation decisions will be evaluated in DLT evaluable population. The DLT evaluable 
population will include subjects who complete Cycle 1 dosing (administered at least 7580% of 
doses) and have sufficient safety data, or who are withdrawn from study due to a DLT in 
Cycle 1.

Appendix 2.  Criteria for Response Assessment  
Changes: A more comprehensive description of the criteria for response assessment in 
lymphoma has been provided to ensure appropriate evaluation of patients with both 
FDG -avid and FDG-non-avid lymphoma subtypes and patients who are followed by 
PET/CT or by diagnostic CT. The criteria are consistent with Cheson 2014. 
 The criteria for response assessment in CLL have been updated and clarified 
consistent with both the Hallek 2008 and Cheson 2012 references.

* A score of 3 in many patients indicates a good prognosis with standard treatment, especially if at the time of an 
interim scan. However, in trials involving PET where deescalation is investigated, it may be preferable to consider 
a score of 3 as inadequate response (to avoid un der treatment). Measured dominant lesions: Up to 6 of the largest 
dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions selected to be cle arly measurable in 2 diameters. Nodes 
should preferably be from disparate regions of the body and should include,  where applicable, mediastinal and 
retroperitoneal areas. Non nodal lesions include those in solid organs ( e.g., liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs), GI 
involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted on palpation. Nonmeasured l esions: Any disease not selected as 
measured, dominant disease and truly assessable disease should be consider ed not measured. These sites include any 
nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal sites not selected as dominant or  measurable or that do not meet the 
requirements for measurability but are s till considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, whi ch is any 
site of suspected disease that would be difficult to follow quantita tively with measurement, including pleural 
effusions, ascites, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal  masses, and other lesions that cannot be 
confirmed and followed by imaging. In Waldeyer ’s ring or in extranodal sites ( e.g.,, GI tract, liver, bone marrow), 
FDG uptake may be greater than in the mediastinum with complete m etabolic response, but should be no  higher than 
surrounding normal physiologic uptake ( e.g., with marrow activation as a result of chemotherapy or myeloid growth 
factors).

Response Assessment of CLL (Source: Hallek 2008) 
The World Health Organization (WHO) cla ssification of hematopoietic neoplasias describes 
CLL as leukemic, lymphocytic lymphoma, being only distinguishable from small lymphocytic 
lymphoma (SLL) by its leukemic appearance. In the World Health Organi zation classification, 
CLL is always a disease of neoplastic Bcells, whereas the entity f ormerly described as T cell 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (T CLL) is now called T cell prolymphocytic leukemia. 
It is important to verify that the subject has CLL and not some other  lymphoproliferative disease 
that can masquerade as CLL, such as hairy cell leukemia, or leukemic manif estations of mantle 
cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, splenic marginal zone lymphoma with c irculating Clinical Study Report

count, blood smear, and the immune phenotype of the circulating lymphoid cells. 
Definition of Response  
Assessment of response should include a careful physical examination a nd evaluation of the 
blood and marrow (See **). To define a CR, the marrow sample must be at least normocellular 
for age, with less than 30% of nucleated cells being lymphocytes. Lymphoid nodule s should be 
absent. 
Complete remission (CR)  
CR requires all of the following criteria as assessed at least  2 months after com pletion of 
therapy: 
• Peripheral blood lymphocytes (evaluated by blood and differential count) below  
4 × 109/L (4,000/μL). 
13. In clinical trials, the presence of MRD after therapy should be as sessed. The sensitivity of 
the method used to evaluate for MRD should be reported. 
14. Absence of significant lymphadenopathy (e.g, lymph nodes > 1.5 cm in diameter)  by 
physical examination. In clinical trials, a CT scan of the abdomen, pel vis, and thorax is 
desirable if previously abnormal. Lymph nodes should not be larger than 1.5 cm in 
diameter. 
15. No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly by physical examination. In clinical trial s, a CT scan 
of the abdomen should be performed at response assessment if found to be abnormal 
before therapy or if physical examination is inconclusive at the tim e of evaluation. 
16. Absence of constitutional symptoms. 
17. Blood counts above the following values: 
• Neutrophils More Than 1.5 × 109/L (1500/µL) without need for Exogenous Growth 
Factors. 
• Platelets More Than 100 × 109/L (100,000/µL) without need for Exogenous Growth 
Factors. 
• Hemoglobin More Than 110 G/L (11.0 g/dL) without Red Blood Cell Transfusion or 
need for Exogenous Erythropoietin. 
• For subjects in clinical trials a marrow aspirate and biopsy shoul d be performed at 
least 2 months after the last treatment and if clinical and laboratory resu lts above 
demonstrate that a CR has been achieved  
Partial remission (PR)  
PR is defined by the criteria described in Sections 1, 2, or 3 below ( if abnormal before therapy), 
as well as one or more of the features listed in Section 4 . To define a PR, these parameters need 
to be documented for a minimal duration of 2 months (See Table 8). Constitutional symptoms 
persisting for more than 1 month should be recorded. Clinical Study Report

therapy. 
18. Reduction in lymphadenopathy (by CT scans in clinical trials or by palpation in general 
practice) as defined by the following: 
• A decrease in lymph node size by 50% or more either in the sum products  of up to 6 
lymph nodes, or in the largest diameter of the enlarged lymph node(s) det ected prior 
to therapy. 
• No increase in any lymph node, and no new enlarged lymph node. In small lymph 
nodes (< 2 cm), an increase of less than 25% is not considered to be si gnificant. 
19. A reduction in the noted pretreatment enlargement of the spleen or l iver by 50% or more, 
as detected by CT scan (in clinical  trials) or palpation (in general practice).  
20. The blood count should show one of the following results: 
•  Neutrophils more than 1.5 x 109/L (1,500/µL) without need for exogenous growth 
factors. 
• Platelet counts greater than 100 × 109/L (100,000/µL) or 50% improvement over 
baseline without need for exogenous growth factors. 
• Hemoglobin greater than 110 g/L (11.0 g/dL) or 50% improvement over baseline 
without requiring red blood cell transfusions or exogenous erythropoietin. 
Stable disease (SD)  
Patients who have not achieved a CR or a PR, and who have not exhibited progr essive disease, 
will be considered to have stable disease (which is equivalent to a  nonresponse). 
Progressive Disease  
Progressive disease during or after therapy is characterized by at least one of the following: 
1. Lymphadenopathy. 
Progression of lymphadenopathy is often discovered by physical examination and should 
be recorded. In CLL, the use of CT scans usually does not add much inform ation for the 
detection of progression or relapse. Therefore, the use of imaging methods to follow CLL 
progression is at the discretion of the treating physician. Disease p rogression occurs if 
one of the following events is observed: 
Appearance of any new lesion, such as enlarged lymph nodes (> 1.5 cm), sple nomegaly, 
hepatomegaly, or other organ infiltrates. 
An increase by 50% or more in greatest determined diameter of any pre vious site. 
21. An increase in the previously noted enlargement of the liver or splee n by 50% or more or 
the de novo appearance of hepatomegaly or spl enomegaly. 
22. An increase in the number of blood lymphocytes by 50% or more with at least  5,000 B 
lymphocytes per microliter.  
23. Transformation to a more aggressive histology (e.g., Richter syndrome). Whe never 
possible, this diagnosis should be established by lymph node biopsy. Clinical Study Report

1.1 Tumor Assessment Criteria  
The determination of response and progression for subject with N HL will be based on 
standardized criteria [Cheson 2014]. 
1.2 Method of Assessment  
Imaging-based evaluation will be used in this study as the primary basis of lymphoma 
assessment. CT scan is the preferred method for radiographic tumo r assessment. Contrast -Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprie tary Page 189 of 312 enhanced scanning is preferred, but contrast material may be o mitted in subjects for whom 
use of a contrast agent becomes medically contraindicated or if C T scanning is done in 
conjunction with PET. If available, PET scan data will be c onsidered in response and 
progression assessment; however, PET scanning will not b e a required component of 
assessment in this study. As necessary, bone marrow aspirate/ biopsy (e.g., for confirmation 
of CR) or cytological/histological evaluation of lymph nodes, effusions , ascites, or other 
organ abnormalities) will be also be considered . Clinical palpation, chest x-ray, ultrasound, 
endoscopy, laparoscopy, radionuclide scan, or tumor markers will  not be considered for 
response assessment. MRI scanning is not advised but may be used at the investigator’s 
discretion in subjects for whom thi s becomes a necessary alternative to CT scanning.  
For radiographic assessments, the same method of assessment an d the same technique 
(e.g., scan type, scanner, subject position, dose of contrast, injecti on/scan interval) should 
be used to characterize each  identified and reported lesion at baseline and during study 
treatment and follow -up. CT of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed 
with cuts of ≤ 0.5 mm in slice thickness contiguously. If performed, whole -body FDG PET -
CT scanning should be extended from the base of the skull to mid -thigh. 
All relevant radiographic and clinical information required to m ake each tumor status 
assessment must be made available for source verification as requ ested by the study 
sponsor. 
1.3 Timing of Assessment s 
During screening, clinical and imaging -based tumor assessments should be performed 
within the specified screening period. On -study tumor assessments should be performed as 
stipulated in Section Changed. An end-of-therapy tumor assessment should be performed 
unless the subject already has radiographic confirmation of di sease progression ≤ 4 weeks 
prior to study drug discontinuation. If a subject permanently disco ntinues treatment prior 
to objective documentation of lymphoma progression, investigators s hould ideally continue 
further follow -up of tumor status with assessments at ~12 -week intervals until disease 
progression is documented or until the initiation of a new post -study therapy for the 
subject’s lymphoma.  
1.4 Identification and Follow -up of Tumor Le sions and Organomegaly  
1.4.1 Index Lesions  
Up to 6 lesions (e.g. , lymph nodes, liver or spleen nodules, and/or other circumscribed 
extranodal masses) should be selected as index lesions that wi ll be used to quantitate the 
status of the disease during study  treatment. Ideally, the index lesions should be located in 
disparate regions of the body and include mediastinal, abdominal , and retroperitoneal 
areas of disease whenever these sites are involved. For subjects wit h FDG-avid lymphomas 
undergoing PET, selec tion of FDG-avid lesions is preferred.  
Index lesions will be measured and recorded at baseline and at the  stipulated intervals 
during treatment. The largest cross -sectional dimensions (i .e., the LD × LPD will be 
recorded (in cm) for each index lesion. Usin g the LD and LPD, the product of the 
perpendicular diameters (PPD) for each index lesion will be calcul ated. The PPDs and the 
SPDs for all index lesions will be calculated and recorded. T he baseline and nadir PPDs of 
individual lesions and the baseline and  nadir SPDs will be used as references by which Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprie tary Page 190 of 312 objective tumor response and progression will be characterized durin g treatment. All PPD 
and SPD measurements will be reported in centimeters squared.  
1.4.2 Nodal Index Lesions 
A nodal mass may be selected as  a nodal index lesion if it is both abnormal and measurable 
at baseline. A lymph node lesion is considered abnormal if it has a single diameter that is 
> 1.0 cm and is considered measurable if it has 2  perpendicular diameters that can be 
accurately measure d in cross section with the LD being ≥ 1.0 cm and the LPD also being 
≥ 1.0 cm.  
Abnormal, measurable nodal lesions will be subcategorized as ei ther large or small.  
• Large nodal lesions have an LD that is > 1.5 cm and an LPD that is ≥ 1.0 cm.  
• Small nodal lesions have an LD that is > 1.0 cm and ≤ 1.5 cm and an LPD that is 
> 1.0 cm. 
Index lesions measuring >  1.5 cm in the LD, regardless of the measurement of the LPD, will 
be prioritized during baseline index lesion selection.  
At follow-up timepoints, the PPDs  for individual nodal lesions and the SPD of all nodal 
index lesions will be considered. Because nodal index lesions that have one or both 
diameters > 0 cm and < 1.0 cm cannot be reliably measured, a default value of 1.0 cm will 
be assigned for each diameter that meets these criteria and the resul ting PPD will be used 
in SPD calculations. Based on this convention, a CR may be achie ved even if an SPD value 
is > 0 cm2 (i.e., if all lymph nodes measure <  1.0 cm2). 
New or enlarging nodal lesions that are still ≤ 1.0 cm by ≤ 1.0 cm will not be considered to 
represent recurrent or PD. A new node that measures >  1.5 cm in any diameter or a new 
node that measures >  1.0 cm to ≤ 1.5 cm in the LD and measures >  1.0 cm in the LPD will 
be considered PD.  
In cases in which  a large lymph node mass has split into multiple components, only those 
elements that are >  1.0 cm in ≥ 1 diameter will be considered abnormal and used in 
calculating the SPD. Component s that are ≤ 1.0 cm in the LD are assumed to be normal 
lymph node structures. PD will not be based on the growth of a  lesion sub-component until 
it meets the criteria for abnormal. Lesion sub -components that are abnormal (> 1.0 cm in 
≥ 1 diameter) will hav e the true PPDs calculated with the result used only for calcula ting an 
accurate nadir. Lesion subcomponents that are normal ( ≤ 1.0 cm in the LD) will have the 
default PPD of 1.0 cm2 (1.0 cm x 1.0 cm) stored only for the purposes of calculating the 
nadir value.  
If lesions merge, a boundary between the lesions will be establ ished so the LD of each 
individual lesion can continue to be measured. If the lesions have  merged in a way that they 
can no longer be separated by this boundary, the newly merged les ion will be measured 
bidimensionally.  
1.4.3 Extranodal Index Lesions  
An extranodal mass may be selected as an index lesion if it i s both abnormal and 
measurable at baseline. An extranodal mass of any size is conside red abnormal. It is 
considered measurable at  baseline if it has 2  perpendicular diameters that can be Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprie tary Page 191 of 312 accurately measured in cross section with the LD being ≥ 1.0 cm and the LPD also being 
≥ 1.0 cm. 
At follow-up timepoints, the PPD of each single extranodal index lesion and the SPD of all 
extranodal index lesions will be considered. Because extranodal index lesions that have one 
or both diameters < 0.5 cm and > 0 cm cannot be reliably measured, a default value of 
0.5 cm will be assigned for each diameter that meets these criteria an d the resulting PP D 
will be used in SPD calculations. If an extranodal lesion is n o longer clearly visible, it will 
be considered resolved and its PPD will be defined as 0  cm2.  
If an extranodal lesion that had resolved (i.e., had a PPD of 0 cm2) subsequently reappears, 
the subject will be considered to have PD. A new extranodal lesion of any size that appears 
at a site that was not previously involved with lymphoma and i s discernible to the 
radiologist by CT scan will be considered PD.  
1.4.4 Non-Index Lesions  
Any other meas urable and abnormal nodal or extranodal lesions not selected for 
quantitation as index lesions may be considered non -index lesions. In addition, non -
measurable evidence of lymphoma such as abnormal, non- measurable nodal lesions, 
extranodal lesions with bot h diameters <  1.0 cm, bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, 
ascites, pleural or pericardial effusions, lymphangitis of the skin or lung, abdominal masses 
that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques, cysti c lesions, previously 
irradiated lesio ns, or lesions with artifacts may be considered as non- index disease.  
If present at baseline, up to 6 non -index lesions should be recorded. Measurements are not 
required.  
Non-index disease will be used as a general reference to further characterize regression or 
progression of lymphoma during assessments of the objective t umor response during 
treatment. These lesions should be followed as “present” or “ab sent”. 
1.4.5 Spleen and Liver  
Qualitative assessments of the sizes of the spleen and liver will be performed. In addition, 
the presence or absence of splenic nodules will be recorded.  
At baseline and follow- up timepoints, the spleen and liver size will be reported as no rmal, 
enlarged not due to lymphoma (no nodules present), enlarged due to lymphoma ( ≥ 1 nodule 
present), unequivocal increase not due to lymphoma (no nodules prese nt), or unequivocal 
progression ( ≥ 1 nodule present). For subjects with splenomegaly or hepatome galy at 
baseline or at the nadirs for assessments of spleen and live r, evaluations wi ll consider only 
changes relative to the enlargement of the organ (i .e., the portion of the LVD that is 
> 12 cm by imaging for the spleen and >  18 cm in LVD for the liver) at baseline or nadir, 
not changes relative to the total splenic LVD.  
By imaging, the spleen will be considered enlarged if it is >  12 cm in LVD [Bezerra 2005, 
Asghar 2011], with the LVD being obtained by multiplying the num ber of sections on 
which the spleen is visualized by the thickness of the sections (e.g., if the spleen is seen in 
14 contiguous cross-sectional images with 0.5- cm thickness, the LVD is recorded as 7 cm). 
An increase in splenic enlargement by ≥ 50% (minimum increase of 2 cm) from nadir and 
the presence of ≥ 1 splenic nodule is required for declaration of splenic progression. Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprie tary Page 192 of 312 Subjects with a normal spleen LVD (i .e., a LVD of ≤ 0 cm by physical examination or 
≤ 12 cm by imaging) at nadir will only be considered to have progres sed if the spleen 
attains a LVD of > 14 cm by imaging and there is ≥  1 splenic nodule.  
By imaging, the liver will be considered enlarged if it is >  18 cm in LVD [Erturk 2006]. An 
increase in liver enlargement by ≥ 50% (minimum increase of 2 cm) from nadir and the 
presence of ≥ 1 hepatic nodule is required for declaration of hepatic progressio n. Subjects 
with a normal liver LVD (i.e., a LVD of ≤ 18 cm by imaging) at nadir will only be 
considered to have progressed if the liver attains a LVD of >  20 cm by imaging and there is 
≥ 1 hepatic nodule.  
1.4.6 Bone Marrow  
Bone marrow assessments will be based on morphologic evaluation of bone marrow 
biopsies. Immunohistochemistry may be used to assess response if the sample is 
indeterminate by morphology.  
In a subject who has a baseline b one marrow biopsy showing bone marrow lymphoma or 
does not have a baseline bone marrow examination, declaration of an on- study CR requires 
bone marrow biopsy documentation of the absence of bone marrow l ymphoma. In a 
subject who has a baseline bone marrow biopsy showing no evidence of lymphoma, 
declaration of an on-study CR does not require bone marrow examin ation as long as other 
criteria for CR are met. Of note, in subjects with an FDG -PET avid lymphoma, declaration 
of an on-study CR can be based on FDG -PET documentation of the absence of bone 
marrow involvement, even if a bone marrow biopsy is not performed or not available. 
1.4.7 Lymph Node Biopsy 
Lymph node biopsy is not required in the determination of subject eligibility.  
During study participation, a subject with a more indolent type of disease (e .g., CLL/SLL, 
FL) who has a lymph node biopsy indicating transformation to an aggr essive lymphoma 
will be considered to have PD even in the absence of other evidence of PD. If the subject 
has no earlier obje ctive documentation of PD, the date of the lymph node biopsy wil l be 
considered the date of PD.  
1.5 Definitions of Tumor Response and Progression  
Responses will be categorized as complete response (CR), partial r esponse (PR), stable 
disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD). In addition, a respon se category of nonevaluable 
(NE) is provided for situations in which there is inadequate inf ormation to otherwise 
categorize response status.  
The best overall response will be determined. The best overall respon se is the best on-
treatment response from baseline recorded from the start of treatment until 
PD/recurrence. The baseline measurement will be taken as a reference for determinations 
of response. The nadir measurement will be taken as a reference for P D; this measurement 
constitutes the smallest measurement recorded, including the baseli ne measurement if this 
is the smallest measurement. For FDG -avid tumors, metabolic criteria for response by 
PET-CT will take precedence over anatomic criteria for response by c ontrast CT when 
assessing CR. Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprie tary Page 193 of 312 1.5.1 Complete Response  
To satisfy criteria for CR, all of the following conditions must  be attained: 
• No evidence of new disease  
• Regression of all index nodal lesions to normal size (≤  1.5 cm in the LD for nodes that 
were considered large at baseline and ≤  1.0 cm in the LPD for nodes that were 
considered small at baseline) (see Section  1.4.2 for definitions of large and small nodes) 
• Regression to normal of all nodal non- index disease  
• Disappearance of all detectable extranodal index and non- index disease 
• Normal spleen and liver size by imaging studies, no hepatic or splenic lymphoma 
nodules, and no new liver or spleen enlargement  
• Morphologically negative bone marrow based on an adequate unilateral c ore biopsy 
(> 20 mm unilateral core); if the sample is indeterminate by morpholo gy, it should be 
negative by immunohistochemistry  
• If PET performed, no evidence of residual disease – i.e., score of 1 (no uptake above 
background), 2  (uptake ≤ mediastinum), or 3 (uptake > mediastinum but ≤  liver) on the 
Deauville 5-point scale. 
• Negative for bone marrow involvement by PET for a PET-avid tumor or  by an 
adequate unilateral core biopsy (>  20 mm unilateral core); if the bone marrow biopsy is 
indeterminate by morphology, it should be negative by immunohis tochemistry. 
1.5.2 Partial Response  
To satisfy criteria for PR, all of the following conditions must  be attained: 
• No evidence of new disease  
• A ≥ 50% decrease from baseline in the SPD of the index nodal and  extranodal lesions  
• No increase from the nadir in the size of non -index disease 
• No increase from the nadir in the size of the liver or spleen and no new liver or spleen 
enlargement 
• If PET performed:  
o Typically FDG- avid lymphoma: if no baseline PET scan or if the PET scan wa s 
positive before therapy, the on- treatment PET is positive in ≥ 1 previously involved 
site– i.e., score of 4 (uptake moderately > liver) or score of 5 (uptake markedly 
> liver) on the Deauville 5 -point scale but with reduced uptake compared with 
baseline. If baseline PET was performed and was negative, there is no  new PET 
evidence of disease.  
o Variably FDG-avid lymphoma/FDG-avidity unknown : if no pretreatment PET scan 
or if the pretreatment PET scan was negative for lymphoma, CT criteria should be 
used in assessing the tumor during treatment. If the PET scan  was positive before 
therapy, the on- treatment PET is positive in ≥ 1 previously inv olved site. Clinical Study Report

1.5.3 Stable Disease  
To satisfy criteria for SD, all of the following conditions must  be attained: 
• No evidence of new disease  
• Neither sufficient tumor shrinkage from baseline to qualify fo r PR nor sufficient 
evidence of tumor growth to qualify for PD 
• If PET-CT performed, the results show a score of 4 (uptake moderately >  liver) or score 
of 5 (uptake ma rkedly > liver) on the Deauville 5 -point scale with no significant change 
in uptake compared with baseline.  
1.5.4 Progressive Disease  
The occurrence of any of the following events indicates progressiv e disease (PD):  
• Evidence of any new disease that was not present at baseline:  
o A new node that measures >  1.5 cm in any diameter  
o A new node that measures >  1.0 cm to ≤ 1.5 cm in the LD and > 1.0 cm in the LPD  
o Reappearance of an extranodal lesion that had resolved (i.e. , had previously been 
assigned a PPD of 0 cm2) 
o A new extranodal lesion of any size 
o New non-index disease (e .g., effusions, ascites, or other organ abnormalities) of any 
size unequivocally attributable to lymphoma (usually requires PET, biopsy, 
cytology, or other non-radiologic confirmation to confir m disease attributable to 
lymphoma). Note: Isolated new effusions, ascites, or bone lesions are not sufficient  
evidence alone of PD unless histologically confirmed. In patients with no prior history 
of pulmonary lymphoma, new lung nodules identified by CT are usually benign. Thu s, 
a declaration of PD should not be made if this is the only manifestation of an 
apparently new lesion.  
o New FDG-avid foci consistent with lymphoma rather than another etiology (e.g., 
infection, inflammation). If there is uncertainty  regarding the etiology of new 
lesions, biopsy or interval scan may be considered.  
o New or recurrent bone marrow involvement with lymphoma by PET-CT or by bone 
marrow biopsy if prior PET- CT or bone marrow biopsy performed as part of the 
study was negative f or lymphoma. 
• Evidence of worsening of nodal or extranodal index lesions: 
o Increase from the nadir by ≥ 50% in the SPD of index lesions  
o Evidence of worsening of individual index lymph nodes or nodal mas ses:  
 Increase from the nadir by ≥ 50% in the PPD for an y individual node if the node 
now has an LD of > 1.5 cm and there is an absolute change from the nadir of 
≥ 0.5 cm in the LD or LPD and to an absolute dimension of ≥ 2.0 cm. Clinical Study Report

 If a lesion had been classified as a small lymph node, there i s an additional 
requirement that the lesion has an LD of >  1.0 cm and an LPD of > 1.0 cm 
o Unequivocal increase in the size of non -index disease 
o Unequivocal worsening in the size of the liver or spleen ( with the additional 
condition that there must be ≥ 1 nodule present in the enlarging organ)  
• Transformation to a more aggressive NHL histology as established by lymph node 
biopsy 
• If PET performed, there is a  score of 4 (uptake moderatel y > liver) or score of 5 (uptake 
markedly > liver) on the Deauville 5 -point scale with an increase in uptake compared 
with the nadir in conjunction with an anatomic increase in lesio n size consistent with 
PD. 
Note: Study subjects undergoing PET for lymphom a assessment can experience transient 
disease flare on imaging before having subsequent therapy -induced tumor regression. 
Worsening of constitutional symptoms or performance status in the absence  of objective 
evidence of worsening lymphoma (e .g., due to in fection) may not represent definitive disease 
progression. Further, transient worsening of disease during temporary interr uptions of study 
therapy (e .g., for drug -related toxicity or inter -current illness) may not indicate definitive 
progressive lymphoma. If there is uncertainty regarding whether there is  true lymphoma 
progression and if medically appropriate, the subject may continue or resume stu dy treatment 
and remain under close observation (e .g., evaluated at 3 - to 6- week intervals) while relevant 
radiographic, clinical, and/or laboratory assessments are performed to document whethe r 
tumor control can be maintained or whether disease progression has truly occur red. If 
subsequent evaluations suggest that the subject has experienced persist ent definitive disease 
progression, then the date of progression will be the timepoint at which progress ion was first 
objectively documented.  
1.5.5 Nonevaluable 
In a subject who does not have evidence of PD, the occurrence of a ny of the following 
conditions indicates a response status of NE:  
• There are no images or inadequate or missing images, defined as the inability to 
visualize > 25% of index disease and > 50% of non- index disease.  
2 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma

criteria [Hallek 2008], as recently updated [Cheson 2012].  Clinical Study Report

Version 9, 18 Feb 2020 
AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprie tary Page 196 of 312 2.2 Method of Assessment  
In addition to clinical examination, imaging -based evaluation will be used in this study in 
all subjects enrolled. CT scan is the preferred method for radiogra phic tumor assessment. 
MRI scanning may be used at the investigator’s discretion in subjects for whom this may 
be a preferred alternative to CT scanning; however, if MRI is perf ormed, a non-contrast 
CT of the chest should be performed. Contrast -enhanced scanning is preferred, but iodine -
containing or gadolinium contrast material may be omitted in subj ects for whom use of a 
contrast agent would be medically contraindicated. Chest x -ray, ultrasound, endoscopy, 
laparoscopy, PET, radionuclide scans, or tumor markers will no t be considered for 
response assessment.  
For radiographic evaluations, the same method of assessment and the same technique (e .g., 
scan type, scanner, subject position, dose of contrast, injection /scan interval) should be 
used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at bas eline and during study 
treatment and follow -up. However, if a subject is imaged without contrast at basel ine, 
subsequent assessments should be performed with contrast, unless the subject cannot 
tolerate the contrast.  
All relevant clinical and radiographic information required to m ake each tumor status 
assessment must be made available for source verification as requ ested by the study 
sponsor. 
2.3 Timing of Assessments  
During screening, clinical, laboratory, and imaging- based tumor assessments should be 
performed within the specified screening period. Clinical tumor as sessments should be 
performed at each designated clinical visit. On -study CT/MRI tumor assessments should 
be performed as indicated in Section  Changed. An end-of-study CT/MRI tumor assessment 
should be performed unless the subject already has radiographic co nfirmation of disease 
progression ≤ 4 weeks prior. If a subject permanently  discontinues study drug prior to 
objective documentation of CLL/SLL progression, investigators sh ould optimally attempt 
to obtain further follow -up at ~12-week intervals until CLL/SLL progression is 
documented or until the initiation of a new post -study therapy for the subject’s CLL/SLL.  
2.4 Identification and Measurement of Tumor Lesions and Organomegaly  
2.4.1 Index Lesions  
At baseline, up to 6 lymph nodes should be selected as index lesio ns that will be used to 
quantitate the status of the disease during study treatment. Ide ally, the index lesions should 
be located in disparate regions of the body. Only peripheral no des need be selected as index 
lesions. However, it is optimal if mediastinal and retroperit oneal areas of disease are 
assessed whenever these sites are involved.  
Index lesions will be measured and recorded at baseline and at the  stipulated intervals. The 
cross-sectional dimensions (the largest cross -sectional diameter, i .e., the LD × LPD) will be 
recorded (in cm) for each index lesion. The product of the perpendicular diameters  (PPD) 
(in cm2) for each index lesion and SPD (in cm2) for all index lesions will be calculated and 
recorded. The baseline SPD will be used as references by which objectiv e tumor response 
will be characterized during trea tment. The nadir LD of individual lesions and the nadir Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprie tary Page 197 of 312 SPD will be used as references by which CLL/SLL progression will  be characterized. All 
LD and LPD diameters will be reported in centimeters and all PPD s and SPDs will be 
reported in centimeters square d. 
A nodal mass may be selected as a nodal index lesion if it is  both abnormal and measurable 
at baseline. A lymph node lesion is considered abnormal if it has a single diameter that is 
> 1.5 cm and is considered measurable if it has 2  perpendicular diameters that can be 
accurately measured in cross section with the LD being ≥ 1.0 cm and the LPD also being 
≥ 1.0 cm. 
Index lesions measuring >  1.5 cm in the LD, regardless of the measurement of the LPD, will 
be prioritized during baseline index lesion selectio n. 
At follow-up timepoints, the LDs for individual lesions and the SPD of all nodal index 
lesions will be considered. Because nodal index lesions that hav e one or both diameters 
> 0 cm and < 1.0 cm cannot be reliably measured, a default value of 1.0 cm will be assigned 
for each diameter that meets these criteria and the resulting PPD will be used in SPD 
calculations. Based on this convention, a CR may be achieved even i f an SPD value is 
> 0 cm2, (i.e., if all lymph nodes measure <  1.0 cm2). 
A new node that measures > 1.5 cm in any diameter or a new node that measures >  1.0 cm 
to ≤ 1.5 cm in the LD and measures >  1.0 cm in the LPD will be considered progressive 
disease. 
In cases in which a large lymph node mass has split into multip le components, only those 
elements that are > 1.0 cm in ≥ 1 diameter will be considered abnormal and used in 
calculating the SPD. Progression of the lesion can only be based  on the SPD of abnormal 
sub-components. Lesion sub -components that are considered normal but measurable will 
have the true PPDs calculated, with the result used only for cal culating an accurate nadir. 
Similarly, lesion sub -components that are visible but neither abnormal nor measurable will 
have the default PPD of 1.0 cm2 (1.0 cm × 1.0 cm) stored only for the purposes of 
calculating the nadir SPD value. 
If lesions merge, a boundary between the lesions will be establ ished so the LD of each 
individual lesion can continue to be measured. If the lesions have  merged in a way that they 
can no longer be separated by this boundary, the newly merged lesion will be measured bi -
dimensionally.  
2.4.2 Spleen and Liver  
Both the spleen and liver will be assessed by CT/MRI scan and by  physical examination at 
baseline and at the stipulated intervals during treatment. The ba seline and nadir values for 
the longest vertical dimension (LVD) of each organ will be u sed as reference to further 
characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension s of the CLL/SLL 
during treatment. All spleen and liver LVD measurements should b e recorded in 
centimeters. 
Physical examination of the spleen should comprise assessment  of its LVD below the left 
costal margin by palpation. By physical examination, the spleen will  be considered 
enlarged if it is palpable below the left costal margin. I f the spleen is not palpable below the 
left costal margin, it should be assigned a value of 0 cm for ph ysical examination Clinical Study Report

[Bezerra 2005, Asghar 2011], with the LVD being obtained by multiplying the number of 
sections on which the spleen is visualized by the thickness of t he sections (e.g., if the spleen 
is seen in 14 contiguous cross -sectional images with 0.5- cm thickness, the LVD is recorded 
as 7 cm).  
For subjects with splenomegaly at baseline or at the splenic L VD nadir, respective response 
and progression evaluations of the spleen will consider only ch anges relative to the 
enlargement of the spleen (i .e., the portion of the LVD that is >  0 cm by physical 
examination or > 12 cm by imaging) at baseline or nadir, not changes re lative to the total 
splenic LVD.  
A 50% decrease from baseline (minimum decrease of 2 cm) in the enla rgement of the 
spleen in its LVD or to ≤ 12 cm by imaging, or regression to a spleen LVD of ≤ 0 cm by 
physical examination, is required for declaration of a splenome galy response. Conversely, 
an increase in splenic enlargement by ≥ 50% (minimum increase of 2 cm) from nadir is 
required for declaration of splenic progression. Subjects with a n ormal spleen LVD (i.e., a 
LVD of ≤ 0 cm by physical examination or ≤ 12 cm by imaging) at nadir will only be 
considered to have progressed if the spleen attains a LVD of >  14 cm by imaging or > 2 cm 
by physical exam. 
Physical examination of the liver should comprise assessment of its LVD at the right 
midclavicular line by percussion. By physical examination, the  liver will be considered 
enlarged if it is >  15 cm in LVD as assessed by percussion [Walker 1990]. By imaging, t he 
liver will be considered enlarged if it is > 18 cm in LVD [Erturk 2006]. 
A 50% decrease (minimum decrease of 2 cm) from baseline in the enla rgement of the liver 
in its LVD or to ≤ 18 cm by imaging, or regression to a liver LVD of ≤ 15 cm by physical 
examination, is required for declaration of a hepatomegaly response. Conversely, an 
increase in liver enlargement by ≥ 50% (minimum increase of 2 cm) from nadir is required 
for declaration of hepatic progression. Subjects with a normal liver LVD (i.e., a LVD of 
≤ 15 cm by physical examination or ≤ 18 cm by imaging) at nadir will only be considered to 
have progressed if the liver attains a LVD of > 20 cm by imaging or > 17 cm by physical 
exam. 
2.4.3 Non-Index Lesions  
Any other measurable and abnormal nodal lesions not selected fo r quantitation as index 
lesions may be considered non -index lesions. In addition, non -measurable evidence of 
CLL/SLL such as nodal lesions with both diameters <  1.0 cm, extranodal lesions, bone 
lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial  effusions, lymphangitis of the 
skin or lung, abdominal masses that are not confirmed and follow ed by imaging 
techniques, cystic lesions, previously irradiated lesions, and lesions with artifacts may be 
considered as non -index disease.  
The presence or absence of non -index disease should be recorded at baseline and at the 
stipulated intervals during treatment. If present at baseline,  up to 6 non-index lesions 
should be recorded. The non -index disease at baseline will be used as a general reference to 
further characterize regression or progression of CLL/SLL during ass essments of the Clinical Study Report

lesions should be followed as “present” or “absent”. 
2.5 Definitions of Tumor Response and Progression  
Responses will be  categorized as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), sta ble 
disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD). In addition, a respon se category of nonevaluable 
(NE) is provided for situations in which there is inadequate inf ormation to otherwise 
categorize response status.  
The best overall response will be determined. The best overall respon se is the best response 
recorded from the start of treatment until disease/recurrence progression (taking as a 
reference for disease progression the smallest measurements recorded si nce treatment 
started). Subjects with a best overall response of NE or ND wi ll be counted in the 
denominators in calculations of tumor response rates. Where im aging data are available, 
these data will supersede physical examination data in determining tumor status.  
2.5.2 Complete Response and Complete Response with Incomplete Blood Count 
Recovery 
To satisfy criteria for CR or CRi, all of the following condition s must be attained:  
• No evidence of new disease  
• Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in  peripheral blood of <  4 x 109/L 
• Regression of all index nodal masses to normal size ≤ 1.5 cm in the LD 
• Normal spleen and liver size  
• Regression to normal of all nodal non- index disease and disappearance of all detectable

lymphoid cells and no lymphoid nodules in a bone marrow sample t hat is normocellular 
for age 
• Peripheral blood meeting all of the following criteria:  
o ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L without need for  exogenous growth factors (e.g., G- CSF) 
o Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L without need for exogenous growth factors 
o Hemoglobin ≥ 110 g/L (11.0 g/dL) without red blood cell transfusions or need f or 
exogenous growth factors (e.g., erythropoietin) 
Note: Subjects who fulfill all the criteria for a CR (including bone marrow  criteria) but who 
have a persistent anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia or a hypocellular bone marrow  
that is related to prior or ongoing drug toxicity (and not to CLL/SLL) will be conside red as a 
CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi).

which only 1 criterion is needed: (1) Only lymphadenopathy is pre sent at baseline; or 
(2) only lymphadenopathy and lymphocytosis are present at baselin e; in these 2 cases, 
only lymphadenopathy must improve to the extent specified below:  
o Decrease in peripheral blood ALC by ≥ 50% from baseline

o ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L or ≥ 50% increase over baseline without need for exogenous 
growth factors (e.g., G- CSF) 
o Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L or ≥ 50% increase over baseline without need for 
exogenous growth factors 
o Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/L (11.0 g/dL) or ≥ 50% increase over baseline without red blood 
cell transfusions or need for exogenous growth fac tors (e.g., erythropoietin)  
2.5.3 Stable Disease  
To satisfy criteria for SD, the following conditions must be at tained: 
• No evidence of new disease  
• There is neither sufficient evidence of tumor shrinkage to qualif y for PR nor sufficient 
evidence of tumor gr owth to qualify for definitive PD  
2.5.4 Progressive Disease  
The occurrence of any of the following events indicates PD:  
• Evidence of any new disease:  
o A new node that measures >  1.5 cm in any diameter  
o New splenomegaly as defined in Section 2.4.2 
o New hepatomegaly as defined in Section 2.4.2 
o New non-index disease (e .g., effusions, ascites, or other organ abnormalities related 
to CLL/SLL) 
Note: Isolated new effusions, ascites, or other organ abnormalities are not suffi cient 
evidence alone of PD unless histologically confirmed. Thus, a declaration of PD  
should not be made if this is the only manifestation of apparently new disease.

from the highest on -study platelet count  
o The current hemoglobin is <  110 g/L (11.0 g/dL) and there has been a decrease by 
> 20 g/L (2 g/dL) from the highest on-study hemoglobin  
Note: If there is uncertainty regarding whether there is true progress ion, the subject should 
continue study treatment and remain under close observation (e .g., evaluated at 4 -week 
intervals) pending confirmation of progression status. In particular, worsenin g of 
constitutional symptoms in the absence of objective evidence of worsenin g CLL/SLL will not 
be considered definitive disease progression; in such subjects, both CLL/SL L-related and 
non- CLL/SLL -related causes for the constitutional symptoms should be considered. 
Worsening of disease during temporary interruption of study treatment (e .g., for intercurrent 
illness) is not necessarily indicative of resistance to study treatm ent. In these instances, 
CT/MRI or other relevant  evaluations should be considered in order to document whether 
definitive disease progression has occurred. If subsequent evaluations sugges t that the subject 
has experienced persistent definitive CLL/SLL progression, then the dat e of progression 
should be  the timepoint at which progression was first objectively documented.  
2.5.5 Nonevaluable 
In a subject who does not have evidence of PD, the occurrence of a ny of the following 
conditions indicates a response status of NE:  
• There are no images or inadequate or missing images 
• Images of the liver and spleen are missing at that timepoint  (with the exception that 
absence of splenic images will not result in an NE designatio n in a subject known to 
have undergone splenectomy).  
2.5.6 Lymphocytosis during Therapy  
Lymphocytosis early in therapy may not represent disease progression in subjects who 
have persistent control of other CLL/SLL -related signs and symptoms. In the absence of 
other objective evidence of disease progression, lymphocytosis alone will not preclude subjects Clinical Study Report

Section 4.1.4.2 Efficacy  
Change: The descript ion of drug efficacy has been updated. 
Efficacy data in patients with hematological malignancies are pen ding. One patient, a 
60-year-old male with GCB -DLBCL who was had experienced minimal or no response to 
multiple prior chemoimmunotherapy regimens (inclu ding R-CHOP), received apilimod 
dimesylate at 100 mg/dose BID for 6 weeks before enlarging right axi llary 
lymphadenopathy required cessation of study drug and intervention wi th local radiation 
therapy. A follow- up PET-CT, obtained approximately 2 weeks later, showed a substantial 
systemic decrease in DLBCL lesions in non -irradiated lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and bone 
(C4 vertebra); these improvements in disease burden were attributed by the investigator to 
the study drug.  There is no efficacy data in patie nts with NHL or other malignancies.  
Section 4.1.4.3  Safety   
Change: The description of drug safety has been updated. 
Apilimod dimesylate has been generally well tolerated in humans. In patient populations with 
Crohn’s disease or psoriasis, more frequent (> 10%) AEs experienced to date included headache, 
upper respiratory tract infection, and nausea; less frequent (> 5% to 10%) AEs included 
dizziness, fatigue, and nasopharyngitis; and rare (2% to 5%) AEs included di arrhea, arthralgia, 
fever, abdominal pain, peripheral edema, and vomiting. In general, most AEs  were assessed as 
mild in severity . In the ongoing trial of apilimod dimesylate in patients with hematological 
cancers, dose-dependent gastrointestinal events of nausea, vomiting, and diarr hea have 
been observed.  
No renal insufficiency has been observed in completed clinical tria ls to date and no clinically 
significant safety signals in laboratory, physical examination, or vital  sign findings have been 
noted. One patient with a hematological malignancy receiving the drug at  150 mg BID 
developed asymptomatic Grade 3 hyponatremia that was attribu ted to the combined effects 
of a apilimod-dimesylate- induced diarrhea and hydrochlorothiazide administration.  
Cardiac monitoring in clinical studies to date has not revealed any ma jor issues. However in a 
thorough QT/QTc study, apilimod dimesylate at doses of 50 mg and 150 mg was as sociated with 
repolarization findings in excess of those deemed negative by Internationa l Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) E14 guidance. The magnitude of the change was modest  (~8.5 msec) and 
the root-mean-square based analyses did not demonstrate as large an increase in car diac 
repolarization time (≤ 1.22 msec) as that identified using the Fridericia method. T herefore the 
significance of th is finding is unclear. Preliminary QTc observations in the ongoing study in 
patients with hematological malignancies suggest the potential  for dose- and 
exposure-dependent Grade  1 or 2 QT prolongation. Clinical Study Report

SECTION 6 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
Changes: Information in Subsections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.5 regarding the dose-escalation and 
sample sizes has been updated to reflection inclusion of additional dose levels and 
schedules.  
 Subsection 6.4.3,1 has been clarified t o indicate that all subjects will be followed for 
survival and to provide additional information regarding out how that follow- up will 
be performed. 
6.1  Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase  1, single-arm, open-label, dose-escalation study of safety and PK of a pilimod 
administered to subjects with refractory or relapsed B-cell NHL . This study consists of 2 stages: 
6.1.1 Dose Escalation Stage 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined during the Dose  Escalation Stage. 
Subjects will accrue using a 3 + 3 design. During this stage, the decision to open a new cohort at 
a higher or lower dose level will be made by the participating c linical investigators and sponsor 
when all subjects in the current cohort have been treated through at le ast Week 4 or once 2 DLTs 
have occurred in that dose cohort. All available safety and PK data wi ll be considered in a 
decision by the medical monitor in collaboration with the investigators  to dose escalate, de -
escalate, or expand the current cohort or explore an alternate s chedule of drug 
administration . The MTD will be determined based primarily on DLTs observed through 
Week 4 in at least 6 subjects.  
6.1.2 Expansion Stage 
Once the MTD and/or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) and schedule is determined, the 
study will enter t he Expansion Stage, in which 3 cohorts of 15 subjects each will be accrue d in 
order to obtain additional information on safety, tolerability, preliminar y anti-tumor activity, PK, 
and pharmacodynamic data at the RP2D and schedule. The eligibility cri teria will remain the 
same as in escalation but each cohort will be specific to subject s with DLBCL, FL, and 
CLL/SLL, respectively. The treatment regimen in each of the expa nsion cohorts will be single 
agent LAM-002A (apilimod dimesylate capsules) according to th e RP2D and schedule. 
6.2  Number of Subjects  
Approximately  115 75 evaluable subjects (evaluable subjects include those who complete Cycle  
1 dosing [administered at least 75% of doses] and have sufficient safe ty data, or who are 
withdrawn from the study due to a DLT in Cycle 1) will be enrolled, a ssuming that: 
• In the Dose Escalation Stage of the study, the total number of subjects  will depend

6 additional subjects are enrolled at the MTD or RD, as many as 60 subjects could be 
enrolled. To allow for the possibility that some subjects may not be fully evaluable 
for DLT or that an intermediate dose level might be evaluated, up to ~70 subjects 
may be enrolled 5 dose levels will be studied and a maximum of 6 subjects will be 
enrolled per dose level, for an estimated total of 18 to 30 evaluable subjects .  
• In the Expansion Stage of the study, if all 3 potential expansion cohorts of 
15 evaluable subjects are accrued, as many as 45 subjects could be enr olled. To allow 
for the possibility that some subjects may not be fully evaluable for efficacy, up to 
~55 subjects may be enrolled. Up to an additional 45 evaluable subjects ( 3 cohorts of 
15 subjects) will be enrolled in the Expansion Stage of the study. Subjects will be 
treated at the RP2D and schedule determined in the Dose Escalation Stage of the 
study. 
6.4.3.1 Post-Treatment Period  
Subjects should be followed until the later of either 30 days after the  last dose of study treatment 
or until resolution/stabilization of any ongoing drug-related AEs and/or SAEs . For subjects with 
events that require follow-up, information regarding concomitant medica tions should be 
collected. Any necessary follow -up may be obtained in person or by telephone contact. 
Subjects who have discontinued study treatment for reasons other than PD will be assessed per 
Revised Response Criteria for NHL or Guidelines for the diagnosis a nd treatment of CLL at a 
minimum of every 12 weeks until documentation of PD, start of new anti- cancer therapy or for 
up to 1 year from the last enrolled subject’s first treatment (C ycle 1 Day 1) whichever comes 
first. Long-term follow-up survival information will be obtained in all surviving subjects 
who permanently discontinue study therapy. Such information may be collected at ~3 - to 6-
month intervals at the sponsor’s discretion through 3 years. Thi s long-term follow-up 
information will be gathered during ro utine clinic visits, other study site contact with the 
subjects, or via telephone or e -mail with the subjects/caregivers or referring physician 
offices.Survival of all subjects will be followed by the investigator via te lephone contact every 
3 months. 
6.5  Dose Escalation Procedures  
Apilimod dimesylate will be administered on a twice daily (BID) or thrice daily (TID)  oral 
dosing regimen with a cycle length of 28 days. Subjects on a BID schedule  will be advised to 
take the doses at the same time each day, approximately ~12 hours apart. Subjects on a TID 
schedule will be advised to take the doses at the same tim e each day at intervals of ~6 to 
8 hours. On PK days, subjects on a TID schedule should receive the morning  dose and 
complete the blood collections thr ough 8 hours thereafter before taking the second dose on 
that day.  
Other drug administration  Less dose intensive schedules may be considered if the initial BID 
or TID regimen’s safety, PK and/or pharmacodynamics suggest that a differe nt schedule would 
be better tolerated and might allow for serum exposures required for ant i-lymphoma activity. 
This might include a treatment break such as 3 weeks on/1 week off tr eatment or 5 days on/2 
days off over a 4- week cycle or an asymmetric (AM  dosing > PM dosing) or o nce-daily dosing 
schedule. If a less doseintensiveanother treatment regimen is evaluated, then the initial dose Clinical Study Report

previous dose cohort is undertaken, this cohort will be expanded to ≥6 subjects. Additional 
subjects (up to 12  total per cohort) may be evaluated to refine the estimation of the MTD 
and RP2D at the planned dose levels or at an intermediate dose level between the highest 
previously tolerated total dose and the next planned total daily dose. The MTD is defined as 
the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 subjects (i.e., < 33% of subjects) experiences a 
DLT in the total dose cohort. 
Dose escalation decisions will be evaluated in a DLT evaluable popul ation. The DLT evaluable 
population will include subjects who complete Cycle 1 dosing or who are wi thdrawn from study Clinical Study Report

not be counted toward the total cohort size if the subject did not experi ence a DLT, did not 
receive at least 75% (42/56 BID schedule; 63/84 TID schedule ) of the planned first- cycle doses 
or discontinued from the study prior to completing necessary safety evaluat ions through the first 
28 days of study treatment. These subjects may be replaced unless acc rual to the cohort has 
stopped due to DLT. 
Following the above guidelines, the participating investigators and sponsor will review available 
data including toxicity, PK and anti-tumor activity data to reach consensus  on dose levels and 
determination of the MTD. This group will revie w available safety data for each cohort and will 
determine whether the MTD has been reached and decide upon further s ubject enrollment. Any 
detected cumulative toxicity may require later dose reductions or other  action as appropriate, and 
may also have an effect on be evaluated in determining the RP2D and schedule.  
The RP2D and schedule will be determined in discussion between the spons or and participating 
investigators. Observations related to PK, pharmacodynamics and any drug- related toxicities 
may be included in the rationale supporting the RP2D and schedule. 
Once the RP2D and schedule are established, additional subjects will  be treated in 
3 histologically distinct dose expansion cohorts designed to better charac terize the safety, 
tolerability, prelimina ry anti-tumor activity, PK, and pharmacodynamics of the study drug when 
provided at the MTD (or lower dose per agreement of the investigator s and sponsor) in a specific 
B-cell NHL subtype. Up to 15 subjects will be treated in each expansi on cohort. 
Section  6.6.2 Description of Study Drug  
Change: The description of the drug product has been updated with information relating to the 
newly introduced 50- mg capsule.  
LAM-002A (apilimod dimesylate capsule) is intended for oral admini stration. Each capsule 
will contain 25 mg or 50 of apilimod dimesylate (equivalent to 17.1 mg or 34.3 mg of  
apilimod free base, respectively). The 25 -mg capsule is Swedish orange and the 50 -mg 
capsule is white. Both the 25 - and 50-mg capsules are Size 0 and both have a total fill 
weight of 175 mg. LAM002A (apilimod dimesylate capsule) is intended for oral administration. 
Each capsule will contain 25 mg of apilimod dimesylate (equivalent to 17.1 mg apilimod free 
base) and the total fill weight of each capsule will be 175 mg. LAM 002A is formulated as a 
blend with excipients in Size 0 Swedish Orange gelatin capsules. For additional information, see 
Section 9.1.

Except for the days where treatment is administered in the clinic, LAM-002A (apilimod 
dimesylate capsules) will be self -administered orally, BID or TID of each 28-day cycle until 
disease progression or other di scontinuation criteria are met. When taking the drug at home, 
sSubjects should be advised to take study drug with ≥  4 oz. (~160 mL) of water at the same time s 
each day,. Subjects on a BID schedule will be advised to take the doses at approximately  
12 hours apart (e.g., 8 AM and 8 PM) (+/- 1 hour window ). Subjects on a TID schedule will be 
advised to take the doses at intervals of ~6 to 8 hours.  When self-administering the study drug Clinical Study Report

to clinic fasted (a minimum fasting state of 6 to 8 hours) and take  the dose at the site under 
supervision. All subjects will be required to complete a Dosing Diary, which must be returned to 
the site for review at each site visit.  
Section 6.6.5 Dose Schedule Interruptions and Vomited Doses  
Change: Information has been updated to reflection inclusion of additional dose levels and 
schedules. 
Subjects on a BID schedule  who have a delay in administration of a dose of apilimod dimesylate 
of <6 hours should take the planned dose as soon as possible afte r the intended time of 
administration. For subjects who have a delay in administration of apili mod dimesylate of 
≥6 hours, the dose should not be taken. The planned timing of subsequent apilimod dime sylate 
dosing should not be altered.  
Subjects on a TID s chedule who inadvertently have a delay in administration of a dos e of 
the study drug of ≤1 hour, the planned dose should be taken with no changes to t he 
subsequent dose schedule. For subjects who have a delay of >1 hour but ≤4 hours , the 
planned dose shoul d be taken; however, all future doses for that day should be shi fted later 
by a corresponding amount. It is recommended that subjects take t he last dose of study 
medication no later than 12:00 midnight on any study treatment day.  For example, if the 
07:00 AM dose is taken at 10:00 AM, the next dose should be taken ≥6 hours later (afte r 
5:00 PM), and the last dose should be taken ≥6 hours thereafter (between 11:00P M and 
12:00 midnight). For subjects on a TID schedule who have a delay i n administration of 
study drug of >4 hours, the dose should not be taken. Study drug administration may 
continue but the missed dose should not be made up and the planned timi ng of subsequent 
study drug dosing should not be altered.  
For subjects who vomit shortly after taking apilimod dimesylate, the vomi ted dose should not be 
replaced. The planned timing of subsequent apilimod dimesylate dosing should not be altered. 
Section 6.6.6 Dose Modifications  
Change: Information has been updated to reflection inclusion of additional dose levels and 
schedules. 
If a subject experiences an AE that is suspected to be related t o apilimod dimesylate, appropriate 
supportive care (e.g., antiemetics, antidiarrheals, therapy for tumor lysis syndrome [TLS]) should 
be instituted consistent with the n ature of the event.  
If a subject experiences an apilimod dimesylate -related DLT (reference  Section Deleted ) or 
other AE requiring a dose modification , then the study drug administration should be 
interrupted until the toxicity recovers to Grade ≤  1 or baseline. Upon resumption of study drug, 
the total daily dose of apilimod dimesylate should be reduced using an appropriate  by 1 dose 
level or schedule (reference Section Deleted ) as agreed between t he investigator and medical 
monitor. Successive adjustments to progressively lower total daily dose levels can be made. If 
the subject cannot tolerate apilimod dimesylate after a decrease to Do se Level -1 (25 mg BID), 
then the subject should be discontinued from apilimod dimesylate therapy unles s continued 
treatment is permitted by the medical monitor.  Clinical Study Report

Version 9, 18 Feb 2020 
AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprie tary Page 209 of 312 After the apilimod dimesylate dose is reduced, the dose can be mainta ined at that dose level or 
schedule, even if there is minimal or no toxicity with the r educed dosing regimen. However, if 
the subject tolerates a reduced total daily dose of apilimod dimesylate for ≥  4 weeks then the 
apilimod dimesylate dosing regimen may be reescalated to the nexta higher total daily dose 
level at the discretion of the inve stigator and with the concurrence of the medical monitor . 
Such reescalation may be particularly warranted if the AE compris ed TLS or if further evaluation 
reveals that the AE that led to the dose reduction was not relate d to apilimod dimesylate. 
Successive adjustments to progressively higher total daily dose levels can be made. However, 
the escalated dose cannot exceed the total daily starting dose level for that subject during the 
first 4 cycles of therapy.  
Individual subjects who initiated treatment at a  total daily dose level below the lower of the 
currently established MTD or the RP2D and who have not experienced a DLT after ≥  4 cycles of 
treatment may have the apilimod dimesylate total daily dose escalated to the next higher dose 
level if both the prin cipal investigator and the medical monitor agree that a dose escalati on is 
medically warranted (e.g., for a subject with stable disease who i s tolerating the current dose 
level of apilimod dimesylate therapy). In such subjects, successive adjustments to progressively 
higher total daily dose levels can be made at intervals of ≥  4 weeks with the condition that the 
escalated total daily dose level cannot exceed the lower of the currently established MTD or  
RP2D.  
In a subject who experiences a DLT precluding resumption of apilimod dim esylate therapy 
during a cycle, a new cycle of treatment may begin at the later of Day 29 or when AEs or 
laboratory abnormalities related to apilimod dimesylate have returne d to baseline levels. If drug-
related AEs or laboratory abnormalities precluding further adminis tration of study drug are not 
resolved to baseline by Day 29, week-by- week delays in initiating the new cycle of treatment 
should be instituted. When all drug- related AEs and laboratory abnormalities have returned to 
baseline, the next cycle of therapy can be initiat ed. Upon initiation of a new cycle of therapy, the 
prior cycle of therapy will be considered completed. 
Investigators are to discuss modifications in the dosing regimen wit h the medical monitor. The 
appropriate clinic staff should dispense the study drug for the new dose l evel or schedule and 
instruct the subject/caregiver about the change in dose levelthe dosing regimen .

Change: The section has been clarified to indicate that al l subjects will be followed for 
survival  and to provide additional information regarding out how that follow- up will 
be performed. 
All subjects will be treated for at least 1 cycle unless there is e vidence of unacceptable toxicity or 
PD. Although subjects may continue to receive study treatment until exper iencing unacceptable 
toxicity or disease progression, it is estimated that each subject w ill participate for an average of 
6 months of treatment and an additional 1 month of follow-up. Subjects who have  discontinued 
study treatment for reasons other than PD will be assessed per R evised Response Criteria for 
NHL or Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of CLL at a m inimum of every 12 weeks 
until documentation of PD, start of new anti- cancer therapy or f or up to 1 year from the last 
enrolled subject’s first treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1), whichever com es first. Long-term follow-up 
survival information will be obtained in all surviving subjects  who permanently 
discontinue study therapy. Such information may be collected at ~3 - to 6-month intervals 
at the sponsor’s discretion through 3 years. This long- term follow-up information will be

undergone the baseline radiology examination and is otherwise considered e ligible for study 
participation.  
Section 8.6.2 Medications for AE Management – Gastrointestinal AEs  
Change: Recommendations regarding management of gastrointestinal AEs have been updated 
to reflect the evolving safety profile of the study drug.  
While prophylactic antiemetics can be considered, it is preferred th at antiemetics not be 
given prophylactically before initial study drug administration on  Cycle 1, Day 1.  
It is recommended that, if prophylactic or therapeutic antiemetics are required, subjects be 
offered 2 mg of the serotonin antagonist, granisetron (Kytril®, Gr anisol®), as an oral 
tablet or solution every 6 hours as needed. If subjects have pe rsistent nausea or vomiting, 
consideration can be given to application of a 31.3 mg granisetron trans dermal patch 
(Sancuso®) every 3 to 7 days. For transdermal prophylaxis, 24 to 48 hours may be  
necessary to allow a sufficient period to achieve effective grani setron systemic 
concentrations. Use of the serotonin antagonists, ondansetron (Zof ran®, Zuplenz®) or 
dolasetron (Anz emet®), is discouraged due to the possibility that such agents could prolong 
the cardiac QT interval.   
Based on currently available information regarding LAM-002A metabolis m, the 
neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist, rolapitant (Varubi®), can be co nsidered, but aprepitant 
(Emend®) or netupitant+palonosetron (Akynzeo®) should be avoided bec ause these drugs 
may inhibit CYP3A4 and/or CYP2C9 activity.

avoid immunocompromise; however, corticosteroids can be introduced if other types of 
antiemetic agents are not sufficiently effective.   
Management of nausea and/or vomiting: Prophylactic anti emetic therapy will not be used in this 
study. However, it may be implemented if it is demonstr ated that LAM 002A (apilimod 
dimesylate capsules) clearly causes acute nausea and vomiting. If pr ophylactic anti emetic 
therapy is needed, 5 HT3 receptor antagonists and benzodiazepines should be tried first. 
Additionally, anti emetic therapy may be used a s needed in the individual management of 
subjects who develop nausea and/or vomiting. 
For mManagement of diarrhea , it is recommended that s : Subjects should be instructed to take 
loperamide, 4 mg, at the occurrence of the first loose stool and then 2 mg every 2 hours until 
they are diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. More aggressive loperamide administration or 
titration of loperamide dosing for each loose bowel movement may be  considered. During 
the night, subjects may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours. Subjects shoul d be advised to 
avoid dehydration through adequate fluid intake .  Drugs such as 5HT3 antagonists or 
octreotide may be considered for their anti -secretory effects:  
As with any AE, s Sites should consider providing study participants with ant iemetics and 
antidiarrheals so that these supportive care medications are readil y available in case 
gastrointestinal symptoms develop. S ubjects who develop nausea, vomiting or diarrhea should 
be monitored closely until the event is resolved/stabilized. 
Section 8.8 Treatment Compliance  
Change: Information has been updated to reflection inclusion of additional schedules.  
The investigator will dispense the study medication only for use by subjects e nrolled in the study 
as described in this protocol. The study medication is not to be used for  reasons other than those 
described in this protocol. 
The investigator or other study staff will supervise study drug treatment gi ven at the site and 
instruct the subject on study medication self- administration. Subjects wil l be asked to bring their 
dosing diary with them at each visit. Compliance with protocol-defined st udy drug intake will be 
checked by pill count at the end of each cycle and compliance decisions w ill be made by the 
investigator. 
A subject is considered to be DLT-evaluable if he/she has taken at least 75% (42/56 BID

Section 14.1 Determination of Sample Size  
Change: Information regarding the sample sizes has been updated to reflect inclusion of 
additional dose levels and schedules.  
This Phase 1 trial is being conducted primarily to assess the safe ty and tolerability of LAM-002 A 
(apilimod dimesylate capsules) when administe red in subjects with relapsed or refractory B -cell 
NHL and to determine the MTD and RP2D of LAM-002A. No formal sample- size estimation 
was performed. The choice of the number of subjects was based on the standard 3 + 3 design that 
is commonly used in Phase 1 trials of anti-cancer investigational drugs. For the Dose Escalation 
Stage of the study, the maximum sample size will be approximately 60 30 subjects if 6 subjects 
are assigned at to each of the 9 potential dose levels 0 to 4 and an additional 6 patients  are 
accrued at the RP2D . However, additional subjects may be added if exploration of intermediate  
dose level(s) of LAM -002A is warranted.  
Up to 45 additional evaluable subjects (3 cohorts of 15 subjects) may be enrolled at the RP2D 
and schedule in the Expansion Stage of the study. The safety population will consist of all 
subjects receiving at least 1 dose of LAM-002A. The assessment of D LT and MTD will involve 
only those subjects completing the first cycle of therapy, unless the s ubject discontinuation in 
first cycle was due to a DLT.

14.3.1  Full Analysis Sets  
The full analysis set includes all subjects who receive ≥1 dose of study drug. T his analysis 
set will be used in the analyses of subject characteristics,  study drug administration and 
compliance, safety, and categorical and time- to-event efficacy outcomes. In analyses of 
response rates in the full analysis set, subjects who do not ha ve sufficient baseline and on -
study tumor assessments to characterize response ( i.e., have a best overall response of NE) 
will be counted as failures.  
14.3.2  Responding Analysis Set  
The responding analysis set includes subjects in the full analysis  set who have mea surable 
disease, who can be evaluated for tumor response with both basel ine and on-study tumor 
evaluations, and who achieve a CR, CRi, or PR. This analysis set w ill be used in the 
analyses of time to response and duration of response. 
14.3.3  Evaluable Sets 
The evaluable analysis sets include subjects in the full analysi s set who have the necessary 
baseline and on -study measurements to provide interpretable results for specific 
parameters of interest. These analysis sets will be used in th e analyses of changes in tumor 
dimensions, PK parameters, and pharmacodynamic parameters.   
14.3.1 Pharmacokinetic Evaluable Population 
The primary analysis of PK will use the PK Evaluable Population, whi ch consists of enrolled 
subjects who have all of their PK samples collected in Cycle 1, who did not have any major 
protocol deviations and who are evaluable for C max or AUC0t analysis. 
14.3.2 Pharmacodynamic Evaluable Population 
The population of subjects evaluable for pharmacodynamics will include al l subjects who have 
tissue or PBMCs available for analysis at baseline and during treatme nt, and for which an 
assessment of changes (e.g., gene expression, vacuolation, PIKfyve inhibition)  is technically 
feasible.  
14.3.3 Safety Population 
For safety analyses, the Safety Population will be used. This population c onsists of subjects who 
have taken at least one dose of LAM 002A. 
14.3.4 DLT Evaluable Population 
Dose escalation decisions will be evaluated in DLT evaluable populat ion. The DLT evaluable 
population will include subjects who complete Cycle 1 dosing (administere d at least 75% of 
doses) and have sufficient safety data, or who are withdrawn from s tudy due to a DLT in 
Cycle 1.

monitored as inpatients during the first 24 to 48 hours of LAM-002A administration. 
The risk for TLS should must be considered based on established algorithms (Cairo 2010, 
MDACC  2013, Roberts 2016): 
•Low-risk: Serum LDH ≤  ULN, all measurable lymph nodes < 5 cm, and absolute
lymphocyte count (ALC) < 25 × 109/L
•Intermediate risk : Serum LDH >  1 to ≤ 2 × ULN, ≥ 1 measurable lymph node with an
LD of ≥ 5 but < 10 cm, or ALC ≥  25 × 109/L
•High risk: Serum LDH >  2 × UL N, ≥ 1 measurable lymph node with a LD of
≥ 10 cm, or both ≥ 1 measurable lymph node with an LD of ≥  5 but < 10 cm and ALC
≥ 25 × 109/L
Subjects who are at intermediate or high risk of TLS must receiv e medical prophylaxis 
according to the following prophyl axis regimens or similar institutional regimens : 
If, during the dose escalation it is observed that the study drug appears t o induce TLS, 
subsequent subjects who are at risk should be considered for medical prophyl axis of TLS and 
according to local prevention paradigms. Alternatively, investigators ma y wish to consider the 
following regimens for prophylaxis in subjects at intermediate or high r isk of TLS: 
•Intermediate Risk of TLS : These subjects shouldcan receive allopurinol, 100 to
300 mg orally every 8 ho urs starting ≥ 24 to 48 hours before the initial administration
of apilimod dimesylate LAM-002A on Cycle 1-Day 1 of therapy; of note, the
maximum daily allopurinol dose is 800 mg, doses ≤ 300 mg need not be dividedClinical Study Report

monitoring during the first 24 to 48 hours of LAM-002A administrati on. 
Section 6.6.7 Definition of Dose- Limiting Toxicity (DLT) – Footnote to Table 3. Criteria for 
Defining Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)  
Change: TLS has been removed as a DLT exclusion. 
Note: Known oncologic emergencies from NHL (e.g., tumor lysis syndrome,  spinal cord compression, ureteric 
obstruction, lymphomatous meningitis, and superior vena cava syndrome) will not be considered as dose -limiting 
toxicities.

AI Therapeutics Conf idential and Proprietary Pa ge 219 of 312 I Pregnancy testing ( serum or urine) will be required for women of childbearing potenti al (WCBP) only. Testing is required at Screening; within 72  hours of 
Day 1 of each cycle and at EOT. Test does not need to be repeated on C1D1 if baseline wa s negative and conducted within 72 hours of first dose.  
J Imaging as appropriate for disease indication will be conducted wit hin 30 days of the first dose of study treatment. Suitable  scans performed prior to screening 
and within 30 days before first dose may be used for baseline tumor as sessments. 
K Assessment of disease status will be conducted with standard clini cal measurements: PE, CBCs, bone marrow aspirates/biopsies,  and imaging as appropriate 
for indication. During treatment, scans will be repeated for tumor  assessment within 7 days of Day 1, Cycles 3, 5, and 7 then every 3 m onths until PD or use of 
alternative antineoplastic therapy. For subjects still in respon se after 1 year, intervals for radiographic surveillance may be every 6 months. Subjects with CLL 
who achieve CR will requ ire assessment of MRD by flow cytometry of bone marrow and per ipheral blood. 
L Imaging at EOT is not required if PD has already been radiographica lly documented or last imaging was within 30 days of EOT v isit. 
M Subjects with CLL/SLL must provide either a fresh blood sample containing circulating tumor cells or a bone marrow aspirate sample pretreatment. Tissue 
will be submitted for evaluation of the percentage of tumor cells and analysis of genetic alterations and/or gene expression that may predict antica ncer activity 
and/or pharmacodynamic activity. In addition, for subjects with CLL/SL L, the sponsor may arrange for a portion of the sample to be evaluat ed at a 
sponsor-specified laboratory for known prognostic markers (e.g., quantitati ve immunoglobulins, FISH panel [chromosome 11q deletion, 13q deletion, 
17p deletion and 12  trisomy], DNA mutational analysis for p53, IgHV [including IgHV3 -21], and other genes of interest in CLL [e.g., Notch]; flow cytometr y 
[for CD5, CD10, CD11c, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD38, CD45, kappa and lambda lig ht chains and ZAP -70], and/or β2-microglobulin). The baseline bone 
marrow aspiration procedure (if required) should be performed after the study candidate has undergone the baseline radiology examination and is  otherwise 
considered eligible for study participation. All subjects  with CLL/SLL must have baseline imaging (with CT sca ns [preferred] or MRI scans).  
N Blood sampling for determination of the plasma concentrations of apilimod and metabolites will be performed on C1D1 and C1D8 as follows: pre -dose, 
30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6,  8 hours post-first dose of the day. C1D15 pre -dose only. Additional PK samples will be collected, if possible, whenever a subject has a 
study treatment -related SAE or QTc > 500 msec. Subjects are required to come to t he study site in a fasting state prior  to the collection of certain PK samples. 
For analyte determination, PK back -up sample will be used from time points: Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1  Day 8 pre-dose. 
O Bone marrow aspirates/biopsies performed within 2 months prior to fi rst dose may be used for c linical baseline assessments. For subjects with NHL, 
baseline bone marrow biopsies/aspirates may be omitted if not deeme d essential for response assessment or patient management.  For subjects with CLL/SLL, a 
baseline bone marrow aspirate is required unless  the presence of sufficient circulating cells in the peripheral blood  (e.g., absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] ≥  10 
x 109/L) permits assessment of baseline parameters as described in Foot note m, above.  
P If necessary per applicable response criteria, a repea t bone marrow biopsy or aspirate will be required for subjects w ho have a CR by imaging and physical 
examination. 
Q Archival or fresh tumor tissue from the most recent available biops y or surgery prior to first dose in subjects with NHL must  be obtained pretreatment. For 
subjects undergoing a biopsy, adequate tumor tissue should be acquired via exci sional biopsy, incisional biopsy or core needl e biopsy (e.g., ≥  3 passes using a 
16-gauge core needle). Alternatively, cells from a bone marrow aspir ate may be obtained in subjects with bone marrow involvement due to NHL. Tissue wil l 
be submitted for evaluation of the percentage of tumor cells and anal ysis of genetic alterations and/or gene expression that may predict a nti-lymphoma 
activity and/or pharmacodynamics  activity. In addition, for subjects with NHL, tumor may be evaluate d for known prognostic characteristics (e.g., for 
DLBCL: ABC or GCB subtype; expression of BCL2, BCL6, Ki -67, CD20, and MYC; other mutational status). The baseline biopsy procedure  (if required) 
should be performed after the study candidate has undergone the baseline radiology examination and is otherwise considered el igible for study participation.  
R Blood smears will be collected for microscopic evaluation of vacuole  formation on C1D1 and C1D8 as follows: pre -dose, 4 hrs and 8 hrs post first dose of the 
day. C1D15 pre -dose only. 
S  Plasma will be collected for evaluation of circulating cytokines ( including IL-12 and IL-23) predose on each of Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 8, and Cycle 1 
Day 15. 
T  PBMCs will be collected on Cycle 1, Day 1 pre -treatment; on Cycle 1, Day 1 at 8  hours post-dose; and on Cycle 1, Day 8 at 8 hours post -dose for 
determination of changes in gene expression that may predict or correl ate with anti-lymphoma activity and/ or pharmacodynamic activity.  Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Conf idential and Proprietary Page 221 of 312 Changes made in Amendment 6 (25 Oct 2017) 
In preparing this amendmen t of the protocol document, the following changes were made. 
Explanations of the changes are provided in italics as “ Changes.” Inserted text is indicated by 
red bold font. Deleted text is indicated by red strikeout font . Changes to the synopsis also 
appear in the body of the protocol ; thus, changes to the synopsis are not described and only 
changes to the body of the protocol are described. 
General Change  
Change: Where applicable and as appropriate for the context, the name “apilimod 
dimesylate” was redes ignated as LAM-002A. Similarly, to provide clarity, the term 
“study drug” was modified to “LAM-002A,” when appropriate.

I have read the attached Protocol entitled “A Phase 1 Dose Escal ation Study of the Safety and 
Pharmacokinetics of LAM -002A (apilimod dimesylate capsules) Administered Orally in 
Subjects with Rela psed or Refractory B -cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma” dated 25 Oct 2017 
14 Apr 2017.  
 
Section  4.1.1. Pharmacology  
Change: An additional reference was added to replace a former reference to unpublished data, 
and all references were hyperlinked to the bibliography. 
Apilimod and apilimod dimesylate were originally introduced into clinical tr ials based on 
apilimod’s immunomodulatory properties ( Wada 2007; Wada 2012). Apilimod inhibits the 
production of inte rleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL- 23), and was effective in preclinical 
animal models of various autoimmune diseases that are mediated by the  inappropriate expression 
of T-helper cell phenotype (Th1) cytokines ( Wada 2007).  
Recently published data (and LAM Therapeutics  unpublished data in cancer cells) have shown 
that apilimod is a potent and highly selective first-in-class phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate- 5 
kinase (PIKfyve) inhibitor ( Cai 2013, Gayle 2017). In total, LAM has tested 456 kinases, 
including disease-relevant kinases, for their ability to bind to apili mod. The screening 
concentration of apilimod was 1 µM, a concentration that is > 12,000 t imes greater than the Kd 
(81 picomolar) for apilimod against PIKfyve. The results showed that apilimod did not bind to 
any of the 456 kinases tested. 
Inhibition of PIKfyve by pharmacological methods as well as RNA inter ference (RNAi) 
produces swollen vacuoles and disruption of endomembrane dynamics. In cell c ulture, the 
pharmacological disruption of PIKfyve with apilimod induces selective le thality of specific Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Conf idential and Proprietary Page 223 of 312 Section  4.1.4.2. Efficacy  
Change: Efficacy information from the study in patients with hematological malignancies was 
updated to reflect data as of 30  Sep 2017. 
Efficacy data in patients with hematological malignancies are evolvingpending. As of 30 Sep 
2017, positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrated systemic part ial metabolic 
responses in nodal and extranodal lesions in 3 patients wi th refractory DLBCL (treated at 
100 mg BID, 75 mg TID, and 125 mg BID) (1 of whom also received radia tion for bulky 
axillary adenopathy); concomitant computed tomography (CT) demonstrat ed anatomic 
shrinkage of many lesions. One additional subject with transf ormed, refractory DLBCL 
(treated at 125 mg  BID) experienced tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). One patient  with 
marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) (treated at 125 mg BID) has had a metabolic response by 
PET together with a 43% decrease in the sum of the products of the perpendicular 
diameters (SPD) of index le sions by CT. Another patient with MZL and a patient with 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (both receiving 100 mg BID) experienced prolonged 
stable disease through 11+ and 14 cycles, respectively. One patient, a 60 yearold male with 
GCBDLBCL who was had experienced minimal or no response to multiple prior 
chemoimmunotherapy regimens (including R CHOP), received apilimod dimesylate at 
100 mg/dose BID for 6 weeks before enlarging right axillary lymphadenopathy r equired 
cessation of study drug and intervention with local radiation therapy. A foll owup PETCT, 
obtained approximately 2 weeks later, showed a substantial systemic de crease in DLBCL lesions 
in nonirradiated lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and bone (C4 vertebra); these i mprovements in 
disease burden were attributed by the investigator to the study drug. 
Section 4.1. 4.3. Safety  
Change: Safety data in the second paragraph were updated. 
No renal insufficiency has been observed in completed clinical trials to date  except in 1 patient 
with DLBCL who acutely  developed transient elevations in serum creatinine and b lood-
urea nitrogen (BUN) due to tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) shortl y after starting LAM -002A 
at a dose of 125 mg BID. And no clinically significant safety signals in laboratory, physical 
examination, or vital sign findings have been noted One patient with a h ematological malignancy 
receiving the drug at 150 mg BID developed asymptomatic Grade 3 hyponatre mia that was 
attributed to the combined effects of a apilimoddimesylateinduced LAM-002A-induced 
diarrhea and hydrochlorothiazide administration. No other clinically significant safety signals 
in laboratory, physical examination, or vital sign findings have been n oted. 
Section  4.1.5. Overview of Indication  
Change: Background information was added to the fourth paragraph to support the 
combination of LAM -002A with rituximab or atezolizumab. 
Patients with DLBCL who relapse after, or who are not candidates for ASCT , as well as patients 
with relapsed MCL, MZL, FL, and CLL/SLL are not considered curative curable with 
conventional therapies. Therefore, management of relap sed and refractory NHL remains an 
unmet medical need .  Patients with recurrent disease are commonly given sequential 
regimens of chemotherapeutic, immunotherapeutic, or investigati onal agents in an attempt 
to control disease manifestations. Rituximab is commonly employed in combination with Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Conf idential and Proprietary Page 224 of 312 other agents (Zelentz  2014). Newer immunopotentiating approaches using anti -PD1/PDL1 
inhibitors (including atezolizumab [ https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]1 ]) are 
being explored and have shown evidence of activity in patients with recurren t NHL 
(Ilcus 2017). However, despite use of agents with differing mechanisms  of action, 
progressive resistance to treatment typically develops. Patients wit h refractory or multiply 
relapsed progressive disease have poor prognoses and are ultimately  likely to die of their 
cancers. Novel mechanisms of action are needed that can be admini stered alone or in  
combination with existing chemoimmunotherapeutic approac hes to offer additional 
treatment options for patients with hematological cancers who have experienced disease 
progression. 
Section  5. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
Change: The section was updated to indicate that LAM-002A will be evaluated alone and in 
combination with other drugs and to indicate changes in the types of 
pharmacodynamic assays that will be performed based on evolving experience with 
these exploratory endpoints. Only the sections in wh ich changes were made are 
shown. 
5. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE 
The overall purpose of this Phase 1 study is to explore the safety and t olerability of LAM-002 A 
when given alone and in combination  for the treatment of subjects  with relapsed or refractory 
B-cell NHL.  
5.3. Exploratory Objectives 
• To evaluate the phar macodynamic effects of LAM -002A, administered orally, in 
plasma assays and on surrogate tissue ( e.g., vacuoles in peripheral blood smears, 
gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PB MCs]/B cells, and plasma 
cytokines [including (IL)-12 and IL-23]).  
• To evaluate tumor for gene expression and genetic alterations (with s aliva and/or 
B-cell-depleted PBMC collection for germ-line control) and surrogate tissue 
(PBMC/B cells) for gene expression that may predict anti- lymphoma activity.  
• To evaluate plasma for changes in analytes or tumor for protein expression that 
may predict anti -lymphoma activity . 
5.6. Exploratory Endpoints 
• Extent of PIKfyve inhibition as determined by plasma inhibitory assays the extent of 
vacuole formation in white blood cells in p eripheral blood smears by microscopic 
evaluation 
• Changes in gene expression in PBMCs 
• Changes in plasma cytokines (including IL-12 and IL-23) 
• Correlation between genetic alterations as determined b y next generation sequencing 
and/or gene expression in tumor tissue, circulating tumor DNA,  or PBMCs/B cells 
and anti-lymphoma activity following treatment with LAM -002A  Clinical Study Report

anti-lymphoma activity following treatment with LAM -002A as determined by 
proteomic tools 
 
Section  6.1.1. LAM -002A Dose Escalation Stage  
Change: Based on findings that nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were treatment-limiting when 
LAM -002A was given continuously at a dose ≥150  mg twice per day (BID), a plan for 
furthe r dose exploration using an intermittent LAM-002A dosing regimen with  
antiemetic and antidiarrheal support was defined (see also Section 6.6). The section 
was modified accordingly. 
The maximum toler ated dose (MTD) will be determined during the dose- escalation stage, 
evaluating both continuous and intermittent dosing regimens.  Subjects will accrue using a 3 
+ 3 design. During this stage, the decision to open a new cohort at a higher  or lower dose leve l 
will be made by the participating clinical investigator s and sponsor when all subjects in the 
current cohort have been treated through at least Week  4 or once 2 DLTs have occurred in that 
dose cohort. All available safety and PK data will be considered in a  decision by the medical 
monitor in collaboration with  the investigators to dose escalate, de -escalate, expand the current 
cohort or explore an alternate regimens scheduleof drug administration. The MTD will be 
determined based primarily on DLTs observed through Week 4 in at least ≥ 6 subjects.  
 
Section  6.1.2. Expansion Stage  
Change: Based on emerging clinical data, the disease indications to be evaluated in the 
expansion stage of the study were  established. In addition, based on emerging 
nonclinical data, the combination regimens to be evaluated in the expansion stage 
were defined. The section was modified accordingly. 
Once the MTD and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule is det ermined, the study 
will enter the expansion stage, in which 3 cohorts of 15 subjects each will be accrued in order to 
obtain additional information on safety, tolerability, preliminary anti-tum or activity, PK, and 
pharmacodynamic data at the RP2D and schedule when LAM-002A is administered alone or 
in combination with rituximab or atezolizumab. Expa nsion-stage cohorts will comprise 
groups of subjects with specific types of previously treated, relapsed, progressive, and

Secti on 6.1.3 . Subject Allocation (Stages 1 and 2)  
Change: Consistent with the plan to perform dose-ranging evaluation of intermittent 
LAM -002A administration and to assess monotherapy and combination therapy 
cohorts using continuous LAM-002A administration, this section was added to 
provide information on subject allocation and to describe restrictions to enrollment 
in Stage 1 and Stage 2 enrollment to enhance study safety. 
Subjects will be allocated to the cohorts by the study sponsor w orking in collaboration with 
each investigator considering the availability of openings for enrol lment in Stage 1 or 2, 
disease type (i.e., FL, MZL, DLBCL- GCB, DLBCL -ABC, or other indications), therapy 
history (e.g., prior use of anti-CD20 or anti-PD1/PDL1 antibodies), and current disease 
status (e.g., potential to benefit from rituximab treatment base d on past responses to anti-
CD20 antibody therapy).  
During Stage 1 dose ranging with LAM-002A monotherapy, allocation will  be performed 
according to a 3+3 dose- escalation procedure with the requireme nt that each cohort of 3 
subjects be observed for ≥4  weeks before another cohort is enrolled (as detailed in 
Section 6.6). During Stage 2 cohort expansion evaluating LAM-002A monotherapy, 
allocation will be performed as subjects present to the accruing clinics and there will be no 
specific restrictions on the cadence of enrollment.  During Stage 2 cohort-expansion of 
LAM-002A combinations with rituximab and atezolizumab, enrollment of the first 3 
subjects in each combination cohort will be restricted such that each subject must be 
enrolled sequentially and observed for ≥3 weeks before the next subjec t is enrolled. 
Beginning with the 4th patient in each combination group, further enrollment may proceed 
without restriction as long as the continuous reassessmen t boundaries for toxic drug 
discontinuations are not met (as detailed in Section 6.8.2.5 and Section 6.12). Clinical Study Report

Version 9, 18 Feb 2020 
AI Therapeutics Conf idential and Proprietary Page 227 of 312 Section 6.1.4 Subject Evaluability  
Change: This section was added to clarify subject evaluability for the dose-ranging and 
cohort-expansion portions of the study.  
A Stage 1 subject will be considered evaluable if the subject meets the d efinition for 
evaluability of Cycle 1 DLT as described in Section  6.6. A Stage 2 subject will be considered 
evaluable if the subject has both baseline and ≥1 on -study tumor assessment s sufficient to 
allow a determination of response to study therapy. 
 
Section  6.2.  Number of Subjects  
Change: The number of subjects was updated to reflect the new dose-escalation and 
cohort-expansion plans. 
As many as 110  Approximately 115 evaluable subjects (evaluable subjects include those who 
complete Cycle 1 dosing [administered at least 75% of doses] and have s ufficient safety data, or 
who are withdrawn from the study due to a DLT in Cycle 1) will be enrolled, assuming that: 
• In the dose-escalation stage of the study, the total number of subjects will depend 
upon the numbers of subjects accrued to each dose level and the number of dos e 
levels evaluated. If 6 subjects are enrolled at all 9 possible open starting dose levels 
(Dose Levels 5, 6, 7, and 8)  and 6 additional subjects are enrolled at the MTD or RD, 
as many as 60 30 subjects could be enrolled. To allow for the possibility that some 
subjects may not be fully evaluable for DLT or that an intermediat e dose level might 
be evaluated, up to ~ 70 45 subjects may be enrolled.  
• In the expansion stage of the study, if all 3 8 potential expansion cohorts of 15 
6 evaluable subjects are accrued, as many as 45 48 subjects could be enrolled. To 
allow for the possibility that some subjects may not be fully evaluab le for efficacy, up 
to ~55 65 subjects may be enrolled. Subjects will be treated at the RP2D and schedule 
determined in the Dose Escalation Stage of the study.  
 
Section  6.6.  LAM -002A Dose -Escalation Procedures 
Change: Table 3 was updated consistent with the new dose-escalation and cohort-expansion 
plans. The initial dose level of the 150 mg BID to be explored with intermittent dosing 
represented  a modest increment over the recommended Phase 2 continuous dosing 
regimen of 125 mg BID. The text definition of “DLT evaluable” was updated to 
include the minimum required dosing.   Clinical Study Report

Dose escalation decisions will be evaluated in a DLT -evaluable population. The DLT- evaluable 
population will include subjects who complete Cycle 1 dosing or who are wi thdrawn from study 
due to a DLT in Cycle 1. A subject will be deemed non-evaluable for de termining DLTs and will 
not be counted toward the total cohort size if the subject did not experi ence a DLT, did not 
receive at least 75% (42/56 BID schedule; 63/84 TID schedule , 18/24 intermittent schedule ) of 
the planned first- cycle doses or discontinued from the study prior to completing necessary safety 
evaluations through the first 28 days of study treatment. These subjects m ay be replaced unless 
accrual to the cohort has stopped due to DLT. 
Section  6.7.  Definition of LAM -002A Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
Change: Information regarding DLT definitions was moved to this section (previously in 
Section  6.7.2.5) to provide an easier flow of concepts. No changes to the substance of 
the DLT definitions  were made  except that  the inability to administer the required 
minimum number of doses on the intermittent schedule due to drug- related AEs was 
added as a necessary new DLT criterion. 
A DLT will be defined as an AE or abnormal laboratory valu e meeting the criteria in 
Table 3 and that is asses sed as unrelated to disease, a comorbid condition, intercurrent 
illness, or concomitant medications (see Table  4). For the purposes of dose escalation and 
determination of the LAM -002A MTDs, DLTs that occur within the first cycle of treatment 
must be included in decisions regarding dose escalation. DLTs or other cli nically significant 
toxicities that occur after Cycle 1 may also be considered when d etermining the RP2D.  Clinical Study Report

Section  6.8.1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome Prophylaxis and Therapy  
Change: The h eading of the section was changed, as shown above, and information on TLS 
management was condensed under a single section within the protocol document. 
6.8.2 TLS Management  
Information regarding TLS prophylaxis is provided in Section 6.6.1. 
Subjects who develop TLS may experience hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia,  hyperuricemia, 
hyperphosphatemia, cardiac dysrhythmias, and acute renal failure;  thus, close monitoring 
of electrolytes is important after initial therapy.  
Subjects with TLS should receive intravenous hydration, rapid reversal of hyperkalemia, 
antihyperuricemic agents, and appropriate cardiac and renal support , including dialysis as 
indicated. Upon recovery to baseline functioning and as medically  appropriate, such 
subjects should continue with protocol therapy to maintain tu mor control. 
 
Section  6.8.2. LAM -002A 
Change: Information regarding LAM-002A administration, dose modifications, and supportive 
care was consolidated in one location in the protocol text, and this section was 
updated consistent with the new dose-escalation and cohort-expansion plans. The 
description of the study drug was removed from Section 6.8 and consolidated in a 
single location in Section 9.1 to avoid redundancy. The types of adverse events 
typically requiring LAM-002A dose modification were described .  Given that 
LAM -002A has no obvious cumulative toxicity, allowance was made for dose 
escalation after Cycle 2 of therapy if such an escalation might be medically 
appropriate considering subject tolerance and antitumor efficacy. More detailed and 
protocol-specific guidelines for antiemetic prophylaxis and antidiarrheal prophylaxis 
were  included based on current ASCO guidelines. 
6.8.2.1. Premedications  
Subjects taking LAM -002A by continuous administration may be offered antiemetics and 
antidiarrheals as necessary to control gastroint estinal symptoms as described in 
Section 6.8.2.6.1 For subject who do develop such adverse effects, sites sh ould consider 
providing study participants with antiemetics and antidiarrheals  so that these supportive 
care medications are readily available in ca se gastrointestinal symptoms related to 
LAM-002A recur or persist.  
Subjects taking LAM -002A by intermittent administration are required to receive 
prophylactic antiemetic supportive care as described in Section  6.8.2.6.2. 
6.7.2. Description of Study Drug 
LAM002A (apilimod dimesylate capsule) is intended for oral administration. E ach capsule will 
contain 25 mg or 50 of apilimod dimesylate (equivalent to 17.1 mg or 34.3 mg of apil imod free 
base, respectively). The 25 mg capsule is Swedish orange and the 50mg capsule is white. Both Clinical Study Report

information, see Section 9.1 
6.8.2.2. In-Clinic LAM-002A Administration  
For subjects receiving the continuous LAM -002A regimen, On Cycle 1 Day 1, and Cycle 1 
Day 8 the morning dose of LAM-002A should be orally administered on Cycle 1 Day 1 and 
Cycle 1 Day 8 (after a minimum fasting state of 6 to 8 hours) by site staff immediately after the 
collection of the biomarker samples and pre-do se PK sample. Subjects are allowed to eat after 
PK Sample #4 (Hour 2) has been collected. On Cycle 1 Day 15, the morning dose of 
LAM-002A should be orally administered ( after a minimum fast ing state of 6 to 8 hours) by site 
staff immediately after collecti on of the pre-dose PK and biomarker samples.  
For subjects receiving the intermittent LAM -002A regimen, prophylactic antiemetics are a 
required component of the regimen as described in Section  6.8.2.5.2. After initiation of the 
antiemetic regimen, the morn ing dose of LAM-002 A should be orally administered on 
Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 10 (after a minimum fast of 6 hours) by site staff after the 
collection of the biomarker samples and pre -dose PK sample. Subjects are allowed to eat 
after PK Sample #4 (Hour 2) has been collected. Similarly, on Cyc le 1 Day 8 and Cycle 1 
Day 15, the antiemetic regimen should be initiated and the mor ning dose of LAM-002 A 
should be orally administered (after a minimum fast of 6 ho urs) by site staff immediately 
after collection of the pre-dose samples.  
When given as a component of combination therapy with rituximab, L AM-002A will be 
started on Cycle 1 Day 1 with a BID schedule. LAM-002 A will be administered after 
administration of premedications (see Section  6.8.3.1) and ~15 to 30 minutes prior to the 
start of the initial rituximab infusion.  On Cycle 1 Day 8, the morning dose of LAM-002 A 
will be administered after premedications (see Section  6.8.3.1) and ~15 to 30 minutes prior 
to the rituximab infusion.  
When given as a component of combination therapy with atezolizumab , LAM-002A will be 
started on Cycle 1 Day 1 with a BID schedule. LAM-002A will be administered ~15 to 
30 minutes prior to the start of the initial atezolizumab infu sion.  On Cycle  1 Day 8, the 
morning dose of LAM-002A will be administered ~15 to 30 minutes p rior to the 
atezolizumab infusion.  
6.8.2.3. LAM-002A Self-Administration  
Except for the days where treatment is administered in the clinic, LAM-002A will be self-
administered orally, BID or TID of each 28- day cycle until disease progression or other 
discontinuation criteria are met. When taking the drug at home, subjects should be advised to 
take LAM-002A with ≥ 4 oz. (~160 mL) of water at the same times each day. Subjects on a BID 
schedule will be advised to take the doses at ~12 hours apart (e.g., 8:00 A M and 8:00 PM) (+/-
 1-hour window). Subjects on a TID schedule will be advised to take th e doses at intervals of ~6 
to 8 hours. When self- administering LAM-002A at home, subjects may take the drug in the fed 
or fasted state. On PK days, subjects should come to clinic fasted (a minimum fasting state of 6 
to 8 hours) and take the dose at the site under supervision. All subject s will be required to 
complete a dosing diary, which must be returned to the site for review at each site visit.    Clinical Study Report

taken according the prescribed BID or TID schedule without interrup tion unless toxicity or 
intercurrent illness requires a modification to the dos ing regimen (see Section  6.8.2.5).  
For those subjects taking LAM -002A with intermittent administration, the drug should be 
taken in repeated 7 -day sequences comprising BID self -administration for 3 days (6 doses) 
followed by 4 days without dosing. If the c adence of the on -off periods is interrupted due to 
toxicity, intercurrent illness, or other reasons, the medical mon itor should be consulted 
regarding the timing of therapy resumption and dose m odification (see Section  6.8.2.5).  
6.8.2.4. LAM-002A Dose Schedule Interruptions and Vomited Doses  
No changes were made to this section. 
6.8.2.5. LAM-002A Dose Modifications 
The AEs associated with LAM -002A administration have included gastrointestinal 
toxicities of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, typically beginning s hortly after initiation of 
drug administration.  
If a subject experiences an AE that is suspected to be related to LAM-002A, appropriate 
supportive care (e.g., antiemetics, antidiarrheals, therapy for tumor lysis syndrome [TLS]) should 
be instituted consistent with the nature of the event.  
If a subject experiences an LAM-002A-related DLT (reference  Table 3) or other AE requiring a 
dose modification, then the LAM-002A administration should be interrupted until the toxicity 
recovers to Grade ≤  1 or baseline. Upon resumption of LAM-002A, the total daily dose of 
LAM-002A should be reduced using an appropriate dose level or schedule (refere nce Table 3) as 
agreed between th e investigator and medical monitor. Successive adjustments to progressi vely 
lower total daily dose levels can be made. If the subject cannot to lerate LAM-002A after a 
decrease to Dose Level -1 (25 mg BID), then the subject should be discontinued from 
LAM-002A therapy unless continued treatment is permitted by the medical moni tor.  
After the LAM-002A dose is reduced, the dose can be maintained at that dose level or schedule, 
even if there is minimal or no toxicity with the reduced dosing regimen. However, if the subject 
tolerates a reduced total daily dose of LAM-002A for ≥ 4 weeks then the LAM-002A dosing 
regimen may be reescalated to a higher total daily dose level at t he discretion of the investigator 
and with the concurrence of the medical monitor. Such r eescalation may be particularly 
warranted if the AE comprised TLS or if further evaluation reveal s that the AE that led to the 
dose reduction was not related to LAM-002A. Successive adjustments to progressively higher 
total daily dose levels can be made. H owever, the escalated dose cannot exceed the total daily 
starting dose level for that subject during the first 4 2 cycles of therapy.  
Individual subjects who initiated treatment at a total daily dose level at or below the lower of the 
currently establishe d MTD or the RP2D and who have not experienced a DLT after ≥  4 2 cycles 
of treatment may have the LAM-002A total daily dose escalated to the next higher dose level if 
both the principal investigator and the medical monitor agree that a dos e escalation is m edically 
warranted (e.g., for a subject with stable disease who is tolerat ing the current dose level of 
LAM-002A therapy). In such subjects, successive adjustments to progressively hi gher total daily 
dose levels can be made at intervals of ≥  4 weeks with the condition that the escalated total daily Clinical Study Report

or the lower of the currently established MTD or RP2D of LAM-002A when given 
intermittently .  
In a subject who experiences a D LT precluding resumption of LAM-002A therapy during a 
cycle, a new cycle of treatment may begin at the later of Day 29 or when AEs or laboratory 
abnormalities related to LAM-002A have returned to baseline levels. If drug -related AEs or 
laboratory abnormalities precluding further administration of study drug a re not resolved to 
baseline by Day  29, week-by-week delays in initiating the new cycle of treatment should be 
instituted. When all drug-related AEs and laboratory abnormalities have returned to baseline, the 
next cycle of therapy can be initiated. Upon initiation of a new cycle  of therapy, the prior cycle 
of therapy will be considered completed. 
Investigators are to discuss modifications in the dosing regimen wit h the medical monitor. The 
appropriate clinic staff should dispense the LAM-002A for the new dose level or schedule and 
instruct the subject/caregiver about the change in the dosing regimen. 
6.6.2.6. LAM-002A Supportive Care  
6.8.2.6.1. Antiemetics for Subjects Taking LAM -002A by Continuous Adminis tration 
For subjects taking LAM -002A via continuous administration, sites should consider 
providing study participants with antiemetics and antidiarrheals  so that these supportive 
care medications are readily available in case gastrointestinal s ymptoms related to 
LAM-002A develop.  
For subjects taking LAM -002A via continuous administration, it is recommended that, if 
prophylactic or therapeutic antiemetics are required, subjects be off ered 2 mg of the 
serotonin antagonist, granisetron (Kytril®, Granisol®), as an oral tabl et or solution every 6 
hours as needed. If subjects have persistent nausea or vomiting,  consideration can be given 
to a 10-mg subcutaneous injection of the extended release form of graniset ron (Sustol®). 
Alternatively, application of a 31.3 mg granisetron transdermal patch ( Sancuso®) every 3 
to 7 days can be offered. For transdermal prophylaxis, 24 to 48 hours may be  necessary to 
allow a sufficient period to achieve effective granisetron syst emic concentrations. Use of the 
serotonin antagonists, ondansetron (Zofran®, Zuplenz®) or dolasetron  (Anzemet®), is 
discouraged due to the possibility that such agents could prolong t he cardiac QT interval.  
The dopamine antagonist, olanzapine (Zyprexa®), at doses of 2.5 to 10 mg, m ay be 
considered alone o r in conjunction with serotonin antagonists or other types of an tiemetic 
agents. Olanzapine doses of 10 mg may be sedating, which could be helpful for certain 
subjects, but may represent a concern for others, particularly for t hose who are elderly.  
Based on currently available information regarding LAM-002A metabolism, the  
neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist, rolapitant (Varubi®), can be considered,  but aprepitant 
(Emend®) or netupitant+palonosetron (Akynzeo®) should be avoided bec ause these drugs 
may inhibit CYP3A4 and/ or CYP2C9 activity. 
Other classes of antiemetic medications that may be employed in clude dopamine 
antagonists or benzodiazepines if such drugs do not pose risks of QT prolongation or drug -
drug interactions. Given the possibility that LAM -002A may alter immunological Clinical Study Report

(particularly when coadministered with atezolizumab) to avoid i mmunocompromise; 
however, corticosteroids can be introduced if other types of antiemet ic agents are not 
sufficiently effective.  
6.8.2.6.2. Antiemetics for Subjects Taking LAM -002A by Intermittent Administration  
Because LAM -002A induces dose -dependent nausea and vomiting, subjects who are taking 
LAM-002A by intermittent administration are  required to receive antiemetic supportive 
care.  The following prophylaxis regimen should be started ≥30  minutes before initiation of 
each LAM-002A 3-day treatment sequence:  
• Dexamethasone 12 mg PO on Day 1 and then 8 mg PO on Day 2 and Day 3 
• Granisetron 2  mg PO on Day 1 and then 1 mg PO BID on Days 2 and 3 
• Olanzapine, 10 mg PO on Day 1 and then 10 mg PO on Days 2 and 3 
The study subject must be sent home from the clinic with suffic ient dexamethasone, 
granisetron, and olanzapine to ensure that the supportiv e care medications are readily 
available to the subject for each of the four 3 -day courses of LAM-002 A therapy during 
each 28-day cycle.   
Doses of dexamethasone and olanzapine may be adjusted to tolerance.  Other antiemetic 
drugs (eg, neurokinin 1 recepto r antagonists, dopamine antagonists, or benzodiazepines) 
may be considered in consultation with the medical monitor.  
6.8.2.6.3. Antidiarrheals  
For management of diarrhea related to LAM -002A, it is recommended that subjects take 
loperamide, 4 mg, at the occ urrence of the first loose stool and then 2 mg every 2 hours 
until they are diarrhea -free for at least 12 hours. More aggressive loperamide prophylactic  
or therapeutic administration and titration of loperamide dosin g for each loose bowel 
movement may be considered. During the night, subjects may take  4 mg of loperamide 
every 4 hours. Subjects should be advised to avoid dehydration throug h adequate fluid 
intake. Drugs such as 5HT3 antagonists or octreotide may be consid ered for their anti-
secretory effects.   For subjects who develop diarrhea while also receiving atezolizuma b, the 
possibility of atezolizumab- induced colitis should be considered (see Section  6.8.4.4). 
Section  6.8.3. Rituximab  
Change: Consistent with the plan to evaluate the combination of LAM-002A and rituximab in 
this study, instructions for administration, dose modifications, and supportive care 
relating to rituximab were added to the protocol. 
6.8.3.1. Premedications  
In accordance with rituximab prescribing information  (Genentech 2016 ), subjects should 
be premedicated with an antipyretic and an antihistamine to reduce  the incidence and 
severity of infusion reactions. A recommended regimen is diphenhy dramine, 25 mg orally, 
and acetaminophen (paracetamol), 650 mg orally, both given ~30 minutes pr ior to each Clinical Study Report

premedication. Local practices and guidelines may be followed.  
6.8.3.2. Rituximab Administration 
Based on past experience with this regimen ( Ghielmini 2004 , Martinelli 2010), rituximab 
will be administered intravenously in the clinic  for a total of 8 infusions: 
• Four induction infusions will be administered wee kly on Cycle 1 Day 1, 
Cycle 1 Day 8, Cycle 1 Day 15, and Cycle 1 Day 22.  
• Four subsequent maintenance infusions will be administered every 8 weeks on 
Cycle 4 Day 1, Cycle 6 Day 1, Cycle 8 Day 1, and Cycle 10 Day 1.  
The dose for each infusion will be 375 mg/m2 of body surface area. The dose calculation of 
body surface area will be based on the subject’s height and actual  body weight prior to 
therapy. Once established based on the pretreatment body weight, t he total dose of 
rituximab for the subject should not be altered during therapy based on fluctuations in 
body weight unless required by institutional policy . 
At Cycle 1 Day 1, ~30 minutes after administration of the require d antipyretic and 
antihistamine premedications and ~15 to 30 minutes after adminis tration of the first dose 
of LAM-002A, the first infusion of rituximab will be administered via  an infusion pump. 
For the initial infusion, the recommended infusion rate is 50  mg/hour. In the absence of 
infusion toxicity, the infusion rate can be increased i n 50-mg/hour increments every 
30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hour. 
For subsequent infusions, the required antipyretic and antihistamine pr emedications will 
be given and the rituximab will be infused via an infusion pump. For  these infusions, the 
infusion can be initiated at 100 mg/hour. In the absence of infusion toxicity, the infusion 
rate can be increased in 100 -mg/hour increments every 30  minutes, to a maximum of 
400 mg/hour. Alternatively, for subjects who tolerate the first infusion wi th Grade ≤3 
infusion toxicity, subsequent infusions can be administered over a planned infusion time of 
90 minutes, with ~20% of the total dose administered in the fir st 30 minutes and the 
remaining 80% of the total protein dose administered in the s ubsequent 60 m inutes 
(Dakhil 2014, Genentech 2016 ).  
6.8.3.3. Management of Rituximab Infusion Toxicity 
Rituximab can cause severe, including fatal, infusion reactions (Genentech 2016 ). Patients 
with pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions, those who experienced p rior 
cardiopulmonary adverse reactions to rituximab, and those with hi gh numbers of 
circulating malignant cells ( ≥25 x 109/L) may be at particular risk. Sever e reactions 
typically occur during the first infusion and are generally les s frequent and less severe with 
subsequent infusions. The time to onset of infusion toxicit y ranges from 30 to 120 minutes. 
Rituximab-induced infusion reactions and sequelae include  urticaria, hypotension, 
angioedema, hypoxia, bronchospasm, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respi ratory distress 
syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, cardiogeni c shock, and/or 
anaphylactoid events. Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Conf idential and Proprietary Page 236 of 312 Rituximab infusions should be interrupt ed or slowed in subjects experiencing Grade ≥3 
rituximab-related infusion reactions. Medical management (eg, oxygen, epinep hrine, 
bronchodilators, and/or glucocorticoids) should be instituted, a s needed. Upon 
improvement of symptoms, the infusion may be continued at 50% of the previous rate. At 
the discretion of the investigator, rituximab therapy may be permanently discontinued in 
subjects with Grade  4 infusion reactions or with reactions requiring substantial 
intervention. 
6.8.3.4. Rituximab Dose Modifica tions and Supportive Care  
Rituximab-related noninfectious pneumonitis has been described ( Subramanian 2010 ) with 
an incidence of ~4.3% (Salmasi 2010 ). In patients developing rituximab -associated 
pneumonitis, the mean time from the first rituximab infusion to  the onset of respiratory 
symptoms was 3  months, with a peak incidence after administration of a mean c umulative 
dosage of 1600 mg/m2 (Lioté 2010 ). 
Severe, including fatal, mucocutaneous reactions can occur in patients re ceiving rituximab 
during infusion or at later timepoints. Non- infusion related events have included 
paraneoplastic pemphigus, Stevens Johnson syndrome, lichenoid dermat itis, 
vesiculobullous d ermatitis, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (Genentech 2016 ). The onset of 
these reactions has varied from 1 to 13 weeks following initiati on of rituximab exposure. 
Among patients receiving rituximab in combination with chem otherapy, rare instances of 
life-threatening bowel obstruction or perforation has been observed [Ra m 2009], primarily 
in patients with NHL. In post -marketing reports, the mean time to documented 
gastrointestinal perforation was 6 (range 1–77) days from start of che moimmunotherapy.  
Fulminate and fatal HBV infection and reactivation can occur during or after treatment 
with rituximab (Genentech 2016 ). The risk is very low among patients with negative anti-
HBc serology (Matsue 2010) and/or undetectable HBV DNA as assessed by quantitative 
PCR. Because subjects with such evidence of persistent HBV infect ion are excluded from 
this study, reactivation is not anticipated. Other serious bact erial, fungal, and new or 
reactivated viral infections have also occurred during and for ~1 year following rituximab-
based therapy ( Gea-Banacloche 2010 ). Other new or reactivated viral infections in patients 
receiving rituximab hav e included CMV, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus  B19, varicella 
zoster virus, West Nile virus, and HCV.  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML) due to polyomavirus JC has been observed in patients who have received rituximab 
therapy for hematologi c malignancies  (Carson 2009).  
No dose reductions of rituximab are recommended. If a subject experi ences an AE that is 
suspected to be related to rituximab and is of sufficient severity to warrant modification of 
therapy, administration of the drug should be interrupted or discontinued. Prot ocol-
recommended management of selected adverse events and appropriate sup portive care is 
described in Table 5. Clinical Study Report

Version 9, 18 Feb 2020 
AI Therapeutics Conf idential and Proprietary Page 238 of 312 6.8.4.2. Atezolizumab Administration  
Atezolizumab will be administered intravenously in the clinic ev ery 3 weeks.  The dose for 
each infusion will be 1200 mg. 
Using an infusion pump, atezolizumab should be administered throug h an intravenous line 
with or without a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low- protein binding in -line filter (pore size of 0.2 
to 0.22 μm). Other drugs shoul d not be coadministered with atezolizumab through the 
same intravenous line.  
At Cycle 1 Day 1, ~15 to 30 minutes after administration of the firs t dose of LAM-002A , the 
first infusion of atezolizumab will be administered over 60  minutes. If the first infusion is 
tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be delivered over 30 m inutes. Atezolizumab should 
not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus.  
6.8.4.3. Management of Atezolizumab Infusion Toxicity 
While infrequent (incident <2%), severe infusion reactions have occurred in clinical trial 
subjects receiving atezolizumab. For subjects with Grade 1 or 2 i nfusion reactions, the 
atezolizumab infusion should be int errupted or slowed. For subjects with Grade ≥3 
infusion reactions, atezolizumab therapy should be permanently dis continued. 
6.8.4.4. Atezolizumab Dose Modifications and Supportive Care  
In clinical trials supporting its approval as therapy for patien ts with previously treated 
advanced non- small cell lung cancer and metastatic bladder cancer (Weinstock  2017, 
Ning 2017), atezolizumab administration has been associated with immun e-related AEs of 
pneumonitis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies ( hypophysitis, thyroiditis, 
adrenal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus), and neurological to xicity (meningitis/encephalitis, 
motor/sensory neuropathies, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, Gu illain-Barré 
syndrome). Immune-related AEs can be observed within days to months after starti ng 
atezolizumab therapy (Genentech  2017). 
Severe infections, including pneumonias, urinary tract infectio ns, sepsis, herpes 
encephalitis, and mycobacterial infection have occurred.  
Systemic immune activation is a rare condition characterized by a n excessive immune 
response.  Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab, system ic immune activation is 
considered a potential risk when atezolizumab is given in combina tion with other 
immunomodulating agents.  Systemic immune activation should be included in the 
differential diagnosis for study subjects who, in the absenc e of an alternative etiology, 
develop a sepsis -like syndrome after adm inistration of atezolizumab.  The initial evaluation 
should include:  
• CBC with peripheral smear  
• PT, PTT, fibrinogen, and D- dimer 
• Ferritin 
• Triglycerides 
• AST, ALT, and total bilirubin Clinical Study Report

Reference should be made to Section 6 of the atezolizumab investi gator brochure for a 
detailed description of antic ipated safety risks for atezolizumab. 
No dose reductions of atezolizumab are recommended. If a subject ex periences an AE that 
is suspected to be related to atezolizumab  and is of sufficient severity to warrant 
modification of therapy, administration of the drug should be interrupted or discontinued.

Section  6.9 Other Supportive Care Recommendations  
Change: General supportive care recommendations were updated and consolidated in this 
section of the protocol. 
6.9 Other Supportive Care Recommendations  
Consistent with subject safety and comfort, administration of any prescription or over- the-
counter drug products other than study medication will be minimized during the study 
period. Subjects should be discouraged fro m use of herbal remedies, self -prescribed drugs, 
tobacco products, or street drugs during their participation in t he clinical study and should 
be counseled to minimize use of alcohol or nonmedical marijuana . 
If considered necessary for the subject’s well -being, drugs for concomitant medical 
conditions or for symptom management may be given at the discret ion of the investigator. 
The investigator’s decision to authorize the use of any drug o ther than study drug will take 
into account subject safety, the medic al need, the potential for drug interactions, the 
possibility for masking symptoms of a more significant underl ying event, and whether use 
of the drug will compromise the outcome or integrity of the stu dy. 
Subjects will be instructed about the importance o f the need to inform the clinic staff of the 
use of any drugs or remedies (whether prescribed, over -the-counter, or illicit) before and 
during the study.  
Recommendations regarding specific types of concomitant therapies , supportive care, diet, 
and other interventions are provided below. To minimize variations in sup portive care, the 
recommended supportive care agents (eg, loperamide, granisetron) sh ould be used unless 
there is a medical rationale in a specific subject for use of an alternative product.  
6.9.1. Antibiotics, Antifungals, and Antivirals 
Care should be taken to avoid or minimize concomitant administr ation of prophylactic or 
therapeutic antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral, agents that are moderate or strong 
CYP3A4 or CY2C9 inhibitors or induc ers (see Section  6.96 and Appendix  3).  
For subjects with a history of recurrent infections, prophylax is with intravenous 
gammglobulin may be offered and consideration may be given to init iation of antibiotic 
prophylaxis against pneumocystis infection (eg, with trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole, 
dapsone, aerosolized pentamidine, or atovaquone) beginning prior to study drug 
administration. Such support also offers the benefit of redu cing the risk for other bacterial 
infections (Stern  2014). Local practices or guidelines regarding infection prophylaxi s may 
be followed.  Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Conf idential and Proprietary Page 242 of 312 Subjects developing an intercurrent infection during study drug treatment may receive 
therapeutic antibacterial, antiviral, or antifungal drugs fo r intercurrent infect ions as 
needed. Continuation of study therapy during treatment for an interc urrent infection is at 
the discretion of the investigator but guidance in Section  6.8.3.4 and Section 6.8.4.4 should 
be considered in subjects receiving combination therapy.  
6.9.2. Anticancer Therapies Other than the Study Drugs  
No systemic anticancer therapies (including chemotherapy, anti body therapy, hormonal 
therapy, immunotherapy, or other experimental therapies) for the su bject’s cancer are 
permitted while the subject is recei ving study treatment. Subjects are not allowed to 
participate concurrently in any other therapeutic clinical or imagi ng study. 
The use of palliative radiotherapy should be minimized given the potential of such 
treatment to confuse assessments of study drug  safety or therapeutic effect. However, 
administration of limited -fraction radiotherapy is permitted to control local tumor -related 
symptoms if irradiation is unlikely to induce major organ toxici ty or affect target lesions 
being followed for tumor response and progression.  
If required to maintain disease control, study drugs may be cont inued with caution during 
radiotherapy administration. 
6.9.3. Anticoagulants 
Use of local anticoagulation or antithrombotic agents to maintain a ven ous access catheter 
is permitted. While not prohibited, use of systemic anticoagulants ( eg, unfractionated 
heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, fractionated heparin, warfarin or other oral 
anticoagulants, aspirin) after a subject is on study should be av oided unless necessary fo r 
development of a serious intercurrent thrombotic or embolic conditi on. Subjects who 
develop conditions that require anticoagulant therapy are permitt ed to receive such drugs 
and are not required to discontinue study participation if they appea r to be safely 
benefiting from study therapy. Subjects should be closely monitor ed for bleeding events 
when on systemic anticoagulant therapy. 
6.9.4. Antihistamine, Antiinflammatory, or Antipyretic, Drugs 
Antihistamines (eg, cetirizine, diphenhydramine), and antiinfl ammatory/antipyretic drugs 
(eg, acetaminophen [paracetamol], nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory dr ugs [NSAIDs]), may 
be used during the study, as medically warranted. The potentia l for adverse hepatic effects 
with acetaminophen and platelet inhibitory effects with NSAIDs should be considered in 
the selection of the appropriate drug for the clinical situation . 
6.9.5. Corticosteroids  
At study entry, subjects may not be using systemic or enteric co rticosteroids but may be 
receiving inhaled or topical corticosteroi ds. During study therapy, subjects may use 
systemic, enteric, topical or enteric corticosteroids as required by p rotocol or for 
treatment-emergent conditions. Use of systemic or enteric corticosteroids as 
premedications or for other reasons should be minimized but can b e considered after 
consultation with the medical monitor.  Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Conf idential and Proprietary Page 243 of 312 6.9.6. Drugs with Potential for Drug -Drug Interactions with LAM -002A 
No information is available regarding interactions of LAM-002 A with therapeutic agents 
or other substances in huma ns. In vitro data suggest that concomitant administration of 
potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 might alter LAM-002A clearance and 
lead to clinically significant increases or decreases in LAM -002A exposure. Consequently, 
the concomitant use of strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 (see Tabl e 14) 
should be avoided when possible.  
Based on these considerations, protocol candidates who require th erapy with strong 
CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers listed in Table 14 should not be enrolled into 
the study.  
During study participation, coadministration of LAM-002 A with CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 
inhibitors or inducers (see  Table 14) should be avoided, if possible. However, a subject wh o 
develops a condition that may require use of such drugs is not r equired to permanently 
discontinue LAM -002A if the subject is experiencing clinical benefit and other opti ons for 
treating the subject’s cancer are limited. If medically appropria te, investigators may wish 
to use a therapeutic alternative that woul d not be expected to affect these enzymes. For 
subjects who require temporary use of a drug that does affect t hese enzymes (e.g., 
treatment with a systemic antifungal agent), LAM -002A can be interrupted (or the doses 
reduced) during use of the other medica tion and then resumed after completion of the 
other drug. For subjects who require initiation of chronic thera py with a drug that potently 
affects these enzymes, investigators must consult with the med ical monitor to consider the 
best course of action.  
6.9.7. Drugs Known to Prolong the QT Interval 
In a thorough QTc study, apilimod dimesylate at doses of 50 mg and 1 50 mg was associated 
with repolarization findings in excess of those deemed negati ve by regulatory guidance. 
The magnitude of the change was modest (~8.5 msec), peaked at 4 hou rs and did not 
demonstrate a dose trend. Preliminary QTc observations in the ongoing study in patients 
with hematological malignancies suggest the potential for dose- and exposure dependent 
Grade 1 or 2 QT prolongation. 
As a precaution, the clinical potential of LAM -002A to prolong the QT interval will be 
assessed in this study. Accordingly, co-administration of LAM-002 A and known QT -
prolonging drugs is to be minimized because use of such drugs mig ht confound 
interpretation o f QT data from the trial.  
Based on these considerations, protocol candidates who require therapy with drugs known 
to prolong the QT interval (as listed in Table 15) should not be enrolled into the study. If 
medically justified, protocol candidates may be enrolled if such drugs can be discontinued 
or alternative drugs that do not affect QT can be substituted > 7 days before the first dose 
of study drug.  
After the subject is enrolled to the protocol, use of drugs kno wn to prolong the QT interval 
should be minimized but is not prohibited if administration of such drug is necessary and 
the subject appears to be benefiting from protocol therapy.  Clinical Study Report

Granulocyte colony- stimulating factor (G -CSF) (eg, filgrastim, filgrastim snd, 
pegfilgrast im, lenograstim) may be administered in response to Grade ≥3 neutropenia or  
neutropenic complications.  
Granulocyte-macrophage colony- stimulating factor (GM -CSF) should not be administered 
given the potential for GM- CSF-related inflammatory symptoms.  
Use of erythropoietic agents (eg, erythropoietin or darbepoetin) is not recommended.  
Red blood cell or platelet transfusions may be administered as  medically indicated.  
6.9.9. Immunization  
There is no information regarding the effects of LAM -002A or atezolizuma b on the safety 
or response to immunization against infectious pathogens.  
In randomized clinical trials, rituximab has been shown to reduce  the antibody response to 
pneumococcal vaccination (a T- cell-independent antigen) or to anti -keyhole limpet 
hemocyanin antibodies (a novel protein antigen) (Genentech 2016 ). Response to tetanus 
toxoid vaccine (a T ‑cell-dependent antigen with existing immunity) or maintenance of a 
positive Candida skin test (as a measure of T- cell-mediated delayed -type hypersensitivity) 
was not altered. The specific clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.  
For subjects who are at substantial risk of an infection (eg,  influenza) that might be 
prevented by immunization, consideration should be give n to providing the vaccine prior to 
initiation of study therapy. Vaccination with live virus vacc ines during study treatment is 
not recommended.  
6.9.10. Procedures/Surgery  
The extent to which LAM -002A or other study drugs may affect wound healing or the ri sk 
of would infection is unknown. Investigators may use clinical discretion in deciding 
whether to interrupt protocol therapy before and after surgery or ot her invasive 
procedures.  
6.9.11. Skeletal Event Prophylaxis 
Bisphosphonates or denosumab are permit ted if a subject was receiving such therapy at the 
time of screening and will continue on a stable regimen thr oughout protocol therapy. The 
need to start such drugs while on therapy may be an indication of  disease progression and 
should be discussed with the sponsor prior to implementation.  
 
Section  6.10. Study Restrictions  
Change: A study restrictions section was added to provide guidance to the investigator. 
6.10.1. Breast Feeding  
There is no information regarding the presence of LAM -002A or its metabolit es in animal 
or human breast milk and the effects of the drug on the breastfe d infant or on milk 
production are unknown.  Clinical Study Report

Version 9, 18 Feb 2020 
AI Therapeutics Conf idential and Proprietary Page 245 of 312 Rituximab is secreted in the milk of lactating cynomolgus mo nkeys, but it is not specifically 
known whether rituximab is secreted into human milk (Genentech 2016 ). There is similarly 
no information regarding the presence of atezolizumab in human m ilk (Genentech 2017 ). 
However, because human IgG is excreted in human milk, there is a hypothetical potential 
for absorption and harm to an infant from administration of these  types of therapeutic 
antibodies.  
For these reasons, women who are nursing are not eligible to par ticipate in this study. 
Lactating women who do participate in this clinical trial must discontinue nursing during 
protocol therapy and should avoid nursing for ≥2 months after LAM -002A and for ≥5 
months after the last dose of rituximab or atezolizumab.  
6.10.2. Contraception  
Animal studies have been conducted to assess the effects of apilimod on fertility and 
organogenesis. In studies conducted to date, apilimod or apilimod  dimesylate did not affect 
fertility or cause reproductive harm. One patient receiving the drug for Crohn disease 
conceived during therapy; a n ormal pregnancy was carried to term and a healthy infant 
was born. However, no other experience is available with the drug in pregnant patients.  
Reproduction studies of rituximab in cynomolgus monkeys at mater nal exposures similar 
to human therapeutic exp osures have shown no teratogenic effects (Genentech 2016 ). 
However, B-cell lymphoid tissue was reduced in the offspring of these anim als; B-cell 
counts returned to normal levels and immunologic function was r estored within  6 months 
of birth. In humans, B -cell lymphocytopenia generally lasting <6 months can occur 
postnatally in infants exposed to rituximab in utero. 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atezolizum ab to evaluate its 
effect on reproduction and fetal development. A literature -based assessment of the effects 
on reproduction demonstrated that a central function of the PD -L1/PD-1 pathway is to 
preserve pregnancy by maintaining maternal immune tolerance to a fetus (Genentech 
2017). Blockage of PD- L1 signaling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to 
disrupt tolerance to a fetus and to result in an increase in f etal loss; therefore, potential 
risks of administering atezolizumab during pregnancy include in creased rates of abortion 
or stillbirth. As reported in the literature, there were no malfo rmations related to the 
blockade of PD- L1/PD-1 signaling in the offspring of these animals; however, immun e-
mediated disorders occurred in PD -L1 and PD-1 knockout mice. Based on its mechanism of 
action, fetal exposure to atezolizumab may increase the risk of d eveloping immune -
mediated disorders or altering the normal immune response.  
Accordingly, sexually active females of childbearing potential mus t agree to use a protocol-
recommended method of contraception during heterosexual intercourse from the start of 
the screening period until ≥5 months days after the final dose of study th erapy.  
In the context of this protocol, a female subject is considered  to be of childbearing  potential 
unless she has had a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or b ilateral oophorectomy; has 
medically documented ovarian failure (with serum follicle stimu lating hormone (FSH) level 
> 35 mIU/mL and a negative serum or urine beta βHCG); or is men opausal (amenorrhea 
for ≥12 months).  Clinical Study Report

6.10.3. Diet 
Because LAM -002A is a substrate of CYP3A4, subjects should be advised to avo id 
ingestion of grapefruit, grapefruit juice, or Seville oranges (wh ich contains a potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitor) and should not use St. John’s wort, which is a  potent CYP3A4 inducer. 
No other specific dietary restrictions are required.  
 
Section  6.11. Duration of Subject Participation  
Change: Information regarding the duration of subject participation was updated to include 
instructions for administration of both LAM-002A monotherapy and 
LAM -002A-based combination therapy. Consistent with intention- to-treat principles 
designed to maximize collection of safety and efficacy data, it was noted that subjects 
could continue on either of the combination agents even if the other agent were to be 
discontinued due to toxicity. 
All subjects will be treated for at least 1 cycle unless there is e vidence of unacceptable toxicity or 
PD. Although subjects may continue to receive study treatment until  expe riencing unacceptable 
toxicity or disease progression, it is estimated that each subject will participate  for an average of 
6 months of treatment and an additional 1 month of followup.  
Subjects may continue receiving  LAM-0002A until the occurrence of any events requiring 
treatment disco ntinuation as defined in Section  6.8.2.5 and Section 6.12. Clinical Study Report

continue with protocol -specified therapy for the therapeutic agent (LAM -002A, rituximab, or 
atezolizumab) that continues to be tolerated, even if the other agent need to be di scontinued 
due to drug -specific toxicity.  
Subjects who have discontinued study treatment for reasons other than PD will be assessed per 
Revised Response Criteria for NHL or Guidelines for the diagnosis a nd treatment of CLL at a 
minimum of every 12 weeks until documentation of PD, start of new anti- cancer therapy or for 
up to 1 year from the last enrolled subject’s first treatment (C ycle 1 Day 1), whichever comes 
first. Long-term follow-up survival information will be obtained in all surviving subjects who 
permanently discontinue study therapy. Such information may be collected at ~ 3- to 6-month 
intervals at the sponsor’s discretion through 3 years. This long- term follow-up information will 
be gathered during routine clinic visits, other study site contact with the subjects, or via 
telephone or e-mail with the subjects/caregivers or referring physic ian offices. 
 
Section  6.12. Criteria for Subject Withdrawal from Study Treatment or Study Participati on 
Study Termination  
Change: This section of the protocol was modified to focus on potential reasons for subject 
withdrawal from study treatment or study participation.  A later section dealing with 
potential study termination was updated. 
The sponsor may terminate this study at any time, provided a written noti ce is submitted a t a 
reasonable time in advance of the intended termination.  
Subjects may be withdrawn from further study treatment for any of the  following reasons: 
• Subject withdrawal of informed consent 
• Disease progression of cancer while receiving study therapy Note: Apparent worsening 
of disease during temporary interruption of study therapy (e.g., for drug -related toxicity 
or intercurrent illness) may not indicate true cancer progression. Stu dy subjects 
undergoing PET for lymphoma assessment can experience transient di sease flare on 
imaging before having subsequent therapy -induced tumor regression. Worsening of 
constitutional symptoms or performance status in the absence of objective e vidence of 
worsening lymphoma (e.g., due to infection) may not represent definitive di sease 
progression. For these reasons, if there is uncertainty regarding whether t here is true 
disease progression and if medically appropriate, the subject may continue or resum e 
study treatment and remain under close observation (e.g., evaluated at 4 - to 8- week 
intervals) while relevant radiographic, clinical, and/or laboratory assessme nts are 
performed to document whether tumor control can be maintained or whether diseas e Clinical Study Report

• Unacceptable study -drug-related toxicity despite appropriate dose modification 
• Development of intercurrent illness that precludes continued study therapy  
• Physician decision that continuation is not in the subject’s best intere st 
• Treatment of the cancer with another therapeutic regimen  
• Subject becomes pregnant or begins breastfeeding 
• Substantial noncompliance with study drug administration, study procedures, or study 
requirements in circumstances that increase risk or substantially c ompromise the 
interpretation of study results 
• Termination of the study by the sponsor, relevant regulatory agencies, or the IRB/IEC  
The investigator must determine the primary reason for a subject’s  withdrawal from the study 
and record this information on the electronic case report form (eCR F). 
Unless they withdraw consent for further follow -up, subjects who discontinue  study 
therapy will continue on study for acquisition of safety information through  ≥30 days after 
the last dose of study treatment, and for further collection o f long-term information 
regarding survival. 
 
Section  6.13. Replacement of Subjects  
Change: Because S tage 1 focuses on DLT evaluability and Stage 2 focuses on efficacy 
evaluability, the information in this section was updated and cross- referenced to 
relevant sections of the protocol. 
6.13. Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects not meeting the criteria for eval uability defined in Section  6.1.3 may be replaced 
at the discretion of the sponsor.  Subjects who are withdrawn from study treatment prior to 
completing Cycle 1 dosing for reasons other than DLT will be replaced s o that a full cohort of 
subjects completes Cycle 1 safety evaluations.  If a subject needs to be replaced, the site will 
notify the Sponsor for the need of a replacement; the associated subject ID will not be used. 
 
Section  7. SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL  OF SUBJECTS  
Changes: The description of withdrawa l of subjects was moved to Section  6.12.  Subject 
selection criteria were updated as follows: 
• On mechanistic grounds, PMBL may respond to LAM-002A therapy; for this reason, 
patients with this type of lymphoma were permitted to be accrued to the dose-ranging 
portion of the trial. Clinical Study Report

• Organ function criteria for hematological function, hepatic function, and renal 
function were  updated based on the evolving safety p rofile of LAM -002A  showing 
that the drug is unlikely to adversely alter these organ systems. 
• The contraception enrollment criteria were  made more s pecific , referencing protocol-

Tomography (PET)/Computerized Tomography Scans (CT scan) for patients  with lymphoma, 
bone marrow aspirate/biopsy, complete blood counts and physical examination. I t is anticipated 
that in most cases the PET/CT scans will be conducted using a si ngle instrument, i.e., as a 
PET/CT scan (CT scans should be performed using a contiguous reconstruction al gorithm of 
≤ 5 mm). However, MRI is an acceptable alternative method for assessi ng disease in subjects 
who cannot receive intravenous contrast with CT scans. In such subjects MRI and PET scans 
will have to be obtained separately. 
Suitable scans performed prior to screening and within 30 days before first dose  may be used for 
baseline tumor assessments. Similarly bone marrow biopsies/aspirate s performed within 
2 months prior to first dose may be used for baseline assessments. Fo r subjects with NHL, 
baseline bone marrow biopsies/aspirates may be omitted if not deeme d essential for response 
assessment or patient management and there is another source of tumor tissue for 
pretreatment evaluation of gene expression and prognosis.  For subjects with  CLL/SLL, a 
baseline bone marrow aspirate is required unless the presence of s ufficient circulating cells in the 
peripheral blood (e.g., ALC ≥  10 x 109/L) permits assessment of baseline parameters for gene 
expression and prognosis. Details of assessments will be collected on the eCRF and must be filed 
in the subject’s medical record.  
Archival tissue from the most recent available biopsy or surgery or fresh tumor tissue 
(preferred) must be obtained pretreatment  for nucleic acid extraction . For subjects undergoing 
a biopsy, adequate tumor tissue should be acquired via excisional biopsy, incisi onal biopsy or 
core needle biopsy (e.g., ≥  3 passes using a 16- gauge core needle). Alternatively, cells from a 
bone marrow aspirate may be obtained in subjects with bone marrow involve ment due to NHL 
(≥50% of cells) . Tissue will be submitted for evaluation of the percentage of tumor c ells and 
analysis of genetic alterations and/or gene expression that may predic t anti-lymphoma activity 
and/or pharmacodynamics activity.  
In addition, tumor tissue from the mo st recently availably biopsy or surgery will may be 
evaluated for known prognostic characteristics (e.g., for DLBCL: AB C or GCB subtype; 
expression of BCL2, BCL6, Ki-67, CD20, and MYC; other mutational status) , for PDL1 status, Clinical Study Report

8.2.4. Electrocardiogram  
A 12-lead ECG with subject resting for 5 minutes will be done at Scre ening. Additional ECGs 
will be conducted Table 8: Schedule of Assessments (LAM -002A Continuous Monotherapy 
Administration), Table 9: Schedule of Assessments (LAM -002A Intermittent Monotherapy 
Administration), Table 10: Schedule of Assessments (LAM -002A/Rituximab Combination 
Therapy), and Table 11: Schedule of Assessments (LAM -002A/Atezolizumab Combination 
Therapy) in Section 8.7 prior to the start of each cycle, prior to each PK time point (exc ept for 
30 minutes and 6 hours) on Day 1 and Day 8, at the End of Treatment, and more often if 
clinically indicated. Parameters measured will include heart rate, P R, QRS, QT, and QTc 
intervals (calculated by the Fridericia correction formula. Bazett’s  correction is acceptable if 
institutional policy). See Section 12 for PK time points. The ECGs will be reviewed and signed 
by the investigator.  
8.3.1.1 Hematology 
Hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC count with differential, red blood cell (RB C) count, and platelet 
count will be collected at Screening and Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1 and 2 then at least once 
prior to start of all subsequent cycles and at EOTaccording to the relevant schedule of events; 
see Table 8: Schedule of Assessments (LAM -002A Continuous Monotherapy 
Administration), Table 9: Schedule of Assessments (LAM -002A Intermittent Monotherapy 
Administration), Table 10: Schedule of Assessments (LAM -002A/Rituximab Combination

Albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin, calcium, carbon dioxi de, chloride, 
creatinine, glucose,  inorganic phosphorus, potassium, total protein, ALT, AST, lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), sodium, BUN, and uric acid will be collected according to the relevant 
schedule of events; see Table 8: Schedule of Assessments (LAM -002A Continuous 
Monotherapy Adminis tration), Table 9: Schedule of Assessments (LAM -002A Intermittent 
Monotherapy Administration), Table 10: Schedule of Assessments (LAM -002A/Rituximab

Version 9, 18 Feb 2020 
AI Therapeutics Conf idential and Proprietary Page 256 of 312 8.6.1. Antineoplastic Medications/Therapy  
Antineoplastic Therapy: Other chemotherapy, investigational agents or bio logic therapy will not 
be permitted during the study. 
Palliative radiotherapy for local peripheral metastases not being u sed as target lesions is allowed. 
However, the need for such therapy may be an indication of disease pr ogression and should be 
discussed with the Sponsor prior to implementation. Radiotherapy for centra l metastases (e.g., 
vertebral, mediastinal) will not b e allowed; the need for such radiotherapy while on therapy will 
be seen as an indication of disease progression and the subject should be  withdrawn from 
therapy. 
8.6.2. Growth Factors  
Hematopoietic Growth Factors: Subjects receiving hematopoietic growth  factors such as 
erythropoietin prior to study start may continue to receive pretreatm ent doses.  
The use of erythropoietic and granulocyte growth factors in accordance w ith American Society 
of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines may be implemented during s tudy treatment at the 
discretion of the treating physician. 
8.6.3. Other Concomitant Medications  
Bisphosphonates: Bisphosphonates are permitted if a subject was rece iving ongoing 
bisphosphonate therapy at time of screening and will continue on a stable r egimen throughout 
protocol therapy. The need to start bisphosphonates while on therapy may be an indication of 
disease progression and should be discussed with the Sponsor prior to impleme ntation. 
Anticoagulants: Apilimod is highly protein bound; therefore, the Investigator is cautioned about 
the use of therapeutic doses of sodium warfarin. 
Corticosteroids: Subjects may be using topical, intra articular, nasal, or inhaled corticosteroids at 
study entry and may use such drugs during therapy. The use of system ic or enteric 
corticosteroids is precluded at study entry because such drugs may confound i nterpretation of 
pharmacodynamic, immunological, or toxic responses in subjects on this stu dy. However, such 
drugs are permitted if a subject develops intercurrent conditions that  require corticosteroid 
therapy. 
Medications for the treatment of AEs or cancer symptoms, e.g., packed red blood cells and pain 
medications, are allowed. Measures to prevent potential tumor lysis syndrome are allowed per 
institutional guideli nes. Additionally, medications (not addressed above) used to treat underlying 
medical conditions at study entry (including anti emetics and anti diarrheals) will be allowed to 
continue.  
Vaccines: Administration of live vaccines is prohibited during the s tudy.  
8.7. Drug Interactions  
Drug Interactions: No information is available regarding interactions  of LAM002A (apilimod 
dimesylate capsules) with therapeutic agents or other substances in humans. In vitro data suggest 
that concomitant administration of po tent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 might 
alter apilimod dimesylate clearance and lead to clinically significant increases or decreases in Clinical Study Report

Version 9, 18 Feb 2020 
AI Therapeutics Conf idential and Proprietary Page 257 of 312 apilimod dimesylate exposure. Consequently, the concomitant use of strong inhibi tors or 
inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 (see Table 7) should be avoided when possible .  
Based on these considerations, protocol candidates who require therapy wit h strong CYP3A4 or 
CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers listed in Table 7 should not be enrolled into t he study.  
During study pa rticipation, coadministration of apilimod dimesylate with CYP3A4 or CYP2 C9 
inhibitors or inducers (see Table 7) should be avoided, if possible. However , a subject who 
develops a condition that may require use of such drugs is not required to pe rmanently 
discontinue apilimod dimesylate if the subject is experiencing clinica l benefit and other options 
for treating the subject’s cancer are limited. If medically appr opriate, investigators may wish to 
use a therapeutic alternative that would not be expected to a ffect these enzymes. For subjects 
who require temporary use of a drug that does affect these enzymes (e.g., treatment with a 
systemic antifungal agent), apilimod dimesylate can be interrupted (or  the doses reduced) during 
use of the other medication and then resumed after completion of the othe r drug. For subjects 
who require initiation of chronic therapy with a drug that potently affect s these enzymes, 
investigators must consult with the medical monitor to consider the bes t course of action.  
Medications that prolong QT C and/or cause Torsades de pointes should be avoided (See Table 8).  
See Appendix 3 for additional information.  
8.6. Treatment Compliance  
Change: The minimum requirement for DLT evaluability was included for subjects taking 
LAM -002A on the i ntermittent schedule.  
The investigator will dispense the study medication only for use by subject s enrolled in the study 
as described in this protocol. The study medication is not to be used for  reasons other than those 
described in this protocol. 
The investigator or other study staff will supervise LAM-002 A treatment given at the site and 
instruct the subject on study medication self- administration. Subjects will be asked to bring their 
dosing diary with them at each visit. Compliance with protocol- defined LAM-002A intake will 
be checked by pill count at the end of each cycle and compliance decisions will be made by the 
investigator. 
A subject is considered to be DLT-evaluable if he/she has taken a t least 75% (42/56 BID 
schedule; 63/84 TID schedule , 18/24 intermittent schedule ) of the planned first cycle doses and 
has sufficient safety data, or has experienced a DLT in the fir st cycle. 
 
Section 8.7 Schedules of Assessments  
Change: Previous schedule of assessments (Table 6, previously in Section 6 ) was delete d and 
separate tables were included that were specific for LAM -002A continuous monotherapy, 
LAM -002A intermittent monotherapy, LAM-002 A/rituxim ab combination therapy, and

AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprietary Page 260 of 312 I Pregnancy testing (serum or urine) will be required for women of chi ldbearing potential (WCBP) only. Testing is required at Sc reening; within 72 hours of 
Day 1 of each Cycle and at EOT. Test does not need to be repeated on C1D 1 if baseline was negative and conducted within 72 hours of first dose.  
J Imaging as appropriate for disease indication will be conducted wit hin 30 days of the first dose of study treatment. Suitable  scans performed prior to screening 
and within 30 days before first dose may be used for  baseline tumor assessments.  
K Assessment of disease status will be conducted with standard clini cal measurements: PE, CBCs, bone marrow aspirates/biopsies,  and imaging as appropriate 
for indication. During treatment, scans will be repeated for tumor  assessment within 7 days of Day 1, Cycles 3, 5, and 7 then every 3 m onths until PD or use of 
alternative antineoplastic therapy. For subjects still in respon se after 1 year, intervals for radiographic surveillance may be every 6 months. Subjects with CLL 
who achieve CR will require assessment of MRD by flow cytometry of bone marrow and peripheral blood.  
L Imaging at EOT is not required if PD has already been radiographica lly documented or last imaging was within 30 days of EOT v isit. 
M Subjects with CLL/SLL must  provide either a fresh blood sample containing circulating tumor cells or a bone marrow aspirate sample pretreatment. Tissue 
will be submitted for evaluation of the percentage of tumor cells and analysis of genetic alterations and/or gene expression that may predict anticancer activity 
and/or pharmacodynamic activity. In addition, for subjects with CLL/SL L, the sponsor may arrange for a portion of the sample to be evaluated at a 
sponsorspecified laboratory for known prognostic markers (e.g., quantitati ve immunoglobulins, FISH panel [chromosome 11q deletion, 13q deletion, 
17p deletion and 12  trisomy], DNA mutational analysis for p53, IgHV [including IgHV3 21], and other genes of interest in CLL [e.g., Notch]; flow cytometr y 
[for CD5, CD10, CD11c, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD38, CD45, kappa and lambda lig ht chains and ZAP 70], and/or β2 microglobulin). The baseline bone 
marrow aspiration procedure (if required) should be performed after the study candidate has undergone the baseline radiology examination and is  otherwise 
considered eligible for study participation. All subjects with CLL /SLL must have baseline imaging (with CT scans [preferred] or MRI scans).  
N Blood sampling for determination of the plasma concentrations of apilimod and metabolites will be performed on C1D1 and C1D8 as follows: pre dose, 
30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours postfirst dose of the day. C1D15 predose onl y. Additional PK samples will be collected, if possible, whenever  a subject has a 
study treatment related SAE or QTc > 500 msec. Subjects a re required to come to the study site in a fasting state prior t o the collection of certain PK samples. 
For analyte determination, PK back up sample will be used from time points: Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1  Day 8 predose. 
O Bone marrow aspirates/biopsies performed within 2 months prior to fi rst dose may be used for clinical baseline assessments. For s ubjects with NHL, 
baseline bone marrow biopsies/aspirates may be omitted if not deeme d essential for response assessment or patient management.  For subjects wi th CLL/SLL, a 
baseline bone marrow aspirate is required unless the presence of suf ficient circulating cells in the peripheral blood (e.g., absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] ≥  10 
x 109/L) permits assessment of baseline parameters as described in Footnote m, a bove. 
P If necessary per applicable response criteria, a repeat bone marrow bio psy or aspirate will be required for subjects who have  a CR by imaging and physical 
examination. 
Q Archival or fresh tumor tissue from the most recent available biops y or surgery prior to first dose in subjects with NHL must be obta ined pretreatment. For 
subjects undergoing a biopsy, adequate tumor tissue should be acquired via exci sional biopsy, incisi onal biopsy or core needle biopsy (e.g., ≥  3 passes using a 
16gauge core need le). Alternatively, cells from a bone marrow aspirate may be obtained in subjects with bone marrow involvement due to NHL. Ti ssue will 
be submitted for evaluation of the percentage of tumor cells and anal ysis of genetic alterations and/or gene expression that may predict a ntilymphoma 
activity and/or pharmacodynamics activity. In addition, for subjects w ith NHL, tumor may be evaluated for known prognostic ch aracteristics (e.g., fo r 
DLBCL: ABC or GCB subtype; expression of BCL2, BCL6, Ki 67, CD20, and MYC; other mutational status). The baseline biopsy procedure  (if required) 
should be performed after the study candidate has undergone the baseline radiology examination and is otherwi se considered eligible for study participation.  
R Blood smears will be collected for microscopic evaluation of vacuole  formation on C1D1 and C1D8 as follows: predose, 4 hours and 8 hours post  first dose 
of the day. C1D15 predose only.  
S  Plasma will be collected for evaluation of circulating cytokines (including IL12 and I L23) predose on each of Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 8, and Cycle 1

I Pregnancy testing (serum or urine) will be required for women of childbeari ng potential (WCBP) only. Testing is required at Screening; within 72 hours of 
Day 1 of each cycle and at EOT. Test does not need to be repeated on C1D1 if baseline was negative and conducted within 72 hours of first dose.  
J Imaging as appropriate for disease indication will be conducted wit hin 30 days of the first dose of study treatment. Suitable  scans performed prior to 
screening and within 30 days before first dose may be used for baselin e tumor assessments.  
K Assessment of disease status will be conducted with standard clini cal measurements: PE, CBCs, bone marrow aspirates/biopsies,  and imaging as appropriate 
for indication. During treatment, scans will be repeated for tumor  assessment within 7 days of Day 1, Cycles 3, 5, and 7 then every 3 m onths until PD or use 
of alternative antineoplastic therapy. For subjects still in res ponse after 1 year, intervals for radiographic surveillance may be eve ry 6 months. Subjects with 
CLL who achieve CR  will require assessment of MRD by flow cytometry of bone marrow a nd peripheral blood.  
L Imaging at EOT is not required if PD has already been radiographica lly documented or last imaging was within 30 days of EOT v isit. 
M Subjects with CLL/SLL must provide  either a fresh blood sample containing circulating tumor cells or a bone marrow aspirate sample pretreatment. Tissue 
will be submitted for evaluation of the percentage of tumor cells and analysis of genetic alterations and/or gene expression that may predict anticancer activity 
and/or pharmacodynamic activity. In addition, for subjects with CLL/SL L, the sponsor may arrange for a portion of the sample to be evaluated at a 
sponsor-specified laboratory for known prognostic markers (e.g., quantitati ve immunoglobulins, FISH panel [chromosome 11q deletion, 13q deletion, 
17p deletion and 12  trisomy], DNA mutational analysis for p53, IgHV [including IgHV3 -21], and other genes of interest in CLL [e.g., Notch]; flow cytometr y 
[for CD5, CD10, CD11c, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD38, CD45, kappa and lambda lig ht chains and ZAP -70], and/or β2-microglobulin). The baseline bone 
marrow aspiration procedure (if required) should be performed after the study candidate has undergone the baseline radiology examination and is  otherwise 
considered eligible for study participation. All subjects with CLL/ SLL must have baseline imaging (with CT scans [preferred] or MRI scans).  
N Blood sampling for determination of the plasma concentrations and activity of apilimod LAM-002A and metabolites will  be performed on C1D1 and C1D8 
as follows: pre -dose, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours post -first dose of the day. Sampling on C1D15 will be pre-dose only. Additional PK samples will be 
collected, if possible, whenever a subject has a study treatment related SAE or QTc > 500 msec.  Subjects are required to come to the study site in a fasting 
state prior to the collection of certain PK samples. For analyte determination, PK back up sample will be used from time points: Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle  1 
Day 8 predose. Clinical Study Report

bone marrow biopsies/aspirates may be omitted if not deemed essentia l for response assessment or p atient management  and there is another source of 
tumor tissue for pretreatment evaluation of gene expression and  prognosis. For subjects with CLL/SLL, a baseline bone marrow aspirate is required 
unless the presence of sufficient circulating cells in the pe ripheral blood (e.g., absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] ≥  10 x 109/L) permits assessment of baseline 
parameters as described in Footnote m, above.  
P If necessary per applicable response criteria, a repeat bone marrow bio psy or aspirate will be required for s ubjects who have a CR by imaging and physical 
examination. 
Q  Archival tissue from the most recent available biopsy or surgery or fresh tumor tissue (preferred) must be obtained pretreatment  for nucleic acid 
extraction. For subjects undergoing a biopsy, adequate tumor tissue should be acquir ed via excisional biopsy, incisional biopsy or core needle biopsy (e.g., 
≥ 3 passes using a 16 -gauge core needle). Alternatively, cells from a bone marrow aspi rate may be obtained in subjects with bone marrow involvement  due to 
NHL (≥50% of cells) . Tissue will be submitted for evaluation of the percentage of tumo r cells and analysis of genetic alterations and/or gene ex pression that 
may predict anti -lymphoma activity and/or pharmacodynamics activity. In addition, tumor tissue from the most recently availably biopsy or surgery 
willmay be evaluated for known prognostic characteristics (e.g., for DLBCL : ABC or GCB subtype; expression of BCL2, BCL6, Ki -67, CD20, and MYC; 
other mutational status) , for PDL1 status, and for immun e infiltration. The baseline biopsy procedure (if required) should ideally be perfor med after the 
study candidate has undergone the baseline radiology examination and is othe rwise considered eligible for study participation .  
R Plasma will be collected on C1D1 pretreatment, on C1D15 pretreatment, and at EOT visit for  evaluation of circulating tumor DNA to measure 
tumor burden and mutational changes . Blood smears will be collected for microscopic evaluation of vacuol e formation on C1D1 and C1D8 as follows: 
predose, 4 hours and 8 hours post first dose of the day. C1D15 predose only.  
S  Plasma will be collected for evaluation of circulating cytokines ( including IL-12 and IL-23) predose on each of C1D1, C1D8, and C1D15  and at EOT. 
T  PBMCs/B-cells will be collected during Screening,  on C1D1 pretreatment; on C1D1 at 8  hours postdose; and on C1D8 at 8 hours post dose for 
determination of changes in gene expression that may predict or correl ate with anti-lymphoma activity and/or pharmacodynamic  activity and will also serve 
as normal-tissue controls for gene mutation studies in tumors .  
U  Saliva will be obtained during Screening predose on C1D1 as a normal-tissue control for gene mutation studies in tumors.  
V LAM-002A to be administered to the subject in clinic  (with recording of the date and actual clock time of the LAM -002A administration).  
W  Information on concomitant medications and other treatments will be collected from 14 days prior to informed consent through 30-37 days after the last dose 
of study drug. 
X Subjects who have discontinued study treatment for reasons other than PD will be assessed per Revised Response Criteria for NHL or Guide lines for the 
diagnosis and treatment of CLL at a minimum of every 12 weeks until doc umentation of PD, start of new anti-cancer therapy or for up to 1 year from the last 
enrolled subject’s first treatment (C1D1) whichever comes first . Long-term follow-up survival information will be obtained in all surviving subjects who 
permanently discontinue study therapy. Such infor mation may be collected at ~3 - to 6-month intervals at the sponsor’s discretion through 3 years. This long -
term follow-up information will be gathered during routine clinic visits, other study site contact with the subjects, or via telephone or  e-mail with the

4 hours (± 1 hour), and 8 hours (± 1  hour) postdose. For C1D15, obtained prior to dosing.  
E Hematology includes hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC count, platel et count, WBC and  differential. 
F All hematology and chemistry labora tory parameters should be assessed at Screening, on C1D1, C1D8 , C1D15, C≥2D1 (all subsequent cycles), and 
at EOT. Obtaining a chemistry laboratory parameter on C1D2 and C1D3 i s only required in subjects w ith intermediate or high risk of TLS (per the 
risk definition in Section 68.1).  Except for C1D1, C1D2, and C1D3, these parameters may be obt ained within 72  hours prior to the planned day of 
collection.  
G Serum chemistry includes albumin, alkaline phospha tase, total bilirubin, BUN, calcium, carbon dioxide,  chloride, creatinine, glucose, inorganic 
phosphorus, potassium, total protein, LDH, ALT, AST, sodium, a nd uric acid. 
H Serum thyroid function tests include TSH, free T3, and free T4 a t C3D1, C5D1, C7D1, C9D1, and then every 4 cycles (12 weeks).  
I Urinalysis includes appearance, specific gravity and pH as well as a semi-quantitative “dipstick” evaluation of glucose, protein, biliru bin, ketones, 
leukocytes, and blood. Microscopic examination of sediment wil l be performed if urinalysis is positive for WBC, pr oteins or blood. Urinalysis may be 
obtained within 72  hours prior to the planned day of collection.  
J Pregnancy testing (serum or urine) will be required for women of ch ildbearing potential (WCBP) only. T esting is required at Screening; within 72 
hours of Day 1 of each cycle and at EOT. Test does not need to be repeat ed on C1D1 if baseline was negative and conducted within 72 hours of first 
dose. 
K Imaging as appropriate for disease indication will be cond ucted within 30 days before C1D1. Suitable scans performed prio r to Screening and within 
30 days before first dose may be used for baseline tumor assess ments. 
L Assessment of disease status will be conducted with standard i maging as appropriate for indicat ion. During treatment, scans will be repeated for 
tumor assessment within 7 days before C3D1, C5D1, C7D1, C9D1, and t hen every 4 cycles (12 weeks) until PD or use of alternative  antineoplastic 
therapy.  
M Imaging at EOT is not required if PD has already been radiograph ically documented or last imaging was w ithin 4 weeks of EOT visit.  
N Blood sampling for determination of the plasma concentrations and  activity of LAM-002A and metabolites will be performed on C1D1 and C1D8 as 
follows: pre-dose, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 hours post -first dose of the day. Sampling on C1D15 will be pre -dose only. Subjects are required to come to 
the study site in a fasting state prior to the collection of c ertain PK samples.  
O Bone marrow aspirates/biopsies performed within 2 mo nths prior to first dose may be used for clinical ba seline assessments. Baseline bone marrow 
biopsies/aspirates may be omitted if not deemed essential f or response assessment or patient management  and there is another source of tumor tissue 
for pretreatmen t evaluation of gene expression and prognosis.  
P If necessary per applicable response criteria, a repeat bone marrow biopsy  or aspirate will be required for subjects who have a CR by imaging and 
PE. 
Q Archival tissue from the most recent available biopsy or surgery or fresh tumor tissue (preferred) must be  obtained pretreatment for nucleic acid 
extraction. For subjects undergoing a biopsy, adequate tumor ti ssue should be acquired via excisional biopsy, incisional biop sy or core needle biopsy 
(e.g., ≥ 3 passes using a 16-gauge core needle). Alternatively, ce lls from a bone marrow aspirate may be obtained in subjects w ith bone marrow 
involvement due to NHL (≥50% of cells). Tissue will be submitt ed for evaluation of the percentage of tumor cells and analy sis of genetic alterations 
and/or gene expression that may predict anti -lymphoma activity and/or pharmacodynamics activity. In addition, tu mor tissue from the most 
recently availably biopsy or surgery will be evaluated for known pr ognostic characteristics (e.g. , for DLBCL: ABC or GCB subtype; expression of 
BCL2, BCL6, Ki-67, CD20, and MYC; other mutational status), for PDL1 sta tus, and for immune infiltration. The baseline biopsy procedure (i f 
required) should ideally be performed after the study candidate ha s undergone the baseline radiology examination and is o therwise considered 
eligible for study participation.  Clinical Study Report

All SAEs and AESIs will be evaluated by the sponsor ’s medical monitor  or designee.  
The investigators must notify their governing IRB of any SAEs in accordance with Section 18.1. 
For any suspected  adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected (not documented in the 
IB or package insert), an Inves tigational New Drug (IND) safety report or revision to the IB may 
be issued to inform all investigators involved in any study with LAM-002A. 
 
Sectio n 11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
Changes: Reference s to the sch edules of assessment tables were included to clar ify where 
information regarding t he timing of e fficacy assessments  could be found. 
11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
Tumor response will be assessed in the Dose Escalation Stage and Expansion Stage using 
modified Lugano Response Criteria for NHL (Cheson 2014) and revised guidelines for the 
diagnosis and treatment of CLL ( Hallek 2008, Cheson 2012) (see Appendix 2). 
Pretreatment tumor assessments will be p erformed within 30 days of the first dose (bone marr ow 
assessment may be performed within 2 months prior to first dose) and will include diagnostic CT 
scans (with intr avenous contract) or PET/CT for subjects with lymphoma (CT only for subjec ts 
with CLL/SLL ), bone marrow aspirate/biopsy, complete blood counts and physical examination. 
It is anticipated that in most cases the PET and CT scans wil l be conducted using a sin gle 
instrument, i.e., as a PET/CT scan (CT scans should be performed usi ng a contiguous 
reconstruction algor ithm of ≤ 5 mm). However, MRI is an acceptable alternative method for 
assessing disease in subjects who cannot receive intravenous contrast  with CT scans. In such 
subjects MRI and PET scans will have to be ob tained separately. Baseline b one marrow 
biopsies/aspirates may be omitted if not deemed essential for response assessment or patient 
management. 
During treatment, radiology studies will be performed for tumor assess ments within 7 days prior 
to Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 7 and then every 3 months thereafter as indicated in Table 8: Schedule 
of Assessments (LAM -002A Continuous Monotherapy Administration), Table 9: Schedule 
of Assessments (LAM -002A Intermittent Monotherapy Administration), Table  10: 
Schedule of Ass essments (LAM -002A/Rituximab Combin ation Therapy), and

Changes: Additional information regarding the timing of pharmacokinetic assessments was 
provided, and r eference s to the schedules of assessment tables were included  to 
clarify where in formation regarding the timing of pharmacokineti c assessments can 
be found. Colle ction of unscheduled pharmacokinetic samples was removed because 
it is difficult to manage and provided little incremental information over the frequent 
pharmacokinetic samples that were already  planned. 
12. PHARMACOKINETIC  ASSESSMENTS  
Plasma concentration  levels of apilimod and the active metabolites will be measured in the 
dose-escalation and dose-expansion stages at each of the specified ti me points; Table 8: 
Schedule of Ass essments (LAM -002A Continuous Monotherapy Admini stration), Table 9: 
Schedule of A ssessments (LAM -002A Intermittent Monotherapy Administration), 
Table 10: Schedule of Assessments (LAM -002A/Rituximab Combination Therapy), and 
Table 11: Schedule of Assessment s (LAM-002A/Atezolizumab Combinatio n Therapy) in 
Section 8.7  The analytical labo ratory will measure plasma concentrations of apilimod using a 
validated analytic method. PK parameters that will be estimated on Day 1 and Day 8 using 
standard non-compartmental methods as follows will include: Cmax, tmax, AUC0-t, AUC τ; t½, 
trough concentrations on Days 8 and 15, and a comparison of AUC 0-t from Days 1 and 8 or 
Days 1 and Day 10 (as appropriate) ; additional parameters may be determined based on the 
available data. Accumulation will be assessed by calculating the Day 15/Day 1 accumulation 
ratios I for Cmax and AUC when comparing Day 8 to Day 1 for all continuous LAM-002 A 
regimens (whether given as monotherapy or in combination) or w hen comparing Day 10 to 
Day 1 for the intermittent LAM -002A regimen. Dose proportionality f or Cmax and AUC0-t will 
be assessed by applying an appropriate power model to the data. Descriptive  statistics of PK 
parameters will include minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, perc ent coefficient of 
variation (%CV), and range.  
Metabolite concen trations at the time p oints indicated in Table 13. All subjects must participate 
in PK assessments. Fasting status must be recorded at the time of each PK blood draw. Clinical Study Report

Section  14. STATISTICS  
Changes: The Stage 1 dose-ranging approach and a statistical basis for t he planned Stage 2 
cohort sizes were  provided.  A method for continuous reass essment of safety crea ted a 
framework for risk assessments associated with the investigational combination 
therapies to be explored in the study. This safety method complement ed the 
restrictions on the pace of Stage 2 combination therapy enrollment detaile d in 
Section  6.1.3  of the protocol. 
14.1. Determination of Sample Size  
14.1.1. Stage 1 (Dose Escalation) 
The planned sample size for the dose -escalation is not based on a specific statistical 
hypothesis but on experience in the conduct of similar trials in  subjects with cancer.   
In the dose escalation, the cohort sizes of 3 to 6 subjects all ow evaluation of regimen safety 
using a standard definition of MTD (ie, a starting dose associate d with DLT in <33% of 
subjects during the first cycle of therapy). Based  on the planned 3+3 do se-escalation 
scheme, Table  14 shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level or proceeding to 
the next stage, based on the true rate of DLT at the current dose level. 
Table 14: Statistical Basis for 3+3 Dose-Escalation Paradigm  
True Incidence  of DLT Probability of Escalating  
10% 0.91 
20% 0.71 
30% 0.49 
40% 0.31 
50% 0.17 
60% 0.08 
Abbreviation: DLT=dose -limiting toxicity  
Thus, if the true underlying proportion of DLT is low (eg, ≤10% at the current dose level, 
there is a high probability ( ≥0.91) of dose escalation to the next dose level. Conversely, if 
the true underlying proportion of DLT is high (eg, ≥60%) at the current dose level, there is 
a low probability ( ≤0.08) of escalation to the next dose level.  
14.1.2. Stage 2 (Cohort Expansio n) 
As indicated in Section  6.1.2, expansion cohorts of 6 subjects will be accrued. Enrollment  of 
6 subjects per cohort offers the opportunity to determine if there is  any antitumor activity 
sufficient to warrant further development in  the selected tumor ty pes. An ORR of ≥  35% is 
considered of potential interest in each of the selected indication s. If 0/6 subjects in a cohort 
experience an objective response, then a population ORR  of ≥ 35% for that cancer can be 
excluded with >  90% certainty (1-sided exact binomial 90% CI upper bound = 32%). Clinical Study Report

Version 9, 18 Feb 2020 
AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprietary Page 284 of 312 Experience indicates the rates of discontinuations from rituxima b or atezolizumab therapy 
are < 5% (Genentech 2016, Genentech 2017 ). A rate of AE discont inuations of therapy due 
to adverse events of ≥25% in the 2 combination therapy groups of LAM -002A/rituximab 
(N = 12) or LAM-002 A/atezolizumab (N = 12) would suggest a potential adverse interaction 
among the components of the combination therapy. Sequentia l Pocock-type boundaries will 
be used to continuously monitor the rate of AE discontinuations a nd to test the null 
hypothesis, after each subject, that the event rate is ≥  0.25 using a 1- sided significance test 
of ~ 0.05. AE discontinua tion rates will be c onsidered excessive if the following n/N values 
are observed: -/1, -/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/5, 4/6, 5/7, 5/8, 5/9, 6/10, 6/11, 7/12. With this method, the 
probability of detecting an AE discontinuation safety signal range s from 0.091 to >0.820 for 
true discontinua tion rates of 25% to ≥  60%. If excessive levels of AE discontinuation are 
observed, the sponsor, working in collaboration with the cooperati ng companies and 
investigators, will take appropriate actions (eg, continuation of t he cohort with 
modifications in design or monitoring plan, interruption of coh ort accrual, cohort therapy 
discontinuation).  
This Phase 1 trial is being conducted primarily to assess the safe ty and tolerability of LAM002A 
(apilimod dimesylate capsules) when administered in subjects with relapsed or refractory Bcell 
NHL and to determine the MTD and RP2D of LAM002A. No formal sample size estimation 
was performed. The choice of the number of subjects was based on the standard 3 + 3 design that 
is commonly used in Phase 1 trials of anti cancer investigational drugs. For the Dose Escalation 
Stage of the study, the maximum sample size will be approximately 60 s ubjects if 6 subjects are 
assigned to each of the 9 potential dose levels and an additional 6 patie nts are accrued at the 
RP2D. However, additional subjects may be added if exploration of interm ediate dose level(s) of 
LAM002A is warranted.  
Up to 45 additional evaluable subjects (3 cohorts of 15 subjects) may be enrolled at the RP2D 
and schedule in the Expansion Stage of the study. The safety population will consist of all 
subjects receiving at least 1 dose of LAM002A. The assessment of DL T and MTD will involve 
only those subjects completing the first cycle of therapy, unless the s ubject discontinuation in 
first cycle was due to a DLT.  
Section  21.  STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
Change: This section was added to separate it from Sections 6.11 and 6.12, which relate to 
duration of therapy and discontinuation of participation for individual subjects. 
12. STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
Both the investigator and LAM reserve the right to terminate the study at any time. Sho uld 
this be necessary, both parties will arrange discontinuation p rocedures. The investigator 
will be responsibl e for notifying the relevant study center IRB. LAM will be respon sible for 
notifying the appropriate regulatory authorities. In terminating th e study, the investigator 
and LAM will assure that adequate consideration is given to t he protection of the subjec ts’ 
interests. As directed by LAM, all study materials must  be collected and al l eCRFs 
completed to the greatest extent possible.

Section 6.8.3 Rituximab or Rituximab/Hyaluronidase  Human  
Change: Use o f eithe r intravenously admin istered rituximab or subcutaneously adminis tered 
rituximab hyaluronidase human was permit ted. Relevant changes were made to 
provide necess ary dosing and administration information.  
6.8.3.1  Premedications 
In accordance with rituximab/rituximab hyaluronidase human  prescribing information 
(Genentech 2016 , Genentech 2018), subjects should be premedicated with an antipyretic and an 
antihistamine to reduce the incidence and sev erity of infusion /injection reactions. A 
recommended regimen is diphenhydramine, 25 mg orally, and acetaminophen ( paracetamol), 
650 mg orally, both given ~30 minutes prior to each rituximab administration. Intravenous 
corticosteroids may als o be administered as a premedication . Local practices and guidelines may 
be followed. 
6.8.3.2  Rituximab A dministration  
Based on past expe rience with this regimen (Ghielmini 2004 , Martinelli 2010), rituximab will be 
administered intravenously or rituximab/hyaluronidase human will be administered 
subcutaneously in the clinic for a total of 8 infusions treatments: 
Intravenous rituximab (Rituxan®) 
• Four induction infusion s of 375 mg/m2 will be administered weekly on Cycle 1 Day 1, 
Cycle 1 Day 8, Cycle 1 Day 15, and Cycle 1 Day 22.  
• Four subsequent maintenance infusions of 375 mg/m2 will be administered every 8 weeks 
on Cycle 4 Day 1, Cycle 6 Day 1, Cycle 8 Day 1, and Cycle 10 Day 1.  
Subcutaneous rituximab (rituximab/hyaluronidase human ; Rituxan Hycela®) 
• An initial dose of 375 mg/mg2 will be administer ed intravenously on Cycle 1 Day1.  
• Three subcutaneous injections of 1,400 mg/23,400 Units (1,400 mg rituximab and 23,400 
Units hyaluronid ase human) will be administered weekly on Cycle 1 Day 8, 
Cycle 1 Day 15, and Cycle 1 Day 22.  
• Four subsequent maintenance subcutaneous injections o f 1,400 mg/23,400 Units (1,400 
mg rituximab and 23,400 Units hyaluronidas e human) will be administered every 
8 weeks on Cycle 4 Day 1, Cycle 6 Day 1, Cycle 8 Day 1, and Cycle 10 Day 1.  
The dose for each infusion will be 375 mg/m2 of body surface area. The dose calculation of b ody 
surface area for infused rituximab will be based on the subject’s height and actual body weight 
prior to therapy. Once established bas ed on the pretreatment body weight, the total dose of 
rituximab for the subject should not be altered during therapy based on fluc tuations in body 
weight unless required by institutional policy . Clinical Study Report

Protocol: LAM-002A-NHL-CLN01 
Version 9, 18 Feb 2020 
AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprietary Page 293 of 312 At Cycle 1 Day 1, ~30 minutes a fter administration of t he required antipyretic and antihista mine 
premedications and ~15 to 30 minutes after administration of the first dose of LAM -002A, the 
first infusion of rituximab will be admi nistered via an infusion pu mp. For the initial infusion, the 
recommended infusion rate is 50 mg/hour. In the absence o f infusion toxicity, the infusion rate 
can be increased in 50 -mg/hour increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hour. 
For subsequent rituximab infusions, the required antipy retic and antihistamine premedicatio ns 
will be given and the rituximab wi ll be infused via an infusion pump. For these infusions, t he 
infusion can be initiated at 100 mg/hour. In the absence of infusion toxicit y, the infusion rate can 
be increased in 100-mg/hour increments every 30  minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hour. 
Alternatively, for subjects who tolerate the first infusion with G rade ≤3 infusion toxicity, 
subsequent infusions can be administered over a planned infusion time of 90 minutes, with ~20% 
of the total dose administered in the first 3 0 minutes and the remaining 80% of the total protein 
dose administered in the subsequent 60 minutes ( Dakhil 2014, Genentech 2016 ).  
For subsequent rituximab/hyaluronidase human injections, the required antipyretic and 
antihistamine premedications will be given  and the rituximab/hyaluronidase human will be 
injected into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen over ~5 minutes. Areas where the skin is 
red, bruised, tender or hard, or areas where t here are moles or scars  should be avoided. No data 
are available on performing the injection at other sites of the body. If administration of 
rituximab/hyaluronidase human  is interrupted, drug a dministration can continue at the same site 
or at a different site but restricted to the abdomen . Patients should be observed for ≥15 minutes 
following the completion of injection. During treatment with rituximab /hyaluronidase human, do 
not administer other medications for subcutaneous use at the same sites.  
6.8.3.3  Management of Rituximab Infusion/Injection Toxicity 
Rituximab can cause  severe, including fatal, infusion reactions ( Genentech 2016). Patients with 
pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions, those who experienced prior cardi opulmonary 
adverse reactions  to rituximab, and those with high numbers of circulating ma lignant cells 
(≥25 x 109/L) may be at particular risk. Severe reactio ns typically occur during the first infusion 
and are generally less frequent and less severe with subsequent infus ions. The time to onset of 
infusion toxicity ranges from 30 to 120 minute s. Rituximab-induced infusion reactions and 
sequelae include urticari a, hypotension, angioedema, hypoxia, bronchospasm, pulmonary 
infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infar ction, ventricular fibrillation, 
cardiogenic shock, and/or anaphylactoid events. 
Rituximab infusions/injections should be interrupted or slo wed in subjects experiencing Grade 
≥3 rituximab-related infusion reactions. Medical management (eg, oxygen, epinephrin e, 
bronchodilators, and/or glucocorticoids) should be instituted, as needed. Upon impr ovement of 
symptoms, the infusion may be continued at 50% of the previous rate. At the di scretion of the 
investigator, rituximab therapy may be permanently discontinued in subjects with Grade 4 
infusion/injection reactions or with reactions requiring substantial intervention. Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprietary Page 294 of 312 6.8.3.4 Rituximab/Rituximab Hyaluronidase Human Dose Modifications and Supportive 
Care 
Rituximab-related noninfectious pneumonitis has been described (Subramanian 2010 ) with an 
incidence of ~4.3% (Salmasi 2010). In patients developing rituximab-associated pneumonitis, 
the mean time from the first rituximab infusion to the onset of respiratory symptoms was 
3 months, with a peak incidence after administration of a mean cumulative dosage of 
1600 mg/m2 (Lioté 2010). 
Severe, including fatal , mucocutaneous reactions can occur in patients receiving rituximab 
during infusion or at later timepoints. Non-infus ion related events have included paraneoplastic 
pemphigus, Stevens Johnson syndrome, lichenoid dermatitis, vesiculobullous dermatitis, and 
toxic epidermal necrolysis  (Genentech 2016). The onset of these reactions has varied from 1 to 
13 weeks following initiation of rituximab exposure. 
Among patients receiving rituximab in combination with chemothera py, rare instances of life-
threatening bowel obstruction or perforation has been observed (Ram 2009), primarily in patients 
with NHL. In post-marketing reports, the mean time to documented gastrointestinal perforation 
was 6 (range 1–77) days from start of chemoimmunotherapy.  
Fulminate and fatal HBV infection and reactivation can occur during or after treatment with 
rituximab (Genentech 2016 ). The risk is very low among patients with negative anti-HBc 
serology (Matsue 2010) and/or undetectable HBV DNA as assessed by quant itative PCR. 
Because subjects with such evidence of persistent HBV infection are excluded from this study, 
reactivation is not anticipated. Other serious bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral 
infections have also occurred during and for ~1 year follow ing rituximab-based therapy 
(Gea-Banacloche 2010). Other new or reactivated viral infections  in patients receiving rituximab 
have included CMV, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West Nile 
virus, and HCV.  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) due to polyomavirus JC has 
been observed in patients who have received rituximab therapy for hematologic malignancies 
(Carson 2009).  
No dose reductions of rituximab/rituximab hyaluronidase human are recommended. If a subject 
experiences an AE that is suspected to be related to rituximab/rituximab hyaluronidase human 
and is of sufficient severity to warrant modification of therapy, administration of the drug should 
be interrupted or discontinued. Protocol-recommended m anagement of selected adverse events 
and appropriate supportive care is described in Table 5. Clinical Study Report

9.3  Rituximab/Hyaluronidase  Human (For Subcutaneous Administration)  
9.3.1. Description 
Rituximab/hya luronidase human (Rituxan Hy cela®) is a genetically enginee red chimeric 
murine/human monoclonal IgG1 kappa antibody directed against the CD20 antigen f ound on 
pre-B and mature B cells. In this formulation, it is combined with hyaluronidase human, an 
endoglycosidase (Genentech 2018). Rituximab is produced by mammalian Chine se hamster 
ovary cells. The prot ein has an approximate molecular weight of 145 kD. Hyaluroni dase human 
increases permeability of  the subcutaneous tissue by temporarily depolymerizing hyaluronan.  
The drug is provid ed as a colorless to yellowish, clear to o palescent, preservative-free liquid 
solution. Each mL of solution contains rituximab (120 mg ), hyaluronidase human (2,000 Units), Clinical Study Report

excluded with > 90% certainty (1-sided exact binomial 90% CI upper bound = 32 %). 
Based on the observation of objective response s among study sub jects with FL receiving either 
LAM-002A monotherapy or LAM-002A/rituximab, expanded accrual of subjects with relapsed 
FL is planned to evaluate the level of ac tivity with these 2 regimens. Preference will be given to 
enrolling subjects to receive LAM-002A monotherapy b efore enrolling subjects to receive 
LAM-002A/rituximab.  
Based on historical data with other treatments (Zelenetz 2014), it is known that an ORR of 
< 20% in subjects with relapsed  FL receiving LAM-002 A monotherapy would be un interesting 
while achieving a target ORR of ≥ 40% would sugges t that further development is warranted. 
Sequential boundaries will be used to continuously monitor that the ORR is ≥ 40% while 
excluding an ORR of < 20% using a 1- sided test with a significance level of 0.05. A significant 
result with this testing  would conclude with 95% confidence that the actual ORR is ≥ 20%. 
Accrual of up to ~20 evaluable subje cts will be considered with the potential to stop ac crual 
early if the boun dary is crossed. Thus, accrual can be considered sufficient if the following n/N 
values are observed: 4/5, 4/6, 4/7, 5/8, 5/9, 5/10, 5/11, 6/11, 6/12, 6/13, 6/14, 7/15, 7/16, 7/17, 
8/18, 8/19, 8/20. For all these value s, the ORR is ≥ 40% with a lower 1-sided binomial 
confidence bound of ≥ 20%. 
As noted above, the target ORR with LAM-002A alone is ~40%. Adding rituximab or rituximab 
hyaluronidase human to LAM-002A would be expected to enhance the ORR over that associated 
with single-agent LAM-002A. Thus, the combination of LAM-002A/rituximab could warrant 
further development if an ORR of ≥ 60% could be targeted in preference to an ORR of < 40%.  
Accordingly, for combination therapy, s equential boundaries will be used to continuously 
monitor that the ORR is ≥ 60% while excluding an ORR of 39% using a 1-sided test with a 
significance level of 0.05. A significant result with this testing  would conclude with 95% 
confidence that the actual ORR is > 39%. A ccrual of up to ~20 evaluable subje cts will be 
considered with the potential to stop a ccrual early if the boundary  is crossed. Thus, accrual can 
be considered suffici ent if the following n/N values are observed: 7/10, 8/11, 8/12, 9/13, 9/14, 
10/15, 10/16, 11/17, 11/18, 12/19, 12/20. For all these values, the ORR is ≥ 60% with a lower 
1-sided binomi al confidence bound of ≥ 39%.
Experience indicates  the rates of discontinuations from r ituximab or atezolizumab therapy a re < 
5% (Genentech 2016, Genentech 2017). A rate of AE discontinuations of t herapy due to adverse 
events of ≥25% i n the 2 combination therapy groups of LAM-002A /rituximab (N = 12) or 
LAM-002A/atezolizumab (N = 12) would suggest a potential adverse interaction among the 
components of the combination therapy. Sequential Pocock-type boundaries will be used to 
continuously monitor the rate of AE discontinuations and to test the null hypothesis, after each 
subject, that the event rate is ≥ 0.25 using a 1-sided significance test of ~ 0.05. AE 
discontinuation rates will be considered excessive if the following n/N values are observed: -/1, 
-/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/5, 4/6, 5/ 7, 5/8, 5/9, 6/10, 6/11, 7/ 12. With this method, the probability of 
detecting an AE discontinuation safety signal ranges from 0.091 to >0.820 for true 
discon tinuation rates of 25% to ≥ 60%. If excessive levels of AE discontinuation are observed, 
the sponsor, working in collaboration with the cooperating companies and investigators, w ill take 
appropriate actions (eg, continuation of the cohort with modifications in design or monitoring 
plan, interruption of cohort accrual, cohort therapy discontinuation). Clinical Study Report

Section 4.1.4.2 Efficacy  
Change: Information regarding LAM-002 A efficacy in NHL was updated in the protocol 
introduction. 
In Study LAM-002A- NHL-CLN01, efficacy has been assessed  in subjects with NHL. Decreases 
in tumor metabolic activity were noted in 3 sub jects with relapsed DLBCL receiving LAM -002A 
monotherapy but these changes did not meet formal criteria for objective response.  Nine subjects 
with FL treated w ith LAM-002A monotherapy, LAM-002A in combination with rituximab, or 
LAM-002A in combination with  atezolizumab have had substantial tumor regressions 
compromising 2 complete responses (CRs) and 7 partial responses (PRs) . The responses have 
been long-lasting, with durations exceeding 12 months am ong several subjects with mature data.  
One subject with M ZL receiving LAM -002A/rituximab also experienced a durable PR. 
Efficacy data in patients with hematological malignancies are evolving. As of 14 Jan 2019, 
2/5 patients with FL receiving LAM002A monotherapy had achieved an objective response 
(1 complete response [CR] and 1 partial response [PR]) ; 2/4 patients with FL receiving 
LAM002A/rituximab had achieved PRs, and 1/1 pa tient with FL receiving  
LAM002A/atezolizumab had achieved a PR. Among subjects with other types of NHL, p ositron 
emission tomography (PE T) demonstrated systemic partial metabolic responses in n odal and 
extranodal lesions in 3 patients with refractory DLBCL  (treated at 100 mg BID, 75 mg TID, and 
125 mg BID) (1 of whom al so received radiation for bulky axillary adenopathy); conco mitant 
computed tomography (CT) demonstrated anatomic shrinkage of many lesions. One  additional 
subject with transformed, refractory DLBCL (treated at 125 mg BID) experienced tumor lysis 
syndrome (TLS). One patient with marginal zone lymphoma ( MZL) (treated at 125 mg BID) has Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprietary Page 309 of 312 had a metabolic response by PET together with a 43% decrease in the s um of the products of the 
perpendicular diameters (SPD) of index lesions by CT. Another patient with MZL an d a patient 
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL) (both receiving 100 mg BID) experienced prolonged 
stable disease through 11+ and 14 cycles, respectively.  
Section 6.1. Overall  Study Design Stage  
Changes: Text was included con sistent w ith addition of an extension stage to the study. 
This is a Phase  1, single-arm, open- label, dose-escalation study of safety and PK of apilimod 
administered to subjects with refractory or relapsed B- cell NHL. This study will be conducted in 
3 stages consists of 2 stages. 
Section 6.1. 3 Extension Stage (Stage 3)  
Changes: Text wa s included to expla in the addition of an extension stage to the study. 
The extension stage ( Stage 3) can begin once the last study subject has completed at least 
8 cycles of study treatment. At this time, the study sponsor will conclude the dose-escalation and 
expansion stages of the study, will collate and verify all study data through an appropriate data 
cutoff date, and will lock the study database for preparation of a study report. Subjects who are 
still safely benefiting from Stage 1 or Stage 2 study therapy as of the data cutoff date may  
electively continue their current regimen of study therapy in Stage 3, receiving clinical care and 
diagnostic testing consistent with c onventional practice standards as deemed app ropriate by the 
treating investigator. Therapy in Stage 3 may continue in the absence of protocol-defined reasons 
to discontinue therapy. During Stage 3, collection of clinical data by the sponsor will be limited 
to serious adverse event (SAE) reports. Study drug accountability will be managed  per site 
procedures; relevant pharmacy records may be collec ted by the sponsor to document study drug 
disposition.  
Section 6.2. Number of Subjects  
Changes: Text was included con sisten t with addition of a n extension stage to the study. 
As many as 145 subjects will be enrolled, assuming that:  
• In the dose-escalation stage of the study, the total number of subjects will depend upon the 
numbers of subjects accrued to each dose level and the number of dose le vels evaluated. If 6 
subjects are enrolled at all open starting dose levels (Dose Levels 5, 6, 7, and 8) and 
6 additional subjects are enrolled at the MTD or RD, as many as 30 subjects could be 
enrolled. To allow for the possibility that s ome subjects may no t be fully evaluable for DLT 
or that an intermediat e dose level might be evaluated, up to ~45 subjects may be enrolled.  
• In the expansion stage of the study, if all 8 potential expansion cohorts are accrued, as many 
as ~76 subjects could be enrolled. To al low for the possibility that some subjects may not be 
fully evaluable for efficacy  or to establish bounds on effica cy estimates with greater 
confidence, up to ~100 subjects may be enrolled.   
• In the extension stage of the study, the total number of subjects will include ≤4 subjects who 
have participated in the expansion stage of the study and are still receiving  study therapy on 
the data cutoff date that co ncludes the dose- escalation and expansion stages of the clinical 
trial. Clinical Study Report

AI Therapeutics Confidential and Proprietary Page 310 of 312 Section 6.5.2. Treatment Period  
Changes: Text was removed consistent with addition of an extension stage to the study. 
The subject is treated and monitored for safety ( including assessments of AEs, vital signs, ECGs, 
laboratory tests and concomitant medications). Additionally, preliminary anti -tumor activity will 
be assessed and PK and biomarker samples will be collected . In the absence of protocol defined 
reasons to discontinu e therapy, subjects may continue to receive study treatment for up to 1 year 
at the discretion of the investigator and beyond 1 year with the agreement of the investigator and 
the sponsor.  
Section  8. Methods of Assessment and Endp oints  
Changes: Text was included consistent with addition of an extension stage to the study. 
All trial data during the dose-e scalation stage (Stage 1) and expansion stage (Stage 2) will be 
recorded on the eCRFs. Timing of study procedures  for the dose-escalation stage (Stage 1) and 
expansion stage (Stage 2) are listed in schedules of assessments tables – Table 8: Schedule of 
Assessments (LAM-002A Continuous Monotherapy Administration ), Table 9: Schedule of 
Assessments (LAM-002A Intermittent Monotherapy Administration ), Table 10: Schedule of 
Assessments (LAM-002A/Rituximab Combination Therapy ), and Table 11: Schedule of 
Assessments (LAM-002A/Atezolizumab Combination Therapy) – in Section 8.7.  During the 
extension stage (Stage 3), collection of clinical data by the sponsor will be limited t o serious 
adverse event (SAE) reports. Study drug accountability will be managed per site procedu res; 
relevant pharmacy records may be collec ted by the sponsor to document study drug disposition. 
Section  9.1.6. Handling and Disposal  
Changes: In the context of transitioning to the extension stage of the study, site mon itoring of 
drug accounta bility  by the contract research organization, C e3, was discontinued. 
LAM-002A  accountability and inventory records will be inspected by the sponsor/Ce3 prior to 
final disposition. Inst ructions will be provided by the sponsor /Ce3 for shipment to and 
destruction of unused LAM-002A product by the designated packaging depot, to include 
unopened bulk bo ttles at the end of the study and expired product. Unused product returned by 
study subjects or opened bulk bottles will be destroyed by each site per sit e SOPs. LAM-002A  
should only be shipped or destroyed upon written authorization from the sponsor /Ce3. 
Documentation of return of shipment, including a packing list and copy of the tracking labe l, 
should be retained in the Pharmacy and/or regulatory files.  
Section  10.6. SAE and AESI Reporting  
Changes: In the context of transitioning to the extension stage of the study, pharmacovigilance 
monitoring of SAEs was transitioned from the contract research organization, 
Pharmalex, Inc. to the study sponsor, AI Therapeutics. 
• The investigator is obligated to immediately report to  Pharmalex, Inc.AI Therapeutics each 
SAE and each AESI that occurs during this investigation, within 24 hours from knowledge of 
the event, whether  or not it is consid ered study-drug related.  
• All requested supplementary documents (e.g., discharge summary, autopsy report) and 
relevant data (e.g., ECGs, lab oratory tests, discharge summaries, post mortem results) must Clinical Study Report

Section  10.7. 14.1.3 Extension Stage (Stage 3 ) 
Changes: Text was included in the statistical section  of the protocol con sistent with addition of 
an extension stage to the study. 
The sample size in the extension stage of the study wil l be no higher than the total number of 
subjects on study therapy on the data cutoff date that concludes the dose- escalation and 
expansion stages of the clinical trial.  
Section  16. Study Monitoring  
Changes: Text was included  consistent with  the plan to discontinue regular monitoring of study 
sites during the extension stage of the study. 
Before an investigational  site can enter a subject into the study, a rep resentative of 
AI Therapeutics will visit the investigational study site to:  
• Determine the adequacy  of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of AI Therapeutics  or its representatives . This 
will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between  AI Therapeutics  and the 
investigator. 
During the study, a monit or from AI Therapeutics  or its representat ive will have regular contacts 
with the investigational site for the following: 
• Provide information and support to the investigator 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational t eam is adhering to the protocol that data are be ing 
accurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that  investigational product accountability checks are 
being performed 
• Perform source data ve rification. This includes a comparison of the data in the CRFs with the 
subject’s medical records at the hospital or prac tice, and other records relevant to the study. 
This will require direct access to all original records for ea ch subject (e.g., clinic c harts) 
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to AI Therapeutics 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs, and confirm a ny SAEs 
have been forwarded to AI Therapeutics  and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting ha ve 
been forwarded to the IRB 
The monitor will be a vailable between visi ts if the investigator or other staff members need 
information or advice. 
Upon conclusion of the Dose-Escalation (Stage 1) and Expansion (Stage 2) stages of the study, 
routine site monitoring by AI Therapeutics or its representatives will be discontinued.  Clinical Study Report

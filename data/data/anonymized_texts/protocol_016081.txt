 1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
This is a blinded randomized control trial comparing a four week treatment with 
the antibiotic rifaximin versus placebo in the management of bowel dysfunction after 
Anterior Resection (AR) or Sphincter Preserving Surgery (SP S) for rectal cancer.  
Patients will be randomized into 2 groups, one group will receive rifaximin 400mg bid for 
4 weeks and the other group will receive a placebo bid for 4 weeks. Prior to 
commencement of treatment patients bowel symptoms will be assessed using the 
MSKCC Bowel Function Instrument (BFI score). For those patients that agree, stool 
samples will be taken and stool bacterial content will be assessed. The same patients 
will also undertake breath testing to assess Small Intestinal Bacterial  Overg rowth 
(SIBO). Following treatment, all patients will again be assessed using the BFI, and stool 
sampling and breath testing will be preformed on those patients that agreed to it. Four 
weeks after cessation of treatment all patients will undertake a third round of testing 
using the BFI and in respective patient, a third round if stool sampling and breath testing 
will occur. 1 -24months following completion of the study, we will ask patients to 
participate in a follow up study using metronidazole 500mg po tid  x 3 weeks on a 
voluntary basis. In this case we will use a phase II design and not compare with a 
placebo  control.  
The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of rifaximin and 
placebo in the treatment of bowel dysfunction as measured by MSKCC Bowel Function 
Instrument in patients following AR or SPS for rectal cancer. A study schema is depicted

3.0 BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
 
The surgical treatment of rectal cancer has become increasingly directed towards 
sphincter preservation where possible, with the avoidance of a permanent stoma. This 
has been accomplished in part by refinement of the  conventional anterior resection with 
surgical techniques such as ultra low anterior resection (LAR), intersphincteric 
dissection, and coloanal anastomosis (CAA). [1, 2] The widespread use of ne o-adjuvant 
radiotherapy and chemotherapy has also led to the down staging of low rectal tumors 
pre-operatively which previously would have necessitated an abdomino -perineal 
resection again facilitating sphincter preserving surgery  (SPS). [3] 
The large number of patients treated by SPS has led to a greater awareness of 
the bowel dysfunction following surgery or so called anterior resection syndrome 
(ARS). [4] Up to 90% of patients develop symptoms o f bowel dysfunction following SPS 
for rectal cancer. The most common symptoms include incomplete evacuation, 
clustering of bowel motions, food affecting frequency, unformed stool, and gas 
incontinence; the less common but more debilitating symptoms are sto ol frequency and  
incontinence. [5] Several surgical treatment factors are known to affect bowel function. I n 
addition, the use of adjuvant or neo -adjuvant radiotherapy to the pelvis has also been 
shown to exacerbate these symptoms and worsen bowel function. [6, 7] These  
symptoms have a significant effect on patient quality of life with 27% of patients 
describing their symptoms as severely affecting their lifestyle and significantly impacting 
on their quality of life.[5] The mechanis ms responsible for these symptoms are not 
clearly understood but are thought to involve a combination of etiological factors, 
including loss of fecal reservoir (rectum), injury to pelvic nerves and sphincter injury. [8- 
11] A variety of novel surgical techniques have been developed with the goal of 
minimizing bowel dysfunction: these include creation of a neo -rectum using a colonic -J- 
pouch, coloplasty, end to side colorectal anastomosis, construc tion of artificial anal 
sphincters, and sacral nerve stimulation. [7, 12] These methods have been met with 
varying degrees of success; however, none have resulted in completely satisfactory 
bowel  function. [13] Currently there is no standard of care for the medical management of 
this bowel  dysfunction.  Patients  are generally  treated  individually  based  on symptomsMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 with a combination of high fibre  diet, antidiarrheal agents, laxatives and/or probiotics 
without significant success.  
Another theory explaining ARS is that denervation of the distal colon and 
reduction of rectal volume leads impaired / inefficient rectal evacuation and a state of 
rectal pseudo -obstruction. The resulting stasis of stool within the colon leads to 
increased numbers of colonic bacteria and subsequently overgrowth of bacteria in the 
large and small bowel contributing to the symptoms of bowel dysfunction.  
Altered bowel function  as a consequence of increased intestinal bacteria is not a 
new concept. Antibiotics are used in many intestinal conditions to improve bowel  
function. Patients with Crohns disease and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth SIBO 
have been shown to benefit from treatment with metronidazole and rifaximin individually, 
with both a reduction in SIBO and bowel symptoms. [14, 15] In active inflammatory bowel 
disease, antibiotic therapy also plays a role i n its management.  Metronidazole appears 
to induce significant clinical improvement in patients with pouchitis compared to 
placebo, [16] and long term treatment using rifaximin and metronidazole reduces the 
incidence of clinic al flare ups of IBD again as compared to placebo. [17, 18] Similarly in 
irritable bowel syndrome, treatment with rifaximin has demonstrated both improvement  
in symptoms and a reduction in SIBO. [19] Finally in patients with chronic liver disease 
antibiotics again specifically both metronidazole and rifaximin have been used to reduce 
ammonia producing bacteria in the intestine and with that the incidence of hepatic 
encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial  peritonitis. [20] 
Within the past two years, the PI has used metronidazole (500mg po tid for 14 
days) to treat severe bowel symptoms in over 20 patients. Over 80% of these rectal 
cancer p atients have reported marked improvement in their bowel function, including 
better stool formation, more complete evacuation, fever bowel motions, and less gas  
formation.  No adverse effects were noted.  However, after stopping metronidazole 
bowel symptoms  were noted to return gradually over one to two months. More recently 
the PI has begun treating patients with rifaximin 400mg bid as it has fewer side effects, 
with similar results. This experience has led us to the theory that by treating patients with 
antibiotics  the quantity  of fecal bacteria  is reduced,  which  in turn improves  stool 
formation, enhances rectal evacuation, and alleviates the symptoms of bowel 
dysfunction.  
 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
Consented patients will undertake the MSKCC Bowel Function Instrument, a 
validated questionnaire developed by the Co -PI that assesses bowel function. [5]  
Appendix 2. Patients will then be invited to undertake a hydrogen breath test and fecalMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 sampling to assess for bacterial content in their small intestine and stool. Following 
stratification of patients by the method of anastomosis (stapled or hand sewn), the 
patients will then be randomized into two groups. The patients will receive treatment with 
rifaximin or placebo depending on the arm of the trial to which they have been 
randomized. Patients will at this stage on a volunteer basis be asked to submit stool 
samples a nd undertake a breath test. Patients will receive the respective treatment for  
four weeks. Following cessation of treatment all patients will be assessed using the BFI 
and respective patients will have repeat stool sampling and breath testing. Patients wil l 
then have these tests repeated 4 weeks later. This corresponds to 8 weeks after the 
start of the trial. For those patients not undertaking stool and breath testing, they will be 
reminded by phone, mail or email to fill out the BFI. Before and during the trial patients 
will be asked to fill out a weekly stool diary to evaluate trends on bowel function.  
Appendix 3. Both the patients and the physicians will be blinded to the patient 
treatments. The Initial consultation along with subsequent rounds of testing  with 
submission of stool samples and breath testing will be undertaken by one of the 
consenting physicians at a specifically arranged and designated “research clinic” at one 
of MSKCC’s network centers. (Sleepy Hollow, Commack, Main Campus and 53rd St). 
Patients may also be seen and  consented at their regular follow up colorectal clinic 
visits. At 1 – 24 months after completion of the phase III portion of the trial, patients will 
be contacted by phone and given the option of receiving metronidazole in a followup, 
single arm study in which all patients receive the antibiotic. Patients who wish to 
participate will be mailed a drug prescription for a 3 week course of metronidazole 
500mgs tid as well as the BFI forms and stool diary. Pretreatment and posttrea tment BFI 
scores will be collected and analyzed for change in bowel function as was done in the 
initial Phase III study.  
4.3 Intervention  
 
The antibiotic used will be rifaximin. Rifaximin acts by inhibition of bacteria 
synthesis of RNA. It is active against gr am positive and gram negative bacteria including 
both aerobes and anaerobes however it is not absorbed in the gastro -intestinal system  
facilitating its use in enteric infections. It is licensed for the treatment of acute bacterial 
diarrhea and SIBO. [21] We have chosen to use rifaximin over metronidazole because it 
is not enterically absorbed and as such has less of a side -effect profile. Metronidazole 
causes a higher incidence of nausea and GI upset, has a greater amount of drug 
interactions and it also has a metallic taste which could effect blinding and introduce 
bias. 
For this trial, both rifaximin and placebo will be prepared in identical capsules by 
the research pharmacist at MSKCC and distributed to the outpatient pharmacies. We 
have chosen a rifaximin dose of 400 mg bid for 4 weeks as this has been shown to be 
efficacious in the treatment of SIBO at this dose over 14 days. We have added a furtherMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 2 weeks to the treatment regime as from prior experience by the PI’s using rifaximin in 
this condition, the beneficial effect tends to reduce over one week. As the BFI is 
validated for use over a 4 week perio d (ie assessing bowel function over a 4 week 
period), to show an effect on bowel function as assessed by the BFI, treatment is 
needed over a four week period. We plan to assess bowel function at 4 weeks after the 
completion of treatment to determine if the response to treatment is transient or whether 
it is a more durable effect. Following the completion of the trial patients will be offered a 
3 week treatment with 500 mg of metronidazole tid. They will be assessed  with the BFI 
at pretreatment and again at 0-1 and 4-6 weeks post treatment. Should the effect be 
transient, this will lead to future studies to assess if adding extra treatment with other 
medications such as pro-biotics may prolong  the effect.

 procedures to construct neo -rectums including j -pouch, coloplasty, and end to 
side anastomosis).  
 Patients ≥ 21 years of  age. 
 Presence of anterior resection symptoms by patients own assessment. 
These symptoms may include any of the following: incomplete ev acuation, 
clustering of bowel motions, frequency of bowel motions, unformed stool, 
excessive  flatus,  or incontinence  of flatus  and/or  feces.  
6.3 Subject Exclusion  Criteria  
 
 Local recurrence of rectal  cancer.  
 Antibiotic  treatment  within  the last 4 weeks  for any condition.  
 Pregnancy or breast  feeding.  
 
7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
Patients who have had an anterior resection for rectal cancer at MSKCC will be 
identified from a prospective database maintained by the Colorectal Surgery Service. 
These patients will be contacted by a letter inviting them to participate in a randomized 
study designed to evaluate the beneficial effects of rifaximin and placebo on bowel  
function. Appendix 1. We will ask patients to participate in the trial based on their own 
personal perception of their symptoms. Patients will be asked in the letter to contact Dr. 
Philip Paty (PI) or Dr. James Smith (Research Fellow) by email, telephone, or letter.  
Patients who have not responded to the letter after one month will be contacted by 
phone  and invited to participate. Appendix 4. Every attempt will be made to recruit 
women and minorities to participate in this study. Participation is voluntary. Patients who 
are interested in participating will be scheduled for a research clinic visit with Dr . Philip 
Paty or another of the consenting professionals. Consenting patients will be registered 
and randomized at the initial clinic visit. We hope to recruit 70 patients, 35 in each arm in 
an attempt to have at least 30 patients per arm for analysis allo wing for patient dropout.  
Patients will also be asked to volunteer to submit stool samples and breath tests.  
Those who agree will be tested for stool bacteria and SIBO at the relevant time points 
along with the MSKCC BFI. For those patients who do not agre e to volunteer to supply 
stool samples and breath test, they will be tested using the MSKCC BFI alone at the 
relevant time periods. All patients will fill out the stool log/diary. We hope to recruit half of 
the patients in each arm to participate in the ex tra testing. We are not testing all patients 
with stool sampling and breath tests as we feel it will hamper accrual into the trial.  
Patients will be reimbursed with a $100 gift card for each outpatient visit to cover 
transport costs for participating in th is trial. Following completion of the phase III portion 
of the trial, patients will be contacted by phone and offered to participate in a follow up 
single arm study to assess the efficacy of metronidazole in the treatment of bowel  
dysfunction.Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 Patients already enrolled on version A(0) or A(1) will also be asked via phone to 
participate in the follow up study. If they wish to partici pate, they will be reconsented. 
Consent forms will be mailed to them with a self addressed return envelope.  
 
8.1 PRETREATMENT  EVALUATION  
 
 Routine clinic evaluation at MSKCC ≤ 12 months of beginning the  trial. 
 Serum beta -HcG levels for pre-menopausal women (last menses within one 
year) ≤ 2  weeks.  
 
9.0 TREATMENT/ INTERVENTION  PLAN  
 
The planned treatment during this trial will be the administration of the antibiotic 
rifaximin 400mg bid for 4 weeks or a placebo bid for 4 weeks to patients with bowel 
dysfunction. Both rifaximin and placebo will be prepared in identical capsules by the  
research pharmacist at MSKCC and distributed to the outpatient pharmacies. Following 
registration to the trial patients will be given a prescription for the tr ial, which they will be 
able to fill out at one of the MSKCC satellite center outpatient pharmacies. Patients will 
be instructed to take then treatment at the same time in the morning and the evening.  
Any missed doses will be recorded in the stool diary/lo g. Once treatment has been 
completed patients will be asked to mail back the treatment container along with any un - 
used medication.  
Once the trial has been completed and patients have been unblinded, patients 
may elect to be treated with Rifaximin if they  so wish.

  MSKCC  BFI 
All patients will be required to fill out a weekly stool log/diary for the duration of the trial. 
There are questions in the log/diary to assess patient compliance also.  
One to twenty -four months following completion of the p hase III trial patients will be  
offered a 3 week course of metronidazole. They will then be assessed again using the 
BFI at pretreatment and at 0 -1 and 4 -6 weeks post -treatment. (21 -30 days and 49 – 63 
days following starting metronidazole)  
MSKCC BFI  
 
The MSKCC BFI is a validated instrument in the assessment of bowel function  
following rectal cancer surgery over a 4 week period. [5] It consists of 18 items to which 
patients respond using a 5-point Likert scale, ranging  from Always  to Never.  There is 
a summary score, and three subscales with good internal consistency (Frequency 
(α=0.75), Dietary (α=0.78), Urgency (α=0.79)) and test-retest reliability (total  score  
=0.84, Frequency=0.74, Dietary=0.62, Urgency=0.87). The instrume nt has 
demonstrated discriminant and  construct validity.  It is written at  a grade  8 reading 
level, and takes  5-10 minutes  to  complete.  The BFI if filled out at home can  be 
emailed or mailed back  to the investigator where they will be stored on a secure 
database and a locked drawer. Should there be any incomplete or ambiguous answers a 
follow up phone call will be made by one of the consenting physicians to clarify the 
answer. However in a prior tr ial by the Co -PI (Larissa Temple 06-151), of the 125 
patients who answered the BFI on multiple occasions less then 5 items per question 
were  missing  or filled out inadequately.  
Breath Test  
 
Methane and hydrogen breath testing is currently the best non -invasive way of 
assessing small bowel bacterial overgrowth. [22] The test takes 1 hour and can be taken 
in the outpatient clinic. The patient must fast at least 12 hours prior to starting the test. 
The patient takes a baseline breath and exhales into a container. He/she then ingests a 
quantity of lactulose. If there is overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine the sugar is 
not absorbed but is instead fermented by the b acteria in the gastrointestinal tract 
producing hydrogen and methane. The human body does not endogenously produce 
either of these gasses. These gasses can then be detected in the breaths of patients 
indicating bacterial overgrowth in the small bowel. Subs equent breaths are then taken at 
varying intervals up to 90 minutes from the initial ingestion of the sugar and are 
assessed for methane and hydrogen levels. The samples will be analyzed at Metabolic 
Solutions  Incorporated®,  a commercial  laboratory.

 Stool samples will be taken during the outpatient visits. Patients can submit a 
sample by defecating into a container or a s ample can be taken by gentle rectal 
examination. The samples will be collected in the outpatient setting and frozen at -80 
degrees Celsius. DNA will be extracted using commercial kits (Qiagen®). Bacterial 
culture has proven to be unreliable as a quantitive  measure of fecal content as only a 
tiny minority of fecal bacteria will survive in culture. As such we plan to quantify fecal 
bacteria using real time quantitive PCR for the gene for 16s ribosomal RNA as 
previously described. [23] This gene is present in all bacteria and has both conserved 
and variable domains. For quantification of total fecal bacteria, PCR primers amplifying 
the conserved domain will be used and the PCR product will be measured using the 
Syber Green method.  
To evaluate the spectrum of fecal bacteria, a PCR plus 454 pyrosequencing 
technique optimized by one of the Co -Investigators (Eric Pamer) will be used. The 
conserved and variable domains of the gene 16S ribosomal RNA will be amplified as 
one PCR product us ing previously described primers. From this product, the variable 
domain will be analyzed using 454 pyrosequencing technique. Microbial complexity will 
be determined and comparisons between samples will be performed using UniFrac and 
Principal Coordinates Analysis. Approximately 120 species of bacteria will be 
represented in the various Pyrosequencing primers. The read out of the assay will give 
a positive fluorescent signal for each bacterial species present in the feces.  
Expertise in both quantifying tota l bacterial load and identifying fecal colonization 
patterns will be provided by Dr Eric Pamer and his laboratory.[24]  
 
Stool Diary/Log  
 
The stool diary/log will allow the investigators to follow trends in bowel function 
and to assess how long the antibiotic effect lasts. Patients will be asked to fill the diary 
out once per week (+/ - 2 days) on paper or by email before and through the duration of 
the trial. The questions asked will address range of stools per day, stool formation,  
flatus, incontine nce, ability to completely evacuate. Patient compliance will also be 
assessed in the log. It will not take longer than 3 minutes to fill out. Once the log is 
competed it can be posted or emailed back to the investigator where it will be stored on 
a secure database and a locked drawer.

 Typhoid Vaccine: Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Typhoid 
Vaccine. Only the live attenuated Ty21a strain is affected. Management: 
Vaccination with live attenuated typhoid vaccine (Ty21a) should be avoided in 
patients being treated with systemic antibacterial agents. Use of this vaccine 
should be postponed until at least 24 hours after cessation of antibacterial 
agents.  
 
12.0 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
The ultimate response to treatment with antibiotics for ARS will be with the 
MSKCC bowel function instrument. This is an 18 point questionnaire which takes about 
10 minutes to complete. It can be completed either in the outpatient setting or at home. 
This instrument has been validated in the assessment of bowel function following rectal 
cancer  surgery over a 4 week period. [5] The BFI score will be calculated by the 
consenting physicians.  
The purpose of the correlative studies is to assess if symptoms of ARS, 
indicated by a reduced MSKCC bowel function instrument s core are associated with 
increased bacterial content in the gastro -intestinal tract or with a specific pattern of 
bacterial colonization. To this end bacterial content in the small intestine will be 
assessed using the breath test and bacterial content and colonization patterns will be 
assessed from fecal stool samples.  
 
13.1 CRITERIA FOR  REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
 
A patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to 
his/her future medical care by his/her physician at the institution  
Criteria for removal for the study include:  
 
 Patient  discretion  
 Significant  noncompliance  by the patient  (<75%  of drug dose  taken)  
 Development  of an grade  3 or 4 adverse  reaction  to rifaximin  
 Recurrence of their rectal  cancer  
 Should a treating physician deem it necessary in the best interest of the  patient  
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
This is a blinded randomized control trial to compare the efficacy of a four week 
treatment with the rifaximin versus placebo in the management of Anterior Resection 
Syndrome (ARS) following Sphincter Preserving Surgery (SPS) for low rectal cancers. 
Patients will be randomized into 2 groups, one to receive rifaximin 400mg  bid for 4 
weeks and one group to receive a placebo bid for 4 weeks.Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 The primary endpoint is the change in the MSKCC bowel function index from 
baseline to 4 weeks after the start of therapy. At 4 weeks the patients will have been on 
therapy for 4 consecutive weeks. The MSKCC bowel function index has been validated 
to examine 4 week changes in the bowel function. [5] It consists of 18 items to which 
patients respond using a 5-point Likert scale, ranging  from Always  to Never.  There is 
a summary score, and three subscales with good internal consistency (Frequency 
(α=0.75), Dietary (α=0.78), Urgency (α=0.79)) and test-retest reliability (total  score  
=0.84, Frequency=0.74, Dietary=0.62, Urgency=0.87).Each subsca le is scored by 
summing up the responses to the items in the subscale. If there are missing items within 
a subscale, the mean of the completed subscale items will be substituted for the item 
when >50 percent of the items in the subscale is completed. A glo bal score will be 
calculated  by adding the subscale scores. An additional aggregate score (total score) 
will also be calculated with the subscales and the single items. A subscale will be 
considered missing if more than one-half of the items are missing. The global score will 
be considered missing if any of the subscales or single items were missing. The average 
total score (frequency, urgency, dietary, plus four single items) among the 129 MSKCC 
rectal patients following SPS used to develop the bowel func tion index was 63.7 with 
standard deviation of 11.6 and range of 35 – 83. Larger BFI scores indicate  better  
function. In this study the main comparison of interest is to examine whether the change 
in global -BFI from baseline to 4 weeks after four weeks of rifaximin is different from the 
change from baseline to 4 weeks of placebo. The analysis will be a done using an 
ANCOVA model, with baseline BFI and treatment indicator as covariates and  4 week 
BFI as the dependent  variable.  
Based on clinical observation,  we expect the difference in BFI between the two 
treatments to be fairly large. We would like to accrue 30 patients in each arm stratified 
by surgical procedure (hand sewn versus stapled anastomosis) for randomization to 
ensure the two arms are balanced, as surgical procedure is known to correlate with  BFI. 
Power calculations are based on the global score on the BFI. Based on Dr 
Temple’s work when developing the BFI score in 129 MSKCC rectal cancer patients, the 
lowest mean BFI score was found among the han d sewn patients. The mean BFI score  
for these patients was 42 with a standard deviation of 8and 51.6 with a standard 
deviation of 9 among patients with stapled anastomosis.  In a current prospective study 
of 225 patients which is still maturing, we have found that at 6 months, the BFI 
discriminates between many clinical parameters with one of the most significant 
predictors being hand sewn vs stapled anastomosis (a surrogate for tumor level) (Mean 
43.3, std 7 (n=36) vs Mean 49.4, std 8 (n=81). Based on these data, we anticipate that a 
difference  of 6 points  on the BFI is clinically  and statistically  meaningful.  
For our power calculation,  we set the type I error at 5%. We assume that the 
placebo arm will have no change in BFI from baseline to 4 weeks after the start of 
therapy. We also assume that the baseline for both treatment groups will be on a similarMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 magnitude. In line with the above  average scores and standard deviations in Dr 
Temple’s past and ongoing studies, we assume that the standard deviation of the  
differences to be 8 and the average BFI score at baseline to be 44. Using a two -sided, 
two sample t -test, we will have 80% power t o detect a difference of differences from 0 in 
the placebo arm to 5.8 in the rifaximin arm with 30 patients in each arm. We expect to 
accrue the 60 patients for this study in 1 year, with a plan to recruit 35 in each arm to 
account for dropout.  
In secondar y analyses, we will examine the change in BFI scores adjusted for 
possible cofounders, such as peri-op radiotherapy. We will also examine bowel function 
data from the weekly logs in order to learn in what time frame (onset, duration) the 
effects of rifaximin and placebo occur. The data will be evaluated by graphical display 
without rigorous statistical testing. The weekly logs will also record drug compliance. 
Bacterial quantity and content in stool along with presence of SBIO will also be assessed 
in secondary analysis. These are both exploratory analyses.  
 
15.1 RESEARCH PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION AND 
RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES  
15.2 Research Participant  Registration  
 
Confirm eligibility as defined in the section entitled Criteria for Patient/Subject Eligibility.  
 
Obtain informed consent, by following procedures defined in section entitled Informed 
Consent Procedures.  
During the registration process registering individuals will be required to complete a 
protocol specific Eligibility Checklist.  
All participants must be registered through the Protocol Participant Registration (PPR) 
Office at Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center. PPR is available Monday through 
Friday from 8:30am – 5:30pm at 646 -735-8000. Registrations must be submitted via the

 be accomplished by the method of random permuted block, and patients will be stratified 
by the variable of type of anastomosis (stapled or hand sewn). Since this is a double 
blind study, the patients’ treatment assignments can be viewed in the CRDB only by the 
hospital pharmacists who are dispensing the study  drugs.  
16.1 DATA MANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
 
A Research Study Assistant (RSA) will be assigned to the study at MSKCC. The 
RSA will be responsible for project compliance, data collection, data reporting, regulatory 
monitoring, problem resolution and prioritization, and coordinate the activities of the 
protocol study team. The data collected from this study will be entered into a secure 
MSKCC database  in regulation with HIPAA guidelines. Hard copies of  the MSKCC 
bowel  function  instrument  questionnaire  will be kept in a locked  drawer.  
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly registration reports will be generated to monitor patient accruals and 
completeness of registration of data. Routine data quality reports will be generated to 
asses missing data and inconsistencies. Accrual rates and extent and accuracy of 
evaluations and follow -up will be monitored periodically throughout the study period and 
potential problems will be brought to the attention of the study team for discussion and 
action.  
Random -sample data quality and protocol compliance audits will be cond ucted 
by the study team, at a minimum of two times per year, more frequently if indicated.  
 
16.3 Data and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and  Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan -Kettering 
Cancer Center were approved by the National Cancer Institute in September 2001. The 
plans address the new policies set forth by the NCI in the document entitled “Policy of 
the National Cancer Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can 
be found at: http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM Plans 
at MSKCC were established and are monitored by the Office of Clinical Research. The 
MSKCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plans can be found on the MSKCC In tranet at: 
http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm  
There are several different mechanisms by which clinical trials are monitored for 
data, safety and quality. There are institutional processes in place for quality assurance 
(e.g., protocol monitoring, compliance and data verification audits, therapeutic response, 
and staff education on clinical research QA) and departmental procedures for quality 
control, plus there are two institutional committees that are responsible for monitoring  
the activities of our clinical trials programs. The committees: Data and Safety Monit oring

17.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
 
Patient wellbein g will always take precedence in this trial however there will be 
minimal patient risk during this trial. Adverse drug reactions will be the most significant 
risk to patient health; however rifaximin carries minimal side effects. Should patients 
develop gr ade 3 or 4 toxicity to the antibiotic treatment, their treatment will be stopped 
and they will be removed from the study. The patient will be responsible for all costs 
related to treatments and complications of treatment except the antibiotic treatment, th e 
placebo, breath testing and stool sampling which will be provided by MSKCC. 
Participation in this clinical trial is voluntary and at any stage patients may opt out to 
pursue any alternative treatment they wish. Once the trial is unblinded patients who 
received placebo during the trial may be treated with rifaximin if they so wish.  
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSKCC’s Privacy Office may allow the use and disclosure of protected health 
information pursuant to a completed and signed Research Authorization form. The use 
and disclosure of protected health information will be limited to the individuals described 
in the Research Authorization form. A Research Authorization form must be completed 
by the Principal Investigator and approved by the IRB and Privacy Board (IRB/PB).  
17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  Reporting  
 
Any SAE must be reported to the IRB/PB as soon as possible but no later than 5 
calendar days. The IRB/PB requires a Clinical Research Database (CRDB) SAE report 
be submitted electronically to the SAE Office at sae@mskcc.org . The report should

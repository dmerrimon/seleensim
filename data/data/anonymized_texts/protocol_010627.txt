(Text -message -based depression prevention fo r high -risk youth in the ED)  
Randomized Trial  
 
Your child is being asked to take part in a research study. All research studies at Lifespan hospitals 
follow the rules of the state of Rhode Island, the Unite d States government and Lifespan. Before you 
decid e whether to allow your child to be in the study, you and the researcher will engage in the 
“informed consent” process. During this process, the researcher will explain the purpose of the study, 
how it will be carried out, and what you r child  will be expec ted to do if they participate. The researcher 
will also explain the possible risks and benefits of being in the study, and w ill provide other 
information. You should feel free to ask any questions you might have. The purpose of these 
discussions is for you  to decide whether participating in the study is the best decision for you r child . 
 
If you decide to allow your child to be in the study, you will be asked to sign an agreement which 
states that the study has been explained, that your questions have been a nswered, and that you agree to 
have your child participate. You will be given a copy of this form to keep.   
 
Federal and Lifespan institution rules require that if your child is 8 years or older, the "assent" 
(agreement) of your child be obtained by the r esearcher before your child may participate in this study.  
Your child must sign the consent form as well.  You will be given a copy of the signed consent form to 
keep.  
 
1. Nature and Purpose of the Stud y 
Your child is being asked to take part in a researc h project to develop and evaluate a text -message 
based intervention to help teens deal with stress and fights , and to prevent depression . In this part of 
the study, we will ask for your child’s participation in the program . We expect to enroll 120 subjects  
into this study. The study is spon sored by the National Institute  of Mental Health.  
 
2. Explanation of Procedures   
Parent/Guardian Initials _____  
RPO  Minor  IC and Auth – v.8-2013  
iDOVE – Aim3: Randomized Trial  Page 2 of 7 v.9 | 11/12/2015 Your child will be randomly assigned (like by the flip of a coin) by a computer to one of two groups. 
Neither you nor the researcher can de cide which group you will be assigned to. For both groups, this 
study will involve your child’s participation in a brief survey and in -person session here in the 
emergency department (ED) , followed by text messages for 8 weeks.  
 
The in-person session will  be conducted right now, before you leave the ED, and will take about  20-30 
minutes. In the session, we will go over with your child either the way that thoughts, emotions, and 
behavior work together (GROUP 1), or ways to improve their use of healthy behav ior like seatbelts 
and nutrition (GROUP 2) . For both groups, we will also go over the text messaging system . During the 
session with your child, we will ask you to step out of the room and you will be given some handouts 
to read .  If your child is discharg ed from the emergency department before finishing the in -person 
session, we will move to a private treatment room to finish it.  It should not take more than 20 -30 
minutes to finish.   
 
The session will be digitally  recorded for quality purposes. Recording s of the session will be kept 
confidential and will be stored in a locked file in a locked research office. All identifying information 
will be destroyed after the study is complete. The audio recordings will be destroyed 5 years after the 
close of the stu dy. The purpose is to evaluate the performance of the study staff, not you.  
 
GROUP 1 participants will receive daily text messages that will provide skills on managing stressful 
situations . Each day, GROUP 1 participants will be automatically sent one text -message question 
about their day, followed by a text message just for your child. The text messages will provide skills on 
managing stressful situations. Although no one will be monitoring the text messages, our program can 
send extra messages on certain topics (“MOOD” and “FIGHT”) if your child needs them. GROUP 2 
participants will receive regular  text messa ges on topics related to diet and nutrition . Messages will be 
sent to your child’s cell phone using an automated computerized system developed by an o utside 
company, Reify Health. Only members of this research team will see your child’s text messages and 
responses.   
 
For both groups, we will contact your child  to complete a follow -up survey and brief interview (over 
the phone, in person, or over the int ernet) at 8 weeks and again at 16 weeks (since the start of the 
study). We will also review the number of hospital visits that your child has had over the 6 months 
following enrollment in the study.  
 
If at any time during the study there are signs that you r child is very depressed, or very likely to 
hurt him/herself or someone else, we will let you know and will help your child get professional 
help.  Additionally, if your child discloses that s/he is a victim of child abuse, we will let you know 
and will n otify relevant authorities. Otherwise, all of your child’s answers are confidential.  
 
Compensation:  Your child will be given a $25 gift card today for completing the in -ED session, $10 
gift cards each month for two months for text -messaging plans, a $40 gift card for the 8 -week follow -
up, and a $50 gift card for completing the 16-week follow -up. In order for this project to have 
scientific value, we need to know whether our interventions were helpful. Therefore, we will make 
every effort to stay in touch, a nd we will compensate your child an additional $5  gift card  if you or 
your child lets us know about any changes in your/their contact information (for instance, their 
cellphone, your cellphone, your address, etc).  Further, if your child completes the 8 -week follow -up 
Parent/Guardian Initials _____  
RPO  Minor  IC and Auth – v.8-2013  
iDOVE – Aim3: Randomized Trial  Page 3 of 7 v.9 | 11/12/2015 survey before their follow -up date, your child will be given  a $5 gift card .  If your child completes the 
16-week follow -up survey before their follow -up date, they will be given a $5 gift card . In total, your 
child may receive up to $150  in gift cards . 
 
Costs for participating in this study:  Some of the services your child will receive are being performed 
only because they are partici pating in this research study. Examples of these ‘research only’ services 
include the in -ED session and 8 weeks of text messages. Those services will be paid for by the study 
and will not be billed to you or your health insurance company.  
 
Other services your child will receive during this research study are considered "routine clinical 
services" that your child wou ld have received even if they were not in the research study. Examples are 
the emergency department care your child will receive today for his/her illness or injury. These 
services will be billed to your health insurance company, but you will be responsibl e for paying any 
deductibles, co -payments, or co -insurance that are a normal part of your health insurance plan.  If you 
do not have health insurance, you will be responsible for those costs.  
 
Contact Information:   The Principal Investigator for this study  is Dr. Megan Ranney. She is available 
to ans wer any questions  at (401) 444 -2557.  
 
3. Discomforts and Risks  
The risks in this study are considered minimal. The types of text messages we are sending to your child 
are common in standard care and do not pose any greater risk than other teens may receive in the 
community. Your child may experience some emotional discomfort in taking part in this study, but 
most children do not. Your child does not need to reply to any text message that makes him/her  
uncomfortab le.  Also, we will make sure that your child’s participation in this study remains 
confidential.  
 
It is very important that you understand that NO ONE is monitoring the text messages at any particular 
time.  If you r child  need s immediate help at any time, please call 911, or one of the crisis numbers we 
will provide to you, or your child’s doctor.  
 
4. Benefits  
You and your child may not receive any benefit from participating in this study. However, by 
participating in the in -ED session and text messages, yo u and your child will have the opportunity to 
learn more about his/her mood .  As a result of this program, your child may develop better skills to 
deal with and prevent stress . Additionally, your child’s participation in this study will help us to design 
a program to prevent stress for other teens.  
 
5. Alternative Therapies  
If you do not choose to participate in this study, we can provide you with the names of other resources 
that pertain to depression/stress and fights.  
 
6. Refusal/Withdrawal  
It is up to y ou whether you want your child to be in the study. You are not required to enr oll your child 
or participate. If you decide you want your child to participate, you can always change your mind and 
remove them from the study  at any time. If you decide not to have your child be in the study, or if you 
Parent/Guardian Initials _____  
RPO  Minor  IC and Auth – v.8-2013  
iDOVE – Aim3: Randomized Trial  Page 4 of 7 v.9 | 11/12/2015 remove them later, your child will still be able to get the health care services they would normally get. 
If you enroll your child but later on the researcher or your doctor feels being in the study is no longer 
good for your child, they may choose to take your child out of the study before it is over . If new 
information becomes available that might change your mind about whether you want your child to stay 
in the study the researcher will share this information wi th you as soon as possible.  
 
You have the right to change your mind at any time regarding follow -up after withdrawal.  If you 
decide to have your child quit the study please tell the head researcher Dr. Megan Ranney at (401) 
444-2557 . 
 
7. Medical Treatment /Payment in Case of Injury   
A research injury is any physical or mental injury or illness caused by being in the study. If your child 
is injured by a medical treatment or procedure they would have received even if they were not in the 
study that is not a r esearch injury. To help avoid research injury and added medical expenses, it is very 
important to follow a ll study directions carefully. If your child does experience a research injury, 
Lifespan or the study doctor can arrange medical treatment for them. S uch treatment will be paid for as 
described below.  
 
If you have insurance and your child has a research injury that is not covered by the study, it is 
possible that some or all of the cost of treating your child could be billed to your insurer . If your hea lth 
insurance will not cover such costs, it is possible you would have to pay out of pocket. In some cases, 
Lifespan might be able to help you pay if you qualify for free care under Lifespan policy . However, 
Lifespan has no policy to cover payment for such  things as lost wages, expenses other than medical 
care, or pain and suffering.   
 
8. Rights and Complaints  
Signing this form does not take away any of your lawful rights. If you or your child have any 
complaints about your child’s participation in this st udy, or would like more facts  about the rules for 
research studies, or the rights of people who take part in those studies, you may contact Janice 
Muratori , anonymously if you wish, in the Lifespan Office of Research Administration, telephone 
number (401) 444-6246 . 
 
9. Confidentiality and Research Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Your Health Care 
Information  
Your child’s research records will be treated as private health care records and will be protected 
according to Lifespan privacy practices and p olicies . In particular, we are require d to get your 
permission to use or disclose (release your child’s information to someone outside of Lifespan) their 
health information for research purposes. If you sign this form you agree to have your child be in thi s 
research study and you permit the use and disclosure of your child’s health information for the purpose 
of conducting the research, providing treatment, collecting payment and running the business of the 
hospital.  This permission has no expiration date.  
 
We will do everything we can to keep others from learning about your participation in this study. To 
further help us protect your privacy, we have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the United 
States Department of Health and Human Services (D HHS).   
 
Parent/Guardian Initials _____  
RPO  Minor  IC and Auth – v.8-2013  
iDOVE – Aim3: Randomized Trial  Page 5 of 7 v.9 | 11/12/2015 With this Certificate, we cannot be forced (for example by court order or subpoena) to disclose 
information  in the  research records  that may identify you in any federal, state, local, civil, criminal, 
legislative, administrative, or other proceedin gs. The researchers will use the Certificate to resist any 
demands for information in the  research records that would identify you  or your child , except to 
prevent serious harm to you or others, and as explained below.   
 
You should understand that a Certif icate of Confidentiality does not prevent you, or a member of your 
family, from voluntarily releasing information about yourself, your child , or your involvement in this 
study.   
 
If an insurer or employer learns about your participation, and obtains your c onsent to receive research 
information, then we may not use the Certificate of Confidentiality to withhold this information. This 
means that you and your family must also actively protect your own privacy.   
 
Disclosure will be necessary, however, upon requ est of DHHS for the purpose of audit or evaluation, 
and is limited only to DHHS employees involved in the review.   
 
You may withdr aw from the study at any time. However, if you do not want the researchers to use or 
disclose any further information in this study you must cancel permission in writing  and may do so at 
any time. If you cancel your permission, you will stop taking part in the study and no new information 
will be collected about you. However, if you cancel your permission, it will not apply to ac tions 
already taken or information already collected about you by the hospital or the researchers before you 
canceled your permission.  
 
Generally, the entire research record and any medical records held by the hospital may be used and 
released for research  purposes.  The following  people or businesses/companies might use, release, or 
receive such information:  
 The researcher and their support staff;  
 The study sponsor National Institute of Mental Health  
 Doctors, nurses, laboratories and others who provide ser vices to you in connection with this 
study;   
 The company or section of the U.S. government that is paying for the study and others they 
hire to oversee, administer, or conduct the research;  
 The United States Food and Drug Administration, the Department o f Health and Human 
Services, the Office of Inspector General, and the Office of Civil Rights;  
 People who volunteer to be patient advocates or research volunteer protectors;   
 Members of the hospital's administrative staff responsible for reviewing, approv ing and 
administering clinical trials and other healthcare or research activities.  
 Accrediting Organizations  
 
There are times when Lifespan needs to release your child’s health inform ation without your 
permission.  For example, Rhode Island law requires res earchers and health care workers to report 
abuse or neglect of children to the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) and to report 
abuse or neglect of people age 60 and older to the Department of Elderly Affairs.

Study Title
A Phase 2, International, Multicenter, Randomized, Open-label, Par allel Group Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of CC-486 (oral azacitidine) Alone and in Combination With 
Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in Subjects  With Myelodysplastic Syndromes Who Fail to Achieve an 
Objective Response to Treatment With Azacitidine for Injection or Decitabine
Indication
The treatment of myelodysplastic s yndromes (MDS) not res ponding to prior treatment with 
azacitidine for injection or decitabine.
Objectives
Primary Objective
The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of CC-486 as monotherapy, 
and in combination with anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, durvalumab (MEDI4736), in 
subjects with MDS that did not respond to treatment with an injectable hypomethylating agent (HMA – azacitidin e for injection or decitabine), or were unable to tolerate tr eatment 
with an injectable HMA.
Secondary Objectives
!Assess the safety and tolerability of CC -486 alone and in combination with 
durvalumab, as treatment for MDS
!Describe the clinical relevance of objec tive hematologic and/or biologic responses 
associated with treatment with CC-486 alone and in combination with durvalumab
!Evaluate the impact (if any) of durvalumab on the pharmacokinetics of CC-486 and 
CC-486 on durvalumab in subjects with MDS
 
 
 
 
Study Design
This is a Phase 2, international, multic enter, randomized, parallel group, open-label study 
consisting of: Screening, Safety run-in, Randomized Treatment , Follow-up , and Extension Phase .  
The randomized portion of the study will be pr eceded by a non-randomized  safety run-in to

Confidential and Propri etary 7 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019evaluate the safety and tolerability of the planned regimens, and to determine the recommended 
dose for the monotherapy and combinati on therapy arms for the randomized phase.
The safety run-in will utilize a 3+3 design to include at least 3 subjects treated with monotherapy 
at the dose and schedule expected to be used in combination, as well as at least 3 subjects treated with combination therapy to evaluate safety and tolerability. The monotherapy arm will be 
enrolled first to confirm the expected safety profile of CC-486 alone at the planned dose and 
schedule in the target population. 
Data from the safety run-in will be reviewed in conjunction with the study investigators, 
Scientific Steering Committee, and Data Monitoring Co mmit tee to ensure agreement with the 
recommended Phase 2 dosing regimens prior to beginning enrollment to the randomized treatment phase.
The randomized treatment phase will be conducted in 2 stages, with a fut ility assessment planned 
at the completion of Stage 1 to determine whether the null hypothesis (H
0: p <12.5%) can be 
rejected with 3 or more responses in Stage 1. If 3 or more responses have been observed before 
the end of Stage 1, the planned futility assessment may be pe rformed earlier than at the 
completion of Stage 1 to confirm the finding of responses. This earlier analysis will replace the futility analysi s planned at the completion of Stage 1. This earlier futility assessment will have 
the same integrity as the futility assessment planned at the completion of Stage 1. An analysis 
will be performed at the completion of Stage 2 to estimate the overall response rate of treatment of all the subjects in the cohort.  All subjects who receive investigational product (IP) in this 
study will continue to be followed for information related to post-treatment safety and 
subsequent MDS therapies, as described in Section 4.1.5 .
Approximately 10-12 evaluable subjects randomized  to the combination treatment arm at 
selected study centers will participate in PK sampling procedures as described in Section 6.10.
Extension Phase
At the Investigator’s discretion and following c onfirmation of eligibility cr iteria below, subjects 
can enter the Extension Phase (EP):
Eligibility Criteria:
!Subjects who have signed the informed consent for the EP of the study;
!Subjects receiving oral azacitidine and continuing in the Treatment Phase 
demonstrating clinical benefit as assessed by the Investigator are eligible to receive 
oral azacitidine in the EP;
!Subjects who do not meet any of the criteria for study discontinuation (see 
Section 12).
Details for the EP are provided in Appendix J .
The study design is described in detail in Section 4.1.
Study Population
The study will enroll at least 70 to 194 evaluable subjects with MDS who did not respond to an 
adequate course of therapy with an injectable hypomethylating agent (i HMA – a zacitidine for 
injection or decitabine) as their last treatment for MDS, or who we re unable to tolerate an iHMA

Confidential and Propri etary 8 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019following at least 3 months  of attempted treatment. Comp lete inclusion and exclusion criteria 
for this study, including the definition of an adequate course of therapy, and required parameters 
for hematology, performance status, renal a nd hepatic function are detailed in Section 7.
At least 3 subjects will be enrolled in each of two treatment groups (monotherapy and 
combination therapy) during the safety run-in  phase of the study: The monotherapy treatment 
group w ill be enrolled first and evalu ated for dos e-limiting toxicity (Section 4.1.2.1 ), prior to 
selecting a CC-486 dose and regimen, and initiating enrollment for the combination treatment group. Progre ssive disease (PD) and stable disease (SD) designations are made based on the 
subject’s best response to iHMA therapy determined at the start of the study (see Section 4.1).
A total number of 64 evaluable subjects will be enrolled equally during the first stage of the 
randomized tr eatment phase into 4 cohorts:  SD monotherapy, PD monotherapy, SD combination 
therapy, and PD combination therapy.  If the required number of objective responses are 
observed in a cohort, the cohort will be continue d into the second stage of study to include 25 
more subjects (see Section 4.1, Section 10.3, and Figure 2 ).
The study is closed to further enrollment with the last subject enrolled in June 2018. A total of 65 
subjects were enrolled in the study. At the time of this amendment, 6 subjects are ongoing in the 
Monotherapy SD/PD cohorts (One subject from Phase 1, and 5 from Phase 2).
Length of Study
The total duration of this study is expected to be approximately 75 months (see Section 4.3).  
Subjects will undergo screening procedures over a period of up to 28 days following the signing 
of their informed consent document (ICD).  Eligible subjects will continue to the safety run-in or 
the randomized treatment phase of the study where they will receive IP for up to six 28-day treatment cycles.  Those who derive benefit from the treatment may continue IP until loss of that 
benefit (Section 4.1.3 ). 
After treatment discontinuation, subjects will be  followed for 28 days for CC-486 safety-related
issues and 90 days for durvalumab safety-related issues. After that, subjects w ill be contacted by 
telephone every 3 months in the follow-up phase of the study.  
The enrollment period for this study is expected to last approximately 39 months.  The treatment 
and follow-up periods are expected to conclude approximately 12 months after the last subject is 
enrolled.  The Extension Phase is expected to last approximately 24 months. Therefore, the total 
duration of the study is expected to be approximately 75 months.  
The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the 
study, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is required for 
primary, secondary and/or exploratory analysis,  as pre-specified in the protocol and/or the 
Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP), whichever is the later date.
The study will conclude once all subjects have completed or discontinued from the Extension 
Phase.

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 9 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019Eligible subjects who are assigned to the monotherapy treatment ar m will receive CC-486 at the 
dose and schedule identified during the safety ru n-in phase of the study .  Dose and schedule 
may be reduced to manage toxicity or increased as described in Section 8.2. Subjects can 
continue treatment with CC-486 as long as all protocol-sp ecified re-tr eatment criteria continue to 
be met (see Section 8.2.5 ).  
Durvalumab (MEDI4736)
Eligible subjects who are assigned to the combination therapy tr eatment arm will receive CC-486 
as described above, and durvalu mab 1500 mg on Day 1 of each 28- day treatment cycle by 1-hour 
(± 5 minutes) intravenous (IV) infusion.  For toxicity considered by the investigator to be related 
to treatment with durvalumab, including immune-med iated adverse events (i mAEs) or infusion-
type reactions, the infusion of durvalumab may be slowed, interrupted, or discontinued as 
described in Section 8.2.4.2 .  Dose reduction for durvalumab is not permitted. Subjects can 
continue treatment with durvalumab in combina tion with CC-486 as long as all protocol-
specified re-tr eatment criteria continue to be met (see Section 8.2.5 ). 
Overview of Efficacy Assessments
The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial is the proportion of subjects achieving an objective 
response (hematologic improvement (HI), partial remission (PR), complete remission (CR), or 
marrow CR – modified from International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria – Appendix F ) to 
treatment with CC-486 alone and in combination with durvalumab.  To assess this endpoint, bone marrow examination will be required prior to beginning IP and following every 2 cycles of 
treatment during the first 6 treatment cycles.  Subjects who continue beyond Cycle 6 will 
undergo bone marrow examination following every 3 treatment cycles or when necessary to confirm suspected hematologic response or dis ease progression.  Bone marrow samples (aspirate 
and/or biopsy), along with a peripheral blood smear and pertinent clinical i nformation will be 
submitted for review by an independent pathologist to provide consistency in determinations of disease classification, response, and/or progression.  
Hematologic parameters including complete blood count (CBC) with white blood cell (WBC) 
differential and platelets will be assessed by the central laboratory at the frequency described in 
the Table of Events ( Table 2 ) and Section 6.7.7 .
To understand the potential impact of any immunogenic response to durvalumab on the efficacy 
of the treatment, immunogenicity assessment will be performed at the frequency described in the Table of Events ( Table 2 ).

Overview of Pharmacokinetics Assessments
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analy sis will be collected from approximately 10-12
evaluable subjects randomized to the combination treatment arm at selected sites.  This w ill 
enable assessment of drug-drug interactions.  Subjects participating in PK procedures will agree 
to have blood samples collected as described in Section 6.10.
Sample Size Determination and Statistical Analysis (Randomized Treatment Phase)
The sample size required will be identical for each cohort and is estimated using the optimal 
design of the Simon's two-stage design method ( Simon, 1989 ). The null hypothesis of the
response rate will be tested against a one-sided alternative. 
For each cohort, the null hypothesis of response rate (H0: p ≤ 0.125) will be tested against the

power. During the first stage, 16 subjects will be accrued per cohort. If there are 2 or fewer 
responses in these 16 subjects, the cohort w ill be st opped and no further recruitment will be

rejected. 
For each cohort, in addition to the evaluation of treatment responses based on objective response 
criteria, the quality of responses will also be considered for the decision whether to continue the cohort to the second stage of the study. Quality of response will be assessed based on the 
magnitude of hematologic and biologic responses observed in individual subjects, with special 
consideration for response duration, and will be specified with more details in the final SAP.
For the primary objective, the response rate at the end of Stage 2 and the associated 95% 
confidence interval will be estimated for each cohort  which completes Stage 2. Similar estimates 
for Stage 1 will be provided for an y cohort which does not  continue to Stage 2. The response 
rates at the end of Stage 2 will be compared between cohorts of SD and PD subjects (if both 
cohorts finished Stage 2) using the relative risk ratio or other appropriate methods. Specifically, 
if relative risk method is used, the ratio of response rates for both cohorts and the associated 95% confidence interval will be es timated. Description of methodologies will also be provided in the 
SAP if other methods are used.
For the secondary objectives, Kaplan-Meier’s method will be used to analyze the time-to-event 
variables, which include overall survival, time  to response, duration of response, and time to 
disease progression. The safety and tolerability of the regimen in this sample of subjects will be 
estimated and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be estimated.
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee will re view the safety data during the safety run-in 
phase. The committee will also review the efficacy and safety data during the randomized phase 
of the study, in addition to the recommendation for any cohort to continue to Stage 2 of the 
study. The details of the data monitoring plan will be provided in a separate charter document.

1.1. Myelodysplastic Syndromes
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is an umbr ella term that encompasses a heterogeneous 
collection of hematopoietic stem cell disorders primarily  affecting older adu lts.  MDS is typically 
characterized by bone marrow hyperplasia and peri pheral cytopenias that manifest clinically as 
anemia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia of variable frequency and severity, with symptoms of anemia being the most frequently-presenting manifestation.  Anemia is the most 
frequent laboratory finding and it often progresses to red blood cell (RBC) transfusion 
dependence.  Other less common presenting clinical features related to the cytopenias are an increased risk of infection and/or hemorrhage and a potential to progress to acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) ( Catenacci, 2005 ).  The latter clinical features often appear over time and are 
associated with more advanced disease.
Myelodysplastic syndromes are classified acc ording to World Health Organization (WHO) 
criteria by pathologic features on bone marrow examination into the following categories 
(Brunning, 2008; Vardiman, 2009; Appendix A ):  
!Refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia (RCUD)
∀refractory anemia (RA)
∀refractory neutropenia (RN)
∀refractory thrombocytopenia (RT)
!Refractory Anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS)
!Refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD)

Confidential and Propri etary 22 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019blast percentages.  Overall survival and risk of progression to AML is significantly different in 
the 4 risk groups.  Median survival for patients in these risk groups being 5.7 years (Low), 3.5 
years (INT-1), 1.2 years (INT-2), and 0.4 years (High).  The median t ime for 25% of patients to 
progress to AML is 9.4, 3.3, 1.1, and 0.2 years, respectively ( Greenberg, 1997 ).
Allogeneic bone marrow transplan tation ha s been effective, both in patients under the age of 
50 years and in those older than 50 years who are in good health and who have suitable human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched donors.  However, this approach has limited value, since most patients with MDS are older than 65 years of  age and have significant comorbidities that 
preclude the use of this modality as it is associ ated with a high morbidity and mortality rate, as 
described in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines: MDS ( NCCN, 2015 ).  
For patients diagnosed with, or progressing to, higher-risk disease, the standard of care is 
treatment with a locally-available injectable HMA: azacitidine for injection or decitabine.  Injectable HMAs can produce hematologic response or improvement in approximately half of 
treated patients, but responses are transient and responding disease will eventually relapse
(Grinblatt, 2008 ; Lyons, 2009 ; Musto, 2010 ; Silverman, 2002 ).
There are no approved (or proven) treatment opti ons following failure of treatment with an 
injectable HMA.  The mainstay of therapy in this setting among patients not eligible for 
autologous stem cell transplant remain s supportive care, including RBC and/or platelet 
transfusions, treatment of infections, and the use of eryth ropoiesis s timulating agents (ESAs)
such as epoetin alfa or darbepo etin, plus hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) when needed ( Lübbert, 2000 ; NCCN, 2015 ;Kadia, 2011 ). 
Neither ESAs nor myeloid growth factors are approved for the treatment of MDS.  
Thus, additional data regarding the use of potentially-e ffective agents in this population is greatly 
needed. 
1.2. CC-486 (Azacitidine)
CC-486 is an oral formulation of azacitidine.  A zacitidine is an analog of the naturally occurring 
pyrimidine nucleoside cytidine and is classified as an ant imetabolite.  In the United States (US), 
azacitidine (Vidaza®) is approved for the treatment of all 5 FAB classification subtypes of MDS: 
RA, RARS, RAEB, RAEB-T, and CMML, but it is not routinely utilized in the lower-risk 
disease setting.  Azacitidine is approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of adult 
non-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-eligib le patients with IPSS INT-2 or high-risk MDS, 
CMML with 10% to 29% marrow blasts without myeloproliferative disorder, and AML with 
20% to 30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to the WHO classification.  In addition 
to the US and EU, azacitidine is currently approved in 30 other countries, including Canada, Switzerla nd, Australia, and Japan, for the treatment of MDS (approvals for specific subtypes 
vary by country).  Current approved routes of administration include subcutaneous and 
intravenous (approvals va ry by country).  Similarly, decitabine (Dacogen
®), another 
hypomethylating agent, is approved in the US for treatment of all FAB classification subtypes 
and IPSS INT-1, INT-2 and high-risk MDS.
Azacitidine has strong in vitro and in vivo anti-leukemic activity and the ability to induce 
differentiation at lower concentrations in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell lines.  The

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 23 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019effects of azacitidine may result from multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), and protein synthesis, incorporation into 
RNA and DNA, and activation of DNA damage pathways.  The ability of azacitidine to cause 
differentiation can be attributed to its activity as a hypomethylating agent.  The degree of methylation of cytosine residues in DNA has been demonstrated to play a role in gene 
expression.  Indeed, hypermethylation of cytosine residues of genes critical to ensure orderly cell 
proliferation and maturation (differentiation) is frequently found in primary neoplasms and tumor cell lines ( Zingg, 1997 ).  Therefore, use of an inhibitor of DNA methylation, such as 
azacitidine, is a rati onal approach to reversing these epigenetic aberrations in the malignant clone 
and to re-establishing antiproliferative signals  that were extinguished  by hypermet hylation.  
Preliminary data from the AZA-PH-GL-2003-CL-001 survival study ( Herman, 2009 ) with 
azacitidine in higher-ri sk MDS patients found, from analysis of pretr eatment bone marrow 
methylation density, that the overall survival benefit observed with azacitidine versus conventional care regimens (CCR) was independent of the methylation status of the 5 genes 
analyzed (CDKN2B [p15], SOCS1, CDH1 [E-cadherin], TP73, and CTNNA1 [ α-catenin]).  
However, increasing methylation was associated with worse overall survival.  Patients with lower levels of methylation treated with azacitidine had the best overall survival, suggesting that 
they may derive greater benefit from azacitidine.
Azacitidine has been  studied extensively in MDS and has been shown in a large, randomized, 
Phase 3 trial of higher-risk MDS patients to provide a survival advantage of 9.4 months over 
CCR.  The median overall surviv al of azacitidine- treated patients was 24.5 months compared 
with 15.0 months for the CCR group, which included best supportive care, low-dose cytarabine, 
or intensive chemotherapy ( Fenaux, 2009 ).  The clinical experience with azacitidine in AML is 
smaller, but positive efficacy results have been obtained.  In a subset of 113 patients with WHO-
defined AML (mean age 70 years, 24% with unfavora ble karyotype, median bone marrow blasts 
23%) from the larger MDS study discussed above, the median overall survival was 24.5 months 
(n = 55) in the azacitidine arm compared wi th 16.0 months (n = 58) in the CCR arm ( Fenaux, 
2008 ).  Additionally, the outcome was not significan tly different in patients with an unfavorable 
karyotype, although the sample size was small.  Silverman et al, using WHO-defined AML 
criteria for diagnosis, reported a median over all survival of 19.3 months (n = 27) in patients 
treated with azacitidine compared with 12.9 months (n = 25) in patients who received best supportive care ( Silverman, 2006 ).  Additionally, Goldberg et al. reported on 33 patients who 
received azacitidine (n = 11, median age 74) or 7+3 intensive chemotherapy (n = 22, median age 
67 years) ( Goldberg, 2006 ).  Median blast count at bas eline was 42% in the azacitid ine group 
and 65% in the intensive chemotherapy group.  The median overall survival was 13.2 months in 
the patients treated with azacitidine compared with 9.2 months in patients receiving intensive 
chemotherapy ( Goldberg, 2006 ).  All of the above-mentioned studies used the standard injectable 
azacitidine dose of 75 mg/m
2/day for 7 days.
Most responses to azacitidine occur by the comp letion of 6 cycles of treatment, but responses 
may still occur beyond this ( Musto, 2010 ; Silverman, 2006 ).  Elderly patients (> 70 years of age) 
respond as well as younger patients, and failure to respond to prior therapy with ESAs does not 
preclude possible responses to azacitidine ( Musto, 2010 ). Overall response rates in lower-risk 
MDS subjects have been reported as approximately 50% in various studies ( Grinblatt, 2008 ; 
Lyons, 2009 ; Musto, 2010 ; Silverman, 2002 ).

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 24 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019An oral formulation of azacitidine (CC-486) has been  evaluated in 3 clinical studies to date.  
Results from a pilot study (AZA PH US 2007 PK 004) indicated that azacitidine in an oral 
formulation was bioavailable ( Garcia-Manero, 2008 ).  This was confirmed when evaluating 
several different formulations of the drug in a Phase 1 study (AZA PH US 2008 CL 008).  Results from another Phase 1 study of CC-486 in subjects with MDS, CMML, or AML (AZA 
PH US 2007 CL 005) indicated that administration on different treatment schedules (7-, 14-, and 
21-day once daily [QD] and 14- and 21-day twice daily [BID]) was feasible, generally well-tolerated, and exhibited biologic and clinical activity ( Garcia-Manero, 2009 ; Garcia-Manero, 
2010 ).  
1.3. Durvalumab (MEDI4736)
Durvalumab is briefly described below.  Refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure for further 
details.
Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG )1 kappa m onoclonal antibody (mAb) that 
blocks the interaction of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) (but not programmed cell death ligand-2) with programmed cell death 1 (P D-1) on T-lymphocytes (T-cells) and cluster of 
differentiation (CD) 80 on immune cells and is engineered to reduce antibody-dependent cell-
mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).
1.3.1. Durvalumab Experience in Solid Tumors
Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 is a Phase 1, firs t-time-in-human, multicenter, open-label, dose-
escalation, and dose-expansion study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or 
optimal biologic dose, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of 
durvalumab in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy or for 
which no standard therapy exists. 
As of 12 July 2016, a total of 1012 subjects with advan ced solid tumors have been treated in this 
study. Of these subjects, 970 have received durv alumab at 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks (Q2W), 
either in the dose-escalation or dose-expansion phase of the study. The 10 mg/kg Q2W cohort 
represents combined data from subjects treated with this dosing regimen in either the dose-
escalation or dose-expansion phase. The 10 mg/kg Q2W cohort comprises subjects with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (n = 304), urot helial carcinoma (n = 191), squam ous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and microsatellite instability high (both n = 62), 
gastro-oesophageal cancer (n = 51), ovarian cancer (n = 47), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (both n = 40), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 31),
uveal melanoma (n = 24), non-SCC HN human papilloma virus (positive) (HPV+) (n = 22), 
advanced cutaneous melanoma and s mall cell lung cancer (both n = 21), glioblastoma 
multiforme and soft tissue sarcoma ( both n = 20) and nasopha ryngeal carcino ma (n = 10). 
Subjects in the 10 mg/kg Q2W dose cohort were exposed to a median of 6 doses of durvalumab, 
ranging from 1 to 27 doses.
Of the 970 subjects treated with 10 mg/kg Q2W, 947 subjects (97.6%) had at least 1 adverse 
event (AE) (regardless of causality). AEs (all grades) reported in decreasing order of frequency 
in ≥10% of subjects were fatigue  (37.6%), nausea (23.7%), decreased appetite (23.2%), dyspnea 
(21.9%), constipation (20.2%), diarrhea and cough (17.9% each), back pain (16.5%), vomiting 
(15.9%), anemia (15.6%), abdominal pain (14.4%), pyrexia (13.9%), arthralgia (13.1%), edema

incidence of AEs was generally similar.
Grade 3 or higher AEs were reported in 295 subjects (30.4%) and were manageable by general 
treatment guidelines described in the toxicity man agement guidelines contained in each of the
study protocols. Events occurring in >2% of subjects were anemia (6.2%), dyspnea (6.0%),

abdominal pain (3.1%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (2.9%), back pain (2.9%) and dehydration (2.6%).
A total of 554 subjects (57.1%) reported AEs that were considered by the investigator to be 
related to investigational product. Treatment-related AEs (all grades) reported in > 5% of subjects were fatigue (18.7%), nausea (7.9%), diarrhea (7.6%), pruritus (6.8%), decreased 
appetite (6.7%), hypothyroidism (6.3%) and rash (6.0%). The majority of the treatment-related 
AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity with ≥Grade 3 events occurring in 88 subjects (9.1%). 
Treatment-related ≥Grade 3 or 4 events reported in ≥2 subjects were fatigue (1.6%), AST 
increased (1.0%), alanine aminotransferase (A LT) increased (0.8%), GGT increased (0.7%),

event (autoimmune hepatitis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, pneumonia and pneumonitis).
Serious adverse events (SAEs) (regardless of causality) have been reported in 504 of 970 
subjects (52.0%) treated with 10 mg/kg durvalumab Q2W. Serious adverse events reported in 
>1% of subjects by descending order of fre quency were: NSCLC (4.5%), dyspnea (4.3%), 
abdominal pain and bladder cancer (2.7% each), pneumonia (2.5%), pyrexia and sepsis (2.3% each), general physical health deteriorati on (2.0%), back pain (1.8%), acute kidney injury, 
dehydration, pleural effusion and urinary tract infec tion (1.5% each), lung neoplasm malignant 
(1.4%), respiratory failure and vomiting (1.2%) and hypercalcemia (1.0%). Thirty-nine subjects (4.0%) had SAEs considered by the investigator to be related to durvalumab. Treatment related 
SAEs that occurred in > 1 subject each were colit is and pneumonitis (4 subjects each), nervous 
system disorder (3 subjects), and acute kidney in jury, AST increased, and diarrhea (2 subjects 
each). The majority of the treatment-related SAEs were Grade 3 or higher in severity and 
recovered with or without sequelae.
No clinically meaningful difference in the AE profile across doses was observed, including 
Grade 3 or 4 events, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, or treatment-related AEs.
As of 29 April 2016, 304 NSCLC subjects had received durvalumab monotherapy; 144 subjects 
(47%) with non-squamous and 160 subjects (53%) with squamous histology. Subjects with tumors defined as PDL1 positive had improved overall rate of objective response (ORR) and 
overall survival (OS). The ORR, was 25% and 6% in PD-L1 positive and negative subjects, 
respectively. The 12-month OS rate was 55.8% and 38.8% in PD-L1 positive and negativesubjects, respectively. 
As of 29 April 2016, 62 subjects with recurrent/metastatic SCCHN had received durvalumab

Carcinoma: As of d ata cut-off (DCO) on 20 November 2015, 61 sub jects had been enrolled into 
the urothelial cell cohort. Forty-two sub jects who initiated study therapy ≥12 weeks prior to 
DCO were evaluable for response. Confirmed ORR was 46% in the PD-L1 positive subgroup compared to 0% in the PD-L1 negative subgroup. ORR in the entire response evaluable 
population was 31% (13/42 subjects).
Other indications: In PD-L1 unselected subjects, the ORR, based on investigator assessment per 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, ranged from 0% in uveal 
melanoma to 17.4% in advanced cutaneous mela noma, and disease control rate (DCR)-24w 
ranged from 4.2% in TNBC to 39.1% in advanced cutaneous melanoma. Across the PD-L1 high tumors, ORR was >10% for advanced cutaneous melanoma and HCC (33.3% each). In the PD-
L1-positive subset, DCR- 24w was >10% in advanced cutaneous melanoma (66.7%) and HCC 
(33.3%).
As of 24 July 2016, PK data were available for a total of 977 subjects following treatment with 
0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W and 15 mg/kg Q3W (dose escalation), 10 mg/kg Q2W (dose-expansion), 
and 20 mg/kg Q4W (dose-exploration) durvalumab administered as an intravenous (IV) i nfusion 
over 60 minutes. PK samples were analyzed using an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) method 
for quantitative determination of durvalumab in human serum with lower limit of quantitation 
(LLOQ) of 50 ng/mL in 100% matrix. 
Following the first IV dose, durvalumab exhibited nonlinear PK at doses < 3 mg/kg Q2W likely 
due to saturable target-mediated clearance (CL) and exhibited linear PK at doses ≥3 mg/kg 
Q2W. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)0-14 increased dose-proportionally at doses of 3 to 20 mg/kg and more  than dose- proportionally at doses of < 3 mg/kg, likely due to 
saturable target-mediated CL. Maximum observed concentration (C
max) increased in a dose-
proportional manner within the dose range examined. The steady state was achieved at approximately Week 16. Accumulation of durvalumab was observed following repeated dosing. 
Mean accumulation ratio (AR) ranged from 0.64 to 1.87 and 3.15 to 4.93 for C
maxand trough 
concentration (C trough) , respectively.
As of 24 July 2016, a total of 790 subjects provided samples for anti-drug antibody (ADA)
analysis. Only 25 of 790 subjects (1 subj ect each in 0.1 and 3 mg /kg cohorts, 17 sub jects from 10 
mg/kg cohort) were ADA positive. One subject in the 10 mg/kg cohort tested positive for anti-
TM antibody. Three subjects were neutraliz ing ADA (nAb) positive. For the proposed clin ical 
dose, of 751 subjects (ADA evaluable population) treated with 10 mg/kg Q2W, 2.8% (21/751) 
had treatment-emergent ADAs and 0.1% (1/751) of subjects were positive for nAb. Based on population PK covariate analys is, ADA positive status was not associated with a clinically 
relevant reduction of exposure to durvalumab. At the 10 mg/kg Q2W dose, sPD-L1 suppression 
in ADA positive subjects was similar to that obse rved in ADA negative subjects. The relevance 
of ADA on safety and efficacy is unknown given the small number of ADA positive subjects.

1.4. Study Rationale
The original protocol rationale was to evalu ate the efficacy and safety of CC-486 as a 
monotherapy only.  
Currently, this clinical study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of CC-486 alone, and in
combination with durvalumab, in sub jects with myelodysplastic syndromes, refractory to 
treatment with azacitidine for injection or decitabine; ie, stable disease or disease progression
was the best response to that treatment.  
1.4.1. Azacitidine Exposure
While injectable hypomethylating agents (azacitid ine for injection and decitabine) remain the 
standard of care in the treatment of IPSS higher-risk  MDS, as many as half of affected patients 
do not respond to treatment, and nearly all those who do respond will eventually relapse.  Upon failure of treatment with azacitidine for injection and/or decitabine, the prognosis for patients

(Prebet, 2011; Jabbour, 2010 ).  Similarly, injectable HMAs are approved for treatment of IPSS 
lower-risk MDS in some countries , and while there are few data to characterize outcomes in 
lower-risk disease following failure of these agents, prognosis is poor and for patients who are not eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant, no proven treatment options currently exist 
(Jabbour, 2013 ). 
Aberrant hypermethylation of DNA is a feature of myelodysplastic syndromes, and is implicated 
in the pathogenesis and progression of disease ( Gore, 2006 ).  This supports the notion that 
epigenetic changes play an important role in MDS transformation and may be exploited.  
However, association between the degree of constitutive methylation and magnitude of reduction in methylation state via treatment with HMAs has not been clearly correlated with treatment 
outcomes ( Follo, 2009 ).  
Azacitidine is a cytidine analog that may, in pa rt, exert its antineoplastic effect by incorporation 
into DNA of cycling cells and subsequent hypomethylation through inhibition of DNA 
methyltransferases.  Optimal drug activity may require an increased window of exposure to 
malignant cells to increase the opportunity for cycling cells to incorporate drug ( Mahfouz, 2013; 
Stresemann, 2008 ). 
An oral formulation of azacitidine provides an opportunity to deliver the drug daily over a more 
prolonge d schedule than can be practically achieved with parenteral therapy.  In a Phase 1 dose-
finding study, the safety, bioavailability, and biologic effects of CC-486 were evaluated.  
Compared with 75 mg/m
2 subcutaneous (SC) AZA, 300 mg CC-486 QD x 14 days and QD x 21 
days provided mean cumulative exposures (AUC) per cycle of approximately 38% and 56%, respectively.  With SC AZA 75 mg/m
2QD, 7/28 days, DNA methylation was significantly 
reduced, with its greatest reduction in global de-methylation score (GDMS – percent of highly-
methylated loci) of -8.8% at Day 15.  However, methylation increased throughout the remaining 
21 days of the cycle to a GDMS of -3.2% by cycle end.  In subjects treated with CC-486 300 mg 
QD,14/28 days and 21/28 days, methylation was significantly reduced at Day 15 (-3.3% and -
5.3%, respectively), Day 22 (-3.8% and - 6.7%) and cycle end (-2.4% and -5.0%) ( Laille, 2015 ).  
Despite the reduced bioavailability of CC-486 compared to azacitidine administered 
subcutaneously, the oral agent, given 21/28 da ys, is associated with greater reductions in GDMS 
through the end of the treatment cycle.  Twic e-daily dosing may further enhance target 
engagement and achieve greater reductions in global methylation.  In the study described above, 
though few subjects received BID oral dosing, the largest absolute reductions in DNA 
methylation were associated with BID dosi ng.  CC-486 200 mg BID taken 21/28 days was 
associated with the greatest reductions in  GDMS:  -11.0%, -11.8%, and -9.1% at Day 15, Day 
22, and Day 28, respectively ( Laille, 2015 ).
An orally administered hypomethylating agent may offer several advantages when compared to 
parenterally administered agents. Oral administration eliminates the need for the patient to travel 
for parenteral administration. Furthermore, as no injection is needed, there is the potential to 
decrease adverse events at the site of injection including pain and infection.
Demethylation of several immune checkpoint genes was seen in these analyses which is in line 
with findings that PD-1 and PD-L1 expressi on was increased after treatment with HMA

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 29 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019(Yang, 2014 ).  Due to these findings, it is hypothesized that CC-486 could be an effective 
treatment for MDS patients  who have failed HMAs. 
The goal in treating this population and in evalu ating new potentially therapeutic options is to 
capture or recapture hematologic response or hematologic improvement ( Appendix F ), to reduce
the rate of disease progression and AML transformation, and to prolong survival.  Despite active 
interest in the post-HMA setting among researchers, there remains a critical unmet medical need.  
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for detailed information concerning the available 
pharmacology, toxicology , drug metabolism, clinical studies, and adverse event profile of the 
Investigational Product (IP).  The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP), and the applicable regulatory requirements.
1.4.2. Cancer and Immune Function
The importance of the immune system in cancer development and progression has been 
recognized during the past decade ( Hanahan, 2000 ). Failure of immune surveillance of pre-
neoplastic lesions and micro-metas tases is a key step in cancer development. Chronically 
immunosuppressed individuals show higher rates of cancer. This observation led to the 
hypothesis that sporadic cancers among immune-competent individuals are likely to be minimally immunogenic, allowing for passive escape from immune surveillance. Recent data 
suggest that this may be an oversimplification. Some sporadic tumors are highly immunogenic, 
but actively suppress the local immune e nvironment through production of immunosuppressive 
cytokines ( Shields, 2010 ). As such, the local tumor environment is likely a highly dynamic 
environment where most tumors grow and metastasize through adaptive responses that modulate 
antitumor immunity. The complexity and redundancy of the immune system offers multiple targets that may be manipulated to maximize the body’s inherent immune response to a tumor. 
Immune response may be augmented by directly stimulating effector cells, indirectly stimulating 
effectors by augmenting antigen presentation activity or costimulation, or by suppressing immunosuppressive factors, cells, or messages ( Monti, 2005 ). 
1.4.3. Immune-checkpoint Inhibition
Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have the capacity to control the growth of many types of 
cancers ( Gooden, 2011 ). Most tumors show infiltration by TILs, but tumors modulate the local 
microenvironment through expression of inhibitory molecules. Engagement of TIL cell-surface receptors with these inhibitory ligands lead s to a dysfunctional immune  response, causes T-cell 
exhaustion, and facilitates tumor progression ( Baitsch, 2012; Crespo, 2013 ). It is increasingly 
appreciated that cancers are recognized by the immune system, and under some circumstances, the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors ( Dunn, 2004 ).  Novel monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) that block these inhibitory receptors have shown significant clinical activity 
across a number of tumor types ( Wolchok, 2009; Hodi, 2010; Robert, 2011; Brahmer, 2010; 
Topalian, 2012 ). Specifically, blockade of immune-checkpoint inhibitors such as cytotoxic T-
lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), PD -1, and PD-L1 have shown clinical activity not 
only in conventionally immune-responsive tumors  such as melanoma and renal cell carcinoma 
but also in NSCLC ( Brahmer, 2010; Brahmer, 2012; Topalian, 2012; Gordon, 2013 ), and 
prostate cancer ( Harzstark, 2010 ).  Pembrolizumab and nivolu mab are both PD-1 blocking 
antibodies and the first in the anti-PD-1 pathway family of checkpoint inhibitors to gain approval

nivolumab for melanoma and squamous cell lung cancer. Both pembrolizumab and nivolumab 
have received European Commission regulatory  approval for the treatment of metastatic 
melanoma. The European Commission has also approved nivolumab for the treatment of advanced previously treated squamous NSCLC.
The PD-1 receptor, in conjunction with recept or ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, functions to regulate 
the immune system primarily by down regulating signals of the T-cell receptor.  PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells binds to PD-1 on T- cells which leads to down-regulation of T- cell 
activity and allo ws tumor cells to evade the immune response 
Recent advances in immunotherapy offer promise for improving clinical outcomes in patients 
with MDS or AML. Studies in mouse models of transplantable tumors have demonstrated that 
manipulation of costimulatory or co-inhibitory signals can amplify T-cell responses against 
tumors ( Peggs, 2009 ). This may be accomplished by blocking co-inhibitory molecules such as 
CTLA-4 or PD-1 from binding with their ligands, B7 or B7-H1 (PD-L1).
PD-L1 and PD-L2 are expressed on many human lymphomas ( Li, 2012 ; Chen, 2013 ). PD-L1 has 
been detected on several hematologic malignancies, including Hodgkin lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, acute 
myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and adult T- cell leu kemia/lym phoma ( Liu, 
2007 ; Dorfman, 2006 ; Rosenwald, 2003 ; Tamura, 2005 ; Xerri, 2008 ). PD-L1 expression has 
been detected on several myeloid cell lines, sugge sting that PD-L1 expression continues to 
suppress immune function ( Dolen, 2013 ). In addition, in MDS subtypes, PD-L1 expression on 
myeloblasts has been associated with MDS transformation to AML ( Ogata, 2012 ). Myeloid 
leukemia cell lines that were treated with the hypomethylating agent decitabine were shown to 
have an upregulation of PD-L1 expression ( Yang, 2012 ). Upregulation ( ≥ 2 fold) of PD-L1 has 
been observed in 25% of AML CD34+ samples, 33% of PD-L2, and 22% of PD-1 ( Yang, 2014 ).
PD-1 signaling may be involved in MDS pathogenesis and resistance mechanisms to azacitidine; 
therefore, combined blockade of this pathway can be a potential therapy in MDS and AML 
(Yang, 2014 ).
PD-L1 expression is present in MDS and AML, with increased expression observed in advanced 
disease. In addition, there has been evidence to  suggest that PD-L1 is upregulated in myeloblasts 
in MDS subtypes ( Yang, 2014 ). Therefore, a rationale exists for evaluating durvalumab in 
combination with azacitidine in subjects with MDS and AML.

1.4.5. Rationale for Durvalumab Fixed Dosing Regimen
The dose and schedule for durvalumab monotherapy (20 mg/kg once every 4 weeks [Q4W]) 
were selected based on 2 sets of data: (1) the safety analysis of doses (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 
mg/kg once every 2 weeks [Q2W]) administered in Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 (a Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of IV durvalumab given as monotherapy in 
subjects with advanced solid tumors; and (2) PK profile simulations for durvalumab
administered using 10 mg/kg Q2W and 20 mg/kg Q4W schedules.
Safety and PK characteristics of the studied dose and schedule 10 mg/kg Q2W:
After evaluation of the PK data from subj ects enrolled in Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108, 
durvalumab exhibited nonlinear (dose-dependent) PK consistent with target-mediated drug disposition. Linear PK was observed at doses of 3 mg/kg and higher and is consistent with near 
complete target suppression, as reflected in target trough plasma concentrations of drug >100 
ug/mL. This trough concentration is supported by soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) suppression data. 
Furthermore, the 10 mg/kg Q2W dose was not a ssociated with any DLTs in the dose escalation 
portion and was, therefore, selected for further evaluat ion in the dose-expansion portion of Study 
CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108.
Extrapolation of dose and schedule of 10 mg/kg Q2W to 20 mg/kg Q4W through population PK 
modeling:
A population PK model was devel oped using durvalumab monothe rapy data from Phase 1 of 
Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 (N=292; doses = 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W or 15 mg/kg Q3W; solid
tumors) ( Fairman, 2014 ). This population PK model adequately described monotherapy PK data 
and was utilized to predict expected PK expos ures following 20 mg/kg Q4W dosing regimens 
(since none of the monotherapy studies explored Q4W regimens). Pharmacokinetic simulations 
indicate that a similar overall exposure as represen ted by AUCs (4 weeks) is expected following 
both 10 mg/kg Q2W and 20 mg/kg Q4W regimens. However, median C
maxat steady state is 
expected to be higher with 20 mg/kg Q4W (~1.5 fold) and median trough concentration at steady 
state is expected to be higher with 10 mg/kg Q2W (~1.25 fold). 
Justification for fixed dosing over weight-based dosing:Population PK analysis indicated only minor impact of body weight (WT) on PK of durvalumab
(coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The impact of body WT-based (10 mg/kg Q2W) and fixed dosing (750 mg 
Q2W) of durvalumab was evaluated by comparing predicted steady state PK concentrations (5th, median, and 95th percentiles) using the population PK model. A fixed dose of 750 mg was 
selected to approximate 10 mg/kg (based on median body WT of ~75 kg). A total of 1000

Confidential and Propri etary 32 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019subjects were simulated using body WT distribution of 40 to 120 kg. Simulation results 
demonstrate that body WT-based and fixed dos ing regimens yield s imilar median steady state 
PK concentrations with slightly  less overall between-subject variability with fixed dosing 
regimen.  
Similar findings have been reported by others ( Ng, 2006; Wang, 2009; Zhang, 2012; Narwal, 
2013 ). Wang and colleagues investigated 12 monoclonal antibodies and found that fixed and 
body size-based dosing perform similarly, with fixed dosing being better for 7 of 12 antibodies 
(Wang, 2009 ). In addition, they investigated 18 therap eutic proteins and peptides and showed 
that fixed dosing performed better for 12 of 18 proteins in terms of reducing the between-subject 
variability in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics parameters ( Zhang, 2012 ). 
A fixed dosing approach is preferred by the prescribing community due to ease of use and 
reduced dosing errors. Given expectation of similar pharmacokinetic exposure and variability, 
we considered it feasible to switch to fixed dosing regimens. Based on average body WT of 75 kg, a fixed dose of durvalumab at 1500 mg Q4W (equivalent to 20 mg/kg Q4W) is included 
in the current study.

4.1. Study Design
This is a Phase 2, international, multic enter, randomized, parallel group, open-label study 
consisting of 5 study phases: Screening, Safety Run-in, Randomized Treatment , Follow-up , and
Extension .  
The study is closed to further enrollment with th e last subject enrolled in June 2018. A total of 65 
subjects were enrolled in the study. At the time of this amendment, 6 subjects are ongoing in the 
Monotherapy SD/PD cohorts (One subject from Phase 1, and 5 from Phase 2).
The study is amended to include an Extension Phase (EP).  The EP allows subjects who are 
currently receiving oral azacitidine and who are demonstrating clinical benefit as assessed by the 
Investigator, to continue receiving oral azacitidin e until the subject meets the criteria for study
treatment discontinuation.  No survi val will be followed during the EP.
ASafety Run-in will first explore the saf ety and tolerability of m onotherapy, followed by
combination therapy to confirm that there are no overlapping or synergistic toxicities limiting the 
ability of the two drugs  to be delivered in combination (see Figure 1 ).  
The randomized treatment phase of the study will be conducted in 2 stages.  Following 
identification of dose and schedule in the safety run-in of a tr eatment arm, enrollment for Stage 1 
of the treatment phase may begin.  Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of two open treatment arms:
!Monotherapy – CC-486 alone, or
!Combination Therapy – CC-486 plus durvalumab
In the event that only one treatment arm for a c ohort is open for accrual due to available safety 
and efficacy data, subjects will be assigned to treatment on the open arm.
Throughout the study, subjects will be categorized as having Progressive Disease (PD) or Stable 
Disease (SD) and these designations are made based on the subject’s best response to iHMA 
therapy determined at the start of this study (see Section 7), and any marked changes in their 
disease prior to beginning treatment in this study (eg, a subject with stable disease as their best 
response to iHMA therapy, but with subsequent disease progression would be assigned to the PD group).  Numb ers of subjects with PD and SD allocated to each treatment arm will be monitored 
to enable the planned analyse s for each sub-population.  Hence there are 4 cohorts being 
evaluated in this study:
!Monotherapy, progressive disease
!Monotherapy, stable disease
!Combination therapy, progressive disease
!Combination therapy, stable disease
Excluded from participation in this clinical trial is the cohort of patients that initially 
demonstrates a positive response to treatment with an injectable HMA, but subsequently relapses.  This group is thought to represent an especially difficult-t o-treat sub-population in

Confidential and Propri etary 37 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019which gaining disease control is unlikely with currently-available or experimental options.  Even 
among patients not responding to initial HMA therapy, some will experience rapidly-progressing 
disease characterized by dramatic increases in myeloid precursors and blast cells in the marrow 
or blood.
This multi-center, international study will enroll at least 70 to 194 evaluable subjects (inclusive 
of subjects in the safety run-in and randomized phases). 
At least 6 subjects will be included in the safety run-in: 3 receiving monotherapy, and 3
receiving combination therapy (see Figure 1 ).  The dose and schedule of CC-486 to be evaluated 
in combination with a fixed dose of durvalumab will be determined as described in Section 4.1.2.
In the randomized treatment phase, eligible subjects  will be randomized to  receive CC-486 alone 
or in combination with durvalumab.  The randomized treatment phase will be conducted in 2 
stages, with a futility assessment planned at the completion of Stage 1 to determine whether the 
null hypothesis (H0: p <12.5%) can be rejected with 3 or more responses in Stage 1. If 3 or more 
responses have been observed before the end of Stage 1, the planned fut ility assessment may be 
performed earlier than at the completion of Stage 1 to confirm the finding of responses. This 
earlier analysis will replace the fut ility analysis planned at the completion of Stage 1. This ear lier 
futility assess ment will have the same integrity as the fut ility assessment planned at the 
completion of Stage 1. An analysis will be performed at the completion of Stage 2 to estimate the 
overall response rate of treatment of all the subjects in the cohort (see Figure 2 ). Additional
analyses will be conducted approximately 12 months after the last subject is enrolled, as 
described in Section 4.1.5 and Section 10.6.2 .
During the randomized treatment phase of the study , approximately 32 subjects with PD and 32 
subjects with SD will be randomized evenly to receive either CC-486 alone, or CC-486 + 
durvalumab.  There will be 4 cohorts (16 subjects in each) in Stage 1:  SD treated with 
monotherapy, PD treated with monotherapy, SD treated with combination therapy and PD treated with combination therapy. If there are 2 or fewer responses in any cohort during Stage 1, 
enrollment to that arm will be termin ated.  Otherwise,  the cohort w ill continue to Stage 2 and 
accrue an additional 25 subjects each.  If 8 or more responses are observed in these 41 subjects, the null hypothesis will be rejected for that cohort.  During the course of the study, whenever 
both cohorts of the same patient classification (ie, SD or PD) are open for enrollment, established 
randomizatio n procedures will be followed. During Stage 1, if a cohort is awaiting the decision 
to continue to Stage 2 pending on the response evaluation while the other cohort of the same 
patient classification is open for enrollment, available patients will be assigned to the cohort with 
open enrollment without randomization. If both cohorts of the same patient classification are waiting for response evaluations, enrollment of that patient classification will be temporarily 
halted.
Therefore, the total number of subjects for the randomized treatment phase will range from
approximately 64 (at Stage 1) to 164 (Stage 1 plus Stage 2) for the 4 subject cohorts.  More 
subjects can potentially be recruited for replacem ent of non-evaluable subjects, if needed (see 
Figure 2 ).

Confidential and Propri etary 38 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019Best supportive care measures should be used in combination with study treatment as deemed 
necessary.  Best supportive care includes, but is not limited to, treatment with RBC transfusions (packed red blood cells [pRBC] or whole blood), single donor or pooled donor platelet 
transfusions, antibiotic, antiviral and/or antifungal therapy, antiemetic and/or antidiarrheal 
support, nutritional support as needed, and granulocyte/granulocyte macrophage colony-
stimulating factors (G/GM-CSF) for subjects experiencing neutropenic fever/infection, or as 
secondary prophylaxis as described in Section 9.1.  Best supportive care for this study excludes 
the use of ESAs and other hematopoietic growth factors (eg, thrombopoiesis stimulating agents).
4.1.1. Screening Phase
Screening procedures are conducted within 28 days prior to enrollment and beginning treatment 
in the safety run-in or treatment phase of the study to ensure that all inclusion and exclusion 
criteria are satisfied.
Documentation co llected by the study site and la boratory values obtained from the local and/or 
central laboratory are used to review the subject’s eligibility and baseline disease characteristics; eg, WHO/FAB classification ( Appendix A / Appendix B ), IPSS ( Appendix C ), and International 
Prognostic Scoring System-Revised (IPSS-R) ( Appendix D ) risk classification.  Bone marrow 
biopsy and aspirate, blood, and relevant clinical documentation obtained during screening will be sent for centralized review by an independent pathologist to ensure consistency in determination 
of diagnosis and baseline disease characteristics.  If documentation of MDS diagnosis, 
WHO/FAB classification and IPSS/IPSS-R risk categorization is available and within 2 months 
of screening, results of central review are not required prior to enrollment of the subject in the 
study.  However, the results of central pathology review will be used in classification of subjects 
for analysis.  
A comprehensive blood product transfusion history must be available for at least the 56 days 
immediately preceding and including the day of the first dose of IP.  Transfusion data should 
include the blood product transfused, number of units, reason for transfusion, and date of transfusion.  Platelet transfusion data must in clude the platelet value for which the transfusion 
was deemed necessary and RBC tran sfusion data must include the hemoglobin (Hgb) value for 
which the transfusion was administered, if available.  All transfusion records for 56 days immediately preceding and including the date of enrollment should be collected whenever 
possible.
Screening assessments and procedures are described in Section 6.1.
4.1.2. Safety Run-in
The safety run-in w ill utilize a c onventional 3+3 design to find a tolerable dose for the 
randomized treatment phase. The subjects will be treated with CC-486 first to confirm the 
expected safety profile of CC-486 alone at th e planned dose and schedule in the target 
population. The maximum administered dose ( MAD) of CC-486 will not  exceed 300 mg BID
(21/28 days). The resulting tolerable dose of CC-486 will then be used to combine with 
durvalumab 1500 mg for the combination therapy.

Confidential and Propri etary 39 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019The completion of the CC-486 safety run-in has determined 100 mg BID, 21/28 day regimen 
(dose level -2) as the CC-486 dose to proceed in to the combination therapy safety run-in.
The dose-finding procedure for CC-486 and CC-486+durvalumab will proceed as following.
Part (A) - starting dose for CC-486 as monotherapy :A group of 3 subjects will receive CC-486 
at dose level 0 (200 mg BID ( 21/28 days) and will be closely monitored through at least 2 
treatment cycles for dose- limiting tox icities, as defined in Section 4.1.2.1 .  If for any reason the 
monotherapy safety run-in starting dose needs to be reduced, the starting dose will follow the established levels in Table 1. 
1. If #Subject with DLT = 0/3, the dose will be declared tolerable and used as the starting 
CC-486 dose.
2. If #Subject with DLT = 1/3, recruit another 3 subjects to test the same dose.
a. If #Subject with DLT = 1/6, the dose will be declared tolerable and used as the 
starting CC-486 dose.
b. If #Subject with DLT ≥ 2/6, the dose will be declared intolerable and the next 
lower dose level of CC-486 according to Table 1 will then be explored. Repeat 
the entire procedure with 3 new subjects.
3. If #Subject with DLT ≥ 2/3, the dose will be declared intolerable and the next lower dose 
level of CC-486 according to Table 1 will then be explored. Repeat the entire procedure 
with 3 new subjects.
The safety run-in for CC-486 monotherapy has been completed as of December 2016.
Part (B) - starting dose for CC-486+durvalumab as combination therapy : A group of 3 subjects 
will receive CC-486 dose determined in Part (A) above plus d urvalumab 1500 mg (given by IV 
infusion [over 1 hour ± 5 minutes] on Day 1 of each 28-day treatment cycle) and will be closely 
monitored through at least 2 treatment cycles for dose- limiting toxicities, as defined in
Section 4.1.2.1 .  
1. If #Subject with DLT = 0/3, the dose will be declared tolerable and used as the starting 
CC-486 dose plus durvalumab 1500 mg.
2. If #Subject with DLT = 1/3, recruit another 3 subjects to test the same dose.
a. If #Subject with DLT = 1/6, the dose will be declared tolerable and used as the 
starting CC-486 dose p lus durvalumab 1500 mg.
b. If #Subject with DLT ≥ 2/6, the dose will be declared intolerable and the next 
lower dose level of CC-486 according to Table 1 plus durvalumab 1500 mg will 
be explored. Repeat the entire procedure with 3 new subjects.
3. If #Subject with DLT ≥ 2/3, the dose will be declared intolerable and the next lower dose 
level of CC-486 according to Table 1 plus durvalumab 1500 mg will be explored. Repeat 
the entire procedure with 3 new subjects.

Subjects who discontinue participation in the saf ety run-in phase of the study for reasons not
related to study treatment (eg, rapid disease progression or administrative reasons) before they 
can be assessed for DLT will be replaced for the DLT assessment.
Other than the evaluation of DLTs, procedures and assessments to be performed during the 
safety run-in are similar to those performed for the randomized tr eatment phase of the study (see 
Section 4.1.3 ).
Data from the safety run-in will be reviewed in conjunction with the study investigators, 
Scientific Steering Committee, and Data Monitoring Co mmit tee to ensure  agreement with the 
recommended Phase 2 dosing regimens prior to beginning enrollment to the randomized 
treatment phase.
Once the recommended combination regimen is identified, enrollment into the randomized 
treatment phase of the study may begin.
4.1.2.1. CC-486 Monotherapy Dose-Limiting Toxicity
Dose-limit ing toxicities w ill be evaluated during the DLT evaluation period for the subjects in 
the safety run-in.  For CC-486, the DLT evaluat ion period will be defined as the time from the 
first dose of CC-486 until the planned first dose of IP in Cycle 3. Subjects are considered evaluable for assessment of DLT if they receive ≥ 2 protocol-assigned cycles of CC-486 and 
complete the safety follow-up through the end of the DLT evaluation period, or experience a 
DLT during the DLT evaluatio n period.  Non-evaluable s ubjects will be replaced. 
For CC-486, a DLT will be defined as:
!Grade 5 hematologic events;
!Grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 10 days or accompanied by fever (defined as > 38.5°C 
requiring hospitalization);
!Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding and, 
!Any Grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicity or hematologic toxicity other than anemia or 
cytopenia with the following exceptions:
∀Grade 3 emesis that responds to optimal antiemetic therapy within 72 hours;
∀Grade 3 diarrhea that responds to optimal medical management within 72 hours;

recovers to baseline grade or less within 72 hours;
∀Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities that are not accompanied by clinical signs 
or symptoms and are not believed by the Investigator to be medically significant.
Grade 3 or 4 events clearly and directly related to the primary disease or to another etiology 
documented by the investigator are not considered DLTs.
Table 4 provides guidance for the management of CC-486-related toxicity, including provisions 
for appropriate delay or discontinuation of treatment.
For acute events of neutropenia, thrombocytopeni a, and leucopenia, a ssociated with treatment 
with CC-486, the following formula should be us ed to calculate the minimum neutrophil, 
platelet, or white bl ood cell count that would signify “recove ry” of marrow function and enable 
initiation of the subsequent treatment cycle.
For example, a subject with a pre-treatmen t absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.0 x 109/L
experiences a nadir ANC of 0.4 x 109/L (Grade 4) following one cycle of treatment.  The 
subject’s ANC must recover to at least 0.4 + (1.0-0.4)/2, or 0.7 x 109/L before beginning the 
subsequent treatment cycle.  If the event is judge d by the investigator to be related to study 
treatment and recovery is not achieved with in 14 days of completing Cycle 1, it will be 
considered a dos e-limiti ng toxicity.
4.1.2.2. Durvalumab / CC-486 Combination Therapy Dose-Limiting Toxicity
Dose-limit ing toxicities w ill be evaluated during the DLT evalu ation period for the subjects in 
the safety run-in.  Please refer to Section 4.1.2.1 for CC-486 related dose- limiting tox icity
criteria.
For durvalumab, the DLT evaluation period will be defined as the time from the first dose of 
durvalumab until the planned administration of the third dose of durvalumab. Subjects are 
considered evaluable for assessment of DLT if they receive 2 protocol-assigned doses of 
durvalumab and complete the safety follow-up through the end of the DLT evaluation period, or experience a DLT during the DLT evaluation peri od.  Non-evaluable subjects will be replaced. 
The severity grading of adverse events will be determined according to National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03.
For durvalumab, a DLT will be defined as an y Grade 3 or higher durvalumab-related toxicity

Figure 2 depicts the study design of the randomized treatment phase.
The randomized tr eatment phase of the study will be conducted in 2 stages.  Following 
identification of dose and schedule in the safety run-in of a tr eatment arm, enrollment for Stage 1 
of the treatment phase may begin.  Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of two open 
treatment arms:
!Monotherapy – CC-486 alone, or
!Combination Therapy – CC-486 plus durvalumab
In the event that only one treatment arm for a cohort is open for accrual due to available safety 
and efficacy data, subjects will be assigned to treatment on the open arm.
Subjects with stable disease at the time of enrollment will be included in the stable disease (SD) 
cohort for that treatment arm, and those with progressive disease at th e time of enro llment will 
be included in the progressive disease (PD) cohort (see Section 7.2).  Subjects with MDS that
responded to injectable HMA treatment are not eligible for this study, even if their disease subsequently relapsed.  
Numbers of subjects with PD and SD allocated to each treatment arm will be monitored to 
enable the planned analyses for each sub- population.  Hence there are 4 cohorts being evaluated 
in this study:
!Monotherapy, progressive disease
!Monotherapy, stable disease
!Combination therapy, progressive disease
!Combination therapy, stable disease
Excluded from participation in this clinical trial is the cohort of patients that initially 
demonstrates a positive response to treatment with an injectable HMA, but subsequently 
relapses.  This group is thought to represent an especially difficult-t o-treat sub-population in 
which gaining disease control is unlikely with currently-available or experimental options.  Even among patients not responding to initial HMA therapy, some will experience rapidly-progressing 
disease characterized by dramatic increases in myeloid precursors and blast cells in the marrow 
or blood.
All baseline assessments and procedures should be performed prior to administration of the first 
dose of CC-486 or infus ion of durvalumab.  
The subject should begin treatment on the day of randomization via Inter active Response 
Technology System (IRTS) whenever possible, but the dose may be delayed for up to 5 days if 
necessary for logistical reasons.  Any delay gr eater than 5 days must be discussed with, and 
approved by, the sponsor’s medical monitor and may result in the need to repeat screening.  
Approximately 10-12 evaluable subjects randomized to the combination treatment arm at 
selected centers will participate in PK sampling procedures as described in Sections 4.1.4 and 
6.10.  Subjects in whom Cycle 1 and 2 PK sampling cannot be completed will be replaced for PK 
collection purposes.

Confidential and Propri etary 46 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019A subject’s CC-486 dose and schedule may be adjusted as described in Section 8.2.4 for the 
management of unacceptable toxicity.  All efforts should be made to maintain BID dosing.  A 
QD ‘rescue’ regimen is available if the investigator believes a subject’s ability to tolerate 
treatment is limited by twice-daily dosing (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who cannot tolerate a reduced 
dose and schedule of 100 mg BID (or 200 mg QD), 14/28 days, will discontinue the treatment 
phase of the study and enter the follow-up phase.  
Interruption or delay of treatment with CC-486 for up to 42 days is permitted as outlined in 
Section 8.2.4.1 to enable recovery from IP-related toxicity.  If there is a delay of more than 42 
days (6 weeks) in the start of the next cycle, the medical monitor must be consulted.  When the 
start of a new treatment cycle with CC-486 is de layed for any reason, the infusion of durvalumab
will also be delayed (in subjects randomized to the combination treatment arm), such that 
durvalumab continues to be administered on Day 1 of each treatment cycle.  Study treatment 
should be discontinued if there is a delay of more  than 56 days (8 weeks) in the start of the next 
cycle, unless, in the opinion of the investigator and the medical monitor, the subject is 
experiencing clinical benefit.
For toxicity that is thought to be rel ated to treatment with durvalumab, including immune-
mediated AEs (imAEs) or infusion-type r eactions, as well as for non-immune mediated 
reactions, the infusion of durvalumab may be slowed or interrupted, or a dose may be withheld, 
as described in Section 8.2.4.2 .  Dose reduction of durvalumab is not permitted.
In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, subjects who show signs of worsening disease (clinical
or hematological), who remain in stable disease, or do not experience modified IWG 2006 
hematologic improvement (HI) or better (PR, CR or marrow CR – modified IWG 2006, Appendix F ) after 2 well-tolerated cycles,  may have their dose increased at the discretion of the 
investigator and in discussion with the medical monitor as described in Section 6.5andTable 3 . 
Again, dose and schedule may be adjusted as described in Section 8.2.4 in order to manage 
toxicity.  
Visits during the randomized treatment phase are scheduled weekly for the first 2 treatment 
cycles, every 2 weeks for the next 10 cycles and monthly once a subject has completed 12 cycles.
During treatment, subjects will be assessed continuously for safety and efficacy.  Assessments 
and procedures include:
!AEs including AESI
!physical examination
!vital signs
!ECG (screening and treatment 
discontinuation visit only)
!body weight measurement

may be discontinued from treatment at the investigator’s discretion prior to reaching the recommended minimum number of cycles for any of the reasons detailed in Section 12.
Subjects’ general disease status will be assessed based on available clinical and laboratory data at 
the end of Cycle 6, prior to starting Cycle 7.
Subjects who satisfy any one of the following criteria may continue on to Cycle 7 and beyond.  
The disease status of these subjects will be assessed at the beginning of every new cycle based

!Objective response to treatment:  CR, marrow CR (mCR), PR, or HI ( Appendix F ), or
!RBC-transfusion-independence, or
!≥ 50% reduction in average RBC transfusion requirement in the 56-day (8-week) 
period immediately prior to disease status assessment as compared to the average baseline RBC transfusion requirement, or
!any other clinical benefit, including no evidence of progressive disease (see Table 8
for definitions of progressive disease).
Thereafter, a subject may be discontinued from tr eatment with IP for any of the reasons detailed 
in Section 12.
Subjects who fail to meet these criteria at the end of Cycle 6 will discontinue IP at that time and 
enter the follow-up phase of the study.
In the event that a subject assigned to the combination treatment arm discontinues treatment with 
durvalumab or CC-486 because of drug-related toxicity, tr eatment with CC-486 or durvalumab
monotherapy may continue until any discontinuation criterion is met (see Section 12).

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 48 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019Prior to discontinuing treatment for a subject, it is recommended that the investigator contact the 
medical monitor and forward appropriate supporting documents for review and discussion.  The 
decision to discontinue a subject remains the re sponsibility of the treating physician and will not 
be delayed or refused by the sponsor.
All subjects who have received at least one dose of IP will undergo treatment discontinuation 
procedures (Section 6.13) when treatment with IP is discontinued.  If a subject is discontinued 
during a regularly-scheduled visit, that visit will be considered the treatment discontinuation visit and all treatment discontinuation procedures should be completed.  If a procedure had been 
performed within 7 days of the treatment discontinuation visit, it does not need to be repeated.
For all enrolled/randomized subjects, the reason for discontinuing treatment w ill be rec orded in 
the case report form (CRF) and in the source document, regardless of whether or not a dose of IP 
was ever administered.
During the randomized treatment phase of the study, approximately 32 subjects with PD and 32 
subjects with SD will be randomized ev enly to receive either CC- 486 alone, or CC-486 + 
durvalumab.  There will be 4 cohorts (16 subjects in each) in Stage 1: SD treated with 
monotherapy, PD treated with monotherapy, SD treated with combination therapy and PD treated with combination therapy. If there are 2 or fewer responses in any cohort during Stage 1, 
enrollment to that arm will be terminated.  Otherwise, the cohort will continue to Stage 2 and 
accrue an additional 25 subjects each.  If 8 or more responses are observed in these 41 subjects, the null hypothesis will be rejected for that cohort.
Therefore, the total number of subjects for the randomized treatment phase will range from 
approximately 64 (at Stage 1) to 164 (Stage 1 plus Stage 2) for the 4 cohorts. More subjects can potentially be recruited for replacement of  non-evaluable subjects, if needed (see Figure 2 ).
A subject is considered evaluable for response once they have received one cycle of treatment 
with a maximum of 6 cycles of treatment, or have  discontinued from the treatment phase for any 
reason.  A subject who discontinues from the treatment phase for any reason not related to IP 
toxicity (eg, disease progression or administrative r easons) before the first post-baseline efficacy 
assessment (following treatment Cycle 2) will be replaced and an additional subject will be 
included in that cohort (PD or SD cohort).  This will ensure a valid statistical assessment in both 
the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, and, if different, the modified ITT (mITT) population
(Section 10.2), excluding those who discontinue study treatment early because of the rapid 
progression of their disease, or leave the study for non-study-related reasons prior to this first 
post-baseline efficacy assessment.
The sponsor, in consultation with the Scientific Steering Committee and Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee, will continue to evaluate each  subject’s response to treatment based on 
modified IWG 2006 criteria ( Appendix F ) until the required number of responses is observed for 
a given cohort to proceed to Stage 2, or when th e last active subject in Stage 1 of any cohort 
(monotherapy or combination therapy; PD or SD) reaches the disease status assessment 
following treatment Cycle 6.  At that point a final determination can be made regarding the 
progression of that cohort to Stage 2.
In addition to evaluating responses to treatmen t based on objective criteria, the sponsor, in 
consultation with the Scientific Steeri ng Committee and Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee, w ill also evalu ate the quality of each objective response.  Quality of response will be

Confidential and Propri etary 49 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019assessed based on the magnitude of hematologic and biologic responses observed in individual 
subjects, with special consideration for response duration.  The sponsor may decide to 
discontinue accrual to one or both cohorts despite observing the required number of objective 
responses if the responses are not thought to be clinically relevant. For example, if a sufficient quantity of responses is observed, but all responses are transient hematologic improvements that 
are not thought to convey a meaningful benefit for the subject, the sponsor may choose to not 
continue enrollment to that cohort in Stage 2.  Specific details for what constitutes a quality 
response will be provided in the final Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
4.1.4. Pharmacokinetics Sub-study
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic an alysis will be collected from approximately 10-12 
evaluable subjects randomized to the combination treatment arm at selected sites.  This will 
enable assessment of drug-drug interactions.  Subjects participating in PK procedures will agree 
to have blood samples collected as described in Section 6.10.
All subjects receiving durvalumab will have blood samples collected for assessment of 
immunogenicity: development of anti-durvalumab antibodies.  
 
.
4.1.5. Follow-up Phase
4.1.5.1. Follow-up in Subjects Receiving CC-486 Monotherapy
All subjects who receive at least one dose of CC-486 in the safety run-in or randomized 
treatment phase and discontinue treatment for any reason will be followed for at least 28 days after their last dose of CC-486 for the assessment of safety-related parameters (see Section 6.14).  
After the 28-day period, only SAEs made known to the investigator that are suspected of being 
related to treatment with CC-486 need to be reported.
A 28-day follow-up visit will be conducted 28 (±3) days following the last dose of CC-486 or 
during the final treatment phase study visit (whichever date is later) for assessment of the 
following safety-related parameters (see Section 6.14).

Females of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant for 90 days after the last dose 
of IP and male subjects should avoid fathering a child for 90 days after the last dose of IP.
4.1.5.2. Follow-up in Subjects Receiving Durvalumab / CC-486 Combination Therapy
All subjects who receive at least one dose of durvalumab in the safety run-in or randomized 
treatment phase and discontinue treatment for any reason w ill be followed for at least 90 days 
after their last infusion of durvalumab for the assessment of safety-related parameters (see 
Section 6.14).  After the 28-day period for CC-486 and the 90-day period for durvalumab, only
SAEs made known to the investigator that are suspected of being related to study treatment need 
to be reported.
Subjects are to return to the study site 28 (±3) days after the End of Trial (EOT) visit and 90 (±3) 
days after the last dose of durvalumab for assess ment of the following safety-related parameters:
!Survival, 
!AEs including AESI (monitored until 28 days after last dose of CC-486 and 90 days

4.1.6. Extension Phase
The Extension Phase (EP) allows subjects who are receiving oral azacitidine and demonstrating 
clinical benefit as assessed by the Investigator, to continue to receive oral azacitidine until they 
meet the criteria for study tr eatment discontinu ation.
Subjects will remain at the same dose levels from the main study during the Extension Phase and 
may decrease dose levels following dose modifications (Section 8.2.4 ); however, dose levels 
will not increase. Any potential dose escalation w ill be considered a treatment failure and the 
subject should be discontinued.
Survival will not be followed in the Extension Phase.
Details for the EP are provided in Appendix J .
4.1.7. Study Closure
The study will conclude once all subjects have completed or discontinued from the Extension 
Phase.
The study is expected to close when the last subject completes approximately 12 months of 
treatment and/or follow-up, unless additional follow-up is needed to analyze time-to-event
endpoints.  At the investigator’s discretion, upon completion of the study, subjects who continue 
to benefit from treatment with CC-486 and/or durvalumab, without unacceptable toxicities and
who have not met criteria for treatment withdrawal may continue to receive CC-486 and 
durvalumab provided by the sponsor through this protocol or through an open-label ‘rollover’ 
study.
Celgene reserves the right to terminate this study at any t ime for reasonable med ical or 
administrative reasons. Any premature disc ontinuation will be appropriately documented 
according to local requirements (eg, IRB/EC, regulatory authorities, etc.).
In addition, the investigator or Celgene has the right to discontinue a single site at any time 
during the study for medical or administrative reasons such as:
!Unsatisfactory enrollment;
!GCP noncompliance;
!Inaccurate or incomplete data collection;
!Falsification of records;
!Failure to adhere to the study protocol.

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 53 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 20194.2. Study Design Rationale
This is a Phase 2, international, multic enter, randomized, parallel group, open-label study 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safe ty of treatment with CC-486 (an orally-available 
cytidine analog) alone and in combination wi th durvalumab (a m onoclonal antibody  targeting the 
Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 [PD-L1]) in subjects with myelodysplastic syndromes when an objective response is not achieved through treatment with an injectable hypomethylating agent 
(iHMA). The randomized study design reduces bias in subject selection by treatment group, and 
enables a valid comparison of efficacy and safety between treatment groups.  This will allow for selection of the appropriate treatment group for further evaluation in the post-iHMA setting.
The study population represents  the group of patients with MDS that have exhausted available
HMA tr eatment options.  No additional medical intervent ion is currently approved in this setting 
and prognosis for members of this population is dismal.  
The study will evaluate the two treatment regimens in two subsets of subjects who fail to respond 
to iHMA treatment: those with stable disease (with no hematologic response or improvement) 
associated with the i HMA, and those with disease progression during or following iHMA 
treatment.  The study excludes subjects who respond to injectable therapy but subsequently 
relapse, because this group is thought to repre sent an especially hard-to-treat segment of the 
population wher e additional disease control is generally unlikely with this, or other, experimental 
agents.  The SD and PD sub-populations will be analyzed se parately for the monotherapy and 
combination therapy treatment arms.
A safety run-in phase of the study will explore the safety and toler ability of CC-486 alone and in 
combination with durvalumab to confirm that there are no overlapping or synergistic tox icities 
limiting the ability of the two drugs to be delivered in combination, and to determine the init ial 
dose and schedule to be applied for the randomized portion of the study.  Once a recommended
dose and schedule for the combination has been identified as described in Section 4.1.2 , 
enrollment into the randomized tr eatment phase may begin.
All cohorts will be evaluated using a Simon’s 2-stage design (Section 10.3).  This approach will 
enable safety and efficacy to be formally evaluated following enrollment of Stage 1 for each 
cohort.  In this way, the sponsor can determine if exposure of additional subjects to CC-486alone or in combination with durvalumab is warranted based on the accumulating data from 
subjects enrolled in Stage 1.  Approximately 64 eval uable subjects will be enrolled in the first 
stage of the randomized tr eatment phase.  If suffici ent objective responses are observed in one or 
more cohorts (SD monotherapy, PD monotherapy, SD combination therapy, PD combination 
therapy), the applicable cohort(s) w ill be expanded in the sec ond stage of study to include up to 
approximately 25 additional subjects per cohort (see Section 4.1, Section 10.3, and Figure 2 ).
In addition to evaluating responses to treatment based on objective criteria, the sponsor, together 
with the study’s Scientific Steering Committee and Independent Data Monitoring Committee 
will also evaluate the quality of each objective response.  Quality of response will be assessed 
based on the magnitude of hematologic and biologic responses observed in individual subjects, 
with special consideration for response duration.  The sponsor may decide to discontinue accrual 
to one or more cohorts despite observing the re quired number of objective responses if the 
responses are not thought to be clinically relevant.  For example, if a sufficient quantity of 
responses is observed, but all responses are transient hematologic improvements that are not

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 54 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019thought to convey a meaningful benefit for the subject, the sponsor may choose not to continue 
enrollment to that cohort in Stage 2.
The first dose and schedule for CC-486 to be tested in the safety run-in phase is 200 mg BID for 
the first 21 days of each 28-day tr eatment cycle. This dose and schedule has demonstrated 
reasonable tolerability in a prior study ( Garcia-Manero, 2009 ; Garcia-Manero, 2010 ) and BID 
dosing is hypothesized to contribute to anti-tum or activity by affecting more malignant cells in 
S-phase throughout the treatment cycle compared to a once d aily or injectable regimen.  
Durvalumab will be administered on Day 1 of each 28-day treatment cycle as a single 1500 mg 
IV infusion, as described in Section 8.2.2.2 .
Subjects should continue to receive IP for at l east 6 cycles of treatment before considering 
treatment discontinuation for lack of clinical activity because, based on prior studies with 
parenteral azacitidine therapy, response to tr eatment may be delayed to allow for adequate cell 
line recovery without dose reduction ( Silverman, 2006 ).  While on treatment, subjects will 
continue to receive best supportive care, thus the requested 6-month minimum treatment period 
does not represent an undue risk to subjects.  In addition, because overall survival is one of the 
endpoints, the effect of ex tended therapy is being evaluated; suspension of therapy at an early 
time point may blunt any po ssible clinical benefit.  
Analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted only after all active subjects have comp leted 
the modified IWG response assessment following a maximum of 6 cycles of therapy.  
Best supportive care provided to all study subjects is to include RBC (pRBC and whole blood) 
and platelet transfusions (single donor or pooled donor), antibiotic, antiviral and antifungal 
therapy, and nutritional support as needed.  Gr anulocyte colony-stimulating factors are allowed 
only for subjects experiencing neutropenic fever/infection as well as for secondary prophylaxis 
under certain conditions (see Section 9.1).  
Best supportive care for this study excludes the use of ESAs and other hematopoietic growth 
factors as these therapies are not approved for the treatment of MDS and do not increase platelet 
counts in patients with concomitant thrombocytopenia associated with MDS.  Furthermore, 
ESAs are less effective for RBC transfusion-dependent anemia than for RBC transfusion-independent anemia ( Hellstrom-Lindberg, 2003 ).  Thus the best supportive care for this study 
should minimize the risk of not providing subjects with appropriate care, while providing the 
potential benefit of achieving additional diseas e control that was previously not achievable.  
Further consideration for excluding the use of ESAs from best supportive care is the theoretical 
possibility that the combination of ESA with azacit idine may have an additive effect on response
and this could confound the evaluation of e fficacy associated with CC-486 itself. Thus
excluding the use of ESAs from best supportive care would mitigate any possible bias in data 
interpretation, and allow accurate assessment of study endpoints.
4.3. Study Duration 
The enrollment period for this study is expected to last approximately 39 months.  The treatment 
and follow-up phases of study are expected to conclude approximately 12 months after the last 
subject is e nrolled. The Extension Phase is exp ected to last approximately 24 months. Therefore, 
the total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 75 months.

a.One cycle (28 days or 4 weeks) is considered one month.  The acceptable study visit window in the treatment phase is ±3 days fo r Cycles 1 and 2, and; ±7 days for Cycle 3 
and beyond, unless otherwise noted for a particular assessment.  Study visits should also take into account the subject’s IP su pply.  Only 1 cycle of IP will be dispensed to the 
subject on Day 1 of each cycle.  Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond may be delayed from Day 28 of the prior cycle in order for subjec ts to recover from toxicity and meet criteria 
for re-treatment (see Section 8.2.5 ).
b.The study visit window for the 28-day Follow-up Visit is ±3 days.  If the visit is conducted prior to post-treatment Day 28, the subject should be contacted on or after post-
treatment Day 28 to obtain any new or updated information related to survival, AEs, concomitant medications, blood product tran sfusions, additional MDS therapies, and/or 
disease progression to AML.  Additional follow-up contacts may be conducted by telephone and are performed every 3 months (12 wee ks ± 14 days) from the date of the 28-
day follow-up visit (90 days for durvalumab) until the last active subject reaches approximately 12 months of treatment, or unt il death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of 
consent to further contact or study closure (Section 6.14 ).
c.The first dose of IP in Cycle 1 should be administered on the day of entering the subject in the treatment phase via IRTS, but may be administered up to 5 days later if 
necessary for logistical reasons (see Section 6.3).  Physical examination, ECOG performance status, hematology and/or serum chemistry do not need to be repeated if the 
screening examination was performed within 7 days of the first dose and all necessary parameters were assessed.  Pregnancy test  does not need to be repeated if the screening 
assessment was performed within 72 hours of the first dose of IP.
d.All subjects who received at least one dose of IP should complete the Treatment Discontinuation Visit when the decision to disc ontinue IP is made. If this is during a 
regularly-scheduled study visit, that visit will be considered the Treatment Discontinuation Visit, and all indicated procedure s performed.  The reason for discontinuation will 
be recorded in the CRF and in the source document for all enrolled subjects, even if they never received IP.  Reasons for disco ntinuation are provided in Section 12.
e.Documentation supporting MDS diagnosis (WHO and FAB classifications - Appendix A and Appendix B ), and IPSS/IPSS-R risk classification ( Appendix C and   Appendix 
D) will be collected during screening.  If documentation of MDS diagnosis, WHO/FAB classification and IPSS/IPSS-R risk categoriz ation is available and within 2 months 
of screening, results of central review are not required prior to enrollment of the subject in the study.  However, the results of central pathology review will be used in 
classification of subjects for analysis. These assessments will be independently-confirmed through central review of screening b one marrow biopsy, aspirate, and peripheral 
blood samples, along with applicable central laboratory results and relevant clinical documentation.  Thus, bone marrow aspirate  and biopsy samples, together with peripheral 
blood samples and clinical documentation, must be  collected during screening, as detailed in Section 6.1.15 .  Blood samples at screening should be collected on the same day 
as the bone marrow procedure.  Instructions for submission of bone marrow slides and sample collection, processing, storage, an d shipment procedures are provided in the 
Central Laboratory Manual.
f.A comprehensive red blood cell and platelet transfusion history must be available for the 56 days immediately preceding the subj ect’s first dose of IP and will be recorded on 
the appropriate CRF.
g.All prior treatments for MDS, regardless of discontinuation date of treatment, must be recorded as detailed in Section 6.1.4 .

Confidential and Propri etary 60 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019h.All non-MDS medications taken in the 4 weeks (28 days) prior to initiation of IP are to be collected on the appropriate CRF.
i.Vital signs include measurements of blood pressure, pulse, body temperature and respiratory rate as detailed in Section 6.1.7 .
j.12-lead electrocardiogram will be performed locally at screening and upon treatment discontinuation, and if clinically indicate d. The investigator will review and assess the 
results as detailed in Section 6.1.9 .
k.Urinalysis is conducted at the central laboratory.  Urine samples should be collected during screening, prior to administration o f IP on Day 1 of every 3rdtreatment cycle (ie, 
Cycle 3, 6, 9, etc.), and as indicated in the table above  (see also Section 6.1.10 ).  
l.Serum EPO, ferritin, and transferrin saturation (Fe/TIBC) assessments are to be performed by the central laboratory.  It is not necessary to obtain these values if they were 
assessed within 2 months prior to screening (date of informed consent signature) and values are documented in the subject’s med ical record.
m.Hematology includes a complete blood count with WBC differential and platelets as detailed in Section 6.1.12 .  Any or all laboratory assessments may be repeated more 
frequently if clinically indicated.  All samples will be analyzed by the central laboratory.  The samples are to be collected at  screening, prior to IP administration as detailed in 
Section 6, and at the treatment discontinuation and 28-day follow-up visits.
n.Serum chemistry (to include amylase and lipase) and thyroid function parameters are detailed in Section 6.1.13 .  All samples will be analyzed by the central laboratory.  Any 
or all laboratory assessments may be repeated more frequently if clinically indicated.  The samples are to be collected at scre ening, prior to IP administration as detailed in 
Section 6.7.7 , and at the treatment discontinuation and 28-day follow-up visits.
o.A serum pregnancy test is to be completed during screening for all FCBP.  A serum or urine pregnancy test (investigator’s discre tion) is to be performed within 72 hours 
before beginning treatment on Day 1 of every cycle in the treatment phase, at the treatment discontinuation visit and safety follo w-up (Section 6.1.14 ).  The subject may not 
receive IP until the investigator has verified that the result of the pregnancy test is negative. Pregnancy testing does not ne ed to be repeated prior to Cycle 1 if the screening 
assessment was performed within 72 hours of the first dose of IP. 
p.Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples are required prior to beginning IP and following every 2 cycles of treatment during the first 6 treatment cycles (ie, Cycle Day 28 
[± 14 days]).  Subjects who continue beyond Cycle 6 will undergo bone marrow examination following every 3 treatment cycles or when necessary to confirm suspected 
hematologic response or disease progression, and again upon treatment discontinuation (See Sections 6.1.15 ,a n d 6.8.1 for detail).  Samples will be sent for cytogenetic 
analysis each time a bone marrow sample is collected.  Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate are required during screening.  Thereafter , only aspiration is necessary unless 
adequate aspirate cannot be obtained.  Reports from all bone marrow and cytogenetics analyses performed from the time of MDS di agnosis should be obtained and submitted 
to the sponsor during screening whenever possi ble.  “Unscheduled” sample collections are also permitted if a subject has disease  progression. 
q.Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected from approximately 10-12 evaluable subjects randomized to the combination treatment arm at selected study sites.  Instructions for 
IP dosing and PK sample collection time points are provided in Section 6.10.
r.IP should only be dispensed on Day 1 of each treatment cycle after all Day 1 procedures have been completed and all IP from the previous cycle is accounted for (where 
applicable).  Only 1 cycle of IP will be dispensed to the subject on Day 1 of each cycle (Section 8.2.1 ).  For FCBP subjects, a negative pregnancy test performed within 
72 hours prior to IP administration must be documented.
s.CC-486 is scheduled to be  taken on Day 1 to Day 21 of each cycle (Day -1 of Cycle 1 for PK sub-study subjects), unless there has  been a dose or schedule modification due 
to toxicity.  Subjects will self-administer CC-486 (Section 8.2.2 ).  It is recommended that an antiemetic medication (eg, ondansetron) be taken 30 minutes prior to CC-486 
administration during Cycle 1.  If nausea/vomiting is not significant, further antiemetic prophylaxis may not be needed.  
t.IP accountability is not applicable on Day 1 of Cycle 1.
u.The type of blood product transfused, number of units, reason for transfusion, and date of transfusion is to be collected begin ning on C1D1, until 90 days after the last dose of 
IP or until the last study visit, whichever occurs later (see Section 6.8.6 ).
v.International Working Group Response Assessment based on modified IWG criteria ( Appendix F ) is to be performed following every 2 cycles of treatment during the first 6
treatment cycles.  Subjects who c ontinue beyond Cycle 6 will have IWG response assessment following every 3 treatment cycles.  The assessment must be performed prior to 
beginning Day 1 procedures for the subsequent treatment cycle (Cycle 3, 5, 7, 10, etc.).  See Section 6.8.3 .
w.An assessment of disease status must be performed at the end of Cycle 6, prior to starting Cycle 7, based on available clinical and laboratory evaluations.  
!Subjects who meet re-treatment criteria (Section 8.2.5 ) can continue on to Cycle 7 and beyond and disease status will be re-assessed prior to beginning each new cycle of IP.
!Subjects who fail to meet re-treatment criteria at the end of Cycle 6 will be discontinued from protocol-prescribed therapy and enter the follow-up phase (Section 6.14 ).

All required study visits are described in Table 2 with an “X” indicating the procedures to be 
performed during a particular visit.  All data obtain ed from these assessments must be present in 
the subject’s source documentation.  Unless otherwise noted, acceptable study visit windows are 
as follows:  routine assessments of Cycles 1 and 2 must be performed ± 3 days of the targeted day indicated in the table; all routine assessments of Cycles 3 and beyond must be performed ± 7 
days of the targeted day; post-treatment follow- up contacts must be performed within ± 14 days 
of the targeted day of contact.  Procedures are described in detail below.
6.1. Screening
All screening procedures and assessments are performed during a subject’s screening period in 
order to establish eligibility and to document relevant medical and demographic data (eg, 
medical history and prior/concomitant medications ).  Written informed consent must be obtained 
before any study-specific procedures are performed and any samples are collected for study-
specific analysis.  Per inclusion criterion number 5, there may not be more than 16 weeks 
between a subject’s last dose of injectable HMA and the date of their informed consent signature.  Also, there may not be less than 3 weeks between the subject’s last dose of injectable HMA and 
the planned first dose of IP in this study (inclusion criterion number 6).  Given this timeframe, 
subjects may begin screening after the last dose of prior injectable HMA. 
Subject eligibility is established by the investigator by confirming all inclusion and exclusion 
criteria are satisfied.  Docume ntation used  to establish eligibility should be forwarded to the 
sponsor to ensure documentation is sufficient from a regulatory and quality perspective.  The sponsor may contact the study site for additional information if there is any deficiency in the 
documentation provided.  Failure to satisfy any entry criterion will preclude a subject from 
enrolment into the safety run-in or tr eatment phase of the study.  Unless otherwise specified, 
screening assessments must take place, and eligible subjects enrolled in the study within 28 days 
after the date of informed consent signature.  Refer to Section 6.2for information to be collected 
for screen failures: screened subjects who do not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria during 
screening, or who are not enrolled in the treatment phase for any reason.
A subject who becomes a screen failure can be rescreened if it is reasonable to believe they will 
meet eligibility criteria during rescreening. Please note that if a subject is to be rescreened, they must reconsent to participation in the study by signing a new and current Informed Consent 
Document and the date of signature must again be within 16 weeks of the last dose of injectable 
HMA.
6.1.1. MDS Diagnosis, WHO and FAB Classifications and IPSS(-R) Risk Classification
MDS diagnosis, WHO classification ( Appendix A ), FAB classification ( Appendix B ), IPSS risk 
classification ( Appendix C ), and IPSS-R risk classification ( Appendix D ) will be established 
through documentation collected during screening.  
!Morphological assessment: Pathology reports from each bone marrow examination 
(screening biopsy and/or aspirate) performed  from the time of MDS diagnosis should 
be obtained and submitted to the sponsor for review whenever possible.  Inability to

(without HI) as the best response to treatment with an injectable hypomethylating 
agent may preclude the subject from entering the study. 
!Cytogenetics:  Reports from any cytogenetics analyses performed from the time of 
MDS diagnosis should be obtained and sub mitted to the sponsor for review whenever 
possible.  
!Hematology:  Reports from any h ematologic an alyses from the time of MDS 
diagnoses that are relevant to establishing the subject’s eligibility or baseline disease state (PD vs. SD) should be obtained and submitted to the sponsor for review 
whenever possible.  
All hematology and bone marrow pathology report s used to establish a subject’s eligibility 
should be sent for sponsor review at least 48 hours ahead of the planned IP start date to allow 
time for any deficiencies in documentation to be addressed.  This includes documentation of the 
subject’s prior treatment with an adequate course of injectable HMA and prior blood product transfusion records (see Sections 6.1.3 and 6.1.4 ).  A checklist will be provided to the site to 
assist in compiling all necessa ry documentation during screening.
Note:  Any time subject-specific documentation is sent to the sponsor, all subject-
identifying information must be redacted, and the subject’s study-specific ID number 
added to the document. 
6.1.2. Demographics and Medical History
The subject’s date of birth, sex, race and ethn icity will be recorded on the appropriate CRF, as 
permitted by local regulations.  Relevant medical history and current medical conditions, 
including those symptoms related to MDS (eg, anemia), must be recorded on the appropriate CRF at screening.  
6.1.3. RBC and Platelet Transfusion History
Documentation of all red blood cell and platelet tran sfusions received by the subject within 8 
weeks (56 days) prior to the first dose of IP should be gathered during the screening period, if 
possible, and recorded on the appropriate CRF.  Transfusion data should include the type of 
transfusion, number of units, reason for, and date of transfusion.  RBC transfusion data should 
include the hemoglobin concentration prior to tr ansfusion and platelet transfusion data should 
include the pre-transfusion platelet value.  It is  important that all transfusions received by the 
subject during the 56 days leading to the first dose of IP are known and recorded, even when not all requested data are available.
6.1.4. Prior Medications and MDS Treatments
All prior and current med ications, in cluding, prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal 
preparations taken for any indication within the 4 weeks (28 days) prior to the first dose of IP 
will be recorded on the appropriate CRF.
All prior treatments for MDS will be recorded on th e respective CRF(s) regardless of dates of 
treatment.

Confidential and Propri etary 64 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019Documentation of the subject’s prior treatment wi th an adequate course of injectable HMA (see 
inclusion criterion number 3) should be sent to the sponsor at least 48 hours ahead of the planned 
date of first dose to allow time for sponsor review prior to initiating IP.  Failure to clearly 
establish refractory disease (no objective response of HI or better) during or following an 
adequate course of injectable HMA will preclude the subject from being enrolled into the study.
Per inclusion criterion number 5, the last dose of injectable HMA must have been within 16
weeks prior to the subject’s informed consent signature date in order to be considered for this study. Also, there may not be less than 3 weeks between the subject’s last dose of injectable 
HMA and the planned first dose of IP in this study (inclusion criterion number 6).
6.1.5. Coagulation Parameters
Coagulation parameters, including prothrombin time/international norm alized ratio (PT/INR), 
activated partial thromboplas tin time (aPTT), and fibrinogen will be recorded during screening.  
Re-testing of coagulation parameters throughout the study is only necessary if clinically indicated. 
6.1.6. Physical Examination
Information about th e screening physical examination must be present in the subject’s source 
documentation.  Significant findings w ill be recorded on the appropriate CRF.
6.1.7. Vital Signs, Body Weight and Height Measurements
The following routine assessments must be present in the subject’s source documentation and 
recorded on the appropriate CRF: 
!blood pressure
!pulse
!body temperature
!respiratory rate 
!body weight
Height is collected during screening only.
6.1.8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status
Performance status at screening will be assessed using ECOG criteria provided in Appendix E .  
Refer to Section 6.7.10 for timing of ECOG performance status assessments during the study.
6.1.9. Electrocardiogram
Electrocardiograms (ECGs) at screening and at treatment discontinuation are conducted locally.  
Electrocardiograms shoul d be performed using the internationally recognized 12- leads.  The 
investigator will review the results and assess as normal, abnormal - not clinically significant, or 
abnormal - clinically significant, and report abnormal finding(s) on the appropriate CRF.  If the 
ECG is abnormal, the investigator should consult a cardiologist as appropriate.  For purposes of

unless additional monitoring is deemed  necessary by the investigator.
6.1.10. Urinalysis
During screening, a urine sample will be sent for analysis by the central laboratory.  Urinalysis 
includes examination by a standard stick test for specific gravity, glucose, ketones, blood, pH, 
and protein, and microscopic analysis if indicated.  A urine sample should be collected prior to 
IP administration on Day 1 of every 3rdtreatment cy cle (ie, Cycles 3, 6, 9, etc.), at treatment

requirements for urine sample co llection, handli ng, and shipping are provided in the Central 
Laboratory Manual.
6.1.11. Serum EPO, Ferritin, and Transferrin Saturation (Fe/TIBC)
Serum erythropoietin (EPO), fe rritin, and serum iron/serum total iron-binding capacity
(Fe/TIBC) are assessed by the central laboratory during screening to rule-out confounding 
conditions associated with anemia.  It is not nece ssary to perform these tests if these parameters 
were assessed within 2 months prior to screening (date of informed consent signature) and values are documented in the subject’s medical record.
6.1.12. Hematology
Blood samples for hematology assessment will be  sent for analysis by the central laboratory.  
Any or all laboratory assessments may be repeated more frequently if clinically indicated.  Refer 
to Section 6.7.7 for timing of required hematology assessments during the safety run-in or

6.1.14. Pregnancy Testing (FCBP Only)
This protocol defines a FCBP as a sexually mature woman who:  
1. has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or 2. has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had 
menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).  
Amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential.The investigator will appraise a female subject as a FCBP according to this definition.  
Justification must be recorded in the CRF and th e source document.  Pregnancy testing is not 
required for non-FCBP subjects.  
A medically supervised serum pregnancy test with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL is to be 
administered and assessed locally during screening for any FCBP.  A negative result must be 
verified by the investigator prior to administration of IP.  Refer to Section 6.7.8 for details

inclusion criterion numbers 8and 9for contraception requirements of the protocol.
6.1.15. Bone Marrow Aspirate, Biopsy, and Peripheral Blood Smear
A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are to be  obtained during screening.  Whenever a bone 
marrow sample is collected, a peripheral blood smear is to be prepared as well. Bone marrow 
and peripheral blood samples are then required following every 2 cycles of treatment during the 
first 6 treatment cycles (ie, Cycle Day 28 [± 14 days]).  Subjects who continue beyond Cycle 6 will undergo bone marrow examination following every 3 treatment cycles or when necessary to 
confirm suspected hematologic response or disease progression, and again upon treatment 
discontinuation.  Samples will be sent for cytogenetic analysis each time a bone marrow sample is collected.  Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate are required during screening.  Thereafter, only 
aspiration is necessary unless adequate aspirate cannot be obtained.  
Samples will be processed as described in th e Central Laboratory Manual and submitted for 
central review along with any pertinent clinical information.  If documentation of MDS 
diagnosis, WHO/FAB classification and IPSS/IPSS -R risk categorization is available within 2
months of screening, results of central review  are not required prior to enrollment of the subject 
in the study.  
Instructions for submission of blood and bone marrow slides/samples, along with relevant 
clinical information, for central review are provided in the Central Laboratory Manual.  Samples and documentation should be prepared and sent to the central reviewer as early in the screening 
process as possible, and not more than 3 weeks after the subject signs informed consent; this will 
enable resolution of any issues prior to the sub ject being enrolled into the study.  Therefore, the 
informed consent process and screening procedures (including bone marrow collection) should 
be planned with careful consideration for the 28-day screening period to avoid any potential need 
for re-screening due to exceeding the 28-day limit.  Special handling requests such as return of materials to the site will be managed on an individual basis.
6.1.16. Cytogenetics
Bone marrow cytogenetic testing will be comp leted by the central laboratory whenever a bone 
marrow aspirate (or biopsy) is obtained.  Note that specific handling of the sample is required in 
order to be used for cytogenetics testing.  See the Central Laboratory Manual for handling instructions.
6.2. Information to be Collected on Screen Failures
The following must be collected for all subjects who provide informed consent, but fail to satisfy inclusion criteria, or for any other reason, are not  enrolled in the treatment phase of the study:
!informed consent date;
!date of biomarker sample collection;
!date of any request for biomarker sample destruction received from a subject;

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 68 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019!investigator’s signature 
Any adverse events experienced by a screen failure subject will be collected from the date of 
signing informed consent to the day the subject is declared a screen failure.  This information 
will be captured in the subject’s source documents and appropriate CRF(s).  Relevant 
information will also be recorded on a Screening Log.  Subjects can be re-screened following discussion with the medical monitor.  
6.3. Entering a Subject Into the Study (Enrollment)
Written consent must be obtained prior to any study-specific procedures being conducted.  All the screening evaluations must be completed and eligibility criteria must be verified by the responsible investigator and appropriate documentation reviewed by the sponsor prior to 
enrolling a subject. Enrollment will occur v ia IRTS to enable automated tracking and 
replenishment of IP.  Specific contact information and instructions will be provided to each study site.
The IRTS enrollment call should be performed as close as possible to the planned first dose of IP 
to avoid enrolling a subject who ultimately does not receive IP for any reason.
The first dose of IP should be administered at the site on the day of enrollment whenever 
possible, but may be delayed for up to 5 days if necessary for logistical reasons.  Any delay 
greater than 5 days must be discussed with and approved by the sponsor’s medical monitor, and 
may result in the need to repeat screening.
Subjects enrolled in the safety run-in phase of th e study will be assigned to the monotherapy arm 
or the combination therapy arm.  Subjects enrolled in the treatment phase of the study will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms, while controlling for the numbers of 
subjects with PD and SD required in each arm for the planned analysis.
Approximately 10-12 evaluable subjects randomized to the combination treatment arm at 
selected sites will participate in PK sampling procedures.  Subjects participating in PK sample 
collection will have their first dose of CC-486 on Day -1 of Cycle 1, after collection of required 
samples on that day.  See Section 6.10 for details.  
6.4. Baseline Measurements
Baseline values are defined as the last assessment of a particular parameter (eg, vital signs, 
weight, or laboratory assessments) prior to administration of the subject’s first dose of IP, unless noted otherwise for a particular assessment.  In most cases, baseline assessments are those 
performed before dosing on Cycle 1, Day 1.
Baseline physical examination, ECOG performance s tatus, hematology and/or serum chemistry 
do not need to be repeated prior to dosing if th e screening examination was performed within 7 
days of the first dose of IP and all necessary parameters were assessed.  
6.5. CC-486 (Oral Azacitidine)
All eligible subjects will receive tr eatment with CC-486 at the dose and schedule identified during 
the safety run-in.  Dose and schedule may be decreased as described in Section 8.2.4 in order to 
manage toxicity.  In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, subjects who show signs of worsening

IWG 2006 hematologic improvement (HI) or better (PR, CR or marrow CR – modified IWG 
2006, Appendix F ) after 2 well-tolerated cycles, may have their dose increased at the discretion 
of the investigator and in discussion with the medical monitor as defined in Table 3 . Again, dose 
and schedule may be adjusted as described in Section 8.2.4 in order to manage toxicity.  
After at least 2 treatment cycles at the increased dose, the assigned dose can be further increased 
if it is well-tolerated but no objective response is observed.  
Special attention should always be given to po tential drug-related toxicity and/or tolerab ility 
issues so dose and/or schedule can be reduced appropriately (Section 8.2.4 ).
Subjects can continue tr eatment with CC-486 as long as all protocol-specified re-tr eatment
criteria continue to be met (see Section 8.2.5 ).
Best supportive care s hould be us ed in combination with study treatment as  deemed necessary.  
Best supportive care includes, but is not limited to, treatment with RBC transfusions (pRBC or whole blood), single donor or pooled donor platelet transfusions, antibiotic, antiviral and/or 
antifungal therapy, antiemetic and/or antidiarrheal support, nutritional support as needed, and 
granulocyte (or granulocyte macrophage) colony-stimulating factors for subjects experiencing neutropenic fever or infection, and may be given as secondary prophylaxis (Section 9.1).  Best 
supportive care for this study excludes the use of ESAs and other hematopoietic growth factors, 
except as noted for G- or GM-CSF in Section 9.1.  It is recommended that an antiemetic 
medication such as ondansetron or an appropriate locally-available equivalent be taken 30 
minutes prior to CC-486 administration during Cycle 1 of the treatment phase.  If 
nausea/vomiting is not significant, further antiemetic prophylaxis may not be needed.  
Refer to Section 8.2for details regarding IP dispensation, administration, and accountability.
6.6. Durvalumab (MEDI4736)
Subjects assigned to the combination treatmen t arm will receive durvalu mab 1500 mg by 1-hour 
(± 5 minutes) IV infusion on Day 1 of each 28 -day treatment cycle.  Guidance for management 
of toxicity that is determined by the investigator to be related to treatment with durvalumab is 
provided in Section 8.2.4.2 .  Durvalumab dosing may be delayed until resolution of toxicity, but 
dose reductions for durvalumab are not permitted.
Durvalumab will be supplied by Celgene Corporation in single use vials in single count cartons. 
Each 10 mL vial will be supplied as a vialed liquid solution containing 500 mg (nominal) of 
investigational product at a concentration of 50 mg/mL. Durvalumab should be stored in accordance with the product label. 
Site to supply the following:
!IV infusion bags of normal saline (0.9% [w /v] sodium chloride injection, 250 mL 
size). Saline bags must be latex-free and can be made of polypropylene, polyethylene, polyolefin copolymers, or polyvinyl chloride. Infusion lines should contain a 0.2- μm 
in-line filter.

normal saline, is  not known, the durvalumab solution should not be infused through an IV line in 
which other solutions or medications are being administered.
Refer to Section 8.2for details regarding IP dispensation, administration, and accountability.
6.6.1. Durvalumab Infusion Monitoring
Subjects will be monitored during and after infusion of durvalumab. Vital signs will be 
measured:
!prior to durvalumab administration (± 30 minutes),
!every 15 minutes (± 5 minutes) during durvalumab administration, 
!at the end of durvalumab i nfusion (± 5 minutes),

All subjects will be monitored for AEs includi ng AESIs during the study.  Refer to Section 11
for details regarding monitoring, recording, and reporting of AEs, including serious adverse 
events (SAEs) and AESIs.  
Information about common side e ffects already known about azacitidine a nd durvalumab will be 
included in the subject informed consent document and should be discussed with the subject as 
needed during the study.  This information can also be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)or will be communicated between IB updates in the form of investigator notifications.
6.7.2. Progression to AML 
Progression to AML will be monitored as an AESI and will be included as part of the safety 
assessment throughout the course of the study.  Progression to AML should be reported if 
documented at any time from signing of informed consent through death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent for further data collection, or study closure, whether or not thought to be
related to treatment with IP.
Events of disease progression to  AML are reported in the same way as SAEs using the 
seriousness criterion of “important medical event” if  no other seriousness criteria apply.  This 
information must also be documented on the appropriate CRFs and in the subject’s source 
documents.  Documentation supporting the diagnosis of progression to AML (eg, confirmatoryhistology or cytology results, etc.) must be provi ded at the time of reporting as an SAE.  Refer to 
Section 11.2 for evaluation of AEs.  
6.7.3. Physical Examination, Vital Signs and Weight
Physical examinations, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate) and 
weight measurements are to be performed as specified in Table 2 .  Significant findings must be 
included on the appropriate CRF.
6.7.4. Urinalysis
A urine sample obtained during screening and at the frequency specified in Table 2 will be 
submitted for analysis to the central laboratory according to the procedure detailed in the Central 
Laboratory Manual.
6.7.5. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram
A standard 12-lead ECG is to be pe rformed during screening, upon treatment discontinuation, 
and whenever clinically indicated.  
Electrocardiograms will be conducted locally as described in Section 6.1.9 .
6.7.6. Coagulation Parameters
Coagulation parameters, including PT/INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen will be recorded during 
screening.  Re-testing of coagulation parameters throughout the study is only necessary if 
clinically indicated.

Hematology and serum chemistry central laboratory analyses, including thyroid function tests,
are to be performed according to the schedule in Table 2.   The same parameters assessed during 
screening are to be evaluated throughout the treatment period, upon treatment discontinuation and at the 28-day follow-up visit (see Section 6.1for details).  
Samples for hematology analysis will be collected pr ior to IP administration on Day 1 of each 
treatment cycle and prior to IP administration on other required days, when possible.  Samples will be processed as detailed in the study laboratory  manual and sent to the central laboratory for 
analysis and reporting.  The schedule of hemato logy assessments for enrolled subjects is as 
follows: 
!Cycles 1-2 – Days 1, 8, 15 and 22
!Cycles 3-12 – Days 1 and 15
!Cycles ≥1 3–D a y  1  
!Treatment Discontinuation Visit
!28-day Follow-up Visit
Samples for serum chemistry analysis will be collected prior to IP administration on Day 1 of 
each treatment cycle and prior to IP administration on other required days during the first 2 
cycles of treatment, if possible.  Samples will be processed as detailed in the study laboratory 
manual and sent to the central laboratory for analysis and reporting.  The schedule of serum chemistry assessments for enrolled subjects is as follows: 
!Cycles 1-2 – Days 1, 8, 15 and 22
!Cycles ≥3 – Day 1 
!Treatment Discontinuation Visit
!28-day Follow-up Visit
Any or all laboratory assessments may be repeated more frequently if clinically indicated.  In the 
event that an immediate laboratory assessment is required to acutely manage a subject, local 
laboratory tests may be used.  In addition to collecting the local laboratory sample, a second 
sample should be processed for shipment to the central laboratory.  If the subject management decision made based on the local laboratory result differs from the decision which the central lab 
result would have resulted in (when available), th e applicable local laboratory result(s) should be 
recorded in the appropriate CRF.
Refer to Section 11.3 for guidance on the reporting of abnormal laboratory values and test results 
as AEs.
6.7.8. Pregnancy Testing
For all female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP – see Section 6.1.14 ), a serum or urine 
pregnancy test (investigator’s discretion) is required within 72 hours prior to beginning treatment 
in the study.  The screening serum pregnancy test can be used to satisfy this requirement if it is performed within 72 hours prior to the first dose of IP.

up visits.
The subject may not receive IP until the investigator has verified that the result of a pregnancy 
test is negative.  
Guidance for pregnancy testing during screening is provided in Section 6.1.14 .
6.7.9. Concomitant Medications/Significant Non-drug Therapies/Concomitant 
Procedures
All prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal medications and therapeutic procedures received 
within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to the first dose of IP, until 28 days after the last dose of CC-486 
and 90 days after durvalumab (or until the treatment discontinuation visit, whichever period is 
longer) must be recorded on the appropriate CRF pa ge.  Concomitant medicat ions, therapies, and 
procedures are those that are received by the subject during their participation in the treatment 
phase of the study.  If a medication, therapy, or procedure ended or was stopped prior to the first 
dose of IP, it will be recorded as a prior medication or as a part of the subject’s medical history, as appropriate.  See Section 9for details regarding concomitant medications and procedures.
6.7.10. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ( Appendix E ) is to be assessed during
screening, before IP dispensation on Day 1 of each treatment cycle and at the treatment 
discontinuation and 28-day follow-up visits.
6.8. Efficacy
6.8.1. Bone Marrow Aspirate, Biopsy and Peripheral Blood Smear
During study treatment, bone ma rrow aspirate (or biopsy if adequate aspirate cannot be obtained) 
is collected:
!after completion of dosing in Cycle 2, Cycle 4, and Cycle 6,
!then after completion of dosing in every 3rdtreatment cycle (9, 12, 15, etc.),
!to confirm suspected disease response or progression, and
!upon treatment discontinuation.
This sample, along with peripheral blood and blood s mear slide(s) must be collected after the last 
dose of IP for that cycle, but before Day 1 of the next cycle.  Samples will be processed according to instructions provided in the Ce ntral Laboratory Manual and sent for:

!general disease status assessment, and
!monitoring for progression to AML.
Whenever a bone marrow sample is collected, a peripheral blood sample and peripheral blood
smear is to be prepared as well.  Specific requirements for submission of bone marrow samples 
for central review are detailed in the Central Laboratory Manual.
6.8.2. Cytogenetics
Bone marrow cytogenetic testing is to be completed by the central pathology laboratory 
whenever a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy is collected for disease assessment.  Note that specific handling of the biopsy is required in order to be used for cytogenetics testing.  See the 
Central Laboratory Manual for handling instructions.
6.8.3. International Working Group Modified Response Assessment
Hematologic response or improvement according to  criteria modified from that of the 
International Working Group (IWG) ( Appendix F ) is to be assessed following every 2 treatment
cycles during the first 6 months of treatment.  Subjects who continue treatment will have IWG 
assessment repeated after every 3 cycles and at treatment discontinuation.
Due to the turnaround time required to obtain results from review of bone marrow aspirate 
and/or biopsy, peripheral blood smear and cytoge netics, IWG response assessment may be done 
at any time prior to starting the next cycle of treatment.  Decisions regarding dose-modification 
and treatment continuation following IWG response assessment may be made based on available local assessments, if necessary, ahead of central hematology and bone marrow pathology 
assessments becoming available.  However, after at least 6 cycles of treatment with IP, if central 
pathology assessment conveys disease progression, the subject must be notified as soon as possible (not later than the next scheduled study visit) to discontinue further study treatment and 
to schedule the treatment discontinuation visit, as appropriate.
6.8.4. General Disease Status Assessment
A general assessment of disease status must be pe rformed at the completion of Cycle 6, prior to 
treatment in Cycle 7, based on available clinical and laboratory assessments.
!Subjects who meet any one of the following criteria can continue on to Cycle 7 and 
beyond, and will have disease status re-assessed prior to beginning each new cycle of IP based on available clinical and la boratory evaluations and at treatment

Confidential and Propri etary 75 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019∀≥ 50% reduction in average RBC transfusion requirement in the 56-day (8-week) 
period immediately prior to disease status assessment as compared to the average baseline RBC transfusion requirement, or
∀any other clinical benefit, including no evidence of progressive disease (see
Table 8 for definitions of progressive disease).
Thereafter, subjects may be discontinued from protocol-prescribed therapy for any of 
the reasons detailed in Section 12.
!Subjects who fail to meet these criteria at the end of Cycle 6 will be discontinued 
from protocol-prescribed therapy and enter the follow-up phase.
Prior to discontinuing a subject, it is recommended that the investigator contact the medical 
monitor and forward appropriate supporting documents for review and discussion.  The decision 
to discontinue a subject remains the responsib ility of the treating physician and will not be 
delayed or refused by the sponsor.
Confirmation of an RBC-transfusion-independent response requires that the investigator 
documents the dates, numbers of units, reason for transfusion, and pre-transfusion hemoglobin levels for all RBC transfusions received by the subject throughout the study in the subject’s 
medical record.  This will be compared to the subject’s RBC transfusion history over the 56 days 
leading to enrollment, as recorded in the appropriate CRFs during screening.
In the event that immediate hematology values are needed for general disease status assessment
prior to beginning a subsequent treatment cycle, local laboratory results may be used pending the 
outcome of the central laboratory assessment.  However, matching samples must always be sent to the central laboratory and clinical decisions and assessments (such as General Disease Status 
Assessment) must be reconciled with the results of the central laboratory. Tests not required per-
protocol, and not related to the conduct of the study , do not need to be duplicated by the central 
lab.
6.8.5. Hematology
Hematology results obtained from the central lab will be used to monitor subject safety and 
evaluate response to treatment.  
In the event that immediate hematology values are needed for clinical decisions, local la boratory 
results may be used pending the outcome of the central laboratory assessment.  However, matching samples must always be sent to the central laboratory and clinical decisions and 
assessments (such as continuation of treatmen t beyond Cycle 6) must be reconciled with the 
results of the central laboratory. 
See Section 6.1.12 for a list of hematology parameters being assessed by the central laboratory 
for this study.
6.8.6. Transfusion Assessment
The following will be recorded for all transfusions the subject received within 56 days (8 weeks) 
prior to the first dose of IP , until 90 days after the last dose of CC-486 or durvalumab or the 
treatment discontinuation visit, whichever occurs later:

RBC transfusions administered for surgical procedures, significant hemorrhagic events, or other 
reasons documented as unrelated to MDS-associated anemia will not be counted in the assessment of baseline RBC transfusion requirements, efficacy, or progressive disease status.
RBC-transfusion-independent re sponse or improvement will be assessed according to criteria 
modified from that of the International Working Group ( Appendix F ).
6.8.7. Survival, Progression to AML, and Subsequent MDS Therapies
All subjects discontinued from protocol-presc ribed therapy for any reason should undergo 
treatment discontinuation procedures (Section 6.13) and be followed for survival, disease 
progression to AML, and subsequent MDS therapies (Section 6.14).  Data regarding subsequent 
therapies, determination of disease progression, and date and cause of death will be recorded in 
the appropriate CRF.  
6.9. Biomarkers
Subjects participating in this study must consent to the future use of bone marrow and blood 
samples collected during screening, throughout treatment, and upon treatment discontinuation for 
biomarker analyses.  Screening samples may be obtained at any point after signing the informed 
consent document, up until taking the first dose of IP.  
Saliva, whole blood, and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy samples will be collected and
analyzed at the following time points to evaluate protein, nucleic acid and cellular biomarkersthat relate to durvalumab treatment.
Saliva sample for biomarkers will be co llected at screening.
Blood samples for biomarkers will be collected at the following time points:
!Screening for sPD-L1, soluble factors, immunophenotyping, peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
!C1D1 (predose) for sPD-L1, soluble f actors, immunophenotyping, whole blood DNA

as indicated in the Table of Events (Section 5).
Peripheral blood samples for future biomarker analyses should be collected  on the same day as 
the screening bone marrow biopsy procedure.  If samples for biomarker assessment are not collected in conjunction with other screening procedures, or are in any way unfit for analysis, the 
sample may be obtained on Day 1, prior to IP administration.  
Consent for biomarker sampling procedures will be obtained through signature of a biomarker-
specific component of the informed consent document.  All subjects participating in this study 
will consent to biomarker sampling procedures, as described.
 
 
 
 
6.10. Pharmacokinetics 
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analy sis will be collected from approximately 10-12 
evaluable subjects randomized to the combination treatment arm at selected sites.  This will 
enable assessment of drug-drug interactions.  Subjects will receive CC-486 approximately one 
hour after completion of the durvalumab infusion except on Day -1.

6.12. Unscheduled Visits
Should it become necessary to repeat an evaluatio n (eg, laboratory tests, vital signs, etc.) outside 
of scheduled study visits, the results of th e repeat evaluation should be recorded in an 
unscheduled visit CRF.  These evaluations should also appear in the subject’s chart and/or other 
source documentation.
6.13. Discontinuation
Prior to discontinuing a subject, it is recommended that the investigator contact the medical 
monitor and forward appropriate supporting documents for review and discussion. The decision 
to discontinue a subject remains the responsib ility of the treating physician and will not be

!Subsequent MDS therapies (following IP discontinuation, if applicable)
If a subject is discontinued during a regularly scheduled visit, all tr eatment discontinuation 
procedures should be completed at that visit.  If a procedure had been performed within 7 days of 
the treatment discontinuation visit, it does not need to be repeated.
The reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the CRF and in source documents for all 
enrolled subjects, whether or not they ever received a dose of IP.  Guidance for reporting of 
reasons for discontinuation is provided in Section 12.
In the event that a subject assigned to the combination treatment arm discontinues treatment with 
durvalumab or CC-486 because of drug-related toxicity, tr eatment with single-agent durvalumab 
or CC-486 may continue until any discontinuation criterion is met (see Section 12).  
6.14. Follow-up
All subjects discontinued from treatment with IP for any reason will be followed for a period of 
at least 28 days after the last dose of CC-486 (90 days for durvalumab) or until the date of the 
treatment discontinuation visit,  whichever is later.  During Safety Follow-up Visits , the following 
assessments will be performed:

7.1. Number of Subjects and Sites
This multi-center, international study will enrol l at least 70 to 194 evaluable subjects (inclusive 
of subjects in the safety run-in and randomized phases).
At least 6 evaluable subjects will be included in the safety run-in phase of the study: 3 receiving 
monotherapy, and 3 receiving combination therapy.
During the randomized treatment phase of the study, approximately 32 subjects with PD and 32 
subjects with SD will be randomized ev enly to receive either CC- 486 alone, or CC-486 + 
durvalumab.  There will be 4 cohorts (16 subjects in each) in Stage 1: SD treated with monotherapy, PD treated with monotherapy, SD treated with combination therapy and PD 
treated with combination therapy.
If there are 2 or fewer responses in either cohort during Stage 1, enrollment to that cohort w ill be 
terminated.  Otherwise, the cohort will continue to  Stage 2 and accrue an additional 25 subjects 
each. If 8 or more responses are observed in these 41 subjects, the null hypothesis will be 
rejected for that cohort.
Therefore, the total number of subjects for the randomized treatment phase will range from 
approximately 64 (at Stage 1) to 164 (Stage 1 plus Stage 2) for the 4 cohorts. More subjects can 
potentially be recruited for replacement of non-evaluable subjects, if needed (see Figure 2 ).
The study population may include subjects with both lower- and higher-risk disease who meet
the following criteria.
7.2. Inclusion Criteria
Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:
1. Male or female, ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent document
2. Documented diagnosis of MDS, classified according to FAB classification criteria 
(Appendix B )
3. Adequate course of treatment with an injectable hypomethyl ating agent (azacitidine for 
injection or decitabin e) as the last therapeutic inte rvention for MDS prior to beginning 
screening for this study 
Adequate is defined as: 
∀having received at least 6 consecutive 4-week treatment cycles  with azacitidine 
for injection, or
∀having received at least 4 consecutive 6-week treatment cycles with decitabine (3-
day regimen) or at least 6 consecutive 4-week treatment cycles with decitabine (5-

or decitabine 5-day regimen; two 42-day cycles of decitabine 3-day regimen.
4. Documented disease progression or stable disease as best response to treatment (or 
attempted treatment) with azacitidine for injection or decitabine.  Those achieving an 
objective response to treatment regimen with an injectable HMA ( Appendix F ) are 
excluded from participation in this study.
Definitions of disease progression are modified from IWG 2006 criteria ( Appendix F ) 
and include:
∀Pre-injectable HMA baseline bone marrow myeloblasts:
oLess than 5%: ≥100% increase to ≥8% blasts
o≥ 5%: ≥50% increase to ≥10% blasts
Note:  ≥ 30% blasts is considered AML per FAB classification.  Subjects known to 
have ≥ 30% blasts are not eligible for inclusion in this study.  Recognizing limitations 
of blast cell quantification, this protoc ol will allow subjects with pre-enro llment bone 
marrow blast counts up to 33% on the screening bone marrow examination to be 
considered for inclusion.  Assessment may  be made according to local bone marrow 
examination to facilitate enrollment of eligible subjects into the treatment phase of the study.  
∀Any clinical worsening from pre-injectable HMA baseline condition, including:
osustained clinically-significant worsening (investigator’s assessment) from 
baseline granulocyte, platelet, or hemoglobin values ( ≥ 2 values, separated by 
≥ 2 weeks)
worsening granulocytes should be ≥ 50% decrease from pre-injectable 
HMA baseline value
worsening platelets should be ≥ 50% decrease from pre-injectable
HMA baseline value (untransfused)
worsening hemoglobin should be ≥ 1.5 g/dL decrease from pre-
injectable HMA baseline value in subjects not receiving RBC 
transfusions
omeaningful worsening in RBC or pl atelet transfusion requir ement
Definition of stable disease is based on modified IWG 2006 criteria ( Appendix F ):
∀Failure to achieve any objective response (CR, PR, mCR, or HI), but no evidence 
of disease progression within the 8 weeks leading to the subject’s first dose of IPin this study (Cycle 1, Day 1).
5. Have the last dose of the prior treatmen t regimen (injectable HMA – azacitidine for 
injection or decitabine) not more than 16 weeks prior to screening for this study (date of informed consent signature).
6. No less than 3 weeks between the last dose of the prior treatment regimen (injectable 
HMA – azacitidine for injecti on or decitabine) and the planned date of first dose of IP.

8. Females subjects of childbearing potential1may participate, providing they meet the 
following conditions:
a. Have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the investigator prior to starting any 
IP therapy: serum pregnancy test at screening and negative serum or urine pregnancy 
test (investigator’s discretion) within 72 hours prior to starting treatment with IP 
(Cycle 1, Day 1). They must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of 
the study (before beginning each subsequent cycle of treatment), and after the last 
dose of any IP. This applies even if the subject practices complete abstinence2from 
heterosexual contact.
b. Agree to practice true abstinence2(which must be reviewed on a monthly basis and 
source documented) or agree to the use of highly effective methods of contraception 
from 28 days prior to starting durvalumab or azacitidine, and must agree to continue 
using such precautions while taking durvalumab or azacitidine (including dose 
interruptions) and for up to 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab or azacitidine.  
Cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a responsible 
physician. 
c. Agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least 90 days
after the last dose of IP.
d. Refrain from egg cell donation while taking durvalumab and for at least 90 days after 
the last dose of durvalumab.
Note that the screening serum pregnancy test can also be used as the test prior to 
starting IP if it is performed  within the 72-hour timeframe.
9. Male subjects must:  
a. Either practice true abstinence2from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed 
on a monthly basis) or agree to avoid f athering a child, to use highly effective 
methods of contraception, male condom plus spermicide during sexual contact with a 
pregnant female or a female of child bearing potential (even if he has undergone a 
successful vasectomy) from starting dose of IP (Cycle 1 Day 1), including dose 
interruptions through 90 days after receipt of the last dose of durvalumab or 
azacitidine.
b. Refrain from semen or sperm donation while taking IP and for at least 90 days after

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 88 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 20198. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY TREATMENTS
8.1. Description of Investigational Product(s)
Investigational product supply will be managed by IRTS.  All IP must be stored in accordance 
with the product label in a secured area to prevent unauthorized access.
8.1.1. CC-486 (Oral Azacitidine)
Celgene Corporation will supply CC-486 100-, 150-, a nd 200-mg tablets for oral administration.  
Each tablet is formulated using excipients that are generally regarded as safe and are used in 
marketed drug products.  A list of excipients included in the formulation is provided in the azacitidine IB.
After Amendment 4 approval, the CC-486 supply will be limited to 100-mg tablets for oral 
administration.
All tablets will be packaged in blister cards.  Only sufficient IP for one cycle of treatment will be 
provided to  each subject at the start of each treatment cycle.  All tablets should be swallowed 
whole, and should not be broken or chewed.
Shelf-life evaluation of the intact blister card is ongoing.  Investigational Product w ill be 
monitored for stability for the duration of the study.
8.1.2. Durvalumab (MEDI4736)
Durvalumab will be supplied by Celgene Corporation in single use vials in single count cartons. 
Each 10mL vial will be supplied as a vialed liquid solution containing 500 mg (nominal) of 
investigational product at a concentration of 50 mg/mL. Durvalumab is stored at 2 %C-8 %C
(36%F to 46 %F) and must be used before the individually assigned expiry date on the label.
Durvalumab will no longer be supplied during the Extension Phase as no subjects are being 
treated with durvalumab.
8.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule
After the safety run-in is complete and the CC- 486 dose and regimen to be used in combination 
with durvalumab is established, eligible subjects will be randomized to receive CC-486 alone or 
in combination with durvalumab in the ra ndomized tr eatment phase of the study.  All 
randomized subjects will receive CC-486 orally ad ministered tablets at the established dose and 
schedule. The schedule will include BID dosing on days 1-21 of each 28-day tr eatment cycle. 
Subjects randomized to the combination ther apy arm will receive durv alumab, 1500 mg on    
Day 1 of each 28-day treatment cycle by IV infusion over approximately 1 hour (± 5 minutes).
CC-486 tablets should be ingested approximately  1 hour after completion of the durvalumab 
infusion on Day 1 of each  treatment cycle (except for Cycle 1 in which CC-486 is given on
Day -1 for PK sub-study subjects) as described in Section 8.2.2 .  In the event of unacceptable 
toxicity, CC-486 dose and schedule may be modified (see Section 8.2.4 ).  Infusions of 
durvalumab may be interrupted, slowed, or discont inued in order to address toxicity, but dose 
reduction of durvalumab is not permitted (see Section 8.2.4.2 ).

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 89 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, subjects who show signs of worsening disease (clinical
or hematological), who remain in stable disease, or do not experience modified IWG 2006 
hematologic improvement (HI) or better (PR, CR or marrow CR – modified IWG 2006, 
Appendix F ) after 2 well-tolerated cycles, may have their dose increased at the discretion of the 
investigator and in discussion with the medical monitor as described in Section 8.2.4 and
Table 3 . Again, dose and schedule may be adjusted as described in Section 8.2.4 in order to 
manage toxicity.  
Subjects may continue to receive the protocol-prescribed therapy for as long as they benefit from 
the treatment (Section 4.1.3 ) or until treatment is discontinued for reasons detailed in Section 12.  
Prior to discontinuing a subject, it is reco mmended that the investigator contact the medical 
monitor and forward appropriate supporting documents for review and discussion.  However, the 
decision to discontinue a subject remains the responsibility of the treating physician and will not 
be delayed or refused by the sponsor.
8.2.1. Investigational Product Dispensation8.2.1.1. CC-486 Dispensation
CC-486 will be dispensed on Day 1 of each treatment cycle (except for Cycle 1 in which CC-486 
is given on Day -1 for PK sub-study subjects).
Only 1 cycle of IP will be dispensed to the subject at this time unless extreme extenuating 
circumstances apply and other arrangements are agreed to by the sponsor’s medical monitor in 
writing.  
The subject may not receive IP for each treatment cycle until all Day 1 procedures have been 
completed and all IP from the previous cycle is accounted for (where applicable).  
For FCBP subjects, a pregnancy test must be pe rformed, and a negative result verified by the 
investigator, within 72 hours prior to IP administration on Day 1 of each treatment cycle.
8.2.1.2. Durvalumab Dispensation
Total in-use storage time from needle puncture of durvalumab vial to start of administration 
should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). If in-use storage time exceeds these limits, a new dose must be prepared from new vials. Infusion 
solutions must be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature prior to commencement of 
administration. Durvalumab does not contain preservatives and any unused portion must be discarded.
Sites should follow standard and local aseptic procedures and the clinical study protocol for all 
activities. All dispensing activit ies should be documented according to local procedures.
The shelf lives stated above are based on chemical and physical stability; assignment of 
microbial shelf life is the responsibility of th e clinical center and should be aligned with local 
procedure for managing microbial risk as long as the times specified in this section are not exceeded. Vials should be used for the specific subjects to whom they are assigned, and must not 
be shared between subjects.

8.2.2.1. CC-486 Administration
Investigational product administration will be acc urately recorded including, but not limited to, 
date of administration, dose and any changes in dose administration (eg, interruption or reduction 
in dose due to an adverse event).
Investigational product is scheduled to be tak en on the first 21 days of each 28-day tr eatment 
cycle, unless there has been a schedule modification of CC-486 administration due to toxicity.  
Subjects will be instructed to take CC-486 twice daily, in the morning and evening, at 
approximately the same times each day.  It is recommended that an antiemetic medication be taken 30 minutes prior to CC-486 administration during Cycle 1.  If nausea / vomiting is not 
significant, antiemetic prophylaxis may not be needed.  Subject will ingest CC-486 tablets with 
approximately 240 mL (8 ounces) of room temperature water.  Investigational product may be taken on an empty stomach or with food (a  light breakfast or meal of up to approximately 600 
calories can be provided as a guidance).
Subjects assigned to the combination treatment arm will take their first dose of CC-486 on Day 1 
of each treatment cycle approximately one hour after completion of the durvalumab infusion.  If 
an antiemetic medication is to be administered, it should be taken about 30 minutes prior to 
dosing with CC-486.
For subjects enrolled in the PK population, the treatment administration of the first dose of CC-
486 on PK days (ie, Cycle 1 Day -1 and Cycle 2 Day 1) is described below:
!After performing the required overnight fast, taking antiemetic premedication with 
240 mL of water for nausea and vomiting (eg, ondansetron), and completing the 
required predose assessments (including the pr edose PK sample), subjects will ingest 
CC-486 with 240 mL of room temperature  water in the clinic approximately 30 
minutes after antiemetic administration on each PK dosing day.  Each dose of CC-486should be given at approximately the same time each day.  The exact date and time of 
dosing will be recorded in the source documents and appropriate CRF.
Dietary restrictions on PK days (ie, Cycle 1 Day -1 and Cycle 2 Day 1): 
!Subjects should be instructed to limit their coffee intake to one 8-ounce cup of black 
coffee (no cream or sugar) and to not consume alcohol, tea, chocolate, or cola 
beverages within 2 hours prior to collecting PK samples.
!Subjects should not ingest food for a minimum of 8 hours prior and 2 hours after CC-
486 is administered.  Water can be allowed as desired except for 1 hour before and 
after CC-486 administration.  The only water permitted in the 1-hour period before 
CC-486 administration is the 240 mL of water for antiemetic ingestion.
On Cycle 2 Day 1, the first dose of CC-486 will be administered approximately one hour after 
the completion of the durvalumab i nfusion.

Confidential and Propri etary 91 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 20198.2.2.2. Durvalumab Administration
Preparation of durvalumab and preparation of the IV  bag are to be performed aseptically. Vials 
should be used for the specific subjects to whom they are assigned, and must not be shared 
between subjects.
!Three (3) vials of durvalumab (500 mg/vial; 50 mg/mL) are used to prepare a single 
infusion of the per-protocol dose of 1500 mg.
!Vials containing durvalumab may be gently inverted for mixing, but should not be 
shaken. All durvalumab vials should be equilibrated to room temperature for 30 minutes prior to dose preparation.
8.2.2.2.1. Preparation of infusion bags
The preparation of infusion bags should be done under aseptic conditions by trained personnel; 
they should not be prepared on the ward.
!A total of 30 mL durvalumab (contained in 3 vials) is added to an IV bag containing 250 
mL normal saline (Section 6.6), supplied by the site.  The bag is mixed by gentle 
inversion to ensure homogeneity of the dose in the bag.
!Following preparation of the dose, the entire contents of the IV bag should be 
administered.
!Flush the IV line with a volume of normal saline equal to the priming volume of the 
infusion set used after the c ontents of the IV bag are fully administered, or complete the 
infusion according to institutional policy to ensure the full dose is administered and 
document if the line was not flushed.
8.2.2.2.2. Infusion schedule and rates
Durvalumab will be administered as a 1-hour (± 5 minutes) IV i nfusion on Day 1 of each 28-day 
treatment cycle.  
8.2.2.2.3. Monitoring of dose administration
Subjects will be monitored during and after infusion of durvalumab. Vital signs will be measured 
within 30 minutes prior to durvalumab administr ation, every 15 minutes (± 5 minutes) during 
durvalumab administration, within 5 minutes of completing the durvalumab infusion, and at 30 
minutes (± 5 minutes) and 60 minutes (± 5 minutes) post infusion of durvalumab, followed by a 
2-hour (± 15 minutes) period of observation.
In the event of a ≤Grade 2 infusion-related reaction, the infusion rate of durvalumab may be 
decreased by 50% or interrupted until resolution of the event (up to 4 hours) and re-initiated at 
50% of the initial rate until completion of th e infusion. For subjects with a ≤Grade 2 
infusion-rel ated reaction, subsequent infusions may be  administered at 50% of the initial rate.
Acetaminophen and/or an antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine) or equivalent medications per 
institutional standard may be administered at the discretion of the investigator. If the infusion-rel ated reaction is ≥Grade 3 or higher in severity, IP will be discontinued.

Confidential and Propri etary 92 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. Appropriate drugs 
and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available, and 
study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis. The study site must have 
immediate access to emergency resuscitation teams and equipment in addition to the ability to admit subjects to an intensive care unit if necessary.
8.2.3. Missing Doses
All efforts should be made to administer IP on all of the scheduled days of each 28-day treatment 
cycle.  Any missed doses of CC-486 during that period should not be taken after the last 
scheduled day of administration, but should be  returned by the subject for IP accountability.
8.2.4. Dose Modifications and Toxicity Management8.2.4.1. CC-486 (Oral Azacitidine) Dose Modification and Toxicity Management
All efforts should be made to maintain treatment with CC-486 according to schedule without 
cycle delay, dose interruption, or reduction.  Subjects  will be monitored for hematologic toxicity 
and non-hematologic toxicity with the NCI CTCAE  Version 4.03 used as a guide for the grading 
of severity.
If adverse events are observed that are considered by the investigator to be at least possibly 
related to treatment, CC-486 dosing may be interrupt ed, delayed or modified.  The investigator is 
encouraged to contact the medical monitor prior to any tr eatment adjustment, if possible.
For any adverse event that would put a subject at unacceptable risk in the investigator´s opinion 
(eg, Grade 4 neutropenia), CC-486 dosing may be interrupted, delayed or modified, even if not 
considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment.
A minimum CC-486 dose and schedule of 100 mg BID 14/28d (or 200 mg QD 14/28d) is 
permitted in the event of toxicity (see Table 3 ).  Subjects who cannot tolerate this minimum dose 
and schedule should discontinue the treatmen t phase of the study a nd enter follow-up.  
Subjects who have their CC-486 dose reduced or treat ment schedule modified may return to their 
original dose and/or schedule in a stepwise fa shion upon discussion and documented agreement 
between the investigator and the medical monitor, provided that at least two treatment cycles have proven tolerable at the current dose and schedule.  The treatment schedule should first be 
increased from 14/28 days to 21/28 days at 100 mg BID (or 200 mg QD if the rescue dosing 
option was utilized), followed by a stepwise es calation in dose (eg, 100 mg BID to 150 mg BID 
or 200 mg QD to 300 mg QD, etc.).  At least two treatment cycles without unacceptable drug-
related toxicity should precede any increase in dose or schedule.
In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, subjects who show signs of worsening disease (clinical
or hematological), who remain in stable disease, or do not experience modified IWG 2006 
hematologic improvement (HI) or better (PR, CR or marrow CR – modified IWG 2006, 
Appendix F ) after 2 well-tolerated cycles,  may have their dose increased at the discretion of the 
investigator and in discussion with the medical monitor as described in Section 6.5and Table 3 . 
Again, dose and schedule may be adjusted as described in Section 8.2.4 in order to manage 
toxicity.

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 93 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019After Amendment 4 approval, dose increases will no longer be allowed. Dose decreases 
following Table 3 are still allowed. Subjects will continue at the same dose levels during the 
Extension Phase. Any potential dose escalation will be considered a treatment failure and the 
subject should be discontinued.
Refer to Section 8.2.5 if, despite temporary interruption, delay or modification of study 
treatment, the toxicity persists for more than 42 da ys and is considered by the investigator to be 
at least possibly related to study treatment.
Following any modification of study treatment or if a dose is missed, the subject should stay on 
the visit schedule as specified in Table 2 .  Unscheduled visits may occur to monitor the subject’s 
toxicities if necessary.

Dose adjustment options from current dose/regimen.  Dose/schedule reduction does not need to be taken stepwise.
Dose Modification for Febrile Neutropenia
Any subject who experiences febrile neutropenia ≥Grade 3 that persists for up to 3 days may, 
with concomitant antibiotic, antiviral, a nd/or antifungal therapy, continue to receive IP 
uninterrupted at the investigator’s discretion.  If the event exceeds 3 days, IP should be 
temporarily interrupted.  Dose modificatio n may be considered as summarized in Table 4 .
Dose Modification for Neutropenia Grade 4
For subjects entering the study with pre-existing Neutropenia Grade 4, treatment should be 
started at the regular starting dose and schedule of 200 mg BID 21/28d.  However, if neutropenia continues to worsen under treatment, dose modification may be considered as summarized in

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 94 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019For any subject who experiences a worsening of neutropenia to Grade 4 for ≥ 4 days, 
independent of whether considered related to IP or not, a dose modification may be considered as
summarized in Table 4 .
Dose Modification for Diarrhea
It is recommended that subjects experiencing diarrhea be managed according to the guidelines 
provided in Appendix H .  Anti-diarrhea medication may be administered as prophylaxis against
diarrhea and for treatment of any adverse events of diarrhea.  Recommended dose modification 
steps for diarrhea ( ≥Grade 2) are summarized in Table 4 .  If further dose-reduction beyond 
modification Step -3 (or the QD rescue regimen) is thought to be necessary, IP should be 
discontinued and the treatment discontinuation visit scheduled.
Dose Modification for Nausea and Vomiting
A serotonin (5-HT 3) receptor antagonist (eg, ondansetron) or other comparable medication may 
be administered as an antiemetic prophylaxis approximately 30 minutes prior to IP administration if necessary.  Antiemetic pretreatment is recommended during the first cycle of 
the treatment phase.  If the subject does not experience significant nausea and/or vomiting, 
further use of antiemetic medications may not be necessary.  Antiemetic medication(s) should be administered for treatment of any adverse even ts of nausea and/or vomiting.  Recommended 
dose modifications for nausea and vomiting ( ≥Grade 3) are summarized in Table 4 .  If further 
dose-reduction beyond modification Step -3 (or the QD rescue regimen) is thought to be 
necessary, IP should be discontinued and th e treatment discontinuation visit scheduled.
Dose Modification for Renal Dysfunction and Abnormal Serum Electrolytes
If unexplained elevations of serum creatinine or electrolyte disturbances occur, dose or schedule 
modifications may be implemented as summarized in Table 4 .  If further dose-reduction beyond 
modification Step -3 (or the QD rescue regimen) is thought to be necessary, IP should be 
discontinued and the treatment discontinuation visit scheduled.
Dose Modification for Weight Change
No dose adjustment should be made for wei ght loss or gain alone; however, the reason for 
weight loss (eg, significant nausea, vomiting, anorexia, etc.) or weight gain (eg, peripheral edema) should be investigated and may re quire a dose modification as specified in Table 4 .  
Dose Modification for Any Other Adverse Event 
Any subject who experiences any hematologic or non-hematologic adverse event ≥ Grade 2, that 
is a worsening from baseline state (see Section 6.4for baseline definition) and would put a 
subject at unacceptable risk in the investig ator´s opinion, may have IP dosing temporarily 
interrupted until the adverse event returns to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline state.  This decision is not 
dependent on the relationship between the AE and IP (related or not).  Recommended dose 
modifications for other≥Grade 2 hematologic or non-hematologic adverse events are 
summarized in Table 4 .

Events
Dose Modifications Toxicity Management
General Considerations
Drug administration modifications of IP/study regimen will be 
made to manage potential immune-mediated AEs based on severity 
of treatment-emergent toxicities graded per NCI CTCAE v4.03.
In addition to the criteria for per manent discontinu ation of IP/study 
regimen based on CTC grade/severity (table below), permanently discontinue IP/study regimen for the following conditions: 
!Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of ≤ 10 mg of 
prednisone per day (or equivalent) within 12 weeks after 
last dose of IP/ study regimen
!Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 
treatment-related AE following resumption of dosing. 
Grade 1 - No dose modification
Grade 2 - Hold IP/study regimen dose until Grade 2 resolution to
≤ Grade 1
!If toxicity worsens, then treat as Grade 3 or Grade 4
!IP/study treatment can be resumed once event stabilizes to 
Grade ≤1 after completion of steroid taper
!Subjects with endocrinop athies who may require 
prolonged or continued steroid replacement can be retreated with IP/study regimen on the following conditions: 1) the event stabilizes and is controlled, 2) the subject is clin ically stable as per Investigator or treating 
physician’s clinical judgement, and 3) doses of prednisone are at less than or equal to 10 mg/day or 
equivalent.
Grade 3 - Depending on the individual toxicity, IP/study regimen 
may be permanently discontinued. Please refer to guidelines below
Grade 4 - Permanently discontinue IP/study regimen It is recommended that management of immune-mediated adverse 
events (imAEs) follow the guidelines presented in this table
- It is possible that events with an inflammatory or immune-
mediated mechanism could occur in nearly all organs, some of them not noted specifically in these guidelines.  Whether specific immune-mediated events (and/or laboratory indicators of such events) are noted in these guidelines or not, subjects should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology (eg, disease progression, concomitant 
medications, infections, etc.) to a possible immune-mediated event. 
-In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, all such events 
should be managed as if they were immune related.  General 
recommendations follow.
-Symptomatic and topical therapy should be considered for 
low-grade (Grade 1 or 2, unless otherwise specified) events.
-For persistent (greater than 3 to 5 days) low-grade (Grade 2) 
or severe (Grade ≥ 3) events promptly start oral prednisone 1-
2 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent.
-Some events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or 
mortality – eg, myo-carditis, or other similar events even if 
they are not currently noted in the guidelines – should progress rapidly to high dose IV corticosteroids (methylprednisolone at 2 to 4 mg/kg/day) even if the event is Grade 2, and if clinical suspicion is high and/or there has been clinical confirmation. Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician, and promptly pursue specialist consultation.
-If symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid tapering 
(28 days of taper), increase the corticosteroid dose (prednisone dose [eg, up to 2-4 mg/kg/day PO or IV

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 98 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019!IP Note: IP/study regimen should be permanently 
discontinued in Grade 3 events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality – e g, myocarditis, or other 
similar events even if they are not currently noted in the guidelines. Similarly, consider whether IP/study regimen 
should be permanently discontinued in Grade 2 events 
with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality – eg, 
myocarditis, or other similar events even if they are not currently noted in the guidelines – when they do not rapidly improve to Grade <1 upon treatment with 
systemic steroids and following full taper
!Note: There are some exceptions to permanent 
discontinuation of IP for Grade 4 events (ie, 
hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, Type 1 diabetes)equivalent]) until stabilization or improvement of symptoms, 
then resume corticosteroid tapering at a slower rate (> 28 days of taper).
−More potent immunosuppressives such as TNF inhibitors (eg
infliximab) – (also refer to individual sections of the immune mediated adverse events for specific type of immunosuppressive) should be considered for events not responding to systemic steroids.  Progression to use of more potent immunosuppressives should proceed more rapidly in events with high likelihood for mo rbidity and/or mortality –
eg, myocarditis, or other similar events even if they are not currently noted in the guidelines – when these events are not 
responding to systemic steroids.
−With long-term steroid and other immunosuppressive use, 
consider need for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP, formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia) prophylaxis, gastrointestinal protection, and glucose monitoring.
-Discontinuation of IP is not mandated for Grade 3 / Grade 4 
inflammatory reactions attributed to local tumor response (eg, 
inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease, lymph 
nodes, etc.). Continuation of IP in this situation should be based upon a benefit/risk analysis for that subject.

Pneumonitis/Interstitial 
Lung Disease (ILD)Any Grade General Guidance For Any Grade:
−Monitor subjects for signs and symptoms of 
pneumonitis or ILD (new onset or worsening shortness of breath or cough). Subjects should be evaluated with imaging and pulmonary function tests, including other 
diagnostic procedures as described below.
−Initial work-up may include clinical evaluation, 
monitoring of oxygenation via pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), laboratory work-up, and high- resolution CT scan.
Grade 1
(asymptomatic, 
clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated)No dose modifications required. 
However, consider holding IP/study 
regimen dose as clinically appropriate and during diagnostic work-up for 
other etiologies.For Grade 1 (radiographic changes only):
−Monitor and closely follow up in 2 to 4 days for clinical 
symptoms, pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), and 
laboratory work-up and then as clinically indicated.
−Consider Pulmonary and Infectious disease consult.
Grade 2
(symptomatic; 
medical intervention indicated; limiting 
instrumental ADL)Hold IP/study regimen dose until 
Grade 2 resolution to Grade ≤1.
!If toxicity worsens, then treat as 
Grade 3 or Grade 4.
!If toxicity improves to Grade ≤1, 
then the decision to reinitiate IP/study regimen will be based upon treating physician’s clinical judgment and after completion of 
steroid taper.For Grade 2 (mild to moderate new symptoms):
−Monitor symptoms daily and consider hospitalization.
−Promptly start systemic steroids (eg, prednisone 1 to 
2 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent).
−Reimage as clinically indicated.
−If no improvement within 3 to 5 days, additional workup 
should be considered and prompt treatment with IV 
methylprednisolone 2 to 4 mg/kg/day started
−If still no improvement within 3 to 5 days despite IV 
methylprednisolone at 2 to 4 mg/kg/day, promptly start immunosuppressive therapy such as TNF inhibitors 
(eg, infliximab at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Caution: It is 
important to rule out sepsis and refer to infliximab label 
for general guidance before using infliximab.
−Once the subject is improving, gradually taper steroids 
over ≥28 days and consider prophylactic antibiotics,

−Steroids should be considered in the absence of clear 
alternative etiology, even for low-grade events, in order 
to prevent potential progression to higher grade event.
−Use analgesics carefully; they can mask symptoms of 
perforation and peritonitis.
Grade 1
(Diarrhea: stool 
frequency of <4 over baseline per day)(Colitis: asymptomatic; clinical or diagnostic observations only)No dose modifications. For Grade 1:
−Monitor closely for worsening symptoms.
−Consider symptomatic treatment, including hydration, 
electrolyte replacement, dietary changes (eg, American 
Dietetic Association colitis diet), and loperamide. Use 
probiotics as per treating physician’s clinical judgment.
Grade 2
(Diarrhea: stool 
frequency of 4 to 6 over baseline per day) (Colitis: abdominal pain; mucus or blood in 
stool)Hold IP/study regimen until 
resolution to Grade ≤1
!If toxicity worsens, then treat as 
Grade 3 or Grade 4.
!If toxicity improves to Grade ≤1, 
then IP/study regimen can be resumed after completion of 
steroid taper.For Grade 2:
−Consider symptomatic treatment, including hydration, 
electrolyte replacement, dietary changes (eg, American Dietetic Association colitis diet), and loperamide and/or 
budesonide.
−Promptly start prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day PO or IV 
equivalent.
−If event is not responsive within 3 to 5 days or worsens 
despite prednisone at 1 to 2 mg/kg/day PO or IV 
equivalent, GI consult should be obtained for consideration of further workup, such as imaging and/or colonoscopy, to confirm colitis and rule out perforation, and prompt treatment with IV methylprednisolone 2 to 4 
mg/kg/day started.

section)Any Grade
(depending on the 
type of endocrinopathy, refer to NCI CTCAE v4.03 for defining the CTC grade/severity)General Guidance For Any Grade:
−Consider consulting an endocrinologist for endocrine 
events.
−Consider, as necessary, discussing with study physician.
−Monitor subjects for signs and symptoms of 
endocrinopathies. Non-specific symptoms include headache, fatigue, behavior changes, changed mental status, vertigo, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, 
polydipsia, polyuria, hypotension, and weakness.
−Subjects should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology (eg, disease progression including 
brain metastases, or infections).
−Depending on the suspected endocrinopathy, monitor 
and evaluate thyroid function tests: TSH, free T3 and free T4 and other relevant endocrine and related labs 
(eg, blood glucose and ketone levels, HgA1c).
−For modest asymptomatic elevations in serum amylase 
and lipase, corticosteroid treatment is not indicated as long as there are no other signs or symptoms of 
pancreatic inflammation.
−If a subject experiences an AE that is thought to be 
possibly of autoimmune nature (eg, thyroiditis, pancreatitis, hypophysitis, or diabetes insipidus), the investigator should send a blood sample for appropriate

Peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes
(such as Guillain-Barre 
and myasthenia gravis)Any Grade General Guidance For Any Grade:
−The prompt diagnosis of immune-mediated peripheral 
neuromotor syndromes is important, since certain subjects may unpredictably experience acute decompensations that can result in substantial morbidity or in the worst case, death. Special care should be taken 
for certain sentinel symptoms that may predict a more 
severe outcome, such as prominent dysphagia, rapidly progressive weakness, and signs of respiratory 
insufficiency or autonomic instability.
−Subjects should be evaluated to rule out any alternative 
etiology (eg, disease progression, infections, metabolic syndromes or medications). It should be noted that the diagnosis of immune-mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes can be particularly challenging in subjects with underlying cancer, due to the multiple potential confounding effects of cancer (and its treatments) throughout the neuraxis.

prompt and accurate diagnosis, it is essential to have a 
low threshold to obtain a neurological consult.
−Neurophysiologic diagnostic testing 
(eg, electromyogram and nerve conduction investigations, and “repetitive stimulation” if myasthenia is suspected) are routinely indicated upon suspicion of such conditions and may be best facilitated 
by means of a neurology consultation.
−It is important to consider that the use of steroids as the 
primary treatment of Guillain-Ba rre is not typically 
considered effective. Subjects requiring treatment should be started with IVIG and followed by 
plasmapheresis if not responsive to IVIG.
Grade 1 No dose modifications. For Grade 1:
−Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study 
physician.
−Care should be taken to monitor subjects for sentinel 
symptoms of a potential decompensation as described 
above.
−Obtain a neurology consult.
Grade 2 Hold IP/study regimen dose until 
resolution to Grade ≤1.
Permanently discontinue IP/study

Myocarditis Any Grade General Guidance
Discontinue drug permanently if 
biopsy-proven immune-mediated myocarditis.For Any Grade:
−The prompt diagnosis of immune-mediated myocarditis 
is important, particularly in subjects with baseline cardiopulmonary disease and reduced cardiac function. 
−Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study 
physician.
−Monitor subjects for signs and symptoms of myocarditis 
(new onset or worsening chest pain, arrhythmia, shortness of breath, peripheral edema). As some symptoms can overlap with lung toxicities, simultaneously evaluate for and rule out pulmonary 
toxicity as well as other causes (eg, pulmonary 
embolism, congestive heart failure, malignant pericardial effusion). A Cardiology consultation should be obtained early, with prompt assessment of whether and when to complete a cardiac biopsy, including any 
other diagnostic procedures.

Myositis/Polymyositis (“Poly/myositis”)Any Grade General Guidance For Any Grade:
−Monitor subjects for signs and symptoms of 
poly/myositis. Typically, muscle weakness/pain occurs 
in proximal muscles including upper arms, thighs, shoulders, hips, neck and back, but rarely affects the extremities including hands and fingers; also difficulty breathing and/or trouble swallowing can occur and 
progress rapidly. Increased general feelings of tiredness 
and fatigue may occur, and there can be new-onset falling, difficulty getting up from a fall, and trouble climbing stairs, standing up from a seated position, 
and/or reaching up.
−If poly/myositis is suspected, a Neurology consultation 
should be obtained early, with prompt guidance on diagnostic procedures. Myocarditis may co-occur with poly/myositis; refer to guidance under Myocarditis. Given breathing complications, refer to guidance under Pneumonitis/ILD. Given possibility of an existent (but previously unknown) autoimmune disorder, consider 
Rheumatology consultation.

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 126 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 20198.2.5. Re-treatment Criteria
In order to proceed to the next cycle, subjects mu st continue to meet entry criteria regarding 
renal and hepatic function (see Section 7.3).  Thus subjects will have laboratory assessments 
performed to evaluate organ function prior to s tarting each cycle (including Cycle 1).  Because of
the time it takes to obtain results from the central laboratory, samples should be collected early 
enough prior to starting the next cycle in order to allow sufficient time for review.  In the event 
that immediate laboratory assessment is needed, local laboratory measurement is acceptable for starting the next cycle pending the outcome of the central laboratory assessment (ie, in addition 
to collecting the local laboratory sample, a matching sample should always be sent to the central 
laboratory).
The start of the next cycle will be delayed if the subject does not meet entry criteria regarding 
renal and hepatic function.  If there is a delay of more than 42 days (6 weeks) in the start of the 
next cycle, the med ical monitor must be  consulted.  Study treatment should be discontinued if 
there is a delay of more than 56 days (8 weeks) in the start of the next cycle, unless, in the 
opinion of the investigator and the medical monit or, the subject is experiencing clinical benefit.  
Justification of the subject continuing in the study  must be recorded in the source documents.
Prior to discontinuing a subject, it is reco mmended that the investigator contact the medical 
monitor and forward appropriate supporting documents for review and discussion.  The decision 
to discontinue a subject remains the responsib ility of the treating physician and will not be 
delayed or refused by the sponsor.
8.2.6. Overdose
Overdose, as defined for this protocol, refers to CC-486 and durvalumab dosing only.
On a per dose basis, an overdose is defined as any amount over the protocol-specified dose of 
CC-486 or durvalumab assigned to a given subject, regardless of any associated adverse events or sequelae.
On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as any amount more frequent than the 
protocol-required schedule or frequency. On an infusi on rate basis, an overdose is defined as any 
rate faster than the protocol-specified rate. 
!For oral, any amount over the protocol-specified dose
!For IV, 10% over the protocol-specified dose
Complete data about drug administration, including any overdose, regardless of whether the 
overdose was accidental or intentional, should be reported in the case report form. See Section 11.1 for the reporting of adverse events associated with overdose.
8.2.7. Discontinuation
The following events are considered sufficient reasons for discontinuing a subject from the 
investigational product and/or from the study:

Because a hematologic response to treatment with  CC-486 may be delayed, it is recommended 
that subjects receive at least 6 cycles of treatment with the IP; however, subjects may be 
discontinued from treatment at the investigator’s discretion prior to reaching the recommended minimum number of cycles for any of the reasons detailed above.  The reason for discontinuation 
should be recorded in the CRF and in the source documents.
8.3. Method of Treatment Assignment
Subjects will be enrolled via IRTS to ensure time ly registration and to facilitate subject tracking 
and IP resupply needs.
Investigator or designated site staff will be assigned password protected, coded identif ication 
numbers that give them authorization to call into the IRTS to enroll a subject.  At screening, the investigator or designated staff will call into th e IRTS and provide the requested identifying 
information for the subject.  The IRTS will then confirm the assignment of a unique subject 
number.  Once assigned to a subject, the subject number will not be reused.  If a subject is screened but not enrolled, the screen-failure must  be registered using the IRTS.  During the 
treatment phase, calls will be placed to the IRTS for each new allocation of IP to a subject, to 
acknowledge receipt of additional IP shipments to the site, and to register changes in a subject’s status (eg, drug hold, dose modification, or treatment discontinuation).  Details regarding use of 
the IRTS are found in the IRTS User Manual.

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 128 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 20198.4. Packaging and Labeling
The label(s) for IP will include sponsor name, address and telephone number, the protocol 
number, IP name, dosage form and strength (where applicable), amount of IP per container, lot 
number, expiry date (where applicable), medication identification/kit number, dosing 
instructions, storage conditions, and required caution statements and/or re gulatory statements as 
applicable. Additional information may be in cluded on the label as applicable per local 
regulations.
No blinding is applied in this study.
8.5. Clinical Supplies
The investigator(s) or designee(s) is responsible for taking an inventory of each shipment of IP 
received and comparing it with the accompanying shipping order form.  The investigator(s) or 
designee(s) will verify the accuracy of the information on the form and call the IRTS to register 
the IP received at the site.  
At the study site, all IP will be stored according to the storage conditions described on the IP 
packaging label in a locked, safe area to prevent unauthorized access.  The IP must be stored as directed on the package label at a controlled temperature, and a temperature log must be 
maintained in the source documents.
8.6. Investigational Product Accountability and Disposal 
Investigational product accountability will be assessed by the investigator or designee.  Applicable information such as lot number, tabl et or vial count, and expiration date should be 
collected, as well as information provided by the subject or the caregiver (eg, subject dosing 
diary).  
Investigational product accountability s hould be a ssessed before drug dispensing for each 
subsequent treatment cycle in the treatment phase, starting on Day 1 of Cycle 2, and at the treatment discontinuation visit.
The investigator(s) or designee(s) is responsible for accounting for all IP that is issued and 
returned by the subject during the course of the study according to applicable regulatory requirements.  Any unused IP must be return ed by a study subject and retained by the 
investigative site for accountability to be conducted  by a Celgene representative (or designee).  If 
any IP is lost or damaged, its disposition should be documented.  At periodic monitoring visits, a Celgene representative (or designee) will conduct IP accountability and address any 
discrepancies.  Upon satisfactory reconciliation of all IP, returned IP may be destroyed.  At the 
conclusion of the study, all remaining IP will be  counted, reconciled with dispensing records, 
documented, and destroyed at the clinic site or allocated drug destruction location after 
completion of drug accountability by a Celgene representative (or designee).  The Celgene 
representative (or designee) will ensure that a final report of drug accountability to the unit dose level (ie, tablet) be prepared and placed in both the investigator study file and the central clinical 
study file.
A copy of the site’s Standard Operating Pro cedure (SOP) for drug destruction may be collected 
by the sponsor (or designee).  Any revisions to a site’s destruction process must be provided and

Confidential and Propri etary 129 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019approved by the sponsor (or designee) prior to implementation of this protocol.  Any site without 
a sponsor (or designee)-approved destruction SOP and process will be required to return IP to 
Celgene. Celgene (or designee) will review with  the investigator and relevant site personnel the 
process for Investigational Product return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilities for the site versus Celgene (or designee).  
8.7. Investigational Product Compliance
Subjects will self-administer CC-486 doses in the treatment phase.  Durvalumab will be administered at the study site.  Documentation of  dosing during treatment will be recorded in a 
study-specific diary card.  Investigational product administration diary cards will be provided by 
the sponsor to study site personnel, who will in turn distribute them to study subjects.  Study site 
personnel will enter the scheduled daily doses, the number of tablets to be taken each day, and any other applicable information.  Study site personnel will review the dosing information with 
the subject (or legally aut horized re presentative) on scheduled clinic visit days.  Subjects (or 
legally authorized representative) will be asked to record IP dosing information in the diary card and to bring the diary card and unused tablets in the blister card (or the blister card packaging 
even if it is empty) with them to scheduled clinic visits (ie, prior to the start of the next treatment 
cycle).  A diary card and tablet compliance check w ill be performed by study personnel.  Diary
cards must be saved and kept with the sour ce documentation.  Study site personnel will perform 
an IP administration compliance check and record this information in the subject’s source 
documentation and on the appropriate CRF.
Administration of all IP will be recorded, including dispensing, dosing, and any changes in 
dosage administration such as interruption or reduction in dosing due to an AE.

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 130 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 20199. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS AND PROCEDURES
All prior and concomitant medications (prescri ption and non-prescription), treatments, and 
therapies taken from 28 days (4 weeks) prior to th e first dose of IP, up to 28 days after the last 
dose of CC-486 (90 days for durvalumab), or up to the last study visit, whichever date is later, 
must be recorded on the appropriate CRF.  
All prior treatments for MDS, including ESAs, thrombopoiesis-stimulating agents (TSAs), iron-
chelating agents, chemotherapy, cyto toxic therapy, investigational agents, or other medications 
considered supportive care for MDS should be recorded on the respective CRF(s) regardless of discontinuation date of treatment.
Concomitant medications should be kept to a minimum during the study.  However, if
considered necessary for the subject’s welfare and are unlikely to interfere with the IP, they may be given at the discretion of the investigator.
9.1. Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Best supportive care may be used in combination wi th study therapy if deemed necessary.  Best 
supportive care for this study includes, but is not limited to, treatment with RBC or whole blood transfusions, fresh frozen plasma transfusions, single donor or pooled donor platelet transfusions, 
antibiotic, antiviral and/or antifungal therapy, nutritional support as needed, and myeloid growth 
factors (G-CSF and GM-CSF) for subjects experiencing neutropenic infections. The use of myeloid growth factors is also allowed for secondary prophylaxis under certain conditions as 
described below.  The use of these products will be considered as concomitant treatment and 
documented as concomitant medications, therapies or procedures.  
Blood product support (RBCs and platelets) may be administered according to institutional 
standards.  RBC and platelet transfusions will be considered concomitant procedures and should 
be collected on the appropriate CRF.
Subjects who are currently using iron-chelating agents should be on a stable or decreasing dose 
for at least 8 weeks (56 days) prior to enrollment.  Initiation, modification, and/or 
discontinuation of iron-chelating agents during the treatment phase of the study is discouraged and should be discussed with the medical monitor first whenever possible.
Subjects may be administered supportive and palliative care (eg, pain control) as clinically 
indicated throughout the study.
It is recommended that an antiemetic medication such as a serotonin 5-HT
3receptor antagonist 
(eg, ondansetron) be taken 30 minutes prior to IP administration during Cycle 1 of the treatment 
phase.  If nausea/vomiting is not significant, further antiemetic prophylaxis may not be needed.  Pre-treatment or post-treatment with a serotonin 5-HT
3receptor antagonists, or other locally 
available and appropriate antiemetic medication, will be considered concomitant treatment and 
should be recorded on the appropriate CRF.
Treatment with antidiarrheal medications is recommended at the first sign of diarrhea as per the 
guidelines in Appendix H.   Pre-medication with antidia rrheal medication for subsequent doses of 
CC-486 and/or durvalumab may be appropriate.  Pre- and post-treatment with an antidiarrheal must be recorded in the CRF as concomitant medication.

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 131 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019Myeloid growth factors (G-CSF and GM-CSF) may be  given per investigator’s discretion for the 
treatment of neutropenic fever/infections as well as for secondary prophylaxis if the subject had a 
previous event of neutropenic fever/infection or neutropenia Grade 4 during the treatment phase 
of the study and the safety of the subject is considered jeopardized by subsequent episodes of neutropenic fever/infections or Grade 4 neutropenia.
For subjects who develop an ANC < 0.5 x 10
9/L (or per institutional standards), administration 
of prophylactic fluoroquinolone antibiotics ( eg, ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or other 
recognized prophylactic antibiotics may be considered and documented as a concomitantmedication on the appropriate CRF.  If neutropenic f ever/infection occurs, treatment should 
consist of a broad spectrum antibiotic, and if the investigator deems the use of a myeloid growth 
factor to be medically important, myeloid growth factors may also be administered.  Forsecondary prophylaxis with myeloid growth factors, the dose modification guidelines detailed in
Section 8.2.4 remain applicable.  Discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis with myeloid growth 
factors should be considered by the investigator as clinically appropriate.  
Concurrent systemic corticosteroids for medical conditions other than MDS are allowed, 
provided the subject is on a stable or decreasing dose for ≥ 1 week prior to the first dose of IP.  
Initiation, modi fication, and/or discontinuation of corticosteroids during the treatment phase of 
the study is discouraged and should be discussed with the medical monitor first whenever 
possible.
9.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Best supportive care for this study specifically excludes cancer surgery, immunotherapy, 
biologic therapy, radiotherapy, anticancer hormonal therapy, and systemic chemotherapy where 
the goal is to eradicate or sl ow the progression of the disease.
The following concomitant medications are specifically prohibited during the course of the 
study:
!Cytotoxic, chemotherapeutic, targeted, or investigational agents/therapies
!Azacitidine for injection, decitabine,  or other demethylating agents
!Lenalidomide, th alidomide, and other immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs)

The sections below provide an overview of the proposed statist ical considerations and analyses.
10.1. Overview
This is an open-label, randomized 2-arm study  to estimate the efficacy of CC-486 as a mono-
therapy and CC-486 + durvalumab as a combinati on therapy in subjects with MDS who fail to 
achieve an objective response to treatment with azacitidine for injection or decitabine.
The study consists of 5 phases: Screening, Safety Run-in, Randomized Treatment, Follow-up, and
Extension . The randomized treatment phase will be conducted in 2 stages, with a fut ility 
assessment planned at the completion of Stage 1 to determine whether the null hypothesis (H0: p 
<12.5%) can be rejected with 3 or more responses in Stage 1. If 3 or more responses have been 
observed before the end of Stage 1, the planne d futility assessment may be performed earlier 
than at the completion of Stage 1 to confirm the finding of responses. This earlier analysis will replace the fut ility analysis planned at the comp letion of Stage 1. This earlier fut ility assessment 
will have the same integrity as the fut ility assessment planned at the comp letion of Stage 1. An 
analysis will be performed at the completion of Stage 2 to estimate the overall response rate of treatment of all the subjects in the cohort.
The primary objective is to evaluate the treatment response with CC-486 monotherapy and 
combination therapy in this sample of subjects. The secondary objectives include the evaluation 
of overall survival, time to response, duration of responses, time to disease progression, and 
safety and tolerability of the regimen in this population. 
This section defines the subject populations for va rious statistical data an alyses, the justifications
of sample sizes for the cohorts, and the methodologies that will be used for the efficacy and
safety analyses. All statistical analyses specified in this protocol will be conducted using SAS® 
Version 9.2 or higher unless otherwise specified.
10.2. Study Population Definitions
10.2.1. Intent-to-Treat Population
The intent-to-treat population will include all enrolled subjects who received at least one dose of 
IP.
10.2.2. Modified Intent-to-Treat Population
The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) populatio n includes all ITT subjects who have at least one 
post-baseline efficacy assessment performed, met all inclusion/exclusion criteria, and received a 
minimum of one cycle of treatment.
10.2.3. Safety Population
The safety population will incl ude all enrolled subjects who have received at least 1 dose of IP 
and had at least 1 post-dose safety assessment.

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 134 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 201910.2.4. Evaluable Population
Intent-to-treat subjects who have at least 1 post-baseline efficacy assessment performed, 
experienced no major protocol deviations during the study, and have received a minimum of 1 
cycle of treatment are considered to be in the evaluable population.  This definition w ill be 
further clarified in the final statistica l analysis plan before database lock.
10.2.5. Pharmacokinetic Population
The pharmacokinetic population will include enrolled subjects who have evaluable concentration 
data to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters from at least one dose of IP.
10.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations
The sample size required will be identical for each treatment arm in each cohort and is estimated 
using the optimal design of the Simon's two-stage design method ( Simon, 1989 ). The null 
hypothesis of the response rate will be tested against a one-sided alternative. 
For each cohort, the null hypothesis of the response rate (H0: p ≤ 0.125) will be tested against the 
alternative hypothesis of th e response rate (H1: p ≥ 0.27) with a type I error rate of 10% and 80% 
power. During the first stage, 16 subjects will be accrued per cohort. If there are 2 or fewer 
responses in these 16 subjects, the cohort w ill be st opped and no further recruitment will be 
needed. Otherwise, 25 additional subjects will be accrued per cohort for a total of 41 subjects in 
each cohort. If 8 or more responses are observed in these 41 subjects, the null hypothesis will be 
rejected. 
For each cohort, in addition to the evaluation of treatment responses based on objective response 
criteria, the quality of responses will also be considered for the decision whether to continue the 
cohort to the second stage of the study. Quality of response will be assessed based on the 
magnitude of hematologic and biologic response s observed in individual subjects, with special 
consideration for response duration and will be specified with more details in the final Statist ical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).
10.4. Background and Demographic Characteristics
Subjects’ age, height, weight, and baseline char acteristics will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics, while gender, race and other categorical variables will be provided using frequency 
tabulations.  Medical history data will be summarized using frequency tabulations by system organ class and preferred term.
10.5. Subject Disposition
Subject disposition (analysis population allocat ion, entered, discontinued, along with primary 
reason for discontinuation) will be summarized using frequency and percentage for both 
treatment and follow-up phases.  A summary of subjects enrolled by site will be provided. 
Protocol deviations will be summarized using frequency tabulations.
10.6. Efficacy Analysis
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population.

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 135 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019Supportive efficacy analyses will also be performed using the evaluable population.
10.6.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary assessment of efficacy will be the overall rate of response (defined as CR, PR, or 
mCR), and HI as determined using the modified IWG 2006 response criteria for MDS(Appendix F ).  For hematologic response, CR, PR, and mCR will be determined by investigator
assessment (with confirmation by central reviewer), while HI will be derived.  The percentage of 
subjects with the other response outcomes of stable disease, failure, relapse after CR or PR, and disease progression will also be presented.  Percentages will also be presented separately for CR, 
PR, mCR, and HI.
The percent of responders will be estimated using 95% confidence intervals for proportions.  Hematologic response (Complete R emission [CR], Partial Remission [PR], Marrow CR [mCR], 
Stable Disease [SD], Failure, Relapse after CR or PR, and Cytogenetic Response) is defined 
according to modified IWG 2006 criteria ( Appendix F ).  Subjects will be classified according to 
their best response achieved during treatment for the response categories of CR, PR, mCR, SD, 
and failure.  Only subjects who achieve CR or PR will be included in the Relapse after CR or PR 
category.  Subjects will be evaluated for cytogenetic response regardless of their response status in other categories.  For cytogenetic response, s ubjects will be classified as having a complete or 
partial response based on the best response ach ieved during treatment.  Hematologic response 
will be presented descriptively using counts and percentages. 
The response rates at the end of Stage 2 and the associated 95% confidence interval will be 
estimated for each cohort which completes Stage 2. Similar estimates for Stage 1 w ill be 
provided for any cohort which does not  continue to Stage 2. The response rates at the end of 
Stage 2 will be compared between c ohorts of SD and PD subjects (if both cohorts finished   
Stage 2) using the relative risk ratio or ot her appropriate methods. Specifically, if relative risk 
method is used, the ratio of response rates for both cohorts and the associated 95% confidence interval will be estimated. 
10.6.2. Secondary Efficacy Analyses
10.6.2.1. Overall Survival
Overall survival (OS), time to death from any cause, will be calculated using date of first dose 
and date of death, or date of last follow-up for censored subjects. Time to death from any cause is defined as the time between first dose and death from any cause. All subjects will be followed 
until drop-out, death, or study termination. Drop-out  may be due to withdrawal of consent from 
further data collection or loss to follow-up. Subjects who drop-out or are alive at study termination will have their OS times censored at the time of last contact, as appropriate.  The OS 
curve will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) method.  
10.6.2.2. Time to Onset of Response
Time to onset of first response is defined as the time between the date of first IP dose and the 
earliest date any response (CR, PR, mCR, or HI) is first observed.  Subjects who do not achieve any defined response during the treatment period will be censored at the date of treatment 
discontinuation, disease progression, or death, whichever occurs first.  Time to onset of best

for the treatment group w ill be est imated using KM method.  
10.6.2.3. Duration of Response
Duration of hematologic response/improvement will be determined only for subjects who 
achieve a response on treatment.  Duration of hematologic response/improvement is defined as 
the time from the date response/improvement is first observed until the date the subject has a 
subsequently documented relapse or disease progression as defined by the modified IWG 2006 criteria.  Subjects who maintain hematologic response/improvement through the end of the 
treatment period will be censored at the date of treatment discontinuation or death, whichever 
occurs first.  Duration of response will be assessed for both first response and best response.  Duration of hematologic response/improvement for the treatment group w ill be es timated using 
KM method.
10.6.2.4. Progression-free Survival
Progression-free survival (PFS), time to disease progression or death from any cause, will be 
calculated using date of first dose of IP and the earliest of date of disease progression or date of death, or date of last follow-up for censored subjects. Time to disease progression or death from 
any cause is defined as the time between first dose and the earliest of disease progression or 
death from any cause. All subjects will be followed until drop-out, death, or study termination. Drop-out may be due to withdrawal of consen t from further data collection or loss to follow-up. 
Subjects who drop-out or are alive without disease progression at study termination will have 
their PFS times censored at the time of last contact, as appropriate.  The PFS curve will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) method.
10.6.2.5. Stable Disease
!A subject will be considered as having a stable disease if the disease neither 
responded nor progressed during or after the treatment. 
!The duration of stable disease will be defined as the time between any two 
observations of objective disease progression (modified IWG criteria – Appendix F ), 
starting from the first day of dosing wi th IP.  Note, objective disease progression 
requires two observations demonstrating progressive disease, at least 8 weeks apart.  
The date of disease progression will be th at of the earliest observation that is not 
followed by a discordant observation within the subsequent 8 weeks.  
!Subjects who maintain stable disease through the end of the treatment period will be 
censored at the date of study termination.  
!Duration of stable disease will be estimated using KM method.
10.6.2.6. Disease Progression to AML
!Time to AML progression is defined as the time from the date of first dose of IP until 
the date the subject has documented progression to AML. 
!Subjects who do not progress to AML will be censored at the date of last follow-up, 
the date of death, or the date of study termination.

10.7. Safety Analysis
The safety population will be used for all safety evaluations.
Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
Adverse event listings will include the verbatim term and the MedDRA preferred term.  Adverse 
events will be summarized by worst severity grade. Adverse events, as well as treatment-emergent AEs, will be summarized by system organ class, and preferred term.  Adverse events 
leading to death or to discontinuation from treatment, events classified as NCI CTCAE (Version 
4.03) Grade 3 or Grade 4, adverse events related to IP, serious adverse events and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) will be su mmarized separately.  
Clinical laboratory results will be summarized descri ptively and will include a display of change 
from baseline.  Laboratory values outside of th e normal ranges will be identified.  Clinically 
significant hematologic and non-hematologic la boratory abnormalities that meet Grade 3 or 
Grade 4 criteria according to the CTCAE will be listed and summarized. 
Vital sign measurements will be listed for each subject at each visit.  Descriptive statistics for 
vital signs, both observed values and changes from baseline, will be summarized.
10.8. Interim Analysis
An Independent Data Monitoring Co mmit tee will review the safety data during the safety run-in 
phase. The committee will also review the efficacy and safety data during the randomized phase 
of the study, in addition to the recommendation for any cohort to continue to Stage 2 of the 
study. The details of the data monitoring plan will be provided in a separate charter document.

maximum, percent coefficient of variation, geometric mean, and geometric percent coefficient of 
variation) for each cycle, if/when appropriate.  Concentrations that are below the limit of quantification (BLQ) will be treated as zero for the computation of descriptive statistics. Missing 
concentrations and concentrations from blood s amples coll ected more than ± 10% of nominal 
time will be omitted from the calculation of descriptive statistics.

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 138 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019Individual subject concentration-time data and mean concentration-time data for each cycle will 
be graphically presented on linear and semi-logarithmic scales.
Following single dose administration, predose samples that are BLQ or missing will be assigned 
a numerical value of zero for the calculation of AUC .  Any anomalous concentration values 
observed at predose will be identified in the clinical study report and used for the computation of 
AUC.  Pharmacokinetic parameters will be computed if the anomalous value is not greater than 
5% of the C max.  If the anomalous value is greater than 5% of C max, the computed 
pharmacokinetic parameters for the given subject will be dropped from the pharmacokinetic 
analysis.  
Any other BLQ concentrations will be assigned a value of zero if they precede quantifiable 
samples in the initial portion of the profile.  A BLQ value that occurs between quantifiable data 
points, especially prior to C max, will be evaluated to determine if an assigned concentration of 
zero makes sense, or if reanalysis or exclusion of the data is warranted.  Following C max, BLQ 
values embedded between 2 quantifiable data points will be treated as missing when calculating 
AUC.  BLQ values occurring at the end of the collection interval (after the last quantifiable 
concentration) will be treated as missing data.  If consecutive BLQ concentrations are followed by quantifiable concentrations in the terminal portion of the concentration curve, these quantified 
values will be excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis by assigning them a value of missing, 
unless otherwise warranted by the concentrat ion-time profile.  For the purpose of analysis, these 
trailing BLQ values may be designated as zero in the dataset if the pharmacokinetic program 
used to do the analysis (such as WinNonlin
®) will treat trailing zero values as missing when 
calculating AUC.
Actual sampling times will be used in the calcu lations of pharmacokinetic parameters that will be 
derived using noncompartmental methods with Phoenix™ WinNonlin®Professional Version 6.3, 
or higher, (Pharsight®, a Certara™ company, St. Louis, Missouri).  Graphics may be prepared 
with SAS Version 9.1, or higher; or Excel 2007, or higher; Phoenix™ WinNonlin®Professional 
6.3, or higher; or S-Plus 8.2., or hi gher (MS MIAMI, Miami, Florida).
10.9.2.2. Pharmacokinetic Parameters
The following PK parameters will be calculated for CC-486:
AUC inf Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from Time 0 
extrapolated to infinity, calculated as [AUC t+ Ct/∋z].  Ct is the last 
quantifiable concentration. No AUC extrapolation will be performed 
with unreliable ∋z.  If AUC %Extrap is ≥25%, AUC inf will not be 
reported
AUC t Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from Time 0 to the time 
of the last quantifiable concentration, calculated by linear trapezoidal 
method when concentrations are increasing and the logarithmic trapezoidal method when concentrations are decreasing.
C

terminal portion of the log-concentration versus time curve in plasma.  
Visual assessment will be used to identify the terminal linear phase of the concentration versus time profile.  A minimum of three data points 
will be used for calculation.  
∋z will not be estimated if the terminal phase of the log-concentration 
versus time profile does not exhibit a linear decline phase, or if the 
regression coefficient < 0.8.

pharmacokinetic parameters will also be summarized using descriptive statistics (N, arithmetic 
mean, standard deviation, standard error, minimum, median, maximum, percent coefficient of variation, geometric mean, and geometric percent coefficient of variation) for each cycle.  Also, 
when appropriate, graphical representations (ie, scatter plots, box plots, etc) may be used to

Confidential and Propri etary 140 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 201911. ADVERSE EVENTS
11.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may 
appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a 
worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject’s health, 
including laboratory test values (as specified by the criteria in Section 11.3), regardless of 
etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or 
intensity of a pre-existing condition) should be  considered an AE.  A diagnosis or syndrome 
should be recorded on the AE page of the CRF rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. 
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported as an
AE. Overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be reported on the overdose CRF. (See Section 8.2.6 for the definition of overdose.) Any sequelae
of an accidental or intentional overdose of an investigational product should be reported as an 
AE on the AE CRF. If the sequelae of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequelae must be reported on an SAE report form and on the AE CRF. The overdose resulting in the SAE should 
be identified as the cause of the event on the SAE report form and CRF but should not be 
reported as an SAE itself.
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive 
supportive measures as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for CC-486 or 
durvalumab overdose. Actual treatment should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician.
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study.  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all of the following parameters:  the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, pathological, radiological or surgical findings , physical examination findings, or findings from 
other tests and/or procedures.
All AEs will be recorded by the investigator from the time the subject signs informed consent 
until 28 days after the last dose of CC-486, 90 days  after the last dose of durvalumab, or until the 
Treatment Discontinuation Visit, whichever is later and those SAEs made known to the 
investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP.   Adverse events and 
SAEs will be recorded on the AE page of the CRF and in the subject’s source documents.  All 
SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge 
of the event by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
11.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to: 
11.2.1. Seriousness

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 141 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019!Is life-threatening (ie, in the opinion of the investigator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE);
!Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization 
(hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay);
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions);
!Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
!Constitutes an important medical event.
Important medical events are defined as thos e occurrences that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death, hospitalization, or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizations for:
!The administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied 
indication.  However, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a comp lication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
!A procedure for protocol/disease-related investigations (eg, surgery, scans, 
endoscopy, sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling).  However, 
hospitalization or prolonged hosp italization for a complication of such procedures 
remains a reportable SAE.
!Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization for technical, practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an AE.
!A procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to starting of treatment on st udy); must 
be documented in the source document and the CRF.  Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication remains a reportable SAE.
!An elective treatment of or an elective pr ocedure for a pre-existing condition 
unrelated to the studied indication. 
!Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the CRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.
For each SAE, the investigator will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to IP, action taken regarding IP, and outcome.
11.2.2. Severity / Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator must assess the severity / intensity of the event.

EDMS Doc. Number: CC-486 (Oral Azacitidine)
Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 142 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019The severity / intensity of AEs will be grade d based upon the subject’s symptoms according to 
the current active minor version of the Commo n Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE, Version 4.03).
AEs that are not defined in the CTCAE should  be evaluated for severity / intensity according to 
the following scale:
!Grade 1 = Mild – transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required
!Grade 2 = Moderate – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may 
be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required
!Grade 3 = Severe – marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; 
medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization is possible
!Grade 4 = Life threatening – extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance 
required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization or hospice care probable
!Grade 5 = Death - the event results in death
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is notthe same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.  
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a gui de for defining regulatory obligations.
11.2.3. Causality 
The investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of IP and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: Means a causal relationship of the adverse event to IP 
administration is unlikely or remote , or other medications, 
therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a 
sufficient explanation for the observed event.
Suspected: Means there is a reasonable possibility that the administration 
of IP caused the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibility’ means 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and the adverse event.
Causality s hould be a ssessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available 
information.  Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes available.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or additional IP 
that has not been manufactured or provided by Celgene, please provide the name of the manufacturer when reporting the event.

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 143 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 201911.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.
11.2.5. Action Taken
The investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable 
(eg, discontinuation, interruption, or reduction of IP, as appropriate) and report if concomitant and/or additional treatments were given for the event. 
11.2.6. Outcome
The investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study 
must be followed until recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered or death (due to the 
SAE). 
11.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:
!results in discontinuation from the study;
!requires treatment, modification/ interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic 
intervention; or
!is judged to be of significant clinical importance.
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory a bnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.  
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF.  If the abnormality was not a 
part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the labor atory abnormality should be recorded as the AE. If 
possible, the laboratory abnormality should be r ecorded as a medical term and not simply as an 
abnormal laboratory result (eg, record throm bocytopenia rather than decreased platelets).
11.4. Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in either a female subject or partner of a 
male subject are immediately reportable events.
11.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential:
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or 
disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on IP, or within 90 days of the 
subject’s last dose of IP, are considered immediately reportable events.  IP is to be discontinued 
immediately and the subject instructed to return any unused portion of the IP to the investigator.  The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene 
Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Initial 
Report Form, or approved equivalent form.

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 144 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist, preferably one 
experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.  
The investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or 
abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follo w-up Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the investigator 
should report the abnormal outcome as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Ce lgene Drug Safety by facsimile, or other appropriate 
method, within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report 
Form, or approved equivalent form.
All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant d eath after 28 days that the investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety by facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the 
event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
11.4.2. Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject taking IP becomes pregnant while the male subject is on IP, 
or within 90 days of the male subject’s last dose of IP, the male subject taking IP should notify 
the investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call their healthcare provider immed iately.  Where applicable, the IP may need to be discontinued in the male subject, 
but may be resumed later at the discreti on of the investigator and medical monitor.
11.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF. All SAEs must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  This 
instruction pertains to initial SAE repo rts as well as any follow-up reports.
The investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) that occur during the study 
from the time the subject signs informed consent until 28 days after the last dose of CC-486, 90 
days after the last dose of durvalumab, or until the Treatment Discontinuation Visit, whichever is later, and any SAE made known to the investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of 
being related to IP.  SAEs occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be collected.
The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include a concise summary
of hospital records and other relevant documents.  If a subject died and an autopsy has been 
performed, copies of the autopsy report and d eath certificate are to be sent to Celgene Drug 
Safety as soon as these become available.  Any follow-up data should be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Celgene Drug Safety.  
Where required by local legislation, the investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/EC of 
the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow-up information about the event.

Confidential and Propri etary 145 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019The investigator must keep copies of all SAE information on file including correspondence with 
Celgene and the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC).
11.5.1. Safety Queries
Queries pertaining to SAEs will be communicated from Celgene Drug Safety to the site via 
facsimile or electronic mail.  The response time is expected to be no more than five (5) business 
days.  Urgent queries (eg, missing causality assessment) may be handled by phone.
11.6. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events
For the purpose of regulatory reporting, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the expectedness of events suspected of being related to CC-486 based on the Investigator’s Brochure.
In the United States, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be 
reported in an expedited manner in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.
For countries within the European Economic Area (EEA), Celgene or its authorized 
representative will report in an expedited manner to Regulatory Authorities and Ethics 
Committees concerned, SUSARs in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC and the Detailed 
Guidance on collection, verification and presentation of adverse reaction reports arising from 
clinical trials on investigational products for human use (ENTR/CT3) and also in accordance with country-specific requirements.  
For the purpose of regulatory reporting in the EEA, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the 
expectedness of events suspected of being related to the other IP, durvalumab, based on the Durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure for the product.
Celgene or its authorized repres entative shall notify the investigator of the following information 
!Any AE suspected of being related to the use of IP in this study or in other studies 
that is both serious and unexpected (ie, SUSAR);
!Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for 
human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.
Where required by local legislation, the investigator shall notify his/her IRB/EC promptly of 
these new serious and unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to subjects.
The investigator must keep copies of all pertinent safety information on file including 
correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/EC.  (See Section 15.3 for record retention 
information).
Celgene Drug Safety Contact Information:
For Celgene Drug Safety contact information, please refer to the Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form Completion Guidelines or to the Pregnancy Report Form Completion Guidelines.
11.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest
An adverse event of special interest is one of scientific and medical interest specific to 
understanding of the IP and may require close monitoring and rapid communication by the 
investigator to the sponsor. An AESI may be serious or non-serious. The rapid reporting of

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 146 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand them 
in association with the use of these IPs.
AESIs for durvalumab include but are not limited to events with a potential inflammatory or 
immune-mediated mechanism and which may require more frequent monitoring and/or interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants and/or hormone replacement therapy. These 
AESIs are being closely monitored in clinical  studies with durvalumab monotherapy and 
combination therapy. An immune-mediated adverse ev ent (imAE) is defined as an adverse event 
that is associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism of 
action and where there is no clear alternate etiology. Serologic, immunologic, and histologic 
(biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used to support an imAE diagnosis. Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectio us, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of 
the imAE.
If the investigator has any questions in regards to an adverse event (AE) being an imAE, the 
investigator should promptly contact the Medical Monitor.
Further information on these AESIs (eg presenting symptoms) can be found in the current 
version of the Durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure (section 5.4.2 Summary of Risks).
11.7.1. Progression to AML
Progression to AML will be monitored as an event o f special interest and must be reported as an 
SAE regardless of causal relationship to IP, occurring at any time for the duration of the study, from the time of signing the ICD until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent for further 
data collection, or study closure.

Confidential and Propri etary 147 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 201912. DISCONTINUATIONS
The following events are considered sufficient reasons for discontinuing a subject from the 
investigational product and/or from the study:
!Lack of Efficacy
!Progressive Disease
!Withdrawal by Subject
!Adverse Event
!Death
!Loss to Follow-up
!Protocol Violation
!Study Terminated by Sponsor
!Pregnancy
!Recovery
!Non-compliance with IP
!Transition to commercially available treatment
!Physician decision
!Disease relapse
!Symptomatic deterioration
!Protocol violation
!Other (to be specified on the eCRF)
Definitions for progressive disease to be applied under different circumstances (eg, following a 
RBC-transfusion-independent respons e to treatment) are provided in Table 8 , below.  Although 
lack of efficacy or progressive disease is considered a sufficient reason for discontinuing a subject from IP, the investigator should continue to treat the subject until the investigator 
considers IP to be no longer beneficial to the subject, or the change of disease state renders the 
subject unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. Because a hematologic response to treatment with CC-486 may be delayed, it is recommended that subjects 
receive at least 6 cycles of treatment with the IP; however, subjects may be discontinued from 
treatment at the investigator’s discretion prior to reaching the recommended minimum number of cycles for any of the reasons detailed above.  
The decision to discontinue a subject, which will not be delayed or refused by the sponsor, 
remains the responsibility of the treating physician.  However, prior to discontinuing a subject, it 
is recommended that the investigator contact the medical monitor and forward appropriate 
supporting documents for review and discussion.
The reason for discontinuation should be recorded in the CRF and in the source document for all 
enrolled sub jects, regardless of whether they are dosed or not.

documentation of this study are designed to ens ure that Celgene, its authorized representative, 
and investigator abide by GCP, as described in International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will receive approval from an IRB/EC prior to commencement. The 
investigator will conduct all aspects of this study  in accordance with applicable national, state, 
and local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities.
14.2. Investigator Responsibilities
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in the local regulations.  Celgene staff or an authorized representative will evaluate and approve all 
investigators who in turn will select their staff.
The investigator should ensure that all persons assi sting with the study are adequately informed 
about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study-related duties and functions. The investigator should maintain a list of sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified 
persons to whom he or she has delegated significant study-related duties.
The investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all subjects who sign an informed consent 
document and are screened for entry into the study.  Subjects who fail screening must have the 
reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents.
The investigator, or a designated member of th e investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records (eg, 
medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study-related charts) for source data 
verification.  The investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of CRFs and queries.
14.3. Subject Information and Informed Consent
The investigator must obtain informed consent of a subject and/or a subject’s legal representative 
prior to any study related procedures.
Documentation that informed consent occurred prio r to the study subject’s entry into the study 
and of the informed consent process should be recorded in the study subject’s source documents 
including the date.  The original ICD signed and dated by the study subject and by the person 
consenting the study subject prior to  the study subject’s entry into  the study, must be maintained 
in the investigator’s study files and a copy given to the study subject.  In addition, if a protocol is 
amended and it impacts on the content of the inform ed consent, the ICD must be revised.  Study 
subjects participating in the study when the amended protocol is implemented must be re-
consented with the revised version of the ICD.  The revised informed consent document signed 
and dated by the study subject and by the pe rson consenting the study subject must be 
maintained in the investigator’s study files and a copy given to the study subject.

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 151 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 201914.4. Confidentiality
Celgene affirms the subject's right to protection against invasion of privacy and to be in 
compliance with ICH and other local regulations (whichever is most stringent). Celgene requires 
the investigator to permit Celgene's representatives and, when necessary, representatives from 
regulatory authorities, to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in 
accordance with local laws.
Should direct access to medical records require  a waiver or authorization separate from the 
subject’s signed informed consent document, it is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain such permission in writing from the appropriate individual.
14.5. Protocol Amendments
Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by the Celgene Clinical Research Physician/medical monit or.  Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval.  
Written approval must be obtained before implement ation of the amended version occurs.  The 
written signed approval from the IRB/EC should  specifically reference the investigator name, 
protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is applicable. Amendments that are administrative in nature do not require IRB/EC approval but will be submitted to the IRB/EC for 
information purposes.
14.6. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review 
and Approval
Before the start of the study, the study protocol , informed consent document, and any other 
appropriate documents will be submitted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a form listing the 
documents submitted, their dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable) for which approval is sought. If applicable,  the documents will also be submitted to 
the authorities in accordance with local legal requirements.
IP can only be supplied to an investigator by Celgene or its authorized representative after 
documentation on all eth ical and legal requirements for starting the study has been received by 
Celgene or its authorized repre sentative. This documentation must also include a list of the 
members of the IRB/EC and their occupation and qualifications. If the IRB/EC will not disclose the names, occupations and qualifications of the committee members, it should be asked to issue 
a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accordance with GCP. For 
example, the IRB General Assurance Number may be accepted as a substitute for this list. Formal approval by the IRB/EC should mention the protocol title, number, amendment number 
(if applicable), study site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable), and any other 
documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision was made and must beofficially signed by a commi ttee membe r. Before the first subject is enrolled in the study, all 
ethical and legal requirements must be met.
The IRB/EC and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol 
amendments in accordance with local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to 
determine whether formal approval must be sought and whether the informed consent document 
should also be revised.

between a c oordinating invest igator and the IRB/EC. This statement also applies to any 
communication between the investigator (or coordinating investigator, if applicable) and 
regulatory authorities.
Any advertisements used to rec ruit subjects for the study must be reviewed by Celgene and the 
IRB/EC prior to use.  
14.7. Ongoing Information for Institutional Review Board / Ethics 
Committee
If required by legislation or the IRB/EC, the investigator must submit to the IRB/EC:
!Information on serious or unexpected adverse events as soon as possible; 
!Periodic reports on the progress of the study;
!Deviations from the protocol or anything th at may involve added risk to subjects.
14.8. Closure of the Study
Celgene reserves the right to terminate this study at any t ime for reasonable med ical or 
administrative reasons. Any premature disc ontinuation will be appropriately documented 
according to local requirements (eg, IRB/EC, regulatory authorities, etc.).
In addition, the investigator or Celgene has the right to discontinue a single site at any time 
during the study for medical or administrative reasons such as:
!Unsatisfactory enrollment;
!GCP noncompliance;
!Inaccurate or incomplete data collection;
!Falsification of records;
!Failure to adhere to the study protocol.
The sponsor may consider closing this trial when data supporting key endpoints and objectives of 
the study have been analyzed.  In the case where there are subjects in the Extension Phase
continuing to receive investigational product who, in the opinion of the investigator(s) would 
continue to receive benefit from treatment, the sponsor may choose to initiate an open-label rollover study under a separate protocol to allow these subjects to continue receiving oral 
azacitidine.

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 155 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 201916. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
All aspects of the study will be carefully moni tored by Celgene or its authorized representative 
for compliance with applicable government regulations with respect to current GCP and standard 
operating procedures.
16.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after 
the study.  All aspects of the study are reviewed with the investigator and the staff at a study 
initiation visit and/or at an investigator meeting.  Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a 
Celgene representative will review the protoc ol, CRFs, procedures for obtaining informed 
consent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs/ SAEs with the investig ator.  Monitoring will 
include on-site visits with the investigator and his/her staff as well as any appropriate 
communications by mail, email, fax, or telephone.  During monitoring visits, the facilities, investigational product storage area, CRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study 
documentation w ill be inspected/reviewed by the Celgene representative in accordance with the 
Study Monitoring Plan.
Accuracy will be checked by performing source data verification that is a direct comparison of 
the entries made onto the CRFs against the appropriate source documentation.  Any resulting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the i nvestigator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary 
corrections will be made directly to the CRFs or via queries by the investigator and/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consent documents, adherence to 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and documentation of  SAEs and their proper recording be verified.  
Additional monitoring activities may be outlin ed in a study-specific monitoring plan.
16.2. Audits and Inspections
In addition to the routine monitoring procedure s, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance 
unit exists within Celgene.  Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research 
activities in accordance with Celgene SOPs to evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Pract ice 
guidelines and regulations.
The investigator is required to permit direct acce ss to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, CRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject participation for 
audits and inspections by IRB/ECs, regulatory  authorities (eg, United States Food and Drug 
Association [FDA], European Medicines Agency [EMA], Health Canada) and company 
authorized representatives.  The investigator should make every effort to be available for the 
audits and/or inspections.  If the investigator is contacted by any regulatory authority regarding 
an inspection, he/she should contact Celgene immediately.
16.3. Product Quality Complaint
A Product Quality Compliant (PQC) is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, qualit y, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, 
purity, or performance of any drug product manufactured by or on behalf of Celgene Corporation 
after it is released for distribution. PQCs may reduce the usability of the product for its intended 
function or affect performance of the product and therefore pose a significant risk to the patient.

bModification to IWG (2000) response criteria.  
cIn some circumstances, protocol therapy may require the initiation of further treatment (eg, consolidation, maintenance) before  
the 4-week period.  Such subjects can be included in the res ponse category into which they fit at the time the therapy is start ed.  
Transient cytopenias during repeated chemotherapy courses should not be considered as interrupting durability of response, as
long as they recover to the improved counts of the previous course.
d20 – 30% blasts is considered AML according to the WHO classification ( Vardiman, 2009 ).

Functional Capacity
Class I.   Subjects with cardiac disease but without resulting limitation of physical activity.  Ordinary 
physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class II.   Subjects with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity.  They are 
comfortable at rest.  Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class III.   Subjects with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity.  They are 
comfortable at rest.  Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class IV.   Subjects with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without 
discomfort.  Symptoms of heart failure or the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest.  If any 
physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.

Confidential and Propri etary 181 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019Appendix J: Extension Phase
Upon Protocol Amendment 4 approval at the respective sites, eligible subjects can enter the 
Extension Phase.
Subject Eligibility
At the Investigator’s discretion and following c onfirmation of eligibility criteria below, subjects 
can enter the Extension Phase:
!Subjects who have signed the informed consent for the EP of the study;
!Subjects receiving oral azacitidine and continuing in the Treatment Phase 
demonstrating clinical benefit as assessed by the Investigator are eligible to receive oral azacitidine in the EP;
!Subjects who do not meet any of the criteria for study discontinuation (see 
Section 12).
Treatment Assignment 
Upon approval of Amendment 4, subjects will start the EP at the start of their next regularly 
scheduled dosing cycle for oral azacitidine and align the Cycle XDay 1 visit with the Treatment 
Discontinuation Visit ( X= most recent cycle during the treatment phase), so they occur on the 
same day.  The dose and schedule will follow the study treatment administration and schedule
(Section 8.2). Subjects will remain at the same dose levels from the main study during the 
Extension Phase and may decrease dose levels following dose modifications (Section 8.2.4 );
however, dose levels will not increase. Any potential dose escalation will be considered a 
treatment failure and the s ubject will be discontinued.
Cycles should be repeated every 28 days.  Subjects should be monitored locally for hematology 
and chemistry testing, pregnancy testing for FCBP and dose- limiting toxicities be fore the dosing 
of the next cycle. Dosage delay or reduction as described below may be necessary.
Management of Toxicities and Dose Modifications
Subjects should be monitored for toxicity usi ng the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.03), as a guide for the grading of 
severity.  If a certain level of toxicity is obse rved and considered by the Investigator to be at least 
possibly related to treatment, IP dosing may be interrupted, delayed or modified.  In all cases, the 
reason for dose modification must be recorded in the subject’s medical record and corresponding 
eCRF page.  If the subject discontinues the protocol-prescribed therapy because of an AE, this event must be reported in accordance with the procedures outlined in Section 12.
Oral azacitidine dose modifications due to nonhematological and hematological toxicities during 
oral azacitidine treatment should be managed as described in Section 8.2.4 for dose modification 
guidelines due to toxicity.
Any potential dose escalation will be consider ed a treatment failure a nd the sub ject w ill be 
discontinued.
Adverse Events
Adverse events (non-serious and serious) will continue to be collected in the CRF.

Protocol CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 182 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 4.0 Final: 17 Jun 2019For subjects entering the EP, ongoing AEs at the time of the Treatment Discontinuation Visit (in 
the main study) should be left as ongoing and should not be recorded again in the EP AE CRF.  
Adverse events with an onset date equal to or after the EP informed consent date should be 
recorded in the EP AE CRF.  If a previously reported AE worsens during the EP, then the AE should be recorded as a new AE with a higher grade on the EP AE CRF. All subjects will be 
monitored for AEs for 28 days following the date of last dose of IP. Any SAEs that have not 
resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study must be followed until recovered (return to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to the SAE).  Refer to 
Section 11Adverse Events for reporting requirements, responsibilities and procedures.
Concomitant Medications
All concomitant medications that are necessary for the subject’s welfare may be given at the 
Investigator’s discretion during the EP and recorded in the CRF.  However, treatment with any 
other investigational medication is not permitted.  Refer to Section 9for prohibited concomitant 
medications/therapy for subjects on oral azacitidine.
Survival Follow-up
No Survival Follow-up will be required for any subjects in the EP.
Monitoring of Subjects
The monitoring of subjects is to be conducted as per the local standard of care, and include at 
least:
!Complete blood count with WBC differential and platelet c ount as required, and at a 
minimum, prior to each dosing cycle
!For FCBP, pregnancy testing must be done and have a negative result prior to 
initiating a new cycle
!Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate as clinically indicated
!Additional tests or more frequent monitoring are at the Investigator’s discretion based 
on the subject’s clinical status.
Investigator’s Responsibility 
!Obtain subject’s signature of the informed consent form to enter the EP phase
!Monitoring of subjects (listed above) 
!Complete Extension Phase case report form pages
!Document all adverse events (serious and non-serious) on the adverse event log page 
of the Extension Phase CRF as required by the protocol (Section 8.2.4 )
!Report serious adverse events and other immediately reportable events, as required by 
the protocol (see Section 11).  A completed SAE form must be faxed to Celgene Drug 
Safety, as detailed in the Serious Adverse Event Report Form Completion Guidelines, immediately (ie, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event)
!Dispensing and accountability of drug including patient drug diary cards

the subject terminates treatment with oral azacitidine.
!The subject should stop treatment with oral azacitidine if any of the following occur:
∀Additional investigational treatment is started;
∀Subject is no longer receiving clinical benefit, as per the Investigator’s discretion;
∀Subject has any AE which would result in  treatment discontinuation as per the 
Investigator’s discretion
∀Subject withdraws consent;
∀A positive pregnancy test in a FCBP, at any time; or
∀At the specific request of the sponsor or its authorized representative.
!The Investigator must be available for periodic monitoring visits and allow the 
sponsor access to all medical records.
!The Investigator will maintain source documen ts for subjects entering the EP for all 
case report form data points, which include the following:
∀Informed consent;
∀Adverse events (including serious adverse events);
∀Dosing information (date of administration, dose, number of tablets used, and lot 
number); 
∀Concomitant medications; and
∀Termination date and reason.
Statistical Methods  
Safety evaluation for the EP will include monitoring for adverse events and recording of 
concomitant medications. Although physical examinations, vital sign measurements and 
laboratory assessments will be performed in the EP, these assessments will not be captured in the CRF.  However, clinically significant findings from these assessments which meet the definition 
of an adverse event (see Section 11) will be reported as adverse events.  Adverse events will be 
summarized as per Section 10.7 on the subjects entering the EP.  Exposure to oral azacitidine as 
well as concomitant med ications taken during the EP will also be summarized.

potential closure of the study will be met shortly. Also in line with this section, Celgene is 
adding an Extension Phase for all currently active subjects who are receiving treatment and opt 
to continue with CC-486. 
Study enrollment was closed on 29 Jun 2018. Enrollment in the Phase 1 safety run-in portion for 
CC-486 Monotherapy was completed with 13 subjects in the Phase 1 CC-486 Monotherapy
cohort on 07 Sep 2017. The Phase 1 Combination Therapy Cohort was stopped on 16 Jan 2018 due to challenges in finding the optimal combination dose. The Phase 2 Monotherapy SD and PD 
cohorts fully enrolled for Stage 1 in Dec ember 2017 and June 2018, respectively. However, the 
minimal number of responses required to proceed to  Stage 2 was not met and the Phase 2 cohorts 
were closed on 29 Jun 2018. Six subjects are ongoing in the Monotherapy SD/PD cohorts.
Per protocol, the primary analysis will be conducted once all subjects enrolled have completed 
12 months of treatment or have discontinued be fore reaching 12 months of treatment, whichever 
occurs first.
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
!A description of the Extension Phase is presented in Appendix J and mentioned 
throughout the protocol. The overall duration of the study will be extended during the Extension Phase.  
∀Revised sections:  Protocol Summary, Sections 4.1.6 Extension Phase, and 6.15 
Extension Phase, Figure 1, Table 2 (Table of Events) and Appendix J: Extension 
Phase; and other editorial changes in the protocol for the extension phase.
The amendment also includes other minor clarifications and corrections:
!Protocol Summary and Section 4.1: Information was updated on enrollment closure, 
the Extension Phase, and the number of subjects who are ongoing.
!Section 4.1.7, 4.4, and 14.8: Language was added on the timing of study closure.
!Section 4.3: Total study duration was updated to include the Extension Phase.
!Section 8.1.1: The available CC- 486 supply was modified due to current subjects only 
taking 100 mg tablets. “After Amendment 4 approval, the CC-486 supply will be 
limited to 100-mg tablets for oral administration.”
!Section 8.2.4: Restrictions were added to dose increase modifications during the 
Extension Phase.
!Section 11.6: The following text was deleted: “Adve rse events such as death related 
to disease progression (in the absence of serious IP-related events) and serious events due to the relapse of the studied indication will not be subject to expedited reporting by the sponsor to regulatory authorities.  These events will be captured as AEs on the 
CRF, reported to Celgene Drug Safety meeting SAE reporting criteria (within 24 
hours) and reported to regulatory authorities in the annual report.” 
The amendment also includes several othe r minor clarifications and typographical corrections.

Summary of Changes CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 3 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 3 Final: 28 Dec 20171. JUSTIFICATION FOR AMENDMENT
This protocol was amended as follows:
!Protocol text was updated to allow the dose  escalation of CC-486 after 2 well-tolerated 
cycles (instead of 4 cycles).  The safety assessment observed in the Phase 1 safety run-in 
portion of the trial was based on 2 dosing cycles  and most adverse events occurred early 
in these cycles. Thus, it is reasonable that in the absence of unacceptable toxicity, subjects who show signs of worsening dis ease (clinical or hematological), who remain in 
stable disease, or do not experience modified International Working Group (IWG) 2006 
hematologic improvement (HI) or better (partial response [PR], complete response [CR]or marrow CR – modified IWG 2006) can dos e escalate after 2 well-tolerated cycles.
We have also added the text “who remain in stable disease” for clarity that stable disease 
patients may also dose escalate after 2-well tolerated cycles. 
Revised sections include Section 4.1.3 Randomized Treatment Phase, Section 6.5 CC-
486 (Oral Azacitidine), Secti on 8.2 Treatment Administration and Schedule, and Section 
8.2.4.1 CC-486 (Or al Azacitidine) Dose Modification and Toxicity Management.
!The dosing modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines have been updated for 
consistency with recommendations in the most recent Durvalumab Investigator’s 
Brochure Edition 12.
Revised sections: Table 5: Durvalumab Treatment Modification and Toxicity 
Management Guidelines for Immune-Mediated Adverse Events, Table 6: Durvalumab Treatment Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Infusion-Related 
Reactions, and Table 7:  Durvalumab Tr eatment Modification and Toxicity Management 
Guidelines for Non-Immune-Mediated Reactions.
!To be consistent with the Durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure Edition 12, the term 
“immune-related adverse event (abbreviated as irAE) has been changed to “immune-
mediated adverse event” (abbreviated as imAE) throughout the protocol text.
Sections revised include Protocol Summary, Section 4.1.2.2 Durvalumab / CC-486

This protocol is being amended to address Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Principal
Investigator comments which have been endorsed by the Study Steering Committee.   
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
!Primary objective wording was updated to remove the text “the most recent” treatment 
with a prior injectable hypomethylating agent (iHMA) for MDS to provide clarity that 
subjects in this trial need  to have failed all prior tr eatments with iHMA and not just “the 
most recent” treatment.  There is no impact expected regarding study population or 
outcome.  Also, please note that this clarif ication does not change  the overall primary 
objective and no text changes were needed per Section 2.1 Primary Objective.  
Revised sections: Protocol Summar y, Section 4.1.3 Randomized Treatment Phase,
Section 6.1.1 MDS Diagnosis, WHO and FAB C lassifications and IPSS (-R) Risk 
Classification, and Section 7.2 Inclusion Criteria (criterion number 4).
!Updates were made to detail that the fut ility analysis may be performed ear lier in Stage 1 
if 3 or more responders are observed prior to the enrollment of 16 subjects.  This update will not change what was originally intended for the fut ility analysis, but is intended to 
expedite subject enrollment in the event we do have early responders. Also, to 
emphasize, we will wait for the last subject’s response result in Stage 2 to perform the final overall analysis (rate of response) for that specific cohort.  Each of the 4 cohorts will 
be analyzed separately. 
The protocol language will read as follows:“The randomized treatment phase will be conducted in 2 stages, with a fut ility assessment 
planned at the completion of Stage 1 to determine whether the null hypothesis (H0: p 
<12.5%) can be rejected with 3 or more responses in Stage 1.  If 3 or more responses have been observed before the end of Stage 1, the planned fut ility assessment may be 
performed earlier than at the completion of Stage 1 to confirm the finding of responses. 
This earlier analysis will replace the fut ility analysis planned at the completion of Stage 
1. This earlier fut ility assessment w ill have the same integrity as the fut ility assessment 
planned at the completion of Stage 1. An anal ysis will be performed at the completion of 
Stage 2 to estimate the overall response rate of treatment of all the subjects in the cohort”.
Revised sections:  Protocol Summary,  Section 4.1 Study De sign, and Section 10.1 
Overview.
Also, protocol language will read as follows:“A subject is considered evaluable for respons e once they have one  cycle of treatment 
with a maximum of 6 cycles of treatment”.
Revised section:  Section 4.1.3 Randomized Treatment Phase
!The enrollment period and total trial duration were extended due to the length of the CC-
486 safety run-in, which required the enrollment and monitoring of additional subjects 
due to gastrointestinal intolerab ility. E nrollment was extended from “a pproximately 24

“approximately 36 months” to “approximately 47 months”.  
Revised sections: Protocol Summary and Section 4.3 Study Duration.
!Updated the section reference from Section 8.2.5 to Section 4.1.3 for those who derive 
benefit from treatment with investigational product (IP) as Section 4.1.3 better defines this item.
Revised sections: Protocol Summary and Section 8.2 Treatment Administration and 
Schedule.
!Updates were made to remove references to specifically defined adverse events of special 
interest (AESIs) and to instead refer to the Durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure, Section 
5.4.2 Summary of Risks. This change was made as durvalumab safety profile is still evolving and AESIs are subject to change. 
Protocol Summary, Section 4.1.3 Randomized  Treatment Phase, Section 4.1.5.1. Follow-
Up in Subjects Receiving CC-486 Monothe rapy, Section 4.1.5.2 Follow-up in Subjects 
Receiving Durvalumab/CC-486 Combination Therapy, Section 6.7 Safety, Section 6.13 
Discontinuation, and Section 6.14 Follow-up.
!Provided clarity that 16 subjects “per cohort” will be accrued in Stage 1 and not 16 
subjects total and also for 25 additional subjects accrued “per cohort” in Stage 2 for a total of 41 subjects “in each cohort”.
Revised sections: Protocol Summary and Section 10.3 Sample Size and Power 
Considerations.
!Updated to include durvalumab data per the current Durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure, 
Edition 10.
Revised sections: Section 1.3 Durva lumab (MEDI4736), Section 1.3.1 Durvalumab 
Experience in Solid Tumors, and Section 1.3.2 Durvalumab Experience in MDS.
!Updated to include a timeframe for availabilit y for documentation. If documentation of 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) diagnosis, World Health Organization (WHO)/French-
American-British (FAB) classification and International Prognostic Scoring System 
(IPSS)/IPSS-Revised (-R) risk categorizatio n is available “and within 2 months of 
screening”, results of central review are not required prior to e nrollment of the subject in 
the study.
Revised sections: Section 4.1.1. Screening Phas e, Table 2 Table of Events, and Section 
6.1.15 Bone Marrow Aspirate, Biopsy, and Peripheral Bl ood Smear.
!Based on the outcome of the CC-486 safety run-in, the CC-486 starting dose was lowered 
from 200 mg BID, 21/28 day to 100 mg BID, 21/ 28 day for the combination safety run-in 
therapy and the Phase 2 CC-486 monotherapy.
The dose levels in Table 1 were updated to “0 to -3” instead of specifically noting a 
“starting dose” of 200 mg BID, 21/28 only. 
Also, clarification is added to state that th e safety run-in for CC-486 monotherapy has 
been completed as of December 2016.

run-in, and Table 3: Dose Modification Steps.
!Updated text to include “Please refer to Section 4.1.2.1 for CC-486 related dose- limiting 
toxicity criteria”. Criteria was defined for durvalumab dose- limiting tox icities and wanted 
to guide the reader to the previous section for CC-486 specific dose- limiting tox icities 
(for their reference) as this is combination therapy investigating both CC-486 + 
durvalumab.
Revised section: Section 4.1.2.2 Durvalumab/CC-486 Combination Therapy Dose-
Limiting Toxicity.
!Additional sample collections ar e allowed if the site would like to work-up the subject for 
progression. Footnote p was updated to include that unscheduled s ample co llections  are 
also permitted if disease progression is suspected.
Revised section: Table 2: Table of Events
!The window for inclusion criterion number 5 which was originally 12 weeks was 
increased to 16 weeks due to the difficulty for sites to gather prior subject data with regard to prior transfusions, prior iHMA treatments, etc. which potentially would come 
from outside hospitals or other treating institu tions.  Alignment was gained with the
Study Steering Committee to extend this  window from 12 to 16 weeks. 
Also, the additional text “Given this timeframe, subjects may begin screening after the 
last dose of prior injectable HMA” was added for clarity on when subjects could begin 
screening in relation to their last HMA dose. 
Revised sections: Section 6.1 Screenin g, Section 6.1.4 Prior Medications and MDS 
Treatments, and Section 7.2 Inclusion Criteria (criterion number 5).
!Urine collection is not required on Cycle 1 Day -1. This text should have been removed 
in Amendment 1.  Please note that no Cycle 1 Day -1 urine samples have been collected to date.
Revised section: Section 6.1.10 Urinalysis
!Removed reference to collecting “corresponding normal range(s)” in the case report form 
(CRF). Local laboratory range s will be collected in the el ectronic CRF (eCRF), however 
the corresponding normal ranges are not collected via CRF.
Section 6.7.7 Hematology and Serum Chemistry Laboratory Evaluations
!Reference to Section 8.2.2.1 is added for clarity for overnight fasting details and 
correction was made of a typographical error for Cycle 2 blood collections for 
durvalumab as Cycle 1 Day 1 (C 1D1) was meant to be C”2”D1.
Revised section: Section 6.10 Pharmacokinetics
!Electrocardiogram is added in the assessments at discontinuation.

Revised section: Section 7.3 Exclusion Criteria (criterion number 1)
!Removed “or autologous” stem cell transp lant per recommendations from the Study 
Steering Committee and Princip al Investigators. Autologous stem cell transplant should 
not apply as low intensity conditioning or post-transplant immunosuppressive therapies 
are not needed as subjects receive their own cells in this type of transplant.
Revised section: Section 7.3 Exclusion Criteria (criterion number 3)
!Added “at any time in the subject’s prior history” to provide clarity that no time window 
is required and that prior exposure to “oral” decitabine or other “oral” azacitidine, or 
ongoing response (per International Worki ng Group [IWG] 2006) to treatment with 
azacitidine for injection or decitabine can be at any time in the subject’s history.
Revised section: Section 7.3 Exclusion Criteria (criteria numbers 4 and 5)
!Added “planning to become pregnant” to clarify that females who plan to become 
pregnant will be excluded from this trial.
Revised section: Section 7.3 Exclusion Criteria (criterion number 16)
!Removed “disseminated intravascular coagulation” (DIC) per the Study Steering 
Committee recommendation that any prior history  of DIC should not preclude subjects 
from enrolling into this trial.   DIC is a transient condition and if resolved would not lead to any sequelae that would prevent the subject from qualifying for this trial.
Revised section: Section 7.3 Exclusion Criteria (criterion number 21)
!Added exclusion of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and chronic myelomonocytic 
leukemia (CMML) to provide clarity that these subjects do not have MDS and should explicitly be excluded from the trial.

Summary of Changes CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 3 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 1.0 Final: 08 Sep 20151. JUSTIFICATION FOR AMENDMENT
Rationale for the amendment:
While injectable hypomethylating agents (azacitidine for injection and decitabine) remain the 
standard of care in the treatment of International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), as many as half of affected patients do not respond to 
treatment, and nearly all those who do respond will eventually relapse.  Upon failure of treatment 
with azacitidine for injection and/or decitabine, the prognosis for patients with higher-risk disease is dismal, with median overall survival on the order of 4-6 months. Similarly, injectable 
hypo-methylating agents (iHMAs) are approved for treatment of I PSS lower-risk MDS in some 
countries, and while there are few data to characterize outcomes in lower-risk disease following failure of these agents, prognosis is poor and for patients who are not eligible for allogeneic stem 
cell transplant (ASCT), no proven treatment options currently exist.
The goal in treating this population and in evaluating new potentially therapeutic options is to 
capture or recapture hematologic response or hematologic improvement to reduce the rate of 
disease progression and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) t ransformation, and to prolong survival.  
Despite active interest in the post-HMA setting among researchers, there remains a critical unmet medical need.  
Cancer and Immune Function
The importance of the immune system in cancer development and progression has been 
recognized during the past decade.  Failure of immune surveillance of pre-neoplastic lesions and 
micro-metastases is a key step in cancer development. Chronically immunosuppressed 
individuals show higher rates of cancer. This observation led to the hypothesis that sporadic cancers among immune-competent individuals are likely to be minimally immunogenic, 
allowing for passive escape from immune surveillance. Recent data suggest that this may be an 
oversimplification. Some sporadic tumors are highly immunogenic, but actively suppress the local immune environment through production of immunosuppressive cytokines.  The local 
tumor environment is likely a highly dynamic environment where most tumors grow and 
metastasize through adaptive responses that modulate antitumor immunity. The complexity and redundancy of the immune system offers multiple targets that may be manipulated to maximize 
the body’s inherent immune response to a tu mor. Immune response may be augmented by 
directly stimulating effector cells, indirectly stimulating effectors by augmenting antigen presentation activity or costimulation, or by suppressing immunosuppressive factors, cells, or 
messages.
Immune-checkpoint InhibitionTumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have the capacity to control the growth of many types of 
cancers.   Most tumors show infiltration by TILs, but tumors modulate the local 
microenvironment through expression of inhibit ory molecules. Engagement of  TIL cell-surface 
receptors with these inhibitory ligands lead s to a dysfunctional immune  response, causes T-cell 
exhaustion, and facilitates tumor progression.   It is increasingly appreciated that cancers are 
recognized by the immune system, and unde r some circumstances, the immune system may

Confidential and Propri etary 4 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 1.0 Final: 08 Sep 2015control or even eliminate tumors.  Novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that block these 
inhibitory receptors have shown significant clinical activity across a number of tumor types 
Specifically, blockade of immune-checkpoint inhibitors such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-
associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), PD-1, a nd PD-L1 have shown clinical activity not only in 
conventionally immune-res ponsive tumors such as melanoma and re nal cell carcinoma but also 
in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and prostate cancer.  
The PD-1 receptor, in conjunction with receptor ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, functions to regulate 
the immune system primarily by down regulating signals of the T-cell receptor.  PD-L1 
expressed on tumor cells binds to PD-1 on T- cells which leads to down regulation of T-cell 
activity and allo ws tumor cells to evade the immune response.
Recent advances in immunotherapy offer promise for improving clinical outcomes in patients 
with MDS or AML. It is increasingly appreciated that cancers are recognized by the immune 
system, and under some circumstances, the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors.   Studies in mouse mode ls of transplantable tumors have demonstrated that manipulation 
of costimulatory or co-inhibitory signals can amp lify T-cell responses against tumors.  This may
be accomplished by blocking co-inhibitory molecules such as CTLA-4 or PD-1 from binding with their ligands, B7 or B7-H1 (PD-L1).
PD-L1 expression is present in MDS and AML, with increased expression observed in advanced 
disease. In addition, there has been evidence to  suggest that PD-L1 is upregulated in myeloblasts 
in MDS subtypes.  
In addition, in MDS subtypes, PD-L1 expressi on on myeloblasts has been associated with MDS 
transformation to AML.  Myeloid leukemia cell lines that were treated with the hypomethylating agent decitabine were shown to have an u pregulation of PD-L1 expression.  Upregulation ( ≥ 2 
fold) of PD-L1 has been observed in 25% of AML CD34+ samples, 33% of PD-L2, and 22% of 
PD-1.  PD-1 signaling may be involved in MDS pathogenesis and resistance mechanisms to azacitidine; therefore, combined blockade of this pathway can be a potential therapy in MDS and 
AML.
Based on this information, a rationale exists for evaluating durvalumab in combination with 
azacitidine in  subjects with MDS and AML. 
Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG)1 kappa mAb directed against human PD-L1.
Durvalumab is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and has an overall molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa. Durvalumab selectively binds  human PD-L1 with high affinity and 
blocks its ability to bind to PD-1 and clu ster of differentiation 80. The fragment crystallizable 
(Fc) domain of durvalumab contains a triple mutation in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that reduces binding to the complement component C1q and the Fc gamma receptors 
responsible for mediating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 is a Phase 1, firs t-time-in-human, multicenter, open-label, dose-
escalation, and dose-expansion study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or 
optimal biologic dose, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of 
durvalumab in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy or for 
which no standard therapy exists. As of 21 Aug 2014, 408 subjects across 8 tumor types 
(NSCLC, squamous cell carcinoma of the head a nd neck, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, uveal 
melanoma, cutaneous melanoma, gastroesophageal cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and

Confidential and Propri etary 5 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 1.0 Final: 08 Sep 2015hepatocellular carcinoma [hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus positive]) have received 
durvalumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) for a median of 6 doses.
Partial efficacy data are available as of 21 Aug 2014.  In this study, 352 of 408 subjects treated 
with durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W were evaluable for response analysis, which included subjects 
who had at least 12 weeks of follow-up as of the data cutoff date, measurable disease at baseline, 
and at least 1 follow-up scan (included discontinuations due to progressive disease [PD] or death 
prior to first follow-up scan). Early (5 weeks) and durable (56+ weeks) activity were observed 
across multiple tumor types. Disease cont rol rate at 12 weeks (DCR-12w) was 33% (115/352 
subjects) and objective response rate (ORR) was 10% (36/352 subjects) across the 8 tumor types. 
Greater DCR-12w (47% vs 28%) and ORR (22% vs 5%) were observed in subjects with PD-L1-
positive versus PD-L1-negative tumor. Responses are ongoing in 92% of subjects (33/36) with 
an objective response (OR).
Durvalumab is being evaluated in MDS after iHMA treatment.  
 
Despite active interest in the post-HMA setting among researchers, there remains a critical unmet 
medical need.  The current study is being ame nded to additionally ev aluate a new potenti ally 
therapeutic option, durvalumab in combination with CC-486, in an effort to capture or recapture hematologic response or hematologic improvement, to reduce the rate of disease progression and 
AML transformation, and to prolong survival.  
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
An additional investigational product (IP), anti-PD-L1 monoclona l antibody, durvalumab 
(MEDI4736) in combination with CC-486 (combination therapy), will be evaluated  in this study 
in addition to the evaluation of CC-486 as monothe rapy.  The changes in the protocol are being  
made to accommodate this additional arm of combination therapy.
The Introduction (Section 1) now includes a description of durvalumab (Section 1.3) including 
experience in MDS.  Study Rationale (Section 1.4) was changed to include information on cancer and immune function, immune checkpoint inhibition  and 
durvalumab fixed dosing regimens.
The primary objective of the study (Title Page , Protocol Summary and Section 2.1) remains the 
same except for the addition of combination therapy.  The original secondary objectives  also 
remain the same except for the addition of co mbination therapy.  An additional secondary 
objective was added  to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the durvalumab and CC-486 combination.

The study design (Protocol Summary, Section 4) and study design rationale (Section 4.2)  has 
been changed to accommodate the addition of the combination therapy.  The study design now 
includes a safety run-in:  a 3+3 design for CC- 486 monotherapy followed  by a 3+3  design with 
combination therapy to evaluate safety and tolerability.  Dose limiting toxicity was defined for 
monotherapy and for combination therapy.  The previous randomized treatment phase was 
changed to add the additional arm of combination therapy.   Section 4.1.3 was updated to state 
that once the CC-486 dose and schedule in the safety-run in of a treatment arm is identified, 
enrollment for Stage 1 of the treatment phase may begin . A pharmacokinetic sub-study (Section 
4.1.4 and 6.10) was added that will collect samples from 10-12 evaluable subjects randomized to 
the combination treatment arm.  Subjects participating in the pharmacokinetic sub-study will 
receive CC-486 on Day -1 of Cycle 1 (Section 6.3, Section 6.10, Section 8.2).
The previous study design (Figure 1) and the amended study design including the run-in phase 
(Figure 2 and 3) are attached.  The follow-up phase is extended from 28 days to 90 days for the 
combination therapy.
Study populations (Protocol Su mmary, Section 7.1) has been amended to include additional 
subjects for treatment in the safety run-in and in the combination arm.  At least 6 subjects  will 
be treated in the safety run-in phase, utilizing the  standard 3+3 design for the monotherapy and then for the combination therapy.  The Stage 1 randomized treatment will include 64 subjects: 
approximately 32 with stable disease and 32 with progressive disease.  If there are 3 or more 
responses in any arm, that arm with enroll 25 additional subjects in Stage 2.  The total number of subjects  in the randomized treatment phase will range from 64 to 164 subjects.  
The enrollment period (Protocol Summary, Section 4.3) fo r this study has been increased and is 
expected to last approximately 24 months.  The treatment and follow-up phases of study are 
expected to conclude approximately 12 months afte r the last subject is enrolled.  Therefore, the 
total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 36 months.  
Inclusion criteria was amended to include the signing of an additional  
 and the exclusion criteria (Secti on 7.3) was amended to  add exclusions 
appropriate to ensure safety and exclusions of conditions that would confound the ability to 
interpret the data of subjects receiving durvalumab including subjects who received previous treatments similar to durvalumab.  
Study treatment (Title Page, Protocol Su mmary, Section 6.5 now Section 6.6, Section 8, Section 
7.3, and Section 9.2) was amended to add th e following information for durvalumab:  
description, dosing and administration, IP dispensation and guidelines for toxicity management 
and overdose.  Prohibited medications was expanded to add immunosuppressive agents and live 
attenuated vaccines.
Statistical analysis  (Protocol Summary, Secti on 10) now refers to the 2-arm study with the 
addition of the combination treatment.   Sample size and power considerations, primary efficacy 
analysis,  
were changed to reflect the addition of the combination therapy arm.

Summary of Changes CC-486-MDS-006 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 7 CC-486-MDS-006 Amendment 1.0 Final: 08 Sep 2015Safety assessments and  adverse events (Protocol Summary, Table of Events, Section 6.6 now 
Section 6.7 and Section 11), and adverse events of special interest were  added primarily to 
reflect those additional events that are specific to durvalumab, e.g., hepatic function abnormality, 
pneumonitis, infusion reactions and hypersensi tivity.  Appropri ate safety assessments were 
added including infusion monitoring and 12-lead ECG at study discontinuation. 
Other significant changes and rationale for those changes:
Concomitant medications (Section 6.1.4, Secti on 6.6.7 now 6.7.9, Section 9, Table 1 footnote) 
All prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal medications and therapeutic procedures received 
within 12   4 weeks (28 84 days) prior to the first dose of IP, until 28 days after the last dose of 
the IP (or until the treatment discontinuation visit, whichever period is longer) must be recorded on the appropriate CRF page.
Rationale:   Medications discontinued more than 28 days prior to the first dose of IP will be 
unlikely to impact the study.  Treatments for MDS are gathered outside of that time frame.
Coagulation parameters will be collected at baseline (Table 1 now Table 2: Table of Events and 
Section 6.1.5).
Rationale:  Collection of coagulation parameters has been added as an additional safety 
measure.
Amylase and lipase will now be added to serum chemistries as well as thyroid function tests 
(Protocol Summary, Section 4.1.3, Table of Events, Section 6.1.13, Section 6.7, Section 6.14) 
Rationale:  Collection of amylase, lipase and thyroid function tests have been added as
additional safety measures. 
A urine sample should be collected prior to IP administration on Day 1 of every 3
rdtreatment 
cycle (i.e. Cycles 3, 6, 9, etc), treatment disconti nuation and safety follow-up, and sent to central 
lab for analysis (Protocol Summary, S ection 4.1.3, Table of Events, Section 6.1.10, Section 6.7, 
Section 6.13 and Section 6.14). 
Rationale:  Urine monitoring time points have been added as an additional safety measure.
IVRS (Interactive Voice Response System) was changed to IRTS (Interactive Response 
Technology System).
Rationale: This change was provided by Endpoint, our IRTS vendor.

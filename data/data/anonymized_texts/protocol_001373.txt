In sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, radiographic examination and other medical or diagnostic procedures on the colon, it is important that the colon be  thoroughly purged 
and cleansed. In particular, it is essential that as much  fecal matter as possible be 
removed from the colon to permit adequate visualization of the intestinal mucosa.   Large -volume (e.g. 4L) orally administered compositions have been d eveloped for use 
as gastrointestinal “washes” for diagnostic purposes. Such orally administered 
preparations are usually formulated as dilute or isotonic solutions of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG -3350) and electrolyte- containing salts such as sodium sulfa te, 
sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride and potassium chloride ( 1). These or ally 
administered compositions are useful in the rapid cleansing of the colon for diagnostic purposes.  However, due to the large volume of poorly tasting fluid that must be ingest ed, patient compliance is often poor. 
 One attempt to answer this problem has been to reduce the volume of preparation and improve its palatability. To this end, a sulfate -based bowel preparation kit, SUPREP 
® 
Bowel Prep Kit (sodium sulfate, potassium  sulf ate and magnesium sulfate) Oral 
Solution, was cleared by FDA in 2010. SUPREP  requires the patient to consume two 
separate administrations of this oral sulfate solution (OSS).  Each administration purges the colon of fecal material.  The colon is cleansed after the second administration. Each administration is followed by 946 ml supplemental water to prevent dehydration.  The total volume of fluid intake (including SUPREP) is about 3L.  SUPREP was specifically formulated to prevent fluid and electrolyte dist urbances, 
unlike the phosphate preparations (2).   
 Nevertheless, some physi cians have adopted a bowel preparation that consists of PEG-
3350 combined with a “sports drink” such as Gatorade
® (PEG -SD).  It combines PEG-
3350 (available over-the-counter and one of the active ingredients of several FDA-approved bowel cleansing preparations), with the electrolytes and sugar found in the sports drink. It is an osmotically unbalanced formulation and its effects on fluid and electrolyte balance have not been st udied. It appears that the patients’ perception of this 
product is so acceptable that physicians recommend its use, despite evidence that it is less effective and perhaps less safe than those cleared by FDA ( 3,4,5).  
 Table 1  shows that the quantities of t he electrolytes in PEG -SD are much less than in 
marketed bowel preparation products, which is not surprising as the sports drink was developed to replace electrolytes lost in sweat, not from diarrhea.

*Matro et al, 2014. **PEG-SD contains 112g of sugars
Although it
 is unapproved by the FDA, doctors make this decision because of a variety 
of factors, such as cost, taste and patient requests.  
For 
example, Matro et al ( 3) randomized patients to receive PEG -SD (N = 180) or 
PEG -EA (N=184), which is an approved bowel preparation (MOVIPREP®), and 
collected clinical chemistry data at baseline and on the day of colonoscopy. Although 
the incidence of hyponatremia (serum sodium < 135 mmol/L) was higher in the osmotically unbalanced PEG -SD group, (3.9%) vs the PEG- EA treated group (2.2%), it 
did not differ statistically.  For other electrolytes, small but statistically significant changes from baseline to colonoscopy occurred with PEG-SD for sodium, potassium and chloride (P = 0.001, 0.012, 0.001, respectively).  
Regar d
ing the efficacy of PEG -SD, properly powered studies such as that of Matro et 
al conclude that PEG -SD is inferior in the rate of preparations considered “excellent” 
by the endoscopist. Patients consuming the PEG-SD also drink additional fluids and are usually instructed to receive a de-bulking laxative such as OTC bisacodyl prior to the PEG -SD consumption. Bisacodyl is a poorly absorbed stimulant laxative that acts 
to stimulate peristalsis in the colon resulting in stool evacuation.

Study procedures are described as follo ws and depicted graphically in S ection  4.5, 
below. 
4.1. Visit 1  
At the screening visit, the following procedures will be undertaken: 
•Subject is fully informed about the study and gives written agreement to study
participation in the form of a signed informed consent form (refer to Section 4.1.1) and
is assign ed a subject number
•Assess eligibility (re fer to inclusion/exclusion criteria)
•Review of medications
•Medical history - medical history will be reco rded to include all ongoing conditions at
Visit 1 as well as any significant conditions, defined as:
Abdominal surgeries, Renal failure/dysfunction, L iver failure/dysfunction, 
Cardiac disorders (e.g. myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease tachycardia), Hypertension, Diabetes, Cancer (must indicate type of cancer), Electrolyte abnormalities
 
•Physical examination
•Vital signs: including assessment o f orthostatic hypotension ( while seated and after
standing for a minimum of 2 minutes) including height and bodyweight, pulse ,
respiratory rate and  temperature
•A 12 -lead ECG will be performed by qualified, trained site personnel.  ECG output
must be reviewed by  a physician investigator. Any clinically significant cardiac
abnormalities identified on the ECG sh ould disqualify a subject. Data from the ECG
will be collected in the eCRF.
•Blood sa
mples will be collected for testing at a central laboratory, as sho wn below.
Serum Chemistry:  ALT, anion gap (calculated) , AST, bicarbonate, total 
bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, chloride, creatine kinase, creatinine, 
eGFR  (calculated) , glucose, GGT, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, 
sulfate  (Visits 1, 2  and 3 only) , total protein, uric acid and osmolality . Creatine 
kinase results > 2.5 times the upper norm al limit will trigger a test for CK -MB.  
Hematology: Basophils, HCT, HGB, Lymphocytes, MCH, MCV, MPV, 
Neutrophils, Platelets, RBC, WBC 
Urinalysis:  dipstick analysis (Visits 1, 2 and 3 only). Urine positive for bacteria 
will require follow -up if the inve stigator believes the result is due to urinary 
tract infection.  
Inve
stigators will be instructed to comment on all out-of- range values for clinical 
signif icance. For critical values (those indicative of a potential safety concern), 
investigators will be contacted by the central laboratory. Critical value alert levels are 
listed in the laboratory manual.  
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI4900- 302 
Version dated 01-10-2020   Page 14 of 34  
A serum pregnancy test will be performed on fema le subjects of childbearing potential 
(see Section 4.8). Subjects meeting all entry criteria will be elig ible for enrollment. 
 
4.1.1. Informed Consent  
Following the informed consent process, study subjects will sign a current IRB approved consent form. No study proce dures may be performed prior to the subject providing 
informed consent. The subject’s original signed  and personally dated Informed Consent 
Form (together with any subsequent IRB-approved amended versions) must be retained 
by the Investigator in the s ubjec t’s file.  A copy of the original signed and dated Informed 
Consent Form must be given to the subject . 
4.1.2. Treatment Assignment / Blinding  
Subjects that meet all eligibility criteria will be assigned to a treatment group by a dynamic minimization scheme (12) im plemented using an automated interactive web 
response system (IWRS). At the time of enrollment, the IWRS will assign a drug kit 
number for site personnel to dispense to the subject. In addition to being stratified  by 
site, subjects will be stratified into one of the following three groups. Subject s meeting 
Group 1 criteria will be assigned to Group 1 regardless of whether or not they meet the Group 2 criterion.   
Group 1 : Subjects who meet any of the following criteria:  
• History  of prior failed bowel preparation ( inadequate examination ) 
• Curren tly taking opioid medications 
• Body Mass Index > 35 
 
Group 2 : Subjects scheduled for a colonoscopy 12:00 PM or later 
 
Group 3 : Subjects not meeting Group 1 or 2  criteria  
 
The dynamic minimization system will, at the time of each new enrollment, compute a measure of treatment balance for each of the two possible treatmen t assignments.  It 
will then select a treatment arm by pseudo -randomization:  With probability 0.8, it will 
assign the subject to the arm that gives greater balance; with probability 0.2, it will assign the subject to the arm that gives lesser balance.  The site personnel must only 
dispense a drug kit that has been assigned by the IWRS.  Dispensing kits out of order is considered a protocol violation.    In this single -blinded study, to ensure an unbiased evaluation of the study preparations, 
the colonoscopist will not be allowed to perform any study drug-related activities 
(treatment assignment , drug dispensing, return and accountability). Any failure to 
maintain blinding of the treatment to th e col onoscopist will be documented as a 
protocol violation.  Subjects will be instructed not to discuss their study preparation assignment with study staff member s.

Version dated 01-10-2020  Page 15 of 34 4.1.3. Study Drug  
Eligible subjects will be provided with instructions on how to use the study 
preparat ion. Subjects will self -administer the study preparation st arting the evening 
prior to  their scheduled colonoscopy according to the instructions provided by the 
study site (full preparation instructions are included in Appendix A). Subjects will be instruc ted to bring the used preparation components when they return for colonoscopy. 
Subje
cts that have clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities, in the opinion of the 
principle investigator, based on Visit 1 laboratory results must be discontinue d fro m 
the study. Subjects must be notified and instructed to return their unopened bowel preparation to the study center.  These subjects will be classified as screen failures.    Returned un-used study drug kits will not be re-dispensed to another subject.    
4.1.4. Dietary Restrictions  
BLI49 00 
Subjects assigned to BLI4900 will take their first 1-liter dose the evening 
before colonoscopy.  This will be followed no less than four hours later by the second 1- liter dose.  The second dose should be taken 5 to 8 hour s bef ore the 
colonoscopy.  BLI4900 subjects may have a low resid ue breakfast on the day 
before colonoscopy, followed by clear liquids until the colonoscopy is completed the following day. Examples of low residue foods will be provided in the subject prepar ation  instructions (Appendix A).

Version dated 01-10-2020  Page 16 of 34 4.1.5. Medication Restrictions  
Subjects in both preparation groups will be educated that oral medication administered 
within one hour of the start of administration of the bowel preparation may be flushed 
from the GI tract and the medication may not be absorbed.  
4.1.6. Subjec
t Questionnaires  
Subjects will be provided with a Pr eparation Questionnaire and Dietary Questionnaire 
to document their preparation and dietary intake (refer to Appendix A for full 
questionnaires). Subjects will complete the Dietary Questionnaire starting the day before the colonoscopy. Completion of the Pr eparat ion Questionnaire will commence 
with Dose 1  on the day bef ore colonoscopy and continue through the completion of the 
required clear liquids after Dose 2  the following day . The time of all food/fluid 
ingestion will be recorded. Site staff must review the d escriptions and times recorded 
on the questionnaire at Visi t 2 to confirm that subjects were compliant with the dietary 
restrictions outlined in Section 4.1.4. 
Subjec
ts that take any amount of bowel preparation (but do not have a colonoscopy 
performed) sh ould still return for safety follow -up as outlined in Secti ons 4.2 – 4.5. 
4.2. Visit
 2 
After completing both preparation doses, subjects will return to the study center for their colonoscopy. Sites should attempt to schedule subjects a minimum of 4 days from 
date of screening to allow for receipt and review of screeni ng lab results up to a 
maximum of 30 days. Visits scheduled beyond 30 days from Visit 1 will be considered a protocol violation and subjects must repeat screening laboratory assessments.  
Subjects will bring back their questionnaires and study personnel w ill review the 
questionnaires for completeness so that any missed responses can be captured. Any violations of the dietary restrictions must be confirmed with the subject.  Stud y 
personnel will perform drug accountability as described in Section 4.2.1.  
Vital signs will be taken.  A 12 -lead ECG will be performed by qualified, trained site 
personnel.  ECG output must be reviewed by a physician investigator and subjects with 
a clinical ly significant abnormal result must be discontinued prior to colonoscopy. A 
physical examination will be performed. Subjects will be queried for changes to their concomitant medications  and adverse events . Subjects will complete a Preference 
Questionnaire (See Appendix A). Blood samples for chemistry and hematology testing 
will b e taken as outlined in Section 4.1.  
If a colonoscopy is not done, clearl y document if the subject had taken any portion of 
preparation and the reason why the colonoscopy was not attempted . 
The c
olonoscopy will be performed by a physician according to the site’s standard 
procedures and evaluated on a 4 -point scale, as shown in Sect ion 4.7.  The colonoscopy 
procedure will be video recorded. A designated vendor will provide standardized video

Version dated 01-10-2020  Page 17 of 34 recording capabilities and centralized reading by an independent gastroenterologist. 
The procedures and requirements for recording and transmitting colonoscopy videos 
will be outlined in a separate manual.  
Endoscopi
sts should limit the use of water flush to that  necessary to achieve the 
cleansing required to achieve adequate visualization. Water immersion a nd/or exchange 
technique should be avoided unless it is medically indicated. 
4.2.1. Drug Accountability  
Subjects will be instructed to bring their  used and unused pre paration components 
when they return for colonoscopy to d etermine compliance. Failure of a subject to 
return preparation components does not constitute a protocol violation. In order to maintain the blinding, only the unblinded staff members will process d rug return s. The 
unblinded staff members will perform dru g accountability by assessing unused 
preparation materials . The subjects will be instructed not to discuss their study 
preparation with any staff member. Failure of staff members to maintain blinding  of the 
treatment will be documented as a protocol violation. 
All used and unused components of study preparation must be accounted for on drug 
inventory log and will be returned to the Sponsor at the completion or termination of the study, unless instructed otherwise by the Sponsor. 
4.3. Vis
it 3: 48 - 72 Hours  Post Colonoscopy 
Subjects will retu rn 48 - 72 hours following colonoscopy for follow -up. If a subject is 
unable to be seen during this 48 – 72 hour window, subjects should be seen as soon a s 
possible after 72 hours (not prior to 48 hours). Blood sample s will be collected for serum 
chemistry and hematology testing.  Subjects will be queried for occurrence of adverse 
events and changes in concomitant medications. Subjects will be queried for information 
pertaining to the onset and treatment of serious adverse events occurring following the colonoscopy, and adverse events that were ongoing at Visit 2.   
Vital s
igns will be taken.  A 12 -lead ECG will be performed by qualified, trained site 
personnel.   ECG output must be reviewed by a physician investigator. Subjec ts with 
abnormal and clini cally significant ECG results at Visit 3 must return for follow up visits 
as outlined in Section 4.4. 
Subjects that miss Visit 3 must return for follow -up Vis it 4. If these subjects have no out-
of-range laboratory values (that we re not pre -existing at Vis it 1) and/or ongoing adverse 
events at Visit 4, Day 30 follow-up may be performed via telephone (See Section 4.5.1). 
4.4. Visit  4 (Day 7) : Follow up of Adve rse Events and Laboratory Results 
Subjects with out-of- range laboratory values  (that were not pre- existing at Visit 1) 
and/or ongoing adverse events at Visit 3 will return for follow up on Day 7 (+/- 2 days) 
to undergo repeat laboratory testing  and vital signs measurements . Subjects returning 
due to ongoing adverse events should be assessed to determine if the event has resolved or is clinically stable .  If the adverse event has resolved or labora tory value(s)

Section 4.5.1). 
4.5. Visit 5 (Day 30): Follow up of Adverse Events and Laboratory Results 
Subjects with an adverse event that had not resolved or laboratory value that had not 
normalized by Visit 4 will return for follow up on Day 30 (+/ - 2 days). All subjects 
requiring follow -up must undergo repea t laboratory testing and vital signs 
measurements. Subjects returning due to ongoing adverse events should be assessed to determine if the event has resolved or is clinically stable.  
 
4.5.1. End of Study Telephone Call  
Subjects that do not have new or ongoing adv erse events or abnormal laboratory results 
at Visit 3 , or that have resolved by Visit 4, will have an End of Study telephone call 30 
days (+/ -2 days) after colonoscopy. During this call, study personnel will ask i f any 
new adverse events have occurred since Visit 3 and if the subject has had any changes to their concomitant medications.

4.7.1. Segmental Cleansing Assessment  
The blinded colonoscopist will rate each colon segment (proximal, mid, distal) 
during withdrawal using the following scale, factoring in the amount of effort required during both insertion and withdrawal. 
Score  Grade  Description  
1 Poor Large amounts of fecal residue, additional 
bowel preparation requi red 
2 Fair Enough feces even a fter washing and suctioning 
to prevent clear visualization of the entire colonic mucosa. 
3 Good Feces and fluid requiring washing and 
suctioning, but still achieves clear visualization of the entire colonic mucosa. 
4 Excell ent No more than small bits of feces/fluid which 
can be suctioned easily; achieves clear visualization of the entire colonic mucosa 
4.7.2. Overall  Cleansing Assessment  
Following completion of the procedure, the blinded colonoscopist will provide a global rating of preparation quality for the entire colon (inclusive of their perception of all segments) using the scale outlined in Section 4. 7.1.   
4.7.3. Add
itional Efficacy Measures  
In addition, the following data will be collected: 
1. Adequacy of preparation according to the blinded colonoscopist. If t he
preparation was not adequate, the need for re- preparation will be
recorded.
2. Start time of colonoscopy3.Time of cecal intubation
4. Completion time of colonoscopy5. Volume of water used to improve visualization (investigators will need to
specify cases where a water immersion technique was utilized)

Version dated 01-10-2020  Page 21 of 34  4.8. Pregnancy  
Subjects that are female and of childbea ring potential must have a serum pregnancy 
test done at screening. A positive result will rule out the participation of the  subject 
in the study. 
Female 
study s ubject s must be surgically sterilized or use oral contraceptives, depot 
contraceptives, double- barrier method, intrauterine device,  or testify that she is 
monogamous with a vasectomized partner, or practices abstinence and will continue 
to do so during the duration of study. Subjects practicing abstinence must agree to use an acceptable form of birth control should they become sexually active during the study. Women who are post-menopausal (as defined in this section), or have had a partial or total hysterect omy or tubal ligation are not considered of child bearing 
potential.  
Oral
 contraceptives, hormone implants, and injections should be stable for  at least 1 
month before the study, until 1 month after colonoscopy.  
Menopausa
l status is defined when menses have been absent for 12 months in a 
woman of appropriate age (usually 45 to 55 years) who has no other suspected or identified ca use of amenorrhea. 
If a s
ubject becomes pregnant during the study, the subject must be removed f rom 
the study and followed until one month after the end of the pregnancy.  A pregnancy will not be recorded as an adverse event .  
4.9. Con
comitant Medication s 
The use of concomitant medication will be recorded from 7 days prior to screeni ng 
until completion of the study, including sedatio n medications  and intravenous fluids 
administered  during colonoscopy. Laxatives  should not be used within 72 hours of 
beginning the study preparation .

5.1. Adverse Event Definition and Reporting
An Ad verse Event (AE) is any untowa rd medical occurrence associated with the use 
of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug- related. An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product.  Subjects will be queried for any problems they experien ced during and after preparation by site personnel. Colonoscopy and biopsy 
findings are not consi dered adverse events unless co nsidered by the investigator to 
be related to the preparation  or colonoscopy procedure.  
Any bl
ood pressure result that is deemed clinically significant and not present at 
Visit 1 must be reported as an adverse event. In addition, any 30 mmHg change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure from Visit 1 must be reported as an a dverse 
event.   
Adver
se event collection will commence at the time the patient provides informed 
consent and conclude 30 days after preparation exposure.  
Subje
cts will be instructed  to promptly report adverse events to the Investigator. The 
Investigator will record date/time of report, date/time of onset, des cription of the 
adverse event, severity of adverse event, action(s) taken regarding treatment of the event, action(s) taken regarding study participation, duration of adverse event, and the Investigator's assessment of relationship of adverse event to study preparation.  
The I
nvestigator should assess the severity of each adverse event  using the following 
categories:  
Grade  Severi ty Description 
1 Mild  Barely noticeable, does not influence functioning  
causing no limitations of usual activities  
2 Moderate  Makes participant uncomfortable, influences functioning  
causing some limitations of usual activit ies 
3 Severe  Severe discomfor t, treatment needed  
Severe and undesirable, causing inability to carry out usual 
Activities  
4 Life 
threatening  Immediate risk of  death, Life threatening or disabling  
(Must be reported as serious adverse event ) 
5 Fatal  Causes  death of the participant  
(Mus t be reported as serious adverse event)  
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI49 00-302 
Version dated 01-10-2020  Page 23 of 34  The Investigator should assess the relationship to study drug for each adverse event 
using the following categories: 
Categories of 
Attribution:  Description  
UNRELATED  There is no evidence of any causal rela tionship.  
POSSIBLE  There is some  evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the 
event occurred within a reasonable time af ter administration of 
the trial medication). However, the influence of other factors may have con tributed  to the event (e.g., t he subject ’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant events). 
PROBABLE  There is evidence  to suggest a causal relationship, and the  
influence of other factors is unlikely . 
DEFINITE  There is clear  evidence to suggest a causal re lationship, and 
other possible contributing factors can be ruled out . 
5.2 Exp
ected Adverse Events  
BLI49 00 
Because BLI4900 contains the same active ingredients as approved bowel preparations (PEG3350 and sulfates), a similar adverse event profile is expected . In 
Phase 3 clinical trials o f SUPREP (which includes sodium and magnesium sulfate), 
the most frequent adverse events reported by > 3% of patients included over all 
discomfort, abdominal pain and distension, nausea, and vomiting. The most frequently report ed adverse events occurring in  > 3% of patients taking NuLYTELY 
(which contains PEG3350) are nausea, abdominal fullness and bloating.  
SUPREP Bowel Prep Kit  
In a Phase 3 clinical study of SUPREP given in a 2-day, split- dose regimen , the most 
frequent adve rse events reported by patient s taking SUPREP (reported by > 2% of 
patients) included overall discomfort, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting
 (11).

STUDY
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that results in 
at least one of the following outcomes: - Results in death
- Is life -threatening
- Requires inpatient hos pitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
- A persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to
conduct normal life functions
- Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
- Requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment
or damage
 SAE 
collection will coincide with the patient providing in formed consent to 
participate in the study and will conclude 30 days after preparation exposure. Pre -
scheduled or elective surgeries (that do not represent a w orsening of a pre- existing 
condition) will not be considered serious adverse events. Should a serious and/or unexpected adverse event occur, the Investigator will notify Braintree Laboratories 
immediately or no later than 24 hours after gaining knowledge of the event.  The 
Investigator will make a decision regarding continuing study participation, and may 
request input from Braint ree Laboratories. The Investigator will be responsible for 
recommending or providing the patient with appropriate medical therapy . All patients 
experiencing serious adverse events will be followed until satisfactory resolution  
occurs .  
Brain
tree Laborator ies must be  kept apprised of all follow -up information related  to 
serious adverse events. In addition, Investigators must comply wi th the SAE reporting 
requirements of the Institutional Review Board with oversight of the study .  
Any s
erious and/or unexpected adverse events that occur during the study will be 
reported to Braintree Laboratories as follows: 
Contac
t Telephone Numbers: 
During Business hours 
(M-F, 8:30 am
 – 5:00 pm EDT) 
After hours or weekends  
Brain
tree Lab oratories and its medical monitor will review the report and determine 
whether an FDA Form 3500A will also be completed and sent to FDA.  
6.1. Blo
od Sampling for SAE Subjects  
Subjects that experience an SAE must to return to the cl inic as soon as possible to 
provide blood samples for pharmacokinetic testing of sulfate and polyethylene glycol 3350 (and metabolites). The time of blood sampling must be recorded. If a subject 
refuses to return for this procedure, the site must document this in their progress notes.

CONSENT
IRB review and approval of the study protocol and Informed Consent Form w ill be 
obtained prior to initiation of the study.  Amendments to the study protocol and consent form generated during the course of the study will also require IRB approval.  
8.MANAGEMENT OF INTERCURRENT EVENTS
8.1. Modification of Protocol
Neither an Investigato r nor Braintree Laboratories will modify the protocol without 
first obtaining the concurrence of the other and the IRB. Investi gators that 
continually violate the protocol or commit a serious violation may be subject to termination from the study. The study may be halted if at any time an Investigator or Braintree Laboratories deems the incidence or severity of adverse events to be unacceptable.  
8.2. Subjects Discontinued from the Study  
Subjects may be discontinued f rom the study for any of the following reasons : 
•An adverse event requiring discontinuation (including failure to tolerate studymedication).
•Female participants who become p regnant during the study period.
•Major protocol deviation from the study design by the subject  that is observed
or suspected by the Investigator
•Subject chooses to withdraw from the study, for whatever reason.
•Subject is lost to follow-up.
•The Sponsor initiates an early discontinuation of the study.
•The subject is withdrawn at the discretion of the Investigator.
Braintree should be  contacted if possible prior to discontinuation of any subject .
8.3. Saf
ety Interim Monitoring – Study Stopping Rule  
Adverse event  data will be monitored on an ongoing basis  (no less frequent than 
biweekly) . Adverse event terms from the study that are li sted in the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 5 .0) under the system  organ 
classes (SOCs) of Cardiac Dis orders, Renal and Urinary Disorders and Metabolism and 
Nutrition Disorders will be reviewed as part of the study stopping r ule.  
Brain
tree Laboratories will notify FDA and will consider stopping the st udy if ≥ 2 
subject s develop the same adverse reaction (based on the MedDRA preferred term) 
listed in the Cardiac, Renal and Urinary  Disorders  and Metabolism and Nutrition SOCs 
of Grade 3, or if a single subject develops one of the listed adverse reactions  of Grade 4 
or higher.

9.1. Study Endpoints - Efficacy  
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
 
Primary efficacy will be assessed on the basis of a binary outcome of overall preparation success or failure. For statistical analyses, the following definition of 
preparation success and failure will be used:  
 
Definition of successful preparation:  
1. Overall Cleansing Assessment by the local colonoscopist (Section 4.6.2) of 
“Excellent” or “Good” and does not satisfy any of the following fai lure criteria.    
 
Definition of failed preparation:  
1. Overall Cleansing Assessment  of “Fair” or “Poor” by the local 
colonoscopist 
2. Any subject who did not have a colonoscopy based on the Investigator’s assessment of the cleansing ( subject report of insufficient f ecal output, 
unclear fecal discharge, etc.) or due to preparation- related ad verse events.  
3. Any subject for whom cleansing was not adequate for evaluation 
 
Unevaluable Subject s: 
Subjects who were dispensed a kit but withdrew from the study prior to taking an y 
preparation (including subjects who were disqualified subsequent to Visit 1 based on screening laboratory results) are excluded from the efficacy and safety analyses. Any subject who completely or partially took study preparation but did not have a colonoscopy due to non- preparation related reasons (e.g. lack of insurance, inabi lity 
to return for colonoscopy) will not be included in the efficacy analyses. All treated subjects will be included in the safety analysis.  
 Success rate will be analyzed using C MH Chi -square adjusting for the effect of 
investigator site.  The formal hypothesis test result (p -value) for treatment difference 
will be presented together with a two -sided 95% confidence interval for the 
difference.  
 
Null Hypothesis H0: P1−P2≤D0 versus  Alternative Hypothesis H1: P1−P2>D0, 
 where P1 is the success probability in the BLI4900 group, P2 is the success probability in the SUPREP group (reference or control group), and D0 is the acceptable margin of non-infer iority , which we set equ al to  −10%.  
 
If the test for non- inferiority is statistically significant, we will conduct a test of 
superiority comparing the proportion of overall Excellent preparations: 
 
Null Hypothesis H0: P1−P2≤0 versus  Alternative Hypothesi s H1: P1−P2>0. 
 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI49 00-302 
Version dated 01-10-2020   Page 27 of 34  The two hypothesis tests are hierarchically structured so that the second test will be 
conducted only if the first test rejects the hypothesis of inferiority. Thus there is no need to correct the alpha levels of the tests for multiplicity.  
 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed for th e primary endpoint based on 
stratification groups outlined in Section 4.1.2. The primary endpoint of cleansing success will also be analyzed based on demographic subgroups (elderly, gender, race, ethnicity).  
 
Additional Efficacy Endpoints : 
 Additional efficacy endpoints will include:  
• Adenoma Detection Rate (proportion of subjects with a confirmed adenoma based on histopathological examination) 
• Cleansing score by segment  
• Number (%) of excellent preparations by s egment  
• Adequacy of clean sing and need for re- preparation  
• Duration of colonoscopy 
• Volume of intraprocedural water needed to irrigate the colon  
• Number (%) of procedures that reached the cecum  
• Time to cecum  
 Cleansing will also be evaluated using an explorat ory definition of preparation success 
based on segmental scoring  by the central reader . Using the grading scale outlined in 
Section 4.7.1, each colon segment (proximal, mid, distal) will be graded by the central 
reader on insertion. To be considered succes sful, all segment grades must be rated as 
Excellent or Good. If any segment is rated as Fair or Poor, the preparation will be considered a failure. This analys is will be conducted using the same statistical 
methodology as the primary efficacy endpoint ( -10% non-inferiority  margin).  
 
Additional efficacy endpoints will be analyzed in a manner si milar to the primary 
analysis using the CMH test adjusting for site effects for count (percentage) outcomes and two- way ANOVA with terms for treatment, site, and their interaction 
for continuous responses. No adjustment will be made for multiplicity in tes ting the 
additional efficacy  endpoints.  P values will be presented for hypothesis tests, and 
two-sided 95% confidence intervals for estimates of treatment effects.  
 
9.2. Study Endpoints - Safety  
Adverse Events:  
All subjects who took preparation in any amount will be included in the safety analysis. All adverse events will be analyzed based on the principle of treatment emergence. A sign or symptom will be regarded as treatment -emergent if it was 
present prior to the first dose and subsequently worsened in severity, or was not present prior to the first dose but subsequently appeared.  
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI49 00-302 
Version dated 01-10-2020   Page 28 of 34  In order to define treatment emergence for events with missing start or stop dates the 
following additional criteria will be used:  
• if both the onset and resolution dates for a particular event are missing, then the event is considered treatment -emergent;  
• if the onset date for an event is missing and the resolution date falls after the initiatio n of the first dose, then the event is considered treatment- emergent;  
• if the ons et date for an event falls after the initiation of the first dose and the 
resolution date is missing or  present, then the event is considered treatment-
emergent; and  
• if the onset date for an event falls before the initiation of the first dose and the 
stop date is missing or  present, then the event is not considered treatment-
emergent.  
 
Adverse events will be collected using MedDRA category designations for body system and prefer red term. The number and percent of subjects who experienced 
each adverse event  will be presented in a tabular form.  Individual tables will be 
provided for treatment- emergent adverse events, treatment -emergent adverse events 
by relationship to study drug, and treatment -emergent adverse events by severity. 
The difference in adverse events between study populations will be tested by the Fisher’s exact test together with a 95% confidence interval for the treatment effect estimate.  Treatment -emergent adverse events will also be analyzed based on 
demographic subgroups (elderly, gender, rac e, ethnicity).  
 
Vitals Signs: 
Vital signs and physical examination data will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  
 
Laboratory Data:  
Results of laboratory tests for the change from baseline (Screening) and treatment group differences will be tested us ing AN COVA.  In addition, shift tables will be 
presented to describe changes in lab parameter values between screening and post -
treatment time points using normal range categor ies (low, normal, high).  
 
9.3. Sample Size  
Approximately five hundred and twenty (520) subjects will be randomly assigned via 
the minimization scheme to one of two preparations in a ratio of 1:1 (260 subjects per group) and undergo colonoscopy. Based on prior  studies using a similar grading 
system, the success rate for SUPREP is expected  to be approximately  95%
 (11). 
Assuming a success rate for BLI4 900 of approximately 9 1%, a two -sided asymptotic 
confidence interval for the difference in success rates between groups (BLI4900 – 
SUPREP) will result in a lower CI bound greater than – 10%, with probability 80%. This result would establish the non- inferiority of BLI4 900 to SUPREP at  a non-
inferiority margin of 10%.  
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.   Confidential  
Protocol Number BLI49 00-302 
Version dated 01-10-2020   Page 29 of 34  Our sample- size calculations for non-inferiority  tests with a binary outcome use the 
method of Chow et al (13). If the SUPREP  success rate is 95% and the BLI4900 
success rate is 9 1%, the sample size needed is n=446 (total across both study groups) 
for a non-inferiority margin of 10% and a target power of 80%.  Thus with the study 
requirement of 520 subjects undergoing colonoscopy  (assuming a dropout rate of 
approximately 10%), we will attain 80% power .  
In randomized studies, the purpose of the stratification is to eliminate the stratification factor from the error term, thereby potentially reducing variability  (14).  
Moreo ver, because the trial will use stratification in the design, for consistency we 
will employ a stratified test in the analysis.  The CMH analysis on risk differences, by eliminating center  effects, essentially renders the analysis equivalent to that of a 
single-center study.  The sample- size calculation described above assumes a single 
stratum that is free of between -stratum variability and therefore effectively models 
the stratified analys is that we will conduct.  
 
9.4. Study Populations  
The following populations have been defined for data analyses.  
9.4.1. Intention -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
This population includes all subjects assigned to treatment and may be used for 
sensitivity analysis of the prima ry efficacy endpoint. 
9.4.2. Safety Population 
This population consisted of all randomized subjects that took any portion of study medication. The safety population will be used for all safety analyses.  
 
9.4.3. Modified Intention- to-Treat (mITT) Population  
This population consists of all randomized subjects that took at least one dose of 
study medication. The only exception is subjects who took the study preparation and did not undergo colonoscopy for a reason other than safety or efficacy (e.g. lack of insurance covera ge, unable to return to the clinic for colonoscopy). This population  
will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
 
10. DRUG INVENTORY AND DISPOSITION  
At the conclusion of the study, all drug materials will be accounted for.  Federal law requires that, at the concl usion of the study, all drug materials must be  returned to the 
study sponsor or destroyed according to local regulations.

A Braintree Laboratories Study Monitor or qualified designee will visit each study 
center prior to the commencement of the study and periodically during the course of the study in accordance with federal guidelines governing the sponsorship of studies. 
12. DOCUMENTS AND NOTIFICATIONS  
12.1. Informed Consent  
Written informed consent will be obtained from the subject s by study pe rsonnel and 
will be kept on file at the study center . Documentation of the consent process should 
be noted in the study source documents. 
12.2. Institutional Review Board 
Peer review and approval of the protocol by an appropriate Institutional Review Board is required prior to commencement of enrollment.  Amendments to the approved protocol must also be submitted to the Institutional Review Board and approved prior to their implementation.  
 
12.3. Amendments to the Protocol  
If Braintree Laboratories determines that the re is need for an amendment, it will be 
produce d in writing by Braintree Laboratories and will be made a formal part of the 
protocol following its submission and approval from the IRB.    
12.4. Data Records 
Site personnel will be required to enter study data int o electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs) provided by Braintree Laboratories. Subject medical records will be reviewed to verify study data points, including potential adverse events, and to ensure correctness and consistency with the CRF entries. Copies of s ubjects’ 
laboratory reports, colonoscopy and pa thology reports (if applicable) will be 
collected for Braintree Laboratories after subject identifiers have been redacted by site staff. The Investigator should retain copies of paper and electronic data, pati ent 
consent/assent forms, and other study documents for a period of two years following the date of approval of a New Drug Application or supplement for BLI4 900, or, if 
the application is not approved, for two years after the drug investigation program is discontinued. These records will be made avail able at reasonable times for inspection 
and copying if requested by a properly authorized employee of Braintree Laboratories or the Department of Health and Human Services in accordance with federal regulations . 
13. PUBLICATION AND AGREEMENT  
 The results of this study will be published if mutually agreed by Braintree Laboratories and the Investigator  and at a mutually agreed upon date. Investigator 
agrees to submit to Braintree Laboratories, within sixty (60) days of the proposed submission date, any proposed publication or presentation for prior review.

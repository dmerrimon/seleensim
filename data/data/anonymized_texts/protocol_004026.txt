 1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHE MA 
 
This is a feasibility trial of dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with nod e-negative, 
HER-2/neu-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer. The regimen consists of paclitaxel (T) at 175 
mg/m2 q 2 weeks x 4 with filgrastim/pegfilgrastim + trastuzumab  (H) + daily oral lapatinib (L), 
followed by trastuzumab  q 3 weeks x 15 doses + daily oral lapatinib (HL). Pegfilgrastim 6mg will 
be given su bcutane ously (SQ) on d ay # 2 of each paclitaxel administration.  Filgrastim may be 
used in lieu of pegfilgrastim at the physician’s discretion. Trastuzumab  will be a dministered 
weekly (4 mg/kg bolus followed by  2 mg/kg weekly) starting with pac litaxel treatment cycle # 1. 
After completion of 4 cycles of paclitaxel, patients will receive trastuzumab  on a q 3 week 
schedule x 15 doses.  A total of 15 infusions of trastuzumab  will be given q 3  weeks after the 
comp letion of paclitaxel (during the HL phas e). Lapatinib will be given ora lly at 1000 mg daily, 
starting with pac litaxel during the THL phase  and continued for the remaining year during the HL 
phase for about a year. 
 
Study blood will be co llected  serially for cardiac biomarker analysis [troponin I (cTnI), brain type 
natriuretic peptide (BNP), neuregulin-1ß (NRG-1ß)]. We will also assess  the left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline and at months 2, 6, 9, 12 and 18  of treatment with an 
echocardiogram (ECHO) with a strain imaging analysis (+/- 4 weeks). When an ECHO ca nnot be 
done, a multi-gated acquisition scan  (MUGA) may be done. 
 
The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of a dose-dense adjuvant paclitaxel with HL in 
patients with node -negative, HER-2/neu -overexpressed/amplified breast cancer. 
 
The regimen is considered feasible if patients are able to complete the paclitaxel, trastuzumab, 
and lapatinib (THL) portion of the regimen without a dose de lay or reduction or  grade 3 or grea ter 
QTc prolongation.  An early stopping rule that terminates the trial if the overall cardiac event (CE) 
rate is greater than 4% or if there is excessive grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity has been 
incorporated. The incidence of cardiac events will be closely monitored.  A CE is defined as 1) 
cardiac de ath or 2) symptomatic congestive heart  failure (CHF) defined as dyspnea with normal 
activity or at rest and “absolute” decline in LVEF by > 10% to < 50 % by echocardiogram or 
MUGA.  A cardiac event will result in discontinuation of trastuzumab  and lapatinib. 
 
The secondary objectives are to evaluate the toxicities of this regimen, to explore the use  of 
cardiac biomarkers as predictors of cardiac toxicity and to explore the use  of single-nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) genotyping in evaluation of pharmacogenetic determinates of 
gastrointestinal toxicity. 
 
We plan to accrue 55 evaluable patients with HER-2/neu o verexpresse d/amplified breast cancer 
(node-negative, tumor size < 3 cm) to this trial within 12 months.  Endpoints for removal from the 
study are unacceptable toxicity, progression of disease while on study drugs, death, major 
protocol violation, and patient withdrawal from study.

3.0 BACKGROU ND AND RATIONALE 
 
Background 
 
 
Adjuvant Chemotherapy 
 
 
Adjuvant chemotherapy with comb inations of cytotoxic agents reduces the risk of recurrence and 
has an important role in the treatment of early breast  cancer.  The 2005 Early Breast Cancer 
Trialists’ Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) meta-analysis demonstrated a survival advantage for 
anthracycline-based  adjuvant  regimens  comp ared  with  non-anthracycline  based  therapies.1 
Given the rare but serious long-term effects of anthracycline exposure including congestive heart 
failure and secondary h ematologic malignancies, tailoring adjuvant regimens to minimize the 
cumu lative exposure to anthracyclines and optimize efficacy has been a focus for medical 
oncologists.  Over the past 25 years, taxanes have been studied in the treatment of breast cancer 
and are well established agents in the metastatic set ting.   Paclitaxel and docetaxel, when 
administered as  single agents have similar efficacy to anthracyclines in chemotherapy naïve 
patients.2-3    Several randomized co ntrolled trials have evaluated the benefit of a taxane to an 
anthracycline-based regimen in the treatment of early breast  cancer.  A recent meta-analysis 
demonstrated that taxane-based regimens provide both a disease free survival (DFS) and overall 
survival benefit (OS) with an absolute 5-year risk reduction of 5% for DFS and 3% for OS when 
compared  to standard anthracycline regimens.   The benefit risk reduction for recurrence was 
seen irrespective of estrogen receptor (ER) status, lymph node status,  and age with a magnitude 
of benefit that remained nearly constant across subgroups of patients.4 
 
Dose Dense Therapy 
 
In an attempt to optimize taxane delivery in the adjuvant setting, the Cancer and Leukemia Group 
B (CALGB)  9741 trial explored the concept of dose density or the administration of chemotherapy 
with shortened inter-treatment intervals.5    This strategy was developed from the Norton-Simon 
mathematical model of tumor  cell growth which shows that a given dose of chemotherapy kills a 
certain fraction rather than a certain number of cancer cells.  Additionally, breast  cancer cells 
demonstrate non-exponential Gompertzian kinetics, and regrowth of cancer cells between cycles 
of therapy is more rapid in these cancer models than exponential models.6-7   Thus, the fixed cell 
kill achieved with each cycle of therapy may be  optimized by delivering each subsequent cycle in 
quick success ion.  The limitation of dose-dense therapy is the impact on rapidly proliferating cells, 
including bone marrow pr ogenitor cells though this is mitigated by the administration of G-CSF. 
The CALGB 9741 trial randomized 2,005  patients to one of four treatment arms: 1) sequential 
doxorubicin (A) x 4 cycles, paclitaxel (T) x 4 cycles, cyclophosphamide (C) x 4 cycles (A-T-C) 
delivered three weeks apart; 2) sequential A-T-C delivered every two weeks with G-CSF; 3)

 concurrent AC x 4 cycles followed by 4 cycles of T (AC-T) delivered every three weeks; 4) 
concurrent AC-T delivered every two weeks with G-CSF.   At a median 6.5 years of follow-up, 
there  is  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  DFS  and  OS  in  favor  of  dose-dense 
chemotherapy administration.8. 
 
Anti-HER2 Therap ies 
 
 
Trastuzumab  
 
In an ef fort to improve upon these outcome s, biologic therapeutics have been incorporated into 
adjuvant regimens.  Amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) 
gene is observed in 20% to 30% of invasive breast carcinomas and portends a poor prognosis 
with increased  risk of disease progress ion and decreased overall survival.9    Given that HER2 
overexpress ion mediates the transformed p henotype, therapeutic strategies targeting HER2 
activation are a logical approach. Trastuzumab  (Herceptin®), a human ized, recombinant 
monoclonal antibody, binds to the extracellular domain of HER2 inhibiting kinase activity and 
leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.10    The pivotal phase III clinical trial, which led to FDA 
approval of trastuzumab  for the treatment of metastatic HER2-positive breast  cancer, randomized 
469  women  who  had  not  received  chemotherapy  for  metastatic  HER2-amplified  disease  to 
receive chemotherapy plus trastuzumab  or chemotherapy alone. Women were treated with an 
anthracycline- or taxane-based regimen based on their prior exposures.  The addition of 
trastuzumab  to chemotherapy led to statistically significant improvements in time to progression, 
duration of response, objective response rate, and overall survival. These results were tempered 
by card iac toxicity documen ted with trastuzumab  especially in comb ination with anthracycline 
therapy   (27%   incidence   with   anthracycline   and   trastuzumab,   13%   with   paclitaxel   and 
trastuzumab, a nd 8% with anthracycline therapy alone).11 
 
Motivated by the proven benefits of trastuzumab in the metastatic setting, four international 
studies initiated in 2000-2001 with over 13,000 women  examined the safety and efficacy of 
adjuvant trastuzumab: the Hercep tin Adjuvant (HERA )12-13 trial, the National Surgical Adjuvant 
Breast and Bowel Project B-31 (NSAB P B-31) trial, the North Central Cancer Trea tment Group 
9831 (N9831)14 trial, and the Breast Cancer International Research Group 006 (BCIRG 006)15-16 
trial. Two smaller trials, the Finland Hercep tin (FinHER)17 trial and the Protoco le Adjuvant dans le 
Cancer du Sein 04 (PACS 04)18  trial followed soon after (Table 1). With the exception of PACS 
04, the adjuvant trials collectively demonstrated trastuzumab  reduced the risk of breast cancer 
recurrence by approximately 40-50% despite differences  in patient population and trial design. 
Although trastuzumab  has been widely accepted in the adjuvant setting, there remain several 
uncertainties regarding administration including possible cardiac toxicity. 
 
Cardiac Tox icity 
 
Reports of trastuzumab-related cardiac toxicity during pivotal trials of data collected  from seven 
phase II and III clinical trials for trastuzumab  are available.19-20   The analysis performed 
independently by the Cardiac Review and Evaluation Committee, evaluated the risk and severity 
of cardiac dysfunction, baseline risk factors, and the role of cumulative doses of anthracyclines 
and trastuzumab  relative to the development of cardiac dysfunction. The severity of these events 
was ca tegorized us ing the New York Heart Association functional classification system. The 
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER

Page  8 of 69  
 incidence of class III or IV card iac dysfunction was 2%  for those receiving first-line trastuzumab, 
4% for those receiving trastuzumab  in the refractory setting, 2% for those receiving concurrent 
paclitaxel plus trastuzumab, 1% for those receiving pac litaxel alone, 16% for those receiving 
concurrent AC and trastuzumab,  and 4% for those receiving AC alone. The incidence a nd 
severity of cardiac dysfunction was greatest am ong patients receiving concurrent AC and 
trastuzumab.  The risk of cardiac toxicity was lower in those receiving concurrent paclitaxel and 
trastuzumab  or paclitaxel alone, despite prior anthracycline exposure in most of these patients. 
The four large adjuvant trials have sho wn that the incidence of cardiac toxicity attributable to 
treatment with anthracycline-taxane based  regimen followed by  trastuzumab is acceptable with 
rates of congestive heart  failure below 4% and very rare cardiac deaths.13, 16, 21-24 
 
Given the su periority of dose-dense AC-T over conventionally scheduled AC-T in terms of DFS 
and OS, and the benefit and safety of trastuzumab with con ventionally scheduled AC-T, our group 
examined the feasibility of dose-dense AC followed by  T and  trastuzumab  in HER2-amplified 
breast ca ncer. The primary end point of the study was ca rdiac safety. In our study, the addition 
of trastuzumab  to dos e-dense AC-T was well tolerated with only 1/70 patients (1.4%) 
experiencing symptomatic LVEF dec line with congestive heart  failure; there were no cardiac 
deaths.25 
 
Lapatinib 
 
Having shown the safety of dose-dense AC-T plus trastuzumab, our attention turned  to further 
improving adjuvant regimens and their outcomes for patients with HER2-overexpress ing breast 
cancer.  Lapatinib, a dual inhibitor of epidermal growth factor and HER2/neu kinase activity has 
demonstrated activity as a single agent, combined with trastuzumab, as well as with capec itabine 
in patients with progression after prior anthracycline, taxane, and trastuzumab  therapy.26-28   This 
motivated the inclusion of lapatinib into adjuvant regimens including the large multicenter phase III 
ALTTO (Adjuvant Lapatinib and/or  Trastuzumab  Treatment Optimization) trial. We conducted a 
phase II study to establish safety data for one arm of ALTTO: dose-dense AC followed by 
paclitaxel, weekly trastuzumab, a nd lapatinib, followed by  trastuzumab  and lapatinib. The dose of 
lapatinib selected  was 1,000 mg daily based on phase I s tudies that estab lished the feasibility of 
the combination of trastuzumab  and lapatinib (EGF10023) and weekly paclitaxel and lapatinib 
(EGF10009/EGF105764).27, 29 
 
Our phase II study of dose-dense AC followed by pac litaxel, trastuzumab, and lapatinib (THL) 
followed by trastuzumab, lapatinib was not feasible at a l apatinib dose  of 1000 mg given 
excessive diarrhea.  Diarrhea was experienced by  84 (88%) patients and 27 (29%) patients had 
grade 3 diarrhea. The study was closed e arly as 43%  of patients required a lapatinib dose 
reduction due  to grade 3  or unacceptable grade 2  or less diarrhea.30   Two trials with simi lar 
designs demonstrated high rates of diarrhea for the comb ination of weekly paclitaxel, 
trastuzumab, a nd lapatinib dosed at  1,000 mg daily.  Johnson and  colleagues reporting the Mayo 
Clinic experience found that 43% of patients had grade 3 or greater diarrhea.31   The neoadjuvant 
CHER LOB (Chemotherapy Plus Trastuzumab, L apatinib, or Both in HER2-Positive Operable 
Breast Cancer) reports 41% of patients experienced grade 3 or grea ter diarrhea in the arm 
receiving weekly paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and lapatinib.32Institu tion of proactive diarrhea 
management in our study could explain the lower rate of grade 3  diarrhea reported in our phase II 
study.

 Diarrhea 
 
Diarrhea is a  known side-effect of lapatinib therapy; a poo led analysis of eleven studies with 
lapatinib monotherapy or in combination with capecitabine or  taxanes demonstrated a less than 
10% rate of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea. Diarrhea rates in the two phase I studies examining 
comb ination lapatinib with taxane therapy were higher than that for lapatinib monotherapy. In 
EGF10009 (lapatinib 1,250 or  1,500  mg with pac litaxel at 135 to 225 mg/m2 every 3 weeks or 80 
mg/m2 weekly) and in EGF10021 (lapatinib 1,000 or 1,500  mg with doce taxel at 50 to 75 mg/m2 
every 3 weeks) incidence of all grade  diarrhea were 82% and 71%, respectively.33 
Pharmacokinetic studies for EGF10009 demonstrated a greater than 20% increase in s ystemic 
exposure for both lapatinib and pac litaxel when paclitaxel was ad ministered every three weeks. 
Diarrhea rates were higher for patients who received lapatinib with weekly paclitaxel than those 
on every three week paclitaxel, 50% versus  7%, respectively.29 
 
There are several p ossible explanations for the excessive diarrhea seen  in our phase II safety trial 
of dose-dense AC followed by  paclitaxel, trastuzumab, lapatinib, followed by trastuzumab and 
paclitaxel.  First, paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and lapatinib can  all individually lead to diarrhea 
although this is usually grade 1  or 2.34-36   Second, paclitaxel therapy may affect the intestinal crypt 
cells and lead to a loss of absorption leading to worsen ing diarrhea with lapatinib and trastuzumab  
therapy.37   Third, the schedule of paclitaxel administration influences diarrhea rates. There is a  
higher incidence of grade 3 diarrhea reported with weekly than every three week paclitaxel 
administration.35   Examination of every two week versus  every three week dosing of paclitaxel 
(CALGB 9741) showed no s ignificant difference in d iarrhea rates.5   The findings of our phase II 
safety trial of dose-dense AC followed by pac litaxel, trastuzumab  and lapatinib followed by  
trastuzumab  and lapatinib influenced the design of the ALTTO trial. The dose of lapatinib was 
adjusted  from 1000 mg to 750  mg daily when combined with pac litaxel and lapatinib. In terms of 
cardiac toxicity, three patients (3%) had symptomatic co ngestive heart  failure and there were no 
cardiac de aths on  study.30   The rate of card iac toxicity is similar to the Mayo Clinic experience 
with pac litaxel, trastuzumab, and lapatinib.31   A recent review of the cardiac safety data from 
3,689 p atients on lapatinib determined a symptomatic C HF rate of 0.2% and an asymptomatic 
cardiac event rate of 1.4%.38   Although our study reported higher rates of card iac toxicity, this may 
be explained by enhanced cardiac toxicity with concurrent administration of lapatinib and 
trastuzumab.  In supp ort of this hypothesis, the phase III study comp aring lapatinib and 
trastuzumab  with lapatinib monotherapy, more cardiac events were reported for combination 
illustrating the potential of grea ter cardiac toxicity for lapatinib and  trastuzumab in comb ination.39 
 
Adjuvant Therapy for Node Negative HER2 Pos itive Pati ents 
 
There is much less d ata on the treatment of patients with nod e-negative HER2-positive breast 
cancer than those with node -positive disease. We have recently completed acc rual of a single- 
arm ph ase II efficacy trial designed to evaluate the role of 12 doses of adjuvant weekly paclitaxel 
and trastuzumab  followed by trastuzumab  monotherapy for an additional 40 weeks in abo ut 400 
patients with node -negative HER2-positive breast cancers measuring < 3cm. The DFS and OS 
outcomes of this study are forthcoming. There are now data sho wing that dual anti-HER2 therapy 
is more effective than single anti-HER2 treatment. In the metastatic setting, Blackwell et al 
showed that in a heavily pre-treated population, lapatinib combined with trastuzumab  led to a 
improvement in progression-free survival over just lapatinib alone.39   In the neoadjuvant setting, 
the Neo-ALTTO trial showed that the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate was higher in the

 group that received THL (51.3%) at  the time of surgery when compared to those who received TH 
(29.5%) or  TL (24.7%).40 One of the major side effects was a higher grade  > 3 diarrhea in those 
receiving lapatinib con taining arms, with 23%  in TL arm and 21% in THL group,  but only 2 % in 
TH arm. Of note, paclitaxel in this study was given weekly and the diarrhea toxicity data is 
consistent with our findings when weekly paclitaxel is used with lapatinib and trastuzumab.30 
However, the DFS and OS results for both Neo-ALTTO and ALTTO are  pending. 
 
 
It is possible that dual anti-HER2 therapy (ie: THL) may lead to improved DFS and/or OS over 
time. However, the limitation with the THL combination with weekly paclitaxel is the occ urrence of 
significant > G 3 diarrhea. Thus, it is important to estab lish an  optimal THL schedule with a 
different paclitaxel schedule (dose-dense) and study it in a lower risk, node negative pop ulation. 
 
Pharmacogenomics Studies of Drug Toxicity 
 
Chemotherapy associated toxicity differs greatly between patients. Genetic variation may 
contribute to the differences in se verity and frequency with which che motherapy  associated 
toxicities occu r.  A genetic polymorphism is defined as a minor allelic variant present in >1% of 
the population.41 Genetic po lymorphisms can occur as single nuc leotide polymorphism in cod ing, 
non-coding and promoter regions, deletions, insertions, or gene copy number variant, all of which 
can result in altered functional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity of the affected 
protein.42   Functional polymorphisms resulting in altered drug metabolism of chemotherapeutic 
agents have been  identified and may contribute to the variability of toxicities observed. Table 1 
lists the candidate genes and the partial rationale for inclusion in this study.

Polymorphisms in ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters have been  shown to result in altered 
toxicity in those receiving tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKI) and taxanes.  ATP-binding cassette 
transporter B1 (ABCB1 , Multidrug resistance-1) polymorphism may change the function of P- 
glycoprotein, by which taxanes can  be extruded through the cell membranes. The prevalence 
and severity of mucosal inflammation and dermatologic toxicity has been shown to be higher in 
patients with variant haplotypes of ABCB 1 efflux transporter genes receiving tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors. The ABCB 1 haplotype P-gp*2 includes 3435(C>T), 1236(C>T), 2677(G>T/A); and has 
been ass ociated with grade 3 d iarrhea in those treated with taxanes.60 Another relevant 
polymorphism for this study is ABCG2 at p osition 421(C> A), which has  been ass ociated with 
diarrhea in those treated with TKIs.59 
 
Functional polymorphism in genes encoding for the enzymes responsible for paclitaxel and 
lapatinib metabo lism have also been identified within the hepatic CYP450 family.  For instanc e, 
paclitaxel is converted to p-3′-hydroxypaclitaxel by CYP3A4 and C YP2C8 catalyzes the formation 
of 6  -hydroxypaclitaxel.62   We will evaluate these and oth er CYP genes involved in pac litaxel and 
lapatinib metabo lism including CYP2C19 a nd CYP3A5 for the presence of previously identified 
polymorphisms. 
 
Determining of the extent to which functional polymorphism in drug metabolism results in altered 
toxicity has the potential to be applicable in multiple regimens and malignancies and in the future 
may allow us to identify a sub-population that is at increased for toxicity, thus helping to inform 
treatment decisions. 
 
Cardiac  Biomark ers 
Cardiac toxicity is a potentially grave toxicity of certain cytotoxic chemotherapy agents, particularly 
the anthracycline drugs. In the adjuvant setting where cure is the goal, potential long- term cardiac 
sequelae of treatment are particularly relevant.  Early detection of evolving cardiac damage and  
the institution of medical management may help to decrease the morbidity ass ociated with cardiac 
toxicity.  The use of angiotensin con verting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been sh own in s tudies to 
reduce the risk of developing symptomatic heart failure or cardiac de ath in patients with 
asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.62 Research has focused on  the development and 
validation of cardiac biomarkers that might identify subclinical card iac damage

 and patients who may benefit from card ioprotective measures.  Preliminary data suggests that the 
use of ACE inhibitors may prevent cardiac toxicity in patients receiving high-dose ch emotherapy 
identified as increased risk on the basis of cardiac biomarkers.63 To date, the majority of 
experience with cardiac biomarkers has been in the se tting of anthracycline ch emotherapy.64 
 
 
Cardiac Troponins 
The incidence of elevation of cardiac troponins I or T (cTnI or cTnT) with each ch emotherapy cycle 
may be as h igh as 30-34% in patients treated with potentially cardiotoxic (prima rily anthracycline) 
chemotherapy across  studies. The etiology of the troponin rise app ears to be non- ischemic as it is 
not associated with symptoms or classical EKG changes, and it predates LV dysfunction rather 
than accompan ying it. Troponin determination in breast cancer patients has been found to predict 
the occurrence of clinically significant LV d ysfunction as well as the degree a nd severity of future 
LV dysfunction. Cardinale and co lleagues studied 211 patients receiving high dose  therapy  for 
breast cancer (mean age 46) using cardiac troponin I (cTnI) measurements at six time points 
before and after each chemotherapy cycle (up to 72 hours after) and correlated these to ECHO 
findings at 1,2,3,4,7 and 12 months.65 A close relationship was found between the maximal cTnI 
value obtained and  maximum LVEF decrement seen in follow up. In addition, there was a 
significant correlation between the number of positive cTnI values and the LVEF maximal 
decrement. The presen ce of normal cTnI levels after therapy was assoc iated with no significant 
decline in LVEF in follow-up. A study in 79 patients with leukemia measured cTnI at various 
intervals during induction  therapy, and found elevated cTnI levels at day 7-14 correlated with 
reversible dec reases in LVEF.66 Reports of smaller patient cohorts ranging from 15 to 31 patients 
showed more variable levels of cTnI detection after anthracycline therapy.67-69 There are now 
emerging data on the utility of cardiac biomarkers in patients treated with anti-HER2 agents after 
an anthracycline based treatment, and the data are mixed. 70-71At MSKCC, we recently showed 
that 67% of patients had an elevated cTNI during the THL phase (after dd AC) but these patients 
were asymptomatic. This may reflect a subtle c ardiac injury related to the treatment.70 Cardinale 
et al, on the other hand, reported in their group  of patients, treated with trastuzumab  after an 
anthracycline-based treatment, that those with elevated TNIs are at risk for trastuzumab  induced 
cardiac toxicity.71 
 
 
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) 
Natriuretic peptides are rapidly produc ed by the heart in response to hemodynamic stress.  Both 
BNP and NT-proBNP are widely tested in heart failure as markers of heart failure diagnosis, 
prognosis, and overall risk assessment.64 Several s tudies examined BNP levels at prolonged 
intervals from chemotherapy. A Dutch study evaluated BNP and NT-BNP levels at two time points 
after anthracycline ch emotherapy: a median of 2.7 years later, and a median of 6.5 years 
afterwards.72   Elevated BNP levels were found in 14 out of 54 patients 6.5 years after 
chemotherapy. The BNP levels were significantly higher in patients receiving 450 mg/m2 
epirubicin than those who received 360 mg/m2. Cardiac function was not assess ed. However, a 
similar study evaluating BNP levels in 63 patients at least 1 year from anthracycline therapy found 
cardiac dysfunction in 41% and significantly higher mean BNPs in this group.73 Similar results of 
elevated BNP levels in assoc iation with reduced left ventricular function have been d ocume nted in 
the pediatric literature after anthracycline exposure.  
 
 
 
Cardiac biomarkers with trastuzumab

Page  13 of 69  
 Limited data exist regarding the use  of cardiac biomarkers as predictors of cardiac toxicity in 
patients treated with trastuzumab.  Plasma cTnI and NT-proBNP levels were assa yed in 15 
patients taking part in a study of an imaging modality (indium-111 labeled trastuzumab 
scintigraphy) as a predictor of cardiac toxicity.74 Patients received trastuzumab  as part of a non - 
anthracycline co ntaining regimen. While the imaging test was not sh own to be of value, pre- 
treatment plasma NT-proBNP levels were found to be higher in patients who developed cardiac 
toxicity. A pilot study examined and established novel measures  of metabolic and vascular risk 
factors for cardiovascular disease (including BNP) in a small subset of patients participating in the 
BCIRG 006 adjuvant trastuzumab  study.75 Patients entered the study a median of 20 months after 
the completion of chemotherapy and trastuzumab.  In this study, 38.4% of patients had an LVEF 
value 10% or more below their baseline ass essment; BNP was significantly elevated in 40% of 
patients and was a predictor of LVEF on univariate ana lysis. In N9831, an adjuvant study of 
anthracycline and taxane-based ch emotherapy with trastuzumab  vs chemotherapy alone, a study 
correlating cardiac biomarkers including BNP, C-reactive pepti de (CRP), and troponin T and I with 
LVEF was cond ucted.  Elevations in BNP and cTnI at baseline and doubling of BNP during trial 
were seen as possibly predictive of cardiac toxicity in a small subset of patients.76 
 
Neuregulin 
Neuregulin-1 (NRG -1) is a cardioprotective, paracrine growth factor released by  microvascular 
endothelial cells.  This pathway, which is neces sary for the maintenance of cardiac function and 
survival during states of increased  stress, is believed to be an important mediator of heart failure 
and che motherapy-induced card iac dysfunction.77  In vitro studies demonstrate that NRG-1 
administration pr otects doxorubicin-treated cardiomyocytes from myofibrillar disarray and death, 
and NRG-1 or ErbB2 deficient mice have dramatically worse survival with anthracycline 
exposure.78-80 Trastuzumab, and pertuzumab, sp ecifically target the ErbB2 receptor, a mediator of 
NRG-1 activity, and its association with clinical card iac dysfunction may be related to effects on 
this signaling pathway.80 
 
In order to define the mechanistic and translational significance of NRG-1 signaling in humans, Ky 
and colleagues recently quantified serum NRG-1ß levels in a large coh ort (N=899) of patients with 
chron ic heart failure in the Penn Heart Failure Study.81 Elevated NRG-1ß levels were significantly 
associated with more advanced h eart failure (NYHA Class IV median 6.2 ng/ml versus  those with 
Class I CHF 4.4 ng/ml, p=0.002). Furthermore, NRG-1ß was independently associated with an 
elevated risk of all-cause death or cardiac transplantation over a median follow-up of 2.4 years 
(adjusted HR 1.58, 95% C.I of 1.04-2.3, p=0.003), comp aring the 4th vs the 1st quartile of NRG-1ß. 
Associations differed according to heart failure cause a nd severity, with stronger relationships 
observed in those with ischemic he art failure (interaction p=0.008) and advanced NYHA Class 
III/IV symptoms (interaction p= 0.01).  In addition, patients with chemotherapy-induced cardiac 
dysfunction had significant alterations in their circulating NRG-1 ß levels compared  to all other 
etiologies (p=0.02). 
 
Our goal is to extend these findings and provide further insight of the potential clinical relevance 
of cTnI, BNP and NRG-1ß  on chemotherapy-induced cardiac dysfunction. We will quantify the 
relationship of these cardiac biomarkers with incident cardiac dysfunction by serial 
echocardiogram imaging. We hope to develop an  understanding of the predictive utility of these 
biomarkers.

 As of A(6), we will no longer be quantifying the relationship between NRG-1ß cardiac biomarkers 
and incident cardiac dysfunction by  serial echocardiogram imaging since the incidence of cardiac 
dysfunction based on the LVEF data has been minimal. 
 
Echocardiograms (and Strain Imaging Analysis for research purposes): 
 
Echocardiograms will be p erformed at months 2, 6, 9, 12 and 18 of treatment as defined in the 
study.  Strain imaging will be a nalyzed of f-line us ing 2D image loops from the routine 
echocardiographic examination. The ECHO machine for the strain imaging ana lysis should be 
the Vivid 7 or E9 machine (GE healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). In add ition to being stored in the main 
ECHO PACS system, these s tudies will also be  stored in an external GE workstation which 
contains the software needed to perform the strain imaging analysis. To calculate strain and  strain 
rate, the LV  myocardium is traced in a click-to-point approach.  Subsequently, the software 
automatically defines an epicardial and myocardial line and processes a ll frames  of the loop. The 
myocardium in each of the 3 standard apical views is divided into 6 segments.  The software will 
automatically calculate strain and strain rate for each of the 18 segments plus a global value for 
the entire myocardium. These measurements will be made by a des ignated investigator (Dr. 
Jennifer Liu) blinded to patient identification, demographics and clinical ch aracteristics at the end 
of the study. When possible any  ECHOs done outside of MSKCC are  requested  to be done on 
the GE Vivid 7 or E9 machine (GE healthcare, Milwaukee, WI),  and the disc to be sent to Dr. 
Jennifer Liu for the strain imaging analysis. 
 
Rationale 
 
With great a dvances made with che motherapy combinations in breast cancer outcomes and 
trastuzumab  in HER2-positive breast cancer cells, there is always room for improvemen t.  Most 
patients enrolled onto clinical trials for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer had nod e- 
positive disease, and the majority received an a nthracycline and taxane-based treatment with 
trastuzumab.  This led to a significant improvement in DFS and OS with an acceptab le 2-4% risk 
of cardiac events. The optimal  treatment for a lower risk group, such as  those with nod e-negative 
HER2-positive disease, n eeds to be studied further. With emerging data demonstrating better 
outcomes with dual a nti-HER2 therapy in metastatic b reast cancer and improved pCR rates in the 
neoadjuvant setting ,39, 40 it is important to study a dual anti-HER2 treatment with a taxane in this 
lower risk group,  but omit the anthracycline (such as AC) to avoid the added risk of cardiac 
toxicity. 
 
Lapatinib is one of the most exciting targeted drugs and the simultaneous inhibition of  HER2 with 
lapatinib and trastuzumab has shown to be effective in the metastatic setting39 and may allow for 
more potent inhibition of cell growth than one line of anti-HER2 therapy.  Previous studies sho wed 
that the rate of G 3 d iarrhea was on ly 7 % when lapatinib (1250-1500mg) was given with 
paclitaxel (135-225 mg/m2) every 3 weeks, but it was 50%  when given with weekly paclitaxel  (80 
m/m2).39 Citron et al showed that the incidence of G 3 d iarrhea was extremely low at 2 % versus  
1% with pac litaxel (175 mg/m2) given every 3 versus  2 weeks (dose de nse), respectively.5   It 
remains unanswered if lapatinib at 1,000 mg with trastuzumab, as established by Storniolo27, can 
be better administered with dos e-dense pac litaxel as p art of adjuvant therapy for early HER2- 
amplified breast cancer.  Based on previous data, we hypothesize that dose-dense p aclitaxel may 
be better tolerated when comb ined with lapatinib (1000 mg) and trastuzumab.  
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER 
IRB#:13-002 A (7) 
Approved: 28 Mar 2017 
Page  15 of 69  
 We seek to address this in a phase II trial of adjuvant chemotherapy with dos e-dense p aclitaxel 
every two weeks with weekly trastuzumab  and daily lapatinib (1,000  mg) followed by  the 
comp letion of a year of trastuzumab  (administered every three weeks) a nd lapatinib therapy. We 
choose p aclitaxel every two weeks as it is may be the more optimal taxane sched ule to combine 
with a full dose of lapatinib (1000 mg) and trastuzumab, with poss ibly a lower diarrhea toxicity risk 
than what has been reported with weekly paclitaxel.  However, we may still uncover significant 
G3-4 diarrhea with this new THL combination. There may be an interaction between pac litaxel 
and lapatinib and b oth drugs are metabolized by  CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2C8, and lapatinib 
is additionally metabo lized by CYP2C19.  Toxicities of these 2 drugs may also be  influenced by 
variants of drug transporter genes, such as  ABCB 1 and A BCG2. Thus, we will perform 
exploratory analyses on  allele frequencies of these cand idate genes. 
 
Since the incidence of G3-4 cardiac events of a previous adjuvant taxane and trastuzumab  study 
(BCIRG 006 )16 was reported as  < 1%, we anticipate that we will observe a low cardiac event 
(symptomatic CHF or ca rdiac death) rate with this study regimen as an  anthracycline is omitted. 
However, it is still unknown the long-term card iac event rate as well as the implication of 
asymptomatic LVEF dec lines over time. Thus, it will be important to explore cardiac biomarkers 
and correlate them with LVEF dec lines (both symptomatic and significant asymptomatic drops as 
defined by our study). Thus, as a correlative study we will evaluate potential card iac biomarkers 
(cardiac troponin I, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)) to ass ess if there is a  correlation 
between elevated markers and decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on 
echocardiogram (ECHO) imaging.  Additionally, for research purposes c ardiac strain imaging will 
be done with each E CHO when poss ible. 
 
4.0 OVERVI EW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVE NTION  
 
4.1 Design 
 
This is a phase  II trial of dose-dense a djuvant chemotherapy for patients with nod e-negativeHER- 
2/neu  overexpressed/ amplified breast cancer. The regimen consists of paclitaxel (T) at 175 
mg/m2 q 2 weeks x 4 with filgrastim/pegfilgrastim + trastuzumab (H) + daily oral lapatinib (L), 
followed by trastuzumab  q 3 weeks x 15 doses +  daily oral lapatinib (HL). Pegfilgrastim 6mg will 
be given su bcutaneo usly (SQ) on d ay # 2 of each paclitaxel administration.  Filgrastim may be 
used in lieu of pegfilgrastim at the physician’s discretion. Trastuzumab  will be a dministered 
weekly (4 mg/kg bolus followed by  2 mg/kg weekly) starting with pac litaxel treatment cycle # 1. 
After completion of 4 cycles of paclitaxel, patients will receive trastuzumab  on a q 3 weeks x 15 
doses (to comp lete about one year). The q 3 week trastuzumab  may be started at  the last dose 
of paclitaxel infusion or from 1-3 weeks after the last dose of paclitaxel. A total of 15 infusions of 
trastuzumab  will be given q 3 weeks after the completion of paclitaxel during the HL phase. 
Lapatinib will be given orally at 1000 mg daily, starting with paclitaxel during the THL phase  and 
continued for the remaining year during the HL phase for about a year. 
 
We plan to accrue 55 evaluable patients with HER2-amplified bre ast cancer to this trial within 12 
months.  Endpoints for removal from the study are unacc eptable toxicity, progression of disease 
while of study drugs, death, and patient withdrawal from study. 
 
One sample of blood (10 ml in EDTA) will be co llected for pharmacogenomics analysis. This may 
be done at any point during the study regimen, but preferably at the beginning of the treatment.

 Cardiac biomarkers (troponin I, B-type na triuretic peptide, neuregulin-1ß) will be seri ally followed 
throughout the study period.  Baseline values will be obtained and  biomarker testing will occur 
pre- and post-infusion of each pac litaxel and trastuzumab  administration every 2 weeks x 4 
(during THL phase).  Biomarkers will then be drawn pre- and post- infusion of trastuzumab  at 
every other  cycle (approximately every 6 weeks) x 7 draws (during HL phase). 
 
Echocardiograms (with strain) and EKGs will be o btained at b aseline and at months 2, 6, 9, 12, 
18 (+/- 4 weeks) following the start of chemotherapy.

This is a phase  II study of lapatinib in c ombination with trastuzumab  and paclitaxel for the 
treatment of patients with early-stage node negative HER2 (+) breast cancer.  Based on 
promising results of the combination of  lapatinib and trastuzumab  in a metastatic population and 
better responses seen in the neoadjuvant setting39-40 it makes sense to test this combination with 
paclitaxel given in a dose-dense e very 2 week regimen in the treatment of patients with low-risk 
node negative HER2-positive breast cancer. With the superiority of every 2 week over every 3 
week schedule of paclitaxel5, 8 and since there are less toxicities seen with every 3 week 
paclitaxel than weekly paclitaxel,29 it is worthwhile to combine dose-dense  every 2 week paclitaxel 
with trastuzumab  and lapatinib. 
 
The regimen will consist of paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) every 2 weeks x 4 + trastuzumab  weekly (4 
mg/kg loading dose → 2 mg/kg ) b oth given intravenously (IV) + lapatinib 100 0mg orally daily. 
After the completion of paclitaxel, trastuzumab  (6 mg/kg IV q 3 weeks) x 15 and l apatinib (1000 
mg daily) will be given to comp lete the year’s duration.  Pegfilgrastim SQ is given on d ay # 2 of 
each pac litaxel cycle and may be dropped at the last paclitaxel infusion. Filgrastim  may be us ed 
in lieu of pegfilgrastim at the physician’s discretion.

 Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes microtubu le assemb ly and stabilizes 
tubulin polymers by preventing their depolarization, resulting in the formation of extremely 
stable and nonfunctional microtubu les, and consequently inhibition of  many cell functions. 
The dose of paclitaxel is 175 mg/m2 IV every 2 weeks. 
 
Paclitaxel is commercially available. 
b.  Preparation 
Paclitaxel will be prepar ed as per MSKCC chemotherapy guidelines (MSKCC and 
affiliates). 
 
c.   Administration 
 
Treatment may be administered in an outpatient setting by administration of 175 mg/m2 IV 
every 2 weeks. If paclitaxel is being administered concomitantly with trastuzumab, 
chemotherapy administration may be given before or after either antibody.  A strict 
sequence of administration of paclitaxel relative to trastuzumab  is not mandated.  Patients 
should be observed for fever and chills or other infusion associated symptoms.  
 
d.  Storage 
 
Unopened vials of paclitaxel are  stable until the date as indicated  on the package.  Vials of 
paclitaxel should be stored at  20-25º C (68-77º F) in the original package. Neither 
freezing nor refrigeration adversely affects the stability of the product.  Upon refrigeration, 
compon ents of paclitaxel may precipitate but will re-dissolve upon reaching room 
temperature with little or no agitation.

Trastuzumab  (Herceptin®) 
 
a.  Dosage 
 
The recommended initial loading dose is 4  mg/kg (for weekly dosing sch edules) or 8 
mg/kg (for every 3 weeks) Herceptin administered as a 90-minute infusion. The 
recommended maintenance Herceptin dose  is 2 mg/kg weekly or 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks 
and can  be administered as a 30-minute infusion if the initial loading dose was well

 tolerated.  Herceptin may be administered in an outpatient setting.  DO NOT ADMINISTER 
AS AN IV PUSH OR BOLUS (see ADMINISTRATION). 
 
b.  Preparation 
 
Use appro priate aseptic technique.  Each vial of Hercep tin should be reconstituted with 20 
mL of BWFI, USP, 1.1% benzyl alcohol preser ved, as supplied, to yield a multidose 
solution con taining 21 mg/mL Herceptin. Immediately upon reconstitution with BWFI, the 
vial of Herceptin must be labeled in the area marked “Do not use after” with the future date 
that is 28 days from the date of reconstitution. 
 
If the patient has known hypersensitivity to ben zyl alcohol, Herceptin must be reconstituted 
with Sterile Water for Injection (see PRECAU TIONS).  Herceptin which has  been 
reconstituted with SWFI must be used immediately and any  unused portion discarde d. 
Use of other reconstitution diluents should be avoided. 
 
Determine the dose of Hercep tin needed.  Calculate the correct dose us ing 21 mg/mL 
Hercep tin solution. Withdraw  this amou nt from the vial and add it  to an infusion bag 
containing 250 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride, USP.  DEXTROSE (5%) SOLUTION 
SHOULD NOT BE USED.  Gently invert the bag to mix the so lution. The reconstituted 
prepar ation results in a colorless to pale yellow transparent solution. Parenteral drug 
products  should be inspected visually for particulates and discoloration prior to 
administration. No incompatibilities be tween Herceptin and polyvinylchloride or 
polyethylene bags have been o bserved. 
 
c.   Administration 
 
Treatment may be administered in an outpatient setting by administration of a 4 mg/kg 
Hercep tin loading dose for weekly dosing sch edules (OR 8 mg/kg Herceptin loading dose 
for q3wk dosing schedules) by intravenous (IV) infusion over 90 minutes. DO NOT 
ADMINISTER AS AN IV PUSH OR BOLUS.  If Hercep tin is being administered 
concomita ntly with che motherapy, Herceptin administration may be given before or after 
chemotherapy administration.  Patients should be obser ved for fever and chills or other 
infusion associated symptoms (see ADVERS E REAC TIONS). If prior infusions are well 
tolerated subsequent doses of 2 mg/kg Herceptin weekly (OR 6 mg/kg Herceptin q3wk) 
may be administered over 30 minutes. 
 
Hercep tin should not be  mixed or  diluted with other drugs.  Herceptin infusions should not 
be administered or mixed with Dextrose so lutions. 
 
d.  Storage 
 
Vials of Herceptin are stable at 2C–8C (36F–46F) prior to reconstitution.  Do not use 
beyond the expiration date stamped  on the vial.  A vial of Herceptin reconstituted with 
BWFI, as supplied, is stable for 28 days after reconstitu tion when stored refrigerated at 
2C–8C (36F–46F), and the solution is preserved for multiple use.  Discard  any 
remaining multi-dose reconstituted solution after 28 days.  If unpreserved SWFI (not 
supplied) is used, the reconstituted Herceptin solution sh ould be used immediately and

 any unused portion must be d iscarded. DO NOT FREEZE HERCEP TIN THAT HAS 
BEEN RECONSTITUTED. 
 
The solution of Herceptin for infusion diluted in polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags 
containing 0. 9% sodium chloride for injection, USP, may be stored at 2C–8C (36F– 
46F) for up to 24 hours prior to use.  Diluted Herceptin has been shown to be stable for 
up to 24 hours at room temper ature 15C–25C; however, since d iluted Hercep tin contains 
no effective preservative the reconstituted and diluted solution should be stored 
refrigerated (2C–8C). 
 
e.  Safety 
 
Infusion-Associated Symptoms. During the first infusion with Herceptin, a symptom 
comp lex consisting of chills and/or fever is observed in appro ximately 40% of patients. 
Other signs and/or symptoms may include naus ea, vomiting, pain, rigors, headache, 
cough, dizziness, rash, and asthen ia. These symptoms are usually mild to moderate in 
severity, and occ ur infrequently with subs equent Hercep tin infusions. These symptoms 
can be  treated with an analgesic/antipyretic such  as meperidine or paracetamol, or an 
antihistamine such as  diphenhydramine. 
 
Serious Infusion-Associated Events. Serious adverse reactions to Herceptin infusion 
including dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen 
saturation and respiratory distress ha ve been  reported infrequently.   In rare cas es (4 per 
10,000), these events were associated with a clinical co urse culminating in a fatal 
outcome. Serious reactions ha ve been  treated with supp ortive therapy such as oxygen, 
beta-agonists, corticosteroids and withdrawal of Hercep tin as indicated.  
 
Hematologic Toxicity.  In the clinical trials, an increased incidence of anemia was observed 
in patients receiving Herceptin plus chemotherapy comp ared with patients receiving 
chemotherapy alone.  The majority of these a nemia events were mild or moderate in 
intensity and reversible; none resulted in discontinuation of Hercep tin therapy. In the 
clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of moderate to severe neutropenia and of febrile 
neutropenia were higher in patients receiving Herceptin in c ombination with 
myelosuppress ive che motherapy as comp ared to those who received ch emotherapy 
alone.  In the post marketing se tting, deaths due to seps is in patients with severe 
neutropenia have been  reported in patients receiving Hercep tin and myelosuppressive 
chemotherapy, although in con trolled clinical trials (pre- and post-marketing), the 
incidence of septic deaths was not  significantly increase d. The pathophysiologic basis for 
exacerbation of neutropenia has  not been determined; the effect of Herceptin on the 
pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutic agents has not been fully evaluated. The observed 
incidence of leukemia among Herceptin-treated patients appears to be consistent with the 
expected incidence of leukemia among patients treated with che motherapy for metastatic 
breast ca ncer. Therefore, the co ntribution of Herceptin to the etiology of acute leukemia 
or myelodysplastic s yndrome in these cases is unclear.

Lapatinib is a dual inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or ErbB1) and ErbB2 
tyrosine kinases. Lapatinib is supplied as 250 mg oval, biconvex, orange film-coated tablets 
with one side plain and the opposite side de-bossed with FG HLS. The tablets contain 410 
mg of lapatinib Ditosylate Monoh ydrate, equivalent to 250 mg lapatinib free base per tablet. 
The tablets are packaged into HDPE bottles with child-resistant closures. Excipients present 
in the tablet include: Microcrystalline ce llulose, povidone, sodium starch glycolate, and 
magnesium stearate. The film-coat contains: Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, titanium 
dioxide, triacetin/glycerol triacetate, and yellow iron oxide. 
 
The dosage for this study is 1000 mg orally daily. 
Lapatinib is commercially available . 
Suspension in Water 
 
Place 4 oz  of water in a glass container, then add four 250 mg lapatinib tablets to the 
container.  Cover the container, let it stand for 5 minutes, and then stir the mixture 
intermittently for 10-20 minutes or u ntil it is fully dispersed.  Stir the container for 5 
seconds then administer.  Rinse the co ntainer with a 2 oz aliquot of water a nd administer 
(total of 6 oz of liquid is dispensed). 
 
b.  Administration 
 
Lapatinib 1000 mg is taken orally on an empty stomach (either 1 hour before or 1 hour after 
meals). 
 
c.   Storage 
 
The intact b ottles should be stored at controlled room temperature (15°C-30°C).  Shelf life 
surveillance studies of the intact bottle are on-going.  Current data indicates lapatinib is 
stable for at least 2 years at controlled room temperature (15°C - 30°C). 
 
d.  Safety (See Treatment/Intervention Section 9.0  below for details regarding management 
of toxicity) 
 
Cardiotoxicity. Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) have been reported 
(usually within the first 3 months of treatment); baseline and periodic LVEF evaluations are 
recommended. Interrupt therapy or decrease do se with dec reased L VEF ≥ grade 2  or 
LVEF < LLN. Use with cau tion in cond itions which may impair left ventricular function and 
in patients with a history of or predisposed (prior treatment with anthracyclines, chest wall 
irradiation) to left ventricular dysfunction. Interruption of therapy is recommended with 
decreased L VEF ≥ grade 2. 
 
Diarrhea. Diarrhea is common, may be se vere. Management  with antidiarrheal agents is 
recommended and severe diarrhea may require hydration, electrolytes, dose reduction or 
interruption of therapy. 
 
Hepatotoxicity. [U.S. Boxed Warning]: Hepatotoxicity (ALT or  AST >3 times ULN and total 
bilirubin >2 times ULN) has been reported with lapatinib and  may be se vere and/or fatal. 
Onset may occur within days to several months after treatment initiation. Monitoring liver

 function is recommended (at baseline and during treatment); with permanent 
discontinuation recommended with severe changes in liver function during treatment. 
Caution is advised in patients with hep atic impairment. 
 
Pulmonary toxicity. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pne umonitis have been reported with 
lapatinib monotherapy and combination ch emotherapy.  Monitoring for pulmonary 
symptoms which may indicate ILD or pneumonitis is recommended.  Discontinuation of 
therapy is recommended for grade 3  (or higher) pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD or 
pneumonitis. 
 
QTc prolongation. QTc prolongation has been observed. Caution is advised in patients with 
a history of QTc prolongation or  with medications known to prolong the QT interval. 
Baseline and periodic 12-lead ECG are  recommended. 
 
Concurrent drug therapy issues: 
 
High potential for interactions. Avoid use  with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. 
 
QTc-prolonging agents. Concurrent use with other drugs which may prolong QTc interval 
may increase  the risk of potentially-fatal arrhythmias. 
 
Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) 
 
Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta is a covalent conjugate of recombinant methionyl human G-CSF 
(Filgrastim) and monomethoxypolyethylene glycol.  Both pegfilgrastim and filgrastim are colony- 
stimulating factors that act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors 
thereby stimulating proliferation, differentiation, commitment, and end  cell functional acti vation. 
Studies on  cellular proliferation, receptor binding, and neutrophil function demonstrate that 
Filgrastim and pegfilgrastim have the same mechanism of action.  Pegfilgrastim  has reduced 
renal clearance and prolonged persistence in vivo as  compared to Filgrastim. 
 
Pegfilgrastim is indicated  to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by  febrile 
neutropenia, in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer 
drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neu tropenia. 
 
The standard dose of pegfilgrastim is 6 mg SQ  given on the day after (day # 2) chemotherapy 
cycle. This may be dropped at  the last infusion of paclitaxel. 
 
Clinical Experience 
 
Pegfilgrastim was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, active-control studies, using 
doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and doceta xel 75  mg/m2 administered every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in 
the treatment of patients with high-risk stage II or stage III/IV breast cancer (68-69). Study 1 
investigated the utility of a fixed dose of pegfilgrastim. Study 2 used a weight-adjusted  dose.  In 
the absence  of growth factor support, similar chemotherapy regimens have been  reported to 
result in a 100% incidence of severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/L) with a mean duration of 5 to 
7 days, and a 30 to 40% incidence of febrile neutropenia (70). 
 
In study 1, 157 su bjects were randomized to receive a single SC d ose of 6 mg of pegfilgrastim on 
day 2 of each ch emotherapy cycle or filgrastim 5 ug/kg/day SC beginning on day 2 of each cycle. 
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER 
IRB#:13-002 A (7) 
Approved: 28 Mar 2017 
Page  22 of 69  
 In study 2, 310 subjects were randomized to receive a single SC injection of pegfilgrastim at 100 
ug/kg on day 2 or filgrastim 5 ug/kg/day  SC beginning on day 2 of each cycle of chemotherapy. 
Both studies met the primary objective of demonstrating that the mean days of severe 
neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/L) of pegfilgrastim-treated patients did not exceed that of filgrastim- 
treated patients by more than 1 day in cycle 1 of chemotherapy.  The rates of febrile neut ropenia 
were 13% and 9% for pegfilgrastim vs. 20% and 18% for Filgrastim in studies 1 and 2, 
respectively.  Other secondary endpoints included days of severe neutropenia in c ycles 2 to 4, the 
depth of ANC nadir in cycles 1 to 4, and the time to ANC recovery after nadir.  In both studies, the 
results for the secondary endpoints were similar between the two treatment groups  (68, 69). 
 
The safety and efficacy of once-per cycle pegfi lgrastim  was also found to be comp arable to daily 
Filgrastim in studies in patients with non-small cell lung cancer being treated with carboplatin a nd 
paclitaxel and patients with NHL or Hodgkin’s lymphoma being treated with ESHAP or CHOP 
chemotherapy (71-73). Pegfilgrastim has also been found to be safe when given in dos e-dense 
AC → T q 2 weekly regimen (74). 
 
Filgrastim (Neupogen®) 
 
Filgrastim is a human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), pro duced by recombinant 
DNA technology. G-CSF is a  175 amino aid protein produced by E. Coli bacteria into which has 
been inserted human G-CSF gene. G-CSF regulates the production of neutrophils within the 
bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation, differentiation, antibody dependent 
killing, and the increased express ion of some functions associated with cell surface a ntigens. 
 
G-CSF is a sterile, clear, colorless, pr eservative-free liquid for parenteral administration 
(subcutane ous).  Each vial of G-CSF contains 300 mcg/ml of filgrastim.  Intact vials must be 
stored under refrigeration at 2-8°C.  Prolonged exposure of G-CSF to temperatures outside this 
range can  inactivate the drug. 
 
The standard dose of filgrastim is 5 mcg/kg given SQ daily over the course of several d ays 
depending on the chemotherapy regimen. 
 
Side-effects include chills, fever, nausea, anorexia, myalgia, bone pain, local injection site pain or 
inflammation, elevated liver function, thinning of hair, enlargement of spleen, and rarely fluid 
retention.

9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN 
 
Paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) IV every 14 days x 4 and trastuzumab  (4 mg/kg loading dose, then 2 
mg/kg weekly) IV and lapatinib (1000 mg oral daily); followed by  trastuzumab  (6 mg/kg IV every 3 
weeks) x 15 doses and lapatinib (1000 mg oral daily) to comp lete abo ut a year of treatment. 
Trastuzumab  at a q 3 week dosage may be given at final paclitaxel infusion. A total of 15 
infusions of trastuzumab will be given q 3  weeks during the HL phase. 
 
During treatment with pac litaxel, pegfilgrastim will be given 24 h ours after the comp letion of 
chemotherapy and may be stopped at the last paclitaxel infusion. Filgrastim may be us ed in lieu 
of pegfilgrastim at physician’s discretion. 
 
Note: Physicians may omit pegfilgrastim (or filgrastim) after cycle # 4 of paclitaxel. 
 
Total duration of trastuzumab  and lapatinib therapy is one year. 
 
 
 
Paclitaxel 
 
Paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) IV every 2 weeks x 4 will be administered. 
 
Premed ications for paclitaxel:  Patients should receive the standard IV dexamethasone 
10-20 mg (or a steroid equivalent), diphenhydramine 50  mg (or another H1-blocker), and 
an H2-blocker about 30 minutes before pac litaxel infusion. If patients do not experience a 
hypersensitivity reaction after the first 2 doses of paclitaxel, premedications can be  altered 
at physician’s discretion. 
 
 
 
 
Dose Modifications: 
 
This study will use the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) AE version 4.0 for toxicity. 
 
After each paclitaxel treatment, dose adjustments of the taxane shou ld be based on 
hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities.  Patients experiencing neutropenic fever 
(ANC <1 ,000/µL and body temper ature 38.5°C) will have a 25%  dose reduction. Only 
one dose  reduction is allowed. (ie: 175 mg/m2 →130 mg/m2). Physicians may use 
antibiotics as  secondary proph ylaxis as deemed  appropriate. 
 
• If on the day that paclitaxel is due, platelet counts are <100,000/µL and/or ANC 
<100 0/µL and/or non-hematologic toxicities (excluding alopecia and  neuropathy) have 
not recovered to Grade 1, treatment should be delayed by  up to 1 week and CBC and 
toxicity grading repeated weekly.  If platelet co unt and ANC and non-hematologic 
toxicity have not  recovered to Grade 1, a further delay of up to1 week is required.  If 
LFTs are checked, paclitaxel can be  given at full dose without delay if SGO T/SGPT 
are at < Grade 2, and bilirubin is at < Grade 1. If the SGO T/SGPT are at > Grade 3 or 
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER 
IRB#:13-002 A (7) 
Approved: 28 Mar 2017 
Page  26 of 69  
 bilirubin is at  > Grade 2, LFTS should be checked weekly and pac litaxel can be h eld 
until the SGOT/SGPT have recovered to < Grade 2 and b ilirubin < at Grade 1.  Up to 
3 weeks (21 days) are  allowed for the appropriate recovery. If the SGOT/SGPT have 
not recovered to < Grade 2 and  bilirubin at < Grade 1 within 3 weeks, the patient will 
be taken off study treatment. Of note, even if the toxicity is felt to be due to lapatinib, 
paclitaxel treatment will not resume unless a ll of the appropriate hematologic and 
nonhematologic parameters are met.. 
 
• Hypersens itivity reactions:  Please see  Appendix B for treatment. Treatment should 
be discontinued for Grade 4 hypersensitivity reactions.  There are no dose reductions 
for hypersensitivity reactions.  Consider discontinuation of taxane therapy if patient 
experiences 2  episodes of Grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction. 
 
Trastuzumab  
 
Trastuzumab  loading dose (4 mg/kg) IV will be administered on same day as pac litaxel 
cycle # 1 and is  continued weekly at the dose of 2 mg/kg IV for the duration of paclitaxel 
treatment. Trastuzumab  may also be  administered at a dose  of 6mg/kg during the last 
dose of paclitaxel in the THL phase. At the comp letion of paclitaxel, patients will receive 
trastuzumab  on a q 3 week schedule at 6 mg/kg IV. Each trastuzumab  q 3 week cycle at 6 
mg/kg is equivalent to 3 trastuzumab  weekly treatments at 2 mg/kg.  The duration of 
trastuzumab  from beginning to end is about a year. 
 
Note:  Patients should not miss more than one q 3 week dose of trastuzumab 
consecutively (except when those missed  doses are ass ociated with a HOLD and 
REPEA T for asymptomatic LVEF dec lines as per table below).  Patients do not  have to 
make up missed d oses. 
 
Premed ications for trastuzumab  
For the first (loading) dose of trastuzumab, premedication with ace taminophen 650  mg po 
will be given. 
 
Dose Modifications 
Dose modification of trastuzumab  is not permitted.

Patients who experience significant “asymptomatic” LVEF decline while on trastuzumab  + 
lapatinib which results in permanent discontinuation of H + L will be followed long-term. 
These patients will be se en in the cardiology clinic.  Follow-up ECHOs or MUGAs will be 
performed every 3-6 months until 6 months since the last H + L exposure.  If any of these 
patients experiences CHF or card iac death later during follow-up, the event will be 
considered a true cardiac event and will be co unted towards the stopping rule as defined 
in sec tion 13.0. 
 
Note:  If an ECHO ca nnot be done, a MUGA may be performed. 
 
Note:  If patients are restarted on trastuzumab  and > 2 weeks have lapsed since the last 
intend ed “q 3 week” dose of trastuzumab, then patients sh ould have a re-loading dose of 
trastuzumab  at (8 mg/kg followed by q 3 week dose of 6 mg/kg).

 Note: Patients will receive 15  doses of trastuzumab every 3 weeks during the HL phase. If 
trastuzumab  dose is held for cardiac toxicity, this dose does not need to be made up once 
the patient is re-started on anti-HER2 therapy. In other words, the duration of therapy 
should be about a year from beginning to end. 
 
Lapatinib 
 
 
Lapatinib Adm inistration 
 
Patients should be advised to take lapatinib on an empty stomach (either 1 hour  before or 1 hour

 presents  as uncomp licated NCI CTCAE Grade 1 or 2 (G1 54%, G2 20%, G3 15%, 
G4<1%). 
 
In rare cases, diarrhea can be d ebilitating, and potentially life threatening if accompanied 
by dehydration, renal insufficiency, and/or electrolyte imba lances. 
 
Standardized and universal guidelines have been  developed by  an American Society of 
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) panel for treating chemotherapy-induced diarrhea [Benson, 
2004]. Presented in the sections be low are the recommended guidelines for the 
management of diarrhea in subjects receiving lapatinib-based therapy; these guidelines 
were derived from the recommendations pub lished by the ASCO panel [Benson, 2004]. 
 
Early identification and intervention is critical for the optimal management of diarrhea. A 
subject’s baseline bowel patterns shou ld be established so that changes in patterns can 
be identified while sub ject is on treatment. 
 
It is strongly recommended to give sub jects receiving lapatinib-based therapy a 
presc ription of loperamide with instructions to start loperamide at the onset of diarrhea as 
per the recommendations outlined below. 
 
Subjects should be instructed  to first notify their physician/healthcare provider at onset of 
diarrhea of any severity. 
 
An asses sment of frequency, consistency and duration as well as knowledge of other 
symptoms such  as fever, cramping, pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and thirst should be 
taken at baseline. Consequently subjects at high risk of diarrhea can be identified. 
Subjects should be educated on signs and symptoms of diarrhea with instructions to 
report any changes in bowel patterns to the physician. 
 
It is recommended that subjects keep a diary and record the number of diarrhea episodes 
and its ch aracteristics. They should also include information on any dietary changes or 
other o bservations that may be us eful in the evaluation of their diarrhea history. 
 
If subjects present with diarrhea of any Grade, check they are taking lapatinib correctly, 
i.e. single daily dose, rather than splitting it through the day. . Obtain information on food 
(solid and l iquid) and over the co unter (OTC) medication, including herbal supplemen ts, 
taken during the lapatinib treatment period.

Lapatinib hep atotoxicity 
 
Lapatinib can  cause abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), but the incidence is rare. A 
crude incidence of 0.4% has been reported for liver dysfunction (predominantly liver 
enzyme abn ormalities) in over 8700 patients who have received lapatinib in clinical trials 
as of December 2007.  Recently, there is a report of a small number of liver toxicity-related 
deaths, p ossibly due to lapatinib.  These patients were being treated for metastatic breast 
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER 
IRB#:13-002 A (7) 
Approved: 28 Mar 2017 
Page  31 of 69  
 and other cancers, including some cases with liver cancer, so it was difficult to determine 
what role lapatinib may have played. 
 
Due to the rare liver toxicity-related deaths in the metastatic population, the following 
suggestions are recommended: 
 
1)  LFTs (SGO T, SGPT, bilirubin) will be ch ecked serially while patients are actively 
taking lapatinib.  LFTs are che cked every 2 weeks during concurrent chemotherapy 
phase (THL) and then every 3-6 weeks after chemotherapy comp letion (HL). 
 
2) Lapatinib dose  modifications are recommended for the following LFT abnormalities: 
 
a)  If SGO T, SGPT, or bilirubin is at  > Grade 3, the patient should “stop” lapatinib 
altogether and not resume it. 
 
b)  If SGO T, SGPT, or bilirubin is at Grade 2, the patient may hold the lapatinib 
until the SGOT, SGPT, or bilirubin is at  < Grade 1. The patient may have up to 
21 days to hold the lapatinib and L FTs may be checked within 3 weeks (or 
sooner at the physician’s discretion). The patient may then resume the lapatinib 
at one dose reduction (from 1000 mg to 750 mg). 
 
i.  If the lapatinib dose is  already at 750 mg when SGOT, SGPT, or 
bilirubin is at  > Grade 2, the patient may hold the lapatinib until the 
SGOT, SGPT, or bilirubin is at  < Grade 1. The patient may have up to 
21 days to hold the lapatinib and L FTs may be checked within 3 weeks 
(or sooner at the physician’s discretion). The patient may then resume 
the lapatinib at the same dose of 750 mg. If a Grade 2 event occurs 
again, then patient must “stop” lapatinib altogether and “not” resume it. 
 
c)  If SGO T, SGPT, or bilirubin is at < Grade 1, the patient may continue lapatinib 
at the same dose. 
 
 
 
Note:  During the concurrent chemotherapy, trastuzumab,  and lapatinib phase 
(THL) when LFTs are checked every 2 weeks, paclitaxel can be  given at full dose 
without delay if the SGOT/SG PT are at < Grade 2, and bilirubin is at  < grade 1. If 
the SGOT/SG PT are at > Grade 3 or bilirubin is at > Grade 2, LFTS should be 
checked weekly and pac litaxel can be h eld until the SGOT/SGPT have recovered 
to < Grade 2 and  bilirubin < Grade 1.  The patient can have up to 3 weeks (21 
days) for this recovery. If not, then the patient will come  off study treatment.

 • Patients should be educated about medications that are prohibited (ie: CYP3A4 inducers 
or inhibitors) while on lapatinib (Appendix E). 
 
• Assessme nt of left ventricular ejection fraction by  echocardiogram (with strain when 
possible) will be p erformed at  baseline and at months 2, 6, 9, 12 and  18 (+/- 4 weeks). 
 
• Assessme nt of EKG will be required at baseline and months 2, 6, 9, 12 and 18 (+/- 4 
weeks). 
 
If QTc prolongation is noted as Grade 3 or grea ter (> 500 ms) at any time on EKG 
monitoring, lapatinib should be held and  a repeat EKG should be done within 4 weeks.  If 
the repeat EKG shows that the QTc is < or equal to 500 ms, then lapatinib can be  given 
with one dose  reduction (from 1000 mg to 750 mg daily).  If the repeat EKG still shows 
that the QTc as  Grade 3 or greater (>500  ms), then lapatinib is still held and pa tient should 
be removed from study. If the patient is already taking lapatinib at a lower dose of 750 mg 
daily (for any reason) and the QTc is prolonged at Grade 3 or grea ter (> 500 ms), lapatinib 
should then be held and  the patient from study.  The patient will then be treated as 
deemed  appropriately by the treating physician. Serial potassium and magnesium levels 
should be followed (and corrected if low) while the patient is on lapatinib (Appendix F). 
 
• Evidence of  disease evaluation by  CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, PET scan,

blood will be co llected  pre- and post-infusion in a green top (heparin) tube for the 
measurement of TnI. For the troponin assa y, plasma will be se parated from peripheral b lood 
and samples will be frozen for analysis and will not be known to the investigator until the 
patient has completed the study. The TnI samples will be e valuated by  Dr. Martin Fleisher’s 
laboratory at MSKCC .   At all MSKCC sites, blood samples should be clearly labeled before 
transfer to Main campus. This labeling sh ould include the study identifier (IRB-assigned

From e ach patient at e very 2 weeks during THL phase (pre- and post- infusion of paclitaxel, 
trastuzumab) and  during months 6, 9, and 18 (7 time-points in total) , five mL of peripheral 
blood will be co llected  pre- and post-infusion into a lavender top (EDTA) tube for 
measurement of BNP.  The BNP ass ay will be p erformed within 24 hours of blood collection. 
The BNP samp les will be e valuated by  Dr. Martin Fleisher’s laboratory at MSKCC .  BNP 
specimens can be  refrigerated following collection. Samples from MSKCC Regional Network 
sites will be d elivered to the MSKCC Main Campus at least once da ily per usual Regional 
practice  for preparation and frozen storage. At all MSKCC sites, blood samples shou ld be 
clearly labeled before transfer to Main campus. This labeling should include the study 
identifier (IRB-assigned protocol number), MSKCC-assigned patient identifier (once available), 
test (“BNP”) and the time point of samp le measuremen t. 
 
BNP is assayed in the Clinical Chemistry STAT lab. The BNP ass ay is performed on a Biosite 
Triage analyzer (Biosite, San Diego, California) using fluorescence immunoassay on EDTA 
anticoagulated whole blood.  Average within day  imprecision is 8.5% at 71 pg/ml and 11% at 
630 pg/ml.  BNP results less than or equal to 100 pg/ml are representative of normal values 
in patients without CHF. BNP will be c lassified as  ≤100 pg/mL (“within normal range”) or >100 
pg/mL (“above normal range”). In add ition to categorizing BNP values in this way, the absolute 
change (represented by the difference between the base line value and the maximum value 
observed during follow-up) will be ca lculated for each pa tient. 
 
Neuregulin 1ß 
 
From e ach patient at e very 2 weeks during THL phase (pre- and post- infusion of paclitaxel, 
trastuzumab) and  during months 6, 9, and 18 (7 time-points in total) , five mL of peripheral 
blood will be co llected  pre- and post-infusion in a lavender top (EDTA) tube for the 
measurement NRG -1ß. For the NRG -1ß assay, plasma  will be se parated from peripheral 
blood and s amples will be frozen for analysis and will not be known to the investigator u ntil the 
patient has completed the study.  A reproducible assay  for assessing serum NRG-1ß levels 
using an indirect sandwich ELISA  technique has been developed and validated in the Sawyer 
Lab at Vanderbilt University.  The monoclonal capture antibody used in this assay is against a 
biologically active and ca rdiac-specific peptide sequence, which has  been studied extensively 
by Sawyer et al. This peptide has  been sh own to play an important role in the activation of the 
ErbB receptor and downstream signaling pathways in ventricular myocytes. The coefficient of 
variation (CV) of this assay is 5.6-13%. 
 
The first generation form of this assay was used in a p ilot study performed by Dr. Sawyer’s 
group which sou ght to define the effects of exercise on  circulating NRG-1ß levels in humans 
94. This study demonstrated that there was no  significant difference  in serum NRG-1ß levels 
pre- and post- exercise in hea lthy human subjects, but these levels were associated with 
cardiopulmonary exercise ca pacity. 
 
A sec ond generation ELISA ass ay with lower detection limits has since b een developed with 
NRG-1ß being detected in >98% samples tested  to date. This assay was used to quantitate 
NRG-1ß from ser um samples in 8 99 subjects with chron ic heart failure. 82 NRG-1ß levels were 
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER 
IRB#:13-002 A (7) 
Approved: 28 Mar 2017 
Page  35 of 69  
 detected  in all non-heart failure samples and  all but 12 heart failure patients.  Extensive 
validation of the second generation form of this assay has been performed. The effects of 
multiple freeze/thaw cycles and the differences between plasma  and serum NRG-1ß levels 
have also been ass essed.  NRG-1ß is detectable in b oth serum and plasma with a strong 
correlation (R2=0.91), with plasma  levels being 50% higher than serum.  Repeated measures 
of NRG -1ß levels after exposure to multiple freeze/thaw cycles are highly correlated 
(R2=0.92), but decrease 25.7% per freeze/thaw cycle.  Because of these findings, we will use 
frozen, previously unthawed plasma  for our study. 
 
A third generation form of this assay has also been developed and validated at  the University 
of Pennsylvania Translational Core Lab led by  Theodore Mifflin, PhD and Stephen Master, 
MD, PhD under Dr. Ky’s direction and Dr. Sawyer’s collaboration. This assay has lower 
detection limits and an improved co efficient of variation 
Neuregulin-1 Assay:  Plasma  will be collected,  banked, and stored at -80oC at various time- 
points immediately prior to and after specific cycles se rially during the course of chemotherapy 
as ou tlined abo ve. We will measure NRG-1 from previously unthawed plasma  samples 
using a reproducible, established 2nd generation ELISA for assessing NRG-1 (CV 5.6-13%) 
(82). This monoclonal capture antibody targets a biologically-active peptide that is relevant to 
the cardiac system and able to induce ErbB receptor activity.  Importantly, as new  candidate 
biomarkers arise, we will also test these using robust assays.  
 
As of A(6), we will no longer be measuring NRG-1from previously unthawed plasma 
samp les us ing ELIS A, given the sc arce incidences of cardiac dysfunction based on  the LVEF 
data. 
 
Note:  As the clinical significance of an elevated TnI, BNP, or NRG-1ß in an as ymptomatic 
patient is unknown, the TnI and NRG-1ß samples drawn at various time intervals as des cribed 
previously for each patient will be a nalyzed but the results will be b linded to the treating 
physician until the end of the study, “not in real time”.  Patients and their treating physicians 
will not have the results in real time and thus, treatment decisions will not be affected. The 
BNP ass ay will be p erformed within 24 hours of sample collection, but the results will not be 
released to the treating oncologist until the end of the study, as the significance of an elevated 
BNP in an asymptomatic patient is not known. The results will instead be  stored for 
interpretation at the end of the study. 
 
Note: The TnI and BNP samp les will be co llected  at the BAIC and will be p icked up by  the 
courier and delivered to Dr. Fleisher’s lab, as per standard MSKCC’s standard practice. The 
NRG-1ß samples will be frozen and stored at the BAIC. and will be se nt to Dr. Bonnie Ky at 
the end of the study for the exploratory analysis. 
  
As of A(6), NRG-1samples will no longer be sent to Dr. Bonnie Ky’s laboratory for 
exploratory analysis. They will be d iscarde d. 
 
 
Pharmacogenomics Determinants of Toxicity to Therapy 
 
Hepatic o xidative drug metabo lism is carried out by the cytochrome (CYP) P450 system. 
Sequencing of the genome has  revealed 58 d ifferent human CYP genes.  Polymorphisms in CYP 
genes may contribute to either diminished or absent metabo lism, or excessive metabo lism of a 
compou nd. Within the CYP system, e nzyme families CYP 1, CYP2, and CYP3 are responsible for

 the metabo lism of paclitaxel and lapatinib.  Specifically, CYP2C8, CYP3A5, CYP3A4, and 
CYP2C19 have been sh own to be involved in metabo lism of both drugs.  Inherited  variations in 
drug transport proteins are also of interest when considering pharmacogenetics.  Members  of the 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cass ette (ABC) family of membrane transporters modulate 
drug action at  the ce llular level.  Genes relevant to lapatinib and pac litaxel metabolism include 
ABCB 1, ABCG2, CYP2C8*2, CYP2C19*2, CYP3A5*3, CYP3A4*1B a nd can be identified using 
SNP ass ay analysis. 
 
These samples will be co llected  at the BAIC and frozen until they are analyzed at  the end of the 
study for each patient.  Samples will be a nalyzed by Sequenom MassArray in the Sequenom 
Core (Diagnostic Molecular Pathology). Assay design, sample plating and prepar ation will be 
performed in the Clinical Genetics Service laboratory under the direction of Vijai Jos eph, Ph.D. 
Quality control will be a ssessed by inclusion of random duplicates and blanks, per standard 
protocol. In the unlikely event that a SNP cannot be included in the assay design, we will either 
perform a TaqMan assay for that particular SNP or use a more tractable SNP in LD (r2 = 1) with 
the SNP of interest. Genotype ca lls will be made by V. Joseph and M. Robson by inspection of 
the Sequenom output. For ABCB 1, the results of genotyping of rs1045642, rs1128503, and 
rs2032582 will be us ed to cons truct haplotypes, and it will be the haplotypes that will be us ed in 
the analysis rather than the individual genotypes 
 
Echocardiogr ams (and Strain Imaging Analysis for research purp oses): 
 
Echocardiograms will be p erformed at months 2, 6, 9, 12 and 18 of treatment as defined in the 
study.  Strain imaging will be a nalyzed of f-line us ing 2D image loops from the routine 
echocardiographic examination. The ECHO machine for the strain imaging ana lysis should be 
the Vivid 7 or E9 machine (GE healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). In add ition to being stored in the main 
ECHO PACS system, these s tudies will also be  stored in an external GE workstation which 
contains the software needed to perform the strain imaging analysis. To calculate strain and strain 
rate, the LV  myocardium is traced in a click-to-point approach.  Subsequently, the software 
automatically defines an epicardial and midmyocardial line and processes all frames of the loop. 
The myocardium in each  of the 3 standard apical views is divided into 6 segmen ts.  The software 
will automatically calculate strain and  strain rate for each of the 18 segments plus a global value 
for the entire myocardium. These measurements will be made by a des ignated investigator (Dr. 
Jennifer Liu) blinded to patient identification, demographics and clinical ch aracteristics at the end 
of the study. When possible any  ECHOs done outside of MSKCC are  requested  to be done on 
the GE Vivid 7 or E9 machine (GE healthcare, Milwaukee, WI),  and the disc to be sent to Dr. 
Jennifer Liu for the strain imaging analysis.

 6.   Correlative cardiac blood-work will consist of TnI, BNP, and NRG-1ß. These will be done pre- 
and post-infusion on day 1 of every THL cycle (4 times, every 2 weeks) and at months 6, 9 and 
18 (7 time-points in total). 
 
7.   Blood for genetic analysis will be done prior to receipt of cycle # 1 paclitaxel (but can be done 
at any time during study if not done at baseline). 
 
8.   A lapatinib pill diary will be collected every 4 weeks during THL phase and every 3-6 weeks 
during HL phase of the study. 
 
9.   Evidence of disease (EOD)  evaluation should be considered (CT of  chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
and bone scan) if clinically indicated by the patient’s symptomatology or by abnormal laboratory 
values, at the physician’s discretion. 
 
11.0 TOXICITIE S/SIDE EFFECTS  
 
Assessme nt of Adverse Events: 
 
Investigators will assess the occ urrence of AEs at all patient evaluation time points during 
the study. All AEs whether volunteered by  the patient, discovered by study personnel 
during questioning, or detected  through physical examination, laboratory test, or other 
means will be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the appropriate AE CRD B 
page. Each recorded AE will be d escribed by its duration (i.e., start and end dates), 
severity and  suspected  relationship to the investigational produ ct. Since this trial’s primary 
outcome  is to measure safety and feasibility of the intervention by  assessing toxicity, 
suspected  relationships or attributions of non-hematological adverse events will only be 
collected  if assess ed as grades ≥ 2 except for the following events: rash and diarrhea. 
Additionally, laboratory toxicities will be co llected  for assessment if the results are 
considered grades  ≥ 2. AE grad ing (severity) scale found in the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.0 
will be us ed for AE reporting. 
 
 
 
Trastuzumab  (Herceptin®) 
 
Infusion-Associated Symptoms. During the first infusion with Herceptin, a symptom 
comp lex consisting of chills and/or fever is observed in appro ximately 40% of patients. 
Other signs and/or symptoms may include naus ea, vomiting, pain, rigors, headache, 
cough, dizziness, rash, and ast henia. These symptoms are usually mild to moderate in 
severity, and occ ur infrequently with subs equent Hercep tin infusions. These symptoms 
can be  treated with an analgesic/antipyretic such  as meperidine or paracetamol, or an 
antihistamine such as  diphenhydramine. 
 
Serious Infusion-Associated Events. Serious adverse reactions to Herceptin infusion 
including dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen 
saturation and respiratory distress ha ve been  reported infrequently.   In rare cases (4 per 
10,000), these events were associated with a clinical co urse culminating in a fatal 
outcome. Serious reactions ha ve been  treated with supp ortive therapy such as oxygen, 
beta-agonists, corticosteroids and withdrawal of Hercep tin as indicated.  
 
Hematologic Toxicity.  In the clinical trials, an increased incidence of anemia was observed 
in patients receiving Herceptin plus chemotherapy comp ared with patients receiving 
chemotherapy alone.  The majority of these a nemia events were mild or moderate in 
intensity and reversible; none resulted in discontinuation of Hercep tin therapy. In the 
clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of moderate to severe neutropenia and of 
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER

 febrile neu tropenia were higher in patients receiving Herceptin in c ombination with 
myelosuppressive che motherapy as comp ared to those who received ch emotherapy 
alone.  In the post marketing se tting, deaths due to seps is in patients with severe 
neutropenia have been  reported in patients receiving Hercep tin and myelosuppressive 
chemotherapy, although in con trolled clinical trials (pre- and post-marketing), the 
incidence of septic deaths was not  significantly increase d. The pathophysiologic basis for 
exacerbation of neutropenia has  not been determined; the effect of Herceptin on the 
pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutic agents has not been fully evaluated. The observed 
incidence of leukemia among Herceptin-treated patients appears to be consistent with the 
expected incidence of leukemia among patients treated with che motherapy for metastatic 
breast ca ncer. Therefore, the co ntribution of Herceptin to the etiology of acute leukemia 
or myelodysplastic s yndrome in these cases is unclear. 
 
 
 
 
Paclitaxel (Taxol®) 
 
Side-effects include alopecia, myelosuppression, fatigue, neuropathy, arthralgia, myalgia, 
onycholysis, taste changes, amenorrhea, teratogenesis, hypersensitivity (hypotension, 
flushing, chest pain, abdominal or extremity  pain, skin reactions, pruritus, dyspnea, 
bronch ospasm, and tachycardia), fever, sinus bradycardia, comp lete heart block, sinus 
tachycardia, premature ventricular beats, ventricular tachycardia, bigeminy, syncope, 
myocardial infarction, hypotension, hypertension, dizziness, visual changes, headaches, 
radiation recall, nausea and vomiting, mouth sores, abdominal pain, diarrhea, typhlitis, 
ischemic colitis, abnormal liver function, pancreatitis, abnormal triglyceride, and seizures. 
 
Lapatinib 
 
The most common toxic effects of lapatinib are: 
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, rash, anorexia, and fatigue. 
Information on Hepatotoxicity 
 
Lapatinib can  cause abnormal liver functions (LFTs), pred ominantly transaminase 
elevations, but the incidence is rare.  A crude incidence of 0.4% of hepatotoxicity has been 
reported for liver dysfunction in over 8700 patients who have received lapatinib in c linical 
trials as of December 2007.  Recently, there is a report of a small number of liver toxicity- 
related deaths, possibly due to lapatinib. These patients were being treated for metastatic 
breast a nd other cancers, including some cas es with liver cancer, so it was difficult to 
determine what role lapatinib may have played. 
 
Information on  pregn ancy 
 
As of 28 February 2006 there have been  three pregnancy reports within the lapatinib 
clinical pro gram.  Study EGF10004 su bject 402 was found to be pregnant at an unknown 
time after the first dose of lapatinib. The subject gave birth to a normal female baby  at 36 
weeks gestation by  caesarean se ction.  Study EGF20002 su bject 2655 was found to be 
pregnant at an unknown time after receiving lapatinib and zoledronic acid. Treatment with 
lapatinib was discontinued. The patient experienced a spo ntaneous/missed abo rtion at  9 
weeks gestational age which was reported as related to lapatinib by the investigator. 
Another subject in study EGF100642 subject 101 became  pregnant in the first month 
following her last dose of lapatinib.  She later underwent an elective abo rtion due to 
progression of her underlying cancer.

Cardiac and  pulmonary toxicity 
 
Potential risks for the lapatinib program include cardiac toxicity and pulmonary toxicity 
which are known risks associated with other ErbB1 or ErbB2 inhibitors. Cardiac and 
pulmonary events are monitored closely in all lapatinib clinical trials and reviewed regularly 
by GSK.  An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) comp rising oncologists, a 
cardiologist and a pulmonologist meet quarterly to assess  the benefit-risk ratio in ongoing 
trials. Cardiac safety and interstitial pneumonitis are reviewed as pa rt of this responsibility. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Decreased L eft Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) 
 
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) has been evaluated us ing MUGA sca ns or 
echocardiogram during lapatinib phase  I, II and III trials.  As of 28 February 2006 a total of 
60 su bjects on the lapatinib program have experienced 62 e vents of decreased L VEF, 
giving an approximate incidence for this event of 1.5%  for the program as a whole. Of 
these 62  events, 57 e vents (55 su bjects) met the protocol specific serious definition 
included in lapatinib phase II and III protocols: 
 
NCI CTC Grade 3 or 4 left ventricular systolic dysfunction (NCI CTC version 4.0) or LVEF 
decrease  ≥20% relative to base line value  and below the institutions lower limit of normal. 
Age range for subjects experiencing decreased L VEF was 31  to 81 years, with a median 
of 59 years.  Seventy three percent of the reports were for female subjects, which may be 
attributed to the fact that the majority of large studies in the lapatinib program are for 
breast cancer.  Sixty percent of the decreased LVEF events occurred within nine weeks of 
treatment onset. In 37 subjects, (62%) the event resolved or  improved. 
 
Forty two of the 55 subjects whose LV EF decrease met the protocol sp ecific serious 
definition are  known to have received lapatinib, giving an incidence of 1.3%.  For the 
remaining 13  subjects: 5 remain blinded, 4 occurred on p lacebo, and 4 subjects received 
compar ator (capecitabine or medroxy-progesterone) only. 
 
Of the 42 subjects on lapatinib, 33 LVEF decreases were assessed  as related to 
investigational produ ct by the investigator. Twenty three subjects (55%) were participating 
in monotherapy studies.   Of the 42 lapatinib sub jects, 29  experienced as ymptomatic 
LVEF decreases  which were comp licated  by pre-existing conditions and/or 
previous/concurrent medications.  Examples included: previous episodes of decreased 
LVEF, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, left-chest radiation, and exposure to 
anthracyclines, trastuzumab, or  paclitaxel, all of which ha ve been ass ociated with cardiac 
adverse events. 
 
A further nine lapatinib subjects experienced L VEF decreas es which resolved or  improved 
on discontinuation of lapatinib.  Eight subjects received lapatinib monotherapy, one 
subject received lapatinib in c ombination with capecitabine. Three of the eight 
monotherapy cases were symptomatic. The symptoms observed were dyspnea and  
cardiac failure, which resolved on d iscontinuation of lapatinib. The remaining five 
monotherapy cases and one combination therapy report were asymptomatic.  All nine of 
these cases were complicated  by pre-existing co nditions and/or previous/concurrent 
medications which may have con tributed to the observed LVEF decre ase and make 
assessment of the event comp lex.

IRB#:13-002 A (7) 
Approved: 28 Mar 2017 
Page  41 of 69  
  
The remaining four subjects had no contributing factors, three subjects were receiving 
lapatinib monotherapy, and one subject received comb ination therapy with cisplatin. Two 
of the su bjects died due to disease progression whilst an as ymptomatic LVEF decrease 
was on going.  In one case lapatinib was discontinued, the second subject had remained 
on lapatinib. The third subject experienced a  symptomatic (palpitations) LVEF decreas e. 
Lapatinib was interrupted and  the event was ongoing at the time of reporting. The su bject 
who received comb ination therapy experienced an as ymptomatic decrease in L VEF three 
weeks after completing treatment with lapatinib. The event resolved. 
 
Many of the subjects in the lapatinib trials had previously received treatment with either 
anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab, b oth of which ha ve been ass ociated with 
cardiotoxicity.  In addition some ongoing studies comb ine lapatinib with paclitaxel or 
capecitabine, both of which are associated with cardiotoxicity.  This therefore increases 
the risk of cardiotoxicity in the lapatinib patients irrespective of any cardiac toxicity 
attributed to lapatinib.  Decreased ejection fraction has been included in the DCSI for 
lapatinib. 
 
QT prolongation 
 
QT prolongation measured by  an EKG was obse rved in unco ntrolled, open-label dose 
escalation study of lapatinib in p atients with advanced ca ncer (81).  In this study 81 
patients received lapatinib at d oses ranging from 175 to 1800 mg daily.  Serial EKGs were 
collected  on days 1 and 14 to evaluate the effect of lapatinib on QT intervals.  Thirteen of 
81 patients were found to have either QTcF (corrected  by the Friedericia method) of > 480 
msec or an increase in QTcF by > 60 msec by  an automated machine-read evaluation of 
the EKG. Thus, there may be a relationship between lapatinib conce ntration and QTc 
interval.  Lapatinib shou ld be administered with cau tion in those at risk for QTc 
prolongation. These patients include those with hypokalemia, with hypomagnesemia, with 
congenital long QT syndrome, taking anti-arrhythmic drugs or medications that lead to QT 
prolongation (Appendix E), and who had a high cumulative anthracycline exposure.  Thus, 
hypokalemia a nd hypomagnesemia shou ld be corrected prior to administering lapatinib. 
Baseline and on-treatment EKG monitoring with QT measurement and monitoring of 
potassium and magnesium should be done on patients who are  receiving lapatinib. 
 
Interstitial Pneumonitis 
 
Current phase II and III lapatinib protocols include spec ific requirements for reporting of 
signs or symptoms of pneumonitis:  subjects who have pulmonary symptoms which are 
NCI CTC version 3.0 Grade 3 or grea ter will be removed from study and the events 
documented as an SAE. As of 28 February 2006, 9 pu lmonary events have been 
reported:  5 subjects experienced interstitial lung disease, 4 subjects experienced 
pneumonitis. Given cur rent enrolment of 4084 subjects in the lapatinib program, this gives 
an approximate incidence of 0.2% for ‘pneumonitis type’ events.  Seven of these events 
were reported as related to investigational produ ct.  Six subjects were participating in 
comb ination studies and  one of these subjects did not receive lapatinib. The remaining 
three reports were from lapatinib monotherapy studies. 
 
Age range for subjects experiencing signs or symptoms of pneumonitis was 48  to 73 
years, with a median of 66 years. The majority of the reports (6/9) were for female 
subjects which may be attributed to the fact that there are a large number of breast cancer 
subjects in the lapatinib program.  Five sub jects (55%) who experienced p ulmonary events 
recovered.  Three of these 5 subjects required treatment, commonly methylpredn isolone 
or prednisolone.  For the remaining four subjects: two events were fatal, one event was 
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER

 ongoing at the time of the sub ject’s death due to disease progress ion, and one e vent was 
ongoing at the time of reporting.  Both subjects who died were participating in 
monotherapy studies. The first subject died due to interstitial lung disease which the 
investigator a ttributed to disease progress ion. The second  subject developed interstitial 
lung disease and died approximately seven months after the last dose of lapatinib.  The 
subject had recently completed radiotherapy and the investigator felt that lapatinib may 
have affected the su bject’s tolerance  to radiotherapy. 
 
In add ition to the reports received from the lapatinib program, a report of interstitial 
pulmonary infiltrates was received for a subject participating in study VEG10006 (lapatinib 
and pazopanib). The final diagnosis for this event was bilateral pneumonia, which was 
reported as  unrelated to the investigational prod ucts.  Reports of signs/symptoms of 
pneumonitis are closely monitored and current data do not support the addition of this 
term to DCSI for lapatinib. 
 
Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) 
 
The most common adverse event attributed to pegfilgrastim in clinical trials was medullary 
bone pain, reported in 26% of subjects, which was comp arable to the incidence in 
Filgrastim-treated patients. This bone pain was gen erally reported to be of mild-to- 
moderate severity.  Approximately 12% of all subjects utilized non-narcotic analgesics and 
less than 6% utilized narcotic ana lgesics  in association with bone p ain.  No patients 
withdrew from the study due to bone pain. Reversible elevations in L DH, alkaline 
phosphatase and uric acid have been o bserved in clinical trials.  Pegfilgrastim has been 
associated with leukocytosis (defined as WBC > 100 x 109/L) in < 1% of 465 su bjects with 
non-myeloid malignancies, when obser ved it was not  associated with any  adverse event. 
 
The maximum amount of pegfilgrastim that can  be safely administered in single or multiple 
doses has  not been determined.  Single doses  of 300 mcg/kg ha ve been administered SC 
to 8 normal volunteers and 3 p atients with non-small cell lung cancer  without serious 
adverse effects. These subjects experienced a  mean maximum ANC of 55 x 109/L, with a 
corresponding mean maximum WBC of 67 x 109/L. The absolute maximum ANC 
observed was 96  x 109/L with a corresponding absolute maximum WBC observed of 120 x 
109/L. The duration of leukocytosis ranged from 6 to 13 days.  Leukapheresis should be 
considered in the management of symptomatic individuals. 
 
Pegfilgrastim is contraindicated  in patients with kno wn hypersensitivity to E coli-derived 
proteins, pegfilgrastim, Filgrastim, or any other component of the product. 
 
Rare cases of splenic rupture have been reported with peg filgrastim in the pos t-marketing 
setting.  Similar events have been reported following the administration of the parent 
compou nd of pegfilgrastim, Filgrastim, for PBPC mobilization in b oth hea lthy donors and 
patients with canc er.  Some of these cases with Filgrastim were fatal.  Pegfilgrastim has 
not been evaluated in this setting, therefore, pegfilgrastim should not be used for PBPC 
mobilization.  Patients receiving pegfilgrastim  who report left upper abdominal or shoulder 
tip pain shou ld be evaluated for an enlarged sp leen or sp lenic rupture. 
 
Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS ) has been reported in neu tropenic patients with 
seps is receiving filgrastim, the parent compound of pegfilgrastim, and is postulated to be 
secondary to an influx of neutrophils to sites of inflammation in the lungs.  Neutropenic 
patients receiving pegfilgrastim who develop fever, lung infiltrates, or respiratory distress 
should be evaluated for the possibility of ARDS .  In the event that ARDS occ urs, 
pegfilgrastim should be discontinued and/or withheld until resolution of ARDS and patients 
should receive appropri ate medical management for this condition.

Rare cases of allergic-type reactions have been  experienced by  patients receiving 
pegfilgrastim in the post-marketing setting. This is similar to allergic-type reactions, 
including anaphylaxis, skin rash, and urticaria, occurring on initial or subsequent 
treatments that have been reported with the parent compound of pegfilgrastim, filgrastim. 
In some cases, symptoms have recurred with re-challenge with Filgrastim, suggesting a 
causal relationship. If a serious allergic reaction or anaphylactic reaction occurs, 
appropri ate therapy should be administered and further use of pegfilgrastim should be 
discontinued. 
 
Severe sickle cell crisis has been  reported in patients with sickle cell disease (specifically 
homozygous sickle cell anemia, sickle/hemoglobin C d isease, and sickle+ thalassemia) 
who received filgrastim, the parent compound of pegfilgrastim, for PBPC mobilization or 
following chemotherapy. One of these cases was fatal. 
 
Filgrastim (Neupogen®) 
 
Side-effects include chills, fever, nausea, anorexia, myalgia, bone pain, local injection site 
pain or inflammation, elevated liver function, thinning of hair, enlargement of spleen, and 
rarely fluid retention and pericardial effusion. 
 
12.0 CRITERIA FOR THE RAPEUTIC  RESPONS E/OUTCOME  ASSES SMENT 
 
At the time of each re-evaluation, patients will be c lassified in the following manner: 
 
• No evidence of  disease. 
 
• Breast cancer recurrence:  Local/regional breast cancer recurrence is defined as the 
development of tumor (except LCIS) in the ipsilateral brea st (after lumpe ctomy); in the 
soft tissue/chest wall and/or skin of the ipsilateral chest wall; or tumor in the ipsilateral 
internal mammary, su praclavicular, infraclavicular, or axillary nodes or soft tissue of 
ipsilateral axilla.  Suspected tumor recurrence in the ipsilateral bre ast, chest wall 
structures, supraclavicular, or  lower (level I ± II) axillary nodal areas  must be co nfirmed 
by biopsy  or cytology.  Histologic or cytologic confirmation of tumor is recommended for 
internal mammary or infraclavicular/high axillary nodal recurrence.  A distant recurrence 
is defined as development of tumor in areas  other than the local/regional area that is 
documen ted by a pos itive cytology aspirate, biopsy, or imaging studies. 
 
• New prima ry:  A new prima ry is defined as the development of contralateral brea st 
cancer or a second cancer other than squamous or basal cell carci noma of the skin, 
carci noma in situ of the cervix or LCIS of the breast that is histologically confirmed.

• More than one dose reduction of paclitaxel due to toxicities 
 
• More than one d ose reduction of lapatinib 
 
• More than 3 consecutive weeks of holding lapatinib due to toxicities (except when holding 
lapatinib due to an asymptomatic LVEF decline) 
 
• Disease recurrence 
 
• Unacceptable toxicity 
 
• Intercurrent, non-cancer related illness that prevents continuation of protocol therapy or 
follow-up 
 
• Major protocol violation that would render the patient inevaluable for efficacy (ie: the 
initiation of non-protocol antineoplastic therapy or the discovery of information that, if 
known, would have rendered the patient ineligible for the study) 
 
• Repeated non -comp liance by the patient with protocol requirements 
 
• Changes in the patient’s condition or  study drug related toxicity such  that, in the opinion of 
the investigator, continued participation in the protocol would compromise patient well- 
being 
 
• Withdrawal of patient’s consent 
 
• Any signs or symptoms of pneumonitis that are >Grade 3 (NCI CTCAE) (defined as 
radiographic changes and requiring oxygen).  Refer to NCI CTCAE grading of 
pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltrates. 
 
 
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
This is a feasibility trial of a dos e-dense adjuvant chemotherapy regimen that consists of 
paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) q 14 days x 4 with peg filgrastim  + trastuzumab  (4 mg/kg bo lus →  2 mg/kg) 
+ daily lapatinib followed by q 21 day trastuzumab  (6 mg/kg) + daily lapatinib. The primary 
objective of this trial is to determine the feasibility of this regimen in patients with nod e-negative 
HER-2/neu o verexpressed /amplified brea st cancer with a tumor size of < 3 cm. The regimen is 
considered feasible for patients who are  able to complete the paclitaxel, trastuzumab, a nd 
lapatinib (THL) portion of the regimen without a dose d elay or reduction or grade 3 or grea ter QTc 
prolongation.   If the trial stops early for serious cardiac toxicity or excessive grade 3 
gastrointestinal toxicity, the regimen will be d eemed  not feasible. The allowable incidence of 
cardiac events (CHF, cardiac death) is set to be < 4% a nd the acceptable incidence of grade 3 
gastrointestinal toxicity is set at 20%.  A cardiac event (CE) is defined as 1) cardiac de ath or 2) 
symptomatic congestive heart  failure (CHF) defined as d yspnea with normal acti vity or at rest and 
“absolute” d ecline in LVEF by >  10% to < 50 %. A cardiac event will result in discontinuation of 
trastuzumab  and lapatinib. 
 
We will accrue  55 patients for this study. Based on the accrual  rate from prior studies, accrual is 
expected to take 12 months.  Any patient who receives treatment on study, regardless of the 
ability to complete treatment, is evaluable. Any patient who is removed from the study for any 
reason prior to the 12 month mark will be c lassified as n ot being able to complete the regimen.

Greater than 85% of the patients on standard adjuvant trials complete the intend ed study 
regimens without a dos e-delay or reduction.  As the incidence of QT prolongation was reported in 
13/81 (16%) in a group of patients followed with serial EKG monitoring, we anticipate that the 
incidence of QT prolongation on  this study to be < 20%.  Thus, for this study, we would like to be 
able to discriminate between feasibility rates of 65% (unpromising) and 80% (promising). If a 
patient has more than one dose de lay or dose reduction for any reason, these e vents are 
collectively counted as one entity in the same patient. With 55 patients, this design discriminates 
between true comp letion rates of ≤ 65% and ≥ 80% at a Type I error of 5% and a Type II error of 
20%.  A feasibility rate of ≤ 65% will indicate that this regimen is not feasible and  not worthy for 
further investigation. The paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and lapatinib (THL) portion of the regimen will 
be considered feasible and warrant further clinical study if 42 or more patients are able to 
comp lete this portion of the regimen without a dose de lay or reduction. 
 
We have incorporated two early stopping rules. First, the study design includes ea rly termination 
in the event of excessive grade 3 diarrhea. The allowable grade 3 d iarrhea rate is set at 20% and 
the unacceptable rate is set at 40%. The boundaries are based on a maximum accrual of 55 
patients. The below table provides the stopping boundary based on repeated significance testing: 
 
First 10 patients stop if 5 grade 3 GI toxicities are observed 
 
20 patients stop if 8 grade 3 GI toxicities are observed 
 
30 patients stop if 10 grade 3 GI toxicities are observed 
 
40 patients stop if 13 grade 3 GI toxicities are observed 
 
50 patients stop if 15 grade 3 GI toxicities are observed 
 
55 patients stop if 17 grade 3 GI toxicities are observed 
 
 
 
If the true toxicity rate is 20%, the proba bility the study will be s topped is 12%, while if the true 
toxicity rate is 40%, the probability the study will be stopped is 97%. The study will not be halted 
after each set of 10 patients is accrue d. 
 
For the sec ond stopping rule, the study design includes an  early stopping rule to account for the 
possibility of cardiac events. The allowable incidence of cardiac events (CHF, cardiac death) is 
set to < 4%, to be consistent with the reported adjuvant trastuzumab  trials (19-21).  Since the 
clinical significance of asymptomatic LVEF dec line is u nknown, patients will be followed long- 
term. The study will be s topped if there are 3 cardiac events that occur at any time as one of the 
following two scen arios: 1) if there is 1 cardiac death and 2 symptomatic CHF events 2) if there 
are 3 symptomatic CHF events.  The probability of stopping the trial is 38% if the true cardiac 
event rate is 4% and 83% if the true cardiac event rate is 8%.In add ition, if there are any cardiac 
deaths at any time, the trial will be terminated. 
 
Patients from the terminated trial will receive care acco rding to the discretion of their treating 
physicians. 
 
Upon completion of the study, the rate of patients who comp lete the paclitaxel, trastuzumab, a nd 
lapatinib portion of the regimen without a dose de lay or reduction will be estima ted via the 
observed comp letion rate and an  exact confidence interval will be co nstructed.

 Selected  non-hematologic and hematologic toxicities will be d escribed by frequency and grade, 
by cycle and o ver all cycles, with the maximum grade over all cycles used  as the summary 
measure per patient. 
 
There are several sec ondary analyses p lanned.  Serial blood measurements of cardiac markers 
(cTnI, and BNP) will be e xamined. We will also assess  the LVEF at baseline at months 2, 6, 9, 12 
and 18 with an ECHO . When an ECHO cannot be done, a multi-gated acquisition scan  (MUGA) 
may be done. EKG will also be  done at months 2,  6, 9, 12 and 18.To assess c ardiac safety of 
this regimen, analysis of the cardiac biomarkers and ch anges seen on echocardiogram/EKG will 
be co rrelated.  In a des criptive, graph ical analysis, changes in cardiac biomarkers will be 
examined in patients who develop card iac toxicity and compared to cha nges seen in patients who 
did not  develop a c ardiac toxicity. We will also explore the use of single-nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) genotyping in evaluation of pharmacogenetic determinates of gastrointestinal toxicity. 
 
All toxicities following chemotherapy will be gra ded us ing the National Cancer Institute – Common 
Toxicity Criteria version 4.0. We will use logistic regression models to estimate the odds ratio and  
95% confidence intervals for the association of each SNP with the incidence of grade 3 or higher 
diarrhea. The major endpoint in this clinical pharmacogenomics study is to determine the 
association between variant genotypes and toxicity.

During the registration process registering individuals will be required to complete a 
protocol specific Eligibility Checklist. 
 
All participants must be registered through the Protocol Participant Registration (PPR) 
Office at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. PPR is available Monday through 
Friday from 8:30am – 5:30pm at 646-735-8000. Registrations must be submitted via the 
PPR Electronic Registration System (http://ppr/). The comp leted signature page of the 
written co nsent/RA or verbal sc ript/RA, a comp leted Eligibility Checklist and other relevant 
documen ts must be uploaded via the PPR Electronic Registration System. 
 
16.0 DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUE S 
 
A Research Study Assistant (RSA) will be ass igned to the study. The responsibilities of 
the RSA include project comp liance, data collection, abstraction and entry, data reporting, 
regulatory monitoring, problem resolution and prioritization, and coordinate the activities of 
the protocol  study team. 
 
The Clinical Research Database  (CRDB ) will be us ed for data collection. The data will be 
reported to the institution (IRB) and the sponsor (Roche) as appropriate. 
 
It is estimated that 5-7 patients will be accrued  per month and it will take 12 months to 
accrue.

 Participating sites that are consu lting and/or conducting spec imen or data analysis should 
submit this protocol to their IRB accord ing to local guidelines. Copies of any site IRB 
correspondence shou ld be forwarded to MSKCC. 
 
16.1 Quality Assurance 
 
Weekly registration reports will be generated to monitor patient accrua ls, protocol 
comp liance, eligibility verification, informed co nsent procedure, data accuracy, and 
comp leteness  of registration data.  Routine data quality reports will be generated to 
assess missing data and  inconsistencies. Accrual rates and extent and accuracy  of 
evaluations and follow-up will be monitored periodically throughout the study period and 
potential problems will be bro ught to the attention of the study team for discussion and 
action. 
 
Random-sample data quality and protocol  comp liance aud its will be co nducted  by the 
study team, at a minimum of  2 times a year,  more frequently if indicated.  
 
16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 
were approved by  the National Cancer Institute in September 2001.  The plans address 
the new policies set  forth by the NCI in the document entitled “Policy of the National 
Cancer Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can  be found at: 
http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/conducting/dsm-guidelines/page1. The DSM Plans at 
MSKCC were estab lished and are monitored by the Office of Clinical Research.  The 
MSKCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plans can be found on the MSKCC Intranet at: 
http://smskps ps9/dept/ocr/OCR%20Website%20Documents/Clinical%20Research%2 0Qu 
ality%20 Assuranc e%20(CRQA)/MSKCC %20Data%20 and%20Safety%20Monitoring%20P  
lan.pdf 
 
There are several d ifferent mechanisms by which clinical trials are monitored for data, 
safety and quality.  There are institutional proce sses in p lace for quality assurance  (e.g., 
protocol monitoring, compliance and da ta verification audits, therapeutic response, and 
staff education on clinical research QA) and dep artmental procedures for quality control, 
plus there are two institutional com mittees that are responsible for monitoring the activities 
of our clinical trials programs.  The committees: Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) for Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) for Phase III clinical trials, report to the Center’s R esearch Council and 
Institutional Review Board. 
 
During the protocol development and review process, each protocol  will be ass essed  for 
its level of risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of protocol  (e.g., NIH 
sponsored, in-house sponsored, industrial sponsored, NCI cooperative group, etc.) will be 
addressed and  the monitoring procedures will be estab lished at the time of protocol 
activation.

 APPENDIX B: MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE HYPERSENS ITIVITY 
 
Severity of Symptoms Treatment Guidelines 
Mild symptoms:  localized cutaneous  
reactions such as mild pruritus, 
flushing, rash · consider  decreasing the rate of infusion  until 
recovery from  symptoms,  stay at bedside  and 
monitor  patient 
 
· then,  complete  taxane infusion  at the initial 
plan ned rate 
Moderate symptoms:  any symptom that 
is not listed above (mild symptoms)  or 
below  (severe symptoms)  such  as 
gene ralized pruritus, flushing, rash, 
dyspnea, hypotension  with systolic BP > 
80 mm Hg · interrupt taxane infusion  
 
· give diphen hydramine 50 mg  IV with or 
without dexamet hasone 10 mg IV; monitor 
patient  until resolution of symptoms 
 
· resume  taxane infusion  after recovery of 
symptoms;  depending on the physician’s 
assessment of the patie nt, taxane  infusion 
should be resumed at a slower rate, then 
increased incrementally to the initial  planned 
rate, (eg. infuse at an  8 hour rate for 5 
minutes, then at a 4-h rate for 5 minutes, and 
then finally,  resume at the 3-h infusion  rate) 
 
· depending  on the intensity of the reaction 
observed, additional oral or IV premedicati on 
with an antihistamine  should also be given for 
the next  cycle of treatment, and the rate of 
infusion  should be decreased initially and 
then increased back to the initial planned rate, 
(eg. infuse at an  8 hour rate for 5 minutes, 
then at a 4-h rate for 5 minutes, and finally, 
administer at the 3-h infusion rate) 
Severe symptoms: any reaction such  as 
bronch ospas m, generalized urticaria, 
systolic BP  80mm Hg, angioe dema · immediate ly discontinue taxane infusion  
 
· give diphen hydramine 50 mg  IV with or 
without dexamet hasone 10 mg IV and/or 
epinephrine as needed; monitor  patient until 
resolution of symptoms 
 
· the same  treatment guidelines outlined  under 
moderate symptoms (i.e. the third and fourth 
bullets) should  be followed.

Rash: Skin rash (usually grade 1-2) has been observed during the first several days of treatment 
with EGFR inhibitors and has been observed to diminish in se verity after 4 weeks of treatment in 
many patients.  In some patients, this rash app eared to be treatable with standard acne therapies, 
including topical and oral antibiotics used to treat acne.  Anecdotal reports of improvement h ave 
occurred with several a gents. In patients with severe rash, treatment may need to be discontinued 
or the dose reduced.  Anecdotal reports of improvement h ave occu rred with any  of the following: 
minocycline, topical tetracycline, topical clindamycin, topical silver sulfadiazine, diphenhydramine, 
oral predn isone (short course). 
 
Diarrhe a: Diarrhea has been se en with lapatinib and with other EGFR inhibitors. In general EGFR 
inhibitor-induced diarrhea has been transient, usually not of sufficient severity to hinder 
administration of the agents, a nd responsive to loperamide. The recommended dose of loperamide 
is 4 mg at first onset, followed by  2 mg q 2–4 hr until diarrhea free for 12 hr. 
 
Lapatinib Diarrhea Management Guidelines: 
 
Uncomplicated  grade 1-2 diarrhea: 
Stop all lactose  containing produ cts; 
Drink 8-10 large glasses of clear liquids a day; 
Eat frequent small meals; 
Grade 2 diarrhea hold cytotoxic chemotherapy; 
Grade 2 diarrhea consider dose reduction of lapatinib (discuss  with medical monitor); 
Administer standard dose of loperamide: 
Initial dose 4mg followed by 2mg every 4 hours or after every unformed stool. 
We suggest continuation of loperamide until diarrhea free for 12 hours. 
 
For grade 3  or 4 diarrhea or grade 1 or 2 with complicating features (severe 
cramping, severe nausea/vomiting, decreased performance status, fever, se psis, 
grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, frank bleeding, dehydration): 
Use intravenous fluids as appropriate, co nsider hospital admission; 
Use prophylactic an tibiotics as needed (example fluoroquinolones), es pecially if 
diarrhea is persistent beyond 24 hours or there is fever or grade 3-4 neutropenia; 
Hold both cytotoxic chemotherapy and lapatinib and discuss with medical monitor. 
 
These broad  general management principles are recommended to proactively try and 
avoid more serious complications by  active management of the diarrhea syndrome. 
Guidelines such as  these shou ld never replace sound clinical judgment. Our 
experience thus far suggests that when lapatinib is used as monotherapy we mostly 
are dealing with uncomp licated  grade 1 or 2 diarrheas. These general management 
principles do  not discuss  comprehensive management of more serious or protracted 
diarrhea syndromes. 
 
Nausea: Routine premedication for nausea is not necessary, but symptomatic pa tients should be 
treated with standard antinausea/antiemetic therapy as necess ary. 
 
If the patient vomits  after taking the tablets, the dose is replaced only if the tablets can actua lly be 
seen and c ounted.

  Statistical  Methods  
Enrollment  
definition  A subject  is considered  enrolled  in the study  following  provision  of informed 
consent  and upon insertion  of the investigational  device  into a guide  
catheter.  
Follow -up 
Schedule  Subjects  will be followed  through  hospital discharge . 
Primary   
Statistical  Plan This is A single -arm observational trial to evaluate the  safety and clinical 
effectiveness through a composite end -point of device procedural success 
and assessment of angiographic efficacy as shown through a clinically 
significant reduction in percent diameter stenosis as determined by an 
independent Core Lab using QCA.  The primary endpoint will be assessed 
using descriptive statistics  on the Intention To Treat patient population .  No 
hypothesis testing will be performed.  The primary endpoint will be reported 
using frequencies, percentages, and two -sided exac t 95% confidence 
interval.  
All s     Secondary endpoints are evaluated in the unselected patient population set 
using descriptive statistics. The secondary endpoints are summarized using 
the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum , and  two-sided 
95% confidence intervals. Frequencies, percentages and two - sided exact 
95% confidence intervals will be reported for binary endpoints as 
appropriate, for clinical endpoints.  
 
Sample  Size A sample  size of two-hundred  (200) subjects  has been  chosen  in order  to 
characterize  the performance  of the  device. All enrolled subjects will be 
analyzed on an intent -to-treat (ITT) basis as well as per protocol criteria.

The Scoreflex NC Scoring PTCA Catheter is a coronary dilatation catheter designed with a 
short rapid -exchange tip distal to the dilation balloon and an external in tegral wire on the 
outside of the balloon, such that the guide wire and the integral wire act as scoring elements 
external to the balloon when the balloon is inflated.  The presence of the external scoring 
elements outside the angioplasty balloon create a focal stress pattern which allows for 
opening of lesions at lower pressures using a concept of Focused Force Angioplasty [FFA].   
 
In the early 1990’s, the FFA concept evolved out of the clinical practice of the “buddy wire” 
technique for enhanced angiopla sty effectiveness by placing guide wires alongside 
angioplasty balloons as they were inflated.  This practice was developed as the use of fixed -
wire angioplasty balloon catheters  was common, therefore a practice was developed of 
placing guide wires across lesions prior to dilation to “protect” the distal vasculature by 
preserving guide wire access in the case of acute vessel closure due to vasospasm or 
dissections post -angioplasty1.Using this technique it was observed that having a guide wire 
across a steno sis when an angioplasty balloon was inflated was useful in dilating calci fied2 
and resistant lesions3 in what has become known as the “buddy wire” technique.  Based upon 
this practice, Solar and Ischinge r4 introduced the concept of FFA with a balloon angio plasty 
system designed specifically with the guide wire and an external wire on the outside of the 
balloon to introduce high focal stresses along the luminal surface of the balloon.  There are 
several cutting and scoring design concepts based upon FFA that  have been introduced to 
the US market, including  devices using a parallel external wire similar to the commercially 
available FX miniRAIL . 
 
2.1. Description of Investigational Device  
The S coreflex NC Scoring PTCA Catheter is a catheter designed for easy guidewire 
exchange and available with balloon diameters in 1.75, 2.0, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75 3.0, 3.5 
and 4.0 mm, in balloon lengths of 10, 15 and 20 mm and a catheter  working length 
of 140cm.   The balloon material is made of minimally compliant Grilamid L25  
mate rial and can be inflated by injecting dilute contrast media solution through the 
trailing hub of the catheter.   The nominal inflation pressure is 12 ATM with a rated 
burst pressure of 20 ATM . The proximal shaft of the catheter is composed of a 
female luer connector bonded to a PTFE coated stainless steel hypotube  and the 
scoring wire is laser welded to the distal end of the stainless steel hypotube . The 
proximal shaft joins with a smooth tran sition to the distal shaft (composed of an 
outer nylon tube with the balloon/tip tube and scoring wire welded at the distal tip). 
The cutting section of the scoring wire is outside of the balloon. Two radiopaque 
platinum/iridium marker bands are located on  the scoring wire and aligned with the 
balloon shoulders to ensure accurate positioning of the balloon. The tip lumen is 
compatible with a standard  0.014 inch (0.36mm) guidewire. The guidewire enters 
the catheter tip and advances coaxially out the Rx port,  thereby allowing both coaxial 
guidance and rapid exchange of catheter with a single standard length guidewire. 
Two marked sections, 5mm in length, are located on the proximal shaft indicating 
the catheter position relative to the tip of either a brachial or femoral guiding catheter.

2.3.1.  Potential Risks  
There is extensive clinical and commercial experience worldwide with 
cardiac catheterization and interventional procedures utilizing non -
compliant and scoring PTCA catheters. I t is expected that the surgical and 
procedural risks w ill not be significantly different with the use of this device 
or in this clinical trial.     
The S coreflex NC Scoring PTCA Catheter has been marketed outside of the 
US since 2016.   An on -going, prospective post -market surveillance program 
continues to show these devices to be safe and effective . 
2.3.2.  Risk Management  
The investigational plan is specifically designed to manage and minimize 
risks through careful subject selection, thorough  training of investigators and 
adherence to the pre -determined time points to assess subject clinical status 
and regular clinical monitoring visits by Sponsor appointed monitoring 
personnel.  
2.3.3.  Potential Benefit  
 
The S coreflex NC Scoring PTCA Catheter  is indicated for balloon dilatation 
of a stenotic portion of a coronary artery stenosis in patients evidencing 
coronary ischemia for the purpose of improving myocardial perfusion , 
including in-stent restenosis . PTCA dilation of complex, highly stenosed or  
heavily calcified lesions with non -compliant scoring balloons to optimize 
lesion preparation prior to stent placement may facilitate procedural success.  
Optimal stent deployment is known to reduce the potential of restenosis, stent 
thrombosis and target lesion revascularization. The safety and performance 
demonstrated for non -compliant PTCA scoring catheters demonstrate that the 
risk-to-benefit ratio is within reason for the foreseeable  risks.   
 
2.4. Statement of Trial Conduct  
This study is intended to be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP)  
guidelines5, local regulatory requirements , and subject ethical treatment must be in 
accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki: Ethical 
Considerations for Medical Research Involvi ng Human Subjects6. 
2.5. Study Population  
The target study population is subjects  with evidence of ischemia and  clinically 
indicated for one - or two -vessel revascularization procedures by percutaneous 
coronary intervention.

2.6.1 FX miniRAIL™ Catheter Clinical Experience  
The FX miniRAIL catheter, a dedicated FFA balloon angioplasty catheter, was 
introduced in 2003 and shown in clinical practice to lower stenosis resolution 
dilation pressures, fewer spiral dissections, less recoil, a larger minimum lumen 
diameter, and a trend toward a lower restenosis rate than that seen with Plain Ol d 
Balloon Angioplasty [POBA]7.  
The FFA mechanism of action of the FX miniRAIL catheter was demonstrated in a 
porcine angioplasty model where with histology post -angioplasty a controlled 
dissection along a focal “nick” was observed with the FX catheter com pared to a 
relatively uncontrolled mural disruption was observed with conventional 
angioplasty balloon catheters; an observation supported with clinical case examples 
showing a localized scoring with the FX cat heter as shown by IVUS and OCT8. 
The first -in-man clinical experience with the FX miniRAIL catheter to support CE -
marking was a single -center registry in Germany where 30 subjects presenting with 
37 lesions, de novo  (68%) and in -stent restenosis (32%), treated with the FX catheter 
followed by stenting (51%), beta -radiation (11%), and no further treatment (38%) 
which resulted in a 8 -month major adverse coronary event [MACE] rate of 8.1%, 
where all events were target l esion revascularization [TLR]9.  
The pivotal IDE trial of the FX miniRAIL catheter was a multicenter registry at 12 
sites where 263 subjects presenting with single or multiple vessel coronary artery 
disease [CAD] treated with the FX catheter, which resulte d in a n in-hospital,  
Procedural Success rate of 94.8%, defined as <50% diameter stenosis in at least one 
FX-attempted lesions without death, Q wave or non -Q wave MI, or emergency 
CABG during the hospital stay, and a Clinical Success rate of 97.1%, defined  as 
freedom from MACE – death, Q wave or non -Q wave MI, or TLR at the 14 -day 
follow -up9. The clinical success included seven (7) subjects with at least one MACE 
event. Six (6) of the patients experienced MACE event(s) while in -hospital, one (1) 
experienced  a MACE event, a  non-Q wave MI  related to a subsequent non -target 
lesion revascularization, not due to the FX miniRAIL procedure.

2.6.2 Scoreflex™ Clinical Experience  
The first FFA catheter developed by OrbusNeich was the SafeCut™ catheter.  Two 
case reports for this first generation product were published in 2007 demonstrating 
the effectiveness of the SafeCut catheter to treat a case with a resistant calcified 
lesion10  a case of in -stent restenosis 1.5 years post -PCI11. 
The second generation of FFA catheters developed by OrbusNeich was the 
Scoreflex catheter.   Pre -clinical bench top and finite element analysis [FEA] 
modeling work with the Scoreflex has demonstrated th e mechanistic action of the 
FFA design with demonstration of superior expansion in a calcium tube model at 
lower pressures than with POBA. FEA modeling revealed concentration of the stress 
observed in the outside of the calcified plaque just opposite the s coring element is 
the underlying mechanism, and validation of the scoring mechanism of crack 
propagation indeed being associated with the scoring elements using ultra -high 
speed videography12. 
The clinical experience with the Scoreflex catheter found in th e literature includes 
several single center studies investigating the safety and effectiveness of FFA 
treatment to prepare lesions for optimal stent deployment and an interesting case 
report.

OrbusNeich Medical Trading, Inc.              Confidential   Page 18 Kato et al.13 reported on a series of 21 consecutive patients presenting with heavily 
calcified lesions treated with rotational atherectomy [RA] followed by either 
Scoreflex or conventional balloon angioplasty/no angioplasty prior to DES 
implantation . Quantitative IVUS imaging was then performed and followed up with 
QCA.  The use of the Scoreflex balloon was associated with a significantly higher 
number of cracks in the calcific plaque as visualized by IVUS compared to balloon 
angioplasty/no angioplasty, 1.8±0.4 versus 1.0±0.8; p=0.02.  Also, the DES 
deployment after Scoreflex dilation showed a significantly improved rate of 
symmetrical deployment, defined as quotient of the minimum and maximum stent 
diameters measured at the point of minimal cross -sectional area [CSA] over balloon 
angioplasty/no angioplasty, 0.83±0.05  versus 0.76±0.07.  No acute stent thrombosis 
and no major complications (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, emergent bypass 
surgery) were observed at in -hospital follow -up.  12 -month angiographic follow up 
found no restenosis with Scoreflex compared to  the balloon angioplasty/no 
angioplasty cohort, which experienced a restenosis rate of 29%.  
Sadamatusu et al14 reported on their single center randomized comparison in 46 
consecutive patients of the effectiveness of Scoreflex predilation versus the use of a 
non-compliant balloon prior to IVUS -guided DES implantation on stent deployment 
and clinical outcomes.  The use of the NC balloons resulted in significantly larger 
balloon sizing (3.33±0.28 vs. 3.09±0.33mm, p=0.01) and significantly higher 
dilation press ures (11.6±3.2 vs. 8.6±2.7 atm., p<0.01) compared with the use of 
Scoreflex.  However, QCA at 8 -month follow -up revealed a significantly smaller in -
stent late lumen loss (0.71±0.63 vs. 0.23±0.52mm, p=0.03) with the Scoreflex group, 
while there were no sign ificant differences observed in the MACE rates between the 
groups.  
Okuya et al15 presented a case report in which a long dissection developed in a 
patient after balloon angioplasty resulting in a flow -compromising intramural 
hematoma. This persisted after a DES was placed over the original balloon dilation 
site.  It was decided to attempt to use the Scoreflex balloon to create a fenestration 
between the true lumen and the hematoma to relieve the flow obstruction.  The 
Scoreflex balloon was able be inserted and deployed distal to the DES which resulted 
to restoration of TIMI -3 flow and the patient’s symptoms subsided with a good 
angiographic result.   Follow -up coronary angiograms at 3 -months and 1 year 
showed that the false lumen remained closed with good co ronary flow in the treated 
vessel.  
 Jujo et al16 reported on their single -center randomized study in 66 consecutive 
patients comparing the effectiveness of predilation prior to DES implantation with 
the Scoreflex balloon versus conventional balloon on fina l stent expansion.  OCT 
imaging was used to shown that stent expansion was shown to be significantly 
higher after pre -dilation with Scoreflex as compared to conventional balloon 
angioplasty with a semi -compliant balloon (68.0% vs. 62.1%, p=0.017) and intim al 
disruption was more prevalent in the scoring group (68.0% vs. 38.4%, p=0.035) and 
more extensive (102° vs. 65°, p=0.038).  Only one case of restenosis necessitating 
TLR was observed in the conventional angioplasty group, otherwise no adverse

performance, rath er than based upon any statistical hypothesis of an endpoint.   
Primary end -point  
The primary endpoint will be  assessed in the intent -to-treat (ITT) patient population. 
Every effort will be  made to reduce bias by obtaining  as much follow -up as possible. 
No imputation of missing data is done for the primary analysis.  
Secondary end -points  
All secondary endpoints are evaluated in the ITT patient population . 
Statistical Methods  
All primary and secondary endpoints will be evalua ted using descriptive statistics only. 
No hypothesis tests will be performed.  
Statistics for continuous outcomes  will include mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, maximum, including two -sided 95% c onfidence intervals, under the 
assumption that the d ata are in a normal distribution.  Binary outcomes  will be 
summarized using frequencies, percentages and two -sided exact 95% confidence 
intervals.  
The b aseline demogra phic and lesion characteristics  and angiographic outcomes  will be 
evaluat ed by descriptive  statistics  for the ITT population , with the same methods as used 
for outcome data .

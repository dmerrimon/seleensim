The study  was pl aced on full clinical ho ld by the United States (US) Food and Drug 
Administrati on (FDA) on 05 Sep 2017. The decision by  the FDA was based on data from non-
Celgene -sponsored studies related to risks of ant i-programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1), 
pembro lizumab, in combinat ion with immunom odulatory  agents. As the result, the study  was 
closed f or further enrollment, and all subjects were discont inued fro m all study  treatm ents 
(durvalumab, lenalido mide and dexamethasone). All subjects are being followed for second 
primary  malignancies (SPMs), every  6 months for 5 years after the last subject has been enro lled 
as per protocol. After stopping data collect ion in the clinical database, any SPM events will 
continue to be recorded in the subject’s sou rce documents, and reported to Celgene Drug Safet y.

Confident ial and Propri etary 8 MEDI4736 -MM -002 Amendment 3.0 Final : 05Dec2019Study Design
This is a mult icenter, open -label, Phase 1/2 study  to determine the recommended dose and 
regimen of durvalumab in co
mbinat ion with LEN with and without dex in subjects with NDMM. 
The study  will consist of a dose -finding phase and a dose-expansio n phase to determine the 
optimal regimen . See Figure 1and Figure 2. 
Dose -finding Phase
The dose -finding phase will determine the recommend dose a nd regimen of durvalumab in 
combinat ion with LEN with and without dex in a 28 -day treatm ent cy cle.
Three treatm ent arm s (A, B and C) will  be enrolled in parallel:
Treatment Cohort A(for high risk transplant non -
eligible [TNE] NDMM subjects)
Intravenous (IV) durvalumab at 1500 mg on Day 1 of a 28-day cycle, 
Oral LEN 25 m g/day (adjust per the creati nine clearance [CrCl ]value, see details in 
Secti on 7.2.1.2 ,andTable 4) on Day s 1 to 21 of each 28 -day treatm ent cycle, 
Oral dex 40 m g/day ( ≤ 75 y ears ol d) or 20 m g/day  (> 75 y ears ol d) on Day s 1, 8, 15, 
and 22 of each 28 -day cycle.
Treatment Cohort B(for ≥ 65 years old TNE NDMM subjects who are not high risk)
Intravenous durvalumab at 1500 mgon Day  1 of a 28 -day cycle, 
Oral LEN 25 m g/day (adjust per the CrCl value, see details in Sect ion7.2.1.2 and 
Table 4) on Days 1 to 21 of each 28 -day treatm ent cy cle, 
Oral dex 40 m g/day ( ≤ 75 y ears ol d) or 20 m g/day  (> 75 y ears ol d) on Day s 1, 8, 15, 
and 22 of each 28 -day cycle (for up to 12 cy cles)
,
Treatment Cohort C(for high risk post-transplant NDMM subjects as maintenance )
Intravenous durvalumab at 1500 mgon Day  1 of a 28 -day cycle, 
Oral LEN 10 m g/day on Days 1 to 21 of each 28 -day treatment cy cle, 
All subjects on these 3 treatm ent Cohort s will continue study  treatm ent until PD or unacceptable 
toxicityoccurs .  
See detailed eligibilit y criteria on Secti on 4.2andSecti on4.3for each cohort .
Based on experience with durvalumab in other indic ations(solid tumors andMDS) , the init ial 
dose of durvalumab will be at 1500 mg every treatment cy cle for each cohort . In the event of 
dose limit ing toxicit ies, the dose of durvalumab woul d be de-escalated to 750 m glevel.
The Dose Review T eam (DRT )are responsible for dosing decisio ns. The DRT members will 
consist of the following: Celgene medical monitor, Cel gene lead safet y physician, Celgene 
biostatistician, other Celgene funct ional area representati ves as appropri ate,andsite investi gator 
and/o r desi gnees .
Initially, 6 subjects will be enro lled into each cohort for dose -limit ing toxicit y (DLT) eval uation 
and will receive 1500 m g durvalumab . The DLT evaluat ion peri od will  be the fi rst treatm ent 
cycle.

expansio n phase may  be initiated wi th durvalumab 1500 mgas the recommended 
dose ( RD); 
If 2 or more of the 6initial subjects experience a DLT within the first cy cle, then the 
maximum tolerated dose ( MTD
)has be en exceed ed and de -escalat ion to durvalumab
750mglevel after revi ew of  safet y and PK/ Pd of the init ial 6 subjects by  the DRT
Any of the cohort s may be removed fro m the study based on emerging PK, Pd, efficacy or safet y 
data.
Dose de -escalat ion will only occur after review of safet ydata (DLT), and possibly PK/ Pd data by  
the DRT. 
Dose -
expansio n Phase
All expansio n decisio ns will be determined by the DRT after review of all safet y, and if 
applicable PK/Pd, and/or biomarker, and/or preliminary  efficacy data.
After all 6 subjects enrolled in the Dose -finding phase have completed the C ycle 1 treatment ;
and all data are obtained and reviewed, addit ional eligible subjects (See detailed eligibilit y 
criteria on Secti on 4.2andSecti on4.3) for each respect ivecohort may be enrolled. The total of 
subjects for each Cohort can be expanded up to 40 (including 6 subjects enro lled in the dose -
finding phase and 34 in the expansio n phase).
The expansio n for each study  cohort can be occurred independent ly.
Study Population
The study  popul ation is to i nclude NDMM subjects who have measurable myelo ma protein (M -
protein) by  protein electrophoresi s analyses (in serum [SPEP] and/or urine [UP EP]) per
International Myelo ma Working Group ( IMWG )criteria.
See Secti on 4.2andSecti on4.3of the protocol  for detailed eligibilit y criteria.
Length of Study
Screening period will be within 28 days pri or to start of Cycle 1. Eligible s ubjects will be treated 
in 28 -day cycles and may  continue study  treatm ent until PDor unacceptable toxicit yoccurs . All 
subjects will have an End of Treatment visit (EOT) within 7 days after di scontinuati on of  all 
study  treatm ent. Subj ects are to return to the study  site 28 + 3 day s after the EOT visit and 90 
(+3) days after the last dose of durvalumab for safety  follow-up visit s.Occurrence of second 
primary  malignancies (SPM) will cont inue to be monitored at the above required 90 day  visit and 
then every  6 months up to 5 y ears after the last subject enrolled into the study . 
The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete t he 
post-treatm ent follow-up, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is 
requi red for primary, secondary  and/or expl oratory analysis, as prespecified in the protocol ,

1.1. Disease Background 
Multiple myel oma (MM) i s a rare and incurable progressive neoplast ic disease that accounts for 
12% of all hematological malignancies (Ferlay, 2015 ). It has been est imated that 24,0 50 new
cases and 1 1,090 deaths fro m MM occur redin the United States (US) in 201 4 (Howl ader, 2014 ), 
and that 114,000 new cases and 80,000 deaths from MM occurred gl obally  in 2012 ( Ferlay , 
2015).
Significant progress has been made in the treatment of MM with various combinat ions of 
melphalan, prednisone, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, cyclopho sphamide, etoposide, cisplat in, 
immun omodulatory  agents (thalido mide ,lenalidomide and pom alidomide ), and proteasom e 
inhibitors (eg, bortezomib and carfilzo mib) or with autologous stem cell transplant fo llowing 
high-dose chemotherapy  (National Co mprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] Guidelines , 
2015). 
Despite the progress in treatment options ;such as newer IMiDs®and proteasom e inhibitor 
classes of drugs , MM remains incurable using convent ional treatments, with an overall 5 -year 
relative survival o f 45% ( Howlader, 2014 ).New treatment options are therefore needed ,
especially  for the high ri sk newly  diagnosed MM pati ents.
Multiple myel oma (MM) i s more recent ly being recogni zed as a heterogeneous group of disease 
with variability in outcom es based on specific clinical and bio logic predictors. Wi th the recent 
increase in treatment armamentarium and the projected further increase in approved therapeutic 
agents in the coming years, the issue of having some mechanism to dissect this heter ogenei ty and 
rationally  apply treatment i s coming to the fore. Based on a number of robust ly validated 
prognosti c markers, MM patients can be broadly categorized into standard, intermediate and high 
risk for disease relapse, morbidit y and m ortali ty. The hi gh-risk features include patient -specific 
factors such as old age, poor performance status and comorbidit ies; clinical features such as 
primary  plasma cell leukemia and extramedullary  disease; disease -specific bio logic features such 
as del etion 17p, t (4;1 4) and high -risk gene expressio n profiling signatures ( Chang, 2014; 
Usmani, 2015). In clinical pract ice, a better definit ion of MM subgroups is essent ial to provi de 
more effect ive personalized therapies. Using combined the Int ernational Staging System (ISS) 
with chrom osomal  abnorm alities (CA) and serum lactate dehy drogenase (LDH) to evaluate their 
prognosti c value in newly  diagnosed MM (NDMM) has improved prognostic power compared 
with the individual ISS, CA, and LDH parameters (Palumbo, 2015 ).
1.2. Compound Background 
1.2.1. Durvalumab (MEDI4736) 
Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 kappa monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) targeted against human programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1). Durvalumab is 
expressed in Chinese hamster ovary  cells and has an overall mo lecular weight of approximately 
149 kDa. Durvalumab selectively binds to human PD -L1 (cluster of differentiation [CD274]) 
with high affinit y and blocks its abilit y to bind to programmed cell death 1 (PD -1[CD279]) 
protein and cluster of differentiation (CD80) . The fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of 
durvalumab contains a triple mutation in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that

1.2.2. Lenalidomid e(LEN)
Lenalidomid e(LEN) is a drug in the class o fimmun omodul atorydrugs known as IMiDs®
compounds, which are structurally similar to thalidomide. AnotherIMiD®compound is 
pomalidomide . All three ( thalido mide, lenalid omide , and pomalidomide ) are approved for the 
treatm ent of MM, and are being evaluated for a number of other hematol ogic m alignancies. The 
lenalido mide also has been approved for the treatment of relapsed mant le cell lympho ma (MCL) 
patients and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with delet ion 5q abnormalit y 
patients.
IMi
Ds®compounds may affect the immune system in several way s, such as inducing immune 
responses, enhancing activi ty of immune cells, altering and modulating the induction of pr o-and 
anti-inflammatory cytokines, andinhibi tinginflamma tion. IMiDs®are al so anti-angiogenic. 
Although their precise mechanism ofaction is curren tly unde r inves tigation, these agents offer 
promise for their anticancer and an ti-inflammator yactivities.

1.3. Rationale
1.3.1. Study Rationale and Purpose
1.3.1.1. Cancer and Immune Function
The importance of the immune system in cancer development and progression has been 
recogni zed during the past thirt y years (Pardoll, 2015; Hanahan, 2011 ). Evidence for tum or 
immune surveillance, a process whereby the immune sy stem  recognizes and eliminates 
transformed and malignant cells, has been clearly shown in carcinogen -induced murine models 
of cancer (Shankaran, 2001; Dunn, 2005 ).  These data suggest that the immune system can seek 
and elimin ates tum or cells, but al so contribute to phenoty pic and genoty pic “shaping” of the 
tumor in a process called immunoedit ing(Dunn, 2004) .  Similarly, the tumor and tumor 
microenvironment can disrupt and alter anti -tumor immune cells through a variety  of 
mechanisms result ing in tumor growth. Once such mechanism is through coercing natural 
checkpoint pathways that control T cell act ivation and inhibit ion.  A seminal observation o f 
inhibit ion of cytotoxi c T-lymphocy te-associ ated an tigen 4 (CTLA -4) in m urine m odels of cancer 
provi ded evidence that manipulat ion of checkpo int blockade coul d significant ly impact tum or 
growth and survival ( Leach, 1996 ).

Confident ial and Propri etary 21 MEDI4736 -MM -002 Amendment 3.0 Final : 05Dec2019Another such checkpo int pathway  involves Programmed cell death -1 (PD -1) and Programmed 
cell death ligand 1(PD -L1). PD -L1 is part of a complex system o f receptors and ligands that are 
involved in controlling T -cell act ivation. PD -L1 acts at mult iple sites in the body  to hel p regul ate 
norm al immune responses and is utilized by tumors to help evade detection and eliminat ion by 
the host immune system tumor response (Keir, 2008) . In the lymph nodes, PD -L1 on antigen -
present ing cells binds to PD -1 or CD80 on activated T cells and delivers an inhibitory  signal  to 
the T cell ( Keir, 2008; Park, 2010 ). This resul ts in reduced T -cell act ivation and fewer activated 
T cells in circulat ion. In the tum or microenvironment, PD -L1 expressed on tumor cells binds to 
PD-1 and CD80 on activated T cells, thus providing an addit ional inhibitory  signal and 
prevent ing T cells fro m killing target cancer cells and protecting the tumor from immune 
eliminat ion (Hirano, 2005 ).  Addit ional mechanisms for PD -L1-mediated immune suppression 
have been described, including promoting regulatory  T cell (Treg) skewing, effector T cell 
apoptosis, and inhibit ing optimal ant igen presentatio n (Chen, 2015 ).
PD-L1 is upregulated in a broad range of cancers with a hi gh frequency, wi th up to 88% 
expressio n in so me tumor ty pes. In a number of these cancers, including lung (Mu, 2011 ), 
renal (Thom pson, 2006; Thom pson, 2005; Krambeck, 2007 ), pancreatic (Nomi, 2007; Loos, 
2008; Wang, 2010) , ovarian cancer (Hamanishi, 2007 ), and hematologic 
malignancies (Andorsky , 2011; Brusa, 2013) tumor cell expressio n of PD -L1 is associ ated wi th 
reduced survival and an unfavorable prognosis .
1.3.1.2. Immune -checkpoint Inhibition
Tumor-infiltrat ing lymphocy tes (TILs) have the capacit y to control  the growth of many ty pes of  
cancers ( Gooden, 2011 ). Most tumors show infiltration by TILs, but tumors modulate the local 
microenvironment through expressio n of inhibit ory molecules. In human disease, engagement of 
TIL cell -surface receptors wi th these inhibitory ligands, such as CTLA -4, LAG -3, TIM -3, and 
PD-1,leads to a dysfunct ional immune response, causes T -cell exhaust ion, and facilitates tumor 
progression ( Baitsch, 2012; Matsuzaki, 2010 ). 
The first successful demo nstrati on of  checkpo int blockade utilized a CTLA -4 ant ibody  
(Ipilimumab) in metastatic melano ma patients (Hodi , 
2010) .  Blockade of the PD -1, and PD -L1 
pathways have shown remarkable clinical activit y not only in conventionally immune -responsive 
tumors such as melano ma (Robert, 2015; H amid ,2013; Brahmer, 2012 ; Topalian, 2012) and 
renal cell carcino ma(Motzer, 2015 )but also in non -small  cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Brahmer, 
2015; Garon, 2015 ), MSIhicolorectal  cancer (Le Dung , 2015 ), and Hodgkins disease (Ansell, 
2015) . The combinat ion of PD -1 and CTLA -4 blockade i s being evaluated across mult iple so lid 
and hematol ogical disease indicat ions and has proven effective in melano ma (Wolchok, 2013 ; 
Larkin, 2015
).
Pembrolizumab and nivo lumab are both PD -1 blocking antibodies and the first in the anti- PD-1 
pathway  family of checkpoint inhibitors to gain ap proval  from the US Food and Drug 
Administrati on (FDA). For metastatic melano ma, single agent pembro lizumab and nivo lumab 
have been approved in the US, EU, Japan and other countries worldwide. The combinat ion of 
nivolumab + ipilimumab has been approved in t he US for metastatic melano ma. Pembro lizumab 
has been approved in the US and nivo lumab in the US and EU for the treatment of advanced, 
previously treated squamous and non -squamous NSCLC.

Confident ial and Propri etary 22 MEDI4736 -MM -002 Amendment 3.0 Final : 05Dec20191.3.2. Rationale for the S tudy Design
Durvalumab has been studi ed primarily in subjects with so lid tumors and a limited number of 
subjects wi th MDS but not on multiple myelo masubject s. While PK and safet y of durvalumab as 
monotherapy  and in combinat ion have been characterized in more than 500 subjects, the 
paraprotein present in myelo ma may alter the PK and Pd of durvalumab and higher doses may  be 
requi red.   The durvalumab in combinat ion with LEN+/ -dex in the newly diagnosed mult iple 
myelo ma (NDMM) populat ion has not been previo usly studied. While the starting dose of 1500 
mg is j ustified based on PK and Pd data and the expectation is that there will not be synergist ic 
toxicity, dose de -escalat ion may be considered.  As dex may interfere with the immune mediate d 
efficacy  of durvalumab but has shown efficacy when added with LEN, this study  aims to 
generate PK/Pd, safet y and preliminary efficacy  data wi th and wi thout the use of dex.
1.3.3. Rationale for Dose, S chedule ,and Regimen Selection
1.3.3.1. Dose/Schedule
1.3.3.1.1. Durvalumab (MED I4736) 
The dose and schedule for durvalumab monotherapy  (20 m g/kg every 4 weeks [Q4W ]) was
selected based on 2 sets of data: (1) the safet y analysis o f doses (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10 mg/kg 
every 4 weeks [ Q2W ]) administered in Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736- 1108 (a Phase 1/2 study  to 
evaluate the safet y, tolerabilit y, and PK of IV durvalumab given as m onotherapy  in subjects wi th 
advanced so lid tumors; and (2) PK profile simulat ions for durvalumab administered using 10 
mg/kg Q2W and 20 mg/kg Q4W schedules.
Safety and PK characteristics of the studied dose and schedule 10 mg/kg Q2W:
After evaluat ion of the PK data fro m subjects enrolled in Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736- 1108, 
durvalumab exhibited nonlinear (dose -dependent) PK consistent with target -mediated drug 
disposi tion. Linear PK was observed at doses of 3 mg/kg and higher and is consistent with near 
complete target suppression, as reflected in target trough plasma concentrations of drug >100 
ug/m L. This trough concentration is supported by  sPD -L1 suppressio n data. Furthermore, the 10 
mg/kg Q2W dose was not associated with any dose-limiting toxicit ies (DLTs )in the dose 
escalat ion phase and was, therefore, selected for further evalua tion in the dose -expansio n phase 
of Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108. Safet y information is presented for 19 patients exposed to 
1500 mg dose monotherapy  (expressed as 20 mg/kg Q4W), in study  CD-ON-MEDI4736- 1108/ 
D4190C00001, and 4 patients exposed in study  D4190 C00002. There are over 100 patients 
treated at the 1500 mg (or the equivalent 20 mg/kg Q4W) dose in co mbination treatm ent studies.
Extrapolation of dose and schedule of 10 mg/kg Q2W to 20 mg/kg Q4W through population PK 
modeling:
A population PK model was developed using durval umab monotherapy  data from  Phase 1 of 
Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736- 1108 ( N=292; doses= 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W or 15 mg/kg every 3 
weeks [Q3W ]; solid tumors ) (Fairman, 2014). Thi s populati on PK m odel adequately descr ibed 
monotherapy  Pharmacokinet icdata and was utilized to predict expected PK exposures fo llowing 
20 m g/kg Q4W dosing regimens (since none of the monotherapy  studi es explored Q4W 
regimens). PK simulations indicate that a similar overall exposure as represe nted by  area under 
the plasma concentration curves ( AUCs )(4 weeks) is expected fo llowing both 10 m g/kg Q2W

with 20 m g/kg Q4W (~1.5 fo ld) and median trough concentration at steady state is expected to 
be higher with 10 mg/kg Q2W (~1.25 fo ld). 
Justification for fixed dosing over w eight -based dosing:
Popul ation PK analysi s indicated only  minor impact of body  weight (WT) on PK of durvalumab
(coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The impact of body  WT-based (10 mg/kg Q2W) and fixed dosing (750 mg 
Q2W) of durvalumab was evaluated by  com paring predicted steady  state PK concentrations (5th, 
median and 95thpercent iles) using the populat ion PK model. A fixed dose of 750 mg was 
selected to approximate 10 mg/kg (based on median body  WT of ~75 kg). A total of 1000 
patients were simulated using body  WT distribut ion of 40 –120 kg. Simulat ion results 
demonstrate that body  WT
-based and fixed dosing regimens yield similar median steady  state 
PK concentrations with slight ly less overall between -subject vari ability with fixed dosing 
regimen.  
Similar findings have been reported by  others ( Ng, 2006; Wang, 2009; Zhang, 2012; Narwal, 
2013). Wang and colleagues invest igated 12 monoclonal ant ibodies and found that fixed and 
body  size-based dosing perform similarly, with fixed dosing being better for 7 of 12 antibodies 
(Wang, 2009
). In addit ion, they  investigated 18 therapeutic proteins and pept ides and showed 
that fixed dosing performed better for 12 of 18 proteins in terms of reducing the between -subject 
variabilit y in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics param eters ( Zhang, 2012 ). 
A fixed dosing approach is preferred by the prescribing communit y due to ease of use and 
reduced dosing errors. Given expectation of similar pharmacokinet ic exposure and variabilit y, 
we considered it feasible to switch to fixed dosing regimens. Based on average body WT of 75 
kg, a fixed dose of 1500 mg Q4W durvalumab (equivalent to 20 mg/kg Q4W) is included in the 
current study .

The LEN and dex dose/schedule will be as p er the current label for lenalidomide for NDMM 
(Revlimid®Prescribing Informat ion, Revlimid Summary o f Product Characterist ics, Revlimid®

1.3.3.2. Regimen
Durvalumab + LEN with and without dex
The synergist ic ant i-proliferat ive activity of IMiDs®and dex has been previously established in 
both in vitro and in vivo ( Revlimid®Prescribing Informat ion, Revlimid Summary of Product 
Characteristics , Revlimid®Product Monograph ; Pomalyst®Prescribing Informat ion; Imnovid™ 
Summary  of Product Characteristics; Gandhi , 2010 ).  However, the immunostimulatory  effect of 
IMiDs®may be inhibited by the ant i-inflammatory action of dex ( Gandhi , 2010 ).  In order to 
gain data on the impact of dex on the potential immunostimulatory  synergy  of durvalumab +LEN 
with dex will  be tested in this study .

It has been observed that lenalidomide, an IMiD®, was capable of down -regul ating the 
expressio n of PD -L1 on the malignant plasma cells fro m MM pat ients and that its in vitro 
applicat ion resulted in an enhancement of the myeloma -targeti ng act ivity of an anti-PD-1 
antibody  (Benson, 2010).  Lenalido mide treatment not only results in a decrease in T -cell 
expressio n of PD -1 but al so down -regulates expression of PD -L1 on m alignant plasma cells fro m 
patients wi th MM.   
Whe n combined, lenalido mide and an anti -PD-L1 ant ibody  dem onstrated a

cells ( Görgün , 2015 ).  PD -L1 is highly expressed in BM -strom a cells ( BMSC).  PD1/PD -L1-
blockade abrogates BMSC -induced MM growth, and co mbined blockade of PD -1/PD -L1 with 
lenalido mide further inhibits BMSC -induced tum or growth. These effects are associated with 
induct ion of intracellular expressio n of IFNγ and Granzyme -B in effector cells.  Lenalidomide 
with PD-1/PD -L1-blockade inhibits MDSC (myeloi d-derived suppressor cells) -mediated 
immune suppression.  
Lenalido mide has shown efficacy in co mbinat ion with dexamethasone for NDMM patients who 
are ei ther 65 y ears of age or ol
der or not candi dates f or stem cell transplant ( Benboubker , 2014), 
and recent ly has been approved by  both Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) for this indicat ion. Studies have been conducted in both the induct ion 
and maintenance transplant setting using lenalidomide.   
The LEN MM -020 Phase 3 is a pivotal study  (FIRST Tri al) wi th the l argest data set in transplant 
non eligible (TNE) newly diagnosed mu
ltiple myelom a (NDMM) patients. 1623 patients were 
rando mized to lenalido mide –dexamethasone in 28 -day cycles unt il disease progression (535 
patients), to the sam e combinat ion for 72 weeks (18 cy cles; 541 patients), or to MPT for 72 
weeks (547 patients). The primary end point was progression -free survival wit h continuous 
lenalido mide –dexamethasone versus MPT. The median progression -free survival was 25.5 
months wit h continuous lenalido mide –dexamethasone, and 21.2 months with MPT (hazard ratio 
for the ri sk of progressi on or death, 0.72 for continuous lenalidomide –dexamethasone vs. MPT, 
P<0.001). Continuous lenalido mide –dexamethasone was superior to MPT for all secondary  
efficacy  end points, Overall survival at 4 years was 59% with continuous lenalido mide –
dexamethasone, and 51% with MPT. 
Cytogenetic abnorm alities in MM patients are prognostic importance and can b e associ ated wi th 
poor outcomes. In the MM -
020 study , a total  of 762 of 1623 pati ents f rom the intent -to-treat 
popul ation had validated cy togeneti c profile, wi th 142 pati ent in the high -risk group (wi th 
t(4:14), or/and, t(14;16), or/and 17p13 delet ions abnorm ality) and 620 patient in the non -high-
risk group. In the high -risk group, median duration of treatment was 10.0 months wit h 
lenalido mide –dexameth asone cont inuous, and 12.0 months with MPT. The lenalido mide –
dexamethasone cont inuous treatment resulted in a 24% reduced risk of death or progression 
compared wi th MPT and an even greater 32% reduced risk in patientswithout hi gh-risk 
cytogeneti cs. In non –high-risk patients , median PFS was 31.1 months with lenalidomide –
dexamethasone cont inuous compa red wi th 24.9 months wi th MPT, the OS was similar across 
treatm ent arm s for high -risk patients. The ORRs in all cytogenet ic risk groups favored 
lenalido mide –dex amethasone cont inuous vs MPT. In patients with high -risk cy togeneti cs, 
higher -qualit y responses were also observed with lenalido mide –dexamethasone cont inuous vs

Three studies in the transplant setting noted prolong edtime to disease progression when used in 
either the m aintenance or induct ion therapy : Attal reported that the rate of complete or very  good 
partial response was 84% for l enalido mide maintenance therapy and 76% for placebo ( p = 0.009) 
(Attal, 2012 ); McCarthy  reported that the median time to progression was 39 months among 
patients in the l enalidomide group and 21 months among pat ients in the placebo group (p < 
0.001) ( McCarthy , 2012 ). The PFS was the primary end point for Palumbo ’s study , and results 
showed median o f 31 m onths of PFS for MPR -lenalido mide group comp ared wi th median of 14 
months for MPR only (hazard ratio, 0.49; p < 0.001) ( Palumb o, 2012 ). 
Based on the current available informat ion from the PD -L1 inhibit ion and lenalido mide, the 
combinat ion of durvalumab + LEN + dex warr ants further investigat ion in NDMM patients.  
1.3.5. Rationale for Pharmacodynamics and Potential Predictive Biomarkers 
Durvalumab (MEDI4736) binds to human PD -L1 wi th high affinit y and blocks i ts abili ty to bind 
PD-1, thus restoring immune act ivation with downstream  effects on cy tokine producti on, 
proliferat ion, cell survival, and transcript ion factors associated with effector T -cell funct ion. 
Measureme nts of pharmacodynamic bio markers, such as so luble PD -L1 saturati on and immune 
cell act ivation status, could help our understanding of the pharmaco logical effect of durvalumab
and contribute to decisio nmakingin the dose and schedule select ion. In addit ion, a number of 
recent studies have reported a correlat ion between several mo lecular markers, including the 
expressio n level of PD-L1 in tumor and immune cells, neoant igen presentation and T-cell 
clonali ty, and the clinical act ivity of immune checkpoint inh ibitors ( Topalian ,2012; Herbst, 
2014). 
Experi ence of MEDI4736 in solid tumors showed that greater responses were observed in 
subjects wi th PD-L1-positive, and much lower rate of responses in subjects with PD -L1-negat ive 
tumors (Segal, 2014 ). More recent data indicates that a combinat ion of elevated PD -L1 protein 
expressio n and elevated IFNgene expressio n in pretreatment tumor biopsies may predict the best 
response to durvalumab monotherapy  (Higgs, 2015; Higgs, 2016 ).Thus, continued evaluat ion of
these bio markers and a broad exploration of addit ional bio markers related to immuno logical and 
disease factors are needed to aid the identificat ion of potenti al predi ctive
biomarkers for this 
therapy .
A key  scientific object ive of this clinical trial is to evaluate the dynamic changes in the 
microenvironment of the tumor. While understanding the immuno logic characteristics at baseline 
may be both predictive and prognostic, it will be extremely crit ical to understand the changes in 
the local immune system  following treatm ent wi th durvalumab and the co mbination agents.  
Biomarker analysis of durvalumab in non-small  cell lung cancer pat ients dem onstrated a 
statist ically signifi cant increase in CD8+infiltrat ing lymphocytes fro m on-treatm ent tum or 
samples co mpared with pre -treatm ent bi opsies. This data is consistent with the PD effects 
observed in tumor biopsies fro m patients treated wit h Atezolizumab (a PD -L1 inhibitor) and 
Pemb rolizumab (a PD -1 inhibitor).  Notably, while pharmacodynamic response to durvalumab 
and MPDL3280A can also be observed in the periphery, peripheral markers have not been 
shown to be correlated with response.  For pembrolizumab, increase in CD8+densit y attumor or 
invasive margin after treatment is observed in responders while absent in progressors in

2014). Serial biopsy  analyses for MPDL3 280 showed that increases in PD -L1 protein expressio n 
and genes indicat ive of act ivated T cells (eg, granzyme, interferon [IFN] -gamma) were more 
frequently observed in pat ients who respond to the therapy  com pared wi th the nonresponders 
(Herbst, 2014 )
.  
Evaluat ion of post -treatm ent tum or sam ples is cri tical for identifying pharm acodynamic changes 
that are induced by  durvalumab. These bio marker data will facilitate better understanding of the 
mechanism o f action for durval umab alone or in combinat ion with other agents to facilitate 
future clinical trial designs.  The data may also reveal new targets/addit ional immune system 
pathways to improve therapeut ic outcomes. 
Recent research on the mechanism of act ion of lenalido mide, pom alidomide ,andthalido mide 
suggest that in tumor cells and T cells, cerebl on, a com ponent of E3 ubi quitin ligase co mplexes, 
is a target for binding by these co mpounds. These studies showed that the loss of cereblo n or i ts 
downstream substrates, such as Ikaros and Ai olos, decreases or eliminates the ant i-tumor and 
immuno modulatory  activity of lenalido mide and pomalido mide respect ively ( Ito, 2010; Zhu, 
2011; Lopez -Girona, 2012 ). In several retrospective analyses, high cerebl onlevels at baseline 
have been reported to be associated with better clinical outcomes in subjects treated with 
regimens containing lenalido mide, pomalido mide ,or thalido mide. Thus, further invest igation is 
warranted on whether there is any potential correl ation of  Cerebl on levelsto clinical  outcom es 
by measuring baseline and on -treatm ent Cereblon levels in tumor and T cells. 
Since both durvalumab and LEN regul ate immune cell act ivation and funct ions, we will also 
quant ify subsets of immune cells and asses s their funct ions from peripheral bl ood and bone 
marrow samples (at baseline and during treatment) to explore whether and how immune 
funct ions are modulated by the individual co mponents and the combinat ions.

3.1. Study Design
This is a mult icenter, open -label, Phase 1/2 study  to determine the recommended dose and 
regimen of durvalumab in co
mbinat ion with LEN wi th and without dex in subjects with NDMM. 
The study  will consist of a dose -finding phase as well as a parallel dose -expansio n phase to 
determine the optimal regimen. See Figure 1and Figure 2and Dose -finding Ph ase.
The dose -finding phase will determine recommended dose ( RD)fordurvalumab in co mbination 
with LEN with and without dex in a 28 -day treatment cy cle. Three treatm ent Cohort s (A, B,and 
C) will be enrolled in parallel :
Cohort A:  durvalumab + LEN +dex on high risk TNE NDMM subjects ;
Cohort B : durvalumab + LEN +dex ( for up to 12 cy cles) on ≥ 65 years o ld TNE 
NDMM subjects who are not high risk ;
Cohort C: durvalumab + LEN as maintenance on post-transpl ant high ri sk NDMM 
subjects ;
In the US, two treatment arms (A and B) will be enro lled in parallel. Cohort C will enro ll upon 
completion of at least 4 cy cles of fo llow-up for safety  assessment of Cohort A and B.  
 
 
On 05 Sep 2017, US FDA placed this study  on full clinical  hold. As a resul t, the study  was 
closed f or further enrollment, and all subjects were discont inued fro m all study  treatm ents 
(durvalumab, lenalido mide and dexamethasone).
Based on experience with durvalumab for other indicat ions, the init ial dose of durvalumab will 
be 1500 m g for each treatm ent cohort .The dose of durvalumab might be de -escalated to 750 mg 
level.
The dose of LEN will be 25 mg (adjustable per the CrCl value, see details in Sect ion 7.2.1.2 ,
Table 4) on Days 1 to 21 of each 28 -day treatm ent cy cle for subjects on Cohort A and B . The 
dose of LEN will be 10 mg on Days 1 to 21 of each 28 -day treatm ent cy cle for subjects on 
Cohort C.
The dose of dex will be 40 m g/day  (for subjects ≤ 75 years old) or 20 mg/day ( for subjects > 75 
years o ld) on Day s 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28- day cycle for Cohort Aand Cohort B (for up to 12 
cycles) . 
Initially, 6 subjects will be enro lled into each cohort and each will receive 1500 m g durval umab. 
The dose -limit ing toxicit y (DLT) evaluat ion peri od will be the first treatment cycle .
If ≤ 1of the 6 initial subjects experience a DLT within the first cy cle, then the dose -
expansio n phase may  be initiated wi th durvalumab 1500 mg as the recommended 
dose (RD);

induct ion and conso lidation treatm ent al ong wi th the first ASCT are allowed) , 
symptom atic MM as defined by  the cri teria bel ow(Rajkumar, 2014 ;NCCN -MM, 2015 ):
MM di agnost ic criteria (all 3 required);
Monoclonal  protein present in the serum and/or urine
Clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥10% orbiopsy -proven bony orextramedullary 
plasmacy toma*
Any one or more of the fo llowing myelo ma defining events:
oone or m ore of the following Myel oma-related organ dysfunct ion (at least one 
of the fo llowing);
[C] Cal cium  elevat ion (serum calcium >1 1.5 m g/dl)[> 2.65 mmo l/L]
[R] Renal insufficiency (serum creat inine >2 mg/dl) [177 mo
l/L or m ore] 
or creatinine clearance < 40 ml/min
[A] Anemia (hemoglo bin <10 g/dl or >2 g /dL below the lower limit of 
laboratory  normal )
[B] Bone l esions(lytic or osteopenic) one or m ore bone lesio ns on skeletal 
radiography , CT, or PET -CT
oone or m ore of the following biomarkers of malignancy:
Clonal bone marrow plasma cell percentage*≥60%
Abnorm alserum  free light -chain rat io ≥100 (invo lved kappa) or < 0.01 
(involved lambda)
                                               
*Clonality should be established by showing κ/λ -light-chain restriction on flow cytometry , immunohistochemistry, 
or immunofluorescence. Bone marrow plasma cell percentage should preferably be estimated from a core biopsy 
specimen; in case of a disparity between the aspirate and core biopsy, the highest value should be used.

dMinimal residual disease levels will be measured by ClonoSIGHT™ NGS assay .  Bo ne marrow aspirate samples will be collected at the screening,  
 (if not overlap with other BMA samples 
time points stated on section 6.4.2 ).Bone marrow aspirate samples collected at the time of multiple myeloma diagnosis must also be available for central 
analy sis (ClonoSIGHT™ NGS assay) for subject s to be considered eligible for the study. The interval between BMA samplings should not be less than 6-
months. With the exception of the screening visit, if the subject underwent BMA sampling within 6 -months of the required sampling date, sampling will be 
delayed until 6 -months after the previous sample.
 
fAll subjects may continue to receive study treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. 
gFirst and Second DURVA infusion:   Subjects will be monitored during and after DUR infusion. Vital signs will be measured prior to DUR administration ( - 30 
minutes), every 15 minutes (± 5 minutes) duri ng DUR administration, at the end of DUR infusion (± 5 minutes), and at 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) and 60 
minutes (± 5 minutes) after DUR infusion, followed by a 2 -hour (± 15 minutes) period of observation. Subsequent DURVA infusions: vital signs will be 
measured prior to the start of the infusion. Subjects should be carefully monitored and blood pressure and other vital signs should be measured during and post 
infusion as per institution standard and as clinically indicated. Any clinic ally significant changes in vital signs should be entered onto an unscheduled vital 
signs CRF page. For the first 3 subjects of each cohort in the dose -finding portion, there will be at least a 24 -hour observation period and 24 to 48 hours after 
that to co mmunicate safety data ( e.g., adverse event [AE], basic laboratory, and vital signs) to the sponsor before the dosing of the next subject occurs.
hFor Coho rt B, the dex can be administered for up to 12 cycles.
iFrom Cycle 5 onwards only thyroid stimulatin g hormone (TSH) will be assessed , if TSH is abnormal, then testing for free T4 and free T3 will be performed .

7.2.1.1. Durvalumab
Durvalumab Product Dose Preparation/Administration
The IV infusio n for subjects will be approximately 1 hour in duration.
For	detailed	information	on	durvalumab dose	preparation	and	administration	please	refer	
to	the	 Pharmacy	Manual .	
Monitoring During/Post Durvalumab Infusion
First and Second DURVA infusion
Subjects will be mo nitored during and after infusion of durvalumab. Vital sign s will be measured 
prior to durvalumab administration (± 30 minutes), every 1 5 minutes (± 5 minutes) du ring 
durvalumab administration, at the end of durvalumab infusio n (± 5 minutes), and at 30 minutes 
(± 5 minutes) and 60 minutes (± 5 minutes) post infusio n of durvalumab, fo llowed by  a 2-hour (± 
15 minutes) period of observat ion.
Subsequent DURVA infusions
For the subsequent DURVA infusio n, vital signs will be measured prior to the start of the
infusio n. Subjects should be carefully mo nitored and blood pressure and other vital signs should
be measured during and post infusio n as per inst itution standard and as clinically  indicated. Any
clinically significant changes in vital signs should be entered onto an unscheduled vital signs 
CRF page.
In the event of a Grade ≤ 2 infusio n-related reaction, the infusion rate of durvalumab may be 
decreased by  50% or interr upted until resolut ion of the event (up to 4 hours) and re -initiated at 
50% of the init ial rate until co mpletion o f the infusio n. In subjects experiencing Grade ≤ 2 
infusio n-related reacti ons, subsequent infusio ns may be administered at 50% of the init ial rate.

As wi th any antibody , allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. Therefore, 
appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylact ic react ions must be 
immediately  available, and study  personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis.
The study  site must have immediate access to emergency resuscitat ion team s and equipment in 
addition to the abilit y to admit subject s to an intensive care unit if necessary.
7.2.1.2. Lenalidomide
Over 60% of a do se of l enalido mide is excreted in urine unmetabo lized. Pharmacokinet ic studies 
have revealed that the plasma area under the plasma concentration -time curve ( AUC )of 
lenalido mide is inversely related to the CrCl ( Chen, 2007 ). Therefore, the dose of lenalidomide 
must be adjusted for renal function on the first day of Cycle 1. The following are 
recommendat ions (seeTable 4) for subjects enrolled in tothe study . The recommendat ions are 
applicable to renal function classified either by measured or Cockcroft -Gaul t estimated CrCl  
(Cockcroft, 1976 ; Luke, 1990 ) 
If the CrCl o fsubjects who had moderate or severe renal insufficiency at baseline (Day  1 of 
Cycle 1) improves during study  treatment wi th 
the study treatm ent, then the dosing regimen of 
lenalido mide can be escalated to the level appropriate to the improved est imated Cr Cl (see
Table 4). Dose escalat ions are to be made at the start of the next cy cle. Di scuss wi th medical  
monitor if this occurs.
Table 4: Lenalido mide Dosing Guideline for Renal Insufficiency for Cohort A and
Cohort B
Renal Function (CrCl) Dosing
Normal to Mild RI (CrCl ≥ 50 mL/min) 25 mg once daily on Days 1 to 21 of each 28- day

Moderate RI (30 ≤ CrCl < 50 mL/min) 10 mgaonce daily on Days 1 to 21 of each 28 -day 
cycle
Sever e RI (CrCl < 30 mL/ min) 15 mg once every otherday from Day 1 to 21 of 
each 28 -day cycle
CrCl = creatinine clearance; RI = renal insufficiency.
aThis dose may be escalated to 15 mg after 2 Cycles at the discretion of the treating physician if the subject 
tolerates the 10 mg dose of lenalidomide without dose -limiting toxicity .
The l enalido mide start ingdose for subjects on CohortC is 10 mg on Days 1 to 21 of each 28 -day

9.1. Overview
All analyses will use descript ive statist ics. No formal statist ical co mpar ison/testing will be 
perform ed.
The analyses will be done by  treatm ent cohort and dose level. Subjects treated with the 
recommended dose in the expansion portion will be combined with the corresponding dose level 
in the dose -determinat ion porti on as one single dose level for efficacy an d safet y analysis.  
9.2. Study Population Definitions
The fo llowing 5 analysis popul ationswill be used: 
Safety popul ation –includes all enrolled subjects who take at least one dose of study 
medicat ion. All safet y analyses will be based on this populat ion
Dose -determining population -includes all subjects from the safet y set who m eet the 
minimum exposure criterion and have sufficient safet y evaluations, or experi ence a 
DLT during the first treatment cy cle 
Full analysis population -includes all subjects enrolled in tothis study
Efficacy evaluable populat ion -includes allenrolled subjects who take at least one 
dose of study  medicat ion and who have measurable disease at baseline and at least 
one post -baseline response assessment
Pharmacokinet ic populat ion -includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of 
study  medicat ion and have evaluable PK profiles. If any subjects are found to be 
nonco mpliant with respect to dosing, have inco mplete data, or encounter other 
circumstances that would affect the eval uation of the PK, a deci sion will be m ade on 
a case -by-case basis as to the inclusion of theirPK data in the statist ical analysis.
9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations
Up to 138subjects are planned to be enrolled in the study : up to 36 total  in the 3 coh orts for dose 
finding and up to 102 in the 3 cohorts for expansio n. 
The actual  number of subjects will depend 
on the number of dose level being tested.

9.8.1. Response Using the IMWG Uniform Response Criteria
Tumor response, incl uding progressive disease , will  be assessed by  the invest igators.  
Theoverall response rate (ORR) will be calculated as the number of responders (at least a Partial 
Response [PR], divided by the number of subjects in the EE population. The ORR together with 
the proporti ons in each response category  based on the IMWG Uniform Response Criteria (ie, 
Stringent Complete Response [sCR], Complete Response [CR], Very  Good Parti al Response 
[VGPR], Partial Response [PR], Stable Disease [SD], and Progressive Disease [PD]) will be 
examined. 
The best overall response categories (CR, VGP R, PR, SD, and progressive disease ) will  be 
tabul ated by  
cohort and dose level. 
9.8.2. R esponse Improvement Rate Using the IMWG Uniform Response Criteria
The Response improvement rate (R IR)analysis only be performed for subjects on Cohort C. The 
RIR defined response change from the assessment at the C1D1. The assessment by invest igator 
using IMWG Uniform  Response Cri teria, will be tabulated by  cohort and dose level .
9.8.3. Time to Response
Time to response (for responders only, per IMWG Uniform  Response Criteria) is calculated as 
the time fro m the first date of dosing of study  medicati on to the first date of documented 
response (PR or better).
Time to response will be summarized using descriptive statist ics by cohort and dose levelfor 
Cohort s A and B .

Adverse events will be coded according to the Medical Dict ionary for Regul atory  Activit ies 
(MedDRA) versio n 18 or higher. The severit y of AEs will be graded according to the NCI 
CTCAE versio n 4.03 or higher.
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as any AE occurring or worsening on 
or after the first treatment of the study  IPs
(durvalumab, LEN, dex ) and within 90 days after the 
last dose of durvalumab . Treatment -emergent AEs, AEs leading to study IP discont inuat ion, AEs 
leading to dose reduction/interruption, AEs related to study IP, SAE s and AE sleading to death 
will be summarized by  system  organ cl ass, and preferred term  for each treatm ent group. A 
summary of AEs with NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or higher, as well as the most frequent preferred 
terms, will be provi ded. A summary  of AEs by  dosing cycle bas ed on onset date will also be

10.1. Monitoring , Recording ,and Reporting of Adverse Events
An AE is any  noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen 
in a subject during the course of a study . It m ay be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening 
concomitant illness, an inj ury, or any  concomi tant impai rment of  the subject’s healt h, including 
laboratory  test val ues (as specified by  the cri teria in Secti on 10.3), regardl ess of eti ology. Any 
worsening (ie, any  clinically significant adverse change in the frequency  or intensi ty of a pre -
exist ing condit ion) should be considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on 
the AE page of the e CRF rather than the indiv idual signs or symptom s of the di agnosis or 
syndro me. 
Abuse, wi thdrawal , sensi tivity,or toxi city to an IPshoul d be reported as an AE. Overdose, 
accidental  or intent ional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be reported on the 
overdose eCRF. (See Section 7.2.3 for the definit ion of overdose.) Any sequela of an accidental 
or intent ional overdose of an IPshoul d be reported as an AE on the AE eCRF. If the sequela eof 
an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela emust be reported on an SAE report form and on the AE 
eCRF. The overdose result ing in the SAE should be ident ified as the cause o f the event on the 
SAE report form and eCRF but should not be reported as an SAE itself .
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive 
supportive measures as necessary . There is no known specific ant idote for durvalumab , LEN ,or 
dex overdose. Actual treatment sho uld depend on the severit y of the clinical situat ion and the 
judgment and experience o f the treati ng physician.
All subjects will be mo nitored for AEs during the study . Assessments m ay include m onitoring of 
any or all o f the following parameters: the subje ct’s clinical symptoms, laboratory , pathol ogical , 
radiological ,or surgi cal findings, physical examination findings, or findings from other tests 
and/or procedures .
All AEs will be recorded by  the invest igator from the time the subject signs informed conse nt 
until 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab , as well as those SAEs made known to the 
investigator at any t ime thereafter that are suspected of being related to study IPs (durvalumab , 
LEN, dex). Adverse event s and SAEs will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF and in the 
subject ’s source documents. All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y within 24 hours 
of the invest igator’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
10.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to: 
10.2.1. Seriousness 
An SAE is any  AE occurring at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (i e, in the opinio n of the invest igator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death fro m the AE);

(hospi talizat ion is defined as an inpatient admissio n, regardl ess of l ength of stay );
Results in p ersistent or si gnificant di sabili ty/incapaci ty (a substant ial disrupt ion of the 
subject’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions);
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect;
Const itutes an important medical event.
Important m edical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death, hospitalizat ion, or disabilit y, but may  jeopardi ze the subject or 
requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
Medical and scientif ic judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizatio ns for:
astandard procedure for protocol therapy administration.  However, hospitalizat ion or 
prolonged hospita lization for a com plicat ion of therapy  administrati on will be 
reported as an SAE. 
routine treatm ent or m onitoring of the studied indication not associated with any  
deteri oration in condit ion.
the administration o f blood or pl atelet transfusio n as routine treatm ent of  studi ed 
indicat ion.  However, hospitalizat ion or prolonged hospitalization for a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
aprocedure for protocol/disease -related invest igations (eg, surgery , scans, endoscopy , 
sampling for la boratory  tests, bone m arrow sam pling). However, hospitalizat ion or 
prolonged hospitalizat ion for a com plicat ion of such procedures remains a reportable 
SAE.
hospitalizati on or prol ongati on of  hospi talizati on for technical , practical , or s ocial 
reasons, in absence of an AE.
aprocedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to start of treatment on study); must be 
docum ented in the source document and the eCRF.  Hospi talizat ion or prolonged 
hospi talizati on for a com plicati on remains a reportable SAE.
an elect ive treatm ent of  or an el ective procedure for a pre -exist ing condit ion, 
unrelated to the studied indicat ion, that has not worsened fro m baseline. 
emergency outpatient treatment or observat ion that does not result in admissio n, 
unless fulfilling other seriousn ess cri teria above.
If an AE i s considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.
For each SAE, the investigator will provide information on severit y, start and stop dates, 
relationship the study  IPs (durval umab, LEN, dex), action taken regarding the study  IPs 
(durvalumab, LEN, dex), and outcome.

Confident ial and Propri etary 78 MEDI4736 -MM -002 Amendment 3.0 Final : 05Dec201910.2.2. Severity/Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator must assess the severit y/ intensity of the event. 
The severit y/intensity of AEs will  be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to the 
current active minor versio n of the Commo n Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, 
Versi on 4.03 or hi gher); 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicat ions/ctc.htm#ctc_40
AEs that are not defined in the CTCAE should be evaluated for severit y/intensity according to 
the following scale:
Grade 1 = Mild –transi ent or mild disco mfort; no limitat ion in act ivity; no m edical  
intervent ion/therapy  requi red
Grade 2 = Moderate –mild to moderate limitat ion in activity, som e assistance may  be 
needed; no or minimal me dical  intervent ion/therapy  required
Grade 3 = Severe –marked limitat ion in act ivity, som e assistance usually required; 
medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalizatio n is possible
Grade 4 =Life-threatening – extreme limitation in activit y, signific ant assistance 
requi red; significant medical intervent ion/therapy  requi red, hospi talizat ion or hospice 
care probable
Grade 5 =Death –the event results in death
The term  “severe” is often used to describe the intensit y of a specific event (as in mild, mod erate 
or severe myocardial infarct ion); the event itself, however, may be of relat ively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache).  This criterio n is notthe same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associ ated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or funct ioning.  
Seriousness, not severit y, serves as a gui de for defining regul atory  obligat ions.
10.2.3. Causality
The invest igator must determine the relat ionship between the administration of the study  IPs 
(durvalumab , LEN , dex) and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as 
defined below:
Not suspected: a causal relat ionship of the adverse event to study IPs 
(durvalumab , LEN , dex) administration is unlikely or remote , 
or other medications, therapeuti c intervent ions, or underlying 
condi tions provi de a sufficient explanat ion for the observed 
event.
Suspected: there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of study  
IPs (durvalumab , LEN , dex) caused the adverse event.  
‘Reasonable po ssibilit y’ means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relat ionship between the study  IPs (durvalumab , LEN , 
dex) and the adverse event.

If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or addit ional 
treatm ent that has not been manufactured or provided by  Celgene, pl ease provi de the name of the 
manufacturer when reporting the event.
10.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.
10.2.5. Action Taken
The invest igator will report the action taken with study  IPs (durvalumab, LEN, dex) as 
applicable (eg, discont inuat ion, interruption, or dose reduction of IP, as appropriate) and report if 
concomitant and/or addit ional treatments were given for the event. 
10.2.6. Outcome
The invest igator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs .
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discont inuatio n of the subject’s participat ion in the study  
must be fo llowed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to 
the SAE ).
10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laborator y value is considered to be an AE ifthe abnorm ality:
resul ts in discont inuat ion from the study;
requi res treatm ent, m odificat ion/ interruption of study  IPs (durvalumab, LEN, dex)
dose, or any  other therapeuti c intervent ion; or
is judged to be of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease 
process and/or organ toxicit y, or is an exacerbat ion or worsening of an exist ing 
condi tion.
Regardless of severit y grade, only  laboratory  abnorm alities that fulfill a seriousness criteri on 
need to be document ed as a serious adverse event.
If a laboratory  abnorm ality is one com ponent of a di agnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF. If the abnormalit y was not 
a part of a d iagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory  abnorm ality should be recorded as the AE. 
If possible, the laboratory  abnorm ality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply  as an 
abnorm al laboratory  resul t (eg, record thrombocy topeni a rather than decrea sed platel ets).

10.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential:
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated β-hCG or posi tive pregnancy test in a 
female subject of childbearing potential regardless of disease state) occurring while the subject is 
on study  treatm ent, or wi thin 90 days after last dose of durvalumab are considered immediately 
reportable events. Inves tigational product is to be discontinued immediately  and the subject 
instructed to return any unused portion of the study  IPs to the invest igator . The pregnancy , 
suspected pregnancy , or posi tive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y 
immedi ately  by email , phone or facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy  
Initial Report Form , or approved equivalent form.
The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician -gyneco logist, preferably  one 
experienced in reproductive toxicit y for further eval uation and counseling.
The invest igator will monitor the female subject unt il completion of the pregnancy , and must 
notify Celgene Drug Safet y immediately  about the outcom e of the pregnancy  (either norm al or 
abnorm al outcom e) using the Pr egnancy Fo llow-up Report Form , or approved equivalent form.
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the invest igator 
shoul d report the abnorm al outcom e as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any o f the seri ous 
criteria, i tmust be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safet y by facsimile, or other appropriate 
method, within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowl edge of  the event using the SAE Report 
Form , or approved equivalent form .
All neonatal  deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causalit y, as SAEs. In addi tion, any  infant death after 28 day s that the invest igator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the study  IPs (durvalumab, LEN, or dex) shoul d also be

pregnant, the male subject taking study  IPs (durvalumab, LEN , or dex) shoul d notify  the 
investigator , and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call her healt hcare provider 
immediately .
10.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the complet ion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF. All SAEs m ust be reported to

Criteria
Response CategoryaResponse Criteria
Stringent Complete 
Response (sCR)CR as defined below, plus
Normal free light -chain (FLC) ratio and
Absence of c lonal plasma cells by immunohistochemistry or 2 -to 4-color 
flow cytometry
Complete Response 
(CR)Negative immunofixation of serum and urine and
Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and
≤ 5% plasma cells in bone marrow
In patients in whom the only measurable disease is by serum FLC levels: 
CR in such patients indicates a normal FLC ratio of 0.26 to 1.65 in 
addition to CR criteria listed above. 
Very Good Partial 
Response (VGPR)Serum and urine M -protein detectable by immunofixation but not on 
electrophoresis or
90% or greater reduction in serum M -protein plus urine M- protein level 
<100 mg per 24 hours
In patients in whom the only measurable disease is by serum FLC levels: 
VGPR i n such patients requires a > 90% decrease in the difference 
between involved and uninvolved FLC levels.
Partial Response (PR) ≥ 50% reduction of serum M -Protein and reduction in 24 -hour urinary M -
protein by ≥ 90% or to < 200 mg per 24 hours
If the serum a nd urine M -protein are not measurable, a ≥ 50% decrease in 
the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in 
place of the M -protein criteria.
If serum and ur ine M -protein are unmeasurable, and the serum free light 
assay is also unme asurable, ≥ 50% reduction in plasma cells is required in 
place of M -protein, provided baseline bone marrow plasma cell 
percentage was ≥ 30%
In addition to the above, if present at baseline a ≥ 50% reduction in the 
size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required.
Stable Disease (SD) Not meeting criteria for CR, VGPR, PR, or progressive disease

Confident ial and Propri etary 102 MEDI4736 -MM -002 Amendment 3.0 Final : 05Dec2019Response CategoryaResponse Criteria
Progressive disease Requires only one of the following:
Increase of 25% from lowest response value in any of the 
following:
Serum M -component (absolute increase must be ≥ 0.5 g/dL), 
and/or
Urine M -component (absolute increase must be ≥ 200 mg/24 h), 
and/or
Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M -protein levels: the 
differ ence between involved and uninvolved FLC le vels (absolute 
increase must be ≥ 10 mg/dL)
Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M protein levels and 
without measurable disease by FLC levels, bone marrow plasma cell 
percentage (absolute percentage must be ≥ 10%)
Definite development of ne w bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or 
definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue 
plasmacytomas
Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium > 11.5 mg/dL) 
that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell prolifer ative disorder
Additional Response Criteria
Molecular Complete 
ResponseCR plus negative allele -specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain 
reaction (ASO -PCR), sensitivity 10-5
Immunophenotypic 
Complete Response Stringent CR plus
Absence of phenotypically aberrant plasma cells (clonal) in BM with a 
minimum of 1 million total BM cells analyzed by multiparametric flow 
cytometry (with > 4 colors)
Minimal Response (MR)
in patients with relapsed 
refractory myelom a 
adopted from the European 
Group for Blood and 
Marrow Transplantation 
(EBMT) criteria≥ 25% but ≤ 49% reduction of serum M -protein and reduction in 24 -hour 
urine M -protein by 50% -89%
In addition to the above criteria, if present at baseline, 25% -49% 
reduction in the size of soft tissue plasm acytomas is also required
No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions (development of 
compression fracture does not exclude response)
aAll response categories (CR, sCR, VGPR, PR, a nd PD) require 2 consecutive assessments made at any time before 
the institution of any new therapy; CR, sCR, VGPR, PR, and SD categories also require no known evidence of 
progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. VGPR and CR categories require serum 
and urine studies regardless of whether disease at baseline was measurable on serum, urine, both, or neither. 
Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements. Bone marrow assessments need not 
be confirm ed. For PD, serum M -component increases of more than or equal to 1 g/dL are sufficient to define 
relapse if the starting M -component is ≥ 5 g/dL.

Note: The toxicity management guidelines in Appendix D -1, D-2, and D -3 prepared by the sponsor are to assist the 
investigator in the exercise of his/her clinical judgment in treating these types of toxicities and should be applied to 
management of adverse events related to study treatment and not ANY adverse event.
Appendix D -1: Durvalumab Treatment Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune -related Adverse 
Events
Dose Modifications Toxicity Management
Immune -related 
Adverse Events 
(Overall 
Management 
For toxicities 
not noted below)Drug administration modifications of durvalumab will be made to 
manage potential immune -related AEs based on severity of 
treatment -emergent toxicities graded per NCI CTCAE v4.03.
In addition to the criter ia for permanent discontinuation of 
durvalumab based on CTC grade/severity (table below) , 
permanently discontinue durvalumab for  the following 
conditio ns: 
Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of ≤10 mg of 
prednisone per day (or equivalent) withi n 12 weeks after 
last dose of durvalumab
Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 treatment -
related AE following resumption of dosing.It is recommended that management of irAEs follow the guidelines 
presented in this table
Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology (eg, disease progression, concomitant 
medications, infections, etc.)
In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, all events should 
be considered potentially immune related
Symptomatic and topica l therapy should be considered for 
low-grade (Grade 1 o r 2, unless otherwise specified) events 
For persis tent (greater than 3 to 5 days) low -grade (Grade 2)  
or severe (Grade ≥3) events  promptly start prednisone 1 -2
mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent 
If symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid tapering (28 
days of taper), increase the corticosteroid dose (prednisone 
dose  [eg ,up to 2 -4mg/kg/day or IV equivalent])   until 
stabilization or improvement of symptoms, then resume 
corticosteroid tapering at a slower rate(> 28 days of taper)
More potent immunosuppressives such as TNF inhibitors (eg ,
infliximab) –(also refer to the individual sections of the 
immune related adverse event for specific type of 
immunosuppressive) should be considered for events n ot 
responding to systemic steroids  
Discontinuation of durvalumab is not mandated for Grade 3 / 
Grade 4 inflammatory reactions attributed to local tumour 
response (eg ,inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic 
disease, ly mph nodes etc.). Continuation o f durvalumab in this Grade 1      No dose modification
Grade 2      Hold study drug/study regimen dose until Grade 2 
resolution to ≤Grade 1
If toxicity worsens then treat as Grade 3 or Grade 4
Study drug/study treatment can be resumed once event
stabilizes to Grade ≤ 1 after completion of steroid taper
Patients with endocrinopathies who may require 
prolonged or   continued steroid replacement can be 
retreated with durvalumab on the f ollowing 
conditio ns: 1) the event stabilizes and is controlled , 2) 
the patient is clinically stable as per investigator or 
treating physician’s clinical judgement, and 3) doses 
of prednisone are at less than or equal to 10 mg/day  or 
equivalent.

Immune -
mediated 
peripheral 
neuromotor 
syndromes, such 
as Guillain -Barre 
and My asthenia 
GravisGeneral Guidance The prompt diagnosis of immune -mediated peripheral 
neuromotor syndromes is important, since certain patients may 
unpredictably experience acute decompensations which can 
result in substantial morbidity or in the worst case, death. 
Special care should be t aken for certain sentinel symptoms 
which may predict a more severe outcome, such as prominent 
dysphagia, rapidly progressive weakness, and signs of 
respiratory  insufficiency or autonomic instability
Patients should be evaluated to rule out any alternative 
etiology (eg, disease progression, infections, metabolic 
syndromes and medications, etc.). It should be noted that the 
diagnosis of immune -mediated peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes can be particularly challenging in patients with 
underlying cancer, due to t he multiple potential confounding 
effects of cancer (and its treatments) throughout the neuraxis. 
Given the importance of prompt and accurate diagnosis, it is 
essential to have a low threshold to obtain a neurological 
consult
Neurophy siologic diagnostic te sting (eg, electromyogram and 
nerve conduction investigations, and “repetitive stimulation” if 
myasthenia is suspected) are routinely indicated upon 
suspicion of such conditions and may be best facilitated by 
means of a neurology consultation 
Important to consider that the use of steroids as the primary 
treatment of Guillain-Barre is not typically considered 
effective. Patients requiring treatment should be started with

MYASTHENIA GRAVIS
Steroids may be successfully used to treat Myasthenia 
Gravis. Important to consider that steroid therapy 
(especially with high doses) may result in transient 
worsening of myasthenia and should typically be 
administered in a monitored setting under supervision of 
a consulting neurologist.
Patients unable to tolerate steroids may be candidates for 
treatment with plasmapheresis or IVIG. Such decisions 
are best made in consultation with a neurologist, taking 
into account the uni que needs of each patient.
If My asthenia Gravis -like neurotoxicity present, consider 
starting acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibitor therapy 
in additio n to steroids. Such therapy, if successful, can 
also serve to reinforce the diagnosis.

Summary  of Changes MEDI4736- MM-002 Celgene Corporati on
Confident ial and Propri etary 4 MEDI4736 -MM -002Amendment 2.0 Final: 06 Apr 2017Update to collect TCR Clonalit y and neoant igens PBMC sample at C2D15 timepo int
(Secti on 6.6) .  This sample will be used to compare matched bone marrow and blood 
sampling at the same timepo intin TCR Clo nality and neoant igen analyses.  If the 
PBMC sample shows equivalency  to the bone marrow sample this could lead to less 
invasive sample collection. 
Updat e tosoluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1)testing t imepo ints(Secti on 6.6) .  The removal o f 
all timepo ints,except Screening and predose C1D1 .mirrors what is being 
implemented across the entire Celgene MEDI4736 Program.
Update to References ( Section 17)
Update to Durvalumab Treatment Modificat ion and Toxicit y Management Guidelines
(Appendices D-1, D-2 and D -3)
Correcti onsof minor spelling/grammat ical errors.

Summary  of Changes MEDI4736- MM-002 Celgene
Confident ial and Propri etary 3 MEDI4736 -MM -002Amendment 1.0 Final:  27 Jun 20161. JUSTIFICATION FOR AM ENDMENT
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
The m onitoring of  blood pressure and other vital signs during and post durvalumab infusion 
beyo nd Cycle 2 was modified to enable the study  site to follow inst itutional standard practi ce 
or as clinically indicated at discretion of the treating physician . As reported in Durvalumab 
(MEDI4736) Invest igator’s Brochure versio n 9.0 dated 22Jan2016, in clinical studies wit h 
durvalumab as a monotherapy , the inci dence of reported potential infusio n-related reacti on 
was l ow. In parti cular for the serious case reports of investigator assessed infusion -related 
reacti on, 10 of 1,265 subjects treated with durvalumab in 5 sponsored monotherapy  studi es 
(CD- ON-MEDI4736- 1108, D4190C00002, D4190C00007, D4191C00003, and 
D4193C00001) reported 14 cases of infusio n-related reacti ons, giving an overall frequency 
of 0.8% (10/1,265). These events/reactions respond to antihistamine, drug 
interrupti on/wi thdrawal , decrease in infusion rate and supportive treatment. In addit ion, in 
the current ongoing MEDI4736 -MM- 001 study  (durvalumab ± po malidomide ± 
dexamethasone in relapsed and refractory  multiple myelo ma), as of 09Jun2016, no 
significant infusi on react ions have been reported for the 21 subjects treated with eit her 
durvalumab monotherapy , durvalumab + pom alidomide, or durvalumab + pomali domide + 
dexamethasone. (Section 5 footnote g and Section 7.2.1.1)
Minor clarifications and corrections are summarized below:
Update to Tabl e of Events to permit urinalysis to be perform ed by l ocal laboratory  
(Secti on 5, Tabl e of Events)
Update to Section 3.2.2 and Table of Events to clarify that for the fi rst 3 subjects of 
each cohort in the dose -finding portion, there will be at least a 24-hour observat ion 
period.  The 24 hour observation period should be communicated to the sponsor 
within24 to 48 hours .  The report should include safety data (e.g., adverse event 
[AE], basic laboratory , and vital signs ]to the sponsor before the dosing of the next 
subject occurs. (Section 3.2.2, and Section 5 footnote g)
Update to Treatm ent Period from the time of Interactive Response Techno logy (IRT) 
to allow registrati on up to 3 day s prior to ini tiating study  treatm ent on Cycle 1 Day  1 
(C1D1) (Section 6.2)
Update from durvalumab given in co mbinat ion with lenalidomide wit h “or” wi thout 
dexmethasone, to with “and” w ithout dexamethasone for grammat ical clarit y (Study  
Design, Secti on 1.3.3.2, and Section 3.1)
Correcti on of  minor spelling/grammat ical errors (Section 6.4.3 and Secti on 8.2)
Update from “Celgene Corporati on”to“Celgene ”for administrative reasons (Secti on
7.1.3)

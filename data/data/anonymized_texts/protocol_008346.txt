 General Study Information   Principal Investigators:  Yogish Kudva – Mayo Clinic, Carol Levy – Mt. Sinai, Jordan Pinsker – Sansum Diabetes Research Institute, and Eyal Dassau – Harvard John A Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences  Study Title: Observational study of patient important outcomes in pregnant patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus on Insulin pump   Protocol version number and date: V3, JUN 18, 2019.   Research Question and Aims   Hypothesis: We anticipate that when compared to subjects using an Artificial pancreas system(AP) as part of a future protocol, this comparator group of subjects undergoing usual care will exhibit less time in target Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) glucose range defined as 63-140 mg/dL and an increased duration of hypoglycemia with CGM glucose <63 mg/dL.   Aims, purpose, or objectives: The overall goal of this study is to serve as a comparator group to a group of patients that will be managed with AP for varying periods of time during pregnancy.  We will enroll this cohort and follow them prospectively throughout the pregnancy and into the post-partum period.  Data collected will include   records of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) based glucose, insulin delivery, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), and maternal and fetal outcomes from pregnant women with type 1 diabetes.

Background (Include relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc.):   Pregnancy in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) continues to be associated with mortality, preeclampsia, hypertension, and premature labor, all linked to hyperglycemia throughout gestation. Pregestational and gestational elevations of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (a standard measure of glucose control in people with diabetes) and gestational time in target glucose range, time in hyperglycemia, and perhaps incidence of severe hypoglycemia have been associated with poorer outcomes. To reduce the risk of poor maternal and fetal outcomes, more stringent glucose targets for pregnant T1D women are recommended; however the quest to reduce hyperglycemia results in a significantly higher risk of hypoglycemia [1]. The greatest risk for both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia often occurs overnight when patients are least able to make insulin dose adjustments. To optimize outcomes for women with T1D, more knowledge regarding CGM based glucose variability during the pregnancy and the changes in insulin requirements and sensitivity throughout pregnancy are needed.  This information would facilitate the development of an automated insulin delivery system tailored to the specific needs of this population.   Pregnancy is characterized by complex hormonal and metabolic changes. The first trimester of pregnancy is a time when women are the most insulin sensitive and hypoglycemia can be problematic for women with diabetes  [2, 3]; whereas by late pregnancy, insulin resistance  develops and requires an increase of 200-250% in insulin secretion in women without diabetes [2, 4]. This increased insulin requirement in pregnant women with T1D makes it very challenging to maintain euglycemia, which is necessary to promote the health of both the mother and the developing fetus.  Sansum Diabetes Research Institute (SDRI) was the only US clinical site for the recent landmark CONCEPTT trial which revealed the benefit of CGM use on pregnancy outcomes and modest improvement in HbA1c. The CONCEPTT study revealed benefits of CGM use in pregnant women with T1D, demonstrating that in the setting of comparable overall good glucose control reflected by HbA1c level (mean HbA1c 6.35% in CGM group vs 6.53% in non-CGM group; p=0.0207), pregnant CGM users spent more time in target (68% vs 61%; p=0.0034) and less time hyperglycemic (27% vs 32%; p=0.0279) than did pregnant control participants, with comparable severe hypoglycemia episodes (18 CGM and 21 control) and time spent hypoglycemic (3% vs 4%; p=0.10) [6]. Fewer fetal adverse outcomes were reported for subjects wearing CGM [6]. CGM wear in this study was reported at 70% using the Medtronic Guardian sensor which requires calibration 2-4 times each day, is inaccurate in the setting of acetaminophen use, and must be replaced every 6 days. The Dexcom G6 CGM which provides high accuracy, mean absolute relative difference (MARD) <10 %, factory calibration, ten-day wear, and no acetaminophen interference should be particularly advantageous in the pregnant population.  There have been three hybrid AP studies published from European investigators showing safety and efficacy in pregnant women with T1D. The first study by Murphy et al. in 2011 conducted closed loop studies for 24 hours in an inpatient clinical research center in 10 pregnant women with T1D at 14.8 and 28 weeks of pregnancy [7]. The system required data entry by an RN every 15 minutes into a laptop computer that stored the algorithm. Overnight time in range was 84% and 100% (63-140 mg/dL) in the early and late gestation groups, respectively, with no hypoglycemia. Two follow up studies [8, 9] utilized a Sooil insulin pump and freestyle Navigator II

Subjects (16 in each study) were studied in a randomized crossover fashion and served as their own controls. Subjects wore the system for 4 weeks overnight (Stewart et al., 2016) or wore the system day and night (Stewart et al., 2018). Results of these studies revealed the safety of the system in the home setting with fewer episodes of hypoglycemia and increased overnight time in the target glucose range of 63-140 mg/dL. In the overnight study, time in range (74.7 vs. 59.5% [95% CI 6.1 to 24.2]; P = 0.002) and mean glucose (119 vs. 133 mg/dL, P = 0.009) were significantly better. Time above goal was significantly reduced (>140 mg/dL: 24% vs 38.6%, P= 0.005; >180 mg/dL 7.4% vs 15.7%, P=0.004). In the day and night study, there were significantly fewer hypoglycemic episodes (median [range] 8 [1–17] vs. 12.5 [1–53] over 28 days; P =0.04) and time below goal was less (<63 mg/dL: 1.6 vs. 2.7%; P = 0.02; <50-mg/dL: 0.24 vs. 0.47%; P = 0.03). The time in range overall for the latter study was comparable between groups, but there was a trend toward higher overnight time in target (67.7 vs. 60.6%; P = 0.06). Maternal glycemia, however, was variable. Five (31%) of the study participants spent less time in target range and had higher mean glucose levels during AP therapy. These data support the importance of studying AP systems further in pregnant women with T1D. We will study several outcomes prospectively in this study including insulin delivery, CGM glucose specifically Dexcom G6 based glucose and maternal/fetal outcomes We will also evaluate the accuracy of the G6 based system with glucose meter testing at specific time points throughout the pregnancy.   Preliminary Data:   At the Mayo Clinic, Rochester during the years 2009-2013, 52 pregnant patients with T1D were seen with 32 (62%) using insulin pumps and none using sensor augmented insulin pumps (unpublished data). More recently, from 2013-2018, 60 pregnant patients with T1D were seen at Mount Sinai Hospital with 48 (80%) using insulin pumps and 34 (57%) using sensors. SDRI regularly provides care for 10 pregnant women with T1D per year who use these devices and was the only US clinical site for the recent landmark CONCEPTT trial.    The research teams at Barbara Davis Center and Joslin Clinic have studied CGM use   in T1D pregnancies [10, 11].   Twenty-five pregnancies occurring between 2012-2017 in 22 patients seen at Mount Sinai Hospital and Mayo Clinic have been retrospectively reviewed (see figures). Pump settings at the initial visit and at designated 2-week intervals each trimester were analyzed. Compared to the initial visit, basal infusion rates overnight and in the morning decreased during the 1st trimester and rose in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters.  Midday and evening infusion rates peaked during the late 2nd trimester to early 3rd trimester before plateauing during the last month of pregnancy. Carbohydrate ratios became more aggressive after week 12 with the earliest change in settings seen at breakfast. By the end of pregnancy, carbohydrate ratios had decreased by an average of 45%. Insulin sensitivity factors became more aggressive starting in the late 2nd trimester resulting in a 20% change from baseline by the end of pregnancy [5].

       Page 4 of 13  Summary:  Understanding the hormonal and metabolic complexity as well as the subsequent requirements of adaptive insulin management over the entire gestation period in T1D will enable us to develop mathematical models that will describe the fluctuating glucose-insulin interactions during pregnancy. A multicenter database including CGM and insulin settings/bolus information from pregnant women during the gestation period will be collected to: 1) to serve as a comparator group for analysis of future AP studies data, 2) to further examine the glycemic variability and insulin management requirements throughout pregnancy to refine our AP algorithms, 3) to provide additional information on CGM use in pregnant women in comparison to fingerstick data utility, patient acceptance, and pregnancy outcomes.    Study Design and Methods   Methods:  Describe, in detail, the research activities that will be conducted under this protocol:   All pregnant women with T1D at up to five sites on insulin pumps (CSII/SAP/PLGS) will be offered enrollment in a prospective study that will capture: 1) Dexcom G6 CGM data, 2) self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), 3) insulin pump settings, 4) insulin delivery records, and 5) maternal and fetal outcomes.   Outpatient Screening and Enrollment:  Participants will be offered enrollment any time from pregnancy confirmation to 16 weeks and 6 days of gestational age. Participants will provide informed consent and will sign IRB-approved consent forms after eligibility has been confirmed based on pre-consent screening inclusion and exclusion criteria.   The study physician will perform a detailed history and physical with special emphasis on diabetes history. We will record participants’ body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), average total daily insulin use (calculated over 1 week), insulin: carbohydrate ratio, correction factor (insulin sensitivity factor), insulin infusion basal rate profile, and HbA1c as a marker of overall glycemic control. Data from insulin pump and blood glucose meters will be downloaded using appropriate software and archived using an electronic process to avoid data recording errors.   We will obtain routine vital signs and draw blood for screening labs, including HbA1c, hematocrit, AST, creatinine and TSH. Since all these subjects will be pregnant, these tests may be available close to recruitment. If so, those tests will be used, and unnecessary testing will be avoided. HbA1c measured within one month +/- 1 week of screening and other tests within 3 months +/- 2 weeks of screening will be accepted. If the study physician feels it is necessary, a c-peptide lab (with simultaneous glucose for c-peptide validation) can also be conducted at screening to confirm a type 1 diabetes diagnosis. This study is not meant to find out if the participant has any other disease or problem. The study leaders will alert the participant if any of the research results are important to her health during the study. The participant may have a copy of the screening tests to discuss with her personal physician.  Participants will be provided a study glucometer and supplies. They will be trained on the use of the meter including to perform fingersticks on clean, dry hands and to use only finger sticks for glucose assessments. Participants will be required to perform SMBG 8 times a day (before meals, after meals, at bedtime and overnight between 2-4 am) on one day during every  four week interval of their pregnancy.    Subjects will be

       Page 5 of 13  supplied tests strips and permitted to perform additional fingersticks for testing as they desire as is standard of care for pregnant women with T1D.  Participants will be provided a study Dexcom G6 glucose sensor and supplies. They will be trained on proper insertion, calibration, and maintenance of the CGM sensor. Training will be tailored to their individual experiences (no prior CGM use, prior CGM use on different sensor).   G6 can be calibrated or used with factory calibration with the choice being made at the start of each probe insertion by the subjects. This information will be captured.   Follow up visits:   Research staff will contact patients 1 day and 1 week after G6 initiation visit and thereafter every 14±4 days. These contacts can occur at participants’ regularly scheduled follow up visits with maternal fetal medicine or at visits for diabetes management or over the phone. The number of follow up visits will depend on the week of pregnancy of the participant at enrollment.  During these contacts, study CGM and blood glucose meters will be downloaded (either in person or remotely) to have data from every week of pregnancy. Concerns regarding subjects’ glycemic control will be conveyed to their provider for appropriate insulin titration.   Personal insulin pumps will be downloaded whenever CGM data are downloaded and whenever settings are changed (either in person or remotely). Pregnancy complications will be recorded. At clinic visits, CGM sites will be inspected.  We will also collect self-reported food diary and activity log at least 2 times per pregnancy within 2 weeks ± 1 week of  enrollment and at 30 weeks ±2 weeks  to  assess  amount of carbohydrates consumed  per day to see if  the quantity changes during pregnancy.  In addition, food and activity logs will be collected if available.   Study personnel will be available at all times throughout the trial to answer any question or troubleshoot any sensor problem.   Postpartum visit: After delivery, the participants will return study devices at or around the time of their routine post-partum follow up visit. Medical records including method of delivery, gestational age at delivery, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions, neonatal hypoglycemia, fetal weight, and length of hospital stay will be reviewed. The infant’s medical record will also be accessed to retrieve post-delivery medical information. Subjects will also be asked if they were given any medications such as steroids that are known to cause insulin resistance which would impact blood glucose control.  Subjects will be asked to complete the CGM-SAT survey (a survey assessing satisfaction with the glucose sensor) at this visit[12].     Data analysis:  Data from the 3 sites will be de-identified and collected in a central HIPPA compliant data repository.   Patterns of insulin and glucose control (including time in range 60-140 mg/dL, frequency of severe hypoglycemic events, time spent above target range, time spent in hypoglycemic range, episodes of clinically significant hyperglycemia with CGM >180 mg/dL, episodes of ketoacidosis requiring emergency room or hospital admission) will be analyzed and association with outcomes calculated.

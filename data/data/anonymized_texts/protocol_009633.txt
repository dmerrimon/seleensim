The Impact of Waterpipe Tobacco Flavors on Waterpipe Smoking Intentions, 
Perceptions, Patterns, and Toxicant Exposure  
Principal Investigator: Theodore L. Wagener, Ph.D. 
Sponsor: National  Institutes of Health  
This is a research study. Research studies involve only individuals who choose to 
participate. Please take your time to make your decision. Discuss this with your family 
and friends.  
The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center d oes not endorse nicotine or 
tobacco use. For assistance with quitting tobacco use, please call 1 -800-784-8669.  
Why Have I Been Asked To Participate In This Study?  
You are being asked to take part in this study because you are a current Hookah user who 
is interested in using hookah in the next 6 months.  
Why Is This Study Being Done?  
The purpose of this study is to see what people think about different types of hookah 
preparations.  
How Many People Will Take Part In The Study?  
About 94 people will take part i n this study. All participants will participate at this 
location.  
What Is Involved In The Study?  
You will come to the lab on four different days, with each day separated by at least 48 
hours, and asked to smoke a different type of hookah tobacco on each da y. You will 
smoke each hookah tobacco for up to 1 hour, and each visit will last approximately 2 
hours to provide you time before and after smoking to complete self -report measures and 
for the research assistant to collect blood samples.  
If you take part i n this study, here is what will happen at the study visits:  
• At every visit, you will fill out questionnaires about smoking and take a 
breathing test.  
• At each visit, you will provide blood samples before smoking hookah, 
during a 10 -minute puffing period (o ne sample after 5 minutes and another 
after 10 minutes), and after smoking hookah. We will test the blood 
samples for nicotine. The blood draw will be conducted by a trained 
research staff or nurse.

How Long Will I Be In The Study?  
You will be in the study  for between 1 week and 6 months, depending on the duration of 
the periods between study visits. There may be anticipated circumstances under which 
your participation may be terminated by the investigator without regard to your consent. 
If we feel that you r health or best interest would be at risk by you continuing to 
participate in the study, we will terminate your participation. You can stop participating 
in this study at any time. However, if you decide to stop participating in the study, we 
encourage yo u to talk to the researcher first.  
What Are The Risks of The Study?  
Some people feel uncomfortable answering questions about smoking or their health. You 
may choose to leave any question blank. There is a slight risk of discomfort, bruising, or 
infection with an IV blood draw.  
The products you will be using (hookah tobacco) have the same FDA warnings as 
cigarettes. Short term risks are relatively low. In the long -term, hookah use has been 
associated with increased risk for lung disease, heart disease, and lung and oral cancer.  
Reproductive Risks for Women and Men:  
Risks for females:    
If you are a female, you must not be  and should not become  pregnant nor breast -feed an 
infant while on this study. Taking the study drug(s), nicotine and tobacco products may 
cause birth defects and other harm to the fetus. There may be additional risks, which are 
currently unforeseeable. Due to these risks, women will complete a urine pregnancy test 
at the first visit.  
In order to reduce your risk of pregnancy, you or your par tner should use one or more of 
the acceptable methods of birth control listed below,  regularly and consistently, while 
you are in this study.  
Risks for males:  
In order to reduce the risk of getting someone pregnant, you or your partner should use 
one or mo re of the acceptable methods of birth control listed below , regularly and 
consistently, while you are in this study.  
Risks for both females and males:  
Acceptable methods of birth control continuing throughout the study include:  
o An approved oral contracepti ve (birth control pill)  
o Intra -uterine device (IUD) o Hormone implants   
o Contraceptive injection (Depo -Provera) o Barrier methods 
(diaphragm with spermicidal gel or condoms) o Transdermal 
contraceptives (birth control patch) o Vaginal contraception

hysterectomy or vasectomy)  
If you become pregnant or suspect that you are pregnant, or (for males) if you make 
someone pregnant during this study, you should immediately inform the study personnel.  
If you  become pregnant or suspect that you are pregnant while on this study,  tell a 
trained research staff immediately;  the trained research staff will perform a pregnancy 
test. If pregnancy is confirmed, you may be withdrawn from the study. A trained research  
staff will assist you in getting obstetrical care at your cost. The trained research staff and 
the Sponsor will follow the progress of your pregnancy and will request access to yours 
and/or your infant’s medical records for least eight weeks after deliver y.  Payment for all 
aspects of obstetrical, child, or related care will be your responsibility.

If you agree to take part in this study, there is no direct benefit to you. Through this study, 
we will learn about different smoking patterns when using different types of hookah 
products. This information may be used to inform future research and legislation 
associated with hookah tobacco.  
What Other Options Are There?  
Your participation in this study is voluntary. You can choose not to participate or 
withdraw from the study at any time.  
What about Confidentiality?

To help protect your privacy, a Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained from the 
federal government. This Certificate means that the researchers cannot be forced (for 
example by cour t subpoena) to share information that may identify you in any federal, 
state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. The 
researchers will use the Certificate to resist any demands for information that would 
identify yo u, except as explained below.  
The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the 
U.S. government that is used for checking or evaluating federally funded projects or for 
information that must be disclosed in order to me et the requirements of the federal Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA).  
The protection offered by the Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent us from 
being required by applicable state law to report information about suspected or known 
sexual, phys ical, or other abuse of a child or older person, or a subject’s threats of 
violence to self or others. If any member of the research team is given such information, 
he or she will be required to make a report to the appropriate authorities.   
The Certifica te, however, does not prevent you or a member of your family from 
voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this research. If 
an insurer, employer, or other person obtains your written consent to receive research 
information, then the researchers may not use the Certificate to withhold that information. 
This means that you and your family should actively protect your own privacy.  
If you are enrolled in the study after the expiration or termination of the Certificate, the 
prote ction afforded by the Certificate as described above will not apply.  
What Are the Costs?  
There is no cost to being in this study. All hookah products will be provided free of 
charge.  
Will I Be Paid For Participating in This Study?  
You will be paid $50 for  completing each study visit. You will also receive an additional 
$50 as a completion bonus on the final visit. The total you may receive for this study is

No funds have been set aside by The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, 
The Children’s Hospital at OU, or The Oklahoma Tobacco Research Center to 
compensate you in the event of illness or injury.

TITLE OF STUDY:  A Phase 2 Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical  Trial to 
Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy  of BMN 111 in Infants and Youn g Children with Achondroplasia, 
Age 0 to < 60 Months 
PROTOCOL NUMBER :  111-206 
STUDY SITES:  Approximately 10-15 sites worldwide 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  Phase 2 
STUDY RATIONALE: 
BMN 111 is a recombinant CNP analogue that has been engineered to resist degradation by NEP, 
allowing for a longer half-life. 
The pharmacological activity of BMN 111 was explored in two mou se models of ACH, a severe, 
Fgfr3Y367C/+ (TD) model ( Lorget, 2012 ), and a milder [Ach] /+ (Ach) model. These included studies 
in 7-day old TD mice given BMN 111 daily by SC administration f or up to 20 days and a study in 
3-week old Ach mice given BMN 111 daily by SC administration fo r 5 weeks. Partial or complete 
reversion of the ACH  phenotype was observed in these mouse mode ls after BMN 111 administration. 
In wild-type mice, and normal ra ts and monkeys, BMN 111 adminis tration resulted in growth plate 
expansion and dose-dependent skeletal growth at hemodynamically  tolerated dose levels 
(Wendt, 2015 ). Additionally, the potential effect of age on BMN 111 PK was evaluated in normal rats 
aged between 7 days and 12-13 weeks. 
Infants and young children with A CH have a high incidence of me dical complications and currently 
there is no approved pharmacological therapy for ACH in the US or EU. The most severe 
complication, cervicomedullary compression (CMC), occurs in a s ubset of subjects with ACH due to 
abnormal endochondral bone growth a nd narrowing of the foramen magnum ( White, 2016 ). CMC has 
been linked to serious respiratory and neurological complicatio ns including hypotonia, apnea, ataxia, 
developmental delay, and respirat ory arrest associated with sud den death ( Mukherjee, 2014 ). Foramen 
magnum decompression surgery is c urrently the only treatment fo r this condition.   
Sleep apnea has also been extensi vely described in ACH, and sle ep-disordered breathing may affect up 
to 85% of all children with ACH ( Ireland, 2012 ). This is thought to be due to midface hypoplasia, 
relative adenotonsillar hypertroph y, and potential posterior cr anial fossa compression secondary to 
abnormal endochondral bone growth . Sleep apnea in ACH not only results in the need for surgical 
intervention, but has also been linked to sudden death in rare cases ( Pauli, 1984 ).   
Similarly, the dysregulation of e ndochondral bone growth in ACH  leads to other medical

complications which are prevale nt in this subject population, s uch as the following: 
 Spinal stenosis, kyphosis, and lo rdosis (secondary to altered g rowth plate ossification in the 
vertebrae and narrowing of the interpedicular distances) ( Shirley, 2009 ) 
 Developmental delay of gross motor and ambulatory skills (assoc iated with proximal limb 
shortening, macrocephaly, and hypotonia) ( Ireland, 2010 ) 
 Delayed functional skills and increased need for caregiver assi stance (eg, eating, bladder 
management, bowel management, t ransfer to chair, climbing stair s) (Ireland, 2011 ) 
Thus, BMN 111 may provide greater benefit when children begin t reatment at a younger age, as earlier 
initiation of treatment allows a  longer time window to improve growth and potential to improve 
medical complications of achondroplasia. This study (111-206) i s being conducted to assess safety and 
the potential benefit of BMN 111 in infants and young children.    
BMN 111 was first tested in humans in Study 111-101, a Phase 1 double-blinded, placebo-controlled 
clinical trial of the safety and tolerability of BMN 111 in hea lthy adult male volunteers without ACH. 
Part 1 examined a series of si ngle subcutaneous doses (5 µg/kg,  10 µg/kg and 15 µg/kg), and Part 2 
included 10 days of either fixed  dosing or dose escalation (0.5  µg/kg to 8 µg/kg). BMN 111 was 
generally well tolerated at all doses. As expected, mild, trans ient, self-limited hypotension was 
reported (refer to current Investigators Brochure for additiona l information). Following SC 
administration, BMN 111 was rapidly absorbed with maximal plasm a concentrations achieved in less 
than 30 minutes. BMN 111 was rapidly cleared from the plasma wi th a mean t 1/2 ranging from 40 to 
55 minutes across dose levels. BMN 111 exposure (C max and AUC 0-t) generally increased greater than 
proportional to the increase in dose across the 2.5-to-15-µg/kg  dose range. Exposure following 
multiple dosing was found to be  similar to exposure following s ingle doses, indicating no apparent 
accumulation or time-dependence with once-daily SC administrati on. 
Study 111-202, the second clinical  trial in humans and the firs t in children with ACH, is an ongoing 
Phase 2, open-label, sequential- cohort, dose-escalation study t hat assesses daily SC BMN 111 in 
pediatric subjects with ACH age d 5-14 years with doses ranging from 2.5 µg/kg to 30 µg/kg. The 
primary objective of Study 111-202 is to evaluate the safety an d tolerability of BMN 111 administered 
for 6 months and up to 24 months; the secondary objectives are to determine change from baseline in 
annualized growth velocity (AGV), growth parameters, body propo rtions, and evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of BMN 111 in children with ACH. 
Analysis of safety data from the 6-month initial phase of Study  111-202 showed that treatment with 
BMN 111 for 6 months at the doses of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 µg/kg  was generally well tolerated (refer to 
current Investigator’s Brochure for specific details). One subj ect (30 µg/kg) in 111-202 withdrew due 
to an AE. The subject developed non-serious, asymptomatic Grade  1 intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-

White pattern, which was discovered on a routine day 10-study m onitoring ECG. The most common 
AEs across all cohorts were injection site reactions, asymptoma tic hypotension, headache, and 
nasopharyngitis. Based on previous experience of the ongoing Ph ase 2 clinical trial, including the 
24-month data cut at 15 µg/kg, i njection site reactions have be en identified as risks associated with 
BMN 111 injections. The majority of hypotension events were gra de 1 and reported in the setting of 
routine BP measurement. All reporte d events of hypotension were  transient and resolved without 
medical intervention. For a det ailed summary of risks, please r efer to the current version of the 
Investigator’s Brochure supplied by BioMarin.  
Analysis of efficacy data from the 6-month initial phase of Stu dy 111-202 showed that subjects treated 
with BMN 111 for 6 months at doses ranging from 2.5-15 µg/kg da ily had a dose-dependent 
improvement in AGV, with ~50% improvement in AGV seen at the 15  µg/kg dose. The data from 
Cohort 4 (30 µg/kg) show an appa rent greater than dose-proporti onal increase in BMN 111 plasma 
exposure (C max and AUC 0-t), with a marginal improvement i n both absolute AGV and change from 
baseline AGV after 6 months of BM N 111 treatment when compared with Cohort 3 (15 µg/kg).    
Study 111-206 is a Phase 2 random ized, double-blind, placebo-co ntrolled clinical trial of BMN 111 in 
infants and younger children with  a diagnosis of ACH who are 0 to < 60 months old. This 52-week 
study will enable assessment of BMN 111 efficacy and safety, to lerability, pharmacodynamics 
biomarkers, and PK in this populat ion. Additional exploratory e ndpoints pertaining to medical 
complications of ACH will also be evaluated.   
Efficacy/toxicity studies have b een conducted in neonatal and v ery young animals (7-day postpartum 
mouse and rat) in both a disease (TD mouse) and non-disease (ra t) model. Given that this is the first 
study in infants and young child ren, an age-based cohort study design is used to assess safety and PK 
in young children (Cohort 1, ≥ 24 to < 60 months) prior to dosi ng toddlers (Cohort 2, ≥ 6 
to < 24 months) and infants (Cohort 3, 0 to < 6 months). PK wil l be monitored and evaluated; Day 1 
PK data from the sentinel subjects will inform dose selection m odification for the sentinel subjects and 
for the rest of the cohort to target the observed exposure of t he 15-µg/kg dose group in Study 111-202. 
Safety, efficacy and PK data fro m Study 111-202, a Phase 2 stud y in children with ACH, where a dose 
of 15 µg/kg has been and conti nues to be studied, are expected to be the most relevant, and translatable 
to this study (111-206).    
OBJECTIVES:  
The primary objectives of the study are to: 
 Evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMN 111 in children age  0 to < 60 months with ACH

Approximately 70 subjects will be  enrolled at approximately 10- 15 clinical centers worldwide.   
The primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety a nd tolerability of daily SC BMN 111 
administered to infants and young children with ACH, and evalua te the effect of BMN 111 on 
length/height Z-score. Subjects w ill be enrolled into 3 age coh orts based on age at study screening 
starting with the eldest popula tion.  Within Cohorts 1 and 2, s ubjects will be stratified by age: 
 Cohort 1 – children aged ≥ 24 to < 60 months (n ≥ 30 total: 3 sentinel subjects who receive 
BMN 111, and at least 27 additiona l subjects randomized 1:1 to treatment or placebo control),  
stratified by age (≥ 24 to < 36 months and ≥ 36 months to < 60 months)  
 Cohort 2 – children aged ≥ 6 to < 24 months (n ≥ 20 total: 3 se ntinel subjects who receive 
BMN 111, and at least 17 additiona l subjects randomized 1:1 to treatment or placebo control), 
stratified by age (≥ 6 months t o < 15 months and ≥ 15 months to  < 24 months)  
 Cohort 3 – children aged 0 to < 6 months (n ≥ 20 total: 3 senti nel subjects who will be under 
observation or receive BMN 111, a nd at least 17 additional subj ects randomized 1:1 to 
treatment or placebo control).  Tr eatment begins at ≥ 3 months to  < 6 months after 3 months of 
observation. 
If subjects who enroll in Cohort 3 are not able to begin treatm ent by  < 6 months of age, they will 
continue in the pretreatment period for another 3 months before  enrolling in Cohort 2 to fulfill the 
pretreatment requirement for Cohort 2. 
Sentinel subjects from each cohort will be enrolled, treated wi th BMN 111, and studied for short-term 
safety and PK data, after which subjects will be randomized to receive BMN 111 or placebo SC daily 
(1:1 ratio) for up to 52 weeks.  
At the start of the study, three sentinel subjects will be enro lled and monitored in Cohort 1. After all 
3 sentinel subjects reach Day 8 , the Sponsor will review and ev aluate all available safety data and 
Day 1 PK data. Based on PK data review, the weight-based dose m ay be adjusted for the sentinel 
subjects and the rest of the cohort, and will be the starting d ose for the younger cohort sentinel 
subjects.  Upon review of the clin ical and PK data, the remaind er of Cohort 1 (≥ 27 additional 
subjects) will be enrolled and randomized to treatment with BMN  111 or placebo (1:1 ratio).  After the 
sentinel subjects complete 12 weeks of dosing, a DMC review wil l occur to evaluate all available 
safety and PK data.  Upon approval by the DMC, the next younger  cohort (Cohort 2) will be opened 
and the 3 sentinel subjects will be enrolled. 
The same procedure will be follo wed for Cohort 2. After all 3 s entinel subjects reach Day 8, the 
Sponsor will review and evaluate  all available safety data and Day 1 PK data. Based on PK data and 
criteria set in the protocol, the  dose may be adjusted for the sentinel subjects and the rest of the cohort, 
and will be the starting dose for the younger cohort sentinel s ubjects.  Upon review of the clinical and

PK data, the remainder of Cohort 3 (≥ 17 additional subjects) w ill be enrolled and randomized to 
treatment with BMN 111 or placebo (1:1 ratio).  
Cohort 3 subjects must have a mi nimum of 3 months of observatio n prior to commencement of 
treatment.  These subjects will have the option to enroll in ei ther 111-901 or 111-206, depending on 
age at enrollment: 
 Infants ≥ 3 months and  < 6 months old (≥ 13 weeks and  < 26 weeks) will enroll in 111-901 for 
a 6-month period of pretreatment growth assessment prior to enr ollment in 111-206 for 
treatment in Cohort 2. 
 Infants between birth and < 3 months old (0 weeks and < 13 weeks) will enroll into 111-206 
with a 3-month observational period prior to treatment. 
Additional sentinels may be added to any cohort if needed for a dditional safety and/or PK assessment. 
Duration of the study is 52 weeks of treatment with a safety fo llow up at Week 56. Following 
completion of the study, subject s in all treatment groups may b e eligible to receive BMN 111 in an 
open-label extension study, t o assess safety and efficacy of BM N 111 over the longer term.  
For subjects enrolling into the e xtension study, safety follow up visit at Week 56 will be waived.  
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) 
In addition to safety and PK mon itoring by BioMarin personnel, an independent DMC will act as an 
advisory body to BioMarin and will monitor the safety and PK of  subjects in the study. After the 
sentinel subjects complete 12 weeks of dosing, a DMC review wil l occur to evaluate all available 
safety and PK data.  Upon approval by the DMC, the next younger  cohort will be opened and the 
3 sentinel subjects will be enrolled. 
The DMC will make recommendations for stopping or continuing th e study on an individual subject 
level and/or on a cohort level per the pre-specified stopping c riteria. Based on criteria outlined in the 
protocol, the DMC may also make  endorsements for dose adjustmen ts if needed.

Individual Subject Stopping Criteria  
For individual subjects treated with BMN 111, DMC will be infor med if any of the following 
individual subject stopping criteria should occur. Temporary do sing suspension, permanent 
discontinuation of dosing, or dose reduction for the individual  subject will be considered. 
 Any treatment-emergent adverse ev ent (AE) assessed as at least Grade 4 by the Investigator 
and/or Sponsor Medical Monitor  
 Any treatment-emergent AE of at  least Grade 3 assessed as relat ed to study drug by the 
Investigator and/or Sponsor Medical Monitor  
 Any two treatment-emergent Grad e 2 symptomatic hypotension even ts within 7 days 
(non-urgent medical intervention indicated) or any Grade 3 hypo tensive event (urgent medical 
intervention or hospitalizati on indicated) assessed by the Inve stigator and/or Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor  
 Clinically significant finding or arrhythmia on ECG that indica tes abnormal cardiac function 
or conduction or prolongation of QTc-F >500 msec 
 Clinically significant new or worsening signs of cervicomedulla ry compression as determined 
by the Investigator and in consu ltation with Sponsor medical mo nitor and neurosurgical 
specialist (if needed) 
 Adverse findings on clinical hip exam or hip imaging assessment s that are determined to be 
clinically significant as determined by the Investigator and in  consultation with Sponsor 
Medical Monitor and orthopedic  specialist (if needed)  
If the subject meets any stopping criterion, after Investigator  consultation with the BioMarin Medical 
Monitor and DMC, the subject may  be re-challenged at the same d ose. If the subject meets stopping 
criteria on re-challenge or if r e-challenge is not clinically i ndicated, other options that may be 
considered include:  
 Permanent treatment discontinua tion (with an option of ongoing assessment in the study)  
Cohort Stopping Criteria  
For each cohort, a DMC review will be conducted if any of the f ollowing cohort stopping criteria 
occur in subjects treated with BMN 111.  Temporary dosing suspe nsion, permanent discontinuation of 
dosing, or dose reduction for th e cohort(s) will be considered and the impact on all other age cohorts 
will be assessed.

Dose Adjustments 
Analysis of available PK data from studies 111-101 and 111-202 indicated that differences in subject 
body weight did not directly tra nslate to differences in total body clearance of BMN 111.  The same 
weight-based dose in the pediatr ic population of Study 111-202 (5-12 years old) yielded lower 
exposure (C max and AUC) than that characterized in the adult population of St udy 111-101.  Therefore, 
the same weight-based dose in the  young pediatric population in  this study may yield exposure less 
than the target exposure range cha racterized to be safe and eff ective in Study 111-202 at the 15-µg/kg 
dose. Since this is the first experience with BMN 111 in this y oung pediatric population, it is also 
possible the exposure at 15 μg/kg could be greater than the tar get exposure range, and dose adjustment 
may be warranted. Thus, an option for adjustment of the weight- based dose is provided to ensure that 
the appropriate target exposure for safety and efficacy is reac hed for the young subj ects in this study.   
The need for dose adjustment w ill be evaluated as follows: thre e sentinel subjects in Cohort 1 will 
receive an initial dose of 15 µg/kg. After all three sentinel s ubjects reach Day 8, a review will occur to 
evaluate all available safety and PK data (at minimum). If the criteria for dose adjustment are met, the 
three sentinel subjects will be sta rted on the new adjusted dos e at their next scheduled visit, and vital 
signs will be obtained for at least 4 hours post-dose. 
The remainder of the subjects in the age cohort will also be en rolled starting at the new adjusted dose. 
After the third sentinel subject  reaches day 30 post dose adjus tment, a DMC review will occur to 
evaluate all safety and PK data and, upon endorsement, the thre e sentinel subjects from the next 
younger cohort will be enrolled st arting at the new adjusted do se.  The three sentinel subjects for the 
second and third cohorts will be evaluated similarly to the sen tinel subjects in the first cohort for 
potential dose adjustment.

Safety and Efficacy Monitoring 
Each treated subject will have expanded outpatient safety monit oring for a minimum of 3 days of 
dosing, during which they will be  closely observed and non-inva sive hemodynamic monitoring will be 
conducted for at least 4-8 hours post-dosing. Because younger c hildren may not be able to verbalize 
complaints of dizziness or lightheadedness that are potentially  associated with hypotension, study 
personnel and caregivers will be trained to recognize the signs  of hypotension in this population, which 
may include tachycardia, pallor, diaphoresis, lethargy, delayed  capillary refill, and poor feeding. 
Appropriate rigorous training w ill be required for parents and caregivers prior to daily injections at 
home. Training includes the storage, reconstitution, and admini stration of BMN 111, as well as 
documentation/reporting of AEs and vigilance for signs of hypot ension. 
It is generally expected that after subjects are tolerating the  drug well and specified criteria have been 
met, caregivers will begin administering study drug. Home healt h care is not required at any point but 
may be provided if the caregiver is unable or unavailable to ad minister the study drug. A Home 
Healthcare nurse will train the car egiver(s) if training has no t been completed by the Day 3 visit. A 
phone call by the study staff mem ber to the caregiver will be r equired weekly for 6 months and then 
every 2 weeks for the remainde r of the study. During these cont acts, study staff will ask the caregiver 
about dose administration and seek information on AEs and SAEs by specific questioning. If the 
caregiver cannot be contacted by phone after two attempts, cont act can be made via email.   
Safety will be evaluated by the incidence of AEs, serious AEs ( SAEs), laboratory test results 
(urinalysis, chemistry, and hematology), vital signs, physical examination, ECG and echocardiogram, 
hip clinical assessment, and anti-BMN 111 immunogenicity assess ments.  Clinical laboratory tests, 
PK, immunogenicity and blood bioma rker assessments will be limi ted to the minimum necessary for 
evaluation of safety and efficacy  in order to minimize blood vo lume in the pediatric population. 
Efficacy will be assessed by change  from baseline in AGV and le ngth/height Z-score. Exploratory 
assessments will include change fro m baseline in growth paramet ers and body proportions by 
anthropometry. X-rays will be performed of the lower extremitie s and spine to evaluate for changes in 
bone morphology, quality, and grow th. An MRI will be performed to assess the effect of BMN 111 on 
skull and brain morphology, inc luding foramen magnum, ventricul ar and brain parenchymal 
dimensions.  A board-certified, f ellowship-trained (or equivale nt) pediatric anesthesiologist will 
administer anesthesia during MRI measurements in the event that  the subject is unable to remain still 
for the duration of the scan. Sl eep studies will be conducted t o evaluate sleep apnea. Additional 
assessments will be conducted to ev aluate changes from baseline  in bone metabolism and BMN111 
pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and de velopmental/functional status .   
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS  PLANNED : Approximately 70 subjects, inc luding at least 30 subjects in 
Cohort 1, at least 20 subjects in Cohort 2, and at least 20 sub jects in Cohort 3.

7 INTRODUCTION 
BMN 111 is a proposed pharmacologi c therapeutic option for ACH,  the most common form 
of dwarfism. 
ACH is a rare disease with a  prevalence of 1/25000 in the US ( Wynn, 2007)  The average 
adult heights for men and women with ACH are 131 cm and 124 cm,  respectively ( NIH, 
Genetics Home Reference, 2012 ).  Characteristic features i nclude long and narrow trunk, a 
large head with frontal bossing, hypoplasia of the mid-face, bo wed legs and stenosis of the 
foramen and spinal canals that can be life-threatening. Foramen  magnum stenosis can lead to 
cervicomedullary compression in i nfants with complications incl uding hydrocephalus, 
hypotonia, respiratory insufficien cy, apnea, cyanotic episodes,  feeding problems, 
quadriparesis, and sudden death.  
There is no approved pharmacologi cal therapy for achondroplasia  in the US or EU. Current 
treatments for achondroplasia are focused on neurosurgical inte rventions for foramen 
magnum stenosis or lumbar stenos is, thoracolumbar braces to hel p ameliorate the kyphosis, 
or limb lengthening requiring multiple operations over 2 to 3 y ears (Shirley, 2009), 
(Horton, 2007 ).  
ACH is caused by a gain-of-functi on mutation in FGFR3, a negati ve regulator of 
chondrocyte proliferation and di fferentiation.  The most common  mutation (98%) in ACH 
patients is a G380R substitution in the transmembrane domain of  FGFR3.  The majority of 
new cases (80%) originate from pa rents with normal stature.   
The extracellular signal-regulat ed kinase (ERK) mitogen-activat ed protein kinase (MAPK) 
pathway mediates part of FGFR 3 inhibition of chondrocyte prolif eration and differentiation 
(Foldynova-Trantirkova, 2012 ).  The ERK MAPK pathway is modulated by CNP, a positive 
regulator of chondrocyte prolif eration and differentiation.  Bi nding of CNP to the Natriuretic 
Peptide-Receptor B (NPR-B) ant agonizes FGFR3 downstream signali ng by inhibiting the 
MAPK (ERK1/2) pathway at the level of RAF-1 ( Krejci, 2005. ); (Yasoda, 2004. ); 
(Yasoda, 2009 ); (Pejchalova, 2007 ).  This crosstalk was demons trated in a mouse model of 
FGFR3-related chondrodysplasia  (Yasoda, 2004); (Yasoda, 2009).  The dwarfism phenotype 
of mice harboring the FGFR3G380R  mutation was rescued by expres sion of CNP in cartilage 
or by the continuous administr ation of CNP (infusion). 
CNP is a member of the natriure tic peptide (NP) family that inc ludes Atrial Natriuretic 
Peptide (ANP) and B-type Natriure tic Peptide (BNP). These pepti des are structurally related 
but are distinct paracr ine/autocrine (CNP) or endocrine (ANP an d BNP) factors that regulate

the cardiovascular (CV), skele tal, nervous, reproductive and ot her systems. Synthetic analogs 
of ANP (anaritide and carperitide)  and BNP (nesiritide) have be en investigated as potential 
therapies for the treatment of decompensated heart failure and cardiovascular-related 
diseases. 
BMN 111 is a 39-amino acid CNP a nalogue harboring the 37 amino acids of the human 
CNP53 C-terminal sequence a nd modified by the addition of two a mino acids (Pro-Gly) on 
the N-terminus.  It is a recomb inant human peptide fused to hum an transcription factor 
(TAF) and expressed as an i nclusion body in E. coli.  BMN 111 i s liberated and solubilized 
from the TAF-fusion protein by for mic acid cleavage, and purifi ed by column 
chromatography ( Long, 2012 ).  BMN 111 was designed to 1) mi mic CNP activities in terms 
of receptor binding and pharmacological activity and 2) be resi stant to neutral endopeptidase 
(NEP) digestion in order to have  an extended half-life in compa rison to CNP that is 
presumed to increase exposure to the target  growth plate ( Wendt, 2015 ).  
A comprehensive review of BMN 11 1 is contained in the current v ersion of the Investigator’s 
Brochure supplied by BioMarin.  Inve stigators are required to r eview the Investigator’s 
Brochure prior to ini tiating this study. 
7.1 Nonclinical Studies 
The pharmacological activity of BMN 111 was explored in two mou se models of ACH, a 
severe, Fgfr3Y367C/+ model ( Lorget, 2012 ), and a mild [Ach] /+ m odel.  Partial or complete 
reversion of the ACH phenotype w as observed in these mouse mode ls after BMN 111  
administration.  Additionally, in wild-type mice, and normal ra ts and monkeys, BMN 111 
administration resulted in growt h plate expansion and dose-depe ndent skeletal growth at 
hemodynamically tolerated dose levels (Wendt, 2015).  
BMN 111-related adverse findings  in nonclinical species (mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys) 
were limited to the known mechan ism of action of CNP on the gro wth plate and vasculature.  
Reversible subcutaneous injecti on site reactions were reported,  including injection site 
discoloration and microscopic fi ndings of perivascular mononucl ear cell infiltrates that were 
seen with slightly higher incid ence and severity in BMN 111-tre ated rats and monkeys 
compared to the vehicle control .  Adverse skeletal changes asso ciated with exaggerated 
growth were seen in normal nonc linical species with open growth  plates, and were dose-, 
exposure- and time-dependent. D ecreases in blood pressure and c ompensatory increases in 
heart rate were detected in monke ys across multiple studies, wi th overt CV-related clinical 
signs observed in some animals at doses ≥ 236 µg/kg. These over t clinical signs consisted of 
transient, short and repeated bouts of sternal or lateral recum bency and/or reduced motor

activity, typically w ithin 1-hour post-dose administration.  Ad ditional detailed information 
about nonclinical studies of BMN  111 is provided in the current  version of the I nvestigator’s 
Brochure supplied by BioMarin.   
7.2 Previous Clinical Studies 
7.2.1 Study 111-101 
Study 111-101, “A Phase 1, Two Part, Double Blind, Placebo-Cont rolled Study to Evaluate 
the Safety, Tolerability, and P harmacokinetics of Single and Mu ltiple Doses of BMN 111 
Administered to Healthy Adult Vo lunteers,” was a first-in-human  study conducted in 2 parts 
to allow for assessment of the s afety, tolerability, and PK of BMN 111 administered as a 
single dose and as a multiple dose to healthy adult male volunt eers. 
Doses ranging from 5.0 µg/kg to 15. 0 µg/kg were administered as  a single daily SC dose; 
doses ranging from 0.5 µg/kg to 8.0 µg/kg were administered in the multiple ascending dose 
segment of the study. As expected, mild, transient, self-limite d hypotension occurred. 
The majority of these cases w ere asymptomatic and observed upon  assumption of an upright 
posture following recumbence. Hypot ension events were reported in the BMN 111 treatment 
groups with higher frequency com pared with placebo. All events were judged to be mild in 
severity and resolved spontane ously without an intervention. Th ese events occurred across 
dose ranges.  Due to the limite d number of events at each dose,  it is unclear if symptomatic 
hypotension is dose related.  No dose limiting toxicities were identified outside of these 
cardiovascular events. The only A Es occurring in more than one subject receiving BMN 111 
were orthostatic hypotension, contact dermatitis, and back pain , and injection site reactions. 
Most AEs in the study were of mild severity, and no SAEs were r eported. There were no AEs 
that led to premature di scontinuation of study drug.   
The PK parameters for BMN 111 wer e obtained from Part 1 of the study and from the first 
dose on Day 1 of the multiple dose study in Part 2. The results  demonstrate that BMN 111 
was rapidly absorbed in human, reaching a mean time to peak con centration (T max) between 
15-26 minutes. After reaching maximal plasma concentrations, BM N 111 levels rapidly 
declined, with a t 1/2 of 40-55 minutes. Mean plasma concentration-time profiles indi cate that 
exposure increased with dose fr om 2.5 to 15 µg/kg. The correspo nding increases in plasma 
Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) e xposure parameters were greate r than dose 
proportional. The increase in C max with dose was linear over th e dose range evaluated.  
In Part 2, with multiple dosing at 5 µg/kg for 10 days, the pla sma concentration-time curves 
obtained on each of the three sampling days were nearly superim posable. Comparison of PK 
exposure parameters for AUC and C max indicate that C max is unchanged and AUC is

Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
increased slightly by +33% over Day 1.  Overall the results ind icate that changes in 
BMN 111 exposure are minimal w ith repeat dosing out to 10 days.  
7.3 Ongoing Clinical Studies 
7.3.1 Study 111-901 
Study 111-901 is a multicenter, mu ltinational study to collect serial growth measurements on 
pediatric subjects w ith ACH who are being considered for subseq uent enrollment in future 
studies sponsored by BioMarin. To o btain accurate baseline meas urements, at least 6 months 
of growth data are collected.  
Data gathered from this study are  used to characterize baseline  growth data in children or 
infants (defined as children <  2 years of age) who may subseque ntly be enrolled in future 
studies sponsored by BioMarin, and may also be used to establis h historical control cohort 
for use in other BioMarin-spons ored studies, when appropriate. For that reason, data related 
to ACH symptoms, tests, and i nterventions are collected. 
7.3.2 Study 111-202 
Study 111-202 is an ongoing Phase 2, ope n-label, sequential coh ort, dose escalation study 
that assesses daily SC administ ration of BMN 111 in pediatric s ubjects with ACH. 
The primary objective of Study 111- 202 is to evaluate the safet y and tolerability of BMN 111 
administered for 6 months and up t o 24 months; the secondary ob jectives are to determine 
change from baseline in annua lized growth velocity (AGV), growt h parameters, body 
proportions, and evaluate the dos e-exposure and PK profiles of BMN 111 in children with 
ACH.  
Analysis of safety data from the  6-month initial phase of Study  111-202 showed that 
treatment with BMN 111 for 6 months at dose cohorts of 2.5, 7.5 , 15, and 30 µg/kg 
(Cohorts 1 to 4, respectively) was  generally well tolerated. Th e most common AEs were mild 
injection site reac tions, asymptomatic hypotension, headache, a nd nasopharyngitis. For a 
detailed summary of risks, pleas e refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure 
supplied by BioMarin.  
Analysis of efficacy data from th e 6-month initial phase of Stu dy 111-202 demonstrated that 
the mean (standard deviation) c hange from baseline AGV when BMN  111 is administered at 
2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 µg/kg subcutaneously daily for 6 months is  -0.37 (1.592), 1.28 (1.439), 
2.01 (1.999), and 2.08 (2.137) cm/year , respectively.  Thus, a positive dose-dependent 
response was observed in change  from baseline AGV at doses rang ing from 2.5-15 µg/kg 
daily.

Study 111-205 is an ongoing open-labe l, Phase 2 extension study  to assess long-term safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of BMN 11 1 in children with ACH. Sub jects continue receiving the 
same stable dose of BMN 111 received upon completion of the 111 -202 study (up to 
30 µg/kg daily). This 5-year study allows for long-term assessm ent of the effect of daily 
BMN 111 administration on safety, tolerability, growth velocity , height, and body 
proportions in subject completi ng 2 years of BMN 111 treatment in Study 111-202 (7 years 
total BMN 111 treatment duration) . Additional exploratory endpo ints are being examined to 
determine long-term effects of BMN 111 on bone physiology and t he medical complications 
of ACH. 
7.3.4 Study 111-301 
Study 111-301 is an ongoing Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-cont rolled multicenter study to 
further characterize and conf irm efficacy and safety of BMN 111  at 15 µg/kg in a 58-week 
study (up to 4 weeks of screening, 52  weeks of treatment, plus an additional 2 weeks of 
safety follow up). The study asse sses the effect of daily BMN 1 11 administration on change 
from baseline in AGV, height , and body proportions in subjects treated with BMN 111 
compared with control subjects in the placebo group; and furthe r characterizes safety and 
tolerability of BMN 111 in childre n with ACH. Additional explor atory endpoints are being 
examined to determine the effect of BMN 111 on bone physiology and to assess quality of 
life and daily function of study subjects. 
7.4 Study Rationale 
BMN 111 is a recombinant CNP analogue that has been engineered to resist degradation by 
NEP, allowing for a longer half-life. 
The pharmacological activity of BMN 111 was explored in two mou se models of ACH, a 
severe, Fgfr3Y367C/+ (TD) model ( Lorget, 2012 ), and a milder [Ach] /+ (Ach) model. These 
included studies in 7-day ol d TD mice given BMN 111 daily by SC  administration for up to 
20 days and a study in 3 week old A ch mice given BMN 111 daily by SC administration for 
5 weeks. Partial or complete re version of the ACH phenotype was  observed in these mouse 
models after BMN 111 administr ation. In wild-type mice, and nor mal rats and monkeys, 
BMN 111 administration resulted i n growth plate expansion and d ose-dependent skeletal 
growth at hemodynamically tolerated dose levels ( Wendt, 2015 ). Additionally, the potential

Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
effect of age on BMN 111 PK was ev aluated in normal rats aged b etween 7 days and 
12-13 weeks. 
Infants and young children with ACH  have a high incidence of me dical complications and 
currently there is no approved pha rmacological therapy for ACH in the US or EU. The most 
severe complication, cervicomedu llary compression (CMC), occurs  in a subset of subjects 
with ACH due to abnormal endoc hondral bone growth and narrowing  of the foramen 
magnum ( White, 2016 ). CMC has been linked to seri ous respiratory and neurological 
complications including hypotonia,  apnea, ataxia, developmental  delay, and respiratory arrest 
associated with sudden death ( Mukherjee, 2014 ). Foramen magnum decompression surgery 
is currently the only treat ment for this condition.   
Sleep apnea has also been exten sively described in ACH, and sle ep-disordered breathing may 
affect up to 85% of all children with ACH ( Ireland, 2012 ). This is thought to be due to 
midface hypoplasia, relative adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and po tential posterior cranial fossa 
compression secondary to abnormal endochondral bone growth. Sle ep apnea in ACH not 
only results in the need for sur gical intervention, but has als o been linked to sudden death in 
rare cases ( Pauli, 1984 ).   
Similarly, the dysregulation of e ndochondral bone growth in ACH  leads to other medical 
complications which are prevalen t in this subj ect population, s uch as the following: 
 Spinal stenosis, kyphosis, and lor dosis (secondary to altered g rowth plate ossification 
in the vertebrae and na rrowing of the interpe dicular distances)  (Shirley, 2009 ) 
 Developmental delay of gross moto r and ambulatory skills (assoc iated with proximal 
limb shortening, macrocephaly, and hypotonia) ( Ireland, 2010 ) 
 Delayed functional skills and incr eased need for caregiver assi stance (eg, eating, 
bladder management, bowel management, transfer to chair, climbi ng stairs) 
(Ireland, 2011 ) 
Thus, BMN 111 may provide greater benefit when children begin t reatment at a younger age, 
as earlier initiati on of treatment allows  a longer time window to improve growth and 
potential to improve medical com plications of achondroplasia. T his study (111-206) is being 
conducted to assess safety and the  potential benefit of BMN 111  in infants and young 
children.   
BioMarin has engineered a CNP a nalog (BMN 111) that has a longe r half-life than 
endogenous CNP, thereby allowing daily SC administration. Simil ar to CNP, BMN 111 
activates NPR-B signaling with s ubsequent inhibition of FGFR3 d ownstream signaling, 
leading to the promotion of chondr ocyte prolifer ation and diffe rentiation and subsequent 
 Study 111-206 Page 36

increased endochondral bone for mation. BMN 111 administration h as been shown to 
promote endochondral bone formati on at hemodynamically tolerate d dose levels in both 
normal animals and mouse models of ACH reported (refer to curre nt Investigator’s Brochure 
for additional information). 
Human studies to date have als o demonstrated that BMN 111 is ge nerally well tolerated at 
doses that result in improvement s in growth velocity approachin g that of children of average 
stature. 
Study 111-202 is an ongoing Phase 2, ope n-label, sequential coh ort, dose escalation study 
that assesses daily SC administ ration of BMN 111 in pediatric s ubjects with ACH, in which 
the primary objective is to evalu ate the safety and tolerabilit y of BMN 111 administered for 
6 months and up to 24 months and inc ludes secondary objectives consisting of determination 
of change from baseline in AGV, growth parameters, body proport ions, and evaluation of the 
dose-exposure and PK profiles  of BMN 111 in children with ACH.  
Analysis of safety data from the  6-month initial phase of Study  111-202 showed that 
treatment with BMN 111 was genera lly well tolerated at all dose  levels (refer to current 
Investigators Brochure for specific details).  
Analysis of efficacy data fro m Study 111-202 demonstrated that that subjects given 
BMN 111 at the dose of 15 µg/kg daily had an improvement in AGV , with approximately 
~50% increase over baseline see n with treatment for 6 months wh ich was sustained after 
continued treatment for 12 months.  
Subjects treated with 30 µg/kg da ily also showed similar improv ement in mean AGV after 
6 months and their mean changes from baseline in AGV were simil ar to subjects treated with 
15 µg/kg daily. Safety data for the  30-µg/kg daily dose was als o similar to the 15-µg/kg daily 
dose.  Given that no clinically s ignificant difference could be  identified between the 
15-µg/kg and 30-µg/kg daily dose in  the Phase 2, 6-month safety  and efficacy data, the lower 
of the two doses has been chos en for this Phase 2 study.  
Study 111-206 is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-co ntrolled clini cal trial of 
BMN 111 in infants and younger children with a diagnosis of ACH  who are age 0 to 
< 60 months. This 52-week study wil l enable assessment of BMN 1 11 safety, tolerability, 
pharmacodynamics biomarkers, and PK in this population, and als o allow for examination of 
potential impact on efficacy endpoi nts. Additional exploratory endpoints pertaining to 
medical complications of ACH will also be evaluated.

7.5 Summary of Overall Risks and Benefits 
7.5.1 Summary of Risks from Nonclinical Studies 
Individuals in this study will be exposed to a recombinant anal ogue of human C-type 
natriuretic peptide (C NP). Based on the results of experimentat ion in animals, the most 
relevant potential toxicities r elate to the expected pharmacolo gical effects of exogenous CNP 
administration, including hemodynami c changes, skeletal overgro wth, and injection site 
reactions. Transient and sporad ic decreases in blood pressure a nd compensating increases in 
heart rate occurred within the f irst hour post-dose in cynomolg us monkeys; the effects were 
mainly asymptomatic with a s ubset of animals given doses ≥ 236 µg/kg observed with 
symptomatic effects consisting of  transient, short and repeated  bouts of sternal or lateral 
recumbency and/or reduced motor activity. These hemodynamic eff ects can be monitored, 
but have the potential to be an acute dose-limiting factor in p atients.  Exaggerated 
appendicular bone responses to t he drug included abnormally sha ped femoral head, 
acetabular growth center/plate dys plasia and concomitant articu lar cartilage degeneration 
with clinical manifestations of  restricted use of hips. Adverse  skeletal changes associated 
with exaggerated growth were dos e-, exposure- and time-dependen t. Additional detailed 
information about risks identifie d in nonclinical  studies of BM N 111 is provided in the 
current version of the Investigat or’s Brochure supplied by BioM arin.   
7.5.2 Summary of Risks from Clinical Studies 
7.5.2.1  Study 111-101 
Based on review of the first-i n-human Phase 1 study of BMN 111 in healthy adult volunteers, 
Study 111-101, BMN 111 administered S C daily was well tolerated  with doses ranging from 
0.5 µg/kg to 15 µg/kg. All AEs were  of mild severity, and no SA Es were reported. The most 
common AE was mild, transient, s elf-limited orthostatic hypoten sion, of which the majority 
of cases were asymptoma tic and observed only upon assumption of  an upright posture 
following recumbence. No dose-limiting toxicities were identifi ed outside of these CV 
events. 
7.5.2.2  Ongoing Studies 
Based on analysis of safety data from ongoing phase 2 and 3 stu dies, treatment with 
BMN 111 was generally well tolera ted. Injection site reactions were the most common 
adverse events reported and are  considered to be an identified risk. All injection site reactions 
events have been reported as non- serious, Grade 1 in severity, and transient. Hypotension and 
hypersensitivity reactions including development of BMN 111 ant ibodies are potential risks

associated with BMN 111 injections . For a detailed summary of r isks, please refer to the 
current version of the Investigat or’s Brochure supplied by BioM arin. 
7.5.3 Summary of Potential Benefits from Clinical Studies 
For children with ACH who will receive BMN 111  as part of Study 111-206, potential 
benefits may include improvement  of AGV rates suc h that their i ncrease in growth velocity 
may approach that of children of average stature.  Additional p otential benefits may include 
improvement of the disproportiona te growth as well as improveme nt in quality of life, 
activities of daily liv ing, and medical complications of ACH.  For example, improvement in 
height could have an impact on da ily activity performance.

9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a Phase 2 randomized, doub le-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of BMN 111 in 
infants and younger children with a diagnosis of ACH.  
Subjects age  ≥ 3 months to < 60 months old who have documented ACH confirmed b y 
genetic testing, at least a 6- month period of pretreatment grow th assessment in Study 
111-901 immediately before study entry and who meet the study e ligibility criteria will 
participate. Eligible subjects ranging from 0 months to  < 3 months old may enroll directly 
into 111-206 and have a minimum of  3 months of pre-treatment ob servation prior to 
commencing treatment. 
Approximately 70 subjects will be  enrolled at approximately 10- 15 clinical centers 
worldwide.   
The primary objectives of this s tudy are to assess the safety a nd tolerability of daily SC 
BMN 111 administered to infan ts and young children with ACH, an d evaluate the effect of 
BMN 111 on Z-scores. Subjects w ill be enrolled into 3 age cohor ts based on age at study 
screening starting with the eld est population. Within Cohorts 1  and 2, subjects will be 
stratified by age: 
 Cohort 1 – children aged ≥ 24 to <  60 months (n ≥ 30 total: 3 s entinel subjects who 
receive BMN 111, and at least 27 additional subjects randomized  1:1 to treatment or 
placebo control), stratified by a ge (≥ 24 to < 36 months and ≥ 36 months to 
< 60 months)  
 Cohort 2 – children aged  ≥  6 t o   < 24 months (n ≥ 20 total: 3 sentinel subjects who 
receive BMN 111, and at least 17 additional subjects randomized  1:1 to treatment or 
placebo control), str atified by age (≥ 6 m onths to < 15 months and ≥ 15 months to 
< 24 months)  
 Cohort 3 – children aged 0 to < 6 m onths (n ≥ 20 total: 3 senti nel subjects who 
receive BMN 111, and at least 20 additional subjects randomized  1:1 to treatment or 
placebo control).  Treatment be gins at ≥ 3 months to < 6 months  after 3 months of 
observation. 
If subjects who enroll in Cohort  3 are not able to begin treatm ent by  < 6 months of age, they 
will continue in the pretreatment period for another 3 months b efore enrolling in Cohort 2 to 
fulfill the pretreatment requirement for Cohort 2.

Sentinel subjects from each cohort will be enrolled and studied  for short-term safety and PK 
data, after which subjects in all  3 cohorts will be randomized to receive BMN 111 or placebo 
SC daily (1:1 ratio) for up to 52 w eeks. At the start of the st udy, 3 sentinel subjects will be 
enrolled and monitored in Cohor t 1. After all 3 sentinel subjec ts reach Day 8, the Sponsor 
will review and evaluate all available safety data and Day 1 PK  data. Based on PK data and 
criteria set in the protocol, t he dose may be adjusted for the sentinel subjects and the rest of 
the cohort, and will be the starting dose for the younger cohor t sentinel subjects.  Upon 
review of the clinical and PK  data, the remainder of Cohort 1 ( ≥ 27 additional subjects) will 
be enrolled and randomized t o treatment with BMN 111 or placebo  (1:1 ratio).  After the 
sentinel subjects complete 12 w eeks of dosing, a DMC review wil l occur to evaluate all 
available safety and PK data .  Upon approval by the DMC, the ne xt younger cohort 
(Cohort 2) will be opened and the 3 sentinel subjects will be e nrolled. 
The same procedure will be followed for Cohort 2. After all 3 s entinel subjects reach Day 8, 
the Sponsor will review and evaluate all available safety data and Day 1 PK data. Based on 
PK data and criteria set in the  protocol, the dose may be adjus ted for the sentinel subjects and 
the rest of the cohort, and will be the starting dose for the y ounger cohort sen tinel subjects.  
Upon review of the clinical and P K data, the remainder of Cohor t 2 (≥ 17 additional subjects) 
will be enrolled and randomize d to treatment with BMN 111 or pl acebo (1:1 ratio). After the 
sentinel subjects complete 12 w eeks of dosing, a DMC review wil l occur to evaluate all 
available safety and PK data .  Upon approval by the DMC, the yo ungest cohort (Cohort 3) 
will be opened and the 3 sentinel s ubjects will be enrolled.  
The same procedure will be followed for Cohort 3. After all 3 s entinel subjects reach Day 8, 
the Sponsor will review and evaluate all available safety data and Day 1 PK data. Based on 
PK data and criteria set in the  protocol, the dose may be adjus ted for the sentinel subjects and 
the rest of the cohort, and will be the starting dose for the y ounger cohort sen tinel subjects.  
Upon review of the clinical and P K data, the remainder of Cohor t 3 (≥ 17 additional subjects) 
will be enrolled and randomize d to treatment with BMN 111 or pl acebo (1:1 ratio).  
Cohort 3 subjects must have a min imum of 3 months of observatio n prior to commencement 
of treatment.  These subjects wi ll have the option to enroll in  either 111-901 or 111-206, 
depending on age at enrollment: 
 Infants ≥ 3 months and  < 6 mont hs old (≥ 13 weeks and < 26 wee ks) will enroll in 
111 901 for a 6-month period of pretr eatment growth assessment prior to enrollment 
in 111 206 for treatment in Cohort 2. 
 Infants between birth and < 3 months old (0 weeks and < 13 week s) will enroll into 
111 206 with a 3-month observational  period prior to treatment.  
 Study 111-206 Page 42 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
Additional sentinels may be adde d to any cohort if needed for a dditional safety and/or PK 
assessment. 
Each treated subject will have e xpanded outpatient safety monit oring for a minimum of 
3 days of dosing, during which they will be closely observed an d non-invasive hemodynamic 
monitoring will be conducted for  at least 4-8 hours post-dosing . Because younger children 
may not be able to verbalize comp laints of dizziness or lighthe adedness that are potentially 
associated with hypotension, study p ersonnel and caregivers wil l be trained to recognize the 
signs of hypotension in this populat ion, which may include tach ycardia, pallor, diaphoresis, 
lethargy, delayed capillary ref ill, and poor feeding. Appropria te rigorous training will be 
required for parents and caregiver s prior to daily injections a t home. Traini ng includes the 
storage, reconstitution, and administration of BMN 111, as well  as documentation/reporting 
of AEs and vigilance for signs of hypotension. 
It is generally expected that af ter subjects are tolerating the  drug well and sp ecified criteria 
have been met, caregivers will  begin administering study drug. Home health care is not 
required at any point but may be prov ided if the caregiver is u nable or unavailable to 
administer the study drug. A Home Healthcare nurse will train t he caregiver(s) if training has 
not been completed by the Day 3 vi sit. A phone call by the stud y staff member to the 
caregiver will be required week ly for 6 months and then every 2  weeks for the remainder of 
the study. During these contacts, study staff will ask the care giver about dose administration 
and seek information on AEs and SAEs by specific questioning. I f the caregiver cannot be 
contacted by phone after two atte mpts, contact can be made via email.   
Duration of the study is 52 weeks  of treatment with a safety fo llow up at Week 56. Following 
completion of the study, subjects  in all treatments groups may be eligible to receive 
BMN 111 in an open-label extensi on study, to assess safety and efficacy of BMN 111 over 
the longer term.  For subjects enrolling into the extension stu dy, safety follow up visit at 
Week 56 will be waived.

9.1.1 Dose Adjustments 
Analysis of available PK da ta from studies 111-101 and 111-202 indicated that differences in 
subject body weight did not direct ly translate to differences i n total body clearance of 
BMN 111.  The same weight-based dose in the pediatric populatio n of Study 111-202 
(5-12 years old) yielded lower exposure (C max and AUC) than that char acterized in the adult 
population of Study 111-101.  Therefore , the same weight-based dose in the young pediatric 
population in this study may yield e xposure less than the targe t exposure range characterized 
to be safe and effective i n Study 111-202 at the 15-µg/kg dose.  Since this is the first 
experience with BMN 111 in this young pediatric population, it is also possible the exposure 
at 15 μg/kg could be greater than t he target exposure range, an d dose adjustment may be 
warranted. Thus, an option for adjus tment of the weight-based d ose is provided to ensure that 
the appropriate target exposure for safety and efficacy is reac hed for the young subjects in 
this study.   
The need for dose adjustment will be evaluated as follows: thre e sentinel subjects in Cohort 1 
will receive an initial dose of  15 µg/kg. After all three senti nel subjects reach Day 8, the 
Sponsor will review and evaluate  all available safety and PK da ta (at minimum). If the 
criteria for dose adjustment a re met, the three sentinel subjec ts will be started on the new 
adjusted dose at their next sche duled visit, and vital signs wi ll be obtained for at least 4 hours 
post-dose. 
The remainder of the subjects in the age cohort will also be en rolled starting at the new 
adjusted dose. After the thir d sentinel subject reaches day 30 post dose adjustment, a DMC 
review will occur to evaluat e all safety and PK data and, upon endorsement, the three 
sentinel subjects from the next younger cohort will be enrolled  starting at the new adjusted 
dose.  The three sentinel subjec ts for the second and third coh orts will be evaluated similarly 
to the sentinel subject s in the first cohort for potential dose  adjustment. 
Criteria for Dose Adjustment 
The criteria for dose adjustme nt are based on obtaining equival ent exposure characterized to 
be safe and effective wit h the 15-μg/kg dose in Study 111-202 i n each of the age cohorts 
evaluated in this study. BMN 111 dos e may be adjusted if the me an observed AUC 0-120 from 
sentinel subjects is less than the 25th percentile for AUC 0-120 in Cohort 3 (15 μg/kg) of Study 
111-202 or greater than the 75th pe rcentile in Cohort 3 of Stud y 111-202. If these criteria are 
met, an allometric scaling coeffi cient, α, for BMN 111 clearanc e by subject body weight will 
be determined using a population PK modelling approach and avai lable data from this study 
 Study 111-206 Page 52 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
and Studies 111-202 and 111-101. The  recommended adjusted dose will be determined using 
the following expression: 
  
where WT ref and Dose ref are the typical (i.e., median)  subject body weight and total d ose, 
respectively, at the 15 μg/kg dos e level in Cohort 3 of Study 1 11-202, and WT ch is the 
anticipated median weight in the  age cohort being studied. As s uch, the recommended 
adjusted dose will target the median AUC 0-120 observed at the 15 μg/kg dose level of Study 
111-202. The recommended adjusted dose, Dose ch, will be normalized by WT ch, to provide 
the recommended adjusted weight-b ased dose. The following rules  will be used for dose 
adjustment: 
 A maximum of a 2-fold increase in dose/kg will be permitted bet ween dose 
adjustments regardless of exposure. 
 The total dose will not exceed the  highest total dose administe red in Study 111-202. 
9.1.2 Stopping Criteria 
Individual Subject Sto pping Criteria  
For individual subjects treat ed with BMN 111, DMC will be infor med if any of the following 
individual subject stopping cr iteria should occur. Temporary do sing suspension, permanent 
discontinuation of dosing, or dose reduction for the individual  subject will be considered. 
 Any treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) assessed as at least Grade 4 by the 
Investigator and/or Sponsor Medical Monitor  
 Any treatment-emergent AE of at least Grade 3 assessed as relat ed to study drug by 
the Investigator and/or Sponsor Medical Monitor  
 Any two treatment-emergent Grad e 2 symptomatic hypotension even ts within 7 days 
(non-urgent medical intervent ion indicated) or any Grade 3 hypo tensive event (urgent 
medical intervention or hospita lization indicated) assessed by the Investigator and/or 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor  
 Clinically significant finding or  arrhythmia on ECG that indica tes abnormal cardiac 
function or conduction or prol ongation of QTc-F >500 msec 
 Clinically significant new or w orsening signs of cervicomedulla ry compression as

Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
 Adverse findings on clinical hi p exam or hip imaging assessment s that are determined 
to be clinically significant as  determined by the Investigator and in consultation with 
Sponsor Medical Monitor and orthopedic specialist (if needed)  
If the subject meets any stoppi ng criterion, after Investigator  consultation with the BioMarin 
Medical Monitor and DMC, the sub ject may be re-challenged at th e same dose. If the subject 
meets stopping criteria on re-chal lenge or if re-challenge at s ame dose is not clinically 
indicated, other options that may be considered include:  
 Re-challenge at lower dose w ith consideration given to upward t itration to tolerated 
dose  
 Permanent treatment discontinuation (with an option of ongoing assessment in the 
study)  
Cohort Stopping Criteria  
For each cohort, a DMC review will be conducted if any of the f ollowing cohort stopping 
criteria occur in subjects tr eated with BMN 111.  Temporary dos ing suspension, permanent 
discontinuation of dosing, or dose reduction for the cohort(s) will be considered and the 
impact on all other age cohor ts will be assessed.  
 Any treatment-emergent AE asse ssed as at least Grade 4 by the I nvestigator and/or 
Sponsor Medical Monitor  
 Any two subjects have a treatment-emergent AE of at least Grade  3 assessed as 
related to study drug by the Investig ator and/or Sponsor Medica l Monitor  
 Any two subjects have two treatme nt-emergent Grade 2 symptomati c hypotension 
events within 7 days (non-urgent m edical intervention indicated ) or any two subjects 
cohort have a Grade 3 hypotensive e vent (urgent medical interve ntion or 
hospitalization indicated) assess ed by the Investigator and/or Sponsor’s Medical 
Monitor  
 Any two subjects have a clinical ly significant finding or arrhy thmia on ECG that 
indicates abnormal cardiac func tion or conduction or prolongati on of 
QTc-F >500 msec 
 Any two subjects have adverse findings on clinical hip exam or hip imaging 
assessments that are determine d to be clinically significant as  decided by principal 
investigator and in consultation w ith Sponsor medical monitor a nd orthopedic 
specialist (if needed)  
9.2 Discussion of Study Design, Inc luding Choice of Control Group 
Study 111-206 is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-co ntrolled clini cal trial of 
BMN 111 in infants and younger children with a diagnosis of ACH  who are age 0 to 
 Study 111-206 Page 54 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
< 60 months. Identification of eff icacy at this age range is co ngruent with mechanism of 
action of BMN 111, because BMN 111 is expected to act at open e piphyseal growth plates. 
Therefore, to have a potential th erapeutic benefit for subjects  with ACH, treatment is 
expected to be required prior to epiphyseal growth plate closur e. 
In terms of the study design, a r andomized double-blind placebo  control will be used to 
mitigate the risk of selection bias and any potential bias in d ata collection and study conduct.  
Additionally, this design provides a framework for interpretati on of any endpoints with a 
subjective component, e.g. HRQOL  and ADL questionnaires and any  subjective assessment 
of safety. 
9.3 Selection of Study Population

9.3.3 Removal of Subjects from T reatment or Assessment 
Subjects (or their legally author ized representative) may withd raw their consent to participate 
in the study at any time without  prejudice. The Investigator mu st withdraw from the study 
any subject who requests to be w ithdrawn. A subject’s participa tion in the study may be 
discontinued at any time at the d iscretion of the Investigator and in accordance with his/her 
clinical judgment. When possible,  the tests and evaluations lis ted for the termination visit 
should be carried out.  BioMarin m ust be notified of all subjec t withdrawals as soon as 
possible.  
Investigators may discontinue  administration of BMN 111 or plac ebo at any time. Reasons 
for which the investigator or BioMarin will withdraw a subject from study treatment include, 
but are not limited to, the following:

3. Subject does not adhere to study req uirements specified in the protocol 
4. Subject is lost to follow-up 
If a subject fails to return for scheduled visits, a documented  effort must be made to 
determine the reason. If the s ubject cannot be reached by telep hone, a certified letter should 
be sent to the subject (or the subject’s legally authorized rep resentative, if appropriate) 
requesting contact with the Invest igator. This information shou ld be recorded in the study 
records.  
The Investigator or designee must explain to each subject, befo re enrollment into the study, 
that for evaluation of study res ults, the subject’s protected h ealth information obtained during 
the study may be shared with the  study sponsor, regulatory agen cies, and IRB/IEC/REB. It is 
the Investigator’s (or desi gnee’s) responsibility to obtain wri tten permission to use protected 
health information per country-s pecific regula tions, such as HI PAA in the US, from each 
subject, or if appropriate, the subject’s legally authorized re presentative. If permission to use 
protected health information is withdrawn, it is the Investigat or’s responsibility to obtain a 
written request, to ensure that  no further data will be collect ed from the subject and the 
subject will be removed from the study. 
It is a priority of the study t o maximize study subject retenti on and adherence to 
study-specific procedures. The c ompleteness of the study data m ay affect the integrity and 
accuracy of the study results.  Therefore, subjects who discont inue study treatment should be 
 Study 111-206 Page 58 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
encouraged to continue to under go as many of the protocol-speci fied procedures and 
assessments as possible for the remainder of the study, as long  as such continued 
participation does not detrimen tally affect the health, safety,  or welfare of the subject.   
For subjects who discontinue  BMN 111 or placebo but remain in t he study, PK and 
BMN 111 activity assessments will  be waived completely; vital s igns and clinical 
labs/biomarkers will be obtai ned only once at each visit subseq uent to BMN 111 or placebo 
discontinuation.  Pre-and post-dose designations will not apply  as the subject has 
discontinued dosing and vital si gn and clinical lab/biomarkers assessments previously 
designated as “post-dose” will  be waived.  All other assessment s at each visit should be 
completed if possible and the s ubject is willing.  Data from th e study procedures and 
assessments may be used to further  characterize the natural pro gression of ACH.  
BioMarin reserves the right t o discontinue the study at any tim e.  Premature termination of 
the study may occur because of r egulatory authority decision, a  change in the opinion of the 
IRB/IEC/REB, clinical or safet y reasons, or at th e discretion o f the Sponsor.  The Sponsor 
reserves the right to discontinue  the development of BMN 111 at  any time, or to discontinue 
participation by an individual I nvestigator or site for poor en rollment or 
noncompliance.  Any decision to terminate the study will be pro mptly communicated to 
Investigators, regulatory aut horities, and IRB/IEC/REB.  The In vestigator is responsible for 
communicating any decision to termi nate a study to hospital sta ff involved in the conduct of 
the study and the participating subjects (and their families). 
9.3.4 Subject Identification  
Each subject will be assigned a uni que subject identifier. This  unique identifier will be on all 
eCRF pages. In legal jurisdicti ons where use of initials is not  permitted, a substitute identifier 
will be used. 
9.3.5 Duration of Subject Participation 
Duration of the study is 52 weeks  of treatment with a safety fo llow up at Week 56. Following 
completion of the study, subjects  in both treatments groups may  be eligible to receive 
BMN 111 in an open-label extensi on study, to assess safety and efficacy of BMN 111 over 
the longer term.  For subjects enrolling into the extension stu dy, safety follow up visit at 
Week 56 will be waived.  
Subjects who are not eligible t o receive BMN 111 in a separate study will return at Week 56 
for the Safety Follow-Up visit to assess for any AEs that may h ave occurred following 
completion of dosing.

Follow-up assessments and procedures should  be performed as outlined in the Study 
111-206 Sch edule of Events (Table 9.1.1 an d Table 9.1.2).  
Subjects who discontinue from study treatment will be asked to complete study assessments 
and procedures for the remainde r of the study.  If subjects dis continue from study treatment 
and decline to participate for the remainder of the study, they  will be asked to return for a 
final follow-up visit 2 weeks afte r their last study visit, and  the agreement should be 
documented. 
Subjects will participate in the study until completion or unti l one of the following occurs: 
the subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study, the subject is discontinued 
from the study at the discreti on of the investigator or BioMari n (upon consultation and in 
agreement with the investigator) or the study is terminated. 
9.4 Treatments 
9.4.1 Treatments Administered 
BioMarin and/or its designee will provide the study site with a  supply of IP sufficient for the 
completion of the study. 
Subjects will be randomized to BMN 111  at a daily dose of 15 µg/kg or placebo for the 
duration of the study. The normal dos ing schedule is a single d aily subcutaneous injection 
given 7 days a week.  If a recent acute illness associated with volume depletion (e.g ., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) 
has not completely resolved prio r to the first dose of BMN 111 or placebo, the dosing will be 
delayed until hydration status ha s improved (up to the maximum period allowed for the visit 
window). 
9.4.1.1 Study Drug Administration 
During the study, BMN 111 or placebo w ill be administered as a single 15 µg/kg SC 
injection given daily at approximately the same time each day w henever possible.  The same 
injection site should not be use d 2 days in a row, and should be rotated between the 
4 injection sites (upper thigh, uppe r back of arm, abdomen or buttocks). Doses may be 
administered in any of the comm on SC areas (upper arm, thigh, a bdomen, buttocks). 
Following administration of each dose, subjects will be observe d for at least 2 hours after the 
injection for Days 1 to 3, and 30 minutes for all other days of  dose administra tion (longer if 
clinically indicated ) either in the clin ic by study personnel, by a home health nurse, or by a 
parent/caregiver. Instructions  for home administration of BMN 1 11 or placebo for subjects

Guide and Injection media. 
9.4.2 Identity of BMN 111 
BMN 111  is cloned into the pJexpress401 v ector, expressed in E. coli an d then purified. 
The drug substance is a modified C NP peptide that retains wild- type activity and specificity. 
The modified CNP sequence is: 
PGQEHPNARKYKGANKKGLSK GCFGLKLDRIGSMSGLGC 
The amino acid sequence is an analogue of the naturally occurri ng tissue-expressed form of 
C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP-53). BMN 111  is a recombinant 39 amino acid peptide that 
includes the 37 C-terminal ami no acids of the human CNP-53 sequ ence, and is engineered to 
include two additional amino acids  (Pro-Gly) on the N-terminus,  which renders the peptide 
more resistant to degradation. It  is a cyclic peptide formed by  an intramolecular disulfide 
bond. The molecular weight of the  purified product is 4.1 kDa. 
9.4.2.1  Product Characteristics and Labeling 
The clinical drug product will be supplied in sterile, single-d ose, Type I glass vials with

9.4.3 Storage 
At the study site, all IP mus t be stored under the conditions s pecified in the Investigator’s 
Brochure in a secure area accessible only to the designated pha rmacists and clinical site 
personnel. All IP must be store d and inventoried and the invent ories must be carefully and 
accurately documented according to applicable state, federal an d local regulations, ICH GCP, 
and study procedures. 
Specific information for storage and return of BMN 111 or place bo is provided in the 
Pharmacy Binder, Study Drug I njection Guide, and Injection medi a. 
9.4.4 Directions for Administration 
Refer to the Study Drug Injecti on Guide for complete BMN 111 or  placebo preparation 
instructions.  
The injection will be administe red as a daily dose of BMN 111  15 µg/kg or placebo given as 
a single subcutaneous injecti on. The dose should be given at ap proximately the same time 
every day whenever possible.  Fol lowing administration of each dose at clinic visits, subjects 
should be observed for 8 hours afte r the injection on Days 1 an d 2; 4 hours on Days 3 and 8; 
and 1 hour on subsequent dosing vis its. Subjects should be obse rved for 30 minutes after 
every injection that is not admini stered at the clinic. Subject s should have adequate food 
intake prior to dosing. In the  hour prior to injection, all sub jects should have been fed prior to 
administration of BMN 111  or placebo. 
Caregivers will administer BMN 111 or placebo at home once appr oved by the investigator 
and adequate training is demons trated. Instructions on how to c omplete and document the 
training can be found in the Study Reference Manual.   
A caregiver will be eligible t o administer BMN 111 or placebo i f he or she meets all of the 
following criteria: 
 The subject has been on a stable  dosing regimen for a minimum o f 3 days  
 PI has approved administration of BMN 111 or placebo by the car egiver 
 The caregiver has completed the A dministration Training conduct ed by qualified 
study site personnel and has b een observed by the study site pe rsonnel to be able to 
adequately prepare the proper  dose and perform the injections s afely 
For dosing between planned clinic  visits prior to caregiver app roval, a home health nurse 
may administer BMN 111 or placeb o, or subjects may be administe red BMN 111 or placebo 
in the clinic by study staff  or trained caregiver.   
 Study 111-206 Page 62 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
The caregiver will be provide d with a study diary and will be a sked to record daily dosing 
information, changes in health status, medications and injectio n sites used, date and time of 
the injection, and injec tion site reactions, if any. 
A subject’s suitability for cont inued at-home drug administrati on will be evaluated by the 
investigator and the Sponsor’s M edical Monitor if a subject exp eriences a CTCAE Grade 3 
or higher AE that is considere d possibly or probably drug-relat ed, and/or a hypersensitivity 
reaction during the study.   
9.4.5 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Subjects will be randomized in a  1:1 ratio, i.e., injection wit h placebo:15 µg/kg of BMN 111, 
using IXRS.  An independent third party vendor will develop the  randomization schedule so 
that BioMarin and site personnel ar e blinded to treatment assig nments. 
9.4.6 Selection of Dose and Dosing Schedule Used in the Study 
Study 111-202, the second clinical t rial in humans and the firs t in children with ACH, is an 
ongoing Phase 2, open-label, sequent ial-cohort, dose -escalation  study that assesses daily SC 
BMN 111 in pediatric subjects w ith ACH aged 5-14 years with dos es ranging from 2.5 µg/kg 
to 30 µg/kg.  
Analysis of safety data from the  6-month initial phase of Study  111-202 showed that 
treatment with BMN 111 for 6 months at the doses of 2.5, 7.5, 1 5, and 30 µg/kg was 
generally well tolerated. The m ost common AEs across all cohort s were injection site 
reactions, asymptomatic hypoten sion, headache, and nasopharyngi tis. Based on previous 
experience of the ongoing Phase 2 c linical trial, including the  24-month data cut at 15 µg/kg, 
injection site reacti ons have been identified as risks associat ed with BMN 111 injections. For 
a detailed summary of risks, please refer to the current versio n of the Investigator’s Brochure 
supplied by BioMarin.  
Analysis of efficacy data from th e 6-month initial phase of Stu dy 111-202 showed that 
subjects treated with BMN 111 for 6 months at doses ranging fro m 2.5 to 15 µg/kg daily had 
a dose-dependent improvement i n AGV, with ~50% improvement in A GV seen at the 
15 µg/kg dose. The data from Cohor t 4 (30 µg/kg) show an appare nt greater than dose-
proportional increase in BMN 111 plasma exposure (C max and AUC 0-t), with a marginal 
improvement in both absolute AGV and change from baseline AGV a fter 6 months of 
BMN 111 treatment when compared with Cohort 3 (15 µg/kg).    
Efficacy/toxicity studies have been conducted in neonatal and v ery young animals (7-day 
postpartum mouse and rat) i n both a disease (TD mouse) and non- disease (rat) model. 
 Study 111-206 Page 63 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
Given that this is the firs t study in infants and young childre n, an age-based cohort study 
design is used to assess saf ety and PK in young children (Cohor t 1, ≥ 24 to < 60 months) 
prior to dosing toddlers (Cohort  2, ≥ 6 to < 24 months) and inf ants (Cohort 3, 
0 to  <  6 months). PK will be monitored and evaluated; Day 1 PK data f rom the sentinel 
subjects will inform dose sele ction modification for the sentin el subjects and for the rest of 
the cohort to target the observ ed exposure of the 15-µg/kg dose  group in Study 111-202. 
Safety, efficacy and PK data from Study 111-202, a Phase 2 stud y in children with ACH, 
where a dose of 15 µg/kg has bee n and continues to be studied, are expected to be the most 
relevant, and translatabl e to this study (111-206).   
9.4.6.1  Selection of Timing of Dose for Each Subject 
9.4.7 Blinding 
An independent third-party vendor will develop the randomizatio n schedule so that BioMarin 
and site personnel will not know t reatment assignments. BMN 111  or placebo will be labeled 
with the study number and a unique  identification number. Subje cts and the participating site 
members will be blinded to the t wo study treatments (15 µg/kg B MN 111 or placebo).  
The investigator and other membe rs of staff involved with the s tudy will remain blinded to 
the treatment randomization code  during the assembly procedure.  In the event of an 
emergency medical situation where subject management would be d etermined or 
significantly altered by k nowing the treatment assignment, the investigator may be unblinded 
without prior written approval fr om the Medical Monitor.  Follo wing such an emergency 
unblinding, the investigator will contact the medical monitor a nd provide written rationale 
according to the unscheduled unblinding procedure set forth in the Study Manual.  
The Medical Monitor will review the rationale, ev aluate whether  there are any additional 
safety considerations that need  to be implemented for the subje ct and/or the study, and 
determine whether the investigat or requires further guidance on  unblinding.  The Medical 
Monitor may also communicate with  the investigator advice on th e care of the subject and 
define the plan for the subject ’s future participation in the s tudy. 
9.4.8 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
All medications (prescripti on, over-the-counter [OTC] and herba l), and nutritional 
supplements 30 days prior to scr eening and throughout the study  will be recorded on the 
designated eCRF.  The Investigator  may prescribe additional med ications during the study, as 
long as the prescribed medic ation is not prohibited by the prot ocol. In the event of an 
emergency, any needed medications  may be prescribed without pri or approval, but the 
medical monitor must be notified of the use of any contraindica ted medications immediately 
 Study 111-206 Page 64 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
thereafter. Any concomitant med ications added or discontinued d uring the study should be 
recorded on the eCRF. 
9.4.9 Treatment Compliance 
Subjects will be instructed to r eturn all used and unused BMN 1 11 or placebo kits at each 
study visit. Subject compliance with the dosing regimen will be  assessed by reconciliation of 
the used and unused vials. The  quantity dispensed, returned, us ed, lost, etc. must be recorded 
on the dispensing log provided for the study. 
The date, time, and volume of each dose of BMN 111 or placebo a dministered to each 
subject must be recorded. These  data will be used to assess tre atment compliance.  
9.5 Investigational Product Accountability (BMN 111 or Placebo) 
The Investigator or designee is  responsible for maintaining acc urate records (including dates 
and quantities) of IP(s) received, subjects to whom IP is dispe nsed (subject-by-subject dose 
specific accounting), and IP lost  or accidentally or deliberate ly destroyed. The Investigator or 
designee must retain all unuse d or expired study supplies until  the study monitor (on-site 
CRA) has confirmed the accountability data. 
9.5.1 Return and Disposition of Clinical Supplies 
Unused BMN 111 or placebo must be ke pt in a secure location for  accountability and 
reconciliation by the stu dy monitor. The Inve stigator or design ee must provide an 
explanation for any destroye d or missing BMN 111 or placebo kit s/vials. 
Unused BMN 111 or placebo may be de stroyed on site, per the sit e’s standard operating 
procedures, but only after BioMari n has granted approval for de struction. The study monitor 
must account for all BMN 111 or pl acebo kits/vials in a formal reconciliation process prior to 
destruction. The site must doc ument all BMN 111 or placebo dest royed on site, and 
documentation must be provided to  BioMarin and retained in the investigator study files. If a 
site is unable to destroy BM N 111 or placebo appropriately, the  site can, upon request, return 
unused BMN 111 or placebo to the BioMarin contracted facility. The return of all BMN 111 
or placebo kits/vials must also be documented and accounted for  per instructions provided by 
BioMarin. 
All BMN 111 or placebo and related  materials should be stored, inventoried, reconciled, and 
destroyed or returned according to applicable s tate and federal  regulations and study 
procedures.

Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
9.6 Dietary or Other Protocol Restrictions 
BMN 111  will be administered as a single daily dose of 15 µg/kg SC inje ction given daily at 
approximately the same time each day whenever possible. Placebo  will be administered as a 
single SC injection given daily at approximately the same time each day whenever possible. 
Following administration of each dose, subjects will be observe d for at least 2 hours after the 
injection for observation for  Days 1 to 3, and 30 minutes for a ll other days of dose 
administration.  
Subjects should have an adequate  food intake.  In the hour prio r to injection, all subjects 
should be fed prior to adm inistration of BMN 111  or placebo. 
9.7 Demographic Data and Medical History  
Demographic data and a detaile d medical history  will be obtaine d at Screening. This medical 
history, including growth histor y and ACH-related history, shou ld elicit all major illnesses, 
diagnoses, and surgeries that th e subject has ever had; any pri or or existing medical 
conditions that might interfere  with study partic ipation or saf ety; and evaluation for knee, 
thigh, hip or groin pain, or c hange in gait/activity.   
9.8 Biological Parental Standing Height 
Standing height of the subject’s  biological parents may be asse ssed (optional) via height 
measurement or stated height. Hei ght measurement can be done at  any point in the study.  
Prior to the measurement bei ng taken, each parent is required t o complete an ICF specific to 
parent height assessment.  The ICF will be signed prior to the assessment, which can be done 
at any point in the study. If the  biological parent is not avai lable during the course of the 
study to take his/her standing heig ht, if consented, the biolog ical parent can provide his/her 
stated height.  
9.9 Physical Examination Findings 
Physical examination will include a ssessment of general appeara nce; CV; dermatologic; 
head, eyes, ears, nose, and throa t; lymphatic; respiratory; GI;  musculoskeletal; and 
neurological/psychological a nd genitourinary. Other body system s may be examined. 
Screening results will be the ba seline values and clinically si gnificant changes from baseline 
will be recorded as an AE or S AE and study drug related or unre lated when appropriate 
based on the investigator’s  clinical judgment.

9.10 Echocardiogram 
Cardiac anatomy and function will  be evaluated by a standard 2- dimensional Doppler 
echocardiogram by a cardiologist. Echocardiograms will be perfo rmed at screening, and 
provide information regarding car diac anatomy and function prio r to enrollment in the study. 
9.11 Efficacy and Safety Variables 
9.11.1  Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed 
The Schedule of Events (Table 9.1.1  and Table 9.1.2 ) describes the timing of required 
evaluations.  
9.11.2  Primary Efficacy Variables 
The primary efficacy endpoint is ch ange from base line in length /height Z-score. 
Growth measures may be collected approximately the same time ea ch visit (± 2 hr from the 
time when the first measurement assessment was taken at Screeni ng) by a study staff 
member, preferably the sam e person throughout the study, who ha s been trained by a 
BioMarin representative. Standa rdized measuring equipment and d etailed measurement 
techniques are detailed in the Ant hropometric Measurement Guide lines.  
9.11.3  Secondary Efficacy Variables 
The secondary efficacy endpoints in clude change from baseline i n AGV (annualized to 
cm/yr), biomarker samples to e valuate the e ffect of BMN 111 on bone metabolism, and 
BMN 111 pharmacodynamic biomarkers. 
Weight will be measured at Screening and at study visits as ind icated on the Schedule of 
Events (Table 9.1.1 and Table 9.1.2). 
Biomarkers may include but are not limited to assessment of cha nges in bone and collagen 
metabolism and BMN 111  bioactivity. BioMarin or designe e will perform analysis, and 
samples may also be used for assay development.   
Samples for blood and/or urine biom arkers will be collected at the time points presented in 
the Schedule of Events (Table 9.1.1 and Table 9.1.2 ). Refer to the Study Laboratory Manual 
for instructions regarding obtai ning and shipping samples. The sample type will also be 
included in the Study L aboratory Manual.

9.11.4  Exploratory Efficacy Variables 
9.11.4.1  Body Proportion Ratios  of the Extremities 
Change from baseline in body proportion ratios of the extremiti es will be evaluated using 
anthropometric measurements and measurement ratios.  Refer to t he Anthropometric 
Measurement Guidelines for speci fic instructions regarding the collection of growth 
measurements. All age-appropriate physical measurements will be  collected at approximately 
the same time each visit (±2 hours around the time when the fir st measurement assessment 
was taken at Screening) by a trained study staff member; every effort will be made to have 
the measurements collected by t he same study staff member, if p ossible, throughout the 
study. Each measurement will be taken in triplicate (excluding weight, taken once). 
Anthropometric measurement can be conducted either pre-dose or post-dose. Measurements 
may include but are not limited t o length, standing height (if able to stand unsupported), 
crown-to-rump length, head circu mference, upper and lower arm a nd leg, and arm span. 
Measurements not taken in the m idsagittal plane should be taken  on the right side of the body 
if possible and should always be t aken on the same side of the body throughout the study 
Body proportion measurements may i nclude but are not limited to  upper arm:forearm length 
ratio, upper leg:lower leg lengt h ratio, and armspan:standing h eight ratio. 
9.11.4.2  Imaging Assessment Procedures  (per Schedule of Events) 
Imaging assessment procedures for all visits must be performed using the same instruments.  
Imaging assessments can be conducted either pre-dose or post-do se. 
 Bilateral lower extr emity x-rays including both anterior-poster ior (AP) and lateral 
views to assess growth plates.  
 Hip imaging via pelvis x-ray to identify hip pathology (if chan ges from baseline 
trigger further evaluation) 
 Lumbar spine x-rays to measure ch anges from baseline in bone mo rphology and 
pathology.   
 MRI to evaluate the effect  of BMN 111 on skull and brain morpho logy, including 
foramen magnum, ventricular a nd brain parenchymal dimensions. 
 DXA scan (whole body [less head] , including spine, one third fo rearm and tibia, ultra 
distal radius) to assess bone  mineral density (BMD) and bone mi neral content 
(BMC). 
Additional imaging may be conduc ted should there be any issues or concerns with the 
subject’s imaging asse ssments. Imaging assessments will be coll ected and interpreted by a 
 Study 111-206 Page 68

central reader. If clinically sig nificant abnormalities are not ed, the investigator or designee is 
required to assess whether it is ap propriate to report an AE an d if the subject should continue 
in the study. Refer to the vendor  Imaging Guidelines for detail ed imaging assessment 
requirements and procedures. 
9.11.4.3  Exploratory Biomarker Research Sample Analyses 
All samples collected in this  study may be used for on-study, e xploratory biomarker research 
once the primary use has been completed.  
For each portion of the blood and urine samples reserved for pr otocol-specified analyses, 
there may be multiple sample aliquots. Once samples have been s uccessfully analyzed during 
the study, unused sample portions  may be used during the study for assay development or 
other purposes stated in this  section. No exploratory genomic r esearch will be conducted 
without consent from the subjec t and his/her legally authorized  representative (parent or legal 
guardian). 
9.11.4.4  Genomic Biomarker Analysis 
While the inherited FGFR3 muta tions associated with achondropla sia are well characterized, 
disease phenotype in monogeneic d iseases is often modified by v ariants in other genes. 
To identify and study genetic var iants that may modify achondro plasia, a whole blood 
sample will be collected.  Exploratory genomics will include, b ut are not limited to NPR-B, 
BRAF, and other genes associat ed with CNP signaling.  Explorato ry genomic analysis of 
plasma DNA may inform understa nding of the BMN 111 mechanism of  action in 
achondroplasia.  Exploratory genomics will not be conducted wit hout express consent from 
the subject and his/her legally aut horized representative (pare nt or legal guardian).  
9.11.4.5  Sleep Study 
Given that sleep apnea is a f inding in children with ACH ( Waters, 1993 ) and has implications 
on functional and health outcomes , a sleep study will be perfor med in a limited number of 
qualified sleep centers.  A sl eep-testing device will be used t o assess the presence and 
severity of sleep-disordered br eathing by measurement of blood oxygen saturation, pulse 
rate, and airflow during overnig ht monitoring. Assessment of ep isodes of sleep apnea will 
include, but may not be limited to, the number of episodes of a pnea and hypopnea per hour 
(Apnea/Hypopnea Index).   
9.11.4.6  Clinical Photography 
To document the physical and phenot ypic findings of achondropla sia with and without 
treatment with study drug, clini cal photography of the full bod y, face, spine, and extremities 
 Study 111-206 Page 69

photography, the assessment will be  waived for the duration of the study. 
9.11.4.7  Clinical Outcome Assessments 
Clinical outcome assessments will be administered to assess the  health-related quality of life 
of study subjects. ADL questionn aires will be performed in stud y subjects to assess 
functional performance. Clinical outcome assessments will be pe rformed at the time points 
indicated in the Schedules of Events (Table 9.1.1  and Table 9.1.2). The age ranges for 
clinical outcome a ssessment tools are shown in Figure 9.11.4.7. 1.

9.11.4.7.1  Bayley-III 
The Bayley-III is a performance based outcome assessment for us e in children from 1 to 
42 months. It is individually a dministered by the trained clini cian to the subject/child. 
The time required varies from  15-60 minutes depending on the ch ild’s developmental level 
and cooperation.  
Scales include Cognitive subscale, Receptive and Expressive sub scales, and Gross and Fine 
Motor subscales. The two language scales make up a composite La nguage Scale score and 
the Gross and Fine Motor subscales yield a composite Motor Scal e score. In addition, there is 
a Social-Emotional Scale and Ada ptive Behavior Scale, which is a questionnaire read and 
completed by parent or caregiver.  
 Study 111-206 Page 70 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
The scales have clinical and res earch utility as a diagnostic a ssessment for young children 
with varied disorders and disabi lities, and reflect current pro fessional standards for early 
childhood assessment ( Bayley, 2006 ).  
In addition to its use for subj ects ranging from 1 to 42 months  old, the Bayley-III assessment 
will be administered to thos e between 42 and 60 months old (Fig ure 9.11.4.7.1), as this 
assessment can capture ongoing deve lopmental issues associated with Achondroplasia.  
Bayley-III is waived for  subjects < 1 month old. 
9.11.4.7.2  Activity of Daily Living and Func tional Independence Measure (W ee-FIM) 
The Wee-FIM instrument is an ADL assessment tool that measures functional performance 
across three domains (self-care, mobility and cognition) ( Ireland, 2011; Ireland, 2012 ). 
The Wee-FIM instrument has been  used in previous research in ch ildren with ACH, and has 
identified ongoing limitations in f unctional performance across  these domains extending 
beyond the age of 7 years (Ireland, 2011). Because the WeeFIM c onsiders the child’s 
performance from a caregiver ’s perspective (Ireland, 2012), thi s tool in turn gives an 
indication of “burden of care” for families and caregivers of c hildren with ACH.  WeeFim is 
waived for children < 6 months old. 
9.11.4.7.3  ITQOL 
The ITQOL is an observer-reporte d outcome tool developed for us e in children from 
2 months to 5 years old that att empts to capture physical, ment al and social well-being. 
The ITQOL adopts the World Healt h Organization’s definition of health as a state of 
complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely  the absence of disease. 
The ITQOL also assesses the qua lity of the parent/guardians lif e.  The 97-item full-length 
version (ITQOL) will be used for  this study. Completion time va ries.  ITQOL is waived for 
subjects < 2 months old. 
9.11.4.7.4  Child Behavior Checklist  
The Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL) is for use in children from  1.5-5 years old.  
The CBCL comprises 99 questions a ddressing symptoms related to mood, behavior issues, 
and sleep disturbance.  It is completed by the parent or primar y caregiver.  
The form requires approximately 15 minutes to complete. The che cklist yields scores in the 
following areas: reactivity, anxi ety, depression, somatic compl aints, withdrawal, sleep 
problems, attention problems, a nd aggressive behavior. CBCL is waived for 
children < 18 months old.

9.11.6  Safety Variables 
Safety will be evaluated by the incidence of AEs, SAEs, and cli nically significant changes in 
vital signs, physical examina tion, ECG, imaging, and laboratory  test results (urinalysis, 
chemistry, hematology). Additionally, imaging, hip monitoring, biomarker, immunogenicity, 
cortisol and prolactin levels, a nd physical measurement data wi ll be utilized for  safety-related 
reviews and analysis.  
9.11.6.1  Adverse Events 
The occurrence of AEs will be asse ssed continuously from the ti me the subject receives study 
drug. The determination, evalua tion and reporting of AEs will b e performed as outlined in 
Section 10.2.1 . Assessments of AEs will occur at  the time points shown in the  Schedule of 
Events (Table 9.1.1 and Table 9.1.2). Additionally, contact by a study staff member to the 
caregiver will be required eve ry week for 6 months, and then ev ery 2 weeks for the 
remainder of the study. During t hese contacts, study staff will  ask the caregiver about dose 
administration and seek informa tion on AEs and SAEs by specific  questioning. Information

All procedures/intervention/surgery due to underlying ACH will be recorded after informed 
consent is obtained and after the first administration of study  drug, until 2 weeks after either 
the last administration of st udy drug or the Early Termination visit. If a subject is 
discontinued from the study prem aturely, all procedures/interve ntion/surgery due to 
underlying ACH will be recorded at the Early Termination visit.  
9.11.6.3  Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
Specific visits for obtaining clin ical laboratory assessment sa mples are provided in 
Table 9.1.1  and Table 9.1.2 . The scheduled clinical la boratory tests are listed in

9.11.6.5  Vital Signs, Physical Examinatio ns and Other Observations Relat ed to Safety 
Vital signs assessed pre-dose will include seated systolic bloo d pressure (SBP) and diastolic 
blood pressure (DBP) measured in m m Hg, heart rate in beats per  minute, respiration rate in 
breaths per minute, and temperatu re in degrees Celsius (°C). Al l treatment visits have 
pre-dose vital sign assessments. Post-dose measurements include  heart rate and BP. For all 
dosing visits, assessment fr equency is detailed in Table 9.11.6.5.1 (Schedule of Events, 
Table 9.1.1 and Table 9.1.2 ). 
At Screening, after at least 5 mi nutes of rest, subject’s BP is  taken in sitting position. 
Then the subject will stand and B P will be taken again at appro ximately 1 and 3 minutes after 
standing. Left brachial arm s hould be the first method of asses sment considered, and the 
same site should be used for blood pressure measurement in each  subject throughout the 
study. The method and site of blood pressure measurement will b e recorded and should be 
utilized consistently throughout  the remainder of the study. 
At other visits, vital sign measur ements are taken once per tim e point in a sitting position 
after at least 5 minutes of rest . Heart rate should be taken at  each time point that BP is 
measured. When blood samples and BP assessments are scheduled a t the same time or within 
the same time window, BP should be measured before blood sample s are drawn. If a BP 
measurement must be taken after  a blood draw, ensure adequate a nalgesia for the blood draw 
and wait several minutes before m easuring BP. Pre-dose vital si gns should always be taken 
and recorded prior to pre-dose  blood draw. Vital signs may be m onitored more frequently or 
for longer duration post-dose as clinically indicated.   
If a subject has signs potentiall y consistent w ith hypotension or a decrease in systolic BP of 
20 mm Hg or more from pre-dose systolic BP, blood pressure and heart rate (BP/HR) should 
be measured and recorded approxima tely every 15 minutes for the  first hour and every 
30 minutes thereafter until the sy stolic BP returns to pre-dose  systolic BP (or within the 
normal range for this subject a s defined by PI) and signs (if p resent) resolve.  If the 
hypotension resolves within the  first hour and returns to the n ormal range, additional BP 
monitoring as described above i s not required. Detailed guidanc e for blood pressure 
measurements is provided in the  Blood Pressure Instrument and T echnique Guidelines.

9.11.6.6  Mitigating the Risk of P otential Hypotension  
Study personnel and caregivers shou ld be made aware of the pote ntial risk of hypotension 
with BMN 111  administration.  Subjects must be  well hydrated and at a minimu m be fed 
prior to administration of BMN 111  or placebo.  If a recent acute illness associated with 
volume depletion (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) has not com pletely resolved prior to the 
first dose of BMN 111 or place bo, BMN 111 or placebo dosing may  be delayed until 
hydration status has improved (up to the maximum period allowed  for the screening 
window). 
Caregivers should be trained to obs erve and recognize the signs  of dehydration (e.g. from 
fever, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.) and contact the investigator p rior to BMN 111 or placebo 
administration if dehydration is  suspected. Site personnel and caregivers should be trained to 
identify the signs of hypotension and, if they occur, should im plement first-aid strategies at 
the discretion of the investigator  such as having the subject l ie down supine, elevating the 
lower extremities, and administering fluids. For guidelines on how to report adverse events 
associated with hypotension, refer to Section 10.3.1.4 .

9.11.6.7  Electrocardiography 
A standard 12-lead ECG will include heart rate, rhythm, interva ls, axis, conduction defects, 
and anatomic abnormalities. The t ime of collection will be reco rded. ECGs should be 
performed in triplicat e with the subject supine at the visits i ndicated in the Schedule of 
Events (Table 9.1.1  and Table 9.1.2). For study day visits  in which study drug is given , ECGs 
will be performed post-dose. For Day 1, in addition to post-dos e, ECGs will be performed 
pre-dose.  If clinically significant abnormalities are noted, t he investigator or designee is 
required to assess whether it is ap propriate for the subject to  continue in the study. 
9.11.6.8  Hip Clinical Assessment 
The hip clinical assessment s hould be completed by an appropria tely qualified physical 
therapist or a physician (MD) i. e., the investigator or the sub -investigator at the time points 
indicated in the Schedule of E vents (Table 9.1.1 and Table 9.1. 2). Medical history will be 
obtained to evaluate for hip, t high, or knee pain, or change in  gait. The physical exam 
(including observation of gait wh en possible) identifies and ev aluates any changes in hip 
function or pain with assessment  of active and passive range of  motion. Changes from 
baseline may trigger further e valuation based on the investigat or’s clinical assessment, which 
may include hip imaging and/or or thopedic consultation. If find ings on clinical hip exam are 
determined to be clinically si gnificant by the investigator and  in consultation with Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor and orthopedic sp ecialist (if needed), the DMC will be notified of AEs 
resulting from clinically signi ficant abnormal hip monitoring a ssessments. DMC may 
provide recommendations as to i f/when BMN 111 or placebo treatm ent should be 
temporarily or permanently discontinued.  
9.11.6.9  Pediatric Blood Volume 
Clinical labs and immunogenicit y samples are necessary to perfo rm to adequate safety 
assessment in this study.  The objectives of testing pharmacody namics biomarkers are to 
demonstrate biologic activity of BMN 111  and to understand the impact of immune 
responses on drug activity; and f or blood biomarkers, to invest igate the effects of treatment 
on changes in bone metabolism and endogenous CNP production. 
To minimize blood collection volu mes, assay technologies were c hosen that are capable of 
sensitively detecting analytes us ing the lowest possible volume  of blood for analysis.  
Additionally, assays capable of de tecting analytes in urine rat her than blood have been 
selected where possible.

9.11.6.10  Anti- BMN 111  Immunogenicity Assessments and IgE Testing 
Subjects randomized to receive BMN 111  or placebo will undergo imm unogenicity testing. 
Blood (serum) samples for immunoge nicity assessments will be co llected at the time points 
indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table 9.1.1 ), and testing perfor med using validated 
assays. Neutralizing antibody (NAb ) testing will be performed o n Baseline and TAb positive 
samples drawn from subjects weighing ≥ 7.0 kg and waived for su bjects < 7.0 kg.  
Scheduled samples will be tested i n one or more of the followin g assessments: 
 Anti- BMN 111  total antibody (TAb) 
 Anti-BMN 111  antibody cross-reactive with end ogenous CNP, ANP, and BNP (TAb)  
 Anti- BMN 111  NAb 
Testing for the presence of cro ss-reactive antibodies that bind  to endogenous CNP, ANP, or 
BNP and for the presence of BMN 111  NAbs will be performed on baseline samples and 
anti- BMN 111  TAb-positive samples. Baseline NAb sample and cross-reactive TA b sample 
testing will be done at any tim e prior to the end of study. 
9.11.6.11  HPA Axis Assessments 
To address potential effects  of BMN 111 on activation of the hy pothalamic pituitary adrenal 
(HPA) axis, assessment of saliv ary cortisol and serum Prolactin  levels will be analyzed at the 
time points indicated in the Sch edule of Events (Table 9.1.1). Both tests will be done at 
Baseline, Week 26, and Week 52.  
9.11.6.12  Ad Hoc Safety Assessments 
Samples for total IgE and drug-specific IgE testing will be dra wn on Day 1 and in the event 
of a significant hypersensitivity AE, or at the discretion of t he investigator and/or BioMarin. 
A significant hypersensitivity AE is defined as an event that i s grade 3 or higher, requires 
temporary or permanent cessation of BMN 111, or is determined t o be significant at the 
discretion of investigator and/or  BioMarin (exc luding reactions  that are solely a localized 
injection site reaction). If a hypersensitivity AE occurs, an u nscheduled safety visit should 
occur no later than 48 hours of the  start of the reaction, incl uding inspection of the injection 
site and clinical laboratory tests.  
Blood (serum) samples should be c ollected and tested in one or more of the following 
assessments: 
  Drug-specific IgE 
 Total IgE 
 Study 111-206 Page 79 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
 Serum tryptase 
If feasible, a sample for drug- specific IgE should be drawn no sooner than 8 hours after the 
event start time or before the ne xt dose. A sample for total Ig E and serum tryptase should 
also be drawn within 1 hour of the  start of the event when poss ible or during the unscheduled 
safety visit.  
A localized injection site reac tion is defined as skin signs or  signs restricted to one affected 
primary location, i.e., hives, wh eals, or swelling or an area o f erythema, redness, induration, 
pain, or itching at or near the s ite of injection. Management o f such localized reactions 
should be determined by the investigator’s clinical judgment in  consultation with the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor (if warranted). 
9.11.6.13  Unscheduled Safety Visits 
Unforeseen circumstances may a rise in which an unscheduled visi t may be needed. In such a 
case, the procedures performed a t the unscheduled visit will be  completed on a case-by-case 
basis .

10 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS 
10.1 Safety Parameters  and Definitions 
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording pro tocol-defined AEs and SAEs; 
measurement of protocol-specifi ed hematology, clinical chemistr y, and urinalysis variables; 
measurement of protocol-specifi ed vital signs; and other protoc ol-defined events of special 
interest that are deemed critic al to the safety evaluation of t he study drug. 
10.1.1  Adverse Events 
For this protocol, a reportabl e adverse event (AE) is any untow ard medical occurrence 
(e.g., sign, symptom, illness, diseas e or injury) in a subject administered the study drug or 
other protocol-imposed interve ntion, regardless of attribution.  This includes the following: 
 AEs not previously observed in th e subject that emerge during t he course of the 
study. 
 Pre-existing medical conditions j udged by the Investigator to h ave worsened in 
severity or frequency or change d in character during the study.  
 Complications that occur as a  result of non-drug protocol-impos ed interventions 
(eg, AEs related to screening pr ocedures, medication washout, o r no-treatment 
run-in). 
An adverse drug reaction is any A E for which there is a reasona ble possibility that the 
study-drug caused the AE. “Reas onable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the study-drug and the AE. 
Whenever possible, it is prefera ble to record a diagnosis as th e AE term rather than a series 
of terms relating to a diagnosis. 
10.1.2  Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) i s any untoward medical occurrenc e that at any dose meets 
1 or more of the following criteria: 
 Is fatal 
 Is life threatening  
Note: Life-threatening refers to an event that places the subject at  immediate risk of 
death. This definition does not  include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death. 
 Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization.  Hospitalizatio n for less than 24 hours 
will not be considered to be an SAE.  
 Study 111-206 Page 81 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
 Results in persistent or signifi cant disability or incapacity 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth de fect in the child or fetus o f a subject exposed to IP 
prior to conception or during pregnancy 
 Is an important medical event or reaction – that, based on medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject or requi re intervention to prevent one o f the above 
consequences (e.g. anaphylaxis) 
All adverse events that do not m eet any of the criteria for SAE s should be regarded as 
non-serious AEs. 
10.1.3  Events of Special Interest (EOSI)  
The following EOSI need to be rep orted to the Sponsor within 24  hours of site awareness, 
irrespective of ser iousness, severity or causality:  
 Fracture 
 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) 
 Avascular necrosis or Osteonecrosis 
10.2 Methods and Timing for Capturin g and Assessing Safety Parameter s 
10.2.1  Adverse Event Reporting Period 
For subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 (  ≥  24 to <  60 months old) and Cohort 2 (  ≥ 6 to   < 24 months 
old), the study AE reporting period i s as follows: after inform ed consent but prior to initiation 
of study treatment, only SAEs asso ciated with any protocol-impo sed interventions will be 
reported.  After informed consent is obtained and the first adm inistration of study drug, all 
non-serious AEs and SAEs reporti ng period begins and continues until 4 weeks following 
either the last administrati on of study drug or the early termi nation visit, whichever is longer 
(refer to Section 12.1.11 ). The criteria for determini ng, and the reporti ng of, SAEs is 
provided in Section 10.1.2 .  For subjects enroll ed in Cohort 3 (0 to  < 6 months old), AE 
collection period begi ns after screening. 
10.2.2  Eliciting Adverse Events 
Investigators will seek infor mation on AEs and SAEs and EOSI, i f applicable at each subject 
contact by specific questioni ng and, as appropriate, by examina tion.  Information on all AEs 
and SAEs and EOSI, if applicab le should be recorded in the subj ect’s medical record and on 
the AE Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).

10.2.3  Assessment of Seriousness, Severity, and Causality 
The Investigator or qualified desi gnee responsible for the care  of the subject will assess AEs 
for severity, relationship t o study drug, and seriousness (refe r to Section 10.1.2 for SAE 
definitions).  These assessments should be made by a study clin ician with the training and 
authority to make a diagnosis (e .g., MD/DO, physician’s assista nt, nurse practitioner, or 
DDS). 
10.2.3.1  Seriousness 
The investigator will assess if  an AE should be classified as “ serious” based on the 
seriousness criteria enumerated in Section 10.1.2 .  Seriousness serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations. 
10.2.3.2  Severity 
Severity (as in mild, moderate, or  severe headache) is not equi valent to seriousness, which is 
based on subject/event outcome or  action criteria usually assoc iated with events that pose a 
threat to a subject’s life or  functioning.  The severity of eac h will be assessed using the 
defined categories in  Table 10.2.3.2.1 . 
The Investigator or qualified designee will determine the sever ity of each AE and SAE, and 
EOSI using the NCI CTCAE v4. Adver se events that do not have a corresponding CTCAE 
term will be assessed according to the general guidelines for g rading used in the CTCAE v4 
as stated below.

10.2.3.3  Causality 
The Investigator will determine the relationship of an AE to th e study drug and will record it 
on the source documents and AE eCRF.  To ensure consistency of causality assessments, 
Investigators should apply the guidance in Table 10.2.3.3.1 .

  The administration of IP and the occurrence of the AE are reaso nably 
related in time  
AND 
 The AE is more likely explained by exposure to the IP than by o ther 
factors or causes. 
Factors suggestive of a causal relationship could include (but are not limited to): 
 Plausible temporal relationship 
 Absence of alternat ive explanations 
 Rarity of event in a give n subject or disease state 
 Absence of event prior to study drug exposure 
 Consistency with study product pharmacology 
 Known relationship to underlyi ng mechanism of study drug action  
 Similarity to adverse reacti ons seen with related drug products  
 Abatement of AE with discont inuation of study drug, and/or recu rrence of AE with 
reintroduction of study drug 
The investigator’s assessment of  causality for individual AE re ports is part of the study 
documentation process.  Regardless of the Investigator’s assess ment of causality for 
individual AE reports, the Sponsor will promptly evaluate all r eported SAEs against 
cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously com municate possible new 
safety findings to investigators and applicable r egulatory auth orities.

10.3 Procedures for Recording Adverse Events 
10.3.1  Recording Adverse Events on a eCRF 
Investigators should use precise  medical terminology when recor ding AEs or SAEs on an 
eCRF.  Avoid colloquialis ms and abbreviations. 
Record only one diagnosis, sign, or symptom per event field on the AE eCRF (e.g., nausea 
and vomiting should not be recorded in the same entry, but as 2  separate entries). 
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferred terms will be assigned by the Sponsor to the 
original terms entered on the e CRF, using MedDRA (Medical Dicti onary for Regulatory 
Activities) terminology. 
10.3.1.1  Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms 
Using accepted medical terminology, enter the diagnosis (if kno wn).  If not known, enter 
sign(s) and/or symptom(s).  If a  diagnosis subsequently becomes  available, then this 
diagnosis should be entered on the  AE form, replacing the origi nal entries where appropriate. 
10.3.1.2  Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, AEs occurring seconda ry to other even ts (e.g., casc ade events) should be 
identified by their primary cause .  For example, if severe diar rhea is known to have resulted 
in dehydration, it is sufficien t to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  
However, medically important eve nts that may be linked and/or s eparated in time should be 
recorded as independent events  on the eCRF.  For example, if se vere hemorrhage leads to 
renal failure, both events shoul d be recorded separately on the  eCRF. 
10.3.1.3  Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent AE is one that ex tends continuously, without resol ution, between subject 
evaluation time points.  Such a n event should be recorded only once on the eCRF unless its 
severity increases or decreases  (in which case it should be rec orded again on the AE eCRF). 
A recurrent AE is one that occurs  and resolves between subject evaluation time points, but 
then subsequently recurs.  All r ecurrences of the AE should be recorded on the AE eCRF. 
10.3.1.4  Hypotension 
If an asymptomatic drop in blood pressure meets the protocol de finition of AE per clinical 
judgment of the reporter, repor t the event as “blood pressure d ecreased.”  If the drop in blood 
pressure is associated with signs  or symptoms, complete the sym ptomatic hypotension eCRF 
and use the following guidance to report the corresponding AE e CRF: If a unifying diagnosis 
 Study 111-206 Page 86 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
is available to explain the ev ent of hypotension, report the di agnosis as an AE and capture 
signs and symptoms on the symptomatic hypotension eCRF page. If  no other unifying 
diagnosis is available, report “ hypotension” as th e event and c apture signs and symptoms on 
the symptomatic hypotension eCRF page.  
10.3.1.5  Injection Site Reactions 
If an injection site r eaction is associate d with a single sign or symptom, report the event on 
AE eCRF page (e.g., redness at inj ection site, AE is injection site redness). If the injection 
site reaction is associated with multiple signs or symptoms, re port injection site reaction as 
the adverse event on the AE pa ge, and individual  signs and symp toms will be reported on the 
ISR eCRF page (e.g., if the subj ect experiences redness and ind uration, report “Injection site 
reaction” on the AE page, and in t he corresponding Injection eC RF page, report erythema 
and induration).  If the injecti on site reaction a ppears after 24 hours, add “delayed” to the 
term used to describe the event. 
10.3.1.6  Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Laboratory test results will be recorded on the laboratory resu lts pages of the eCRF, or 
appear on electronically produced l aboratory reports submitted directly from the central 
laboratory, if applicable. 
Any laboratory result abnormality f ulfilling the criteria for a  SAE should be reported as such, 
in addition to being recorded a s an AE in the eCRF. 
A clinical laboratory abnorma lity should be documented as AE if  it is not otherwise refuted 
by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality and any one or more of the following conditions 
is met: 
 Accompanied by clinical symptoms 
 Leading to a change in study me dication (e.g. dose modification , interruption or 
permanent discontinuation)  
 Requiring a change in concomitant therapy (e.g. addition of, in terruption of, 
discontinuation of, or any other ch ange in a concomitant medica tion, therapy or 
treatment). 
 The abnormality suggests a dise ase and/or organ toxicity 
 The abnormality is of a degree th at requires active management (e.g., change of dose, 
discontinuation of study drug, mor e frequent follow-up assessme nts, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.) 
 Study 111-206 Page 87 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
This applies to any protocol and non-protocol sp ecified safety and efficacy lab oratory result 
from tests performed after the  first dose of study medication t hat falls outside the laboratory 
reference range and meets the clin ical significance criteria. 
This does not apply to any abnormal laboratory result th at falls outside the laborator y 
reference range but that does not  meet the clinical significanc e criteria (these will be 
analyzed and reported as laboratory abnormalities), those that are considered AEs of the type 
explicitly exempted by the protoc ol, or those which are a resul t of an AE that has already 
been reported.  
10.3.1.7  Pre-existing Conditions 
A pre-existing condition is one t hat is present at the start of  the study.  Such conditions 
should be recorded as medical hi story on the appropriate eCRF. 
A pre-existing condition should be  recorded as an AE or SAE dur ing the study only if the 
frequency, intensity, or charact er of the condition worsens dur ing the study period.  It is 
important to convey the concept that a pre-existing condition h as changed by including 
applicable language in the verba tim description of the event (e .g., more frequent  headaches). 
10.3.1.8  General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clin ically significant abnormality should be recorded as a  pre-existing 
condition (refer to Section 10.3.1.7 ).  During the study, any new  clinically significant 
findings and/or abnormalities discovered on physical examinatio n that meet the definition of 
an AE (or an SAE) must be recorded and document as an AE or SAE  on the AE eCRF. 
10.3.1.9  Hospitalization, Prolonged H ospitalization, or Surgery 
Any AE that results in hospita lization or prolonged hospitaliza tion should be documented 
and reported as an SAE unless spec ifically instructed otherwise  in this protocol (refer to 
Section 10.1.2 ). 
There are some hospitalization s cenarios that do not require re porting as an SAE when there 
is no occurrence of an AE.  These s cenarios include planned hos pitalizations or prolonged 
hospitalizations to: 
 Perform a protocol-mandated efficacy measurement 
 Undergo a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a pre-e xisting medical 
condition that has not changed 
 Receive scheduled therapy (study drug or otherwise) for the stu dy indication

Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
10.3.1.10  Deaths 
All deaths that occur during the  AE reporting period (refer to Section 10.2.1 ), regardless of 
attribution, will be recorded on t he AE eCRF and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor as an 
SAE. 
When recording a death, the eve nt or condition that caused or c ontributed to the fatal 
outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the  eCRF.  If the cause of death 
is unknown and cannot be ascertaine d at the time of reporting, record “Unexplained Death” 
or “Death of Unknown Cause” on the  eCRF.  If the death is attri buted to progression of the 
disease or condition being studies, record “-” as the SAE term on the eCRF. 
10.4 Reporting Requirements 
The Sponsor is responsible for identifying, preparing, and repo rting all suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs ) to the relevant competent au thorities, ethics committees, 
and investigators in accordance with requirements identified in  the Clinical Trials 
Regulations.  
10.4.1  Expedited Reporting Requirements 
All SAEs and EOSI, if applicable  that occur during the course o f the AE Reporting Period 
(refer to Section 10.2.1), whether or  not considered related to  study drug, must be reported by 
entering the information in the AE eCRF and submitting to BPV w ithin 24 hours of the site 
becoming aware of the event.  Each SAE must also be reported on  the appropriate eCRF.  
Investigators should not wait t o collect information that fully  documents the event before 
notifying BPV of an SAE.  BioMarin may be required to report ce rtain SAEs to regulatory 
authorities within 7 calendar da ys of being notified about the event; therefore, it is important 
that Investigators submit any i nformation requested by BioMarin  as soon as it becomes 
available. 
If the electronic data capture ( EDC) is unavailable, all SAEs s hould be reported to BPV by 
completing the SAE Report Form and faxing or emailing the compl eted form to BPV within 
24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event. Once the EDC is available, the information 
should be entered i n the AE eCRF.  
The reporting period for SAEs begi ns after informed consent is obtained and continues until 
4 weeks following either the last administration of study drug or study 
discontinuation/terminati on, whichever is longer.  
 Study 111-206 Page 89 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
10.4.2  IRB Reporting Requirements 
Reporting of SAEs to the IRB will  be done in compliance with th e standard operating 
procedures and policies of the I RB and with applicable regulato ry requirements. Adequate 
documentation must be obtained by Bi oMarin showing that the IRB  was properly and 
promptly notified as required. 
10.5 Follow-up of Subjects after Adverse Events 
The Investigator should follow all unresolved AEs/SAEs until th e events are resolved or have 
stabilized, the subject is los t to follow-up, or it has been de termined that the study treatment 
or participation is not the cause  of the AE/SAE.  Resolution of  AEs and SAEs (with dates) 
should be documented on the AE e CRF and in the subject’s medica l record to facilitate 
source data verification. 
For some SAEs, the Sponsor may follow up by telephone, fax, ele ctronic mail, and/or a 
monitoring visit to obtain addi tional case details (eg, hospita l discharge summary, consultant 
report, or autopsy report) deem ed necessary to appropriately ev aluate the SAE report. 
10.6 Post-Study Adverse Events 
At the last scheduled visit, the  Investigator should instruct e ach subject to report, to the 
Investigator and/or to BPV dir ectly, any subsequent SAEs that t he subject’s personal 
physician(s) believes might be r elated to prior study treatment . 
The Investigator should no tify the study Sponsor of any death o r SAE occurring at any time 
after a subject has discontinue d or terminated study participat ion, if the Investigator believes 
that the death or SAE may have be en related to prior study trea tment. The Sponsor should 
also be notified if the Investig ator should become aware of the  development of cancer or of a 
congenital anomaly in a subseque ntly conceived offspring of a s ubject who participated in 
this study.  
10.7 Urgent Safety Measures 
The regulations governing clinical  trials state that the sponso r and Investigator are required to 
take appropriate urgent safet y measures to protect subjects aga inst any immediate hazards 
that may affect the safety of s ubjects, and that the appropriat e regulatory bodies should be 
notified according to their resp ective regulations. According t o the European Union (EU) 
Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/ EC, “…in the light of the circ umstances, notably the 
occurrence of any new event rela ting to the conduct of the tria l or the development of the 
investigational medicinal produc t where that new event is likel y to affect the safety of the 
subjects, the sponsor and the I nvestigator sha ll take appropria te urgent safety measures to 
 Study 111-206 Page 90 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
protect the subjects against a ny immediate hazard. The sponsor shall forthwith inform the 
competent authorities of those ne w events and the measures take n and shall ensure that the 
IRB/EC/REB is notified at the same time.”  
The Sponsor is responsible fo r identifying, preparing and repor ting all SUSARs to the 
relevant competent authorities , ethics committees and investiga tors in accordance with the 
requirements identified in the  Clinical Trials Regulations. 
The reporting period for these eve nts which may require the imp lementation of urgent safety 
measures is the period from the time of signing of the ICF thro ugh the completion of the last 
study visit or at the Early Termi nation Visit (ETV). Investigat ors are required to report any 
events which may require the i mplementation of urgent safety me asures to BioMarin within 
24 hours. 
Examples of situations that may r equire urgent safety measures include discovery of the 
following: 
 Immediate need to revise the IP  administration (eg, modified do se amount or frequency 
not defined in protocol) 
 Lack of study scientific value , or detrimental study conduct or  management 
 Discovery that the quality or saf ety of the IP does not meet es tablished safety 
requirements

11 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS 
The parameters to be evaluated i n this study reflect the combin ed experience in the clinical 
study 111-202 and reflect the need t o further define the effica cy and safety profile of 
BMN 111  in the context of achondroplasia ( ACH), a complex skeletal dysp lasia disorder 
with multiple clinical manifestations. 
The efficacy parameters to be eva luated in this study reflect t he sponsor’s experience in the 
clinical study 111-202 and of prev ious studies of approved grow th products ( Kemp, 2009; 
Bright, 2009 ).  Evaluation of the paramete rs proposed in this study will do cument the effect 
of BMN 111  treatment on AGV in young children with ACH and are relevant to  assessing 
the medical complications of A CH in this patient population.   
The PK assessments in this st udy are generally r ecognized as re liable, accurate, and relevant. 
Bone-related biomarkers and other biochemical markers of the ph armacological activity of 
BMN 111  in the blood or urine are seconda ry assessments.  Genomic bioma rkers are 
exploratory assessments.

13 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
BioMarin personnel or design ees will visit the study site prior  to initiation of the study to 
review with the site personnel information about the IP, protoc ol and other regulatory 
document requirements, any appli cable randomization procedures,  source document 
requirements, eCRFs, monitoring r equirements, and procedures fo r reporting AEs, including 
SAEs.  
At visits during and after the study, a CRA will monitor the si te for compliance with 
regulatory documentation, with a focus on accurate and complete  recording of data on eCRFs 
from source documents, adherence to protocol, randomization (if  applicable), SAE reporting 
and drug accountability records.  
Sites will enter study data int o eCRFs into the study EDC syste m.  Data Quality Control will 
be performed by BioMarin Clinical Data Management or designee t hrough implementation 
of quality control checks specified in the study data managemen t plan and edit check 
specifications.

14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
14.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide additional det ails on the planned statistical 
analysis. Unless otherwise stat ed, all analyses will be perform ed using SAS v. 9.4.  
14.1.1  Interim Analyses 
An interim analysis will be carried out to support NDA/MAA fili ng. The report will be 
provided by a third party to assu re that the study team, subjec ts, and investigators have no 
access to the individual subj ect treatment allocation. 
14.1.2  Procedures for Accounting for M issing, Unused and Spurious Data  
Because the completeness of the data affects the integrity and accuracy of the final study 
analysis, every effort will be made to ensure complete, accurat e and timely data collection 
and, therefore, avoid missing da ta. In addition, a subject who prematurely discontinues study 
drug should be asked if they are  willing to contin ue to partici pate in the study assessments for 
remaining duration of the study, a s long as in the judgment of the investigator  such continued 
participation would not detrimen tally affect the health, safety , or welfare of the subject. 
No missing data will be imputed f or any analysis, except for un less otherwise specified for 
the efficacy analyses or for the missing dates for AEs and conc omitant medications. Missing 
dates or partially missing dates will be imputed conservatively  to ensure that an AE is 
considered treatment emergent and has the longest possible dura tion, if the partial 
information available indicates  that the AE is likely treatment  emergent.  
Additional details regarding t he handling of missing data will be provided in the SAP. 
14.2 Safety Analysis 
The safety analysis will be  performed on safety population as d efined in Section 14.7.2  and 
will be considered descriptive. 
All AEs will be coded using the m ost current version of MedDRA will be used by the 
Sponsor to assign system organ cla ss and preferred term classif ication to events and diseases, 
based on the original terms entered on the CRF. 
All AEs will be coded using MedDR A. The incidence of AEs will b e summarized by system 
organ class, preferred term, rel ationship to stu dy treatment (a s assessed by investigator), and 
severity. All AEs, including SAE s and AEs that lead to permanen t discontinuation from the 
study and from the study treatment, will be listed. Hypersensit ivity reactions and

symptomatic hypotension are of int erest, and the percentage of subjects who report these AEs 
will be presented. Hypersensiti vity reactions will be defined i n the SAP. 
Clinical laboratory d ata will be summarized by the type of labo ratory test. For each clinical 
laboratory test, descriptive statistics will be provided on bas eline as well as all subsequent 
visits. 
All other safety measures inclu ding laboratory tests, vital sig ns, ECG, echocardiogram, hip 
clinical assessment, and concomitant  medication data will also be summarized descriptively. 
Data summaries will be present ed by treatment group (when appli cable) for each cohort and 
overall. All safety results will be listed. 
14.3 Efficacy Analysis 
Efficacy analysis will be per formed on the efficacy population as defined in Section 14.7.1 . 
Efficacy endpoints include length/ height AGV and length/height standard score (Z-score) at 
Week 52.  
For a given interval [Date1, Dat e2], the AGV is defined as foll ows: 
AGV ൌ	Length/standing	height	at	Day	2െ	Length/standing	height	at	Day	 1
Interval	Length	ሺDaysሻ	ൈ365.25  
 
where the interval length in da ys is calculated as Date2 – Date 1. AGV will be calculated for 
the following visits/intervals: 
 Baseline: [Date of last length/he ight measurement in study 901 at least 6 months prior 
to screening visit in s tudy 206, Date of Day 1] 
 Week 13: [Date of Da y 1, Date of Week 13] 
 Week 26: [Date of Da y 1, Date of Week 26] 
 Week 39: [Date of Da y 1, Date of Week 39] 
 Week 52 (12-month): [Date  of Day 1, Date of Week 52] 
The baseline of the AGV is esta blished in the natural history s tudy of Study111-901, based 
on the standing height measurements  in the last 6 months prior to enrollment to Study 
111-206. AGV will be summarized using descriptive statistics (m ean, SD, median, minimum, 
and maximum). Results will be summarized by treatment group and  cohort. 
 Study 111-206 Page 105 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
The measurement of length/sta nding height will be converted to age-and sex-appropriate 
standard score (SDS), also refe rred to as Z-score, by compariso n with normal reference 
standards (not ACH). The Z-sco re will be summarized similarly t o growth velocity. 
Comparisons between treatment  groups by cohort on these variabl es will be carried out 
where appropriate. Statistical c omparisons will be considered d escriptive. Additional details 
regarding efficacy analysis wi ll be provided in the SAP.  
14.4 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Subjects randomized to receive BMN 111  or placebo will undergo pharmacokinetic testing. 
For subjects randomized to BMN 111, PK parameters generated ove r the course of the study 
will be evaluated and summarize d with descriptive statistical m easures (mean, standard 
deviation, CV%, min, median and max ). Correlative analyses of s ome of the PK parameters 
with efficacy, safety and immunoge nicity measures may be conduc ted. 
14.5 Immunogenicity Analysis 
Immunogenicity will be summarized  as change from baseline as we ll as by study time point 
in subjects randomized to receive BMN 111 or placebo.  Results will be summarized as 
incidence and titer for all cohorts. Additionally, immunogenici ty may be assessed for 
correlations with measures of safety, PK, and efficacy. 
14.6 Determination of Sample Size 
Approximately 70 subjects age 0 to  < 60 months at study entry will participate in this study. 
No formal sample size calcula tions were performed. The number o f subjects is considered 
appropriate to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BMN 111 in t he target population.  
14.7 Analysis Populations 
14.7.1  Efficacy Population 
All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of double -blinded BMN 111 or 
placebo in this study. 
14.7.2  Safety Population   
All subjects who receive at least one dose of double-blinded BM N 111 or placebo in this 
study.

15 DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE 
In addition to safety and PK m onitoring by BioMarin personnel, an independent DMC will 
act as an advisory body to BioMarin and will monitor the safety  and PK of subjects in the 
study. After the sentinel subjec ts complete 12 weeks of dosing,  a DMC review will occur to 
evaluate all available saf ety and PK data.  Upon approval by th e DMC, the next younger 
cohort will be opened and the 3 sentinel subjects will be enrol led. 
The DMC will make recommendations for stopping or continuing th e study on an individual 
subject level and/or on a cohort le vel per the pre-specified st opping criteria. Based on criteria 
outlined in the protocol, the DMC may also make endorsements fo r dose adjustments if 
needed.

16 COSTS, COMPENSATION , AND SUBJECT INJURY 
There will be no charge to st udy subjects to be  in this study. BioMarin will pay all costs of 
tests, procedures, and treatment s that are part of this study. In addition, after IRB/IEC/REB 
approval, BioMarin may reimburse  the reasonable cost of travel for study-related visits in 
accordance with BioMarin’s study-specific travel and reimbursem ent policy. BioMarin will 
not pay for any hospitalizations, t ests, or treatments for medi cal problems of any sort related 
solely to the study subject’s dis ease. Costs associated with su ch hospitalizations, tests, and 
treatments should be billed and col lected in the way that such costs are usually billed and 
collected outside the study. 
The Investigator should contac t BioMarin immediately upon notif ication that a study subject 
has been injured by the study dr ug or by procedures performed a s part of the study. 
Any subject who experiences a st udy-related injury should be in structed by the Investigator 
to seek immediate medical treatme nt at a pre-specified medical institution if po ssible, or at 
the closest medical treatment facility if necessary. The subjec t should be given the name of a 
person to contact to seek furth er information about, and assist ance with, treatment for 
study-related injuries. The tre ating physician should bill the subject’s health insurance 
company or other third party paye r for the cost of this medical  treatment. If the cost of the 
medical treatment is not covere d by health insurance or another  third party that usually pays 
these costs, then either BioMa rin or the institution may pay fo r reasonable and necessary 
medical services to treat the  injuries caused by the study drug  or study procedures. In some 
jurisdictions, BioMa rin is obligated by law to pay for study-re lated injuries without prior 
recourse to third party payer billi ng and/or regardless of faul t. If this is the case, BioMarin 
will comply with the law.

17 CASE REPORT FORMS AND SOURCE DOCUMENTS 
Electronic case report forms will be provided for each subject.  The Investigator must review 
and electronically sign the co mpleted eCRF casebook to verify i ts accuracy. 
eCRFs must be completed using a va lidated web-based application . Study site per sonnel will 
be trained on the application and w ill enter the clinical data from source documentation. 
Unless explicitly allowed in the  eCRF instructions, blank data fields are not acceptable.  
In the event of an entry error , or if new information becomes a vailable, the value will be 
corrected by deselecti ng the erroneous res ponse and then select ing or entering the factual 
response. In compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, the system will re quire the personnel making 
the correction to enter a reas on for changing the value. The do cumented audit trail will 
include the reason for the change , the original value, the new value, the time of the correction 
and the identity of the operator. 
BioMarin’s policy is that st udy data on the eCRFs must be verif iable to the source data, 
which necessitates access to all or iginal recordings, laborator y reports, and subject records. 
In addition, all source data shoul d be attributable (signed and  dated). The Investigator must 
therefore agree to allow direct  access to all source data. Subj ects (or their legally authorized 
representative) must also allow access to their medical records , and subjects will be informed 
of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed c onsent. If direct source 
document verification of study data  by the site monitor is proh ibited by institutional policy or 
local law, then the Investigator must make available facilities  and/or personnel to allow 
GCP-compliant source verificati on to occur. Examples of such me thods include certified 
copies of records which have st udy data visible but sensitive i nformation redacted, or other 
GCP-compliant means agreed betwee n the Investigator and the Spo nsor. 
A CRA designated by BioMarin will compare the eCRFs with the or iginal source documents 
at the study site and evaluate th em for completeness and accura cy before designating them as 
“Source Data Verified” (SDV). I f an error is di scovered at any time or a clarification is 
needed, the CRA, or designee, wil l create an electronic query o n the associated field. Site 
personnel will then answer the query by either correcting the d ata or responding to the query. 
The CRA will then review the response and determine either to c lose the query or re–query 
the site if the response does  not fully address the question. T his process is repeated until all 
open queries have been ans wered and closed.  
Before a subject’s eCRF casebook c an be locked, da ta fields mus t be source data verified and 
all queries closed. Refer to the  Study Monitoring Plan for deta ils on which fields must be

Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
source data verified.  The Invest igator will then electronicall y sign the casebook, specifying 
that the information on the eCRFs is accurate and complete. The  Data Manager, or designee, 
will then set the status of the forms, visits, and the entire c asebook to Locked. Upon 
completion of the CSR, an elect ronic copy of each site’s casebo oks will be copied to a 
compact disk (CD) and sent to each site for retention with othe r study documents.

18 STUDY MONITORING  AND AUDITING 
Qualified individuals designated by BioMarin will monitor all a spects of the study according 
to GCP and standard operating proce dures for compliance with ap plicable government 
regulations. The Investigator a grees to allow these monitors di rect access to the clinical 
supplies, dispensing, and stora ge areas and to t he clinical fil es, including original medical 
records, of the study subjects , and, if requested, agrees to as sist the monitors. The 
Investigator and staff are res ponsible for being present or ava ilable for consultation during 
routinely scheduled site visit s conducted by Bio Marin or its de signees. 
Members of BioMarin’s GCP Comp liance Department or designees ma y conduct an audit of 
a clinical site at any time be fore, during, or after completion  of the study. The Investigator 
will be informed if an audit is  to take place and advised as to  the scope of the audit. 
Representatives of the FDA or ot her Regulatory Agencies may als o conduct an audit of the 
study. If informed of such an ins pection, the Investigator shou ld notify BioMarin 
immediately. The Investigator wi ll ensure that th e auditors hav e access to the clinical 
supplies, study site facilities, o riginal source documentation,  and all study files.

19 RETENTION OF RECORDS  
The Investigator must retain a ll study records required by BioM arin and by the applicable 
regulations in a secure and safe facility. The Investigator mus t consult a BioMarin 
representative before disposal  of any study records, and must n otify BioMarin of any change 
in the location, disposition or c ustody of the study files. The  Investigator /institution must 
take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of  essential documents, that is, 
documents that individually a nd collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a study and 
the quality of the data produce d, including paper copies of stu dy records (e.g., subject charts) 
as well as any original source  documents that are electronic as  required by applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
All study records must be retaine d for at least  2 years after t he last approval of a marketing 
application in the US or an ICH  region and until (1) there are no pending or contemplated 
marketing applications in the U .S. or an ICH region or (2) at l east 2 years have elapsed since 
the formal discontinuation of clin ical development of the IP. T he Investigator /institution 
should retain subject identifiers  for at least 15 years after t he completion or discontinuation 
of the study. Subject files and ot her source data must be kept for the maximum period of time 
permitted by the hospital, institution or private practice, but  not less than 15 years. 
These documents should be retai ned for a longer period, however , if required by the 
applicable regulatory requireme nts or by a BioMarin agreement. BioMarin must be notified 
and will assist with retention shoul d Investigator /institution  be unable to continue 
maintenance of subject files for  the full 15 years. It is the r esponsibility of  BioMarin to 
inform the Investigator /instit ution as to when these documents  no longer need to be retained.

1 RATIONALE AND SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
The protocol has been amended to include the following changes:  
1. The lower age range of participating subjects who have a  ≥  6-month period of  
pretreatment growth assessment in Study 111- 901 immediately before study entry has 
been revised from  ≥  3 months to  ≥  6 months [§9.1].  
Rationale: To harmonize the roll- over of subjects from Study 111- 901 to 111- 206 in each 
cohort.  
2. No two sentinel subjects will be dosed on the same day for any cohort  [§9.1] . 
Rationale: To enforce a minimum period of saf ety observation prior to dosing the next 
subject , as in each cohort, the sentinel subjects will be the youngest children to date 
dosed with BMN 111.  
3. Echocardiogram will be performed at the Week 56 Safety Follow -up and Early 
Termination visits [Table 9.1.1; §12.1.10; §12.1.11].  
Rationale: To enable monitoring for any unintended adverse anatomical or functional 
cardiac adverse effects at the time of stud y completion.  
4. Use of residual plasma samples for cGMP PD biomarker assessment in all age groups has 
been added to procedures  [Table 9.1.1; Table 9.11.6.4.1; §12.1.2; §12.1.7; §12.1.8; 
§12.1.9].  
Rationale: Use of the residual sample allows for PD assessments in infants without timed 
urine collection.  The infant group assessments can then be compared to all age groups. 
5. An anti -BMN  111 immunogenicity assessment has been added at Week 3  [Table  9.1.1; 
§12.1.5].  
Rationale: Week 3 immunogenicity asse ssment has been  added to characterize early 
anti-BMN 111 immune responses in this age range of the achondroplasia subject 
population.  
6. Bone metabolism urine biomarkers , BMN 111 pharmacodynamic urine biomarkers , and 
urine chemistry  assessments have been added at Week 39 [ Table  9.1.1; §12.1.8]  
Rationale: To obtain PD assessments at each visit that PK is collected and to obtain creatinine concentrations for cGMP calculations  
7. The sleep study scheduled at the Week 26 visit has been removed [Table 9.1.1; §12.1.7].  
Rationale:  To minimi ze study burden on the trial participants, families and caregivers , as 
only two polysomnography studies are required to meet the study objectives. One 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 3 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
assessment will be performed at baseline and one at Week 52 (or the Early Termination 
Visit, if the subject leaves the study early).  
8. DXA scans will no longer include tibia s cans [Table 9.1.1; §9.11.4.2].  
Rationale:  The tibia scan was removed because DXA machines are unable to properly perform the scan.  
9. If the 111- 901 visit  at which the subject enter s Study 111- 206 and the 111 -206 Screening 
visit are on the same day, the procedures common to both visits  will be performed one 
time only [Table 9.1.1 ( footnote b )].  
Rationale: To ensure that duplicate study procedures, includin g blood draws, are not 
repeated unnecessarily in this infant and toddler population.  
10. On days when PK samples are being drawn, ECG will be performed within a 5- minute 
window prior to the 30- minute PK assessment [Table 9.1.1 ( footnote h) ; §9.11.6.7] . 
Rationa le:  This timing allows for ECG assessment in relation to  BMN 111 C max. 
11. Exclusion cri terion  #6 has been revised from “… as determined by the Investigator  based 
on the following assessments…) to (… as determined by the Investigator and informed by  
the followi ng assessments…).  T he determination about whether presence of 
cervicomedullary  compression is likely to require surgical intervention will be informed 
by physical exam, polysomnography, and MRI  [§9.3.2].  
Rationale :  To clarify that this is a clinical decision to be informed by signs, symptoms, 
and investigations, and not based solely on abnormal finding in an MRI.  
12. Exclusion criterion  #15 has been revised to include cervicomedullary decompression 
surgery (Cohorts 2 a nd 3 only)  [§9.3.2].  
Rationale:  To clarify that children with prior cervicomedullary decompression surgery 
are not eligible for entry into the study in Cohort 2 or 3.  This is to enable formal evaluation of a potential treatment effect on the fora men magn um using MRI in children 
at ages where the foramen magnum is still growing rapidly. As the synchondroses around the for amen magnum are already closing after the age of two years, subjects with prior 
cervicomedullary decompression surgery may be allowed int o Cohort 1 only after 
discussion and agreement with the Medical Monitor.  
13. Inclusion/exclusion criteria have been added for Cohort 3 subjects enrolling in the 
observational period [§9.3.3; §9.3.4]. 
Rationale:  These criteria are used in our observational stu dy 111- 901 and apply only to 
Cohort 3 subjects who enroll in the 111-206 observation period. 
14. A table of restricted medications, including growth hormone, has been added [§9.3.5].  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 4 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
Rationale:  T o ensure that growth hormone is not used concomitantly. 
15. In Section 9.11.4.4, Genomic Biomarker Analysis, the text  “of plasma DNA” has been 
removed from “ Exploratory genomic analysis of plasma DNA may inform understanding 
of the BMN 111 mechanism of action …” [§9.11.4.4] .  
Rationale: Genomic analysis implies DNA/RNA analysis, and we are not obtaining DNA 
from plasma.  
16. For subjects enrolled in Cohort 3 (0 to < 6 months old), the collection period for all AEs 
begins after informed consent is obtained [Table 9.1.2 footnote h; §10.2.1] .   
Rationale: to collect and document  all AEs so as to establish robust baseline natural 
history in these subjects prior to study drug administration.  
17. Administrative updates have been made to improve consistency and clarity. 
a. Text has been changed to reflect the age of majority rather than age  18, as the age of 
majority varies  between countries. Section 5.3, Subject Information and Informed 
Consent .  
b. Section 7.3, Ongoing Clinical Studies , has been updated to include a description of 
Study 111- 302 (Section 7.3.5) . 
c. In Section 8, Study Objectives , in the secondary objective addressing evaluation for 
hip, thigh, or knee pain, or change in gait from medical history , the phrase  “…from 
medical history…” has been removed to  clarify  that hip assessments are performed at 
screening, and these measures serv e as a baseline for future assessments.  
d. Error in Section 9.1, Overall Study Design and Plan, description of Cohort 3 has been 
corrected to state that at least 17 additional subjects will be randomized.  
e. Clarification about age -appropriate dose adjustment has been added to indicate that 
subjects will be administered the recommended dose appropriate to their current age. Section 9.1, Overall Study Design and Plan, and Section 9.1.1, Dose Adjustments . 
f. The ti me window for the Week 56 safety follow -up visit has been changed from ±  to 
+ 7 days to allow a full 4 weeks between the last dose of study drug and the safety follow -up visit.  Table 9.1.1, Section 12.1.10, Week 56 Safety Follow -up.   
g. Clarified that the s creening/baseline hip assessment includes a pelvis x -ray.  
Table  9.1.1, Section 12.1.1, Screening/Baseline Day -30 to Day -1. 
h. Because the definition of ACH -related events differed between sites, capture of 
ACH- related events has been changed to capture all  procedures listed in the Schedule 
of Events to ensure all procedures are collected and analyzed.  Tables 9.1.1 and 9.1.2; Section  9.11.6.2; Sections  12.1.2- 12.1.11; Sections 12.2.2- 12.2.3.

i. Vital signs instructions now include sitting or supine positions t o account for subjects 
who are too young to sit. The duration of vital signs assessments in Section 9.11.6.5 
and Table 9.11.6.5.1 has been extended to align with the assessments presented in the SOE.  Additionally, i f a dose adjustment visit coincides with a visit at which a full PK 
is drawn, vital signs will be obtained for 8 hours, similar to the Day 1,2 schedule.  Table 9.1.1, Vital Sign Assessment Frequency table; Section 9.11.6.5, Vital Signs ;

text has been added to specify the biomarke rs used to assess changes in bone and 
collagen metabolism.  
m. In Table 9.1.1, footnote q, instruction has been included that efforts to obtain a 
satisfactory MRI image can be discontinued after 3 unsuccessful attempts.  
n. In Table 9.1.1, footnote v now includes instructions for managing a dose interruption.  
o. Section 9.1.1, Dose Adjustments , has been corrected to state that a DMC review will 
occur after the third sentinel subject reaches Week 12 post -dose adjustment. 
p. In Section 9.3.8, Duration of Subject Participat ion, final follow -up visit for subjects 
who discontinue from the study has been changed from 2 weeks to 4 weeks  after last 
dose to be consistent with the safety follow -up at 4 weeks in the Schedule of Events.  
q. In Section 9.4.1, Treatments Administered , text has been added to reiterate that 
sentinel subjects will be treated with BMN 111, versus randomized subjects who will 
receive either BMN 111 or placebo.  Additionally, the BMN 111 dose level is subject 
to potential per-protocol  adjustment. 
r. Directions for subject observation following BMN 111 administration at study visits has been revised in Section 9.4.1.1, Study Drug Administration, for consistency with Section 9.4.4, Directions for Administration . 
s. Text in Section 9.4.1.1, Study Drug Administration now  indicates that study drug 
injections will be administered at age -appropriate sites, determined at the discretion 
of the investigator.  
t. Text has been revised to indicate that in the hour prior to injection, all subjects should be well hydrated and fed .  Secti on 9.4.4, Directions for Administration ; Section 9.6,

TITLE OF STUDY:  A Phase 2 Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Clinical Trial to 
Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of BMN 111 in Infants and Young Children with Achondroplasia, Age 0 to < 60 Months  
PROTOCOL NUMBER :  111- 206 
STUDY SITES:  Approximately 10-15 sites worldwide 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  Phase 2  
STUDY RATIONALE:  
BMN 111 is a recombinant CNP analogue that has been engineered to resist degradation by NEP, 
allowing for a longer half -life. 
The pharmacological a ctivity of BMN 111 was explored in two mouse models of ACH, a severe, 
Fgfr3Y367C/+ (TD) model ( Lorget, 2012 ), and a milder [Ach] /+ (Ach) model. These included 
studies in 7 -day old TD mice given  BMN  111 daily by SC administration for up to 20 days and a 
study in 3-week old Ach mice given BMN 111 daily by SC administration for 5  weeks. Partial or 
complete reversion of the ACH phenotype was observed in these mouse models after BMN 111 
administration. In wild -type mice, and normal rats and monkeys, BMN 111 adm inistration resulted 
in growth plate expansion and dose -dependent skeletal growth at hemodynamically tolerated dose 
levels ( Wendt,  2015). Additionally, the potential effect of age on BMN 111 PK was evaluated in 
normal rats aged between 7 days and 12 -13 weeks.   
Infants and young children with ACH have a high incidence of medical complications and currently there is no approved pharmacological therapy for ACH in the US or EU. The most severe 
complication, cervicomedullary compression (CMC), occurs in a sub set of subjects with ACH due 
to abnormal endochondral bone growth and narrowing of the foramen magnum ( White, 2016 ). CMC 
has been linked to serious respiratory and neurological complications including hypotonia, apnea, 
ataxia, developmental delay, and resp iratory arrest associated with sudden death ( Mukherjee, 2014). 
Foramen magnum decompression surgery is currently the only treatment for this condition.   
Sleep apnea has also been extensively described in ACH, and sleep -disordered breathing may affect 
up to 85% of all children with ACH ( Ireland, 2012). This is thought to be due to midface 
hypoplasia, relative adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and potential posterior cranial fossa compression 
secondary to abnormal endochondral bone growth. Sleep apnea in ACH not only results in the need 
for surgical intervention, but has also been linked to sudden death in rare cases ( Pauli, 1984 ).   
Similarly, the dysregulation of endochondral bone growth in ACH leads to other medical 
complications which are prevalent in this subject population, such as the following:

• Spinal stenosis, kyphosis, and lordosis (secondary to altered growth plate ossification in the 
vertebrae and narrowing of the interpedicular distances) ( Shirley, 2009 ) 
• Developmental delay of gross motor and ambula tory skills (associated with proximal limb 
shortening, macrocephaly, and hypotonia) ( Ireland, 2010)  
• Delayed functional skills and increased need for caregiver assistance (eg, eating, bladder management, bowel management, transfer to chair, climbing stairs)  (Ireland, 2011)  
Thus, BMN  111 may provide greater benefit when children begin treatment at a younger age, as 
earlier initiation of treatment allows a longer time window to improve growth and potential to improve medical complications of achondroplasia. Th is study (111 -206) is being conducted to 
assess safety and the potential benefit of BMN 111 in infants and young children.   
BMN 111 was first tested in humans in Study 111- 101, a Phase 1 double -blinded, placebo -
controlled clinical trial of the safety and tolerability of BMN 111 in healthy adult male volunteers 
without ACH. Part 1 examined a series of single subcutaneous doses (5 µg/kg, 10 µg/kg and 
15 µg/kg), and Part 2 included 10 days of either fixed dosing or dose escalation (0.5 µg/kg to 
8 µg/kg). BMN 111 was generally well tolerated at all doses.  As expected, mild, transient, self -
limited hypotension was reported (refer to current Investigators Brochure for additional 
information). Following SC administration, BMN  111 was rapidly absorbed with maximal plasma 
concentrations achieved in less than 30 minutes. BMN 111 was rapidly cleared from the plasma with a mean t
1/2 ranging from 40 to 55 minutes  across dose levels. BMN 111 exposure (C max and 
AUC 0-t) generally increased greater than proportional to the i ncrease in dose across the 2.5 -to-
15-µg/kg dose range. Exposure following multiple dosing was found to be similar to exposure 
following single doses, indicating no apparent accumulation or time -dependence with once -daily SC 
administration.  
Study 111- 202, t he second clinical trial in humans and the first in children with ACH, is an ongoing 
Phase 2, open -label, sequential -cohort, dose -escalation study that assesses daily SC BMN 111 in 
pediatric subjects with ACH aged 5 -14 years with doses ranging from 2.5 µg/kg to 30  µg/kg. The 
primary objective of Study 111 -202 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMN 111 
administered for 6  months and up to 24 months; the secondary objectives are to determine change 
from baseline in annualized growth velocity (AGV), growth parameters, body proportions, and evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BMN 111 in children with ACH.

Analysis of safety data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111 -202 showed that treatment with 
BMN 111 for 6 months at the doses of 2.5, 7.5, 1 5, and 30 µg/kg was generally well tolerated (refer 
to current Investigator ’s Brochure for specific details) . One subject ( 30 µg/kg) in 111-202 withdrew 
due to an AE. The subject developed non-serious, asymptomatic Grade 1 intermittent Wolff -
Parkinson-White pattern, which was discovered on a routine day 10-study monitoring ECG.  The 
most common AEs across all cohorts were injection site reactions, asymptomatic hypotension, 
headache, and nasopharyngitis. Based on previous experience of the ongoing Phase 2 c linical trial, 
including the 24-month data cut at 15 µg/kg, injection site reactions have been identified as risks 
associated with  BMN 111 injections. The majority of hypotension events were grade 1 and reported 
in the setting of routine BP measurement. All reported events of hypotension were transient and resolved without medical intervention. For a detailed summary of risks, please refer to the current 
version of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by BioMarin.  
Analysis of efficacy data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111-202 showed that subjects 
treated with BMN 111 for 6 months at doses ranging from 2.5-15 µg/kg daily ha d a dose -dependent 
improvement in AGV, with ~50% improvement in AGV seen at the 15 µg/kg dose. The data from 
Cohort 4 (30 µg/kg) show an apparent greater than dose -proportional increase in BMN 111 plasma 
exposure (C max and AUC 0-t), with a marginal improvem ent in both absolute AGV and change from 
baseline AGV after 6  months of BMN 111 treatment when compared with Cohort 3 (15 µg/kg).    
Study 111- 206 is a Phase 2 randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of BMN  111 
in infants and younger children with a diagnosis of ACH  who are 0 to <  60 months old. This 52 -
week study will enable assessment of BMN 111 efficacy and safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics 
biomarkers, and PK in this population. Additional exploratory endpoints pertaining to medi cal 
complications of ACH will also be evaluated.   
Efficacy/toxicity studies have been conducted in neonatal and very young animals (7 -day 
postpartum mouse and rat) in both a disease (TD mouse) and non-disease (rat) model. Given that 
this is the first stud y in infants and young children, an age -based cohort study design is used to 
assess safety and PK in young children (Cohort 1, ≥ 24 to < 60 months) prior to dosing toddlers 
(Cohort 2, ≥ 6 to  < 24 months) and infants (Cohort 3, 0 to < 6 months). PK will be monitored and 
evaluated; Day 1 PK data from the sentinel subjects will inform dose selection modification for the sentinel subjects and for the rest of the cohort to target the observed exposure of the 15-µg/kg dose 
group in Study 111-202. Safety, efficacy  and PK data from Study 111-202, a Phase 2 study in 
children with ACH, where a dose of 15 µg/kg has been and continues to be studied,  are expected to 
be the most relevant, and translatable to this study (111 -206).

Study 111 -901 is an ongoing study to collect serial growth measurements on pediatric subjects with 
ACH who are being considered  for subsequent enrollment in future BioMarin studies.  Subjects age 
≥ 6 months to < 60 months old who have documented ACH confirmed by genetic testing; at least a 
6-month period of pretreatment growth assessment in Study 111- 901 immediately before study 
entry; and who meet the study eligibility criteria, will participate. Eligible subjects ranging from 0 
months to < 3 months old may enroll directly into 111-206 and ha ve a minimum of 3 months of 
pre-treatment  observation prior to commencing treatment with investigational product, or may 
enroll in 111- 901 for a minimum of 3 months of pretreatment growth ass essment immediately 
before roll-over  to 111- 206. 
Approximately 70 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 10 -15 clinical centers worldwide.   
The primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety and tolerability of daily SC BMN  111 
administered to infants and young children with ACH, and to evaluate the effect of BMN 111 on 
length/height Z-score. S ubjects will be enrolled into 3 age cohorts based on age at study screening 
starting with the eldest population.  Within Cohorts 1 and 2, subjects will be stratified by age:  
• Cohort 1 – children aged ≥ 24 to < 60 months (n ≥  30 total: 3 sentinel subjects wh o receive 
BMN 111, and at least 27 additional subjects randomized 1:1 to treatment or placebo control), stratified by age (≥ 24 to < 36 months and ≥  36 months to < 60 months)  
• Cohort 2 – children aged ≥ 6 to  < 24 months (n ≥  20 total: 3 sentinel subjects w ho receive 
BMN 111, and at least 17 additional subjects randomized 1:1 to treatment or placebo control), stratified by age (≥  6 months to <  15 months and ≥  15 months to <  24 months)  
• Cohort 3 – children aged 0 to < 6 months (n ≥ 20 total: 3 sentinel subjec ts who will be under 
observation or receive BMN 111, and at least 17 additional subjects randomized 1:1 to 
treatment or placebo control).  Treatment begins at ≥  3 months to  < 6 months  after 3 
months of observation.  
If subjects who enroll in Cohort 3 are not  able to begin treatment by 
 < 6 months of age, they will 
continue in the pretreatment period for another 3 months before enrolling in Cohort 2 to fulfill the pretre atment requirement for Cohort 2.  
Sentinel subjects from each cohort will be enrolled , treated with BMN 111, and studied for short -
term safety and PK data, after which subjects will be randomized to receive BMN 111 or placebo 
SC daily (1:1 ratio) for up to 52 weeks. No two sentinel subjects will be dosed on the same day for 
any cohort.

At th e start of the study, three sentinel subjects will be enrolled and monitored in Cohort 1. After all 
3 sentinel subjects reach Day 8, the Sponsor will review and evaluate all available safety data and 
Day 1 PK data. Based on PK data review, the weight -based  dose may be adjusted for the sentinel 
subjects and the rest of the cohort, and will be the starting dose for the younger cohort sentinel 
subjects.  Upon review of the clinical and PK data, the remainder of Cohort 1 ( ≥ 27 additional 
subjects) will be enrol led and randomized to treatment with BMN 111 or placebo (1:1 ratio).  After 
the sentinel subjects complete 12 weeks of dosing, a DMC review will occur to evaluate all 
available safety and PK data.  Upon approval by the DMC, the next younger cohort (Cohort 2) will 
be opened and the 3 sentinel subjects will be enrolled.  
The same procedure will be followed for Cohort 2. After all 3 sentinel subjects reach Day 8, the 
Sponsor will review and evaluate all available safety data and Day 1 PK data. Based on PK data and

cohort, and will be the starting dose for the younger cohort sentinel subjects.   Upon review of the 
clinical and PK data, the remainder of Cohort 2 ( ≥ 17 additional subjects) will be enrolled and 
randomized to treatment with BMN 111 or placebo (1:1 ratio). After the sentinel subjects complete 
12 weeks of dosing, a DMC review will occur to evaluate all available safety and PK data.  Upon 
approval by the DMC, the youngest cohort (Cohort 3) will be opened and the 3 sentinel subjects will 
be enrolled.

Cohort 3 subjects must have a minimum of  3 mo nths of observation prior to commencement of 
treatment.  These subjects will have the option to enroll in either 111-901 or 111-206, depending on 
age at enrollment:  
• Infants ≥ 3 months  and  < 6 months old (≥ 13  weeks and  < 26 weeks) will enroll in 111 -901 
for a 6 -month period of pretreatment growth assessment prior to enrollment in 111-206 for 
treatment in Cohort 2.  
• Infants between birth and < 3 months old (0 weeks and < 13 weeks) will enroll into 111 -206 
with a 3 -month observational period prior to treatment.  
Additional sentinels may be added to any cohort if needed for additional safety and/or PK 
assessment.

As subjects age on study, they will be administered the dose determined to be appropriate for their 
current age.  For example, if a subject enr olls into Cohort 2 at age 20 months, they will receive the 
recommended dose for subjects aged ≥ 6 to  < 24 months until they turn 24 months in age.  When 
they turn 24 months in age, they will begin to receive the recommended dose for subjects 
aged  ≥ 24 to  < 60 months.  Duration of the study is 52 weeks of treatment with a safety follow up at 
Week 56. Following completion of the study, subjects in all treatment groups may be eligible to 
receive BMN 111 in an open -label extension study, to assess safety and efficacy of BMN 111 over 
the longer term ; and to study the long-term outcomes on sustained growth, proportionality, bone 
maturation and medical comorbidities .  
For subjects enrolling into the extension study, safety follow up visit at Week 56 will be waive d.  
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  
In addition to safety and PK monitoring by BioMarin personnel, an independent DMC will act as an advisory body to BioMarin and will monitor the safety and PK of subjects in the study. After the 
sentinel subjects complete 12 weeks of dosing, a DMC review will occur to evaluate all available 
safety and PK data.  Upon approval by the DMC, the next younger cohort will be opened and the 3 sentinel subjects will be enrolled.  
The DMC will make recommendations for stopping or continuing the study on an individual subject 
level and/or on a cohort level per the pre -specified stopping criteria. Based on criteria outlined in the 
protocol, the DMC may also make endorsements for dose adjustments if needed.  
Please see DMC Charter for fu rther details.  
 
Individual Subject Stopping Criteria  
For individual subjects treated with BMN 111, DMC will be informed if any of the following 
individual subject stopping criteria should occur. Temporary dosing suspension, permanent 
discontinuation of dosing, or dose reduction for the individual subject will be considered.  
• Any treatment -emergent adverse event (AE) assessed as at least Grade 4 by the Investigator 
and/or Sponsor Medical Monitor  
• Any treatment -emergent AE of at least Grade 3 assessed as related to study drug by the 
Investigator and/or Sponsor Medical Monitor  
• Any two treatment -emergent Grade 2 symptomatic hypotension events within 7 days 
(non-urgent medical intervention indicated) or any Grade 3 hypotensive event (urgent 
medical interventio n or hospitalization indicated) assessed by the Investigator and/or 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor

Dose Adjustments  
Analysis of a vailable PK data from studies 111 -101 and 111-202 indicated that differences in 
subject body weight did not directly translate to differences in total body clearance of BMN 111.  
The same weight -based dose in the pediatric population of Study 111-202 (5-12  years old) yielded 
lower exposure (C max and AUC) than that characterized in the adult population of Study 111- 101.  
Therefore, the same weight -based dose in the young pediatric population in this study may yield 
exposure less than the target exposure rang e characterized to be safe and effective in Study  111-202 
at the 15 -µg/kg dose. Since this is the first experience with BMN 111 in this young pediatric 
population, it is also possible the exposure at 15 μg/kg could be greater than the target exposure 
range , and dose adjustment may be warranted. Thus, an option for adjustment of the weight -based 
dose is provided to ensure that the appropriate target exposure for safety and efficacy is reached for 
the young subjects in this study.   
The need for dose adjustme nt will be evaluated as follows: three sentinel subjects in Cohort 1 will 
receive an initial dose of 15 µg/kg. After all three sentinel subjects reach Day 8, a review will occur 
to evaluate all available safety and PK data (at minimum). If the criteria for  dose adjustment are 
met, the three sentinel subjects will be started on the new adjusted dose at their next scheduled visit, 
and vital signs will be obtained for at least 4 hours post -dose.  
The remainder of the subjects in the age cohort will also be enrolled starting at the new adjusted 
dose. After the third sentinel subject reaches Week 12  post-dose  adjustment, a DMC review will 
occur to evaluate all safety and PK data and, upon endorsement, the three sentinel subjects from the 
next younger cohort will be enrolled starting at the new adjusted dose.  The three sentinel subjects 
for the second and thir d cohorts will be evaluated similarly to the sentinel subjects in the first cohort 
for potential dose adjustment.  
As subjects age on study, they will be administered the dose determined to be appropriate for their 
current age.  For example, if a subject en rolls into Cohort 2 at age 20 months, they will receive the 
recommended dose for subjects aged ≥ 6 to  < 24 months until the y turn 24 months in age.  When 
they turn 24 months in age, they will begin to receive the recommended dose for subjects aged ≥ 24 to < 60 months.

Safety and Efficacy Monitoring  
Each treated subject will have expanded outpatient safety monitoring for a minimum of 3 days of dosing, during which they will be closely observed and non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring will 
be conducted for at least 4 -8 hours post -dosing. Because younger children may not be able to 
verbalize complaints of dizziness or lightheadedness that are potentially associated with hypotension, study personnel and caregivers will be trained to recognize the signs of hypoten sion in 
this population, which may include tachycardia, pallor, diaphoresis, lethargy, delayed capillary refill, and poor feeding. Appropriate rigorous training will be required for parents and caregivers 
prior to daily injections at home. Training include s the storage, reconstitution, and administration of 
BMN  111, as well as documentation/reporting of AEs and vigilance for signs of hypotension.  
It is generally expected that after subjects are tolerating the drug well and specified criteria have been met, caregivers will begin administering study drug. Home health care is not required at any 
point but may be provided if the caregiver is unable or unavailable to administer the study drug. A 
Home Healthcare nurse will train the caregiver(s) if training has not been completed by the Day 3 visit. A phone call by the study staff member to the caregiver will be required weekly for 6 months 
and then every 2 weeks for the remainder of the study. During these contacts, study staff will ask the 
caregiver about dose administration and seek information on AEs and SAEs by specific questioning. If the caregiver cannot be contacted by phone after two attempts, con tact can be made via email.   
Safety will be evaluated by the incidence of AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), laboratory test results (urinalysis, chemistry, and hematology), vital signs, physical examination, ECG and 
echocardiogram, hip clinical assessment, and ant i-BMN 111 immunogenicity assessments.  Clinical 
laboratory tests, PK, immunogenicity and blood biomarker assessments will be limited to the 
minimum necessary for evaluation of safety and efficacy in order to minimize blood volume in the 
pediatric populatio n. 
Efficacy will be assessed by change from baseline in AGV and length/height Z-score. Exploratory 
assessments will include change from baseline in growth parameters and body proportions by 
anthropometry. X -rays will be performed of the lower extremities a nd spine to evaluate for changes 
in bone morphology, quality, and growth. An MRI will be performed to assess the effect of BMN 111 on skull and brain morphology, including foramen magnum, ventricular and brain parenchymal 
dimensions.  A board-certified, fe llowship -trained (or equivalent) pediatric anesthesiologist will 
administer anesthesia during MRI measurements in the event that the subject is unable to remain still for the duration of the scan. Sleep studies will be conducted to evaluate sleep apnea. Ad ditional 
assessments will be conducted to evaluate changes from baseline in bone metabolism and BMN111 pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and developmental/functional status.   
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS  PLANNED : Approximately 70 subjects, including at least 30 subject s 
in Cohort 1, at least 20 subjects in Cohort 2, and at least 20 subjects in Cohort 3.

• Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC 0-∞)  
• Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from 0 to the time of last measurable 
concentration (AUC 0-t) 
• Maximum plasma concentration (C max)  
• Time to reach C max (Tmax)  
• Elimination half -life (t 1/2)  
• Apparent clearance of drug (CL/F)  
• Apparent volume of distribution based upon the terminal phase (Vz/F)  
Drug accumulation after repeat -dose administration will also be evaluated. PK parameters at 
Week  13, 26, 39 and 52 will be compared to Day 1. The impact of immunogenicity (if present) on 
PK will also be evaluated.  
Bone metabolism and BMN 111 pharmacodynamic biomarkers:  
• Changes  in bone and collagen metabolism and BMN  111 activity will be assessed.  
Clinical outcome assessments:  
• Bayley -III  
• WeeFIM  
• CBCL  
• ITQOL  
Exploratory: The following exploratory measurements will be assessed:  
• Upper:lower body segment ratio  
• Imaging assessments (X-rays of the spine and lower extremities)  
• MRI to define skull and brain morphology (including dimensions of foramen magnum, 
ventricular and brain parenchymal dimensions)  
• Sleep study  
• Clinical photography  (optional)

STATISTICAL METHODS:  
Sample Size Determination: Approximately 7 0 subjects age 0 to < 60 months at study entry will 
participate in this study. No formal sample size calculations were performed. The number of subjects is considered appropriate to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BMN 111 in the target 
population.    
Safety Analysis: All su bjects who receive at least one dose of study treatment or who are 
randomized to the placebo -control group in this study will be included in the safety analysis. The 
safety analysis will be descriptive.  
All AEs will be coded using the most current version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) to assign system organ class and preferred term classification to event and 
disease, based on the original terms entered on the eCRF. The incidence of AEs will be summarized 
by system organ class, pr eferred term, relationship to study treatment as assessed by the 
investigator, seriousness, and severity. All AEs, including SAEs and AEs that lead to permanent 
discontinuation from the study and from the study treatment, will be listed. 
All other safety m easures including laboratory tests, vital signs, ECG, echocardiogram, hip clinical 
assessment, and concomitant medication data will also be summarized descriptively. Data 
summaries will be presented by treatment group (when applicable) for each cohort and overall. All 
safety results will be listed.  
Efficacy Analysis:  
All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study treatment or placebo in the study 
will be included in the efficacy analysis.  
Efficacy variables, including AGV (based on length/ height) and length/ height Z -score according to 
normal reference standards (not ACH), along with their change from baseline will be summarized 
by treatment group and cohort. Comparisons between treatment groups by cohort on these variables 
will be carried o ut where appropriate. Statistical comparisons will be considered descriptive. 95% 
CIs will be provided along with p values for treatment group comparisons.  
Sentinel subjects will be summarized apart for both efficacy and safety.

Investigators are expected to interact with independent Ethics Committees (IECs) promptly, as required, during the course of the study. This includes, but is not limited to, providing appropriate documentation to support study initiation and maintaining appropriate flow of safety and other information during the course of the study and for study close -out activities. 
BioMarin (or designee) will assist Investigators with access to timely and accurate information and with assurance of prompt resolution of any queries.  
Prior to initiating the study, the Investigator will obtain written confirmation that the institutional review board (IRB) or independent ethics committee (IEC), or Research Ethics Board (REB) is properly constituted  and compliant with International Conference on 
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements, applicable laws, and local regulations. A copy of the confirmation from the IRB/IEC/REB will be provided to BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BioMarin) or its designee.  
The Investigator will provide the IRB/IEC/REB with all appropriate material, including the protocol, Investigator’s Brochure (IB), the Informed Consent For m (ICF) including 
compensation procedures, and any other written information provided to the subjects, including all ICFs translated for subjects  who do not speak the local language at the clinical 
site. The study will not be initiated and Investigational Product (IP) supplies will not be shipped to the site until appropriate documents from the IRB/IEC/REB confirming 
unconditional approval of the protocol, the ICF and all subject recruitment materials are obtained in writing by the Investigator and copies a re received at BioMarin or its designee. 
The approval document should refer to the study by protocol title and BioMarin protocol 
number (if possible), identify the documents reviewed, and include the date of the review and 
approval. BioMarin will ensure th at the appropriate reports on the progress of the study are 
made to the IRB/IEC/REB and BioMarin by the Investigator in accordance with applicable guidance documents and governmental regulations.

7 INTRODUCTION  
BMN 111 is a proposed pharmacologic therapeutic option for ACH, the most common form 
of dwarfism.  
ACH is a rare disease with a prevalence of 1/25000 in the US ( Wynn, 2007)  The average 
adult heights for men and women with ACH are 131 cm and 124 cm, respectively (NIH,  Genetics Home Reference, 2012 ).  Characteristic features include long and narrow 
trunk, a large head with frontal bossing, hypoplasia of the mid- face, bowed leg s and stenosis 
of the foramen and spinal canals that can be life -threatening. Foramen magnum stenosis can 
lead to cervicomedullary compression in infants with complications including hydrocephalus, hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency, apnea, cyanotic epis odes, feeding problems, 
quadriparesis, and sudden death.  
There is no approved pharmacological therapy for achondroplasia in the US or EU. Current treatments for achondroplasia are focused on neurosurgical interventions for foramen magnum stenosis or lumba r stenosis, thoracolumbar braces to help ameliorate the kyphosis, 
or limb lengthening requiring multiple operations over 2 to 3 years (Shirley,  2009), 
(Horton, 2007).  
ACH is caused by a gain -of-function mutation in FGFR3, a negative regulator of 
chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.  The most common mutation (98%) in ACH patients is a G380R substitution in the transmembrane domain of FGFR3.  The majority of 
new cases (80%) originate from parents with normal stature.   
The extracellular signal- regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen -activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
pathway mediates part of FGFR3 inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation (Foldynova -Trantirkova, 2012).  The ERK MAPK pathway is modulated by CNP, a positive 
regulator of chondroc yte proliferation and differentiation.  Binding of CNP to the Natriuretic 
Peptide -Receptor B (NPR- B) antagonizes FGFR3 downstream signaling by inhibiting the 
MAPK (ERK1/2) pathway at the level of RAF -1 (Krejci, 2005); (Yasoda, 2004); 
(Yasoda,  2009); (Pejch alova, 2007).  This crosstalk was demonstrated in a mouse model of 
FGFR3 -related chondrodysplasia (Yasoda, 2004); (Yasoda, 2009).  The dwarfism phenotype 
of mice harboring the FGFR3G380R mutation was rescued by expression of CNP in cartilage or by the cont inuous administration of CNP (infusion).  
CNP is a member of the natriuretic peptide (NP) family that includes Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) and B -type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP). These peptides are structurally related 
but are distinct paracrine/autocrin e (CNP) or endocrine (ANP and BNP) factors that regulate 
the cardiovascular (CV), skeletal, nervous, reproductive and other systems. Synthetic analogs 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 39 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
of ANP (anaritide and carperitide) and BNP (nesiritide) have been investigated as potential 
therapies for  the treatment of decompensated heart failure and cardiovascular -related 
diseases.  
BMN 111 is a 39 -amino acid CNP analogue harboring the 37 amino acids of the human 
CNP53 C- terminal sequence and modified by the addition of two amino acids (Pro -Gly) on 
the N -terminus.  It is a recombinant human peptide fused to human transcription factor 
(TAF) and expressed as an inclusion body in E. coli.  BMN 111 is liberated and solubilized from the TAF -fusion protein by formic acid cleavage, and purified by column 
chroma tography ( Long, 2012).  BMN 111 was designed to 1) mimic CNP activities in terms 
of receptor binding and pharmacological activity and 2) be resistant to neutral endopeptidase (NEP) digestion in order to have an extended half -life in comparison to CNP that is 
presumed to increase exposure to the target growth plate ( Wendt, 2015).  
A comprehensive review of BMN 111 is contained in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by BioMarin.  Investigators are required to review the Investigator’s Brochure prior to initiating this study. 
7.1 Nonclinical Studies  
The pharmacological activity of BMN  111 was explored in two mouse models of ACH, a 
severe, Fgfr3Y367C/+ model ( Lorget, 2012), and a mild [Ach] /+ model.  Partial or complete 
reversion of the ACH phenotype was observed in these mouse models after 
BMN  111 
administration.  Additionally, in wild- type mice, and normal rats and monkeys, BMN 111 
administration resulted in growth plate expansion and dose -dependent skeletal growth at 
hemodynamically tolera ted dose levels ( Wendt, 2015).  
BMN 111- related adverse findings in nonclinical species (mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys) 
were limited to the known mechanism of action of CNP on the growth plate and vasculature.  
Reversible subcutaneous injection site react ions were reported, including injection site 
discoloration and microscopic findings of perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates that were seen with slightly higher incidence and severity in BMN 111- treated rats and monkeys 
compared to the vehicle control.  Adverse skeletal changes associated with exaggerated 
growth were seen in normal nonclinical species with open growth plates, and were dose -, 
exposure - and time -dependent. Decreases in blood pressure and compensatory increases in 
heart rate were detected in monkeys across multiple studies, with overt CV -related clinical 
signs observed in some animals at doses ≥ 236 µg/kg. These overt clinical signs consisted of 
transient, short and repeated bouts of sternal or lateral recumbency and/or reduced motor activi ty, typically within 1- hour post -dose administration.  Additional detailed information

about nonclinical studies of BMN 111 is provided in the current version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure supplied by BioMarin.   
7.2 Previous Clinical Studies  
7.2.1 Study 111 -101 
Study 111- 101, “A Phase 1, Two Part, Double Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study to Evaluate 
the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Single and Multiple Doses of BMN  111 
Administered to Healthy Adult Volunteers,” was a first- in-human study conducted in 2 parts 
to allow for assessment of the safety, tolerability, and PK of BMN 111 administered as a single dose and as a multiple dose to healthy adult male volunteers.  
Doses ranging from 5.0 µg/kg to 15.0 µg/kg were administered as a single daily SC dose; doses ranging from 0.5 µg/kg to 8.0 µg/kg were administered in the multiple ascending dose segment of the study. As expected, mild, transient, self -limited hypotension occurred. 
The majority of these cases were asymptomatic and observed upon assumption of an  upright 
posture following recumbence. Hypotension events were reported in the BMN 111 treatment groups with higher frequency compared with placebo. All events were judged to be mild in 
severity and resolved spontaneously without an intervention. These eve nts occurred across 
dose ranges.  Due to the limited number of events at each dose, it is unclear if symptomatic 
hypotension is dose related.  No dose limiting toxicities were identified outside of these cardiovascular events. The only AEs occurring in mor e than one subject receiving BMN  111 
were orthostatic hypotension, contact dermatitis, and back pain, and injection site reactions. 
Most AEs in the study were of mild severity, and no SAEs were reported. There  were no AEs 
that led to premature discontinuat ion of study drug.   
The PK parameters for BMN  111 were obtained from Part 1 of the study and from the first 
dose on Day 1 of the multiple dose study in Part 2. The results demonstrate that BMN 111 was rapidly absorbed in human, reaching a mean time to peak concentration (T
max) between 
15-26 minutes. After reaching maximal plasma concentrations, BMN 111 levels rapidly 
declined, with a t 1/2 of 40- 55 minutes. Mean plasma concentration -time profiles indicate that 
exposure increased with dose from 2.5 to 15 µg/kg. The corresponding increases in plasma 
Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) exposure parameters were greater than dose 
proportional. The increase in C max with dose was linear over the dose range evaluated.  
In Part 2, with multiple dosing at 5 µg/kg f or 10 days, the plasma concentration- time curves 
obtained on each of the three sampling days were nearly superimposable. Comparison of PK 
exposure parameters for AUC and C max indicate that C max is unchanged and AUC is

Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
increased slightly by +33% over Day 1.  Overall the results indicate that changes in 
BMN 111 exposure are minimal with repeat dosing out to 10 days. 
7.3 Ongoing Clinical Studies  
7.3.1 Study 111 -901 
Study 111- 901 is a multicenter, multinational study to collect serial growth measurements on 
pediatric sub jects with ACH who are being considered for subsequent enrollment in future 
studies sponsored by BioMarin. To obtain accurate baseline measurements, at least 6 months 
of growth data are collected.  
Data gathered from this study are used to characterize baseline growth data in children or 
infants (defined as children < 2 years of age) who may subsequently be enrolled in future studies sponsored by BioMarin, and may also be used to establish historical control cohort for use in other BioMarin- sponsored studie s, when appropriate. For that reason, data related 
to ACH symptoms, tests, and interventions are collected.  
7.3.2 Study 111 -202 
Study 111- 202 is an ongoing Phase 2, open- label, sequential cohort, dose escalation study 
that assesses daily SC administration of BMN  111 in pediatric subjects with ACH. 
The primary objective of Study 111- 202 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMN 111 
administered for 6  months and up to 24 months; the secondary objectives are to determine 
change from baseline in annualized gr owth velocity (AGV), growth parameters, body 
proportions, and evaluate the dose -exposure and PK profiles of BMN 111 in children with 
ACH.  
Analysis of safety data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111- 202 showed that 
treatment with BMN 111 for 6 mont hs at dose cohorts of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 µg/kg 
(Cohorts  1 to 4, respectively) was generally well tolerated. The most common AEs were mild 
injection site reactions, asymptomatic hypotension, headache, and nasopharyngitis. For a detailed summary of risks, please refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by BioMarin.  
Analysis of efficacy data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111- 202 demonstrated that 
the mean (standard deviation) change from baseline AGV when BMN 111 is adm inistered at 
2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 µg/kg subcutaneously daily for 6 months is -0.37 (1.592), 1.28 (1.439), 
2.01 (1.999), and 2.08 (2.137) cm/year, respectively.  Thus, a positive dose -dependent 
response was observed in change from baseline AGV at doses rang ing from 2.5- 15 µg/kg 
daily.

7.3.3 Study 111 -205 
Study 111- 205 is an ongoing open- label, Phase 2 extension study to assess long- term safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of BMN  111 in children with ACH. Subjects continue receiving the 
same stable dose of BMN 111 received upon completion of the 111- 202 study (up to 
30 µg/kg daily). This 5 -year study allows for long- term assessment of the effect of daily 
BMN 111 administration on safety, tolerability, growth velocity, height, and body proportions in subject completing 2 years of BMN 111 treatment in Study 111- 202 (7 years 
total BMN 111 treatment duration). Additional exploratory endpoints ar e being examined to 
determine long -term effects of BMN 111 on bone physiology and the medical complications 
of ACH.  
7.3.4 Study 111 -301 
Study 111- 301 is an ongoing Phase 3, double -blind, placebo -controlled multicenter study to 
further characterize and confirm ef ficacy and safety of BMN 111 at 15 µg/kg in a 58 -week 
study (up to 4 weeks of screening, 52 weeks of treatment, plus an additional 2 weeks of safety follow up). The study assesses the effect of daily BMN 111 administration on change from baseline in AGV, h eight, and body proportions in subjects treated with BMN 111 
compared with control subjects in the placebo group; and further characterizes safety and tolerability of BMN 111 in children with ACH. Additional exploratory endpoints are being 
examined to dete rmine the effect of BMN 111 on bone physiology and to assess quality of 
life and daily function of study subjects.  
7.3.5 Study 111 -302 
Study 111- 302 is an open- label Phase 3 extension study to further evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of BMN 111 either until subj ects reach near -final adult height (defined as evidence of 
growth plate closure and <  1.5 cm/yr annualized growth velocity), or  for 5 years if near -final 
adult height ( NFAH)  occurs prior to the end of the 5- year period.  All subjects will receive 
BMN 111 1 5 µg/kg. This study will allow for long- term assessment of the effect of daily 
BMN 111 administration on safety, tolerability, growth velocity, height, and body proportions in subjects who have completed 1 year of placebo or BMN 111 treatment in Study 111- 301.

7.4 Study Rationale  
BMN 111 is a recombinant CNP analogue that has been engineered to resist degradation by 
NEP, allowing for a longer half -life. 
The pharmacological activity of BMN 111 was explored in two mouse models of ACH, a severe, Fgfr3Y367C/+ (TD ) model ( Lorget, 2012), and a milder [Ach] /+ (Ach) model. These 
included studies in 7 -day old TD mice given BMN 111 daily by SC administration for up to 
20 days and a study in 3 week old Ach mice given BMN 111 daily by SC administration for 5 weeks. Parti al or complete reversion of the ACH phenotype was observed in these mouse 
models after BMN 111 administration. In wild -type mice, and normal rats and monkeys, 
BMN 111 administration resulted in growth plate expansion and dose -dependent skeletal 
growth at hemodynamically tolerated dose levels ( Wendt, 2015). Additionally, the potential 
effect of age on BMN 111 PK was evaluated in normal rats aged between 7 days and 12-13 weeks.  
Infants and young children with ACH have a high incidence of medical complications  and 
currently there is no approved pharmacological therapy for ACH in the US or EU. The most 
severe complication, cervicomedullary compression (CMC), occurs in a subset of subjects 
with ACH due to abnormal endochondral bone growth and narrowing of the for amen 
magnum ( White, 2016 ). CMC has been linked to serious respiratory and neurological 
complications including hypotonia, apnea, ataxia, developmental delay, and respiratory arrest associated with sudden death ( Mukherjee, 2014 ). Foramen magnum decompression surgery 
is currently the only treatment for this condition.   
Sleep apnea has also been extensively described in ACH, and sleep -disordered breathing may 
affect up to 85% of all children with ACH ( Ireland, 2012). This is thought to be due to 
midface hypoplasia, relative adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and potential posterior cranial fossa compression secondary to abnormal endochondral bone growth. Sleep apnea in ACH not only results in the need for surgical intervention, but has also been linked to sudden deat h in 
rare cases ( Pauli, 1984 ).   
Similarly, the dysregulation of endochondral bone growth in ACH leads to other medical 
complications which are prevalent in this subject population, such as the following:  
• Spinal stenosis, kyphosis, and lordosis (secondary to altered growth plate ossification 
in the vertebrae and narrowing of the interpedicular distances) ( Shirley, 2009)  
• Developmental delay of gross motor and ambulatory skills (associated with proximal 
limb shortening, macrocephaly, and hypotonia) ( Ireland, 2010)  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 44 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
• Delayed functional skills and increased need for caregiver assistance (eg, eating, 
bladder management, bowel management, transfer to chair, climbing stairs) (Ireland,  2011)  
Thus, BMN 111 may provide greater benefit when children begin treatment at a younger age, 
as earlier initiation of treatment allows a longer time window to improve growth and potential to improve medical complications of achondroplasia. This study (111- 206) is being 
conducted to assess safety and the potential benefit of BMN 111 in  infants and young 
children.   
BioMarin has engineered a CNP analog (BMN 111) that has a longer half -life than 
endogenous CNP, thereby allowing daily SC administration. Similar to CNP, BMN 111  
activates NPR -B signaling with subsequent inhibition of FGFR3 downstream signaling, 
leading to the promotion of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation and subsequent increased endochondral bone formation. BMN 111 administration has been shown to promote endochondral bone formation at hemodynamically tolerated dose levels in both normal animals and mouse models of ACH reported (refer to current Investigator ’s Brochure 
for additional information).  
Human studies to date have also demonstrated that BMN  111 is generally well tolerated at 
doses that result in improvements in growth velocity approaching that of children of average stature.  
Study 111- 202 is an ongoing Phase 2, open- label, sequential cohort, dose escalation study 
that assesses daily SC administration of BMN  111 in pediatric subjects with ACH, in which 
the primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMN  111 administered for 
6 months and up to 24 months and includes secondary objectives consisting of determination 
of ch ange from baseline in AGV, growth parameters, body proportions, and evaluation of the 
dose-exposure and PK profiles of BMN  111 in children with ACH.  
Analysis of safety data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111- 202 showed that 
treatment with BMN  111 was generally well tolerated at all dose levels (refer to current 
Investigators Brochure for specific details).  
Analysis of efficacy data from Study 111- 202 demonstrated that that subjects given 
BMN 111 at the dose of 15 µg/kg daily had an improvement in AGV, with approximately ~50% increase over baseline seen with treatment for 6 months which was sustained after continued treatment for 12 months.  
Subjects treated with 30 µg/kg daily also showed similar improvement in mean AGV after 
6 months and their me an changes from baseline in AGV were similar to subjects treated with 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 45 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
15 µg/kg daily. Safety data for the 30 -µg/kg daily dose was also similar to the 15 -µg/kg daily 
dose.  Given that no clinically significant difference could be identified between the 
15-µg/kg and 30- µg/kg daily dose in the Phase 2, 6- month safety and efficacy data, the lower 
of the two doses has been chosen for this Phase 2  study.  
Study 111- 206 is a Phase 2 randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial of 
BMN 111 in infants and younger children with a diagnosis of ACH who are age 0 to < 60 months. This 52- week study will enable assessment of BMN 111 safety, tolerability, 
pharmacodynamics biomarkers, and PK in this population, and also allow for examination of potential impact  on efficacy endpoints. Additional exploratory endpoints pertaining to 
medical complications of ACH will also be evaluated.  
7.5 Summary of Overall Risks and Benefits  
7.5.1 Summary of Risks from Nonclinical Studies  
Individuals in this study will be exposed to a reco mbinant analogue of human C -type 
natriuretic peptide (CNP). Based on the results of experimentation in animals, the most relevant potential toxicities relate to the expected pharmacological effects of exogenous CNP 
administration, including hemodynamic cha nges, skeletal overgrowth, and injection site 
reactions. Transient and sporadic decreases in blood pressure and compensating increases in 
heart rate occurred within the first hour post -dose in cynomolgus monkeys; the effects were 
mainly asymptomatic with a  subset of animals given doses ≥ 236 µg/kg observed with 
symptomatic effects consisting of transient, short and repeated bouts of sternal or lateral 
recumbency and/or reduced motor activity. These hemodynamic effects can be monitored, but have the potentia l to be an acute dose -limiting factor in patients.  Exaggerated 
appendicular bone responses to the drug included abnormally shaped femoral head, acetabular growth center/plate dysplasia and concomitant articular cartilage degeneration with clinical manifes tations of restricted use of hips. Adverse skeletal changes associated 
with exaggerated growth were dose -, exposure - and time -dependent. Additional detailed 
information about risks identified in nonclinical studies of BMN 111 is provided in the current ver sion of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by BioMarin.   
7.5.2 Summary of Risks from Clinical Studies  
7.5.2.1 Study 111 -101 
Based on review of the first -in-human Phase 1 study of BMN  111 in healthy adult volunteers, 
Study 111- 101, BMN 111 administered SC daily was well tolerated with doses ranging from 
0.5 µg/kg to 15 µg/kg. All AEs were of mild severity, and no SAEs were reported. The most common AE was mild, transient, self -limited orthostatic hypotension, of which the majority 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 46 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
of cases were asymptomatic and observed only upon assumption of an upright posture 
following recumbence. No dose -limiting toxicities were identified outside of these CV 
events.  
7.5.2.2 Ongoing Studies  
Based on analysis of safety data from ongoing phase 2 and 3 studies, treatment with BMN 111 was gener ally well tolerated. Injection site reactions were the most common 
adverse events reported and are considered to be an identified risk. All injection site reactions events have been reported as non -serious, Grade 1 in severity, and transient. Hypotension a nd 
hypersensitivity reactions including development of BMN 111 antibodies are potential risks associated with BMN 111 injections. For a detailed summary of risks, please refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by BioMarin.  
7.5.3 Summ ary of Potential Benefits from Clinical Studies  
For children with ACH who will receive BMN  111
 as part of Study 111- 206, potential 
benefits may include improvement of AGV rates such that their increase in growth velocity may approach that of children of average stature.  Additional potential benefits may include improvement of the disproportionate growth as well as improvement in quality of life, activities of daily living, and medical complications of ACH.  For example, improvement in height could have an impact on daily activity performance.

receive BMN 111, and at least 17 additional subjects randomized 1:1 to treatment or placebo control).  Treatment begins at  ≥ 3 months to <  6 months after 3 months of 
observation.  
If subjects who enroll in Cohort 3 are not able t o begin treatment by
 < 6 months of age, they 
will continue in the pretreatment period for another 3 months before  enrolling in Cohort 2 to 
fulfill the pretreatment requirement for Cohort 2.

Sentinel subjects from each cohort will be enrolled and studied for short -term safety and PK 
data, after which subjects in all 3 cohorts will be randomized to receive BMN 111 or  placebo 
SC daily (1:1 ratio) for up to 52 weeks. No two sentinel subjects will be dosed on the same 
day for any cohort.  At the start of the study, 3 sentinel subjects will be enrolled and monitored in Cohort 1. After all 3 sentinel subjects reach Day 8, the Sponsor will review and evaluate all available safety data and Day  1 PK data. Based on PK data and criteria set in the 
protocol, the dose may be adjusted for the sentinel subjects and the rest of the cohort, and will be the starting dose for the younge r cohort sentinel subjects.  Upon review of the clinical 
and PK data, the remainder of Cohort 1 (≥  27 additional subjects) will be enrolled and 
randomized to treatment with BMN 111 or placebo (1:1 ratio).  After the sentinel subjects complete 12 weeks of dosing, a DMC review will occur to evaluate all available safety and PK data.  Upon approval by the DMC, the next younger cohort (Cohort  2) will be opened and 
the 3 sentinel subjects will be enrolled.  
The same procedure will be followed for Cohort 2. After all 3 sentinel subjects reach Day 8, the Sponsor will review and evaluate all available safety data and Day  1 PK data. Based on 
PK data and criteria set in the protocol, the dose may be adjusted for the sentinel subjects and the rest of the cohort, and wil l be the starting dose for the younger cohort sentinel subjects.  
Upon review of the clinical and PK data, the remainder of Cohort 2 (≥  17 additional subjects) 
will be enrolled and randomized to treatment with BMN 111 or placebo (1:1 ratio). After the sentinel subjects complete 12 weeks of dosing, a DMC review will occur to evaluate all 
available safety and PK data.  Upon approval by the DMC, the youngest cohort (Cohort 3)

the rest of the cohort, and will be the starting dose for the younger cohort sentinel subjects.  Upon review of the clinical and PK data, the remainder of Cohort 3 (≥ 17 additional subjects) will be enrolled and randomized to treat ment with BMN 111 or placebo (1:1 ratio).  
Cohort 3 subjects must have a minimum of  3 months of observation prior to commencement 
of treatment.  These subjects will have the option to enroll in either 111- 901 or 111- 206, 
depending on age at enrollment:  
• Infants ≥ 3 months and  < 6 months old (≥ 13 weeks and < 26 weeks) will enroll in 
111-901 for a 6- month period of pretreatment growth assessment prior to enrollment 
in 111 206 for treatment in Cohort 2.  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 50 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
• Infants between birth and < 3 months old (0 weeks and < 13 weeks) will enroll into 
111-206 with a 3- month observational period prior to treatment. 
Additional sentinels may be added to any cohort if needed for additional safety and/or PK 
assessment.  
As subjects age on study, they will be administered the dose de termined to be appropriate for 
their current age.  For example, if a subject enrolls into Cohort 2 at age 20 months, they will 
receive the recommended dose for subjects aged ≥ 6 to  < 24 months until the y turn 24 months 
in age.  When they turn 24 months in age, they will begin to receive the recommended dose 
for subjects aged ≥ 24 to < 60 months. 
Each treated subject will have expanded outpatient safety monitoring for a minimum of 3 days of dosing, during which they will be closely observed and non- invasive hemodynamic 
monitoring will be conducted for at least 4- 8 hours post -dosing. Because younger children 
may not be able to verbalize complaints of dizziness or lightheadedness that are potentially associated with hypotension, study personnel and caregivers w ill be trained to recognize the 
signs of hypotension in this population, which may include tachycardia, pallor, diaphoresis, lethargy, delayed capillary refill, and poor feeding. Appropriate rigorous training will be required for parents and caregivers pri or to daily injections at home. Training includes the 
storage, reconstitution, and administration of BMN 111, as well as documentation/reporting of AEs and vigilance for signs of hypotension.  
It is generally expected that after subjects are tolerating the drug well and specified criteria have been met, caregivers will begin administering study drug. Home health care is not required at any point but may be provided if the caregiver is unable or unavailable to administer the study drug. A Home Healthcare nurs e will train the caregiver(s) if training has 
not been completed by the Day 3 visit. A phone call by the study staff member to the caregiver will be required weekly for 6 months and then every 2 weeks for the remainder of the study. During these contacts, study staff will ask the caregiver about dose administration 
and seek information on AEs and SAEs by specific questioning. If the caregiver cannot be contacted by phone after two attempts, contact can be made via email.   
Duration of the study is 52 weeks of treatment with a safety follow up at Week 56. Following 
completion of the study, subjects in all treatments groups may be eligible to receive BMN 111 in an open- label extension study, to assess safety and efficacy of BMN 111 over 
the longer term.  For s ubjects enrolling into the extension study, safety follow up visit at 
Week  56 will be waived.

a Clinic visits (except Days 1, 2, 3, and 8) have a ±  7-day window.  Anthropometric measurement and imaging assessments can be conducted either pre- dose or 
post-dose.  
b If the 111- 901 visit  at which the subject enter s Study 111 -206 and the 111- 206 Screening visit are on the same day, the procedu res common to  both visits  will 
be performed one time  only.  All blood tests at Screening visit should be obtained between Day -30 and Day -14. 
c Medical history, including growth history and ACH -related history, should elicit all major illnesses, diagnoses, and surgeries that the subject has ever had; any 
prior or existing medical conditions that might interfere with study participation or safety.  
d Standing height of the participant’s biological parents will be assessed.  Prior to the measurement being taken, each parent is required to complete an ICF 
specific to parent height assessment.  The ICF will be signed prior to the assessment, which can be done at any point in the study.  If biological parent is not 
available during the course of the study to take the ir standing height, the parent can provide their stated height instead if consent has been given.  
e If subjects had previous genetic testing, subjects must have a lab certification documenting the specific mutation required f or the 111- 206 study, including t he 
identification of FGFR3 mutation (G346E, G375C, G380R, or “other”).  
f Complete physical exam includes major body systems, including assessment of general appearance; CV; dermatologic; head, eyes,  ears, nose, and throat; 
lymphatic; respiratory; gastrointe stinal (GI); musculoskeletal; and neurological/psychological and genitourinary .

g All treatment visits have pre -dose vital sign assessments.  Vital signs at pre -dose include: body temperature in degrees Celsius (°C), heart rate, BP, and 
respiratory rate.  Po st-dose measurements include heart rate, BP, and respiratory rate.  
Vital Sign Assessment Frequency  
Screening  After at least 5  min of rest, subject’s vital signs are taken, preferably in sitting  or supine  position.  Vital sign measurements 
should be repeated and documented 3 times with at least 5 min intervals between assessments.   
 Assessment Frequency  
Dosing Visits  0-1 hr post -dose  0-2 hr post -dose  2-4 hr post dose  4-8 hr post -dose  
Days 1, 2   q 15 min (± 5 min)  q 30 min (± 5 min)  q 60 min (± 10 min)  
Days 3, 8   q 15 min (± 5 min)  q 30 min (± 5 min)   
Subsequent dosing visits  q 15 min (± 5 min);  
final assessment prior to end of 
visit (if longer than 1 hr)     
1. Vital sign measurements are taken once per time point, preferably in a sitting  or supine  position, after at least 5 minutes of rest.   
2. Heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate should be taken and recorded at each indicated time point.   
3. When blood samples and vital sign assessments are scheduled at the same time or within the same time window, vital signs shou ld be measured before blood samples are 
drawn.   
4. If a vital sign measurement must be taken after a blood draw, ensure adequate analgesia for the blood draw and wait several m inutes before measuring vital signs.   
5. Vital signs may be monitored more frequently or for longer durat ion post -dose as clinically indicated.  
6. If a subject has a hypotensive event, or signs potentially consistent with hypotension, or a decrease of 20 mm Hg systolic BP  or more from baseline (defined by pre -dose 
vitals collected that day), vital signs should b e measured and recorded approximately every 15 minutes (± 5  minutes) for the first hour and every 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) 
thereafter until the BP returns to baseline (or within the normal range for this subject as defined by PI) and signs (if pres ent) res olve.  
7. If the decision is made to adjust the dose, vital signs will be obtained for at least 4 hr following the first dose at the ad justed dose level, similar to the Day 3, 8 schedule.  
8. If a dose adjustment visit coincides with a visit at which a full PK is  drawn, vital signs will be obtained for 8 hours, similar to the Day 1,2 schedule.  
h A standard 12- lead ECG will include heart rate, rhythm, intervals, axis, conduction defects, and anatomic abnormalities. The time of collection will be 
recorded. ECGs shoul d be performed in triplicate with the subject supine at the visits indi cated in the Schedule of Events.  ECGs will be performed post -dose 
on study day visits at which a dose is given; in addition, on Day 1, ECGs will be performed pre -dose.  On days when PK samples are being drawn, ECGs 
should be performed within a 5- minute window prior to 30- minute PK assessment . 
i Echocardiogram is obtained at the early termination visit only if the previous assessment was done more than 3 months prior to early termin ation . 
j Growth measures may be collected in triplicate approximately the same time each day (± 2 hr around the time when the first measurement assessment was 
taken at Screening). Measurements may include but are not limited to length, standing height (if ab le to stand unsupported), crown- to-rump length, head 
circumference, upper and lower arm and leg, and arm span. Measurements not taken in the midsagittal plane should be taken on the right side of the body if possible and should always be taken on the same side of the body throughout the study.

k Clinical labs (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) are all pre -dose draws samples and can be drawn anytime during the visit if there is no drug 
administration.  
l Plasma samples will be collected pre- dose and at 5 (±  2 min), 15 (± 2 min), 30 (± 5 min), 45 (± 5 min), 60 (± 5 min), 90 (± 5 min), and 120 (± 5 min) minutes 
post-dose. On Day 1, additional PK samples will be collected at 180 (± 5 min) and 240 (± 5 min) minutes. Samples with volume remai ning after 
pharmacoki netic assessment will be used for cGMP pharmacodynamics assessment.   NOTE: In the event of interruption of study drug administration for a 
sentinel patient on Day 1 when PK samples are scheduled, the collection of PK samples should be delayed until the sub sequent day and only performed after 
successful administration of study drug has been completed in a single injection.  
m Antibodies:  Total anti- BMN 111 (TAb) , TAb cross -reacting with endogenous natriuretic peptides,  and neutralizing antibody (NAb) samples ( serum) will be 
drawn pre -dose at each time point listed on the SOE. TAb cross -reacting with endogenous natriuretic peptides and NAb testing will be performed only on  
baseline and  TAb positive samples from subjects weighing ≥  7.0 kg and waived for subjects < 7.0 kg.  Drug -specific IgE will be drawn pre -dose on Day 1 for 
subjects weighing ≥ 7.0 kg and waived for subjects < 7.0 kg to stay within the limits of permitted blood volume collections in infants. Total immunoglobulin E 
(IgE) and drug -specific IgE will be drawn in the event of Grade 3 hypersensitivity adverse event) or at Investigator or Sponsor discretion. If such an event 
occurs, the drug -specific IgE sample should be drawn at least 8 hours after the event start time or before the next dose. A sample f or total IgE and serum 
tryptase should be drawn within an hour of the start of the event when possible or during an unscheduled safety visit.  
n Bone metabolism blood biomarkers will be waived at screening for subjects weighing <  7.0 kg to limit the blood vo lume on the smallest subjects at this visit. 
Serum samples for bone metabolism biomarkers will be collected pre -dose on the indicated visits. Bone metabolism blood biomarkers include bone -specific 
alkaline phosphatase and collagen type X.  
o Urine biomarkers and urine chemistry (urine creatinine test) should be obtained pre-  and post -dose (approximately 2- 4 hours after study drug administration) 
for subjects when possible at the indicated visits. The time of collection will be recorded. Urine biomarkers includ e cGMP and C -terminal telopeptide of cross -
linked collagen type II (CTX -II). 
p Hip monitoring: this assessment will include medical history of the hip and physical exam to determine changes in hip functio n or pain with hip range of 
motion. Adverse changes fr om baseline will trigger further evaluation.  
q MRI is o btained at the early termination visit only if the previous assessment was done more than 3 months prior to early termination  (unless additional study is 
recommended by Investigator, BioMarin, or DMC).  Efforts to obtain a satisfactory image can be discontinued  after 3 unsuccessful attempts .   
r If sleep study is uninterpretable, subject may need to repeat assessment.  Obtained at the early termination visit only if th e previous assessment was done mo re 
than 3 months prior to early termination (unless additional study is recommended by Investigator, BioMarin, or DMC).  
s WeeFim is waived for children < 6 months old; CBCL  is waived for children  < 18 months old.  
t AP lumbar, lateral lumbar, and AP lower extr emities are obtained at the early termination visit only if the previous assessment was done more than 6 months 
prior to early termination (unless additional study is recommended by Investigator, BioMarin, or DMC). AP lower extremities X -ray at the Week 52  visit is 
waived for subjects who cannot stand upright unsupported.   Although X -rays are preferable for consistency across the study population, if there are IRBs or 
IECs unwilling to a llow x -rays in C ohort 3 subjects, contact the MM to discuss alternate n on-radiological methods for assessment.  
u To document the  physical and phenotypic findings of  achondroplasia with and without treatment with study drug, clinical photography of the full body, face, 
spine, and extremities will be conducted. This assessment is  optional. If the parents/caregivers decline clinical photography, the assessment will be waived for 
the duration of the study.  
v The injection site should be rotated as described in the BMN -111 Injection Guide.  Following administration of each dose at clinic visits, subjects should be 
observed for 8 hours after the injection on Days 1 and 2; 4 hours on Days 3 and 8; and 1 hour on subsequent dosing visits. Su bjects should be observed for 
30 minutes after every injection that is not administered at the clinic . If interruption of study drug injection occurs, the remainder of the assigned dose should be

drug should be used to draw the remainder of the dose.  
w After written informed consent but before study treatment initiation, only SAEs associated with protocol- imposed interventions will be recorded. After study 
drug initiation, all AEs and SAEs will b e recorded until 4 weeks after either the last administration of study drug or the Early Termination visit. If a subject is 
discontinued from the study prematurely, AEs and SAEs will be recorded at the Early Termination visit.   
x All medications (prescription, over -the-counter, herbal, topical) and nutritional supplements taken 30 days prior to screening and throughout the study should 
be documented.  
y During the call study staff will ask the caregiver about correct administration procedures, record adverse ev ents (AEs), record concomitant medications, and 
answer questions.

c Vital signs will be measured with appropriate blood pressure cuffs for achondroplasia children following detailed instruction s in Study Reference Manual. At 
screening, blood pressure should be taken with subject in a supine  position, after the subject has been resting for at least 5 minutes. At all other visits,  blood 
pressure should be taken one time after at least 5 minutes of rest, with subject in a supine position. Heart rate should be taken at each time point that blood 
pressure is measured. Left brachial arm should be the first method of assessment considered, and the same site should be used  for blood pressure measurement 
in each subject th roughout the study. The method and site of blood pressure measurement will be recorded and should be utilized consistently th roughout the 
remainder of the study.

9.1.1 Dose Adjustments  
Analysis of available PK data from studies 111 -101 and 111- 202 indicated that differences in 
subject body weight did not directly translate to differences in total body clearance of 
BMN 111.  The same weight -based dose in the pediatric population of Study 111- 202 
(5-12 years old) yielded lower exposure ( Cmax and AUC) than that characterized in the adult 
population of Study 111- 101.  Therefore, the same weight -based dose in the young pediatric 
population in this study may yield exposure less than the target exposure range characterized to be safe and effective in Study 111- 202 at the 15- µg/kg dose. Since this is the first 
experience with BMN 111 in this young pediatric population, it is also possible the exposure at 15 μg/kg could be greater than the target exposure range, and dose adjustment may be warranted. Thus, an option for adjustment of the weight -based dose is provided to ensure that 
the appropriate target exposure for safety and efficacy is reached for the young s ubjects in 
this study.   
The need for dose adjustment will be evaluated as follows: three sentinel subjects in Cohort 1 will receive an initial dose of 15 µg/kg. After all three sentinel subjects reach Day 8, the Sponsor will review and evaluate all available safety and PK data (at minimum). If the 
criteria for dose adjustment are met, the three sentinel subjects will be started on the new adjusted dose at their next scheduled visit, and vital signs will be obtained for at least 4 hours post-dose.  
The remai nder of the subjects in the age cohort will also be enrolled starting at the new 
adjusted dose. After the third sentinel subject reaches Week 12  post dose adjustment, a DMC 
review will occur to evaluate all safety and PK data and, upon endorsement, the thr ee 
sentinel subjects from the next younger cohort will be enrolled starting at the new adjusted dose.  The three sentinel subjects for the second and third cohorts will be evaluated similarly to the sentinel subjects in the first cohort for potential dose adjustment.  
As subjects age on study, they will be administered the dose determined to be appropriate for their current age.  For example, if a subject enrolls into Cohort 2 at age 20 months, they will receive the recommended dose for subjects aged 
≥ 6 to  < 24 months until the y turn 24 months 
in age.  When they turn 24 months in age, they will begin to receive the recommended dose for subjects aged 
≥ 24 to < 60 months. 
Criteria for Dose Adjustment  
The criteria for dose adjustment are based on obtaining equi valent exposure characterized to 
be safe and effective with the 15 -μg/kg dose in Study 111- 202 in each of the age cohorts 
evaluated in this study. BMN 111 dose may be adjusted if the mean observed AUC 0-120 from 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 61 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
sentinel subjects is less than the 25th percentile for AUC 0-120 in Cohort 3 (15 μg/kg) of Study 
111-202 or greater than the 75th percentile in Cohort 3 of Study 111- 202. If these criteria are 
met, an allometric scaling coefficient, α, for BMN 111 clearance by subject body weight will 
be determined us ing a population PK modelling approach and available data from this study 
and Studies 111- 202 and 111- 101. The recommended adjusted dose will be determined using 
the following expression:  
  
where WT ref and Dose ref are the typical (i.e., median) subject body weight and total dose, 
respectively, at the 15 μg/kg dose level in Cohort 3 of Study 111- 202, and WT ch is the 
anticipated median weight in the age cohort being studied. As such, the recommended adjusted dose will target the median AUC
0-120 observed at t he 15 μg/kg dose level of Study 
111-202. The recommended adjusted dose, Dose ch, will be normalized by WT ch, to provide 
the recommended adjusted weight -based dose. The following rules will be used for dose 
adjustment:  
• A maximum of a 2 -fold increase in dose/ kg will be permitted between dose 
adjustments regardless of exposure.  
• The total dose will not exceed the highest total dose administered in Study 111- 202. 
9.1.2 Stopping Criteria  
Individual Subject Stopping Criteria  
For individual subjects treated with BMN 111, DMC will be informed if any of the following individual subject stopping criteria should occur. Temporary dosing suspension, permanent 
discontinuation of dosing, or dose reduction for the individual subject will be considered. 
• Any treatment -emergent adver se event (AE) assessed as at least Grade 4 by the 
Investigator and/or Sponsor Medical Monitor  
• Any treatment -emergent AE of at least Grade 3 assessed as related to study drug by 
the Investigator and/or Sponsor Medical Monitor  
• Any two treatment -emergent Gr ade 2 symptomatic hypotension events within 7 days 
(non- urgent medical intervention indicated) or any Grade 3 hypotensive event (urgent 
medical intervention or hospitalization indicated) assessed by the Investigator and/or 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor  
• Clinically significant finding or arrhythmia on ECG that indicates abnormal cardiac 
function or conduction or prolongation of QTc -F >500 msec

Sponsor Medical Monitor and or thopedic specialist (if needed)  
If the subject meets any stopping criterion, after Investigator consultation with the BioMarin 
Medical Monitor and DMC, the subject may be re- challenged at the same dose. If the subject 
meets stopping criteria on re -challenge or if re -challenge at same dose is not clinically 
indicated, other options that may be considered include:  
• Re-challenge at lower dose with consideration given to upward titration to tolerated 
dose  
• Permanent treatment  discontinuation (with an option of ongoing assessment in the 
study)   
Cohort Stopping Criteria  
For each cohort, a DMC review will be conducted if any of the following cohort stopping criteria occur in subjects treated with BMN 111.  Temporary dosing suspe nsion, permanent 
discontinuation of dosing, or dose reduction for the cohort(s) will be considered and the impact on all other age cohorts will be assessed.  
• Any treatment -emergent AE assessed as at least Grade 4 by the Investigator and/or 
Sponsor Medical Monitor  
• Any two subjects have a treatment -emergent AE of at least Grade 3 assessed as 
related to study drug by the Investigator and/or Sponsor Medical Monitor  
• Any two subjects have two treatment -emergent Grade 2 symptomatic hypotension 
events within 7 da ys (non- urgent medical intervention indicated) or any two subjects 
cohort have a Grade 3 hypotensive event (urgent medical intervention or 
hospitalization indicated) assessed by the Investigator and/or Sponsor’s Medical Monitor  
• Any two subjects have a cli nically significant finding or arrhythmia on ECG that 
indicates abnormal cardiac function or conduction or prolongation of QTc-F >500 msec 
• Any two subjects have adverse findings on clinical hip exam or hip imaging 
assessments that are determined to be clin ically significant as decided by principal 
investigator and in consultation with Sponsor medical monitor and orthopedic 
specialist (if needed)

9.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Group 
Study 111- 206 is a Phase 2 randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial of 
BMN 111 in infants and younger children with a diagnosis of ACH who are age 0 to 
< 60 months. Identification of efficacy at this age range is congruent with mechanism of 
action of BMN 111, because BMN 111 is expected to act at open epiphyseal growth plates. Therefore, to have a potential therapeutic benefit for subjects with ACH, treatment is expected to be required prior to epiphyseal growth plate closure.  
In terms of the study design, a randomized double -blind place bo control will be used to 
mitigate the risk of selection bias and any potential bias in data collection and study conduct.  Additionally, this design provides a framework for interpretation of any endpoints with a  
subjective component, e.g. HRQO L and ADL questionnaires and any subjective assessment 
of safety.  
9.3 Selection of Study Population  
Subjects age 0 months to
 < 60 months old, with documented ACH confirmed by genetic 
testing, and who meet the study eligibility criteria will participate.

9.3.6 Removal of Subjects from Treatment or Assessment  
Subjects (or their legally authorized representative) may withdraw their consent to participate 
in the study at any time without prejudice. The Investigator must withdraw from the study any subject who requests to be withdrawn. A subject’s participation in the study may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator and in accordance with his/her clinical judgment. When possible , the tests and evaluations listed for the termination visit 
should be carried out.  BioMarin must be notified of all subject withdrawals as soon as possible.  
Investigators may discontinue administration of BMN  111 or placebo at any time. Reasons 
for whic h the investigator or BioMarin will withdraw a subject from study treatment include, 
but are not limited to, the following:  
1. Subject experiences a serious or intolerable AE due to BMN 111 as determined by the 
subject, investigator, or sponsor  
2. Subject requi res medication or medical procedure prohibited by the protocol  
3. Subject does not adhere to study requirements specified in the protocol  
4. Subject is lost to follow -up 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 69 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
If a subject fails to return for scheduled visits, a documented effort must be made to 
deter mine the reason. If the subject cannot be reached by telephone, a certified letter should 
be sent to the subject (or the subject’s legally authorized representative, if appropriate) requesting contact with the Investigator. This information should be recor ded in the study 
records.  
The Investigator or designee must  explain to each subject, before enrollment into the study, 
that for evaluation of study results, the subject’s protected health information obtained during the study may be shared with the study sponsor, regulatory agencies, and IRB/IEC/REB. It is the Investigator’s (or designee’s) responsibility to obtain written permission to use protected health information per country- specific regulations, such as HIPAA in the US, from each 
subject, or if appr opriate, the subject’s legally authorized representative. If permission to use 
protected health information is withdrawn, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to obtain a written request, to ensure that no further data will be collected from the subject  and the 
subject will be removed from the study. 
It is a priority of the study to maximize study subject retention and adherence to 
study- specific procedures. The completeness of the study data may affect the integrity and 
accuracy of the study results.  T herefore, subjects who discontinue study treatment should be 
encouraged to continue to undergo as many of the protocol -specified procedures and 
assessments as possible for the remainder of the study, as long as such continued 
participation does not detrime ntally affect the health, safety, or welfare of the subject.   
For subjects who discontinue BMN  111 or placebo but remain in the study, PK and 
BMN 111 activity assessments will be waived completely; vital signs and clinical labs/biomarkers will be obtained  only once at each visit subsequent to BMN  111 or placebo 
discontinuation.  Pre -and post -dose designations will not apply as the subject has 
discontinued dosing and vital sign and clinical lab/biomarkers assessments previously designated as “post -dose” wil l be waived.  All other assessments at each visit should be 
completed if possible and the subject is willing.  Data from the study procedures and assessments may be used to further characterize the natural progression of ACH.  
BioMarin reserves the right t o discontinue the study at any time.  Premature termination of 
the study may occur because of regulatory authority decision, a change in the opinion of the IRB/IEC/REB, clinical or safety reasons, or at the discretion of the Sponsor.   The Sponsor 
reserves the right to discontinue the development of BMN 111 at any time, or to discontinue participation by an individual Investigator or site for poor enrollment or noncompliance.  Any decision to terminate the study will be promptly communicated to Investigators , regulatory authorities, and IRB/IEC/REB.   The Investigator is responsible for 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 70 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
communicating any decision to terminate a study to hospital staff involved in the conduct of 
the study and the participating subjects (and their families).  
9.3.7 Subject Identification  
Each subject will be assigned a unique subject identifier. This unique identifier will be on all eCRF pages. In legal jurisdictions where use of initials is not permitted, a substitute identifier will be used.  
9.3.8 Duration of Subject Participat ion 
Duration of the study is 52 w eeks of treatment with a safety follow up at Week 56. Following 
completion of the study, subjects in both treatments groups may be eligible to receive BMN 111 in an open- label extension study, to assess safety and efficacy of BMN 111 over 
the longer term.  For subjects enrolling into the extension study, safety follow up visit at Week 56 will be waived.  
Subjects who are not eligible to receive BMN 111 in a separate study will return at Week 56 for the Safety Follow -Up visit  to assess for any AEs that may have occurred following 
completion of dosing. 
Follow -up assessments and procedures should be performed as outlined in the Study 111- 206 
Schedule of Events ( Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2).  
Subjects who discontinue from study treatment will be asked to complete study assessments 
and proc edures for the remainder of the study.  If subjects discontinue from study treatment 
and decline to participate for the remainder of the study, they will be asked to return for a 
final follow -up visit 4 weeks after their last dose , and the agreement should be documented.  
Subjects will participate in the study until completion or until one of the following occurs: 
the subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study, the subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the investigator or BioMarin (upon consultation and in agreement with the investigator) or the study is terminated.  
9.4 Treatments  
9.4.1 Treatments Administered  
BioMarin and/or its designee will provide the study site with a supply of IP sufficient for the 
completion of the study.  
Sentinel subjects will receive BMN 111 at a daily dose of 15  µg/kg ( subject to adjustment 
per protocol). S ubjects will be randomized to BMN  111
 at a daily dose of 15 µg/kg (subject 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 71 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
to adjustment per protocol) or placebo for the duration of the study. The norm al dosing 
schedule is a single daily subcutaneous injection given 7 days a week.  
If a recent acute illness associated with volume depletion (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) 
has not completely resolved prior to the first dose of BMN  111 or placebo, the dosing will be 
delayed until hydration status has improved (up to the maximum period allowed for the visit window). 
9.4.1.1 Study Drug Administration  
During the study, BMN 111 or placebo will be administered as a single 15 µg/kg SC 
injection given daily at approximately the same time each day whenever possible.  Determination of appropriate injection sites will be left to the discretion of the investigator.  The same injection site should not be used 2 days in a row, and sites should be rotated.  Study drug should be administered at age -appropriate locations (upper thigh, upper back of 
arm, abdomen or buttocks). Doses may be administered in any of the common SC areas (upper arm, thigh, abdomen, buttocks).  Following administration of each dose at clinic visits, subjects should be observed for 8 hours after the injection on Days 1 and 2; 4 hours on 
Days 3 and 8; and 1 hour on subsequent dosing visits. Subjects should be observed for 30 minutes  after every injection that is not administered at the clinic.  Instr uctions for home 
administration of BMN  111 or placebo for subjects who qualify for parent/caregiver 
administration are provided in the Study Drug Injection Guide and Injection media . 
9.4.2 Identity of BMN 111  
BMN 111
 is cloned into the pJexpress401 vector, expre ssed in E. coli and then purified. 
The drug substance is a modified CNP peptide that retains wild -type activity and specificity. 
The modified CNP sequence is:  
PGQEHPNARKYKGANKKGLSKGCFGLKLDRIGSMSGLGC  
The amino acid sequence is an analogue of the naturally occurring tissue -expressed form of 
C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP -53). BMN 111  is a recombinant 39 amino acid peptide that 
includes the 37 C -terminal amino acids of the human CNP -53 sequence, and is engineered to 
include two additional amino acids (Pro- Gly) on the N -terminus, which renders the peptide 
more resistant to degradation. It is a cyclic peptide formed by an intramolecular disulfide bond. The molecular weight of the purified product is 4.1 kDa. 
9.4.2.1 Product Characteristics and Labeling  
The clinical drug  product will be supplied in sterile, single -dose, Type I glass vials with

intake  prior to dosing.  All subjects should have been well hydrated and fed in the hour  prior 
to administration of BMN 111  or placebo. 
Caregivers will administer BMN  111 or placebo at home once approved by the investigator 
and adequate training is demonstrated. Instructions on how  to complete and document the 
training can be found in the Study Reference Manual.   
A caregiver will be eligible to administer BMN  111 or placebo if he or she meets all of the 
following criteria:  
• The subject has been on a stable dosing regimen for a minim um of 3 days  
• PI has approved administration of BMN 111 or placebo by the caregiver  
• The caregiver has completed the Administration Training conducted by qualified 
study site personnel and has been observed by the study site personnel to be able to adequate ly prepare the proper dose and perform the injections safely  
For dosing between planned clinic visits prior to caregiver approval, a home health nurse 
may administer BMN  111 or placebo, or subjects may be administered BMN  111 or placebo 
in the clinic by study staff or trained caregiver.   
The caregiver will be provided with a study diary and will be asked to record daily dosing information, changes in health status, medications and injection sites used, date and time of the injection, and injection site rea ctions, if any. 
A subject’s suitability for continued at -home drug administration will be evaluated by the 
investigator and the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor if a subject experiences a CTCAE Grade 3 or higher AE that is considered possibly or probably drug- related, and/or a hypersensitivity 
reaction during the study.   
9.4.5 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1  ratio, i.e., injection with placebo:15 µg/kg of BMN  111, 
using I XRS.  An independent third- party vendor will develop the randomization schedule so 
that BioMarin and site personnel are blinded to treatment assignments.   NOTE: In Japan, 
subjects are randomized separately within each cohort.  
9.4.6 Selection of Dose and Dosing Schedule  Used in the Study  
Study 111- 202, the second clinical trial in humans and the first in children with ACH, is an 
ongoing Phase 2, open- label, sequential -cohort, dose -escalation study that assesses daily SC 
BMN 111 in pediatric subjects with ACH aged 5 -14 years with doses rang ing from 2.5 µg/kg 
to 30 µg/kg.  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 74 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
Analysis of safety data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111- 202 showed that 
treatment with BMN 111 for 6 months at the doses of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 µg/kg was 
generally well tolerated. The most common AEs across all  cohorts were injection site 
reactions, asymptomatic hypotension, headache, and nasopharyngitis. Based on previous experience of the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial, including the 24- month data cut at 15 µg/kg, 
injection site reactions have been identified as risks associated with BMN 111 injections. For a detailed summary of risks, please refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by BioMarin.  
Analysis of efficacy data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111- 202 showed that 
subjects treated with BMN 111 for 6 months at doses ranging from 2.5 to 15 µg/kg daily had 
a dose -dependent improvement in AGV, with ~50% improvement in AGV seen at the 
15 µg/kg dose. The data from Cohort 4 (30 µg/kg) show an apparent greater than dose -
proportional increase in BMN 111 plasma exposure (C
max and AUC 0-t), with a marginal 
improvement in both absolute AGV and change from baseline AGV after 6 months of 
BMN 111 treatment when compared with Cohort 3 (15 µg/kg). 
Efficacy/toxicity studies have been con ducted in neonatal and very young animals (7- day 
postpartum mouse and rat) in both a disease (TD mouse) and non- disease (rat) model. 
Given  that this is the first study in infants and young children, an age -based cohort study 
design is used to assess safety  and PK in young children (Cohort 1, ≥ 24 to < 60 months) 
prior to dosing toddlers (Cohort 2, ≥ 6 to < 24 months) and infants (Cohort 3, 
0 to  <  6 months). PK will be monitored and evaluated; Day 1 PK data from the sentinel 
subjects will inform dose selec tion modification for the sentinel subjects and for the rest of 
the cohort to target the observed exposure of the 15- µg/kg dose group in Study 111- 202. 
Safety, efficacy and PK data from Study 111- 202, a Phase 2 study in children with ACH, 
where a dose of 15 µg/kg has been and continues to be studied, are expected to be the most 
relevant, and translatable to this study (111 -206).   
9.4.6.1 Selection of Timing of Dose for Each Subject  
9.4.7 Blinding  
An independent third- party vendor will develop the randomization schedule so that BioMarin 
and site personnel will not know treatment assignments. BMN  111 or placebo will be labeled 
with the study number and a unique identification number. Subjects and the participating site members will be blinded to the  two study treatments ( BMN 111 or placebo).  
The investigator and other members of staff involved with the study will remain blinded to the treatment randomization code during the assembly procedure. In the event of an 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 75 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
emergency medical situation where subject management would be determined or 
significantly altered by knowing the treatment assignment, the investigator may be unblinded without prior written approval from the Medical Monitor.  Following such an emergency unblinding, the investigator will contact the medical monitor and provide written rationale according to the unscheduled unblinding procedure set forth in the Study Manual.  The Medical Monitor will review the rationale, evaluate whether there are any additional 
safety considerations that need to be implemented for t he subject and/or the study, and 
determine whether the investigator requires further guidance on unblinding.  The Medical Monitor may also communicate with the investigator advice on the care of the subject and define the plan for the subject’s future part icipation in the study. 
9.4.8 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All medications (prescription, over -the-counter [OTC] and herbal), and nutritional 
supplements 30 days prior to screening and throughout the study will be recorded on the designated eCRF.  The Inves tigator may prescribe additional medications during the study, as 
long as the prescribed medication is not prohibited by the protocol. In the event of an 
emergency, any needed medications may be prescribed without prior approval, but the 
medical monitor mu st be notified of the use of any contraindicated medications immediately 
thereafter. Any concomitant medications added or discontinued during the study should be recorded on the eCRF. 
9.4.9 Treatment Compliance  
Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused BMN  111 or placebo kits at each 
study visit. Subject compliance with the dosing regimen will be assessed by reconciliation of 
the used and unused vials. The quantity dispensed, returned, used, lost, etc. must be recorded on the dispensing log provided for the study.  
The date, time, and volume of each dose of BMN 111 or placebo administered to each subject must be recorded. These data will be used to assess treatment compliance.  
9.5 Investigational Product Accountability (BMN  111 or Placebo)  
The Investig ator or designee is responsible for maintaining accurate records (including dates 
and quantities) of IP(s) received, subjects to whom IP is dispensed (subject -by-subject dose 
specific accounting), and IP lost or accidentally or deliberately destroyed. The Investigator or designee must retain all unused or expired study supplies until the study monitor (on- site 
CRA) has confirmed the accountability data.  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 76 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
9.5.1 Return and Disposition of Clinical Supplies  
Unused BMN  111 or placebo must be kept in a secure location f or accountability and 
reconciliation by the study monitor. The Investigator or designee must provide an 
explanation for any destroyed or missing BMN  111 or placebo kits/vials.  
Unused BMN  111 or placebo may be destroyed on site, per the site’s standard oper ating 
procedures, but only after BioMarin has granted approval for destruction. The study monitor must account for all BMN 111 or placebo kits/vials in a formal reconciliation process prior to destruction. The site must document all BMN  111 or placebo dest royed on site, and 
documentation must be provided to BioMarin and retained in the investigator study files. If a site is unable to destroy BMN  111 or placebo appropriately, the site can, upon request, return 
unused BMN  111 or placebo to the BioMarin contra cted facility. The return of all BMN  111 
or placebo kits/vials must also be documented and accounted for per instructions provided by BioMarin.  
All BMN 111 or placebo and related materials should be stored, inventoried, reconciled, and destroyed or returne d according to applicable state and federal regulations and study 
procedures.  
9.6 Dietary or Other Protocol Restrictions  
BMN 111
 will be administered as a single daily dose of 15  µg/kg SC injection given daily at 
approximately the same time each day whenever possible. Placebo will be administered as a single SC injection given daily at approximately the same time each day whenever p ossible. 
Following administration of each dose, subjects will be observed for at least 2 hours after the injection for observation for Days 1 to 3, and 30 minutes for all other days of dose administration.  
Subjects should have adequate food intake  prior t o dosing.  All subjects should have been 
well hydrated and fed in the hour prior to administration of BMN 111
 or placebo.  
9.7 Demographic Data and Medical History  
Demographic data and a detailed medical history will be obtained at Screening. This medical 
history, including growth history and ACH -related history, should elicit all major illnesses, 
diagnoses, and surgeries that the subject has ever had; any prior or existing medical conditions that might interfere with study participation or safety; and evaluati on for knee, 
thigh, hip or groin pain, or change in gait/activity.

Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
9.8 Biological Parental Standing Height 
Standing height of the subject’s biological parents may be assessed (optional) via height 
measurement or stated height. Height measurement can be done at any point in the study.  Prior to the measurement being taken, each parent is required to complete an ICF specific to parent height assessment.  The ICF will be signed prior to the assessment, which can be done at any point in the study. If the biologic al parent is not available during the course of the 
study to take his/her standing height, if consented, the biological parent can provide his/her stated height.  
9.9 Physical Examination Findings  
Physical examination will include assessment of general appearance; CV; dermatologic; 
head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; lymphatic; respiratory; GI; musculoskeletal; and neurological/psychological and genitourinary. Other body systems may be examined. Screening results will be the baseline values and clinicall y significant changes from baseline 
will be recorded as an AE or SAE and study drug related or unrelated when appropriate based on the investigator’s clinical judgment. 
9.10 Echocardiogram  
Cardiac anatomy and function will be evaluated by a standard 2- dimensional Doppler 
echocardiogram by a cardiologist. Echocardiograms will be performed at screening, and 
provide information regarding cardiac anatomy and function prior to enrollment in the study.  
9.11 Efficacy and Safety Variables  
9.11.1 Efficacy  and Safety Measurements Assessed  
The Schedule of Events ( Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2) describes the timing of required 
evaluations.
 
9.11.2 Primary Efficacy Variables  
The primary efficacy endpoint is  change from baseline in length/ height Z -score.  
Growth measures may be collected appr oximately the same time each visit (± 2 hr from the 
time when the first measurement assessment was taken at Screening) by a study staff member, preferably the same person throughout the study, who has been trained by a 
BioMarin representative. Standardized  measuring equipment and detailed measurement 
techniques are detailed in the Anthropometric Measurement Guidelines.  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 78 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
9.11.3 Secondary Efficacy Variables  
The secondary efficacy endpoints include change from baseline in AGV (annualized to 
cm/yr), biomarker samples to evaluate the effect of BMN 111 on bone metabolism, and BMN 111 pharmacodynamic biomarkers.  
Weight will be measured at Screening and at study visits as indicated on the Schedule of Events ( Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2).  
Biomarkers may include but are not limited to assessment of changes in bone and collagen metabolism (serum bone -specific alkaline phosphatase, serum collagen type X, and urine 
C-terminal te lopeptide of collagen type II [CTX -II]) and BMN  111
 bioactivity (plasma and 
urine cGMP). BioMarin or designee will perform analysis, and samples may also be used for assay development.   
Samples for blood and/or urine biomarkers will be collected at the ti me points presented in 
the Schedule of Events ( Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2). Refer to the Study Laboratory Manual 
for instructions regarding obtaining and shipping samples. The sample type will also be 
included in the Study Laboratory Manual.  
9.11.4 Exploratory Efficacy Variables  
9.11.4.1 Body Proportion Ratios of the Extremities  
Change from base line in body proportion ratios of the extremities will be evaluated using 
anthropometric measurements and measurement ratios.  Refer to the Anthropometric Measurement Guidelines for specific instructions regarding the collection of growth measurements. All  age-appropriate physical measurements will be collected at approximately 
the same time each visit (±2 hours around the time when the first measurement assessment was taken at Screening ) by a trained study staff member; every effort will be made to have 
the measurements collected by the same study staff member, if possible, throughout the 
study. Each measurement will be taken in triplicate (excluding weight, taken once).  
Anthropometric meas urement can be conducted either pre -dose or post -dose. Measurements 
may include but are not limited to length, standing height (if able to stand unsupported), crown -to-rump length, head circumference, upper and lower arm and leg, and arm span. 
Measurements not taken in the midsagittal plane should be taken on the right side of the body 
if possible and should always be taken on the same side of the body throughout the study 
Body proportion measurements may include but are not limited to upper arm:forearm length 
ratio, upper leg:lower leg length ratio, and armspan:standing he ight ratio.

Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
9.11.4.2 Imaging Assessment Procedures (per Schedule of Events)  
Imaging assessment procedures for all visits must be performed using the same instruments.   
Imaging assessments can be conducted either pre -dose or post -dose. 
• Bilateral lower extremity x -rays, anterior -posterior (AP) view , to assess growth plate  
morphology. 
• Hip imaging via pelvis x -ray to identify hip pathology  
• Lumbar spine x -rays to measure changes from baseline in bone morphology and 
pathology.   
• MRI to evaluate the effect of BMN 111 on skull and brain morphology, including 
foramen magnum, ventricular and brain parenchymal dimensions .  
• DXA (BMD and BMC) of whole body [less head], spine , and forearm (i ncluding 
ultra-distal, mid -distal , and one third radius regions of interest)  to assess bo ne mineral 
density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC). 
Although X -rays are preferable for consistency across the study population, if there are IRBs 
or IEC s unwilling to allow x -rays in C ohort 3 subjects, contact the medical monitor  to 
discuss alternate non -radiological methods for assessment.    
Additional imaging may be conducted should there be any issues or concerns with the 
subject’s imaging assessments. Imaging assessments will be collected and interpreted by a central reader. I f clinically significant abnormalities are noted, the investigator or designee is 
required to assess whether it is appropriate to report an AE and if the subject should continue 
in the study. Refer to the vendor Imaging Guidelines for detailed imaging asse ssment 
requirements and procedures.  
9.11.4.3 Exploratory Biomarker Research Sample Analyses  
All samples collected in this study may be used for  on-study exploratory biomarker research 
once the primary use has been completed.  
For each portion of the blood and urine  samples reserved for protocol -specified analyses, 
there may be multiple sample aliquots. Once samples have been successfully analyzed during 
the study, unused sample portions may be used during the study for assay development or other purposes stated in t his section. No exploratory genomic research will be conducted 
without consent from the subject and his/her legally authorized representative (parent or legal guardian).

Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
9.11.4.4 Genomic Biomarker Analysis  
While the inherited FGFR3 mutations associated with achondr oplasia are well characterized, 
disease phenotype in monogeneic diseases is often modified by variants in other genes. 
To identify and study genetic variants that may modify achondroplasia, a whole blood 
sample will be collected.  Exploratory genomics will  include, but are not limited to NPR -B, 
BRAF, and other genes associated with CNP signaling.  Exploratory genomic analysis may inform understanding of the BMN 111 mechanism of action in achondroplasia.  Exploratory genomics will not be conducted without express consent from the subject and his/her legally authorized representative (parent or legal guardian). 
 
9.11.4.5 Sleep Study  
Given that sleep apnea is a finding in children with ACH ( Waters, 1993)  and has implications 
on functional and health outcomes, a sleep study will be performed in a limited number of qualified sleep centers.  A sleep -testing device will be used to assess the presence and 
severity of sleep -disordered breathing by measurement of blood oxygen saturation, pulse 
rate, and airflow during overnight monitoring. Assessment of episodes of sleep apnea will include, but may not be limited to, the number of e pisodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour 
(Apnea/Hypopnea Index).   
9.11.4.6 Clinical Photography 
To document the physical and phenotypic findings of  achondroplasia with and without  
treatment with study drug, clinical photography of the full body, face, spine, and ext remities 
will be conducted. This assessment is optional. If the parents/caregivers decline clinical 
photography, the assessment will be waived for the duration of the study.  
9.11.4.7 Clinical Outcome Assessments  
Clinical outcome assessments will be administered to assess the health -related quality of life 
of study subjects. ADL questionnaires will be performed in study subjects to assess functional performance. Clinical outcome assessments will be performed at the time points indicated in the Schedules of Events ( Table  9.1.1  and Table  9.1.2). The age ranges for 
clinical outcome assessment tools are shown in  Figure  9.11.4.7.1.

9.11.4.7.1 Bayley- III 
The Bayley -III is a performance -based outcome assessment  for use in children from 1 to 
42 months . It is  individually administered by the trained clinician to the subject /child. 
The time required varies from 15 -60 minutes depending on the child’s developmental level 
and cooperation.  
Scales include Cognitive subscale, Receptive and Expressive subscales, and Gross and Fine 
Motor subscales. The two language scales make up a composite Language Scale score and 
the Gross and Fine Motor subscales yield a composite Mot or Scale score.  
The scales have clinical and research utility as a diagnostic assessment for young children with varied disorders and disabilities, and reflect current professional standards for early childhood assessment ( Bayley, 2006).  
In addition to its use for subjects ranging from 1 to 42 months  old, the Bayley- III assessment 
will be administered to  those entering the study between 42 and 60 months  old 
(Figure  9.11.4.7.1)  and for the remainder of the duration of this study, as this assessment can 
capture  ongoing developmental issues  associated with Achondroplasia .  Bayl ey-III is waived 
for subjects 
 < 1 month old. 
9.11.4.7.2 Activity of Daily Living and Functional Independence Measure (Wee -FIM)  
The Wee- FIM instrument is an ADL assessment tool that measures functional performance 
across three domains (self -care, mobility and cognition) ( Ireland,  2011; Ireland, 2012).  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 82 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
The Wee- FIM instrument has been used in previous r esearch in children with ACH, and has 
identified ongoing limitations in functional performance across these domains extending 
beyond the age of 7 yea rs (Ireland , 2011).  Because the WeeFIM considers the child’s 
performance from a caregiver’s perspect ive (Ireland, 2012), this tool in turn gives an 
indication of “burden of care” for families and caregivers of children with ACH.  WeeFIM  is 
waived for children < 6 months old.  
9.11.4.7.3 ITQO L 
The ITQOL is an observer -reported outcome tool developed for use in children from  
2 months to 5 years old that attempts to capture physical, mental and social well -being. 
The ITQOL adopts the World Health Organization’s definition of health as a state of 
complete physical, mental and social well -being, and not merely the absence of dis ease. 
The ITQOL also assesses the quality of the parent/guardians life.  The 97 -item full- length 
version (ITQOL) will be used for this study. Completion time varies.   ITQO L is waived for 
subjects < 2 months old.  
9.11.4.7.4 Child Behavior Checklist  
The Child Behavior  Checklist (CBCL) is for use in children from 1.5- 5 years old , and will be 
administered for those entering the study at less than 5 years old and for the remainder of the 
duration of the study.  The  CBCL comprises 99 questions addressing symptoms related t o 
mood, behavior issues, and sleep disturbance.  It is completed by the parent or primary caregiver.  
The form requires approximately 15 minutes to complete. The checklist yields scores in the following areas: reactivity, anxiety, depression, somatic compl aints, withdrawal, sleep 
problems, attention problems, and aggressive behavior. CBCL  is waived for 
children  < 18 months old. 
9.11.5 Pharmacokinetics Variables  
PK plasma samples will be collected pre- dose and at 5 (± 2 min), 15 (± 2 min), 30 (± 5 min), 
45 (± 5 min), 60 (± 5 min), 90 (± 5 min), and 120 (± 5 min) minutes post -dose. On Day 1, 
additional PK samples will be collected at 180 (± 5 min) and 240 (± 5 min) minutes.  In the 
event of interruption of s tudy drug administration for a s entinel patient on Day 1 when PK 
samples are scheduled, the collection of PK samples should be delayed until the subsequent 
day and only performed after successful administration of study drug has been completed in a single injection. 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 83 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
Whenever possible, the following PK parameters  will be estimated by non- compartmental 
analysis:  
• Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC0 -∞) 
• Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from 0 to the time of last measurable 
concentration (AUC0- t) 
• Cmax 
• tmax 
• Elimination half -life ( t1/2) 
• Apparent clearance of drug (CL/F)  
• Apparent volume of distribution based upon the terminal phase (Vz/F)  
Refer to the Study Laboratory Manual for additional instructions regarding obtaining and 
shipping samples. BioMarin will perform sam ple analysis, and samples may also be used for 
assay development.  
9.11.6 Safety Variables  
Safety will be evaluated by the incidence of AEs, SAEs, and clinically significant changes in 
vital signs, physical examination, ECG, imaging, and laboratory test results ( urinalysis, 
chemistry, hematology). Additionally, imaging, hip monitoring, biomarker, immunogenicity, cortisol and prolactin levels, and physical measurement data will be utilized for safety -related 
reviews and analysis.  
9.11.6.1 Adverse Events  
The occurrence of A Es will be assessed continuously from the time the subject receives study 
drug. The determination, evaluation and reporting of AEs will be performed as outlined in 
Section  10.2.1. Assessments of AEs will occur at the time points shown in the Schedule of 
Events ( Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2). Additionally, contact by a study staff member to the 
caregiver will be required every week for 6 months, and then every 2 weeks for the remainder of the study. During these contacts, study staff will ask the caregiver about dose administration and seek information on AEs and SAEs by specific questioning. Information 
on all AEs and SAEs s hould be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the AE 
eCRF.  
9.11.6.2 Procedures During the Study  
All procedures/intervention/surgery will be recorded after informed consent is obtained and after the first administration of study drug, until end of study.

9.11.6.3 Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Specific visits for obtaining clinical laboratory assessment samples are provided in 
Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2. The scheduled clinical laboratory tests are listed in 
Table  9.11.6.3.1. Refer to the Study Reference Manual for instructions on obtaining and 
shipping samples. 
Any abnormal test results determined to be clinically significant by the Investigator should 
be repeat ed (at the Investigator’s discretion) until the cause of the abnormality is determined, 
the value returns to baseline or to within normal limits, or the Investigator determines that the abnormal value is no longer clinically significant. 
The investigator s hould assess all abnormal clinical results and include a comment on 
whether or not the result is clinically significant. Each clinically significant laboratory result 
should be recorded as an adverse event. 
The diagnosis, if known, associated with abnormal ities in clinical laboratory tests that are 
considered clinically significant by the Investigator will be recorded on the AE eCRF.

9.11.6.4 Other Laboratory Assessments  
Subjects will be asked to provide blood and urine  at the times indicated in the Schedule of 
Events ( Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2).  Blood volume for testing has been reduced to the 
minimum necessary for adequate evaluation of efficacy and safety of BMN 111. For subjects who have not previously had genetic testing confi rming diagnosis of ACH, 
molecular genetic diagnosis to identify the FGFR3 mutation (G346E, G375C, G380R, or 
“other”) will be performed.  If subjects had previous genetic testing, subjects must have a lab 
report from a certified laboratory with the study specific mutation documented.  
Salivary cortisol and serum prolactin will be collected at the times indicated in the Schedule 
of Events ( Table  9.1.1).

9.11.6.5 Vital Signs, Physical Examinations and Other Observations Related to Safety  
Vital signs assessed pre- dose will include seated or supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measured in mm  Hg, heart rate in beats per minute, 
respiration rate in breaths per minute, and temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).  All treatment 
visits have pre- dose vital sign assessments. Post -dose measurements include heart rate and 
BP. For all dosing visits, assessment frequency is detailed in Table  9.11.6.5.1 (Schedule of 
Events, Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2).  
At Screening, after at least 5 minutes of rest, subject’s BP is taken in sitting  or supine  
position. Vital sign measurements should be repeated and documented 3 times, with at least 
5-minute  intervals between assessments.  Left brachial arm should be the first method of 
assessment considered, and the same site should be used for blood pressure measurement in each subject throughout the study. The method and site of blood pressure measurement will be recorded and should be utilized consistently throughout the remainder of the study.  
At other visits, vital sign measurements are taken once per time point in a sitting or supine position after at least 5 minutes of rest. Heart rate should be taken at each time point that BP is measured. When blood samples and BP assessments are scheduled at the same time or within the same time window, BP should be measured before blood samples are drawn. If a BP measurement must be taken after a blood draw, ensure adequate analgesia for the blood draw and wait several minutes before measuring BP. Pre- dose vital signs should always be 
taken and recorded prior to pre -dose blood draw. Vital signs may be monitored more 
frequently or for longer duration post -dose as clin ically indicated.   
If a subject has signs potentially consistent with hypotension or a decrease in systolic BP of 20 mm Hg or more from pre -dose systolic BP, blood pressure and heart rate (BP/HR) should 
be measured and recorded approximately every 15 minutes for the first hour and every 30 minutes thereafter until the systolic BP returns to pre -dose systolic BP (or within the 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 87

normal range for this subject as defined by PI) and signs (if present) resolve.  If the 
hypotension resolves within the first hour a nd returns to the normal range, additional BP 
monitoring as described above is not required. Detailed guidance for blood pressure measurements is provided in the Blood Pressure Instrument and Technique Guidelines.  
Table  9.11.6.5.1:  Vital Sign Assessment Frequency

5. Vital signs may be monitored more frequently or for longer duration post -dose as clinically indicated.  
6. If a subject has a hypotensive event, or signs potentially consistent with hypotension, or a decrease of 20 
mm Hg systolic BP  or more from baseline (defined by pre -dose vitals collected that day), vital signs 
should be measured and recorded approximately every 15 minutes (± 5 minutes) for the first hour and 
every 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) thereafter until the BP returns to baseli ne (or within the normal range for 
this subject as defined by PI) and signs (if present) resolve.  
7. If the decision is made to adjust the dose, vital signs will be obtained for at least 4 hr following the first dose at the adjusted dose level, similar to th e Day 3, 8 schedule.  
8. If a dose adjustment visit coincides with a visit at which a full PK is drawn, vital signs will be obtained for 8 hours, similar to the Day 1,2 schedule.
 
 
9.11.6.6 Mitigating the Risk of Potential Hypotension  
Study personnel and caregivers should be made aware of the potential risk of hypotension 
with BMN 111  administration.  Subjects must be well hydrated and at a minimum be fed 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 88 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
prior to administration of BMN 111  or placebo.  If a recent acute illness associat ed with 
volume depletion (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) has not completely resolved prior to the 
first dose of BMN  111 or placebo, BMN  111 or placebo dosing may be delayed until 
hydration status has improved (up to the maximum period allowed for the sc reening 
window). 
Caregivers should be trained to observe and recognize the signs of dehydration (e.g. from 
fever, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.) and contact the investigator prior to BMN 111 or placebo 
administration if dehydration is suspected. Site personnel and caregivers should be trained to 
identify the signs of hypotension and, if they occur, should implement first -aid strategies at 
the discretion of the investigator such as having the subject lie down supine, elevating the lower extremities, and administe ring fluids. For guidelines on how to report adverse events 
associated with hypotension, refer to Section 10.3.1.4. 
9.11.6.7 Electrocardiography  
A standard 12- lead ECG will include heart rate, rhythm, intervals, axis, conduction defects, 
and anatomic abnormalities. The time of collection will be recorded. ECGs should be 
performed in triplicate with the subject supine  at the visits indicated in the Schedule of 
Event s (Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2) .  ECGs will be performed post -dose on study day visits 
at which a dose is given; in addition, on Day 1, ECGs will be performed pre -dose.  On days 
when PK samples are being drawn, ECGs should be performed within a 5- minute window 
prior to 30- minute PK assessment.   If clinically significant abnormalities are note d, the 
investigator or designee is required to assess whether it is appropriate for the subject to continue in the study.  
9.11.6.8 Hip Clinical Assessment  
The hip clinical assessment should be completed by a n appropriately qualified physical 
therapist or a physician (MD) i.e., the investigator or the sub -investigator at the time points 
indicated in the Schedule of Events (Table 9.1.1 and Table 9.1.2). Medical history will be obtained to evaluate for hip, thigh, or knee pain, or change in gait. The physical exam (including observation of gait when possible) identifies and evaluates any changes in hip 
function or pain with assessment of active and passive range of motion. Changes from 
baseline may trigger further evaluation based on the  investigator’s clinical assessment, which 
may include hip imaging and/or orthopedic consultation. If findings on clinical hip exam are determined to be clinically significant by the investigator and in consultation with Sponsor’s Medical Monitor and orthopedic specialist (if needed), the DMC will be notified of AEs resulting from clinically significant abnormal hip monitoring assessments. DMC may

Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
provide recommendations as to if/when BMN  111 or placebo treatment should be 
temporarily or permanently discont inued.  
9.11.6.9 Pediatric Blood Volume  
Clinical labs and immunogenicity samples are necessary to perform to adequate safety 
assessment in this study.  The objectives of testing pharmacodynamics biomarkers are to demonstrate biologic activity of BMN  111
 and to unde rstand the impact of immune 
responses on drug activity; and for blood biomarkers, to investigate the effects of treatment on changes in bone metabolism and endogenous CNP production.  
To minimize blood collection volumes, assay technologies were chosen that  are capable of 
sensitively detecting analytes using the lowest possible volume of blood for analysis.  Additionally, assays capable of detecting analytes in urine rather than blood have been selected where possible.  
9.11.6.10 Anti - BMN 111  Immunogenicity Assessment s and IgE Testing  
Subjects randomized to receive BMN  111  or placebo will undergo immunogenicity testing. 
Blood (serum) samples for immunogenicity assessments will be collected at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table  9.1.1) , and testing performed using validated 
assays. Neutralizing antibody (NAb) testing will be performed on Baseline and TAb positive samples drawn from subjects weig hing ≥  7.0 kg and waived for subjects <  7.0 kg.  
Scheduled samples will be tested in one or more of the following assessments:  
• Anti- BMN 111
 total antibody (TAb)  
• Anti-BMN 111  antibody cross -reactive with endogenous CNP, ANP, and BNP (TAb)  
• Anti- BMN 111  NAb  
Testing for the presence of cross- reactive antibodies that bind to endogenous CNP, ANP, or 
BNP and for the presence of BMN 111  NAbs will be performed on baseline samples and 
anti- BMN 111  TAb-positive samples. Baseline NAb sample and cross- reactive TAb sa mple 
testing will be done at any time prior to the end of study. 
9.11.6.11 HPA Axis Assessments 
To address potential effects of BMN 111 on activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal 
(HPA) axis, assessment of salivary cortisol and serum Prolactin levels will be analyzed at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events (Table 9.1.1). Both t ests will be done at 
Baseline, W eek 26, and Week 52.  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 90 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
9.11.6.12 Ad Hoc Safety Assessments  
Samples for total IgE and drug- specific IgE testing will be drawn on Day 1 and in the event 
of a significant hypersensitivity AE, or at the discretion of the investigator and/o r BioMarin. 
A significant hypersensitivity AE is defined as an event that is grade 3 or higher, requires 
temporary or permanent cessation of BMN 111, or is determined to be significant at the discretion of investigator and/or BioMarin (excluding reactions that are solely a localized injection site reaction). If a hypersensitivity AE occurs, an unscheduled safety visit should occur no later than 48 hours of the start of the reaction, including inspection of the injection site and clinical laboratory tests.  
Blood (serum) samples should be collected and tested in one or more of the following assessments:  
•  Drug -specific IgE  
• Total IgE  
• Serum tryptase  
If feasible, a sample for drug -specific IgE should be drawn no sooner than 8 hours after the 
event start time or b efore the next dose. A sample for total IgE and serum tryptase should 
also be drawn within 1 hour of the start of the event when possible or during the unscheduled safety visit.  
A localized injection site reaction is defined as skin signs or signs restric ted to one affected 
primary location, i.e., hives, wheals, or swelling or an area of erythema, redness, induration, pain, or itching at or near the site of injection. Management of such localized reactions should be determined by the investigator’s clinica l judgment in consultation with the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor (if warranted).  
9.11.6.13 Unscheduled Safety Visits  
Unforeseen circumstances may arise in which an unscheduled visit may be needed. In such a case, the procedures performed at the unscheduled visit will b e completed on a case -by-case 
basis.

10 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1 Safety Parameters and Definitions  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording protocol -defined AEs and SAEs; 
measurement of protocol -specified hematology, clinical chemistry, and  urinalysis variables; 
measurement of protocol -specified vital signs; and other protocol -defined events of special 
interest that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study drug.  
10.1.1 Adverse Events  
For this protocol, a reportable adverse event (A E) is any untoward medical occurrence 
(e.g., sign, symptom, illness, disease or injury) in a subject  administered the study drug or 
other protocol -imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. This includes the following: 
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the course of the 
study.  
• Pre-existing medical conditions judged by the Investigator to have worsened in 
severity or frequency or changed in character during the study. 
• Complications that occur as a result of non -drug protocol -imposed interventions 
(eg, AEs related to screening procedures, medication washout, or no- treatment 
run-in). 
An adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study- drug caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means t here is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the study -drug and the AE. 
Whenever possible, it is preferable to record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series of terms relating to a diagnosis.  
10.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse ev ent (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets 
1 or more of the following criteria:  
• Is fatal  
• Is life threatening  
Note: Life -threatening refers to an event that places the subject  at immediate risk of 
death. This definition does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization    
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 92 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the child or fetus of a subject  exposed to IP 
prior to conception or during pregnancy 
• Is an important medical event or reaction – that, based on medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject  or require intervention to prevent one of the above 
consequences (e.g. anaphylaxis)  
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for SAEs should be regarded as 
non-serious AEs.  
10.1.3 Events of Special Interest (EOSI)  
The following EOSI need to be reported to the Sponsor wi thin 24 hours of site awareness, 
irrespective of seriousness, severity or causality:  
• Fracture  
• Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) 
• Avascular necrosis or Osteonecrosis  
10.2 Methods and Timing for Capturing and Assessing Safety Parameters  
10.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period 
For subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 (  ≥  24 to <  60 months old)  and Cohort 2 (  ≥ 6 to   < 24 months  
old), the study AE reporting period is as follows: after informed consent but prior to initiation 
of study treatment, only SAEs associated with an y protocol -imposed interventions will be 
reported.  After informed consent is obtained and the first administration of study drug, all non-serious AEs and SAEs reporting period begins and continues until 4 weeks following 
either the last administration of study drug or the early termination visit, whichever is longer (refer to Section 12.1.11 ). The criteria for determining, and the reporting of, SAEs is 
provided in Section 10.1.2.  For subjects enrolled in C ohort 3 (0 to
 <  6 months old) , the 
collection period for all AEs begins after informed consent is obtained.  
10.2.2 Eliciting Adverse Events 
Investigators will seek information on AEs and SAEs and EOSI, if applicable at each subject  
contact by specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all AEs and SAEs and EOSI, if applicable should be recorded in the subject’s  medical record and on 
the AE Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
10.2.3 Assessment of Seriousness, Severity, and  Causality  
The Investigator or qualified designee responsible for the care of the subject  will assess AEs 
for severity, relationship to study drug, and seriousness (refer to Section 10.1.2 for SAE 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 93 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
definitions).  These assessments should be made by a study clinician with the training and 
authority to make a diagnosis (e .g., MD/DO, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, or 
DDS).  
10.2.3.1 Seriousness  
The investigator will assess if an AE should be classified as “serious” based on the seriousness criteria enumerated in Section 10.1.2.  Seriousness serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
10.2.3.2 Severity  
Severity (as in mild, moderate, or severe headache) is not equivalent to seriousness, which is based on subject /event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a 
threat to a subject’s  life or functioning.  The severity of each will be assessed using the 
defined categories in  Table  10.2.3.2.1. 
The Investigator  or qualified designee  will determine the severity of each AE and SAE , and 
EOSI  using the NCI CTCAE v4. Adverse events that do not have a corresponding CTCAE 
term will be assessed according to the general guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE v4 
as stated below.

telephone, managing money.  
b Self-care ADL refer to the following examples: bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding oneself, using the toilet , 
taking medications, not bedridden.  
 
10.2.3.3 Causality  
The Investigator will determine the relationship of an AE to the study drug and will record it 
on the source documents and AE eCRF.  To ensure consistency of causality assessments, Investigators should apply the guidance in Table  10.2.3.3.1.

 • The administration of IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in time  
AND  
• The AE is more likely explained by exposure to the IP than by other factors or causes.  
 
Factors suggestive of a causal relationship could include (but are not limited to):  
• Plausible temporal relationship  
• Absence of alternative explanations  
• Rarity of event in a given subject  or disease state  
• Absence of event prior  to study drug exposure  
• Consistency with study product pharmacology  
• Known relationship to underlying mechanism of study drug action  
• Similarity to adverse reactions seen with related drug products  
• Abatement of AE with discontinuation of study drug, and/or r ecurrence of AE with 
reintroduction of study drug 
The investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study 
documentation process.  Regardless of the Investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports, the Sponsor will promptly evaluate all reported SAEs against 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 96

cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new 
safety findings to investigators and applicable regulatory authorities.  
10.3 Procedures for Recording Adverse Events 
10.3.1 Record ing Adverse Events on a eCRF  
Investigators should use precise medical terminology when recording AEs or SAEs on a n 
eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
Record only one diagnosis, sign, or symptom per event field on the AE eCRF (e .g., nausea 
and vomiting should not be recorded in the same entry, but as 2 separate entries).  
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferred terms will be assigned by the Sponsor to the original terms entered on the eCRF, using MedDRA  (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities) terminology.  
10.3.1.1 Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
Using accepted medical terminology, enter the diagnosis (if known).  If not known, enter sign(s) and/or symptom(s).  If a diagnosis subsequently becomes available, then this diagnosis should be entered on the AE form, replacing the original entries where appropriate.  
10.3.1.2 Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e .g., cascade events) should be 
ident ified by their primary cause.  For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have resulted 
in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  However, medically important events that may be linked and/or separated in time should be 
recorded as independent events on the eCRF.  For example, if severe hemorrhage leads to 
renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on the eCRF.  
10.3.1.3 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously,  without resolution, between subject  
evaluation time points.  Such an event should be recorded only once on the eCRF unless its severity increases or decreases (in which case it should be recorded again on the AE eCRF).  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs an d resolves between subject  evaluation time points, but 
then subsequently recurs.  All recurrences of the AE should be recorded on the AE eCRF.  
10.3.1.4 Hypotension  
If an asymptomatic drop in blood pressure meets the protocol definition of AE per clinical judgment of the reporter, report the event as “blood pressure decreased.”  If the drop in blood 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 97 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
pressure is associated with signs or symptoms, complete the symptomatic hypotension eCRF 
and use the following guidance to report the corresponding AE eCRF: If a unifying diagnosis is available to explain the event of hypotension, report the diagnosis as an AE and capture signs and symptoms on the symptomatic hypotension eCRF page. If no other unifying diagnosis is available, report “hypotension” as the event and capture s igns and symptoms on 
the symptomatic hypotension eCRF page.  
10.3.1.5 Injection Site Reactions 
If an injection site reaction is associated with a single sign or symptom, report the event on 
AE eCRF page (e.g., redness at injection site, AE is injection site redness ). If the injection 
site reaction is associated with multiple signs or symptoms, report injection site reaction as the adverse event on the AE page, and individual signs and symptoms will be reported on the ISR eCRF page (e.g., if the subject experiences r edness and induration, report “Injection site 
reaction” on the AE page, and in the corresponding Injection eCRF page, report erythema and induration).  If the injection site reaction appears after 24 hours, add “delayed” to the term used to describe the ev ent. 
10.3.1.6 Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Laboratory test results will be recorded on the laboratory results pages of the eCRF, or appear on electronically produced laboratory reports submitted directly from the central laboratory, if applicable.  
Any laboratory resu lt abnormality fulfilling the criteria for a SAE should be reported as such, 
in addition to being recorded as an AE in the eCRF.  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as AE if it is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality and any  one or more of the following conditions 
is met:  
• Accompanied by clinical symptoms  
• Leading to a change in study medication (e.g. dose modification, interruption or 
permanent discontinuation)  
• Requiring a change in concomitant therapy (e.g. a ddition of, interruption of, 
discontinuation of, or any other change in a conc omitant medication, therapy or 
treatment).  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management (e.g., change of dose, discontinuation of study drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.)  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 98 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
This applies to any protocol and non- protocol specified safety and efficacy laboratory result 
from tests performed after the first dose of study medication that falls outside the laboratory 
reference range and meets the clinical significance criteria.  
This does not apply to any abnormal laboratory result that falls outside the laboratory 
reference range but that does not meet the clinical sign ificance criteria (these will be 
analyzed and reported as laboratory abnormalities), those that are considered AEs of the type explicitly exempted by the protocol, or those which are a result of an AE that has already been reported.  
10.3.1.7 Pre-existing Condition s 
A pre -existing condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such conditions 
should be recorded as medical history on the appropriate eCRF.  
A pre -existing condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE during the study only  if the 
frequency, intensity, or character of the condition worsens during the study period.  It is 
important to convey the concept that a pre -existing condition has changed by including 
applicable language in the verbatim description of the event (e .g., more frequent  heada ches).  
10.3.1.8 General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a pre -existing 
condition (refer to Section 10.3.1.7).  During the study, any new clinically significant findings and/or abnormalities discovered on physical examination that meet the definition of 
an AE (or an SAE) must be recorded and document as an AE or SAE on the AE eCRF.  
10.3.1.9 Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization, or Surgery  
Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as an SAE unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol (refer to Section 10.1.2).  
There are some hospitalization scenarios that do not require reporting as an SAE when there is no occurrence of an AE.  These scenarios include planned hospitalizations or prolonged hospitalizations to:  
• Perform a protocol -mandated efficacy measurement  
• Undergo a diagnostic procedure  
• Elective surgical procedure for a pre -existing medical condition that has not changed  
• Receive scheduled therapy (study drug or otherwise) for the study indication

Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
10.3.1.10 Deaths  
All deaths that occur duri ng the AE reporting period (refer to Section 10.2.1), regardless of 
attribution, will be recorded on the AE eCRF and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor as an 
SAE. 
When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the eCRF.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, record “Unexplained Death” or “Death of Unknown Cause” on the eCRF.  If the death is attributed to progression of the disease or condition being studies, record “ -” as the SAE term on the eCRF.  
10.4 Reporting Requirements  
The Sponsor is responsible for identifying, prepa ring, and reporting all suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) to the relevant competent authorities, ethics committees, and investigators in accordance with requirements identified in the Clinical Trials Regulations.
 
10.4.1 Expedited Reporting R equirements  
All SAEs and EOSI, if applicable that occur during the course of the AE Reporting Period (refer to Sectio n 10.2.1), whether or not considered related to study drug, must be reported by 
entering the information in the AE eCRF and submitting to BPV within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event.  Each SAE must also be reported on the appropriate eCRF.  Investigat ors should not wait to collect information that fully documents the event before 
notifying BPV of an SAE.  BioMarin may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days of being notified about the event; therefore, it is important that Investigators submit any information requested by BioMarin as soon as it becomes available.  
If the electronic data capture (EDC) is unavailable, all SAEs should be reported to BPV by completing the SAE Report Form and faxing or emailing the completed form to BPV within 
24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event. Once the EDC is available, the information should be entered in the AE eCRF.  
The reporting period for SAEs begins after informed consent is obtained and continues until 4 weeks  following either the last administration of study drug or study 
discontinuation/termination, whichever is longer.  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 100 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
10.4.2 IRB Reporting Requirements  
Reporting of SAEs to the IRB will be done in compliance with the standard operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB and with applicable regulatory requirements. Adequate documentation must be obtained by BioMarin showing that the IRB was properly and promptly notified as required.  
10.5 Follow -up of Subjects  after Adverse Events 
The Investigator should follow all unresolved AEs/SAEs until the events are resolved or have stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treatment 
or participation is not the cause of the AE/SAE.  Resolution of AEs and SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the AE eCRF and in the subject’s medical record to facilitate source data verification.  
For some SAEs, the Sponsor may follow  up by telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a 
monitoring visit to obtain additional case details (eg, hospital discharge summary, consultant report, or autopsy report) deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE report.  
10.6 Post-Study Adverse Events  
At the last scheduled visit, the Investigator should instruct each subject  to report, to the 
Investigator and/or to BPV dire ctly, any subsequent SAEs that the subject’s personal 
physician(s) believes might be related to prior study treatment.  
The Investigator should notify the study Sponsor of any death or SAE occurring at any time 
after a subject has discontinued or terminated  study participation, if the Investigator believes 
that the death or SAE may have been related to prior study treatment. The Sponsor should also be notified if the Investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject who participated in 
this study.  
10.7 Urgent Safety Measures 
The regulations governing clinical trials state that the sponsor and Investigator are required to take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect subject s against any immediate hazards 
that may affect the safety of subjects , and that the appropriate regulatory bodies should be 
notified according to their respective regulations. According to the European Union (EU) Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, “ …in the light of the circumstances, notably the 
occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects , the sponsor and the Investigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 101 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. The sponsor shall forthwith inform the 
competent authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensure that the 
IRB/EC/ REB is notified at the same time.”  
The Sponsor is responsible for identifying, preparing and reporting all SUSARs to the relevant competent authorities, ethics committees and investigators in accordance with the requirements identified in the Clinical Trials Regulations.  
The reporting period for these events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures is the period from the time of signing of the ICF through the completion of the last study visit or at the Early Termination Visit (ETV). Investigators are required to report any events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures to BioMarin within 24 hours.  
Examples of situations that may require urgent safety measures include discovery of the following:  
• Immediate need to  revise the IP administration (eg, modified dose amount or frequency 
not defined in protocol)  
• Lack of study scientific value, or detrimental study conduct or management  
• Discovery that the quality or safety of the IP does not meet established safety 
require ments

11 APPROPRIATENESS OF M EASUREMENTS  
The parameters to be evaluated in this study reflect the combined experience in the clinical 
study 111- 202 and reflect the need to further define the efficacy and safety profile of 
BMN 111  in the context of achondroplasia (ACH), a complex skeletal dysplasia disorder 
with multiple clinical manifestations.  
The efficacy parameters to be evaluated in this study reflect the sponsor ’s experience in the 
clinical study 111 -202 and of previous studies of approved growth products ( Kemp,  2009; 
Bright, 2009 ).  Evaluation of the parameters proposed in this study will document the effect 
of BMN  111  treatment on AGV in young children with ACH  and are relevant to assessing 
the medical complications of ACH in this patient population.   
The PK assessments in this study are generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant.  
Bone -related biomarkers and other biochemical markers of the pharma cological activity of 
BMN 111  in the blood or urine are secondary assessments.  Genomic biomarkers are 
exploratory assessments.

13 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
BioMarin personnel or designees will visit the study site pri or to initiation of the study to 
review with the site personnel information about the IP, protocol and other regulatory 
document requirements, any applicable randomization procedures, source document requirements, eCRFs, monitoring requirements, and procedures for reporting AEs, including SAEs.  
At visits during and after the study, a CRA will monitor the site for compliance with regulatory documentation, with a focus on accurate and complete recording of data on eCRFs from source documents, adherence to pr otocol, randomization (if applicable), SAE reporting 
and drug accountability records.  
Sites will enter study data into eCRFs into the study EDC system.  Data Quality Control will be performed by BioMarin Clinical Data Management or designee through implem entation 
of quality control checks specified in the study data management plan and edit check specifications.

14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATI ON OF SAMPLE SIZE  
14.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide additiona l details on the planned statistical 
analysis. Unless otherwise stated, all analyses will be performed using SAS v. 9.4.  
14.1.1 Interim Analyses  
An interim analysis will be carried out to support NDA/MAA filing. The report will be 
provided by a third party to ass ure that the study team, subjects, and investigators have no 
access to the individual subject treatment allocation.  
14.1.2 Procedures for Accounting for Missing, Unused and Spurious Data  
Because the completeness of the data affects the integrity and accuracy of t he final study 
analysis, every effort will be made to ensure complete, accurate and timely data collection and, therefore, avoid missing data. In addition, a subject who prematurely discontinues study drug should be asked if they are willing to continue to participate in the study assessments for remaining duration of the study, as long as in the judgment of the investigator such continued participation would not detrimentally affect the health, safety, or welfare of the subject.  
No missing data will be imp uted for any analysis, except for unless otherwise specified for 
the efficacy analyses or for the missing dates for AEs and concomitant medications. Missing dates or partially missing dates will be imputed conservatively to ensure that an AE is 
considered treatment emergent and has the longest possible duration, if the partial information available indicates that the AE is likely treatment emergent.  
Additional details regarding the handling of missing data will be provided in the SAP. 
14.2 Safety Analysis  
The s afety analysis will be performed on safety population as defined in Section 14.7.2 and 
will be considered descriptive.  
All AEs will be coded using the most current version of MedDRA will be used by the 
Sponsor to assign system organ class and preferred term classification to events and diseases, based on the original terms entered on the CRF. 
All AEs will be coded using Me dDRA. The incidence of AEs will be summarized by system 
organ class, preferred term, relationship to study treatment (as assessed by investigator), and 
severity. All AEs, including SAEs and AEs that lead to permanent discontinuation from the study and from  the study treatment, will be listed. Hypersensitivity reactions and 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 115 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
symptomatic hypotension are of interest, and the percentage of subjects who report these AEs 
will be presented. Hypersensitivity reactions will be defined in the SAP.  
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized by the type of laboratory test. For each clinical laboratory test, descriptive statistics will be provided on baseline as well as all subsequent visits.  
All other safety measures including laboratory tests, vital signs, ECG, echocardiogram, hip clinical assessment, and concomitant medication data will also be summarized descriptively. Data summaries will be presented by treatment group (when applicable) for each cohort and overall. All safety results will be liste d. 
14.3 Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy analysis will be performed on the efficacy population as defined in Section 14.7.1. 
Efficacy endpoints include length/height AGV and l ength/height standard score (Z -score) at 
Week 52.  
For a given interval [Date1, Date2], the AGV is defined as follows:  
AGV = Length /standing  height  at Day  2− Length /standing  height  at Day  1
Interval  Length  (Days ) ×365.25  
 
where the interval length in days is  calculated as Date2 – Date1. AGV will be calculated for 
the following visits/intervals:  
• Baseline: [Date of last length/height measurement in study 901 at least 6 months prior 
to screening visit in study 206, Date of Day 1]  
• Week 13: [Date of Day 1, Date of  Week 13]  
• Week 26: [Date of Day 1, Date of Week 26]  
• Week 39: [Date of Day 1, Date of Week 39]  
• Week 52 (12- month): [Date of Day 1, Date of Week 52]  
The baseline of the AGV is established in the natural history study of Study111- 901, based 
on the standing height measurements in the last 6 months prior to enrollment to Study 
111-206. AGV will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, minimum, 
and maximum). Results will be summarized by treatment group and cohort . 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 116 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
The measurement of length /standing height will be converted to age -and sex -appropriate 
standard score (SDS), also referred to as Z -score, by comparison with normal reference 
standards (not ACH). The Z -score will be summarized similarly to growth velocity.  
Comparisons between treat ment groups by cohort on these variables will be carried out 
where appropriate. Statistical comparisons will be considered descriptive. Additional details 
regarding efficacy analysis will be provided in the SAP.  
14.4 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Subjects randomized to receive BMN  111  or placebo will undergo pharmacokinetic testing.  
For subjects randomized to BMN  111, PK parameters generated over the course of the study 
will be evaluated and summarized with descriptive statistical measures (mean, standard 
deviation, CV%, min, median and max). Correlative analyses of some of the PK parameters with efficacy, safety and immunogenicity measures may be conducted.  
14.5 Immunogenicity Analysis  
Immunogenicity will be summarized as change from baseline as well as by study time poi nt 
in subjects randomized to receive BMN 111 or placebo.  Results will be summarized as incidence and titer for all cohorts. Additionally, immunogenicity may be assessed for correlations with measures of safety, PK, and efficacy.  
14.6 Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 70 subjects age 0 to
 < 60 months at study entry will participate in this study. 
No formal sample size calculations were performed. The number of subjects is considered appropriate to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BMN  111 in the targe t population.  
14.7 Analysis Populations  
14.7.1 Efficacy Population  
All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of double -blinded BMN 111 or 
placebo in this study.  
14.7.2 Safety Population   
All subjects who receive at least one dose of double -blinded BMN 111 or pl acebo in this

15 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE  
In addition to safety and PK monitoring by BioMarin personnel, an independent DMC will 
act as an advisory body to BioMarin and will monitor the safety and PK of subjects in the study. After the sentinel subjects complete 12 weeks of dosing, a DMC review will occur to 
evaluate all available safety and PK data.  Upon approval by the DMC, the next younger cohort will be opened and the 3 sentinel subjects will be enrolled.  
The DMC will make recommendations fo r stopping or continuing the study on an individual 
subject level and/or on a cohort level per the pre -specified stopping criteria. Based on criteria 
outlined in the protocol, the DMC may also make endorsements for dose adjustments if needed.

16 COSTS, COMPENSATION,  AND SUBJECT INJURY  
There will be no charge to study subjects to be in this study. BioMarin will pay all costs of 
tests, procedures, and treatments that are part of this study. In addition, after IRB/IEC/REB approval, BioMarin may reimburse the reasonable cost of travel for s tudy-related visits in 
accordance with BioMarin’s study -specific travel and reimbursement policy. BioMarin will 
not pay for any hospitalizations, tests, or treatments for medical problems of any sort related solely to the study subject’s disease. Costs associated with such hospitalizations, tests, and treatments should be billed and collected in the way that such costs are usually billed and collected outside the study. 
The Investigator should contact BioMarin immediately upon notification that a study subj ect 
has been injured by the study drug or by procedures performed as part of the study. 
Any subject who experiences a study -related injury should be instructed by the Investigator 
to seek immediate medical treatment at a pre- specified medical institution i f possible, or at 
the closest medical treatment facility if necessary. The subject should be given the name of a person to contact to seek further information about, and assistance with, treatment for 
study- related injuries. The treating physician should bill the subject’s health insurance 
company or other third party payer for the cost of this medical treatment. If the cost of the 
medical treatment is not covered by health insurance or another third party that usually pays these costs, then either BioMarin  or the institution may pay for reasonable and necessary 
medical services to treat the injuries caused by the study drug or study procedures. In some 
jurisdictions, BioMarin is obligated by law to pay for study- related injuries without prior 
recourse to third party payer billing and/or regardless of fault. If this is the case, BioMarin will comply with the law.

Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
17 CASE REPORT FORMS AND SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
Electronic case report forms will be provided for each subject. The Investigator must review 
and electronical ly sign the completed eCRF casebook to verify its accuracy.  
eCRFs must be completed using a validated web -based application. Study site personnel will 
be trained on the application and will enter the clinical data from source documentation. Unless explicit ly allowed in the eCRF instructions, blank data fields are not acceptable.  
In the event of an entry error, or if new information becomes available, the value will be corrected by deselecting the erroneous response and then selecting or entering the factua l 
response. In compliance with 21 CFR Part  11, the system will require the personnel making 
the correction to enter a reason for changing the value. The documented audit trail will include the reason for the change, the original value, the new value, the t ime of the correction 
and the identity of the operator.  
BioMarin’s policy is that study data on the eCRFs must be verifiable to the source data, which necessitates access to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records. In addition, all  source data should be attributable (signed and dated). The Investigator must 
therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subjects (or their legally authorized representative) must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects wil l be informed 
of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed consent. If direct source document verification of study data by the site monitor is prohibited by institutional policy or 
local law, then the Investigator must make available faci lities and/or personnel to allow 
GCP -compliant source verification to occur. Examples of such methods include certified 
copies of records which have study data visible but sensitive information redacted, or other GCP -compliant means agreed between the Investigator and the Sponsor . 
A CRA designated by BioMarin will compare the eCRFs with the original source documents at the study site and evaluate them for completeness and accuracy before designating them as “Source Data Verified” (SDV). If an error is disco vered at any time or a clarification is 
needed, the CRA, or designee, will create an electronic query on the associated field. Site personnel will then answer the query by either correcting the data or responding to the query. 
The CRA will then review the response and determine either to close the query or re–query 
the site if the response does not fully address the question. This process is repeated until all open queries have been answered and closed.  
Before a subject’s eCRF casebook can be locked, data fields must be source data verified and all queries closed. Refer to the Study Monitoring Plan for details on which fields must be source data verified.  The Investigator will then electronically sign the casebook, specifying 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page 120 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  16 August 2018  
that the information on the eC RFs is accurate and complete. The Data Manager, or designee, 
will then set the status of the forms, visits, and the entire casebook to Locked. Upon 
completion of the CSR, an electronic copy of each site’s casebooks will be copied to a compact disk (CD) and sent to each site for retention with other study documents.

18 STUDY MONITORING AND AUDITING  
Qualified individuals designated by BioMarin will monitor all aspects of the study according 
to GCP and standard operating procedures for compliance with applicable government regulations. The Investigator agrees to allow these monitors direct access to the clinical supplies, dispensing, and storage areas and to the clinical files, including original medical records, of the study subjects, and, if requested, agrees to assist the monitors. The 
Investigator and staff are responsible for being present or available for consultation during routinely scheduled site visits conducted by BioMarin or its designees.  
Members of BioMarin’s GCP Compliance Department or designees may  conduct an audit of 
a clinical site at any time before, during, or after completion of the study. The Investigator will be informed if an audit is to take place and advised as to the scope of the audit. Representatives of the FDA or other Regulatory Agenc ies may also conduct an audit of the 
study. If informed of such an inspection, the Investigator should notify BioMarin immediately. The Investigator will ensure that the auditors have access to the clinical supplies, study site facilities, original source documentation, and all study files.

19 RETENTION OF RECORDS   
The Investigator must retain all study records required by BioMarin and by the applicable 
regulations in a secure and safe facility. The Investigator must consult a BioMarin representative before di sposal of any study records, and must notify BioMarin of any change 
in the location, disposition or custody of the study files. The Investigator /institution must take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of essential documents, that is,  
documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced, including paper copies of study records (e .g., subject charts) 
as well as any original source documents that are electronic as r equired by applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
All study records must be retained for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in the US or an ICH region and until (1) there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in the U.S. or an ICH region or (2) at least 2 years have elapsed since 
the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP. The Investigator /institution should retain subject identifiers for at least 15 years after the completion or discontinuation 
of the study. Subject files and other source data must be kept for the maximum period of time 
permitted by the hospital, institution or private practice, but not less than 15 years. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if re quired by the 
applicable regulatory requirements or by a BioMarin agreement. BioMarin must be notified and will assist with retention should Investigator /institution be unable to continue 
maintenance of subject files for the full 15 years. It is the respo nsibility of BioMarin to 
inform the Investigator /institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.

young to sit. The duration of vital signs assessments in Section 9.11.6.5 and Table 9.11.6.5.1 has been 
extend ed to align with the assessments presented in the SOE.  Additionally, if a dose adjustment visit 
coincides with a visit at which a full PK is drawn, vital signs will be obtained for 8 hours, similar to the Day 1,2 schedule.

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY 
Amendment: 2  
Date: 08 February  2019 
RATIONALE AND SUMMARY OF MAJOR CHANGES  
The protocol has been amended to include the following changes: 
1.The following exploratory objectives have become secondary objectives in
Amendment  2. [§8.0]
•Evaluate the effect of BMN 111 on growth parameters and body proportions,including change from baseline in upper:lower segment ratio.
•Evaluate the effect of BMN  111 on sl eep apnea
•Evaluate the effect of BMN on skull and brain morphology, including foramenmagnum, ventricular and brain parenchymal dimensions
•Describe the incidence of surgical interventions, including cervical decompression,adenotonsellectomy, and typanostomy
Rationale : Because of the importance of clinical  and morbidity outcomes in 
achondrodroplasia (ACH), all outcome endpoints (with the exception of optional 
assessments) have been moved from exploratory to secondary.  
2.The secondary imaging assessment proce dures, excluding the MRI assessment,  have been
moved to the secondary s afety variable s section. The hip imaging assessment has been
removed, the X- ray assessment has been modified  to include long bone growth, and the
DXA assessment will no longer  include the forearm. Also, the paragraph discussing the
possibility of non- radiological methods of assessment for subjects in Cohort 3 has been
deleted. [§ 9.12.6.3]
Rationale: Imaging assessments, excluding MRI, evaluate the safety of BMN -111 by 
identifying bone pathologies, morphologies, BMD, and BMC. The pelvis X- ray assessment 
has been removed to reduce the subjects’ radiation burden, because the femoral head is captured on X -rays of the lower extremities.  DXA of the forearm has also been removed. 
Thus, concerns regarding excess radiological exposure have been addressed.  
3.The MRI assessments remain as a subsection in the Secondary Efficacy Variables
section.  [9.11.2]
Rationale : MRIs evaluate the effect of BMN 111 on skull and brain morphology, an efficacy 
variable.  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 3 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  8 February 2019  
4. The screening baseline hip assessment with pelvis X -ray has been removed from the 
Schedule of Events [Table 9.1.1]  
Rationale : Eliminating the pelvis X -rays at the screening visit will help  minimize the 
radiation burden on study subject.  
5. Footnot es have been changed to modif y procedures and  to add e arly termination visits  
(ETV) for anthropomorphic measurements, DXA, and X -rays [Table 9.1.1]  
Rationale:  The changes in ETV for have been made to  align 111- 206 with other studies in 
the clinical program . Changes in the X -ray and DXA  procedures also help minimize the 
radiation burden on the study subject s. 
6. The Child Behavior Checklist  has been moved from §4.12.3.3 Clinical Outcome 
Assessments to  be a subsection of  §9.12.6 Safety Variables [§9.12.6.6] . A sentence 
specifying that the CBCL should be given prior to other study assessments was added. 
Rationale: The CBCL checklist addresses symptoms related to issues of safety (eg, sleep 
problems, aggressive behavior) rather than efficacy.  It is thought that the  answers to the 
CLCL, as a Patient Reported Outcome instrument, may be affected by the study procedures.  
7. The following sentence was added to §9.3.3 and §9.3.4 “After completing the observation 
period, s ubjects must fulfill the general eligibility criteria prior to receiving treatment 
with study drug.”  
Rationale : Cohort 3 subjects have different eligibility criteria during the observational 
period, thus Cohort 3 subjects who complete the observation peri od must also fulfil l the 
general eligibility criteria before receiving treatment.  
8. Mention of sterile diluent for reconstitution of BMN 111 has been deleted. [§9.4.2.1]  
Rationale : Only sterile water for injection is provided for reconstitution of drug produ ct. 
9. The s econdary efficacy variables were updated . [§9.12.3]  
Rationale : The secondary efficacy variables were updated to match the changes in secondary 
endpoints . 
10. Additions and corrections have been made to the PK parameters to be estimated by non-compart mental analysis. [§9.12.5]  
Rationale : Clarification th at PK parameters for both sentinels and study subjects will be 
analyzed, as well as the addition of C
max and T max to the PK parameters.  
11. Updates have been made §13 Data Quality Assurance and §17 Case Report Forms and Study Documents . 
Rationale : Language re quired in the current BioMarin protocol template was added.  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 4 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  8 February 2019  
12. The identity of the medical monitor has been updated to George S. Jeha  [§10.8] . 
13. Administrative changes have been made throughout the amended protocol for 
consistency, accuracy, and clarity .

PROTOCOL NUMBER :  111- 206 
STUDY SITES:  Approximately 10-15 sites worldwide  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  Phase 2  
STUDY RATIONALE:  
BMN 111 is a recombinant CNP analogue that has been engineered to resist degradation by NEP, 
allowing for a longer half -life. 
The pharmacological activity of BMN 111 was explored in two mouse models of ACH, a severe, 
Fgfr3Y367C/+ (TD) model ( Lorget, 2012 ), and a milder [Ach] /+ (Ach) model. These included 
studies in 7 -day old TD mice given  BMN  111 daily by SC administration for up to 20 days and a 
study in 3 -week old Ach mice given BMN 111 daily by SC administration for 5  weeks. Partial or 
complete reversion of the ACH phenotype was ob served in these mouse models after BMN 111 
administration. In wild -type mice, and normal rats and mon keys, BMN 111 administration resulted 
in growth plate expansion and dose -dependent skeletal growth at hemodynamically tolerated dose 
levels ( Wendt,  2015). Additionally, the potential effect of age on BMN 111 PK was evaluated in 
normal rats aged between 7 d ays and 12 -13 weeks.  
Infants and young children with ACH have a high incidence of medical complications and currently 
there is no approved pharmacological  therapy for ACH in the US or EU. The most severe 
complication, cervicomedullary compression (CMC), o ccurs in a subset of subjects with ACH due 
to abnormal endochondral bone growth and narrowing of the foramen magnum ( White, 2016 ). CMC 
has been linked to s erious respiratory and neurological complications including hypotonia, apnea, 
ataxia, developmental d elay, and respiratory arrest associated with sudden death ( Mukherjee, 2014). 
Foramen magnum decompression surgery is currently the only treatment for this condition.   
Sleep apnea has also been extensively described in ACH, and sleep -disordered breathing m ay affect 
up to 85% of all children with ACH ( Ireland, 2012). This is thought to be due to midface 
hypoplasia, relative adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and pot ential posterior cranial fossa compression 
secondary to abnormal endochondral bone growth. Sleep apne a in ACH not only results in the need 
for surgical intervention, but has also been linked to sudden death in rare cases ( Pauli, 1984 ).   
Similarly, the dys regulation of endochondral bone growth in ACH leads to other medical 
complications which are prevalen t in this subject population, such as the following:

µg/kg), and Part 2 included 10 days of either fixed dosing or dose escalation (0.5 µg/kg to 8 µg/kg). 
BMN 111 was generally well tolerated at all doses. As expected, mild, transient, self -limited 
hypotens ion was reported (refer to current Investigators Brochure for additional information). 
Following SC administration, BMN 111 was rapidly absorbed with maxim al plasma concentrations 
achieved in less than 30 minutes. BMN 111 was rapidly cleared from the plasm a with a mean t 1/2 
ranging from 40 to 55 minutes across dose levels. BMN 111 exposure (C max and AUC 0-t) generally 
increased greater than proportional to th e increase in dose across the 2.5 -to-15 µg/kg dose range. 
Exposure following multiple dosing was found to be similar to exposure following single doses, indicating no apparent accumulation or time -dependence with once -daily SC administration.  
Study 111- 202, the second clinical trial in humans and the first in children with ACH, is an ongoing 
Phase 2, open -label, sequential -cohort, dose -escalation study that assesses daily SC BMN 111 in 
pediatric subjects with ACH aged 5 -14 years with doses ranging from 2.5 µg/kg to 30 µg/kg. The 
primary objective of Study 111 -202 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMN 111 
administered for 6 months and up to 24 months; the secondary objectives are to determine change 
from baseline in annualized growth velocity (AGV ), growth parameters, body proportions, and 
evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BMN 111 in children  with ACH.

Analysis of safety data from the 6 month initial phase of Study 111 -202 showed that treatment with 
BMN 111 for 6 months at the doses of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 µg/kg was generally well tolerated (refer to current Investigator’s Brochure for specifi c details). One subject (30 µg/kg) in 111-202 withdrew 
due to an AE. The subject developed non-serious, asymptomatic Grade 1 intermittent Wolff -
Parkinson-W hite pattern, which was discovered on a routine day 10-study monitoring ECG. The 
most common AEs acro ss all cohorts were injection site reactions, asymptomatic hypotension, 
headache, and nasopharyngitis. Based on previous experience of the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial, including the 24 month data cut at 15 µg/kg, injection site reactions have been ident ified as risks 
associated with BMN 111 injections. The majority of hypotension events were grade 1 and reported 
in the setting of routine BP measurement. A ll reported events of hypotension were transient and 
resolved without medical intervention. For a det ailed summary of risks, please refer to the current 
version of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by BioMarin.  
Analysis of efficacy data from the 6 mont h initial phase of Study 111-202 showed that subjects 
treated with BMN 111 for 6 months at doses ranging from 2.5 15 µg/kg daily had a dose -dependent 
improvement in AGV, with ~50% improvement in AGV seen at the 15 µg/kg dose. The data from 
Cohort 4 (30 µg/ kg) show an apparent greater than dose -proportional increase in BMN 111 plasma 
exposure (C max and AUC 0-t), with a marginal improvement in both absolute AGV and change from 
baseline AGV after 6 months of BMN 111 treatment when compared with Cohort 3 (15  µg/kg).    
Study 111- 206 is a Phase 2 randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled clinical tria l of BMN 111 
in infants and younger children with a diagnosis of ACH who are 0 to < 60 months old. This 52-week study will enable assessment of BMN 111 efficacy an d safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics 
biomarkers, and PK in this population. Additional exploratory endpoints pertaining to medical complications of ACH will also be evaluated.   
Efficacy/toxicity studies have been conducted in neonatal and very young a nimals (7 day 
postpartum mouse and rat) in both a disease (TD mouse) and non-disease (rat) mo del. Given that 
this is the first study in infants and young children, an age based cohort study design is used to 
assess safety and PK in young children (Cohort 1, ≥ 24 to < 60 months) prior to dosing toddlers 
(Cohort 2, ≥ 6 to < 24 months) and infants (C ohort 3, 0 to < 6 months). PK will be monitored and 
evaluated; Day 1 PK data from the sentinel subjects will inform dose selection modification for the 
sentinel su bjects and for the rest of the cohort to target the observed exposure of the 15 µg/kg dose 
group in Study 111-202. Safety, efficacy and PK data from Study 111 -202, a Phase 2 study in 
children with ACH, where a dose of 15 µg/kg has been and continues to be studied, are expected to be the most relevant, and translatable to this study (111 -206).

STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN:  
This study, 111 -206, is a Phase 2 randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial o f 
BMN  111 in infants and younger childre n with a diagnosis of ACH.  
Study 111- 901 is an ongoing study to collect serial growth measurements on pediatric subjects with 
ACH who are being considered for subsequent enrollment in future BioMarin studies.  Subje cts who 
are age ≥ 6 months to < 60 months old; who have documented ACH confirmed by genetic testing; at 
least a 6 -month period of pretreatment growth assessment in Study 111-901 immediately before 
screening; and who meet the study eligibility criteria, wil l participate. Eligible subjects ranging  from 
0 months to < 3 months old may enroll directly into 111-206 and have a minimum of 3 months of 
pretreatment observation prior to commencing treatment with investigational product, or may enroll 
in 111-901 for a minimum of 3 months of pretreatment grow th assessment immediately before 
roll-over to 111-206.  
Approximately 70 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 10-15 clinical centers worldwide.   
The primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety and  tolerability of daily SC BMN  111 
admini stered to infants and young children with ACH, and to evaluate the effect of BMN 111 on 
length/height Z-score. Subjects will be enrolled into 3 age cohorts based on age at study screening starting with the eldest pop ulation.  Within Cohorts 1 and 2, subjec ts will be stratified by age:  
• Cohort 1 – children aged ≥ 24 to < 60 months (n ≥  30 total: 3 sentinel subjects who receive 
BMN 111, and at least 27 additional subjects randomized 1:1 to treatment or placebo control), stratified by age (≥ 24 to < 36 months a nd ≥ 36 months to < 60 months)   
• Cohort 2 – children aged ≥ 6 to  < 24 months (n ≥  20 total: 3 sentinel subjects who receive 
BMN 111, and at least 17 additional subjects randomized 1:1 to treatment or placebo control), stratified by age (≥  6 months to <  15 m onths and ≥  15 months to <  24 months)  
• Cohort 3 – children aged 0 to < 6 months (n ≥ 20 total: 3 sentinel subjects who will be under 
observation or receive BMN 111, and at least 17 additional subjects randomized 1:1 to 
treatment or placebo control).  Treat ment begins at ≥  3 months to  < 6 months after 
3 months of o bservation.  
If subjects who enroll in Cohort 3 are not able to begin treatment by 
 < 6 months of age, they will 
continue in the pretreatment period for another 3 months before enrolling in Cohort 2 to fulfill the 
pretreatment requirement for Cohort 2.  
Sentinel subjects from each cohort will be enrolled, treated with BMN 111, and studied for short -
term safety and PK data. No two sentinel subjects will be dosed on the same day for any cohort. 
After the sentinel data are evaluated  additional recruited subj ects will be randomized to receive 
BMN 111 or placebo SC daily (1:1 ratio) for 52 weeks.

At the start of the study, 3 sentinel subjects will be enrolled and monitored in Cohort 1. After all 3 
sentinel subjects reach Day 8, the Sp onsor will review and eval uate all available safety data and Day 
1 PK data. Based on PK data and criteria set in the protocol, the dose may be adjusted for the 
sentinel subjects and the rest of the cohort, and will be the starting dose for the younger cohort 
sentinel subjects.  Upo n review of the clinical and PK data, the remainder of Cohort 1 (≥ 27 
additional subjects) will be enrolled and randomized to treatment with BMN 111 or placebo (1:1 
ratio).  After the sentinel subjects complete 12 weeks of dosing,  a data monitoring committee 
(DMC) review will occur to evaluate all available safety and PK data.  Upon approval by the DMC, the next younger cohort (Cohort 2) will be opened and the 3 sentinel subjects will be enrolled.  
The same procedure will be followed for Cohort 2. After all 3 sentinel subjects reach Day 8, the Sponsor will review and evaluate all available safety data and Day 1 PK data. Based on PK data and 
criteria set in the protocol, the dose may be adjusted for the sentinel subjects and the rest of the 
cohort, and will be  the starting dose for the younger cohort sentinel subjects.  Upon review of the 
clinical and PK data, the remainder of Cohort 2 (≥ 17 additional subjects) will be enrolled and randomized to treatment with BMN 111 or placebo (1:1 ratio). After the sentinel  subjects complete 
12 weeks of dosing, a DMC review will occur to evaluate all available safety and PK data.  Upon approval by the DMC, the youngest cohort (Cohort 3) will be opened and the 3 sentinel subjects will 
be enrolled.  
The same procedure will be followed for Cohort 3. After all 3 sentinel subjects reach Day 8, the 
Sponsor will review and evaluate all available safety data and Day 1 PK data. Based on PK data and 
criteria set in the protocol, the dose may be adjusted for the sentinel subjects and th e rest of the 
cohort, and will be the starting dose for the younger cohort sentinel subjects.  Upon review of the clinical and PK data, the remainder of Cohort 3 (≥ 17 additional subjects) will be enrolled and randomized to treatment with BMN 111 or placebo (1:1 ratio).  
Cohort 3 subjects must have a minimum of 3 months of observation prior to commencement of treatment.  These subjects will have the option to enroll in either 111 901 or 111-206.  
Additional sentinels may be added to any cohort if needed for additional safety and/or PK 
assessment.

As subjects age on study, they will be administered the dose determined to be appropriate for their 
current age.  For example, if a subject enrolls into Cohort 2 at age 20 months, they will receive the recommended dose for subjects aged ≥ 6 to  < 24 months until they turn 24 months in age.  When 
they turn 24 months in age, they will begin to receive the recommended dose for subjects 
aged 
 ≥ 24 to  < 60 months.  Duration of the study is 52 weeks of treatment with a safety follow up at 
Week 56. Following completion of the study, subjects in all treatment groups may be eligible to 
receive BMN 111 in an open -label extension study, to assess safety and efficacy of BMN 111 over 
the longer term; and to study the long-term outc omes on sustained growth, proportionality, bone 
maturation and medical comorbidities.  
For subjects enrolling into the extension study, safety follow up visit at Week 56 will be waived.  
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  
In addition to safety and PK monitori ng by BioMarin personnel, an independent DMC will act as an 
advisory body to BioMarin and will monitor the safety and PK of subjects in the study. After the 
sentinel subjects complete 12 weeks of dosing, a DMC review will occur to evaluate all available 
safety and PK data.  Upon approval by the DMC, the next younger cohort will be opened and the 
3 sentinel subjects will be enrolled.  
The DMC will make recommendations for stopping or continuing the study on an individual subject 
level and/or on a cohort level  per the pre -specified stopping criteria. Based on criteria outlined in the 
protocol, the DMC may also make endorsements for dose adjustments if needed.  
Please see DMC Charter for further details.  
Individual Subject Stopping Criteria  
For individual subje cts treated with BMN 111, DMC will be informed if any of the following 
individual subject stopping criteria should occur. Temporary dosing suspension, permanent 
discontinuation of dosing, or dose reduction for the individual subject will be  considered.  
• Any treatment -emergent adverse event (AE) assessed as at least Grade 4 by the Investigator 
and/or Sponsor Medical Monitor  
• Any treatment -emergent AE of at least Grade 3 assessed as related to study drug by the 
Investigator and/or Sponsor Medic al Monitor  
• Any two treatment -emergent Grade 2 symptomatic hypotension events within 7 days 
(non-urgent medical intervention indicated) or any Grade 3 hypotensive event (urgent 
medical intervention or hospitalization indicated) assessed by the Investigator  and/or

Dose Adjustments  
Analysis of available PK data from studies 111 -101 and 111-202 indicated that differences in 
subject body weight did not directly translate to differences in total body clearance of BMN 111.  
The same weight -based dose in the pediatric population of Study 111-202 (5-12 years old) yielded 
lower exposure (C max and AUC) than that characterized in  the adult population of Study 111- 101.  
Therefore, the same weight -based dose in the young pediatric population in this study may yield 
exposure less than the target exposure range characterized to be safe and effective in Study  111-202 
at the 15 µg/kg dose. Since this is the first experience with BMN 111 in this young pediatric population, it is also pos sible the exposure at 15 µg/kg could be greater than the target exposure 
range, and dose adjustment may be warranted. Thus, an option for adjustment of the weight -based 
dose is provided to ensure that the appropriate target exposure for safety and efficacy  is reached for 
the young subjects in this study.   
The need for dose adjustment will be evaluated as follows: three sentinel subjects in Cohort 1 will 
receive an initial dose of 15 µg/kg. After all three sentinel subjects reach Day 8, a review will occur 
to evaluate all available safety and PK data (at minimum). If the criteria for dose adjustment are 
met, the three sentinel subjects will be started on the new adjusted dose at their next scheduled visit, 
and vital signs will be obtained for at least 4 hour s post -dose.  
The remainder of the subjects in the age cohort will also be enrolled starting at the new adjusted 
dose. After the third sentinel subject rea ches Week 12 post -dose adjustment, a DMC review will 
occur to evaluate all safety and PK data and, upo n endorsement, the three sentinel subjects from the 
next younger cohort will be enrolled starting at the new adjusted dose.  The three sentinel subjects 
for the second and third cohorts will be evaluated similarly to the sentinel subjects in the first coho rt 
for potential dose adjustment.  
As subjects age on study, they will be administered the dose determined to be appropriate for their 
current age.  For ex ample, if a subject enrolls into Cohort 2 at age 20 months, they will receive the 
recommended dose for  subjects aged ≥ 6 to  < 24 months until they turn 24 months in age.  When 
they turn 24 months in age, they will begin to receive the recommended dose for subjects aged ≥ 24 to < 60 months.

Safety and Efficacy Monitoring  
Each treated subject will have expan ded outpatient safety monitoring for a minimum of 3 days of 
dosing, during which they will be closely observed and non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring wil l 
be conducted for at least 4 -8 hours post -dosing. Because younger children may not be able to 
verbali ze complaints of dizziness or lightheadedness that are potentially associated with 
hypotension, study personnel and caregivers will be trained to recogniz e the signs of hypotension in 
this population, which may include tachycardia, pallor, diaphoresis, lethargy, delayed capillary 
refill, and poor feeding. Appropriate rigorous training will be required for parents and caregivers 
prior to daily injections at home. Training includes the storage, reconstitution, and administration of 
BMN  111, as well as documen tation/reporting of AEs and vigilance for signs of hypotension.  
It is generally expected that after subjects are tolerating the drug well and specified cr iteria have 
been met, caregivers will begin administering study drug. Home health care is not required  at any 
point but may be provided if the caregiver is unable or unavailable to administer the study drug. A 
Home Healthcare nurse will train the caregiver (s) if training has not been completed by the Day 3 
visit. A phone call by the study staff member to t he caregiver will be required weekly for 6 months 
and then every 2 weeks for the remainder of the study. During these contacts, study staff will ask the 
caregiver about dose administration and seek information on AEs and SAEs by specific questioning. 
If the caregiver cannot be contacted by phone after two attempts, contact can be made via email.   
Safety will be evaluated by the incidence of AEs, serious AE s (SAEs),  X-rays will be performed of 
the entire lower extremities and spine to evaluate for changes i n bone morphology and growth, 
laboratory test results (urinalysis, chemistry, and hematology), vital signs, physical examination, 
ECG and echocardiogram, hip clinical assessment, and anti -BMN 111 immunogenicity assessments.  
Clinical laboratory tests, PK, immunogenicity and blood biomarker assessments will be limited to 
the minimum necessary for evaluation of safety and efficacy in order to minimize blood volume in 
the pediatric population.  
Efficacy will be assessed by change from baseline in AGV and length/height Z- score. Secondary 
assessments will include change from baseline in growth parameters and body proportions by 
anthropometry. An MRI will be perfor med to assess the effect of BMN 111 on skull and brain 
morphology, including foramen magnum, ventricular , and brain parenchymal dimensions.  A board -
certified, fellowship -trained (or equivalent) pediatric anesthesiologist will administer anesthesia 
during MRI measurements in the event that the subject is unable to remain still for the duration of 
the scan. Sleep studies will be conducted to evaluate sleep apnea. Additional assessments will be 
conducted to evaluate changes from baseline in bone metabolism an d BMN 111 pharmacodynamic 
biomarkers, and developmental/functional status.

• ITQOL  
Pharmacokinetics : PK sampling will be carried out over the entire study period in sentinel subjects 
and subjects randomized to BMN 111 or placebo. Whenever possible, the following PK parameters 
for sentinel subjects and subjects randomized to BMN 111 will be estimated by non-compartmental analysis:  
• Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC 0-∞)  
• Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to the time of last measurable 
concentration (AUC 0-t) 
• Maximum o bserved plasma concentration (C max)  
• Time to reach C max (Tmax)  
• Elimination half -life (t 1/2)  
• Apparent clearance (CL/F)  
• Apparen t volume of distribution (V z/F)  
Exploratory: The following exploratory measurements will be assessed:  
• Clinical photography (opt ional)  
• Optional evaluation of genomic biomarkers  
STATISTICAL METHODS:  
Sample Size Determination:  
Approximately 70 subjects age  0 to < 60 months at study entry will participate in this study. No 
formal sample size calculations were performed. The number of subjects is considered appropriate 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BMN 111 in the target population.    
Safety Analysis : 
All AE s will be coded using the most current version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) to assign system organ class and preferred term classification to event and 
disease, based on the original terms entered on the eCRF. The incidence of AEs will be summarized 
by system organ class, preferred term, relationship to study treatment as assessed by the 
investigator, seriousness, and severity. All AEs, including SAEs and AEs that lead to permanent 
discontinuation from the study and from the stud y treatment, will be listed. 
All other safety measures including laboratory tests, vital signs, ECG, echocardiogram, hip clinical assessment, and concomitant medication data will also be summarized descriptively. Data 
summaries will be presented by  treatment group (when applicable) for each cohort and overall. All 
safety results will be listed.

Efficacy Analysis : 
Efficacy variables, including AGV (based on length/height) and length/height Z -score according to 
normal reference standards (not ACH), along with their change from baseline will be summarized 
by treatment group and cohort. Comparisons between treatment gr oups by cohort on these variables 
will be carried out where appropriate. Statistical comparisons will be considered descriptive. 95% CIs will be provided along with p values for treatment group comparisons.  
Sentinel subjects will be summarized apart for b oth efficacy and safety.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis:   
PK parameters generated over the course of the study will be evaluated and summarized  with 
descriptive statistical measures (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation [CV%], minimum, median and m aximum). Correlative analyses of some of the PK parameters with efficacy, 
safety and immunogenicity measures may be conducted.  
HRQoL and Functional Independence:  
For the Health -Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and functional independence assessments, 
indivi dual items, domain, and summary scores generated over the course of the study will be 
evaluated with descriptive statistical measures (mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and

7 INTRODUCTION  
BMN 111 is a proposed pharmacologic therapeutic option for achondroplasia  (ACH), the 
most common form of dwarfism.  
ACH is a rare di sease with a prevalence of 1/25000 in the US ( Wynn, 2007)  The average 
adult heights for men and women with ACH are 131 cm and 124 cm, respectively 
(NIH,  Genetics Home Reference, 2012 ).  Characterist ic features include long and narrow 
trunk, a large head wi th frontal bossing, hypoplasia of the mid- face, bowed legs and stenosis 
of the foramen and spinal canals that can be life -threatening. Foramen magnum stenosis can 
lead to cervicomedullary compressio n in infants with complications including hydrocephalus, 
hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency, apnea, cyanotic episodes, feeding problems, quadriparesis, and sudden death.  
There is no approved pharmacological therapy for achondroplasia in the United State s (US) 
or European Union (EU). Current treatments for achondroplasia are focused on neurosurgical interventions for foramen magnum stenosis or lumbar stenosis, thoracolumbar braces to help ameliorate the kyphosis, or limb lengthening requiring multiple ope rations over 2 to 3 years 
(Shirley,  2009), (Horton, 2007).   
ACH is caused by a gain -of-function mutation in fibroblast growth factor (FGF)R3, a 
negative regulator of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.  The most common mutation (98%) in ACH patients is a G380R substitution in the transmembrane domain of 
FGFR3 (at position 380).  The majority of new cases (80%) originate from parents with 
normal stature.   
The extracellular signal- regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
pathway mediates part of FGFR3 inhibition of chondrocyte proli feration and differentiation 
(Foldynova -Trantirkova, 2012).  The ERK MAPK pathway is modulated by CNP, a positive 
regulator of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.  Binding of C NP to the Natriuretic 
Peptide -Receptor B (NPR- B) antagonizes FGFR3 downstream signaling by inhibiting the 
MAPK (ERK1/2) pathway at the level of RAF -1 (Krejci, 2005); (Yasoda, 2004); 
(Yasoda,  2009); (Pejchalova, 2007).  This crosstalk was demonstrated in a mouse model of 
FGFR3 -related chondrodysplasia ( Yasoda, 2004); ( Yasoda , 2009).  The dwarfism phenotype 
of mice harboring the FGFR3G380R mutation was rescued by expression of CNP in cartilage 
or by the continuous administration of CNP (infusion).  
CNP is a me mber of the natriuretic peptide (NP) family that includes Atrial Natr iuretic 
Peptide (ANP) and B -type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP). These peptides are structurally related 
but are distinct paracrine/autocrine (CNP) or endocrine (ANP and BNP) factors that regu late

the cardiovascular (CV), skeletal, nervous, reproductive and other systems. Synthetic analogs 
of ANP (anaritide and carperitide) and BNP (nesiritide) have been investigated as potential therapies for the treatment of decompensated heart failure and cardiovascular -related 
diseases.  
BMN 111 is a 39 -amino acid CNP analogue harboring the 37 amino acids of the human 
CNP53 C- terminal sequence and modified by the addition of two amino acids (Pro -Gly) on 
the N -terminus.  It is a recombinant human peptide fused to human transcription factor 
(TAF) and expressed as an inclusion body in E. coli.  BMN 111 is liberated and solubilized from the TAF -fusion protein by formic acid cleavage, and purified by column 
chromatography ( Long, 2012).  BMN 111 was designed to 1) m imic CNP activities in terms 
of receptor binding and pharmacological activity and 2) be resistant to neutral endopeptidase (NEP) digestion in order to have an extended half -life in comparison to CNP that is 
presumed to increase exposure to the target growt h plate ( Wendt, 2015).  
A comprehensive review of BMN 111 is containe d in the current version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure supplied by BioMarin.  Investigators are required to review the Investigator’s 
Brochure prior to initiating this study. 
7.1 Nonclinical Studies  
The pharmacological activity of BMN  111 was explored in two mouse models of ACH, a 
severe, Fgfr3Y367C/+ model ( Lorget, 2012), and a mild [Ach] /+ model.  Partial or complete 
reversion of the ACH phenotype was observed in these mouse models after 
BMN  111 
administration.  Additionally, in wild- type mice, and normal r ats and monkeys, BMN 111 
administration resulted in growth plate expansion and dose -dependent skeletal growth at 
hemodynamically tolerated dose levels ( Wendt, 2015).  
BMN 111- related adv erse findings in nonclinical species (mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys) 
were limited to the known mechanism of action of CNP on the growth plate and vasculature.  
Reversible subcutaneous injection site reactions were reported, including injection site discol oration and microscopic findings of perivascular mononuclear cell infi ltrates that were 
seen with slightly higher incidence and severity in BMN 111- treated rats and monkeys 
compared to the vehicle control.  Adverse skeletal changes associated with exaggera ted 
growth were seen in normal nonclinical species with open growth pl ates, and were dose- , 
exposure - and time -dependent. Decreases in blood pressure and compensatory increases in 
heart rate were detected in monkeys across multiple studies, with overt CV -related clinical 
signs observed in some animals at doses ≥ 236 µg/kg. T hese overt clinical signs consisted of 
transient, short and repeated bouts of sternal or lateral recumbency and/or reduced motor 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 39

activity, typically within 1 -hour post -dose administratio n.  Additional detailed information 
about nonclinical studies of BMN 111 is provided in the current version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure supplied by BioMarin.   
7.2 Previous Clinical Studies  
7.2.1 Study 111 -101 
Study 111- 101, “A Phase 1, Two Part, Double Blind, Pl acebo -Controlled Study to Evaluate 
the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Single and Multiple Doses of BMN  111 
Administered to Healthy Adult Volunteers,” was a first- in-human study conducted in 2 parts 
to allow for assessment of the safety, tole rability, and PK of BMN 111 administered as a 
single dose and as a multiple dose to healthy adult male volunteers.  
Doses ranging from 5.0 µg/kg to 15.0 µg/kg were administered as a single subcutaneous (SC) dose; doses ranging from 0.5 µg/kg to 8.0 µg/kg we re administered daily in the multiple 
ascending dose segment of the study. As expected, mild, transient, self -limited hypotension 
occurred. The  majority of these cases were asymptomatic and observed upon assumption of 
an upright posture following recumbenc e. Hypotension events were reported in the BMN 111 
treatment groups with higher frequency compared with placebo. All events were judged to be mild in severity and resolved spontaneously without an intervention. These events occurred across dose ranges.  Du e to the limited number of events at each dose, it is unclear if 
symptomatic hypotension is dose related.  No dose limiting toxicities were identified outside of these cardiovascular events. The only adverse events (AEs) occurring in more than one 
subject receiving BMN  111 were orthostatic hypotension, contact dermatitis, and back pain, 
and injection site reactions. Most AEs in the study were of mild severity, and no serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported. There were no AEs that led to premature discontinuation of study drug.   
The PK parameters for BMN 111 were obtained from Part 1 of the study and from the first 
dose on Day 1 of the multiple dose study in Part 2. The results demonstrate that BMN 111 was rapidly absorbed in human, reaching a mean time to peak concentration (T
max) between 
15-26 minutes. After reaching maximal plasma concentrations, BMN 111 levels rapidly 
declined, with a t 1/2 of 40- 55 minutes. Mean plasma concentration -time profiles indicate that 
exposure increased with dose from 2.5 to 15 µg/kg. The corresponding increases in plasma C
max and area under the curve (AUC) exposure parameters were greater than dose 
proportional. The increase in C max with dose was linear over the dose range evaluated.  In 
Part 2, with multiple dosing at 5 µg/k g for 10 days, the plasma concentration- time curves 
obtained on each of the three sampling days were nearly superimposable. Comparison of PK 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 40 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  8 February 2019  
exposure parameters for AUC and C max indicate that C max is unchanged and AUC is 
increased slightly by +33% over Day 1. Overall, the results indicate that changes in 
BMN 111 exposure are minimal with repeat dosing out to 10 days. 
7.3 Ongoing Clinical Studies  
7.3.1 Study 111 -901 
Study 111- 901 is a multicenter, multinational study to collect serial growth measurements on 
pediatric subjects with ACH who are being considered for subsequent enrollment in future 
studies sponsored by BioMarin. To obtain accurate baseline measurements, at least 6 months 
of growth data are collected for Cohorts 1 and 2; and at least 3 months of data for Cohort 3.  
Data gathered from this study are used to characterize baseline growth data in children or infants (defined as children < 2 years of age) who may subsequently be enrolled in future studies sponsored by BioMarin, and may also be used to establish historical control cohort for use in other BioMarin- sponsored studies, when appropriate. For that reason, data related 
to ACH symptoms, tests, and interventions are collected.  
7.3.2 Study 111 -202 
Study 111- 202 is an ongoing Phase 2, open- label, sequential cohort, dose escalation study 
that assesses daily SC administration of BMN 111 in pediatric subjects with ACH. The primary objective of Study 111- 202 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMN 111 
administered for 6  months and up to 24 months; the secondar y objectives are to determine 
change from baseline in annualized growth velocity (AGV), growth parameters, body proportions, and evaluate the dose -exposure and PK profiles of BMN 111 in children with 
ACH.  
Analysis of safety data from the 6 -month initial p hase of Study 111- 202 showed that 
treatment with BMN 111 for 6 months at dose cohorts of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 µg/kg (Cohorts  1 to 4, respectively) was generally well tolerated. The most common AEs were mild 
injection site reactions, asymptomatic hypotension, headache, and nasopharyngitis. For a detailed summary of risks, please refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by BioMarin.  
Analysis of efficacy data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111- 202 demonstrated that 
the mean (standard deviation) change from baseline AGV when BMN 111 is administered at 
2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 µg/kg subcutaneously daily for 6 months is -0.37 (1.592), 1.28 (1.439), 
2.01 (1.999), and 2.08 (2.137) cm/year, respectively.  Thus, a positive dose -dependent 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 41 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  8 February 2019  
response was observed in change from baseline AGV at doses ranging from 2.5- 15 µg/kg 
daily.   
For longer term follow up data from the 202 study, please refer to the current Investigator 
Brochure supplied by BioMarin.  
7.3.3 Study 111 -205 
Study 111- 205 is an ongoing open- label, Phase 2 extension study to assess long- term safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of BMN  111 in children with ACH. Subjects continue receiving the 
same stable dose of BMN 111 received upon completion of the 111- 202 study (up to 
30 µg/kg dai ly). This 5 -year study allows for long- term assessment of the effect of daily 
BMN 111 administration on safety, tolerability, growth velocity, height, and body proportions in subject completing 2 years of BMN 111 treatment in Study 111- 202 (7 years 
total B MN 111 treatment duration). Additional exploratory endpoints are being examined to 
determine long -term effects of BMN 111 on bone physiology and the medical complications 
of ACH.  
7.3.4 Study 111 -301 
Study 111- 301 is an ongoing Phase 3, double -blind, placebo -controlled multicenter study to 
further characterize and confirm efficacy and safety of BMN 111 at 15 µg/kg in a 58 -week 
study (up to 4 weeks of screening, 52 weeks of treatment, plus an additional 2 weeks of safety follow up). The study assesses the effect of  daily BMN 111 administration on change 
from baseline in AGV, height, and body proportions in subjects treated with BMN 111 
compared with control subjects in the placebo group; and further characterizes safety and 
tolerability of BMN 111 in children with A CH. Additional exploratory endpoints are being 
examined to determine the effect of BMN 111 on bone physiology and to assess quality of life and daily function of study subjects.  
7.3.5 Study 111 -302 
Study 111- 302 is an open- label Phase 3 extension study to furthe r evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of BMN 111 either until subjects reach near -final adult height (defined as evidence of 
growth plate closure and <  1.5 cm/yr annualized growth velocity), or for 5 years if near -final 
adult height (NFAH) occurs prior to the  end of the 5- year period.  All subjects will receive 
BMN 111 15 µg/kg. This study will allow for long- term assessment of the effect of daily 
BMN 111 administration on safety, tolerability, growth velocity, height, and body proportions in subjects who have  completed 1 year of placebo or BMN 111 treatment in 
Study 111- 301.

7.4 Study Rationale  
BMN 111 is a recombinant CNP analogue that has been engineered to resist degradation by 
NEP, allowing for a longer half -life. 
The pharmacological activity of BMN 111 was explored in two mouse models of ACH, a severe, Fgfr3Y367C/+ (TD) model ( Lorget, 2012), and a milder [Ach] /+ (Ach) model. These 
included studies in 7 -day old TD mice given BMN 111 daily by SC administration for up to 
20 days and a study in 3 week old Ach m ice given BMN 111 daily by SC administration for 
5 weeks. Partial or complete reversion of the ACH phenotype was observed in these mouse models after BMN 111 administration. In wild -type mice, and normal rats and monkeys, 
BMN 111 administration res ulted in  growth plate expansion and dose -dependent skeletal 
growth at hemodynamically tolerated dose levels ( Wendt, 2015). Additionally, the potential 
effect of age on BMN 111 PK was evaluated in normal rats aged between 7 days and 12-13 weeks.  
Infants and young c hildren with ACH have a high incidence of medical complications and 
currently there is no approved pharmacological therapy for ACH in the US or EU. The most 
severe complication, cervicomedullary compression (CMC), occurs in a subset of subjects 
with ACH du e to abnormal endochondral bone growth and narrowing of the foramen 
magnum ( White, 2016 ). CMC has been linked to serious respiratory and neurological 
complications including hypotonia, apnea, ataxia, developmental delay, and respiratory arrest associated w ith sudden death ( Mukherjee, 2014 ). Foramen magnum decompression surgery 
is currently the only treatment for this condition.   
Sleep apnea has also been extensively described in ACH, and sleep -disordered breathing may 
affect up to 85% of all childr en with ACH ( Ireland, 2012). This is thought to be due to 
midface hypoplasia, relative adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and potential posterior cranial fossa compression secondary to abnormal endochondral bone growth. Sleep apnea in ACH not only results in the need for  surgical intervention, but has also been linked to sudden death in 
rare cases ( Pauli, 1984 ).   
Similarly, the dysregulation of endochondral bone growth in ACH leads to other medical 
complications which are prevalent in this subject population, suc h as the  following:  
• Spinal stenosis, kyphosis, and lordosis (secondary to altered growth plate ossification 
in the vertebrae and narrowing of the interpedicular distances) ( Shirley, 2009)  
• Developmental delay of gross motor and ambulatory skills (associated with pr oximal 
limb shortening, macrocephaly, and hypotonia) ( Ireland, 2010)  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 43 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  8 February 2019  
• Delayed functional skills and increased need for caregiver assistance (eg, eating, 
bladder management, bowel management, transfer to chair, climbing stairs) (Ireland,  2011)  
Thus, BMN 111 may provide greater benefit when children begin treatment at a younger age, 
as earlier initiation of treatment allows a longer time window to improve growth and potential to improve medical complications of achondroplasia. This study (111- 206) is being 
conducted to assess safety and the potential benefit of BMN 111 in infants and young children.   
BioMarin has engineered a CNP analog (BMN 111) that has a longer half -life than 
endogenous CNP, thereby allowing daily SC administration. Similar to CNP, BMN 111  
activates NPR -B signaling with subsequent inhibition of FGFR3 downstream signaling, 
leading to the promotion of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation and subsequent increased endochondral bone formation. BMN 111 administration has been show n to 
promote endochondral bone formation at hemodynamically tolerated dose levels in both normal animals and mouse models of ACH reported (refer to current Investigator’s Brochure for additional information).  
Human studies to date have also demonstrated th at BMN  111 is generally well tolerated at 
doses that result in improvements in growth velocity approaching that of children of average stature ( Section  7.3).  
Study 111- 206 is a Phase 2 randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial of 
BMN 111 in infants and younger children with a diagnosis of ACH who are age 0 to < 60 months. This 52- week study will enable assessment of BMN 111 safety, tolerability, 
pharmacodynamics biomarkers, and PK in this population, and also allow for examination of potential impact on efficacy endpoints. Additional exploratory endpoints pertaining to medical complications of ACH will also be evaluated.  
7.5 Summary of Overall Risks and Benefits  
7.5.1 Summary of Risks from Nonclinical Studies  
Individuals in this study will be exposed to a recombinant analogue of human C -type 
natriuretic peptide (CNP). Based on the results of experimentation in animals, the most relevant potent ial toxicities relate to the expected pharmacological effects of exogeno us CNP 
administration, including hemodynamic changes, skeletal overgrowth, and injection site reactions. Transient and sporadic decreases in blood pressure and compensating increases i n 
heart rate occurred within the first hour post -dose in cynomolgus monkeys; the effects were 
mainly asymptomatic with a subset of animals given doses ≥ 236 µg/kg observed with 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 44 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  8 February 2019  
symptomatic effects consisting of transient, short and repeated bouts of sterna l or lateral 
recumbency and/or reduced motor activity. These hemodynamic  effects can be monitored, 
but have the potential to be an acute dose -limiting factor in patients. Exaggerated 
appendicular bone responses to the drug included abnormally shaped femora l head, 
acetabular growth center/plate dysplasia and concomitant articul ar cartilage degeneration 
with clinical manifestations of restricted use of hips. Adverse skeletal changes associated 
with exaggerated growth were dose -, exposure - and time -dependent. Additional detailed 
information about risks identified in nonclinical st udies of BMN 111 is provided in the 
current version of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by BioMarin.   
7.5.2 Summary of Risks from Clinical Studies  
7.5.2.1 Study 111 -101 
Based on review of the first -in-human Phase 1 study of BMN  111 in healthy adult volunteers, 
Study 111- 101, BMN 111 administered SC daily was well tolerated with doses ranging from 
0.5 µg/kg to 15 µg/kg. All AEs were of mild severity, and no SAEs were repor ted. The most 
common AE was mild, transient, self -limited orthostatic hypotension, of which the majority 
of cases were asymptomatic and observed only upon assumption of an upright posture following recumbence. No dose -limiting toxicities were identified ou tside of these CV 
events.  
7.5.2.2 Ongoing Studies  
Based on analysis of safety data from ongoing phase 2 and 3 studies, treatment with 
BMN 111 was generally well tolerated. Injection site reactions were the most common 
adverse events reported and are considered to be an identified risk. All injection site reactions 
events have been reported as non -serious, Gr ade 1 in severity, and transient. Hypotension and 
hypersensitivity reactions including development of BMN 111 antibodies are potential risks associated with BMN  111 injections. For a detailed summary of risks, please refer to the 
current version of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by BioMarin.  
7.5.3 Summary of Potential Benefits from Clinical Studies  
For children with ACH who will receive BMN  111
 as part of Study 111- 206, potential 
benefits may include improvement of AGV rates such that their increase in grow th velocity 
may approach that of children of average stature. Additional potential benefits may include improvement of the disproportionate growth as well as im provement in quality of life, 
activities of daily living, and medical complications of ACH.  For  example, improvement in 
height could have an impact on daily activity performance.

9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a Phase 2 randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial of BMN  111 in 
infants and younger children with a diagnosis of ACH.  
Subjects age ≥ 6 months to < 60 months old who have documented ACH confirmed by 
genetic  testing; at least a 6 -month period of pretreatment growth assessment in Study 
111-901 immediately before study entry; and who meet the study eligibility criteria, will 
participate. Eligible subjects ranging from 0 months to < 3 months old may enroll direc tly 
into 111- 206 and have a minimum of 3 months of pretreatment observation prior to 
commencing treatment with investigational product, or may enroll in 111- 901 for a mi nimum 
of 3 months of pretreatment growth assessment immediately before roll -over to 111- 206. 
Approximately 70 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 10-15 clinical centers 
worldwide.   
The primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety and t olerability of daily SC 
BMN 111 administered to infants and young children with ACH, and evaluate the effect of 
BMN 111 on Z -scores. Subjects will be enrolled into 3 age cohorts based on age at study 
screening starting with the eldest population. Within Cohorts 1 and 2, subjects will be 
stratified by age:  
• Cohort 1 – children aged  ≥ 24 to <  60 months (n ≥  30 total: 3 sentinel subjects who 
receive BMN 111, and at least 27 additional subjects randomized 1:1 to treatment or 
placebo control), stratified by age (≥ 24 to < 36 months and ≥  36 months to 
< 60 months)   
• Cohort 2 – children aged   ≥  6 to   <  24 months (n ≥  20 total: 3 sentinel subjects who 
receive BMN 111, and at least 17 additional subjects randomized 1:1 to treatment or 
placebo control), stratified by age (≥  6 months to <  15 months and ≥  15 months to 
< 24 months)  
• Cohort 3 – children age d 0 to  < 6 months (n ≥  20 total: 3 sentinel subjects who 
receive BMN 111, and at least 17 additional subjects randomized 1:1 to treatment or placebo control).  Treatment begins at  ≥ 3 months to <  6 months after 3 months of 
observation.  
If subjects who enroll in Cohort 3 are not able to begin treatment by
 < 6 months of age, they 
will continue in the pretreatment period for another 3 months before enrolling in Cohort 2 to 
fulfill the pretreatment requirement for Cohort 2.

Proprietary and Confidential  8 February 2019  
Sentinel subjects from each cohort will be enrolled, treated with BMN 111, and studied for 
short -term safety and PK data. No two sentinel subjects will be dosed on the same day for 
any cohort. After the sentinel data are evaluated, additional recruited sub jects will be 
randomized to receive BMN 111 or placebo SC daily (1:1 ratio) for 52 weeks. At the start of the study, 3 sentinel subjects will be enrolled and monitored in Cohort 1. After all 3 sentinel 
subjects reach Day 8, the Sponsor will review and eval uate all available safety data and 
Day 1 PK data. Based on PK data and criteria set in the protocol, the dose may be adjusted 
for the sentinel subjects and the rest of the cohort, and will be the starting dose for the younger cohort sentinel subjects.  Upon review of the clinical and PK data, the remainder of Cohort 1 (≥  27 additional subjects) will be enrolled and randomized to treatment with BMN 
111 or placebo (1:1 ratio).  After the sentinel subjects complete 12 weeks of dosing, a data monitoring committ ee (DMC) review will occur to evaluate all available safety and PK data.  
Upon approval by the DMC, the next younger cohort (Cohort  2) will be opened and the 3 
sentinel subjects will be enrolled.  
The same procedure will be followed for Cohort 2. After all 3 sentinel subjects reach Day 8, 
the Sponsor will review and evaluate all available safety data and Day  1 PK data. Based on 
PK data and criteria set in the protocol, the dose may be adjusted for the sentinel subjects and 
the rest of the cohort, and will be  the starting dose for the younger cohort sentinel subjects.  
Upon review of the clinical and PK data, the remainder of Cohort 2 (≥  17 additional subjects) 
will be enrolled and randomized to treatment with BMN 111 or placebo (1:1 ratio). After the 
sentinel  subjects complete 12 weeks of dosing, a DMC review will occur to evaluate all 
available safety and PK data.  Upon approval by the DMC, the youngest cohort (Cohort 3) 
will be opened and the 3 sentinel subjects will be enrolled.  
The same procedure will be followed for Cohort 3. After all 3 sentinel subjects reach Day 8, the Sponsor will review and evaluate all available safety data and Day 1 PK data. Based on PK data and criteria set in the protocol, the dose may be adjusted for the sentinel subjects and the rest of the cohort, and will be the starting dose for the younger cohort sentinel subjects.  
Upon review of the clinical and PK data, the remainder of Cohort 3 (≥ 17 additional subjects) 
will be enrolled and randomized to treatment with BMN 111 or placebo (1:1 ratio).  
Cohort 3 subjects must have a minimum of 3 months of observation prior to commencement 
of treatment.  These subjects will have the option to enroll in either 111- 901 or 111- 206. 
Additional sentinels may be added to any cohort if needed for additional safety and/or PK 
assessment.  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 48 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  8 February 2019  
As subjects age on study, they will be administered the dose determined to be appropriate for 
their current age.  For example, if a subject enrolls into Cohort 2 at age 20 months, they will receive the recommended d ose for subjects aged 
≥ 6 to  < 24 months until they turn 24 months 
in age.  When they turn 24 months in age, they will begin to receive the recommended dose for subjects aged 
≥ 24 to < 60 months. 
Each treated subject will have expanded outpatient safety mo nitoring for a minimum of 
3 days of dosing, during which they will be closely observed and non- invasive hemodynamic 
monitoring will be conducted for at least 4- 8 hours post -dosing. Because younger children 
may not be able to verbalize complaints of dizzine ss or lightheadedness that are potentially 
associated with hypotension, study personnel and caregivers will be trained to recognize the signs of hypotension in this population, which may include tachycardia, pallor, diaphoresis, lethargy, delayed capillary refill, and poor feeding. Appropriate rigorous training will be required for parents and caregivers prior to daily injections at home. Training includes the storage, reconstitution, and administration of BMN 111, as well as documentation/reporting of AEs and vigilance for signs of hypotension.  
It is generally expected that after subjects are tolerating the drug well and specified criteria have been met, caregivers will begin administering study drug. Home health care is not required at any point but may be  provided if the caregiver is unable or unavailable to 
administer the study drug. A Home Healthcare nurse will train the caregiver(s) if training has not been completed by the Day 3 visit. A phone call by the study staff member to the caregiver will be req uired weekly for 6 months and then every 2 weeks for the remainder of 
the study. During these contacts, study staff will ask the caregiver about dose administration 
and seek information on AEs and SAEs by specific questioning. If the caregiver cannot be contacted by phone after two attempts, contact can be made via email.   
Duration of the study is 52 weeks of treatment with a safety follow up at Week 56. Following completion of the study, subjects in all treatments groups may be eligible to receive BMN 111 in an open- label extension study, to assess safety and efficacy of BMN 111 over 
the longer term.  For subjects enrolling into the extension study, safety follow up visit at 
Week  56 will be waived.

a Clinic visits (except Days 1, 2, 3, and 8) have a ±  7-day window.  Anthropometric measurement and imaging assessments can be conducted either pre -dose 
or post -dose.  
b If the 111 -901 visit at which the subject enters Study 111 -206 and the 111- 206 Screening visit are on the same day, the procedures common to both visits 
will be performed one time only.  All blood tests at Screening visit should be obtained between Day  − 30 and Day  − 14. 
c Medical history, including growth history and ACH- related history, should elicit all major illnesses, diagnoses, and surgeries that the subject has ever had; 
any prior or existing  medical conditions that might interfere with study participation or safety.  
d Standing height of the participant’s biological parents may be assessed.  Prior to the measurement being taken, each parent is required to complete an ICF 
specific to parent heigh t assessment.  The ICF will be signed prior to the assessment, which can be done at any point in the study.  If biological parent is not 
available during the course of the study to take their standing height, the parent can provide their stated height instead if consent has been given.  
e If subjects had previous genetic testing, subjects must have a lab certification documenting the specific mutation required for the 111- 206 study, including 
the identification of FGFR3 mutation (G346E, G375C, G380R, or “other ”). 
f Complete physical exam includes major body systems, including assessment of general appearance; CV; dermatologic; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; lymphatic; respiratory; gastrointestinal (GI); musculoskeletal; and neurological/psychological and ge nitourinary.  
g All treatment visits have pre -dose vital sig n assessments.  Vital signs at pre -dose include: body temperature in degrees Celsius (°C), heart rate, BP, and 
respiratory rate.  Post -dose measurements include heart rate, BP, and respiratory rate.

1. Vital sign measurements are taken once per time point, preferably in a sitting or supine position, after at least 5 minutes o f rest.
2. Heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate should be taken and recorded at e ach indicated time point.
3. When blood samples and vital sign assessments are scheduled at the same time or within the same time window, vital signs should be measu red before blood samples are
drawn.
4. If a vital sign measurement must be taken after a blood draw, ensure adequate analgesia for the blood draw and wait several minutes before measuring vital signs.
5. Vital signs may be monitored more frequently or for longer duration post -dose as clinically indicated.
6. If a subject has a hypotensive event, or signs potentially consistent with hypotension, or a decrease of 20 mm Hg systolic BP or more from baseline (defined by pre -dose
vitals collected that day), vital signs should be measured and recorded approximately every 15 minutes (± 5  minutes) for the first  hour and every 30 minutes (± 5 minutes)

7. If the decision is made to adjust the dose, vital signs will be obtained for at least 4 hr following the first dos e at the adjusted dose level, similar to the Day 3, 8 schedule.
8. If a dose adjustment visit coincides with a visit at which a full PK is drawn, vital signs will be obtained for 8 hours, similar to the Day 1, 2 schedule .
h A standard 12 -lead ECG will include heart rate, rhythm, intervals, axis, conduction defects, and anatomic abnormalities. The time of collection will be 
recorded. ECGs should be performed in triplicate with the subject supine at the visits indicated in t he Schedule of Events.  ECGs will be pe rformed post-
dose on study day visits at which a dose is given; in addition, on Day 1, ECGs will be performed pre -dose.  On days when PK samples are being drawn, 
ECGs should be performed within a 5 -minute window prior  to 30- minute PK assessment.  
i Echocardio gram is obtained at the early termination visit only if the previous assessment was done more than 3 months prior to early te rmination.  
j Growth measures may be collected in triplicate approximately the same time each day (± 2 hr around the time when the fir st measurement assessment was 
taken at Screening). Measurements may include but are not limited to length, standing height (if able to stand unsupported), crown -to-rump length, head 
circumference, upper and lower arm and leg, and arm span. Measurements not taken in the midsagittal plane should be taken on the right side of the body if 
possible and should always be taken on the same side of the body throughout the study. Anthropometric measurement s will be taken at the ETV  only if 
subject discontinues after Week 6 and if > 2 weeks have elapsed since the previous assessment.

9.1.1 Dose Adjustments  
Analysis of available PK data from studies 111 -101 and 111-202 indicated that differences in 
subject body weight did not directly translate to differences in total body clearance of 
BMN 111.  The same weight-based dose in the pediatric population of Study 111-202 
(5-12 years old) yielded lower exposure (C max and AUC) than that characterized in the adult 
population of Study 111-101.  Therefore, the same weight-based dose in the young pediatric population in this study may yield exposure less than the target exposure range characterized to be safe and effective in Study 111-202 at the 15 µg/kg dose. Since this is the first experience with BMN 111 in this young pediatric population, it is also possible the exposure at 15 µg/kg could be greater than the target exposure range, and dose adjustment may be warranted. Thus, an option for adjustment of the weight-based dose is provided to ensure that the appropriate target exposure for safety and efficacy is reached for the young subjects in this study.   
The need for dose adjustment will be evaluated as follows: three s entinel subjects in Cohort 1 
will receive an initial dose of 15 µg/kg. After all three sentinel subjects reach Day 8, the 
Sponsor will review and evaluate all available safety and PK data (at minimum). If the criteria for dose adjustment are met, the three sentinel subjects will be started on the new adjusted dose at their next scheduled visit, and vital signs will be obtained for at least 4 hours post-dose. 
The remainder of the subjects in the age cohort will also be enrolled starting at the new 
adjusted dose. After the third sentinel subject reaches Week 12 post dose adjustment, a DMC 
review will occur to evaluate all safety and PK data and, upon endorsement, the three sentinel subjects from the next younger cohort will be enrolled starting at the new adju sted 
dose.  The three sentinel subjects for the second and third cohorts will be evaluated similarly to the sentinel subjects in the first cohort for potential dose adjustment.  
As subjects age on study, they will be administered the dose determined to be appropriate for their current age.  For example, if a subject enr olls into Cohort 2 at age 20 months, they will 
receive the recommended dose for subjects aged 
≥ 6 to  < 24 months until they turn 24 months 
in age.  When they turn 24 months in age, they will begin to receive the recommended dose for subjects aged 
≥ 24 to < 60 months. 
Criteria for Dose Adjustment  
The criteria for dose adjustment are based on obtaining equivalent exposure characterized to be safe and effective with the 15 µg/kg dose in Study 111-202 in each of the age cohorts evaluated in this study. BMN 111 dose may be adjusted if the mean observed AUC
0-120 from 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 59 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
sentinel subjects is less than the 25th percentile for AUC 0-120 in Cohort 3 (15 μg/kg) of Study 
111-202 or greater than the 75th percent ile in Cohort 3 of Study 111- 202. If these criteria are 
met, an allometric scaling coefficient, α, for BMN 111 clearance by subject body weight will 
be determined using a population PK  modelling approach and available data from this study 
and Studies 111- 202 and 111- 101. The recommended adjusted dose will be determined using 
the following expression:  
  
where WT ref and Dose ref are the typical (i.e., median) subject body weight and total  dose, 
respectively, at the 15 μg/kg dose level in Cohort 3 of Study 111- 202, and WT ch is the 
anticipated median weight in the age cohort being studied. As such, the recommended adjusted dose will target the median AUC
0-120 observed at the 15 μg/kg dose le vel of Study 
111-202. The recomm ended adjusted dose, Dose ch, will be nor malized by WT ch, to provide 
the recommended adjusted weight -based dose. The following rules will be used for dose 
adjustment:  
• A maximum of a 2 -fold increase in dose/kg will be permitte d between dose 
adjustments regardless of exposure.  
• The total dose will n ot exceed the highest total dose administered in Study 111- 202. 
9.1.2 Stopping Criteria  
Individual Subject Stopping Criteria  
For individual subjects treated with BMN 111, DMC will be inform ed if any of the following 
individual subject stopping criteria should occur. Temporary dosing suspension, permanent discontinuation of dosing, or dose reduction for the individual subject will be considered. 
• Any treatment -emergent adverse event (AE) assessed as at least Grade 4 by the 
Investigator and/or Sponsor Medical Monit or  
• Any treatment -emergent AE of at least Grade 3 assessed as related to study drug by 
the Investigator and/or Sponsor Medical Monitor  
• Any two treatment -emergent Grade 2 symptomatic h ypotension events within 7 days 
(non- urgent medical intervention indicat ed) or any Grade 3 hypotensive event (urgent 
medical intervention or hospitalization indicated) assessed by the Investigator and/or 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor

If the s ubject meets any stopping criterion, after Investigator consultation with the BioMarin 
Medical Monitor and DMC, the subject may be re- challenged at the same dose. If the subject 
meets stopping criteria on re- challenge or if re -challenge at same dose is not  clinically 
indicated, other options that may be considered include:  
•Re-challenge at lower dose with consideration given to upward titration to tolerated
dose
•Permanent treatment dis continuation (with an option of ongoing assessment in the
study)
Cohort Stopping Criteria 
For each cohort, a DMC review will be conducted if any of the following cohort stopping 
criteria occur in subjects treated with BMN 111.  Temporary dosing suspension, permanent discontinuation of dosing, or dose reduction for the cohort(s) will be considered and the 
impact on all other age cohorts will be assessed.  
•Any treatment- emergent AE assessed as at least Grade 4 by the Investigator and/or
Sponsor Medical Moni tor
•Any two subjects have a treatment -emergent AE of at least Grade 3 assessed as
related to study drug by the Investigator and/or Sponsor Medical Monitor
•Any two subjects have two treatment-emergent Grade 2 symptomatic hypotension
events within 7 days ( non-urgent medical intervention indicated) or any two subjects
cohort have a Grade 3 hypotensive event (urgent medical intervention orhospitalization indicated) assessed by the Investigator and/or Sponsor’s MedicalMonitor
•Any two subjects have a clinically significant finding or arrhythmia on ECG that
indicates abnormal cardiac function or conduction or prolongation of
QTc-F >500 msec

9.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Group 
Study 111- 206 is a Phase 2 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled clinical trial of 
BMN 111 in infants and younger  children with a diagnosis of ACH who are age 0 to 
< 60 months. Identification of efficacy at this age range is congruent with mechanism of 
action of BMN 111, because BMN 111 is expected to act at open epiphyseal growth plates. 
Therefore, to have a potenti al therapeutic benefit for subjects with ACH, specifically for the 
foramen magnum and spine, treatment is expected to be required prior to growth plate closure.  
In terms of the study design, a randomized double -blind placebo control will be used to 
mitigate the risk of selection bias and any potential bias in data collection and study conduct.  Additionally, this design provides a framework for interpretation of any endpoints with a subjectiv e component, e.g. health -related quality of life (HRQoL) and activ ities of daily 
living (ADL) questionnaires and any subjective assessment of safety.

9.3.5 Current Chronic Therapy with Re stricted Medications 
Table  9.3.5.1 lists the medications that are restricted in Study 111 -206. 
Table  9.3.5.1:  Current Chronic Therapy with Restricted Medications  
Restricted Medications  
• Antihypertensive medications  
• Angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  
• Angiotensin II receptor blockers  
• Diuretics  
• Beta-blockers  
• Calcium -channel blockers  
• Cardiac glycosides  
• Systemic anticholinergic agents  
• GnRH agonists  
• Growth hormone (and analogs)  
• Any medication that may impair or enhance compensatory tachycardia, diuretics, or 
other drugs known to alter renal or tubular function  
• Any medication that in the investigator’s judgment, may compromise the safety or 
ability of the subject to participate in the clinical trial  
 
9.3.6 Removal of Subjects from Treatment or Assessment  
Subjects (or their legally authorized representative) may withdraw their consent to participate 
in the study at any time without prejudice. The I nvestigator must withdraw from the study 
any subject who reques ts to be withdrawn. A subject’s participation in the study may be 
discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator and in accordance with his/her clinical judgment. When possible, the tests and evaluations listed for the termination visit 
should be carried out.  BioMarin must be notified of all subject withdrawals as soon as possible.  
Investigators may discontinue administration of BMN  111 or placebo at any time. Subjects 
disconti nued from the study by the investigator must return to the clin ic for a termination 
visit. Reasons for which the investigator or BioMarin will withdraw a subject from study treatment include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 67 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
1. Subject experiences a se rious or intolerable AE due to BMN 111 as determined by the 
subject, investigator, or sponsor  
2. Subject requires medication or medical procedure prohibited by the protocol  
3. Subject does not adhere to study requirements specified in the protocol  
4. Subject is los t to follow -up 
If a subject fails to return for scheduled visits, a documented effort must be made to 
determine the reason. If the subject cannot be reached by telephone, a certified letter should be sent to the subject (or the subject’s legally authorized  representative, if appropriate) 
requesting contact with the Investigator. This information should be recorded in the study 
records.  
The Investigator or designee must  explain to each subject, before enrollment into the study, 
that for evaluation of study results, the subject’s protected health information obtained during 
the study may be shared with the study sponsor, regulatory agencies, and IRB/IEC/REB. It is the Investigator’s (or designee’s) responsibility to obtain written permission to use protected health information per country- specific regulations, such as HI PAA in the US, from each 
subject, or if appropriate, the subject’s legally authorized representative. If permission to use protected health information is withdrawn, it is the Investigator’s re sponsibility to obtain a 
written request, to ensure that no fur ther data will be collected from the subject and the 
subject will be removed from the study. 
It is a priority of the study to maximize study subject retention and adherence to 
study- specific pr ocedures. The completeness of the study data may affect the integrity and 
accuracy of the study results.  Therefore, subjects who discontinue study treatment should be 
encouraged to continue to undergo as many of the protocol -specified procedures and 
assessments as possible for the remainder of the study, as long as such continued 
participation does not detrimentally affect the health, safety, or welfare of the subject, and 
consent remains in place. It is important that following treatment discon tinuation t he original 
visit schedule is strictly adhered to.  
For subjects who discontinue BMN  111 or placebo but remain in the study, PK and 
BMN 111 activity assessments will be waived completely; vital signs and clinical 
labs/biomarkers will be obtained  only once at each visit subsequent to BMN  111 or placebo 
discontinuation.  Pre -and post -dose designations will not apply as the subject has 
discontinued dosing and vital sign and clinical lab/biomarkers assessments previously 
designated as “post -dose” wil l be waived.  All other assessments at each visit should be 
completed if possible and the subject is willing.  Data from the study procedures and assessments may be used to further characterize the natural progression of ACH.  
Study 111- 206A2 Page 68 
Proprietary and Confidential  8 February 2019  
BioMarin reserves the right t o discontinue the study at any time.  Premature termination of 
the study may occur because of regulatory authority decision, a change in the opinion of the 
IRB/IEC/REB, clinical or safety reasons, or at the discretion of the Sponsor.   The Sponsor 
reserves the right to discontinue the development of BMN 111 at any time, or to discontinue participation by an individual Investigator or site for poor enrollment or noncompliance.  Any decision to terminate the study will be promptly communicated to Investigators, regulator y authorities, and IRB/IEC/REB.   The Investigator is responsible for 
communicating any decision to terminate a study to hospital staff involved in the conduct of the study and the participating subjects (and their families).  
9.3.7 Subject Identification 
Each su bject will be assigned a unique subject identifier. This unique identifier will be on all 
eCRF pages. In legal jurisdictions where use of initials is not permitted, a substitute identifier will be used. 
9.3.8 Duration of Subject Participation  
Duration  of the study is 52 weeks of treatment with a safety follow up at Week 56. Following 
completion of the study, subjects in both treatments groups may be eligible to receive 
BMN 111 in an open- label extension study, to assess safety and efficacy of BMN 111 o ver 
the longer term. For subjects enrolling into the extension study, safety follow up visit at Week 56 will be waived.  
Subjects who are not eligible to receive BMN 111 in a separate study will return at Week 56 
for the Safety Follow- Up visit to assess fo r any AEs that may have occurred following 
completion of dosing. 
Follow-up assessments and procedures should be performed as outlined in the Study 111-206 
Schedule of Events ( Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2).  
Subjects who discontinue from study treatment will be asked to complete study assessments and procedures for the remainder of the study.  If subjects discontinue from study treatment and decline to participate for the remainder of th e study, they will be asked to return for a 
final follow -up visit 4 weeks after their last dose, and the agreement should be documented.  
Subjects will participate in the study until completion or until one of the following occurs: the subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study, the subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the investigator or BioMarin (upon consultation and in agreement with the investigator) or the study is terminated.

9.4 Treatments  
9.4.1 Treatments Administered  
BioMarin and/or its designee will provide the study site with a supply of IP sufficient for the 
completion of the study.  
Sentinel subjects will receive BMN 111 at a daily dose of 15  µg/kg (subject to adjustment 
per protocol). Subjects will be randomized to BM N 111 or placebo at a daily dose of 
15 µg/kg (subject to adjustment per protocol) for the duration of the study. The normal 
dosing schedule is a single daily subcutaneous injection given 7 days a week.  
If a recent acute illness associated with volume depl etion (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) 
has not completely resolved prior to the first dose of BMN  111 or placebo, the dosing will be 
delayed until hydration status has improved (up to the maximum period allowe d for the visit 
window). 9.4.1.1 Study Drug Administr ation  
During the study, BMN 111 or placebo will be administered as a single 15 µg/kg SC 
injection given daily at approximately the same time each day whenever possible. The same 
injection site should not be used 2 days in a row, and sites should be rotated . Study drug 
should be administered at age -appropriate locations (upper thigh, upper back of arm, 
abdomen or buttocks). Determination of appropriate injection sites will be left to the 
discretion of the investig ator. Doses may be administered in any of the  common SC areas 
(upper arm, thigh, abdomen, buttocks).  
9.4.1.1.1 Observation Period  
Following administration of each dose at clinic visits, subjects should be observed for 8 hours after the injection on Days 1 and 2; 4 hours on Days 3 and 8; and 1 hour on subsequent dosing visits. Subjects should be observed for 30 minutes after every injection that is not administered at the clinic.  Instructions for home administration of BMN  111 or 
placebo for subjects who qualify for parent/caregiver administration are provided in the 
Study Drug Injection Guide and Injection media . 
9.4.2 Identity of BMN 111  
BMN 111
 is cloned into the pJexpress401 vector, expressed in E. coli and then purified.

Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
The amino acid sequence is an analogue of the naturally occurring tissue -expressed form of 
C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP -53). B MN 111  is a recombinant 39 amino acid peptide that 
inclu des the 37 C -terminal amino acids of the human CNP -53 sequence, and is engineered to 
include two additional amino acids (Pro- Gly) on the N -terminus, which renders the peptide 
more resistant to degrada tion. It is a cyclic peptide formed by an intramolecular  disulfide 
bond. The molecular weight of the purified product is 4.1 kDa. 
9.4.2.1 Product Characteristics and Labeling  
The clinical drug product will be supplied in sterile, single -dose, Type I glass vials wi th 
coated stopper and flip -off aluminum cap. BMN 111 drug product is supplied as a 0.8- mg or 
2-mg lyophilized, preservative -free, white -to-yellow powder for reconstitution with sterile 
water for injection (WFI). The reconstituted solution is colorless to y ellow and contains 
0.8 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL of BMN 111, as w ell as citric acid, sodium citrate, trehalose, 
mannitol, methionine, polysorbate 80, and sterile WFI. The target pH of the reconstituted 
solution is 5.5. Sterile WFI will be commercially sourced. All reconstitution and dose preparation steps will be perfor med as indicated in the BMN 111 Injection Guide and 
Injection video.  
BMN 111 -placebo lyophilized product will be supplied in sterile, single -dose, Type I glass 
vials with coated stopper and flip- off aluminum cap. The placebo is designed to be 
comparable in  appearance to the drug product and contains all of the components of  the drug

9.4.4 Directions for Administration  
Refer to the Study Drug Injection Guide for complete BMN  111 or placebo preparation 
instructions.  
The injection will be administered as a daily dose of BMN  111  15 µg/kg or placebo given as 
a single subcut aneous injection. The dose should be given at approximately the same time 
every day whenever possible.  Following administration of each dose at clinic visits, subjects 
should be observed for 8 hours after the injection on Days 1 and 2; 4 hours on Days 3 a nd 8; 
and 1 hour on subsequent dosing visits. Subjects should be obse rved for 30 minutes after 
every injection that is not administered at the clinic. Subjects should have adequate food 
intake prior to dosing.  All subjects should have been well hydrated a nd fed in the hour prior 
to administration of BMN 111  or placebo. 
Caregivers will administer BMN  111 or placebo at home once approved by the investigator 
and adequate training is demonstrated. Instructions on how to complete and document the training can be found in the Study Reference Manual.   
A caregiver will be eligible  to administer BMN  111 or placebo if he or she meets all of the 
following criteria:  
• The subject has been on a stable dosing regimen for a minimum of 3 days  
• PI has approved administration of BMN 111 or placebo by the caregiver  
• The caregiver has completed t he Administration Training conducted by qualified 
study site personnel and has been observed by the study site personnel to be able to 
adequately prepare the proper dose and perform the i njections safely  
For dosing between planned clinic visits prior to ca regiver approval, a home health nurse 
may administer BMN  111 or placebo, or subjects may be administered BMN  111 or placebo 
in the clinic by study staff or trained caregiver.   
The caregi ver will be provided with a paper or electronic study diary and will be asked to 
record daily dosing information, changes in health status, medications and injection sites 
used, date and time of the injection, and injection site reactions, if any. 
A subjec t’s suitability for continued at -home drug administration will be eva luated by the 
investigator and the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor if a subject experiences a CTCAE Grade 3 
or higher AE that is considered possibly or probably drug- related, and/or a hypersens itivity 
reaction during the study.

9.4.5 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Subjects will be randomized using an interactive voice/response system (IXRS) in a 1:1 ratio, 
i.e., injection with placebo:15 µg/kg of BMN  111.  An independent third -party vendor will 
develop the randomization schedule so that BioMarin and site personnel are blinded to 
treatment assignments.  NOTE: In Japan, subjects are randomized separately within each cohort.  
9.4.6 Selection of Dose and Dosing Schedule Used in the Study  
Study 111- 202, the second clinical trial in humans and the first in children with ACH, is an 
ongoing Phase 2, open- label, sequential -cohort, dose -escalation study that assesses daily SC 
BMN 111 in pediatric subjects with ACH aged 5 -14 years with doses ranging f rom 2.5 µg/kg 
to 30 µg/kg.  
Analysis of safety data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111- 202 showed that 
treatment with BMN 111 for 6 months at the doses of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 µg/kg was 
generally well tolerated. The most common AEs across all cohorts were injection site reactions, asymptomatic hypotension, headache , and nasopharyngitis. Based on previous 
experience of the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial, including the 24- month data cut at 15 µg/kg, 
injection site reactions have been identified as risks associated with BMN 111 injections. For a detailed summary of ris ks, please refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure 
supplied by BioMarin.  
Analysis of efficacy data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111- 202 showed that 
subject s treated with BMN 111 for 6 months at doses ranging from 2.5 to 15 µ g/kg daily had 
a dose -dependent improvement in AGV, with ~50% improvement in AGV seen at the 
15 µg/kg dose. The data from Cohort 4 (30 µg/kg) show an apparent greater than dose -
proportional increase in BMN 111 plasma exposure (C
max and AUC 0-t), with a marginal 
improvement in both absolute AGV and change from baseline AGV after 6 months of BMN 111 treatment when compared with Cohort 3 (15 µg/kg). 
Efficacy/toxicity studies have been conducte d in neonatal and very young animals (7- day 
postpartum mouse and rat) in both a disease (TD mouse) and non- disease (rat) model. 
Given  that this is the first study in infants and young children, an age -based cohort study 
design is used to assess safety and PK in young children (Cohort 1, ≥ 24 to < 60 months) 
prior to dos ing toddlers (Cohort 2, ≥ 6 to < 24 months) and infants (Cohort 3, 
0 to 
 <  6 months). PK will be monitored and evaluated; Day 1 PK data from the sentinel 
subjects will inform dose selection modification for the sentinel subjects and for the rest of the co hort to target the observed exposure of the 15- µg/kg dose group in Study 111- 202.

Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
Safety, efficacy and PK data from Study 111- 202, a Phase 2 study in children with ACH, 
where a dose of 15 µg/ kg has been and continues to be studied, are expected to be the m ost 
relevant, and translatable to this study (111 -206).   
9.4.6.1 Selection of Timing of Dose for Each Subject  
9.4.7 Blinding  
An independent third- party vendor will develop the randomization schedule so th at site 
personnel will not know treatment assignments. BMN 111 or  placebo will be labeled with the 
study number and a unique identification number. Subjects and the participating site 
members will be blinded to the two study treatments (15 µg/kg BMN 111 or  placebo). The 
investigator and other members of staff involved w ith the study will remain blinded to the 
treatment randomization code during the assembly procedure. In the event of an emergency medical situation where subject management would be determined or significantly altered by knowing the treatment assignment, t he investigator may be unblinded without prior written 
approval from the Medical Monitor.  Following such an emergency unblinding, the investigator will contact the medical monitor and provid e written rationale according to the 
unscheduled unblinding proce dure set forth in the Study Manual.  The  Medical Monitor will 
review the rationale, evaluate whether there are any additional safety considerations that need to be implemented for the subject  and/or the study, and determine whether the investigator 
require s further guidance on unblinding.  The Medical Monitor may also communicate with 
the investigator advice on the care of the subject and define the plan for the subject’s future 
participation in the study. 
9.4.8 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All medications ( prescription, over -the-counter [OTC] and herbal), and nutritional 
supplements 30 days prior to screening and throughout the study will be recorded on the 
designated eCRF.  The Investigator ma y prescribe additional medications during the study, as 
long as t he prescribed medication is not prohibited by the protocol. In the event of an 
emergency, any needed medications may be prescribed without prior approval, but the medical monitor must be noti fied of the use of any contraindicated medications immediately 
thereafter. Any concomitant medications added or discontinued during the study should be 
recorded on the eCRF. 
9.5 Treatment Compliance  
Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused BMN  111 or placebo kits at each 
study visit. Subject compliance with the dosing regimen will be assessed by reconciliation of 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 74 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
the used and unused vials. The quantity dispensed, returned, used, lost, etc. must be recorded 
on the dispensing log provided for the  study.  
The date, time, and volume of each dose of BMN 111 or placebo administered to each 
subject must be recorded. These data will be used to assess treatment compliance.  
9.6 Investigational Produ ct Accountability (BMN  111 or Placebo)  
The Investigator or de signee is responsible for maintaining accurate records (including dates 
and quantities) of IP(s) received, subjects to whom IP is dispensed (subject -by-subject dose 
specific accounting), and IP l ost or accidentally or deliberately destroyed. The Investigat or or 
designee must retain all unused or expired study supplies until the study monitor (on- site 
CRA) has confirmed the accountability data.  
9.6.1 Return and Disposition of Clinical Supplies  
Unused BMN  111 or placebo must be kept in a secure location for account ability and 
reconciliation by the study monitor. The Investigator or designee must provide an explanation for any destroyed or missing BMN  111 or placebo kits/vials.  
Unused BMN  111 or placebo may be destroyed on site, per the site’s standard operating 
procedures, but only after BioMarin has granted approval for destruction. The study monitor 
must account for all BMN 111 or placebo kits/vials in a formal reconciliation process prior to destruction. The site must document all BMN  111 or placebo destroyed on s ite, and 
documentation must be provided to BioMarin and retained in the investigator study files. If a 
site is unable to destroy BMN  111 or placebo appropriately, the site can, upon request, return 
unused BMN  111 or placebo to the BioMarin contracted facil ity. The return of all BMN  111 
or placebo kits/vials must also be documented and accounted for per instructions provided by BioMarin.  
All BMN 111 or placebo and related materials should be stored , inventoried, reconciled, and 
destroyed or returned according to applicable state and federal regulations and study procedures.  
9.7 Dietary or Other Protocol Restrictions  
BMN 111
 will be administered as a single daily dose of 15  µg/kg SC injection given daily at 
approximately the same time each day whenever possible. P lacebo will be administered as a 
single SC injection given daily at approximately the same time each day whenever possible. Following administration of each dose, subjects will be observed for at  least 2  hours after the 
injection for observation for Days 1 to 3, and 30 minutes for all other days of dose administration.  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 75 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
Subjects should have adequate food intake prior to dosing.  All subjects should have been 
well hydrated and fed in the hour prior  to administration of BMN 111  or placebo.  
9.8 Demographic Data an d Medical History  
Demographic data and a detailed medical history will be obtained at Screening. This medical history, including growth history and ACH -related history, should elicit all major illnesses, 
diagnoses, and surgeries that the subject has ever had; any prior or existing medical 
conditions that might interfere with study participation or safety; and evaluation for knee, thigh, hip or groin pain, or change in gait/activity.   
9.9 Biological Parental Standing Height  
Standing height of the subject’s bio logical parents (optional) may be assessed via height 
measurement or stated height. Height measurement can be done at any point in the study.  
Prior to the measurement being taken, each parent is  required to complete an ICF specific to 
parent height assessment.  The ICF will be signed prior to the assessment, which can be done at any point in the study. If the biological parent is not available during the course of the study to take his/her standi ng height, if consented, the biological parent can provide hi s/her 
stated height.  
9.10 Physical Examination Findings  
Physical examination will include assessment of general appearance; CV; dermatologic; 
head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; lymphatic; respirator y; GI; musculoskeletal; and 
neurological/psychological and ge nitourinary. Other body systems may be examined. 
Screening results will be the baseline values and clinically significant changes from baseline will be recorded as an AE or SAE and study drug rel ated or unrelated when appropriate 
based on the investigator’ s clinical judgment.  
9.11 Echocardiogram  
Cardiac anatomy and function will be evaluated by a standard 2- dimensional Doppler 
echocardiogram by a cardiologist. Echocardiograms will be performed at screening, and provide information regarding cardiac anatomy and f unction prior to enrollment in the study.  
9.12 Efficacy and Safety Variables  
9.12.1 Efficacy  and Safety Measurements Assessed  
The Schedule of Events ( Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2) descr ibes the timing of required 
evaluations.

Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
9.12.2 Primary Efficacy Variables  
The primary efficacy endpoint is change from baseline in length/height Z -score.  
Growth measures may be collected approximately the same time each visit (± 2 hr from the 
time when the first measurement assessment was taken at Screening) by a study staf f 
member, preferably the same person throughout the study, who has been trained by a BioMarin representative. Standardized measuring equipment and detailed measurement techniques are detailed i n the Anthropometric Measurement Guidelines.  
9.12.3 Secondary Efficac y Variables  
The secondary efficacy endpoints include change from baseline in AGV (annualized to cm/yr), biomarker samples to evaluate the effect of BMN 111 on bone metabolism, BMN 111 pharmacodynamic biomarkers, growth parameters and body proportions, slee p 
apnea, skull and brain morphology, and clinical outcome assessments (developmental/functional/HRQoL status) . 
Weight will be measured at Screening and at study visits as indicated on the Sched ule of 
Events ( Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2).  
Biomarkers may include but are not limited to assessment of changes in bone and collagen metabolism (serum bone -specific alkali ne phosphatase, serum collagen type X, and urine 
C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type II [CTX -II]) and BMN  111
 bioactivity (plasma and 
urine cGMP). BioMarin or designee will perform analysis, a nd samples may also be used for 
assay development.   
Samples  for blood and/or urine biomarkers will be collected at the time points presented in 
the Schedule of Events ( Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2). Refer to the Study Laboratory Manual 
for instructions regarding obtaining and shipping samples. The sample type will also be 
included in the Study Laboratory Manual.  
9.12.3.1 Body Proportion Ratios of the Extremities  
Change from baseline in body proportion ratios of the extremities will be evaluat ed using 
anthropometric measurements and measurement ratios.  Refer to the Anthropometric Measurement Guidelines for specific instructions regarding the col lection of growth 
measurements. All age- appropriate physical measurements will be collected at appro ximately 
the same time each visit (±2 hours around the time when the first measurement assessment was taken at Screening) by a trained study staff member; every effort will be made to have the measurements collected by the same study staff member, if possi ble, throughout the 
study. Each measurement will be taken in triplicate (excluding weight, taken once).  
Study 111- 206A2 Page 77 
Proprietary and Confidential  8 February 2019  
Anthropometric measurement can be conducted either pre -dose or post- dose. Measurements 
may include but are not limited to length, standing height (if able to stand unsupported), 
crown -to-rump length, head circumference, upper and lower arm and leg, and arm span. 
Measurements not taken in the midsagittal plane should be taken on the right side of the body if possible and should always be taken on the same side of the body throughout the study 
Body proportion measurements may include but are not limited to upper arm:forearm length 
ratio, upper leg:lower leg length ratio, and armspan:standing height ratio. 
9.12.3.2 MRI  Assessment s 
MRI s are performed to evaluate the ef fect of BMN 111 on skull and brain morphology, 
including foramen magnum, ventricular, and brain parenchymal dimensions. MRI  assessment 
procedures for all vi sits must be performed as described in the Imaging Manual and can be 
conducted either pre-dose or post -dose.   
9.12.3.3 Sleep Study  
Given that sleep apnea is a finding in children with ACH ( Waters, 1993) and has impli cations 
on functional and health outcomes, a sleep study will be performed in a limited number of 
qualified sleep centers. A sleep -testing device will be used to assess the presence and severity 
of sleep -disordered breathing by measurement of blood oxygen saturation, pulse rate, and 
airflow during overnight monitoring. Assessment of episodes of sleep apnea will include, but may not be limited to, the number of episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour (Apnea/Hypopnea Index).   
9.12.3.4 Clinical Outcome Assessments  
Clinical out come assessments will be  administered t o asse ss the HRQoL  of study subjects. 
Functional I ndependence will be assessed.   Clinical out come assessments will be  performed 
at the time points indicated in the Schedules of Events (Table 9.1.1 and  Table 9.1.2) and the 
ITQoL  shoul d be administered p rior t o any  other assessments.   The  Wee-FIM and the 
Bayley-I II may be administered at any point deemed convenient during the visit. The age 
ranges for clin ical outcome assessment tools are shown in Figure 9.12.3.4.1.  The clinical 
outcome assessments are not  to be considered as source data for  AEs.

 Bayley- III 
The Bayley -III is a performance -based outcome assessment for use in children from 1 to 
42 months. It is individually administered by the trained clinician to the subj ect/child. 
The time required varies from 15 -60 minutes depending on the child’s developmental level 
and cooperation.  
Scales include Cog nitive subscale, Receptive and Expressive subscales, and Gross and Fine 
Motor subscales. The two language scales make up  a composite Language Scale score and 
the Gross and Fine Motor subscales yield a composite Motor Scale score.  
The scales have clinical and research utility as a diagnostic assessment for young children 
with varied disorders and disabilities, and reflect c urrent professional standards for early 
childhood assessment ( Bayley, 2006).  
In addition to its use for subjects ranging from 1 to 42 months old, the Bayley- III assessment 
will be administered to those entering the study between 42 and 60 months old (Figure 9.12.3.4.1) and for the remainder of the duration of this study, as this assessment can 
capture ongoing developmental issues associated with Achondroplasia.  Bayley -III is waived 
for subjects 
 < 1 month old. 
9.12.3.4.2 Functional Independence Measure (Wee- FIM)  
The Wee- FIM instrument is an assessment tool that measures functional performance across 
three domains (self -care, mobility and cognition) ( Ireland,  2011; Ireland, 2012).  
The Wee-FIM instrument has been used in previous research in children with ACH, and has identified ongoing limitations in functional performance across these domains extending 

 Study 111- 206A2 Page 79 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
beyond the age of 7 yea rs (Ireland, 2011).  Because the Wee- FIM considers the child’s 
performance from a caregiver’s perspect ive (Ireland, 2012),  this tool in turn gives an 
indicatio n of “burden of care” for families and caregivers of children with ACH.  Wee -FIM 
is waived for children < 6 months old. 
9.12.3.4.3 Infant and Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire (ITQOL) 
The Infant Toddler Quali ty of Life questionnaire (ITQOL) is an observer -reporte d outcome 
tool developed for use in children from 2 months to 5 years old that attempts to capture 
physical, mental and social well -being. The  ITQOL adopts the World Health Organization’s 
definition of  health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well -being, and not 
merely the absence of disease. The ITQOL also assesses the quality of the parent/guardians 
life.  The 97 -item full -length version (ITQOL) will be used for this study. Completion  time 
varies.  ITQOL is waived for subjects < 2 months old. The ITQOL should be administered 
prior to any other study assessments. 
9.12.4 Exploratory Efficacy Variables  
9.12.4.1 Clinical Photography 
To document the physical and phenotypic findings of  achondroplasia with a nd without 
treatment with study drug, clinical photography of the full body, face, spine, and extremities 
will be conducted. This assessment is optional. If the parents/caregivers decline clinical photography, the assessment will be waived for the duration of the study.  
9.12.4.2 Exploratory Biomarker Research S ample Analyses  
All samples collected in this study may be used for on- study exploratory biomarker research 
once the primary use has been completed.  
For each portion of the blood and urine samples reserved for  protocol -specified analyses, 
there may be mult iple sample aliquots. Once samples have been successfully analyzed during 
the study, unused sample portions may be used during the study for assay development or other purposes stated in this section. No exploratory genomic research will be conducted witho ut consent from the subject and his/her legally authorized representative (parent or legal 
guardian).  
9.12.4.3 Genomic Biomarker Analysis  
While the inherited FGFR3 mutations associated with achondroplasia are well char acterized, 
disease phenotype in monogeneic dise ases is often modified by variants in other genes. 
Exploratory genomics will include, but are not limited to NPR -B, BRAF, and other genes 
associated with CNP signaling. Exploratory genomic analysis may inform understanding of 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 80 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
the BMN 111 mechanism of action in achondroplasia. This analysis will not be conducted 
without express consent from the subject and his/her legally authorized representative (parent or legal guardian).  
9.12.5 Pharmacokinetics Variables  
PK plasma samples will be collected pre- dose and at 5 (± 2 min), 15 (± 2 min), 30 (± 5 min), 
45 (± 5 min), 60 (± 5 min), 90 (± 5 min), and 120 (± 5 min) minutes post -dose. On Day 1, 
additional PK samples will be collected at 180 (± 5 min) and 240 (± 5 min) minutes.  In the event of interruption of study drug adm inistration for a sentinel patient on Day 1 when PK 
samples are scheduled, the collection of PK samples should be delayed until the subsequent day and only performed after successful administration of study dr ug has been completed in a 
single injection. 
Whenever possible, the following PK parameters for sentinel subjects and for subjects 
randomized to BMN 111 will be estimated by non- compartmental analysis:  
• Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC
0-∞) 
• Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to the time of last 
measurable concentration (AUC 0-t) 
• Maximum observed plasma concentration (C max) 
• Time to reach C max (Tmax) 
• Elimination half -life ( t1/2) 
• Apparent clearanc e (CL/F)  
• Apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) 
Refer to the Study Laboratory Manual for additional instructions regarding obtaining and 
shipping samples. BioMarin will perform sample analysis, and samples may also be used for assay development.  
9.12.6 Safety Variables  
Safety will be evaluated by the i ncidence of AEs, SAEs, and clinically significant changes in 
vital signs, physical examination, ECG, imaging, and laboratory test results (urinalysis, 
chemistry, hematology). Additionally, imaging, hip monitoring, biomarker, immunogenicity, cortisol and pr olactin levels, and physical measurement data will be utilized for safety -related 
reviews and analysis.

Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
9.12.6.1 Adverse Events  
The occurrence of AEs will be assessed continuously from the time the subject receives study 
drug. The determination, evaluation and reporting of AEs will be performed as outlined in 
Section  10.2.1. Assessments of AEs will occur at the time points shown in the Schedule of 
Events ( Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2). Additionally, contact by a study staff member to the 
caregiver will be required every week for 6 months, and then every 2 weeks for the remainder of the study. During these contacts, study staff will ask the caregiver about dose administration and seek information on AEs and SAEs by specific questioning. Information on all AEs and SAEs should be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the AE eCRF.  
9.12.6.2 Procedures During the Study  
All concomitant procedures/ interventions /surgeries will be recorded after informed consent is 
obtained and after the first administration of study drug, until end of study. 
9.12.6.3 Imaging Assessment Procedures (per Schedule of Events)  
Imaging assessment procedures  for all visits must be performed using the same instruments.  
Imaging assessments can be conducted either pre -dose or post -dose.  
• Bilateral X -rays of entire lower extremity, anterior- posterior (AP) view, to assess 
long bone growth and pathology a s well as growth plate morphology. 
• Lumbar spine X -rays to measure changes from baseline in bone morphology and 
pathology.   
• DXA of whole body [less head], spine, to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and 
bone mineral content (BMC).  
Additional imaging may be  conducted should there be any issues or concerns with the 
subject’s imaging assessments. Imaging assessments will be collected and interpreted by a 
central reader. If clinically significant abnormalities are noted, the investigator or designee is required to assess whether it is appropriate to report an AE and if the subject should continue in the study. Refer to the vendor Imaging Guidelines for detailed imaging assessment requirements and procedures.  
9.12.6.4 Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Specific visits for ob taining cl inical laboratory assessment samples are provided in 
Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2. The scheduled clinical laboratory tests are listed in  
Table  9.12.6.4. 1. Refer to the Study Reference Manual for instructions on obtaining and 
shipping samples.

Any abnormal test results determined to be clinically significant by the Investigator should 
be repeated (at the Investigator’s discretion) unti l the cause of the abnormality is determined, 
the value returns to baseline or to within normal limits, or the Investigator determines that the abnormal value is no longe r clinically significant.  
The investigator should assess all abnormal clinical results and include a comment on whether or not  the result is clinically significant. Each clinically significant laboratory result 
should be recorded as an adverse event. 
The diagnosis, if known, associated with abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests that ar e 
considered clinically significant by t he Investigator will be recorded on the AE eCRF.

Subjects will be asked to provide blood and urine at the times indic ated in the Schedule of 
Event s (Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2).  Blood volume for testing has been reduced to the 
minimum necessary for adequate evaluation of efficacy and safety of BMN 111. 
For subjects  who have not previously had genetic testing confirming diagnosis of ACH, 
molecular genetic diagnosi s to identify the FGFR3 mutation (G346E, G375C, G380R, or 
“other”) will be performed.  If subjects had previous genetic testing, subjects must have a lab 
report from a certified laboratory with the study specific mutation documented.  
Salivary cortisol and serum prolactin will be collected at the times indicated in the Schedule 
of Events ( Table  9.1.1).  
Scheduled biomar ker and anti -BMN 111 antibody tests are listed in Table  9.12.6.5.1.

9.12.6.6 Child Behavior Checklist  
The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is for use in children from 1.5- 5 yea rs old, and will be 
administered for those entering the study at less than 5 years old and for the remainder of the 
duration of the study.  The  CBCL comprises 99 q uestions addressing symptoms related to 
mood, behavior issues, and sleep disturbance.  It is completed by the parent or primary caregiver.  
The form requires approximately 15 minutes to complete. The checklist yields scores in the following areas: reactivity, anxiety, depression, somatic complaints, withdrawal, sleep problems, attention problems, and aggressive behavior. CBCL is waived for children  < 18 months old. The CBCL should be administered prior to any other study 
assessments.

9.12.6.7 Vital Signs, Ph ysical Examinations and Other Observations  Related to Safety  
Vital signs assessed pre- dose will inclu de seated or supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measured in mm  Hg, heart rate in beats per minute, 
respiration rate in  breaths per minute, and temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). All treatment 
visits have pre- dose vita l sign assessments. Post -dose measurements include heart rate and 
BP. For all dosing visits, assessment frequency is detailed in Table  9.12.6.5.1 ( and Schedule 
of Events Tab le 9.1.1 and  Table  9.1.2).  
At Screening, after at least 5 minutes of rest, subject’s BP is taken in sitting or supine 
position. Vital sign measurements should be repeated and documented 3 times, with at least 5-minute intervals between assessments.  Left brachial arm should be the first method of 
assessment considered, and the same site should be used for blood pressure measurement in each subject throughout the study. The method and site of blood pressure measurem ent will 
be recorded and should be utilized consistently throughout the remainder of the study.  
At other visits, vital sign measurements are taken once per time point in a sitting or supine position after at least 5 min utes of rest. Heart rate should be taken at each time point that BP 
is measured. When blood samples and BP assessments are scheduled at the same time or within the same time window, BP should be measured before blood samples are drawn. If a BP measurement must be taken after a blood draw, ens ure adequate analgesia for the blood 
draw and wait several minutes before measuring BP. Pre- dose vital signs should always be 
taken and recorded prior to pre -dose blood draw. Vital signs may be monitored more 
frequently or for longer duration post -dose as clinically indicated.   
If a subject has signs potentially consistent with hypotension or a decrease in systolic BP of 20 mm Hg or more from pre -dose systolic BP, blood pressure and heart rate (BP/HR) should 
be measured  and recorded approximately every 15 minutes for the first hour and every 
30 minutes thereafter until the systolic BP returns to pre -dose systolic BP (or within the 
normal range for this subject as defined by PI) and signs (if present) resolve.  If the hypotension resolves within the first hour and returns to the normal range, additional BP monitoring as described above is not required. Detailed guidance for blood pressure 
measurements is provided in the Blood Pressure Instrument and Technique Guidelines.

least 5  minutes of rest.   
2. Heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate should be taken and recorded at each indicated time point.   
3. When blood samples and vital sign assessments are scheduled at the same time or within the same time 
window, vital signs should be measured before blood samples are drawn.   
4. If a vital sign measurement must be taken after a blood draw, ensure adequate analgesia for t he blood 
draw and wait several minutes before measuring vital signs.   
5. Vital signs m ay be monitored more frequently or for longer duration post -dose as clinically indicated.  
6. If a subject has a hypotensive event, or signs potentially consistent with hypotension, or a decrease of 20 mm Hg systolic BP or more from baseline (defined by pre -dose vitals collected that day), vital signs 
should be measured and recorded approximately every 15 minutes (± 5 minutes) for the first hour and 
every 30 minutes (± 5 minutes ) thereafter until the BP returns to baseline (or within the normal range for 
this s ubject as defined by PI) and signs (if present) resolve.  
7. If the decision is made to adjust the dose, vital signs will be obtained for at least 4 hr following the first dose at the adjusted dose level, similar to the Day 3, 8 schedule.  
8. If a dose adjustment  visit coincides with a visit at which a full PK is drawn, vital signs will be obtained 
for 8 hours, similar to the Day 1, 2 schedule.  
 
9.12.6.8 Mitigating the Risk of Potential Hypotension  
Study personnel and caregivers should be made aware of the potential risk of hypotension 
with BMN 111  administration.  Subjects must be well hydrated and at a minimum be fed 
prior to administration of BMN 111  or placebo.  If a recent  acute illness associated with 
volume depletion (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) has not compl etely resolved prior to the 
first dose of BMN  111 or placebo, BMN  111 or placebo dosing may be delayed until 
hydration status has improved (up to the maximum pe riod allowed for the screening 
window). 
Caregivers should be trained to observe and recognize th e signs of dehydration (e.g. from 
fever, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.) and contact the investigator prior to BMN 111 or placebo 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 86 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
administration if dehydration is sus pected. Site personnel and caregivers should be trained to 
identify the signs of hypotension and , if they occur, should implement first -aid strategies at 
the discretion of the investigator such as having the subject lie down supine, elevating the 
lower ext remities, and administering fluids. For guidelines on how to report adverse events 
associated wi th hypotension, refer to Section 10.3.1.4. 
9.12.6.9 Electrocardiography  
A standard 12- lead ECG will include heart rate, rhythm, intervals, axis, conduction defects, 
and anatomic abnormalities. The time of collection will be recorded. EC Gs sho uld be 
performed in triplicate with the subject supine at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2).  ECGs will be performed post -dose on study day visits 
at which a dose is given; in addition, on Day 1, ECGs will be performed pre -dose.  On days 
when PK samples are being drawn, ECGs should be performed within a 5- minute window 
prior to 30- minute PK assessment.  If clinically significa nt abnormalities are noted, the 
investigator or designee is required to assess whether it is appropriate for the subject to continue in the study.  
9.12.6.10 Hip Clinical Assessment  
The hip clinical assessment should be completed by an appropriately qualified physica l 
therapist or a physician (MD) i.e., the investigator or the sub -investigator at the time points 
indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table 9.1.1 and Table 9.1.2). Medical history will be 
obtained to evaluate for hip, thigh, or knee pain, or change in gai t. The physical exam 
(including observation of gait when possible) identifies and evaluates any changes in hip function or pain with as sessment of active and passive range of motion. Changes from 
baseline may trigger further evaluation based on the investi gator’s clinical assessment, which 
may include hip imaging and/or orthopedic consultation. If findings on clinical hip exam are determi ned to be clinically significant by the investigator and in consultation with Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor and orthopedic specialist (if needed), the DMC will be notified of AEs resulting from clinically significant abnormal hip monitoring assessments. DMC ma y 
provide recommendations as to if/when BMN  111 or placebo treatment should be 
temporarily or permanently discontinued.  
9.12.6.11 Pediatric Blood Volume  
Clinical labs and immunogenicity samples are necessary to perform to adequate safety 
assessment in this study.  The objectives of testing pharmacodynamics biomarkers are to demonstrate biologic activity of BMN  111
 and to understand t he impact of immune 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 87 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
responses on drug activity; and for blood biomarkers, to investigate the effects of treatment 
on changes in bone metabolism and endogenous CNP production.  
To minimize blood collection volumes, assay technologies were chosen that are cap able of 
sensitively detecting analytes using the lowest possible volume of blood for analysis.  Additionally, assays capable of detecting analytes in urine rather than blood have been selected where possible.  
9.12.6.12 Anti -BMN 111
 Immunogenicity Assessments  
Subject s randomized to receive BMN  111  or placebo will undergo immunogenicity testing. 
Blood (serum) samples for immunogenicity assessm ents will be collected at the time points 
indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table  9.1.1), and testing performed using validated 
assays. Neutralizin g antibody (NAb) testing will be performed on Baseline and TAb positive 
samples drawn from subjects weighing ≥  7.0 kg and waived for subjects <  7.0 kg.  
Scheduled samples will be tested in one  or more of the following assessments:  
• Anti- BMN 111  total antib ody (TAb)  
• Anti-BMN 111  antibody cross -reactive with endogenous CNP, ANP, and BNP (TAb)  
• Anti-BMN 111  NAb  
Testing for the presence of cross- reactive antibodies that bind to endogenous CNP, ANP, or 
BNP and for the presence of BMN 111  NAbs will be performed on baseline samples and 
anti- BMN 111  TAb-positive samples. Baseline NAb sample and cross- reactive TAb sample 
testing will be done at any time prior to the end of study. 
9.12.6.13 HPA Axis Assessments 
To address potential effects of BMN 111 on activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal 
(HPA) axis, assessment of salivary cortisol and serum Prolactin levels will be analyzed at the 
time points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table  9.1.1). Both tests will be done at 
Baseline, Week 26, and Week 52.  
9.12.6.14 IgE Safety Assessments 
Samples for total immunoglobulin E  (IgE) and drug- specific IgE  testing will be drawn on 
Day 1 and in the event of a significant hypersensiti vity AE, or at the discretion of the 
investigator and/or BioMarin. A significant hypersensitivity AE is defined as an event that is 
grade 3 or higher, requires temporary or perma nent cessation of BMN 111, or is determined 
to be significant at the discretio n of investigator and/or BioMarin (excluding reactions that 
are solely a localized injection site reaction). If a hypersensitivity AE occurs, an unscheduled 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 88 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
safety visit should occur no later than 48 hours of the start of the reaction, including 
inspection of the injection site and clinical laboratory tests.  
Blood (serum) samples should be collected and tested in one or more of the following assessments:  
•  Drug -specific IgE  
• Total IgE  
• Serum tryptase  
If feasible, a sample for drug -specific IgE should be drawn no sooner than 8 hours after the 
event start time or before the next dose. A sample for total IgE and serum tryptase should 
also be drawn within 1 hour of the start of the event  when possible or during the unscheduled 
safety visit.  
A localized injection site reaction is defined as skin signs or signs restricted to one affected 
primary location, i.e., hives, wheals, or swelling or an area of erythema, redness, induration, pain, or itching at or near the site of injection. Management of such localized react ions 
should be determined by the investigator’s clinical judgment in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor (if warranted).  
9.12.6.15 Unscheduled Safety Visits  
Unforeseen circumst ances may arise in which an unscheduled visit may be needed. In such a 
case, t he procedures performed at the unscheduled visit will be completed on a case -by-case 
basis.

10 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1 Safety Parameters and Definitions  
Safety assessments will con sist of monitoring and recording protocol -defined AEs and SAEs; 
measurement of  protocol -specified hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis variables; 
measurement of protocol -specified vital signs; and other protocol -defined events of special 
interest that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study drug.  
10.1.1 Adverse Events  
For this protocol, a reportable adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence 
(e.g., sign, symptom, illness, disease or injury) in a subject administered the study drug or other protocol -imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. This includes the following:  
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the course of the 
study.  
• Pre-existing medical conditions judged by the Investigator to have worsened in 
severity or frequency or changed in character during the study. 
• Complications that occur as a result of non -drug protocol -imposed interventions 
(eg, AEs related to screening procedures, medication washout, or no- treatment 
run-in). 
An adverse dr ug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study-drug caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the study -drug and the AE. 
Whenever possible, it is preferable to  record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series 
of terms relating to a  diagnosis.  
10.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets 
1 or more of the following criteria:  
• Is fatal  
• Is life threatening  
Note: Life -threatening refers to an event that places the subject at immediate risk of 
death. This definition does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization   
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 90 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the child or fetus of a subject exposed to IP 
prior to conception or during pregnancy 
• Is an important medical event or reaction – that, based on medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the above consequences (e.g. anaphylaxis)  
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for SAEs should be regarded as 
non-serious AEs.  
10.1.3 Events of Special Interest (EOSI)  
The following EOSI need to be reported to the Sponsor withi n 24 hours of site awareness, 
irrespective of seriousness, severity or causality:  
• Fracture  
• Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) 
• Avascular  necrosis or Osteonecrosis  
10.2 Methods and Timing for Capturing and Assessing Safety Parameters  
10.2.1 Adverse Event Reportin g Period  
For subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 (  ≥  24 to <  60 months old) and Cohort 2 (  ≥ 6 to   < 24 months 
old), the study AE reporting period is as follows: after informed consent but prior to initiation of study treatment, only SAEs associated with any protocol -imposed interventions will be 
reporte d.  After informed consent is obtained and the first  administration of study drug, all 
non-serious AEs and SAEs reporting period begins and continues until 4 weeks following 
either the last administration of study drug or the early termination visit, which ever is longer 
(refer to Section 12.1.11 ). The criteria for determining, and the reporting of, SAEs is 
provided in Section 10.1.2.  For subjects enrolled in Cohort 3 (0 to
 <  6 months old), the 
collection period for all AEs begins after informed consent is obtained.  
10.2.2 Eliciting Adverse Events 
Investigators will seek information on AEs and SAEs and EOSI, if applicable at each subject contact by specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all AEs 
and SAEs and EOSI, if applicable should be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the AE Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
10.2.3 Assessment of Seriousness, Severity, and Causality  
The Investigator or qualified designee responsible for the care of the subject will assess AEs for severity, relationship to study drug, and seriousness (refer to Section 10.1.2 for SAE 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 91 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
definitions).  These assessments should be made by a study clinician with the training and 
authority to make a diagnosis (e.g., MD/DO, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, or DDS).  
10.2.3.1 Seriousness  
The investigator will assess if an AE should be classified as “serious” based on the seriousness criteria enumerated in Section 10.1.2.  Seriousness ser ves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations.  
10.2.3.2 Severity  
Severity (as in mild, moderate, or severe headache) is not equivalent to seriousness, which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usual ly associated with events that pose a 
threat to a subject’s life or functioning.  The severity of each will be assessed using the defined categories in  Table  10.2.3.2.1. 
The Investigator  or qualified designee will determine the severity of each AE and SAE, and 
EOSI using the NCI CTCAE v4. Adverse events that do not have a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed according to the general guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE v4 
as stat ed below. 
Table  10.2.3.2.1:  Adverse Event Grading (Severity) Scale  
Grade  Description  
1 Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
2 Moderate: minimal, local  or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)a 
3 Severe  or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening : hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling ; limiting self -care ADLb 
4 Life threatening or debilitating: consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated  Grade 4 and 5 AEs 
should always be 
reported as SAEs  5 Death related to AE  
a Instrumental ADL refer to the following examples: preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the 
telephone, managing money.  
b Self-care ADL refer to the following examples: bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding oneself, using the toilet , 
taking medications, not bedridden.

10.2.3.3 Causality  
The Investigator will d etermine the relationship of an AE to the study drug and will record it 
on the source documents and AE eCRF.  To ensure consistency of causality assessments, 
Investigators should apply the guidance in Table  10.2.3.3.1. 
Table  10.2.3.3.1:  Causality Attribution Guidance  
Rela tionship  Description  
Not Related  • Exposure to the IP has not occurred  
OR 
• The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are not 
reasonably related in time  
OR 
• The AE is considered likely to be related to an etiology other than the use 
of the IP; that is, there are no facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest a causal relationship to the IP.  
Related  • The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably 
related in time  
AND  
• The AE could not be explained by factors or causes other than exposure 
to the IP  
                                                  OR 
 • The administration of IP and the occurrence of the AE ar e reasonably 
related in time  
AND  
• The AE is more likely explained by exposure to the IP than by other factors 
or causes.  
Factors suggestive of a causal relationship could include (but are not limited to):  
• Plausible temporal relationship  
• Absence of alternative explanations  
• Rarity of event in a given subject or disease state  
• Absence of event prior to study drug exposure  
• Consistency wi th study product pharmacology  
• Known relationship to underlying mechanism of study drug action  
• Similarity to adverse reactions seen with related drug products  
• Abatement of AE with discontinuation of study drug, and/or recurrence of AE with 
reintroduction of  study drug 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 93 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
The investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study 
documentation process.  Regardless of the Investigator’s assessment of causality for 
individual AE reports, the Sponsor will promptly evaluate all reported SAEs against 
cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investi gators and applicable regulatory authorities.  
10.3 Procedures for Recording Adverse Events 
10.3.1 Recording Adverse Events on a eCRF  
Investigators should use precise medical terminology when recording AEs or SAEs on an 
eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
Record only one diagnosis, sign, or symptom per event field on the AE eCRF (e.g., nausea 
and vomiting should not be recorded in the same entry, but as 2 separate entries).  
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferred terms will be assigned by the Sponsor  to the 
original terms entered on the eCRF, using MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) terminology.  
10.3.1.1 Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
Using accepted medical terminology, enter the diagnosis (if known).  If not known, enter sign(s) and/or  symptom(s).  If a diagnosis subsequently becomes available, then this 
diagnosis should be entered on the AE form, replacing the original entries where appropriate.  
10.3.1.2 Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events) should be 
identified by their primary cause.  For example, if severe diarrhea is known t o have resulted 
in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  
However, medically important e vents that may be linked and/or separated in time should be 
recorded as independent events on the eCRF.  For example, if severe hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on the eCRF.  
10.3.1.3 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between subject evaluation time points.  Such an eve nt should be recorded only once on the eCRF unless its 
severity increases or decreases (in which case it should be recorded again on the AE eCRF).  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject evaluation time points, but then subsequently recurs.  All recurrences of the AE should be recorded on the AE eCRF.  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 94 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
10.3.1.4 Hypotension  
If an asymptomatic drop in blood pressure meets the  protocol definition of AE per clinical 
judgment of the reporter, report the event as “blood pressure decreased.”  If the drop in blood 
pressure is associated with signs or symptoms, complete the symptomatic hypotension eCRF and use the following guidance to report the corresponding AE eCRF: If a unifying diagnosis is available to explain the event of hypotension, report the d iagnosis as an AE and capture 
signs and symptoms on the symptomatic hypotension eCRF page. If no other unifying diagnosis is availabl e, report “hypotension” as the event and capture signs and symptoms on 
the symptomatic hypotension eCRF page.  
10.3.1.5 Injection Si te Reactions 
If an injection site reaction is associated with a single sign or symptom, report the event on 
AE eCRF page (e.g., redne ss at injection site, AE is injection site redness). If the injection 
site reaction is associated with multiple signs or sy mptoms, report injection site reaction as 
the adverse event on the AE page, and individual signs and symptoms will be reported on the  
ISR eCRF page (e.g., if the subject experiences redness and induration, report “Injection site 
reaction” on the AE page, a nd in the corresponding Injection eCRF page, report erythema 
and induration).  If the injection site reaction appears after 24 hours, add “delayed” to the 
term used to describe the event.  
10.3.1.6 Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Laboratory test results will be recorded on the laboratory results pages of the eCRF, or 
appear on electronically produced laboratory reports submitted directly from the cent ral 
laboratory, if applicable.  
Any laboratory result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for a SAE should be reported as such, 
in addition to being recorded as an AE in the eCRF.  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as AE if it is not oth erwise refuted 
by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality and any  one or more of the following conditions 
is met:  
• Accompan ied by clinical symptoms  
• Leading to a change in study medication (e.g. dose modification, interruption or 
permanent discontinuation)  
• Requiring a change in concomitant therapy (e.g. addition of, interruption of, discontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or treatment).  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 95 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degr ee that requires active management (e.g., change of dose, 
discontinuation of study drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.)  
This applies to any protocol and non- protocol specified safety and efficacy laboratory res ult 
from tests performed after the first dose of study medication that falls outside the laboratory 
reference ra nge and meets the clinical significance criteria.  
This does not apply to any abnormal laboratory result that falls outside the laboratory 
reference range but that does not meet the clinical significance criteria (these will be analyzed and reported as labo ratory abnormalities), those that are considered AEs of the type 
explicitly exempted by the protocol, or those which are a result of an AE that has already been reported.  
10.3.1.7 Pre-existing Conditions  
A pre -existing condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such conditions 
should be recorded as medical history on the appropriate eCRF.  
A pre -existing condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE during the study only  if the 
frequency, intensity, or character of the condition worsens during the study period.  It is 
important to convey the concept that a pre -existing condition has changed by including 
applicable language in the verbatim d escription of the event (e.g., more frequent  headaches).  
10.3.1.8 General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening , any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a pre -existing 
condition (refer to Section 10.3.1.7).  Du ring the study, any new clinically significa nt 
findings and/or abnormalities discovered on physical examination that meet the definition of 
an AE (or an SAE) must be recorded and document as an AE or SAE on the AE eCRF.  
10.3.1.9 Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization, or Surgery 
Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as an SAE unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol (refer to Section 10.1.2).  
There are some hospitalization scenarios that do not require reporting as an SAE when there is no occurrence of an AE.  These scenarios include planned hospitalizations or prolonged hospitalizations to:  
• Perform a protocol -mandated efficacy measurement 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 96 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
• Undergo a diagnostic procedure  
• Elective surgical procedure for a pre -existing medical condition that has not changed  
• Receive scheduled therapy (study drug or otherwise) for the study indication 
10.3.1.10 Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the AE reporting peri od (refer to Section  10.2.1), regardless of 
attribution, will be recorded on the AE eCRF and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor as an 
SAE.  
When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the eCRF.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, record “Unexplained Death” or “Death of Unknown Cause” on the eCRF.  If the death is attri buted to progression of the 
disease or condition being studies, record “ -” as the SAE term on the eCRF.  
10.4 Reporting Requirements  
The Sponsor is responsible for identifying, preparing, and reporting all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) to the relevant competent authorities, ethics committees, and investigators in accordance with requirements identified in the Clinical Trials Regulations.
 
10.4.1 Expedited Reporting Requirements  
All SAEs and EOSI, if applicable that occur during the course of the  AE Reporting Period 
(refer to Section 10.2.1), whether or not considered related to study drug, must be reported by 
entering the information in the AE eCRF and submitting to BPV within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event.  Ea ch SAE must also be reported on the appropriate eCRF.  
Investigators should not wait to collect information that fully documents the event before notifying BPV of a n SAE.  BioMarin may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory 
authorities within 7 c alendar days of being notified about the event; therefore, it is important 
that Investigators submit any information requested by BioMarin as soon as it becomes available.  
If the electronic data capture (EDC) is unavailable, all SAEs should be reported to BPV by completing the SAE Report Form and faxing or emailing the completed form to BPV within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event. Once the EDC is avai lable, the information 
should be entered in the AE eCRF.  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 97 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
The reporting period for SAEs begi ns after informed consent is obtained and continues until 
4 weeks following either the last administration of study drug or study 
discontinuation/termination, whichever is longer.  
10.4.2 IRB Reporting Requirements  
Reporting of SAEs to the IRB will be done in com pliance with the standard operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB and with applicable regulatory requirements. Adequate documentation must be obtained by BioMa rin showing that the IRB was properly and 
promptly notified as required.  
10.5 Follow -up of Subjec ts after Adverse Events 
The Investigator should follow all unresolved AEs/SAEs until the events are resolved or have stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treatment 
or participation is not the cause of the A E/SAE.  Resolution of AEs and SAEs (with dates) 
should be documented on the AE eCRF and in the subject’s medical record to facilitate source data verification.  
For some SAEs, the Sponsor may follow  up by telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a 
monitoring visit to obtain additional case details (eg, hospital discharge summary, consultant 
report, or autopsy report) deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE r eport.  
10.6 Post-Study Adverse Events  
At the last scheduled visit, the Investigator should instru ct each subject to report, to the 
Investigator and/or to BPV directly, any subsequent SAEs that the subject’s personal 
physician(s) believes might be related to pri or study treatment.  
The Investigator should notify the study Sponsor of any death or SAE occ urring at any time 
after a subject has discontinued or terminated study participation, if the Investigator believes 
that the death or SAE may have been related to prior study treatment . The Sponsor should 
also be notified if the Investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject who participated in this study.  
10.7 Urgent Safety Measures 
The regulations  governing clinical trials state that the sponsor and Investigator are r equired to 
take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect subjects against any immediate hazards that may affect the safety of subjects, and that the appropriate regulatory bodies should be notified according to their respective regulations. According to the EU Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, “…in the light of the circumstances, notably the occurrence of any 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 98 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of t he investigational 
medicinal product where that new event is likely to a ffect the safety of the subjects, the 
sponsor and the Investigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect the 
subjects against any immediate hazard. The sponsor shall  forthwith inform the competent 
authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensure that the IRB/EC/REB is notified at the same time.”  
The Sponsor is responsible for identifying, preparing and reporting all SUSARs to the 
relevant competent authorities, ethics committees and investigators in accordance with  the 
requirements identified in the Clinical Trials Regulations.  
The reporting period for these events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures is the period from  the time of signing of the ICF through the completion of the last 
study visit or at the Early Termination Visit (ETV). Investigators are required to report any events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures to BioMarin within 24 hours.  
Examples of situations that may require urgent safety measures inclu de discovery of the 
following:  
• Immediate need to revise the IP administration (eg, modified dose amount or frequency 
not defined in protocol)  
• Lack of study scientific value, or detrimental study conduct or management  
• Discovery that the quality or safety of  the IP does not meet established safety 
requirements

11 APPROPRIATENESS OF M EASUREMENTS  
The parameters to be evaluated in this study reflect the combined experience in the clinical 
study 111- 202 and reflect the need to further define the efficacy and safety profile of 
BMN 111  in the context of ACH, a complex skeletal dysplasia disorder with multiple clinical 
mani festations.  
The efficacy parameters to be evaluated in this study reflect the sponsor’s experience in the 
clinical study 111 -202 and of previous studies of approved growth products ( Kemp,  2009; 
Bright, 2009 ).  Evaluation of the parameters proposed in this study will document the effect 
of BMN  111  treatment on AGV in young children with ACH and are relevant to assessing 
the medical complications of ACH in this patient popula tion.   
The PK assessments in this study are generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant.  
Bone -related biomarkers and other biochemical markers of the pharmacological activity of 
BMN 111  in the blood or urine are secondary assessments. Genomic  biomarkers are 
exploratory assessments.

13 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
BioMarin personnel  or designees will visit the study site prior to initiation of the study to 
review with the site personnel information about the IP, protocol and other regulatory 
document requirements, any applicable randomization procedures, source document requirements,  eCRFs, monitoring requirements, and procedures f or reporting AEs, including 
SAEs.  
At visits during and after the study, a CRA will monitor the site for compliance with regulatory documentation, with a focus on accurate and complete recording of data on e CRFs 
from source documents, adherence to protocol , randomization (if applicable), SAE reporting 
and drug accountability records.  
Sites will enter study data into eCRFs into the study EDC system.  Data Quality Control will be performed by BioMarin Clinical  Data Management or designee through implementati on 
of quality control checks specified in the study data management plan and edit check specifications. Additional subject -reported study data may be entered into the study EDC 
system via electronic diary.

14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SI ZE  
14.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide additional details on the planned statistical 
analysis. Unless otherwise stated, all analyses will be performed using SAS  v. 9.4.  
14.1.1 Interim Analyses  
An interim analysis will be carried out to support NDA/MAA filing. The study team, subjects, and investigators will have no access to the individual subject treatment allocation, and blinded pooled safety outputs will be provided for the randomized subjects.  
14.1.2 Procedures for Accou nting for Missing, Unused and Spurious Data  
Because the completeness of the data affects the integrity and accuracy of the final study analysis, every effort will be made to ensure complete, accurat e and timely data collection 
and, therefore, avoid missing data. In addition, a subject who prematurely discontinues study drug should be asked if they are willing to continue to participate in the study assessments for remaining duration of the study, as long as in the judgment of the investigator such continued 
participation would not detrimentally affect the health, safety, or welfare of the subject.  
No missing data will be imputed for any analysis, except for unless otherwise specified for the efficacy analyses or for the missing dates for AEs and concomitant medications. Missing 
dates or partially missing dates will be imputed conservatively to ensure that an AE is 
considered treatment emergent and has the longest possible duration, if the partial infor mation available indicates that the AE is likely treatment  emergent.  
Additional details regarding the handling of missing data will be provided in the SAP. 
14.2 Safety Analysis  
The safety analysis will be performed on safety population as defined in Section 14.7.2 and 
will be considered descriptive.  
All AEs will be coded using the most current version of MedDRA will be used by the Sponsor to assign system organ class and preferred term classification to events and diseases, 
based on the original terms entered on the CRF. 
All AEs will be coded using MedDRA. The incidence of AEs will be summarized by system 
organ class, preferred term, relationship to study treatment (as assessed by investigator), and 
severity. All AEs, including SAEs and AEs that lead to permanent discontinuation from the study and from the study treatment, will be listed. Hypersensitivity reactions and 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 112 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
symptomatic hypotension are of interest, and the percentage of subjects who report these AEs 
will be presented. Hypersensitivity reactions will be defined in the SAP.  
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized by the type of laboratory test. For each clinical laboratory test, descriptive statistics will be provided on baseline as well as all subsequent visits.  
All other safety measures including laboratory tes ts, vital signs, ECG, echocardiogram, hip 
clinical assessment, and concomitant medication data will also be summarized descriptively. Data summaries will be presented by treatment gro up (when applicable) for each cohort and 
overall. All safety results will be listed. 
14.3 Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy analysis will be performed on the efficacy population as defined in Section 14.7.1. 
Efficacy endpoints include length/height AGV and length/height standard score (Z -score) at 
Week 52.  
For a given interval [Date1, Date2], the AGV is defined as follows:  
AGV = Length /standing  height  at Day  2− Length /standing  height  at Day  1
Interval  Length  (Days ) ×365.25  
 
where the interval length in days is calculated as Date2 – Date1. AGV will be calculated for 
the following visits/intervals:  
• Baseline: [Date of last length/he ight measurement in study 901 at lea st 6 months prior 
to Day 1 in study 206, Date of Day 1]  
• Week 13: [Date of Day 1, Date of Week 13]  
• Week 26: [Date of Day 1, Date of Week 26]  
• Week 39: [Date of Day 1, Date of Week 39]  
• Week 52 (12- month): [Date of Day 1, Da te of Week 52]  
The baseline of the A GV is established in the natural history study of Study111- 901, based 
on the standing height measurements in the last 6 months prior to enrollment to Study 111-206. AGV will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, minimum, 
and maximum ). Results will be summarized by treatment group and cohort . 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 113 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
The measurement of length/standing height will be converted to age -and sex -appropriate 
standard score (SDS), also referred to as Z -score, by comparison with normal reference 
standards (not ACH). The Z- score will be summarized similarly to growth velocity.  
Comparisons between treatment groups by cohort on these variables will be carried out 
where appropriate. Statistical comparisons will be considered descriptive . Additional details 
regarding effic acy analysis will be provided in the SAP.  
14.4 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Subjects randomized to receive BMN 111 or placebo will undergo pharmacokinetic testing.  
For subjects randomized to BMN 111, PK parameters generated over  the course of the study 
will be evaluated and summarized with descriptive statistical measures (mean, standard deviation, CV%, min, median and max). Correlative analyses of some of the PK par ameters 
with efficacy, safety and immunogenicity measures may be conducted.  
14.5 Immunogenicity Analysis  
Immunogenicity will be summarized as change from baseline as well as by study time point in subjects randomized to receive BMN 111 or placebo.  Results will be summarized as incidence and titer for all cohorts. Addition ally, immunogenicity may be assessed for 
correlations with measures of safety, PK, and efficacy.  
14.6 Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 70 subjects age 0 to
 < 60 months at study entry will participate in this study. 
No formal sample size calculations w ere performed. The number of subjects is considered 
appropriate to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BMN  111 in the target population.  
14.7 Analysis Populations  
14.7.1 Efficacy Population  
All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of double -blinded BMN 111 or 
placebo in this study.  
14.7.2 Safety Population   
All subjects who received at least one dose of double -blinded BMN 111 or placebo in this 
study.

15 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE  
In addition to safety and PK monitoring by BioMarin personnel, an independent DMC wil l 
act as an advisory body to BioMarin and will monitor the safety and PK of subjects in the 
study. After the sentinel subjects complete 12 weeks of dosing, a DMC review will occur t o 
evaluate all available safety and PK data.  Upon approval by the DMC, the  next younger 
cohort will be opened and the 3 sentinel subjects will be enrolled.  
The DMC will make recommendations for stopping or continuing the study on an individual subject lev el and/or on a cohort level per the pre -specified stopping criteria. Based on criteria 
outlined in the protocol, the DMC may also make endorsements for dose adjustments if needed.  
Please see DMC Charter for further details.

16 COSTS, COMPENSATION,  AND SUBJECT INJURY  
There will be no charge to study subjects to be in this study. Bi oMarin will pay all costs of 
tests, procedures, and treatments that are part of this study. In addition, after IRB/IEC/REB 
approval, BioMarin may reimburse the reasonable cost of tr avel for study -related visits in 
accordance with BioMarin’s study -specific travel and reimbursement policy. BioMarin will 
not pay for any hospitalizations, tests, or treatments for medical problems of any sort related solely to the study subject’s disease.  Costs associated with such hospitalizations, tests, and 
treatments should be billed and collected in the way that such costs are usually billed and collected outside the study. 
The Investigator should contact BioMarin immediately upon notification that a study subject 
has been injured by the study drug or by procedures performed as part of the study. 
Any subject who experiences a study -related injury should be instructed by the Investigator 
to seek immediate medical treatment at a pre- specified medical institution if possible, or at 
the closest medical treatment facility if necessary. The subject should be given the name of a person to contact to seek further information about, and assistance with, treatment for 
study- related injuries. The treating physicia n should bill the subject’s health insurance 
company or other third party payer for the cost of this medical treatment. If the cost of the 
medical treatment is not covered by health insurance or another third party that usually pays these costs, then either BioMarin or the institution may pay for reasonable and necessary medical services to treat the injuries caused by the study drug or study procedures. In some 
jurisdictions, BioMarin is obligated by law to pay for study- related injuries without prior 
recourse to third party payer billing and/or regardless of fault. If this is th e case, BioMarin 
will comply with the law.

Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
17 CASE REPORT FORMS AND SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
Electronic case report forms will be provided for each subject. The Investigator must review 
and el ectronically sign the completed eCRF casebook to verify its accuracy.  
eCRFs  must be completed using a validated web -based application. Study site personnel will 
be trained on the application and will enter the clinical data from source documentation, excep t in instances when electronic subject -reported data is transmitted directl y into EDC, as 
referenced in the study specific vendor management plan. Unless explicitly allowed in the eCRF instructions, blank data fields are not acceptable.  
In the event of an entry error, or if new information becomes available, the value will be corrected by deselecting the erroneous response and then selecting or entering the factual 
response. In compliance with 21 CFR Part  11, the system will require the personnel making 
the correction to enter a reason for changing the value. The documented audit  trail will 
include the reason for the change, the original value, the new value, the time of the correction and the identity of the operator.  
BioMarin’s policy is that study data o n the eCRFs must be verifiable to the source data, 
which necessitates acces s to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records. 
In addition, all source data should be attributable (signed and dated). The Investigator must therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subjects (or their legally autho rized 
representative) must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects will be informed 
of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed consent. If direct  source 
document verification of study data by the site monitor is prohibit ed by institutional policy or 
local law, then the Investigator must make available facilities and/or personnel to allow GCP -compliant source verification to occur. Examples of such methods include certified 
copies of records which have study data visible b ut sensitive information redacted, or other 
GCP -compliant means agreed between the Investigator and the Sponsor.  
A CRA designated by BioMarin will compare the eCRFs with the origina l source documents 
at the study site and evaluate them for completeness and  accuracy before designating them as 
“Source Data Verified” (SDV). Electronic Subject -reported data transferred directly into 
EDC will not be SDV’d or queried. If an error is discovered at any time or a clarification is needed, the CRA, or designee, will c reate an electronic query on the associated field. Site 
personnel will then answer the query by either correcting the data or responding to the query. The CRA will then review the response and determine either to close the query or re–query the site if the  response does not fully address the question. This process is repeated until all 
open queries have been answered and closed.  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 117 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
Before a subject’s eCRF casebook can be locked, data f ields must be source data verified and 
all queries closed. Refer to the Stu dy Monitoring Plan for details on which fields must be 
source data verified.  The Investigator will then electronically sign the casebook, specifying 
that the information on the eCR Fs is accurate and complete. The Data Manager, or designee, 
will then set the status of the forms, visits, and the entire casebook to Locked. Upon completion of the CSR, an electronic copy of each site’s casebooks will be copied to a compact disk (CD) and sent to each site for retention with other study documents.

Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
18 STUDY MONITORING AND AUDITING  
Qualified individuals designated by BioMarin will monitor all aspects of the study according 
to GCP and standard operating procedures for compliance with applicable government regulations. The Investigator agrees to allow these monitors dire ct access to the clinical 
supplies, dispensing, and storage areas and to the clinical files, including original medical records, of the study subjects, and, if requested, agrees to assist the monitors. The 
Investigator and staff are responsible for being present or available for consultation during routinely scheduled site visits conducted by BioMarin or its designees.  
Members of BioMarin’s GCP Compliance Department or designees may conduct an audit of a clinical site at any time before, during, or after co mpletion of the study. The Investigator 
will be informed if an audit is to take place and advised as to the scope of the audit. Representatives of the FDA or other Regulatory Agenci es may also conduct an audit of the 
study. If informed of such an inspection, the Investigator should notify BioMarin immediately. The Investigator will ensure that the auditors have access to the clinical supplies, study site facilities, original source d ocumentation, and all study files.

19 RETENTION OF RECORDS   
The Investigator m ust retain all study records required by BioMarin and by the applicable 
regulations in a secure and safe facility. The Investigator must consult a BioMarin 
representative before disposal of any study records, and must notify BioMarin of a ny change 
in the l ocation, disposition or custody of the study files. The Investigator /institution must 
take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of essential documents, that is, documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced, including paper copies of study records (e.g., subject charts) as well as any original source documents that are electronic as required by applicable regulatory requirements.  
All study records must be re tained for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in the US or an ICH region and until (1) there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in the U.S. or an ICH region or (2) at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP. The Investigator /institution should retain subject identifiers for at least 15 years after the completion or discontinuation 
of the study. Subject files and other source data must  be kept for the m aximum period of time 
permitted by the hospital, institution or private practice, but not less than 15 years. 
These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by a B ioMarin agreement.  BioMarin must be notified 
and will assist with retention should Investigator /institution be unable to continue 
maintenance of subject files for the full 15 years. It is the responsibility of BioMarin to inform the Investigator/institution as to when thes e documents no longer need to be retained.

tolerability of BMN 111 administered for 6 months and up to 24 months and includes secondary objectives consisting of 13

Section No./Title  Revision  Rationale  
determination of change from baseline in AGV, growth parameters, body proportions, and  evaluation of the dose -
exposure and PK profiles of BMN 111 in children with ACH. 
Analysis of safety data from the 6 month initial phase of Study 111 -202 showed that treatment with BMN 111 was 
generally well tolerated at all dose levels (refer to current Investigators Brochure for specific details). 
Analysis of efficacy data from Study 111 -202 demonstrated that that subjects given BMN 111 at the dose of 15 µg/kg 
daily had an improvement in AGV, with approximately ~50% increase over baseline seen with treatment for 6 months 
which was sustained after continued treatment for 12 months. 
Subjects treated with 30 µg/kg daily also showed similar improvement in mean AGV after 6 months and their mean 
changes from baseline in AGV were similar to subjects treated wi th 15 µg/kg daily. Safety data for the 30- µg/kg daily 
dose was also similar to the 15 -µg/kg daily dose.  Given that no clinicall y significant difference could be identified 
between the 15 µg/kg and 30 -µg/kg daily dose in the Phase 2, 6 month safety and eff icacy data, the lower of the two 
doses has been chosen for this Phase 2 study.

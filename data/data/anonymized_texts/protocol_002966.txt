Disease (CGD) refractory to conventional therapy and without a HLA matched sibling donor by performing stem cell tr ansplantation (SCT) from 5/6 or 6/6 
HLA matched unrelated or 5/6 or 6/6 HLA phenotype matched related donors. 1.3.2.  To examine the potential for reversal of organ toxicity (e.g. lung, liver, 
intestine) following engraftment and stable normal neutrophil function. 
 
2. Background  
2.1. Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is a life threatening primary 
immunodeficiency caused by the abnormal function of any of four components of the 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase system present in the 
phagocitic cells.  The estimated incidence of CGD in the United States is between 1/200,000 – 1 /255,000 live births.(1)  
 2.2. The most common (accounting for 70% of CGD occurrences) and severe form of 
CGD is caused by an X -linked recessive mutation of the NADPH oxidase protein 
subunit gp91
phox.  This mutation as well as 3 additional mutations affecting other 
component proteins of the  NADPH oxidase system result in marked susceptibility to 
life-threatening infections, primarily severe recurrent bacterial and fungal infections.  
These infections are the direct result of an inability of phagocytic leukocytes (e.g. neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes), to generate superoxide and its metabolites, hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid, necessary for intracellular killing and 
activation of anti- microbicidal enzymes. (2) CGD patients have exaggerated 
susceptibility to infection with catalase-positive pathogens (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, 
Aspergillus species, Nocardia species, Candida species, Gram-negative enteric bacilli).  These infections present primarily as pneumonia (75-80%), abscess formation (64-70%, 
[subcutaneous, liver, lung, perirectal, and brain]), adenitis (32-59%) or osteomyelitis (14 – 27%) , among others. (1) Absent effective intracellular killing necessitates the 
prolonged use of antibiotics and ultimately the appearance  of resistant strains. This 
5 
illustrates the complicated task of providing adequate antimicrobial prophylaxis and 
treatment to CGD patients.(3) 
 
2.3. In spite of our efforts, the morbidity and mortality for this patient population 
cont inues to be extremely high, primarily among patients with the X- linked form of the 
disease who appear to have a more severe clinical phenotype.   These patients often die 
in the first or second decade of life.     Morbidity and mortality often follow bouts  of 
severe pneumonia with attendant complications (e.g. dissemination to chest wall, 
vertebrae and central nervous system). 
 
2.4.   Continuous prophylactic antibiotic therapy with trimethropin -
sulfamethoxasole or itraconazole is not sufficient to prevent recurr ent infections in this 
patient population.  In our experience, prophylactic administration of antifungal agents has failed to prevent infection. Once infected these agents are often inadequate to the task. As eradication of invasive fungal infections relies primarily on aggressive antibiotic therapy, CGD affected children repeatedly spend weeks or months in the hospital receiving therapy with multiple antibiotics.  
 
2.5. A landmark in the medical care of CGD patients was the introduction during 
the last decade of interferon gamma therapy as standard of care for this patient population. The mechanism by which interferon therapy decreases the number of infections is unclear but in spite of this therapy about 50% of children still experience severe recurrent infecti ons. (1;4;5) 
2.6. Morbidity that accompanies prolonged hospitalizations and aggressive 
antibiotic therapy may be worsened by the need for surgical resection of necrotic and infecte d tissue. Granuloma of the lung or liver, abscess, empyema, osteomyelitis, etc. 
complicate the management of infections.  Due to the frequency and severity of lung infections and the need for surgical intervention, patients are often left with severe pulmo nary insufficiency, oxygen dependency or inability to participa te in activities of 
daily life (e.g. school).  In addition, this aggressive care can lead to irreparable 
secondary organ damage (e.g. renal failure, deafness, oxygen dependency, pancreatitis), further compromising the already poor quality of life, and perpetuating an endless need for chronic care.  
 
3. Stem Cell Transplantation – Rationale  
3.1. Therapy for CGD has been largely symptomatic as noted above. Whi le 
symptomatic treatment may adequately control specific infections, over time CGD patients invariably develop progressive tissue injury, such as to the lung or liver, from chronic infections. The treatment itself can be injurious, for example persistent administration of renal toxic antibiotics may compromise renal function. More than half of CGD patients die before the end of the third decade of life and for most of the others the quality of life is diminished by the chronic disease manifestations.(6)  3.2. Neutrophil dysfunction that arises from the defect that underlies CGD can be 
compensated by granulocyte transfusions. These have been reported as life-saving in 
circumstances of severe infections, poorly responsive to drug therapy and 
6 
unapproachable surgically. Clearly the benefit of this approach is due to the 
administration of functioning neutrophils capable of effective microbial phagocytosis. 
Unfortunately, granulocyte transfusions are complicated by fever and respiratory distress, and with the invariable development of leukoagglutinins poor granulocyte recovery. White blood cell transfusions are never an effective maintenance strategy.(1)   
 
3.3. Based upon patterns of X-inactivation in X -linked carriers of CGD, both 
affected and unaffected neutrophils are produced. Unaffected or normal neutrophil 
production does not show a proliferative advantage over abnormal neutrophils. Typically, CGD carriers with as few as 10% normal phagocytes do not develop serious infections.(1)This suggests that susceptibility to infection in CGD can be prevented by a relatively small portion of normal cells admixed with a larger number of abnormal 
cells.  
3.4. Clinical manifestations of CGD are limited to the consequences of abnormal 
neutrophil function. Implicit therefore is that CGD patients should benefit substantially, and perhaps be cur ed, if normal neutrophil production can be 
established. This is the premise underlying the role for stem cell transplantation in CGD. (1)  
 3.5. There are now adequate data to substantiate stem cell transplantation as best 
practice for CGD patients with HLA matched related donors.  
 
 
3.5.1.  The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and 
the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) reported on the outcome for 27 patients with CGD undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation between 1985 and 2000.(7) Pati ents (23 males) ranged from 0.8 to 38.7 years of age, median 
age 7 years, at transplantation. All patients had at least one prior episode of invasive infection; 9 patients had therapy-refractory infection (n=8 fungus; n=1 
mycobacterium) at transplantation. Of the remaining 18 patients, 7 evinced signs 
of active inflammation or organ sequelae from prior illness. Donors were HLA matched siblings for 25 patients (5/25 CGD carriers) and matched unrelated donors for 2 patients. Busulfan (16 – 20 mg/kg total dose ) combined with 
cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, or melphalan comprised the conditioning regimen for 23 patients; 4 patients received less than fully myeloablative therapy. All patients received cyclosporine; some received either methotrexate or prednisone i n addition, as GVHD preventive therapy. 
 
Twenty -two/23 patients transplanted after myeloablative therapy engrafted, 
while 2/4 patients transplanted using submyeloablative therapy failed to 
engraft. The median time to granulocyte recovery was 18 days (9 to 40 days). For 
the 24 engrafted patients, NBT assay reached donor levels (5 pts transplanted from CGD carriers exhibited a mosaic pattern of NBT positivity).   Four/27 patients have died and deaths were exclusive to the group of 9 patients who underwent tra nsplant with therapy- refractory infection (n=2 from 
progressive infection; n=1 carotid hemorrhage; n=1 inflammatory pulmonary 
7 
reaction and skin GVHD). It is noteworthy, however, among this same 
therapy-refractory cohort, 4 patients actively infected with Aspergillus survived and eradicated their infection after engraftment. Overall 81%, 22/27, patients are alive, 21/22 maintain complete donor myeloid chimerism, and all are without clinical or laboratory findings of CGD. Seven/27 patients experienced grade I I-IV 
GVHD, and 3 patients have developed chronic GVHD. Two patients who 
received stem cells from HLA matched but unrelated donors (MUD) are alive 
and well.   Beyond the excellent survival and the ability to eradicate infection in therapy-refractory patients, improvements were documented in lung function (lessened restrictive pulmonary function, discontinued supplemental oxygen, resolution of clubbing), resolution of colitis, and increased growth rate. 3.5.2.  In a study conducted at the NIH, 10 patients with CGD un derwent 
peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from matched siblings.(8) All 
patients were male, from 5 – 36 y/o, median 15 years; CGD in 8 of these was 
caused by the X -linked mutation. Seeking to avoid transplant related 
morbidity/mortality, nonmyeloablative transplant conditioning therapy was 
employed: fludarabine 25 mg/m
2 days –5 to – 1 and cyclophosphamide 60 
mg/kg days –7 and - 6. GVHD preventive therapy included cyclosporine and 
T-cell depletion. Donors underwent leukapharesis after 4 days G- CSF priming 
and were collected on days 5 and 6. Manipulation of these products included 
CD34 + selection using the Isolex 300i system and treatment with T- cell 
monoclonal antibodies (CD2, CD6, and CD7).  Other manipulations included T-cell ‘add -back’ to provide the recipient with 1 X 10
5/kg CD3+ T -cells, and 
periodic infusions of donor T -cells pos t PBSCT to promote full donor 
engraftment. 
 
As anticipated conditioning regimen related toxicity was negligible. Neutrophil 
recovery occurred at the median d+10 (range 6- 22 days) and thrombocytopenia 
(< 20,000/mm3) occurred in only 4 patients, resolving by d+11 at the latest. 
Unfortunately, 1 patient failed to engraft and died from complications related to 
a second transplant; and 1 patient developed late graft failure. At 17 months median follow up post PBSCT, 6/8 patients maintain complete (n=4) or almost complete myeloid and lymphoid chimerism, while 2 patients are stable mixed chimeras. Two of these 8 patients died, 1 from complications of GVHD (3 patients developed > grade II acute GVHD) and 1 from bacterial sepsis. It is noteworthy that the onset of ac ute GVHD followed donor T -cell infusions.  
 Although hematopoietic recovery ensued rapidly post PBSCT, complete donor 
chimerism, when it occurred, required weeks to months to establish. 
Furthermore it was necessary to administer multiple donor T -cell infusions to 
promote donor chimerism and for several patients this process instigated GVHD. Others have observed incomplete chimerism following subablative conditioning. Thus the benefit of this approach is not compelling when compared to the EBMT/ESID report.   
8 
3.5.3.  While fewer patients with CGD have been transplanted from donors 
other than HLA matched siblings, reports indicate that the outcome is no less 
satisfactory.(7;9 -11)  Seven of eight such patients were reported to have engrafted 
following fully ablative conditioning, and all engrafted patients remained alive.   
3.6. A number of reports find that the overall survival is comparable between 
matched sibling and matched unrelated donor transplants.(12;13) Comparison between 
patient groups is problematic; however our results for transplantation of children with aplastic anemia find the 4-year event free survival very similar for patients transplanted from matched sibling donors (92%) verus patients transplanted form matched unrelated donor (88%). There is no reason to believe that results should be inferior in the setting of matched unrelated donor transplantation for CGD.  3.7.  Subablative or nonmyeloablative transplant conditioning therapy may permit 
more rapid hematopoietic recovery with lessened immediate transplant morbidity. This approach has been advantageous when transplantation has been performed in older patients or patients with significant pretransplant morbidity; engraftment has been satisfactory and is regularly accompanied by complete donor chimerism. 
However these results have been limited to patients with hematopoietic malignancy, 
for whom prior treatment has induced immunosuppression and reduced marrow reserve. These circumstances are not characteristic for patients with CGD. Indeed several reports document the failure to engraft or maintain donor engraftment for CGD patients treated with subablative conditioning regimens.(7;8)   3.8. Busulfan  combined with cyclophosphamide has been used most widely and 
with considerable success to condition CGD patients for SCT.(7) The regi men that is 
proposed in this study, which adds fludarabine to busulfan and cyclophosphamide, has been used effectively to treat patients with a variety of malignant and nonmalignant diseases.(14)(personal communication Lawson, Amrolia) In the past, 
busulfan has presented problems related to unpredictable absorption. With the 
availability of an intravenous formulation of busulfan and the ability to assay plasma busulfan concentration, problems related to under or over dosing have been overcome.   3.9. Additionally, patients will be treated with Campath (Alemtuzumab) an 
antibody directed against the CD52 antigen, which is present on most lymphocytes. This agent has shown efficacy as an immunosuppressive promoting donor engraftment and prevention of GVHD. (15)

7.1. Busulfan: The initial dose of busulfan is 1 mg/kg. Dosing is based upon actual 
weight unless actual weight exceeds ideal weight by 30% for which adjusted weight 
will be calculated as the ideal body weight plus 25%. Busulfan is administered intravenously every 6 hours for 16 doses. Blood sampl es will be obtained with the first 
and ninth dose and busulfan plasma levels will be determined. Using appropriate pharmacokinetic modeling, the busulfan AUC will be estimated. The dose of busulfan will be modified to maintain a busulfan AUC 900 – 1200 µ mol/min/L.  
7.2. All patients require anticonvulsant therapy while receiving busulfan. The clinical 
pharmacist must review orders for anticonvulsants. Blood anticonvulsant levels should dictate dosing.  
7.3. Fludarabine: The dose of fludarabine is 30 mg/m
2.  
7.4. Cyclophosphamide: The planned dose of cyclophosphamide is 50 mg/kg but the 
dose will be based upon the ideal body weight or the actual body weight, whichever is less. For patients whose actual body weight exceeds the ideal body weight by more than 25%, dose adjustmen t will be required. These adjustments will be made in 
conjunction with the clinical pharmacist. Hemorrhagic cystitis may develop at this dose level of cyclophosphamide.  Adequate urine flow is essential and the exact hydration and MESNA doses should be followed.  
7.5. Alemtuzumab: The dose of Alemtuzumab will be based upon recipient actual 
weight. Alemtuzumab 3 mg will be administered to recipients less than 15 kg; Alemtuzumab 5 mg to recipients > 15 kg to 30 kg; Alemtuzumab 10mg to recipients > 30 kg.  Alemtuzumab is administered on four successive days.  Prior to Alemtuzumab patients will receive a premedication as appropriate to prevent allergic reaction. 7.6. Stem Cell: Either bone marrow, cord blood, or peripheral blood stem cells may 
be used for stem cell transplantation. It is desired to infuse: for bone marrow, nucleated cells ≥ 4 X 10
8/kg recipient weight; for cord blood ≥  3 X 107/kg nucleated cells; for 
peripheral blood stem cells ≥ 1 X 107/kg CD34+ cells.  
7.7. Graft versus Host Disease Preventive Therapy: Cyclospo rine will be 
administered beginning day -2.  Initial dose will 5 mg/kg infused over 24 hours.  
Cyclosporine dose is based upon the actual body weight unless the actual body weight exceeds the ideal body weight by 30%; then the ideal body weight will be used. Modifications in cyclosporine dose will be determined by the measured blood concentration (cyclosporine levels will be maintained within the acceptable therapeutic range).  For patients without GVHD, cyclosporine will be discontinued by 6 months. Methotrexate will be administered on day +1, +3, +6, and +11 at 5 mg/m
2 IV.

CBC, AST, ALT, alkalin e phosphatase, GGT, total and direct and indirect bilirubin, 
albumin, electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, uric acid, triglycerides, urinanalysis . 
10.2. CMV antigenemia beginning day +14 and weekly after the ANC has reached 500 
or as indicated until day +120 or cyclosporine and other GVHD therapy is discontinued. Thereafter CMV antigenemia test is performed as clinically indicated. CMV PCR may used in place of CMV antigenemia if ANC < 500 or as indicated. 10.3.  Cyclosporine assay weekly until dose is tapered and then perform assay as 
indicated.  
10.4. Chimerism estimation by FISH for sex chromosome or short tandem repeat (STR) 
for sex match between donor and recipient is to be initiated between day +10 and +21 and repeated as clinically indicated. Either blood or bon e marrow are suitable for 
assay. Chimerism determination should be performed 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks  post transplant and as clinically indicated.  10.5. NBT assay or other assay for neutrophil function will be performed at 
approximately day+28 and then a s clinically indicated.  
10.6. Beyond day +120 studies obtained are as clinically indicated. 
 
 
11. Evaluation of toxicity  
12 
11.1. Definition of a Toxic Event. A toxic event is defined as grade III or grade IV toxicity 
by the NCI Common Toxicit y Criteria Version 3.0 
(http://ctep.info.nih.gov/reporting/ctc.html ). Fever and hematologic toxicity are excluded 
as these are expected side effects of this therapy. Severe hematologic toxicity r esulting 
from cytopenias will be managed in the same way as that which may result from 
conventional conditioning regimen.  
 
12. Risks and potential hazards  
12.1. Nonengraftment. A major risk of this protocol is nonengraftment. Si nce the 
preparative regimen is ablative, we would anticipate the risk for non- engraftment 
would be 5%. This estimate is based upon extensive experience with the busulfan, 
cyclophosphamide, Alemtuzumab regiment used to treat patients with various hematolgic  diseases. To reduce concern for the risks of engraftment failure, we will 
obtain, when possible, ‘back- up’ marrow from the patient for cryopreservation before 
conditioning is initiated.   
12.2. 
Incomplete engraftment. Even if engraftment occurs it may be incomplete, 
producing a state of mixed chimerism. Complete donor chimerism may become established progressively or it may be favored and accelerated by infusion of additional donor T lymphocytes. While mixed chimerism would likely be an acceptable outcome for tr eatment of the CGD, we will monitor chimerism and 
functional neutrophil assays to determine the impact of mixed chimerism on clinical 
course of CGD. Thus all patients will be monitored for engraftment at regular intervals 
post transplant. If chimerism is less than complete and the clinical course unsatisfactory, e.g. persistent or recurrent infections, patients will be afforded the option of Donor lymphocyte Infusion (DLI) infusion as ‘per’ the CAGT SOP, in which increasing doses of lymphocytes are administ ered at predetermined intervals if mixed 
chimerism persists. It is also possible that patients may also be given additional CD34
+ 
selected donor stem cells.  
12.3. GVHD. Acute GVHD leads to a skin rash, liver dysfunction, and enteritis.  
GVHD prophylaxis in most types of patients reduces the incidence of grade II -IV 
GVHD to about 35% with commonly used regimens of today. Chronic GVHD is a multiorgan autoimmune disease usually requiring therapy with steroids and other 
immunosuppressives.  It is seen in about 30% of adults undergoing transplant and a 
lower percentage of children.  Chronic GVHD usually may end after several months or may lead to organ failure (liver failure is common) or infectious death.  GVHD will be prevented in this study by the use of Alemtuzumab, which should persist over the transplant period to produce depletion of infused donor T, cells and by administration of cyclosporine and methotrexate. If GVHD occurs it will be treated by steroid administration. Patients whose GvHD is steroid resistant w ill be offered entry to Phase 
I/II protocols for treatment of steroid resistant GvHD. 12.4. Additional Risks. The degree of immune suppression of marrow transplant 
patients leads to an increased risk of opportunistic infections, especially those due to CMV, HSV,  EBV, Pneumocystis, and other viruses and fungi.  Prophylaxis is given 
where possible (Acyclovir, Bactrim, antifungal and antibacterial mouth rinses, etc.), and treatment for suspected agents is initiated very promptly, usually before the infection is conf irmed.

CGD clinical course may recur. The administration of blood products carries the risk 
of blood born infections such as hepatitis viruses, CMV, and HTLV- III. Blood products 
are screened for these agents but testing is not totally effective in excludi ng 
contaminated blood products.  
 
Other complications of an unexpected nature may be seen.  In fact, most every patient 
presents with some new or very rare complication during his transplant. Patients are 
made aware of this possibility.  Rarely, patients with CGD have experienced acute inflammatory reactions accompanied by severe skin rash at the time of donor engraftment. These reactions have been associated with administration of white cell growth factors (GCSF and GMCSF), and for this reason, these agents will not be used routinely to promote rapid 
engraftment.  
13. Statistical considerations  
 
13.1. Patients with CGD who do not have a HLA genotype identical sibling donor are eligible 
for this  nonrandomized phase II study to exami ne the efficacy of allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation from unrelated 5/6 or 6/6 HLA matched or phenotype 5/6 or 6/6 HLA matched 
donors. The preparatory regimen is busulfan, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and Alemtuzumab 
IH.  We expect to enroll 10 to 15 patients over a period of 3 to 4 years.  Safety monitoring will be 
conducted using Wald's sequential probability ratio test to monitor the rate of engraftment.  The primary endpoint, or neutrophil engraftment  is determined at or before day 28 and defined a s the 
first day of 3 consecutive days for which the absolute neutrophil count exceeds 500/uL.  Donor chimerism will be assessed for each patient at 120 days post transplant (+120).  Complete donor 
is defined as > 90% donor cells.  Acute GVHD is assessed bet ween day 0 and day 100 while 
chronic GVHD is assessed between day 100 and day 365.  We expect 90% of the patients to engraft with an incidence of acute GVHD of 15% -20% grade  I, and 5%-10% grade  II or greater.  
 
13.2. The table, below, lists the total number of en graftment failures (including deaths 
or lost grafts prior to day +120) observed on day +120 necessary to trigger a suspension 
of accrual until a thorough reevaluation of the protocol has been completed.  Additionally, if at any time two deaths prior to day +120 are observed accrual will be suspended and a thorough analysis conducted.  These estimates provide a 10% chance of erroneously concluding that the true rate of engraftment is 90% or greater when in fact it is less than 80%.  They also allow for a 10% chance of mistakenly concluding that 
the true engraftment rate is less than 80% when in fact it is at least 90%.

13.3. GVHD will be monitored so that patient entry will be suspended until the study 
investigators have thoroughly reevaluated the protocol when either:  (a) the sum of the 
overall grad es assigned to each entered patient exceeds 21, or (b) two patients develop 
grade  III or IV GVHD.  Although the literature suggests the incidence of grade  I or II 
GVHD to be 25%, it is not uncommon for all patients in a series to exhibit grade I GVHD.   By  using a sum of 21 as the reevaluation trigger; a sample acceptable 
distribution of GVHD might include 10 grade I, 4 grade II, and 1 grade 3 GVHD patients.  These criteria also monitor against unacceptable levels of extreme GVHD which exceed the expected 3% incidence.  
 
13.4. Kaplan -Meier estimates and associated confidence intervals of disease free 
survival, time to engraftment failure, and survival will be developed for all patients registered on the study. 
 
13.5. The other objective of the protocol, to evaluate the reversal of organ dysfunction 
is strictly observational in nature.  The patient group is expected to exhibit a variety of 
organ dysfunctionality at the time of transplant making it nearly impossible to predict the types of dysfunction much less develop criteria for reversal of the dysfunction.  
Improvement can only be determined in relationship to the pre-transplant findings (e.g. 
lung function as assayed by pulmonary function tests).  Results will be reported descriptively, and no statistical analyses will be undertaken. 
15 
 
13.6. One year  post transplant (day 365) should be considered the off -study date . 
 
14. Data Collection and Adverse Event Reporting:  
 
14.1. Any questions regarding patients on this study should be addressed to Dr. Krance 
(Ph. 832- 824-4693).  
 
14.2. Register all patients with the research coordinator at 832 -824-4881. 
 
14.3. Drug Toxicity and/or adverse reactions 
Adverse events will be collected according to SOP J02.05.XX, J02.06.XX and 
J02.78.XX.     
 
14.4 Relapse and survival data will be collected until 1 year post transplant.  
 
14.5 Data Collection: 
 The following forms will be used to collect data  
  Prestudy  
  Adverse events  
  Response  
  Relapse / progression  
  Off study  
  Death.  
 
 
15. Informed consent  
15.1. All patents and/or their legal guardian must sign a document of informed consent 
consistent with local institutional and Federal guidelines stating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this protocol and of the possible side effects of treatment.  Further, patients must be informed that no efficacy of this therapy is guaranteed, and that unforeseen toxicities may occur.  Patients have the right to withdraw from this protocol at any time.  No patient will be accepted for treatment without such a document signed by him or his legal guardian. F ull confidentiality of patients and patient records will be 
provided according to institutional guidelines. The costs associated with the transplant will be billed to the third party payors. The patients or their families will not receive any payment for participation in this study.

administered intravenously over 2 hours.  CAMPATH -1H must be filtered with a 
sterile, low -protein binding, 5 m filter prior to dilution.  
Supplier :  Investigational.  L&I Partners, LP  
Toxicity : CAMPATH -1H is a potent lymphocyte depleting agent. WHO Grade 3 and 4 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia emerge on treatment in approximately 10- 20% 
of patients.  Infections resulting from CAMPATH -1H induced immunosuppression 
are the major type of adverse event occurring outside the CAMPATH -1H 
administration period.  The most common infections being mucocutaneous herpes 
simplex and candidiasis.   
The majority of other adverse events seen in CAMPATH -1H trials can be 
categorized as being administration- related and of short duration.  There is usually 
a first dose effect consisting of cytokine release type phenomena including hypotension, rigors, fever, shortness of breath, chills, rashes, etc.  These side effects can be significantly ameliorated or avoided by premedicating the patients with methylprednisolone or hydrocortisone.  
Route of Administration :  Intravenous  
 
Methotrexate 
Therapeutic classifi cation:  An antimetabolite and antifolate agent with antineoplastic and 
Immunosuppressant activities.  
Pharmaceutical Data:  Methotrexate injection is a sterile isotonic liquid, preservative free, 
supplied in a single dose vial containing 25 mg/mL of methotrexate in the following packaging strengths:  2 mL (50 mg), 4 mL (100mg), 8 mL (200 mg), and 10 mL(250 mg).  Methotrexate injection, preservative free, is also supplied in a sterile 1 gram single dose vial of lyophilized powder containing 1 gram methotrexate as the base.   
Solution Preparation:  Single dose vial containing 25 mg/mL:  If desired the solution may 
be further diluted immediately prior to use with an appropriate sterile preservative free medium such as 5% dextrose solution or sodium chloride injection.     
Single dose vial of 1 gram lyophilized powder:  Reconstitution should be with an appropriate sterile preservative free medium such as 5% dextrose solution, or sodium chloride injection.  The 1 gram vial should be reconstituted with 19.4 mL to a concentration of 50 mg/mL.  When high doses of methotrexate are administered 
by IV infusion, the total dose is diluted in 5% dextrose solution.  
Stability and Storage:  Store at room temperature 20°- 25°C (68°- 77°F); protect from light.  
Use immediately after diluting or reconstituting drug.   
Route of Administration:  Intravenous (IV).  
Usual dosage range:   Methotrexate may be given by IV on Days 1, 3, 6 and 11. Dosing is 
either  5mg/m2/day for all four doses or 15mg/m2 on day 1 and 10mg/m2 for three remai ning doses. Consider reducing dose by 50% or holding dose for Grade 3 
mucositis or weight gain > 5 kg (>5% baseline for children); consider leucovorin 
rescue. Hold dose for Grade 4 mucositis, doubling of serum creatinine from  
baseline, or weight gain >10 kg (>10% baseline for children) or as clinically indicated.  
Side Effects:   Methotrexate is a medication used to try to prevent GVHD. It causes 
damage to cells, and therefore can affect many different tissues of your body. It may cause or can worsen the mouth sores or inflammation of the mouth.  Methotrexate may slow down the recovery of blood cells after transplantation. Methotrexate can cause kidney damage or worsen kidney function.  If kidney damage does occur, the methotrexate dose may be reduced or the medication may 
not be given at all.  Methotrexate can interfere with the body’s defense system (the 
immune system) causing more infections (especially viral infections and pneumonia) for several months after stem cell transplant.  
Mechanism of action :  Methotrexate binds to and inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate 
reductase, resulting in inhibition of purine nucleotide and thymidylate synthesis and, subsequently, inhibition of DNA and RNA syntheses. Methotrexate also 
22 
exhibits potent immunosuppressant activity although the mechanism(s) of actions 
is unclear.  
 
CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE (Cytoxan)  
Source and Pharmacology: Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent related to nitrogen 
mustard.  
Cyclophosphamide is inactive until it is metabolized by P -450 isoenzymes 
(CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4) in the liver to active compounds. The initial 
product is 4- hydroxycyclophosphamide (4- HC) which is in equilibrium with 
aldophosphamide which spontaneously releases acrolein to produce phosphoramide mustard. Phosphoramide mustard, which is an active bifunctional alkylating species, is 10 times more potent in vitro than is 4- HC and has been 
shown to produce interstrand DNA cross -link analogous to those produced by 
mechlorethamine. Approximately 70% of a dose of cyclophosphamide is  
excreted in the urine as the inactive carboxyphosphamide and 5- 25% as 
unchanged drug. The plasma halflife ranges from 4.1 to 16 hours after IV 
administration.  
 
 
Formulation and Stability: Cyclophosphamide for Injection is available as powder for injection or lyophilized powder for injection in 500 mg, 1 gram and 2 gram vials. The powder for injection contains 82 mg sodium bicarbonate/100 mg cyclophosphamide and the lyophilized powder for injection contains 75 mg 
mannitol/100 mg cyclophosphamide. Storage at or below 25ºC (77ºF) is recommended. The 
product will withstand brief  exposures to temperatures up to 30º C (86ºF).  
Guidelines for Administration:  
Cyclophosphamide for Injection: Reconstitute with sterile water or Bacteriostatic water for injection  (paraben preserved only) to a concentration of 20 mg/ml. Solutions reconstituted with 
preservative should be used within 24 hours if stored at room temperature or within 6 days if 
stored under refrigeration. If  administered as undiluted drug at the 20 mg/ml concentration, 
reconstitute with normal saline (NS) only  to avoid a hypotonic solution.  
Cyclophosphamide may be further diluted in dextrose or saline containing solutions for IV use.  
Supplier: Commercially available from various manufacturers.

CYCLOSPORINE A  (cyclospor ine, CYA, Sandimmune®, Neoral®, Gengraf®) : 
 
Source and Pharmacology : Cyclosporine (CSA) is a lipophilic fungal peptide consisting of 11 
amino acids. CSA is a potent immunosuppressive agent which prolongs survival of allogeneic 
transplants  involving skin, heart, kidney, pancreas, bone marrow, small intestine, and lung. 
Current evidence suggests  that cyclosporine selectively inhibits the transcription of IL- 2; the 
action of which stimulates the proliferation of activated T -lymphocytes. CSA has been shown in 
vitro to be a potent inhibitor of  P-glycoprotein, which has been postulated to be a factor in multi -
drug resistance to various antineoplastic  agents. The terminal half -life of CSA is approximately 19 
hours (range 10- 27 hours). Ninety -nine percent  of CSA is metabolized. Elimination is primarily 
biliary with approximately 6% excreted in the urine. In the circulation, CSA is mainly bound to 
high, low, or very low density lipoproteins and to chylomicrons. Only a small fraction circulates 
unbound. The volume of distribution varies from 3.5 L/kg to 13 L/kg with higher  concentrations of 
drug found in the liver, lymphocytes, kidney, heart, lung, pancreas, fat, neural and muscle cells. 
CSA clearance rates have been shown to be higher in pediatric patients and for patients < 25 
years old.  
 
The absorption of cyclosporine from the gastrointestinal tract is incomplete and variable, exhibiting large intra- and inter -patient variability. Drugs that stimulate or inhibit hepatic p- 450 
enzymes will alter  clearance of CSA and close attention to potential drug interactions is crucial.  
 
 
 
Formulation and Stability : 
IV formulation: 
Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®) is available as a (50 mg/mL) 5mL ampule use containing 650 mg 
polyoxyethylated castor oil (cremophor) and 32.9% alcohol. Store at temperatures below 30°C (86°F) and protected from light.  
 
Oral formulations : 
Cyclosporine (Sandimmune®) 25 mg, and 100 mg capsule, 100 mg/mL oral solution. Inactive 
ingredients  include: Sandimmune® Capsule = Dehydrated alcohol, sorbitol, glycerol, cor n oil, 
gelatin,  polyoxyethylated glycolysed glycerides; Sandimmune® Solution = Olive oil, dehydrated 
alcohol,  polyoxyethylated glycolysed glycerides.  
24 
Cyclosporine USP modified (microemulsion) (Neoral®, Gengraf®) 25 mg, 100 mg capsule, 100 
mg/mL  oral solution. Inactive ingredients include: Neoral® capsule and solution = dehydrated 
alcohol, corn oil,  polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated castor oil, tocopherol, gelatin, and propylene glycol. 
Gengraf® Capsule and solution = dehydrated alcohol, gelatin, polyethylene glycol,  polyoxyl 35 
castor oil, polysorbate 80,  propylene glycol, and sorbitan monooleate.  
Store capsules in the original unit -dose container at controlled room temperature 15°- 30°C (59°-
86°F).  
 Store Oral solutions in the original container at controlled room temperature 68°- 77°F (20°- 25°C). 
Do not  store in the refrigerator. Once opened, the contents must be used within two months. At 
temperatures  below 68°F (20°C) the solution may gel; light flocculation or the formation of a light 
sediment may also occur. There is no impact on product performance or dosing using the syringe 
provided. Allow to warm to room temperature 77°F (25°C) to reverse these changes.  
NOTE: Sandimmune®, Neoral® and Gengraf® ARE NOT BIOEQUIVALENT. Liquid formulations of each trade name are equivalent to capsules of that same trade name. Conversion from one 
trade name product to another is generally done at a 1:1 ratio, but requires close monitoring. Conversions from IV to PO  are usually done at a 1:3 ratio, but should be monitored closely. 
Adjusting emulsion products to the same trough concentration as other oral products results in 
greater total exposure to the drug.  
 Dilute I.V. concentrate 1 mL (50 mg) of cyclosporine injection in 20 mL- 100 mL 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride  Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection (0.5- 2.5 mg/mL). Diluted infusion solutions are stable 
for 24 hours at  room temperature under fluorescent light.  
 The Cremophor®EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil) contained in the concentrate for intravenous infusion can cause phthalate stripping from PVC. It is strongly recommended that glass bottles 
and non- PVC tubing be used to minimize patient exposure to DEHP.  
Monitor closely for an acute allergic reaction for the first 30 minutes and at frequent intervals 
thereafter.  Note: cyclosporine absorbs into plastics and can give falsely high serum or blood 
concentrations if blood samples are collected from the same line through which cyclosporine was 
administered.  
 
Oral:  Administer at a consistent time of day and at consistent intervals with regard to meals. Do 
not use  plastic or styrofoam cups. If diluted with juice or milk, use a glass container and rinse with 
additional  diluent, and then consume to ensure that complete dose has been taken. Do not use 
water or cleaning agents  on the dosing syringe. To improve palatability, mix Sandimmune® with 
milk, chocolate milk or orange juice; mix Neoral® or Gengraf® with orange juice or apple juice but 
NOT milk. After mixed, have patient  consume immediately. DO NOT MIX GRAPEFRUIT JUICE 
with any CSA product.

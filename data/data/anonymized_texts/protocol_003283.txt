Study design
This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study designed to 
investigate the potential effect of a fixed dose of benralizumab (30 mg) administered 
subcutaneously (SC) on antibody responses following seasonal influenza virus vaccination. 
Approximately 100 patients 12-21 years of age with severe asthma will be randomized to receive 
SC benralizumab 30 mg or placebo administered at Weeks 0, 4, and 8. 
After enrolment and confirmation of entry criteria, patients will proceed to a screening period of 
a minimum of 2 weeks to allow adequate time for all of the eligibility criteria to be evaluated
before being randomized at Visit 3. Patients w ho continue to meet elig ibility criter ia will be 
randomized on Week 0 to receive 3 SC doses (at Weeks 0, 4, and 8) of benralizumab 30 mg or placebo. Patients will receive 1 dose of seasonal influenza vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at 
Week 8. Serum samples for evaluation of antibody response will be drawn at Week 8 and 
Week12. An End of Treatment (EOT) will also be conducted at Week 12 and a Follow-up visit will be conducted at Week 20.
Patients will be maintained on their currently prescribed ICS-LABA therapy(ies) without change 
from enrolment throughout the screening and treatment period.
Target patient population
Male and female adolescent patients 12 to 21 years of age, inclusive, with severe asthma will be 
enrolled. Fifty percent or more of the patients will be 12 to 17 years of age.
Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration
Benralizumab 30 mg/mL solution for injection in an accessorized pre-filled syringe (APFS) will 
be administered at the study center SC every 4 weeks for 3 doses (Weeks 0, 4, and 8).
Comparator, dosage and mode of administration
Matching placebo solution for injection in an APFS will be administered at the study center SC 
every 4 weeks for 3 doses (Weeks 0, 4, and 8).
Duration of treatment
Following enrolment, patients will enter a 2 to 3 week screening period followed by a 12-week
double-blind, randomized treatment period, with the last dose of benralizumab/placebo

5(64)administered at Week 8. An End of Treatment (EOT) will be conducted at Week 12 and a
Follow-up visit will be conducted at Week 20.
The total planned study duration is a maximum of 23 weeks.Statistical methods
The benralizumab versus placebo antibody response following seasonal influenza virus 
vaccination will be assessed by
! Post-dose strain-specific HAI antibody geometric mean folder rises (GMFRs) from 
Week 8
! Post-dose strain-specific HAI antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) obtained at 
Week 12 
! Proportion of patients who experience a strain-specific post-dose antibody response at 
Week 12 with antibody response defined as a ≥4-fold rise in HAI antibody titer from 
Week 8
! Proportion of patients who achieve a strain-specific post-dose HAI antibody titer ≥40 at 
Week 12   
! Proportion of patients who achieve a strain-specific post-dose HAI antibody titer ≥320 at 
Week 12
! Post-dose strain-specific microneutralization (MN) antibody GMFRs from Week 8
! Post-dose strain-specific serum MN antibody GMTs obtained at Week 12 
! Proportion of patients who experience a strain-specific post-dose antibody response at 
Week 12 with antibody response defined as a ≥4-fold rise in MN antibody titer from 
Week 8
The analysis of the anti-influenza antibody response endpoints–strain-specific GMFRs and 
GMTs–will be performed on the immunogenicity analysis set, defined as all randomized patients 
who received at least 1 dose of planned investigational product (ie, 1 dose of influenza vaccine 
plus 1 dose of benralizumab or placebo), had pre- and post-dose HAI antibody measurements,had pre- and post-dose MN antibody measurements, and had no protocol deviation judged to 
have the potential to interfere with the generation or interpretation of an humoral response to the 
influenza vaccine.  GMFRs and GMTs will be summarized by treatment group, and the group ratio of GMFRs (influenza vaccine divided by benralizumab and influenza vaccine) and GMTs 
and their corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CIs) will be constructed.
The antibody response to the influenza vaccine is defined as a ≥4-fold rise in HAI from Week 8.  
The proportion of patients who experience a post-dose HAI antibody response at Week 12 and 
corresponding 90% Clopper-Pearson exact CI will be summarized by treatment group. 
The proportion of patients who achieve a post-dose HAI antibody titer ≥40 at Week 12 and 
corresponding 90% Clopper-Pearson exact CI will be summarized by treatment group.

6(64)The proportion of patients who achieve a post-dose HAI antibody titer ≥320 at Week 12 and 
corresponding 90% Clopper-Pearson exact CI will be summarized by treatment group.
The antibody response to the influenza vaccine is also defined as a ≥4-fold rise in MN antibody 
from Week 8.  The proportion of patients who experience a post-dose MN antibody response at 
Week 12 and corresponding 90% Clopper-Pearson exact CI will be summarized by treatment 
group. 
For GMFR and GMT, the geometric least square mean ratio between treatment groups 
(placebo/benralizumab) will be calculated via an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model on 
the log-transformed variable, adjusting for treatment group.  The least square geometric mean ratio will be provided with associated 90% CI.
No interim blinded review is planned.
No formal statistical hypotheses will be tested.  The sample size justification is based on the 
precision of the estimate of the GMTs (as GMT
vaccine / GMT benralizumab+vaccine ).  With 50 patients 
per arm, the 90% CI for the GMT ratio would be 0.67 to 1.48, assuming an observed ratio of 1, 
and that the log (post-dose HAI antibody titer or post-dose MN antibody titer) is normally distributed with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.2 on the natural log scale (Langley et al 2013).
All safety parameters will be analyzed descriptively.  Safety analyses will be based on the safety 
analysis set, defined as all patients who received at least 1 dose of investigational product.

15(64)1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study
Asthma is a syndrome characterized by airway inflammation, reversible airway obstruction, and 
airway hyperresponsiveness. Patients present clinically with recurrent wheezing, shortness of 
breath, cough, and chest tightness. Asthma has become more common in both children and 
adults around the world in recent decades.  It is a leading cause of morbidity with a global prevalence of approximately 300 million; it is estimated that the number of people with asthma 
may increase to 400-450 million people worldwide by 2025 ( GINA 201 , Masoli et al 2004 ).
The current approach to anti-inflammatory controller therapy in asthma is based on a stepwise 
intensification of a daily maintenance regimen centered around inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and 
leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), with the addition of long-acting β
2agonists (LABA) in 
patients with more severe asthma ( GINA 2015 , NAEPP 2007 ). Despite treatment per 
management guidelines, up to 50% of patients have asthma that is not well controlled ( Bateman 
et al 2010 ). This results in considerable impact on quality of life, disproportionate use of 
healthcare resources, and adverse reactions from regular systemic steroid use. Therefore, there remains an unmet medical need for patients whose asthma is not controlled by existing therapies.
The observed variability in clinical response to currently available asthma therapies appears to be 
related, in part, to distinctive inflammatory phenotypes ( Wenzel 2012 ). In particular, asthma 
associated with eosinophilic inflammation in the airway (often referred to as eosinophilic 
asthma) is common (approximately 40% to 60% of asthmatics) with the degree of eosinophilia 
associated with clinical severity including the risk of asthma exacerbations ( Bousquet et al 1990 ,
Louis et al 2000 ,Di Franco et al 2003 ,Scott and Wardlaw 2006 , Simpson et al 2006 ,Zhang and 
Wenzel 2007 ). 
Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a key cytokine essential for eosinophil trafficking and survival ( Molfino et 
al 2011 ). Clinical trials of the anti-IL-5 antibodies mepolizumab and reslizumab in patients with 
uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma have shown benefit in reducing asthma exacerbation, 
improving lung function, and reducing symptoms ( Castro et al 2015 ,Ortega et al 2014 ). These 
promising results support continued development of therapies targeting the IL-5 pathway in 
eosinophilic asthmatics.
Benralizumab (MEDI-563) is a humanized, afucosylated, monoclonal antibody that binds 
specifically to the human IL-5 receptor alpha subunit (IL-5R α) on the target cell. The IL-5 
receptor (IL-5R) is expressed almost exclusively on the surface of eosinophils and basophils (Takatsu et al 1994 ,Toba et al 1999 ). Afucosylation confers enhanced antibody-dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) which results in highly efficient eosinophil depletion by apoptosis (Kolbeck et al 2012 ). Single and repeated doses of benralizumab in mild to severe asthma 
patients has resulted in depletion of blood and airway eosinophils ( Busse et al 2010 , Laviolette et 
al 2013 ).  Also, a recent dose-finding trial in severe asthma proved benralizumab to have benefit
across a range of asthma outcomes including reductions in asthma exacerbations, improvements in lung function, and reduction in symptoms ( Castro et al 2014 ).
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Benr alizumab (M EDI-563)
Study Code D3250C00033Edition Number 1.0
Date 14 December 2015
16(64)Benralizumab is currently being studied in Phase 3 in severe asthmatics with a history of 
exacerbations, still symptomatic despite using medium-to-high dose ICS/LABAs with or without oral corticosteroids or additional controller medications.  
As benralizumab depletes eosinophils, it is important to determine if benralizumab affects 
functioning of the immune system, especially in adolescents and young adults.  In this study, a 
functional response of the immune system will be assessed by measuring antibody responses to the influenza vaccine.
1.2 Rationale for study design, doses and control groups
This study is designed to investigate the potential effect of benralizumab on the antibody
response to the seasonal influenza virus vaccine in patients 12-21 years of age with asthma.  Benralizumab (30 mg) will be given subcutaneously (SC) at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 weeks, at which time benralizumab levels will reach steady state.  Patients will then receive 1 dose of intramuscular (IM) seasonal influenza virus vaccine at Week 8 and samples drawn at Week 8 
and Week 12 to measure the antibody response to the influenza virus
The immune response, as assessed by evaluation of antibody responses to the influenza vaccine 
in the group receiving benralizumab versus placebo will be assessed by
! Post-dose strain-specific HAI antibody geometric mean folder rises (GMFRs) from 
Week 8
! Post-dose strain-specific HAI antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) obtained at 
Week 12 
! Proportion of patients who experience a strain-specific post-dose antibody response at 
Week 12 with antibody response defined as a ≥4-fold rise in HAI antibody titer from 
Week 8
! Proportion of patients who achieve a strain-specific post-dose HAI antibody titer ≥40 at 
Week 12
! Proportion of patients who achieve a strain-specific post-dose HAI antibody titer ≥320 at 
Week 12
! Post-dose strain-specific MN antibody GMFRs from Week 8
! Post-dose strain-specific serum MN antibody GMTs obtained at Week 12 
! Proportion of patients who experience a strain-specific post-dose antibody response at 
Week 12 with antibody response defined as a ≥4-fold rise in MN antibody titer from 
Week 8
The benralizumab dose (30 mg SC, fixed) is base d on all available safety  and efficacy data, as 
well as population exposure-response modeling and stochastic trial simulations from earlier phase benralizumab trials.  Other stable asthma therapies on top of inhaled corticosteroids/long-acting β
2agonists (ICS/LABA) that are within expert guidance and not restricted per protocol are 
allowed in order to accommodate local standards of care.

17(64)1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
Benralizumab is principally being studied in severe asthmatics where there are few treatment 
options for patients whose asthma remains uncontrolled on high dose ICS/LABA and oral 
corticosteroids ( GINA 2015 ).  In adult patients whose asthma was poorly controlled on medium-
to-high dose ICS/LABA therapy, benralizumab at doses of ≥20 mg produced improvements in 
multiple metrics of asthma control including the annual rate of asthma exacerbations, lung 
function, ACQ-6 scores, and symptoms ( Castro et al 2014 ).  
Development of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to benralizumab has been documented. Theoretical 
risks of developing ADA include decreased drug efficacy and hypersensitivity reactions (eg, 
anaphylaxis or immune complex disease).  To date, there have been no identified risks.  Also, 
eosinophils are a prominent feature of the inflammatory response to helminthic parasitic infections and the presence of infiltrating eosinophils has been circumstantially associated with a 
positive prognosis in certain solid tumors. Therefore, there is a theoretical risk that prolonged 
eosinophil depletion may diminish the ability to defend against helminthic parasites, or negatively impact the natural history of certain malignant tumors.  Risk minimization measures 
herein include exclusion of patients with untreated parasitic infection and active or recent 
malignancy, in conjunction with the performance of routine pharmacovigilance activities.
The purpose of this trial is to assess the effect of benralizumab on the humoral immune response
following seasonal influenza virus vaccination in patients 12-21 years of age with asthma.  Mild 
problems following inactivated flu vaccine may include soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given, as well as sore, red or itchy eyes, hoarseness, cough, fever, aches, headache,
itching, and fatigue ( CDC 2014 ).  Very rarely, as with all vaccines, anaphylaxis may occur.  
Benefits would include probable protection against developing influenza in the upcoming flu season.
A more detailed assessment of the overall risk/benefit of benralizumab in patients with asthma is 
given in the Investigator’s Brochure.
1.4 Study design
This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study designed to 
investigate the potential effect of a fixed dose of benralizumab (30 mg) administered SC on the 
humoral immune response following seasonal influenza virus vaccination. 
Approximately 100 patients 12-21 years of age with severe asthma will be randomized to receive 
SC benralizumab 30 mg or placebo administered at Weeks 0, 4, and 8. Fifty percent or more of 
the patients will be 12 to 17 years of age.
Patients will receive 1 dose of seasonal influenza virus vaccine IM at Week 8.  Samples for 
evaluation of antibody response will be drawn at Week 8 and Week 12.
After enrolment and confirmation of entry criteria, patients will proceed to screening period of a 
minimum of 2 weeks to allow adequate time for all of the eligibility criteria to be evaluated.  
Patients who continue to meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized at Week 0 to receive 3

18(64)SC doses (at Weeks 0, 4, and 8) of benralizumab 30 mg or placebo.  Patients will receive 1 dose 
of seasonal influenza virus vaccine IM at Week 8. Samples for evaluation of antibody response
will be drawn at Week 8 and Week 12. The End of Treatment (EOT) will be conducted at Week 12 and a Follow-up (FU) visit will be conducted at Week 20.
Patients will be maintained on their currently prescribed ICS-LABA therapy(ies) without change
from enrollment throughout the screening and treatment period.

26(64)3. Determine patient eligibility
4. Assign eligible patient unique randomization code via IWRS/IVRS
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrolment/randomization code 
cannot be reused.
Patients will be allocated to treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio. Specific information concerning the 
use of the IWRS/IVRS will be provided in the separate manual. Randomized patients who discontinue from IP administration will not be replaced.
3.4 Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomized patients
Patients who fail to meet the eligibility criteria should not – under any circumstance – be 
enrolled or receive study medication. There can be no exceptions to this rule. Patients who are 
enrolled, but subsequently found not to meet all the eligibility criteria must not be randomized and must be withdrawn from the study.
Where a patient does not meet all the eligibility criteria but is randomized in error, or incorrectly 
started on treatment, the Investigator should inform the Study Physician immediately, and a discussion should occur between the Study Physician and the Investigator regarding whether to 
continue or discontinue the patient from treatment. The Study Physician must ensure all 
decisions are appropriately documented.
3.5 Concomitant medications, restrictions during, and after the study
3.5.1 Concomitant medication
Information about any treatment in the 3 months prior to the date of the informed consent/assent, 
and all the concomitant treatments given during the study with reason for the treatment will be 
collected by the Investigator/authorized delegate at each visit (as shown in Table 1 and Table 2 ) 
and recorded in the eCRF.
Note : To satisfy inclusion criterion 6(Section 3.1), the history of treatment with asthma 
therapies at the protocol designated doses prior to Visit 1 should be documented in source and recorded in the eCRF (see Section 4.1.1 ).
3.5.1.1 Background medication 
Background asthma medications should be maintained at stable doses from Visit 1 until the end 
of the study.  If changing the ICS/LABA dose or any other controller medication is judged as necessary by the Investigator or the patient’s healthcare provider (HCP), the justification should 
be documented in the source and the change in the doses should be reflected in the eCRF.
3.5.1.2 Rescue medication 
Short-acting bronchodilators (SABAs) may be used as rescue medication during the study in the 
event of a worsening of asthma symptoms.

Date 14 December 2015
27(64)3.5.2 Restrictions
3.5.2.1 Asthma medication restrictions
(a) Changes to the patient’s background controller regimen are discouraged during 
the study unless judged medically necessary by the Investigator or the patient’s HCP; 
ideally such changes should be discussed with the AstraZeneca Study Physician. All changes in the patient’s background medication should be documented in source along 
with rational for change and recorded in eCRF.
Asthma exacerbations can be treated with oral or other systemic corticosteroids or 
other asthma therapies according to standard practice.
(b) Asthma medication restrictions on the days of scheduled spirometry visits
Pre- and/or post-dose spirometry assessments will be performed at the study center at 
scheduled visits (see Table 1 and Table 2 ).  Restrictions to the patient’s background 
medication are required prior to the spirometry as described below (also see Section 
5.1.2 ).
Screening Visit 2: Patients will be asked to withhold their usual bronchodilator 
medications on the morning of scheduled spirometry measurements.  Twice daily 
therapies containing bronchodilators should be withheld for 12- 24 hours; once daily therapies containing bronchodilators should be withheld for ≥24 hours for eligibility 
assessment.  In addition, SABA should not be used within 6 hours of these spirometry 
assessments.  If the patient has taken rescue SABA within 6 hours of the planned center visit spirometry, they can remain at the center until the 6-hour withholding time 
has been reached or return on another day within the visit window.
The patient’s usual asthma medications may be administered following completion of 
the screening lung function procedures.
3.5.2.2 Other medication restrictions
(a) Use of immunosuppressive medication or administration of live/attenuated vaccines is 
not allowed. Topical administration of immunosuppressive medication may be allowed at the discretion of the Investigator after discussion with the AstraZeneca 
Study Physician. Refer to Section 3.2exclusion criterion 13for examples and further 
details.
(b) Receipt of live attenuated vaccines within 30 days prior to randomization, during the 
treatment period, and for 16 weeks (5 half-lives) after the last dose of the IP is not 
allowed
(c) Patient should not receive allergen immunotherapy injection(s) within 7 days of  IP
administration

28(64)(d) When enrolling a patient who is on theophylline or other drugs with a narrow 
therapeutic range, the Investigator should ensure the levels of each of these 
medications must not exceed the upper limit of therapeutic range.  The Investigator will also be responsible for ensuring that these levels are regularly checked and 
documented as per local practice (see Table 1 )
(e) Patients should not take any other excluded medications.  A table with medication-
related restrictions is presented in Appendix G .
3.5.2.3 Other restrictions
(a) Fertile and sexually active patients or their partners should use highly effective 
contraceptive methods throughout the study and at least for 16 weeks (5 half-lives) after last administration of the IP. Male patients should refrain from fathering child or 
donating sperm from the time of informed consent/assent, and for 16 weeks (5 half-
lives) after last dose of IP (see Section 3.1, inclusion criteria 3and 4; and Section 
7.3.2 )
(b) Patients must abstain from donating blood and plasma from the time of informed 
consent/assent, and for 16 weeks (5 half-lives) after last dose of IP.
3.6 Discontinuation from investigational product 
Patients will be discontinued from IP in the following situations:
1. Patient decision. The patient is free to discontinue treatment at any time, without 
prejudice (see Section 3.7)
2. Adverse event (AE) that in the opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor contraindicates 
further dosing
3. Risk to patient as judged by the Investigator or AstraZeneca
4. Eligibility requirement found not to be fulfilled (see Section 3.4).  Risk to patient as 
judged by the Investigator or AstraZeneca.
5. Severe non-compliance with study protocol
6. Pregnancy7. Lost to follow-up

(b) Development of helminth parasitic infestations requiring hospitalization(c) An asthma-related event requiring mechanical ventilation
All patients who prematurely discontinue investigational product should return to the study 
center and complete the procedures described for the Premature IP Discontinuation (IPD) visit within 4 weeks ±3 days.  
The reasons for premature discontinuation of IP should be recorded in the eCRF.
3.7 Withdrawal from the study
3.7.1 Screen failures 
Screening failures are patients who do not fulfill the eligibility criteria for the study and therefore 
must not be randomized. These patients should have the reason for study withdrawal recorded as ‘Incorrect Enrollment’ (ie, patient does not meet the required inclusion/exclusion criteria). This 
reason for study withdrawal is only valid for screen failures (not randomized patients).
3.7.2 Withdrawal of the Informed Consent
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time (IP and assessments) without prejudice 
to further treatment.
A patient/parent or legal guardian who withdraws consent/assent will always be asked about the 
reason(s) and the presence of any AE.  The Investigator will follow up AEs outside of the clinical study. The enrollment/randomization code of the withdrawn patient cannot be reused.
3.8 Withdrawal of informed consent for donated biological samples 
Samples taken for the evaluation of PK and ADA will be retained for repeat analysis of PK and ADA at AstraZeneca or designee for a maximum of 1 year following completion of the clinical study report (CSR).  If a patient/parent or legal guardian withdraws consent/assent to the use of 
blood samples, the samples will be disposed of/destroyed and the action documented.  If samples
are already analyzed ,AstraZeneca is not obliged to destroy the results of this research.
The Principal Investigator or designee:
! Ensures the local laboratory(ies) holding the samples is/are informed about the withdrawn 
consent/assent immediately and that samples are disposed/destroyed.
! Ensures that the patient and AstraZeneca or designated CRO are informed about the 
sample disposal.

4.1 Enrollment and screening period
4.1.1 Enrollment (Visit 1)
Each potential patient will provide written informed consent/assent as appropriate with local 
guidance prior to any study specific procedures and undergo assessments applicable for the visit 
(see Table 1 ).
Informed Consent Form (ICF)/assent must also be obtained prior to any Visit 1 procedures and 
prior to instructing the patient to withhold any medication.  Registration of patient’s enrolment 
via IWRS/IVRS should occur on day when other Visit 1 procedures are done.
Visit 1 assessments are primarily concerned with confirmation of the asthma disease state and
the requisite level of severity based on background medications.  A record of physician-
diagnosed asthma is required in source documentation. A patient’s verbal history suggestive of 
asthma symptoms, but without supporting documentation, is not sufficient to satisfy these inclusion criteria.
Pulmonary function tests and assessment of reversibility (maximum post-bronchodilator [post-
BD] value of lung function) may be done if short- and long-acting bronchodilators have not been used for the patient as per Section 5.1.2.1.
Current, regular use of ICS prior to enrolment must be documented in the source. This 
documentation may be in the form of a recent, active medication list as per a health care provider (HCP) note, or filled prescriptions based on a pharmacy record.
4.1.2 Screening (Visit 2)
The screening period should be a minimum of 2 weeks in duration. Assessments applicable for 
the period are listed in Table 1 .
Pulmonary function tests and assessment of reversibility (maximum post-BD value of lung 
function may be repeated at this visit, if pre-BD FEV
1> 50% predicted and reversibility was not 
performed or achieved at Visit 1 and are needed to qualify the patient for randomization see 
Section 5.1.2.1 ).
4.1.3 Re-screening
Re-screening is allowed only once for the patient.
Re-screened patient/parent or legal guardian should re-sign informed consent/assent on the re-
screening Visit 1. All procedures from the screening period should be repeated

34(64)4.1.3.1 Procedures for patients who experience an exacerbation during screening/run-in
Patients who experience an asthma exacerbation during screening should be treated according to 
local medical practice and will be considered a screen failure. 
4.2 Randomized treatment period
Inclusion criteria at randomization will be confirmed at Week 0. Patients confirmed to be 
eligible will be randomised to either placebo or benralizumab 30 mg administered every 4 weeks throughout the treatment period.
Patients will have scheduled visits at 4-week intervals to complete protocol-specific assessments 
and IP administration as listed in Table 2 .  Restrictions as set out in Section 3.5.2 will continue to 
apply throughout the treatment period.  In case of asthma worsening/exacerbation (see Section 
5.3.2 ), patients should be evaluated at the study center, when feasible.
Patients will receive 1 dose of seasonal influenza virus vaccine IM at Week 8.  Samples for 
evaluation of antibody response will be drawn at Week 8 (prior to administration of the vaccine)
and Week 12.
The End of Treatment (EOT) visit will be at Week 12, following the ARE assessments.All patients who prematurely discontinue IP should return to the study center and complete the
procedures described for the Premature IP Discontinuation (IPD) visit within 4 weeks±3 days.
Completion or early termination of the treatment will be registered via IWRS/IVRS for each 
patient.
4.3 Follow-up period
Patients who complete the double-blind randomized treatment period will be followed for 12weeks after the last dose of IP for the Week 20 follow-up visit.
5. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND TIMING OF PROCEDURES
5.1 Efficacy assessments
5.1.1 Humoral response to influenza vaccine
Serum HAI and MN antibody testing for antibody responses will be performed at Week 8 and 
Week 12.  Methods for these analyses will be described in the laboratory manual.
5.1.2 Spirometry
General requirementsLung function (reversibility, FEV
1 and FVC) at the study center will be measured by spirometry 
using the sites own equipment.  Spirometry should be performed by the Investigator or

35(64)authorized delegate according to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society 
(ATS/ERS) guidelines ( Miller et al 2005 ).  
Important!   Patients should withhold their SABA medication(s) for at least 6 hours prior to 
Visit 2 (see Section 3.5.2.1 ).  If Visits 1 and 2 are combined, bronchodilator therapy(ies) with or 
without ICS should be withheld for 12-24 hours depending on whether the patient is using twice-
or once-daily bronchodilator-containing therapy.  
Options for handling patients who have inadvertently taken their asthma medication within the 
restricted window are described in Section 3.5.2 .
Spirometry technique
Patients should avoid engaging in strenuous exertion for at least 30 minutes prior to spirometry 
measurements. Patients should avoid eating a large meal for at least 2 hours prior to spirometry 
measurements at the center. Forced expiratory maneuvers should be performed with the patient seated in an upright position. If this is not comfortable for the patient, standing is permitted. 
The same position should be used by the patient for each forced expiratory maneuver from 
enrollment throughout the study. The head must not be tilted during maneuvers and the thorax should be able to move freely; hence, tight clothing should be loosened. A nose-clip should be 
used for the maneuver. Mouthpieces of the same dimension and shape should be used by the 
patient from enrollment throughout the study.
The forced expiratory maneuver (FEV
1and FVC) should start with a maximal inspiration and 
then followed by a fast and forceful expiration that should last for at least 6 seconds. It is 
important to encourage the patient to continue the expiration to be fast and forceful throughout the maneuver. Ensure that none of the following has occurred: coughing during the first second, 
glottis closure, leak or obstruction of the mouthpiece (by the tongue).
Multiple forced expiratory efforts (at least 3 but no more than 8) will be performed for each 
center spirometry session and the 2 best efforts that meet the ATS/ERS acceptability and 
reproducibility criteria will be recorded. The best efforts will be based on the highest FEV
1. .  
The absolute measurement (for FEV 1and FVC), and the percentage of predicted normal value 
will be recorded using the local spirometer at the site with predicted values derived from the 
reference value of choice, eg, NHANES III 2010 , Quanjer et al 2012 , etc. The highest FVC will 
also be reported regardless of the effort in which it occurred (even if the effort did not result in the highest FEV
1).
Post-bronchodilator spirometry
Post-bronchodilator spirometry will be performed to satisfy reversibility inclusion criterion 8.
The post-BD spirometry procedure should commence within 30±15 minutes according to the regimen for reversibility testing outlined in Section 5.1.2.1 .

36(64)Order of administration of usual asthma controller medication and investigational product
relative to scheduled pre- and post-bronchodilator spirograms
The patient’s usual morning asthma controller therapy must not be given until after the initial 
pre-medication, pre-BD spirogram is complete for the reasons discussed above; usual asthma controller may be given after the post-BD spirogram. 
5.1.2.1 Reversibility test and post-BD FEV
1assessment
The procedure described in this section refers to the reversibility testing at Visit 1 or Visit 2.  
Bronchodilatation can be induced using albuterol (90 μg metered dose), salbutamol (100 μg 
metered dose) or levalbuterol (45 μg metered dose) up to a maximum of 8 inhalations).  It is 
highly recommended to use a spacer device for this procedure.  The algorithm for reversibility 
testing is outlined in Figure 2 . 
Figure 2 Reversibility testing algorithm
1 Verify with the patient that the medication 
restrictions to allow the reversibility assessment have been 
met (Section 3.5.2 )
2 After a gentle and complete expiration, albuterol, 
salbutamol or levalbuterol is inhaled in one breath to TLC from a spacer device.  The breath is then held for 5–10 seconds before the patient exhales. Four separate 
inhalations are delivered at approximately 30- second 
intervals.  Post-BD spirometry should be performed 15-20 minutes later.
3 If the patient has not met reversibility criteria, an 
additional 2 inhalations of albuterol, salbutamol, or 
levalbuterol can be administered as single inhalations, 30 
seconds apart (for a total of 6 inhalations).  Second post-BD spirometry should be performed 15-20 minutes later.
4 If the patient still has not met reversibility criteria, 
an additional 2 inhalations of albuterol, salbutamol, or levalbuterol can be administered as single inhalations, 30 
seconds apart (for a total of 8 inhalations).  Second post-BD 
spirometry should be performed 15-20 minutes later.
A lower total dose, eg, 2 inhalations instead of 4 in the first round of puffscan be used if there is 
a concern about any effect on the patient’s heart rate, tremor, or safety.  The bronchodilator algorithm can be stopped at any time once a patient has met reversibility criteria.
The highest pre- and post-BD FEV
1should be used to determine reversibility.

38(64)A standard ECG with a recommended paper speed of 25 or 50 mm/second covering at least 6 
sequential beats will be used. The Investigator or authorized delegate will be responsible for the 
overall interpretation and determination of clinical significance of any potential ECG findings. In case of discrepancy between the Investigators interpretation and that provided by the ECG 
machine (if applicable), the Investigator’s interpretation takes precedence and should be noted on 
the printout and recorded in the eCRF.  Two identical copies of the ECG will be produced, quality checked, and kept in case of further need for re-evaluation.  The ECG printouts will be 
signed and dated by the Investigator and stored at the study center.  
It is highly recommended that the same machine is used for assessment throughout the patient’s 
participation in the study.
ECG data and evaluation will be recorded in the eCRF.
5.2.4 Safety laboratory tests
Safety laboratory tests (list provided in Table 3 ) will be performed in a central laboratory.  For 
information on methods of collection, assessment, labeling, storage, and shipment of samples 
please refer to the separate Laboratory Manual. Safety samples will be collected in accordance 
with the schedules provided in Table 1 and Table 2 .

(before IP administration on V3-5) using a dipstick. A positive urine test result must be 
confirmed with serum beta HCG.
5.3 Other assessments and procedures
5.3.1 Weight and height
Weight and height will be measured, and BMI calculated in accordance with schedules provided 
inTable 1 and Table 2 . 
The patient’s weight will be recorded in kilograms; height will be recorded in centimeters.
5.3.2 Assessment of asthma exacerbations
In this study, an asthma exacerbation is defined by a worsening of asthma requiring the use of systemic 
corticosteroids (or an increase in oral steroid dose for those already on systemic corticosteroids) and/or an 
in-patient hospitalization, and/or an emergency department visit.
An asthma exacerbation that occurs ≤7 days following the last dose of systemic steroids (oral, 
IM, IV), prescribed for a prior exacerbation, will be recorded as the same exacerbation event.
Asthma exacerbation information will be collected with a recall period of ‘since the last 
scheduled visit’.
5.3.3 Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6)
The ACQ-6 is a shortened version of the ACQ that assesses asthma symptoms (nighttime 
waking, symptoms on waking, activity limitation, shortness of breath, wheezing, and short-acting 
β2 agonist use) omitting the FEV 1measurement from the original ACQ score.
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Benr alizumab (M EDI-563)
Study Code D3250C00033Edition Number 1.0
Date 14 December 2015
40(64)Patients are asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week by responding to 
1 bronchodilator use question and 5 symptom questions.
Questions are weighted equally and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely 
uncontrolled). The mean ACQ-6 score is the mean of the responses. Mean scores of ≤0.75 
indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.75 and ≤1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, 
and a score >1.5 indicates not well controlled asthma ( Juniper et al 2006 ). 
The questionnaire will be completed at the study center in accordance with schedule provided in
Table 2 .
The Investigator’s clinical acumen and ACQ-6 results should be used in concert to determine 
whether or not the patient is well enough to continue in the current clinical study.
5.3.4 Other screening/run-in assessments
5.3.4.1 SerologyHepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody : To be done only at enrolment (Visit 1); test

The presence or absence of ADA will be determined in the serum samples using validated 
bioanalytical methods. 
5.3.8 Handling of biological samples
5.3.8.1 Labeling and shipment of biological samplesThe Principal Investigator is to ensure that samples are labeled and shipped in accordance with 
the Laboratory Manual and the Biological Substance, Category B Regulations (materials 
containing or suspected to contain infectious substances that do not meet Category A criteria), 
see Appendix C ‘IATA 6.2 Guidance Document’.
Any samples identified as Infectious Category A materials are not to be shipped and no further 
samples will be taken from the patient unless agreed with AstraZeneca and appropriate labeling, 
shipment and containment provisions are approved.
5.3.8.2 Chain of custody of biological samples 
A full chain of custody will be maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle.
The Principal Investigator at each study center is to keep full traceability of collected biological 
samples from the patients while in storage at the study center until shipment or disposal (where appropriate) and is to keep documentation of receipt of arrival.
The sample receiver is to keep full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use 
until used or disposed of or until further shipment and is to keep documentation of receipt of arrival.
AstraZeneca will maintain oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, 
monitoring of study centers and auditing of external laboratory providers.
Samples retained for further use will be registered in the AstraZeneca biobank system during the 
entire life cycle.

6.2 Labeling
Labeling of the IP will be carried out by AstraZeneca or designee in accordance with current 
Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and regulatory requirements of each country participating in the study. The labels will be translated into local languages where applicable.
6.3 Storage
Benralizumab/placebo is to be stored at the study center in a secured facility with limited access and controlled temperature. The temperature should be monitored on a daily basis and documented in the temperature monitoring log.
The IP must be kept in the original outer container and under conditions specified on the label 
(between 2-8°C (36-46°F), protected from the light).
In the following cases:
! Temperature excursion upon receipt or during storage at the study
! Damaged kit upon receipt
! Damaged syringe/cartridge
The center staff should not use affected IP and should immediately contact an AstraZeneca 
representative for further guidance. Damaged IP should be documented via IWRS/IVRS (refer 
to IWRS/IVRS manual for further details).

accordance with the package insert.
6.4 Accountability
The study drug provided for this study will be used only as directed in the study protocol.
The study personnel will account for all study drugs dispensed to the patient.The monitor will account for all study drugs received at the center, unused study drugs and for 
appropriate destruction. Certificates of delivery, destruction, and/or return should be signed.
In the case of a malfunctioning accessorized prefilled syringe (APFS), the center should contact 
the study monitor to initiate a product complaint process according to applicable guidelines. 
6.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups
Randomization codes will be assigned strictly sequentially in each stratum (adolescents [12-17 years of age] and young adults [18-21 years of age]) as patients become eligible for randomization.
Patients who fail to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria should not, under any circumstances, 
be enrolled or receive study medication. There can be no exceptions to this rule.
6.6 Methods for ensuring blinding
The study will be conducted in double-blind fashion. AstraZeneca staff involved in the study, the patients, and the Investigators involved in the treatment of the patients or in their clinical 
evaluation will not be aware of the treatment allocation.
Placebo solution will be visually matched with benralizumab solution. Both benralizumab and 
placebo will be provided in an accessorized pre-filled syringe (APFS).

44(64)Maintaining the blind to the patient’s blood eosinophil counts
While not entirely specific, patients on active benralizumab treatment are expected to have lower 
blood eosinophil counts than patients on placebo. Procedures to mitigate unblinding on this basis include:
!From Week 0 on, monocyte counts will be redacted from central laboratory reports to 
prevent the Principal Investigator/designee from possibly deducing the ‘eosinophil + 
basophil’ contribution to the complete blood count.
!If the Investigator orders any local safety laboratory assessments, the requested tests 
should be restricted to the question at hand. For example, if a hemoglobin is desired, the 
Investigator should avoid ordering a complete blood cell count with differential.
!Handling of labs obtained during the treatment period but ordered outside of the 
clinical trial . Center staff who are directly involved in the patient’s management should 
remain blinded to any eosinophil, basophil, and monocyte results included as part of 
outside lab reports. To help ensure this, each investigational center will designate an individual (eg, administrator or another ancillary person) not directly involved in patient 
management, to receive and blind any eosinophil, basophil, and monocyte results prior to 
the report being handed over to the center staff involved in the patient’s management and prior to filing as a source document. Similarly, eosinophil and basophil results must be 
redacted from all communications with the Sponsor.
!In cases where the Investigator requires an eosinophil, basophil, or monocyte count for 
managing safety issues he/she may order these tests. AstraZeneca should be notified of 
all such cases.
6.7 Methods for unblinding 
Individual treatment codes, indicating the treatment randomization for each randomized patient, 
will be available to the Investigator(s) or pharmacists at the study center from the IWRS/IVRS. Further detail on how to unblind a patient’s treatment allocation will be described in the IWRS/IVRS user manual provided to each study center.
The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the patient requires knowledge of the treatment randomization.  The Investigator 
is to document and report the action to AstraZeneca, without revealing the treatment given to patient to the AstraZeneca staff.
AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for serious adverse events (SAEs) that are 
unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to an IP and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. Treatment codes will not be broken for the planned 
analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual patient 
have been made and documented.

care
! For WOCBP, urine pregnancy test will be done; IP will be administered only when the 
result of the test is negative (see Section 5.2.4.1 )
IP and influenza vaccine administration
The IP and influenza vaccine will be administered by the Investigator/authorized delegate. It is 
advised that the site of injection of the IP be rotated such that the patient receives IP at a different anatomical site at each treatment visit. Suggested injection site rotation sequence is presented 
below (see Figure 3 ). At Week 8, the influenza vaccine should be injected at a site different than 
that of the IP injection site and should be administered prior to IP.  The injection site(s) must be recorded in the source documents and the eCRF at each treatment visit.
Figure 3 Injection sites and rotation scheme
Further details on IP administration are provided in the IP Handling Instruction. IP 
administration must be carried out in line with the Instruction.
After influenza vaccine administration
After influenza virus administration, the patient should be observed for a minimum of 15 
minutes for the appearance of any acute drug reaction and prior to administration of IP.

Date 14 December 2015
46(64)After IP administration
After IP administration the patient should be observed for a minimum of 2 hours for the 
appearance of any acute drug reactions.
Conditions requiring IP administration rescheduling 
If any of the following occur, the Investigator should reschedule the visit and the IP should not 
be administered until the rescheduled visit:
! The patient has an intercurrent illness, that in the opinion of the Investigator may 
compromise the safety of the patient in the study (eg, viral illnesses)
! The patient is febrile ( ≥38°C; ≥100.4°F) within 72 hours prior to the IP administration
6.9 Management of investigational product-related reactions
Appropriate drugs (eg, epinephrine, H1 and H2 antihistamines, and corticosteroids), and medical 
equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available. Study personnel 
must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis ( Kroger et al 2011 , Lieberman et al 2010 ). 
Management of anaphylaxis must be in accordance with current standard of care and clinical guidelines.  Details on anaphylaxis management are provided in Appendix F.
Anaphylaxis will be defined as a serious reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death 
(Simpson et al 2006 ). Anaphylaxis typically manifests as 1 of 3 clinical scenarios:
1. The acute onset of a reaction (minutes to hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both, and at least 1 of the following: a) respiratory compromise or b) reduced 
blood pressure or symptoms of end-organ dysfunction
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure: involvement of the 
skin/mucosal tissue, respiratory compromise, reduced blood pressure or associated 
symptoms and/or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms
3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure
Patients will have had a pre-assessment (ie, vital signs and lung function) prior to IP 
administration) and should be observed after IP administration for a minimum of 2 hours for the appearance of any acute drug reactions. Patients should also be observed in the clinic for 15
minutes after vaccine administration.  
In order to help understand the potential drug-relatedness of any acute reaction, a blood sample 
should be drawn as close as possible to the event for possible additional ADA testing (if not 
already scheduled for this visit).  Serum tryptase or other blood or urine testing relevant to the 
diagnosis of anaphylaxis may be obtained at a local lab at the discretion of the Investigator.

47(64)7. SAFETY REPORTING
7.1 Adverse events
The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are 
familiar with the content of this section.
7.1.1 Definition of adverse events
An adverse event (AE) is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the 
deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to the product. An 
undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg, tachycardia, 
enlarged liver) or the abnormal results of an investigation (eg, laboratory findings, ECG). In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, 
including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs.7.1.2 Definitions of serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, screening/run-in, 
treatment, washout, follow-up), that fulfills 1 or more of the following criteria:
! Results in death
! Is immediately life-threatening
! Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
! Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions
! Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect
! Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical 
intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above
For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see  Appendix B.
7.1.3 Recording of adverse events
7.1.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse eventsAll AEs, including SAEs, will be collected from the time the patient, parent, or legal guardian 
signs the informed consent/assent throughout the treatment period and including the follow-up 
period (through Week 20).
7.1.3.2 Follow-up of unresolved adverse events
Any AEs that are unresolved at follow-up in the study will be followed up by the Investigator for 
as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the CRF. AstraZeneca retains the 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Benr alizumab (M EDI-563)
Study Code D3250C00033Edition Number 1.0
Date 14 December 2015
48(64)right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of 
the study, if judged necessary.
The requirement to follow-up AEs is not intended to delay database lock or production of the 
Clinical Study Report (CSR). These activities should proceed as planned with ongoing AEs if 
necessary.
Any follow-up information of ongoing SAEs after database lock will be reported to AstraZeneca.7.1.3.3 Variables 
The following variables will be collect for each AE
! AE (verbatim)
! The date when the AE started and stopped
! Maximum intensity of the AE
! Whether the AE is serious or not
! Investigator causality rating against the IP (yes or no)
! Action taken with regard to IP
! AE caused patient’s withdrawal from study (yes or no)
! Outcome.
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 7.1.2 . An AE of severe intensity need 
not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a 
limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE.
7.1.3.4 Causality collection
The Investigator will assess causal relationship between IP and each AE, and answer ‘yes’ or 
‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may 
have been caused by the investigational product?’
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures. 
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is 
implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix B.
7.1.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient or reported in response to the open question from 
the study personnel: ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last 
asked?’ , or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the CRF. When collecting 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Benr alizumab (M EDI-563)
Study Code D3250C00033Edition Number 1.0
Date 14 December 2015
49(64)AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred, when possible, to recording a list of signs and 
symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not 
generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.
7.1.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from protocol mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized in the 
CSR. Deterioration as compared with baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values and vital signs should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfill any of the SAE criteria or are the 
reason for discontinuation of treatment with the IP.
If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will 
be considered as additional information. Wherever possible, the reporting Investigator will use 
the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated 
parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as 
compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.
7.1.3.7 Symptoms of the disease under study
When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred, when possible, to recording a list 
of signs and symptoms. Asthma symptoms or signs, such as wheeze, cough, chest tightness, dyspnea, breathlessness and phlegm, will be recorded as AEs only when:
! The sign or symptom is serious according to definitions, see Section 7.1.2
! The patient discontinues the study due to the sign or symptom 
! The sign or symptom is new to the patient or not consistent with the patient’s pre-existing 
asthma history (defined as within 1 year of Visit 1) as judged by the Investigator.
7.1.4 Hy’s Law
Cases where a subject shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and 
occurrences of AST or ALT ≥3xULN together with total bilirubin ≥2xULN may need to be 
reported as SAEs. Refer to  Appendix D  for further instruction on cases of increases in liver 
biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s Law.
7.1.5 Reporting of serious adverse events
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IP, or to the 
study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators or other center personnel will 
inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately but no later than 
24 hours from when he or she becomes aware of it.
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Benr alizumab (M EDI-563)
Study Code D3250C00033Edition Number 1.0
Date 14 December 2015
50(64)The designated AstraZeneca representative will work with the Investigator to ensure that all the 
necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1
calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events and within 5 calendar days 
of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal or life-threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow-up will be undertaken immediately. Investigators or other center personnel will inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within 1 
calendar day, ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours from when he or she becomes aware of 
it.
Once the Investigators or other center personnel indicate an AE is serious in the Web-based Data 
Capture (WBDC) system, an automated email alert will be sent to the designated AstraZeneca 
representative.
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study center personnel is to 
report a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone.
The AstraZeneca representative will advise the Investigator/study center personnel how to 
proceed.
The reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness is the IB for the AstraZeneca 
drug.
7.2 Overdose
! An overdose with associated AEs will be recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE modules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF module
! An overdose without associated symptoms will be reported on the Overdose CRF module 
only
If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study drug occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators 
or other center personnel will inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours from when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative will work with the Investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site.
For overdoses associated with a SAE, standard reporting timelines apply, see Section 7.1.5 . For 
other overdoses, reporting should be done within 30 days.
7.3 Pregnancy
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca.

Study Code D3250C00033Edition Number 1.0
Date 14 December 2015
51(64)7.3.1 Maternal exposure
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study IP should be discontinued 
immediately.
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the IP under study may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Congenital 
abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as 
SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs. The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, 
or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented even if the patient was 
discontinued from the study.
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators or other center personnel 
inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately but no later than 
24 hours from when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative will work with the Investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 or 5 
days for SAEs (see Section 7.1.5 ) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.
7.3.2 Paternal exposure 
Male patients should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 16 
weeks (5 half-lives) following the last dose.
Pregnancy of the patient’s partners will not be considered an AE. However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented for conceptions occurring from the date of the first administration of IP until 16 weeks (5 half-lives) after the last administration of IP.
8. EVALUATION AND CALCULATION OF VARIABLES
8.1 Statistical considerations
! All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until database 
lock
! Analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representatives
! The SAP will be prepared prior to first patient randomized and any subsequent 
amendments will be documented, with final amendments completed prior to unblinding 
of the data

Study Code D3250C00033Edition Number 1.0
Date 14 December 2015
52(64)8.2 Sample size estimate
The study will have an estimated sample size of 50 patients in each treatment group.  No formal 
statistical hypotheses will be tested.  The sample size justification is based on the precision of the 
estimate of the GMTs (as GMT vaccine / GMT benralizumab+vaccine ).  With 50 patients per arm, the 90% 
CI for the GMT ratio would be 0.67 to 1.48, assuming an observed ratio of 1, and that the log (post-dose HAI antibody titer or post-dose MN antibody titer) is normally distributed with a 
standard deviation (SD) of 1.2 on the natural log scale (Langley et al 2013).  No formal statistical 
hypotheses will be tested.  
8.3 Definitions of analysis sets
Antibody endpoints to the influenza vaccine—strain-specific HAI and MN antibody GMFRs and 
GMTs—will be analyzed using the vaccine immunogenicity analysis set.  All remaining efficacy 
analyses will be performed using an Intent-to-Treat (ITT) approach based on the full analysis set. For consistency, demographic and baseline characteristics will be presented using the full 
analysis set. Safety objectives and ADA will be analyzed based on the Safety analysis set.
8.3.1 All patients analysis set
This analysis set will comprise all patients screened for the study and will be used for reporting 
of disposition and screening failures.
8.3.2 Full analysis set
All patients randomized and receiving any IP will be included in the full analysis set, irrespective 
of their protocol adherence and continued participation in the study. Patients will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment, irrespective of whether or not they have prematurely 
discontinued, according to the ITT principle. Patients who withdraw consent to participate in the 
study will be included up to the date of their study termination.
8.3.3 Vaccine immunogenicity analysis set 
The vaccine immunogenicity analysis set will include all randomized subjects who received at 
least 1 dose of planned IP (ie, 1 dose of influenza vaccine, and plus 1 dose of benralizumab or 
placebo), had pre- and post-dose HAI and MN antibody measurements, and had no protocol deviation judged to have the potential to interfere with the generation or interpretation of an 
antibody response.  The analyses conducted using this analysis set will be based on the actual 
treatment received.  Protocol deviations will be reviewed by the study team before unblinding.
8.3.4 Safety analysis set
All patients who received at least 1 dose of IP will be included in the safety analysis set. Patients 
will be classified according to the treatment they actually received. A patient who has on one or several occasions received active treatment will be classified as active. All safety and ADA summaries will be based on this analysis set.

were made will be calculated for relevant measurements. Adverse events will be summarized by 
means of descriptive statistics and qualitative summaries.
8.4.3 Calculation or derivation of patient reported outcome variables
8.4.3.1 Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6)The outcome variable for ACQ-6 will be the change in mean score from baseline (Week 0) to 
EOT (Week 12).
Asthma control responder status will be categorized according to the following limits ( Juniper et 
al 2005 ):
! ACQ-6 (EOT) ≤0.75 → Well controlled
! 0.75< ACQ-6 (EOT) <1.5 → Partly controlled
! ACQ-6 (EOT) ≥1.5 → Not well controlled
8.4.4 Calculation or derivation of pharmacokinetic variables
Due to the limited sampling schedule, the PK assessment will be primarily based on the observed 
steady-state serum trough (pre-dose) concentrations, C
trough. Empirical evaluation of potential 
impact of demographic covariates and ADA on C trough will be conducted. The PK data and 
parameters from this study will be reported in the CSR.
8.4.5 Calculation or derivation of benralizumab immunogenicity variables
ADA assessments will be conducted utilizing a tiered approach (screen, confirm, titer). 
8.5 Methods for statistical analyses
The analysis of the efficacy endpoints will include all data captured during the 16-week 
treatment period, including follow-up (where applicable), unless the patient or their parent/legal guardian withdraws consent/assent to study participation, regardless of whether study treatment 
was prematurely discontinued, or delayed, and/or irrespective of protocol adherence. 
Demography and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group for the full 
analysis set. 
8.5.1 Analysis methods for antibody endpoints
Geometric mean fold rises for the HAI and MN antibody measurements are defined as: 
GMFR=antilog

The analysis of the antibody endpoints—strain-specific GMFRs and GMTs—will be performed 
on the vaccine immunogenicity analysis set.  GMFRs and GMTs will be summarized by 
treatment group.  For GMFR and GMT, the geometric least square mean ratio between treatment 
groups (placebo/benralizumab) will be calculated via an ANCOVA model on the log-transformed variable, adjusting for treatment group.  The least square geometric mean ratio will 
be provided with associated 90% CI. 
Antibody response is defined as a ≥4-fold rise in HAI or MN antibody from Week 8.  The 
proportion of patients who experience a post-dose antibody response at Week 12 and 
corresponding 90% Clopper-Pearson exact CI will be summarized by treatment group. 
The proportion of subjects who achieve a post-dose HAI antibody titer ≥40 at Week 12 and 
corresponding 90% Clopper-Pearson exact CI will be summarised by treatment group. 
The proportion of patients who achieve a post-dose HAI antibody titer ≥320 at Week 12 and 
corresponding 90% Clopper-Pearson exact CI will be summarized by treatment group.
No interim blinded review is planned.
8.5.2 Analysis methods for non-immunogenicity endpoints
Change from baseline in ACQ-6 score will be summarized by timepoint. ACQ-6 asthma control 
responder status will be summarized at Week 12 (EOT) by treatment group according to the following limits:

59(64)10.3 Ethics and regulatory review
An Ethics Committee (EC) should approve the final study protocol, including the final version of 
the ICF/assent and any other written information and/or materials to be provided to the patients. 
The Investigator will ensure the distribution of these documents to the applicable EC and to the
study center staff.
The opinion of the EC should be given in writing. The Investigator should submit the written 
approval to AstraZeneca or designated CRO before enrollment of any patient into the study. 
The EC should approve all advertising used to recruit patients for the study.AstraZeneca should approve any modifications to the ICF/assent that are needed to meet local 
requirements.
If required by local regulations, the protocol should be re-approved by the EC annually.Before enrollment of any patient into the study, the final study protocol, including the final 
version of the ICF/assent is approved by the national regulatory authority or a notification to the 
national regulatory authority is done, according to local regulations.
AstraZeneca or designated CRO will handle the distribution of any of these documents to the 
national regulatory authorities.
AstraZeneca or designated CRO will provide Regulatory Authorities, ECs and Principal 
Investigators with safety updates/reports according to local requirements, including SUSARs 
(Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions), where relevant.
Each Principal Investigator is responsible for providing the ECs/Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) with reports of any serious and unexpected adverse drug reactions from any other study 
conducted with the investigational product. AstraZeneca or designated CRO will provide this 
information to the Principal Investigator so that he/she can meet these reporting requirements.
10.4 Informed consent
The Principal Investigator(s) at each study center will:
! Ensure each patient or legal guardian is given full and adequate oral and written 
information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study (before any study procedures are performed) as per local requirements. The ICF/assent needs to be adjusted as per local requirements.
! Ensure each patient, parent, or legal guardian is notified that they are free to discontinue 
from the study at any time.
! Ensure that each patient, parent, or legal guardian is given the opportunity to ask 
questions and allowed time to consider the information provided.
Clinical Study Protocol

Consent before conducting any procedure specifically for the study.
! Ensure the original, signed Informed Consent(s) is/are stored in the Investigator’s Study 
File and kept for a period that is complaint with GCP/local regulatory requirements, 
whichever is longer.
! Ensure a copy of the signed Informed Consent/Assent Form is given to the patient.
! Ensure that any incentives for patients who participate in the study as well as any 
provisions for patients harmed as a consequence of study participation are described in 
the Informed Consent Form that is approved by an Ethics Committee.
10.5 Changes to the protocol and informed consent form
Study procedures will not be changed without the mutual agreement of the International 
coordinating Investigator and AstraZeneca or designated CRO.
If there are any substantial changes to the study protocol, then these changes will be documented 
in a study protocol amendment and where required in a new version of the study protocol 
(Revised CSP).
The amendment is to be approved by the relevant EC and if applicable, also the national 
regulatory authority approval, before implementation. Local requirements are to be followed for 
revised protocols.
AstraZeneca or designated CRO will distribute any subsequent amendments and new versions of 
the protocol to each Principal Investigator(s). For distribution to EC see Section 10.3.
If a protocol amendment requires a change to a study center’s ICF/assent, AstraZeneca and the 
study center’s EC are to approve the revised ICF/assent before the revised form is used. 
If local regulations require, any administrative change will be communicated to or approved by 
each EC.
10.6 Audits and inspections
Authorized representatives of AstraZeneca, a regulatory authority, or an Ethics Committee may 
perform audits or inspections at the study center, including source data verification. The purpose 
of an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-related 
activities and documents, to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP), guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation , and any applicable 
regulatory requirements. The Investigator will contact AstraZeneca immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency or other body about an inspection or an audit at the study center.

2(3)FURTHER GUIDANCE ON THE DEFINITION OF A SERIOUS 
ADVERSE EVENT (SAE)
Life threatening
‘Life-threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
subject’s death.  ‘Life-threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospitalisation
Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema).  Hospital admissions and/or surgical 
operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way during the study.
Important medical event or medical intervention
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospitalisation, disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious.These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used.
Examples of such events are:
! Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatment
! Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring 
treatment with N-acetylcys teine
! Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
! Blood dyscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc) or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation
! Development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Study Code D3250C00033
Edition Number 1.0
Date 14 December 2015
3(3)A GUIDE TO INTERPRETING THE CAUSALITY QUESTION
The following factors should be considered when deciding if there is a “reasonable 
possibility” that an AE may have been caused by the drug.
! Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the subject actually received the 
suspect drug?  Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the 
administration of the suspect drug?
! Consistency with known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same 
pharmacological class? OR could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological properties?
! Dechallenge experience.  Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing 
the dose of the suspect drug?
! No alternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetiology 
such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
! Rechallenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a rechallenge.
! Laboratory tests.  A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed 
the relationship?
A “reasonable possibility” could be considered to exist for an AE where one or more of these 
factors exist.
In contrast, there would not be a “reasonable possibility” of causality if none of the above 
criteria apply or where there is evidence of exposure and a reasonable time course but any 
dechallenge (if performed) is negative or ambiguous or there is another more likely cause of 
the AE.
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
! Is this a recognised feature of overdose of the drug?
! Is there a known mechanism?
Ambiguous cases should be considered as being a “reasonable possibility” of a causal 
relationship unless further evidence becomes available to refute this.  Causal relationship in 
cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of effect should be classified 
as no reasonable possibility.

2(3)LABELLING AND SHIPMENT OF BIOHAZARD SAMPLES
International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) classifies biohazardous agents into 3 
categories (http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_substances.
htm).  For transport purposes the classification of infectious substances according to risk
groups was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) in the 46th edition 
(2005).  Infectious substances are now classified either as Category A, Category B or Exempt. 
There is no direct relationship between Risk Groups and categories A and B.
Category A Infectious Substances are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability, life-threatening or fatal disease in 
otherwise healthy humans or animals.  Category A pathogens are eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus:
! are to be packed and shipped in accordance with IATA Instruction 602.
Category B Infectious Substances are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Category A. Category B pathogens are eg, Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses, 
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2. They are assigned the following UN 
number and proper shipping name:
! UN 3373 – Biological Substance, Category B
! are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650
Exempt - all other materials with minimal risk of containing pathogens
! Clinical trial samples will fall into Category B or exempt under IATA regulations
! Clinical trial samples will routinely be packed and transported at ambient 
temperature in IATA 650 compliant packaging 
(http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_substances.
htm)
! Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional dangerous goods 
specification for the dry-ice content
! IATA compliant courier and packaging materials should be used for packing and 
transportation and packing should be done by an IATA certified person, as 
applicable

3(3)! Samples routinely transported by road or rail are subject to local regulations which 
require that they are also packed and transported in a safe and appropriate way to contain any risk of infection or contamination by using approved couriers and 
packaging / containment materials at all times.  The IATA 650 biological sample 
containment standards are encouraged wherever possible when road or rail transport 
is used.

3(7)1. INTRODUCTION
During the course of the study the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry.  
The investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets potential Hy’s Law (PHL) 
criteria at any point during the study. 
The Investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in review and 
assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria are met.  HL criteria 
are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry other than Drug 
Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) ( FDA Guidance 
2009 ).
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting Adverse 
Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes.
2. DEFINITIONS
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3x Upper Limit of Normal 
(ULN) and Total Bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2xULN at any point during the study irrespective of an increase in 
Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP).  The elevations do not have to occur at the same time or within a specified time frame.
Hy’s Law (HL)
AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN andTBL ≥ 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the IMP, can be found to 
explain the combination of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug.  The elevations do not have to occur at the same time or within a specified time frame.
3. IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW CASES
In order to identify cases of PHL it is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data 
for any patient who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation or in combination:
! ALT ≥ 3xULN
! AST ≥ 3xULN
! TBL ≥ 2xULN
When a patient meets any of the identification criteria, in isolation or in combination, the central 
laboratory will immediately send an alert to the Investigator (also sent to AstraZeneca representative).

4(7)The Investigator will also remain vigilant for any local laboratory reports where the identification 
criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:
! Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by the central laboratory
! Complete the appropriate unscheduled laboratory CRF module(s) with the original 
local laboratory test result
When the identification criteria are met from central or local laboratory results the Investigator will 
without delay:
! Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section 2of this Appendix for 
definition) by reviewing laboratory reports from all previous visits (including both 
central and local laboratory results)
4. FOLLOW-UP
4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
! Inform the AstraZeneca representative that the patient has not met PHL criteria.
! Perform follow-up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance 
provided in the Clinical Study Protocol.
4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
! Notify the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform the central Study Team 
The Study Physician contacts the Investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an approach for 
the study patients’ follow-up and the continuous review of data.  Subsequent to this contact the 
Investigator will:
! Monitor the patient until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated 
! Investigate the etiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as 
discussed with the Study Physician
! Complete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available 
! If at any time (in consultation with the Study Physician) the PHL case meets serious 
criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures

5(7)5. REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW 
CASES
The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.
No later than 3 weeks after the biochemistry abnormality was initially detected, the Study Physician 
contacts the Investigator in order to review available data and agree on whether there is an alternative 
explanation for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the IMP.  The AstraZeneca Medical 
Science Director and Global Safety Physician will also be involved in this review together with other subject matter experts as appropriate.
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Investigator will follow the instructions 
below.
If there isan agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a determination of 
whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently whether the AE meets the 
criteria for a SAE:
! If the alternative explanation is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
! If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the CRF 
accordingly and follow the AZ standard processes
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL elevations other 
than the IMP:
! Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AstraZeneca standard 
processes. 
∀The ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion should be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
∀As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there is an unavoidable delay, of over 3 weeks, in obtaining the information necessary to assess 
whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternative 
explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:
! Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy’s Law’) applying serious criteria and 
causality assessment as per above
! Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary 
supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to 
determine whether HL criteria are met.  Update the SAE report according to the outcome of the review

6(7)6. ACTIONS REQUIRED WHEN POTENTIAL HY’S LAW
CRITERIA ARE MET BEFORE AND AFTER STARTING STUDY 
TREATMENT 
This section is applicable to patients who meet PHL criteria on study treatment having previously met 
PHL criteria at a study visit prior to starting study treatment.
At the first on study treatment occurrence of PHL criteria being, even if there has been no significant 
change the patient’s condition# compared with pre-study treatment visits, the Investigator will:

# A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any of the 
individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or total bilirubin) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms. The determination of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the Investigator, this may be in consultation with the Study 
Physician if there is any uncertainty.
7. ACTIONS REQUIRED FOR REPEAT EPISODES OF 
POTENTIAL HY’S LAW
This section is applicable when a patient meets PHL criteria on study treatment and has already met PHL 
criteria at a previous on study treatment visit.
The requirement to conduct follow-up, review and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of PHL is based 
on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence.  
The investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met and 
answer the following question:
! Was the alternative cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met 
chronic or progressing malignant disease << or did the patient meet PHL criteria prior 
to starting study treatment and at their first on study treatment visit as described in 
Section 6>>?
If No: follow the process described in Section 4.2 of this Appendix
If Yes:
Determine if there has been a significant change in the patient’s condition#compared with when PHL 
criteria were previously met
! If there is no significant change no action is required

2(5)1. INTRODUCTION
As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible.  The World Health 
Organization has categorized anaphylaxis into 2 subgroups, which are clinically indistinguishable: 
immunologic [IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated (eg, IgG and immune complex mediated) and 
nonimmunologic (Johansson et al 2004).  The clinical criteria for defining anaphylaxis for this study are listed in section  2.  A guide to the signs and symptoms and management of acute anaphylaxis is provided 
in section  3.  Appropriate drugs, such as epinephrine, antihistamines, corticosteroids, etc, and medical 
equipment to treat anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available at study sites, and study 
personnel should be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis according to local guidelines. 
If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, a blood sample will be drawn from the patient as soon as possible after 
the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minutes after the event, and at discharge for analysis of serum tryptase.
2. CLINICAL CRITERIA FOR DEFINING ANAPHYLAXIS AND 
IMMUNE COMPLEX DISEASE
Anaphylaxis
In adults, anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled:
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula)
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
(a) Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced 
PEF, hypoxemia).
(b) Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction 
(eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence).
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for 
that patient (minutes to several hours):
(a) Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula).
(b) Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced 
PEF, hypoxemia).
(c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence).
(d) Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting).

3(5)3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): 
Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that patient’s baseline.
Immune Complex Disease
Immune complex disease or Hypersensitivity Type III is evoked by the deposition of antigen-antibody or 
antigen-antibody-complement complexes on cell surfaces, with subsequent involvement of breakdown 
products of complement, platelets, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and development of vasculitis; serum sickness and nephritis is common.
3. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS AND MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE 
ANAPHYLAXIS
Anaphylaxis is an acute and potentially lethal multi-system allergic reaction in which some or all of the 
following signs and symptoms occur: 
!Diffuse erythema
!Pruritus
!Urticaria and/or angioedema
!Bronchospasm
!Laryngeal edema
!Hypotension
!Cardiac arrhythmias
!Feeling of impending doom
!Unconsciousness
!Shock
Other earlier or concomitant signs and symptoms can include:
!Itchy nose, eyes, pharynx, genitalia, palms, and soles
!Rhinorrhea
!Change in voice
!Metallic taste
!Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps and bloating

4. MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE ANAPHYLAXIS
4.1 Immediate intervention
1. Assessment of airway, breathing, circulation, and adequacy of mentation.
2. Administer epinephrine intramuscularly every 5-15 minutes, in appropriate doses, as necessary, 
depending on the presenting signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, to control signs and symptoms 
and prevent progression to more severe symptoms such as respiratory distress, hypotension, 
shock and unconsciousness.
4.2 Possibly appropriate, subsequent measures depending on response to 
epinephrine
(a) Place patient in recumbent position and elevate lower extremities.
(b) Establish and maintain airway.
(c) Administer oxygen.(d) Establish venous access.
(e) Normal saline IV for fluid replacement.
4.3 Specific measures to consider after epinephrine injections, where 
appropriate
(a) Consider epinephrine infusion.
(b) Consider H1 and H2 antihistamines.(c) Consider nebulized β2 agonist [eg, albuterol (salbutamol)] for bronchospasm 
resistant to epinephrine.
(d) Consider systemic corticosteroids.(e) Consider vasopressor (e.g. dopamine).
(f) Consider glucagon for patient taking b-blocker.
(g) Consider atropine for symptomatic bradycardia.(h) Consider transportation to an emergency department or an intensive care facility.

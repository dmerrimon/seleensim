Title of the Protocol :  
A Multicenter, Randomized, Open -Label Phase 3 Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safet y of 
Aldoxorubicin  Compared to Investigator’s Choice  in Subjects with Metastatic, Locally Advanced, or 
Unresectable Soft Tissue Sarcomas Who Either Relapsed  or Were Refractory to Prior Non -Adjuvant 
Chemotherapy  
Primary Objective:  
The primary objective  of this study is to determine the effica cy of administration of aldoxorubicin  
compared to investigator’s choice of treatment in subjects with metastatic , locally advanced,  or 
unresectable soft tissue sarcoma s who have relapsed or were refractory to prior non -adjuvant 
chemotherapy, as measured by  progression -free survival  (PFS) . 
Secondary Objective s: 
The secondary objective s of this study are to evaluate the  efficacy of aldoxorubicin as measured by 
OS, safety of aldoxorubicin  compared to investigator’s choice in this population assessed by the 
frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), abnormal findings on physical examination, 
laboratory tests, vital signs, echocardiogram  (ECHO) evaluations, electrocardiogram  (ECG ) results , 
and weight , as well as disease control rate,  tumor response and quality of life  (quality of life 
evaluation will only be used for exploratory purposes) . 
Exploratory  Objective s: 
To determin e the pharmacokinetics (PK) of aldoxorubicin, doxorubicin, and doxorubicinol following 
intravenous (IV) administration of aldoxorubicin, and to evaluate the exposure -response relationships 
between aldoxorubicin, doxorubicin, and/or doxorubicinol and PFS, OS, and selected safety 
parameters.  
Study Rational e and Significance:  
Aldoxorubicin ( INNO -206; DOXO -EMCH)  is a novel prodrug that binds covalently to albumin in the 
circulation. The drug is accumulated in tumors and doxorubicin is released in the tumor by cleaving 
the acid labile linker (EMCH) in the low pH tumor environment.  This carrier -linked prodrug  has 
demonstrated enhanced anti tumor activity with reduced toxicity in several murine models when 
compared with free doxorubicin.  
Patients with m etastatic,  locally advanced, or  unresectable soft tissue sarcomas who have failed prior 
chemotherapies  have a poor prognosis with PFS of around 2-4.6 months and median OS of 
approximately 9-12 months.  Several chemotherapy regimens have been explored as palliative 
therapy for subject s with these patients and include such agents as ifosfamide, gemcitabine, 
docetaxel, vinorelbine, dacarbazine, temozolomide , epirubicin , pazopanib and liposomal doxorubicin. 
However, these regimens  can be quite toxic  and have not significant ly impacted  either progressi on-
free or OS in these individuals. Pazopanib , recently approved in the US  and Europe , does appear to 
extend PFS in soft tissue sarcoma  patients (except liposarcomas ) who have relapsed after receiving 
prior chemotherapy  compared  to no treatment , but does not increase OS. Aldoxorubicin  may improve  
upon  the activity of doxorubicin without an increase in  toxicity as has been demonstrated in animal 
studies.

Study Design and Methodology:  
This is a phase 3 open -label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of aldoxorubicin  administered at 
350 mg/m2 (260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent ) intravenously on Day 1 every 21 days  for up to 8 
cycles  compared to investigator’s choice of treatment  among 5 different therapies . These therapies 
includ e:  1) dacarbazine administered at 1000 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion ( IVI), over 90±15 
minutes on Day 1  every 21 days for up to 8 consecutive cycles ; 2) pazopanib, 800 mg orally each day 
until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs; 3) gemcitab ine, 900 mg/m2 by IVI over 90 
minutes on Days 1 and 8, plus docetaxel, 100 mg/m2 by IVI over 1 hour on Day 8 of a 28 day cycle 
for up to 8 cycles; 4) doxorubicin, 75 mg/m2 by IVI over 5 to 30 minutes every 21 days for up to 8 
cycles or a maximum cumulative  dose of 550 mg/m2; or 5) ifosfamide 2.0 g/m2 administered over 2 to 
4 hours on Days 1 -4 of a 21 day cycle + mesna per standard site administration regimen for up to 8 
cycles. The investigative site must pre-specify  their choice of treatments for the compa rator arm to 
be used at thei r site, and no more than 3 treatment regimens may be selected for the comparator arm 
at each site  which  must be selected prior  to the study site initiation visit . Subjects will be randomized 
1:1 to receive eithe r aldoxorubicin  or investigator ’s choice of up to 3 control regimens  pre-selected by 
the study site . Pretreatment with G -CSF is permitted according to ASCO Guidelines (Appendix E).  
All Screening requirements, including an ECHO exam, must be completed within 28 days of the  
Cycle 1 -Day 1 visit . Subjects receiving aldoxorubicin, ifosfamide, dacarbazine  or doxorubicin will  
visit the study site on Day 1 of each cycle.  They will have complete blood counts  (CBC) and serum 
chemistries  on Day 15 and Day 21 (if Day 21 does not corr espond to Day 1 of the next cycle,  
±3 days ; Day 28 for subjects taking pazopanib ) of each cycle as well.  Subjects receiving pazopanib 
will vis it the study site on Day 1 of their next cycle  for monitoring , testing (same as for Day 1 for other 
treatment reg imens)  and to receive a new supply of study drug.  Subjects receiving gemcitabine plus 
docetaxel will visit the study site on both days of their infusions (Day s 1 and 8 ) and at Day 21 of each 
cycle. Safety monitoring, including AEs, a directed physical exam ination , laboratory evaluations 
(serum chemistry, CBC, and urinalysis ), vital signs, weight measurements, Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group  (ECOG ) performance status  (PS) and ECG s will be performed  on Day 1  (for all 
subjects) of each cycle . Cardiac functi on will also be followed periodically  (per Schedule of Treatment 
and Evaluations  in Appendix A ) with ECHOs  for subjects receiving either aldoxorubicin or 
doxorubicin . Treatment will continue until tumor progression is observed, 8 cycles of treatment are 
completed (except for pazopanib), subject asks to withdraw, unacceptable toxicity occurs , a change 
in therapy would be in the best interest of the subject, subject becomes pregnant or fails to use 
adequate birth control, need for any treatment not allowed by  the protocol, or subject is non -compliant 
with study requirements.  
Tumor response will be monitored at screening , every 6 weeks from Cycle 1 -Day 1 through Week 30 , 
and then  every 12 weeks  until disease progression  using the Response Evaluation Criteria in  Solid 
Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criteria .[50] OS, PFS, and PFS at 4 and 6 months  will be evaluated . Objective 
overall response rate (ORR) (complete and partial responses  [PRs] ), disease control rate (objective 
responses plus stable disease at 4 months)  and quality of life  will be assessed .  
The PK of aldoxorubicin, doxorubicin, and doxorubicinol  will be evaluated using a sparse sample 
analysis. Plasma samples will be collected at C ycle 1 at the following time points: the end of the 
infusion, between 1.5 and 4 ho urs from the end of the infusion, and on Days 2, and 3. If necessary  
and possible , PK samples may be collected at a later cycle.

Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administratio n: 
Aldoxorubicin : Lyophilized powder in vials that contain 200 mg of aldoxorubicin  reconstituted by  
adding a solution of 50% ethanol: 50% sterile water , administration completed  within 2 h ours (of 
being reconstituted)  as a 30 -minute IVI Lactated Ringer’s s olution . Total dose of 350 mg/m2  
(260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent).  
Investigator’s Choice : Up to three treatment regimens are to be chosen by the investigator from the 
list above prior to the initiation of the study site and the treatment chosen for each  subject enrolled in 
the study must be entered into the case report form.  
Dacarbazine  100 mg/vial and 200 mg/vial are reconstituted with 9.9 mL and 19.7 mL , respectively , 
Sterile Water for Injection , USP . The resulting solution contains 10 mg/mL of dacarba zine having a 
pH of 3.0 to 4.0. The calculated dose of the resulting solution is drawn into a syringe and 
administered only intravenously.  The reconstituted solution may be further diluted with 5% dextrose 
injection, or  sodium chloride injection (250 to 500 mL), and administered as an IVI over 90±15 
minutes.  
After reconstitution and prior to use, the solution in the vial may be stored  at 4°C for up to 72 hours or 
at normal room conditions (temperature and  light) for up to 8 hours. If the reconstituted solut ion is 
further diluted in  5% dextrose injection or sodium chloride injection, the resulting solution  may be 
stored at 4 °C for up to 24 hours or at normal room conditions for  up to 8 hours.  
Pazopanib  (Votrient®) 200 mg tablets can be stored at room temperat ure between 20° and 25°C; 
excursions are permitted between 15° and 30 °C. Tablets are taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after a 
meal and tablets are NOT to be crushed.  
Gemcitabine  200 mg or 1 g  lyophilized powder in a single use vial is reconstituted with 0.9%  NaCl to 
a final concentration of ≤40 mg/mL and pH 2.7 to 3.3. The reconstituted solution may be further 
diluted with 0.9% NaCl and administered by IVI in <60 minutes. It is stable for up to 24 hours at 
controlled room temperature  
(20° to 25°C) and should not be refrigerated.  
Docetaxel  80 mg/2 mL and 20 mg/0.5 mL with diluents for both strengths (13% [w/w] ethanol in water 
for injection) is administered by IVI over approximately 60 minutes after dilution into a 250 to 500 mL 
infusion bag of either 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose solution to produ ce a final concentration of 0.3 to 
0.74 mg/mL. Docetaxel final dilution for infusion should be administered within 4 hours of preparation. 
It can be stored between 2° and 25°C.  
Doxorubicin HCl  Injection is a sterile parenteral, isotonic available in 5 mL ( 10 mg), 10 mL (20 mg),  
25 mL (50 mg) single dose vials. Each mL contains doxorubicin HCl and the following inactive 
ingredients:   NaCl (0.9%) and water for injection q.s. Hydrochloric acid is used to adjust the pH to a 
target of pH of 3.0. The reconstitut ed solution is diluted in 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose and may be 
administered over 5 to 30 minutes.  
Ifosamide single -dose vials for constitution and administration by IVI each contain 1 gram or 3 grams

Protocol Number:  
ALDOXORUBICIN -P3-STS-01 Phase of Development: 3 
 
Statistical Methods:  
In accordance with the intention -to-treat principle, all randomized subjects  will be evaluated for 
efficacy. All subjects  who receive  at least 1 dose of study medication  will be evaluated for safety.   
Efficacy:   
The primary analysis of PFS will be carried out when approximately 191 PFS events have been 
observed (approximately 15 months following  the comple tion of  enrollment of  400 subjects ). Survival 
distributions will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and the two groups will be compared 
using a two -sided log rank test at the  α=0.05 level of significance.  
An important secondary  endpoint is overall survival (OS). The analysis of OS will be considered 
confirmatory only if the PFS analysis is statistically significant. As a result, the nominal level of 
significance for the OS ana lysis will be α=0.05. However, because an interim analysis of OS will be 
carried out at the time of the analysis of PFS, the levels of significance for the interim and final 
analyses of OS will be α=0.00305 and α=0.049, respectively.  
The final ana lysis of OS will be completed when 320 OS events have occurred. Survival distributions 
will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and the two groups will be compared using a two -
sided log rank test at the α=0.049 level of significance. The same methodology wil l be used for the 
interim analysis, but at the α=0.00305 level of significance.  
Tumor response will be monitored  at screening , every 6 weeks from Cycle 1 -Day 1 through Week 30 , 
and then  every 12 weeks  until disease progression. The percentage of subjects w ith complete or 
PRs, or stable disease will be evaluated  and the disease control rate (CR, PR and SD  at 4 months) 
will be compared using Pearson’s chi -square test, or if 20% or more of the expected cell frequencies 
are <5, Fisher’s exact test. Patient repo rted outcomes as assessed by the EORTC Quality of Life 
Questionnaire will be analyzed using analysis of covariance.  
Sample Size Justification:  
Power calculations and subject numbers were calculated based on the primary endpoint of PFS. 
Reviewing the litera ture for studies that have evaluated gemcitabine + docetaxel, pazopanib , 
ifosfamide  and dacarbazine as treatment for patients that have relapsed or not responded to first line 
therapies, it is estimated that the median PFS for the investigator’s choice gro up will be 3.5 months 
and that the median PFS for the aldoxorubicin group will be 5.6 months.  Based on the use of a two -
sided log rank test at the α=0.05 level of significance, a total of 191 PFS events will be required for 
90% power to detect this difference.  Assuming an 1 8 month accrual period and a 15 month follow -up 
period after enrollment of the last subject, approximately 400 subjects will be n eeded to achieve the 
total of 191 PFS events.  
Safety:  
The safety data will be summarized by treatment group.  The treatment groups will be compared with 
respect to occurrence of each AE. Total number of AEs leading to withdrawal, and abnormal 
laboratory te sts will be compared between groups using Fisher ’s exact test. AEs, ability to remain on 
assigned treatment (tolerability), and abnormal findings on physical examinations, vital signs, weight, 
ECG results, laboratory test results, and use of concomitant me dications, will be assessed to 
characterize the safety profile of the treatment regimens. Descriptive statistics denoting the changes 
from baseline to the final assessment visit with respect to key laboratory parameters and vital signs 
will also be provide d.

ALDOXORUBICIN -P3-STS-01 Phase of Development: 3 
Title of the Protocol :  
A Multicenter, Randomized, Open -Label Phase 3 Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safet y of 
Aldoxorubicin  Compared to Investigator’s Choice  in Subjects with Metastatic, Locally Advanced, or 
Unresectable Soft Tissue Sarcomas Who Either Relapsed or Were Refractory to Prior Non -Adjuvant 
Chemotherapy  
Primary Objective:  
The primary objective  of this study is to determine the effica cy of administrat ion of aldoxorubicin  
compared to investigator’s choice of treatment in subjects with metastatic , locally advanced,  or 
unresectable soft tissue sarcoma s who have relapsed or were refractory to prior non -adjuvant 
chemotherapy, as measured by  progression -free survival  (PFS) . 
Secondary Objective s: 
The secondary objective s of this study are to evaluate the  efficacy of aldoxorubicin as measured by 
OS, safety of aldoxorubicin  compared to investigator’s choice in this population assessed by the 
frequency and severi ty of adverse events (AEs), abnormal findings on physical examination, 
laboratory tests, vital signs, echocardiogram  (ECHO) evaluations, electrocardiogram  (ECG ) results , 
and weight , as well as disease control rate,  and tumor response.  
Exploratory  Objective s: 
To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of aldoxorubicin, doxorubicin, and doxorubicinol following 
intravenous (IV) administration of aldoxorubicin, and to evaluate the exposure -response relationships 
between aldoxorubicin, doxorubicin, and/or doxorubici nol and PFS, OS, selected safety parameters , 
and quality of life . 
Study Rational e and Significance:  
Aldoxorubicin ( INNO -206; DOXO -EMCH)  is a novel prodrug that binds covalently to circulating 
albumin. The drug is accumulated in tumors and doxorubicin is r eleased in the tumor by cleaving the 
acid labile linker (EMCH) in the low pH tumor environment.  This carrier -linked prodrug  has 
demonstrated enhanced anti tumor activity with reduced toxicity in several murine models when 
compared with free doxorubicin.  
Patients with m etastatic,  locally advanced, or  unresectable soft tissue sarcomas who have failed prior 
chemotherapies  have a poor prognosis with PFS of around 2-4.6 months and median OS of 
approximately 9-12 months.  Several chemotherapy regimens have been exp lored as palliative 
therapy for subject s with these patients and include such agents as ifosfamide, gemcitabine, 
docetaxel, vinorelbine, dacarbazine, temozolomide , epirubicin , pazopanib and liposomal doxorubicin. 
However, these regimens  can be quite toxic  and have not significantly  impacted  either progressi on-
free or OS in these individuals. Pazopanib , recently approved in the US  and Europe , does appear to 
extend PFS in soft tissue sarcoma  patients (except liposarcomas ) who have relapsed after receiving 
prior chemotherapy  compared to no treatment , but does not increase OS. Aldoxorubicin  may improve  
upon  the activity of doxorubicin without an increase in  toxicity as has been demonstrated in animal 
studies.

ALDOXORUBICIN -P3-STS-01 Phase of Development: 3 
 
Study Design and Methodology:  
This is a phase 3 open -label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of aldoxorubicin  administered at 
350 mg/m2 (260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent ) intravenously on Day 1 every 21 days  until tumor 
progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs  compared to investigator’s choice of treatment  among  
5 different therapies . These therapies include:  1) dacarbazine administered at 1000 mg/m2 by 
intravenous infusion ( IVI), over 90±15 minutes on Day 1  every 21 days  until tumor progression or 
unacceptable toxicity occurs ; 2) pazopanib, 800 mg orally each day until tumor progression or 
unacceptable toxicity occurs; 3) gemcitabine, 900 mg/m2 by IVI over 90 minutes on Days 1 and 8, 
plus docetaxel, 100 mg/m2 by IVI over 1 hour on Day 8 of a 28 day cycle until tumor progression or 
unacceptable to xicity occurs ; 4) doxorubicin, 75 mg/m2 by IVI over 5 to 30 minutes every 21 days for a 
maximum cumulative dose of 550 mg/m2 or unacceptable toxicity occurs ; or 5) ifosfamide 2.0 g/m2 
administered over 2 to 4 hours on Days 1 -4 of a 21 day cycle + mesna per  standard site 
administration regimen until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs . The investigative site 
must pre-specify  their choice of treatments for the comparator arm to be used at thei r site, and no 
more than 3 treatment regimens may be selected for the comparator arm at each site  which  must be 
selected prior  to the study site initiation visit . Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive eithe r 
aldoxorubicin  or investigator ’s choice of up to 3 control regimens  pre-selected by the study sit e. 
Pretreatment with G -CSF is permitted according to ASCO Guidelines (Appendix E).  
All Screening requirements, including an ECHO exam, must be completed within 28 days of the  
Cycle 1 -Day 1 visit . Subjects receiving aldoxorubicin, ifosfamide, dacarbazine  or doxorubicin will  
visit the study site on Day 1 of each cycle.  They will have complete blood counts  (CBC) and serum 
chemistries  on Day 15 and Day 21 (if Day 21 does not correspond to Day 1 of the next cycle,  
±3 days ; Day 28 for subjects taking pazopanib ) of each cycle as well.  Subjects receiving pazopanib 
will vis it the study site on Day 1 of their next cycle  for monitoring , testing (same as for Day 1 for other 
treatment regimens)  and to receive a new supply of study drug.  Subjects receiving gemcitabine plus 
docetaxel will visit the study site on both days of their infusions (Day s 1 and 8 ) and at Day 21 of each 
cycle. Safety monitoring, including AEs, a directed physical exam ination , laboratory evaluations 
(serum chemistry, CBC, and urinalysis ), vital sig ns, weight measurements, Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group  (ECOG ) performance status  (PS) and ECG s will be performed  on Day 1  (for all 
subjects) of each cycle . Cardiac function will also be followed periodically  (per Schedule of Treatment 
and Evaluations  in Appendix A ) with ECHOs  for subjects receiving either aldoxorubicin or 
doxorubicin . Treatment will continue until tumor progression is observed,  a maximum cumulative 
dose of 550 mg/m2 is reached (doxorubicin) , subject asks to withdraw, unacceptable toxic ity occurs ,  
a change in therapy would be in the best interest of the subject, subject becomes pregnant or fails to 
use adequate birth control, need for any treatment not allowed by the protocol, or subject is  
non-compliant with study requirements.  
Tumor response will be monitored at screening , every 6 weeks from Cycle 1 -Day 1 through Week 30 , 
and then  every 12 weeks  until disease progression  using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criteria .[50] OS, PFS, and PFS at 4 and 6 month s will be evaluated . Objective 
overall response rate (ORR) (complete and partial responses  [PRs] ), disease control rate (objective 
responses plus stable disease at 4 months)  and quality of life  will be assessed .  
The PK of aldoxorubicin, doxorubicin, and d oxorubicinol  will be evaluated using a sparse sample 
analysis. Plasma samples will be collected at C ycle 1 at the following time points: the end of the 
infusion, between 1.5 and 4 hours from the end of the infusion, and on Days 2, and 3. If necessary  
and p ossible , PK samples may be collected at a later cycle.

ALDOXORUBICIN -P3-STS-01 Phase of Development: 3 
 
Test Product, Dose and Mode of Admini stration:  
Aldoxorubicin : Lyophilized powder in vials that contain 200 mg of aldoxorubicin  reconstituted by  
adding a solution of 50% ethanol: 50% sterile water , administration completed  within 2 h ours (of 
being reconstituted)  as a 30 -minute IVI Lactated Rin ger’s solution . Total dose of 350 mg/m2  
(260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent).  
Investigator’s Choice : Up to three treatment regimens are to be chosen by the investigator from the 
list below  prior to the initiation of the study site and the treatment chosen f or each subject enrolled in 
the study must be entered into the case report form.  
Dacarbazine  100 mg/vial and 200 mg/vial are reconstituted with 9.9 mL and 19.7 mL , respectively , 
Sterile Water for Injection , USP . The resulting solution contains 10 mg/mL of dacarbazine having a 
pH of 3.0 to 4.0. The calculated dose of the resulting solution is drawn into a syringe and 
administered only intravenously.  The reconstituted solution may be further diluted with 5% dextrose 
injection, or  sodium chloride injection (25 0 to 500 mL), and administered as an IVI over 90±15 
minutes.  
After reconstitution and prior to use, the solution in the vial may be stored  at 4°C for up to 72 hours or 
at normal room conditions (temperature and  light) for up to 8 hours. If the reconstitute d solution is 
further diluted in  5% dextrose injection or sodium chloride injection, the resulting solution  may be 
stored at 4 °C for up to 24 hours or at normal room conditions for  up to 8 hours.  
Pazopanib  (Votrient®) 200 mg tablets can be stored at room t emperature between 20° and 25°C; 
excursions are permitted between 15° and 30 °C. Tablets are taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after a 
meal and tablets are NOT to be crushed.  
Gemcitabine  200 mg or 1 g  lyophilized powder in a single use vial is reconstituted wi th 0.9% NaCl to 
a final concentration of ≤40 mg/mL and pH 2.7 to 3.3. The reconstituted solution may be further 
diluted with 0.9% NaCl and administered by IVI in <60 minutes. It is stable for up to 24 hours at 
controlled room temperature  
(20° to 25°C) and should not be refrigerated.  
Docetaxel  80 mg/2 mL and 20 mg/0.5 mL with diluents for both strengths (13% [w/w] ethanol in water 
for injection) is administered by IVI over approximately 60 minutes after dilution into a 250 to 500 mL 
infusion bag of either 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose solution to produ ce a final concentration of 0.3 to 
0.74 mg/mL. Docetaxel final dilution for infusion should be administered within 4 hours of preparation. 
It can be stored between 2° and 25°C.  
Doxorubicin HCl  Injection is a sterile parenteral, isotonic available in 5 mL ( 10 mg), 10 mL (20 mg),  
25 mL (50 mg) single dose vials. Each mL contains doxorubicin HCl and the following inactive 
ingredients:   NaCl (0.9%) and water for injection q.s. Hydrochloric acid is used to adjust the pH to a 
target of pH of 3.0. The reconstitut ed solution is diluted in 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose and may be 
administered over 5 to 30 minutes.  
Ifosamide single -dose vials for constitution and administration by IVI each contain 1 gram or 3 grams 
of sterile ifosfamide , USP . Ifosfamide is a chemotherapeu tic agent chemically related to the nitrogen 
mustards and a synthetic analog of cyclophosphamide. Injections are prepared for parenteral use by 
adding Sterile Water for Injection, USP , or Sterile Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP  (benzyl 
alcohol or p arabens preserved) to the vial and shaking to dissolve. The reconstituted solution is 
diluted in 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose solution  and may be administered over 2 to 4 hours.

Statistical Methods:  
In accordance with the intention -to-treat principle, all randomized subjects  will be evaluated for 
efficacy. All subjects  who receive  at least 1 dose of study medication  will be evaluated for safety.   
Efficacy:   
The primary analysis of PFS will be carried out when approximately 191 PFS events have been 
observed (approximately 15 months following  the comple tion of  enrollment of  400 subjects ). Survival 
distributions will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and the two groups will be compared 
using a two -sided log rank t est at the α=0.05 level of significance.  
An important secondary  endpoint is overall survival (OS). The analysis of OS will be considered 
confirmatory only if the PFS analysis is statistically significant. As a result, the nominal level of 
significance for the OS analysis will be α=0.05. However, because an interim analysis of OS will be 
carried out at the time of the analysis of PFS, the levels of significance for the interim and final 
analyses of OS will be α=0.00305 and α=0.049, respectively.  
The final an alysis of OS will be completed when 320 OS events have occurred. Survival distributions 
will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and the two groups will be compared using a two -
sided log rank test at the α=0.049 level of significance. The same metho dology will be used for the 
interim analysis, but at the α=0.00305 level of significance.  
Tumor response will be monitored  at screening , every 6 weeks from Cycle 1 -Day 1 through Week 30 , 
and then  every 12 weeks  until disease progression. The percentage of subjects with complete or 
PRs, or stable disease will be evaluated  and the disease control rate (CR, PR and SD  at 4 months) 
will be compared using Pearson’s chi -square test, or if 20% or more of the expected cell frequencies 
are <5, Fisher’s exact test. Pa tient reported outcomes as assessed by the EORTC Quality of Life 
Questionnaire will be analyzed using analysis of covariance.  
Sample Size Justification:  
Power calculations and subject numbers were calculated based on the primary endpoint of 
PFS. Reviewing the literature for studies that have evaluated gemcitabine + docetaxel, 
pazopanib , ifosfamide  and dacarbazine as treatment for patients that have relapsed or not 
responded to first line therapies, it is estimated that the median PFS for the investigator’s 
choice group will be 3.5 months and that the median PFS for the aldoxorubicin group will be 
5.6 months.  Based on the use of a two -sided log rank test at the α=0.05 level of significance, 
a total of 191 PFS events will be required for 90% power to detect this difference.  Assuming 
an 1 8 month accrual period and a 15 month follow -up period after enrollment of the last 
subject, approximately 400 subjects will be n eeded to achieve the total of 191 PFS events.  
Safety:  
The safety data will be summarized by treatment group.  The treatment groups will be compared with 
respect to occurrence of each AE. Total number of AEs leading to withdrawal, and abnormal 
laboratory te sts will be compared between groups using Fisher ’s exact test. AEs, ability to remain on 
assigned treatment (tolerability), and abnormal findings on physical examinations, vital signs, weight, 
ECG results, laboratory test results, and use of concomitant me dications, will be assessed to 
characterize the safety profile of the treatment regimens. Descriptive statistics denoting the changes 
from baseline to the final assessment visit with respect to key laboratory parameters and vital signs 
will also be provide d.

ALDOXORUBICIN -P3-STS-01 Phase of Development: 3 
 
Title of the Protocol :  
A Multicenter, Randomized, Open -Label Phase 3 Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safet y of 
Aldoxorubici n Compared to Investigator’s Choice  in Subjects with Metastatic, Locally Advanced, or 
Unresectable Soft Tissue Sarcomas Who Either Relapsed or Were Refractory to Prior Non -Adjuvant 
Chemotherapy  
Primary Objective:  
The primary objective  of this study is to determine the effica cy of administration of aldoxorubicin  
compared to investigator’s choice of treatment in subjects with metastatic , locally advanced,  or 
unresectable soft tissue sarcoma s who have relapsed or were refractory to prior non -adjuvant 
chemothe rapy, as measured by  progression -free survival  (PFS) . 
Secondary Objective s: 
The secondary objective s of this study are to evaluate the  efficacy of aldoxorubicin as measured by 
OS, safety of aldoxorubicin  compared to investigator’s choice in this population  assessed by the 
frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), abnormal findings on physical examination, 
laboratory tests, vital signs, echocardiogram  (ECHO) evaluations, electrocardiogram  (ECG ) results , 
and weight , as well as disease control rate,  and tumor response.  
Exploratory  Objective s: 
To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of aldoxorubicin, doxorubicin, and doxorubicinol following 
intravenous (IV) administration of aldoxorubicin, and to evaluate the exposure -response relationships 
between aldoxoru bicin, doxorubicin, and/or doxorubicinol and PFS, OS, selected safety parameters , 
and quality of life . 
Study Rational e and Significance:  
Aldoxorubicin ( INNO -206; DOXO -EMCH)  is a novel prodrug that binds covalently to circulating 
albumin. The drug is accum ulated in tumors and doxorubicin is released in the tumor by cleaving the 
acid labile linker (EMCH) in the low pH tumor environment.  This carrier -linked prodrug  has 
demonstrated enhanced anti tumor activity with reduced toxicity in several murine models whe n 
compared with free doxorubicin.  
Patients with m etastatic,  locally advanced, or  unresectable soft tissue sarcomas who have failed prior 
chemotherapies  have a poor prognosis with PFS of around 2-4.6 months and median OS of 
approximately 9-12 months.  Severa l chemotherapy regimens have been explored as palliative 
therapy for subject s with these patients and include such agents as ifosfamide, gemcitabine, 
docetaxel, vinorelbine, dacarbazine, temozolomide , epirubicin , pazopanib and liposomal doxorubicin. 
Howeve r, these regimens  can be quite toxic  and have not significantly  impacted  either progressi on-
free or OS in these individuals. Pazopanib , recently approved in the US  and Europe , does appear to 
extend PFS in soft tissue sarcoma  patients (except liposarcomas ) who have relapsed after receiving 
prior chemotherapy  compared to no treatment , but does not increase OS. Aldoxorubicin  may improve  
upon  the activity of doxorubicin without an increase in  toxicity as has been demonstrated in animal 
studies.

Study Design an d Methodology:  
This is a phase 3 open -label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of aldoxorubicin  administered at 
350 mg/m2 (260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent ) intravenously on Day 1 every 21 days  until tumor 
progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs  compared to investigator’s choice of treatment  among  
5 different therapies . These therapies include:  1) dacarbazine administered at 1000 mg/m2 by 
intravenous infusion ( IVI), over 90±15 minutes on Day 1  every 21 days  until tumor progression or 
unacceptabl e toxicity occurs ; 2) pazopanib, 800 mg orally each day until tumor progression or 
unacceptable toxicity occurs; 3) gemcitabine, 900 mg/m2 by IVI in less than 60  minutes on Days 1 
and 8, plus docetaxel, 100 mg/m2 by IVI over 1 hour on Day 8 of a 21 day cyc le until tumor 
progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs ; 4) doxorubicin, 75 mg/m2 by IVI over 5 to 30 minutes 
every 21 days for a maximum cumulative dose of 550 mg/m2 or unacceptable toxicity occurs ; or 5) 
ifosfamide 2.0 g/m2 administered over 2 to 4 ho urs on Days 1 -4 of a 21 day cycle + mesna per 
standard site administration regimen until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs . The 
investigative site must pre-specify  their choice of treatments for the comparator arm to be used at 
their site, and no more than 3 treatment regimens may be selected for the comparator arm at each 
site which  must be selected prior  to the study site initiation visit . Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to 
receive eithe r aldoxorubicin  or investigator ’s choice of up to 3 control regimens  pre-selected by the 
study site . Pretreatment with G -CSF is permitted according to ASCO Guidelines (Appendix E).  
All Screening requirements, including an ECHO exam, must be completed within 28 days of the  
Cycle 1 -Day 1 visit . Subjects recei ving aldoxorubicin, ifosfamide, dacarbazine  or doxorubicin will  
visit the study site on Day 1 of each cycle.  They will have complete blood counts  (CBC) and serum 
chemistries  on Day 15 and Day 21 (if Day 21 does not correspond to Day 1 of the next cycle,  
±3 days ) of each cycle as well.  Subjects receiving pazopanib will vis it the study site on Day 1 of their 
next cycle  for monitoring , testing (same as for Day 1 for other treatment regimens)  and to receive a 
new supply of study drug.  Subjects receiving pazop anib will also have CBC and serum chemistry on 
Day 15 and Day 28 (if Day 28 does not correspond to Day 1 of the next cycle , ±2 days).  Subjects 
receiving gemcitabine plus docetaxel will visit the study site on both days of their infusions (Day s 1 
and 8 ) and at Day s 15 and  21 of each cycle. Safety monitoring, including AEs, a directed physical 
exam ination , laboratory evaluations ( serum chemistry, CBC, and urinalysis ), vital signs, weight 
measurements, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  (ECOG ) performance stat us (PS) and ECG s 
will be performed  on Day 1  (for all subjects) of each cycle . Cardiac function will also be followed 
periodically  (per Schedule of Treatment and Evaluations  in Appendix A ) with ECHOs  for subjects 
receiving either aldoxorubicin or doxorubici n. Treatment will continue until tumor progression is 
observed,  a maximum cumulative dose of 550 mg/m2 is reached (doxorubicin) , subject asks to 
withdraw, unacceptable toxicity occurs , a change in therapy would be in the best interest of the 
subject, subje ct becomes pregnant or fails to use adequate birth control, need for any treatment not 
allowed by the protocol, or subject is non -compliant with study requirements.  
Tumor response will be monitored at screening , every 6 weeks from Cycle 1 -Day 1 through Wee k 30, 
and then  every 12 weeks  until disease progression  using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criteria .[50] OS, PFS, and PFS at 4 and 6 months  will be evaluated . Objective 
overall response rate (ORR) (complete and partial resp onses  [PRs] ), disease control rate (objective 
responses plus stable disease at 4 months)  and quality of life  will be assessed .  
The PK of aldoxorubicin, doxorubicin, and doxorubicinol  will be evaluated using a sparse sample 
analysis. Plasma samples will be  collected at C ycle 1 at the following time points: the end of the 
infusion, between 1.5 and 4 hours from the end of the infusion, and on Days 2, and 3. If necessary  
and possible , PK samples may be collected at a later cycle.

Test Product, Dose and Mode of Admini stration:  
Aldoxorubicin : Lyophilized powder in vials that contain 200 mg of aldoxorubicin  reconstituted by  
adding a solution of 50% ethanol: 50% sterile water , administration completed  within 2 h ours (of 
being reconstituted)  as a 30 -minute IVI Lactated Rin ger’s solution . Total dose of 350 mg/m2  
(260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent).  
Investigator’s Choice : Up to three treatment regimens are to be chosen by the investigator from the 
list below  prior to the initiation of the study site and the treatment chosen f or each subject enrolled in 
the study must be entered into the case report form.  
Dacarbazine  100 mg/vial and 200 mg/vial are reconstituted with 9.9 mL and 19.7 mL , respectively , 
Sterile Water for Injection , USP . The resulting solution contains 10 mg/mL of dacarbazine having a 
pH of 3.0 to 4.0. The calculated dose of the resulting solution is drawn into a syringe and 
administered only intravenously.  The reconstituted solution may be further diluted with 5% dextrose 
injection, or  sodium chloride injection (25 0 to 500 mL), and administered as an IVI over 90±15 
minutes.  
After reconstitution and prior to use, the solution in the vial may be stored  at 4°C for up to 72 hours or 
at normal room conditions (temperature and  light) for up to 8 hours. If the reconstitute d solution is 
further diluted in  5% dextrose injection or sodium chloride injection, the resulting solution  may be 
stored at 4 °C for up to 24 hours or at normal room conditions for  up to 8 hours.  
Pazopanib  (Votrient®) 200 mg tablets can be stored at room t emperature between 20° and 25°C; 
excursions are permitted between 15° and 30 °C. Tablets are taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after a 
meal and tablets are NOT to be crushed.  
Gemcitabine  200 mg or 1 g  lyophilized powder in a single use vial is reconstituted wi th 0.9% NaCl to 
a final concentration of ≤40 mg/mL and pH 2.7 to 3.3. The reconstituted solution may be further 
diluted with 0.9% NaCl and administered by IVI in <60 minutes. It is stable for up to 24 hours at 
controlled room temperature (20° to 25°C) and should not be refrigerated.  
Docetaxel  80 mg/2 mL and 20 mg/0.5 mL with diluents for both strengths (13% [w/w] ethanol in water 
for injection) is administered by IVI over approximately 60 minutes after dilution into a 250 to 500 mL 
infusion bag of either 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose solution to produc e a final concentration of 0.3 to 
0.74 mg/mL. Docetaxel final dilution for infusion should be administered within 4 hours of preparation. 
It can be stored between 2° and 25°C.  
Doxorubicin HCl  Injection is a sterile parenteral, isotonic available in 5 mL (1 0 mg), 10 mL (20 mg),  
25 mL (50 mg) single dose vials. Each mL contains doxorubicin HCl and the following inactive 
ingredients:   NaCl (0.9%) and water for injection q.s. Hydrochloric acid is used to adjust the pH to a 
target of pH of 3.0. The reconstitute d solution is diluted in 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose and may be 
administered over 5 to 30 minutes.  
Ifosamide single -dose vials for constitution and administration by IVI each contain 1 gram or 3 grams

Statistical Methods:  
In accordance with the intention -to-treat principle, all randomized subjects  will be evaluated for 
efficacy. All subjects  who receive  at least 1 dose of study medication  will be evaluated for safety.   
Efficacy:   
The primary anal ysis of PFS will be carried out when approximately 191 PFS events have been 
observed (approximately 15 months following  the completion of  enrollment of  400 subjects ). Survival 
distributions will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and the two groups  will be compared 
using a two -sided log rank test at the α=0.05 level of significance.  
An important secondary  endpoint is overall survival (OS). The analysis of OS will be considered 
confirmatory only if the PFS analysis is statistically significant. As a result, the nominal level of 
significance for the OS analysis will be α=0.05. However, because an interim analysis of OS will be 
carried out at the time of the analysis of PFS, the levels of significance for the interim and final 
analyses of OS will be α=0 .00305 and α=0.049, respectively.  
The final ana lysis of OS will be completed when 320 OS events have occurred. Survival distributions 
will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and the two groups will be compared using a two -
sided log rank test at the  α=0.049 level of significance. The same methodology will be used for the 
interim analysis, but at the α=0.00305 level of significance.  
Tumor response will be monitored  at screening , every 6 weeks from Cycle 1 -Day 1 through Week 30 , 
and then  every 12 weeks  until disease progression. The percentage of subjects with complete or 
PRs, or stable disease will be evaluated  and the disease control rate (CR, PR and SD  at 4 months) 
will be compared using Pearson’s chi -square test, or if 20% or more of the expected ce ll frequencies 
are <5, Fisher’s exact test. Patient reported outcomes as assessed by the EORTC Quality of Life 
Questionnaire will be analyzed using analysis of covariance.  
Sample Size Justification:  
Power calculations and subject numbers were calculated ba sed on the primary endpoint of PFS. 
Reviewing the literature for studies that have evaluated gemcitabine + docetaxel, pazopanib , 
ifosfamide  and dacarbazine as treatment for patients that have relapsed or not responded to first line 
therapies, it is estimat ed that the median PFS for the investigator’s choice group will be 3.5 months 
and that the median PFS for the aldoxorubicin group will be 5.6 months.  Based on the use of a two -
sided log rank test at the α=0.05 level of significance, a total of 191 PFS events will be required for 
90% power to detect this difference.  Assuming an 1 8 month accrual period and a 15 month follow -up 
period after enrollment of the last subject, approximately 400 subjects will be n eeded to achieve the 
total of 191 PFS events.  
Safety:  
The safety data will be summarized by treatment group.  The treatment groups will be compared with 
respect to occurrence of each AE. Total number of AEs leading to withdrawal, and abnormal 
laboratory te sts will be compared between groups using Fisher ’s exact test. AEs, ability to remain on 
assigned treatment (tolerability), and abnormal findings on physical examinations, vital signs, weight, 
ECG results, laboratory test results, and use of concomitant me dications, will be assessed to 
characterize the safety profile of the treatment regimens. Descriptive statistics denoting the changes 
from baseline to the final assessment visit with respect to key laboratory parameters and vital signs 
will also be provide d.

and doxorubicinol PK parameters will be estimated based on a population PK analysis.  PK 
parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Exploratory exposure -response/exposure -safety analyses will be conducted using the primary and

ALDOXORUBICIN -P3-STS-01 Phase of Development: 3 
 
Title of the Protocol :  
A Multicenter, Randomized, Open -Label Phase 3 Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safet y of 
Aldoxorubicin  Compared to Investigator’s Choice  in Subjects with Metastatic, Locally Advanced, or 
Unresectable Soft Tissue Sarcomas Who Either Relapsed or Were Refractory to Prior Non -Adjuvant 
Chemotherapy  
Primary Objective:  
The primary obje ctive of this study is to determine the effica cy of administration of aldoxorubicin  
compared to investigator’s choice of treatment in subjects with metastatic , locally advanced,  or 
unresectable soft tissue sarcoma s who have relapsed or were refractory to p rior non -adjuvant 
chemotherapy, as measured by  progression -free survival  (PFS) . 
Secondary Objective s: 
The secondary objective s of this study are to evaluate the  efficacy of aldoxorubicin as measured by 
OS, safety of aldoxorubicin  compared to investigator’s  choice in this population assessed by the 
frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), abnormal findings on physical examination, 
laboratory tests, vital signs, echocardiogram  (ECHO) evaluations, electrocardiogram  (ECG ) results , 
and weight , as well as disease control rate,  and tumor response.  
Exploratory  Objective s: 
To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of aldoxorubicin, doxorubicin, and doxorubicinol following 
intravenous (IV) administration of aldoxorubicin, and to evaluate the exposure -response rela tionships 
between aldoxorubicin, doxorubicin, and/or doxorubicinol and PFS, OS, selected safety parameters , 
and quality of life . 
Study Rational e and Significance:  
Aldoxorubicin ( INNO -206; DOXO -EMCH)  is a novel prodrug that binds covalently to circulating 
albumin. The drug is accumulated in tumors and doxorubicin is released in the tumor by cleaving the 
acid labile linker (EMCH) in the low pH tumor environment.  This carrier -linked prodrug  has 
demonstrated enhanced anti tumor activity with reduced toxicity in  several murine models when 
compared with free doxorubicin.  
Patients with m etastatic,  locally advanced, or  unresectable soft tissue sarcomas who have failed prior 
chemotherapies  have a poor prognosis with PFS of around 2-4.6 months and median OS of 
approxi mately 9-12 months.  Several chemotherapy regimens have been explored as palliative 
therapy for subject s with these patients and include such agents as ifosfamide, gemcitabine, 
docetaxel, vinorelbine, dacarbazine, temozolomide , epirubicin , pazopanib and lip osomal doxorubicin. 
However, these regimens  can be quite toxic  and have not significantly  impacted  either progressi on-
free or OS in these individuals. Pazopanib , recently approved in the US  and Europe , does appear to 
extend PFS in soft tissue sarcoma  patie nts (except liposarcomas ) who have relapsed after receiving 
prior chemotherapy  compared to no treatment , but does not increase OS. Aldoxorubicin  may improve  
upon  the activity of doxorubicin without an increase in  toxicity as has been demonstrated in animal  
studies.

ALDOXORUBICIN -P3-STS-01 Phase of Development: 3 
 
Study Design and Methodology:  
This is a phase 3 open -label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of aldoxorubicin  administered at 350 
mg/m2 (260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent) intravenously on Day 1 every 21 days  until tumor progression 
or una cceptable toxicity occurs  compared to investigator’s choice of treatment  among  
5 different therapies . These therapies include  (dosages should follow the institutional standard of care, 
package  insert  (SPCs) , or the following suggestions  based on the US pa ckage inserts  and the literature ):  
1) dacarbazine administered at 1000 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion ( IVI), over 90±15 minutes on Day 1 
every 21 days  until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs ; 2) pazopanib, 800 mg orally each 
day until tumor  progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs; 3) gemcitabine, 900 mg/m2 by IVI in less than 
60 minutes on Days 1 and 8, plus docetaxel, 100 mg/m2 by IVI over 1 hour on Day 8 of a 21 day cycle until 
tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs ; 4) doxo rubicin, 75 mg/m2 by IVI over 5 to 30 minutes 
every 21 days for a maximum cumulative dose of 550 mg/m2 or unacceptable toxicity occurs ; or 5) 
ifosfamide 2.0 g/m2 administered over 2 to 4 hours on Days 1 -4 of a 21 day cycle + mesna per standard 
site adminis tration regimen until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs . The investigative site 
must pre-specify  their choice of treatments for the comparator arm to be used at thei r site, and no more 
than 3 treatment regimens may be selected for the compa rator arm at each site  which  must be selected 
prior  to the study site initiation visit . Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive eithe r aldoxorubicin  or 
investigator ’s choice of up to 3 control regimens  pre-selected by the study site . Treatment with G -CSF 
should be administered  to all subjects as per investigator’s clinical judgment or according to ASCO 
Guidelines (Appendix E).  Note:  aldoxorubicin has been associated with >20% incidence of grade 3 
or 4 neutropenia. Therefore, the administration of G -CSF should occur  even during Cycle 1.  
All Screening requirements, including an ECHO exam, must be completed within 28 days of the  
Cycle 1 -Day 1 visit . Subjects receiving aldoxorubicin, ifosfamide, dacarbazine  or doxorubicin will  
visit the study site on Day 1  of each cycle . They will have complete blood counts  (CBC) and serum 
chemistries  on Day 15 and Day 21 (if Day 21 does not correspond to Day 1 of the next cycle,  
±3 days ) of each cycle as well.  Subjects receiving pazopanib will vis it the study site on Day 1 of their next 
cycle  for monitoring , testing (same as for Day 1 for other treatment regimens)  and to receive a new supply 
of study drug.  Subjects receiving pazopanib will also have CBC and serum chemistry on Day 15 and Day 
28 (if Day 28 does not correspon d to Day 1 of the next cycle , ±2 days).  Subjects receiving gemcitabine 
plus docetaxel will visit the study site on both days of their infusions (Day s 1 and 8 ) and at Day s 15 and  21 
of each cycle. Safety monitoring, including AEs, a directed physical examin ation, laboratory evaluations 
(serum chemistry, CBC, and urinalysis), vital signs, weight measurements, Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group ( ECOG ) performance status (PS) and ECGs will be performed on Day 1  (for all subjects) of each 
cycle.  Subjects receivi ng aldoxorubicin will have blood drawn for serum electro lytes to evaluate the anion 
gap prior to each drug administration. Cardiac function will also be followed periodically  (per Schedule of 
Treatment and Evaluations  in Appendix A ) with ECHOs  for subjects  receiving either aldoxorubicin or 
doxorubicin . Treatment will continue until tumor progression is observed,  a maximum cumulative dose of 
550 mg/m2 is reached (doxorubicin) , subject asks to withdraw, unacceptable toxicity occurs , a change in 
therapy would be in the best interest of the subject, subject becomes pregnant or fails to use adequate 
birth control, need for any treatment not allowed by the protocol, or subject is non -compliant with study 
requirements.  
Tumor response will be monitored at screening , every 6 weeks from Cycle 1 -Day 1 through Week 30 , and 
then every 12 weeks  until disease progression using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) 1.1 criteria .[50] OS, PFS,  and PFS at 4 and 6 months  will be evaluated . Objective overall 
response rate (ORR) (complete and partial responses  [PRs] ), disease control rate (objective responses 
plus stable disease at 4 months) and quality of life will be assessed.  
The PK of aldoxorubicin, doxorubicin, and doxorubicinol will be evaluated using a s parse sample analysis. 
Plasma samples will be collected at Cycle 1 at the following time points: the end of the infusion, between 
1.5 and 4 hours from the end of the infusion, and on Days 2, and 3. If necessary and possible, PK samples 
may be collected at a later cycle.

Number of Subjects:  
Approximately 400 subjects with metastati c, locally advanced or unresectable soft tissue sarcomas 
who have either not responded to or have progressed after treatment with  1 or more systemic 
regimens of  non-adjuvant chemo therapies  will be randomized  1:1 (aldoxorubicin :investigator’s 
choice ) at app roximately 120 study centers in the US , Europe,  Canada, Latin America , and Australia . 
The randomization will be stratified according to their initial PS (ECOG 0 -1 vs 2), whether they had 
either 1 prior systemic  non-adjuvant  chemo therapy regimen s or >1 prior systemic non-adjuvant  
chemo therapy regimen s and whether they had received prior doxorubicin chemotherapy.   Subjects 
will also be stratified by their histopathological diagnosis as determined by the local site.  The four 
stratification groups will be leio myosarcomas, liposarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and all other sarcomas.

Aldoxorubicin : Lyophilized powder in vials that contain 200 mg of aldoxorubicin  reconstituted by  
adding a solution of 50% ethanol: 50% steri le water , administration completed  within 2 h ours (of 
being reconstituted)  as a 30 -minute IVI Lactated Ringer’s solution . Total dose of 350 mg/m2  
(260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent).  Aldoxorubicin infusion may exceed 30 minutes if deemed 
necessary by the i nvestigative site but the total time from the completion of  reconstitution of 
aldoxorubicin to completion of infusion must  not be more than 2 hours.  
Investigator’s Choice : Up to three treatment regimens are to be chosen by the investigator from the 
list below prior to the initiation of the study site and the treatment chosen for each subject enrolled in 
the study must be entered into the case report form.   Directions for dosage and reconstitution  should 
follow institutional standard of care, package inserts  (SPCs) , or the suggestions below based on the 
US package inserts  and the literature .  
Dacarbazine  100 mg/vial and 200 mg/vial are reconstituted with 9.9 mL and 19.7 mL , respectively , 
Sterile Water for Injection , USP . The resulting solution contains 10 mg/ mL of dacarbazine having a 
pH of 3.0 to 4.0. The calculated dose of the resulting solution is drawn into a syringe and 
administered only intravenously.  The reconstituted solution may be further diluted with 5% dextrose 
injection, or  sodium chloride injecti on (250 to 500 mL), and administered as an IVI over 90±15 
minutes.  
After reconstitution and prior to use, the solution in the vial may be stored  at 4°C for up to 72 hours or 
at normal room conditions (temperature and  light) for up to 8 hours. If the recons tituted solution is 
further diluted in  5% dextrose injection or sodium chloride injection, the resulting solution  may be 
stored at 4 °C for up to 24 hours or at normal room conditions for  up to 8 hours.  
Pazopanib  (Votrient®) 200 mg tablets can be stored at room temperature between 20° and 25°C; 
excursions are permitted between 15° and 30 °C. Tablets are taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after a 
meal and tablets are NOT to be crushed.  
Gemcitabine  200 mg or 1 g  lyophilized powder in a single use vial is reconstitu ted with 0.9% NaCl to 
a final concentration of ≤40 mg/mL and pH 2.7 to 3.3. The reconstituted solution may be further 
diluted with 0.9% NaCl and administered by IVI in <60 minutes. It is stable for up to 24 hours at 
controlled room temperature (20° to 25°C ) and should not be refrigerated.  
Docetaxel  80 mg/ 8 mL and 20 mg/ 2 mL is administered by IVI over approximately 60 minutes after 
dilution into a 250 to 500 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose solution to produce a 
final concentration of 0.3 to 0.74 mg/mL. Docetaxel final dilution for infusion should be administered 
within 4 hours of preparation. It can be stored between 2° and 25°C.  
Doxorubicin HCl  Injection is a sterile parenteral, isotonic available in 5 mL (10 mg), 10 mL (20 mg),  
25 mL (5 0 mg) single dose vials. Each mL contains doxorubicin HCl and the following inactive 
ingredients:   NaCl (0.9%) and water for injection q.s. Hydrochloric acid is used to adjust the pH to a 
target of pH of 3.0. The reconstituted solution is diluted in 0.9% N aCl or 5% dextrose and may be 
administered over 5 to 30 minutes.  
Ifosamide single -dose vials for constitution and administration by IVI each contain 1 gram or 3 grams 
of sterile ifosfamide , USP . Ifosfamide is a chemotherapeutic agent chemically related to the nitrogen 
mustards and a synthetic analog of cyclophosphamide. Injections are prepared for parenteral use by 
adding Sterile Water for Injection, USP , or Sterile Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP  (benzyl 
alcohol or parabens preserved) to the vial a nd shaking to dissolve. The reconstituted solution is 
diluted in 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose solution and may be administered over 2 to 4 hours.

Statistical Methods:  
In accordance with the intention -to-treat principle, all randomized subjects  will be evaluated for 
efficacy. All subjects  who receive  at least 1 dose of study medication  will be evaluated for safety.   
Efficacy:   
The primary analysis of PFS will be carried out  when approximately 191 PFS events have been 
observed  by the blinded Central Imaging Research Organization  (approximately 15 months following  
the completion of  enrollment of  400 subjects ). Survival distributions will be estimated using the 
Kaplan -Meier method and the two groups will be compared using a two -sided log rank test at the 
α=0.05 level of significance.  
An important secondary  endpoint is overall survival (OS). The analysis of OS will be considered 
confirmatory only if the PFS analysis is statistica lly significant. As a result, the nominal level of 
significance for the OS analysis will be α=0.05. However, because an interim analysis of OS will be 
carried out at the time of the analysis of PFS, the levels of significance for the interim and final 
analyses of OS will be α=0.00305 and α=0.049, respectively.  
The final ana lysis of OS will be completed when 320 OS events have occurred. Survival distributions 
will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and the two groups will be compared using a two -
sided log rank test at the α=0.049 level of significance. The same methodology will be used for the 
interim analysis, but at the α=0.00305 level of significance.  
Tumor response will be monitored  at screening , every 6 weeks from Cycle 1 -Day 1 through Week 30 , 
and then  every 12 weeks  until disease progression. The percentage of subjects with complete or 
PRs, or stable disease will be evaluated  and the disease control rate (CR, PR and SD  at 4 months) 
will be compared using Pearson’s chi -square test, or if 20% or m ore of the expected cell frequencies 
are <5, Fisher’s exact test. Patient reported outcomes as assessed by the EORTC Quality of Life 
Questionnaire will be analyzed using analysis of covariance.  
Sample Size Justification:  
Power calculations and subject numb ers were calculated based on the primary endpoint of PFS.  
Reviewing the literature for studies that have evaluated gemcitabine + docetaxel, pazopanib, 
ifosfamide and dacarbazine as treatment for patients that have relapsed or not responded to first line 
therapies, it is estimated that the median PFS for the investigator’s choice group will be 3.5 months 
and that the median PFS for the aldoxorubicin group will be 5.6 months.  Based on the use of a two -
sided log rank test at the α=0.05 level of significance, a total of 191 events will be required for 90% 
power to detect this difference.  Assuming an 18 month accrual period and a 15 month follow -up 
period after enrollment of the last subject, approximately 400 subjects will be needed to achieve the 
total of 191 events.  
Safety:  
The safety data will be summarized by treatment group.  The treatment groups will be compared with 
respect to occurrence of each AE. Total number of AEs leading to withdrawal, and abnormal 
laboratory tests  will be compared between groups using Fisher ’s exact test. AEs, ability to remain on 
assigned treatment (tolerability), and abnormal findings on physical examinations, vital signs, weight, 
ECG results, laboratory test results, and use of concomitant medic ations, will be assessed to 
characterize the safety profile of the treatment regimens. Descriptive statistics denoting the changes 
from baseline to the final assessment visit with respect to key laboratory parameters and vital signs 
will also be provided.

ALDOXORUBICIN-P3-STS-01 Phase of Development: 3 
 
Title of the Protocol:  
A Multicenter, Randomized, Open-Label Phase 3 Stud y to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of 
Aldoxorubicin Compared to Investigator’s Choice in  Subjects with Metastatic, Locally Advanced, or 
Unresectable Soft Tissue Sarcomas Who Either Rel apsed or Were Refractory to Prior Non-Adjuvant 
Chemotherapy 
Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of administration of aldoxorubicin 
compared to investigator’s choice of treatment in  subjects with metastat ic, locally advanced, or 
unresectable soft tissue sarcomas who have relapsed or were refractory to prior non-adjuvant chemotherapy, as measured by prog ression-free survival (PFS). 
Secondary Objectives:  
The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of aldoxorubicin as measured by OS, safety of aldoxorubicin compared to investi gator’s choice in this population assessed by the 
frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs ), abnormal findings on physical examination, 
laboratory tests, vital signs, echocardiogram (ECHO) evaluations, electrocardiogram (ECG) results, and weight, as well as disease control rate, and tumor response. 
Exploratory Objectives:  
To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of aldox orubicin, doxorubicin, and doxorubicinol following 
intravenous (IV) administration of aldoxorubicin, and to evaluate the exposure-response relationships 
between aldoxorubicin, doxorubicin, and/or doxorubicinol and PFS, OS, selected safety parameters, 
and quality of life. 
Study Rationale and Significance: Aldoxorubicin (INNO-206; DOXO-EMCH) is a novel prodrug that binds covalently to circulating 
albumin. The drug is accumulated in tumors and doxorubicin is released in the tumor by cleaving the acid labile linker (EMCH) in the low pH tumor environment. This carrier-linked prodrug has 
demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity with reduced toxicity in several murine models when compared with free doxorubicin. 
Patients with metastatic, locally advanced, or unres ectable soft tissue sarcomas who have failed prior 
chemotherapies have a poor prognosis with PF S of around 2-4.6 months and median OS of 
approximately 9-12 months. Several chemother apy regimens have been explored as palliative 
therapy for subjects with these patients and include such agents as ifosfamide, gemcitabine, 
docetaxel, vinorelbine, dacarbazine, temozolomide,  epirubicin, pazopanib and liposomal doxorubicin. 
However, these regimens can be quite toxic and ha ve not significantly impacted either progression-
free or OS in these individuals. Pazopanib, rece ntly approved in the US and Europe, does appear to 
extend PFS in soft tissue sarcoma patients (except liposarcomas) who have relapsed after receiving 
prior chemotherapy compared to no treatment, but does not increase OS. Aldoxorubicin may improve 
upon the activity of doxorubicin without an increase  in toxicity as has been demonstrated in animal 
studies.

ALDOXORUBICIN-P3-STS-01 Phase of Development: 3 
 
Study Design and Methodology: 
This is a phase 3 open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of aldoxorubicin administered at 350 
mg/m2 (260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent) intravenously on Day 1 every 21 days until tumor progression 
or unacceptable toxicity occurs compared to investigator’s choice of treatment among  5 different therapies. These therapies include (dosages should follow the institutional standard of care, package insert (SPCs), or the following suggestions based on the US package inserts and the literature):  
1) dacarbazine administered at 1000 mg/m
2 by intravenous infusion (IVI), over 90±15 minutes on Day 1 
every 21 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs; 2) pazopanib, 800 mg orally each 
day until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs; 3) gemcitabine, 900 mg/m2 by IVI in less than 
60 minutes on Days 1 and 8, plus docetaxel, 100 mg/m2 by IVI over 1 hour on Day 8 of a 21 day cycle until 
tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs; 4) doxorubicin, 75 mg/m2 by IVI over 5 to 30 minutes 
every 21 days for a maximum cumulative dose of 550 mg/m2 or unacceptable toxicity occurs; or 5) 
ifosfamide 2.0 g/m2 administered over 2 to 4 hours on Days 1-4 of a 21 day cycle + mesna per standard 
site administration regimen until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. The investigative site 
must pre-specify  their choice of treatments for the comparator arm to be used at their site, and no more 
than 3 treatment regimens may be selected for the comparator arm at each site which must be selected prior  to the study site initiation visit. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either aldoxorubicin or 
investigator’s choice of up to 3 control regimens pre-selected by the study site. Treatment with G-CSF 
should be administered to all subjects as per investigator’s clinical judgment or according to ASCO 
Guidelines (Appendix E). Note:  aldoxorubicin has been associated with >20% incidence of grade 3 
or 4 neutropenia. Therefore, the administration of G-CSF should occur even during Cycle 1.  
All Screening requirements, including an ECHO exam, must be completed within 28 days of the  
Cycle 1-Day 1 visit. Subjects receiving aldoxorubicin, ifosfamide, dacarbazine or doxorubicin will  visit the study site on Day 1 of each cycle. They will have complete blood counts (CBC) and serum chemistries on Day 15 and Day 21 (if Day 21 does not correspond to Day 1 of the next cycle,  ±3 days) of each cycle as well. Subjects receiving pazopanib will visit the study site on Day 1 of their next cycle for monitoring, testing (same as for Day 1 for other treatment regimens) and to receive a new supply of study drug. Subjects receiving pazopanib will also have CBC and serum chemistry on Day 15 and Day 28 (if Day 28 does not correspond to Day 1 of the next cycle, ±2 days). Subjects receiving gemcitabine plus docetaxel will visit the study site on both days of their infusions (Days 1 and 8) and at Days 15 and 21 of each cycle. Safety monitoring, including AEs, a directed physical examination, laboratory evaluations (serum chemistry, CBC, and urinalysis), vital signs , weight measurements, Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) and ECGs will be performed on Day 1 (for all subjects) of each cycle. Subjects receiving aldoxorubicin will have blood drawn for serum electrolytes to evaluate the anion gap prior to each drug administration. Cardiac function will also be followed periodically (per Schedule of Treatment and Evaluations in Appendix A) with ECHOs for subjects receiving either aldoxorubicin or 
doxorubicin. Treatment will continue until tumor progression is observed, a maximum cumulative dose of 550 mg/m
2 is reached (doxorubicin), subject asks to withdraw, unacceptable toxicity occurs, a change in 
therapy would be in the best interest of the subject, subject becomes pregnant or fails to use adequate birth control, need for any treatment not allowed by the protocol, or subject is non-compliant with study requirements. 
Tumor response will be monitored at screening, every 6 weeks from Cycle 1-Day 1 through Week 30, and 
then every 12 weeks until disease progression using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.
[50] OS, PFS, and PFS at 4 and 6 months will be evaluated. Objective overall 
response rate (ORR) (complete and partial responses [PRs]), disease control rate (objective responses plus stable disease at 4 months) and quality of life will be assessed.  
The PK of aldoxorubicin, doxorubicin, and doxorubicinol will be evaluated using a sparse sample analysis. 
Plasma samples will be collected at Cycle 1 at the following time points: the end of the infusion, between 1.5 and 4 hours from the end of the infusion, and on Days 2, and 3. If necessary and possible, PK samples may be collected at a later cycle.

Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration: Aldoxorubicin: Lyophilized powder in vials that c ontain 200 mg of aldoxorubicin reconstituted by 
adding a solution of 50% ethanol: 50% sterile water,  administration completed within 2 hours (of 
being reconstituted) as a 30-minute IVI Lacta ted Ringer’s solution. Total dose of 350 mg/m2  
(260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent). Aldoxorubicin in fusion may exceed 30 minutes if deemed 
necessary by the investigative si te but the total time from the completion of reconstitution of 
aldoxorubicin to completion of infusion must not be more than 2 hours. 
Investigator’s Choice: Up to three treatment regimens  are to be chosen by the investigator from the 
list below prior to the initiation of the study site and the treatment chosen for each subject enrolled in 
the study must be entered into the case report form.  Directions for dosage and reconstitution should 
follow institutional standard of care, package inse rts (SPCs), or the suggestions below based on the 
US package inserts an d the literature.  
Dacarbazine 100 mg/vial and 200 mg/vial are reconstituted with 9.9 mL and 19.7 mL, respectively, 
Sterile Water for Injection, USP. The resulting so lution contains 10 mg/mL of dacarbazine having a 
pH of 3.0 to 4.0. The calculated dose of t he resulting solution is drawn into a syringe and 
administered only intravenously. The reconstituted solution may be further diluted with 5% dextrose 
injection, or sodium chloride injection (250 to 500 mL), and administered as an IVI over 90±15 
minutes. 
After reconstitution and prior to use, the solution in the vial may be stored at 4°C for up to 72 hours or 
at normal room conditions (temperature and light) for up to 8 hours. If the reconstituted solution is 
further diluted in 5% dextrose injection or sodium  chloride injection, the resulting solution may be 
stored at 4°C for up to 24 hours or at normal room conditions for up to 8 hours. 
Pazopanib (Votrient®) 200 mg tablets can be stored at room temperature between 20° and 25°C; 
excursions are permitted between 15° and 30°C. Tabl ets are taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after a 
meal and tablets are NOT to be crushed. Gemcitabine 200 mg or 1 g lyophilized powder in a single use vial is reconstituted with 0.9% NaCl to 
a final concentration of ≤ 40 mg/mL and pH 2.7 to 3.3. The reconstituted solution may be further 
diluted with 0.9% NaCl and administered by IVI in <60 minutes. It is stable for up to 24 hours at 
controlled room temperature (20° to 25°C) and should not be refrigerated. 
Docetaxel 80 mg/8 mL and 20 mg/2 mL is administered by IVI over approximately 60 minutes after 
dilution into a 250 to 500 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose solution to produce a 
final concentration of 0.3 to 0.74 mg/mL. Docetaxel final dilution for infusion should be administered 
within 4 hours of preparation. It can be stored between 2° and 25°C. 
Doxorubicin HCl Injection is a sterile parenteral, isot onic available in 5 mL (10 mg), 10 mL (20 mg),  
25 mL (50 mg) single dose vials. Each mL cont ains doxorubicin HCl and the following inactive 
ingredients:  NaCl (0.9%) and water for injection q.s. Hydrochloric acid is used to adjust the pH to a target of pH of 3.0. The reconstituted solution is diluted in 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose and may be 
administered over 5 to 30 minutes. 
Ifosamide single-dose vials for constitution and admini stration by IVI each contain 1 gram or 3 grams 
of sterile ifosfamide, USP. Ifosfamide is a chemot herapeutic agent chemically related to the nitrogen 
mustards and a synthetic analog of cyclophosphami de. Injections are prepared for parenteral use by 
adding Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or Sterile Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP (benzyl 
alcohol or parabens preserved) to the vial and sh aking to dissolve. The reconstituted solution is 
diluted in 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose solution and may be administered over 2 to 4 hours. 
See Section 5.2 for additional investigator’s choice treatment concentrations and preparation 
instructions as per package inserts.

Statistical Methods: In accordance with the intenti on-to-treat principle, all random ized subjects will be evaluated for 
efficacy. All subjects who receive at least 1 dos e of study medication will be evaluated for safety.  
Efficacy:  The primary analysis of PFS will be carried out when approximately 191 PFS events have been 
observed by the blinded Central Imaging Research Organization (approximately 15 months following 
the completion of enrollment of 400 subjects). Su rvival distributions will be estimated using the 
Kaplan-Meier method and the two groups will be com pared using a two-sided log rank test at the 
α=0.05 level of significance. 
An important secondary endpoint is overall surviv al (OS). The analysis of OS will be considered 
confirmatory only if the PFS analysis is statistica lly significant. As a result, the nominal level of 
significance for the OS analysis will be α=0.05. However, because an in terim analysis of OS will be 
carried out at the time of the analysis of PFS, t he levels of significance for the interim and final 
analyses of OS will be α =0.00305 and α=0.049, respectively. 
The final analysis of OS will be completed when 320 OS events have occurred. Survival distributions 
will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the two groups will be compared using a two-
sided log rank test at the α=0.049 level of significance. The same methodology will be used for the 
interim analysis, but at the α=0.00305 level of significance. 
Tumor response will be monitored at screening, ev ery 6 weeks from Cycle 1-Day 1 through Week 30, 
and then every 12 weeks until disease progression. T he percentage of subjects with complete or 
PRs, or stable disease will be evaluated and the disease control rate (CR, PR and SD at 4 months) will be compared using Pearson’s chi-square test, or if 20% or more of the expected cell frequencies 
are <5, Fisher’s exact test. Patient reported outco mes as assessed by the EORTC Quality of Life 
Questionnaire will be analyzed us ing analysis of covariance. 
Sample Size Justification: 
Power calculations and subject numbers were calculated based on the primary endpoint of PFS.  
Reviewing the literature for studies that hav e evaluated gemcitabine + docetaxel, pazopanib, 
ifosfamide and dacarbazine as treatment for patients that have relapsed or not responded to first line 
therapies, it is estimated that the median PFS for the investigator’s choice  group will be 3.5 months 
and that the median PFS for the aldoxorubicin group will be 5.6 months.  Based on the use of a two-
sided log rank test at the α=0.05 level of significance, a total of 191 events will be required for 90% 
power to detect this difference.  Assuming an 18 month accrual period and a 15 month follow-up 
period after enrollment of the last subject, approximately 400 subjects will be needed to achieve the total of 191 events. 
Safety:  
The safety data will be summarized by treatment group. The treatment groups will be compared with 
respect to occurrence of each AE. Total numbe r of AEs leading to withdrawal, and abnormal 
laboratory tests will be compared between groups us ing Fisher’s exact test. AEs, ability to remain on 
assigned treatment (tolerability), and abnormal findings on physical examinations, vital signs, weight, 
ECG results, laboratory test results, and use of  concomitant medications, will be assessed to 
characterize the safety profile of the treatment r egimens. Descriptive statis tics denoting the changes 
from baseline to the final assessment visit with respect to key laboratory parameters and vital signs will also be provided.

Pharmacokinetics:  All subjects who receive aldoxorubicin and provide at least one PK sample with concentrations above the limit of quantification will be included in the PK analysis. Sparse plasma aldoxorubicin, 
doxorubicin, and doxorubicinol concentration data will be analyzed, and aldoxor ubicin, doxorubicin, 
and doxorubicinol PK parameters will be estimated based on a population PK analysis. PK parameters will be summarized us ing descriptive statistics. 
Exploratory exposure-response/ex posure-safety analyses will be conducted using the primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints, PFS and OS, and for selected AEs.

Title of the Protocol :  
A Multicenter, Randomi zed, Open -Label Phase 3 Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safet y of 
Aldoxorubicin  Compared to Investigator’s Choice  in Subjects with Metastatic, Locally Advanced, or 
Unresectable Soft Tissue Sarcomas Who Either Relapsed or Were Refractory to Prior Non -Adjuvant 
Chemotherapy  
Primary Objective:  
The primary objective  of this study is to determine the effica cy of administration of aldoxorubicin  
compared to investigator’s choice of treatment in subjects with metastatic , locally advanced,  or 
unresectable soft  tissue sarcoma s who have relapsed or were refractory to prior non -adjuvant 
chemotherapy, as measured by  progression -free survival  (PFS) . 
Secondary Objective s: 
The secondary objective s of this study are to evaluate the  efficacy of aldoxorubicin as measured  by 
overall survival  (OS), overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (ORR + SD at 4 months),  
PFS at 4 and 6 months, safety of aldoxorubicin  compared to investigator’s choice in this population 
assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse event s (AEs), abnormal findings on physical 
examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, echocardiogram  (ECHO) evaluations, electrocardiogram  
(ECG ) results , and weight . 
Exploratory  Objective s: 
To determine the  sparse  pharmacokinetics (PK) of aldoxorubicin, doxor ubicin, and doxorubicinol 
following intravenous (IV) administration of aldoxorubicin, and to evaluate the exposure -response 
relationships between aldoxorubicin, doxorubicin, and/or doxorubicinol and PFS, OS, selected safety 
parameters , and quality of life  (EORTC QLQ -C30) . 
Study Rational e and Significance:  
Aldoxorubicin ( INNO -206; DOXO -EMCH)  is a novel prodrug that binds covalently to circulating 
albumin. The drug is accumulated in tumors and doxorubicin is released in the tumor by cleaving the 
acid labile linker (EMCH) in the low pH tumor environment.  This carrier -linked prodrug  has 
demonstrated enhanced anti tumor activity with reduced toxicity in several murine models when 
compared with free doxorubicin.  
Patients with m etastatic,  locally advanced, or  unres ectable soft tissue sarcomas who have failed prior 
chemotherapies  have a poor prognosis with PFS of around 2-4.6 months and median OS of 
approximately 9-12 months.  Several chemotherapy regimens have been explored as palliative 
therapy for subject s with these patients and include such agents as ifosfamide, gemcitabine, 
docetaxel, vinorelbine, dacarbazine, temozolomide , epirubicin , pazopanib and liposomal doxorubicin. 
However, these regimens  can be quite toxic  and have not significantly  impacted  either progre ssion-
free or OS in these individuals. Pazopanib , recently approved in the US  and Europe , does appear to 
extend PFS in soft tissue sarcoma  patients (except liposarcomas ) who have relapsed after receiving 
prior chemotherapy  compared to no treatment , but doe s not increase OS. Aldoxorubicin  may improve  
upon  the activity of doxorubicin without an increase in  toxicity as has been demonstrated in animal 
studies.

mg/m2 (260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent) intravenously on Day 1 every 21 days  until tumor progression 
or unacceptable toxicity occurs  compared to investigator’s choice of treatment  among  
5 different therapies . These the rapies include  (dosages should follow the institutional standard of care, 
package  insert  (SPCs) , or the following suggestions  based on the US package inserts  and the literature ):  
1) dacarbazine administered at 1000 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion ( IVI), ove r 90±15 minutes on Day 1 
every 21 days  until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs ; 2) pazopanib, 800 mg orally each 
day until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs; 3) gemcitabine, 900 mg/m2 by IVI in less than 
60 minutes on Days 1  and 8, plus docetaxel, 100 mg/m2 by IVI over 1 hour on Day 8 of a 21 day cycle until 
tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs ; 4) doxorubicin, 75 mg/m2 by IVI over 5 to 30 minutes 
every 21 days for a maximum cumulative dose of 550 mg/m2 or unacce ptable toxicity occurs ; or 5) 
ifosfamide 2.0 g/m2 administered over 2 to 4 hours on Days 1 -4 of a 21 day cycle + mesna per standard 
site administration regimen until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs . The investigative site 
must pre-specify  their choice of treatments for the comparator arm to be used at thei r site, and no more 
than 3 treatment regimens may be selected for the comparator arm at each site  which  must be selected 
prior  to the study site initiation visit . Subjects will be randomi zed 1:1 to receive eithe r aldoxorubicin  or 
investigator ’s choice of up to 3 control regimens  pre-selected by the study site . Treatment with G -CSF 
should be administered  to all subjects as per investigator’s clinical judgment or according to ASCO 
Guidelines  (Appendix E).  Note:  aldoxorubicin has been associated with >20% incidence of grade 3 
or 4 neutropenia. Therefore, the administration of G -CSF should occur  even during Cycle 1.  
All Screening requirements, including an ECHO exam, must be completed within 2 8 days of the  
Cycle 1 -Day 1 visit . Subjects receiving aldoxorubicin, ifosfamide, dacarbazine  or doxorubicin will  
visit the study site on Day 1 of each cycle . They will have complete blood counts  (CBC) and serum 
chemistries  on Day 15 and Day 21 (if Day 21  does not correspond to Day 1 of the next cycle,  
±3 days ) of each cycle as well.  Subjects receiving pazopanib will vis it the study site on Day 1 of their next 
cycle  for monitoring , testing (same as for Day 1 for other treatment regimens)  and to receive a new supply 
of study drug.  Subjects receiving pazopanib will also have CBC and serum chemistry on Day 15 and Day 
28 (if Day 28 does not correspond to Day 1 of the next cycle , ±2 days).  Subjects receiving gemcitabine 
plus docetaxel will visit the study site on both days of their infusions (Day s 1 and 8 ) and at Day s 15 and  21 
of each cycle. Safety monitoring, including AEs, a directed physical examination, laboratory evaluations 
(serum chemistry, CBC, and urinalysis), vital signs, weight measurements, Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group ( ECOG ) performance status (PS) and ECGs will be performed on Day 1  (for all subjects) of each 
cycle.  Subjects receiving aldoxorubicin will have blood drawn for serum electro lytes to evaluate the anion 
gap prior to each drug admin istration. Cardiac function will also be followed periodically  (per Schedule of 
Treatment and Evaluations  in Appendix A ) with ECHOs  for subjects receiving either aldoxorubicin or 
doxorubicin . Treatment will continue until tumor progression is observed,  a maximum cumulative dose of 
550 mg/m2 is reached (doxorubicin) , subject asks to withdraw, unacceptable toxicity occurs , a change in 
therapy would be in the best interest of the subject, subject becomes pregnant or fails to use adequate 
birth control, need fo r any treatment not allowed by the protocol, or subject is non -compliant with study 
requirements.  
Tumor response will be monitored at screening , every 6 weeks from Cycle 1 -Day 1 through Week 30 , and 
then every 12 weeks  until disease progression using the R esponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) 1.1 criteria .[50] OS, PFS,  and PFS at 4 and 6 months  will be evaluated . Objective overall 
response rate (ORR) (complete and partial responses  [PRs] ), disease control rate (objective responses 
plus stable  disease at 4 months) and quality of life will be assessed.  
The PK of aldoxorubicin, doxorubicin, and doxorubicinol will be evaluated using a sparse sample analysis. 
Plasma samples will be collected from subjects receiving aldoxorubicin at Cycle 1 at the following time 
points: the end of the infusion, between 1.5 and 4 hours from the end of the infusion, and on Days 2, and 3. 
If necessary and possible, PK samples may be collected at a later cycle  along with collecting a predose 
blood sample .

ALDOXORUBICIN -P3-STS-01 Phase of Development: 3 
 
Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration:  
Aldoxorubicin : Lyophilized powder in vials that contain 200 mg of aldoxorubicin  reconstituted by  
adding a solution of 50% ethanol: 50% sterile water , administration completed  within 2 h ours (of 
being reconstituted)  as a 30 -minute IVI Lactated Ringer’s solution . Total dose of 350 mg/m2  
(260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent).  Aldoxorubicin infusion may excee d 30 minutes if deemed 
necessary by the investigative site but the total time from the completion of  reconstitution of 
aldoxorubicin to completion of infusion must  not be more than 2 hours.  
Investigator’s Choice : Up to three treatment regimens are to be ch osen by the investigator from the 
list below  prior to the initiation of the study site and the treatment chosen for each subject enrolled in 
the study must be entered into the case report form.   Directions for dosage and reconstitution  should 
follow institutional standard of care, package inserts  (SPCs) , or the suggestions below based on the 
US package inserts  and the literature .  
Dacarbazine  100 mg/vial and 200 mg/vial are reconstituted with 9.9 mL and 19.7 mL , respectively , 
Sterile Water for Injection , USP. The resulting solution contains 10 mg/mL of dacarbazine having a 
pH of 3.0 to 4.0. The calculated dose of the resulting solution is drawn into a syringe and 
administered only intravenously.  The reconstituted solution may be further diluted with 5% dextr ose 
injection, or  sodium chloride injection (250 to 500 mL), and administered as an IVI over 90±15 
minutes.  
After reconstitution and prior to use, the solution in the vial may be stored  at 4°C for up to 72 hours or 
at normal room conditions (temperature an d light) for up to 8 hours. If the reconstituted solution is 
further diluted in  5% dextrose injection or sodium chloride injection, the resulting solution  may be 
stored at 4 °C for up to 24 hours or at normal room conditions for  up to 8 hours.  
Pazopanib  (Votrient®) 200 mg tablets can be stored at room temperature between 20° and 25°C; 
excursions are permitted between 15° and 30 °C. Tablets are taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after a 
meal and tablets are NOT to be crushed.  
Gemcitabine  200 mg or 1 g  lyophilized powder in a single use vial is reconstituted with 0.9% NaCl to 
a final concentration of ≤40 mg/mL and pH 2.7 to 3.3. The reconstituted solution may be further 
diluted with 0.9% NaCl and administered by IVI in <60 minutes. It is stable for up to 24 hours at  
controlled room temperature (20° to 25°C) and should not be refrigerated.  
Docetaxel  80 mg/ 8 mL and 20 mg/ 2 mL is administered by IVI over approximately 60 minutes after 
dilution into a 250 to 500 mL infusion bag of either 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose solution  to produce a 
final concentration of 0.3 to 0.74 mg/mL. Docetaxel final dilution for infusion should be administered 
within 4 hours of preparation. It can be stored between 2° and 25°C.  
Doxorubicin HCl  Injection is a sterile parenteral, isotonic available in 5 mL (10 mg), 10 mL (20 mg),  
25 mL (50 mg) single dose vials. Each mL contains doxorubicin HCl and the following inactive 
ingredients:   NaCl (0.9%) and water for injection q.s. Hydrochloric acid is used to adjust the pH to a 
target of pH of 3.0. The re constituted solution is diluted in 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose and may be 
administered over 5 to 30 minutes.  
Ifosamide single -dose vials for constitution and administration by IVI each contain 1 gram or 3 grams 
of sterile ifosfamide , USP . Ifosfamide is a chem otherapeutic agent chemically related to the nitrogen 
mustards and a synthetic analog of cyclophosphamide. Injections are prepared for parenteral use by 
adding Sterile Water for Injection, USP , or Sterile Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP  (benzyl 
alcohol or parabens preserved) to the vial and shaking to dissolve. The reconstituted solution is 
diluted in 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose solution and may be administered over 2 to 4 hours.  
See Section 5.2 for additional investigator’s choice treatment concentrat ions and preparation 
instructions as per package inserts.

Statistical Methods:  
In accordance with the intention -to-treat principle, all randomized subjects  will be evaluated for 
efficacy. All subjects  who receive  at least 1 dose of study medication  will be evaluated fo r safety.   
Efficacy:   
The primary analysis of PFS will be carried out when approximately 191 PFS events have been 
observed  by the blinded Central Imaging Research Organization  (approximately 15 months following  
the completion of  enrollment of  400 subjects ). Survival distributions will be estimated using the 
Kaplan -Meier method and the two groups will be compared using a two -sided unstratified log rank 
test at the α=0.05 level of significance.  
An important secondary  endpoint is overall survival (OS). The ana lysis of OS will be considered 
confirmatory only if the PFS analysis is statistically significant. As a result, the nominal level of 
significance for the OS analysis will be α=0.05. However, because an interim analysis of OS will be 
carried out at the time  of the analysis of PFS, the levels of significance for the interim and final 
analyses of OS will be α=0.00305 and α=0.049, respectively.  
The final ana lysis of OS will be completed when 320 OS events have occurred. Survival distributions 
will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and the two groups will be compared using a two -
sided unstratified log rank test at the α=0.049 level of significance. The same methodology will be 
used for the interim analysis, but at the α=0.00305 level of significance.  
Tumor response will be monitored  at screening , every 6 weeks from Cycle 1 -Day 1 through Week 30 , 
and then  every 12 weeks  until disease progression. The percentage of subjects with complete or 
PRs, or stable disease will be evaluated  and the disease control ra te (CR, PR and SD  at 4 months) 
will be compared using Pearson’s chi -square test, or if 20% or more of the expected cell frequencies 
are <5, Fisher’s exact test. Patient reported outcomes as assessed by the EORTC Quality of Life 
Questionnaire will be analyz ed using analysis of covariance.  
Sample Size Justification:  
Power calculations and subject numbers were calculated based on the primary endpoint of PFS.  
Reviewing the literature for studies that have evaluated gemcitabine + docetaxel, pazopanib, 
ifosfamid e and dacarbazine as treatment for patients that have relapsed or not responded to first line 
therapies, it is estimated that the median PFS for the investigator’s choice group will be 3.5 months 
and that the median PFS for the aldoxorubicin group will be 5.6 months.  Based on the use of a two -
sided log rank test at the α=0.05 level of significance, a total of 191 events will be required for 90% 
power to detect this difference.  Assuming an 18 month accrual period and a 15 month follow -up 
period after enrol lment of the last subject, approximately 400 subjects will be needed to achieve the 
total of 191 events.  
Safety:  
The safety data will be summarized by treatment group.  The treatment groups will be compared with 
respect to occurrence of each AE. Total numb er of AEs leading to withdrawal, and abnormal 
laboratory tests will be compared between groups using Fisher ’s exact test. AEs, ability to remain on 
assigned treatment (tolerability), and abnormal findings on physical examinations, vital signs, weight, 
ECG results, laboratory test results, and use of concomitant medications, will be assessed to 
characterize the safety profile of the treatment regimens. Descriptive statistics denoting the changes 
from baseline to the final assessment visit with respect to key  laboratory parameters and vital signs 
will also be provided.

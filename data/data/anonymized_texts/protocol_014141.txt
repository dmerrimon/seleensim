•Immunotherapeutic agents produce atypical clinical response patterns, 
which are not usually observed in conventional chemotherapy. Tw o 
distinct non-conventional patterns have been reported: 1) a red uction in 
total tumor burden despite of the appearance of new lesion(s), and 2) 
responses after a transit increase in total tumor burden in an initial phase, followed by subsequent tumor shrinkage. Therefore, it is important to avoid premature discontinuation of the study drug as 
nivolumab might induce non-conventional response patterns in so me 
patients. Under the current discontinuation criteria (Section 3 .5), 
subjects must stop the study drug when investigator assessment determines disease progression using the 2007 IWG criteria. The change in this amendment will permit the subjects to continue on the s tudy drug 
beyond investigator-assessed disease progression in certain case s.
•Exclusion criteria of history of severe hypersensitivity reacti on to any 
monoclonal antibody is reworded to allow for subjects who experienced Grade 3 – 4 infusion-related reaction with the first dose of rit uximab, 
but who were able to receive subsequent rituximab without recur rence 
of Grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reaction to be eligible.
•A clarification note is being added with regard to disease response evaluation.
•A section is introducing guidelines for assessment and initial management of tumor lysis syndrome.
•A few editorial or administrative corrections.

OVERALL RATIONALE FOR REVISED PROTOCOL 04C:
The purpose of this revision is to allow subjects in Cohorts A, B, and C to have access to a more 
convenient dosing schedule, 480 mg (flat dose) every 4 weeks, b ased on feedback from 
investigators. Also, to simpli fy the dosing regimen, those subj ects that prefer to remain on an every 
2-week dosing schedule, a switch to 240 mg (flat dose) will be required.
Revisions apply to all participants currently enrolled.

SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA209205
Protocol Title: Non-Comparative, Multi-Cohort, Single Arm, Open-Label, Phase 2 Study of Nivolumab 
(BMS-936558) in classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) Subjects
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Du ration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s): Nivolumab (BMS-936558) administered  IV over 60 minutes at 3 mg/ kg (Cohorts A, B and C) or flat 
dose 240 mg over 30 minutes IV infusion (Cohort D) every 2 weeks until progression or un acceptable toxicity. In 
revised protocol 04c , subjects in Cohorts A, B, and C will switch to IV infusion ov er 30 minutes of nivolumab 
480 mg flat dose every 4 weeks or 240 mg flat dose every 2 weeks u ntil progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Study Phase: 2b
Research Hypothesis:
Cohorts A, B, and C: Treatment with  nivolumab will lead to clini cal benefit, as demonstrated by a clinically 
meaningful objective response r ate, including durable res ponses with substantial magnitude of tumor burden 
reduction in the heavily treated cHL subjects.Cohort D: A new regimen, consisting of nivolumab monotherapy fol lowed by the combination of nivolumab and 
chemotherapy (AVD; a combination of doxorubicin, vinblastine an d dacarbazine), will be safe and tolerable in 
previously untreated cHL subjects with newly diagnosed advanced stage (Stage IIB, III and IV) disease.
Primary Objective:
Cohorts A, B, and C: To assess the clinical benefit of nivolumab, as measured by objective response rate (ORR) 
based on independent radiologic review committee (IRRC) assessment, and defined as proportion of subjects 
achieving either a partial remission (PR) or complete remission (CR) according to the revised International Working Group criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (2007 IWG criteria).
Cohort D: To assess the overall safety and tolerability of nivol umab monotherapy (f lat dose 240 mg), followed by 
the combination of nivolumab and doxorubicin, vinblastine and d acarbazine (AVD) chemotherapy in previously 
untreated cHL subjects who are newly diagnosed with advanced st age (Stage IIB, III and IV) disease , as measured 
by the proportion of subjects who experienced at least one trea tment-related Grade 3 - 5 AEs with an onset date after 
or on the first dose date and no later than 30 days after the last study dose date, among subjects receiving at least one 
dose of study treatment.
Secondary Objectives: 
Cohorts A, B, and C
•To assess the duration of objective response (DOR) based on IRRC  assessments
•To assess the CR rate and the duration of CR based on IRRC assessment
•To assess the PR rate and the duration of PR based on IRRC assessment

Study Design:
Cohorts A, B, and C
This is a non-comparative, parallel cohort, single-arm Phase 2 study in cHL subjects ≥18 years old who failed 
autologous stem cell transplant (ASC T). Subjects can be brentux imab vedotin-naïve (Cohort A), or can have prior
brentuximab vedotin treatment as a salvage therapy after failur e of ASCT (Cohort B). In addition to Cohorts A and 
B, a third cohort (Cohort C) is being added to the study with bro ader eligibility criteria. Subjects with a treatment

history of brentuximab vedotin before first ASCT will not be el igible, except in Cohort C. The original protocol 
requires nivolumab dosing 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Approximately 220 subjects with failure after ASCT will be 
treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity, consisting of approximately 60 subjects f or Cohorts A and B respectiv ely, and approximately 
100 subjects for Cohort C. In revised protocol 04c , subjects will switch to IV infusion over 30 minutes of 
nivolumab 480 mg flat dose every 4 weeks (Q4W) or 240 mg flat do se every 2 weeks (Q2W). For those subjects 
receiving a 480 mg flat dose Q4W, a cy cle w ill be a 28-dosing period. For those subjects receiving a 240 m g flat 
dose Q2W, a cycle will be a 14-day dosing period. Subjects will  be independently enrolled for each cohort. If one of 
these cohorts complete enrollment earlier, the other cohorts wil l remain open until complete accrual is reached. 
Once a new dosing regimen has been selected for the subject, ei ther flat dose 280 mg Q2W or f lat dose 480 mg 
Q4W, the dosing regimen will remain in effect until the end of treatment and not change. Pr imary analysis will be 
performed separately for each cohort (ie, at separate time point s) upon completion of a pre-specified amount of 
follow-up after last patient first treatment (LPFT). All analyse s will be performed sep arately for each cohort upon 
completion of follow-up for the primary endpoint in each cohort. In addition safety analyse s will be performed on
combined cohorts.
Subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligib ility withi n 28 days prior to fir st dose. Subjects may 
be dosed no less than 12 days from the previous dose during eve ry 2-week cycle. For every 4-week dosing cycle, 
subjects may be dosed within a ± 3-day window.
Cohort D
Cohort D is a non-compar ative single-arm cohort in subjects ≥18 years old who have newly diagnosed, previously 
untreated cHL with advanced stage (Stage IIB, III and IV) diseas e. Cohort D consists of a pproximately 50 s ubjects.
Subjects will undergo s creening evaluations to determine eligib ility within 28 days prior to first dose. Sub jects will 
be enrolled independently from other cohorts. Treatment for Cohort D consists of two phases: monotherapy and combination phases. Subjects will be treated with 
four doses of nivolumab flat dose 240 mg IV every 2 weeks (two months of monotherapy phase), followed by 
twelve doses of the combination of AVD chemotherapy and nivolum ab flat dose 240 mg IV for 6 cycles (six months 
of combination phase). The primary analysis for Cohort D will be  conducted when all treated sub jects from  Cohort 
D have completed Follow-up visit 1 and end-of-therapy response assessment. All analyses for Cohort D will be 
performed separately from other cohorts.

Week 9 ( ±7 days) after the start of th erapy and the n at Weeks 17, 25, 37 and 49 during the first year of treatment,
then every 16 weeks (± 14 days) for the second year of treatment up to Week 97, continuing every 26 weeks ( ±21 
days) beyond Week 97 for the third year or beyond treatment, unt il disease progression is documented. A FDG-PET 
scan is required at scr eening, Weeks 17 and 25 in all subjects, and at Week 49 for subjects who do not have two 
consecutive negative FDG-PET scans after Week 1 and prior to We ek 49, and to confirm CR.
Cohort C subjects who have persistent CR for one year will disc ontinue study treatment and have a specific 
follow-up schedule. Should those subjects relapse, they will ha ve the possibility to re-initiate treatment.

1 INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a lymphoid malignancy characterized by  the presence of 
multinucleated Reed-Sternberg cells, which are generally accept ed to be of B-cell origin and 
usually account  for only 1% t o 10% of the cells in the tum or tissue. The majority of c ells in HL 
tumor tissue are a mixed infiltrate of various lymphoid cells, including regulatory T-cells and 
macrophages.1The updated 2008 WHO classification recognizes tw o histologic groups: nodular 
lymphocyte predominant, which accounts for about 5% of all HL c ases and “classical” HL (cHL) 
which accounts for the remainder. In cHL, four subgroups are ide ntified: nodular sclerosis (75% 
to 80% of cases), mixed cellularity, lymphocyte depletion, and lymphocyte rich.2Importantly, 
Epstein-Barr (EB) virus may play both an etiologic and pathogen etic role in about 40% of cHL 
(usually in mixed cellularity and lymphocyte depleted HL), wher e three predominant viral 
proteins are typically expressed potentially contributing to dy sregulated HL growth.3
In 2013, the National Cancer Institute estimated that 9,290 men  and women would be diagnosed 
with HL and 1,180 would die of HL.4The prevalence of HL in the US in 2013 was estimated to 
be 181,928. The median age of diagnosis of HL in the US is 38 y ears; there is a bimodal 
age-specific incidence pattern, in which the incidence is highe st between 15 and 34 years, 
declines between ages 35 and 54, and increases again after 55 y ears.
The treatment of l imited-stage HL has improved significantly since the a doption of combined 
modality therapy, with treatment failure occ urring in approximately 10% of patients.5However, 
approximately 30% of patients presenti ng wit h newly diagnosed HL have advanced stage disease 
(Stages IIB - IV). Improvements in the use of combined chemother apy and radiotherapy in 
advanced stage newly diagnosed HL have resulted in durable remi ssion rates of approximately 
60% to 80%.6However, there continues to be a significant opportunity for impr ovement in 
treatment of HL, including the frontline setting for patients wi th advanced-stage disease.6,7,8
Although multiagent chemotherapy regimens such as doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and 
dacarbazine (ABVD) have been established as standard initial th erapy for advanced-stage 
cHL,9,10,11an Eastern Cooperative On cology Group (ECOG) st udy showed ABVD reg imen 
provided 71% and 67% 3-year and 5-year failure-free survival ra tes, respectively.12This is 
particularly important considering young patient population,13and when compared to the 
excellent long-term disease control for limited-stage cHL (over  90%).5
More intensified regimen such as  escalated bleomycin, etoposide , Adriamycin  (doxorubicin), 
cyclophosphamide, Oncovin (vincristine), procarbazine, and pred nisone (BEACOPP)
demonstrated an improvement in disease control.14However this intensive approach was 
associated with a greater frequency of initial toxicities,14treatment-related mor tality,15and 
long-term toxicities, including higher incidences of secondary acute myeloid leukemia and 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),14and anticipated infert ility.16A more recent randomized 
Phase 3 study directly comparing ABVD with BEACOPP failed to sh ow a significant difference 
in overall survival (OS) despite s tatist ically higher progression free survival (PFS) for the

BEACOPP arm.15The results from these first-line studies indicate the challeng es to improve the 
outcomes for advanced-stage cHL.
A substantial fraction of patients with HL are not cured; up to 10% of patients with advanced 
stage HL will not achieve an initial remission, and 30% of resp onding patients subsequently 
relapse.7,8The standard of care for patients with relapsed and refractory HL is intensive salvage 
chemotherapy followed by autologous stem c ell transp lant (ASCT), which can produce 
long-term remissions in approximately 50% of patients. Unfortun ately, the remaining 50% of 
ASCT patients do not experience long-term disease control with median overall survival of 
approximately 27 months.17In particular, the prognosis remains exceedingly poor for p atients 
who experience relapse or progressive HL within one year after ASCT where the median 
survival time is approximately 1.2 years.18Several small clinical studies have examined various 
agents in the ASCT relapse d HL population with uni formly poor results. Therefore, the 
therapeutic options for these patients remain very limited.

More recently, other novel approaches have been investigated in  an effort to improve the 
outcome for HL patients failing ASCT. The malignant Reed-Sternb erg cells of classical HL are

characterized by the expression of CD30, a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, 
whose expression is restricted to a subset of activated B-cells , T-cells, and eosinophils.19
Brentuximab vedotin (Adcentrix, SGN-35) is an antibody drug con jugate (ADC) comprising an 
anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody conjugated by a protease cleavabl e linker to the potent 
antimicrotubule disrupting agent, monoethyl auristatin E (MMAE) . Binding of the ADC to CD30 
on the cell surface initiates internalization of the ADC-CD30 c omplex, followed by lysosomal 
proteolytic cleavage with the resultant release of MMAE, disrup tion of the microtubule network, 
and apoptotic cell death.20,21
In a Phase 1 study brentuximab ve dotin was studied in 45 patients with relapsed or refractory 
CD30 lymphomas where the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was deter mined to be 1.8 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks.22Treatment was reasonably well tolerated with the most common ad verse events 
(AEs) being fatigue, pyrexia, diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, an d peripheral neuropathy. Because 
a substantial proportion of patients achieved ob jective responses, brentuximab vedotin was 
subsequently evaluated in a Phase 2 trial in a larger homogeneo us population of HL patients who 
had relapsed or had refractory disease after ASCT.23In this open-label Phase 2 study, 102 were 
patients treated up to a maximu m of 16 cycles. Although the over all response r ate (ORR) was 
75% with complete remissions (CR) in 34% and partial remission (PR) in 41% of patients, 
median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS ) were 5.6 months and 
22.4 months for all p atients. The median duration of response for patients who achie ved a CR 
(n = 35) and a PR (n = 41) was 21.7 and 5.1 months, respectively. A  recent update with longer 
follow up of the original patient population (median observatio n time 32.7 months) has shown 
that 14 patients remain in remission, with 9 patients who have not started a new anti-cancer 
therapy and 5 patients who received ASCT after brentuximab vedot in treatment.24Despite the 
encouraging high response rate obtained with brentuximab vedoti n, long-term disease control 
remains challenging since only a small proportion of patients c an maintain complete responses. 
Additionally, in the Phase 2 trial, 21% of patients discontinue d treatment due to AEs, most 
commonly peripheral sensory and peripheral motor neuropathies. Tolerability may also be of 
increased concern in patients > 60 years, where higher rates of anemia and peripheral neuropathy 
have been reported.25
Clearly for the relatively young and otherwise fit HL populatio n who has relapsed after ASCT, 
there still remains a compelling unmet need for improved salvag e therapy. Despite the high 
initial r ate of OR obtained with brentuximab vedotin after ASCT failure,  r e l a p s e  f o r  m o s t  
patients occurs after a relatively s hort disease free interval. Unfortunately, for the population o f 
HL patients who have failed both ASCT and brentuximab vedotin s alvage therapy, there 
currently is no uniform appro ach to their treatment, underscoring the need for novel approaches 
to improve treatment outcomes for this group of patients as wel l.

1.1 Study Rationale
1.1.1 Scientific Rationale
Immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of HL are well-e stablished components of 
current treatment paradigms for these diseases.22,26,27,28T cell checkpoint regulators such as 
programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1, CD279) and CTLA-4 (CD152) are cell s urface mo lecules 
that, when engaged by their cognate ligands, induce signaling c ascades down-regulating T cell 
activation and proliferation. Several models have been proposed  to explain these activities, 
including the breaking of immune tolerance to tumor cell antige ns by evasion of physiological 
T cell checkpoint controls. Other m utually non-exclusive models propose that PD-1 antagonists 
like nivolumab reverse the exhausted/arrested T cell phenotype by activating tumor reactive 
T cells in lymphoi d organs and in the periphe ry, allowing for enhanced trafficking of tumor 
adjacent T cells into the tumor.29
Nivolumab is a fully human, IgG4 (κ) isotype mAb that binds PD- 1 on activated immune cells 
and disrupts engagement of the receptor with its ligands PD-L1( B7-H1/CD274) and PD-L2 
(B7-DC/CD273), thereby abrogating inhibitory signals and augmen ting the host antitumor 
response. In early clinical trials, nivolumab monotherapy has demonstrated activity in several 
tumor types, including melanoma, renal cell cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (NS CLC).30
Additionally, in an ongoing Phase 1 study in subjects with relap sed hematologic malignancies 
(CA209039), nivolumab has demonstrated preliminary activity in subjects with HL, follicular 
lymphoma (FL), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In ge neral, nivolumab has been 
well tolerated to date, with a favorable safety profile relative to anticipated toxicities based on an immunostimulatory mechanism of action.
31
Expression of PD-L1 by malignant lymphoma cells and by other cells in the tumor 
microenvironment including infiltrating T cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes, has the potential 
to interact with tumor specific T cells that express PD-1. The interaction of PD-1 on tumor 
specific cytotoxic T cells with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 cau ses a decrease in the ability of 
these cells to proliferate and exert cytotoxic effects, increas es their apoptotic rate and alters the 
functional characteristics of the cells to produce a tolerogeni c and/or exhausted phenotype.32,33
This study will evaluate the effects of PD-1 blockade by nivolu mab in subjects with cHL.
1.1.2 Study Design Rationale for Cohorts A, B, and C
A single-arm study design was chosen because there is no approp riate, fully-approved active 
comparator for relapsed third-line or later cHL subjects failin g ASCT. Although brentuximab 
vedotin may be an effective treatment option for this patient p opulation, its regulatory approval 
is provisional: accelerated approval in the US and the condition al approval in EU. As recently 
reported, long-term disease control has been observed in a very  limited patie nt population; it is 
still uncertain whether patients are curable with this approach. Thus, this population s till has 
limited therapeutic options, representing a substantial unmet m edical need.

BMS-936558 nivolumab
A parallel cohort a pproach was selected b ecause the target population of cHL failing ASCT 
requires clear distinction based upon prior brentuximab vedotin  treatment. This study design will 
test nivolumab in para llel treatment  groups; brentuximab vedoti n- naïve subjects (Cohort A) who 
have failed ASCT, or those who received brentuximab vedotin trea tment as salvage following 
failure of ASCT (Cohort B). Cohort A or Cohort B represents the subjects who require the third 
or fourth line of therapy (in Figure 1-1 ). The two cohorts will enroll independently and will be 
analyzed separately. A third Cohort ( Cohort C) is being added. T his new cohort w ill start to 
enroll after completion of Cohort B enrollment. Analysis will b e also conducted independently 
for Cohort C.
1.1.2.1 Rationale for Cohort C
Cohort C will provide an extended assessment of the benefit-risk  for this study drug in advanced 
stage cHL patients in a large r patient popul ation. Approximatel y 100 subjects treated from 
Cohort C will assist in the identification and characterization of less common safety events as 
well as further confirmation of the activity initially observed  in Cohort B. 
Importantly, Cohort C will also provide initial data concerning whether discontinuation of 
nivolumab monotherapy is safe in subjects who have remained in C R for one year on nivolumab. 
Most currently ongoing nivolumab Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies for  solid tumor a nd hematologic 
malignancies permit treatment un til disease progression or unac ceptable toxicity. Because 
nivolumab is generally tolerable , some subjects who have achieve d CR may remain on study 
therapy indefinitely unless disease progression occurs. It will be  helpful to answer whether these 
subjects can safely stop treatm ent at some point in order to avo id unnecessary exposure to study 
drug, and can experience similar benefit. To address this scien tific question, a discontinuation 
schedule will be examined in Cohort C. Sub jects who have persist ent CR for one year on study 
drug will discontinue the study drug. If 15 to 20% of the subjects from Cohort C achieve CR and 
maintain their CR for one year, the discontinuation schedule will be assessed on approximately 15 to 20 subjects. To ensure that subjects can safely discontinue study therapy , regular follow-up 
observational visits will be condu cted after treatment discontin uation for up to two years. 
Furthermore, re-initiation of study therapy will be permitted f or those subjects relapsing within 
two years of study drug discontinuation. This discontinuation s chedule will provide important 
information as to whether the subjects who have attained good disease control can safely 
discontinue study  drug without increasing risk of relapse.
In addition, plasma samples will be collected in Cohort C subjec ts for, but not limited to, the 
determination of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) for molecular m onitoring of the disease.
1.1.2.2 Justification for Doses in Cohorts A, B, and C
The benefit-risk profiles of nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks (Q2 W) and 480 mg every  4 weeks 
(Q4W) are expected to be comparable to 3 mg/kg Q2W. This assessment is based on a 
comprehensive characterization of nivolumab PK, safety, efficac y, and exposure-response (E-R)
relationships across indications. Given that nivolumab has line ar PK over a dose range of 0.1 to 
10 mg/kg across multiple tumor types, the 240 mg Q2W regimen wa s selected based on the 
Revised Protocol No: 04c
Date: 22-Aug-2019 21
3.0 Approved 930105741 3.0v
Clinical Protocol CA209205
BMS-936558 nivolumab
approximate median body weight of 80 kg for subjects treated in  nivolumab clinical trials. The 
480 mg Q4W regimen was selected as it translates to a doubling o f the 240 mg flat dose given 
Q2W. With reduced dosing frequency from Q2W to Q4W, the average  nivolumab exposure with 
480 mg Q4W is expected to be comparable to that from 3 mg/kg Q2 W or 240 mg Q2W.
Using a previously developed popul ation pharmacokinetic (PPK) mo del that incorporated time-
varying CL, nivolumab exposures were estimated in advanced mela noma, NSCLC, advanced 
RCC, SCCHN, cHL, and UC subjects for nivolumab 240 mg Q2W and 4 80 mg Q4W dosing.
The geometric means of key summary measures of exposure achieve d with nivolumab 240 mg 
Q2W including peak (Cmax), time -averaged (Cavg) and trough (Cmi n) concentrations after the 
first dose or at steady-state were similar (<6% difference) to the corresponding exposures 
achieved with nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W. The magnitude of the diffe rence is not expected to be 
clinically significant.
In comparing nivolumab 480 mg Q4W to 3 mg/kg Q2W, the geometric  mean time-averaged 
concentration over the first 28 days (Cavgd28) was approximately 27% higher with 480 mg 
Q4W, whereas the geometric mean s teady-state time-averaged conce ntration (Cavgss) for both 
dosing regimens was similar. Nivolumab geometric mean trough co ncentrations at Day 28 
(Cmind28) and at steady-state (Cminss) were 22% and 16% lower, respectively, with 480 mg 
Q4W dosing. Conversely, geometric mean peak nivolumab concentra tions after the first dose 
(Cmax1) and at steady-state (Cmaxss) were 111% and 43.4% higher , respectively, with 480 mg 
Q4W dosing. 
Extensive E-R analyses were conducted for OS, OR, and tumor gro wth dynamics to bridge 
efficacy of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W  and 480 mg Q4W w ith the clinically evaluated 3 mg/kg 
Q2W dosing regimen. The primary exposure measure used in the analyses was Cavgd28 because 
it represents the relevant drug concentration over the entire du ration of earlier dosing intervals 
from Q2W and Q4W regimens. The hazard ratios with nivolumab 240 mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W 
were predicted to be similar to 3 mg/ kg Q2W across multiple tum or types (melanoma, RCC, SQ 
and NSQ NSCLC). There were no differences in predicted response  rate with nivolumab 240 mg 
Q2W or 480 mg Q4W compared to 3 mg/kg Q2W. There was also no apparent relationship between Cavgd28 and individual estimates of tumor growth rate.
To evaluate safety, the e xposure margin of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W  and 480 mg Q4W relative to 
the safe and well-tolerated dose of 10 mg/kg Q2W was determined . In addition, extensive E-R 
analyses for AE-DC/D, AE-Grade 3+, and Grade 2+ immune-mediated  adverse events (AE-IM 
Grade 2+) were conducted with pooled safety data across multipl e tumor types (melanoma, 
RCC, SQ NSCLC, NSQ NSCLC, SCCHN, cHL, and UC). Exposure margins  with 240 mg Q2W 
or 480 mg Q4W were below that achieved with nivolumab 10 mg/kg Q2W indicating that these 
dosing regimens are expected to be safe and tolerable. In addit ion, the risk of AE-DC/D, AE-
Grade 3+, and AE-IM Grade 2+ was not significantly associated w ith Cavgd28 or Cmax1 in the 
E-R analyses.

1.1.3 Study Design Rationale for Cohort D
Cohort D w ill investigate the overall safety and tolerability of nivoluma b monotherapy (240 mg 
flat dose) followed by nivolumab (240 mg flat dose) in combinat ion with chemotherapy 
(doxorubicin, vinblastine, and daca rbazine: AVD where A stands f or Adriamycin, which is the 
trade name of doxorubicin) in subjects who are newly diagnosed,  previously untreated cHL with 
advanced stage (Stage IIB, III and IV) disease. The first segmen t of the tested regimen in this 
cohort w ill consist of 4 doses of nivolumab monotherapy on a 2-week sche dule. The second 
segment of the regimen will consist of 6 cycles (12 doses) of ni volumab in combination with 
three chemotherapy drugs (doxorubi cin, vinblastine, and dacarba zine: AVD) which are 
frequently used as standard-of-care for newly diagnosed cHL. 
As explained in more detail below, a nivolumab-based regimen ha s the potential to improve 
long-term clinical outcome due to its capacity to reduce tumor burden and i nduce durable 
response as a single agent, in addition to its tolerable safety  profile.
Rationale for Nivolumab Monotherapy
This study will evaluate nivolumab monotherapy (four doses) as th e first component of the tested 
regimen in first line cHL subjects with advanced stage disease based on the following 
considerations. 
First, nivolumab monotherapy in CA209039 significantly reduced t umor burden in the first 
16 weeks ( Figure 1.4.3.4-1 ), where 39.1% of heavily pretreated  subjects with cHL were abl e to 
achieve an overall response within the first 8 weeks of nivoluma b monotherapy, and 65.2% were 
able to achieve an overall response (CR or PR) within the first  16 weeks (Table 1.1.3-1). This 
indicates that nivolumab monotherapy can potentially be utilize d as induction therapy for newly 
diagnosed cHL, given that monotherapy generated high response r ate (87%) and the remaining 
subjects (13%) had stable disease. The earliest progression not ed in the HL cohort was observed 
at 15 weeks. It is reasonable to presume that the durability of  response will be similar between 
newly diagnosed cHL patients and heavily pre-treated cHL patien ts.

Out of 20 responders in the Phase 1 study (CA209039), the media n duration of response in the 
14 subjects who did not proceed to stem cell transplant (SCT) wa s over 14 months (57.0 weeks; 
range: 23.3 - 76.3+ weeks).34This is in contrast to the r elative short dur ability of respons e 
(6.7 months 95% CI: 3.6 - 14.8), which was reported for 76 respond ers in a similar population 
who were treated with brentuximab vedotin monotherapy35. Again, there is no reason to consider 
that durability of response will be different in newly diagnose d cHL subjects from that observed 
in heavily treated cHL subjects.
Third, treatment with immune modulating therapy early in the di sease course and prior to 
immunosuppressive/myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy may be advantageous for 
therapies that require a host's ability to mount an initial imm une response. Chemotherapies 
suppress myelopoiesis, and decrease the number of red blood cells, platelets, and lymphocytes 
(including T-lymphocytes) in the peripheral circulation. By lowering the overall number of 
T-lymphocytes, a checkpoint inhi bitor such as nivolumab will have fewer effector cells for 
potential lessened downstream ant i-tumor activity during the combination therapy period. 
Fourth, introduction of nivolumab would provide an opportunity to spare patients from toxicity 
associated with certain chemotherapy in the future. Due to the significant reduction of tumor 
burden by nivolumab monotherapy observed in the Phase 1 study, a nivolumab-incorporated 
regimen might reduce the number of required cycles of multiagen t chemotherapy while 
maintaining long-term disease control in future studies. This w ould be beneficial for young 
patients to avoid late adverse effects of traditional chemother apy (eg, secondary malignancies, 
cardiovascular disease, or pulmonary dysfunction)36,37While nivolumab monotherapy in newly 
diagnosed advanced stage cHL in the front line setting is inves tigational, it was already 
investigated in tw o randomized phase III tr ials (CA209066 and CA209067) in the tr eatment 
naive setting in a different tum or, m elanoma.38,39These results indicated favorable safety profile 
of nivolumab monotherapy as a front line therapy in untreated m elanoma patients. For example, 
treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 in the nivolumab-tr eated sub jects were reported 
as 11.7% and 16.3%, respectively.38,39Hence, nivolumab safety profile permits study of a 
relatively short monotherapy  course prior to addition of proven  chemotherapeutic regimen.
Lastly, the Phase 1 study (CA209039) showed a favorable safety p rofile for nivolumab 
monotherapy in heavily treated cHL subjects. Drug-related Grade 3 adverse events were reported 
in five subjects out of 23 (22%), whereas there were no drug-rel ated Grade 4 or 5 adverse events. 
Only two subjects (9%) of  23 heavily treated  subjects discontinue d the drug due to toxicity. 
Discontinuation was reported at 39.6 weeks and at 40 weeks from first  dose of nivolumab due to 
MDS and thrombocytopenia in one subject, and due to pancreatiti s  i n  t h e  o t h e r  s u b j e c t ,  
respectively. None of the cHL subjects discontinued nivolumab mo notherapy due to toxicity 
before 39.6 weeks. This safety profile for the cHL cohort did n ot differ significantly compared to 
that for other tumor types, where over 8,000 subjects have been t reated with nivolumab 
monotherapy.

Rationale for Nivolumab in Combination with AVD 
This study will also evaluate nivolumab used in combination with  AVD as the second segment 
of the proposed regimen. As shown in Table 1.1.3-1 , responses continue to accumulate with 
longer nivolumab exposure. For example, nivolumab monotherapy c ontinued to be effective 
beyond the first 16 weeks of therapy since the cumulative response rate continued to increase up 
to 82.6% response r ate at 48 weeks from the first dose. Therefore, longer exposure  w i t h  
nivolumab maximizes its clinical benefits. However, multiagent chemotherapy which has been 
proven to generate long-term disease control is likely to still  be needed to maximize tr eatment 
effect and ensure the opportunity for long term benefit in adva nced stage cHL. 
ABVD is one of the most frequently used cHL regimens, where lon g-term clinical outcomes 
have been proved in randomized studies.40,41However, bleomycin is considered as the least 
effective drug among the four drugs.42,43,44A recent prospective study from the UK randomized 
952 subjects who had negative PET scans after two cycles of ABV D.44The omission of 
bleomycin from the last four cycles resulted in no significant difference of PFS or OS. PFS at 
3 years was 85.5 % for the patients who continued ABVD vs. 84.5%  for the patients who 
switched to AVD. OS at 3 years was 97.0 % f or ABVD who continued ABVD vs . 97.5% for the 
patients who switched to AVD. The  CR and unconfirmed CR rates a re also similar 65 % for 
ABVD who continued ABVD vs. 69 % for the patients who switched to AVD. Importantly, the 
most serious toxicity associated with ABVD is bleomycin-related pulmonary toxicity, which was 
observed in 18% (25 of 141) of the patients from a Mayo Clinic series.43When patients 
eliminated bleomycin during the ABVD cycles, there was no impac t on CR rates, PFS, or 
OS.42,43This analysis suggests that bleomycin has a limited role in the  ABVD regimen, and 
omitting bleomycin is reasonable in the appropriate context.
Importantly, nivolumab could have the potential for overlapping toxicity with bleomycin. 
Nivolumab has been associated with immune-mediated pneumonitis.  The incidence of 
pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, is relatively  low (3.4% in unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma patients and 6% in metastatic squamous non- small cell lung cancer 
patients), whereas fatal immune-mediated pneumonitis has occurr ed in 0.7% (5/691) of patients 
receiving single agent nivolumab.45On the other hand, bleomycin could cause pulmonary 
toxicity in 15 - 18%43,46of all subjects where the majori ty was treated with ABVD. The 
mortality rate from bleomycin pulmonary toxicity was re ported as 3.0 to  4.2% in all 
bleomycin-treated patients, and 24% in patients who developed t he pulmonary syndrome.43,47
When brentuximab vedotin was combined with ABVD in a Phase 1 st udy, unexpected 
pulmonary toxicity was observed in 44% (11/25) of subjects with two fatal cases due this 
event.48This study was amended by omitting bleomycin, and reported no s ubsequent pulmonary 
toxic effect when brentuximab vedotin was combined with AVD. Co nsequently, if nivolumab is 
combined with bleomycin-included multiagent chemotherapy, there  is the potential of additive 
toxicity similar to what was observed when brentuximab vedotin was added to ABVD. Hence, in 
order to minimize potential toxicity with potentially superior e fficacy, nivolumab will be 
included without bleomycin.

While, there are no clinical or nonclinical data of the additio n of nivolumab to the AVD regimen 
or individual components, the addition of nivolumab to other co nventional chemotherapy 
regimens does not s eem to increase the toxicity from other drugs.49,50Nivolumab was evaluated
with concomitant administration of three different combinations  (gemcitabine and cisplatin, 
pemetrexed and cisplatin, and paclitaxel or carboplatin) in sub jects with an adva nced non-small 
cell lung cancer.49,50No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed during the DLT period 
(the first 6 weeks) of nivolumab treatment in combination with platinum-based doublet 
chemotherapy. The frequencies of the most common treatment-rela ted AEs were similar to those 
observed with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy alone, indica ting a safety profile similar to 
that of individual chemotherapeutic agents. Additionally, drug- drug interaction between 
nivolumab and other chemotherapeutic agents is not expected. It  is not likely that other drugs 
will affect the PK of nivolumab because nivolumab is an IgG4 mo noclonal antibody, which is 
eliminated by non-specific catabolism (often by reticuloendothe lial system proteases); this 
elimination process is  not known to be inhibited or induced by specific drugs. Nivolumab is also 
unlikely to impact the PK of other companion drugs when used in  combination regimens. 
A Phase 1 study in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CA 209009) demonstrated that 
nivolumab at all dose levels (0.3, 2, a nd 10 mg/kg) did not modu late cytokine levels (IL6, IL2, 
and IL10). Because no ch ange in cytokine level was observed, ni volumab is not considered to 
mediate CYP induction, and has no or low potential f or m odulating CYP enzymes, and thereby a 
low risk of interaction with other drugs. Thus, combined toxici ties from nivolumab and AVD are 
unlikely to be observed, whereas there are appropriate safety g uards in place within this protocol 
to detect and manage any unanticipated toxicity from the combination ( Section 7 ). 
In conclusion, it will be clinically important to understand the safety and tolerability of 
nivolumab monotherapy in newly diagnosed cHL population. Additio nally, the safety and 
tolerability of the nivolumab- AVD combination s hould be evaluated. Overall, this new regimen, 
consisting of two temporal components (nivolumab monotherapy fol lowed by nivolumab and 
AVD), may improve clinical outcomes newly diagnosed advanced stage cHL.
Rationale for Nivolumab Flat Dose and 30 Minutes Infusion in Cohort D 
The nivolumab dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) was selected b ased on clinical data and 
modeling and simulation approaches using population PK (PPK) and exposure-response analyses 
of data from studies in multiple tumor types (melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer [NSCLC], 
and renal cell carcinoma [RCC]) where body weight normalized do sing (mg/kg) has been used.
PPK analyses have shown that the PK of nivolumab is linear with  proportional e xposure over a 
dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/ kg, and no differences in PK ac ross ethnicities and tum or types were 
observed. Nivolumab clearance and volume of distribution were f ound to increase as the body
weight increases, but less than the proportional with increasin g weight, indicating that mg/kg 
dosing represents an over-adjustment for the effect of body wei ght on nivolumab PK. The PPK 
model previously developed using data from NSCLC subjects has r ecently been updated, using 
data from 1544 subjects from 7 studies investigating nivolumab in the treatment of melanoma, 
NSCLC, and RCC. In this dataset, the median (minimum - maximum) weight was 77 kg

BMS-936558 nivolumab
(35 kg - 160 kg) and thus, an approximately equivalent dose of 3 mg /kg for an 80 kg subject, 
nivolumab 240 mg Q2W was selected for future studies. To predic t relevant summary exposures 
of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W, the PPK model was used to simulate vir tual trials, each consisting of 
two arms, nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W and 240 mg Q2W. In the simulatio ns, the simulated patient 
populations consisted of subjects randomly sampled from aforeme ntioned pooled d atabase of 
cancer patients. Because no differences in PK were noted across  ethnicities and tumor types, 
these simulated melanoma and NSCLC data will be applicable to p atients with other tumor 
types. The simulated measure of exposure of interest, time-aver aged concentrations (Cavgss) for 
240 mg Q2W are predicted to be similar for all subjects in refe rence to 80 kg subj ects receiving 
3 mg/kg Q2W. 
Nivolumab is safe and well tolerated up to 10 mg/kg Q2W dose le vel. Adverse events have been 
broadly consistent across tumor types following monotherapy and  have not demonstrated clear 
dose-response or exposure-response relationships. Additionally,  the simulated median and 95th 
prediction interval of nivolumab summary exposures across body weight range (35 - 160 kg) are 
predicted to be maintained below the corresponding observed hig hest exposure experienced in 
nivolumab ie, 95th percentile following nivolumab 10 mg/kg Q2W from clinical study 
CA209003. Thus, while subjects in the lower body weight ranges would have greater exposures 
than 80 kg subjects, the exposures are predicted to be within t he range of observed exposures at 
doses (up t o 10 mg/kg Q2W) used in the nivolumab clinical program, and are not considered to 
put subjects at increased risk. For subjects with greater body weights, the simulated ranges of 
exposures are also not expected to affect efficacy, because the  exposures predicted following 
administration of a 240 mg Q2W are on the flat part of the expo sure-response curves for 
previously investigated tumors, melanoma and NSCLC. Given the s imilarity of nivolumab PK 
across tumor types and the similar exposures predicted following administration of 240 mg flat 
dose compared to 3 mg/kg, it is expected that the safety and ef ficacy profile of nivolumab 
240 mg Q2W will be similar to that of nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W. The refore, a flat dose of 
nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks will be used in cohort D.
Long infusion times place a burden on patients and tr eatment centers. Establishing that 
nivolumab can be safely administered using shorter infusion tim es of 30 minutes duration in 
subjects will diminish the burden provided there is no change i n safety profile.
Previous clinical studies show that nivolumab has been administ ered safely over 60 minutes at 
doses ranging up to 10 mg/kg over long treatment duration. In S tudy CA209010, (a Phase 2, 
randomized, double blinded, dose-ranging study of nivolumab in subjects with 
advanced/metastatic clear cell RCC) a dose association was obse rved for infusion site reactions 
and hypersensitivity reactions (1.7% at 0.3 mg/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg and 18.5% at 10 mg/kg). All  
the events were Grade 1 - 2 and were manageable. Reduced infusion  time is currently under 
investigation in study CA209038, an exploratory study of the bi ologic effects of Nivolumab and 
Nivolumab in combination with Ipilimumab treatment in subjects with advanced melanoma.
Overall, infusion reactions including high-grade hypersensitivit y reactions have been uncommon 
across nivolumab clinical studies. A change in safety profile i s not anticipated with 30-minute 
infusion of nivolumab.

1.1.3.1 Summary Information for AVD
Summary information for the individual agents in the chemothera py combination AVD is 
provide d below. Refer to the local product information for each product for more details.
Doxorubicin (Adriamycin)
Doxorubicin is an antitumor anthracycline antibiotic. Doxorubic in intercalates between adjoining 
nucleotide pairs in the DNA helix, and inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis. The terminal half-life 
of doxorubicin is 20 t o 48 h ours. Doxorubicin is used for Hodgkin’s lymphoma. AEs associate d 
with doxorubicin include myocardial toxicity which is manifested in its most severe form  by 
potentially fatal congestive heart failure. Myocardial toxicity  may occur either during 
therapy or months to years after termination of therapy. Theref ore, monitoring for 
potential cardiotoxicity is important. Secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or MDS 
have been reported in patients treated with doxorubicin. Severe  local tissue necrosis will occur if 
there is extravasation during administration. Other reported ad verse effects include, but are not 
limited to, hematologic (myelosuppre ssion), hepatic (increased aspartate aminotransferase 
[AST], alanine aminotrasferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase, and  bilirubin), dermatologic 
(alopecia, red streaks along the injected vein), gastrointestin al (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, mucositis, dysphagia), other cardiovascular (electroc ardiogram [ECG] change, 
arrhythmias), neurologic (peripheral neurotoxicity in the form of local-regional sensory and/or 
motor disturbances), ocular eve nts (conjunctivitis, keratitis, lacrimation), and hypersensitivity 
(fever, chills, and urticaria, and anaphylaxis).51
Vinblastine (Vinblastine Sulphate)
Vinblastine is a vinca alkaloid, which binds to tubulin, a prot ein that forms microtubules. The 
mechanism of action is disruption of mitotic spindle assembly t hrough the interaction with 
tubulin. The terminal half-live of vinblastine is 24.8 hours. A Es associated with vinblastine 
include severe hypomotility with constipation or ileus. Therefore, asse ssment for 
constipation and auscultate abdomen for bowel sounds will be imp ortant . Acute shortness of 
breath and severe bronchospasm have been reported following the  administration of vinca 
alkaloids. Other reported adverse effects include, but are not limited to, hematologic 
(myelosuppression), dermatologic (alopecia, skin vesiculation,) , gastrointestinal (nausea, 
vomiting abdominal pain, cramps, diarrhea, mucositis, gastroint estinal hemorrhage), 
cardiovascular (hypertension, myocardial infarction, angina pec toris and transient abnormalities 
of ECG, Raynaud's phenomenon), and neurologic events (periphera l neuropathy, loss of deep 
tendon reflexes, paresthesias, paralysis, autonomic neuropathy such as paralytic ileus, urinary 
retention, orthostasis, vocal cord paralysis, myalgias, headach e, convulsions, depression, 
dizziness, malaise), jaw pain, and the syndrome of inappropriat e secretion of antidiuretic 
hormone.52
Dacarbazine (DTIC)Although the exact mode of action is unknown, dacarbazine hypot hetically works by alkylation, 
inhibition of  DNA synthesis as a purine analogue and interactio n with sulfhydryl (SH) groups in

proteins. The terminal half-life of dacarbazine is 5 hours. Dac arbazine is used to treat Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma. AEs associated with dacarbazine include hematologic ( myelosuppression), 
dermatologic (alopecia, facial flushing, extravasation with pain), gastrointestinal (nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea), hepatic (increased AST, ALT, hepatic vein thrombosis, hepatocellular 
necrosis), renal (increased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrog en [BUN]), neurologic (facial 
flushing paresthesia) events, influenza-like syndrome (with fev er, malaise, myalgia) and 
anaphylaxis.53

1.4 Product Development Background
Nivolumab is in clinical development for the treatment of subje cts with solid tumors and 
hematological malignancies. In addition to st udy CA 209205, studies to be conducted in the 
hematologic maligna ncies program w ill assess the eff icacy and safety of nivolumab in sub jects 
with DLBCL who have relapsed following high dose chemotherapy A SCT or after failure of at 
least two pri or multi-agent chemothera py regimens in ASCT ineligible subjects (CA209139) and 
in subjects with relapsed or refractory FL (CA209140).
1.4.1 Nivolumab Mechanism of Action
Cancer immunotherapy rests on the  premise that tumors can be re cognized as foreign rather than 
as self and can be effectively attacked by an activated immune system. An effective immune 
response in this setting is thought to rely on immune surveilla nce of tumor antigens expressed on 
cancer cells that ultimately results in an adaptive immune resp onse and cancer cell death. This 
functions by aborting the emergence of tumors as they arise and /or causing tumor shrinkage 
where it is present. Meanwhile, tumor progression may depend up o n  a c q u i s i ti on  of  trai ts th at 
allow cancer cells to evade imm une surveillance and an effectiv e immune response.54This 
evasion may occur by exploiting any of the checkpoints that con trol the regulatory immune

response, including display of antigens and control of co-stimulatory pathways that affect the 
proliferation of cells involved in immunity. Current immunother apy efforts attempt to break the 
apparent tolerance of the immune system to tumor cells and anti gens by either introducing cancer 
antigens by therapeutic vaccination or by modulating regulatory  checkpoints of the immune 
system, either directly by stimulation of immune cells by antibodies directed to receptors on 
T and B cells or indirectly by cytokine manipulation. T- cell stimulation is a complex process 
involving the integration of numerous positive, as well as nega tive, costimulatory signals in 
addition to antigen recognition by the T-cell receptor.55Collectively, these signals govern the 
balance between T-cell activation and tolerance to antigens.54
Programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1, CD279), a 55 kD type I transmembrane protein, is a 
member of the CD28 family of T-cell costimulatory receptors tha t also includes CD28, CTLA-4, 
ICOS, and BTLA.55PD-1 contains an intracellular membrane proximal immunoreceptor  tyrosine 
inhibitory motif (ITIM) and a membrane distal immunoreceptor ty rosine-based switch motif 
(ITSM). Two ligands specific for PD-1 have been identified: PD- L1 (B7-H1/CD274) and PD-L2 
(B7-DC/CD273). PD-L1 and PD-L2 have been shown to down-regulate  T-cell activation upon 
binding to PD-1 in both murine and human systems.56,57PD-1 delivers a negative signal by the 
recruitment of SHP-2 to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue in the ITSM in its cytoplasmic 
region.58,59PD-1 is primarily expressed on activated T cells, B cells, and m yeloid cells.60
Further evidence for a negative regulatory role for PD-1 comes from studies of PD-1 deficient 
mice. PD-1-deficien t mice develop va rious autoimmune phenotypes, including dilated 
cardiomyopathy, a lupus-like syndrome with arthritis and nephri tis, and accelerated diabetes 
mellitus.61,62,63The emergence of these autoimmune phenotypes is dependent upon the genetic 
background of the mouse strain and many of these phenotypes eme rge at different times and 
show variable penetrance. In addition to the phenotypes of null mutations, PD-1 inhibition by 
antibody-mediated blockade in several murine models has been fo und to play a role in the 
development of autoimmune diseases such as encephalomyelitis, g raft-versus-host disease, and 
type I diabetes.64,65Taken together, these results suggest that PD-1 blockade has th e potential to 
activate anti-self T-cell responses, but these responses are va riable and dependent upon various 
host genetic factors. Thus, PD-1 deficiency or inhibition is no t accompanied by a universal loss 
of tolerance to self antigens.
Preclinical animal models of tumors have shown that blockade by  PD-1 by monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) can enhance the anti-tumor immune response an d result in tumor rejection. 
Antitumor activity by PD-1 block ade functions in PD-L1-positive  tumors as well as in tumors 
that are negative for the expression of PD-L1.66,67,68,69,70,71This suggests that host mechanisms 
(ie, expression of PD-L1 on antigen-presenting cells) limit the  antitumor response. Consequently, 
both PD-L1 positive and negative tumors may be targeted using t his approach. In humans, 
constitutive PD-L1 expression is normally limited to macrophage-lin eage cells, although 
expression of PD-L1 can be induced on other hematologic cells a s well, including activated 
T cells. However, aberrant expre ssion of PD-L1  by tumor cells ha s been reported in a number of 
human malignancies.72,73,74,75,76,77,78PD-L1 expressed by tumor cells, including FL and

DLBCL, has been shown to enhance apoptosis of activated tumor-s pecific T cells in vitro.59,79,80
Moreover, the expression of PD L1 may protect the tum or cells from the induction of a poptosis 
by effector T cells.81Retrospective analyses of several human tumor types suggest tha t tumor 
over-expression (as measured by IHC) of PD-L1 may permit immune  evasion by tumors. 
Blockade of the PD 1 pathway by nivolumab was studied using the  mixed lymphocyte reaction 
(MLR). PD-1 blockade resulted in a reproducible enhancement of both proliferation and
interferon-gamma (IFN- γ)release in the MLR.82The effect of nivolumab on antigen-specific 
recall response was investigated using a CMV-restimulation assa y with human peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and was evaluated by ELISA. These da ta indicated that nivolumab, 
versus an isotype-matched control antibody, augmented IFN- γsecretion from CMV-specific 
memory T-cells in a dose-dependent manner. PD-1 blockade by niv olumab is therefore 
considered a promising immunotherapeutic option. 
1.4.2 PD-1 Expression in Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma
PD-L1 is expressed on the malignant cells in patients with a va riety of hematolog ic malignancies 
including patients with HL, primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma , T cell lymphomas, multiple 
myeloma, and acute leukemias. Membranous staining of cHL tumors  indicated that 82% of the 
cases showed ≥5% positive malignant cells.80
Although cHLs have an extensive polymorphous inflammatory infil trate, there is little evidence 
of an effective host anti-tumor immune response. In fact, recen t studies indicate that Hodgkin RS 
cells produce certain molecu les that limit the efficacy of T-ce ll mediated anti-tumor immune 
responses.83,84By integrating high-resolution copy number data with transcript ional profiles, the 
immunoregulatory genes, PD-L1 and PD-L2, were found to be key t argets of the 9p24.1 
amplification in cHL cell lines and primary tumors.85PD-1 ligand gene amplification was 
associated with increased protein expression in primary cHLs us ing quantitative 
immunohistochemical methods.85In additional recent studies, EBV infection was found to be 
another mechanism of upregulating PD-L1.86,87These findings suggest that targeting the 
PD-1-PD-L1/PD-L2 axis could have therapeutic implications in cH L patients.
1.4.3 Summary of Results for Nivolumab Program
1.4.3.1 Summary of Nivolumab Monotherapy Safety in Solid Tumors
Nivolumab is well tolerated based upon experience in approximat ely 1,500 subjects (as of 
21-Jul-2013) treated with nivolumab as a monotherapy  or in combination with other therapeu tic 
agents. Special attention is given to unique AEs which are refe rred to as “Select AEs” in the 
BMS-936558 (nivolumab) Investigator Brochure (IB) and as descri bed below. 
An ongoing Phase 1 study (CA209003) has enrolled 306 subjects w ith advanced solid tumors 
including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and NSCLC has p rovided the most mature 
safety data from nivolumab monotherapy. Sub jects received nivolumab  at doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3 
or 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks. No MTD was identified. D rug-related AEs of any

grade occurred in 72.4% of subjects. The most frequent drug-rel ated AEs included fatigue 
(25.7%), rash (13.5%), diarrhea (11.8%), and pruritis (10.2%). Grade 3 or 4 drug-related AEs 
were observed in  14.8% of subjects . The most common Grade 3 or 4 drug-related AEs  occurring 
in 1% of subjects were: fati gue (1.6%), ly mphopenia (1.3%), abd ominal pain (1%), diarrhea 
(1%), hypophosphatemia (1 %) and pneumonitis (1%). 
As an immuno-oncology (I-O) agent, nivolumab is associated with  unique AEs, whose 
mechanism of action is consistent with a potential inflammatory  mediated process. These unique 
immune-related AEs, referred to as “select AEs” in the nivoluma b IB, have not typically been 
observed with cytotoxic agents. Select AEs have been categorize d into seven areas: pulmonary 
toxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, hepatotoxicity, endocrinop athy, skin toxicity, neurological 
toxicity and renal toxicity. Select AEs have occurred with low frequency (< 5%) are manageable, 
and are reversible with drug interruption, discontinuation, or with the use of corticosteroid and/or 
other immunosuppressants. Select AEs, in particular pneumonitis , are considered clinically 
meaningful as they require greater vigilance and for early reco gnition and prompt intervention. 
Therefore, management  algorithms have been  developed and implem ented for each 
immunologically-associated select AE category [refer to IB and in Appendix 1 of the protocol.].
1.4.3.2 Nivolumab Monotherapy Safety in Phase 1 Study for Hematologic 
Malignancies Including cHL
Preliminary safety  data from an ongoing Phase 1 study for subje cts with a variety of hematologic 
malignancies (CA209039) suggested that the safety for these mal ignancies seems similar to that 
for solid tumors. As of 27-Feb-2014, data were available for 10 3 subjects, including 23 subjects 
with cHL. Treatment with nivol umab in subjects with hematologica l malignancies has been well 
tolerated and toxicities have been generally manageable. There was 1 DLT (Dose Limiting 
Toxicity) at the 1 mg/kg dose level in a subject with multiple m yeloma who experienced Grade 3 
pneumonia and Grade 3 pneumonitis. There was 1 DLT at the 3 mg/ kg dose level in a subject
with small lym phocytic lymphoma who experienced Grade 3 hypereo sinophilia and Grade 3 
diplopia. The MTD was not reached. All of the subjects with HL w ere treated at a dose of 
3 mg/kg of nivolumab.
Adverse events were reported  in 91 of 103 (88.3%) subjects and Grade 3 - 4 events in 
40 (38.8%) subjects. Related AEs were reported in 63 (61.2%) sub jects. Those that occurred in 
more than 5% of sub jects included: fatigue (12.6%), rash (10.7%) , diarrhea (8.7%), pneumonitis 
(8.7%), pyrexia (7.8%), and pruritus (7.8%). Related Grade 3 - 4 events were repor ted in 
16 (15.5%) subjects; the most common of which was leukopenia tha t occurred in 3 (2.9%) 
subjects. Sixteen  (15.5%) sub jects discontinued therapy due to A Es, 7 of which were related to 
study therapy. A total of  18 (17.5%) sub jects died:  14 due to dis ease, 3 due to other causes, and 1 
due to drug toxicity. Drug-related pneumonitis was observed in 9 subjects (8.7%): B- cell 
lymphoma (n = 5), T- cell lym phoma (n = 2), multiple myeloma (n = 1), and HL (n = 1). 
Six subjects had Grade 1 or 2 pneumonitis; 2 had Grade 4; one pat ient with small lymphocytic 
lymphoma suffered from Grade 5. In the CA209039 study, pneumoni t is is slightly higher than 
that seen in the nivolumab studies in total and that now includ es approximately 1,500 subjects.

The safety experience focusing on the 23 subjects in the HL coho rt did not differ significantly 
compared to that for all 103 sub jects with other hematologic malignancies on the CA209039 
study. AEs were reported in 21 (91.3%) subjects and Grade 3 - 4 ev ents in 10 (43.5%) sub jects. 
Related serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 2 (8.7%)  subjects. With the exception of 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), the other related high grade ev ents did not require treatment 
and resolved spontaneously at the next visit. Related AEs were reported in 16 (69.6%) subjects. 
Those that occurred in more than 2 (> 5%) subjects included: rash  (17.4%), fatigue (13.0%), 
pyrexia (13.0%), diarrhea (13.0%), na usea (13.0%), d ecreased pl atelet count (13.0%), cough 
(8.7%), hypothyroidism (8.7%), ALT increased (8.7%), and AST in creased (8.7%). Related 
Grade 3 events were reported in 4 (17.4%) subjects and included and low platelets (described in 
detail below), lipase increase, decreased lymphocytes and decre ased leukocytes. 
Drug-related pneumonitis was reported in one patient from 23 su bjects with cHL. This patient
had decreased leukocytes which resulted in discontinuation of t he therapy. One month later, the 
patient underwent BCNU (carmustine), etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan (BEAM) 
conditioning and ASCT. The patient subsequently developed Grade  3 caecitis, mucositis, and 
pneumonitis, all considered possibly related to prior therapy w ith nivolumab. 
One patient discontinued therapy due to Grade 3 MDS. This patie nt had received BEAM 
conditioning, ASCT in 2008, and received 7 systemic treatment r egimens incl uding doxorubicin 
(adriamycin), bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD), ifosf amide, carboplatin, etoposide 
(ICE), brentuximab from 2007 to 2012. Although it was unclear i f MDS was due to prior 
chemotherapy or pri or ASCT, the  possibility that it could have been due to nivolumab could not  
be excluded. 
Six subjects elected to stop therapy with a best response of CR or PR to pursue transplant 
options, including 1 patient who died of graft-versus-host-dise ase (GVHD) that was not related 
to nivolumab therapy.Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy is managea ble and generally consistent 
across completed and ongoing clinical trials, including CA20903 9 and the HL cohort.
Adverse Event Management Algorithms
Because of the potential for clinically meaningful nivolumab-re lated AEs requiring early 
recognition and prompt interven tion, management algorithms have  been developed for suspected 
pulmonary toxicity, gastrointestinal, hepatic toxicity, endocri nopathy, skin toxicity, neurological 
toxicity and renal tox icity. 
The algorithms reco mmended for utilization in CA209205 are contained in the nivolu mab 
(BMS-936558) IB and in  Appendix 1 of the protocol.
1.4.3.3 Nivolumab Monotherapy Clinical Activity in Solid Tumors
The clinical activity of nivolumab monotherapy has been observe d in subjects with melanoma, 
RCC, and NSCLC in a Phase 1 study (CA209003), and in two subjec ts with colorectal cancer in 
other Phase 1 studies (MDX1106-01, ONO-4538-01).

In a Phase 1 study (CA209003, N = 306), nivolumab monotherapy dem onstrated clinical activity 
in a variety of solid tumor types across a range of doses (0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 
3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg). A response of either CR or PR, as determined  by investigator assessed 
tumor evaluations based on modified RECIST 1.0, has been report ed at all dose levels. Among 
107 subjects with advan ced melanoma, the O RR was 33 (31%) wherea s progression-free 
survival rate (PFSR) at 24 week was 44% (95% confidence interva l (CI): 34 - 54 weeks). Among 
129 subjects with advanced NSCLC, the ORR was 22 (17%) where as PFSR at 24 week was 
34% (95% CI: 25 - 42 weeks). Am ong 34 sub jects with advanced RCC, the ORR was 10 (29%) 
where as PFSR at 24 weeks was 59% (95% CI: 42 - 75 weeks). The ni volumab IB includes 
details of clinical efficacy d ata from this study as w ell as additional solid tumor studies.
1.4.3.4 Nivolumab Monotherapy Clinical Activity in Hematologic Malignancies 
Including cHL
Nivolumab monotherapy clinical activity (at either the 1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg dose levels) has been 
observed in heavily p retreated NHL and cHL subjects in an ongoi ng Phase 1 study for subjects
with a variety of hematologi c malignancies (CA209039). Three of  nine subjects (33%) with 
relapsed or refractory DLBCL treated have experienced an OR (2 PR and 1 CR), with the current 
response duration ranging between 12 to 24 weeks. Two of eight subjects (25%) with relapsed or 
refractory FL have experienced an OR (1 PR and 1 CR), with the c urrent response duration 
ranging between 12 to 54 weeks.
Preliminary data has shown clinical activity in 23 subjects wit h cHL (average age: 35 year old; 
range 20 - 54). The Phase 1 study defined ORR as the proportion o f subjects whose best overall 
response is either investigators-assessed CR or PR. The ORR in the cHL cohort is 87% (20 out 
of 23 subjects) with a CR rate of 26% (6 out of 23 subjects). F ifteen out of 23 subjects (65%) 
received brentuximab as salvage therapy after failure of ASCT. In this subset of subjects, the 
ORR is 87% (13 out 15 subjects); CR in 2 and PR in 13. Five sub jects are brentuximab-naive
consisting of three without previous ASCT and two with previous  ASCT. Two of the three 
without prior ASCT achieved CR, whereas both subjects with ASCT  attained CR. Six subjects
elected to stop therapy with a best response of CR or PR to pur sue allogeneic SCT options. One 
heavily treated patient stopped nivolumab therapy due to develo pment of MDS; this patient had a 
best overall response (BOR) of PR. Two subjects came off study du e to progressive disease 
(SD of 8 and 16 weeks then PD). All other subjects continue on stu dy. Table 1.4.3.4-1

1.4.3.5 Nivolumab Monotherapy Clinical Pharmacology Summary
Single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of nivolumab were evaluated i n 39 subjects with multiple 
tumor types in study MDX1106-01 in the dose range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg. The median Tmax 
across single doses ranged from 1.6 to 3 hours wit h individual values ranging from 0.9 to 
7 hours. The PK of nivolumab was linear in the range of  0.3 to 10 mg/kg with  dose proportional 
increases in Cmax and AUC(INF) and low to moderate inter-subjec t variability observed at each 
dose level (ie, coefficient of variation ranging from 7 to 45%) . Geometric mean clearance after a 
single intravenous (IV) dose ranged from 0.13 to 0.19 mL/h/kg, wh ile mean volume of 
distribution (Vz) varied from 83 to 113 mL/kg across doses. The  mean terminal half-life of 
nivolumab is 17 to 25 days, which is consistent with the half-l ife of endogenous IgG4, indicating 
that the elimination mechanism of nivolumab may be similar to I gG4. Both elimination and 
distributio n of nivolumab a ppear to be independent of dose in the dose range studied.
A preliminary PPK model was developed using data from 350 subjects from MDX 1106-01, 
MDX1106-02 and CA209003. Clearance of nivolumab was found to be  similar in all tumor 
types studied and is independent of dose range studied (0.1 to 10 mg/kg). Body weight 
norm alized dosing produces a pproximately uniform t rough concentr ations over a wide range of  
body weights , and hence is appropriate for future clinical tria ls of nivolumab. 
The dose and schedule selected for evaluation in this study , 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W), has 
been evaluated in solid tumors in the ongoing CA209003 study. N ivolumab was adequately 
tolerated up t o 10 mg/ kg, the highest dose level tested, and no MTD was identified. A nti-tumor 
activity was observed at dose levels ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg  in melanoma, NSCLC, and 
RCC, as well as at dose levels of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg in melanoma.  The antitumor activity of 
nivolumab tended to increase with dose, as did the incidence of  SAEs. The anti-tumor activity of 
BMS-936558 nivolumab i n RCC was investigated at dose levels 1 a nd 10 mg/kg, with the higher 
activity observed at 10 mg/kg. The observed anti-tumor activity in melanoma, and NSCLC was 
highest at 3 mg/kg, suggesting that anti-tumor activity appro aches a p lateau at dose levels of 
3 mg/kg and above. The ongoing CA209039 study in hematologic mal ignancies includes 2 dose 
levels: 1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg Q2W. The 3 mg/kg dose level has bee n shown to be adequately 
tolerable and has been expanded in select tumor types for furth er evaluation. Objective responses 
have been observed at both dose levels in study CA209039. Based  upon the totality of available 
data across the program, a dose of  3 mg/kg Q2W is s elected as the dose anticipated to maximize 
the benefit-risk ratio.
For revised protocol 04c , subjects in Cohorts A, B, and C will switch to being administered 
nivolumab as a 480 mg IV flat dose Q4W or a 240 mg IV flat dose Q 2W (see also Section 3.1).

1.4.4 Rationale for Exploratory Studies of Tumor PD-L1 Expression as a 
Potential Predictive Biomarker in HL
Aberrant expression  of PD-L1 protein by tumor cells (retrospectively detected by I HC) has been 
reported in a number of human malignancies, including cHL.80Elevated PD-L1 expression has 
been proposed to enhance immune e vasion; this notion is support ed by separate studies 
demonstrating that PD-L1 expressed by tumor cells enhances apop tosis of activated tumor-
specific T cells in vitro and that the expression of PD-L1 prot ects tumor cells from the induction 
of apoptosis by effector T cells.30In vitro, anti-PD -L1 blocking antibody boosts proliferation and  
IFN-γsecretion by allogeneic T cells responding to DLBCL cells and i n autologous cultures of 
primary DLBCL, PD-L1 blockade enhanced secretion of inflammator y cytokines IFN- γ, 
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-1, IL-6, I L-8, IL-13, TNF-α , and 
macrophage inflammatory protein-1 α.
Preliminary data indicate PD-L1 protein expression in solid tum ors may correlate with 
nivolumab clinical activity. Of 38 evaluable melanoma pre-treat ment biopsies, 17 were PD-L1+ 
(45% positivity rate) and 7/17 of these PD-L1+ subjects had an O R (41%). Clin ical activity of 
nivolumab was also seen in the PD-L1 negative population, howev er, at a much lower rate 
(3/21; 14%). This data suggests that, in melanoma, PD-L1 expressi on on tumor cells may 
correlate with clinical activity. Additional analysis is underwa y to further evaluate this 
hypothesis in solid tumors.
In order to more thoroughly assess the role of PD-L1 protein ex pression as a predictive 
biomarker in hematological malignancies, available archival or recent tumor tissue will be 
collected from all consenting subjects in this study, and PD-L1 expression wil l be tested 
retrospectively. Analyses to assess the association of PD-L1 an d efficacy measures will be 
conducted.
1.4.5 Rationale and Aims for Biomarker Assessments
The biological basis of nivolumab  in the treatment of oncologic al disease is to modulate the 
immune system to both generate and restore a durable anti-tumor  response leading to clearance 
of tumor. The nivolumab clinical data supports the hypothesis t hat inhibition of the PD-1 
pathway results in rejectio n of tumor by t he host immune system.
The precise mechanisms by which nivolumab exerts its anti-tumor  activity is unclear, however, 
particular cell types, such as effector T cells and regulatory T cells are critical for the anti-tumor 
response. 
Therefore, the major hypotheses that will be addressed are: 
•Does expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells prior to therapy c orrelate with clinical effi cacy to 
monotherapy or study therapy?

BMS-936558 nivolumab
•Does the mutational status of tumor cells or tumor infectivity (ie EBV s tatus) correlate with 
clinical efficacy to monotherapy?
•Can we define distinct pharmac odynamic markers of monotherapy i n the peripheral 
compartment?
•How does nivolumab alter the activating and negative costimulatory molecules on immune 
cells in the periphery and at the tumor site? Are their distinct  mechanisms of resistance to 
nivolumab or study therapy?
•Is the intratumoral or peripheral T cell repertoire predictive of response to nivolumab?
•Does the composition and phenotype of the tumor microenvironmen t, at baseline, or 
on-treatment, correlate with clinical efficacy?
1.4.6 Rationale for Quality of Life Evaluation
Outcomes research data including health-related quality of life  and patient reported symptom 
burden provide a more complete understanding of the impact of tr eatment by incorporating the 
patients’ perspective. These data offer insights into the patie nt experience that may not be 
captured through physician reporting. Generic health-related qu ality of life scales provide data 
necessary in calculating u tility values for health ec onomic models. The EQ -5D will be  collected 
in order to assess the impact of nivolumab on generic h ealth-r elated qu ality of life and the data 
will be used fo r populating h ealth economic models most notably, cost effectiveness analysis . 
The EORTC QLQ-C30 will be collected in cohort A, B and C subjec ts in order to assess cancer 
specific health-r elated qu ality of life. The combination of the generic scale for general  health 
status and econo mic evaluation and the cancer sp ecific scale will provide a robust outcomes 
research package.
1.5 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
Patients with cHL who failed ASCT represent an area of substant ial unmet medical need. The 
clinical activity of nivolumab (ORR: 87%, 20 out of 23 subjects ) observed to date in heavily 
pretreated subjects with cHL suggests the potential for improve d clinical outcomes for this 
patient population. Meanwhile, nivolumab also has the potential  for clinically relevant unique 
AEs potentially caused by an inflammatory mechanism. These inclu de pulmonary toxicity, 
hepatotoxicity, diarrhea/colitis, endocrinopathies, and nephrotoxicity. T o date, these unique AEs 
have been manageable with frequent monitoring, prompt diagnosis , and init iation of 
corticosteroids, dose interruption, and adequate supportive care . Together the data suggest a 
positive benefit-risk potential, supporting a Phase 2 study to further assess the safety and efficacy 
of nivolumab in subjects with cHL in advanced stage.
Approximately 70% of patients with cHL with advanced-stage dise ase can expect long-term 
disease control. Nevertheless, the remaining 30% of patients wi ll either relapse or have primary 
refractory disease. Salvage multi-agent chemotherapy, followed by ASCT, can only provide 
long-term disease control in approximately half of the patients  with relapsed or refractory 
disease. Compared to the high probability (> 90%) of  long-term d isease control for l imited-stage

BMS-936558 nivolumab
cHL, there remains substantial room for improvement in disease outcome for advanced-stage 
patients. Furthermore, where possible, these relatively young p atients should avoid intensified 
chemotherapy (such as a prepar ative regimen for ASCT) because o f concerns regarding 
long-term chemotherapy-related toxicities. Therefore, it is cri tical to im prove long-term disease 
control by an improved first line therapy. A nivolumab-based fi rst line regimen may have the 
potential to substantially improve long-term clinical outcomes due to its capacity to effectively 
and safely reduce tumor burden and induce durable response, as well as its favorable safety 
profile. Thus, it is reasonable to evaluate a new nivolumab-based regimen together with standard 
of care chemotherapy in newly diagnosed, previously untreated c HL with advanced stage as a 
pilot study.

in which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study  participation. The language 
must be non-technical and easily understood. 
2) Allow time necessary for subject or subject's legally accepta ble representative to inquire 
about the details of the study.
3) Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by the  subject or the subject's 
legally acceptable representative and by the person who conduct ed the informed consent 
discussion. 
4) Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opinion of the written informed consent 
form and any other information to be provided to the subjects, prior to the beginning of the 
study, and after any revisions are completed for new informatio n.
5) If informed consent is initially given by a subject’s legally  acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently becomes capable of makin g and communicating his 
or her informed consent during the study, consent must addition ally be obtained from the 
subject.
6) Revise the informed consent whenever important new informatio n becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a perso n designated by the investigator, 
should fully inform the subject or the subject's legally accept able representative or legal 
g u a r d i a n ,  o f  a l l  p e r ti n e n t  a s p e c t s  o f  t h e  s t u d y  a n d  o f  a n y  n e w  information relevant to the 
subject's willingness to continue participation in the study. T his communication s hould be 
documented. 
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects mus t be protected, respecting the 
privacy and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements, the subjects' signed ICF 
and, in the US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and reg ulatory authorities have direct 
access to subject records. Subjects unable to give their written consent (eg, stroke or su bjects with or severe dementia) may 
only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally acc eptable representative. The subject

must also be informed about the nature of the study to the exte nt compatible with his or her 
understanding, and should this subject become capable, he or sh e should personally sign and date 
the consent form as soon as possible. The explicit wish of a su bject who is unable t o give his or 
her written consent, but who is capable of forming an opinion a nd assessing information to 
refuse participation in, or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study at any time should be 
considered by the investigator.
The rights, safety, and well-being of the study subjects are th e most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Study Design and Duration
3.1.1 Study Design and Duration for Cohorts A, B, and C
This is a non-comparative, multi-cohort, single-arm Phase 2 stu dy in cHL subjects ≥18 years old 
who failed ASCT. Subjects may be brentuximab vedotin-naïve (Coh ort A), or may have had 
prior brentuximab vedotin treatment as a salvage therapy after failure of ASCT (Cohort B). In 
addition to Cohorts A and B, a third cohort (Cohor t C) is being added to the study with broader 
eligibility criteria. Subjects with a treatment history of bren tuximab vedotin before first ASCT 
will not be eligible, except in Cohort C. 
The original protocol requires nivolumab dosing 3 mg/kg Q2W. Ap proximately 220 subjects 
with failure after ASCT will be t reated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV infusion over 60 minutes 
every 2 weeks until diseas e progression or unacceptable tox icity; C ohorts A and B consist of 
approximately 60 subjects each and Cohort C will treat approximately  100 subjects. 
In revised protocol 04c , subjects w ill switch to IV infusion over 30 minutes of nivolu mab 480 
mg flat dose Q4W or 240 mg flat dose Q2W. For those subjects re ceiving a 480 mg flat dose 
Q4W, a cycle will be a 28-dosing period. For those subjects rec eiving a 240 mg flat dose Q2W, a 
cycle will be a 14-day dosing period.Subjects will be independently e nrolled for each cohort. When o ne cohort completes enrollment, 
the other cohort w ill remain open until its comp lete accrual is reached. Primary analysis will be 
performed separately for each c ohort (ie, at separate time point s) upon completion of a pre-
specified am ount of follow-up ( Table 8.3.1.1-1 ) after last patient first treatment (LPFT). All 
analyses will be performed  separately for each  cohort upon compl etion of follow-up for the 
primary endpoint in each c ohort. In addition, safety analyses will be performed on combine d 
cohorts.Subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligib ility within 28 days prior to first 
dose. Subjects may be dosed no less than 12 days from the previous  dose during every 2-week
cycle. For every 4-week dosing cycle, subjects may be dosed with in a ± 3-day window.
The study design schematic is presented in Figure 3.1.1-1 .

Radiographical tumor assessments by computed tomography (CT) (p referred) or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) will begin at screening, then at Week 9 (±7 days) after the start of 
therapy and will continue at Weeks 17, 25, 37 and 49 for the fi rst year of treatment. 
CT (preferred) or MRI will continue every 16 weeks ( ±14 days) for the second year of 
treatment. CT (preferred) or MRI will be performed every 26 wee ks ( ±21 days) for the third 
year or beyond of treatment. [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 
(FDG-PET) scan will be required in all subjects at screening and at Weeks 17 and 25 ( ±7 days). 
Additionally, a FDG-PET scan at Week 49 ( ±7 days) is required for subjects who do not have 
two consecutive negative FDG-PET scans after Week 1 and prior t o Week 49. FDG-PET scan 
will also be required for confirmation of radiographic CR after initiation of the study drug at 
other time points when FDG-PET is not otherwise scheduled; this FDG-PET scan should be 
performed within 4 weeks of the CT scan. Tumor assessments will  follow the above schedule 
until disease progression is documented or un til the subject initiates a preparative regimen for 
allogeneic SCT or ASCT, whichever occurs earlier. If the subjec t discontinues treatment prior to 
disease progression, tumor  assessment will continue in the foll ow-up phase. In rare cases, disease 
progression is clinically determined by investigators although d isease progression does not meet 
2007 IWG criteria. In these cases, tumor assessment will not be  required if clinical disease 
progression is documented and if investigators discontinue the study drug. If the subject 
discontinues study therapy by proceeding to allogen eic SCT or ASCT, they will not undergo 
IRRC radiographic assessments described here, but will be follo wed with a specific schedule 
(see Section 5.4 ).

Revised Protocol 04c Update:
Subjects receiving nivolumab every 2 weeks at 3 mg/kg will swit ch to receive either a flat dose 
of 480 mg Q4W or a  flat dose of 240 mg Q2W. Subjects may be dose d no less than 12 days from 
the previous dose during every 2-week cycle. For every 4-week d osing cycle, subjects may be 
dosed within a ± 3-day window.
Subjects must sign an informed consent document  prior to switch ing dosing schedule.
Once a new dosing regimen has been selected for the subject, ei ther flat dose 240 mg Q2W or 
flat dose 480 mg Q4W, the dosing regimen will remain in effect until end of treatment and not 
change.Screening for Cohorts A, B, and C :
•Begins by signing the informed consent form (ICF)
•Subject is enrolled using the Interactive Vo ice Res ponse System (IVRS) t o obtain a subject 
ID
•Confirm that documen tation of cHL after fail ure of ASCT or after failure of ASCT an d 
brentuximab vedotin is present in the subject’s medical record;
•Submission of tumor tissue (formalin-fixe d, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue bloc k or 
10 unstained slides) from a biopsy performed during screening i s mandatory. If this is not 
possible, the following exceptions are allowed:
−Subjects who do not have any accessible lesions which can be sa fely biopsied, or
−Subjects who have archival tissue from a previous tumor biopsy that can be used for 
PD-L1 expression analysis. These subjects must submit archival tissue from the most 
recent tumor biopsy if archival tissues are available from tumo r biopsies at multiple time
points. While submission of archival tissue from the most r ecent tumor biopsy is 
mandatory, archival tissue from other tumor biopsy is strongly encouraged. For example, 
subjects who must submit archival tissue from a tumor biopsy at relapse may optionally 
also submit archival tissue for tum or biopsy at initial diagnosis as well.
Note: For these exceptions, the reason must be clearly documente d in the medical rec ord 
AND the BMS Medical Monit or must be con tacted. Subjects may initiate the study drug 
before the outcome of PD-L1 expression status become available.
−Biopsy samples should be excisional, incisional or core needle.
•For Cohorts A and B, confirm that a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate was performed within 
90 days prior to enrolmen t and is documented in the subject’s me dical record;
−If a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate was not performed within 90 da ys prior enrolment, a 
bone marrow biopsy/as pirate must be pe rformed during the screening period.
−If a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate needs to be performed during t he screening period, 
submission of an aspirate sample for biomarker analyses is mand atory as per Table 5.1.1-
1
−Subjects may start the study drug before bone marrow biopsy results become available; 
results of a bone marrow biopsy must be documented in the subje ct’s medical record 
when becoming available.

3.1.2 Study Design and Duration Cohort D
Cohort D is a non-comparative single-arm cohort in subjects ≥18 years old who are newly 
diagnosed, previously untreated cHL with advanced stage (Stage IIB, III and IV) 
Treatment for Cohort D consists of two phases: monotherapy and combination phases. Subjects 
will be tr eated with four doses  of nivolumab flat dose 240 mg IV every 2 weeks (monotherapy 
phase), followed by twelve doses of the combination of AVD chem otherapy and nivolumab flat 
dose 240 mg IV for 6 cycles (combination phase). The primary anal ysis for Cohort D w ill be

(Section 4.5.5 ), or subjects who meet dose delay criteria (Section 4.5.2 ) and the dose delay is > 4 
weeks from previous dose are allo wed to discontinue monotherapy  phase and enter combination 
phase when the criteria are met as described in Table 3.1.2-1.
The combination phase (approximately 22 weeks) begins from the fi rst dose of the combination 
therapy. The first dose of combination therapy should be dosed no less than 12 da ys and no more 
than 17 days after the last dose of nivolumab monotherapy. The c ombination therapy is 
administration of nivolumab ( flat dose 240 mg) and AVD (Adriamycin/ doxorubicin 25 mg/m2, 
vinblastine 6 mg/m2, dacarbazine 375 mg/m2) on the same day. Use of AVD only (without 
nivolumab) is permitted as an alternative regimen only when the conditions are met as described 
in Table 3.1.2-1. Each 28-day dosing period will constitute a Combocycle: two dos es of the 
combination therapy per cycle, except for Combocycle 6, which will only be a 15-day cycle. 
The combination therapy is administered every 2 weeks for 12 do ses (two doses, Dose 1 on 
Day 1 and Dose 2 on Day 15, of each Combocycle x 6 cycles). The combination phase will end 
at Dose 2 (Day 15) of Combocycle 6. Thereafter, subjects will ent er the Follow-up 
(FU)/Observational phase. Subjects who discontinue combination treatment before completing 
Combocycle 6 Dose 2 (Day 15) and who have not started subsequen t anti-lymphoma therapy 
will also enter the FU/Observational phase.

For Cohort D , radiographical tumor assessments by CT (preferred) or MRI, and FDG-PET scans 
will be required at screening. Mandatory radiographical tumor a ssessments during the treatment 
are as follows:
•Post-Monotherapy dose 4 assessments : FDG-PET scan and CT (preferred) or MRI after 
Monotherapy dose 4 and before en tering the Combination phase. 
•Post-Combocycle 2 assessments : FDG-PET scan* and CT (preferred) or MRI after 
Combocycle 2 and before Combocycle 3.
*Interim FDG-PET scans are optional if a previous scheduled or u nscheduled FDG-PET scan 
after the first dose of nivolumab monotherapy was negative base d on investigator’s 
assessment.
The end-of-therapy radiographic tumor assessments should be done at 9 weeks ( ±14 days) 
from the last treatment). End-of-therapy FDG-PET, and CT (prefe rred) or MRI scans are 
mandatory in all subjects. When end-of-therapy FDG-PET scans are  positive based on 
investigator’s assessment, tumor biopsy for FDG-avid lesion is strongly encouraged whenever 
possible. Bone marrow assessment is not required for CR determin ation as FDG-PET can be 
used in lieu of bone marrow aspirate/ biopsy.
After the end-of-therapy radiographic tumor assessments, no FDG -PET scan is required unless 
clinically indicated. CT (preferred) or MRI scans should be con ducted at 39 weeks ( ±21 days), 
65 weeks ( ±21 days), and 104 weeks ( ±21 days) from the last dose for the sub jects who enter 
the FU/Observational phase. Thereafter, no radiographic tumor a ssessment is required.
Treatment beyond investigator-assessed progression is permitted  in the circumstances specified 
in Section 4.5.7
Study Duration for Cohort D
Analysis of the primary endpoints  will take place after the las t patient for Cohort D completes 
Follow-up visit 1 and the end-of-therapy response assessment. A dditional surviv al analysis will 
be conducted for up to five years from the last dose of study tr eatment.
For most subjects, this study will consist of four phases: screening, monotherapy phase, 
combination phase, and FU/Observational phase (max. 2 years). After two years in the FU/Observational phase, if no relapse is observed, those Cohort  D subjects will enter the survival 
follow-up phase for up to five year s from the last dose of study  treatment.
Screening for Cohort D

•Confirm that documentation of cH L newly diagnosed, previously untreated, advanced stage 
(Stage IIB, III and IV) by Cotswold modified Ann Arbor staging88is present in the subject’s 
medical record; documen tation of cHL histology  by a local patholog ical laboratory is 
sufficient for subject to start the first dose. Histology of cH L will be confirmed later by a 
central pathological laboratory.
•Submission of tumor tissue (FFPE tumor tissue block or at minim um 15 unstained slides, 
preferably 20) from a biopsy performed during screening is mand atory. Alternatively, 
submission of tumor tissue from a biopsy performed within 90 days prior to enrollment is 
allowed. A central laboratory will confirm the pathology, but su bjects can proceed to the 
study drug with documentation of c HL by a local pathology labor atory.
•Bone marrow biopsy/aspirate is  not required for Cohort D. An aspirate sample does not need 
to be submitted if conducted as a standard of care.
•The Hasenclever-Index for Hodgkin’s disease also known as Inter national Prognostic Score 
(IPS) must be reported in the source documents and collected in  the eCRF. (See Appendix 3 )
•Evaluation for pulmonary and cardiac functions will be required .
Baseline assessments s hould be performed within 28 days of first dose of study drug, according 
to Table 5.1.2-1. 
•Subject is assessed for study eligibility within the required t imeframe found in Table 5.1.2-1
•The screening phase either ends with confirmation of full eligi bility and tr eatment of the 
subject or with the confirmation that the subject is a screen failure.
Treatment During the Monotherapy Phase for Cohort D
•Treatment begins with the call to the IVRS to obtain v ial assignments. A negative pregnancy 
test should be documented within 24 hours prior to first dose o f investigational product. 
Subsequently, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have  a pregnancy test every 
4 weeks ( ±7 days) regardless of dosing schedule.
•The subject should receive the dose of study medication within 1 day of vial assignment.
•Subjects may be dosed no less than 12 days between doses and no more than 3 days after the 
scheduled dosing date. Dose given after the 3-day window is con sidered a dose delay. 
A maximum delay of 6 weeks between doses is allowed, except as specified in Section 4.5.5 . 
When the dose delay is > 4 weeks from a previous nivolumab dose f or subjects in the 
monotherapy phase, discontinuing the monotherapy phase and ente ring the combination

Sections 5.5 and 5.6.
•Nivolumab monotherapy (flat dose 240 mg) is administered as an I V infusion over 30
minutes on Treatment D ay 1 of each Monothera py dose. The planned total dose is four doses 
of nivolumab flat dose 240 mg every two weeks. The monotherapy w ill continue until 
completing four doses, or until disease progression, discontinuat ion due to toxicity, with 
withdrawal of study consent, or the study ends. Nivolumab dosin g may be delayed for

Selection of Combination Therapy during Combination phase (See Table 3.1.2-1 ):
•Subjects who have completed all four doses of nivolumab monothe rapy must use 
Nivolumab-AVD as a combination regimen. 
−After entering Combination phase, the combination regimen can b e changed to AVD if 
subjects meet Nivolumab Delay Criteria ( Section 4.5.2.1 ) or Nivolumab 
Discontinuation Criteria ( Section 4.5.5 ).
•Subjects who have discontinued monotherapy before completing fo ur doses of nivolumab 
due to Nivolumab Discontinuation criteria (Section 4.5.5) must us e AVD as a combination 
regimen for all six Combocycles. 
•Subjects who have discontinued monotherapy before completing fo ur doses of nivolumab 
due to Nivolumab Delay Criteria (Section 4.5.5), and due to the dose delay > 4 weeks from 
a previous dose must use AVD as a combination regimen until subjects meet Cri teria to 
Resume Nivolumab Dosing (Section 4.5.4 ). 
−If subjects meet Criteria t o Resume Nivolumab Dos ing (Section 4.5.4) be fore or at the
first dose of the combination therapy, Nivolumab-AVD s hould be use d. AVD may be 
optionally used based on investigat or’s judgment.
−Nivolumab-AVD can be used later once subjects meet Criteria to Resume Nivolumab 
Dosing (Section 4.5.4). Based on investigator s’ judgment, continuing AVD through 
the end of Combocycle 6 is also acceptable.
Treatment During Combination Phase for Cohort D:
•The subject should receive the  dose of study medication within 1 day of vial assignment.
•All vital signs starting after Combocycle 1 will be collected w ithin 72 hours prior to dosing. 
•Combination phase (approximately 22 weeks) begins from the first  dose of the combination 
therapy (Dose 1 of Combocycle). 
•Dose 1 of Combocycle 1 will be administered with AVD (Adriamycin /doxorubicin 
25 mg/m2, vinblastine 6 mg/m2, dacarbazine 375 mg/m2) with or without nivolumab (flat 
dose 240 mg) on Day 1 of Combocycle 1. AVD only (without nivolumab ) is permitted as an 
alternative regimen only when the conditions are met as describ ed above and in Table 3.1.2-

visits and the end-of-therapy radiographic tumor assessments wi ll no longer be necessary. 
These subjects will enter survival follow-up (every 6 months) o nce subsequent anti-
lymphoma therapy begin.
•The combination therapy should be administered every 2 weeks for  12 doses (two doses per 
Combocycle). If this is not feasible, subjects may be dosed no less than 12 days between 
doses and no more than 3 days after the scheduled dosing date. A dose given after the 3 day 
window is considered a dose delay. Dosing delay or dose reductio n (except for nivolumab) is 
allowed for toxicity. See Sections 4.5.2 and 4.5.3 .
•Nivolumab should be a dministered first before AVD administratio n when Nivolumab-AVD 
is the combination therapy. 
•Administration method and sequence of each component of AVD (doxorubicin, vinblastine, 
and dacarbazine) will be according to local and institutional s tandards. Dosing calculations 
should be based on the body surface area (BSA) and calculated u sing the body weight of first 
dose of the combination phase. However, if the subject’s weight  later changes by > 10% 
from the previous weight used to calculate BSA, then BSA should  be recalculated and AVD 
dose corrected accordingly. All doses should be rounded to the n earest milligram. 
•Extended on-study local laboratory assessments should be done w ithin 72 hours prior to 
dosing at each Dose 1 ( Day1) of Combocycle 1 -6, and Dose 2 (Day 15) of Com bocycle 1
•Limited on-study local laboratory assessment should be done wit hin 72 hours prior to dosing

•Intrauterine devices (IUDs)c
•Bilateral tubal ligation 
•Vasectomized partner
−NOTE: A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method 
provided that the partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective 
method of contraception should be used.
•Sexual abstinence
−NOTE: Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined 
as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the participant.
−It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception wh en complete 
abstinence is elected.
−WOCBP subjects who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy tests as specified per protocol.
−Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed 
in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstin ence.
NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may differ from those when used consi stently and correctly. Use should be 
consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in 
clinical studies. 
bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with t he study drug, which may reduce the 
efficacy of the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient 
evidence that the IMP a nd other st udy med ications w ill not alter hormonal exposures such that 
contraception would be ineffective or result in increased expos ures that could be potentially hazardous. In 
this case, alternative methods of contraception should be utilized. 
cIntrauterine devices and intrauterine hormone releasing systems  are acceptable methods of contraception in 
the absence of definitive drug interaction studies when hormone exposures from intrauterine devices do not alter contraception effectiveness.
UNACCEPTABLE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
•Diaphragm with spermicide
•Cervical cap with spermicide
•Vaginal sponge with spermicide
•Male or female condom with or without spermicide. Male and fema le condoms cannot be 
used simultaneously.
•Progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the 
primary mechanism of action
•Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, pos t-ovulation me thods)
•Withdrawal (coitus interruptus)
•Spermicide only

Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any femal e who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hyst erectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy) and is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in 
a woman over age 45 years in the absence of other biological or  physiolo gical causes. In 
addition, women under the age of 55 years must have a serum fol licle stimulati ng hormone, 
(FSH) level  > 40mIU/mL to confirm  menopause.*

*Women treated with hormone replacement therapy, (HRT) are like ly to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may r equire a washout period in order to obtain a  physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a functi on of the type of H RT used. The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the inves tigators should use their 
judgment in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level i s > 40 mIU/ml at any time 
during the washout period, the woman can be considered postmeno pausal:
•1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
•4 week minimum for transdermal products
•8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long a s 6 months.
3.4 Concomitant Treatments
3.4.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments
The following medications are prohibited during the study:
•Immunosuppressive agents (except to treat a drug-related AE).
•Systemic corticosteroids > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent (e xcept as stated in 
Section 3.3.2 or to treat a drug-related AE), except for Cohort D. 
•Any live/attenuated  vaccine (eg, varicella, z oster, yellow feve r, rotavirus, oral polio, and 
measles, mumps, rubella [MMR]) during treatment and until 100 d ays post last dose.
Any concurrent antineoplastic therapy (ie, chemotherapy, hormon al therapy, immunotherapy, 
radiation therapy except for p alliative radiatio n therapy, or standard or investigational agents for 
treatment of cancer), except for Cohort D. Protocol defined che motherapy (doxorubicin, 
vinblastine, and dacarbazine) is permitted in Cohort D.
Supportive care for disease-related symptoms may be offered to all subjects on the trial.
3.4.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
3.4.2.1 Permitted Therapy
Subjects are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra-articular,  intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (wi th minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic  replacement doses of systemic 
corticosteroids are permitted, even if > 10 mg/day prednisone eq uivalents. A brief course of 
corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or f or treatment of non-autoimmune 
conditions (eg, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused b y contact allergen) is permitted.
Concomitant medications are r ecorded at bas eline a nd throughout  the treatment phase of the 
study in the appropr iate section of the case report form (CRF).  All medications (prescriptions or 
over the counter medications) con tinued at the start of the stu dy or started during the study and

different from the study drug must be documented in the concomi tant therapy section of the 
CRF.
3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects following any Treatment with Stu dy Drug 
Subjects MUST discontinue inve stigational product (and non-inve stigational product at the 
discretion of the investigator) for a ny of the following reasons:
•Disease progression as determined by investigator assessment fo llowing the guidelines given 
in Section 5.4.6 with the exception described in Section 4.5.7 .
•Subject’s request to stop study treatment
•Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality  or intercurrent illness which, in the 
opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participati o n  i n  t h e  s t u d y  i s  n o t  i n  t h e  
best interest of the subject
•Termination of the study by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS)
•Loss of ability to fr eely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily inca rceration 
for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectio us disease) illness
•Additional protocol-specific reasons for discontinuation (See Section 4.5.5 ).
In the case of pregnancy, the investigator must immediately not ify the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee of this event. In the event a normal healthy f emale subject becomes pregnant 
during a clinical trial, the study drug must be discontinued im mediately. In most cases, the study 
drug will be permanently discontinued in an a ppropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary 
for subject safety). Please call the BMS Medical Monitor within  24 hours of awareness of the 
pregnancy. If the investigator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants 
continuation of study drug, a discussion between the investigat or and the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee must occur
All subjects who discontinue study drug should comply with prot ocol specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in Section 5 . The only exception to this requirement is when a subject 
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post-treat ment study follow-up or loses the 
ability to c onsent freely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily i ncarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psychiatric or physical illness).If study drug is discontinued prior to the subject’s completion  of the study, the reason for the 
discontinuation must be documented in the subject’s medical rec ords and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.
3.6 Post Study Drug Follow up
For Cohorts A, B, and C, ORR and DOR are key endpoints of the st udy. For all cohorts, post 
study drug follow-up is of critical importance and is essential  to preserve subject safety and the 
integrity of the study. Subjects who discontinue study drug mus t continue to be followed for 
collection of outcome and/or s urvival follow-up data as required and in line with Section 5 un til 
death, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, or the conclus ion of the study.

In addition, for Cohorts A, B, and C, subjects who discontinue s tudy therapy by proceeding to 
allogeneic SCT or ASCT will requi re tumor assessment (CR or non -CR) by the investigators 
according to the 2007 IWG criteria on Day 100, at 6 months, 1 y ear and every year thereafter 
from the date of stem cell infusion until the first non-CR afte r SCT is documented (see 
Section 5.4 ). For the subjects who discontinue study therapy by proceeding  to allogeneic SCT, 
documentation of acute and chronic GVHD will be simultaneously collected (see Section 5.3 ).
For Cohort D, if subjects have disease progression during study treatment, or have relapse 
disease after the end of study treatment, limited i nformation of anti-lymphoma salvage tr eatment 
will be collected along with survival status Table 5.1.2-4 .
BMS may request that survival data be collected on all tr eated sub jects outside of the protocol 
window ( section 5.1 ). At the time of this reque st, each s ubject w ill be con tacted to determine 
their survival status unless the subject has withdrawn consent for all contacts  or is lost to follow 
up.
3.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to discontinue study drug will remain in t he study and must continue to be 
followed for protocol specified follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a 
subject specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously 
authorized by subject to provide this information. Subjects sho uld notify the investigator of the 
decision to withdraw consent from future follow-up in writing , whenever possible. The 
withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medi cal records by the investigator, as 
to whether the withdrawal is from further treatment with study drug only or also from study 
procedures and/or post treatment study follow-up, and entered o n the appropriate CRF page. In 
the event that vital status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly 
available information s hould be used to d etermine vital status only as appropriately d irected in 
accordance with local law.
3.6.2 Lost to Follow-Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to deter mine and report their ongoing 
status. This includes follow-up with persons authorized by the subject as noted above. Lost to 
follow-up is defined by the inability to reach the subject afte r a minimum of three documented 
phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by su bject to one registered mail letter. 
All attempts should be documented in the sub ject’s medical records. If it is determined that the 
subject has died, the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.
If investigator’s use of third-party representative to assist i n the follow-up portion of the study 
has been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the i nvestigator may use a Sponsor-
retained third-party representative to assist site staff with o btaining subject’s contact information 
or other public vital status data necessary to complete the fol low-up porti on of the s tudy. The site 
staff and representative will consult publicly available source s, such as public h ealth registries 
and databases, in order to obtain updated contact i nformation. If after all attempts, the subject

4.1 Investigational Product
An investigational product, als o known as investigational medic inal product in some regions, is 
defined a pharmaceut ical form of an active substance or pl acebo being tested or used as a 
reference in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used 
or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently than the autho rized form, or used for an 
unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further informati on about the authorized form.
The investigational product s hould be stored in a secure area according to local regulations . It is 
the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that investiga tional product is only dispensed to 
study subjects. The investigatio nal product must be dispensed o nly from official study sites by 
authorized personnel according to local regulations. 
In this protocol, investig ational product(s) is/are: 
•BMS-936558 (nivolumab) for Cohorts A, B, C, and D
•Dacarbazine for Cohort D
•Doxorubicin for Cohort D
•Vinblastine for Cohort D.

For Cohort D, for the drugs used during the combination phase ( AVD), refer to SmPC or USPI.
4.4 Method of Assigning Subject Identification
After the subject’s initial eligibility is established and info rmed consent has been obtained, the 
subject must be enrolled into the study by calling an IVRS to o btain the subject number. Every 
subject that signs the informed consent form must be assigned a  subject number in IVRS. 
Specific instructions for using IVRS will be provided to the in vestigational site in a separate 
document. 
The investigator (or designee) will register the subject for en rollment by following the 
enrollment procedures established by BMS. The following informa tion is required for 
enrollment:
•Date of informed consent
•Date of birth
•Gender at birth
•Prior Brentuximab vedotin exposure (Cohorts A, B, and C, only).
•Prior anti-lymphoma treatment history (Cohort D).
4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Cohorts A, B and C eligible subjects will receive nivolumab at either a 480 mg IV flat dose Q4W 
or a 240 mg IV flat dose Q2W. Subjects s hould receive nivolumab as a 30-minute i nfusion on 
Day 1 of each treatment cycle until progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or 
the study ends, whichever occurs first. There will be no dose e scalations or reductions of 
nivolumab allowed. Once a new dosing regimen has been selected for the subject, either flat dose 
240 mg Q2W or flat dose 480 mg Q4W, t he dosing regimen will rem ain in effect until the end of 
treatment and not change. For subjects being treated with nivol umab at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks 
who switch dosing to every 4 weeks at 480 mg flat dose, the first dos e of nivolumab at 480 mg 
should be administered 2 weeks after the last 3 mg/kg Q2W dose. Cohorts A, B, and C subjects 
should be carefully monitored for infusion reactions during niv olumab administration. If an acute 
infusion reaction is no ted, subjects should be managed accordin g to Section 4.5.6 .
Cohort D subjects will receive ni volumab at a flat dose of 240 mg as a 30-minute IV infusion 
every 2 weeks. Subjects must be treated within one day after study drug vial assi gnment. There 
will be no dose escalations or reductions of nivolumab allowed.  Subjects should be carefully

Clinical Protocol CA209205
BMS-936558 nivolumab
monitored for infusion reactions during nivolumab administratio n. If an acute i nfusion reaction is 
noted, subjects should be managed according to Section 4.5.6 .
There are no premedications recommended for nivolumab on the first cycle.
Cohorts A, B, and C subjects may be dosed no less than 12 days from the previous dose during 
every 2-week cycle. Doses given after the 3-day window are considered dose delays. 
Doses of nivolumab may be interrupted, delayed, or discontinued  depending on how well the 
subject tolerates the treatment. Dosing visits are not skipped,  only delayed.
For every 4-week dosing cycle, Cohorts A, B, and C subjects may  be dosed within a ± 3-day 
window. Cohorts A, B, and C subjects receiving nivolumab every 4 weeks may be allowed to 
interrupt longer delay after discussion and written approval by  the BMS Medical Monitor, in 
subjects with expected  clinical benefit as per investigator ass essment and after resolution of any 
AE leading to dosing interruption with stable performance statu s.
For Cohorts A, B, and C, tumor assessments by CT or MRI should c ontinue as per protocol 
even if dosing is delayed.For Cohort D, tumor assessment by CT, MRI, FDG-PET should be co nducted based on 
cycles, not weeks.
Subjects will be monitored continuously for AEs while on study.  Treatment modifications 
(eg, dose delay or discontinuation) will be based on specific la boratory and AE criteria.
4.5.1 Antiemetic Premedications
Antiemetic premedicat ions should not be rou tinely administered prior to dosing of nivolumab 
monotherapy. For Cohort D, anti emetic premed ications during combination therapy is according 
to local or institutional standards. Corticosteroid use for anti emesis is permitted for the entire 
study for Cohort D. 
4.5.2 Dose Delay Criteria
4.5.2.1 Nivolumab Dose Delay Criteria
Dose delay criteria apply for all drug-related AEs. Nivolumab m ust be delayed until treatment
can resume (see Section 4.5.4 ). For Cohort D, these criteria apply both for the Monotherapy and 
Combination phases. During the Combination phase, only nivoluma b must be delayed if the AE 
is considered to be nivolumab-related, whereas AVD can be dosed  at the planned schedule per 
the protocol.
Nivolumab administration should be delayed for the following:
•Any Grade ≥2 non-skin, drug-related AE, with the following exceptions:
−Grade 2 drug-related fatigue or l aboratory abnormalities do not require a treatment delay
•Any Grade 3 skin, drug-related AE

Date: 22-Aug-2019 76
3.0 Approved 930105741 3.0v
Clinical Protocol CA209205
BMS-936558 nivolumab
•Any Grade 3 drug-related laboratory abnormality, with the follo wing exceptions for 
lymphopenia, leukopenia, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, or asymptom atic amylase or lipase:
−Grade 3 lymphopenia or leukopenia does not require dose delay.
−If a subject has a baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin that i s within normal limits , delay 
dosing for drug-related Grade ≥2 toxicity.
−If a subject has baseline AST, ALT, or total b ilirubin within the Grade 1 toxicity range, 
delay dosing for drug-related Grade ≥3 toxicity.
•Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the  judgment of the 
investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication.
4.5.2.2 Management Algorithms for Immuno-Oncology Agents
Immuno-oncology (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can d iffer in severity and duration 
than AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab is cons idered an immuno-oncology 
agent in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs  associated with 
immuno-oncology agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management  algorithms have been 
developed to assist investigators in assessing and managing the  following groups of AEs:
•Gastrointestinal
•Renal
•Pulmonary
•Hepatic
•Endocrinopathies
•Skin
•Neurological.
For subjects expected to require more than 4 weeks of corticost eroids or other 
immunosuppressants to manage an AE, consider recommendations pr ovided in the algorithms. 
These algorithms are found in the Nivolumab IB and in Appendix 1 of this protocol. Discussions 
with the BMS Medical Monit or on how to apply these al gorithms are strongly encouraged. The 
guidance provided in these algorithms should not rep lace the Investigator’s medical judgment 
but should complement it.
4.5.2.3 AVD Dose Delay Criteria (Only for Cohort D)
This rule applies to subjects i n Cohort D during th e combination  phase. When an investigator 
judges that dose is delayed > 21 days from a  previous dose due to an AVD-related AE, the BMS 
medical monitor should be con tacted. 
•If neutrophils < 1,500/mm3(≥Grade 1) on the day of drug administration, treatment 
(Nivolumab-AVD or AVD) can be delayed until norm alization of the values. G-CSF is

Date: 22-Aug-2019 77
3.0 Approved 930105741 3.0v
Clinical Protocol CA209205
BMS-936558 nivolumab
permitted for leucopenia or neutropenia. Prophylactic use of G- CSF is also permitted for 
subsequent treatment.
•If platelets are < 75,000/mm3(≥Grade 1) on the day of drug administration, treatment can be 
delayed until norm alization of the values.
When the causality of AE resulting in a dose delay > 21 days fro m a previous dose is not 
determined due to either nivolumab  or AVD from the Nivolumab-AV D regimen, the BMS 
medical monitor should be con tacted.
4.5.3 Doses Reductions and Escalations
In all cohorts, dose reductions and escalations of nivolumab are  not permitted.
Only for Cohort D: omitting only nivolumab from Nivolumab- AVD is per mitted during the
combination phase. When an investigator judges that a dose is d elayed > 21 days from a previous 
dose due to a nivolumab-related AE, the BMS medi cal monit or must be con tacted. Subjects who 
meet Nivolumab Delay Criteria ( Section 4.5.2.1 ) may eliminate nivolumab and use only AVD 
for the subsequent combination  treatment after  the BMS medical m onitor is consulted. If the 
subject subsequently meets Criteria to Resume Nivolumab Dosing (S ection 4.5.4), the regimen 
may be changed back to Nivolumab-AVD, after the BMS medical moni tor is consulted again. 
Dose interruption of nivolumab > 6 weeks during combination phas e is permitted. Skipped 
nivolumab doses will not be compensated. 
Only for Cohort D : each component of AVD s hould reduce its dose when subjects are treated 
with AVD or Nivolumab-AVD during combination phase, as follows:
•If ≥Grade 3 febrile neut ropenia is observed, the dose of doxorubicin and vinblastine ca n be 
reduced by up to 50% redu ction for s ubsequent treatment. 
•If plasma bilirubin concentration is between 1.2 - 3.0 mg/dL, the  dose of doxorubicin and 
vinblastine can be reduced by 50%.
•If plasma bilirubin concentration is > 3.0 - 5.0 mg/dL, the dose o f doxorubicin and 
vinblastine can be reduced by 75%.
•If ≥Grade 2 peripheral motor neuropathy, or/and if ≥Grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy 
is observed, the dose of vinblastine can be reduced by up to 50 % reduction for subsequent 
treatment.
When AVD is delayed, nivolumab should also be delayed.
The BMS medical monit or should be contacted when dose is reduced regardless of the causality.
4.5.4 Criteria to Resume Nivolumab Dosing
Subjects may resume treatment with nivolumab when the drug-rela ted AE(s) resolve to 
Grade≤1 or baseline value, with the following exceptions:
•Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigu e

•Subjects who have not experience d a Grade 3 drug-related skin A E may resume treatment in 
the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity 
•Subjects with baseline AST/ALT or total bilirubin in the Grade 1 toxicity range who require 
dose delays for reasons other than a 2-grade shift in AST/ALT o r total bilirubin may resume 
treatment in the presence of Grade 2 AST/ALT OR total bilirubin
•Subjects with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT AND total bilirubin value s meeting 
discontinuation parameters (Section 4.5.5) should have treatment  permanently discontinued
•Drug-related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis must have  resolved to baseline before 
treatment is resumed
•Drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only p hysiologic hormone 
replacement may resume treatment.
If the criterion to resume tr eatment is met, the subject should  restart treatment at the next 
scheduled time point per protocol.
If treatment is d elayed > 6 weeks, the subject must be permanently discontinued from study 
therapy, except as specified in Section 4.5.5.
For Cohort D, these criteria a pply both for the monotherapy and  combination phases. During the 
combination phase, when only nivolumab is delayed due to nivolu mab-related AE, nivolumab 
can be resumed in combination with AVD if these resuming criter ia are met. Withholding dose 
of nivolumab for > 6 weeks during the combination phase is permitt ed.
4.5.5 Nivolumab Discontinuation Criteria
Nivolumab treatment should be permanently discontinued for the following:
•Any Grade 2 drug-related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not respond to 
topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within  the re-treatment period OR 
requires systemic treatment 
•Any Grade 3 non-skin, drug-related AE lasting > 7 days, with th e following exceptions for 
drug-related laboratory a bnormalities, drug -related uv eitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, 
hypersensitivity reactions, and infusion reactions:
−Grade 3 drug-related uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, hypers ensitivity reaction, or 
infusion reaction of any duration requires discontinuation
−Grade 3 drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled wit h only physiologic 
hormone replacement do not require discontinuation
−Grade 3 drug-related laboratory a bnormalities do not require treatment discontinuation 
except:

(Adrenocorticotropic Hormone) deficiency, hyper- or hypothyroidosis, or glucose 
intolerance, which resolve or are adequately controlled with ph ysiologic hormone 
replacement (steroids, thyroid horm ones) or glucose controlling agents, respectively, may 
not require discontinuation after discussion with and approval from the BMS Medical 
Monitor
•Any dosing delay lasting > 6 weeks from the previous dose with t he following exceptions:
−Dosing delays to allow for prolonged steroid tapers to manage drug-related adverse 
events are allowe d. Prior to re-initiating treatment in a subje ct with a dosing delay lasting 
> 6 weeks, the BMS medical monitor must be consulted. Tumor ass essments should 
continue as per protocol even if dosing is delayed. 
−Dosing delays > 6 weeks that occur for non-drug-related reasons may be allowed if 
approved by the B MS medical monit or. Prior to re-initiating treatment in a subject with a 
dosing delay lasting > 6 weeks, the BMS medical monitor must be consulted. Tumor 
assessments should continue as per protocol even if dosing is d elayed.
−Withholding dosing for > 6 weeks during combination phase (only for Cohort D).
•Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the s ubject with continued nivolumab 
dosing.
•Disease progression as determined by investigator assessment fo llowing the guidelines given 
in Section 5.4.6 with the exception described in Section 4.5.7 . For Cohort D, subjects who 
discontinued nivolumab monotherapy due to 2007 IWG criteria-met  disease progression 
based on investigators’ assessment during the Monotherapy phase are allowed to enter the 
Combination phase when AVD is used as a combination therapy. Fo r Cohort D, subjects who 
had 2007 IWG criteria-met disease progression based on investig ators’ assessment and who 
had treatment beyond progression during the Monotherapy phase ar e allowed to use 
Nivolumab-AVD combination therapy during the Combination phase.
•Subject who initiated the preparative regimen for allogeneic SC T or ASCT after the first dose 
of nivolumab treatment.

•Initiation of antineoplastic therapy (ie, chemotherapy, hormona l therapy, immunotherapy, 
radiation therapy except for pa lliative radiatio n therapy, or s tandard or investigational agents 
for treatment of cancer).
•Cohort C subjects who have persistent CR for 1 year will discont inue the study drug when 
CR is confirmed by CT (preferred) or MRI. Please refer to section 3.1 .
For Cohort D, these criteria apply both for monotherapy and comb ination phases. 
During monotherapy phase, subjects who meet Nivolumab Delay Cri teria ( Section 4.5.2 ) may 
enter the combination phase when nivolumab monotherapy requires  dose delay > 4 weeks from a 
previous dose after the BMS medical monitor is consulted.
During combination phase, if nivolumab meet one of these discon tinuation criteria due to 
nivolumab-related AE, nivolumab must be permanently discontinue d, whereas AVD can be 
dosed as planned.
4.5.5.1 Discontinuation of Nivolumab Monotherapy During Monotherapy Phase 
of Cohort D
Subjects who meet Nivolumab Discontinuation Criteria ( Section 4.5.5 ) may enter the 
combination phase if AVD only (without nivolumab) is used as the combination therapy. The 
BMS medical monitor should be contacted befor e starting AVD. These s ubjects are not allowed 
to use the combination of nivolumab and AVD (See Table 3.1.2-1 ). 
When nivolumab monotherapy dose delays are > 4 weeks from a prev ious dose, the BMS 
medical monitor should be contacted. Withholding dosing of nivol umab monotherapy is 
permitted up to 6 weeks. However, based on the investigator’s j udgment, subjects who meet 
Nivolumab Delay Criteria ( Section 4.5.2.1 ) may also enter the combination phase if nivolumab 
monotherapy dose delay > 4 weeks from a previous dose after the BMS medical monitor is 
consulted.
•If subjects meet Criteria to Resume Nivolumab Dosing ( Section 4.5.4 ) before or when they 
enter combination phase, the combination of nivolumab and AVD s hould be used. However, 
based on investigators’ judgment, AVD only (without nivolumab) ma y be used (See Table 
3.1.2-1).
•If subjects do not meet Criteria to Resume Nivolumab Dosing (Se ction 4.5.4) when they 
enter combination phase, AVD only (without nivolumab) must be u sed. If subjects 
subsequently meet Criteria to Resume Nivolumab Dosing (Section 4 .5.4), the regimen may 
switch from AVD only to the combin ation of nivolumab and AVD, aft er the BMS medical 
monitor is consulted. For example, a subject who has started Co mbocycle 1 with AVD only 
may start using the combina tion of nivolumab and AVD from Combocycle 4 after discussion 
with the BMS medical monitor. Based on investigator s’ judgment, continuing AVD only
through the end of Combocycle 6 is also acceptable (See Table 3. 1.2-1).

4.5.5.2 Discontinuation of Nivolumab from the Combination Therapy During 
Combination Phase for Cohort D
Subjects who meet Nivolumab Discontinuation Criteria ( Section 4.5.5 ) due to a 
nivolumab-related AE must eliminate nivolumab, and must use AVD only for the subsequent 
combination treatment after the BMS med ical monitor is consulted. The use of nivolumab as a 
part of the combination is no longer allowed (See Table 3.1.2-1 ).
4.5.6 Treatment of Nivolumab Related Infusion Reactions
Since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequ ences, it is unlikely to be 
immunogenic and induce an infusion or hypersensitivity r eaction. However, if such a reaction 
were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, he adache, rash, pruritis, arthralgias, 
hypo- or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other allergic-like reactions. All Grade 3 or 4 i nfusion 
reactions should be reported wit hin 24 hours to the BMS Medical  Monitor and reported as an 
SAE if criteria are met. Infusio n reactions shoul d be graded acc ording to National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (Version 4.0) 
guidelines.
Treatment recommendations  are provided below and may be modifie d based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms : (Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; interven tion not 
indicated)
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from sympt oms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are recommended for future i nfusions: diphe nhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen ) at least 30 minutes before 
additional nivolumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms : (Moderate reaction requires therapy or i nfusion inte rruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihis tamines, non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodil ators, IV fluids]; prophylactic 
medications indicated for ≤24 hours).
Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal sal ine, and treat the subject with 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325  to 1000 mg (acetaminophen); 
remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of sympt oms. Corticosteroid or 
bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate.  If the infusion is interrupted, 
restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no further 
complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased  to 100% of the original infusion 
rate. Monitor subject closely . If symptoms recur then no further nivolumab will be administered 
at that visit. Administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and remain at bedside and monitor the 
subject until resolution of symptoms. The am ount of st udy drug i nfused must be  recorded on the 
electronic case report form (eCRF). The following prophylactic premedications are 
recommended for future  infusions: di phenhydramine 50 mg (or equi valent) and/or paracetamol 
325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophe n) should be administered at least 30 minutes before additional

BMS-936558 nivolumab
nivolumab administrations. If necessary, corticosteroids (recom mended dose: up to 25 mg of IV 
hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used.
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms: (Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonge d [ie, not rapidly 
responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of 
symptoms following initial improvement; hospitalization indicat ed for other  clinical sequelae 
[eg, renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]). Grade 4: (life-t hreatening; pressor or ventilatory 
support indicated).
Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab. Begin an IV infu sion of normal saline, and treat 
the subject as follows. Recommend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 
solution for subcutaneous adminis tration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a  1:10,000 solution injected slowly 
for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with met hylprednisolone 100 mg IV 
(or equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that 
the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab will be permanently disc ontinued. Investigators should 
follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anap hylaxis. Remain at bedside and 
monitor subject until recovery from  symptoms. In the case of la te-occurring hypersensitivity 
symptoms (eg, appearance of a l ocalized or ge neralized pruritis  within 1 week after treatment), 
symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral antihistamine, or c orticosteroids).
4.5.7 Treatment Beyond Disease Progression
4.5.7.1 Circumstances in which Post-progression Treatment is Permitted
Subjects meeting progression defined by relapsed disease (after  CR) or progressive disease (after 
PR, SD) per 2007 IWG criteria may continue receiving study medic ation beyond investigator-
assessed progression as long as they meet the following criteri a:
•Investigator-assessed clinical benefit and do not have rapid dis ease progression 
•Stable performance status 
•Treatment beyond progression will not d elay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression 
•Subjects will be re-consented with an informed consent document describing any reasonably 
foreseeable risks or discomfort and other alternative treatment  options 
•Tolerance of study drug. 
The decision to continue treatment beyond investigator-assessed  progression should be discussed 
with the BMS Medical Monitor and documented in the study record s. Subjects for Cohorts A, B, 
and C should continue to meet all other study protocol eligibility criteria. Treatment be yond 
disease progression is permitted for subjects in Cohort D only during the monotherapy phase. 
The assessment of clinical benef it should take into account whe ther the subject is clinically 
deteriorating and unlikely to receive further benefit from cont inued treatment.

4.5.7.2 Assessment Schedule for the Subjects with Post-progression 
Treatment
The subject should continue to receive monitoring according to the On-Treatment Assessments 
on Table 5.1.1-2 except for FDG-PET scans. Radiogra phic assessment by CT (preferr ed) or MRI 
described in Section 5.4.1 and Table 5.4.1.1-1 are required when subjects continue 
post-progression tr eatment. FDG-PET scans are not m andated after investigator-asse ssed 
progression.
4.5.7.3 Discontinuation due to “Further Progression”
Subjects should discontinue study therapy upon evidence of further progression, defined as an 
additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume from time of initial progression 
(including all target lesions and new measurable lesions). 
•Further progression is evaluated by a subsequent CT or MRI whic h is performed at least 
8 weeks from previous CT or MRI.
•The tumor burden volume from time of initial progression should be used as the reference 
baseline for comparison with the post-progression assessment.
•New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial pr ogression if the long axis is 
more than 15 mm regardless of the short axis. If a lymph node has a long axis of 11 to 
15 mm, it should only be considered measurable if its short axis is more than 10 mm.
•Any new lesion considered non-measurable at the time of or afte r initial progression may 
become measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden de termination.
4.5.7.4 Radiographic Assessment for the Subjects who Discontinue Study 
Drug during Post-progression Treatment
When subjects stop post-progression tr eatment, no additional radiographic assessment w ill be 
required and they will continue in the follow-up phase of the s tudy (see Section 5.1 ). The 
subjects who proceed to allogeneic SCT or ASCT w ill be followed with specific schedule (see 
Section 5.4 ).
4.5.8 Re-Initiation of Study Therapy for Cohort C subjects
As described in Section 4.5.5 , subjects in Cohort C w ill discontinue study therapy after 
maintaining CR for one year. If subjects relapse within 2 years from last dose, subjects may 
reinitiate study therapy. Relapse must meet 2007 IWG criteria b ased on investigators’ 
assessment, and must be clearly documented in the medical recor d AND the BMS Medical 
Monitor must be contacted. Re-initiation of treatment after rel apse is not mandatory, should a 
subject chose not to re-initiate treatment, this subject will c ontinue to be followed every three 
months for survival.
Subjects re-initiating study therapy should continue to meet eligibility criteria at the time st udy 
drug resumes. FDG-PET is not mandated if FDG-avid disease was p reviously proved. 
Pulmonary function test is not required if DLCO was previously over 60% (adjusted for

hemoglobin) at initial enrollment and if no drug-related pulmonary toxicity was reported during 
the study therapy. Re-initiation of study therapy is not allowe d for subjects who proceeded to 
ASCT or allogeneic SCT, and for subjects who initiated other an ti-neoplastic therapy after study 
drug discontinuation. Re-initiation of treatment procedures are  described in Table 5.1.1-5 .
When subjects achieve second on -study CR by re-initiation of st udy drug, subjects do not have to 
discontinue the study drug when second on-study CR persists for 1 year.
Additional safety and efficacy summaries will be presented for those subjects who reinitiated 
study therapy.
4.5.9 Guidelines for Assessment and Initial Management of Tumor Lysis 
Syndrome
The possibility of tumor lysis syndrome cannot be ruled out for  the subjects with lymphoma. 
Therefore, adequate management such as hydration and/or the use  of allopurinol is 
recommended in the subjects who have risk factor of potential t umor lysis syndrome, for 
example the subjects with high tumor burden, reflected by high serum LDH levels, or bulky 
disease, or those with preexisting renal failure.
4.6 Blinding/Unblinding
Not applicable.
4.7 Treatment Compliance
Treatment compliance will be monitored by drug accountability a s well as the subject’s medical 
record and CRF.
4.8 Destruction of Study Drug
For this study, study drugs (those supplied by BMS or sourced b y the investigator) such as 
partially used study drug containers, vials and syringes may be  destroyed on site. 
Any unused study drugs can only be destroyed after being inspected and reconciled by the 
responsible Study Monitor unless study drug containers must be immediately destroyed as 
required for safety, or to meet local regulations (eg, cytotoxi cs or biologics). 
On-site destruction is allowed provided the following minimal s tandards are met:
•On-site disposal practices must not expose humans to risks from  the drug.
•On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agr eement with applicable laws and 
regulations, including any special requirements for controlled or hazardous substances.
•Written procedures for on-site disposal are available and follo wed. The procedures must be 
filed with the site’s SOPs and a copy  provided t o BMS upon reque st.

5.3 Safety Assessments
5.3.1 Safety Assessments for Cohorts A, B, and C
At baseline, a medical history w ill be ob tained to capture relevant underlying conditions. The 
baseline examinations  should include weight, height, ECOG Performance Status, BP, HR, 
temperature and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry at rest and  after exertion and should be 
performed within 28 days prior to first dose as described in Ta ble 5.1.1-1 notes. Baseline signs 
and symptoms are those that are assessed within 14 days prior t o first dose. Concomitant 
medications will be  collected from within 14 days  prior to first dose through t he study treatment 
period. Additionally, medications which are used to treat AEs th at are late emergent will be 
captured beyond the last dose for study treatment.
Baseline local laboratory assessments s hould be done w ithin 14 days prior to first dose to 
include: CBC w/differential, LFTs (ALT, AST, total bilirubin, a lkaline phosphatase), uric acid,

BUN or serum urea level, creatinine, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, P, LDH,  glucose, albumin, amylase, 
lipase, urinalysis, TSH, and Hep B and C testing (HBV sAg, HCV Ab or HCV RNA) (see Table 
5.1.1-1 ). Pregnancy testing for WOCBP  (done locally) must be performed  at baseline (within 
28 days prior to first dose) and repeated within 24 hours prior t o the initial administration of 
study drug, then every 4 weeks ( ±7 days) regardless  of dosing schedule.
Subjects will be evaluated for safety if they have received any study drug. Toxicity assessments 
will be continuous during the tr eatment phase. During the safety follow-up phase (Follow-up 
visits X01 and X02, Table 5.1.1-3 ) toxicity assessments should be done in person. Once subjects 
reach the survival follow-up phase either in person or document ed telephone calls to assess the 
subject’s status are acceptable.
Adverse events and laboratory values will be graded according t o the NCI-CTCAE version 4.0.
Performance status and body weight should be assessed at each o n study visit prior to nivolumab 
dosing and at Cycle 1 Day 8. Vital signs should also be taken a s per institutional standard of care 
prior to, during, and after dosing. Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry at rest a nd after exertion 
should be assessed at each on-study visit prior to nivolumab dosing. The start and stop time of 
the nivolumab infusion s hould be documented. Phys ical examinations are to be performed as 
clinically indicated. If there are any new or worsening clinically significant changes since the last 
exam, report changes on the appropriate non-serious or serious adverse event page.
On treatment local laboratory assessments should be done within  72 hours prior to dosing;
•Extended on-treatment local laboratory assessments : Cycle 1 through Cycle 5 and every 
alternate dose thereafter (Cycle 7, 9, 11, 13, etc) and include : CBC with differential, BUN or 
serum urea level, serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium,  magnesium, chloride, 
amylase, lipase, glucose, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, alkaline ph osphatase, LDH.
•Limited on-study treatment laboratory assessment : beginning at Cycle 6 and every 
alternate dose thereafter (Cycle 8, 10, 12, 14, etc) and includ e: CBC with differential, LFTs 
(ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) and creatinin e.
In addition, TSH (with reflexive Free T4 and Free T3) s hould be performed every 6 weeks 
(±7 days) from first  dose regardless of dosing schedule.
Additional measures, including non-study required laboratory te sts, should be performed as 
clinically indicated or to comply with local regulations. Labor atory toxicities (eg, suspected drug 
induced liver enzyme elevations) will be monitored during the f ollow-up phase via on site/local 
labs until all study drug-related toxicities resolve, return to  baseline or are deemed irreversible.
Oxygen saturation by pulse ox imetry should be  obtained pri or to each dose of nivolumab and at 
any time a subject has any new or worsening respiratory symptom s. A reading at rest and on 
exertion should be obtained at each time point. The extent of t he exertion should be based on the 
judgment of the investigator, but should remain consistent for each individual subject throughout 
the study. If the  subject’s status changes, the investigator ca n alter the extent of exertion based on 
their medical judgment. If a subject shows changes on pulse oxi metry or other pulmonary-related

adverse events, the subject should be immediately evaluated to rule out pulmonary toxicity. An 
algorithm f or the management of suspected pulmonary toxicity can be found in the BMS-936558 
(nivolumab) IB.
Some of the previously referred to assessments may not be captu red as data in the eCRF. They 
are intended to be used as safety monitoring by the treating ph ysician. Additional testing or 
assessments may be perform ed as clinically necessary or where r equired by institutional or local 
regulations.
For subjects who discontinue study therapy by proceeding to all ogeneic SCT, documentation 
of acute and chronic GVHD will be captured on Day 100, at 6 months, 1 year and every 
year thereafter from the date of stem cell infusion until the first non-CR after SCT is 
documented [ Appendix 5 ]. Investigators  will mak e tele phone contact with the subject’s 
hematologist /oncologist /transplant physician to obtain this i nformation if the subject is 
being followed by another physician.
When Cohort C subjects discontinue study therapy due to persistent one year CR, they will enter 
the Follow-up Phase.  Targeted  physical ex amination and laboratory tests will be conducted 
during FU/Observ ational visits ( Table 5.1.1-4 ). NSAEs and SAEs must be collected during the 
safety follow-up visits (X01 and X02) and FU/Observational visi ts for a maximum of 2 years 
and minimum of 100 days after last dose, after, only SAEs relate d to study procedures must be 
collected. These assessments should be  done in person. Once subjects complete the 
FU/Observational phase and reach the survival follow-up phase, e ither in person or documented 
telephone calls to assess the subject’s status are acceptable. I n the event of study drug 
re-initiation after relapse, subjects will have safety assessmen ts as described in Table 5.1.1-5 .
5.3.2 Safety Assessments for Cohort D
At baseline, a medical history w ill be ob tained to capture relevant underlying conditions. The 
baseline examinations  should include weight, height, ECOG Performance Status, BP, HR, 
temperature and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry at rest and  after exertion and should be 
performed within 28 days prior to first dose as described in Table 5.1.2-1 notes. Baseline signs 
and symptoms are those that are assessed within 14 days prior t o first dose. Concomitant 
medications will be collected from within 14 days prior to first dose through the study treatment 
period. Additionally, medications which are used to treat AEs th at are late emergent will be 
captured beyond the last dose for study treatment.
Only for Cohort D, evaluation for pulmonary functions test will be required during screening and 
at the end of therapy. Evaluation of cardiac fun ction by echocardi ography or nuclear medicine 
scan, and ECG will be required during screening.

5.4 Efficacy Assessments
For Cohorts A, B, and C, the primary efficacy assessment is ORR,  defined as a subject achieving 
either a PR or CR according to the revised International Workin g Group Criteria for Malignant 
Lymphoma ( Appendix 2).
For Cohort D, e fficacy assessment is conducted according to 200 7 IWG criteria (Appendix 2).
Additional assessments, for example, Deauville scoring, may als o be performed.
The primary efficacy assessment,  along with the  secondary endpo ints of DOR, complete and 
partial remission rates and durations will be based on IRRC ass essments. Assessment of ORR, 
based on investigator assessments, will be examined as a second ary endpoint. Sites are required 
to send all on-study disease assessments to the IRRC for review .
For Cohorts A, B, and C, once subjects discontinue study therapy  by proceeding to 
allogeneic SCT or ASCT, they w ill not unde rgo IRRC- radiographic  assessments as 
described in Table 5.4.1.1-1 and Table 5.4.1.1-2 . Instead, they will be evalu ated using the 
following schedule. Tumor assessment (CR or non-CR) will be assessed by the 
investigator according to the 2007 IWG criteria and will be req uired on Day 100, at 
6 months, 1 year and every year thereafter from the date of stem  cell infusion until the 
first non-CR after SCT is documented. Investigators will make t elephone contacts with the 
subject’s referring hematologist/oncologist/transplant physicia n to obtain CR or non-CR 
status and document the status if subject is being followed by another physician.
For Cohort C subjects, relapse after discontinuation of study the rapy due to persistent one year 
CR will be determined by 2007 IWG criteria. 
5.4.1 Radiographic Assessments
5.4.1.1 Radiographic Assessments for Cohorts A, B, and C
Radiographic study evaluations will take place in accordance wi th the flow charts in Section 5.1
and Table 5.4.1.1-1 and Table 5.4.1.1-2 . Baseline assessments should be performed within 
28 days prior to the first dose, utilizing CT (preferred) or MRI . In addition to chest, abdomen, 
and pelvis, all known sites of di sease should be  assessed at ba seline. A baseline FDG-PET scan 
is required at screening.
On-study assessments should incl ude chest, abdomen, and pelvis,  and all known sites of disease 
(eg neck) and should use the same imaging method as used at bas eline.
Subjects will be evaluated for tumor responses by CT (preferred ) or MRI at Week 9 ( ±7 days) 
after the start of therapy and then at Weeks 17, 25, 37 and 49 during the first year of treatment,
then every 16 weeks ( ±14 days) up to Wee k 97, continuing every 26 weeks ( ±21 days) beyond 
Week 97, until disease progression is documented, or un til the sub ject initiates a preparative 
regimen for allogeneic SCT or ASCT, whichever occurs earlier. O n-treatment FDG-PET scan 
will be required for all subjects at Weeks 17 and 25 ( ±7 days). Additionally, a FDG-PET scan at

When Cohort C subjects discontinue study therapy due to persist ent one year CR, CT (preferred) 
or MRI will be required for CR confirmation as described in Table 5.4.1.1-1 . These subjects will 
then require CT (preferred) or MRI at the time of the first FU/ Observational visit: 6 months 
(±14 days) from last dose of study drug, or if clinically indicat ed (ie clinical evidence of 
relapse). 
Relapse will be determined usi ng 2007 IWG criteria, the CT (preferred) or MRI used  for relapse 
assessment will serve as new baseline in case of re-initiation of study drug. A new set of target 
and non-target lesions will be defined and subsequent response assessment during re-initiation of 
treatment will be based on this new set. 
5.4.1.2 Radiographic Assessments for Cohort D
Radiographic study evaluations will take place in accordance wi th the flow charts in Section 5.1 ,
Table 5.4.1.2-1 and Table 5.4.1.2-2 and as shown in Figure 5.4.1.2-1 . Baseline assessments 
should be performe d prior to the first  dose, utilizing CT (preferred) or MRI. In addition to chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis, all known sites of disease should be asses sed at baseline. A baseline 
FDG-PET scan is also required at screening.
On-study assessments  should include chest, abdomen, and pelvis,  and all known sites of disease 
(eg, neck) and should use the same imaging method as used at ba seline. Tumor assessments for 
ongoing study treatment decisions will be completed by the inve stigator usi ng 2007 IWG criteria 
(Appendix 2 ).
The first scheduled on-treatment radiographic assessments are F DG-PET scans and CT 
(preferred) or MRI after Monotherapy dose 4. FDG-PET scans shoul d be scheduled at least 
4 days before the start of Combocycle 1 (4 days excluding the day  of subsequent cycle). CT 
(preferred) or MRI can be performed anytime between the monother apy Dose 4 and first 
Combocycle dose.The subjects who have early discontinuation of nivolumab during  monotherapy phase and who 
enter combination phase will require the following end-of-monot herapy radiographic 
assessments before starting the combination treatment.

5.4.2 Assessment of Overall Tumor Burden and Measurable Disease
To serially evaluate tumor response to therapy, it is necessary  to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. Measurable 
disease is defined by the presence of at least one measurable t umor lesion. Whe n CT scans have 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measu rable lesion should be twice the 
slice thickness.
At baseline, tumor lesions/lym ph nodes will be categorized as m easurable or nonmeasurable as 
follows in Sections 5.4.2.1 and 5.4.2.2 .
5.4.2.1 Measurable Lesions
Measurable lesions must be accurately measured in at least two perpendicular dimensions based 
on 2007 IWG criteria.89The following lesions should be c onsidered as measurable lesion s.
•Lesion(s) with the long axis > 15 mm regardless of the short axis , and 
•Lesion(s) with the long axis 11 - 15 mm and with short axis > 10 mm.

Date: 22-Aug-2019 120
3.0 Approved 930105741 3.0v
Clinical Protocol CA209205
BMS-936558 nivolumab
Please note that, to be eligible for this study, a subject must  have at least one lesion that is 
> 15 mm (1.5 cm) in the longest diameter on cross-sectional imagi ng and measureable in two 
perpendicular dimensions on CT (or MRI). Refer to inclusion crit eria Section 3.3.1 .
If possible, nodes or masses s hould be from disparate regions of the body and they should 
include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenev er these sites are involved.
5.4.2.2 Non-Measurable Lesions
All other lesions, incl uding small ly mph nodes (l ongest diameter < 10 mm) as well as truly non-
measurable lesions.
Lesions considered truly non-measurable include: leptomeningeal  disease, ascites, pleural or 
pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic  involvement of skin or lu ng, and 
abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable 
by reproducible imaging techniques.
5.4.3 Specifications by Method of Assessment
5.4.3.1 Measurement of Lesions
All measurements s hould be recorded in mm. All bas eline evaluations s hould be performed as 
close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 28  days before the beginning of 
treatment.
5.4.3.2 Method of Assessment
The same method of assessment a nd the same techni que should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up . Imaging based evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesi on(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by clinical 
5.4.3.3 CT or MRI Scan
CT or MRI is the best currently available and reproducible meth od to measure lesions selected 
for response assessment. Measurability of lesions on CT or MRI scan is based on the assumption 
that CT or MRI slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT scans h ave slice thickness greater than 
5 mm, the minimum size for a meas urable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. 
Note on PET/CT scans: Combined modality scanning such as with P ET/CT is increasingly used 
in clinical care. Low dose or attenuation correcti on CT portions of a combined PET/CT are of 
limited use in anatomically based efficacy assessments and it i s therefore suggested that they 
should not be substituted for dedicated diagnostic contrast enh anced CT scans for anatomically 
based measurements. However, if a site can document that the CT  performed as part of a 
PET/CT is of identical diagnosti c quality to a diagnostic CT (w ith IV and oral contrast) then the 
CT portion of t he PET/CT can be used for measurements.

Clinical Protocol CA209205
BMS-936558 nivolumab
5.4.3.4 Clinical Lesions
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they a re superficial and ≥10 mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers. As previously noted, when lesions can be evaluated both by 
clinical exam and imaging, imaging evaluation s hould be under taken since it is more objective 
and may also be reviewed by the IRRC.
5.4.3.5 FDG-PET scan
For Cohorts A, B, and C, a baseline FDG-PET scan is required for each treated sub ject at 
screening (within 28 days pri or to first  dose) and at Weeks 17 and 25 ( ±7 days). Additionally, a 
FDG-PET scan at Week 49 ( ±7 days) is required for subjects who do not have two consecutive 
negative FDG-PET scans after Week 1 and prior to Week 49. FDG-PET scan will also be 
required for confirmation of radiographic CR after initiation o f the study drug at other time
points where FDG-PET is not otherwise scheduled; this FDG-PET s can should be performed 
within 4 weeks of a CT scan.
For Cohort D, a baseline FDG-PET scan is required for each trea ted subject at screening (within 
28 days prior to first dose). Two interim FDG-PET scans are plan ned: post-monotherapy dose 4
and post-Combocycle 2. The interim FDG-PET scan post-monotherap y dose 4 is required for 
each treated subject while the interim FDG-PET scan post-Comboc ycle 2 is optional if a 
previous scheduled or unscheduled FDG-PET scan after the first dose was negative based on the 
investigator’s assessment. These  interim PET studies should be scheduled at least 4 days before 
the start of the subsequent cycle (4 days excluding the day of subsequent cycle). The end-of-
therapy FDG-PET should be conducted 9 weeks (± 14 days) from the last st udy tr eatment.
5.4.4 Baseline Documentation of “Target” and “Non-Target” Lesions
5.4.4.1 Target Lesions
At baseline, up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses meeting the criteria for 
measurable lesions given in Section 5.4.2.1 should be identified as target lesions and their 
measurements recorded.
Target lesions should be selected according to the definitions of abnormal lesio n in 2007 IWG 
criteria.
•Lesion(s) with the long axis > 15 mm regardless of the short axis, or
•Lesion(s) with the long axis 11 to 15 mm and with short axis > 10 mm.
Other measurable lesions will be designated as non-target lesio ns.
A sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) will be calculated for all target lesions and recorded 
as the baseline SPD. The baseline SPD will be used as reference to further characterize any 
objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the d isease.

Clinical Protocol CA209205
BMS-936558 nivolumab
5.4.4.2 Non-Target Lesions
All other lesions (or sites of di sease) includi ng non- measurable lymph nodes should be identified 
as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression’. In addition, it is possible to record multiple no n-target lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case report form (eg, ‘multiple e nlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
multiple liver nodules’).
5.4.5 Bone Marrow Assessments
To determine the extent of disease involvement of the bone marrow, a bone marrow 
biopsy/aspirate performed at screening or within 90 days prior to enrolment must be 
documented. Subjects may start the study drug before bone marrow biopsy results become 
available; results must be documented in the subject’s medical record when becoming available.
If a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate needs to be performed during t he screening period, an aspirate 
sample for biomarker analyses as per Table 5.6-1 must be submitted.
For subjects with marrow invo lvement at screening, a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate will be 
required to confirm a CR, and submission of bone marrow aspirat e samples is mandatory as 
detailed in Table 5.6-1 . 
For Cohorts C and D, FDG-PET at baseline can be used in lieu of a bone marrow biopsy/ 
aspirate. No evidence of FDG-avid disease in the bone marrow wi ll be required to confirm CR 
for all subjects regardless of FDG-PET results in the bone marr ow at baseline.
5.4.6 Disease Response Evaluation
The determination of disease response to study treatment will b e made using 2007 IWG criteria 
(Appendix 2).
For Cohorts C and D, bone marrow assessment will be based on 2014  Lugano classification in 
which FDG-PET can be used in lieu of bone marrow aspirate/ biopsy.90
The 2007 IWG criteria define relapsed disease or progressive dis ease based largely on the 
evaluation of nodal masses, spleen/liver, and bone marrow (Appe ndix 2). The criteria also 
stipulate that disease that is only assessable but not measurea ble (eg, pleural effusion or bone 
lesion) will be recorded as “present” or “absent”, unless such an assessable abnormality, noted 
by imaging studies or physical examination, is confirmed to be histologically negative. For 
purposes of protocol-defined disease progression, the appearanc e of new sites of assessable but 
not measureable disease while on treatment meets protocol crite ria for disease progression if 
histological results are documented (eg, the presence of lympho ma cells in a pleural effusion  or 
spinal fluid).
Immunotherapeutic ag ents produce atypical clinical response patterns which are not usually 
observed in conventional chemotherapy. Two distinct non-convent ional patterns have been 
reported: a reduction in total tumor burden despite of the appe arance of new lesion(s), and

BMS-936558 nivolumab
responses after a transit increase in total tumor burden in an initial phase, followed by subsequent 
tumor shrinkage.91These two patterns have also been recognized in the subjects wh o were 
treated with nivolumab monotherapy in the CA209039 Phase 1 stud y (Figure 1.4.3.4-1 ).
Therefore, appearance of new lesions during nivolumab monothera py may not necessarily 
indicate true disease progression alt hough this s hould be reported as disease progression 
according to 2007 IWG criteria for all four cohorts in this study.
5.5 Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Samples for pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity assessments will  be collected for all sub jects 
receiving nivolumab. Table 5.5-1 lists the sampling schedule to be followed for 
pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity for Cohorts A, B, and C. Table 5.5-2 lists the sampling 
schedule to be followed for pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity  for Cohort D. All time points 
are relative to the start of nivolumab infusion. All on-tr eatment PK time points are intended to 
align with days on which nivolumab is administered. If it is kn own that a dose is going to be 
delayed, then the predose samp le should be co llected just prior  to the delayed dose. However, if 
a predose sample is collected, but the dose is subsequently del ayed, an additional predose sample 
should not be collected. Further details of blood collection and processing will be provided in the 
procedure manual.

5.5.1 Pharmacokinetic Sample Analysis
Serum samples will be analyzed for nivolumab concentrations by a validated method. In 
addition, selected samples may be analyzed by an exploratory an alytical method that measures 
nivolumab for technology exploration purposes; exploratory resu lts will not be reported.
5.6 Biomarker Assessments
Peripheral blood and tumor tissue will be collected prior to th erapy and at selected time points on 
treatment as outlined in Table 5.6-1 for Cohorts A, B, and C and Table 5.6-2 for Cohort D, 
unless restricted by local requirements. 
Tumor Biopsy
Minimum of 1 FFPE tumor tissue block (preferred) OR minimum of 10 FFPE unstained sections 
are required for assessment of PD-L1 status and other biomarker  evaluations. For Cohort D, a 
minimum of 15 unstained slides, preferably 20, is required.Tumor samples obtained from bone metastases are not considered acceptable for PD-L1 testing 
because the PD-L1 assay does not include a decalcification step . For any cases where the only 
tumor tissue available is from a bone metastasis l esion, please  discuss further with the study

Exploratory Analysis for Tumor Biopsy during Nivolumab Monothera py in Cohort D
(Optional)
In order to assess the immune response to nivolumab therapy, patients will undergo tum or 
biopsies during screening and, optionally, at any time during th e monotherapy phase (ideally, 
approximately 3 weeks following the initiation of nivolumab mon otherapy) if the procedure is 
deemed as safe by investigators. Tumor biopsies can be either ex cisional, incisional, or core 
needle. Excisional or incisional biopsies are encouraged wheneve r possible. In addition to 
preparing a FFPE tumor tissue block or 15 unstained slides per st andard protocols, the 
remaining tumor biopsy specimen should be sent en bloc in media  on ice. Please refer to 
laboratory manual for the shipping address and procedural detai ls. Viable tumor cell suspensions 
will be prepared for comprehensive CyTOF analysis and single ce ll RNAseq. The receiving 
laboratory should be contacted on the day before the planned bi opsy procedure regarding the 
planned shipment. Please note that submission of tumor tissue (F FPE tumor tissue block or a 
minimum of 15 unstained slides , preferably 20, per standard protocols) from a biopsy performed  
during screening, or within 90 days prior to enrollment is still  mandatory for all subjects of 
Cohort D.
Bone Marrow Aspirates
For Cohorts A and B, samples from bone marrow aspirates performe d at screening and during 
CR evaluation (only for subjects who had marrow involvement at study entry) must be submitted 
for biomarker assessment. These will be utilized to assess the phenotypic and functional status of 
immune cells and tumor cells.
In all cohorts, for subjects who had bone ma rrow biopsies performed at any time during therapy, 
if clinically indicated, submission of the bone marrow aspirate s is strongly encouraged.
Bone marrow aspirates will be obt ained using institutional standards for these procedures.
A schedule of biomarkers evaluations is provided in Table 5.6-1 .
Soluble Biomarkers
Soluble factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, soluble receptors, and antibodies to tumor 
antigens will be characterize d and quantified by immunoassays i n serum. Analyses may include, 
but not necessarily be limited to, soluble CD25, soluble PD-1, soluble LAG-3, and CXCL-9.
Collected serum samples will also be used for the assessment of  tumor antigen-specific 
responses elicited follo wing treatment with study therapy to ex plore which antitumor antibodies 
are most associated with clinical response. Antibody levels to c ancer test antigens will be 
assessed by multiplex assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent as say (ELISA).
Immunophenotyping of PBMC and Bone Marrow Aspirates
The proportion of specif ic lymphocyte subsets and expression le vels of T cell co-stimulatory 
markers in PBMC preparations will be quantified by flow cytomet ry. Analyses may include, but 
not necessarily be limited to, the proportion of T, B, and NK cells, proportion of memory and 
effector T cell subsets, and expression levels of PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, ICOS, and Ki67.

Ex vivo Functional Assays
To explore whether nivolumab will restore T cell activation and function, PBMCs will be 
isolated and cryopreserved. Assays of the functional status of e ffector T cells will be performed, 
including but not limited to, assays for IFN-γ and CD107.
Peripheral Blood Gene Expression
The expression level of genes a nd miRNA related to response to nivolumab monotherapy will be 
quantified molecular methods such as Affymetrix by microarray a nd/or quantitative RT-PCR 
analysis in whole blood samples. Analysis may include, but not n ecessarily be limited t o, genes 
associated with immune-related pathways, such as T cell activation and antigen processing and 
presentation.
T cell Repertoire Analysis
Low diversity of the peripheral T cell compartment has been sho wn to correlate with poor OS in 
metastatic breast cancer. A standing theory in immuno-oncology suggests a diverse and activated 
immune environment is better adept at eradicating tumor compare d to a skewed repertoire of 
naïve and tolerized T cells. In order to explore whether a dive rse T cell repertoire is predictive of 
response to therapy, next generation, high-throughput, Deoxyrib onucleic acid (DNA) sequencing 
will be performed on DNA isolated from peripheral blood and tum or tissue to quantitate the
composition of the T cell  repertoire prior to, and during, mono therapy.
SNP AnalysisIn order to identify potential polymorphisms associated with sa fety and efficacy of nivolumab, 
selected genes will be evaluated for single nucleotide polymorp hisms (SNP). Analysis will be 
limited to sequence polymorphisms linked to genes associated wi th the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway 
and activated T cell phenotype, including PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, and CTLA-4. A blo od sample 
will be obtained at Day 1, unless restricted by local requireme nts.
Tumor-Based Biomarker MeasuresTumor biopsy specimens will be obtained from consenting subjects prior to nivolumab to 
characterize imm une cell p opulations and e xpression of selected tumor markers. Submission of 
tumor biopsy is mandatory for s ubjects with accessible lesions prior to therapy an d on-tr eatment 
biopsy samples are optional.
Submission of tumor tissue from a biopsy performed during screen ing is mandatory for 
biomarker analysis. If this is not possible, archival tissue fr om a previous biopsy can be used.
For subjects who had tumor biopsies performed at any time durin g therapy, if clinically 
indicated, submission of the biopsy samples is strongly encoura ged. 
Biopsy samples may be used for the following assessments:Characterization of TILs and tumor antigens IHC will be used to assess the number and

Characterization of tumor genotype and phenotype
Gene mutations, chromosomal translocations, aberrant expression s, and epigenetic modifications 
within tumor cells will be characterized and explore d by IHC and RNA/ DNA analysis of tumor 
biopsies. Associations of altered tumor cell genetic structure w ith nivolumab efficacy will be 
performed.
Characterization of T cell repertoire
As described above, DNA sequen cing will be performed on pre- and  post treatment tumor tissue 
to assess the composition of the T cell repertoire. DNA will be  isolated from either the FFPE 
tumor block or from  RNAlater or equivalent preparations.
Gene expression profiling
Tumor biops ies that are collected in RNAlater or equivalent fix ative will be examined for mRNA 
and miRNA gene expression by Affymetrix gene array technology a nd/or quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to detect expression of select ed immune-related genes and 
regulatory pathways.
Complete instructions on the collection, processing, handling, and shipment of all samples 
described herein will be provided in a separate procedure manua l at the time of study initiation.
Plasma samples
Plasma samples will be collected  for subjects in Cohorts C and D for, but not limited to, the 
determination of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD). For this purpo se, novel sequencing-based 
methods can d etect circ ulating tumor DNA (ct DNA) in plasma isolated from whole blood of 
subjects with great sensitivity which opens new opportunities f or molecular monitoring before, 
during, and after therapy. Beyond monitoring, ctDNA can also be  used as a “liquid biopsy” to 
assess for molecular changes during the course of the therapy that may identify the emergence of 
treatment-resistant clones i n the subjects at risk of relapse.

aPlasma (ctDNA) sample collection is only applicable to Cohort C  subjects.
bOn-treatment biomarker samples will be collected prior to administration of study drug and may be obtained ±3 days of the indicated time (except for Cycle 1 
Day 1).
cSubmission of tumor tissue from a biopsy performed during screening is mandatory (see the details in Section 3.1 and Table 5.1.1-1 ).
dFor Cohorts A and B, extent of disease involvement in the bone marrow must be documented at screening based on the results of a bone marrow 
biopsy/aspirate performed within 90 days prior to enrolment or a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate performed during the screening pe riod. If bone marrow 
biopsy/aspirate is performed during screening (after obtaining informed consent), submission of bone marrow a spirate is mandat ory. Submission of bone 
marrow biopsy specimen is not required at any point in the study. For Cohort C, performing a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate is op tional and submission of bone 
marrow aspirate, if performed, is optional.
eFor Cohorts A and B, if the bone marrow was involved by lym phoma at baseline, a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate will be re quired to c onfirm a  CR. 
Submission of bone marrow aspirate is mandatory in this case.
fAll subjects may volunteer to undergo tumor and/or bone marrow biopsies at any time during the rapy if clinically indicated. Wh en tumor biopsy is performed, 
submission of tumor biopsy is strongly encouraged. When bone marrow biopsy is done, submission of bone marrow aspirate is stro ngly encouraged.

5.7 Outcomes Research Assessments
Outcomes research data including health-related quality of life  and patient reported symptom 
burden provide a more complete understanding of the impact of t reatment by incorporating the 
subjects’ perspective. These data offer insights into the patie nt experience that may not be 
captured through physician reporting. Generic health-related qu ality of life scales provide data 
necessary in calculating u tility values for health ec onomic models. The EQ -5D will be  collected 
in order to assess the impact of nivolumab on generic h ealth-r elated qu ality of life and the data 
will be used fo r populating h ealth economic models most notably, cost effectiveness analysis . 
The EORTC QLQ-C30 will be collected in order to assess cancer s pecific h ealth-r elated qu ality 
of life. The combination of the generic scale for general h ealth s tatus and econo mic evaluation 
and the cancer specific scale w ill provide a robust  outcomes res earch package. 
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is one the mos t commonly used QoL instrument in oncology studies. The 
EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item instrument comprising six functional  scales (physical 
functioning, cognitive functioni ng, emotional functioning, role  functioning, social functioning 
and global quality of life) as well as nine symptom scales (fat igue, pain, nausea/vomiting, 
dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and f inancial difficulties). Except for the 
overall health s tatus and global quality of life items, responses for all items  are 4-point 
categorical scales ranging from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very mu ch). The overall health s tatus/quality 
of life responses are 7-point Likert scales. 
General health status will be measured using the EQ-5D. The EQ-5 D is a standardized 
instrument for use as a measure of self-reported general h ealth s tatus. The EQ-5D comprises 
5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discom fort, and anxiety) and a visual 
analog rating scale (VAS). The ut ility data gener ated from the EQ-5D is recommended for and 
commonly used in cost effectiveness analysis.All QoL assessments will be administered as outlined in Table 5.1.1-2 ,Table 5.1.1-3 ,Table 
5.1.1-4 , Table 5.1.2-2 , Table 5.1.2-3 andTable 5.1.2-4 . EORTC-QLQ-C30 will be collected for 
Cohorts A, B, and C. EQ-5D will be collected for Cohorts A, B, C , and D.
Outcomes research data will not be collected for subjects who r e-initiate study therapy (Cohort C 
subjects).
5.8 Other Assessments 
5.8.1 Immunogenicity Assessments
Serum samples collected at time points identified in Table 5.5-1 (Cohorts A, B, and C) and Table 
5.5-2 (Cohort D) will be analyzed by a validated immunoassay. Additio nal characterization (ie,
neutralizing antibodies) for any detected anti-drug antibodies (ADA) response to nivolumab may 
also be performed using a validated functional cell-based assay . All on-treatment 
immunogenicity assessment time points are intended to align with days 
 on which nivolumab is 
administered. If it is known that a dose is going to be delayed , then the predose sample should be 
collected just prior to the delayed dose. However, if a predose sample is collected, but the dose is

BMS-936558 nivolumab
subsequently delayed, an additional predose sample should not b e collected. Selected serum 
samples may be analyzed by an exploratory method that measures anti-nivolumab antibodies for 
technology exploration purposes; exploratory results will not be reported. 
In addition, serum samples designated for PK or biomarker asses sments may also be used for 
immunogenicity analysis if required (eg, if there is insufficie nt volume for complete 
immunogenicity assessment or to follow up on suspected immunoge nicity-related AE).
5.9 Results of Central Assessments
The primary endpoint for Cohorts A, B, and C is ORR, as determine d by the IRRC.
For Cohort D, OR and CR for secondary and exploratory endpoints  are also determined by the 
IRRC.
Site will be informed of quality issues or needs for repeat sca nning via queries from the corelab. 
Results of central Imaging analysis will not be returned to the  site.
For Cohort D, histology of cHL will be confirmed later by a cen tral pathological laboratory; 
subjects may start the first dose after cHL histology is confir med by a local pathological 
laboratory.
6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subje ct administered study drug and that 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an a bnormal laboratory  finding), symptom , or disease 
temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered r elated to the study 
drug.
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physici an and should be used to assess 
all adverse events (AE ). The causal relationship can be one of the following:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between stud y drug administration and 
the AE.Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship betw een study drug 
administration and the AE. 
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is eviden ce to suggest a causal 
relationship. Adverse events can be spon taneously repor ted or elicited  during open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
BMS will be reporting adverse events to regulat ory authorities and ethics co mmittees acc ording 
to local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of Federal 
Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320.

6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•results in death
•is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically m ight have caused death if it 
were more severe)
•requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of ex isting hospitalization (see 
NOTE below)
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
•is an important medical event (defined as a med ical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in d eath or hospi talization but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed i n the definition above.) 
Examples of such events include , but are not limited to, intens ive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscr asias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospitalization.) Potenti al drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an 
important medical event. (See Section 6.6 for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic o r nonpathogenic) via the study 
drug is an SAE. 
Although pregna ncy, overdose, cancer, a nd potential drug induce d liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by regulatory definition, these events must be h andled as SAEs. (See 
Section 6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).
Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to  study therapy (eg, d eath is an 
endpoint, if d eath occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis mus t be reported) should be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for repor ting details).
NOTE : 
The following hospitalizati ons are not considered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
−a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24  hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event)
−elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
−admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical proce dure
−routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/tren ding of health status (eg, 
routine colonoscopy)
−medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill h ealth a nd planned prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases

BMS-936558 nivolumab
−admission encountered for another life circumstance that carrie s no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy, caregiver respite , family circumstan ces, administrative reason).
−admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absen ce of any other SAEs 
(applies to oncology protocols).
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) repr esent the Reference Safety 
Information to d etermine expectedness of serious adverse events  for expedited reporting. 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the s tudy, all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study drug, must be collected, including those t hought to be associated with 
protocol-specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that o ccur during the screening period 
and within 100 days of discontinuation of dosing. If applicable , SAEs must be collected that 
relate to any later protocol-specified procedure (eg, a follow- up skin biopsy). 
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these ti me periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure.
For the Cohort C subjects who discontinue treatment after persis tent one-year CR, SAEs will be 
collected for a maximum of two years and a minimum of 100 days a fter last dose during safety 
and FU/Observational visits. After, only study procedures-relat ed SAEs will need to be reported 
and collected.
An SAE report must be completed for any event where doubt exists  regarding its seriousness. 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to stud y drug, but is potentially related to 
the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous the rapy or a comp lication of a study 
procedure), the relationship must be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnan cies must be reported to BMS (or 
designee) within 24 hours of awareness of the event. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report 
Form; pregnancies on a Pregna ncy Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). The preferred 
method for SAE data reporting co llection is t hrough the eCRF. The paper SAE/pregnancy 
surveillance forms are only intended as a back-up option when th e  e C R F  s y s t e m  i s  n o t  
functioning. In this case, the paper forms are t o be transmitted via email or confirmed facs imile 
(fax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Information list.
SAE Facsimile Number: Refer to Contact Information list.
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC ), electronic submission is the 
required method for re porting. In the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission, 
paper forms must be used and submitted immediately. When paper forms are used, the original 
paper forms are to remain on site.

SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting): Refer to Contact 
Information list.
If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. (Note: Follow-up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initia lly reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to s tudy drug or if n ew information 
becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours to BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the in itial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.
6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and ReportingThe collection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study d rug. Nonserious 
AE information s hould also be co llected from the s tart of a placebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects. 
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stab ilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study drug and for those pre sent at the end of study treatment 
as appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious 
AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic).
All nonserious adverse events (not only those deemed to be treatment-related) should be 
collected continuously during the treatment period and for a mi nimum of 100 days following the 
last dose of study treatment.For the Cohort C subjects who discontinue treatment after persis tent one-year CR, NSAEs will 
be collected for a maximum of two years and a minimum of 100 da ys after last dose during 
safety and FU/Observational visits.
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or  laboratory abnormalities 
that are reported/identified during the course of the study.
6.3 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be ca ptured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (pape r or el ectronic) as appropriate. Paper f orms are only intended as 
a back-up option when the electronic system is not functioning.
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or me ets the definition of an SAE 
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject  to have study drug 
discontinued or interrupted
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subjec t to receive specific corrective 
therapy.

BMS-936558 nivolumab
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than  laboratory term would be used by 
the reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin va lue).
6.4 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study drug, it is subsequently discovered that a study sub ject is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure , including during at least 
5 half lives after product adminis tration, the investigator must  immediately notify the BMS (or 
designee) Medical Monitor of this event and complete and forwar d a Pregnancy Surveillance 
Form to BMS (or designee) within 24 hours and in accordance with the SAE reporting 
procedures described in Section 6.1.1 .
In most cases, the study drug will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner 
(eg, dose tapering if necessary for subject safety). Please call the BMS Medical Monitor within 
24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy.
In the rare event that the benefit of continuing study drug is thought to outweigh the risk, after 
consultation with BMS, the pregnant subject may continue study drug, after a thorough 
discussion of benefits and risk with the subject.Protocol required procedures f or study disconti nuation and foll ow-up must be performed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (eg, x-ray studies) . Other appropriate pregnancy 
follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated.Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, in cluding perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance form
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study p articipant should be reported to 
BMS. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pre gnancy Surveillance Form.
6.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product 
that is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be 
reported as an SAE (see S ection 6.1.1 for repor ting details.).
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver-related  laboratory abnormalities s hould 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occ urrences of potential DILIs, 
meeting t he defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Sec tion 6.1.1 for re porting details).

Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as: 
1. Aminotransaminases (AT) (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times ULN
AND
2. Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without init ial findings of cholestasis ( elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND
3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation  and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited t o, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chr onic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
6.7 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physica l examinations, 
electrocardiogram, x-ray filming, any other potential safety as sessment required or not required 
by protocol should also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported 
accordingly. 
7 DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE AND OTHER EXTERNAL 
COMMITTEES
An IRRC will be u tilized in this study f or determination of IRR C-assessed endpoints such as 
ORR, CR rate, PR rate and associated durations. The IRRC will re view all available tumor 
assessment scans for all treated subjects. Details of IRRC resp onsibilities and procedures will be 
specified in the IRRC charter.
The subjects’ safety will be monitored on an ongoing basis. The  BMS medical monitor is a 
physician responsible for reviewing, on a sys tematic and c ontinuous basis, the safety of subjects
on this study. This includes a review of serious and non-seriou s adverse events, including all 
hematological and non-hematological events. In addition, a BMS medical safety team (MST) 
routinely reviews safety signals across the entire nivolumab pr ogram including combination 
studies with ipilimumab. The MST is independent from the BMS me dical monitor. The MST has 
the primary responsibility within BMS for assessing emerging sa fety trends, identifying potential 
safety signals, notifying appropriate stakeholders of relevant findings, and implementing risk 
management plans. The MST is responsible for reviewing data fro m all sources  including 
non-clinical studies and clinical trials, monitoring the progre ss of various nivolumab safety 
support activities, and recommending and implementing necessary changes to the safety plan and 
any other specific safety-related activities. 
For Cohort D, when required, adjudicated events will be submitt ed to the DMC and Health 
Authorities for review on a specified timeframe in accordance w ith the adjudication 
documentation. In addition, safety conference calls with invest igators and representatives of the 
sponsor w ill be held regularly until all subjects have entered the FU/observational phase or 
discontinued the study.

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
The planned sample size for this study w ill be a pproximately 270 treated subjects, p laced into 
four cohorts of subjects: brentuximab vedotin-naïve (n = 60; Cohor t A), treatment with 
brentuximab vedotin after fail ure of ASCT (n = 60; Cohort B), and treatment with brentuximab 
vedotin at any time point (n = 100; Cohort C), and first-line subj ects (n = 50; Cohort D).
Cohorts A and B
The sample size from both cohorts was determined based on two c onsiderations: the ability to 
produce a CI which would exclude an ORR of 20%, which is not con sidered clinically relevant
and provide sufficient information for a reliable understanding  of the safety profile.23
Assuming the true O RR is 40%, each cohort has approximately 93%  power to reject the null 
hypothesis that the true ORR is ≤20%, considering a 2-sided al pha of 5%. In addition, Table 
8.1-1 summarizes the 95% exact CI for the target ORRs ranging fr om 35% t o 70% with sample 
size of 60. At observed ORR ≥35%, the lower bound of the 95% CI excludes 20%.
Table 8.1-1: Observed ORR with Exact 95 % CI
ORR 95% Exact CI
35% [23.1%-48.4%]
40% [27.6%-53.5%]
50% [36.8%-63.2%]
60% [46.5%-72.4%]
70% [56.8%-81.2%]
Cohort CThe sample size for Cohort C was empirically determined to supp ort expanded assessment of the 
benefit-risk profile of nivolumab in cHL through observation of  less common safety events. In 
particular, administrati on of nivolumab to 100 sub jects provides 87% probability of observing at 
least one occurrence of any adverse event that would occur with  2% incidence in the population 
from which the sample is drawn. Benefit in this cohort will be measured by the ORR and DOR.
Cohort DThe sample size for Cohort D was empirically determined to prov ide sufficient information for 
understanding the safety profile and est imating the  proportion of subjects who experience at least 
one treatment-related grade 3-5 adverse events. 
In a randomized study
92comparing ABVD and BEACOPP in previously untreated and 
unfavorable Hodgkin’s lymphoma, 43% of the subjects from the ABVD arm experienced at least 
one Grade 3 or 4 acute hematologic adverse event and 7% of subj ects experienced at least one

acute non-hematologic adverse event in the ABVD arm. Table 8.1- 2 summarizes the 95% exact 
CI for a range of incidence rates.

46% [31.81%  60.68%]
CI = confidence interval
Other considerations:
A discontinuation rate above 20% is not considered as acceptable  because ABVD 
discontinuation rates due to any reasons (toxicity , disease  progression or others) are consistently 
around 10% across previous clinical studies.12,15,93Table 8.1-3 summarizes the 95% exact CI for 
a target discontinuation rate ranging from 8% to 14%. If 10% (F ive out of 50 treated subjects) or 
fewer discontinue the treatment, the upper bound of the 95% CI w ill exclude 20%.

8.2 Populations for Analyses
Within each cohort the followi ng populations will  be defined.
−All Enrolled Subjects: All subjects who signed an informed consent form and were 
registered into the IVRS.
−All Treated Subjects: All subjects  who received at least one do se of nivolumab. This is 
the primary  population for safety a nd efficacy analyses.
−PK subjects: All subjects with available serum time-concentrati on data from sub jects 
dosed with nivolumab
−Immunogenicity Evaluable Subject s: All treated subjects with ba seline and at least 
1 postbaseline immunogenicity assessment.

8.3 Endpoints
8.3.1 Cohorts A, B, and C
8.3.1.1 Primary Endpoint(s) for Cohorts A, B, and C
The primary objective will be measured by the primary endpoint of IRRC-assessed ORR. It is 
defined as the number of subjects with a BO R of CR or P R, according to the 2007 IWG criteria, 
based on IRRC assessment, divided by the number of treated subj ects. Only for Cohort C, 
FDG-PET can be used in lieu of bone marrow aspirate/ biopsy for bone marrow assessment. The 
BOR is defined as the best response designation recorded betwee n the date of first dose and the 
date of initial objectively documented progression per the 2007  IWG criteria or the date of 
subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first. Allogeneic SCT and ASCT will be considered as 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy. For subjects without documented  progression or subsequent 
therapy, all available response designations will contribute to  the BOR determination. For 
purposes of analysis, if a sub ject r eceives one dose and discon tinues the study without 
assessment or receives subsequent therapy prior to assessment, this subject will be counted in the 
denominator (as non-responder). P rimary analysis will be perfor med separately f or each cohort 
(ie, at separate time points) upon completion of a pre-specified  amount of follow-up (Table 
8.3.1.1-1) after last patient first treatment (LPFT).

Duration of Objective Response Based on IRRC Assessment
DOR is defined as the time from first response (CR or PR) to th e date of initial ob jectively 
documented progression as determined using the 2007 IWG criteri a or death due to any cause, 
whichever occurs first. For subjects who neither progress nor d ie, the DOR will be censored on 
the date of their last tumor assessment. Subjects who start sub sequent therapy without a prior 
reported progression will be censored at the last tumor assessm ents prior to initiation of the 
subsequent anticancer therapy. This endpoint will only be evalu ated in subjects with objective 
response of CR or PR.

Complete Remission Rate and Duration Based on IRRC Assessment
The CR rate is defined as th e number of subjects with a BO R of CR according to the 2007 IWG 
criteria, based on IRRC assessment, divided by the number of tr eated sub jects. The duration of 
CR will only be evaluated in subjects with BOR of CR and is def ined as the time from first 
documentati on of  CR (the date of first neg ative FDG-PET scan or the date of first documentation 
of no disease involvement in the  bone marrow (i f required), whi chever occurs later) to the date 
of initial objectively documented progression as determined using the 2007 IWG criteria or death
due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Censoring will be app lied as per DOR definition.
Partial Remission Rate and Duration Based on IRRC Assessment
The PR rate is defined as the number of subjects with a BOR of PR according to the 2007 IWG 
criteria, based on IRRC assessment, divided by the number of tr eated sub jects. The duration of 
PR will only be evaluated in subjects with BOR of PR and is def ined as the time from first 
documentation of PR to the date of initial objectively document ed progression as determined 
using the 2007 IWG criteria or death due to any cause, whicheve r occurs first. Censoring will be 
applied as per DOR definition.

Investigator-assessed ORR and DOR are defined similarly as desc ribed for ORR and DOR per 
IRRC assessment above, but will be assessed per investigator.
8.3.1.3 Exploratory Endpoint(s) for Cohorts A, B, and C
Exploratory efficacy objectives will be measured by exploratory  endpoints of PFS based on 
IRRC assessment and OS.
PFS is defined as the time from first dosing date to the d ate of the first documented progression 
using the 2007 IWG criteria, as determined by IRRC, or death du e to any cause, whichever 
occurs first. Subjects who die without a reported progression w ill be considered to have 
progressed on the date of their death. Subjects who did not pro gress or die will be censored on 
the date of their last tumor assessment. Subjects who did not h ave any on study assessments and 
did not die will be censored on the first dosing date. Subjects  who started any subsequent 
anti-cancer therapy without a prior reported progression will b e censored at the last tumor 
assessment prior to initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer th erapy.
OS is defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of  death. For subjects without 
documentation of death, OS will be censored on the last date the subject was known to be alive.
The safety and tolerability ob jective will be measured by the incidence of adverse events, serious 
adverse events, deaths and laboratory abnormalities.The PK samples collected will be used to determine su mmary measures of nivolumab exposure 
(see Section 8.4.4 ).
Other exploratory endpoints for pharmacodynamics, outcomes rese arch and immunogenicity are 
discussed in detail in Sections 5.6 , 5.7 and 5.8.

For Cohorts A and B, the nul l hypothesis will be rejected if the  2-sided 95% CI lo wer bound for 
the ORR IRRC-assessed estimate is greater than 20%. This translates in observing at least 
19 responders out of 60 treated subjects.
8.4.2.2 Duration of Response
The IRRC-assessed DOR will be summarized by c ohort for subjects  who achieve PR or CR 
using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) produc t-limit method. Median values of DOR, along with 
two-sided 95% CIs (based on the log-log transformation) and ran ge, will also be calculated. The 
same analysis will be performed for the duration of PR and CR, as well as DOR per investigator.
For Cohorts A and B, the IRRC-assessed CR and PR rates and inve stigator-assessed ORR will be 
summarized by binomial response rates and their corresponding t wo-sided 95% CI using the 
Clopper-Pearson method.
8.4.2.3 Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival
The IRRC-assessed and investigator-assessed PFS and OS will be summarized by the 
Kaplan-Meier product- limit met hod. Median values along with two-sided 95% CIs based on the 
log-log transformation, will be calculated. PFS and OS will be evaluated in all treated subjects.
8.4.3 Safety Analyses
Safety analyses will be perf ormed in all tr eated subjects . Descriptive statistics of safety will be 
presented using NCI CTCAE version 4.0. All on-study AEs, drug-r elated, AEs, SAEs and 
drug-related SAEs will be tabulated using worst grade per NCI C TCAE v4.0 criteria by system 
organ class and MedDRA preferred term. On-study lab parameters including hematology,

10 GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Term Definition
Complete Abstinence If one form of  contraception is required, Co mplete 
Abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual 
intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all 
study drugs. Female subjects must continue to have pregnancy tests. Acceptable alternate methods of highly 
effective contraception must be discussed in the event that 
the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.
If two forms of contraception is required, Complete 
abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all 
study drugs. Subjects who choose complete abstinence are 
not required to use a second method of contraception, but 
female subjects must continue to have pregnancy tests. Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective 
contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject 
chooses to forego complete abstinence.
Expanded definition Complete abstinence as defined as 
complete avoidance of hete rosexual intercourse is an 
acceptable form of contracepti on for all study drugs. This 
also means that abstinence is the preferred and usual lifestyle  
of the patient. This does not mean periodic abstinence (e.g., 
calendar, ovulation, symptotherm al, profession of abstinence 
for entry into a clinical tr ial, post-ovulatio n methods) and 
withdrawal, which are not acceptable methods of contraception. Subjects who choose complete abstinence are 
not required to use a second method of contraception, but 
female subjects must continue to have pregnancy tests. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective 
contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence

APPENDIX 1 MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS FOR IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY 
AGENTS
These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigato r and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor representing the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all 
immuno-oncology agents and regimens.
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be di ligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. Non-inflammatory etiologies s hould be consider ed and appropriately 
treated.
Corticosteroids are a primary therapy for immuno-oncology drug- related adverse events. The 
oral equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered f or ambulatory patients with 
low-grade toxicity. The lower bioavailability of  oral corticosteroids should be taken into account 
when switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.Consultation with a medical or surgical specialis t, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended.The frequency and severity of the related adverse events covered by these algorithms will depend 
on the immuno-oncology agent or regimen being used.

3.0 Approved 930105741 3.0v
Clinical Protocol CA209205
BMS-936558 nivolumab
CR (Complete Remission)
The designation of CR requires the following:
1. Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of  disease and disease-related 
symptoms, if present before therapy.
2. a. Typically [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lympho ma: in p atients with no 
pretreatment posit ron emission tomography (PET) scan or when th e PET scan was positive 
before therapy, a post-treatment residual mass of any size is p ermitted as long as it is PET 
negative.
b. Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/ FDG avidity unknown: in patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan, or if a pretreatment P ET scan was negative, all lymph  nodes and nodal masses 
must have regressed on computed tomography (CT) scan to normal size (≤1.5 cm in their 
greatest transverse diameter for nodes > 1.5 cm before therapy).  Previously involved nodes 
that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in their long axis and > 1.0 cm in their  short axis before treatment 
must have decreased to ≤1.0 cm in their short axis after treatment.
3. The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged before therapy on the basis of a physical 
examination or CT scan, s hould not be palpable on physical examination and should be 
considered normal size by imaging studies, and nodules related to lymphoma should 
disappear. However, determination of splenic involvement is not  always reliable because a 
spleen considered normal in size may st ill contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged sp leen 
may reflect variations in anatomy, bl ood volume , the use of hematopoietic growth factors, or 
causes other than lymphoma.
4. For cohort A and B, if the bone marrow was involved by lympho ma before treatment, the 
infiltrate must have cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy. The biopsy sample on which this 
determination is made must be adequate (with a goal of > 20 mm unilateral core). If the 
sample is indeterminate by mo rphology, it should be negative by immunohistochemistry. A 
sample that is negative by immunohistochemistry but demonstrate s a small population of 
clonal lymphocytes by flow cytometry w ill be considered a CR until data become available 
demonstrating a clear difference in patient outcome.
5. For cohort C, no evidence of FDG-avid disease in bone marrow will be required in all 
patients in lieu of bone marrow aspirate/ biopsy.
PR (Partial Remission)
The designation of PR requires all of the following:
1. At least a 50% decrease in the sum of the product of the diam eters (SPD) of up to 6 of the 
largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses s hould be selected according 
to all of the following: they s hould be clearly measurable in  at least 2 perpendicular 
dimensions; if possible they s hould be from disparate regions of the body; and they s hould 
include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenev er these sites are involved.
2. No increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, li ver, or spleen.
3. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by ≥50% in their SPD or, for single nodules, in the 
greatest transverse diameter.

Clinical Protocol CA209205
BMS-936558 nivolumab
4. With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvemen t of other organs is usually 
assessable and no measurable disease should be present.
5. Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a P R, if the sample was positive 
before treatment. However, if positive, the cell type s hould be specified (e.g., large-cell 
lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells). Patients who achieve a C R by the above criteria but 
have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will be con sidered partial responders. 
When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and a clinical  CR was achieved but with 
no bone marrow assessment after treatment, patients should be c onsidered partial responders.
6. No new sites of disease should be observed.
7. Typically FDG-avid lympho ma: for p atients with no pretreatment PET scan or if the PET 
scan was positive before therapy, the post-treatment PET should  be positive in at least 
1 previously involved site.
8. Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG-avidity unknown: for patients  without a pretreatment 
PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, CT criteria should be used. In patients 
with follicular lymphoma  or mantle- cell lym phoma, a PET scan is only indicated wit h 1 or at 
most 2 residual masses that  have regressed by > 50% on CT; thos e with more than 2 residual 
lesions are unlikely to be PET negative and should be considere d partial responders
SD (Stable Disease)
SD is defined as the following:
1. A patient is considered to have SD when he or she fails to at tain the criteria needed for a CR 
or PR but does not fulfill those for progressive disease (see R elapsed Disease [after 
CR]/Progressive Disease [after PR, SD]).
2. Typically FGD-avid lymphomas: the PET should be positive at p rior sites of disease with no 
new areas of involvement on the post-treatment CT or PET scan.
3. Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG-avidity unknown: for patients  without a pretreatment 
PET scan or if the pretreatment PET was negative, there must be  no change in the size of the 
previous lesions on the post-treatment CT scan.
PD: Relapsed Disease (after CR)/Progressive Disease (after PR, SD)
Lymph nodes s hould be considered abnormal if the long axis is > 1.5 cm regar dless of the short 
axis. If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 t o 1.5 cm, it s hould only be considered abnormal if 
its short axis is > 1.0. Lymph nodes ≤1.0 x ≤1.0 cm will  not be considered abnormal for relapse 
or progressive disease.
1. Appearance of any new lesion > 1.5 cm in any axis during or a t the end of therapy, even if 
other lesions are decreasing in size. Increased FDG uptake in a  previously unaffected site 
should only be considered relapsed or PD after confirmation wit h other modalities. In 
patients with no prior history of pulmonary lymphoma, new lung nodules identified by CT 
are mostly benign. Thus, a therapeutic decision s hould not be made solely on the basis of the 
PET without histologic confirmation.

2. At least a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previous ly involved nodes, or in a 
single involved node, or the size of other lesions (e.g., splen ic or hepatic nodules). To be 
considered PD, a lymph node wit h a diameter of the short axis o f < 1.0 cm must increase by 
≥50% and to a size of 1.5 x 1.5 cm or > 1.5 cm in the long axis.
3. At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single  previously identified node 
> 1 cm in its short axis.
4. Lesions should be PET positive if observed in a typical FDG-a vid lymphoma or the lesion 
was PET positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be detected with current 
PET systems (< 1.5 cm in its long axis by CT).
Measurable extranodal disease should be assessed in a manner si milar to that for nodal disease. 
For these recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disea se. Disease that is only 
assessable (e.g., pleural effusions, bone lesions) w ill be rec orded as present or absent only, 
unless, while an abnormality is st ill note d by imaging studies or physical examination, i t is found 
to be histologically negative.
In clinical trials where PET is unavailable to the vast majorit y of participants, or where PET is 
not deemed necessary  or appropriate for use (e .g., a trial in patients with MALT lymphoma), 
response s hould be a ssessed as above, but only using CT scans. However, residual masses should 
not be assigned CRu status, but should be considered partial re sponses.

APPENDIX 6 REVISED PROTOCOL SUMMARY OF CHANGE HISTORY
Overall Rationale for the Revised Protocol 04b, 14-Sep-2018
The purpose of this revision is to clarify la nguage surrounding the timing of biomarker sample 
collection, specifically plasma ctDNA. Additional changes were made to align text with 
nivolumab program standards and to align text concerning contraception with the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB) for nivolumab.
Revisions apply to all participants currently enrolled.
Summary of key changes of Revised Protocol 04b
Section Number & Title Description of Change Brief Rationale
Section 1.1.2.1, Rationale 
for Cohort CAdded rationale for why plasma samples will be 
collected (for molecular monitoring of the disease).To clarify text.
Section 1.4.3.5, 
Nivolumab Monotherapy 
Clinical Pharmacology 
SummaryIn reference to the current IB, “additional 
information” was changed to “full details on the 
clinical pharmacology aspects of nivolumab.”To clarify text.
Figure 3.1.2-2: Treatment 
and Follow-up Phase for 
Cohort DIn top figure, the last bullet was corrected: 
“...survival visits continue every 3 months” was 
changed to 6 months.To be consistent with the 
language in the Follow-up 
(FU)/Observational Phase 
subsection on the previous 
page.
Section 3.3.1, Inclusion 
Criteria: #3, Age and 
Reproductive StatusChanges to contraception wording. To align with IB for 
nivolumab.
Section 3.4.1, Prohibited 
and/or Restricted 
TreatmentsAdded 3rd bullet:
•Any live/attenuated vaccine (eg, varicella, 
zoster, yellow fever, rotavirus, oral polio, and measles, mumps, rubella [MMR]) during treatment and until 100 days post last dose.To align with nivolumab 
program standards.
Table 5.1.1-4: Follow-Up 
Assessments for Cohort C 
Subjects who 
Discontinued due to CR 
(CA209205) or After Re-
Initiation of NivolumabAdded “or After Re -Initiation of Nivol umab” to the
table title.To clarify that follow-up 
assessments also apply to 
patients in Cohort C who 
discontinue after re-initiation 
of nivolumab.
Section 5.4, Efficacy 
AssessmentsSentence added to specify that for Cohort D, 
additional assessments, for example, Deauville 
scoring, may also be performed.Since the predictive value of 
interim PET Deauville score 
in the prognosis of patients 
with Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
using I-O (Nivolumab-AVD) 
in a first-line setting is of 
limited value, as opposed to 
when chemotherapy is used, 
the predictive value of EOT 
PET Deauville score might 
be more helpful.

Summary of key changes of Revised Protocol 04b
Section Number & Title Description of Change Brief Rationale
Table 5.5-1: Sampling 
Schedule for Cohorts A, 
B, and CIn the Day 1 of every 12th cycle row, instead of 
samples being collected until discontinuation of 
study treatment, text was changed to “up to Cycle 
49.”PK/IMG sample collection 
beyond Cycle 49 from 
subjects randomized to 
Cohorts A, B, or C is not 
required. Samples collected 
from subjects beyond Cycle 
49 will not be used in 
PK/statistical analyses, 
tables, listings, or figures.
Section 5.6, Biomarker 
AssessmentsIn the last subsection, “Plasma samples,” text was 
added that describes “novel sequencing-based 
methods” that “can detect circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA).”ctDNA opens new 
opportunities for molecular 
monitoring before, during, 
and after therapy. It can also 
be used as a “liquid biopsy” 
to assess for molecular 
changes during the course of 
the therapy that may identify 
the emergence of treatment-
resistant clones in the 
subjects at risk of relapse.
Table 5.6-1: CA209205 
Biomarker Sampling 
Schedule for Cohorts A, 
B, and C• “(ctDNA)” added after “Plasma” in last 
column heading and in table footnote a.
• For plasma (ctDNA) collection times after 
Cycle 27, “Thereafter, every 6 cycles” was changed to “Cycle 68 Day 1” and “Cycle 81 Day 1.”
• Plasma (ctDNA) collection changed from 
“optional” to “strongly recommended” in the “Upon Progression” collection time row and in table footnote h.• To be consistent 
with changes made in Section 5.6.
• Collection of 
plasma/ctDNA after C27 was stopped since it is not expected that the emergence of any 
treatment resistance 
clones/mutations earlier than C68 will be identified. Plasma will be collected at C81 to confirm the presence and/or the selection of the mutations/clones at a later phase of the treatment course.
• This time point is 
extremely important to identify emergence of therapy resistance clone; therefore, it has been specified as “strongly recommended.”

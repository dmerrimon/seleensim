 1. OBJECTIVES 
 
This study is a phase II study of the J AK kinase inhibitor I NCB018424 phosphate in 
patients with advanced hematological malignancies who have failed prior therapy.  The objectives of the proposed study are:  
Primary:  
To observe the anti-tumor effects of INCB018424 in patients with   
relapsed/refractory AML, ALL, and MD S (including CMML), and blast phase  
or tyrosine kinase refractory CML.   
Secondary: 
1. To determine the safety and tolerability  in patients with re lapsed/refractory  
AML, ALL, and MDS (including CMML), and blast phase or tyrosine kinase refractory CML.   2. To determine the pharmacokineti cs and preliminary pharmacodynamic 
activity including the modulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pr otein phosphorylation.  
 
2. BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 Diseases to be studied 
 
Despite progress in leukemia therapy, most adult patients with leukemia still 
die from disease progression, and impr ovements in therapy are still required 
for pediatric patients with resistant or  relapsed leukemia. For patients with 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who fa il to achieve a complete remission 
(CR) with first attempts at induction or who have relapsed disease, current 
therapy is inadequate with a true long term cure rate of less than 10% and 
therefore, ne w agents are needed.
1 Adult patients with acute lymphocytic 
leukemia (ALL) who fail to achieve a CR with first attempts at induction or who have relapsed disease have a true long term cure rate of less than 10%.
2 Patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who enter blastic 
phase having received prior imatinib ther apy or who fail imatinib therapy for 
blastic phase have a median survival of 3 to 9 months with current therapies.
3 Similarly, patients with CML who have failed two or three 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors have few alternative options. 
 
2.2 INCB018424 Phosphate 
2.2.1 Drug Product  
INCB018424 phosphate is an inhibitor of the Janus kinase family of protein 
tyrosine kinases (JAKs) that is current ly being developed for treatment of 
myeloproliferative disorders under IND No. 77,456.  Unless otherwise 
Protocol Number 2007-0925

 noted, INCB018424 phosphate is refe rred to throughout this IND as 
INCB018424.  INCB018424 Phosphate Tablets 5 and 25 mg (free base 
equivalent), as disclosed in IND No. 77,456, will be used in the proposed 
studies described in this IND. Additional  details of the CMC characterization 
of INCB018424 may be found in the Clinical  Investigators Brochure (CIB). 
IND No. 77,455 was submitted to t he FDA Division of Anesthesia, 
Analgesic, and Rheumatology Products to develop INCB018424 Phosphate 
Capsules for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthri tis.  Phase 1 of 
this study (Study INCB 18424-132) has safely completed the short term (10 
day) dosing of normal volunteers with the 25 mg BID doses of INCB018424 
that are proposed to be used in this study.   
2.2.2 In Vitro  Pharmacology of INCB018424 
INCB018424 is a potent inhibitor of all JAK family members (IC 50 values < 5 
nM), with modest selectivity for JAK2. It does not significantly inhibit a broad 
panel of 26 other kinases when tested at concentrations approximately 100 
fold higher than its potency against the various JAKs.  Moreover, in cell-
based assays relevant to the pathogenesis of MPDs and cancer, such as cytokine-induced JAK-STAT signa ling, cytokine-driven tumor cell 
proliferation as well as growth of  a cell line expressing the JAK2V617F 
mutation, INCB018424 demonstr ates excellent potency (IC
50 values of ~ 80-
150 nM).  This effect is not due to general cytotoxicity, because 
INCB018424 (up to 20 µM) had no signi ficant effect on the growth of 
cytokine-independent cell lines.  In addition, INCB018424 inhibits cytokine-induced JAK/STAT phosphorylation in human whole blood with an IC
50 
value of ~ 300 nM, providing a useful biomarker of INCB018424 pharmacological activity. Additional details as to the in vitro  pharmacology of 
INCB018424 may be found in the Clinical  Investigators Brochure (CIB). 
2.2.3 In Vivo  Pharmacology of INCB018424  
Treatment of mice with or ally administered INCB01 8424 resulted in a dose-
dependent suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation and tumor growth in the cytokine-dependent multiple myeloma INA-6 xenograft model at doses ≥ 10 
mg/kg BID.  Moreover, oral adminis tration of INCB018424 inhibited JAK 
pathway signaling, tumor cell growth and splenomegaly in mice resulting 
from intravenous inoculation of a BaF3 cell line engineered to express JAK2V617F (BaF3-JAK2V617F).  A dditional details as to the in vivo  
pharmacology of INCB018424 may be found in the Clinical Investigator’s 
Brochure (CIB).  
 
Pharmacological data obtained in both in vitro  and in vivo  model systems 
support the potential utilit y of orally administered INCB018424 in the 
treatment of JAK-dependent hem atological malignancies.

 INCB018424 has been admin istered orally in single doses to healthy 
subjects in ongoing study INCB 1 8424-131.  In study  INCB 18424-131, 
single oral doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg have 
been administered with monitoring of adver se events, clinical laboratories, 
PK and pharmacodynamic parameters.  All single doses were well tolerated 
with no observed drug-associated adver se events.  The pharmacodynamic 
preliminary, unaudited draft data available indicate that single doses of INCB018424 are able to inhibit interleukin-6 induced STAT3 
phosphorylation in a dose dependent m anner.  The 200 mg dose of 18424 
produced ~80-95% inhibition of ST AT3 phosphorylation between 1-8 hours 
following dosing with levels return ing to baseline by 48 hours.   
 In study INCB 18424-132, multiple or al doses of 25 mg BID and 50 mg  
daily and BID have been administered wit h monitoring of adverse events, 
clinical laboratories, PK and pha rmacodynamic parameters.  The 
preliminary unaudited pharmacodynamic dr aft data available indicate that 
multiple doses of INCB018424 are able to inhibit interleukin-6 induced 
STAT3 phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner, similar to data obtained in the single dose studies.  The data on day 1 and day 10 demonstrated similar levels of inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation, indicating a lack of cumulative biological  activity.  From an evaluation of the 
safety data obtained in this study, the preliminary conclusion is that the INCB018424 50 mg BID dose is consider ed too high for healthy volunteers 
and patients without serious diseases.  Dosing in these populations should be limited to 25 mg BID or lower and up to 50 mg daily, although higher doses than 50 daily may be safe but  have not been tested beyond single 
doses.  However, in patients with malignancies dose escalation could continue until the maximum tolerated dose is achieved due to the different benefit-risk ratio in these subjects and because these patients may respond differently.   Under IND No. 77,456, INCB018424 has also been dosed to three patients 
with multiple metaplasia with myelofib rosis at 25 mg BID for over five 
months with clinical benefit  but without notable toxicity.  In this study four 
patients have also been dosed at 50 mg INCB018424 BID but, according to protocol, dosing was halted after tw o of four subjects presented with 
significant reductions in peripheral blood neutrophils and platelets.  
Subsequently, according to protocol, three additional patients have been 
treated at the 25 mg BID dose for at leas t 1 month to establish this dose as 
the MTD in this population. 
 
2.3 Rationale  
The Jak family of kinases comprises four proteins (Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2) that can associate with cytokine
 receptor subunits, phosphorylate 
them, and in doing so create docking sites on the receptors for binding of 
Protocol Number 2007-0925 
October 13, 2008 
Page 6 of 36 
 SH2-containing proteins. In general, Jaks consist of several domains (JH1-
JH7), including a tyrosine kinase domain,  and the functional significance of 
these domains has been characterized by mutational analysis.  Jaks are 
able to associate with the cytokine receptors as well as with each other. 
Dimerization/oligomer ization of cytokine receptor subunits as a result of 
ligand binding leads to juxtaposit ion of Jaks. This results in 
transphosphorylation and activation of their kinase activity and the 
phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins such as Stats, Src-
kinases, and adaptors such as Shc, Grb2, and Cbl.4  
Abnormalities of Jak function have been associated with a number of 
disorders. For example, chromosomal translocations resulting in TEL-JAK2 
constructs lead to the constitutive activation of STAT5, IL-3-independent 
cellular proliferation, and l eukemogenesis. The translocation 
t(9;12)(p24;p13) results in the fusion of the kinase catalytic region of JAK2 
with the transcription factor TEL generating the constitutively active TEL-
JAK2. Similarly, infection with oncogenic viruses such as human T-cell 
lymphotrophic virus, type I, and Abelson murine leukemia viruses results in 
enhanced kinase activity of Jaks , possibly accounting for their leukemogenic 
potential.  
The STAT transcription factors are coded by six known mammalian genes 
and include 10 different STAT proteins including different isomers of STATs 
1, 3, 4, and 5. Like other transcription factors STATs have a well-defined 
structure including a DNA-binding domain, a conserved NH 2-terminal 
domain, a COOH-terminal transactivation domain, and SH2 and SH3 
domains. Their activation through tyrosine phosphorylation results in their 
dimerization and translocation into the nucleus where they activate specific 
genes.4  
Jak proteins activate a number of  intracellular signaling proteins, among 
which STATs are the best defined. Binding of a cytokine to its receptor 
rapidly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domains of the 
receptor by activated Jak kinases, thus providing a docking site for STAT 
proteins, which are then phosphorylated. This phosphorylation of STATs 
leads to their homo- or heterodimeri zation and translocation to the nucleus, 
followed by DNA binding and gene acti vation. The specificity for STAT 
phosphorylation is determined by the receptor docking sites and not the Jak 
kinases. Also, different STAT pr oteins have different DNA-binding affinities, 
resulting in activation of specific genes. STATs also interact with other 
transcription factors such as the p300/cyclic AMP-responsive element 
binding protein family of coactivators to activate genes. The transcriptional 
activity of STATs may also be regulated by the phosphorylation of their 
serine and threonine residues, although the implications of such regulation 
are not known.  
Protocol Number 2007-0925

 STATs mediate diverse and sometimes opposite cellular events affecting 
growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. For example, STATs can mediate 
both growth arrest and cellular proliferation. Specifically, STAT1 mediates 
the growth-inhibitory effects of IFN-
 , through the induction of the CDKI 
p21waf1, whereas STAT5 mediates proliferat ive effects of IL-3 and GM-CSF. 
Similarly, phosphorylation of STAT3 can result both in IL-6- and IL-10-
induced growth arrest, and in GM-CSF- and IL-3-induced proliferation. 
STATs also modulate cellular differentiation and apoptosis. Reconstitution of 
STAT1 in STAT1-null U3A cells (which do not respond to TNF-
 ) restores 
basal caspase expression and renders them sensitive to TNF-induced 
apoptosis. Conversely, STAT3 and STAT5 mediate the antiapoptotic effects 
of IL-6 and IL-2, respec tively. STAT1 activates the caspase cascade 
through up-regulation of Fas and FasL expression in response to IFN-
 . The 
exact mechanisms underlying these diverse effects are being elucidated.4  
Abnormalities of the JAK-STAT pathways have been described in a variety 
of leukemias and their inhibition c an be a goal for leukemia therapy.

4. TREATMENT PLAN 
 
4.1  Dose of INCB018424 and Treatment Cycle 
 
This is a phase II study of oral INCB018424 in  patients with relapsed/refractory 
AML, ALL, and MDS (including CMML), and blast phase or tyrosine kinase 
refractory CML. The starting dose of  INCB018424 will be 25 mg po twice daily, 
which has been determined to be the maxi mum tolerated dose in patients with 
myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia and a dose that is tolerated for ten days in 
normal human volunteers.    INCB018424 will be administered orally at  a dose of 25 mg BID for 7 days each 
week for 4 weeks (cycle number 1).  Pati ents will be evaluated after 1 full cycle of 
therapy (28 days) for response.  Res ponding patients or patients with stable 
disease will be allowed to continue on study at a dose of 25 mg INCB018424 BID 
until progression. The respons e assessment for the purpose  of study statistical 
evaluation will be after two cycles (8 weeks) of therapy.  Patients with 
progressive disease, based on clinical and laboratory evaluatio n, will, at the 
discretion of the Investigator , either be removed from the study or, as long as the 
25 mg BID dose has been well tolerated, dose escalated to 50 mg INCB018424 BID. In instances of dose escalation to 50mg BID, patients will be evaluated after 
Protocol Number 2007-0925 
October 13, 2008 
Page 10 of 36 
 1 full cycle of therapy (28 days) for respons e and toxicity.  At that point, patients 
with continued progressive disease, based on clinical and labor atory evaluation, 
will be removed from the study.  In inst ances of dose escalation, the response 
assessment for the purpose of study statisti cal evaluation will be after two cycles 
(8 weeks) of therapy at the 50 mg BID dose.    
 
Patients with chronic phase CML who have fa iled at least 2 prior tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors and do not have a standard tr ansplant option will be assessed for 
response after 3 months of therapy in the absence of loss of disease control and they may continue therapy if they demons trate any clinical benefit. Patients with 
chronic phase CML will not be allowed to have the dose escalation as this population has less of a life-th reatening disease situation. 
   Patients who, in the opinion of the Inve stigator, are demonstrating cytopenias not 
thought to be related to disease progr ession and who may be receiving benefit 
from treatment may, at t he discretion of the Investi gator, be dose adjusted to a 
lower dose of INCB018424 BID or an equivalent dose given daily (see section on 
dose modifications below).  Studies in subjects with myelofibrosis with myeloid 
metaplasia using different doses and sc hedules of INCB18424 may be used as a 
guide to dose adjustments in this study.  Patients will initiate the first cycle of t herapy at MDACC. They will have weekly 
visits at their local physician’s office  with physical exam and review of symptoms 
during cycle one. In the absence of intolerabl e side effects, patients may return to 
the local oncologist for laboratory tests, but only MDACC investigators can make treatment decisions.  Patients will re turn to MDACC every 4 weeks to be 
evaluated and receive their new supply of study medication.  For the second and 
third cycle, patients will return to MD ACC every 4 weeks to be evaluated and 
receive their new supply of  study medication.  Subsequently, patients will return 
to MDACC every three months. Because of drug stability issues, some patients 
may have to continue to be seen on a monthly basis to have the drug provided.  For toxicity evaluation, patients enroll ed in the study will be considered in 2 
cohorts (I) those with relapsed/refractor y AML, ALL, and MDS (including CMML), 
and blast phase CML, and (II) those with ch ronic phase CML. At any time after 6 
patients are enrolled in cohort I (inclu ding AML, ALL, MDS, blast phase CML 
patients), if 30% or more patients experience grade 3 or 4 toxicity thought to be 
directly related to INCB 018424 and lasting longer than 2 weeks, then we will stop 
that cohort of the trial. At any time after 6 patients are enrolled in cohort II 
(including chronic phase CML patients), if 15% or more patients experience 
grade 3 or 4 toxicity thought to be dire ctly related to INCB018424 and lasting 
longer than 2 weeks, then we will  stop that cohort of the trial.

 4.2 Administration of INCB018424 
 
This is an open label, non-randomized, study of INCB0 18424, administered 
orally to patients with relapsed/refra ctory AML, ALL, and MDS (including 
CMML), and blast phase or tyrosine kinas e refractory CML.  The study of 
INCB018424 in each disease listed will be conducted in two parts.  The first 
part is intended to enroll a maximum of 10 patients within each of the four 
disease categories included in this study  and to identify whether significant 
benefit is observed.  If a minimum of one patient shows benefit that is considered significant, there will be an expanded cohort of 20 additional patients treated in that  arm of the study.  
  
Patients will receive 50 mg/day administered orally in two divided doses (i.e., 
BID: every 12 hours ± 2 hours).  Within each arm of the study, three patients 
will be initially treated and observed for toxicity for one treatment cycle (28 
days) before the additional seven patients are entered. Dose reduction will be 
considered if the number of patients ex periencing grade 3 or higher toxicities 
exceed 2/3, 3/4, 4/7, 5/10, 6/14, 7/18, 8/22, 9/26.  Treatment will be 
administered primarily on an outpatient basis, but can be administered as an 
inpatient if the patient is hos pitalized for other reasons.   
 The 5 mg tablets have been shown to be st able when stored up to one month 
at 25ºC/60%RH and 40ºC/75%RH; the 25 mg tablets have been shown to be stable when stored for three months at 25º/60%RH and 40º/75%RH.  (25ºC = 
77ºF, 40ºC = 104ºF). 
  
 4.3 Supportive Care Guidelines 
  
Supportive measures incl uding erythropoietin, analgesics, blood transfusions, 
antimicrobials, and hematopoiet ic colony stimulating fa ctors for treatment of 
cytopenias are permitted. 
 Prophylactic use of  hematopoietic colony stimulati ng factors  is not permitted.

  4.4 Duration of Therapy 
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may 
continue until one of the following criteria applies: 
 
˜ Lack of objective response after 2 cycles  of therapy (3 cycl es if there is 
dose escalation to 50 mg BID afte r cycle 1) unless INCB018424 is 
considered to be of clinic al benefit to the patient 
 ˜ Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment 
 ˜ Unacceptable adverse event(s)  ˜ Patient decides to withdr aw from the study, or 
 ˜ General or specific ch anges in the patient’s condi tion render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in  the judgment of the investigator. 
 
 4.5 Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications 
 
Dose Adjustments 
 
The dose of INCB018424 will be adjusted according to the guidelines shown 
in the following tables for INCB018424 - related clinically  significant toxicity.  If 
a toxicity is not covered in the tabl e, doses may be reduced or held at the 
discretion of the investigator for the pat ient’s safety.  Dose adjustments for 
hematological toxicity are based on the blood counts obtai ned in preparation 
for the day of treatment i.e. CBC within 3 days of Day 1 of that cycle.   
 Patients will be withdrawn from  the study if they fail to recover to CTC AE 
grade 0 to 2 (or within 1 gr ade of starting values for pre-existing laboratory 
abnormalities) from a treat ment-related toxicity within 2 weeks (leading to 
treatment delay of > 2 weeks) unless t he investigator feels that the patient 
should remain in the study because of  evidence that the patient is/may 
continue deriving benefit from continuing study treatment. 
 Patients with toxicities that are manageable with s upportive therapy may not 
require dose reductions.  Patients r equiring greater than 1 dose reduction of 
INCB018424 should be withdr awn from the study, unless INCB018424 is 
considered to be of clinical benefit to the patient.  Dose modification for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia grade 4 persisting 
beyond 2 weeks of therapy is allowed if the treating physi cian believes them 
to be related to the treatment and not the underlying disease. The dose can 
be held until the AE is to grade 2 or lo wer; then INCB018424 will be restarted 
at 15 mg BID or an equivalent dose given daily. Alternatively, at the discretion 
Protocol Number 2007-0925 
October 13, 2008 
Page 13 of 36 
 of the treating physician, the dose may be reduced to 15 mg BID without 
holding the drug if the treating physician be lieves that the cytopenia is related 
to a combined effect of t he drug and uncontrolled disease. 
 
 
Dosing for INCB018424- Related Toxicities 
 
NCI CTC AE Grade INCB018424 
Grade 0-2 non-hematological to xicity No dose reduction. 
Grade 2 toxicities that are persistent and intolerable (e.g. stomatitis) can result in dose delays or dose reduction to 15 mg BID in Cycle 2 or beyond. 
Grade 3-4 clinically significant non-hematological toxicity Hold until recover to NCI CTC AE grade 0-2 If recovery occurs within 2 weeks after treatment has been held, dose should be reduced to 10 mg or 15 mg BID.  At the discretion of the investigator and if the patient is considered to be benefiting, the patient will receive an intermittent dose schedule, alternating treatment periods and recovery periods at the 25 mg BID dose. i.e alterations to the dose and schedule that is thought to be beneficial to  the patient in the 
responding patients may be allowed after discussion with IRB, FDA and the PI. 
   
4.6  Concomitant medications  
INCB018424 is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. 
      The potential for INCB018124 to inhibi t or induce human Cytochrome P450 
enzymes has been extensively investigated.  The available data suggests that the 
potential for INCB018124 to cause clinical drug interaction via CYP inhibition is low. 
Furthermore, in vitro data suggest that the potential for INCB018124 to induce 
CYP3A4 is also low. Theref ore there is little potential to interact with other drugs.

a. Informed consent must be obtained at Screening.  At Screening and Day 1, assess eligibility for study entry and review eligi bility for 
study entry on Day 1. 
b. Medical history will be done at each visit. Medication history will be obtained only at the screening visit. 
c. A complete examination will be performed at Screening and the End-of-Study Visit . A “targeted” examination will be performe d at 
all other visits.  During the treatment phase, weekly visits at the local physician’s office are required during 1st cycle of t herapy with 
a review of constitutional symptoms and physical exam, incl uding transfusion requirement. During 2nd and 3rd cycles visits are 
every 4 weeks, and then every 3 months thereafter.  All examinations will include body weight.  On Day 1 of Cycle 1, before PK/ PD 
blood-draws, the vital signs will be done as well as with the physical exams.  On all other clinical visits vital signs are tak en once. 
Overall response assessments will be graded according to consensus criteria for treatment response.  
Protocol Number 2007-0925 
October 13, 2008 
Page 16 of 36 
 d. Overall response assessments are required on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, and 4 and then every 3 months thereafter.  If the dose of 
INCB018424 is escalated to 50 mg BID after cycle 1, then overall re sponse assessments are required on Day 1 of Cycles 3, 4, and 
5 and then every 3 months thereafter. 
e. ECOG performance criteria must be 0, 1 or 2 at screening.  ECOG assessment is required on Day 1 of 2nd and 3rd cycles and 
thereafter every scheduled subsequent visit on Day 1. 
f. All medications received within 30 days prior to the Screeni ng Visit are to be recorded. Reassessments will be done weekly at the 
local physician’s office during 1st cycle of therapy and then ev ery 4 weeks during 2nd and 3rd cycles and thereafter every 3 mo nths 
during scheduled visits. 
g. Serum chemistry (Sodium, potassium, chloride, CO 2, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, 
AST or ALT, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, uric acid, lactic dehydrogenase)  is required every week 
during the 1st cycle and every two weeks during Cycles 2 and 3, and at each scheduled subsequent visit.  Urinalysis is required 
only at screening and at the end of study visit.  Hepatitis serology and HIV laboratory test will be performed only during the 
Screening Visit if there are no results available from past 3 months. A pregnancy test will be obtained at screening.  Urine pregnancy test will then be performed if there is a suspicion of pregnancy. A serum pregnancy test will be performed to confirm  
positive results obtained from a urine test.  FSH test will only be performed on females who have been amenorrheic for >1 year,  
and if levels are elevated no further pregnancy testing is required for these female patients.   
h. Complete blood count (CBC) including absolute neutrophil count and platelet count are required weekly for Cycle 1, 2 and 3 a nd 
every two weeks for subsequent visits.   
i. Bone marrow aspiration or biopsy will be taken during the screening phase (within 4 weeks of starting drug), and at start of  Cycle 4 
(± 7 days), Cycle 7 (± 7 days), and thereafter at start of each 6
th subsequent cycle (+/- 7days).  Evaluation will include staining for 
fibrosis and cytogenetics if abnormal prior to therapy.   Cytogenetic studies will be repeated only in patients with abnormalit ies at 
baseline, on Day 1 of Cycles 4 and 7 and thereafter on Day 1 of each 6th subsequent cycle(+/-7days).  If unable to obtain BM 
aspirate, cytogenetics may also be done on peripheral blood collected for PD/PK analysis.  
j. Instruct patient that the dose is to be taken at 12 hour intervals at approximately the same time each day. The first dose of each 
day should be taken in the morning.   
k. For Cycle 1, PK samples to be collected on Day 1 at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, and if possible 8  hours after administr ation of the 
morning dose of INCB018424. For Cycles 2 and 3, a PK sample will be collected at pre-dose on Day 1.   
l. For Cycle 1, plasma and whole blood PD samples will be collected on Day 1 at pre-dose and 2, hours after administration of t he 
morning dose of INCB018424.  For Cycles 2, 3, and each subsequent scheduled visit to MDACC, plasma and whole blood PD samples will be collected at pre-dose on Day 1.  Final PD sample will be collected at End-Of–Study visit. Not all samples may b e 
collected on all patients.  See Appendix F. 
m. Adverse events (AEs) considered related to study medication must be followed until resolution, start of a different treatmen t therapy 
or no longer considered to be clinically relevant in the opinion  of the investigator. During the treatment phase, AE assessment is 
required weekly at the local physician’s o ffice during 1st cycle of therapy. During the 2nd and 3rd cycles assessments are requ ired 
every 4 weeks, and then every visit thereafter. 
n. Compliance should be checked at each scheduled clinical visit.  Any unused drug in sealed bottles will be returned to Incyte  or its 
designee.  MDACC will follow internal procedures to des troy and dispose of unused drug in open/unsealed bottles.

7. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Methods 
 7.1 Pharmacokinetic Methods  
7.1.1 Blood Collection  
On Days 1 of Cycle 1, PK blood sample s will be obtained pr e-dose, 0.5, 1, 
1.5, 2, 4, 6 and if possi ble, 8 hours after administration of the morning 
dose of the study medication. PK sa mples will also be obtained pre-dose 
on Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3.  The exact date and time of the PK blood 
draws will be recorded along with the dat e and time of the last dose of 
study medication preceding the blood draw.    See Appendix F for spec ific information regarding the procedures for PK 
blood sample collection, processing and shipment. 
 
7.1.2 Bioanalytical Methodology 
 
The plasma samples will be analyzed for INCB018424 by a validated 
LC/MS/MS assay, carried out by Incyt e Corporation (Wilmington, DE) or 
Incyte’s designee. 
 
7.1.3 Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
 
The limited amount of plasma concent ration data from this study, will be 
pooled with the results of a Phase 1 st udy in healthy volunteers to perform 
the population PK analysis. If there is sufficient demographic diversity in the population, an attempt will be made to evaluate the effect of demographic characteristics and baseli ne characteristics (e.g., age, 
weight, sex, race, renal function, smok ing history, etc.) on the population 
PK profile. 
 7.2 Pharmacodynamic Method  
7.2.1 Blood Collection  
 
On Day 1 of Cycle 1 (at pre-dose and 2 hours after dose), and on Day 1 of 
Cycles 2 and 3 (pre-dose sample only) venous whole blood samples will be 
obtained for both whole blood and plasma PD markers according to the Study 
Protocol Number 2007-0925 
October 13, 2008 
Page 26 of 36 
 calendar.  Collection of a plasma PD sample will be done on Day 1 of 
subsequent cycles as described in Section 5.2. The exact date and time of the 
blood draws will be recorded along with the date and time of the last dose of 
study medication preceding the blood draw.   
 See Appendix F for specif ic information regarding the procedures for PD blood 
sample collection, processing and shipment. 
 
7.2.2 Pharmacodynamic Analysis 
 
The whole blood PD samples will be evaluated both unstimulated and following 
stimulation with a cytokine (e.g., IL-6) to  activate the JAK/STAT pathways and 
then analyzed for both basal and activated le vels of JAKs and STATs, including 
phosphorylated STAT3 and STAT5.  Phos phorylated STAT3 and STAT5 will be 
measured using phospho-specific STAT3 a nd STAT5 ELISAs.  For each patient, 
the percent inhibition of phosphorylated STAT3 and/or STAT5 will be calculated 
by comparing predose values with values ob tained at different times after dosing.  
Additional PD markers (e.g ., monitoring other cell sign aling pathways, measuring 
specific cell populations or measuring ce ll surface markers that can be measured 
by flow cytometry, Western blot or ELISA) may be evaluated utilizing excess 
whole blood PD samples.  In addition, using the plasma PD sample , changes in plasma cytokine levels and 
markers of disease activity will be monito red over time using specific ELISAs.  
For each patient, the percent change in le vel will be calculated by comparing 
predose values with values obtained at diffe rent times after dos ing.  Additional 
PD markers (e.g., other cytokine levels , chemokine levels or other non-genomic 
protein markers that can be measured by Western blot or ELISA) may be 
evaluated utilizing excess PD or PK sample s.  These analyses will be carried out 
by Incyte Corporation (Wilmingt on, DE) or Incyte’s designee. 
 7.3 Bone Marrow Aspiration, Biopsy and Cytogenetics  
Bone marrow aspiration or biopsy will be taken pre-dose during the screening 
phase and at Day 1 ± 7 days of Cycle 4, Day 1 of Cycle 7 ± 7 days and thereafter 
on Day 1 ± 7 days of each 6th subsequent cycle.  This includes staining and determination of cytogenetics if  abnormal prior to therapy.  
 
7.3.1 Bone Marrow Assessment  
 
The bone marrow biopsy or aspirate should be assessed by an 
experienced hematopathologist using his/ her standard examination.  Bone 
marrow evaluation will include staini ng, cytogenetics if abnormal prior to 
therapy and mutation analysis if present prior to therapy.   
  
Protocol Number 2007-0925 
October 13, 2008 
Page 27 of 36 
 7.3.2 Cytogenetics 
 
Cytogenetic studies will be repeated only in patients with abnormalities at 
baseline on Day 1 of Cycle 4, Day 1 of Cycle 7 and thereafter on Day 1 of 
each 6th subsequent cycle. This will be generally done on the bone marrow samples provided at the defined time points but may also be done 
on peripheral blood collected at thes e time points in the event bone 
marrow aspirate could not be obtained.   The cytogenetic testing laboratory 
will provide specific instructions to the Investigators. 
 8.  REGULATORY AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
Adverse event reporting will be as per the current NCI criteria and the MDACC Adverse Event Reporting Policy for Leukemia Phase I and early Phase II studies. 
 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) vers ion 3.0 will be utilized for adverse event 
reporting. (http://ctep.cancer.gov /reporting/ctc.html).   
 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE) 
 
A serious adverse event is – any adverse dr ug experience occurring at any dose that 
results in any of t he following outcomes:  
 
• Death 
• A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places 
the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the 
adverse experience as it occurred. It  does not include an adverse experience 
that, had it occurred in a more se vere form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prol ongation of existing hospitalization 
• A persistent or significant disability/in capacity – a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
 Important medical event s that may not result in death,  be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious  adverse drug experience when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may j eopardize the patient or subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to  prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such  medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at home, bl ood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospitalizat ion, or the development  of drug dependency or 
drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).   
Protocol Number 2007-0925 
October 13, 2008 
Page 28 of 36 
 • Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered 
serious adverse events. Any important  medical event can and should be 
reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by the Principal Investigator or 
Sponsor. 
 
• All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of 
a SAE must by reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in  “University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center 
Institutional Review Board Policy ”. SAEs must be reported to the IRB and the Sponsor (Safety Project Manager) regardless of attribution. 
 
• All life-threatening or fatal events  with possible, probable or  definite attribution 
to the study drug must have a written report faxed within 24 hours  (next working 
day) of knowledge of the event to the Sa fety Project Manager in the Office of 
Research Education and Regulatory Management (ORE&RM) (fax 713-792-9631). The sponsor representative should be notified by phone at 713-563-0379 to confirm receipt of the fax.   
 
• The MDACC Internal Adverse Event Re porting Form will be used for 
reporting to the IRB and the Sponsor (Safety Project Manager ORE&RM).  
 
• Serious adverse events will be captured from the time the patient signs 
consent until 30 days after the last dose of drug. Serious adverse events 
must be followed until clinical recover y is complete and laboratory test 
have returned to baseline, progression of  the event has stabilized, or there 
has been acceptable resolution of the event. 
 
• Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the 30 day time 
period that are related to the study tr eatment must be reported to the IRB 
and the Sponsor (Safety Project Mana ger ORE&RM). This may include the 
development of a secondary malignancy. 
 
Reporting to FDA:  
• Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by the Sponsor (Safety Project 
Manager ORE&RM) according to 21 CFR 312.32. 
 
It is the responsibility of the PI and the research team to ensure serious adverse 
events are reported according to the Code of Federal Regulations, Good Clinical 
Practices, the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional 
Review Board policy. 
  
 
 
 
Protocol Number 2007-0925

 8.1  Expedited Adverse Event Reporting 
 
Leukemia associated symptoms are not to be reported as  adverse events on this 
protocol. Myelosuppression and associated complication are expected events during 
leukemia therapy and are part of the treatment success (marrow emptying of 
leukemia cells).  Therefore, myelosuppre ssion and associated complications such as 
fever, infections, bleeding, and related hos pitalization will be reported in the study 
summary.  Only prolonged myelosuppression, as  defined by the NCI criteria specific 
for leukemia, i.e. marrow cellularity <5% on day 42 or later (6 weeks) from start of 
therapy without evidence of leukemia, will be reported as an SAE and considered in 
defining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).  
Admission to the hospital for administration of a new cycle of treatment does not 
require expedited reporting. SAEs occurring in  patients registered to the trial but not 
receiving any protocol agents (ie occurring before protocol treat ment) do not require 
expedited reporting.   For this protocol, the following adverse events are specifically excluded from expedited AE reporting: 
 
 
CTCAE Category  
Adverse Event  Grade Hospitalization/ Prolongation of Hospitalization  Comments 
 
Blood/Bone marrow/ 
Infection  ↓Hemoglobin, leukocytes (total 
WBC), lymphopenia, ↓neutrophils/ 
granulocytes (ANC/AGC), 
↓ platelets, fever, sepsis  1-4   Yes Do not require expedited reporting 
 Gastrointestinal  Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis  1-3  Yes Hospitalization for grade 3 AEs does not require expedited reporting 
 Metabolic/laboratory  ↓K,↓Mg, ↓ Na, ↓ glucose, ↑K, 
↑Mg, ↑ glucose, ↑uric acid,↑ LDH 
Or other metoablic indeces  1-4  Yes Do not require expedited reporting unless hospitalized for management 
 
9. STATISTICS 
 
9.1 Study Population  
All patients who received at least one dose of  study medication will be included in 
the safety analyses.  
 
9.1.1 Selection of Sample Size 
 
This phase II study will use a Gehen’s design. Assuming a null response rate of 0%, targeting a 15% response rate and power=80%, the tr ial will initially 
enroll 10 patients in each disease category:   1) AML; 2) A LL; 3) MDS; and 4) 
CML. If at least one response is achieved in the 10 patients in a disease   
Protocol Number 2007-0925 
October 13, 2008 
Page 30 of 36 
 Category, then a total of 30 patients will be enrolled in this disease category. 
Thirty patients will provide a confidence interval for response rate with half-
width=0.13, assuming the true response rate  is 15%. The total sample size is 
120. 
 
 For toxicity evaluation, patients enroll ed in the study will be considered in 2 
cohorts (I) those with relapsed/refractor y AML, ALL, and MDS (including CMML), 
and blast phase CML, and (II) those with ch ronic phase CML. At any time after 6 
patients are enrolled in cohort I (inclu ding AML, ALL, MDS, blast phase CML 
patients), if 30% or more patients experience grade 3 or 4 toxicity thought to be 
directly related to INCB 018424 and lasting longer than 2 weeks, then we will stop 
that cohort of the trial. At any time after 6 patients are enrolled in cohort II 
(including chronic phase CML patients), if 15% or more patients experience 
grade 3 or 4 toxicity thought to be dire ctly related to INCB018424 and lasting 
longer than 2 weeks, then we will  stop that cohort of the trial. 
 
 
9.2  Efficacy and PK/PD Variables 
 
The efficacy variables include  
 Clinical response 
 Cytogenetic response 
 The PK and PD variables will include: 
o Determination of the PK of INCB018424 by measuring plasma 
concentration time profiles.  
o Determination of PD markers includ ing % inhibition of STAT3/5 protein 
phosphorylation 
 
9.2.1  Efficacy and PK/PD Analysis 
 
Efficacy analyses will be exploratory in nature.  All efficacy measures will be 
estimated with 95% confidence interval s at the dose used in the expanded 
cohort.  The clinical response and the hematological response will be estimated with 95% confidence interval s at each time point.  The response 
rates over time may be analyzed graphi cally or using a statistical model. 
 The PK parameters of INB018424 will be summarized using descriptive statistics, and the log-transfo rmed INCB018424 PK parameters will be 
compared using a 1-factor analysis of variance.  The mean values of the PK parameters may be compared to historical data in healthy volunteers to 
determine if the INCB018424 PK profile is different between patients with 
hematological malignancies  and healthy patients. 
 For each patient who has taken study m edication, the PD parameters will be 
calculated to explore preliminary evidence of PD activity by assessing the 
Protocol Number 2007-0925 
October 13, 2008 
Page 31 of 36 
 effect of INCB018424 on pre-  and post-dose.  If the p-STAT3/5 signaling data 
are sufficiently robust, an explorat ory PK/PD analysis will be performed. 
 
9.3  Safety Analysis 
 
The clinical safety data (vital signs, EC Gs, routine laborator y tests and adverse 
events) will be analyzed using summary statis tics (e.g., mean, frequency) and no 
formal statistical comparisons among the treatment gro ups are planned. 
 
9.3.1  Adverse Events 
 Severity of adverse events will be  based on the NCI–CTCAE v3.0 (NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Publ. Aug 9, 2006). The subset of adverse events that are cons idered by the Investigator to have a 
possible or probable relationship to st udy medication will be considered to be 
treatment-related adverse ev ents.  If the Investigat or does not specify the 
relationship of the adverse event to study medication, the adverse event will 
be considered to be treatment-related.  The incidence of adverse events and 
treatment-related adverse events will be tabulated.  
 9.3.2  Clinical Laboratory Tests 
 Laboratory test values outside the no rmal range will be assessed for drug 
association based on screening and baseline va lues and for severity based on 
the normal ranges for the clinical refe rence laboratory.  The incidence of 
abnormal laboratory values and shift t ables relative to baseline will be 
tabulated.    
9.3.3  Vital Signs 
 Descriptive statistics and mean change from baseline will be determined for vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory ra te and body temperature) 
at each assessment time.  Vital sign re sults will be reviewed for clinically 
notable abnormalities and pati ents exhibiting clinically notable vital sign 
abnormalities that were not present at screening or baseline will be listed. 
 
9.4  Study Definitions 
 
Survival, time to progressi on, time to treatment failu re, and duration of response 
will be presented using Kaplan-Meier curves for each patient group 
  9.4.1    Survival  
"Survival" is defined as the period of time from date of first study drug  
administration to the date of deat h or date patient withdrawn from 
study. 
Protocol Number 2007-0925 
October 13, 2008 
Page 32 of 36 
  
  9.4.2    Time to Progression 
 
"Time to Progression" is defined as t he period of time from the date of  
first study drug administration to the date that the patient is withdrawn  
because of clinical or radiographic progressive disease or death from  
any cause.   
 
9.4.3    Time to Treatment Failure 
 
"Time to Treatment Failure " is defi ned as the period of time from the  
date of first study drug administrati on to the date of wit hdrawal from the 
study for any reason other  than study closure. 
 
  9.4.4     Duration of Response 
 
"Duration of Response " is defined as the period of time from the date 
of first objective response to the date of progression. "Duration of 
Response" is defined for patients with an objective response only. 
 
 9.4.5 Time to Response 
 
"Time of Response " is defined as t he period of time from the date of 
first study drug administration until the first objective documentation of 
response.    
 
  9.4.6 Intent-to-Treat Data Set 
 
The Intent-to-Treat Data Set will in clude all patients who receive at 
least one dose (full or partial  dose) of study drug.   
 
9.5  Reporting and Exclusions 
 
9.5.1   Evaluation of toxicity .   
   All patients will be evaluable for toxi city from the time  of their first 
treatment with INCB018424. 
 
9.5.2 Evaluation of response .   
  All patients included in  the study must be assessed for response to 
treatment, unless there ar e major protocol treatment deviations or they 
are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories:  1) complete response,  2) partial response, 3) stable 
disease, 4) progressive diseas e, 5) early death from malignant 
disease, 6) early death from toxici ty, 7) early death because of other

 cause, or 8) unknown (not assessable,  insufficient data).  [Note:  By 
arbitrary convention, category 9 usually designates the “unknown” 
status of any type of data in a clinical database.]  
 
10.0 ETHICS 
 
10.1 Institutional Review Boar d or Ethics Review Committee 
 It is the responsibility of the Investigator to assure that all aspects of the ethics review are conducted in accordance with the current Declaration of Helsinki as described in the International Conferenc e on Harmonisation (ICH) E6: Guideline 
for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and/or  local laws, whichever provides the 
greatest level of protection for the study participants.  The protocol and any information supplied to the patient to obtain informed consent, including written informed consent form(s), patient recrui tment procedures (e.g., advertisements), 
and written information to be provided to pat ients (information leaflets), must be 
reviewed and approved by a qualified IRB/ ERC prior to enrollment of participants 
in the study.  Amendments to the protocol and revisions to the informed consent must also be 
submitted to and, if required,  approved by the IRB/ERC. 
 At intervals required by the IRB/ERC, but not less than annually, the Investigator 
must submit to the IRB/ERC a progress report with a request for re-evaluation 
and re-approval of the study.    
After completion or termination of the study, the Investigator must submit a final 
report to the IRB/ERC.  This  report should include:  dev iations from the protocol, 
the number and types of participants eval uated, the number of participants who 
discontinued (with reasons),  results of the study, if  known, and significant 
adverse events, including deaths that o ccurred during the conduct of the study. 
 The Investigator, as part of the records retention requirements for the study, must 
maintain documentation of all submissions, correspondence, and approvals to and from the IRB/ERC.  Each clinical Investigator is responsible to conduct the study in accordance with the protocol, all applicable laws, regulations, and GCP according to ICH guidelines.  
10.2 Informed Consent 
 
Before being enrolled in the clinical st udy, patients must cons ent to participate 
after the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study have been explained in a form understandable to them.    
Protocol Number 2007-0925 
October 13, 2008 
Page 34 of 36 
 An informed consent document that incl udes both information about the study 
and the consent form will be prepared and given to the patient.  This document 
will include all elements r equired by the ICH, GCP, and applicable regulatory 
requirements, and must adhere to GCP and to  the ethical principles that have 
their origin in the Declarat ion of Helsinki.  Prior to the beginning of the study, the 
Investigator must have the IRB/ERC’s written approval/favorable opinion of the 
written informed consent form and any other information to be provided to the patients.  The document must be in a language understandable to the patient and must 
specify who informed the pat ient.  Where required by local law, the person who 
informs the patient must be a physician.  After reading the informed consent documen t, the patient must give consent in 
writing.  The patient’s consent must be c onfirmed at the time of consent by the 
personally dated signature of  the patient and by the per sonally dated signature of 
the person conducting the info rmed consent discussions. 
 If the patient is unable to read, oral pr esentation and explanation of the written 
informed consent form and information to be supplied to patients must take place in the presence of an impartial witness.  Consent must be confirmed at the time 
of consent orally and by t he personally dated signature of the patient or by a local 
legally recognized alternative (e.g., the patient’s thumbprint or mark).  The 
witness and the person conducting the in formed consent discussions must also 
sign and personally date the consent document.  
A copy of the signed consent document must be given to the patient.  The 
original signed consent document will be retained by the Investigator. 
 The Investigator will not undertake any m easures specifically required only for 
the clinical study until valid consent has been obtained.  The Investigator must inform the patient ’s primary physician about the patient’s 
participation in the trial if  the patient has a primary physician and if the patient 
agrees to the primary ph ysician being informed. 
 
10.2.1 Update of Informed Consent  The informed consent and any other in formation provided to patients or 
the patient’s legally acceptable representative, should be revised 
whenever important new information becomes  available that is relevant to 
the patient’s consent, and should re ceive IRB/ERC approval/favorable 
opinion prior to use.  The Investi gator, or a person designated by the 
Investigator should fully inform the patient or the patient’s legally acceptable representative of  all pertinent aspects of the study and of any 
new information relevant to the patient’s willingness to continue 
Protocol Number 2007-0925

1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Title:  A Prospective, Multi-Center, Single -Arm, Real World  Study Assessing the 
Clinical Use of the Caterpillar™ Arterial  Embolization Device for Arterial 
Embolization in the Peripheral Vasculature  
Sponsor:  Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  
1625 West 3rd Street  
Tempe, AZ 85281 , USA  
Objectives:  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate  the performance and 
safety  of the Caterpillar™ Arterial  Embolization Device when used for 
arterial embolization in the peripheral vasculature in a real world, on- label 
application . 
Design:  The post-market  study is a prospective, multi -center, single -arm, real world  
study of the Caterpillar™ Arterial  Embolization D evice . Follow -up for all 
treated subjects will be performed at  30 days , as well as  6 and 12 months  
post-Index Procedure . 
Study Device : The Caterpillar™ Arterial  Embolization Device  (Caterpillar™ Micro  and 
Caterpillar™) is a self-expanding arterial  occlusion plug, intended for arterial 
embolization in the peripheral vasculature. The device is  intended to be a 
permanent implant and consist s of the following com ponents : a cobalt -
chrome stem, nickel -titanium fibers, platinum -iridium radiopaque marker 
bands and a  polyurethane and polyethylene occlusion membrane.  
  
The Caterpillar™ Arterial  Embolization Device  is packaged as a single unit 
with the implant, loader, di spenser hoop , detachable delivery  wire and 
torque tool. The device  is intended for single -use only within a specific 
arterial vessel size range and does  not require over sizing . The available 
sizes, product characteristics, intended arterial vessel diameter range and 
required delivery catheter size (inner diameter  (ID)) are provided in the 
Instructions for Use ( IFU).   
Enrollment:  Enrollment will continue until up to fifty (50)  subjects have been treated with 
the Caterpillar™ Arterial  Embolization Device.  
Study Sites: Up to 20  investigational sites in the United States . 
Study 
Population:  Male or non -pregnant female subjects ≥18 years of age who require arterial 
embolization in the peripheral vasculature.  
Primary  
Endpoints:  Primary Performance Endpoint : 
Technical Success  
Successful  occlusion  of the target embolization  site(s) as confirmed by 
the Investigator via angiographic assessment during the Index 
Procedure. Technical success will be reported for each target 
embolization site.   
Primary Safety Endpoint:  
Freedom from Device- Related Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
Freedom  from device -related serious adverse events (SAE) through 
30-day follow- up.

Secondary 
Endpoints:  Time Point of Occlusion 
The percentage of target embolization  site(s) with occlusion at ≤1, ≤2, ≤3, 
≤4, ≤5, ≤10 and >10 minutes post-treatment.  
Freedom from Recanalization  
Freedom from clinically relevant recanalization of the target embolization  
site(s) through 30-days, 6 and 12-months  follow- up as confirmed by the 
Investigator. Clinically relevant recanalization is defined as rec analization 
through the study device that requires a re- intervention. Freedom from 
recanalization will be reported for each target embolization site. 
 
Freedom from Migration 
Freedom from Migration will be reported for each study device as follows:  
• Freedom from clinically relevant acute migration of the study 
device(s) as confirmed by the Investigator via angiographic 
assessment during the Index Procedure. Clinically relevant 
migration is defined as migration of the study device from the target 
embol ization  site that requires intervention.  
• Freedom from clinically relevant migration of the study device(s) through 30-days, 6 and 12-months  follow- up as confirmed by the 
Investigator. Clinically relevant migration is defined as migration of the study devic e from the target embolization site that requires a re-
intervention.  
 
Freedom from Device and/or Procedure- Related Adverse Events  
Freedom from device and/or procedure- related adverse events (AE) 
through 30-days, 6 and 12- months  follow- up. 
 
Accuracy of Delivery  
Accurate delivery of the study device  to the target embolization site as 
assessed by the Investigator.  
 
Ease of Trackability/Deliverability  
Ease of study device  trackability  and deliverability  as assessed by the 
Investigator.  
 
Ease of Detachment  
Ease of study device detachment as assessed by the Investigator.  
 
Acceptability  of Visibility  
Acceptability of study device visibility under fluoroscopy  as assessed by 
the Investigator.

Inclusion 
Criteria:  Clinical Inclusion Criteria  
1. Subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) must voluntarily 
sign and date the approved Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to 
collection of study -specific data or performance of study -specific  
procedures.  
2. Subject must be either male or non -pregnant female ≥18 years of age 
with an expected lifespan sufficient to allow for collection of primary 
endpoint data . 
3. Subject must be willing and able to comply with protocol 
requirements, including all study visits and procedures.  
4. Subject must require peripheral vascular occlusion  at an arterial  
target embolization  site(s) that can be treated with the Caterpillar™ 
Arterial  Embolization Device according to the Instructions for Use 
(IFU). Note: Per Investigator discretion, up to five (5) Target 
Embolization Sites may be treated with up to ten (10) study devices  
per subject . 
Angiographic Inclusion Criteria  
5. The target embolization site(s) must be located in a native arterial 
vessel(s) with the intended arterial vessel diameter ranges shown in 
the IFU, as assessed by the Investigator (via visual estimate).  
6. The target embolization  site(s) must have a landing zone sufficient to 
accommodate the device implant lengths shown in the IFU.  
 
Exclusion 
Criteria:  Clinical Exclusion Criteria  
1. The subject's access vessel(s) preclude safe insertion of the delivery 
catheter.   
2. The subject’s target embolization site(s) is located within a vein.  
3. The subject’s target embolization site(s) is located within the head, 
neck, heart or coronary vessels.  
4. The subject’s target embolization site(s) is located across highl y 
locomotive joints or muscle beds (e.g. elbow , hip, knee, shoulder, 
thoracic inlet/outlet ).  
5. The subject’s target embolization site(s) is located in  a high -flow 
vessel where, in the opinion of the Investigator, there may be 
significant risk of migration and unintended (non -target site) 
occlusion.  
6. The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to contrast media

9. The subject has a known uncontrolled blood coagulation or bleeding 
disorder.  
10. The subject has an unresolved systemic infection.  
11. The subject’s required pre- operative laboratory tests and/or physical 
examination indicate abnormal results, which, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, would clinically interfere with the study endpoints.  
12. The subject has a connective tissue disorders (e.g. Ehlers -Danlos 
Syndrome), arteritis (e.g. Takayasu’s Disease) or another circulatory 
disorder, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, woul d clinically 
interfere with the study endpoints.  
13. The subject has another medical condition which, in the opinion of 
the Investigator, may cause him/her to be non -compliant with the 
protocol, may confound the data interpretation, or is associated with a life expectancy insufficient to allow for the 
collection of primary 
endpoint data . 
14. The subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or 
another device study that has not completed the study treatment or 
that clinically interferes with the stud y endpoints. Note: Studies 
requiring extended follow -up visits for products that were 
investigational, but have since become commercially available, are 
not considered investigational studies.  
Procedures:  All subjects will undergo an in- office clinical evaluation at the Screening 
Visit (prior to Index Procedure). Subjects that meet Eligibility Criteria will  
undergo additional in- office clinical evaluations and will be treated with the 
Caterpillar™ Arterial  Embolization Device at the Index Procedure visit. An 
in-office follow- up visit or telephone contact will be performed at 30 days,

Amendment 2: February 4,  2013 3 1.0   Introduction  
 
 Stereotactic Body  Radiotherapy (SBRT) is a novel technique in the radiation oncology community.  
SBRT has evolved as a treatment option for malignant skull base lesions, and can be used to treat 
recurrent head and neck cancers (1 -6).   
 
 Nasopharynx cancer has been treated effectively with radiation therapy.  Due to recent advances in 
radiation oncology and the combined use of chemotherapy, improvements in local control and overall 
survival have been obtained over the last decade.  Local recurrence still occurs and generally the outcome 
for salvage treatment has been poor.  Due to the anatomical location of the nasopharynx, recurrent 
nasopharynx cancer is difficult to treat.  SBRT has been use successfully to treat recurrent disease (3 -6).  
In addition to recurrent disease, SBRT has been used successfully as a boost after external beam radiation 
to safel y increase the radiation dose to tumors  (7,8).  
 
For patients with locally recurrent head and neck cancer arising form the oral cavity, oropharyx, 
larynx, or hypopharynx treatment options may be limited.  For patients who have received prior radiation therapy, additional standard external beam radiation therapy may not be an option.  For patients who 
develop recurrence at the skull base, complete surgical resection usually can not be achieved.  Patients 
may experience symptoms which can diminish their quali ty of life.  Pain is a common symptom of 
recurrent head and neck cancer.  Stereotactic body  radiotherapy may provide excellent palliation for 
patients with recurrent head and neck cancers.  Most patients who receive SBRT have excellent palliation 
of pain.  In addition, some patients may achieve long term local control  (9-11).   
 
Chordomas are locally aggressive and destructive tumors with high recurrence rates.  
Chondrosarcomas arise from the skull base and tend to affect lower cranial nerves.  Complete sur gical 
resection is rarely feasible for these lesions.  Various modalities of fractionated radiation therapy have been used to incre ase local control.  Stereotactic body radiotherapy delivers more conformal radiation 
with greater radiobiological effect than conventional radiation therapy.  Compared to conventional 
radiation therapy, SBRT may reduce toxicity to normal surrounding structures and potent ially cause fewer 
complications.  Martin et al. from the University of Pittsburg reported on 28 patients treat ed with SBRT 
as a boost after external beam radiation or as the sole treatment.  The median follow up was 7 years.  The 
five year local control  rate for chondrosarcomas was 80%. The five year local control rate for chordomas 
was 62%.  One patient developed mild dizziness and nausea which was controlled with a two week course 
of corticosteroids.  No long term side effects were reported.  The authors concluded that SBRT is an 
important treatment option for chordomas and chondrosarcomas( 12-15).   
 
     
Amendment 2: February 4,  2013 4 2.0 Objectives  
 
 This study will evaluate the local control rates as well as acute and late toxicity rates of stereotactic 
body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of benign and malignant head and neck tumors.  
 
 2.1 Hypothesis  
  2.1.1 For selected patients wit h primary or recurrent head and neck tumors, stereotactic body 
radiotherapy (SBRT) is technically feasible with acceptable complication rates.

                              carotid body tumor) chordoma, chondrosarco ma, as the sole treatment or to gross  
     residual disease after maximal safe resection  
   - Malignant tumors, such as nasopharynx cancer and squamous cell carcinoma, after  
     initial external beam radiation (Residual Disease Group)  
   - Unresectable malignant tumors, such as nasopharynx cancer and squamous cell  
     carcinoma, adenocarcino ms, and sarcomas which are recurrent after prior radiation   
     (Primary RT Group)    
  2.2.3 Data collected will include baseline patient demographics, pathology data,  radiation 
therapy  procedure, tumor recurrence data,  and toxicities.   
  2.2.4 Follow up data will be collected during the patient’s standard office  visits.  The  
    anticipated duration of this study is 5 years.  
 
 2.3 End Points  
  2.3.1 Primary endpoints will be local control rate and complication rate   
   - Local recurrence is defined as c ancer recurrence within the target volume.  
   -  Local control rate will be evaluated by imaging techniques, physical exam and biopsy,

6.0 Radiation Therapy 
 
 6.1 Target Definition  
  6.1.1 Gross tumor volume (GTV) is contour ed on the planning CT scan.  If available, 
Diagnostic CT scan, MRI and/or PET images may be utilized to construct the GTV by 
registering them to the planning CT dataset.  
  6.1.2 At the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist, the GTV margins may be   
   expanded to form the planning target volume (PTV).  
  
 6.2 Dose -Specification  
  6.2.1 Radiation beams will conform to the PTV outline without additional margin and the  
   dose will be prescribed to the isodose line (IDL) that covers at least 95% of the PTV,  
   which is typically around 80%.  
  6.2.2 SBRT dose -fractionation scheme will be chosen at the discretion of the treating  
   radiation oncologist, but the normal tissue dose constraints should be maintained.  
   Suggested dose -fractionation schemes , derived from the available literature, are listed  
   below.  Also included are the corresponding biologic equivalent dose (BED) for each

    1Cancers are assumed  to have an α /β ratio of approximately 10 
    2Normal tissues are assumed to have an α /β ratio of approximately 3 
 
 6.3 Normal Tissue Dose Constraints  
  6.3.1 Normal tissue dose constraints will depend on whether nearby critical normal tissues  
    have re ceived prior external beam radiation, what dose they received, and the time  
    between prior radiation and the current SBRT treatment course.  These dose limits  
    will ultimately be determined by the treatment radiation oncologist.  For patients who  
    have received prior radiation therapy, every effort should be taken to limit the  
    cumulative doses to adjacent critical normal tissues as follows based on standard  
    fractionation schemes (1.8 -2 Gy per day):  
    Spinal cord – Dmax = 50 Gy 
    Brainstem – Dmax = 60 Gy 
    Optic Nerves – Dmax = 50 Gy 
    Optic Chiasm -  Dmax = 54 Gy 
  6.3.2 For patients in whom SBRT  is planned following initial standard-  
    fractionation wide -field external beam radiation  (Residual D isease  Group) , the initial  
    radiation course should be  designed to limit exposure to adjacent critical normal  
    tissues as follows:  
    Spinal cord – Dmax = 40 Gy 
Amendment 2: February 4,  2013 7     Optic Apparatus – Dmax = 50 Gy 
    Brainstem – Dmax = 50 Gy 
  6.3.3 For patients who have not received prior radia tion therapy, the following dose limits  
    should be maintained:  
Structure  1 Fraction  3 Fractions  5 Fractions  
Optic Chiasm  8 Gy D max 12 Gy D max 14 Gy D max 
Optic Nerve  8 Gy D max 12 Gy D max 14 Gy D max 
Brainstem  14 Gy D max 22 Gy D max 27 G y D max 
Spinal Cord  8 Gy to < 0.5 cc  
10 Gy to < 0.3 cc

7.0 Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Treatment Delivery 
 
 7.1 Premedication  
  The decision to premedicate a patient prior to head and neck S BRT is at the discretion of the  
  treating radiation oncologist.  Most patients typically do not need premedication.  The  
  following are a list of agents that have been used by some investigators to potentially reduce  
  patient discomfort and possibly prevent acute and/or late toxicity if used as premedication  
  prior to SBRT.  
  7.1.1  Corticosteroids (Decadron 4 mg PO or equivalent) 15- 60 minutes prior to each  
   fraction for the intended purpose of modulating immediate inflammatory effects.   
  7.1.2  Analgesic premedication to avoid general discomfort during long treatment durations.  
  7.1.3 Anti-anxity medication for patient comfort during long treatment duration  
 
 7.2 Treatment 
  7.2.1 The medical physics staff will perform routine quality assuranc e checks on the  
   treatment machine to ensure that the mechanical isocenter stability is within  
   specification (ie. diameter < 1.5 mm).  
  7.2.2 The medical physics staff will perform patient -specific quality assurance  
   measurements to ensure that the treatment plan is deliverable and that the dose  
   distribution is accurate.  
  7.2.3 The patient will be positioned in the custom immobilization device on the Hexapod®  
   treatment couch and aligned with the in- room lasers.  
  7.2.4 Daily CT localiza tion of the GTV isocenter is required prior to each fraction.  Once  
   the patient is properly positioned, a cone -beam CT of the treatment area is acquired,  
   fused, and aligned to the treatment planning CT.  Translational and rotational  
   adjustments  of patient positioning are performed as indicated.  If adjustment are  
   required, an orthogonal (ex. AP and LATERAL) set of electronic portal images is then  
   obtained prior to treatment to confirm proper alignment of the isocenter.  
  7.2.5 Either mul tiple coplanar or noncoplanar static gantry angle intensity- modulated fields 
or rotational arcs w ill be utilized.  
  7.2.6 Only photon (x- ray) beams will be used, preferably in energies of 6 MV.  
Amendment 2: February 4,  2013 8  
  
8.0 Drug Therapy  
  8.1 The use of chemotherapy is left to t he discretion of the medical oncologist.  
 8.2 Chemotherapy agents during radiation is not allowed.  If chemotherapy is planned, it should  
  ideally not have been given within 2 weeks of starting radiation and should not resume until at  
  least 2  weeks after completing radiation.  
  
9.0 Patient Assessment

   include, but are not limited to:   
     - Radionecrosis of the temporal bone, skull base, mandible  
     - Radionecrosis of brain tissue  
     - Soft tissue necrosis  
     - CVA 
     - Cranial nerve neuropathy 
     - Ipsilateral hearing loss  
     - Vocal cord paralysis  
     - Nasal hemorrhage 
     - Localized skin fibrosis, edema, and/or ulceration 
     - Radiation -induced malignancy (ex. Fibrosarcoma)  
    
 10.2 Minimization of Risks  
  Although the risks outlined in Section 9.3 may occur, the likelihood of serious events  
  occurring is considered uncommon as long as certain precautions are taken .  The potential  
  risks have been minimized by strict compliance with normal tissue dose constraints as  
  described in Sections 6.3.  
 
 10.3 Potential Patient Benefits  
  10.3.1 Ability to offer effective a ggressive local therapy to patients with recurrent  
   unresectable head and neck cancers who have received prior wide -field radiation  
  10.3. 2 Reduction in amount of radiation delivered to adjacent normal structures  
  10.3. 3 Reduced treatment duration com pared to standard- fractionation radiation therapy 
 
 10.4 Justification of the Study  
  Patients who have locally recurrent or persistent malignant head and neck cancer after  
  definitive conventionally fractionated radiation therapy pose a therapeutic chal lenge since  
  complete surgical resection is often not feasible and surrounding critical normal tissues have  
  typically received close to maximum tolerable radiation doses.   High dose, precisely targeted  
  radiation with stereotactic body radiotherapy, which delivers minimal additional radiation dose  
  to nearby normal tissues can produce durable local control and palliation of local symptoms  
  such as pain.  In addition, some benign head and neck tumors which are located near the skull  
  base and/o r involve critical vasculature also pose a surgical challenge.  These tumors appear to  
  have a reasonably high local control probability with radiation therapy.  SBRT is  
  advantageous in this setting by limiting the dose to adjacent normal tissues in patients who  
  otherwise have a long life expectancy.  
 
 10.5 Statistical Analysis  
  10.5. 1 The overall survival and local control rates will be analyzed.  
  10.5. 2 The incidence rate for any serious adverse events will be calculated.

STUDY TI TLE:  PHASE IV TRIAL TO US E STEREOTACTIC BODY RADIOTHERAPY  (SBRT) FOR  
 HEAD AND NECK TUMORS  
 
This is a clinical trial ( type of research study).  Clinical trials include only patients who choose to take 
part.  This consent form may contain words that you do not understand.  Please ask the study doctor or the 
study staff to explain any words or informat ion that you do not clearly understand.   You may take home 
an unsigned copy of this consent form to think about or discuss with family and friends  before making 
your decision.   
 
WHAT SHOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT THE RESEARCH DOCTOR?  
 
You should know that your re lationship with a research doctor is different from your relationship with 
your personal doctor.  Your personal doctor is treating your specific problem with the hope of a benefit 
for you.  When a doctor is your research doctor, he/she is treating all subj ects under a specific protocol to 
learn about the results of a treatment, and with the understanding that you may or may not benefit from 
your participation in the study.  Be sure to ask questions of the study doctor if you want more information about this  relationship.  
 WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING PERFORMED?  
 
Some head and neck cancers recur locally even after aggressive surgery and/or several weeks of daily 
radiation therapy, with or without chemotherapy.  They often cause significant pain or other troublesom e 
local symptoms such as difficulty eating.  These are very often not resectable due to nearby critical normal tissues such as major blood vessels and nerves.  The ability to give additional radiation using 
standard methods is also very limited since there  is a maximum dose that normal tissues can tolerate 
before sustaining permanent injury.  Similarly, some benign head and neck tumors which are located near 
the skull base and/or involve major blood vessels or nerves may also not be easily removed without a  
high risk for permanent tissue injury.   
 Recent technological advancements now make it possible to deliver high doses of precisely targeted 
radiation directly to tumors, while giving very low doses of radiation to nearby normal tissues.  This 
technology is called stereotactic body radiotherapy.  A similar technology, termed stereotactic 
radiosurgery, has been used for many years to successfully treat malignant and benign tumors in the brain.  
More recently, several institutions have reported successful tr eatment of both malignant and benign 
tumors that begin in the upper aerodigestive tract and neck.  T he pur pose of this study is to collect  
additional data on the effectiveness of stereotactic body radiotherapy for unresectable skull base tumors and locally  recurrent head and neck cancer.   
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WI LL TAKE PART I N THE STUDY?  
 
Approximately 50 people are expected to participate in this clinical study.  
 
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY?  
 
Amendment 2: February 4,  2013 13 If you wish to take part in this study, a series of tests will be  performed to determine if you qualify for 
participation in the clinical study.  Your physician will ask you a series of questions regarding your 
medical history and a standard physical exam will be performed.  If you are a woman of childbearing age, 
you m ay be asked to give a urine or blood specimen so that a pregnancy test can be performed.  
 
If you qualify for the study, you will undergo a radiation treatment planning session called a simulation.  
At this visit, a custom mask and bite block device will be fabricated or a stereotactic frame will be placed 
to immobilize your head in the correct position for treatment.  Permanent small tattoos may be applied to 
your skin to aid in positioning your body on the treatment table.  
 There may be several days between the simulation and the day you begin radiation.  During this time, complex radiation treatment planning will be performed by your radiation oncologist and their medical physics staff.  You will receive between 1- 5 radiation treatments.  Your physician w ill explain your 
treatment in more detail.  Each radiation session may take an hour or longer to complete.  After the entire 
radiation course is complete, you will be given follow -up instructions.    
 
HOW LONG WI LL I  BE I N THE STUDY?  
 
We anticipate that yo u will remain in the study for approximately 5 years.  After treatment is completed 
routine follow -up visits will be conducted, typically at 3 month intervals for the first year, then less 
frequently.  
 
Your physician may decide stop your treatment if: 1) y our disease becomes worse, or 2) side effects 
become very severe, or 3) new scientific developments occur that indicate the treatment is not in your best interest, or 4) your physician believes that this treatment is no longer in your best interest.  If  your 
treatment  is stopped, your doctor will discuss further treatment options with you.  
 WHAT ARE THE RI SKS O F THE STUDY?  
 
By participating in this study, you are at risk for s everal possible expected and unexpected side effects  
associated with stereotactic radiotherapy to the Head and Neck.   Some of these are described below; 
however, there also may be other side effects that we cannot predict.   Most side effects go away shortly 
after the radiation therapy is stopped, but in some cases side effects can be s erious, long- lasting, or 
permanent.  
 
Risks arising from the delivery of stereotactic radiotherapy to the head and neck which may occur shortly 
after completing treatment may include, but are not limited to:  
  - Generalized fatigue 
  - Nausea and/or vomit ing 
  - Loss of appetite  
  - Hair loss over the treatment area 
  - Skin redness and/or tanning over the treatment area  
  - Dry and/or moist skin peeling of skin over the treatment area  
  - Dry itchy skin 
  - Thickened saliva and/or dry mouth 
  - burning se nsation with swallowing 
  - Change in taste  
  - Inflammation of the outer ear canal and/or inner ear  
  - Inflammation of the mastoid bone behind the ear  
  - Pain and ulcers in the mouth and/or throat  
  - Sore throat which could lead to weight loss  
Amendment 2: February 4,  2013 14   - Dizziness 
 
Risks arising from the delivery of stereotactic radiotherapy to the head and neck which may develop 
several months to years after completing treatment may include, but are not limited to:  
  - Radionecrosis/Injury of the temporal bone, skull base,  mandible  
  - Radionecrosis /Injury of brain tissue  
  - Soft tissue necrosis /damage  
  - Stroke  
  - Cranial nerve neuropathy/damage 
  - Hearing loss  
  - Vocal cord paralysis  
  - Nasal hemorrhage/bleeding 
  - Localized skin hardening, thickening, swelling, and/or ulceration 
  - Radiation -induced cancer (ex. Fibrosarcoma)  
  - Low thyroid gland function 
 
I understand that all these side effects are possible.  I may experience no side effects, some of them, or 
most of them.  Although I will be closely monitored, not all side effects can be predicated and unforeseen 
problems can arise.  I understand that there may be some unknown or unanticipated risks or discomforts 
in addition to those specified here.  
 
Reproductive risks :  Because even very small doses of radiati on can affect an unborn baby, you should 
not become pregnant while receiving radiation treatment.  You should also not nurse a baby while 
receiving radiation treatment.  
    
ARE THERE BENEFI TS TO TAKI NG PART I N THE STUDY?  
 If you agree to take part in this  study, t here may or may not be a direct medical benefit to you.   However, 
there have been several trials completed at other institutions that have shown high local control rates after 
stereotactic body radiotherapy for haed and neck cancer.  It is also convenient, requiring only 1- 5 
radiation sessions and no anesthesia or hospitalization.  Toxicity risk has been reported to be fairly low.  
 
WHAT OTHER OPTI ONS ARE THERE?  
 
Other treatment options  may include chemotherapy, standard -fractionation radiation ther apy, or other 
investigational procedures or medications .  Another option is no further therapy.  Your doctor can provide 
information about your disease and the benefits of the different treatments for you.  You should feel free 
to talk with your doctor about your disease and expected outcomes.  The doctor involved in your care will 
be available to answer any questions you have about this program.  You are free to ask your doctor any 
questions concerning this program now or in the future.  
 
You are free to s eek care from a doctor of your choice at any time.  If you do not take part in, or withdraw 
from, the study you will continue to receive alternate care.   
 
WHAT ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY?  
 
Efforts will be made to keep your personal information confidential.  W e cannot guarantee absolute 
confidentiality.  This Informed Consent and another document called an “Authorization to Use and 
Disclose Health Information” control how your health information may be used and disclosed during and after this study.  The result s of this study may be published or presented at meetings but will not include 
your name or reveal your identity.  To participate in this study, you must sign both the Informed Consent 
Amendment 2: February 4,  2013 15 and the Authorization to Use and Disclose Health Information.   Your per sonal information may be 
disclosed if required by law.

 CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction  
Keratoconus is a bilateral, asymmetric, non -inflammatory corneal ectasia 
characterized by progressive thinning of the corneal stroma resulting in  corneal 
bulging and distortion.iii Such pathological changes to the cornea not only cause 
decreased visual acuity, but also have been associated with reduced tear film 
qualityiii and overall ocular discomfort.iv  A recent study demonstrated that 
keratoconic  patients have a greater incidence of dry eye pathology – specifically, 
greater tear instability and corneal staining as well as decreased tear volumes.v  
There is emerging evidence demonstrating  that the predominance of dry eye is 
evaporative in naturevi—the major cause being meibomian gland dysfunction 
(MGD).vii Eye rubbing, family history of keratoconus, allergy, asthma, and 
eczema have been demonstrated to be important risk factors according to the 
most recent systematic review and meta -analysis.v 
Ocul ar allergy can alter the dry eye disease cycle including tear film 
instability, ocular surface inflammation and neurosensory abnormalities. The 
TFOS DEWS II Report has included allergic conjunctivitis among one of the 
likely risk factors for dry eye diseas e. Both allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye are 
associated with inflammation. Inflammation may be present before the clinical 
signs of dry eye, contributing to increased corneal desquamation and corneal 
surface irregularity.   
Steroids play an important rol e in in the treatment of both allergic 
conjunctivitis and dry eye diseas e. The anti -inflammatory properties of 
dexamethasone and other synthetic glucocorticoids can benefit the status of dry 
eye and allergic conjunctivitis  via modification of a wide variet y of immune 
functions.viii The immune -modifying properties of dexamethasone can improve 
dry eye  and allergy  status not only by inhibiting the inflammation that has 
already occurred as a result of the initiated immunological priming, but also by 
potentially preventing initiating immune responses from recurring . 
 
 
1.2 Rationale  
Drug delivery platforms are an innovati ve exciting advancement in 
ophthalmology. They allow patients to eliminate topical medications which are 
generally associated with lack of compliance, difficulty of use and requiring help 
from family members. These delivery systems can be applied easily in office , and 
patients do not have to worry about drop insertion in their post -operative regimen.  
The results of this research project should help to answer the following 
question: Does the use of a physician administered intracanalicular 
dexamethasone inse rt improve the signs and symptoms of ocular allergy and dry 
eye disease in KC patients compared to the use of topical loteprednol etabonate 
ophthalmic gel 0.38%?  
The HARTHAN Study (V1)  
  Page 7 
 CONFIDENTIAL  1.2.1  Rationale for Study Design  
This prospective study will use a fellow -eye design for 20 particip ants (40 
eyes) with bilateral keratoconus, wearing RGP  contact lenses in both eyes , who 
have been diagnosed with bilateral allergic conjunctivitis and underlying dry eye 
disease . Per participant, one eye will be randomized to receive the intracanalicular 
dexamethasone insert  at the baseline visit (study eye), while the other eye will be 
assigned to receive the standard of care topical lotemax etabonate ophthalmic gel 
0.38%  (control eye). Thus, for every eye in the study  group, there will be a paired 
eye with similar baseline characteristics in the control group sourced from the 
same participant. The fellow -eye design allows for greater control of pote ntial 
confounders tied to participants ’ systemic and ocular health.  
 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objective  
To determine the effect of dexamethasone  intracanalicular insert through Day 
90 as measured by:  
• Mean change in itching score from Baseline measured at all visits (V isits

• Mean change in c onjunctival injection score fro m Baseline measured at all 
visits (V isits 1 -5) 
o Graded on a scale of 0-4 as graded by the physician  
• Mean change in c orneal staining score from Baseline measured at all 
visits (V isits 1 -5) 
o Graded using the NEI Fluorescein Staining Scale as graded by the 
physician  
 
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives

3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Study Description and Duration  
This prospective, open -label, single -center, randomized, fellow -eye, investigator -
sponsored clinical study seeks to investigate  the safety and efficacy of  the 
dexamethasone insert  in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis a nd DED signs 
and symptoms in patients with Keratoconus using RGP contact lenses when 
compared to topical standard of care loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic gel 0.38% .   
After screening a given patient for inclusion and exclusion criteria, and gaining 
informed consent, one eye will be randomized to receive the dexamethasone insert  
as determined by a coin flip  at the screening visit. T he remaining eye  will be 
prescribed a loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic gel 0.38%  following  a 4,3,2,1 
weekly  taper . Per enrolled eye, the study period will last for approximately 90 
days, consisting of f ive visits . At Screening/ Baseline, Day 0 , Day 7, Day 30 and 
Day 90 , primary and secondary endpoints will be assessed alongside standard -of-
care procedures. Adjusting for enrollment period, the study will last a total of 
approximately 3 months . An abstract with preliminary results will be submitted 
by May 2020  for the AAO pt conference.

4.2.1  Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
Intracanalicular dexamethasone insert must be stored in a secure area 
accessible only to the  Investigator and their designee(s) and refrigerated and 
stored between 2o C and 80 C. Intracanalicular dexamethasone insert contains 
0.4 mg dexamethasone and is designed to provide a sustained and tapered 
release of therapeutic levels of dexamethasone to the ocular surface for up to 30 
days for the reduction of post -surgical inflammation and pain associated with 
ocular surgery. Dexamethasone is an anti -inflammatory 9 -fluoro -glucocorticoid 
(also termed a glucocorticoid agonist) and is the active ingredient found in 
MAXIDEX® 0.1% (dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension), which contains 
approximately 50 μg of dexamethasone per drop.  
Study inserts will be supplied by Ocular Therapeutix in a sealed foil pouch 
containing one intracanalicular dexamethasone insert in  a foam carrier.  
Study inserts will be shipped to the site via overnight shipping using cold packs 
to maintain a temperature of 2° to 8° C. The Investigator, or an approved 
representative (e.g. pharmacist), will ensure that all study drug inserts are 
store d in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions and in 
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. The shipping box is to be 
opened and stored immediately at the site in a refrigerator intended for 
investigational products at a temperatur e of 2° to 8°C.  
 
When the insert is removed from the refrigerator, it should be visually inspected.  
Exposure of the insert to temperatures outside these limits it not recommended. 
Records of actual storage conditions (i.e. temperature log) at the study si te must 
be maintained; and must include a record of the dates, when the refrigerator was 
checked, the initials of person checking, and the temperature.

5.2.2  Unscheduled Visits  
All attempts should be made to keep patients  on the study schedule.  Unscheduled 
visits may be necessary to repeat testing following abnormal laborato ry results, 
for follow -up of AEs, or for any other reason, as warranted.  
 
5.2.3  Adverse Event Information Collection  
The investigator (or designee) will record all AEs that occur during the study  
The definition of an AE and SAE, and information on the determination of severity 
and relationship to treatment are provided in Section 6.  
5.3 Rescue Criteria  
Patients can be resc ued at any time at the discretion of the investigator  with 
loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic gel 0.38% . Rescue criteria includes:  
• A score greater than or equal to 2+ in one or more of the following 
categories:  
o Itching  
o Papillae  
o Injection  
o Staining  
6. SAFETY DEFINITIONS , REPORTING , AND MONITORING  
6.1 Definitions  
6.1.1  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  administered a study 
drug which may or may not have a causal relationship with the study drug.  
Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and un intended sign (including abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is temporally associated with the 
use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug.   
 
An AE also includes any worsening (i.e. any clinically significa nt change in 
frequency and/or intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally 
associated with the use of the study drug.  
 
6.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
The HARTHAN Study (V1)  
  Page 15 
 CONFIDENTIAL  • Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be 
completely unrelated to study drug (e.g. a car accident in which a patient  is a 
passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient  is at 
immediate risk of death at the time of the event.  This does not include an AE 
that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization.  In -patient hospital ization is defined as admission to a 
hospital or an emergency room for longer than 24 hours.  Prolongation of 
existing hospitalization is defined as a hospital stay that is longer than was 
originally anticipated for the event, or is prolonged due to the de velopment of 
a new AE as determined by the investigator or treating physician.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial 
disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an  important medical event – Important medical events may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may 
jeopardize the patient  or may require intervention to prevent 1 of the other 
serious outcomes listed above (e.g., int ensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse).  Any malignancy (other than basal cell skin cancers) would be 
considered a medically important event.  
 
6.2 Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs will be recorded only if they are medically relevant.

7.2 Informed Consent  
The principles of informed consent are described in ICH Guidelines for GCP.  
 
Ocular Therapeutix will have the right to review a nd comment on the informed 
consent form.  
 
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by local 
regulations) to obtain written informed consent from each patient  prior to 
his/her participation in the study and after the aims, met hods, objectives, and 
potential hazards of the study have been explained to the patient  in language 
that he/she can understand.  The ICF will be signed and dated by the patient  
and by the investigator or authorized designee who reviewed the ICF with the 
patient .   
 
Patients  who can write but cannot read will have the ICF read to them before 
signing and dating the ICF.  
Patients  who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have the 
ICF read to them in presence of an impartial witness, who will s ign and date the 
ICF to confirm that informed consent was given.  
 
The original ICF will be retained by the investigator as part of the patient ’s 
study record, and a copy of the signed ICF will be given to the patient . 
 
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit 
assessment, the ICF will be reviewed and updated appropriately.  All study 
patient s will be informed of the new information and provide their written 
consent if they wish to continue in the study.  The original signe d revised ICF 
will be maintained in the patient ’s study record and a copy will be given to the 
patient . 
 
7.3 Patient  Confidentiality and Data Protection  
The investigator will take all appropriate measures to ensure that the 
anonymity of each study patient  will be maintained.   
 
The patient ’s and investigator’s personal data will be treated in compliance with 
all applicable laws and regulations.   
 
7.4 Institut ional Review Board  
An appropriately constituted IRB, as described in ICH Guidelines for GCP, will 
review and approve:  
• The protocol, ICF, and any other materials to be provided to the patient s 
(e.g. advertising) before any patient  may be enrolled in the s tudy  
The HARTHAN Study (V1)  
  Page 17 
 CONFIDENTIAL  • Any amendment or modification to the study protocol or ICF before 
implementation, unless the change is necessary to eliminate an immediate 
hazard to the patient s, in which case the IRB will be informed as soon as 
possible  
 
Ongoing studies will be re viewed by the IRB/EC on an annual basis or at 
intervals appropriate to the degree of risk.  
 
In addition, the IRB will be informed of any event likely to affect the safety of 
patient s or the continued conduct of the clinical study.  
 
A copy of the IRB appro val letter will be sent to Ocular Therapeutix prior to 
shipment of drug insert supplies to the investigator.  The approval letter will 
include the study title, the documents reviewed, and the date of the review.  
 
Records of the IRB review and approval of a ll study documents (including 
approval of ongoing studies) will be kept on file by the investigator.

APPENDICES  
 
I. Itching Score  
The physician will ask the patient to grade their current level of itching on a 0 to 
4-point scale. The Investigator will record patient graded level of itching on the 
appropriate Case Report Form.  
 
0 = None  
1 = Mild  
2 = Moderate  
3 = Sever e 
4 = Extremely Severe  
 
II. Palpebral Conjunctivitis Papillae Score  
The investigator will grade the level of papillae with the Papillae Efron scale.  
 
 
 
III. Conjunctival Injection Score   
The investigator will grade the level of ocular injection on a 0 to 4-point scale . 
 
0 = None  
1 = Mild – Slightly dilated blood vessels; color of vessels is typically pink; can be 
quadrantal

 CONFIDENTIAL  2 = Moderate – More apparent dilation of blood vessels; vessel color is more intense 
(redder); involves the majority of the vessel b ed  
3 = Severe – Numerous and obvious dilated blood vessels; in the absence of chemosis the 
color is deep red, may be less red or pink in presence of chemosis, is not quadrantic  
4 = Extremely Severe – Large, numerous, dilated blood vessels characterized by 
unusually sev ere deep red color, regardless of grade of chemosis, which involves the 
entire vessel bed

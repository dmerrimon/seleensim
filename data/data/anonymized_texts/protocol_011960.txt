Protocol No. VONO-101  Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  
 Page 7  1. INTRODUCTION 
V onoprazan fumarate (TAK-438) belongs to a nove l class of acid suppressants known as PCABs 
that suppress gastric acid secretion by competitively inhibiting gastric H+, K+-ATPase. 
V onoprazan was discovered and developed by Ta keda Pharmaceutical Company, Japan and is 
being developed by Phathom Pharmaceuticals in  the United States, Europe, and Canada for 
healing of all grades of EE and relief of heartburn, maintenance of healing of all grades of EE 
and relief of heartburn, and treatment of  Helicobacter pylori infection. V onoprazan has been 
studied in a number of other acid-related diseases including gastric ulcer/duodenal ulcer healing 
and for the prevention of recurrence of a ga stric or duodenal ulcer during nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin administration. V onoprazan has received regulatory approval 
in Japan and other countries in Asia a nd Latin America for these indications.  
1.1 BACKGROUND 
Gastric H+, K+-ATPase, also known as the proton pump, is responsible for acid secretion from 
parietal cells in the stomach. It is inactive in the cytosol but relocates from the cytosol to the secretory membrane of the parietal cells when food is present in the stomach, thereby becoming 
active and pumping H
+ ions out of the cells and into the canaliculi in exchange for K+ ions. It 
represents an attractive pharmacological target be cause it is the final step of the acid secretion 
process. Two classes of pharmaceuticals, with distinct mechanisms of action for inhibiting the 
gastric proton pump, have been developed for clinical application: PPIs and PCABs. As a PCAB, 
vonoprazan has a unique mechanism of action and PK relative to PPIs, as follows:  
x Acid activation and stability: Conventional PP Is are prodrugs that are activated by acid and 
covalently bind H+, K+-ATPase; however, activated PPIs are not stable in acidic conditions. 
In contrast, vonoprazan does not require acid ac tivation, is stable in acidic conditions, and 
does not require enteric-coated formulations; thus they have a more durable effect. Furthermore, vonoprazan is rapidly protonate d in the parietal cell canaliculi, which 
concentrates the drug proximal to H
+, K+-ATPase. 
x Activity against active and inactive proton pumps: Vonoprazan inhibits acid secretion by 
competitively inhibiting the binding of potassium ions to H+, K+-ATPase. Vonoprazan can 
bind to the pump while it is active or inac tive; in contrast, PPIs covalently bind 
H+, K+-ATPase only when the pump is active, as an acidic environment is required for the 
activation and accumulation of PPIs in the parietal cell. Pumps are constantly switching between the active and inactive states throughout the day; therefore, multiple doses of PPIs 

 Page 8  are required to control acid compared with a single dose of vonoprazan. Vonoprazan can also 
be dosed in the presence or absence of food, whereas most PPIs require dosing before a meal 
as eating stimulates activation of the pumps. 
x Extended half-life: The plasma half-life of vonoprazan (20 mg) is 6.9 hours after the first dose and 8.6 hours after the seventh day of once daily dosing in humans ( Jenkins et al 2015). 
This is significantly longer than the half-life of conventional PPIs (<2 hours; Shin and Kim 
2013). 
x Metabolism: Vonoprazan is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4, which lacks a high 
degree of genetic polymorphism compared with CYP2C19, the primary enzyme responsible 
for the metabolism of PPIs. 
These unique aspects of vonoprazan’s mechanism relative to that of PPIs translate into greater magnitude and duration of gastric acid suppressio n, which are reflected in the pharmacodynamic 
profile.  
In clinical studies, plasma concentrations of TAK-438F (vonoprazan free base) reached a peak by 
approximately 1.0 hour (median)  after administration and gradually declined thereafter,  with a 
mean apparent t
1/2 of 8.9 hours.  The exposure and C max for TAK-438F increased with increasing 
doses of vonoprazan in a slightly  greater than dose-proportional manner.  After repeat dosing of 
vonoprazan, steady state was achieved by Day 4 and exhibited time  independent PK. No  
clinically relevant effect s of food or sex were observed on the PK of vonoprazan.  V onoprazan is 
metabolized mainly by hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4 and partially by CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6.  
Overall, vonoprazan has been  well tolerated in healthy volunteer s in Phase  1 studies, as well as 
in completed Phase  2 and 3 studies of Japanese, Asian, and Western subjects with acid-related  
diseases. 
Further information on vonoprazan can be found in the investigator’s brochure (Global 
Investigator’s Brochure 10th Edition).

Protocol No. VONO-101  Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  
 Page 9  European Medicines Agency (EMA 2012 ) drug interaction guidances support the fact that 
reversible inhibition is not expected in the liver but indicate the reversible inhibition of intestinal 
CYP3A4 and time-dependent inhibition of  hepatic CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6. 
V onoprazan had a lower inhibition potential than positive controls. The in  vitro data for the 
positive controls translated into a low drug interaction potential in the clinic; the clinical 
relevance of these findings for vonoprazan is expected to be lower. Furthermore, no 
autoinhibition was observed for vonoprazan metabolism with repeat dosing and no clinically relevant drug interaction has been observed in clinical studies (Nishihara et al 2019). Therefore, the CYP inhibition potential of vonoprazan is consider ed to be low and it is unlikely to cause any 
significant clinical DDI.  
Midazolam is an ultra–short-acting benzodiazepin e used clinically for brief sedation and is 
commonly used as a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate in clinical drug interaction studies. After oral administration, midazolam is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The 
mean t
1/2 of midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam, its major metabolite (mediated by CYP3A4), 
is approximately 3  hours in humans. The C max is reached at about 1 hour after oral 
administration. Midazolam is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the 
drug or allergies to cherries or formulation excipients. Potential AEs are summarized in the 
midazolam prescribing information (Midazolam hydrochloride 2012).  
This study is designed  in accordance with the  US FDA Guidance for Industry, Clinical Drug 
Interaction Studies - Cytochrome P450 Enzyme- and Transporter-Mediated Drug Interactions 
(DHHS 2020) to assess the effects of vonoprazan  on the PK, safety, and tolerability of 
midazolam.  
This study will improve understanding of the interaction and resulting changes in exposure (if 
any) when a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate (midazolam) is given in combination with vonoprazan.  
1.3 RATIONALE FOR DOSE SELECTION 
The vonoprazan 20 mg BID dose was selected because this is the highest dose being evaluated in 
clinical studies and approved for use, thus maximizing the possibility of identifying a DDI, in 
line with regulatory guidance.  
A single dose of 2 mg of midazolam was chosen b ecause this is one of the most common dosing 
strategies for CYP3A drug interaction studies a nd is expected to provide adequate plasma 
concentrations to assess a drug interaction. Furthe rmore, this dose is anticipated to reduce the 

2. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
2.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE 
The primary objective of this study is to dete rmine the time-dependent inhibition potential of 
repeated doses of oral vonoprazan on the PK of a single oral dose of midazolam, a sensitive 
CYP3A4 substrate, in healthy subjects.  
2.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVE S 
The secondary objectives are as follows:  
x To assess the safety and tolerability of a si ngle oral dose of midazolam alone or when 
coadministered with multiple oral doses of vonoprazan in healthy subjects  
x To evaluate the plasma PK of the metabolite 1-hydroxymidazolam in the presence of 
vonoprazan in healthy subjects  
3. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a Phase 1, open-label, fixed-sequence, clinical drug interaction study designed to assess 
the effect of vonoprazan on the PK of midazolam in healthy subjects. 
The study will consist of a screening period, check-in, a treatment period, an EOS visit, and a 
follow-up telephone call. The treatment period will include administration of single oral doses of 
2 mg of midazolam syrup on Day 1 and Day 9 and BID doses of 20 mg vonoprazan oral tablets on Days  2 through 10.  
Subjects will fast overnight (nothing to eat or drink except water) for at least 8  hours before the 
morning dose administration. On Day 9, midazo lam will be administered 1 hour after the 
vonoprazan morning dose administration. Sub jects will continue fasting for 4  hours after dosing 
on Days  1 and 9. On vonoprazan-only days, food will be allowed 1 hour after the vonoprazan 
dose has been administered. Evening vonopr azan dosing should occur more than 1  hour before 
or after a meal.  
Pharmacokinetic and safety endpoints will be evaluated in the study.  

7. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLANS 
7.1 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATIONS 
The sample size for this study is based on consideration of the precision of the estimate of 
GMRs of PK parameters of midazolam with and without vonoprazan. To evaluate the effect 
of vonoprazan on the PK of midazolam, with 16 evaluable subjects, there is an 80% 
probability that the 90% CI will be within  81.4% and 122.9% of the point estimate of the 
GMR of midazolam PK parameters with and without vonoprazan. This calculation assumes that midazolam PK parameters are log-normally distributed with an intrasubject CV no 
greater than 30% (Mueller et al 2017).  
Approximately 20 healthy male and female subjects will be enrolled at a single center in the 
United States to achieve at  least 16 evaluable subjects.  
7.2 ANALYSIS SETS 
The analysis populations are as follows:  
x The PK population will include subjects w ho receive at least 1 dose of study drug and 
have sufficient concentration data to support accurate estimation of at least 1 PK 
parameter.  Subjects who experience vomiting within 2 times the median T max after 
midazolam dosing will be excluded from the PK analysis. 

7.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
Details of all statistical analyses will be descri bed in a separate statistical analysis plan. All 
data collected will be presented in data listings.  Data from subjects excluded from an analysis 
population will be presented in the data listings but not included in the calculation of 
summary statistics.  
For categorical variables, fr equencies and percentages will be presented. Continuous 
variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, median, 
SD, minimum, and maximum).  
Baseline demographic and background variables w ill be summarized overall for all subjects. 
The number of subjects who enroll in the study and the number and percentage of subjects 
who complete the study will be presented. The frequency and percentage of subjects who withdraw or discontinue from the study and th e reason for withdrawal or discontinuation will 
also be summarized.  
7.3.1 Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
Individual plasma concentration and time deviation data will be presented in a data listing. 
Plasma concentration data will be summariz ed by time point for each treatment (midazolam 
alone , vonoprazan alone, midazolam + vonoprazan) using the fo llowing descriptive statistics: 
number of subjects, arithmetic mean, SD, CV , geometric mean, geometric CV , median, 
minimum, and maximum. Individual and mean plasma concentration versus scheduled time 
profiles will be presented in figures on both linear and semilogarithmic scales.  
The PK parameters of midazolam and 1-hydroxym idazoam will be analyzed based on the 
actual sampling times. All parameters will be calculated using the latest versions of Phoenix® 
WinNonlin® (Certara USA Inc., Princeton, New Jersey) or SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, 
North Carolina). The individual PK parameters will be presented in data listings and 
summarized by treatment using the followin g descriptive statistics: number of subjects, 
mean, SD, CV , median, minimum, and maximum. Geometric means will be included for AUC
0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max. 
A linear mixed model with treatment as a fixed ef fect and subject as a random effect will be 
performed on the natural log-transformed values of AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max to assess the 
effect of vonoprazan on the PK of midazolam. A 90% CI for the ratio (midazolam + 

limits of the mean difference. No adjustment will be made for multiplicity.  
Non-parametric methods will be used to examine median differences in T max for midazolam 
and 1-hydroxymidazolam . 
7.3.2 Safety Analyses 
Adverse events will be coded by preferred term and system organ class using the latest 
version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. All AE data will be presented in a data listing. Treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized by treatment and overall, as well 
as by severity and relationship to study drug. Serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation 
of study drug will also be presented in the data listings and summarized by treatment and 
overall.  
Actual values and changes from baseline for clinical laboratory test results, vital sign 
measurements, and 12-lead ECG results will be summarized at each time point using 
descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum). 
Shift tables will be generated for clinical laboratory test results. Physical examination 
findings will be presented in a data listing.  
7.4 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA 
Plasma concentrations that are BLQ will be treated as zero for descriptive statistics. Mean BLQ concentrations will be presented as BLQ, and the SD and CV will be reported as not applicable. Missing concentrations wi ll be excluded from the calculations.  
For the PK analysis, BLQ values will be treated as zero with the exception that a BLQ value between 2 quantifiable concentrations will be se t as missing. Missing concentrations will be 
treated as missing from the PK parameter calculations. If consecutive BLQ concentrations 
are followed by quantifiable concentrations in the terminal phase, those concentrations after 
BLQ concentrations will be treated as missing.  
7.5 INTERIM ANALYSES 
No formal interim analyses will be performed in this study.  

Subjects can withdraw consent and discontinue from the study at any time, for any reason, 
without prejudice to further treatment.  
The investigator may withdraw a subject from the study if the subject meets any of the 
following criteria:  
1. Is non-compliant with the protocol.  
2. Experiences an SAE or intolerable PTE/AE(s) that, in the investigator’s opinion, requires withdrawal from the study.  
3. Has laboratory safety assessments that reveal clinically significant hematological or biochemical changes from baseline values (if a subject’s ALT or AST or total bilirubin is 
>3 × ULN at any time during study medication treatment, the study medication should be 
discontinued immediately with appropriate clinical follow-up, including repeat laboratory tests, until the subject’s laboratory profile has returned to normal/baseline status).  
4. Develops symptoms or conditions that are listed in the exclusion criteria during the 
course of the study.  
5. Requires a medication prohibited by the protocol.  
6. Requests early discontinuation for any reason.  
7. Becomes pregnant.  
The investigator can also withdraw a subject upon the request of the sponsor, or if the 
sponsor terminates the study. If withdrawal is considered because of an SAE or intolerable 
PTE/AE, the investigator will confer with the sponsor. If a subject is discontinued because of 
a PTE/AE, the event will be followed until it is resolved, stable, or judged by the investigator 
to be not clinically significant.  

 Page 28  9.2.1.2  Handling of Withdrawals 
When a subject withdraws from the study, the reason(s) for withdrawal shall be recorded by 
the investigator on the relevant page of the eCRF. Whenever possible, any subject who prematurely withdraws from the study will undergo all EOS assessments. Any subject who fails to return for final assessments will be contacted by the site in a reasonable attempt to 
have them comply with the protocol. The status of subjects who fail to complete final 
assessments will be documented in the eCRF.  
9.2.2 Prior and Concomitant Medications and Therapies 
Restrictions for prior and concomitant medications and therapies are provided in Section  4.2. 
Prior and concomitant medications and therapies will be coded using the latest version of the 
World Health Organization Drug Dictionary.  
9.2.2.1  Prior Medications 
Information regarding prior medications taken by the subject within the 30  days before 
signing the ICF will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF.  
9.2.2.2  Concomitant Medications 
Any concomitant medication deemed necessary for the welfare of the subject during the 
study may be administered at the discretion of the investigator. If a concomitant medication 
is taken, except for those specified in the prot ocol, a joint decision will be made by the 
investigator and the sponsor to continue or discontinue the subject based on the time the 
medication was administered, its pharmacol ogy and PK, and whether the use of the 
medication will compromise the safety of the subject or the interpretation of the data. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that details regarding the medication are adequately recorded in the eCRF.  
9.2.3 Treatment Compliance 
All doses of study drug will be administered in the clinical unit under direct observation of 
clinic personnel and will be recorded in the eCRF. Clinic personnel will confirm that the subject has received the entire dose of study drug.  
The date and time of study drug dosing will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF. 
If a subject is not administered study drug, the reason for the missed dose will be recorded.  

 Page 29  9.3 APPENDIX 3: ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS AND 
REPORTING 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF 
and reported to the sponsor, regardless of their relationship to study drug or clinical 
significance. If there is any doubt as to whet her a clinical observation is an AE, the event 
should be reported.  
9.3.1 Adverse Event Definitions 
A PTE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that has occurred prior to 
administration of any study drug in a clinical i nvestigation subject who has signed informed 
consent to participate in a study; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship 
with study participation.  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject enrolled in this study regardless of its causal relationship to study dru g. An AE can therefore be an unfavorable 
sign or symptom or a disease temporally associated with the use of study drug.  
A treatment-emergent AE is defined as any event that occurs after the first dose of study drug 
or any event at baseline that worsens in eith er intensity or frequency after the first dose of 
study drug.  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that meets one of the 
following criteria:  
1. Results in death.  
2. Is life-threatening. The term “life-threatening”  refers to an event in which the subject was 
at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6. Is an important medical event that satisfies any of the following:

 Page 31  further investigation in order to characterize and understand them and would be described in 
protocols and instructions provided for investigators as to how and when they should be 
reported to Phathom Pharmaceuticals. There ar e no special interest AEs for this study.  
Reporting of Abnormal Liver Function Tests:  
If a subject is noted to have an ALT or AST value >3 × ULN and a total bilirubin value 
>2 × ULN during the treatment or follow-up period for which an alternative etiology has not 
been identified, the event should be reported as an SAE. The investigator must contact the 
medical monitor for discussion of the relevan t subject details and possible alternative 
etiologies, such as acute viral hepatitis A or B,  other acute liver disease, medical history, or 
concurrent medical conditions. Study drug s hould be discontinued immediately as per 
Section  9.2.1.1. Laboratory tests should be followed-up as described in Section 6.2.2. In 
addition, a Liver Function Test Increase eCRF must be completed and transmitted with the SAE form.  
If subjects with normal baseline ALT or AST levels experience ALT or AST >3 × ULN and a 2-fold increase above baseli ne, follow-up laboratory tests (at a minimum, serum alkaline 
phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and INR) should be repeated within a maximum of 7 days and preferably within 48 to 72 hours after the 
abnormality was found.  
If subjects with elevated baseline ALT or AST levels experience ALT or AST >5 × ULN, 
follow-up laboratory tests (at a minimum, serum alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total 
bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and INR) should be repeated within a maximum of 
7 days and preferably within 48 to 72 hours after the abnormality is found.  
If subjects with either normal or elevated baseline ALT or AST levels experience ALT or AST >8 × ULN, follow-up laboratory tests (at a minim um, serum alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, 
total bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transferase, and INR) should be repeated within a maximum of 
48 hours after the abnormality is found.  
9.3.2 Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events 
Collection of PTEs will commence at the time the subject signs the informed consent to 
participate in the study and will continue until the subject is first administered study drug or 
until screen failure. For subjects who discont inue prior to study drug administration, PTEs 
are collected until the subject discontinues study participation. Collection of AEs will 

 Page 32  commence from the time that the subject is first administered study drug (Day 1). Routine 
collection will continue until the follo w-up visit or withdrawal from the study.  
On each study day, the investigator will assess whether any subjective AEs have occurred. A 
neutral question, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” may be asked. 
Subjects may report AEs occurring at any other time during the study. Subjects experiencing a serious PTE must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant 
changes in laboratory values have returned to baseline or there is a satisfactory explanation for the change. Nonserious PTEs, related or unrelated to the study procedure, need not to be followed up for the purposes of the protocol. All subjects experiencing AEs, whether 
considered associated with the use of the study drug or not, must be monitored until the 
symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in laboratory values have returned to baseline or until there is a satisfacto ry explanation for the changes observed.  
In addition to subject observations, AEs will be documented from any data collected on the 
AE page of the eCRF (eg, laboratory values, physical examination findings, and ECG changes) or other documents that are relevant to subject safety.  
9.3.3 Reporting Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events 
All PTEs and AEs will be documented on the PTE/AE page of the eCRF, regardless of 
whether the investigator concludes that the event is related to drug treatment. Information to 
be collected includes event term, start and st op date, seriousness, severity, investigator’s 
opinion of the causal relationship between th e event and administration of study drug(s) 
(related or not related; not applicable for PTEs),  action concerning study drug (not applicable 
for PTEs), any required treatment or evaluations, and the outcome of the event.  
Any AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will 
be followed until they are resolved, stable, or judged by the investigator to be not clinically significant. Any medical condition that is present  at the time that the subject is screened but 
does not deteriorate should not be reported as an AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it should be recorded as an AE. Section 9.3.4 provides additional details. 
The Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities will be used to code all AEs.  
Any AE that is considered serious by the investigator or that meets SAE criteria 
(Section  9.3.1) must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours (after the investigator has 
confirmed the occurrence of the SAE). The investigator will assess whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that the study drug(s) caused the SAE. The sponsor will be responsible 

 Page 33  for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of any SAE as outlined in US Title 21 CFR 
Parts 312 and 320. The investigator is responsible for notifying the IRB directly. Contact 
information to be used for SAE reporting can be found in Section 6.2.1.  
Any SAE spontaneously reported to the investigator following the AE collection period should be reported to the sponsor if it is considered related to study participation.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively se ek information regarding new AEs or SAEs after 
the conclusion of study participation. However,  if the investigator learns of any SAE, 
including a death, at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study and he/she 
considers the event to be reasonably related to the study drug or study participation, the 
investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. Reporting of serious PTEs will follow the 
same procedure as SAE reporting.  
9.3.4 Additional Points to Consider for Pre-Treatment Events and 
Adverse Events 
An untoward finding generally may involve the following:  
x Indicates a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre-existing condition 
(pre-existing conditions or underlying disease should not be considered PTEs or AEs) 
x Necessitates therapeutic intervention 
x Requires an invasive diagnostic procedure 
x Requires discontinuation or a change in dose of study drug or a concomitant medication 
x Is considered unfavorable by the investigator for any reason 
PTEs/AEs caused by a study procedure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) should be recorded as a PTE/AE.  
Diagnoses versus signs and symptoms:  
x Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs (including abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as additional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, signs or symptoms should be recorded appropriately as PTEs or as AEs. 

Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  V onoprazan  
Protocol No. VONO-101  Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  
 Page 34  Laboratory values and ECG findings:  
x Changes in laboratory values or ECG findings are only considered to be PTEs or AEs if 
they are judged to be clinically significant (ie, if some action or intervention is required or if the investigator judges the change to be beyond the range of normal physiologic fluctuation). A laboratory or ECG retest or conti nued monitoring of an abnormal value or 
finding is not considered an intervention. In addition, repeated or additional noninvasive 
testing for verification, evaluation, or monitoring of an abnormality is not considered an 
intervention. 
x If abnormal laboratory values or ECG finding s are the result of pathology for which there 
is an overall diagnosis (eg, increased creatinine in renal failure), only the diagnosis 
should be reported as a PTE or an AE. 
Pre-existing conditions:  
x Pre-existing conditions (present at the time of signing of informed consent) are 
considered concurrent medical conditions and should NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. 
Baseline evaluations (eg, laboratory tests, EC Gs, etc) should NOT be recorded as PTEs 
unless related to study procedures. However, if  the subject experiences a worsening or 
complication of such a concurrent medical  condition, the worsening or complication 
should be recorded appropriately as a PTE (if the worsening or complication occurs before administration of study drug) or an AE  (if the worsening or complication occurs 
after administration of study drug). Investig ators should ensure that the recorded event 
term captures the change in the condition (eg, “worsening of…”).  
x If a subject has a pre-existing episodic concurrent medical condition (eg, asthma, epilepsy), any occurrence of an episode s hould be captured as a PTE/AE only if the 
condition becomes more frequent, serious, or severe in nature. Investigators should ensure that the recorded AE term captures the change in the condition from baseline (eg, 
“worsening of…”).  
x If a subject has a degenerative concurrent  medical condition (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid 
arthritis), worsening of the condition should only be recorded as a PTE/AE if it occurs to 
a greater extent than would be expected. Investigators should ensure that the recorded AE 
term captures the change in the condition (eg, “worsening of…”).  

 Page 35  Worsening of PTEs or AEs:  
x If the subject experiences a worsening or comp lication of a PTE after the start of study 
drug, the worsening or complication should be recorded as an AE. Investigators should 
ensure that the recorded AE term captures the change in the PTE (eg, “worsening of…”).  
x If the subject experiences a worsening or co mplication of an AE after any change in 
study drug, the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators should ensure that the recorded AE term captures the change in the condition 
(eg, “worsening of…”).  
Changes in intensity of AEs /serious PTEs:  
x If the subject experiences changes in the intensity of an AE/serious PTE, the event should 
be captured once with the maximum intensity recorded. 
Preplanned procedures (surgeries or interventions): 
x Preplanned procedures (surgeries or therapies) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
informed consent are not considered PTEs or  AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is 
performed early (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre-existing condition, 
the worsening of the condition should be r ecorded as a PTE or an AE. Complications 
resulting from any planned surgery should be reported as AEs. 
Elective surgeries or procedures:  
x Elective procedures performed when there is no change in the subj ect’s medical condition 
should not be recorded as PTEs or AEs, but  should be documented in the subject’s source 
documents. Complications resulting from an elective surgery should be reported as AEs. 
Insufficient clinical response (lack of efficacy):  
x Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or  pharmacologic action should NOT be recorded 
as an AE. The investigator must make the distinction between exacerbation of 
pre-existing illness and lack of therapeutic efficacy. 
Overdose:  
x Cases of overdose with any medication without manifested side effects are NOT considered PTEs or AEs, but instead will be documented on the Overdose page of the 

 Page 36  eCRF. Any manifested side effects will be considered PTEs or AEs and will be recorded 
on the AE page of the eCRF. 
9.3.5 Assessment of Severity 
The severity (or intensity) of an AE refers to the extent to which it affects the subject’s daily 
activities and will be classified as mild, m oderate, or severe using the following criteria:  
x Mild: The event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject. 
x Moderate: The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual 
activities. 
x Severe: The event causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities . 
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow the duration of the event at each level of intensity to be assessed. An AE characterized as intermittent does not require 
documentation of the onset and duration of each episode.  
9.3.6 Assessment of Causality 
The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study drug is part of the documentation process but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the 
study. If there is any doubt as to whether a cl inical observation is an AE, the event should be 
reported.  
The investigator will assess causality (ie, wh ether there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study drug caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs. The relationship will be classified as 
follows:  
x Not related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/or can reasonably be explained by other factors, such as 
underlying diseases, complications, concom itant drugs, and concurrent treatments. 
x Related: An AE that follows a reasonable te mporal sequence from administration of 
study drug (including the course after withdrawal of the drug) or for which possible 
involvement of the drug cannot be ruled out, although factors other than the study drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, concomitant drugs, and concurrent 
treatments, may also be responsible. 

 Page 37  9.3.6.1  Relationship to Study Procedures 
Relationship (causality) to study procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs.  
The relationship should be assessed as related if the investigator considers that there is 
reasonable possibility that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed as not related.  
9.3.6.2  Start Date 
The start date of the AE/PTE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by the 
subject or investigator.  
9.3.6.3  Stop Date 
The stop date of the AE/PTE is the date at which  the subject recovered, the event resolved 
with sequelae, or the subject died.  
9.3.6.4  Frequency 
Episodic AEs/PTE (eg, vomiting) or those that occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive 
days are intermittent. All other events are continuous.  
9.3.6.5  Action Concerning Study Drug 
x Drug withdrawn: a study drug is stopped due to the particular AE. 
x Dose not changed: the particular AE  did not require stopping study drug. 
x Unknown: only to be used if it cannot be determined what action was taken. 
x Not applicable: study drug was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE; eg, the study was terminated, the subject died, or dosing with study drug was already stopped 
before the onset of the AE. 
x Dose reduced: the dose was reduced due to the particular AE. 
x Dose increased: the dose was incr eased due to the particular AE. 
x Drug interrupted: the dose was interr upted due to the particular AE. 

 Page 38  9.3.6.6  Outcome 
x Recovered/resolved: the subject returned to fi rst assessment status with respect to the 
AE/PTE. 
x Recovering/resolving: the intensity is decr eased by 1 or more stages, the diagnosis or 
signs/symptoms have almost disappeared, the abnormal laboratory value improved but 
has not returned to the normal range or to ba seline, the subject died from a cause other 
than the particular AE/PTE with the condition remaining “recovering/resolving”.  
x Not recovered/not resolved: there is no change in the diagnosis, signs, or symptoms; the 
intensity of the diagnosis, signs/symptoms, or laboratory value on the last day of the 
observed study period is worse than when it started; the condition is an irreversible congenital anomaly; the subject died from another cause while the particular AE/PTE 
state was “not recovered/not resolved”.  
x Resolved with sequelae: the subject recovered from an acute AE/PTE but was left with 
permanent/significant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with some persisting paresis). 
x Fatal: AEs/PTEs that are considered the cause of death. 
x Unknown: the course of the AE/PTE cannot be followed up due to hospital change or residence change at the end of the subject’s participation in the study.  
9.3.7 Follow-up of Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs must be reported in detail on the a ppropriate page of the eCRF and followed until 
they are resolved, stable, or judged by the investigator to be not clinically significant.  
For SAEs, if information not available at the time of the first report becomes available at a later date, the investigator should update the SAE eCRF form and transmit it immediately 
within 24 hours of receipt. Copies of any relevant data from the hospital notes (eg, ECG 
results, laboratory test results, discharge summary, postmortem results) should be provided, if 
requested.  
All SAEs should be followed up until resolu tion or permanent outcome of the event. The 
timelines and procedure for follow-up reports are the same as those for the initial report.  

 Page 39  9.3.8 Pregnancy  
During the course of the study, human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy tests will be 
performed for women, and subjects will receive  continued guidance with respect to the 
avoidance of pregnancy as part of the study procedures (Section 3.1).  
If any subject is found to be pregnant during the study, she should be withdrawn and any 
study drug should be immediately discontinued. If the pregnancy occurs during 
administration of active study drug or within 4 weeks of the last dose of active study drug, the pregnancy should be reported immediately, using a pregnancy notification form, to the contact listed in Section 6.2.1. If the female subject agrees that the primary care physician 
can be informed, the investigator should notify the primary care physician that the subject 
was participating in a clinical study at the ti me she became pregnant and provide details of 
the treatment the subject received. All pregnancies in subjects receiving study drug will be followed up to final outcome, using the pregnancy form. The outcome, including any 
premature termination, must be reported to the sponsor. An evaluation after the birth of the 
child will also be conducted.  
9.3.9 Safety Reporting to Investi gators, Institutional Review 
Boards, Independent Ethics Committees, and Regulatory 
Authorities 
The sponsor is responsible for reporting all SUSARs and any other applicable SAEs to 
regulatory authorities, investigators and IRBs or IECs, as applicable, in accordance with 
national regulations in the countries where the study is conducted. The SUSARs will be 
submitted to the regulatory authorities as an expedited report within 7 days for fatal and life-threatening events and 15 days for other serious events, relative to the first awareness of the event by/or further provision to the sponsor or sponsor’s designee, unless otherwise 
required by national regulations. The sponsor also  will prepare an expedited report for other 
safety issues that might materially alter the current benefit-risk assessment of a study 
drug/sponsor-supplied drug or that would be sufficient to consider changes in the study 
drug/sponsor-supplied drug administration or in the overall conduct of the trial. The study 
site also will forward a copy of all expedited reports to their IRB or IEC in accordance with 
local regulations.  

 Page 40  9.4 APPENDIX 4: STUDY GOVERNANCE 
9.4.1 Data Quality Assurance 
This study will be conducted using the qualit y processes described in applicable procedural 
documents. The quality management approach to  be implemented will be documented and 
will comply with current ICH guidance on quality and risk management. All aspects of the 
study will be monitored for compliance with applicable government regulatory requirements, current GCP, the protocol, and standard operating procedures. The monitor will maintain current personal knowledge of the study through observation, review of study records and 
source documentation, and discussion of the conduct of the study with the investigator and 
staff. Electronic CRFs and electronic data capture will be utilized. The electronic data capture 
system is validated and compliant with US Tit le 21 CFR Part 11. Each person involved with 
the study will have an individual identif ication code and password that allows for record 
traceability.  
Important protocol deviations, should they occur during the study, will be presented in Section 10.2 of the clinical study report.  
9.4.2 Investigator Obligations 
The following administrative items are meant to guide the investigator in the conduct of the study and may be subject to change based on industry and government standard operating procedures, working practice documents, or guidelines. Changes will be reported to the IRB 
but will not result in protocol amendments.  
9.4.2.1  Confidentiality 
All laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports, and other records will be identified in a 
manner designed to maintain subject confidentiality. All records will be kept in a secure 
storage area with limited access. Clinical infor mation will not be released without the written

 Page 41  9.4.2.2  Institutional Review 
Federal regulations and ICH guidelines require that approval be obtained from an IRB before 
participation of human subjects in research studies. Before study onset, the protocol, ICF, advertisements to be used for the recruitment of study subjects, and any other written information regarding this study that is to be provided to the subject or the subject’s legal 
guardian must be approved by the IRB. Documentation of all IRB approvals and of IRB 
compliance with ICH harmonised tripartite guid eline E6(R2): Good Clinical Practice will be 
maintained by the site and will be available for review by the sponsor or its designee.  
All IRB approvals should be signed by the IRB chairman or designee and must identify the 
IRB name and address, the clinical protocol by title or protocol number or both, and the date 
approval or a favorable opinion was granted.  
9.4.2.3  Subject Consent 
Written informed consent in compliance with US Title 21  CFR Part 50 shall be obtained from 
each subject before he or she enters the st udy or before performing any unusual or nonroutine 
procedure that involves risk to the subject. If  any institution-specific modifications to 
study-related procedures are proposed or made by the site, the consent should be reviewed by 
the sponsor or its designee or both before IRB submission. Once reviewed, the investigator 
will submit the ICF to the IRB for review and approval before the start of the study. If the 
ICF is revised during the course of the study, al l active participating subjects must sign the 
revised form.  
Before recruitment and enrollment, each prospect ive subject or his/her legal guardian will be 
given a full explanation of the study and will be allowed to read the approved ICF. Once the investigator is assured that the subject/legal guardian understands the implications of participating in the study, the subject/legal guardian will be asked to give his or her consent 
to participate in the study by signing the ICF. A copy of the ICF will be provided to the 
subject/legal guardian.  
9.4.2.4  Study Reporting Requirements

principles that have their origin in the Declar ation of Helsinki, ICH E6(R2): Good Clinical 
Practice; the protocol; and all national,  state, and local laws or regulations.  
9.4.2.8  Case Report Forms and Source Documents 
Site personnel will maintain source documenta tion, enter subject data into the eCRF as 
accurately as possible, and rapidly re spond to any reported discrepancies.  
Electronic CRFs and electronic data capture will  be utilized. The electronic data capture 
system is validated and compliant with US Title 21  CFR  Part 11. Each person involved with 
the study will have an individual identifica tion code and password that allows for record 
traceability. Thus, the system, and any subsequent investigative reviews, can identify coordinators, investigators, and individuals who have entered or modified records, as well as 
the time and date of any modifications. There ma y be an internal quality review audit of the 
data and additional reviews by the clinical monitor.  
Each eCRF is presented as an electronic copy, allowing data entry by site personnel, who can add and edit data, add new subjects, identify  and resolve discrepancies, and view records. 
This system provides immediate direct data transfer to the database, as well as immediate detection of discrepancies, enabling site coordinators to reso lve and manage discrepancies in 
a timely manner.  
Paper copies of the eCRFs and other database reports may be printed and signed by the 
investigator. This system provides site personnel, monitors, and reviewers with access to 
hardcopy audits, discrepancy reviews, and investigator comment information.

PRÉCIS  
Background: 
• Patients presenting de novo with metastatic bladder cancer, or developing visceral 
metastatic disease after local treatment, are incurable with currently available therapeutic 
modalities. 
• Only a small number of chemotherapeutic agents  have been tested a nd very few have some 
single agent activity in the treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma. However most 
(>100) FDA approved anticancer agents have yet to be tested in this disease. 
• Novel approaches to the development of genom ic predictors of chemosensitivity that do 
not require clinical trials for their identification are urgently needed in order to identify 
agents that are clinically eff ective when either repurposed or discovered “de novo” 
specifically for urothelial carcinoma. Such “repurposing” of an FDA approved anticancer 
agent in order to advance therapy from one cancer to another would require only minimal 
clinical development, saving billions of doll ars and reducing the time required to reach 
routine clinical practice. 
• Our established extramural-intramural NCI collaboration pulls together significant 
expertise in biomarker development and clin ical trial design in bladder cancer. The 
innovation of this group lies not only in the nove l scientific approaches i.e. Co-eXpression 
ExtrapolatioN (COXEN) under investigation, bu t also in the successful creation of a 
cohesive multi-institutional research co llaboration dedicated to improved clinical 
outcomes in bladder cancer patients. 
• COXEN uses molecular profiles as a “Rosetta Stone” for translating drug sensitivities of 
one set of cancers into predictions for anothe r completely independent set of cell lines or 
human tumors. The COXEN methodology has been scrutinized and deemed 
methodologically sound by peer review. The ability of COXEN to predict drug effectiveness in patients a priori, from purely in vitro assays, is unique as no other tool currently either in practice or in development provides similar results.  
Objectives: 
• To determine the feasibility of using the “Co -eXpression ExtrapolatioN” (COXEN) model 
in making a real-time treatmen t decision (within 3 weeks) in  patients with advanced 
urothelial carcinoma. 
Eligibility: 
• Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic, progressive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis. 
• Patients must have progressive metastatic disease defined as new or progressive lesions on cross-sectional imaging.  
• Patients must have at least: 
o One measurable site of disease (according to RECIST criteria)  
o Or, appearance of one new bone lesion 
3 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
• Patients must have been previously treated, as defined by treatment with at least one prior 
cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen or agent. Pati ents may have received any number of prior 
cytotoxic agents. 
• Archival tumor tissue must be available for enrollment.   
• Tumor amenable to biopsy will be mandatory for this study. 
• 18 years of age or older 
• ECOG performance status <2 (Karnofsky >60%) 
Design:  
• This will be a pilot single-arm, open- label study using the COXEN score to select the “best 
next therapy” from a list o f 75 FDA-approved anti-neoplasti c drugs, in patients with 
metastatic bladder cancer who have progres sed despite treatment with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. Combinations of the listed agen ts may also be utilized provided that phase 
1 data are available. 
• The COXEN algorithm requires a multi-step process (pathology, tissue processing, mRNA 
profiling, bioinformatics, etc.) and is potentially labor intensive and time intensive.  
• Given the disease state of patients eligible for  this protocol, using this algorithm to select 
a treatment would only be a worthwhile process to undertake if it can be demonstrated that 
a very high fraction of patients is likely  to obtain the benefit from the procedure.

1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.2.1 The Burden and Natural History of Bladder Cancer 
Bladder cancer is the fifth mo st common cancer in the United States, with >70,000 new cases and 
> 14,000 deaths each year [1]. While the majority of patients present with non-muscle-invasive 
tumors, approximately 30-40% of patients have muscle-invasi ve tumors and a few harbor 
metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Surgical  resection of the bladder (radical cystectomy) 
cures approximately 50% of these patients, whil e the remainder of patients develops lethal 
metastatic recurrence.  
Summary: Patients presenting de novo with meta static bladder cancer, or developing visceral 
metastatic disease after local treatment, are inc urable with currently available therapeutic 
modalities. 1.2.2 Chemotherapy for Metastatic Bladder Cancer 
The development of the MVAC (methotrexate, vi nblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin) regimen in the 
1980’s was an advance in the treatment of metas tatic bladder cancer, with multiple trials 
7 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
demonstrating objective response rates of <50% [2-5]. However, durable responses were rare and 
treatment-related toxicities were problematic. A landmark phase III trial comparing MVAC with gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) demonstrated  similar overall surviva l outcomes (~14 months) 
between the regimens with better tolerability with GC [6] resulting in GC becoming the first-line 
treatment regimen of choice.  
There is currently no standard chemotherapy for pa tients with metastatic bl adder cancer who have 
progressed on first- line treatment. A variety of cytotoxic agents used in this “second -line” or 
“salvage” setting have demonstra ted response rates of approximately 5 -20% [7-14]. A randomized 
phase III trial of second-line vinflunine versus placeb o in patients with metastatic disease failed to 
demonstrate a statistically significant improveme nt in survival [15]. These findings can be 
summarized as follows: 1) only a s ubset of patients with bladder cancer benefit (i.e. has some level 
of objective response) from cytotoxic agents; 2) only a small number of the >120 FDA approved 
anticancer agents have ever been tested and only a few of these have clinically significant single 
agent activity in urothelial cance r. The latter fact is emblematic of urot helial cancer being one of 
the most nationally underfunded cancers despite its clinical impact on the American population.  
Combination second-line therapy may have more cl inical activity then just single-agent therapy. 
The COXEN waterfall plot reports on the high activity of several agents that may be used in combination if previously tested in at least a phase I study and found to be safe. 
Summary: Only a small number of chemotherapeutic agents have been tested and very few have 
some single agent activity in the treatment of metastatic urothelial car cinoma. However most 
(>100) FDA approved anticancer agents have yet to be tested in this disease. 
1.2.3 Current Genomic Predictors of Chemosensitivity 
The therapeutic response to a par ticular anticancer agent is modulated by multiple signaling 
pathways. As a result, effective prediction of a given pati ent’s response requires analysis of 
multiple biomarkers across different gene networks [16]. Multi-gene expression-based prediction 
strategies have already demonstrated utility in predicting clinical outcomes [17-21]. Some of these 
tools, such as Oncotype DX™ and Mamma Print ™, have become incorporated into the clinical 
care of patients with breast cancer. Despite the tremendous potential utility of multi-gene 
predictors, the current development of such predict ors of drug sensitivity has critical limitations. 
Foremost, the majority of these genomic models have been developed us ing human patient data 
from clinical trials exploring treatment with a specific regimen. As a result, the predictive models are relevant only to that specific treatment a nd new models must be developed for each new 
treatment regimen. Furthermore, as indicated  above, since only a small fraction of all FDA 
approved anticancer agents has been used in blad der cancer, single agent and combination trials 
would be required in order to generate these bio markers. This lengthy and costly approach is 
clearly not feasible and cannot keep pace with the current arsenal of chemotherapeutic or targeted agents in the drug pipeline.  
Summary: Novel approaches to the development of genomic predictors of chemosensitivity that 
do not require clinical trials for their identification are urgently needed in order to identify agents 
that are clinically effective when either repu rposed or discovered “de novo” specifically for  
urothelial carcinoma. Such “repurposing”  of an FDA approved anticancer agent  as single agent 
therapy or in combination in order to advance ther apy from one cancer to another would require 
8 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
only minimal clinical development, saving billions  of dollars and reducing the time required to 
reach routine clinical practice. 
1.2.4 UCCC-NCI Bladder Cancer Collaboration 
Progress in clinical drug development in advanced  bladder cancer is hampered by a relative lack 
of industry interest and the inability of most single centers to conduct even large Phase II trials in 
a timely manner. Over the past 3 years, we have formed a collaboration between the University of 
Colorado Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the 
NIH-Clinical Center (CC). This group is comprised of basic, translational and clinical investigators 
focused on the development of novel therapeutic a pproaches for the treatment of bladder cancer. 
In this manner, the group leverages the bladder canc er expertise of its participating researchers and 
NCI funded infrastructure (UCCC P30, NCI and NIH Clinical Center). 
Summary: Our established extramural-intramural NCI collaboration pulls together significant 
expertise in biomarker development and clinical tr ial design in bladder cancer. The innovation of 
this group lies not only in the novel scientific ap proaches (i.e. COXEN) under investigation, but 
also in the successful creation of a cohesive multi-institutional re search collaboration dedicated to 
improved clinical outcomes in bladder cancer patients.  1.2.5 COXEN for Individualized Chemosensitivity Prediction 
The “Co -eXpression ExtrapolatioN” (COXEN) algorithm ut ilizes molecular profiles as a “Rosetta 
Stone” for translating drug sensitivity signatures  of one set of cancers into that of another [22]. 
The COXEN Principle has been validated using the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Program 
NCI-60 cell lines [23-25]. The NCI-60 panel is comprised of cell lines from diverse human cancers 
that have been profiled at the DNA, RNA, protein, and functional levels. The molecular 
characteristics of each of the NCI-60 cell lines and their relationship to patterns of anticancer 
activity in over 100,000 chemically defined co mpounds and natural product extracts has been 
established [23, 26-28]. Unfortunately, it was not feasible to include all important tumor types in 
the NCI-60 such as bladder cancer. Furthermore, even if other cancer cell types were added to the panel now, all compounds screened in the past 20 years would have to be tested again in the 
updated panel to gain the full predictive power of  the database for all legacy compounds. Several 
years ago, these limitations raised two practical questions for our research team: Can drug sensitivity data on the NCI-60 panel be extrapolated to predict sensitivity of cell lines not included? 
More ambitiously, can the screening data be used to obtain predictive power for clinical responses of human cancers? To address these questions, we  developed the COXEN algorithm and have 
subsequently demonstrated accurate predictions of chemotherapy sensitivity in both human 
bladder cancer cells lines and in  bladder cancer patients [22, 29]. COXEN was retrospectively 
tested in seven independent cohort s of patients with breast (n = 275), bladder (n = 59), and ovarian 
(n= 143) cancer treated with multiagent chemot herapy, of which 233 patients were from 
prospectively enrolled clinical trials. In all studi es, COXEN effectively st ratified tumor response 
and patient survival independent of established clinical and pathologic tumor variables. In bladder 
cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin, and cisplatin, the 3-year overall survival for those with favorable COXEN gene expression models’ score  was 81% 
versus 33% for those with less favorable scores  (P = 0.002). COXEN for breast cancer patients 
treated with 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cy clophosphamide and ovarian cancer patients 
treated with platinum-containing regimens also stra tified patient survival [5-year overall survival 
9 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
100% versus 74% (P = 0.05) and 3-year ov erall survival 68% versus 43% (P = 0.008), 
respectively]. The COXEN algorithm is currently being studied in a randomized phase II study of 
muscle-invasive bladder cancer being run by the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Muscle-invasive (pT2-4N0) patients are randomized to receive gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) or methotrexate, vinblastine, adri amycin and cisplatin (MVAC), the patient then 
undergoes cystectomy and tumor is analyzed by the COXEN and the COXEN score for the GC vs MVAC combination is compared to test whether COXEN predicted a pathologic response for the combination (pT0). This approach has also been intensely scrutinized by well-known statisticians 
(MD Anderson Statistics Group, K. Baggerly; CTEP-Statistical Group, Lisa Meier-McShane; 
SWOG-Statistical Group, Cathy Tangen) and evalu ated in other tumor types and by other 
investigators with similarly promising predictive results. This approach remains to be examined in 
a prospective clinical study. 
Summary: COXEN uses molecular profiles as a “Rosetta Stone” for translating drug sensitivities 
of one set of cancers into predictions for another completely independent set of cell lines or human 
tumors. The COXEN methodology has been scrutinized and deemed methodologically sound by 
peer review. The ability of COXEN to predict drug effectiveness in patients a priori, from purely in vitro assays, is unique as no other tool curr ently either in practice or in development provides 
similar results. 
1.2.6 Preliminary Data 
1.2.6.1 Use of COXEN to rank predicted sensitivity of bladder tumors to 75 FDA approved 
anticancer agents  
1.2.6.1.1 Drug Selection 
Approximately 120 FDA approved anticancer ag ents have been tested in vitro by the 
Developmental Therapeutics Progr am (DTP) at the National Cancer Institute using the NCI-60 
cell line panel ( http://dtp.nci.nih.gov ). The 75 FDA approved anticancer  agents that will be used 
in Aim 1 ( Table 1) of this proposal were those drugs th at had 1) complete data sets and 2) a 
variation in response between “sensitive” and “resistant” cell lines that was determined by performing a linear regression on scaled rankings of cell lines vs. scaled negative logGI50 values 
for each drug following the removing cell lines in  the sensitive and resistant groups. This analysis 
verified that there was a graded drug response with in the NCI-60 panel that could be utilized for 
developing and testing gene expression-based COXEN models.

1.2.6.1.2 COXEN Score Determination and Patient Drug Assignment 
Microarray expression data from the GeneChip® Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array will be 
processed and normalized using frozen robust multiarray analysis (fRMA) [30] that allows for the individual analysis of microarray data and subseque nt utilization with other microarray data for 
data analysis such as the COXEN algorithm [22]. Gene expression models (GEM) for the prediction of chemosensitivity have been cons tructed for all the 75 FDA approved anticancer 
agents listed in Table 1  using the COXEN method [22] with biomarker identification done using 
drug sensitive and resistant gene expression from  the NCI60 cell panel and co-expression done 
using gene expression microarray data from a blad der tumor cohort [31]. The modeling process is 
completed in three distinct steps; preprocessing, fe ature extraction, and finally, model construction 
and validation. Preprocessing involves the applicat ion of frozen robust multiarray analysis (frma) 
to perform background correction, normalizati on, and summarization allowing for direct 
comparison among samples [30]. fRMA was appl ied using the fRMA package included in the 
Bioconductor suite in R. Second, for each drug, a set of biomarkers was found by implementing COXEN (coexpression extrapolation) [22] to 189 b ladder tumor samples from the Lehmann tumor 
panel in conjunction with the Na tional Cancer Institute 60 cell anticancer drug screening panel 
(NCI60). Finally, model building has been approached from two different methods. Using the biomarkers selected by COXEN, a linear discr iminant analysis model (LDA) was employed on a 
smaller subset of genetic markers identified by Misc lassification Penalized Po sterior Classification 
(MiPP) to the top twelve most resistant and most se nsitive cell lines in the NCI60 for every selected 
drug. This approach requires a new model to be constructed whenever a new sample is to be 
predicted and often leads to unstable outcomes. F or this reason, a second approach was developed. 
The second method employed logistic regression with an L2 penalty using dual optimization included in the Scikit-learn machine learning suite in Python [32]. While MiPP systematically adds 
features until addition of features does not increase model performance beyond a user defined threshold the L2 penalty allows all COXEN selec ted features to be included in the model by 
mathematically weighting features that contribute most to model performance. These weights are controlled via a parameter that was selected by  performing cross validation over all possible 
0.75/0.25 testing validation splits of the top 12 most resi stant and sensitive cell lines in the NCI60. 
After the L2 parameter was determined via cross- validation, a final model was constructed using 
11 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
all 12 most resistant and sensitive cell lines. On ce complete the final model is stationary, meaning 
the model is not reconstructed for each ne w sample allowing robust prediction among new 
samples. Drug sensitivity and resistance predictions will range from -1 to +1 with -1 representing 
the most drug-resistant and +1 representing the most drug-sensitive. The resulting data will be 
displayed for the treating clinician as shown in Figure 1  with the agents ranked in groups of 5 in 
descending order from the most sens itive on one of the tumors shown in Figure 2 . The robust 
nature of these predictions is shown in Figure 2  which plots the correlation of predicted sensitivity 
to these 75 drugs in 2 separate biopsies taken fr om 3 urothelial bladder tumors. While we will 
evaluate this intratumoral variation in the proposa l by obtaining 2-3 core biopsies of the same site, 
we do not expect this to metrically alter the predictions. 
 
1.2.7 Overview and Hypothesis 
Multiple chemotherapeutic agents have demonstr ated response rates of 5-20% when utilized as 
second-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic bladder cancer. However, no 
chemotherapeutic agents have been shown to impr ove survival in this setting and therefore, there 
is no FDA-approved second line drug for patients with metastatic bladder cancer. Furthermore, the 
ability to select patients most likely to res pond to a given anti-neoplastic agent is critical to 
improving outcomes in this clinical state. Hence, our ultimate objective is to build on the prior Figure 1: Waterfall-plot of predicted drug sensitivit y of a bladder tumor (one of the samples in Figure 2 ) to the 75 
FDA anti -neoplastic drugs based on microarray gene expression and COXEN analysis. COXEN scores are 
normalized from -1 to +1 with -1 representing  the most drug resistant and +1  representing the most drug 
sensitive. Agents ranked in groups of 5 in  descending order from the most sensitive. Floxuridine

retrospective experience with COXEN and prospectively test the hypothesis that use of tumor 
COXEN scores to select “best next therapy” for individual patients with  chemotherapy-refractory 
metastatic bladder cancer will provide superior response rates, progression free and overall 
survival compared to historical controls. However,  given the complexity of this approach, before 
embarking on such a trial, we propose to carry out a pilot trial evaluating feasibility of COXEN 
assigned “best next therapy”.

2 ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT AND ENROLLMENT  
2.1 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA  
2.1.1 Inclusion Criteria 
2.1.1.1 Patients must have a histologically conf irmed diagnosis of metastatic, progressive 
urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis. 
2.1.1.2 Patients must have progressive metastatic dise ase defined as new or progressive lesions 
on cross-sectional imaging.  
2.1.1.3 Patients must have at least: 
2.1.1.3.1 One measurable site of disease (according to RECIST criteria), defined as at least one 
lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as >20 mm with 
conventional techniques or as >10 mm w ith spiral CT scan.  See Section 6.3 for the 
evaluation of measurable disease. 
2.1.1.3.2 Or, appearance of one new bone lesion 
2.1.1.4 Patients must have been previ ously treated with at least one prior cytotoxic chemotherapy 
regimen or agent. Patients may have received any number of prior cytotoxic agents. 
2.1.1.5 Archival tumor tissue must be available for enrollment.   
2.1.1.6 Tumor amenable to biopsy will be mandatory for this study. 
2.1.1.7  Age >18 years. ECOG performance status <2 (Karnofsky >60%, see Appendix A ). 
2.1.1.8 Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:  
 hemoglobin        ≥ 9 g/dL 
 leukocytes      >3,000/mcL 
 absolute neutrophil count   >1,200/mcL 
 platelets       >75,000/mcL 
 total bilirubin     within normal institutional limits 
 AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)   <2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal 
 creatinine      1.5 x the normal institutional limits 
 OR 
 creatinine clearance     >40 mL/min/1.73 m2 
2.1.1.9 Because many of the therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, 
women of child-bearing potential and men must  agree to use adequate contraception 
(hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abst inence) prior to study entry and for the 
duration of study participation.  Should a wo man become pregnant or suspect she is 
pregnant while she or her partner is participat ing in this study, she should inform her 
treating physician immediately. 
2.1.1.10 HIV-positive patients on combination antiretrovi ral therapy may be eligible if there are 
no pharmacokinetic interactions with the agents used on the study, stable on CART 
therapy and CD4 is >200 and vi ral load is undetectable.  
2.1.1.11 Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. 
15 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
2.1.2 Exclusion Criteria 
2.1.2.1 The patient has received cytotoxic chemothe rapy (including investigational cytotoxic 
chemotherapy) within 3 weeks or biologic agents (e.g., cytokines or antibodies) within 4 
weeks prior to study enrollment. 
2.1.2.2 Patients who are receiving any investigational agents. 
2.1.2.3 Patients with known brain metastases should be  excluded from this clinical trial because 
of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic 
dysfunction that would confound the evaluati on of neurologic and other adverse events. 
Patients with brain metastases that are stable after ≥ 1 year after primary surgery or 
radiation will not be excluded.   
2.1.2.4 The subject has not recovered to baseline or CTCAE ≤ Grade 1 from toxi city due to all 
prior therapies except alopecia and other non-clinically significant AEs. 
2.1.2.5 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but  not limited to, ongoing or active infection, 
symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that woul d limit compliance with study requirements. 
2.1.2.6 Patients who are Hepatitis B or C positive.  
2.1.2.7 Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the agents used in the study have 
the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infa nts secondary to treatment of the mother 
with these agents , breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with these 
agents. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. 
2.2 S
CREENING EVALUATION  
Study eligibility is based on meeting all of the study inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria at screening before study treatment ad ministration. Screening evaluations may be 
performed as part of an NIH Screening protocol. This does not include th e baseline correlative 
studies that will only be performed after the patient has signed the consent form. 
The following assessments will be conducted no m ore than 28 days prior to subjects receiving 
the first dose of study drug on this protocol: 
x History including performance status assessment and medication history 
x Physical examination including height, weight, vital signs 
x Laboratory assessments: CBC with differ ential, acute care panel (sodium, potassium, 
chloride, total CO2 Bicarbonate, creatinine , glucose, urea nitrogen), mineral panel 
(albumin, calcium total, magnesium tota l, phosphorus), hepatic panel (alkaline 
phosphatase, ALT/GPT, AST/GOT, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin), ionized calcium, 
amylase, lipase, LDH, total protein, GGT, Hepatitis B and C. 
x 24-hour urine collection for creatinine clearance if needed  
x Urinalysis 
x Urine or serum HCG (in women of childbearing potential) 
x CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis (or  all known sites of disease) (MRI may be 
performed in subjects unable to tolerate contrast for CT). 
16 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
x CD4 levels and HIV viral load (for patients with known HIV infection on combination 
antiretroviral therapy) 
x Pathology evaluation/confirmation of urothelial carcinoma as documented in a pathology report confirmed by the referring institution ’s pathology department 
x Research biopsy (see section 5.1). This biopsy may be performed while patients are 
receiving other therapies, if they have signed this consent and been registered for screening as described in Section 2.3.  
2.3 R
EGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
Registration will be a two-part process as patients  are screened on this protocol. Authorized staff 
must register an eligible candidate with NCI Central Registration Office (CRO) within 24 hours 
of signing consent. To initially register a subject  after the participant has signed the consent, 
complete the top portion the registration Eligibility Checklist from the web site (http://home.ccr.cancer.gov/intra/eligibility/welcome.htm ) indicating that the patient is being 
registered for screening and sent via encryp ted email to: NCI Central Registration Office 
ncicentralregistration-l@mail.nih.gov . Once eligibility is confirmed  after completion of screening 
studies, complete the remainder of the form which is the eligibility checklist, indicating that the patient is being registered for tr eatment and email the completed re gistration checklist to the CRO 
at NCI Central Registration Office ncicentralregistration-l@mail.nih.gov . After confirmation of 
eligibility at Central Registration Office, CRO staff will call pharmacy to advise them of the 
acceptance of the patient on the protocol prior to  the release of any investigational agents. 
Verification of Registration will be forwarded el ectronically via e-mail to the research team. A 
recorder is available during non-working hours.  
Subjects that do not meet screening criteria s hould be removed from the study following the 
procedure in section  3.5.4 .

3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION 
3.1 S
TUDY DESIGN  
This will be a Pilot single-arm, open- label study using the COXEN score to select the “best next 
therapy” from a list of 75 FDA anti-neoplastic drugs ( Table 1), in patients with metastatic bladder 
cancer who have progressed despite treatment with  cytotoxic chemotherapy. Agents on the list 
may be given as single agent therapy or as comb ination therapy provided there are at least phase 
1 data to support the use of the combination. Elig ible patients will be treated with one or a 
combination of drugs based on the 75-drug COXEN al gorithm analysis. Each participant will be 
given an option to be assigned to a sec ond COXEN-based regimen at the time of disease 
18 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
progression. The COXEN analysis for retreatment w ill be performed on the biopsy collected at the 
time of progression; however, if the patient refuse s the biopsy or the recurrent disease is not 
amenable to biopsy, the baseline COXEN waterfall plot will be used to make the decision. No 
more than 2 COXEN-based assign ments will be allowed on study. The primary objective of this 
pilot study is to determine if a sufficiently high fraction of patients is able to have results produced 
by the COXEN algorithm within 3 weeks of initiating the process. The COXEN algorithm requires 
a multi-step process (pathology, tissue processing, mRNA profiling, bioinformatics etc.) and is potentially labor intensive and time intensive. Given the disease state of patients eligible for this 
protocol, using this algorithm to select a treatment would only be a worthwhile process to undertake if it can be demonstrated that a very hi gh fraction of patients is likely to obtain the 
benefit from the procedure. The secondary object ives include: assessment of toxicity, response 
rate and progression-free survival by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 and overall survival of the COXEN selected therapeutic agent(s).  
 
 
Figure 3 
3.1.1 Schema  
(See Figure 3 ) 
1. Consultation in the medical oncology clinic at the NIH Clinical Center

to tolerate contrast for CT)  

19 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
5. Mandatory core biopsy of a metastatic site of disease (Sample 2, Figure 4 ). (Note: samples 
1 and 2, Figure 4 will be batched and analyzed together once sample 2 has been collected.) 
6. Tissue will be processed and whole genome Af fymetrix microarray (Hu133A or similar) 
will be performed in Dr. Meltzer’s CLIA certified lab at the NIH Clinical Center . 
7. The genomic data will be transferred from the NIH to University of Colorado Cancer 
Center (UCCC) as described in section 6.2.1  and COXEN analysis performed. 
8. UCCC team will return a rank report with CO XEN scores for the 75 anti-neoplastic FDA 
approved drugs ( Figure 1 ).  
9. Molecular Tumor Board: Drug selection w ill be based on COXEN predicted potency and 
tailored to the patient’s case (renal functi on, allergies prior use etc.) as determined by the 
advisement from the members of a molecular tumor board. 
10. Drug(s) will be ordered from the NIH pharmacy. 
11. COXEN tailored treatment will be started within 3 weeks of initial biopsy.  12. Depending on restaging schedule, restaging CT at 8 weeks or 9 weeks (± 1 week).  13. Optional core biopsy of a metastatic site will be scheduled at time of disease progression.  
COXEN analysis will be performed along with mutational analysis as described in section 
5.1.1. 
 3.1.2 Pathology 
Tumor profiling will be carried out on FFPE tissues from the primary site obtained from the 
referring hospital (Sample 1, Figure 4 ) and on FFPE biopsy tissue (Samples 2 and 5, Figure 4 ) 
obtained at the NIH Clinical Center with stud y enrollment. The RNA extraction and methodology 
will be as described in our previous work [31]. We will profile the metastasis biopsy and use this data to generate the COXEN Score that will rank the 75 FDA approved anti-neoplastic drugs. 
3.1.3 COXEN Score Determination 
This will be carried out in two steps.

3.1.3.1 Quality Control Assessment of Microarray Data 
Microarray data from individual patient tumors will be genera ted using the GeneChip® Human 
Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clar a, CA) and will be assessed for quality using 
the following accepted criteria: 1) inspection of ar ray images and observe for “spatial artifacts” 
and obvious problems; 2) analysis of box and hist ogram plots of log2(PM) values for each 
individual array with comparison for consistency  across a set of fixed bladder tumor arrays; 3) 
proportion present plots will be generated using p robe pairs (PM, MM) testing gene “presence” or 
“absence” and analyzing for  consistency compared to a fixed set of bladder tumor arrays; 4) 
hybridization controls (bioB, bioC, bioD, and cre) will be plotted for verification of increasing 
concentrations within the array; 5) QC stats plots will be created measuring % present, average 
background intensity, bioB, bioC, bioD and creX presence, and 3’:5’ ratios of actin and GAPDH; 
and 6) evaluation of RNA degradation plots. If an out lier is identified in more than 2 of these tests, 
the sample will be flagged and the data deemed unreliable for COXEN analysis.  
3.1.3.2 COXEN analysis 
COXEN analysis will be done by the Cancer Phar macology Shared Resource for the University of 
Colorado Cancer Center by Dr. Daniel L. Gustaf son and Dr. Ryan J. Hansen as a backup under 
the supervision of Dr. Dan Theodorescu. 
Sample Processing & Reporting: 
• Coded gene expression data will be sent to Dr. Gustafson or Hansen at the Cancer 
Pharmacology Shared Resource with a unique identifier (UI). 
• Data will be processed for COXEN analysis with  the UI carried and validated at all steps 
using a defined SOP. 
• All data processing and predictive steps will be tracked with the use of a “sample checklist” 
as outlined in the SOP verifying each step. 
• Sample output (drug sensitivity/resistance pred iction) will be sent to the proper individual 
responsible for collecting the data along with an electronic copy of the “sample checklist” 
using the UI to identify the sample.  
Sample Analysis: 
1. Receive and log in sample data and begin “sample checklist”  
2. Perform QC Analysis for MicroArray Data. 
3. Frozen RMA process the gene expression data. 
4. Run the COXEN algorithm for prediction of drug sensitivity and resistance.  
5. Complete the data analysis and presentation (as specified in the SOP) and deliver. 
QC Analysis Steps for Individual MicroArrays 
1. Inspect array images 
– Look for “spatial artifacts”, obvious problems  
2. Boxplot and histogram plot of log2 (PM) values for each array 
21 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
– Looking for consistency across arrays, identifying outliers 
3. Proportion present plot 
– Using probe pairs (PM,MM) to test whether gene i s “Present” of “Absent”  
– Looking for consistency across arrays, identifying outliers 
4. Plot of Hybrid Controls 
– bioB, bioC, bioD, and cre are present in increasing concentrations on each array 
5. QC stats plot 
– The “qc” function returns an object containing scale -factors, % present, average 
background intensities (values greater th an 100 indicates problem) and bioB, bioC, 
bioD, and creX present calls.  It also plots the 3’/5’ ratios of actin and GAPDH (3 -
fold or greater discrepancies between arrays indicates a problem) 
6. RNA Degradation plot 
– It is expected that 5’ end will have more degradation than 3’ end. We look for 
consistency across arrays, identifying outliers 
*If an outlier is identified in more than 2 of these tests, the sample should be thrown out. 
3.2 DRUG ADMINISTRATION  
Agents will be administered per package insert. Please see Appendix B  for a summary of FDA 
approved doses. Alternate dosing or frequencies of the listed agents may also be utilized provided 
that phase 1 data are  available. Agents will be administer ed until whichever occurs first among 
the following: disease progression or toxicity which requires discontinuation of study drug. 
Subjects who have a response to COXEN-based th erapy lasting 6 months or greater have the option 
to be re-assigned to a second COXEN-based agent. If there is not an established combination (with 
at least phase 1 data for safety), only one drug would be given. No more than 2 COXEN-based 
assignments will be allowed on study. 
3.3 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
Dose modifications will be guided by package inserts and consultation between the investigator 
and NIH CC Pharmacy. 
If a drug must be permanently discontinued due to  toxicity, an alternative COXEN based regimen 
may be selected per PI discretion. Only one ch ange in regimen will be made. At the second 
occurrence of intolerable toxicity in a patient, the patient must be removed from study therapy.

5 CORRELATIVE STUDIES 
5.1 BIOSPECIMEN COLLECTION  
5.1.1 Mutational landscape of bladder cancer before and after initial therapy 
5.1.1.1 Overview and Hypothesis 
Exome sequencing has opened the door for cost efficient, hi gh-throughput, and accurate mutation 
calling by limiting the search space to the small  fraction of the genome (~2%) that encodes for 
proteins. With 340 treatment naïve bladder can cer tumors already sequenced, we have a 
compendium of catalogued mutations for which we can compare new samples. Here we will 
evaluate the catalogued mutations on exome sequen ces from treatment naïv e FFPE patient samples 
to both verify if common mutations occur in the patient and also determine if the detection of 
mutations is different between exome sequenced fr esh frozen and FFPE tumor tissue samples. In 
addition, we will also compare the same patient’ s treatment naïve FFPE primary tumor samples to 
an FFPE biopsy taken aft er initial therapy but before “best next  therapy” to test the hypothesis that 
certain mutations will be found at a higher freque ncy in treated patients suggesting their possible 
importance in drug resistance.  
5.1.1.2 Approach 
5.1.1.2.1 Tissue Samples 
Patients will undergo a percutaneous core needle biopsy of the tumor under local anesthesia. These 
percutaneous biopsies will be performed by interventional radiology (CT scan or ultrasound 
guidance). If needed, patients will be offered conscious sedation for the biopsy procedure. Sample 
collection will be performed according to standa rd operating procedures. 2-3 core needle biopsies 
will be obtained and 2-32 sample s will be formalin fixed and sent to the Laboratory of Pathology 
in the NCI. The remaining samples will be immed iately placed in cryovials, snap frozen on liquid 
nitrogen or dry ice and transported to Dr. Donald Bottaro’s laboratory (See Appendix C ). 
Archival samples will be labeled and reported as sample 1 – formalin fixed paraffin embedded 
(FFPE) sample; fresh tissue biopsies will  be labeled and reported as sample 2 – fresh baseline 
biopsy or sample 5 – biopsy at time of progression (optional). 
Mutation Detection:  Here we will perform either dire cted exome sequencing (DES) from 
formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues for 476 mutated genes de scribed above or whole 
exome sequencing (WES) using Illumina HiSeq machines and other technologies as needed.  
Tissues:  Tissues from patients will be  collected for the specific analysis as described below in 
detail. Matched normal tissues (Buffy coat/WBC) will also be collected for SNP verification.  
5.1.1.2.2 Application of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) on FFPE Tissues 
Recent prior work has demonstrated the feasib ility and robustness of F FPE exome sequencing. 
One study describes massively parallel DNA se quencing that characterizes base substitutions, 
short insertions and deletions (indels), copy number alterations and selected fusions across 287 
cancer-related genes from FFPE clinical specimens [33]. Validation of this approach using pooled 
cell lines that model key determina nts of accuracy, including mutant allele frequency, indel length 
and amplitude of copy change indicated a test sensitivity of 95- 99% across alteration types with 
27 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
>99% positive predictive value. The ability to carry out reliable exome sequencing in FFPE was 
confirmed by others [34]. There is less clarity on the issue of whether the same mutations are found 
in identical tissue samples preserved by FFPE and frozen methodologies for the purposes of 
discovery but this appears to be the case. A s mall study compared the validity of whole exome 
sequencing in one primary fresh-frozen sample , corresponding FFPE prostate cancer sample and 
matched adjacent normal prostatic tissue. The sequ enced reads were mapped and compared and 
showed comparable (but not identical) exome seque ncing results between FFPE and corresponding 
fresh-frozen cancer tissues in one sample [35]. 
5.1.1.2.3 DNA extraction from FFPE Tissues 
There are several challenges that are present wh en preparing FFPE versus frozen genomic DNA, 
all of which can be overcome to provide high quali ty sequence information. The first step will be 
to extract the sample from its paraffin embe dding. For the FFPE samples from the metastasis 
biopsy volume of 17.7mm3, we expect between 3.5- 5μg of isolated DNA. The second challenge 
with FFPE samples is the general poor quality of th e DNA extracted due to cross-linking of protein 
to DNA, separating the DNA from paraffin a nd DNA degradation from the embedding process, 
which includes time to embedding, temperature, and buffering of the paraffin itself. These issues 
have been worked out with gel separation tec hniques and proper buffering of DNA extraction 
solutions. Standard protocols are now available from peer-reviewed publications such as the two 
cited above [33, 34]. Furthermore, we have su ccessfully used the FFPE DNA Extraction Kit 
(Diagenode) and will use this kit for all FFPE gDNA extractions.  
5.1.1.2.4 Library Prep and Exome Sequencing 
Isolated DNA from FFPE samples w ill be sent to the Meltzer lab for library preparation and exome 
sequencing (pmeltzer@mail.nih.gov – 240-760-7376). We will be following the SureSelect 
Human All Exon Capture Kit (V5, Agilent Tec hnologies) protocols for library preparation, 
hybridizations, and exome capture. Sequencing will be done using the Illumina HiSeq 2500, 
providing roughly 46Gbp per lane of a flow cell run in the 2X125 mode. The exome represents roughly 30Mbp, thus by multiplexing 8 samples per lane, we can produce roughly 150X coverage of the exome.  
Sequence reads will be aligned using GSNAP [ 36] to produce .bam files (binarized sequence 
alignment/map files). We will use the GATK pl atform [37] to make SNP and indel calls, thus 
producing .vcf files (variant call format). We will fi nally use AnnoVar [38] to annotate the variant 
calls. FFPE samples require two additional correcti ons to be directly compared. First, we must 
correct for the allelic fraction to account for the purity or the admixture of the sample. By plotting 
the frequency of alleles between the two samples, we can model the difference allele frequencies 
by fitting a simple regression and thus correct of the any bias between samples. Secondly, we must 
correct for the clonality of the cells within the population. That is, does the mutation occur in all 
of the cells, thus clonal, or does a mutation arise in a subpopulation of cells, thus being subclonal. 
We will make this correction using the program ABSOLUTE [39]. After these two corrections 
have been made we can directly compare the mutations between the FFPE samples. 
5.1.1.3 Sample Comparisons 
Several analyses will assess relationships betw een mutation frequency and preservation method of 
the specimen, tumor heterogeneity, tumor progression and prior treatment.  
28 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
Frozen vs. FFPE (DES): The 476 mutated genes will be evaluated on the 20 patients enrolled in 
the study on their treatment naïve tumor sample (original specimen-Specimen 1, Figure 4 ). The 
frequency of the mutations will be compared in  a stage and grade matched fashion (to eliminate 
the effect of stage/grade on tumor mutation freque ncy which we know exist [40, 41]) to determine 
if there are any differences in mutation freque ncy (i.e. detection) as a function of preservation 
method and if this is gene/mutation dependent. 
Tumor Heterogeneity (WES):  Three replicate biopsy samples w ill be collected (Samples 2 and 
5, Figure 4 ) and 3 cores will be taken from the FFPE bl ock (as described by us [31]) of the original 
specimen (Specimen 1, Figure 4 ). For each specimen source, an analysis will be carried to 
determine the changes in mutation frequenc y as a function of tumor heterogeneity. 
Tumor Progression and Initial Treatment (WES):  We assess the relationship of mutation 
frequency as a function of progression (primary vs  metastasis) and initial treatment. Only one 
comparison will be made: baseline untrea ted from the primary tumor -Specimen 1, Figure 4 ) vs. 
metastatic site biopsy (pre “best next treatment”, Specimen 2,  Figure 4 and between pre and post 
treatment biopsies (Specimens 2 and 5 in Figure 4 respectively), which will encompass both 
variables (primary vs metastasis and pre vs post treatment). This is a recognized limitation of the 
study but it is nevertheless a clinical reality sinc e we know almost all patients that present will 
NOT have a biopsy of a treatment naïve metastasis, while most will have a treatment naïve tissue 
specimen from the initial specimen. 5.1.2 Saliva samples for genetic/genomic analysis  
Tumor samples will be used as a source of DNA for genetic/genomic studies. Saliva samples will 
be used as a source of genomic (germline DNA) fr om the patients to compare with tumor DNA 
for somatic mutations. Whole genome and whole exome studies may be conducted using the 
material collected. Studies for the analysis of ch romosomal abnormalities may also be performed. 
We plan to do genomic analysis of the saliva  samples by both whole-genome and whole-exome 
sequencing. We will confirm recurrent mutations in  genes previously identified as being mutated 
in urothelial carcinoma and we will identify additi onal altered genes and pathways that have been 
implicated in this disease and compare the responders and non-responders. See Appendix C  for details regarding saliva collection and handling  
5.1.3 Mutational landscape of circulating tumor DNA before and after “best next therapy”  
5.1.3.1 Overview and Hypothesis 
There are currently no peripheral blood-based marke rs available to provide an early indication of 
response to systemic therapy in patients with meta static bladder cancer. We will test the hypothesis 
that circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) with cancer specific mutations will be present in all patients 
before “best next therapy”. We will also examine 1) the molecular similarity of the “liquid biopsy” 
(ctDNA) to the contemporaneous tumor biopsy; 2) The change in muta tion profile of the liquid 
biopsy following the “best next therapy” described in Aim 1 which may provide clues to the 
mechanisms responsible for the observed clinical response. 
5.1.3.2 Sample Collection and Handling 
Patients enrolled in the trial will undergo collect ion of a blood sample for evaluation of changes 
in mutation profile, as detailed in Appendix C .  
29 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
 
5.1.3.3 Approach 
The ctDNA will be evaluated using well described approaches that we [42] and other have recently 
described [43, 44]. The studies will be performed in the laboratory of Dr. Paul Meltzer. 
5.1.3.3.1 ctDNA isolation   
ctDNA will be extracted using the QIAmp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen). It is estimated 
that there is between 1-100ng/ml ctDNA in blood plasma. Given the 6-10ml of plasma samples, 
we estimate the total ctDNA yield to be 6ng- 1μg. To determine if somatic mutations or copy 
number alterations have arisen in patient tumors , we will also extract gDNA from white blood 
cells, which can be done using the DNAeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen).  
5.1.3.3.2 Exome Sequencing 
Isolated DNA samples will be sent to the Meltzer Lab for library preparation and exome 
sequencing. We will be following the Sure Select Human All Exon Capture Kit (V5, Agilent 
Technologies) protocols for library preparation, hybridizations, and exome capture. Sequencing 
will be done using the Illumina HiSeq 2500, providing  roughly 46Gbp per lane of a flow cell run 
in the 2X125 mode. We expect to find only a small fraction of the full exome within ctDNA but use the full 30Mbp for calculating coverage. The exome represents roughly 30Mbp, thus by 
multiplexing 8 samples per lane, we can produce roughly 150X coverage of the exome. To avoid 
technical differences in sequencing, we will match multiplexed ctDNA with exome white blood cell exomes on the same flow cell. We will follo w the same sequence analysis methods as outlined 
in Aim 2. Sequence reads will be aligned usin g GSNAP to produce bam fi les (binarized sequence 
alignment/map files). We will use the GATK platf orm to make SNP and indel calls, thus producing 
vcf files (variant call format). We will finall y use AnnoVar to annotate the variant calls.  
5.1.3.3.3 Sample Comparisons and Patient Outcome Analyses 
Two analyses will assess relationships between  mutation frequency and prior treatment and 
mutation frequency and patient outcome. Figure 5: Blood sample processing  

30 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
Sensitivity of in ctDNA Tumor Mu tation to Detect Metastasis (DES):  ctDNA will be obtained 
at baseline. Since all these patien ts have metastatic disease detectab le by imaging, we expect the 
ctDNA to harbor detectable mutations. This will be carried out on a smaller subset (to enhance the 
feasibility of detection by using multiple methods ) [42] of the 476 mutated genes mentioned above 
with the addition of any new genes found in Aim 2 as a function of progression and treatment. 
Tumor Mutation in ctDNA vs. Mutation in Biopsy (DES):  ctDNA and contemporaneous biopsy 
mutations will be compared (Specimen 2 vs. 3, Figure 4 ). This will be ca rried out on a smaller 
subset (to enhance the feasibility of detection by using multiple methods) [42] of the 476 mutated 
genes mentioned above with the addition of an y new genes found in Aim 2 as a function of 
progression and treatment. 
Tumor Mutation vs “best next therapy” (WES):  We assess the relationship of mutation 
frequency as a function of treatment. Only one co mparison will be made: baseline pretrial blood 
(Specimen 3, Figure 4) vs. post-treatment (Specimen 4, Figure 4 ). We realize that it is possible 
that all 20 patients will be treated with a different drug. However, we will still be able to answer 
the question if some treatments alter the genom ic composition of the ctDNA, a question that has 
not yet been answered in bladder cancer and a stepping stone to larger and more directed studies.  
Tumor Mutation vs Patient Outcome (WES):  As above, the ctDNA will be obtained at baseline 
and 8 or 9 weeks post “best next therapy”. Cox propor tional hazards model will be used to 
determine the association of over all survival and progression-free survival with various ctDNA 
findings (presence or absence of detectable mutations , type of mutations/gene families in baseline, 
type of mutations/gene families in post treatment sample, presence of new mutations as a function 
of treatment vs no new mutations arising after tr eatment). For all survival analyses, the time to 
death due to bladder cancer will be defined as the time between the date when the baseline sample 
of blood was obtained and the date of death. Survival curves will be compared using log-rank testing. This will be an exploratory analysis ba sed on the limited number of patients that will be 
enrolled on the study.  
5.1.4 Immune Subset Analysis  
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be  assessed using multipar ameter flow cytometry 
for immune subsets including but not necessarily limited to CD8+ T-cells, CD4+Foxp3- T-cells, 
Tregs, monocyte subsets, MDSC subsets. Assessment will include functional markers, i.e. PD-1, 
Tim-3, CTLA-4, PD-L1, HLA-DR and/or CD40.  
See Appendix C for details regarding blood collection and handling.  
Members of the Trepel lab will enter the samples in a secure patient database, process the samples 
for viable cell storage, label each sample with a unique 2D barcode, and viably store the samples. 
They will prepare the samples for staining, s tain and run the samples by multiparametric flow 
cytometry (MACSQuant, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, DE), and analyze the data using 
FlowJo (FlowJo LLC, Ashland, OR) software.   
5.1.5 Peripheral Blood Immune Gene Expression  
Peripheral blood immune gene expression will be  evaluated by the Trepel Lab using the 
NanoString nCounter ® platform (NanoString Technologies, Seat tle, WA). RNA will be isolated 
using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit according to  the manufacturer’s instructions. Peripheral 
immune gene expression will be evaluated usin g the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel of 730 
31

Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
immune genes and 40 control genes at baseline an d post-therapy to look for correlates of clinical 
response with innate or adaptive immunity. 
Contact the Trepel Lab, as detailed in Section  5.1.4  and in Appendix C:  Sample Collection for 
Correlative Studies .  
5.1.6 Pro-inflammatory cytokines  
Plasma levels of a comprehensive panel of pro-infl ammatry molecules will be tested, including 
IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, and TNF-α  (inflammatory cytokines 
panel III). Many of the markers can be produced by activated T cells. The analysis will be 
conducted with MSD V-PLEX technology that provides the best assays for cytokine analysis.

Ship Monday-Thursday only to: 
William Figg Laboratory 
9000 Rockville Pike Bldg. 10/Room 4B11 Bethesda, MD 20892 Phone: 240-760-6180 
5.1.6.1 Laboratory test and data analysis  
All plasma samples will be transferred to Dr. Liang Cao’s laboratory  (at Bldg. 37/Rm6134, phone: 
301-435-9039) for the analysis of angiogenesis markers and pro-inflammatory cytokines. 5.1.7 Plasma HGF and MET  
Plasma will be collected to determine whether urinary hepato cyte growth factor (HGF), urinary 
soluble MET receptor (sMet), plasma HGF and plasma Met levels are biomarkers of bladder 
cancer (transitional cell carcinoma; TCC) and/ or response to systemic treatment with the 
combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab. Blo od samples for correlatives may be drawn ± 2 
days of specified collection time point. 
Electrochemiluminescence immunoassays for c-Met and HGF. We use Streptavidin-coated 96-
well plates (MSD, Gaithersburg, MD) designed specifically for use in a Meso Scale Discovery 
Sector 2400 Imager. For both assays, a biotin-tagge d, affinity-purified specific capture antibody 
either R&D BAF 358 or R&D MAB 694 is added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at room 
temperature (RT) with shaking. Sample wells are then washed with PBS before adding standards 
32 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
and patient plasma / urine samples; diluted s tandards are used for c-Met (R&D 358-MT-100) and 
HGF (R&D 294-HG recombinant human HGF) to gene rate a curve. Plates are then incubated for 
1 hour at RT while shaking. Wells are then wash ed with PBS before adding detection antibody 
(R&D AF 276 with MSD Sulfotag for c-Met), (R&D AF-294 labeled with MSD Sulfotag for HGF) 
for 1 hour at RT with shaking. Finally, plate wells are washed four times with PBS before adding MSD Read Buffer T and then read immediately  in a MSD Sector 2400 Imager. All samples and 
standards are measured in duplicate. Mean values  from a standard curve are constructed by plotting 
signal intensity against standard concentration. A nonlinear regression curve fitting algorithm using GraphPad Prism is used to generate an e quation from which sample values for c-Met or HGF 
concentration are calculated from mean signal intensity values. 
x Blood samples should be collected prior to an y surgery or drug treatment in the presence 
of citrate or EDTA as anticoagulant. Assu ming 50% of the whole blood volume will be 
obtained as plasma, the blood volume required for  sMet analysis is 1 ml per sample; the 
blood volume required for HGF analysis is 4 mL. 
x Blood samples should be centrifuged within 30 min at 1,300 rcf at room temperature for 10 minutes. Do not use braking to stop the centr ifuge. This will give three layers: (from 
top to bottom) plasma, leucocytes (buffy coat) and erythrocytes.  
x Carefully aspirate the supernatant (plasma) at  room temperature and transfer to a new 
centrifuge tube. Take care not to disrupt the cell layer or transfer any cells.  
x Inspect the plasma for turbidity. Turbid samp les should be centrifuged and the clarified 
supernatant should be transferred to cryovials and stored at –80°c.  Ensure that the cryovials 
are properly labeled. 
Plasma samples will be stored by Dr. Figg’s laboratory and processed and analyzed by Dr. 
Bottaro’s laboratory. See Appendix C:  Sample Collection for Correlative Studies  for details 
regarding collection and handling of specimens. 
5.1.8 Circulating tumor cells (CTC)  
Peripheral blood will be collected  to correlate changes in circ ulating tumor cells with clinical 
response.  CTCs will be assessed using ferr ofluidic enrichment and multi-parameter flow 
cytometric detection. CTCs are identified by positive expression of epithelial markers and a 
viability marker and negative expre ssion of hematopoietic markers.  
See Section  5.1.4 and Appendix C:  Sample Collection for Correlative Studies  for details 
regarding collection and handling of specimens. 5.1.9 Circulating tumor cells (Epic Science)  
For details regarding collection and handling of bl ood samples to be sent to Epic Science, see 
Appendix C:  Sample Collection for Correlative Studies . 
IMPORTANT: The first 5 mL of blood collected from the fresh venipuncture cannot be used for 
the collection into the Streck tubes due to po ssibility of contaminating epithelial cells during 
venipuncture. Please ensure that at least one bl ood tube of 5 mL or more is collected prior to 
collection of the CTC sample to avoid adversely affecting the test results.  
Prevention of Backflow: Since Streck Cell-Free DNA BCT tubes contain chemical additives, it is 
important to avoid possible backflow from the tube. To guard against backflow, observe the 
following precautions:  
33 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
x Keep patient’s arm in the downward position during the collection procedu re.  
x Hold the tube with the stopper uppermost.  
x Release tourniquet once the blood starts to flow into the tube, or within 2 minutes of 
application.  
x Tube contents should not touch stopper or the end of the needle during the collection 
procedure.

5.1.10 Pharmacogenetic Studies  
Blood samples will be collected for pharmacoge netic studies to analyze the genomic DNA and 
assess genotype of the most relevant drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters (DMET). DNA 
will be analyzed on a DMET Plus (Affymetrix) genotyping platform that tests for 1,936 genetic variations in 225 drug disposition genes, in cluding 47 CYP (phase I metabolism) genes, 13 non-
CYP (phase I metabolism) genes, 78 phase II metabolizing genes (including UGTs), 63 transporters, 4 genes involved in facilitation of drug transporters, 9 genes involved in global 
regulation of drug metabolizing/transporting proteins, 4 drug binding proteins, and 4 drug 
targets. 
34

Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
Of specific interest to etoposide are polymorphisms in CYP3A4, ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), and 
UGT1A1, all of which are included in the DMET analysis. 
See Appendix C:  Sample Collect ion for Correlative Studies  for details regarding collection 
and handling of specimens. 
5.2 FDG-PET  MRI 
Whole body Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) combined with diffusion-weighted imaging is 
becoming an established method in staging of cancer s and has been proven to be a feasible method 
for detection of small foci of metastases (1). In addition, MRI provides superb soft tissue 
characterization, which is helpful in evaluati on of local spread and recurrence of pelvic 
malignancies – such as bladder cancer - where Computed  Tomography (CT) can be limited due to 
attenuation and beam hardening, caused by bony frame of the pelvis.  
Positron Emission Tomography (PET), on the ot her hand, provides sensitiv e functional data for N 
and M staging of malignancies with poor anatomica l details and soft tissue characterization. This 
pitfall of PET imaging led researchers to propose  and ultimately develop a combined technique 
comprising of PET and MRI (2). PET-MRI scan ners became available relatively recently, and 
several applications of this power ful tool have been investigated  in central nervous system and 
body malignancies (3). However, metastatic bladder ca ncer has not been a focus of evaluation with 
this technique and combined PET-MRI data for staging of bladder cancer is scarce.  Patients will be scanne d at baseline on a combined 3T Siemens Verio MRI –PET system (Erlangen, 
Germany) in the Laboratory of Diagnostic Radiology Research, Clinical Center. The first scan will 
be performed at baseline before chemotherapy, follo wed by a second scan after the first restaging 
scans (8 or 9 weeks) to assess the treatment response. Patient will arrive at the nuclear medicine 
department and will receive an injection of radiotracer –
18F Fludeoxyglucose (FDG) – via an 
intravenous catheter. Dose of FDG will be calcula ted based on patient’s body weight. Patient will 
be encouraged to be hydrated during the uptake phase of 60 mins. Afterwards, patient will be 
brought to MRI-PET suite to undergo whole body  MRI-PET, which will be performed using 
several predetermined pulse sequences including; diffusion weighted imaging, conventional T1 
and T2 weighted sequences, and dynamic post contra st.  Patient will receive a single injection of 
0.1 mmol/kg of gadolinium-based contra st via a previously placed in travenous line. We expect the 
entire image acquisition - from neck down to mid thigh - to be accomplished in less than 1 hour.  
5.3 SAMPLE STORAGE , TRACKING AND DISPOSITION  
Samples will be ordered in CRI S and tracked through a Clinical Trial Data Management system. 
Should a CRIS screen not be available, the CRIS  downtime procedures will be followed.  Samples 
will not be sent outside NIH without IR B notification and an executed MTA.  
5.3.1 Laboratory of Paul Meltzer 
All samples will be stored in monitored freezers/ref rigerators in the Meltzer laboratory at specified 
temperatures with alarm systems in place. All samples  will be tracked by un ique sample identifiers 
with bar code labeling, using the Labmatrix software and the Genologic Clarity LIMS system. 
Secure computer database systems (Labmatrix and C larity LIMS) will be used to track all samples 
collected on this protocol.  The system will contain data that includes, but is not limited to the unique sample identifiers, storage locations and conditions, biologic study results, clinical 
35 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
information, and corresponding records  of all derivatives generated fr om samples/tissues collected 
on this protocol.  The system will employ mechanisms for restricting users to viewing only the 
level of data appropriate for each individual user, will provide the capability to audit any data 
modification, and will be maintained and back ed up according to established standards. 
5.3.2 Laboratory of Jane Trepel  
Samples will be processed immediately by the Trepel  laboratory. Biospecimens will be collected 
and processed using validated SOPs that will ensure both specimen quality and patient 
confidentiality. Using a computerized inventor y system and a backup hardcopy process, all 
specimen collection and processing  steps will be documented and the specific location of each 
specimen will be tracked. Each  new specimen collected will be assigned a unique barcode 
identifier that can be linked to the original sp ecimen collected and other relevant information 
within the inventory system. Specimen labels w ill indicate: protocol number, order in which the 
patient enrolled on the trial, ty pe of sample, collection time, and total volume collected, as 
appropriate. The inventory process contains other security provisions sufficient to safeguard 
patient privacy and confi dentiality. Access to the inventory system and associated documents will 
be restricted to appropriate indi viduals. Requests to use specimens stored in the repository must 
be approved. SOPs ensure that any changes in infor med consent made by a patient and relayed to 
the PI will be reflected in the inventory system to ensure that specimens are destroyed as appropriate. All laboratory personnel will be trained to adhere to SOPs and will be monitored for 
high-quality performance. 
5.3.3 Clinical Pharmacology Program 
All samples sent to the Blood Processing Core (B PC) will be bar-coded,  with data entered and 
stored in the LABrador (aka LabSamples) utilized by the CPP. This is a secure program, with 
access to LABrador limited to defined CPP perso nnel, who are issued individual user accounts. 
Installation of LABrador is limited to computers sp ecified by Dr. Figg. These computers all have 
a password restricted login screen. All Figg  lab personnel with access to patient information 
annually complete the NIH online Protection of Human Subjects course.  The program creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and sample box, which cannot be traced 
back to patients without LABrador access. The data recorded for each sample includes the patient 
ID, name, trial name/protocol number, time drawn, cycle time point, dose, material type, as well 
as box and freezer location. Patient demograph ics associated with the clinical center patient 
number are provided in the system. For each sample , there are notes associated with the processing 
method (e.g. delay in sample processing, storage conditions on the ward, etc.). 
Bar-coded samples are stored in bar-coded boxes in locked freezers at either -20 C or -80 C 
according to stability requirements. These freezers are located onsite in the CPP and offsite at NCI 
Frederick Central Repository Services in Frederick, MD. Visitors to the laboratory are required to 
be accompanied by laboratory staff at all times. 
Access to stored clinical samples is restricted.  Samples will be store d until requested by a 
researcher named on the protocol. All requests are monitored and tracked in LABrador. All 
researchers are required to sign a form stating that the samples are only to be used for research 
purposes associated with this tr ial (as per IRB approved protocol) and that any unused samples 
must be returned to the CPP. It is the responsibility of the NCI Principal Investigator to ensure that the samples requested are being used in a manner consistent with IRB approval. 
36 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
Following completion of this study, samples will  remain in storage as detailed above. Access to 
these samples will only be granted following IRB approval of an additional protocol, granting the 
rights to use the material. 
Sample bar-codes are linked to  patient demographics and limited clinical information. This 
information will only be provided to investigators listed on this protocol, via registered use of the 
LABrador. It is critical that the sample remains linked to patient information such as race, age, dates of diagnosis and death, and histological in formation about the tumor, in order to correlate 
genotype with these variables. 
5.3.4 Sample Destruction, End of Protocol Procedures 
All specimens obtained in the protocol are used as  defined in the protocol. Any specimens that are 
remaining at the completion of the protocol will be  stored in the conditions  described below. The 
study will remain open so long as  sample or data analysis conti nues. Samples from consenting 
subjects will be stored until they are no longer of scientific value or if a subject withdraws consent 
for their continued use, at which time they will  be destroyed. The PI will report any loss or 
destruction of samples to the NIH Intramural IRB as soon as he is made aware of such loss. 
If the patient withdraws consent the participants data will be excluded from future distributions, 
but data that have already been distributed for a pproved research use will not be able to be 
retrieved. The PI will report destroyed samples to the IRB if samples become unsalvageable because of 
environmental factors (ex. broken freezer or lack of dry ice in a shipping container) or if a patient withdraws consent. Samples will also be reported as lo st if they are lost in transit between facilities 
or misplaced by a researcher. Freezer problems, lost samples or other problems associated with 
samples will also be reported to the IRB, th e NCI Clinical Director, and the office of the CCR, 
NCI. 
5.4 S
AMPLES FOR GENETIC /GENOMIC ANALYSIS  
5.4.1 Description of the scope of genetic/genomic analysis 
The genetic studies are disc ussed in detail in sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2. They will be performed on 
tumor tissue as well as blood and will include  directed exome seque ncing of 476 genes and/or 
whole exome sequencing.  
5.4.2 Description of how privacy and confident iality of medical information/biological 
specimens will be maximized 
Confidentiality for genetic samples will be maintained as described in section 5.3.1.  
5.4.3 Management of Results 
Subjects will be contacted if a clinically ac tionable gene variant is discovered. Clinically 
actionable findings for the purpose of this study are defined as disorders appearing in the American 
College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recom mendations for the return of incidental findings 
that is current at the time of primary analysis. A list of current guidelines is maintained on the CCR 
intranet:  
https://ccrod.cancer.gov/confluence/disp lay/CCRCRO/Incidental+Findings+Lists ). Subjects who 
still remain on the study will be contacted at this time with a request to provide a blood sample to 
37 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
be sent to a CLIA certified laboratory within the NIH or as a send-out test to Mayo Clinic. If the 
research findings are verified in the CLIA certifie d lab, the subject will be referred to a genetic 
healthcare provider within the NIH for the disclosure of the results.  
This is the only time during the course of the study that incidental findings will be returned. No 
interrogations regarding clinically actionable findings will be made after the primary analysis. 
6 DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION  
6.1 DATA COLLECTION  
C3D and LabMatrix will be used for data collecti on purposes on this study. All data will be kept 
secure. The PI will be responsible for overseeing entry of data into an in-house password protected 
electronic system and ensuring data accuracy, consistency and timeliness. The principal 
investigator, associate investigators/research nurses and/or a contracted data manager will assist 
with the data management efforts. All data obtained during the conduct of the protocol will be kept 
in secure network drives or in approved alternative sites that comply  with NIH security standards. 
Primary and final analyzed data will have identifiers  so that research data can be attributed to an 
individual human subject participant. 
An abnormal laboratory value will be consider ed an AE if the laboratory abnormality is 
characterized by any of the following: 
x Results in discontinuation from the study 
x Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
x Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention 
x Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including hospitalization.  
x Is judged by the Investigator to be of significant clinical impact 
x If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator will 
provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s 
outcome. 
End of study procedures: Data will be stored according to HHS, FDA regulations and NIH 
Intramural Records Retention Schedule as applicable.  
Loss or destruction of data: Should we become aware that a major breach in our plan to protect 
subject confidentiality and trial data has occurred, the IRB will be notified.  
As all agents on the study are FDA approved, only the following events will be recorded: 
x All Grade 2 unexpected  events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to the 
research;  
x All Grade 3 and 4 events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to the research;  
x All Grade 5 events regardless of attribution;  
x All Serious Events regardless of attribution.

6.3 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re-evaluated for response every 8 or 9 weeks 
depending on visit schedule. In addition to a ba seline scan, confirmatory scans should also be 
obtained  not less than 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response. 
Response and progression will be evaluated in th is study using the new international criteria 
proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1) [45]. Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of  malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 
criteria. 
6.3.1 Definitions 
Evaluable for toxicity: All patients will be ev aluable for toxicity from the time of their first 
treatment with any of the agents. 
39 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
Evaluable for objective response: Only those pa tients who have measurable disease present at 
baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have ha d their disease re-evaluated will 
be considered evaluable for response. These patients will have their response classified according 
to the definitions stated below. (Note: Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to 
the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) 
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response: Patients who have lesions present at baseline that are 
evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measura ble disease, have received at least one cycle 
of therapy, and have had their disease re-evalua ted will be considered evaluable for non-target 
disease. The response assessment is based on th e presence, absence, or unequivocal progression 
of the lesions.  
6.3.2 Disease Parameters 
Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are define d as those that can be accurately measured in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as: 
x By chest x-ray: >20 mm 
x By CT scan: 
o Scan slice thickness 5 mm or under: as >10 mm 
x With calipers on clinical exam: >10 mm 
All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). 
Malignant lymph nodes. To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be >15 mm in short axis when assessed by  CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed. 
Non-measurable disease. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non-measurable. 
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for ra diographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
definition, simple cysts. 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastas es can be considered as measurable lesions, if 
they meet the definition of measurability desc ribed above. However, if non-cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. 
Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selec ted on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measuremen ts.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the 
largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducibl e measurement in which circumstance the next 
largest lesion which can be measured reproducibl y should be selected.  A sum of the diameters 
40 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
(longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated 
and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then 
only the short axis is added into the sum.  The base line sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. 
Non-target lesions. All other lesions (or sites of  disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions  are not required, but the presence, absence, or 
in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  6.3.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in  metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as clos ely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. The same method of assessment and the same tec hnique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam. 
Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and t10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest x-ray:  Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as mea surable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung . However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defi ned measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have  slice thickness greater 
than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable les ion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is 
also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excell ent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; 
however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image 
quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement. Furthe rmore, the availability of MRI is variable 
globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed , the technical specifications of the scanning 
sequences used should be optimized for the evaluati on of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, 
as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the 
lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the 
RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed 
with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
PET-CT: At present, the low dose or attenuation c orrection CT portion of a combined PET-CT is 
not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for us e with RECIST measurements.  However, if the 
site can document that the CT performed as part of  a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to 
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for 
RECIST measurements and can be used intercha ngeably with conventional CT in accurately 
41 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, how ever, that the PET portion of the CT introduces 
additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or 
MRI is advised.  If there is concern about rad iation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of 
CT in selected instances. 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy: The utilization of these t echniques for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when 
biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in  trials where recurrence following complete 
response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess respons e.  If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete 
clinical response. Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and 
PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) ha ve been published [46-48]. In addition, the 
Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-125 progression criteria which are to be 
integrated with objective tumor assessment for us e in first-line trials in ovarian cancer [49]. 
Cytology, Histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses (PR) 
and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic orig in of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stab le disease (an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive disease. 
FDG-PET: While FDG-PET response assessments  need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanni ng to complement CT scanning in assessment 
of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease) . New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging 
can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up:  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD.  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confi rmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT scans are needed to  determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan). If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not 
PD. 
c. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy 
in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this ci rcumstance should be prospectively described 
42 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
in the protocol and supported by disease-spec ific medical literature for the indication.  
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR 
due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
Note: A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding ti ssue on the attenuation corrected image. 
6.3.4 Response Criteria 
6.3.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all ta rget lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum of diameters. 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase  in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest 
on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20 %, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progressions). 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage  to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study. 6.3.4.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis). Note:  If tumor markers are init ially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient 
to be considered in complete clinical response. Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits. Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression  
of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression  should not normally trump target lesion 
status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesi ons only is exceptional, the opinion of the treating 
physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at 
a later time by the review pane l (or Principal Investigator). 
6.3.4.3 Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best overall response is the best response reco rded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started). The patien t's best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of 
disease progression at tha t time should be reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

6.3.5 Duration of Response 
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). 
44 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented. 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is me asured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
6.3.6 Progression-Free Survival 
PFS is defined as the duration of time from star t of treatment to time  of progression or death, 
whichever occurs first. 
6.4 TOXICITY CRITERIA  
The following adverse event management guidelines  are intended to ensure the safety of each 
patient while on the study. The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. 
All appropriate treatment areas should have acces s to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy 
of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopmen t/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40 ).  
7 SAFETY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS/DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
7.1 D
EFINITIONS  
7.1.1 Adverse Event 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a human sub ject, including any abnormal sign (for example, 
abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.  
7.1.2 Suspected adverse reaction 
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse even t for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implie s a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
7.1.3 Unexpected adverse reaction 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
investigator brochure or is not listed at the specific ity or severity that has been observed; or, if an 
investigator brochure is not required or available,  is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current applicat ion. "Unexpected” 
also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator 
brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as  anticipated from the pharmacological properties 
of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under 
investigation. 
45 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
7.1.4 Serious  
An Unanticipated Problem or Protocol Deviation is serious if it meets the definition of a Serious 
Adverse Event or if it compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others. 
7.1.5 Serious Adverse Event 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is  considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following: 
x Death, 
x A life-threatening adverse drug experience 
x Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
x Persistent or significant incapacity or substa ntial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions 
x A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
x Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
7.1.6 Disability 
A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
7.1.7 Life-threatening adverse drug experience 
Any adverse event or suspected adverse reaction th at places the patient or subject, in the view of 
the investigator or sponsor, at immediate risk of deat h from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does 
not include a reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
7.1.8 Protocol Deviation (NIH Definition) 
Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB-approved research protocol.   7.1.9 Non-compliance (NIH Definition) 
The failure to comply with applicable NIH Huma n Research Protections Program (HRPP) policies, 
IRB requirements, or regulatory requirements for the protection of human research subjects. 
7.1.10 Unanticipated Problem 
Any incident, experience, or outcome that: 
x  Is unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to  
(a) the research risks that are described in the IRB-approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents, and 
(b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND  
x Is related or possibly related to participation in the research; AND  
46 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
x Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm  (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or soc ial harm) than was previously known or 
recognized. 
7.2 NIH  INTRAMURAL IRB  AND CLINICAL DIRECTOR REPORTING  
7.2.1 NIH Intramural IRB and NCI Clinical Dire ctor Expedited Reporting of Unanticipated 
Problems and Deaths 
The Protocol PI will report in the NIH Problem form to the NIH Intramural IRB and NCI Clinical 
Director: 
x All deaths, except deaths due to progressive disease  
x All Protocol Deviations 
x All Unanticipated Problems 
x All non-compliance 
Reports must be received within 7 days of PI awareness via iRIS. 
7.2.2 NIH Intramural IRB Requirements for PI Reporting at Continuing Review 
The protocol PI will report to the NIH Intramural IRB:  
1. A summary of all protocol deviations in a tabul ar format to include the date the deviation 
occurred, a brief description of the deviation and any corrective action. 
2. A summary of any instances of non-compliance 
3. A tabular summary of the following adverse events: 
x All Grade 2 unexpected  events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to the 
research;  
x All Grade 3 and 4 events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to the research;  
x All Grade 5 events regardless of attribution;  
x All Serious Events regardless of attribution.  
NOTE : Grade 1 events are not required to be reported.  
7.3 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
7.3.1 Principal Investigator/Research Team  
The clinical research team will meet on a regular basis when patients are being actively treated on 
the trial to discuss each patient. Decisions about dose level enrollment and dose escalation if 
applicable will be made based on the toxicity data from prior patients.  
All data will be collected in a timely manner and re viewed by the principal investigator or a lead 
associate investigator. Adverse events will be reported as required above. Any safety concerns, 
new information that might affect either the ethica l and or scientific conduct of the trial, or protocol 
deviations will be immediately reported to the IRB using iRIS.  
The principal investigator will review adverse event and response data on each patient to ensure 
safety and data accuracy. The principal inve stigator will personally conduct or supervise the 
47 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
investigation and provide appropri ate delegation of responsibilities to other members of the 
research staff.  
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
It would be desirable if a fraction consistent with  90% of patients has a successful drug assignment 
by COXEN. To evaluate this in a pilot fashion,  a total of 20 patients will undergo the processes 
necessary to undertake the algorithm and the time required to obtain the final treatment assignment 
will be classified as being less than or equal to 21 days or greater than 21 days. A success would 
be a result in 21 days or less. With 20 patients , if 16 or greater are able to have a success, the 
probability that this would occur would be 95.7% if the true probability of a success for a given 
patient were 90% and it would be 5.1% if it we re only 60%. Thus, observing 16 or more out of 20 
patients with success would make it much more likely that the process would be associated with 
90% success for each patient than 60%. Should only 15 patients be included in this trial, if 12 or 
greater are able to have a success, then the probab ility that this would occur would be 94.4% if the 
true probability of a success for a given patient we re 90% and it would be 9.1% if it were only 
60%. Thus, while 15 patients would yield useful information, 20 patients as opposed to 15 patients 
would reduce the probability of accepting the results as positive when they may not be, based on a low true rate of 60% success, from 9.4% to 5.1%.  
The secondary objectives for this study are as foll ows: to assess the progression-free survival using 
treatment suggested by the COXEN model in pati ents with advanced urothelial carcinoma; to 
assess the response rate using treatment suggested by the COXEN model in patients with advanced 
urothelial carcinoma; to assess the overall survival using treatment suggested by the COXEN 
model in patients with a dvanced urothelial carcinoma ; to evaluate toxicity with “best next 
therapy”. The Kaplan Meier method will be used to estimate PFS and OS.  Responses will be estimated along with a 95% confidence interval. To xicity will be evaluated using descriptive 
methods. 
We expect that accrual of 20 patients can be comp leted within 12 months given our previous rates 
of accrual for similar patients. 
9 HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTIONS  
9.1 R
ATIONALE FOR SUBJECT SELECTION  
Subjects with a diagnosis of urothelial carcinom a of the bladder, urethra, ureter, or renal pelvis 
will be eligible for participation in this study.  Individuals of any race or ethnic group will be 
eligible for t his study.  Eligibility assessment will be ba sed solely on the patient’s medical status.  
Recruitment of patients onto this study will be through standard CCR mechanisms.  No special 
recruitment efforts will be conducted. 
9.1.1 Selection Based on Gender, Ethnicity, and Race 
Subjects from all racial/ethnic groups and both genders  are eligible for this study if they meet the 
eligibility criteria. To date, there is no i nformation that suggests that differences in drug 
metabolism, immune response or disease response w ould be expected in one group compared with 
another. Efforts will be made to extend accr ual to a representative population, but in this 
preliminary study, a balance must be struck betw een patient safety considerations and limitations 
on the number of individuals exposed to potentially toxic and/or ineffective treatments on one hand 
48 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
and the need to explore gender and ethnic aspe cts of clinical research on the other hand. If 
differences in outcome that correlate with ethnic identity are noted, accrual may be expanded or a 
follow-up study may be written to investigate those differences more fully.  
9.1.2 Justification for Exclusions 
Pregnant women are excluded due to potentially increased risks of serious side effects from the 
drugs administered on this study. Many of the therap eutic agents used in this trial are known to be 
teratogenic. 
9.2 PARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN  
Individuals under the age of 18 will not be eligible for participation in this study based on the fact 
that patients under 18 are unlikely to have this di sease and there are unknown toxicities in pediatric 
patients. 
9.3 PARTICIPATION OF SUBJECTS UNABLE TO GIVE CONSENT  
Adults unable to give consent are excluded from enrolling in the protocol.  However, re-consent 
may be necessary and there is a possibility , though unlikely, that subjects could become 
decisionally impaired. For this reason and becaus e there is a prospect of direct benefit from 
research participation (section 9.4.1) , all subjects ≥ age 18 will be offered the opportunity to fill in 
their wishes for research and care, and assign  a substitute decision maker on the “NIH Advance 
Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Participation” form so that another person can 
make decisions about their medical care in the even t that they become incapacitated or cognitively 
impaired during the course of the study. Note: The PI  or AI will contact the NIH Ability to Consent 
Assessment Team (ACAT) for evaluation as needed  for the following: an independent assessment 
of whether an individual has the capacity to provi de consent; assistance in identifying and 
assessing an appropriate surroga te when indicated; and/or an assessment of the capacity to appoint 
a surrogate. For those subjects that become in capacitated and do not have pre-determined 
substitute decision maker, the procedures describe d in MAS Policy 87-4 and NIH HRPP SOP 14E 
for appointing a surrogate decision maker for adul t subjects who are (a) decisionally impaired, and 
(b) who do not have a legal guardian or durable power of attorney, will be followed.  9.4 E
VALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS  
9.4.1 Benefits 
The potential benefit to a patient who enters study is a reduction in the bulk of his/her tumor, which 
may or may not have a favorable impact on symptoms and/or outcome. 
9.4.2 Risks 
9.4.2.1 Study Agents 
The risks of the study are as described in the various package inserts. 9.4.2.2 Biopsy risks 
All care will be taken to minimize risks that may be incurred by tumor sampling. However, there 
are procedure-related risks (such as bleeding, infe ction and visceral injury) that will be explained 
fully during informed consent. If patients suffer  any physical injury as a result of the biopsies, 
immediate medical treatment is avai lable at the NCI’s Clinical Cent er in Bethesda, MD.  Although 
49 
Abbreviated Title: COXEN study 
Version Date: March 21, 2019 
 
no compensation is available, any injury will be fully evaluated and treated in keeping with the 
benefits or care to which patients are entitled under applicable regulations. 
9.4.2.3 Radiation Risks 
Some biopsies may be performed with CT guidance.  If that is the case, then this research study 
involves exposure to radiation from up to 2 CT scans with a combined effective dose of 1.6 rem and 2 injections of 
18F-FDG of 7 mCi each for 2 FDG-PET MRI scans with a combined effective 
dose of 0.94 rem for a total dose of 2.5 rem.  This is below the guideline of 5.0 rem per year allowed for research subjects by the NIH Radiation Safety Committee. 
9.4.2.4 Non-Physical Risks of Genetic Research 
9.4.2.4.1 Risk of receiving unwanted information 
Anxiety and stress may arise as a result of th e anticipation that unwanted information regarding 
disease related DNA sequencing or disease tendencies, or misattributed paternity. Patients will be 
clearly informed that the data related to DNA sequencing and genetic analysis is coded, 
investigational and will not be shared with pa tients, family members or health care providers. In 
addition, a Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained for the study. 
9.4.2.4.2 Risk related to possibility that information may be released 
This includes the risk that data related to genotype, DNA sequencing or risk for disease tendency 
or trait can be released to members of the public, insurers, employers, or law enforcement agencies. Although there are no plans to release results to  the patients, family members or health care 
providers, this risk will be included in the informed consent document. 
9.4.2.4.3 Risk to family or relatives 
Family members or relatives may or may not want to  be aware of familial tendencies or genetic 
risks of disease which may cause anxiety about possible future health problems.  
9.4.2.5 Other Risks 
Additional risks include the possible occurrence of any of a range of side effects which are listed 
in the Consent Document. Frequent monitoring for adverse effects will help to minimize the risks 
associated with administration of the study agents. 
9.5 R
ISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS  
Although urothelial cancer is a chemosensitive malignancy with response proportions of over 50% 
with conventional cytotoxic regimens, the respons e durations are short and the median survival of 
patients with metastatic disease is approximatel y 14 months. There is no FDA-approved second 
line drug for metastatic urothelial cancer.   
Given the efforts to minimize risk with the administration of these agents , this protocol involves 
greater than minimal risk, but presents the potential  for direct benefit to individual subjects. The 
ongoing risks and benefits of participation for adults who become unable to consent are no 
different than those described for less vulnerable patients.

9.6 CONSENT PROCESS AND DOCUMENTATION  
The principal investigator or a designee will obtain  written informed consent from each subject 
participating in this study after adequate explan ation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, 
and potential hazards of the study. Potential hazards of the selected agent(s) will also be provided 
as an information sheet in conjunction with the consen t as it would be impractical to include all 75 
agents in the consent. Consent for the optional biop sies on this study will be obtained at the time 
of the procedure, using the procedure consent. If the patient refuses the optional biopsy at that 
time, the refusal will be documented in the medical record and in the research record. 
If new safety information results in significant chan ges in the risk/ benefit assessment, the consent 
form will be reviewed and updated as necessary.  All subjects (including those already being 
treated) will be informed of the ne w information, be given a copy of the revised form, and be asked 
to give their consent to continue in the study. It will be documented in the medical record that informed consent has been obtained. 9.6.1 Telephone Re-consent Procedure 
Re-consent on this study may be obtained via telep hone according to the following procedure: the 
informed consent document will be  sent to the subject.  An explanation of the study will be 
provided over the telephone af ter the subject has had the opportuni ty to read the consent form.  
The subject will sign and date the informed consent.  A witness to the subject signature will sign 
and date the consent. The original informed consent document will be mailed back to the 
consenting investigator who will sign and date the consent form with the date the consent was 
obtained via telephone.  A fully executed copy will be returned via mail for the subject’s records.  
The informed consent process will be documen ted on a progress note by the consenting 
investigator. 
10 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION   
For this study, all drugs are commercially available; therefore, Investigator Brochures are not 
applicable to this/these drug(s). Information abou t commercial drugs is publicly available in the 
package insert and other resources. Refer to Appendix B  for the COXEN drug index FDA 
approved dose and schedule. 
All of the agents are not approved for use in urothelial cancer; however, the purpose of the 
investigation is to determine the feasibility of the use of the COXEN algorithm. The study is exempt from IND application because it meets al l of the following requirements: the investigation 
is not intended to support a new indication for use or any other significant changes to labeling; the 
drugs are already approved and marketed and the investigation is not intended to support a 
significant change in advertising; and the invest igation does not involve a route of administration 
or dosage level in use in a patient population or othe r factor that significantly increases the risks 
(or decreases the acceptability of the risks) a ssociated with the use of the drug products.

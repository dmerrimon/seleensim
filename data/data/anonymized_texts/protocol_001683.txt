Study Device:  INL -001 (bupivacaine hydrochloride [HCl] collagen- matrix implant)  
Study Number:  INN-CB-022 
Methodology/Study Design:  This is a multicenter randomized, single -blind, controlled s tudy.  Prior to 
surgery on Day 1, 48 subjects who continue to meet study entry criteria will be randomized just prior to 
surgery in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 3 x 100 mg INL-001 bupivacaine HCl collagen -matrix implants 
(total bupivacaine HCl dose 300 m g) or Marcaine 0.25% (bupivacaine HCl  175 mg ) infiltration.  Subjects 
will then undergo open hernioplasty according to standard procedure.  If the surgeon encounters a significant surgical complication or other clinically significant medical condition duri ng surgery, the test 
article may not be administered at the investigator’s discretion, and the subject will be considered 
randomized but not enrolled or treated.  
Following surgery, subjects will be transferred to a post -anesthesia care unit (PACU) and/or o ther 
postoperative recovery area for observation where they may receive parenteral morphine as needed 
(rescue medication for breakthrough pain).  Once subjects can tolerate oral medication, they will be 
started on a standardized oral analgesic regimen of acetaminophen 650 mg 3 times daily for as long as 
clinically required  and will be prescribed immediate- release morphine (15 mg) to manage breakthrough 
pain only when it occur s.  Subjects will remain in the PACU until they are stable and can be discharged to  
the clinic.   
Subjects will remain housed in the clinic at least until after the 72 hour blood sample has been collected for pharmacokinetic ( PK) analysis on Day 4.  Subjects discharged after the 72 hour blood draw will be 
instructed to return to the clin ic to complete the 96 hour PK blood draw on Day 5.  Follow -up safety 
assessments will include clinic visit s on Day 7, Day 15 and Day 30.  
Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected from subjects before surgery and at predetermined time 
points up to 96 hours after administration of study drug. Safety assessments will include frequent 
assessment of vital signs through 72 hours, continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring for at least 
24 hours, oxygen saturation levels, and adverse events (AEs) reporting  with particular emphasis on the 
signs and symptoms of CNS and cardiovascular bupivacaine toxicity as described in Section 5.12.6.  The 
surgical wound will be assessed frequently for adverse events associated wi th altered or delayed wound 
healing .  
Number of Subjects Planned :  48 subjects  
INL-001 Implant :  Lyophilized bupivacaine HCl collagen -matrix implant (approximately 5 × 5  cm).  
Each implant contains 1 00 mg bupivacaine HCl. 
Bupivacaine HCl Infiltration :  MarcaineTM 0.25% (bupivacaine HCl) 175 mg. 
Duration of Treatment:  INL-001 bupivacaine HCl collagen -matrix implant  and Marcaine TM 0.25% 
(bupivacaine HCl) are single use product s. The INL -001 collagen- matrix implant is bioresorbable and 
does not require r emoval.

randomization number, regardless of whether or not they receive test article.  
Safety Population :  The safety population will consist of all subjects who receive INL -001 bupivacaine 
collagen -matrix implant or Marcaine 0.25%  infiltration. Subjects will be analyzed according to the 
treatment they actually receive.  
Pharmacokine tic Population :  The PK population will consist of all subjects who receive INL -001 
bupivacaine collagen -matrix implant or Marcaine 0.25%  infiltration and have at least 1 post - 
implantation/infiltration blood sample obtained.  Subjects will be analyzed acc ording to the treatment they 
actually receive.  
Per Protocol Pharmacokinetic Population :  The PK population will consist of all subjects in the 
pharmacokinetic population who have no major PK -related protocol deviations, and have sufficient data 
to calculate the Cmax, AUC0 -∞, and AUC0- tlast for INL-001 or Marcaine .  Subjects will be analyzed 
according to the actual treatment they receive.  
Efficacy Population :  Efficacy was not assessed in this study.   
Safety:  Safety variables include assessment of AEs, ser ious adverse events (SAEs), bupivacaine toxicity 
AEs, wound healing AEs, oxygen saturation levels, ECG data , vital signs , and baseline clinical laboratory 
parameters.  These analyses will be conducted on the safety population.     
Safety Analyses :  The Med ical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA Version 18) will be used

to classify all AEs with respect to system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  A treatment -
emergent adverse event (TEAE) will be defined as any AE that occurred after implantation/infiltration.  
The number and percentage of subjects with AEs will be displayed for each treatment group by system 
organ class (SOC) and preferred term.  Summaries in terms of severity and relationship to treatment will 
also be provided.  Serious AEs will be summarized separately in a similar fashion.  In the case of multiple 
occurrences of the same AE within the same subject , each subject  will be counted only once for each SOC 
and preferred term.  All AEs and SAEs will be listed by subjec t.  An assessment of the occurrence of AEs 
with respect to bupivacaine plasma concentrations will be performed.  
Oxygen saturation levels will be summarized descriptively  (sample size, mean, SD, CV, median, 
minimum, and maximum) . 
ECG data including: RR, PR , QRS, and QTc intervals will be summarized descriptively.  
Vital signs and any other appropriate quantitative safety data will be presented descriptively by treatment 
group at each time point for the baseline and post -baseline evaluations, as well as chan ge from baseline, 
using descriptive statistics (sample size, mean, SD, CV, median, minimum, and maximum).  
Pharmacokinetics:  Individual plasma concentrations of bupivacaine will be  tabulated for each scheduled 
sampling time and summarized descriptively usi ng the arithmetic mean, associated standard deviation 
(SD) coefficient of variances (CV %), geometric mean, median, minimum and maximum. All 
concentrations below the lower limit of quantification (LOQ) will be set to zero for the purpose of 
calculating des criptive statistics.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters of bupivacaine will be listed for each subject. A descriptive summary for 
each parameter will include arithmetic mean, SD, CV (%), geometric mean, median, minimum and 
maximum (refer to Section 8.2.2 for details) .

 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Postsurgical Pain  
Posts urgical pain is a form of acute pain from surgical trauma that causes an inflammatory 
reaction and initiation of an afferent neuronal barrage  (Gupta et al., 2010) . Pain after surgery is a 
combined constellation of unpleasant sensory, emotional and mental e xperiences precipitated by 
the surgical trauma and associated with autonomic, endocrine -metabolic, physiological and 
behavioral responses  (Gupta et al., 2010) .  Tissue trauma stimulates hypersensitivity of the 
central nervous system, resulting in pain within the immediate surgical field and in other areas 
directly affected by the surgical procedure (eg, the incision site).  
Evidence suggests that surgery suppresses the immune system and that this suppression is 
proportionate to the invasiveness of the surge ry (Ramsey, 2000 ). Effective postsurgical analgesia 
can reduce this deleterious effect and is an essential component in the care of the surgical patient. 
Inadequate pain control, apart from being inhumane, can result in increased patient morbidity or 
morta lity (Gupta et al., 2010) .    
Optimal management of postsurgical pain requires an understanding of the pathophysiology of 
pain, the methods available to reduce pain, the invasiveness of the surgical procedure, and 
inherent patient factors, such as anxiety and depression, which are often associated with increased pain  (Lovich -Sapola et al., 2015) . Postsurgical pain management must be an integral 
part of perioperative care and should be based on sound physiologic and pharmacologic principles  (Jain and Datta, 1997) .  
From 1992 to 2012, the total number of surgeries at community hospitals in the United States 
(US) increased by 17 percent to about 26.8 million surgeries  (Surgeries in Hospital -Owned 
Outpatient Facilities, 2012 ),
 and approximately 1 million hernia repair surgeries are performed 
each year in the US  (Co-Factor analysis, 2016) . Although significant improvement has been made 
in the treatment of postsurgical pain, surveys still show that many patients still receive inadequate postsurgical analgesia  (Rawal, 2001) .
   Inadequate pain management can lead to 
poorer outcomes in the immediate postsurgical period and can also result in increased risk for 
chronic postsurgical pain (ie, pain that lasts beyond the typical healing period of 1 to 2 months). 
Chronic postsurgical pain is now recognized as a significant issue after surgery and may occur in 
over 30% of patients after some operations, particularly amputations, thoracotomy, mastectomy, 
and inguinal hernia repairs  (Lovich- Sapola et al., 2015) .  
The standard pillar of postoperative treatment of moderate to severe pain has been the use of 
opioids. However, adverse reactions related to opioids including constipation, nausea, vomiting, 
respiratory depression, and addiction make their use unfavorable  (Ramsey, 2000;  Jain and Datta, 
1997) . There are data that suggest opioids should be avoided when not needed, because 
perioperative opioid therapy may be associated with an increased likelihood of long -term opioid 
use, with its attendant risks  (Chou et al., 2016) .  
Acute postoperative pain and its treatment with opioids raise important concerns for the millions 
of patients who undergo major surgery every year  (Clarke et al., 2014 ).  A retrospective analysis 
Protocol INN -CB-022 
17 May 2017  
Page 15 of 53  
 of 39,140 opioid- naïve patients who underwent major surgery found that almost 50% of these 
patients were discharged from the hospital with an opioid prescription, and that 1 in 30 of these 
patients continued to take opioids for more than 3 months  (Clarke et al., 2014) .  Similarly, in 
391,139 opioid- naïve patients who underwent short -stay surgery, 7.1% were newly prescribed 
opioids within 7 days of hospital discharge and 7.7% were prescribed opioids at 1 year after surgery.  During this time period, oxycodone use increased from 5.4% within 7 days of surgery to 15.9% at 1 year (Alam et al., 2012) .  
The use of procedure -specific, multimodal perioperative pain management provides the basis for 
enhanced postsurgical pain control, optimization of analgesia  while decreasing the requirement 
for opioids , decrease in adverse effect s, and improved patient satisfaction ( Lovich -Sapola et al, 
2015) .  Preventive  analgesia plays an important role in postsurgical pain management  (Vadivelu 
et al., 2014),  and av ailable data indicate that afferent neural blockade with local anesthetics, such 
as bupivacaine, is the most effective analgesic technique ( Ramsey, 2000) .
    
Bupivacaine, introduced in 1963, is a widely used amide local anesthetic with a prolonged duration of action. Amides are relatively stable in solution and are slowly metabolized b y hepatic 
amidases. Bupivacaine is therefore typified by a rapid onset and longer duration of action. Bupivacaine affects sensory nerves more than motor nerves and can also be used to provide several days of effective analgesia without motor blockade. Bupi vacaine is approved for use in 
the United States and Europe as a local anesthetic (Section 1.2.1) .  
The advantages of effective pain management during and after surgery include patient comfort 
and satisfaction, earlier mobilization, fewer pulmonary and cardiac complications, a reduced risk 
of deep vein thrombosis, faster recovery with less likelihood of the development of neuropathic 
pain, and reduced cost of care  (Ramsey, 2000) .
  
Local placement of the INL -001 c ollagen matrix implant at multiple layers within the soft tissue 
layers during surgery offers a novel way to deliver bupivacaine HCl directly to the surgical site to produce effective postsurgical analgesia  for the reduction of postsurgical pain and the 
requirement for opioid analgesics .
 
1.2. INL-001 Bupivacaine HCl Collagen -Matrix Implant  
INL-001 ( also known as XARACOLL®) , is a sterile, resorbable and biodegradable Type  1 
purified bovine collagen matrix implant comprised of 75 mg of Type  1 collagen purified from 
bovine Achilles tendons.   
Each implant contains 100 mg bupivacaine HCl (equivalent to 88.8 mg of bupivacaine) that is 
homogeneously dispersed ( Summary Report RPD -SYN136 ) in an approximately 5 x 5 cm matrix 
of 5 mm thickness.  Because bupivacaine HCl is homogeneously dispersed within the matrix, it 
can be cut before placement into t he surgical site using sterile technique.  INL-001 is a drug  
(bupivacaine HCl) -device (Type I collagen) combination  product . 
1.2.1. Bupivacaine HCl   
Bupivacaine, an amide local anest hetic with a prolonged duration of action, was introduced in 
the United States in 1963, and is currently indicated for the production of local anesthesia by 
percutaneous infiltration, peripheral nerve block, and central neural block (caudal or epidural).  It 
Protocol INN -CB-022 
17 May 2017  
Page 16 of 53  
 is also indicated for pain relief because sensory nerve block is more marked than motor block.  
Its long duration of action and its tendency to provide more sensory than motor block have made it a popular drug for providing prolonged analgesia during labor or during the postoperative 
period.  Amides are relatively stable in solution and are slowly metabolized by hepatic amidases.  
Bupivacaine is therefore typified by a rapid onset and long duration of action.   
Adverse reactions to bupivacaine are characteristic of those associated with other amide -type 
local anesthetics.  A major cause of adverse reactions to this group of drugs is excessive plasma 
concentrations, which may be due to overdosage, slow metabolic degradation or unintentional intravascular i njection.  Toxicity related to bupivacaine is characterized by numbness of the 
tongue, light-headedness, dizziness and tremors, potentially followed by convulsions and cardiovascular disorders.  
 
From the published literature, it can be concluded that signs of central nervous system toxicity 
are usually evident before the appearance of cardiovascular toxicity with central nervous system 
and cardiovascular toxicities generally not seen until bupivacaine levels are ≥2000 ng/mL and ≥4000 ng/mL, respectively  (Scott, 1975; Tucker and Mather, 1979) .
  
1.2.2. Type I Collagen 
Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body and is used as a naturally safe and effective biomaterial in a wide variety of medical devices and delivery systems for bioactive agents  (Ramshaw  et al., 2001; Lee et al, 2001) .  Collagen implants are enzymatically degraded 
into constituent amino acids, with most reutilized for protein synthesis and the remainder excreted as urea ( Bailey, 2000).  
Collagen products have been approved as devices in the US and other parts of the world to aid in 
the management of wound healing, for cosmetic reconstruction and as absorbable hemostatic 
agents. The histological and biochemical fate of implanted collagen have been well studied. The collagen matrix is biocompatible, and collagen implants show minimal inflammatory and 
immunogenic responses  (Cooperman and Michaeli, 1985; Delustro et al., 1987; DeLustro et al., 
1986) and are progressively degraded and replaced in the wound with native collagen ( Anselme 
et al., 1 990).  
The INL -001 collagen implant utilizes a proprietary collagen matrix technology known as 
COLLARX ®.  The COLLARX technology uses purified bovine-derived coll agen for the 
manufacture of INL -001. The INL-001 collagen is extracted from bovine Achilles te ndons, 
obtained exclusively from New Zealand closed herds that have been certified as transmissible 
spongiform e ncephalopathy (TSE) free and negligible for the risk of bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy ( BSE) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 999/2001.   
In the INL -001 56- day nonclinical toxicology study in rats (WIL134502) utilizing drug product 
made for Phase 2 material , the INL-001 collagen matrix was present at the incision site in all 
INL-001 animals at the Day 3 necropsy and in most animals at the Day 14 necropsy.  These 
findings were confirmed microscopically.  During the Day 28 necropsy, none of the INL-001 matrix was noted grossly or microscopically in any animal implanted with INL -001.  There was 
no evidence of the matrix in the remaining INL-001 animals during necropsy on Day 56.  These 
Protocol INN -CB-022 
17 May 2017  
Page 17 of 53  
 findings suggest that complete resorption of the collagen matrix occurs between 14 and 28 days 
after implantation.    
The very low potential for an antigenic response from Type 1 collagen is due to the almost 
identical amino acid sequencing between animal Type 1 collagen (eg, bovine) and human 
collagen and to the positioning of antigenic determinates outside of the triple helix ( Serano, 
1992) . Because nearly all current collagen -containing implants are composed of Type 1 collagen, 
collagen -induced autoimmunity is not generally considered a potential concern.  
Adverse reactions reported for collagen products that have been used for hemostasis include 
hematoma, potentiation of infection, wound dehiscence, inflammation and edema.  Across the 10 
Phase 1/2/3 INL-001 clinical studies, there was no increased incidence of wound infection or 
wound dehiscence after placement of up to 4 collagen matrices at multiple layers within the surgical site . 
1.3. Findings From the INL -001 Clinical Program 
1.3.1. Pharmacokinetics of INL -001 in Adults 
The rate and extent of systemic bupivacaine absorption is dependent upon the total dose and concentration administered, the route of administration, and the vascularity of the administration site.   
Following implantation of INL -001 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg in different surgical 
models, there was a rapid rise in observed plasma bupivacaine concentrations with quantifiable 
concentrations observed in all subjects at the first time point (0.5 hours) after implantation .  
Bupivacaine HCl concentrations increased approximately proportionally with increasing doses of INL-001  
Results from the adult pharmacokinetic study (Leiman et al., 2016) that investigated the 
pharma cokinetics, relative bioavailability and safety of INL -001 200 mg and INL-001 300 mg 
compared to infiltration of bupivacaine HCl 150 mg with epinephrine after open hernioplasty (INN-CB-013) using drug product material for Phase 2 studies showed that: 
• Mean bupivacaine plasma concentrations were higher in the INL- 001 300 mg group 
compared with the INL-001 200 mg and bupivacaine HCl 150 mg with epinephrine 
infiltration group throughout the 96-hour observation period.  Mean bupivacaine plasma 
concentrations in the INL -001 300 mg group peaked 3 hours after implantation of the 
matrices.   
• Areas under the plasma concentration time curve were dose proportional for INL-001 200 
mg and INL-001 300 mg groups relative to the bupivacaine HCL 150 mg with epinephrine infiltrate group.   
• The relative maximum concentrations (Cmax) for INL -001 200 mg and INL-001 300 mg 
were approximately 80% of the Cmax for the bupivacaine HCl 150 mg with epinephrine infiltrate.  The mean terminal half -life (t1/2) of the INL -001 200 mg and INL -001 300 mg 
were 17 hour and 18 hours, respectively, compared with 9 hours for the bupivacaine HCl 150 mg with epinephrine infiltrate.   
Protocol INN -CB-022 
17 May 2017  
Page 18 of 53  
 No subject who received INL -001 300 mg showed any signs or symptoms of systemic 
bupivacaine toxicity.  The highest plasm a concentration (777 ng/mL) after implantation of 3 
INL-001 matrices (bupivacaine 300 mg) was well below the threshold concentration (ie, ≥2000 
ng/mL) that has been associated with signs and symptoms of bupivacaine central nervous system 
(CNS) toxicity.   
1.3.2. Phase 3 Clinical Studies in Adults  
1.3.2.1. Efficacy  
To demonstrate the efficacy of INL -001 for postsurgical analgesia, the sponsor examined the 
data from 2 identical, large, well- controlled, Phase 3 studies that were conducted in the United 
States  (INN-CB-014 and INN-CB-016).  
Findings from the 2 identical multicenter, double -blind, placebo- controlled Phase 3 studies 
independently demonstrate the effectiveness of locally placed INL -001 in reducing both pain 
intensity and the need for opioid rescue medication after surgery and together demonstrate the reproducibility of the treatment effects.   
The INL -001 treatment response was comparable and consistent across both pivotal studies.  In 
each study, subjects treated with INL -001 had statistically significantly less pain from Time 0  
through the first 24 hours compared with subjects treated with placebo (SPI24; p≤0.0004; 
primary endpoint) .  The treatment effect of INL -001 was observed within the first hour after 
local placement of the matrices into the surgical site.  That is, subjects who received INL -001 
had statistically significantly less pain within the first hour after local placement of study drug compared with subjects who received placebo (p<0.0001).  These reductions in pain intensity were coupled  with less total opioid analg esic medication usage in the INL -001 treatment group 
compared with the placebo group.  A noteworthy finding is that approximately one -third of 
INL-001 subjects did not require any opioid medication throughout the 72 -hour postoperative 
period compared with 17%  of subjects who received placebo.    
Subjects in the INL -001 group combined used statistically significantly (p≤0.0004) less opioid 
rescue medication and had statistically significantly (p=0.0007) less opioid- related TEAEs (ie, 
nausea, vomiting, and co nstipation) over the post implantation period compared to subjects in the 
placebo group.  This statistically significant reduction in opioid- related TEAEs after treatment 
with INL -001 is a clinically meaningful finding.  
1.3.2.2. Safety  
Safety findings from 2 identi cal Phase 3 studies demonstrated the safety of INL -001 300 mg for 
postsurgical analgesia.  The most commonly reported treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) were characteristic of those associated with general anesthesia, the surgical procedure, 
and/or rescue opioid analgesia use.  Most TEAEs were not considered related to the study drug.   
One death from an acute myocardial infarction occurred in the placebo group.  This death was not considered related to study drug  and was the only death that occurred across the entire INL -
001 clinical program .  None of the 404 subjects who received INL -001 300 mg had a serious 
adverse event that was  considered related to study drug.  Among the 404 subjects who received 
INL-001 300 mg, none presented with a constellati on of symptoms that was indicative of 
Protocol INN -CB-022 
17 May 2017  
Page 19 of 53  
 bupivacaine systemic toxicity.  No subject who received INL -001 300 mg experienced 
bradycardia or other cardiac events related to INL -001.  No clinically meaningful effects of INL -
001 on vital sign parameters were obser ved. 
Most reports of incision site swelling and incision site pain were mild or moderate, and none 
were attributed to the study drug.  All TEAEs related to wound healing were typical of events associated with the hernia surgical procedure under study.   Across the Phase 1/2/3 studies, 2.9% 
(17/578) subjects in the INL -001 group and 2.5% 7/280) subjects in the placebo group had 
wound dehiscence and/or wound infection events.  None of these events were deemed related to study drug .       
In a review of  1440 p atients with a primary unilateral inguinal or femoral hernia repair who 
responded to a questionnaire about postoperative complications, infection was reported by 7.4%  
(105/1414) of patients and wound rupture was reported by 4.1% (49/1431) ( Fränneby, 2008) .  
Another systematic review of open inguinal hernia repair found rates of infection ranging from 3% to 5%  (Sanchez -Manuel , 2003) .   Among the 578 subjects who received INL -001 in the 
Phase 1/2/3 studies , there were no safety signals suggestive of systemic or local tissue toxicity.   
Subjects in the INL -001 300 mg group used statistically significantly less opioid rescue 
medications, which correlated with statistically significantly (p=0.0004) less opioid- related 
TEAEs over the post implantation period compa red to subjects in the placebo group.  This 
statistically significant reduction in opioid -related TEAEs is considered a clinically meaningful 
finding.  
Unlike other currently marketed local anesthetics, which are injected directly into the soft tissue, 
the INL-001 collagen matrix is placed at multiple layers in the soft tissue (eg, between the fascia, 
muscle, and skin) during the surgical procedure.  Because INL -001 is implanted into the surgical 
site, unintended intravascular injection that often leads to t he drug’s most serious potential 
central nervous system and cardiovascular systemic toxicities is prevented.  Placement of the 
INL-001 collagen matrix directly into the surgical site makes INL -001 a safe and effective way 
to deliver bupivacaine HCl locally  to the surgical site to provide postsurgical analgesia.  
The purpose of this additional  pharmacokinetic study is to further char acterize  the 
pharmacokinetics of the  INL-001 to -be-marketed formulation relative to  the reference listed drug 
(Marcaine
TM 0.25%)  and to collect additional INL -001 safety data , with particular emphasis on 
signs and symptoms of bupivacaine toxicity .

 2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective s of this study are to estimate the: 
• Pharmacokinetic profile of the INL-001 bupivacaine HCl collagen -matrix implant 300 
mg during and after open hernioplasty.  
• Relative bioavailability of the INL-001 bupivacaine HCl collagen -matrix implant 
compared to Marcaine ™ 0.25%  infiltration.  
The secondary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerab ility of the INL -001 
bupivacaine HCl collagen- matrix implant after placement in the surgical site during open 
hernioplasty, with particular emphasis on signs and symptoms of bupivacaine toxicity .   
The study objectives of this s tudy are  similar to those fr om the previous adult pharmacokinetic 
study (INN -CB-013).  This study however will utilize clinical trial material manufactured 
identically to that used in the Phase 3 studies.

 3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan Description  
This is a multic enter randomized, single -blind, controlled study.  Prior to surgery on Day 1, 48 
subjects who continue to meet study entry criteria will be randomized just prior to surgery in a 
2:1 ratio to receive either 3 x 100 mg INL-001 bupivacaine HCl collagen- matrix implants (total 
bupivacaine HCl dose 300 mg) or Marcaine 0.25% (bupivacaine HCl ) 175 mg  infiltration.  
Subjects will then undergo open hernioplasty according to standard procedure.  If the surgeon encounters a significant surgical complication or other c linically significant medical condition 
during surgery, the test article may not be administered at the investigator’s discretion, and the subject will be considered randomized but not enrolled or treated.  
Following surgery, subjects will be transferred to a post -anesthesia care unit (PACU) and/or 
other postoperative recovery area for observation where they may receive parenteral morphine as 
needed (rescue medication for breakthrough pain).  Once subjects can tolerate oral medication, 
they will be started o n a standardized oral analgesic regimen of acetaminophen 650 mg 3 times 
daily and will be prescribed immediate -release morphine (15 mg) to manage breakthrough pain 
only when it occur s.  Subjects will remain in the PACU until they are stable and can be 
discharged to the clinic.   
Subjects will remain housed in the clinic at least until after the 72 hour blood sample has been 
collected for PK analysis  on Day 4.  Subjects discharged after the 72 hour blood draw will be 
instructed to return to the clinic to com plete the 96 hour PK blood draw  on Day 5.  Follow -up 
safety assessments will include clinic visits on Day 7, Day 15 and Day 30.  
Pharmacokinetic blood samples will b e collected from subjects before surgery and at 
predetermined time points up to 96 hours aft er administration of study drug. Safety assessments 
will include frequent assessment of vital signs through 72 hours, continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring for at least 24 hours, oxygen saturation levels, and adverse event s (AE s) 
reporting with par ticular emphasis on the signs and symptoms of CNS and cardiovascular 
bupivacaine toxicity as described in Section 5.12.6.  The surgical wound will be assessed 
frequently for adverse events associated with altered wound healing .

Page 36 of 53  
 when the first INL -001 bupivacaine HCl collagen -matrix is implanted or the time of the 
Marcaine 0.25%  injection.   Approximately 70 mL of blood will be drawn from each subject  for 
the PK analysis . 
Detailed procedures for collection, handling and storage of collected pharmacokinetic samples 
are provided in the PK lab manual . 
5.14. Efficacy Assessments  
Efficacy of INL -001 will not be assessed during this study.  
5.15. End of Study  
The end of study is whe n the last subject completes the Day 30  end of study  visit.   
5.16. Discussion and Justification of Study Design  
This study is designed to compare the pharmacokinetics of INL -001 to the reference drug, 
Marcaine 0.25% .  This study will also evaluate the safety o f INL -001, particularly with respect to 
any potential cardiac and  neurological effects  of INL -001 in subjects undergoing hernioplasty.   
Both components of the INL -001 implant (collagen and bupivacaine) have been in clinical use 
worldwide for several decad es. The INL-001 implant is a Type  I collagen matrix (25 cm2) with 
homogeneously dispersed bupivacaine HCl 100 mg that is being developed for postoperative 
analgesia. It has been demonstrated that INL -001 provide s subjects with  pain relief at the 
surgical s ite without the adverse effects from elevated systemic bupivacaine levels that have 
been associated with local nerve block or incisional infiltration.  
The purpose of this  additional  pharmacokinetic study is to further characterize the 
pharmacokinetics of the INL -001 to- be-marketed formulation relative to the reference listed drug  
(Marcaine 0.25%) and to collect additional INL -001 safety data , with particular emphasis on 
signs and symptoms of bupivacaine toxicity . 
5.17. Appropriateness of Measures  
Standard statis tical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study.   
6. ADVERSE EVENTS  
Throughout the study, the investigator will monitor each subject for evidence of investigational 
drug intolerance and for the development of clinical and/or laborat ory evidence of an AE.  An 
AE assessment will be made by the investigator on a routine basis throughout the study.   
All AEs that occur during the course of the study must be reported in detail on the subject’s chart 
(source document), appropriate e CRFs, a nd on any other report form required by national law.

An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation 
subject administered a n investigational drug and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the drug .  An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a n investigational drug , whether or not the event is cons idered causally related to the use 
of the drug .  Such an event can result from use of the investigational drug  as stipulated in the 
protocol or labeling  of the investigational drug.   Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or 
illness is considered an AE.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered 
to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical 
intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them to be clinically significant AEs.  
A treatment -emergent AE is defined as any AE with onset or worsening reported by a subject 
from the time the investigational drug is implanted  until completion of or discharge from the 
study (see Section 4.3 fo r details regarding premature discontinuation).  
6.1.2. Serious Adverse Event  
Any AE that results in 1 or more of the following is considered a serious adverse event (SAE):  
1. Death - Includes death of a fetus due to miscarriage/spontaneous abortion and elective 
abortion in the subject . 
2. Life Threatening Situation -  The subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
event.  It does not refer to the hypothetical risk of death if the AE was more severe or was 
to progress.  
3. Inpatient  Hospitalization - This inclu des any new hospital admission during the study or 
prolongation of an existing hospitalization.  The following are not considered serious due to inpatient hospitalization: 
a. Trips to the ER that do not include a hospital admission  
b. Optional admission not associated with a precipitating medical AE (eg, cosmetic 
surgery)  
c. Admission for treatment of a pre -existing condition that has not worsened or had 
an increase in severity or frequency (eg, cataract surgery)  
d. Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures noted i n the baseline source 
documentation 
4. Persistent or Significant Disability/Incapacity -  Any AE having an outcome that is 
associated with a substantial disruption of the ability to carry out normal life functions.  This includes the inability to work.  This is not intended to include transient, interruptions of daily activities.  
5. Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect in a child of the subject . 
6. Other Medically Important Events -  Important medical events that may not result in 
death, be life -threatening, or require hos pitalization may be considered a serious adverse 
Protocol INN -CB-022

Page 38 of 53  
 event when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and/or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 1 through 5 above. 
If any serious, life-threatening, or fatal adverse event occurs whether related to 
investigational drug or not, the investigator must notify Innocoll Pharmaceuticals  within 24 
hours by entry into the eCRF as an SAE and/or telephone, facsimile, email (see Section 
6.5). 
6.2. Adverse Event Severity  
The severity of the adverse event will be graded using the following definitions: 
• Mild - The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.  
• Moderate - The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's 
usual activities.  
• Severe - The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual 
activities and may be incapacitating or life -threatening. 
6.3. Relationship to Investigational Drug 
The investigator must record t he causal relationship of each adverse event in the eCRF, and on 
the serious adverse reporting form (if applicable).  An investigator's causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to an adverse event.  
• Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event.  
• Not related: An adverse event is due to underlying or concurrent illness or effect of 
another drug or event and is not related to the study drug (eg, has a more likely alternate etiology and / or a temporal relationship does not suggest a causal relationship).  
6.4. Adverse Event Collection Period  
All (serious and non-serious) adverse events, whether elicited during study visits or spontaneously reported by the subject, that occur from the time the subject signs the study-specific informed consent form until completion of or discharge from the study will be collected. 
Any AE will be followed to a satisfactory resolution until it becomes stable or until it can be 
explained by another known cause (ie, concurrent condition or medication) or, in the opinion of 
the investigator, further evaluation is not warranted.  All findings relevant to the final outcome of 
an AE will be reported in the subject’s medical record.   
6.5. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
In the event of an SAE, whether related to the investigational drug  or not, the investigator will 
notify Innocoll Pharmaceuticals  within 24 hours of being made aware of the SAE:

All serious adverse events that the investigator considers related to study drug 
occurring after the study closes must be reported to the s ponsor.  
6.6. Sponsor Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities  
Adverse event reporting, including reporting of suspected unexpected serious adverse drug 
reactions (SUSARs), will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations. 
6.7. Exposure During Pregnancy  
An exposure during pregnancy (also referred to as exposure in- utero [EIU]) occurs if:  
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been directly exposed to the investigational drug  (maternal exposure).  
2. A male has been exposed, either due to treatment or environmental, to the investigational drug prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy (paternal exposure). 
If any study subject is found to be pregnant during the study the investigator must submit EIU information to Innocoll Pharmaceuticals  within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy, 
irrespective of whether an adverse event has occurred.  
Follow-up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all Exposure in Utero reports with an unknown outcome. Innocoll Pharmaceuticals  will follow the pregnancy until 
complet ion or until pregnancy termination (eg, induced abortion).

8.1.4. Efficacy Variables  
 Efficacy was not assessed in this study.  
8.2. Statistical Methodology 
8.2.1.  Safety Analyses  
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA Version  18) will be used to classify 
all AEs with respect to system organ class ( SOC) and preferred term  (PT).  A treatment -
emergent adverse event (TEAE) will be  defined as any AE that occurred after 
implantation /infiltration . 
An overview of AEs will be  provided that summarize s subject incidence of all TEAEs, serious 
TEAEs, test article -related TEAEs, test article -related serious TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of treatment (ie, removal of the test article ).   
The number and percentage of subjects that experienced 1 or more TEAEs, serious TEAEs, 
TEAEs related to test article , or TEAEs leading to discontinuation of treatment will be  
summarized for by SOC, PT, age group, and treatment group.  
Summaries will be  provided by maximum severity for the number and percentage of subjects 
with TEAEs and for subjects with test article -related TEAEs by system organ class, preferred 
term, age group, and treatment group.  
Special AEs, including AEs related to bupivacaine toxicity and AEs related to wound healing, 
will be  summarized by age and treatment  group.  
Descriptive statistics will be pre sented by age and treatment group for each vital sign parameter 
for the actual and change from prior to surgery on Day 1 to each follow -up visit. Oxygen 
saturation levels will be listed and summarized.  C linical laboratory test findings and ECG data 
will b e listed by age group for each subject.

 8.2.2. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Individual plasma concentrations of bupivacaine will be tabulated for each scheduled 
sampling time and summarized descriptively using the arithmetic mean, associated standard deviation (SD) c oefficient of variances (CV %), geometric mean, median, minimum and 
maximum. All concentrations below the lower limit of quan tification  (LOQ) will be set to 
zero for the purpose of calculating descriptive statistics. 
Individual plasma concentration- time pr ofiles of bupivacaine will be plotted both on a semi -
logarithmic and a linear scale. The mean plasma concentration -time profile and SD will also be 
presented graphically.  
Actual blood sampling times for bupivacaine will be converted to a time from Time 0 
(elapsed time). Individual elapsed times will be used in the PK analysis.  
Pharm acokinetic parameters of bupivacaine will be listed for each subject. A descriptive 
summary for each parameter will include arithmetic mean, SD, CV (%), geometric mean, 
median, m inimum and maximum.  
Data permitting, the tlag , Cmax , Tmax , t1/2z , λz, AUC0 -last,  and AUC0-∞  will be assessed.  
The Cmax  and Tmax  will be obtained directly from the concentration- time data.  Where there 
are multiple identical maximum concentrations in a single profile, the Cmax  value  is defined 
as the first temporal occurr ence. The tlag  will be taken as the time of occurrence of the first 
quantifiable plasma bupivacaine  concentration.  
AUC0 -last will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule from predose to the last 
quantifiable plasma concentration. 
AUC0 -∞ will be calculated according to the following equation:  
Where Clast  is the last quantifiable concentration.  
For the purpose of calculating AUC 0-last, when 2 consecutive plasma concentrations below  
the LOQ are encountered after T max, all subsequent values will be exc luded from the 
analysis. When embedded missing values occur, they will be excluded from the analysis.  
Quantifiable concentrations at predose, if any will be set to zero.  
The proportion of AUC0 -∞ due to extrapolation (AUCextr) will also be calculated, expressed 
as a percentage.  
The terminal phase rate constant ( λz) will be estimated by linear regression on the terminal 
phase of the log concentration -time profile. The number of data points include d in the 
regression will be determined by visual inspection. A minimum of 3 data points in the 
terminal phase, excluding Cmax will be required to estimate λ z. 
The t1/2z will be calculated as:

Page 44 of 53  
 The relative bioavailability (AUC0 -last, AUC0 -∞ and Cmax) of th e INL-001 bupivacaine 
collagen -matrix implant (300 mg) will be calculated with respect to the Marcaine 0.25% 
(175 mg ) infiltration using an ANOVA model with  a term for treatment. The analysis of 
variance ( ANOVA)  model will be run on the dose -normalized nat ural log  transformed  values. 
The least squares means and the standard error values from the analyses will  be used to 
construct the 90% confidence intervals for the relative bioavailability evaluations.   The 
relative bioavailability will be calculated as:  
 
Test=INL -001; standard=Marcaine 0.25%  
These analyses will be performed on the Per Protocol PK Population.  
8.2.3. Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy will not be not assessed in this study.  
8.2.4. Sample Size  
No formal sample size calculations were performed for this study. Howe ver, it is expected  that 
48 subjects (32 in the INL -001 group and 16 in the Marcaine group) will be sufficient to evaluate 
PK, estimate relative bioavailability, and adequately assess safety with respect to bu pivacaine 
plasma concentrations .

Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol amendments, the 
Investigator’s Brochure, the informed consent, and all other forms of subject information related 
to the study (eg, advertisements used to recruit subjects) and any other necessary documents be 
reviewed by an Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB).  IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information and/or adve rtising, 
as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of investigational drug shipment to a study site.  Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/IRB approval prior to implementation of any changes made to the study design.   
9.2. Ethical Con duct of the Study  
The study will be conducted in accordance with GCP guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki (http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/
).  At appropriate inte rvals, the clinical 
monitor will visit the site during the clinical study and assure that the investigator's obligations are being fulfilled.   
Trial documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated- marketing 
applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product.  For Phase 4 studies in countries in the ICH regions and for countries not in ICH Regions, trial documents should be retained for the length 
of time local GCP guidelines or law require.  If there are no local laws, the site should retain the 
file for 5 years after completion of the study.  Records include the Confidential Follow-up Forms and other documents such as informed consents, lab reports and other source documents, drug  
accountability forms, Ethics Committee approvals, protocols, and e CRFs.   
9.3. Subject Information and Consent  
 For al l investigators participating in the study, the study protocol and consent form must be 
approved by the investigator's Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee and a copy of the approved consent form must be supplied to Innocoll Pharmaceutic als.  The subject 
will be asked to read the consent form or have the form read to him/her.  If the subject decides to participate in the study, the subject will be asked to sign and date the form as evidence of consent.  Each subject must voluntarily sign and date a consent form before participating in this 
study.  It is the obligation of the investigator or his representative to explain the nature of the 
study to the subject.  The investigator must document in the subject's medical chart that the subject h as signed a consent form to participate in an investigational trial, a copy of the signed 
and dated consent form should be given to the subject or his/her representative, and the original should be retained with the subject's study records. The subjects ma y withdraw consent at any 
time throughout the course of the trial.  The rights and welfare of the subjects will be protected 
by emphasizing to them that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if 
they decline to participate in the study.

For investigators in the United States, the privacy protection of individually identifiable health information (Protected Health Information [PHI]) became a requirement under the Privacy Rules 
of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) effective April 14, 2003.  
Protected Health Information (eg, results of tests, exams and medical records etc.) generated 
during clinical studies may be communicated amongst several parties in generating final study 
reports.  Accordingly, prior to a subject participating in a clinical study he must authorize the use 
and disclosure of his PHI by signing an authorization form. 
PHI authorization must be approved by the investigator's Institutional Review Board or Privacy 
Board and a copy of the authorization form must be supplied to Innocol l Pharmaceuticals .  The 
subject will be asked to read the PHI authorization form or have the forms read to him/her.  If the 
subject decides to participate in the study, the subject will be asked to sign and date the form as 
evidence of consent.  Each subject must voluntarily sign and date a PHI authorization before 
participating in this study.  A designated and legally authorized representative may also sign and date the PHI authorization when necessary.  The investigator will document in the subject's 
medi cal chart that the subject has signed a PHI authorization form to participate in an 
investigational trial, a copy of the PHI authorization, if not contained in the informed consent, 
will be given to the subject or his representative, and the original will be retained with the subject's study records.

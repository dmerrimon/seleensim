 Title:   Comparison of Vibrating Mesh Nebulizer versus Jet Nebulizer in the Pediatric Asthma Patient a 
Randomized Controlled Trial 
 
Principal Investigator: Gerald Moody RRT-NPS, Clinical Research Coordinator – Respirato ry Care Department, Children’s 
Medical Center - Dallas  
 
1. Introduction and Purpose:  The purpose of this study is to compare clinical outcomes relat ed to our current practice of using a jet 
nebulizer (JN) with aerosol mask (AM) or mouthpiece (MP) versus  a vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN) 
with a valved-mask (VM) or MP in the treatment of acute moderat e to severe asthma in Children’s 
Medical Center Dallas Emergen cy Department (CMCED). We hypothes ize that using the combination 
of a VMN and VM or MP will result in fewer hospital admissions,  treatments and length of stay in 
CMCED when compared to our current practice of using a JN and A M or MP.  
 2. Background: 
 
Inhaled β-agonists are the treatment of choice for patients pre senting in the emergency department 
for acute asthma exacerbation[1-4]. There are different types o f aerosol delivery devices and patient 
interfaces available to administer therapy. JN’s and metered do se inhalers (MDI) are commonly used 
as the main aerosol delivery device in treatment of acute asthm a in pediatric patients. A mouthpiece 
or mask may be used as a patient interface for either device. I nterface selection is usually based on 
patient size, age, compliance, or availability of stocked produ ct. 
 Current recommendations for the initial treatment of moderate t o severe asthma in the emergency 
department are to administer three β-agonist treatments over 1 hour in 20 minute increments or one 
treatment continuously over an hour [1, 4]. MDI’s or nebulizers  can be used to administer intermittent 
therapy but nebulizers must be used to deliver continuous treat ment. Current data suggest continuous 
nebulized albuterol (CNA) reduces hospital admissions and offer s time savings in the delivery of 
asthma therapy when compared to intermittent treatments.[5, 6] Mouthpieces deliver more 
aerosolized medication than aerosol masks but it is difficult f or children to hold and seal the 
mouthpiece between their lips for 1 hour during continuous ther apy.[7]   
 
VMN’s are more efficient and deliver higher concentrations of m edication in simulated lung models 
when compared to JN’s.[7-10] In  a recent simulated lung model s tudy the combination of a VMN and 
VM delivered significantly more medication than a JN with AM, a nd when VMN was used with a 
mouthpiece there was almost an 8 fold increase in drug delivery .[7] Further studies are needed to 
assess the clinical efficacy of delivering higher dosages.

Page 2 of 6 3. Concise Summary of Project: 
 
This study will compare clinical outcomes of using a JN with AM  or MP versus VMN with VM or MP in 
the treatment of acute moderate to severe asthma in CMCED. Pati ents will be treated according to 
CMCED’s current Acute Asthma Clin ical Pathway Algorithm for ED (AACPA) and randomized to 
receive aerosol therapy via JN with AM or MP (control group) or  VMN with VM or MP (study group). 
Study personnel will screen CMCED census through the EMR for pa tients diagnosed with acute 
asthma exacerbation with an initial assessment of moderate to s evere asthma (AS 5-12), according to 
the AACPA. Study personnel will approach the parents for study consent as soon as possible after 
CMCED admission and before any bronchodilator treatment begins.  We are evaluating nebulizer 
devices in this study. Investigators and treating physicians wi ll be blinded to which nebulizer was 
assigned to each patient. Primary study outcomes will be hospit al admission rates. Secondary study 
outcomes will be number of treatments and length of stay in CMC ED. 
 
4. Study Procedures:   Upon admission to CMCED patients diagnosed with acute asthma ex acerbation will receive an initial 
assessment and asthma score (AS), per the AACPA. Patients asses sed with moderate to severe 
asthma exacerbation (Moderate; AS 5-8, Severe; 9-12) will be el igible for enrollment in the study. 
Patients with impending respiratory failure will not be approac hed for enrollment. Once enrolled, 
patients will be randomized to receive aerosol therapy via JN w ith AM or MP (control group) or VMN 
with VM or MP (study group). Randomization process will consist  of numbering 220 envelopes from 1-
220 (110 for each arm). Using a simple randomization method eac h numbered envelope will be 
assigned to study or control group with a corresponding card pl aced inside indicating JN or VMN. 
Envelopes will then be sealed and held by PI. Envelopes will be  assigned to study subjects in 
numerical order. Mask or mouthpi ece selection will be made base d on patient’s age and/or ability to 
comply with using a mouthpiece. Patients will be treated accord ing to CMCED’s AACPA with the 
following modifications to allow for blinding and data collecti on: 
 
Phase 1a (1
st hour) 
 
 According to AACPA initial treatment consists of three β-agoni st treatments (albuterol & 
Ipratropium), which can be delivered in 20-minute increments or  combined and given 
continuously over one hour. For blinding and assessment purpose s 3 intermittent treatments 
will be given instead of continuously for this study. 
 Two study personnel will be used to provide treatment: 
 
o One will administer all treatments with assigned nebulizer, pe rform pre-study 
assessments and note the start time of the treatment. Once aero sol treatments are 
completed the assigned nebulizer will be placed in a non-transp arent bag for blinding. 
o The second “blinded” study personnel will perform post assessm ent and assign an AS. 
 
 Since JN and VMN aerosolization rates differ, post assessment by blinded study personnel will 
not occur until 20 minutes has elapsed from initiation of treat ments. 
 Patients will receive and AS after each treatment and will be treated accordingly. 
 If after the 1st treatment a patient receives an AS of 1-4 (mild) they will be treated according to 
the “mild” pathway. 
 If patients receive an AS of 5-12 (moderate to severe) they wi ll receive their 2nd treatment 
and/or 3rd treatments. 
 Patients will continue to be assessed and scored every 20 minu tes regardless of AS. 
 This procedure will be repeated until all 3 three treatments a nd/or assessments are completed 
in Phase1a of AACPA.

Page 3 of 6  Once patients have finished treatments in Phase 1a they will e ither move to Phase 1b, be 
discharged or be admitted per AACPA guidelines. 
 For consistency in CMCED length of stay and discharge criteria  patients will be monitored for 
40 minutes after their last treatment before discharge orders. 
 If at any time or any Phase, the patient is deemed to be in im pending respiratory failure by 
treating physician, they will be removed from the study and be treated according to physician 
orders. 
 
Phase 1b (2nd hour) 
 
 Treatments will be administered in the same fashion as Phase 1 a with their assigned 
nebulizer. 
 If an additional hour long treatment is ordered per AACPA, 3 i ntermittent treatments given in 
20 minute increments will be administered in the same manner as  Phase 1a. 
 Once patients have finished treatments in Phase 1b they will e ither move to Phase 1c, be 
discharged or admitted per AACPA guidelines.   
Phase 1c (3
rd hour) 
 
 If patients advance to Phase 1c, they will receive subsequent aerosol treatments and 
assessments in the same manner until they are either (1) admitt ed to hospital, or (2) 
discharged from CMCED per AACPA guidelines/pathway. 
 If continuous bronchodilator treatment is ordered per AACPA in  Phase 1c then study 
procedure will stop and patient will be treated per standard pr actice using large volume jet 
nebulizer.

Page 4 of 6 8. Sources of Research Material: 
 
Electronic medical record (EMR) will be used to collect data re garding vital signs (HR, RR, SpO 2), 
breath sounds, work of breathing, and asthma scores. Additional  data collected from EMR and used 
for analysis will be demographics, diagnosis, previous medical history, medication dosages, number 
of treatments administered, and time in CMCED. Other data not c ollected in EMR will be recorded on 
case report forms (CRFs) and entered into a secure password pro tected EXCEL spreadsheet. Data 
collected on CRFs will include nebulizer used for treatment bas ed on randomization, type of interface 
used for treatment (AM, VM, MP), bronchodilator use prior to CM CED admission, oral corticosteroid 
administration pre/post CMCED ad mission, patient tolerance/comp liance with aerosol treatment, as 
well as any adverse side effects.  9. Recruitment Methods and Consenting Process: 
 
Study personnel will screen CMCED census through the EMR for pa tients diagnosed with acute 
asthma exacerbation and an initial assessment of moderate to se vere asthma (AS 5-12), per the 
AACPA. Patients that have an existing treatment relationship wi th Co-Investigator Physician might 
also be approached for enrollment. Study personnel will approac h the parents for study consent as 
soon as possible after CMCED admission and before any bronchodi lator treatment begins. Enrollment 
will be available only to Spanish and English speaking families  due to availability of translation 
services; a translator will be utilized for consent and documen tation purposes for Spanish speaking 
families only. The expected duration of this study is 3-4 month s. 
  
10. Potential Risks: 
 
1) Loss of Confidentiality 
 
2) Delivery of inhaled Short-Acting Beta
2-Agonists, in general, cause few systemic adverse 
effects[4]: 
 
 Tachycardia 
 Skeletal muscle tremor 
 Hypokalemia 
 Increased lactic acid 
 Headache 
 Hyperglycemia 
   11. Subject Safety and Data Monitoring:  
Patient’s well-being and medical status will be monitored by CM CED staff throughout their emergency 
department stay in line with current standards of care and acco rding to the AACPA. Vital signs will be 
monitored pre and post each aerosol treatment. If a vital sign is noted to be abnormal or an adverse 
event occurs, the RT or nurse for that patient will notify trea ting physician and PI. There will be a 
written report created of any adverse events that occur during treatments and a report will be made to 
the PI and the PI’s faculty sponsor within 24 hours. Any report ed adverse events will be reviewed at 
the time they are reported to determine if the adverse event wa s in any way caused by the study 
procedure.  Any events deemed due to the study procedure will c ause the study to be halted and 
further reviewed. Changes to the study procedure will be made a s needed and reported to the IRB. 
The study will resume upon approval. Data will also be reviewed  weekly by PI and co-investigator for 
any trends in safety concerns.

  12. Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality:  To protect subject confidentiality, all data will be kept in a password-protected Excel database and all 
hard copies of data case report forms will be stored in a locke d filing cabinet within PI’s badge access 
restricted office. Only PI will have key to locked cabinet. Sub jects will be given a study identification 
number, and patient identifiers will not be included in the dat abase or hard copies of files. No patient 
name or identifying information will be included in any dissemi nation of study findings. The master list 
that links patient identifiers to the study subject will be kep t recorded in a secure password protected 
EXCEL spreadsheet and paper copy under lock at the PIs office. It will be made very clear during the 
consent procedure that the patient/legal guardian will be free to withdraw from the study at absolutely 
any time, for any reason. Upon completion of data collection, a ll PHI will be de-identified. Only the 
study team will have access to study records and data. If a pat ient revokes authorization for 
participation in the study, all data will be discarded and will  not be used. Data will be collected during 
the study days, specifically for purpose of the study 
 13. Potential Benefits:  Potential benefits derived from use of VMN for research subject s are: 
 
 Decreased treatment times 
 Fewer overall treatments 
 Decreased time in Emergency Department 
 Decreased admissions 
 Decreased medication dosages 
 
Potential benefits derived from use of VMN to others with simil ar problems are: 
 
• Decreased treatment times 
• Fewer overall treatments 
• Decreased Emergency Department and/or primary care physican v isits 
• Decreased hospital admissions • Decreased medication dosages • Better control of symptoms and/or exacerbations 
 
Potential benefits to society derived from use of VMN are: 
 
• Decreased healthcare costs • Decreased Emergency Department utilization  
 
14. Biostatistics:   Original Power/Sample Size Calculation  Based on a comparable study[11], the hospital admission rate is  estimated to be 60% in the jet 
nebulizer group and 33% in the vibrating mesh nebulizer group, respectively. A sample size of 60 
patients per group (120 patients in total) will achieve 80% pow er to detect statistically significant 
difference in hospital admission rates between the two groups ( significance level=0.05, 2-sided).

Page 6 of 6 Blinded Interim Power Analysis 
 
At 108 patients a blinded interim power analysis revealed the r ate of 
hospitalization is 20/108 or 18.5%. This is considerably lower than the rates anticipated in 
the original design. This is an indication that either the stud y population is much different 
than the population in the referenced work or the implementatio n of the intervention is 
different in this study. The overall rate of admission was arou nd 45% in the referenced work. 
As an estimate of the effect of the intervention, maintaining s omething similar to a 2 to 1 
admission rate between arms, this would indicate the comparison  will be between one arm 
with a 12.5% admission rate and a second arm with a 27.5% admis sion rate. The same 
power calculation as before is repeated here for the lower rate s which are more in line with 
what is being observed. This indicates that the shift in rates does have an impact on the power of the 
study. The study would require 220 subjects to still have 80% p ower to detect the difference. At the 
current sample size of 120, the study only has 53.8% power.

Version 1.3 2/13/2018This is Single-blinded  study, you will know  which nebulizer has been assigned to you 
but the researcher performing post assessments will not know  which nebulizer was 
used to administer  your treatments.
Procedures and Evaluations during the Research
During the course of this study  you will be treated according to Children’s Medical 
Center Emergency Department  (CMCED)  Acute Asthma Clinical Pathway Algorithm  
(AACPA) which is standard  of care. Aerosolized bronchodilator (Albuterol and 
Ipratropium) treatments will not change  based on which  nebulizer you have been 
randomly assigned. You will receive nebulizer  treatment with either  a mask or 
mouthpiece depending on your age and ability to use a mouthpiece.
Two study  personnel  will be used to provide nebulizer treatment. One will provide 
initial assessment and treatment and a second study personnel, who does not know 
which nebulizer was used, will perform an assessment  after each treatment.
After each treatment you will be assessed for additional  treatments per the AACPA. 
Subsequent aerosol treatments and assessments will continue in the same manner  
until you are either (1) admitted  to hospital, or (2) discharged  from the emergency 
department.
If continuous bronchodilator  treatment  is ordered per AACPA then study procedure 
will stop and you will be treated per standard  practice  using large volume jet 
nebulizer.
How long can I expect  to be in this study?
You will be in this study  until you are either  discharged  from the emergency department 
or admitted to the hospital for asthma exacerbation.
You can choose to stop participating for any reason at any time. However,  if you decide  
to stop participating in the study, we encourage  you to tell the researchers.  
What are the risks of the study?
Study Procedure/Intervention
Vibrating mesh nebulizers may deliver more  medication than standard jet nebulizers  
and possibly increasing common  side effects associated with bronchodilators which  are:
• Tachycardia (faster than normal heart  rate)
• Skeletal muscle tremor (twitching or shakiness) 
• Hypokalemia (low potassium in blood)
• Increased  lactic acid (lactic  acid is the product of cell metabolism)
• Headache (pain in head or neck)

Version 1.3 2/13/2018• Hyperglycemia (excess glucose (sugar)  in blood)
You will be treated  according to Children’s Medical Center Emergency Department 
Acute Asthma  Clinical  Pathway Algorithm. 
These are the same risks that you would experience whether you were in the study or 
not.
Loss of Confidentiality
Any time information is collected; there  is a potential risk  for loss of  confidentiality.  
Every effort will be made to keep your information confidential; however, this cannot be  
guaranteed. 
How will risks be minimized or prevented?  
Your well-being and medical status will be monitored by CMCED staff  throughout your 
emergency department  stay in line with current standards of care and according to the 
AACPA. Vital signs will be monitored  before and after each aerosol  treatment. If a vital 
sign is noted to be abnormal or an adverse  event  occurs, the Respiratory Therapist (RT) 
or nurse for that patient will notify treating  physician and Principal Investigator (PI). If at 
any time the patient is deemed  to be in impending respiratory  failure by treating 
physician, they will be removed from the study and be treated  according to physician 
orders.
What will my responsibilities be during the study?  
While you are part of this study, the researchers  will follow you closely  to determine

Name of Sponsor: Sunovion Pharm aceuticals Inc.  
Name of Investigational Product:  Dasotraline (SEP -225289) 
Title of Study: Dasotraline (2mg) in Children Aged 6 to 12 Years with Attention- Deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder (ADHD): A Randomized, Multicenter, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel-group 
Study of Efficacy and Safety in a Laboratory Classroom Setting  
Proposed Indication: Attention -Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)  
Study Centers:  Approximately 5 centers in North America  
Planned Study Period:  4-6 months  
Study Objectives : 
Primary: To evaluate the efficacy of dasotraline 2 mg/day compared to placebo on attention- deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children (6 – 12 years of age) , who weigh ≤ 30 kg,  in a 
laboratory classroom setting.  
Secondary: 
•To evaluate the efficacy of dasotraline 2 mg/day compared to placebo on ADHD symptoms
throughout the day (12 to 24 hours post- dose) in children in a laboratory classroom setting.
•To evaluate the safety and tolerability of dasotraline 2 mg/day using physical examinations,
12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG), vital signs, adverse event (AE) reports, clinical laboratory
results, and the Columbia – Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS) Children’s Assessment.
Study Design: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, efficacy and 
safety study in children with ADHD in a laboratory classroom setting. The study will be comprised of 
3 periods: Screening (up to 35 days) including a 3 - 5 day ADHD medication washout prior to Day  -1, 
if necessary ; Double- blind randomized treatment  with either dasotraline ( 2 mg /day) or placebo for 
14 days; and a final safety evaluation 7  days after last dose.  Prior to the start of treatment ( Day 1) and 
follo wing the conclusion of the double-blind period ( Day 15), subjects will undergo a full- day 
laboratory classroom evaluation in  cohorts of up to 18 subjects . Each laboratory classroom day will 
include seven 30- minute simulated classroom sessions where trained  observers will assess subjects 
using the Swanson, Kotkin, A gler, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) Scale. In addition during each 
classroom session, a 10 -minute math test (Permanent Product Measure of Performance [PERMP]) will 
be administered to evaluate sustai ned attention and effort. Seven (±  2) days after the last dose of study 
drug, subjects will return to the clinic and complete safety assessments.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the change from baseline to Day  15 in ADHD symptoms as 
measured by the m ean SKAMP -Combined score obtained from an average of the 7 SKAMP 
assessments collected across the 12 -hour classroom day . The SKAMP is a validated 13 -item rating 
scale that assesses manifestations of ADHD in a classroom setting through a combined score and 2 subscale scores; deportment items (interacting with other children, interacting with adults, remaining 
quiet, staying seated, complying with the teacher’s directions, and following the classroom rules) and attention items (getting started, sticking with tasks, attending to an activity, making activity transitions, 
completing assigned tasks, performing work accurately, and being neat and careful while writing or 
drawing). The PERMP is a 5 -page math test consisting of 80 problems per page (total of 
400 prob lems); both attempted problems and correct problems will be assessed. Subjects are to 
complete as many problems as possible in 10  minutes. The appropriate math level for each subject is 
determined based on results of the math pretest administered at screening. 
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Proprietary 5  19 November 2017 Safety  and tolerability  will be  monitored  throu ghout the study by physical and neurological 
examin ations,  12-lead ECG,  vital signs,  AEs, clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology,  chem istry, 
and urinalysi s), and the C-SSRS. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety and 
tolerability data including data on AEs and serious AEs at regular intervals.  
Screening: The screening period will be completed within a maximum of 35 days prior to the first dose 
of study drug and will begin with acquisition of informed assent from  the subject and informed consent 
from at least one of the subject’s parents/legal guardians.  
Subjects will be confirmed as meeting DSM-5 criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD. Subjects may be 
either currently untreated or recei ving stimulan t ADHD medication at Screening.  On Day  -7 the 
ADHD Rating Scale Version  IV - Home Version (modified for investigator administration) 
(ADHD -RS-IV HV)  will be completed and subjects will attend a half -day practice laboratory classroom 
session intended to familiarize them with classroom schedules and procedures related to SKAMP evaluations, PERMP tests, and other planned activities. Any subjects receiving stimulant medication for 
ADHD will discontinue that ADHD treatment for 3  - 5 day s prior to Da y -1 in order to ensure that 
there is at least a 72 -hour washout before the assessment of ADHD symptoms on Day 1. The day 
before randomization, the subject’s parent/legal guardian will be contacted by study site staff in order 
to confirm the presence of clinically significant ADHD symptoms since discontinuation of stimulant 
medication . Clinical ly significant is defined as an ADHD -RS-IV HV total score ≥  26 following a 
minimum 72-hour washout from any prior ADHD treatment.  Subjects who do not demonstrate 
clinically significant symptoms  (i.e., ADHD- RS-IV ≥ 26) on Day -1 will be considered screen failures 
and will not be  eligible for  randomiz ation.  
Subjects may be rescreened a maximum of 2 times for out of range clinical laboratory results, 
insufficient medicati on washout periods, etc. 
Double -blind Period: On Day 1 subjects will return to the clinic in the morning, and those m eeting all 
inclusion and no exclusion  criteria  will be randomized  (1:1) to receive 2 mg/day dasotraline, or placebo, 
and will attend classroom sessions in which they will be evaluated for ADHD symptoms using the 
SKAMP assessment. During this baseline classroom assessment ( Day 1), subjects will be evaluated at 
regular intervals: approximately 8  AM, 10 AM , 12 PM , 2 PM , 4 PM , 6 PM,  and 8  PM. Sub jects will 
begin taking study drug on th e evening  of Day 1 (with or without food) after the final, 8:00 PM baseline 
classroom assessment. Subjects will take one dose each evening before bedtime for a total of 14 days. 
Study drug should be taken at approxim ately the same time each evening. The first dose of study drug 
may be administered  at approximately 8 PM  plus or minus 30 minutes, in the clinic after all 
assessments are completed and before the subject leaves, or at home. On the night ( Day 14) before the  
second classroom day, study drug must be taken at approximately 8 PM plus or minus 30  minutes. During 
the double -blind period, the clinical site will attempt to contact the subject’s parent/legal guardian daily with a 
reminder to administer study drug . A dosing diary will be provided to the parent/legal guardian  to record the 
date and time of each administration of study drug. On Day  15 subjects will return to the clinic in the 
morning at 6:30 AM and classroom sessions will be started at approximately 8  AM, 10 AM, 12 PM , 
2 PM , 4 PM , 6 PM,  and 8 PM  to coincide with 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 hour s following the 
Day 14 dose.  
End of Study: Seven (±2)  days after the last dose of study drug, all subjects will return to the clinic 
and complete assessments. A fter the EOS visit, all subjects will be referred for continuation of their 
care as determined by the investigator. Additionally, for subjects who complete the study or discontinue for tolerability or lack of efficacy reasons, the sponsor will provide support for approved 
ADHD medication costs for up to 3 months after participation in the study, if deemed medically 
appropriate by the subject’s healthcare provider. 
A study schematic is presented in Figure  1. A summary  of assessments to be conducted at each 
visit is  presented in Table 2, Schedule of Assessments.

Statistical Methods:  
Hypotheses:  
Let μ 2mg/day, and μ PBO represent the changes from baseline at Day 15 in mean SKAMP-Combined score 
for dasotraline 2 mg /day,  and placebo arms, respectively. The following hypothesi s wil l be tested to 
compare the mean change value between the dasotraline 2 mg /day group and the placebo group from 
baseline to Day  15: 
1. Dasotraline 2 mg /day versus placebo:  
 H 01: μ2mg/day = μ PBO versus H 11: μ2mg/day ≠ μ PBO  
Efficacy Analysis: 
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be applied to evaluate the treatment effect for the primary 
efficacy endpoint between the dasotraline 2  mg/day and placebo groups for the intent -to-treat (ITT) 
population. The model will include treatment, mean SKAMP -Combined score at baseline, and site as 
fixed effects. T he primary efficacy analysis will be repeated for the per protocol (PP) population. To 
explore the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis of change from baseline at Day 15 in ADHD 
symptoms in mean SKAMP-Combine d score, 2  sensitivity analyses will be performed, a placebo -based 
multiple imputation pattern -mixture model (PMM) and a tipping point analysis using the PMM. 
A similar ANCOVA model, as described above, will be used for the secondary efficacy endpoints for  
the ITT population. 
Multiplicity Considerations: There will be no adjustment for multiplicity for the primary efficacy 
analysis, secondary efficacy analyses, or safety analyses.  
Safety Analysis:  
All safety analyses will be performed on the safety population. Overall  AEs (or SAEs)  and AEs (or 
SAEs)  leading to discontinuat ion w ill be  summar ized by system  organ  class and preferred  term by 
presenting the number  and percentage of subjects with each AE. Descriptive  statistics  also will be 
provided by visit for observed  values  and changes  from baseline  for the following  safety  variables:  
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Proprietary 10  19 November 2017 laboratory tests, vital signs,  and ECG  parameters. Frequency  and severity  of suicidality , as captured by 
the C-SS RS, will be summarized  by visit.  
Sample Size:   
A post- hoc ANCOVA-L OCF analysis of data from the SEP360-305 laboratory classroom study was 
conducted to examine the effect of dasotraline 4  mg/day versus placebo in a subset of pediatric patients  
with ADHD aged 6 -9 years old. This analysis showed an effect size in this subgr oup of 0.95 (LS mean 
difference at Week  2 was 7.2 with a standard error of 2.2). A ssum ing a smaller effect size for 
dasotraline 2  mg/day vs. placebo than that of dasotraline 4 mg/day vs. placebo, an effect size of 0.7 was 
utilized for the sample size calcu lation. 
Therefore, assuming an effect size of 0.7 for  dasotraline 2  mg/day compar ed to placebo on the primary 
efficacy endpoint of mean SKAMP -Combined score obtained from the average of 7  assessments 
collected across the 12 -hour classroom day, 88 subjects (44 per treatment group) will provide 90% 
power to detect a treatment effect between dasotraline and placebo at the two -sided alpha level of 0.05, 
based on the two- sample t -test with equal variance procedure. 
The study will target approximately 100  subject s (50 per treatment group) randomized to either placebo 
or dasotraline 2 mg/day in an attempt to have 88 subjects complete the trial (assuming a 12% overall 
dropout rate).

Confidential and Propr ietary  23 19 November 2017 4. INTRODUCTION 
4.1. Backgrou nd 
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized 
by persistent inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that is more severe or frequent when compared to individuals of the same developmental stage. There are a number of characteristics 
related to cognition that distinguish people with ADHD from people without ADHD including 
deficits in response inhibition ( Aron -2005, Goto -2010, Luna -2004) and reward sensitivity 
(Passarotti -2011), as well as working memory,  attention, planning, and behavioral inhibition 
(Hervey -2004, Boonstra-2005, Willcutt-2005). ADHD is prevalent in approximately 8% to  10% 
of school-aged children and approximately 2% to 5% of adults ( Ferri -2014 ). Symptoms 
experienced in childhood often persist into adolescence and adulthood, al though the 
hyperactivity component tends to diminish over time (Ferri-2014). 
The etiology of ADHD is not fully understood, but it is believed that both genetic and non-
genetic factors are implicated in the disease. Several factors related to disturbances of neonatal 
development including premature birth, low birth weight and perinatal complications have been 
shown to increase the risk of developing ADHD in childhood ( Perricone -2013, Botting -1997, 
Amor -2005).The neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine are propos ed to have a critical 
role in the development of ADHD and thus receptors associated with these are key drug targets (Rader -2009 ).  
Current ADHD pharmacotherapies have effects on central catecholamine neurotr ansmission. In 
nonclinical microdialysis studies, ADHD drugs like amphetamine, methylphenidate, and atomoxetine increase dopamine and norepinephrine – either by reuptake inhibition or stimulation of release – especially in the prefrontal cortex. At clinically -efficacious doses, 50% dopamine 
transporter (DAT) occupancies are reported with methylphenidate in adults with ADHD (Volkow-1998).  
Adrenergic signaling in the prefrontal cortex is thought to control attentional processes and thus 
contribute to working memory and executive functions ( Arnsten -2011, Gamo -2011). Consistent 
with this neuronal circuitry, norepinephrine transporter (NET) inhibition (eg, atomoxetine) alone 
is sufficient for clinical efficacy in ADHD. The stimulants amphetamine and methylphenida te 
both increase norepinephrine concentrations centrally, and methylphenidate achieves 50% NET occupancy in human subjects at doses clinically efficacious in ADHD ( Hannestad -2010).  
Dasotraline (also known as SEP-225289) is a new chemical entity that is thought to produce its 
therapeutic effects in ADHD by inhibition of the presynaptic DAT and NET, as determined by 
receptor occupancy and microdialysis studies. Pharmacologically, dasotraline is consistent w ith 
dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (D NRI) effects. Dasotraline is a diastereomer of 
the major metabolite of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline, but is not a metabolite of sertraline, nor is it converted to the desmethylated metabolite of sertraline in vivo. Unlike amphetamines, dasotraline does not increase the release of these monoamines into the 
extraneuronal space. Dasotr aline's pharmacokinetic profile  allows plasma concentrations to 
remain in a therapeutic range over the 24 -hour dosing interval at steady state. 
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  24 19 November 2017 As there is a considerable unmet medical need for ADHD medications in children and 
adolescents that optimize onset and duration of action, Sunovion believes dasotraline, a novel 
inhibitor of NET and DAT, may be a useful addition to the current treatment armamentarium. 
Based on the available data dasotraline may provide steady, full -day coverage of DAT and NET 
inhibition. Dasotraline is being evaluated as a once daily treatment for children, adolescents and 
adults with ADHD with possible therapeutic coverage across the 24-hour dosing interval. 
4.2. Study Conduct Rationale  
Dasotraline has been evaluated for the treatment of ADHD in 4 completed placebo controlled 
studies, 2 in adults and 2 in children 6 -12 years of age.  Moreover, an open label de novo stud y 
in adults and an open label extension study in children have also been completed.  Additional 
studies on the pharmacokinetics and abuse liability of the compound have also shown the dru g to 
have a tolerable profile.  
This will be the third  study to assess the efficacy and s afety of dasotraline in pediatric subjects  
with ADHD.  The prior 2 studies demonstrated efficacy at 4  mg in comparison to placebo. This 
study will utilize a simulated classroom setting , identical to the one used in SEP360-305, to 
evaluate the efficacy and s afety of dasotraline 2 mg/day  in pediatric subjects with ADHD. In this 
setting subjects encounter activities and interaction normally found in a typical school day. The 
laboratory school protocol ( Wigal -2006) is a particularly useful method for evaluation of 
efficacy in subjects with ADHD because it represents a controlled study setting for evaluation and comparison of study treatments. 
The present study seeks to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dasotraline 2  mg/day . Data 
supporting the safety and efficacy of both a 2 mg and a 4  mg dose would afford a range of 
potential doses (2-4 mg/day) for children, allowing clinicians the flexibility to achieve the 
optimal benefit/risk for each patient.  
Further information on nonclinical and other clinical studies is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
4.3. Risk -Benefit Assessment  
There are two recently completed studies in children  with ADHD that report on the efficacy and 
tolerability of dasotraline  (SEP360-202 and SEP360-305), both of which demonstrated 
statisticall y significant improvement compared t o placebo at the 4  mg/day dose. A third study, 
SEP360-310, has been completed but the analyses are not yet finalized. 
 
SEP360-202 
SEP360- 202 evaluated the efficacy and safety of 2  doses of dasotraline (2 mg/day and 4 mg/ day) 
in pediatric subjects with ADHD.  In this 6-week double-blind, placebo controlled trial, 
dasotraline (4  mg/day) was superior to placebo, and well tolerated. 
In SEP360-202, overall, 54.1% of subjects experienced at least 1  Treatment Emergent Adverse 
Event (TEAE) during the study, 38.6% experienced a TEAE that was considered by the 
Investigator to be related to study drug, and 6.7% experienced a TEAE that led to 
discontinuation of study drug. Subjects in the dasotraline 4 mg/day group experienced more 
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  25 19 November 2017 TEA Es, more related TEAEs, and more TEAEs that led to a discontinuation than the dasotraline 
2 mg/day group and the placebo group, and the placebo group experienced the least in each of 
these categories. No  subjects experienced an SAE and there were no deaths  during the study. 
 
SEP360-305 
SEP360- 305 evaluated the efficacy and safety of dasotraline (4  mg/day) to placebo, in pediatrics 
with ADHD in a classroom laboratory setting over 2  weeks . The dasotraline (4  mg/day) dose 
demonstrated statistically superior efficacy when compared to placebo, and was well tolerated.  
In SEP360-305, TEAEs were more common in patients taking dasotraline compared with th ose 
taking placebo (data from the discontinued 6 mg arm of this trial are included here for safety 
consideration). TEAEs were generally mild or moderate in severity. Four patients receiving 
dasotraline experienced severe TEAEs: 4  mg/day: 1 case of insomnia and 1 case of decreased 
appetite;  6 mg/day: 2 cases of insomnia. No serious AEs occurred in patients treated with 
dasotraline. TEAEs associated with discontinuation were hallucinations (2 cases in the 6  mg/day 
group, 1 case in the 4  mg/day group), insomnia (1 case in the 4 mg/day group), decreased 
appetite (1 case in the 6  mg/day group), and rash (1 case in the 4 mg/ day group).  
 
Moreover, there have been three studies of dasotraline efficacy and tolerability in adults with 
ADHD including one long term de novo trial for safety ; SEP360-201, SEP360-301, and 
SEP360-304 respectively . 
 
SEP360-201 
The first study  (SEP360-201),  a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, outpatient study at 
30 sites , evaluated the efficacy and safety of dasotraline in adults with ADHD using 2  doses 
(4 mg/day or 8  mg/day) versus placebo over a 4 -week treatment period. In this study, clinically 
meaningful treatment effects were observed for both dasotraline 4  mg/day and 8 mg /day 
compared to placebo. For the primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in ADHD Rating Scale Version IV  (ADHD RS -IV) with adult prompts total score at week  4, statistical 
significance was achieved for dasotraline 8  mg/day compared to placebo (adjusted p = 0.019) 
with a strong trend for dasotraline 4 mg /day (adjusted p = 0.076). Efficacy with both doses was 
observed for the secondary endpoint Clinical Global Impression –Severity of Illness  (CGI -S; 
4 mg  group p = 0.021; 8 mg  group p = 0.013). A dose response relationship was observed 
supporting pharmacological activity in ADHD. Decreases in 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol ( DHPG) 
concentrations indicated the presence of central NET inhibition. Adverse events (AEs) were 
consistent with dasotraline pharmacology, ie, insomnia, decreased appetite, dry mouth, and 
headache. Worsening of insomnia associated with dasotraline was characterized by AEs, and 
shifts in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) total score, particularly with dasotraline 8  mg/day. AEs, 
particularly insomnia, were the most frequent reason for discontinuation of dasotraline 8 mg /day. 
Decreases in mean body weight were generally greater for dasotraline 8  mg/day than 4 mg /day. 
Increases in mean supine and standing heart rate observed during treatment and follow-up were generally higher on dasotraline 8 mg /day than 4 mg /day

Confidential and Propr ietary  26 19 November 2017 SEP360-301 
The second adult study (SEP360- 301) evaluated the efficacy and safety of dasotraline (4  mg/day 
and 6 mg/day) and although the doses were found safe, and the 6 mg arm showed numerically 
greater improvement over placebo, neither dose was statistically significantly different than placebo.  
 
SEP360-304 
The third study (SEP360-304) showed that dasotralin e, flexibly dosed from 4 mg/day to 
8 mg/day , appeared to be safe, well tolerated, and effective in adults for the long term treatment 
of ADHD. Given the long half-life of dasotraline, dosing increments at a frequency of no more than every 2  weeks may impro ve overall tolerability.  
 
The pharmacokinetics and abuse potential for dasotraline have been assessed in several studies.  
One study was completed that evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and 
pharmacodynamic properties of dasotraline in ped iatric (6 – 12 years) and adolescent 
(13 - 17 years) subjects  with ADHD. In this multicenter, open-label study 105 subjects were 
assigned to single oral doses of dasotraline 1 - 16 mg in a dose- escalating manner. Dasotraline 
was characterized by slow absor ption (median t
max was 9.6 to 12 hour s) and elimination (median 
t½ was 56 to 84 hours) in both pediatric and adolescent subjects. The change in C max with dose 
was slightly greater than dose proportional. Increase in overall exposure (AUC) with dose was 
greater than dose proportional. Apparent oral clearance was highest in the lowest dose group 
relative to the higher dose groups. No deaths, serious adverse events (SAE), or discontinuations 
because of an adverse event (AE) were reported in this study. The mos t frequently reported AE 
by investigators were tachycardia (25  subjects; 23.8%) and electrocardiogram QT prolonged 
(5 subjects; 4.8%), nearly all of which were considered related to study drug and mild in 
severity. Tachycardia AEs were reported in both age groups and in every dose cohort. Most 
events of tachycardia were reported on the day of study drug administration. No subjects 
experienced QT prolongations > 500 msec. Based on the centrally read electrocardiogram 
(ECGs ) in the study, no clinically signif icant trends were identified within the ECG results.  
Blood pressure increased, blood pressure systolic increased, blood pressure orthostatic abnormal, and orthostatic hypotension AEs were reported in 1 subject each. Overall, after dosing, 90 subjects (85.7%) met predefined criteria for orthostatic tachycardia and 40  (38.1%) met 
predefined criteria for orthostatic hypotension. 
Two studies have been  completed to support dasotraline as a compound with minimal abuse 
potential.  The first study  (SEP360-201), a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, outpatient 
study at 30 sites , evaluated the efficacy and safety of dasotraline in adults with ADHD using 
2 doses (4 mg /day or 8  mg/day) versus placebo over a 4- week treatment period.  No signs or 
symptoms of withdrawal upon discontinuation of dasotraline were observed for either dose. In 
addition, there was no evidence of drug liking or deterioration of psychiatric symptoms 
associated with either dose of dasotraline. No misuse or diversion of dasotraline was detected through the abuse potential monitoring plan. A second study evaluated dasotraline’s abuse 
liability and was conducted in recreational stimulant users; results indicated that dasotraline has 
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  27 19 November 2017 low abuse liability  (Koblan-2016). All doses of dasotraline (8, 16, 36 mg ) demonstrated 
significantly lower drug liking scores than methylphenidate (40, 80 mg ) and were no greater than 
placebo.  
Four previous clinical studies in healthy adult subjects using single doses ranging from 0.2 mg  to 
36 mg  and doses of 1 mg /day to  3 mg /day for durations up of 21 days, and another study in adult 
subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) using doses of 0.5 mg /day and 2 mg /day for up 
to 8 weeks (56  days) also have been completed. In these clinical studies, dasotraline was 
generall y safe and well tolerated at the doses studied and there was no evidence of abuse or 
diversion and no symptoms of withdrawal. 
4.4. Hypothesis  
This study is designed to test the superiority of dasotraline 2 mg/day against placebo  based on 
Swanson, Kotkin, A gler, M-Flynn, and Pelham Scale ( SKAMP )-Combined score in pediatric 
subjects  aged 6 -12 years  with ADHD who weigh ≤ 30 kg.

7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel -group, efficacy and safety  study, 
in pediatric subjects  with ADHD in a laboratory classroom set ting. The study will target 
100 subjects ( 50 per treatment group ) to complete the study. The study will be comprised of 
3 periods: Period 1: screening (up to 35 days) including a 3 - 5 day ADHD medication washout, 
if necessary,  prior to Day  -1; Period  2: double-blind randomized treatment with either dasotraline 
(2 mg /day) or placebo for 14 days; and Period 3: End of Study (EOS) visit (7  days after last 
dose). Prior to the start of treatment (Day 1) and following  the conclusion of the 14- day double-
blind per iod (Day 15), subjects will undergo a full-day laboratory classroom evaluation during 
which up to 18 subjects will be assessed. Each laboratory classroom day will include seven 
30-minute simulated classroom sessions where trained observers will assess subj ects using the 
SKAMP Scale. In addition during each classroom session, a 10 -minute math test (Permanent 
Product Measure of Performance [PERMP])  will be administered to evaluate sustained attention 
and effort . The appropriate math level  for each subject is determined based on results of the math  
pretest administered at screening.  
The p rimary efficacy endpoint will be baseline to endpoint change in the SKAMP -Combined 
score. 
Safety  and tolerability  will be  monitored throughout the study by phy sical and neurological 
examin ation s, 12- lead ECG,  vital signs,  AEs, clinical  laboratories  (hematology, chem istry, and 
urinalysi s), and C- SSRS. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety and 
clinical outcome data including data on AEs and serious AEs at re gular intervals.  
Screening: The screening period will be completed within a maximum of 35  days prior to the 
first dose of study drug and will begin with acquisition of informed assent from the subject and 
informed consent from at least one of the subject’s parents/legal guardians.  
Subjects will be confirmed as meeting DSM -5 criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD. Subjects may 
be currently untreated for ADHD or receiving a  treatment regimen of stimulant medication for 
ADHD at Screening. On Day  -7 the ADHD Rating S cale Version  IV - Home Version (modified 
for investigator administration) ( ADHD -RS-IV HV) will be completed and subjects will attend a 
half-day practice laboratory classroom session intended to familiarize them with classroom schedules 
and procedures relat ed to SKAMP evaluations, PERMP tests, and other planned activities. Any 
subjects receiving stimulant medication for ADHD will discontinue that ADHD treatment for 3 - 5 days prior to Day - 1 in order to ensure that there is at least a 72 -hour washout before the 
assessment of ADHD symptoms on Day -1. The day before randomization, the subject’s parent/legal guardian will be contacted by study site staff in order to confirm the presence of clinically significant ADHD symptoms . Clinically significant is defined a s an ADHD -RS-IV HV 
total score ≥  26. Subjects who do not demonstrate clinically significant symptoms on Day -1 will 
be considered screen failures and will not be eligible for randomization. 
Subjects may be rescreened a maximum of 2 times for out of range c linical laboratory results, 
insufficient medication washout periods, etc.

Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  33 19 November 2017 7.2. Treatment Assignment and Blinding  
7.2.1. Treatment Assignment  
After successfully meeting study entry criteria, subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1  ratio 
to 1 of the followi ng treatments:  
• 2 mg /day d asotraline (N  = 50 subjects)  
• Placebo (N  = 50 subjects)  
An Interactive Response System (IXRS) will be used to manage randomization on Day  1 and, if 
necessary, for emergency unblinding (see Section  7.2.3) of treatment assignment during the 
study. The IXRS is an integrated web based subject and drug management system. 
Study medication will be assigned by an IXRS based on the randomization schedule. The IXRS 
will generate instructions on which  medication  number to assign to a subject. 
7.2.2. Blinding  
This is a double-blind study. All study drug capsules (both dasotraline and placebo) are identical 
in color, shape, size, and packaging in order to maintain the blind. 
Subjects, Sponsor personnel, Investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, clinical 
operations personnel, data analysts, and personnel at central laboratories will remain blind to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock and unblinding, 
using the following methods; (1)  randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time 
of unblinding, and will not be accessible by anyone else involved in the s tudy with the exception 
of Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) members involved in re gular review of safety 
data, and Clinical Trial Materials Management personnel , (2) the identity of the treatments will 
be concealed by the use of study drugs that are all identical in packaging, labeling, schedule of 
administration, and appearance. 
7.2.3. Emerge ncy Unblinding Procedures  
The IXRS will be used, if necessary, for emergency unblinding of treatment assignment during 
the study. The blinded dose information is to be broken only in an emergency when knowledge of such treatment may have an impact on further treatment decisions or aid in the emergency 
treatment of the subject. Any subject for whom the blind is broken is to be discontinued from 
receiving any additional study drug and should undergo early termination procedures as described in Section  14. 
7.3. Rationale  
7.3.1. Rationale for the Study Design 
The current study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, laboratory 
classroom study in pediatric subjects with ADHD  weighing ≤ 30 kg . This study was designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and duration of effect of dasotraline ( 2 mg /day) compared with placebo 
over an entire day in a simulated  classroom setting. The laboratory school protocol is a 
particularly useful method for evaluation of efficacy in subjects with ADHD because it 
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  34 19 November 2017 represents a controlled study setting for evaluation and comparison of study treatments and is 
designed to mimic a typical school day. 
7.3.2. Rationale for the Dosages 
The dosage of 2 mg /day of dasotraline w as selected to evaluate dasotraline safety , tolerability,  
and efficacy within the dose range being evaluated in the ongoing studies in pediatric subjects 
with ADHD. 
A dasotraline 2 mg /day dose is  expected to produce mg/kg exposures in pediatric subjects 
weighing ≤ 30 kg similar to th ose demonstrated to be effective in both children and adults with 
ADHD. In prior studies it was noted that AEs appear to be dose related. Therefore , 2 mg in 
smaller children may be efficacious and better tolerated.  
7.3.3. Rationale for the Study Population 
The su bject population includes males and females ranging from 6 to  12 years of age, and in 
concert with standard practice guidelines, will be required to have a diagnosis of ADHD 
established by a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation that reviewed Diagnostic and  Statistical 
Manual for Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM- 5) criteria for ADHD (inattentive, 
hyperactive, or combined presentation); diagnosis will be confirmed using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School- Age Children Present  and Lifetime Version 
(K-SADS -PL). Subjects are required to weigh ≤ 30 kg since a 2  mg/day dose in such a group is 
expected to have mg/kg exposures similar to those demonstrated to be effective in children and 
adults. 
7.3.4. Rationale for the Endpoints 
The primary efficacy measure (mean SKAMP -Combined Score) is a widely accepted efficacy 
endpoint intended to assess functional impairment related to ADHD and has been used in many 
laboratory classroom studies in children ( Childress-2015, Wigal -2014).  
7.4. Prevention of Missing Data  
In an effort to minimize the number of subjects who are terminated from the study prior to study 
completion, the following study design and conduct elements are implemented; (i) use of clinical 
sites with a good track record of having performed this type of study, (ii) training provided to the 
clinical sites o n the importance of the informed consent/assent process and ensuring subjects and 
their parent/guardian understand the commitment they are making, including the intent to 
complete the trial, and (iii)  monitoring data collection for adherence during the study.

10.1. Study Medication  
As described in Section  7.2.1, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatments ( 2 mg /day 
dasotraline or placebo). 
Under supervision from the subject’s parent/legal guardian, subjects will self- administer the 
study drug on an outpatient basis for 14  days beginning the evening of Day  1. Study drug should 
be taken at approximately the same time each evening. The first dose of study drug may be 
administered in the clinic , at approximately 8 PM  plus or minus 30 minutes , after all assessments 
are completed,  before the subject leaves , or at home. On Day  14, the night before the second 
classroom day, study drug must be taken at  approximately  8 PM  plus or minus 30 minutes. All 
study medication doses will consist of 1 capsule per day taken by mouth. 
Subjects may take study drug with or without food. 
Study drug capsules should not be opened or tampered with in any way; the active ingredient is 
an ocular irritant.  
10.2. Treatment Compliance  
During the double- blind period, the clinical site will attempt to contact the subje ct’s parent/legal 
guardian dai ly with a reminder to administer study drug.  
The Investigator will record the dose of the study drug and the dates of the initial and final 
administration  for each  dose. 
Compliance with study drug will be monitored closely and determined at each visit. Subjects and their parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will be instructed to b ring all unused study drug with them to the 
Day 15 visit. Compliance will be assessed by counting capsules and dividing the actual number 
of doses taken (per capsule count) by the number of doses the subject should have taken within a visit period and multiplying by 100. Subjects who miss more than 25% of scheduled doses or 
take more than 125% of the scheduled doses will be considered noncompliant. Evidence of 
noncompliance must be immediately reported to the Medical Monitor. Potential noncompliance will be  discussed with subjects and their parent(s)/legal guardian(s), and at the investigator’s 
discretion may result in termination of the subject from the study. All subjects and their parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will be reminded of the importance of strict compliance with taking study drug for the effectiveness of treatment and for the successful outcome of the study. 
10.3. Concomitant Medications and Therapies  
The following information on all medication  administered between  signed consent/assent  and the 
EOS v isit or at  discontinuation will be recorded  on the CRF:  Medication  name, dose, frequency, 
route, start date, stop date, and indication. 
All medications will be coded using World Health Organization drug dictionary ( WHO- DD).

11.2. Eligibility Assessments  
Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School -Age Children Present and 
Lifetime version  (K-SADS -PL) 
The K-SADS -PL will be used at screening to confirm the diagnosis of ADHD.  
The K -SADS -PL is a semi -structured diagnostic interview designed to assess current and past 
episodes of psychopathology in children and adolescents according to Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual for Mental Disorders Fourth Edition; Text Revision ( DSM -IV-TR) criteria. The 
K-SADS -PL covers a broad spectrum of most child psychiatric diagnoses, with the exception of 
pervasive development disorders and personality disorders. The K- SADS -PL includes questions 
about school performance and other issues relevant to children and adole scents. There is a base 
instrument (82 items) and 5  required diagnostic supplements which are completed depending on 
the results of the base screening: (1)  Affective Disorders; (2) Psychotic Disorders; (3) Anxiety 
Disorders; (4) Behavioral Disorders; (5) Substance Abuse and Other Disorders. 
The K -SADS -PL takes about 45-90 minutes to administer.  
ADHD Rating Scale Version IV - Home Version (modified for investigator administration) 
(ADHD- RS-IV HV)  
The ADHD -RS-IV HV will be used to assess the presence of clinical ly significant ADHD 
symptoms  on Day  -1. 
The ADHD -RS-IV HV was developed to measure the behaviors of children with ADHD. The 
ADHD- RS-IV HV is a validated scale that consists of 18  items designed to reflect current 
symptomatology of ADHD based on Diagnost ic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders  
Fourth Edition; Text Revision  (DSM -IV-TR) criteria and is also consistent with DSM -5 criteria. 
Each item is scored from a range of zero (reflecting no symptoms) to 3  (reflecting severe 
symptoms) with total sco res ranging from zero to  54. The 18 items may be grouped into 
2 subscales: hyperactivity/impulsivity (even number items  2 through 18) and inattentiveness 
(odd number items 1 through 17). The ADHD- RS-IV HV will be administered to the caregiver

assessments for a given subject whenever possible.  
11.3. Efficacy Assessments  
Swanson, Kotkin, A gler, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) Scale  
The SKAMP is a validated 13 -item rating scale  that assesses manifestations of ADHD in a 
classroom setting through a combined score and 2 subscale scores; deportment items (interacting 
with other children, interacting with adults, remaining quiet, staying seated, complying with the 
teacher’s direction s, and following the classroom rules) and attention items (getting started, 
sticking with tasks, attending to an activity, making activity transitions, completing assigned 
tasks, performing work accurately, and being neat and careful while writing or drawi ng). 
Permanent Product Measure of Performance ( PERMP ) 
The PERMP is a 5 -page math test consisting of 80 problems per page (total of 400 problems). 
Both attempted problems and correct problems will be assessed. Subjects are to complete as 
many problems as po ssible in 10 minutes.  
The appropriate math level for each subject is determined based on results of a math pretest 
administered at screening.  
11.4. Safety Assessments  
The Investigator or appropriate designee will review results of safety assessments on a regular  
basis and the Sponsor must be kept fully informed of any clinically significant findings either at Screening or sub sequently during study conduct. 
11.4.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be collected for each subject. Parents/guardians should be queried in a non-
leading manner, without specific prompting (if the child has complained about changes in health and how the child has been feeling ). Subjects should also be queried in a non-leading manner, 
without specific prompting (e.g., “How have you been feeling ? Have you felt different ?). See 
Section  12, Safety Reporting 
AEs and SAEs will be monitored throughout the study at all visits starting after the first dose of 
study drug. 
Untoward medical occurrences that occur prior to the first dose of study drug will be collected as 
pre-treatment events.  
11.4.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
The clinical laboratory tests required by protocol are listed in Section  22, Appendix III . 
Blood and urine samples will be collected for clinical laboratory tests. All clinical laboratory tests will be performed centrally . For detailed instructions regarding clinical laboratory 
procedures, sampling, and shipping guidelines refer to the Central Laboratory Instructions Manual . Samples will be processed at a central laboratory to ensure consistency . All clinical 
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  49 19 November 2017 laboratories will be College of American Pathologists (CAP) and Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments (CLIA) (or equivalent) certified.  
Any POC  (point of care) kits that are performed on site by  study personnel rather than in a lab- 
must be CLIA waived and the study center  must possess a CLIA certificate of Waiver.  
11.4.3. Vital Signs  
Respirat ory rate and oral body temperature will be measured following 5  minutes of supine rest. 
An appropriately sized blood pressure cuff should be used based on the subject’s size. Blood pressure and pulse rate should first be taken with the subject in the supine position after resting for ≥ 5 minutes. Blood pressure and pulse rate will be taken again after the subject has been 
standing for ≥ 5 minutes. The same arm should be used during each assessment of blood pressure 
and pulse rate throughout the study. If a subject develops symptoms consistent with orthostatic hypotension (light-headedness, dizziness, or changes in sensorium upon standing) at any point, 
his or her supine and standing blood pressure and pulse rate should be collected at that time in 
the manner described above. Vital signs will be obtained prior to clinical laboratory collection and performance of an ECG. 
11.4.4. Physical and Neurological Examinations 
Clinically significant physical examination findings, as judged by the investigator, at screening 
will be recorded as medical history and after screening will be recorded as AEs  or pre -treatment 
events  depending on t he timing in relationship to the first dose of study drug. 
Neurological examination parameters will be assessed by the investigator as normal or abnormal. 
11.4.5. Weight and Body Mass Index 
Body weight while wearing street clothes and without shoes will be recorded in kilograms (kg). Height without shoes will be recorded in centimeters (cm). Body mass index will be calculated 
by the electronic data capture ( EDC ) system  using height measured at screening and weight from 
the appropriate visit. 
11.4.6. ECGs  
Centrally -read ECG : All ECGs will be obtained in the supine position, after the subject has 
been resting supine for at least 5 minutes. ECGs will be 12 -lead with a 10 -second rhythm strip. 
ECGs should be obtained prior to drawing blood samples. All attempts should be made to use the 
same ECG recorder for all visits within individual subjects. ECGs will be centrally read at a core 
lab according to established quality assurance procedures for inter/intra reader variability. Refer 
to Section  20, Appendix I  for additional information. 
Standard 12 lead ECG will record heart rate (HR), PR interval, RR interval, QT interval, QTc 
with Bazett correction  (QTcB ) and QTc with Fridericia correction (QTcF ) intervals, and QRS 
duration. 
11.4.7. Safety Scales 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS) Children’s Assessment  
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  50 19 November 2017 The C-SSRS ( Posner-2007) is a tool designed to systematically assess and track suicidal AEs 
(suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation) throughout the study. The strength of this suicide 
classification system is in its ability to comprehensively identify suicidal events while limiting 
the over identification of suicidal behavior. The scale takes approximately 5 minutes to administer. The C- SSRS will be administered by a trained rater at the site.  
This study will utilize 2  versions of the C- SSRS. At the screening visit, the lifetime/recent 
version will be completed; for all subsequent visits the “Since Last Visit” version of the C-SSRS 
will be administered.  
Subjects who have significant findings for suicidal ideation upon completion of the C- SSRS at 
any time during the study must be referred to the investigator for follow-up evaluation.

Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  53 19 November 2017 12. SAFETY R EPORTING  
12.1. Definitions 
12.1.1. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated wit h the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related . 
Untoward medical occurrences that occur between the time of informed consent/assent and first 
study drug administration are pre -treatment events. Those that occur after first administra tion of 
study drug are considered AEs. 
An AE can , therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease occurring after the administration of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product. AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. A Es will be 
collected from after first administration of study drug to the last study visit. 
Lack of ef ficacy may be an expected potential outcome and should not be reported as an AE 
unless the event is unusual in some way. 
New signs and symptoms of underlying disease, or signs and symptoms of emerging diseas e 
must be recorded as AEs.  
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE 
and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
12.1.2. Serious  Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening.  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly  or birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject  or may require a 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intens ive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions  that do 
not result in inpatient hospitalization . 
The term "severe" is often used to describe the severity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, 
or severe myocardial infarct ion) (s ee Section  12.3); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  54 19 November 2017 "serious," which is based on subject /event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject 's life or functioning as defined by the criteria above. 
During the study, if a subject  has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g., elective surgery) that was 
scheduled before the s tudy e ntry, i.e., before informed consent for an event/condition that 
occurred before the study, the hospitalization is considered a therapeutic intervention and not the 
result of a SAE. However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it should be reported 
as an AE (or SAE, if the event/condition results in a serious outcome such as prolongation of hospitalization).  
Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred. This definition does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death.  
SAE criteria information will be captured on the CRF. 
12.2. Objective Findings 
Clinically significant abnormal objective findings (e .g., clinical laborator y value, ECG value, and 
physical examination observation) will also be recorded as  AEs. 
When a clear diagnosis is available that explains the objective findings, this diagnosis will be recorded as the AE, and not the abnormal objective finding (e.g., viral hepatitis will be recorded as the AE, not transaminase elevation). If a definite diagnosis is not available, then record the 
sign (e .g., clinically significant elevation of transaminase levels) or symptom (e .g., abdominal 
pain) as the AE.  
Clinical laboratory test results will be reviewed by the Investigator. The Investigator must 
determine the clinical significance of all out of range values. Clinical laboratory test with 
possibly drug- related or clinically relevant abnormal values of uncertain causality may be 
repeated. Any abnormal values that persist should be followed at the discretion of the 
Investigator. Laboratory reports will be initialed and dated on all pages by the Investigator. 
Clinical Laboratory Tests Outside the Normal Range: Any value outside the normal range will be 
flagged for the attention of the Investigator or appropriate designee at the study center. The 
Investigator or appropriate designee will indicate whether or not the value is of clinical significance. If the result of any test (or  repeat test, if done) from the samples taken during 
Screening  is indicated as clinically significant and is not covered by the inclusion or exclusion 
criteria in Section  8, the subject will not be allowed into the study. Additional testing during the 
study may be done if medically indicated. If a clinically significant abnormality is found in the samples taken after dosing, during the study, and/or at the EOS  visit, this should be recorded as 
an AE and the subject will be followed until the test(s) has (ha ve) normalised or stabilised.  
All on -site ECG tracings and ECG over -read reports will be reviewed by the Investigator. The 
Investigator must determine the clinical significance of all abnormal ECG s. ECG with possibly 
drug- related or clinically relevant abn ormal findings of uncertain causality  may be repeated . Any 
abnormal ECGs that persist should be followed at the discretion of the Investigator. ECG tracings will be initialed and dated on all pages by the Investigator. 
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  55 19 November 2017 12.3. Collection and Recording of Adverse E vents 
All pre -treatment events and AEs must be recorded in the subject’s study records/source 
documents in accordance with the Investigat or’s normal clinical practice. All pre -treatment 
events and AEs/all AEs must be recorded on the CRF. 
All AEs will be fo llowed until resolution, stabilization of the condition, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. 
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity , frequency , seriousness,  action taken with the 
study treatment, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy treatment. Definitions for severity , 
frequency , action taken with the study treatment, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy 
treatment  are presented below.  
The severity  of AE:  
• Mild  - Ordinarily transient symptoms tha t do not influence performance of subject’s 
daily activities. Other t reatment is not ordinarily indicated. 
• Moderate - Marked symptoms sufficient to make the subject uncomfortable. 
Moderate influence on performance of subject’s daily activities. Other treatment may 
be necessary.  
• Severe - Symptoms cause considerable discomfort. Substantial influence on subject’s daily activities. May be unable to continue the s tudy, and other treatment may be 
necessary.  
The frequency  of AE : 
• Once – an isolated episode.  
• Intermi ttent  – occurs on two or more separate occasions.  
• Continuous  – does not abate from date of onset to date of resolution. 
The action taken  with the s tudy treatment: 
• Drug Interrupted  – Study drug stopped temporarily. 
• Drug Withdrawn  – Study drug stopped perman ently.  
• Dose Not Changed  
• Not Applicable.  
• Unknown  
The outcome of the AE: 
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovering/Resolving 
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved 
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  
• Fatal 
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  56 19 November 2017 • Unknown  
The causal relationship of the AE to the s tudy treatment:  
• Not related  
o Not related  - Improbable temporal relationship and is plausibly related to 
other drugs or underlying disease.  
o Unlikely - occurred within a reasonable time frame after 
administration/discontinuation of the study drug, but there is a likely 
association of an  intercurrent/underlying medical condition or other drugs.  
• Related  
o Possible  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, but 
could be related to concurrent drugs or underlying disease. 
o Probable  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, is 
unlikely to be attributable to concurrent drugs or underlying disease, and there 
is a plausible mechanism to implicate the study drug. 
o Definite  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration and 
cannot be explained by concurrent drugs or underlying disease. The adverse event should respond to dechallenge/rechallenge, however, this is not 
mandatory before assigning a definite causality.  
The Medical Monitor is the initial contact person for protocol related questions or discussion of 
AEs. The contact information for the Medical Monitor as well as other emergency contact 
information can be found in Table 1 of this protocol. 
12.4. Immediately Reportable Events  
The following medical eve nts must be immediately reported to  the Sponsor: 
• SAE  
• Pregnancy  
Emergency contact information can be found in Table 1. 
12.4.1. Serious Adverse Event  
If the Investigator or study center  staff becomes aware of a SAE that occur s in a study subject 
after first administration of study drug through 30 day s following the last dose of the s tudy 
medication, this must be reported immediately to  the Sponsor whether considered related or 
unrelated to the study drug. SAEs must be recorded on the CRF and the data recorded should 
agree with that on the SAE form. 
Following the end of subject participation in the s tudy, the Investigator or an authorized delegate 
should report SAEs “spontaneously” to PPD -PVG if considered at least possibly related to the 
study drug.  
SAEs will be followed until resolution, loss to follow-up, stabilization of condition, or the event 
is otherwise explained.  
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  57 19 November 2017 In addition to the initial notification, an initial SAE form as applicable must be completed and 
signed and sent via fax or email  (see Table 1) to PPD -PVG within 1 business day of the 
Investigator or s tudy center staff becoming aware of the event.  The SAE form must be signed by 
the Investigator or appropriate designee. PPD -PVG provides the SAE form used to report SAEs. 
The Sponsor or designee will promptly notify all study centers and Investigators of a SAE that is 
determined to be expedited to the Regulatory Authorities in accordance with  applicable law (s) 
and regulation(s ). These SAEs must be promptly reported to the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) by the Principal Investigator  or the appropriate person at the study center  if required per 
IRB guidelines. 
12.4.2. Pregnancy  
Pregnancies  that occur from the time of informed consent /assent  through 30  days following the 
last dose of the s tudy medication will be collected and reported on the Pregnancy Event Form. 
If a subject  becomes pregnant during the course of the study, she /parent/legal guardian  will be 
instructed to commence discont inuation of the study medication. Further, t he subject / 
parent/legal guardian  (or female partner of male subject) will be instructed to return 
promptly/within 48 hours of the first notification of pregnancy to the study center  and undergo a 
serum  pregnancy test, as confirmation of pregnancy. If positive, the female pregnant subject will 
no longer receive any additional study medication. All pregnancies, whether or not the subject 
received any additional s tudy medication, will be followed until resolution (ie, termination 
[voluntary or spontaneous] or birth). 
To report a pregnancy, the Pregnancy Event Form must be completed and sent via fax to PPD -
PVG within 1 business day of the Investigator or study center staff becoming aware of the 
pregnancy. The Sponsor provides the Pregnancy Event Form. If the subject received blinded study medication, unblinding of the s tudy medication will be 
offered to the subject when knowledge of such treatment may have an impact on further 
treatment decisions. Otherwise, informatio n regarding to what treatment the subject was assigned 
may be provided when the s tudy has ended . 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medicat ion or other AEs were detected . 
12.5. Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor safety throughout the study. The 
DSMB will be independent of the Sponsor, CRO, and the investigators and will be empowered 
to recommen d stopping the study due to safety concerns. The membership of the DSMB and its 
mandate will be described in a separate DSMB charter.

STUDY/ DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY DRUG  
13.1. Criteria for Subject Termination  
Subject s may terminate th e study participation  at any time for any reason.  
The possible reasons for the termination of study participation  are as follows : 
• Adverse event.  
• Lack of efficacy (specify).  
• Lost to follow- up (specify).  
• Pregnancy.  
• Withdrawal by subject (specify).  
• Non-compli ance with study drug (specify) . 
• Protocol deviation (specify) . 
• Death . 
• Other (specify).  
If at any time during the course of the study, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject may 
no longer safely participate due to a change in medical status (e.g., e xperiences an AE, becomes 
pregnant), the subject must be discontinued from the study treatment . 
The reason for discontinuation and information will be recorded on the appropriate CRF. In case 
of death, the date of death should be captured on the CRF. 
Subje cts who prematurely terminate the s tudy participation may  be replaced.  
Subjects who discontinue study drug prior to completion will be asked to return to the clinic  and 
complete the EOS visit 7 (±  2) day s later (Section  11.5.3).  
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  59 19 November 2017 14. STUDY TERMINATION  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at this study center or at multiple centers 
for safety or administrative reasons at any time  while safeguarding that early termination does 
not compromise subjects’ safety or well -being . In particular, a study center that does not recruit 
at an acceptable rate may be closed . Should the study be terminated and/or the study center 
closed for whatever reason, all documentation and s tudy medication s pertaining to the stud y 
must be returned to the Sponsor or its representative. 
If, in the opinion of the Investigator, clinical observations suggest it may be unsafe to continue, 
the Investigator may terminate part or the entire study after consultation with the Sponsor. 
In the event of s tudy or site termination, subjects will be required to return to the clinic and 
complete the EOS visit 7 (±  2) days after their last dose of study drug and provide d with access 
to standard care.  
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  60 19 November 2017 15. STATISTICS  
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will  be applied to evaluate the treatment effect for the 
primary efficacy endpoint between the dasotraline 2 mg/day and placebo groups for the intent- to-
treat (ITT) population. The model will include treatment, mean SKAMP -Combined score at 
baseline, and site as fixed effects. The primary efficacy analysis will be repeated for the per 
protocol (PP) population. To explore the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis of change 
from baseline at Day  15 in ADHD symptoms in mean SKAMP-Combined score, 2 sensitivity 
analyses will be performed, a placebo -based multiple imputation pattern -mixture model (PMM) 
and a tipping point analysis using the PMM. 
A similar ANCOVA model, as described above, will be used for the secondary efficacy 
endpoints for the ITT population. 
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will provide details on the statistical methods planned for 
this study and will be finalized before the study  database lock (DBL).  
15.1. Sample Size  
A post- hoc ANCOVA -LOCF analysis of data from the SEP360-305 laboratory classroom study 
was conducted to examine the effect of dasotraline 4 mg/day versus placebo in a subset of 
pediatric patients  with ADHD aged 6 -9 years old. This analysis showed an effect size in this 
subgroup of 0.95 (LS mean difference at Week 2 was 7.2 with a standard error of 2.2). Assuming a smaller effect size for dasotraline 2  mg/day vs. placebo than that of dasotraline 4 mg/day vs. 
placebo, an effect size of 0.7 was utilized f or the sample size calculation.  
The .7 effect size also  derives from a  data analysi s showing that in a weight -adjusted dose range 
of 0.065 mg/kg to 0.115 mg/kg , the SKAMP effect size was observed to be 0.70. The weight 
adjusted dosing in the proposed study (SEP360-311) will likely range from 0.057 mg/kg to 
0.125 mg/kg  given that s ix yea r old females are expected to be the lightest subjects (CDC 
estimates 16  kg = 3rd percent ile). Thus, the estimated effect size of .7 is a reasonable assumption 
and will be employed in  the power and sample size calculation.  
Therefore, assuming an effect siz e of 0.7 for dasotraline 2 mg/day compared to placebo on the 
primary efficacy endpoint of mean SKAMP-Combined score obtained from the average of 
7 assessments collected across the 12  hour classroom day, 88 subjects (44 per treatment group) 
will provide 90% power to detect a treatment effect between dasotraline and placebo at the two-sided alpha level of 0.05, based on the two- sample t- test with equal variance procedure.  
The study will target approximately 100  subjects (50 per treatment group) randomized to either 
placebo or dasotraline 2  mg/day in an attempt to have 88 subjects complete the trial (assuming a 
12% overall dropout rate). 
15.2. Analysis Populations  
The analysis populations are defined below. Subjects will be analyzed based on the treatment to 
which they are randomly assigned.  
Protocol SEP360-311, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  61 19 November 2017 ITT (Intent -to-Treat) population: The ITT population is defined as all subjects who are 
randomized. The ITT population will be used for the efficacy analyses. 
Safety population: The safety population includes all subjects who are randomized and receive at 
least 1 dose of study medication. All safety analyses will be performed using the safety 
population. 
Per Protocol (PP) population: The PP population will consist of all subjects from the ITT 
population without any important protocol deviation (see Section  15.3.3). This supplemental 
efficacy population will be used to assess robustness of the primary analysis results. 
15.3. Data Analysis 
15.3.1. Subject Disposition  
Subject disposition will be summarized  for all randomized subjects. Subjects who complete the 
study and discontinue from the study will be summarized. The reason for discontinuation from the study will also be presented. 
15.3.2. Drug Exposure and Compliance  
A descriptive summary will be performed for exposure to study medication. Treatment 
compliance will be determined and summarized descriptively using the safety population. 
15.3.3. Important Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations (PDs) will be collected during monitoring visits. Protocol deviations will be 
placed, but not limited to, into the following categories: concomitant medications, dosing, 
enrollment inclusion/exclusion criteria, laboratory, non-compliance, and other. Each instance of a protocol deviation will be reviewed and determined to be important or minor before the study 
DBL.  
A summary of protocol deviations will be provided as number (%) of subjects with at least 
1 protocol deviation and number (%) of subjects in each category in all randomized subjects. 
The definition of important protocol deviations will be detailed in the study SAP and the subjects 
with important protocol deviations will be pre-identified (prior to unblinding of the study). 
15.3.4. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics (sex, race, ethnicity, age [years], baseline weig ht [kg], height [cm], and BMI 
[kg/m

Confidential and Propr ietary  77 19 November 2017 20. APPENDIX I. CARDIAC SAFETY M ONITORING  (ECG) 
1. Requirements for Testing  
ECG equipment and supplies will be provided by ECG Vendor and should be used for all in-
clinic protocol ECG assessments.  
• All 12 -lead ECGs will be re corded in the same manner.  
• The study center  personnel must be adequately trained in performing ECGs on the 
specific ECG equipment used in this protocol that is provide d by the cardiac safety 
vendor. 
• To the extent possible, the same ECG machine and personnel should be used to acquire a subject’s ECGs throughout the period of their participation in the s tudy.  
• ECGs will be recorded with at least one 10 -second single-lead tracing recorded from 
Lead  II. 
2. Subject Restrictions and Instructions  
• Prior to ECG acquisition, the subject will have rested 5 minutes in the supine position and will remain so until the ECG is obtained. 
3. Reporting  
• It is the responsibility of the Investigator to perform a safety review of the ECG data for changes from previous assessments and/or emergent cardiac dysfunction, and to determine subjects’ eligibility or continuance in the study.  
• ECGs will be reviewed, signed and dated by the Investigator listed on the Form 
FDA  1572 (MD or DO) after each ECG collection. The same Investigator should 
review all ECG reports for a given subject whenever possible. 
• For all ECGs, a report will be provided by the cardiac safety vendor to the study 
center  for review and signature. 
• The ECG tracing will be kept with subject’s source documentation and / or CRF 
unless it is specified otherwise. The original ECG and the cardiologist’ s over -read 
will be retained at the study center . 
4. Data Standardization 
ECG data will be transmitted to a centralized cardiac safety vendor and centrally over -read 
and interpreted using standardized procedures.

Confidential and Propr ietary  78 19 November 2017 21. APPENDIX I I. BODY MASS INDEX DETE RMINATION 
Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated by measuring the subject’s height and weight (both 
determined without subject wearing shoes) and using these measurements (in centimeters and 
kilogra ms) in the following formula.  
Formula:  
BMI = weight (kg)  ÷ [height (m) x height (m)]  
BMI will be automatically calculated at screening by EDC , and not by the site staff.

 BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
 Background  
AV-1 is a human monoclonal antibody ( mAb) being investigated as a potential therapy for 
dengue, a mosquito- borne viral disease with extensive global public health impact. Current 
treatment options for dengue are limited to supportive care. Thus, a safe and  effective therapeutic 
treatment would provide substantial public health benefits. 
Dengue virus (DENV) is a flavivirus transmitted by mosquitos of the Aedes genus and a major 
cause of disease in tropical and subtropical areas ( Henchal and Putnak 1990). Over 2 billion 
people are thought to be at risk of DENV infection globally ( Brady et a l 2012) with an estimated 
390 million infections annually (95% credible interval 284 to 528 million), resulting  in 
96 million clinical cases (95% credible interval 67 to 136 million) and 500,000 severe cases (Bhatt et al  2013; Guzman et al  2010).  
There are 4 known DENV serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3, and - 4). Exposure to any one serotype 
confers lifelong immunity to that serotype, however; subsequent exposure to a different serotype is associated with increased risk of severe disease. Data suggests that antibody -dependent 
enhancement due to subneutralizing antibodies may contribute to severe disease resulting from 
exposure to a second serotype ( Schmidt 2010; Dejnirattisai et  al 2010).  
While t he majority of DENV infections are asymptomatic or result in a mild flu -like illness 
lasting 4 to 10 days , the disease known as dengue can be severe and life-threatening. Signs and 
symptoms of dengue disease include fever (≥38.5°C), headache, retro-orbital or ocular pain, 
muscle and joint pain, macular or petechial rash, bruising, vomiting, abdominal pain, and 
enlarged liver. Clinical laboratory features typically include thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated aminotransferases ( Simmons et al  2012 ). The condition of some patients rapidly 
deteriorates after a 3- to 7-day febrile phase around the time of defervescence. During this 
critical period, which lasts 48 to 72 hours, some patient s develop a systemic vascular leakage 
syndrome with hemoconcentration, hypoproteinemia, pleural effusions, and ascites . Patients with 
clinically significant vascular leakage may develop persistent vomiting, severe abdominal pain, tender hepatomegaly, serosal effusions, mucosal bleeding , and lethargy or restlessness. These 
severe den gue cases may develop hemorrhage, hypovolemic shock, respiratory distress, and 
organ failure, requiring prompt supportive care measures and judicious intravascular resuscitation. Other complications include liver failure, myocarditis , and encephalopathy but 
these are less frequent ( Simmons et al 2012).  
AV-1 specifically recognizes a conformational epitope in the fusion loop of Domain II of the flavivirus envelope protein. The highly conserved epitope gives AV- 1 the potential for 
broad- spectrum antiviral activity against flavivirus es, including DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4, and 
limits the emergence of viral resistance. It is thought that AV -1 elicits its antiviral effects by 
reduction in viral load through inhibition of virus membrane fusion with the host cell, although 
Protocol AV1 -PPD -0005 Version 5.0 
Single Intravenous Dose of AV-1 in Healthy Adults  23 April 2021  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  19 mechanism of action studies to confirm this have not yet been performed.  AV-1 has leucine to 
alanine substitutions at amino acid positions 234 and 235 in its Fc component ( LALA  
substitutions), rendering it unable to bind to Fcγ receptors  and complement.  
AV-1 is manufactured from a stable Chinese hamster ovary  master c ell bank. The drug product is 
aseptically filled into vials with closure, resulting in a sterile injectable buffered solution suitable 
for clinical use. AV -1 will be administered  in the Phase 1a clinical study as a single intravenous 
(IV) dose prepared in United States Pharmacopeia grade sterile 0.9% s odium chlorid e (NaCl) in 
water for injection (0.9% NaCl). 
The target population for AV- 1 is anticipated to include those with suspected or confirmed 
dengue. 
 Scientific  Rationale  
2.2.1 Purpose of Study  
AV-1 has not previously been tested in humans. The primary objective of this study is to 
determine the safety of AV -1 in healthy male and female adult subjects when administered as a 
single IV infusion. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics ( PK) and the incidence of anti -AV-1 
antibody responses  will be studied. This first -in-human clinical safety study will provide 
important information to help guide further development of AV -1 as a potential countermeasure 
against dengue. 
2.2.2 Rationale for Study  
There are currently no approved treatments for dengue. AV-1, a fully human m Ab, is being 
developed to address this unmet medical need. The nonclinical s tudies supporting the potential of 
AV-1 are briefly summarized. A more detailed summary of the nonclinical studies is available in 
the investigator’s brochure ( AbViro , LLC 2019). 
AV-1 safety studies were conducted in compliance with Title  21 Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) Part  58 Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP)  for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies, including a 
human tissue cross -reactivity study and a 2-week IV dose toxicity and toxicokinetic study in 
Sprague- Dawley rats with a 1 -week interim necropsy and an 8- week recovery. The human tissue 
cross- reactivity study  showed AV-1 does not bind to normal human tissue. No AV-1- related 
deaths or adverse effects from AV -1 administered as either a single dose or multiple doses were 
observed in rats up to the highest tested dose of 300 mg/kg/day, which was the determined 
no-observed -adverse- effect level  (NOAEL)  dose. 
Nonclinical results suggest AV -1 has potential for treatment of dengue. In vitro studies showed 
AV-1 neutraliz es all 4  DENV serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3, -4), including 2 strains from each 
serotype prepared from recent clinical cases (2008 to 2016) and support the conclusion that DENV does not develop resistance to AV -1. In vivo , AV-1 protected 90 to 100% of AG129 mice 
(129/Sv, lacking receptors for interferon [IFN]- α, IFN -β, and IFN -γ, while keeping the adaptive 
Protocol AV1 -PPD -0005 Version 5.0

CONFIDENTIAL  20 immune system intact) from death for the duration of the study (10 days) when admini stered at a 
dose as low as 7.5  mg/kg prior to or 1  day after lethal challenge with DENV. These doses, given 
prophylactically, also resulted in reduction of virus levels in serum and tissues and reduced 
tumor necrosis factor alpha levels in serum. AV -1 prot ected 80% of mice from death for the 
duration of the study (10 days) when administered 2  days following the virus challenge at a dose 
of 37.5 mg/kg. Results from both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate AV -1 avoid 
antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV as a result of the LALA substitutions. 
The initial starting dose of 30 mg considers the standard maximum starting dose calculations as 
described in the FDA Guidance for Industry Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in 
Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers (DHHS  2005), which 
indicates a minimum 10  times  safety margin for selection of an initial clinical dose. The 
proposed initial starting dose provides a >90-fold safety margin when compared to the human equivalent dose NOAEL identified from the nonclinical safety study. The highest planned dose of 1000 m g was selected as it provides an approximately 3 -fold safety margin compared with the 
NOAEL.  
Doses will be increased approximately 3- fold for the initial low er doses (30, 90, and 250 mg) and 
then increased 2-fold at the higher dose levels (500 and 1000 mg). No drug- related toxicity is 
anticipated based on nonclinical safety data; however, the more conservative dose increases at higher doses will provide greater opportunity to assess and identify safety risks. 
The nonclinical data supports AV-1 safety and po tential efficacy and justifies the planned 
Phase 1a clinical study to assess AV -1 safety in a healthy adult population. The first step will be 
to conduct a Phase 1a safety trial. The study will be a double-blind, randomized, 
placebo -controlled, sequential -group, single-ascending dose study in healthy adult subjects. Five 
different doses will be tested in sequential cohorts of 8  subjects each , of which , 6 subjects will 
receive AV -1 and 2 subjects will receive placebo  per cohort. 
2.2.3 Study Population  
Because this is an exploratory Phase 1 a study to assess the safety  and PK  of a single IV  dose of 
AV-1, and to determine if subjects develop anti -AV-1 antibodies, the most relevant population is 
healthy subjects as recommended by the FDA ( ICH 1997). A combination of factors have been 
used to select the study population, including consideration of the patient population for AV-1, 
the estimated blood sample volume, and the stage of development. 
Both males and females aged 18 to 55 years will be enrolled in this study to represent the 
potential patient population who may receive AV-1 in future clinical studies.

 Potential Risks and Benefits 
2.3.1 Potential Risks  
No clinical trials in humans have been conducted. Nonclinical GLP-compliant safety studies 
have indicated no safety concerns. However, as this is a first-in-human for  AV-1, unexpected 
adverse events ( AEs) are possible in humans. 
Potential theoretical risks associated with the clinical evaluation o f AV-1 in humans include 
immune reactions to AV-1 or i ts excipients or unintended adverse effects related to the 
specificity of the antibody. Potential AEs may occur immediately  following infusion or be 
delayed  and may range from mild  to severe.  
Consideration to t hese potential risks was included in the design of both the AV-1 product and 
the first- in-human clinical study. Subjects will be screened to ensure enrollment of only healthy 
adult subjects without significant underlying medical issues or  history of hypersensitivity. 
AV-1 is a fully human mA b that reduces the risk of immunogenicity -related complications. 
Additionally, subjects will receive only a  single dose of AV- 1, further limiting risk of 
immunogenicity more likely to result from repeated exposures. A single dose will also limit 
exposure and allow reversibility of any treatment -related adverse effect s. The initial fixed 
starting dose of 30 mg allows for a >90 -fold safety margin based on nonclinical data based on 
the FDA guidance ( DHHS 2005 ). Sentinel dosing will be employed for each dose level to further 
limit the impact of unforeseen drug -related adverse safety outcomes.  
Risk of acute reactions will be managed through close monitoring of subjects during and following administration of the investigational product ( IP) infusion. Subjects will be admitted 
and remain in the clinical site beginning the day prior to the IP  infusion (Day –1) through 
discharge on Day  5 to allow for regular monitoring for hypersensitiv ity and both laboratory or 
systemic adverse effects of IP  dosing. Eight planned outpatient visits will follow subjects for 
approximately 120 (±5) days after dosing to afford an appropriate amount of time to observe delayed AV-1- related AEs  prior to subject completion of the study. Review of cumulative safety 
data will be performed prior to dose escalations.  
2.3.2 Potential Benefits  
There are no benefits to the subjects from taking part in this study. This study is necessary to characterize the in itial safety of AV -1 prior to additional clinical studies to further evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of AV -1 for treatment of dengue , an unmet medical need.  
2.3.3 Risk -Benefit Ratio  
AV-1 is a fully human mAb that lacks human tissue targets and has an unremarkab le nonclinical 
safety profile. The nonclinical profile of AV-1 indicated no safety signals and supports evaluation in humans starting at an initial dose of 30 mg. The clinical study design includes 
monitoring for potential risks of AV -1. No therapy is curr ently approved for treatment of DENV

 STUDY DESIGN, OBJECTIVES, AND END POINTS  
 Study Design Description  
This is  a Phase 1a, first- in-human, single- center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
sequential -group, single ascending dose study in healthy adult subjects. Five sequential cohorts 
of 8 subjects each (Cohorts 1 to 5) are planned for this study. The starting dose of AV- 1 will be 
30 mg and the planned doses for subsequent cohorts are 90, 250, 500, and 1000 mg. All 
references to the IP  within the content of the protocol apply to AV-1 and placebo. 
The study will consist of a screening period, check -in, a treatment period, and 8 follow -up visits 
for each cohort. 
Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibili ty to enter the study within 35 days 
prior to IP administration. Study site staff will obtain written consent per the standard informed 
consent process outlined in Section 9.2  before conducting protocol -specific screening activities. 
Eligible subjects will check in to the clinical site on Day –1 (the day before dosing). After 
reverification of eligibility, subjects will be  randomly assigned before dosing on Day 1 to AV-1 
or pla cebo  in a 6:2 ratio. In each cohort, subjects will fast overnight (nothing to eat or drink 
except water) for at least 10  hours before the start of the IP  infusion. Subjects will remain fasted 
for 4  hours after dosing with the IP . Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive AV -1 or 
placebo as follows: 
• Cohort 1: AV-1 30 mg  (n = 6) or placebo (n = 2) administered as an IV  dose  
• Cohort 2: AV-1 90 mg  (n = 6) or placebo (n = 2) administered as an IV  dose  
• Cohort 3: AV-1 250 mg  (n = 6) or placebo (n = 2) administered as an IV  dose 
• Cohort 4: AV-1 500 mg  (n = 6) or placebo (n = 2) administered as an IV  dose 
• Cohort 5: AV-1 1000 mg  (n = 6) or placebo (n = 2) administered as an IV dose 
Sentinel dosing will be used in each cohort as discussed in Section  8.2.3. In each cohort, the 
Investigator will review s afety data for the sentinel subjects and notify the Sponsor of intent to 
proceed with dosing the rest of the cohort with a minimum of 72  hours between dosing of the 
sentinel subjects and dosing the rest of the cohort . Safety data through Day 8 will be reviewed in 
a blinded fashion by the s afety review c ommittee (SRC) (Section  8.7.1 ) for each dose cohort 
before escalating to the next dose cohort ( Section  8.2.2).  Based on the review of safety and PK 
data, the Sponsor and the Investigator may choose to repeat a dose level, administer a dose less 
than the previous dose, escalate to a dose lower than the next planned dose, or prolong the 
duration of the infusion. 
On Day 5, subjects will b e discharged after all protocol- specified  assessments have been 
complet ed. Subjects will return for 8 follow-up visits on Days 8 ( +2), 15 (±2), 22 (±2), 29 ( ±2), 
43 (±3), 57 (±3), 85 ( ±5), and 120 ( ±5). Subjects will be asked to attend an early termination

Day 120 (±5).  
Safety, PK, and anti- AV-1 antibody endpoints will be evaluated in the study. Clinical laboratory 
evaluations, physical examination findings, vital sign measurement s, safety 12- lead 
electrocardiograms (ECGs ), incidence and severity of AEs, and incidence of serious A Es (SAEs)  
will be monitored to assess safety  (Section 7 and Section 8 ).  
Blood samples for PK analysis of AV -1 will be collected predose (within 15 minu tes); at 0.5, 
1 (end of infusion), 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours after the start of infusion; Day  5 
prior to discharge ; and at the follow-up visits on Days 8 (+2), 15 (± 2), 22 ( ±2), 29 (±2), 43 (±3), 
57 (±3), 85 (±5), and 120 (±5) (or ET ) (Section 7.2.2). 
Blood samples for anti -AV-1 antibody analysis will be collected on Day –1 and on Days 29 (±2) 
85 (±5), and 120 (±5) (or ET) to  evaluate for the presence of pre-existing or treatment -emergent 
anti-AV-1 antibodies . 
A blood sample will be collected at baseline for hypersensitivity testing and additional samples 
will be collected if a suspected hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylact ic response occurs 
(Section  7.2.4).  
Subjects will be confined to the clinical unit from Day –1 until discharge on Day 5. The planned duration for each cohort (screening to final follow -up visit ) is approximately 22 weeks.

 Withdrawal from the Study, Discontinuation of Investigational Product, 
or Study Termination  
5.2.1 Withdrawal from the Study or Discontinuation of the Investigational Product   
Subjects are fre e to withdraw from the study at any time upon request. Subject participation in 
the study may be stopped at any time at the discretion of the I nvestigator or at the request of the 
Sponsor.  
The Sponsor will be notified in advance whenever possible if subjects are stopped at the 
discretion of the Investigator. When a subject withdraws from the study  or is stopped, the 
reason(s) are to be recorded by the I nvestigator on the relevant page of the electronic case report 
form (eCRF).  Whenever possible, any subject who withdraws or is stopped from the study 
prematurely will undergo all ET assessments. Any subject who fails to return for final 
assessments will be contacted by the clinical site in an attempt to have them comply with the 
protocol. The status of subjects who fail to complete final assessments will be documented in the 
eCRF .  
The reasons for stopping subject participation by the Investigator or Sponsor include, but are not 
limited to the following: 
• The s ubject meets individual halting criteria (Section 8.6.2). 
• Subject noncompliance based on any of the following criteria after IP administration and 
before completion of all follow -up visits through Day 120 (±5):  
• Positive urine drug screen  
• Has major surgery  
• Received another IP  
• Uses prohibited medication 
• Receives blood products or donates blood or plasma 
• An AE  or new clinical finding(s) for which continued participation, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, might compromise the safety of the subject, interfere with the subject's successful completion of this study, or interfere with the evaluation of responses. 
• The s ubject is lost to follow-up. 
• Subjects becoming pregnant prior to  or following IP  administration prior to the final 
follow -up visit on Day  120 (±5) . Subject becoming pregnant after IP administration  will not 
be included in data analysis but will be followed for safety.  
If the subject consents, every attempt will be made to follow all AEs through resolution  
including those subjects that elect to withdraw . The procedures that collect safety data for the

subsequent informed consent using an IRB -approved consent form with the revised procedures. 
The Investigator will inform the subject that already collected data will be retained a nd analyzed 
even if the subject withdraws from this study.  
5.2.2 Subject Replacement  
Any subject who withdraws before completing the study but after receiving IP may  be replaced  
at the discretion of the Investigator and in consultation with the Sponsor . Any repl acement 
subject will be assigned to receive the same treatment as the subject he or she is replacing.  
5.2.3 Study Termination  
Although the Sponsor has every intention of completing the study, they reserve the right to 
discontinue it at any time for clinical or administrative reasons.  
If the study is prematurely terminated by the Sponsor, any regulatory authority, or the Investigator for any reason, the Investigator will promptly inform the study subjects and assure appropriate therapy or follow -up for the subjects, as necessary. The Investigator will provide a 
detailed written explanation of the termination to the IRB.  
The end of the study is defined as the date on w hich the last subject completes the last visit 
(including the ET visit and any additional long- term follow -up). Any additional long- term 
follow -up that is required for monitoring of the resolution of an AE or finding may be appended 
to the clinical study report.

 STUDY PROCEDURES  
Before performing any study procedures, all potential subjects will sign an ICF as outlined in 
Section 9.2. 
A complete schedule for all study procedures is detailed in the schedule of events ( Section 17.1 ). 
The IP will be administered in the clinical unit under direct observation of clinic personnel and 
will be recorded in the eCRF. Clinic personnel will confirm that the subject has received the entire dose of the IP. Complete information regarding any partial or interrupted infusions will be documented. The date and time (start and stop) of IP dosing will be recorded on the appropriate page in the eCRF. 
A study physician will be present at the time of IP administration and the subject will be under 
observation during the 60-minute infusion. Vital signs will be monitored,  and an ECG will be 
recorded  prior to, during, and after the infusion as outlined in the schedule of events 
(Section  17.1). The study site staff will observe the subjects closely for signs and symptoms of 
infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid type reactions. Should an 
adverse reaction of this type occur, the subject will be treated using the standard protocol at the 
clinical site. Infusion- related AEs and suspected hypersensitivity reactions will be documented, 
including the clinical presentation and severity (based on the grading scales in Section 17.2) of the event.  
For the specified time  points, PK sample collection will take precedence over all other study 
sampling procedures and will therefore occur at the nominal time as described in Section  7.2.2. 
Multiple non -PK study procedures scheduled at the same time point should be performed as 
close as possible to the nominal time  point (within 60 minutes predose and within 30 minutes for 
postdose time points). When procedures overlap or occur at the same t ime point, all blood draws 
should follow ECGs  or vital signs , and PK sampling should be timed to occur last and as close to 
the scheduled time window as possible. The total amount of blood collected from each subject over the duration of the study, including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 500 mL. Refer to the laboratory manual for specific details on blood volumes used for 
laboratory testing.

 DESCRIPTION OF CLINICAL AND LABORATORY 
EV ALUATIONS 
The timing and frequency of all safety assessments are listed in the schedule of events 
(Section  17.1).  
 Clinical Evaluations 
Safety endpoints will include monitoring and recording of AEs  and SAEs, clinical laboratory test 
results (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), vital sign measurements, 12- lead ECG  results, 
and physical examination findings. 
For all safety assessments, t he Investigator will determine whether results are clinically 
significant, which is defined as any variation in a result  that has medical relevance and may 
result in an alteration in medical care (eg, active observation, diagnostic measures,  or therapeutic 
measures). If clinical significance is noted, the result and reason for significance will be 
documented on the AE page in  the subject’s eCRF and t he Investigator will monitor the subject 
until the result has reached the reference range or the result at Screening, or until the I nvestigator 
determines that follow -up is no longer medically necessary . 
7.1.1 Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements will include systolic and diastolic b lood pressure, oral body 
temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate . The subject will have rested comfortably i n a seated 
or supine position for at least 5  minutes before all measurements are taken . For time points when 
ECGs and vital signs occur at the same time point, it is acceptable to perform the vital sign 
measurements approximately 2  minutes after the ECG as long as the subject remains resting in 
the supine position. Additional vital signs may be mea sured for safety of the subjects at the 
discretion of the I nvestigator. All measurements will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF.  
7.1.2 Twelve -lead ECG  
Twelve -lead ECG recordings will be obtained after the subject has rested  comfortably in a supine 
position, for at lea st 10 minutes. The Investigator should review and sign the ECG for any 
immediate issues. Electrocardiogram assessments will include comments on whether the tracings 
are normal or abnormal, rhythm, presence of arrhythmia or conduction defects, morphology, any 
evidence of myocardial infarction, or ST -segment, T -wave, and U-w ave abnormalities. In  
addition, measurements of the following intervals will be measured and reported: RR interval, PR interval, QRS width, and QTcF.  
7.1.3 Medical History  
Medical history will be obtained by direct interview  and include a history of significant medical 
disorders of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, cardiovascular system, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, 
Protocol AV1 -PPD -0005 Version 5.0 
Single Intravenous Dose of AV-1 in Healthy Adults  23 April 2021  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  37 liver, kidney, urologic, nervous system, blood, lymph glands, endocrine system, musculoskeletal 
system, skin, and genital/reproductive tract. A history of any allergies, cancer, 
immunodeficiency, psychiatric illness, substance abuse, and autoimmune disease will be solicited. The medical history will include current and past medical diagnoses, hospitalizations , 
and major surgical procedures. 
At each visit , subjects will be asked about any changes in health, new or worsening symptoms, 
or medications taken since their last visit. Any new adverse health changes will be recorded as an 
AE. 
7.1.4 Physical Examination  
A full physical examination will be performed at Screening (skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, 
neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, cardiovascular, abdomen, lymph nodes, and musculoskeletal system/extremities). Focused examination (lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen, and skin) will be 
performed at Check -in (Day –1) and on Days 5, 8, and 15. Targeted, symptom- directed physical 
examinations will be performed at all other follow -up visits. 
7.1.5 Assessment of Concomitant Medications/Treatments  other than the Investigational 
Product  
Restrictions for prior and concomitant medications and therapies are provided in Section  5.1.1 
and Section 5.1.2. Prior and c oncomitant medications and therapies will be coded using the latest 
version of the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary. 
7.1.5.1 Prior Medications  
Information regarding prior medications taken by the subject within the 30 days before signing 
the ICF will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF . 
7.1.5.2 Concomitant Medications  
The I nvestigator is responsible for ensuring  that details regarding the medication are adequately 
recorded in the subject’s source documents and in the eCRF.  Medication information will be 
recorded at the Screening visit for the prior 30 days and at Day –1. At each follow- up study visit, 
new concomi tant medication and changes to existing medications will be recorded. Any 
concomitant medication deemed necessary for the welfare of the subject during the study may be given at the discretion of the I nvestigator.  If a concomitant medication  is taken, except for  those 
specified in the protocol, a joint decision will be made by the Investigator and the Sponsor to 
continue or discontinue the subject based on the time the medication was administered, its 
pharmacology and PK, and whether the use of the medicati on will compromise the safety of the 
subject or the interpretation of the data.

 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
 Assessing and Recording Safety Parameters  
Subjects will be monitored throughout the duration of the study to assess safety of a single IV 
infusion of AV -1 as per the schedule of events ( Section 17.1 ). 
Safety assessments will include:  
• Incidence and severity of AEs 
• Incidence of SAEs  
• Physical examinations  
• Clinical safety laboratory tests  
• Vital sign measurements  
• 12-lead ECGs 
8.1.1 Adverse Events  
An AE is defined by ICH E6(R2)  as any untoward medica l occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product regardless of its causal relati onship 
to the study treatment. The FDA defines an AE as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of medicinal (investigational) product. The occurrence of an AE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study recipient presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study 
monitor.  
All AEs , including solicited local (infusion site) and systemic (subjective an d quantitative) 
reactions , will be captured on the appropriate data collection form and in the eCRF.  Information 
to be collected for AEs includes event description, date of onset, assessment of severity , 
relationship to the IP and alternate etiology (assessed only by those with the training and 
authority to make a diagnosis and listed on Form FDA 1572 as an Investigator), date of 
resolution , seriousness, and outcome. A dverse events occurring during the study collection and 
reporting period wi ll be documented appropriate ly regardless of relationship. A dverse events will 
be followed through resolution.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subjec t is screened will be considered 
as basel ine and not reported as an AE. However,  if the severity of any pre- existing medical 
condition increases , it will be recorded as an AE.  
Protocol AV1 -PPD -0005 Version 5.0 
Single Intravenous Dose of AV-1 in Healthy Adults  23 April 2021  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  42 8.1.1.1 Adverse Events Grading  
All AEs  (laboratory and clinical symptoms) will  be graded for severity and assessed for 
relationship to the IP  (see definitions  below). Adverse events  characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of onset and duration of each episode. The start and stop date of each 
reported AE will be recorded on the appropriate data collection form and eCRF. Changes in th e 
severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each 
level of intensity.  
Severity of Event:  Adverse events will be assessed by the Investigator using a protocol-defined 
grading system ( toxicity table included in Section 17.2). For events not included in the 
protocol-defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to quantify severity: 
• Mild (Grade 1): Events that are transient and may require only minimal or no treatment or 
therapeutic intervention and do not interfere with the subject’s usual activities  of daily  living . 
• Moderate (Grade 2) : Events that are alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but 
poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject . 
• Severe (Grade 3) : Events interrupt usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
Relationship to Investigational Product : The  assessment of the AE’s relationship  to the IP will 
be done by the licensed study physician indicated on Form FDA 1572 and the assessment will be part of the documentation process. Whether the AE is related or not,  is not a factor in 
determining what is or is not reported in this study. If there is  any doubt as to whether a clinical 
observation is an AE, the event should be reported. 
In a clinical trial, the IP  must always be suspect. The relationship to the IP  will be assessed for 
AEs using the terms related or not related:  
• Related  – There is a reasonable possibility that the IP caused the AE . Reasonable possibility 
means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and the AE . 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the IP  caused 
the event.  
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE  or suspected adverse reaction  is considered  an SAE if, in the view of either the  
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening AE1 
Protocol AV1 -PPD -0005 Version 5.0 
Single Intravenous Dose of AV-1 in Healthy Adults  23 April 2021  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  43 • Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions, or 
• A co ngenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalizations may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outco mes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include, but are not 
limited to,  allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitaliza tion, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
1An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life- threatening ” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor , its occurrence places the subj ect at immediate risk of death.  It does no t 
include an AE  or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death. 
Serious AEs will be:  
• Assessed for  severity and relationship to the IP  and alternate etiology  (if not related to the IP) 
by a licensed study physician listed on Form FDA 1572 or by the Investigator or 
subinvestigator. 
• Recorded on the appropriate SAE data collection form and in the eCRF.  
• Followed through resolution  by a licensed study physician (a physician listed on Form 
FDA 1572 as the Investigator or subinvestigator). 
• Reviewed and evaluated by the SRC, the safety monitoring committee  (SMC ) (if related), 
and the IRB. 
 Specification of Safety Parameters  
Safety will be assessed by the frequency and severity of:  
• Occurrence of SAE s from the administration of AV -1 to final follow -up visit on 
Day 120 (±5). 
• Occurrence of unsolicited AEs from the administration of AV -1 to the final follow -up visit 
on Day 120 (±5). 
• Occurrence of solicited  AEs from the administration of AV-1 to Day 8. 
Protocol AV1 -PPD -0005 Version 5.0 
Single Intravenous Dose of AV-1 in Healthy Adults  23 April 2021  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  44 • Occurrence of changes from baseline in physical examination, vital sign measurements , and 
clinical safety laboratory values from the administration of AV -1 to the final follow -up visit 
on Day 120 (±5). 
• Occurrence of changes from baseline in ECG parameters in the 48 hours after starting the 
AV-1 infusion and at D ays 8  (+2), 43 (±3), 85 (±5), and 120 (±5). 
8.2.1 Solicited and Unsolicited Events  
Solicited events are AEs that are common and known to occur following administration of the 
IP. Solicited events are defined in Table 17-1. 
Unsolicited events are any other AEs that occur following administration of the IP . 
8.2.2 Dose Escalation Criteria  
This study is designed such that dose escalation is allowed only after a blinded s afety da ta review 
of each cohort by the SRC has occurred  as outlined in Section 8.7.1. Study assessments (eg, AEs, 
clinical laboratory test results, vital sign measure ments, and 12- lead ECG results) will be used to 
evaluate safety of a given dose level. Dose escalation will be dependent on review of the safety data. Clinically significant results will be discussed with the Sponsor before dose escalation 
continues. Data from a minimum of 6  subjects dosed per cohort must be reviewed before each 
dose escalation.  
Based on the review of safety data and recommendations by the SRC, SMC, or both, the Sponsor 
and the Investigator may choose to repeat a dose level, administer a dose less than the previous 
dose, escalate to a dose lower than the next planned dose, or prolong the duration of the infusion. 
Before implementing any change, the IRB will be notified and provide d with the rationale  for 
approval. 
8.2.3 Sentinel Subjects  
As a safety precaution in this first -in-human study, each cohort is divided into 2 groups with 
each group being dosed at least 72 hours apart. On the first day of dosing in all cohorts, the first 
group in each cohort will be comprised of 2 s entinel subjects. The randomization schedule will 
be constructed such that one of the sentinel subjects dosed on the first day will be randomly 
assigned  to receive AV -1 and one of the sentinel subjects will be random ly assigned  to receive 
placebo. After Investigator
 review of the safety data from the 48-hour postdose period for the 
sentinel subjects, which includes review of any AEs, abnormalities in ECGs, safety laboratory 
assessments, and vital signs, the remainder of  the cohort (5 subjects randomly assigned to AV-1; 
one subject randomly assigned to placebo) will be dosed at least 72 hours after the sentinel 
subjects. Continuation from the sentinel subjects to dose the remaining 6 subjects will proceed if 
no study halt ing criteria are met as outlined in Section  8.6.3.

8.3.2 Regulatory Reporting 
Following notification fr
om the Investigator, P PD will report events that are both serious and 
unexpected that are related to the IP  to the FDA on be half of AbVi ro, LLC (the Sponsor) and 

Protocol AV1 -PPD -0005 Version 5.0

CONFIDENTIAL  46 within the required timelines as specified in 21 CFR Part 312.32: fatal and life -threatening events 
within 7  calend ar days (by telephone or fax). All written reports will be sent to th e FDA within 
15 calendar days. All SAEs  designated as “not related” to the IP, will be reported to the FDA at 
least annually in a summary format. 
8.3.3 Reporting of Pregnancy  
Subjects will be instructed that if they or their partner become s pregnant during the study, this 
should be reported to the Investigator. The Investigator should also be notified of a pregnancy 
occurring during the study but confirmed after completion of the study. In the event that a 
subject or a subject’s partner is s ubsequently found to be pregnant after the subject is enrolled in 
the study and has received the IP , the pregnancy will be followed through its resolution, and the 
status of the mother and child will be reported to the Sponsor after delivery.   
A pregnancy notification form and follow-up will be completed. 
 Type and Duration of Follow -up of Subjects after Adverse Events  
Adverse event s will be assessed and followed from initial recognition of the AE through 
resolution even if the duration of follow -up goes beyond the final follow-up visit. 
Serious AEs will be followed through resolution even if duration of follow -up goes beyond the 
final follow-up visit. 
Resolution of an AE is defined as the return to pretreatment status or stabilization of the 
condition with t he expectation that it will remain chronic.  
 Procedures to be Followed in the Event of Abnormal Laboratory Test Values or Abnormal Clinical Findings  
Results of laboratory values collected during the conduct of the study will be reviewed by the 
Investigator or designee within 24 hours of receipt at the clinical site . As this study will be 
conducted in healthy subjects, assessment of laboratory abnormalities will be performed in 
accordance with  the grading scale provided in Section 17.2, which is adapted from the FDA 
guideline, “Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials” ( DHHS 2007 ). The adaptation is applied to account for local 
laboratory normal values  and for compliance with the Clinical Data Interchange Standards 
Consortium . Any findings meeting Grade 3 criteria must be repeated immediately to rule out 
spurious values. All abnormal laboratory test values and findings on physical examination will be included in the study data and summarized in the safety analyses as described in Section  10.4.5. Any treatment -emergent AEs  that are appropriately graded according to the 
toxicity  scale in Section  17.2 will be captured as AEs in the eCRF.

CONFIDENTIAL  47 Abnormal laboratory values occurring during the study will be followed until repeat test results  
return to normal, stabilize, or a cause is identified. If the laboratory abnormality is identified at 
the final scheduled visit, the subject will be requested to return for additional testing.  
 Halting Rules 
8.6.1 Dose Escalation Halting Criteria  
If either of the following criteria is  met, escalation to the next planned dose cohort will not 
proceed until all available study data have been reviewed by the SMC. 
• Two or more subjects in the same cohort experience a Grade 2  related AE (laboratory or 
systemic) that is attributed to the study drug and coded under the same high- level term per 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities coding, throughout the duration of the study.
 
• Two or more subjects in the same cohort experience a Grade 3 AE (laboratory or systemic) that is coded under the same high- level term per the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities coding, regardless of causality assessment by the Investigator, throughout the 
duration of the study.  
If dose escalation is halted, the study may resume if deemed acceptable by the SMC following review of all available study data. 
8.6.2 Halting Criteria for Subject Infusions  
The I nvestigator and study site staff must carefully o bserve the subjects for any AE during the 
infusion.  
The i nfusion will be halted for an individual subject and will not resume if any of the following 
manifestations occur during the 1-hour infusion: 
• Occurrence during dosing that, in the opinion of the Investigator, results in the inability to 
have confidence that the intended dose of IP  was delivered . 
• Infusion- related  reaction of Grade 2 or higher . 
In case of a suspected infusion-related reaction, at the discretion of the Investigator, the 
infusion rate may be slowed from a rate of 250 mL/hour to a rate of 125 mL/hour for 
symptom management. The infusion may also be stopped. The subject will be observed to 
determine the severity of the reaction  for a period of up to 15 minutes . Depending on the 
assessment of the subject, supportive care can be administered, and the infusion may permanently be stopped. If the Investigator determines that there is no infusion reaction, no 
ongoing supportive care is required after dosing is stopped, or if the symptoms of  the clinical 
reaction have been improved after 15 minutes, the infusion may be restarted. The decision to

CONFIDENTIAL  48 continue the infusion is based on the assessment by the Investigator. The infusion will be 
halted if there is a reoccurrence after a pause in dosing. 
• Symptomatic low blood pressure of <90 mm Hg systolic or >30% decrease from baseline in 
systolic or diastolic blood pressure at predose. 
• Confirmed t achycardia with an increase in resting heat rate to ≥130 beats per minute (bpm), 
or development of ventricular dysrhythmia, or bradycardia (<45 bpm, or <40 bpm in subjects 
with baseline of <60 bpm) associated with complaints of dizziness, nausea, or feeling faint.  
• Syncope. 
• Confusion. 
• Suspected Grade 3  AE or SAE . 
8.6.3 Study Halting Criteria  
Study dosing must be stopped, and a review of available safety data will be conducted by the SMC if any of the following occur:  
• Death of a dosed subject following infusion and prior to the subject’s last follow -up visit that 
was not the result of trauma or accident, regardless of re latedness to the IP . 
• Occurrence of a life -threatening allergic/hypersensitivity reaction (eg , anaphylaxis) in any 
subject, manifested by bronchospasm with or without urticaria, or angioedema requiring hemodynamic support with pressor medications or mechani cal ventilation.  
• One subject with an IP- related SAE  of any grade. 
• Two or more subjects with a Grade 3 AE in the same system organ class (systemic toxicity, 
clinical laboratory tests , or vital sign measurements) considered related  to the IP , except 
scenarios where there are acceptable physiological explanations for a Grade 3 abnormality 
(eg, Grade 3 hematuria in a menstruating female).  
• One or more subjects experience a confirmed Grade 3 QTcF ( ≥500 ms ec or increase 
≥60 ms ec), or 2 or more subjects cumulatively have experienced  a Grade 2 change in QTcF 
(≥480 ms ec). 
 Safety Oversi ght 
8.7.1 Safety Review Committee  
The SRC is composed of the DMID Medical Monitor, Sponsor M edical Monitor, and the 
Investigator at the  clinical site. Objective dose escalation criteria and safety evaluations will be 
utilized. The Investigator will evaluate safety data from the sentinel group and notify the Sponsor 
Representative of intent to proceed if no study halting c riteria (Section  8.6.3) are met . The SRC 
will evaluate the safety data through Day 8 for each cohort to determine whether dose escalation

CONFIDENTIAL  49 can occur. These reviews do not necessitate formal meetings. The SRC will info rm the Sponsor 
Representative that the study can proceed to begin dosing the next cohort if none of the events 
described in the study halting c riteria (Section  8.6.3) or dose e scalation c riteria  (Section  8.2.2) 
are met.  
Should any of the study halting criteria or dose escalation halting criteria be met, the SMC will 
meet to evaluate the data and recommend appropriateness of further dosing. The decision to 
advance to the next dosing cohort will be documented and provided to the SRC and Sponsor Representative. 
8.7.2 Safety Monitoring Committee  
The SMC is an independent group of experts (at least 3 members) that monitor subject safety and advises the Sponsor. The SMC members will be separate and independent of study personnel participating in this s tudy and should not have scientific, financial, or other conflicts of interest 
related to the study. The SMC will consist of members with appropriate expertise to contribute to 
the interpretation of the data from this trial. A quorum will consist of a simp le majority.  
The SMC will review all available safety data during all scheduled ad hoc meetings:  
• When study halting c riteria or dose e scalation c riteria are met.  
• At the request of the Sponsor to review a potential safety concern identified by the 
Investiga tor, Sponsor M edical Monitor, or DMID M edical Monitor. 
• When an SAE occurs. 
Procedures for the SMC reviews and meetings will be defined in the SMC charter. The SMC will 
review applicable aggregate data including, but not limited to, enrollment, demographics, dosing, 
laboratory , and safety data at scheduled time points during the study as defined in the charter. 
The SMC may request to receive data by AV-1 versus placebo in a closed session. The SMC may also request that the blind be broken for ind ividual subjects, as needed, to assess safety 
issues. The SMC will make a recommendation to the Sponsor R epresentative in writing to 
continue, modify, or terminate the study as an outcome of each review or meeting.

 HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTION  
 Institutional R eview Board  
The Investigator will obtain IRB approval for this protocol to be conducted at the clinical  site 
and send supporting documentation to the Sponsor R epresentative before initiating recruitment 
of subjects. The I nvestigator will submit applicable information to the IRB on which it relies for 
the review, to conduct the review in accordance with 45 CFR 46, ICH E6 GCP, and as 
applicable, 21 CFR 56 and 21 CFR 50 ( Protection  of Human Subjects) , other federal, state, and 
local regulations. The IRB must be registered with OHRP as applicable to the research . The 
DMID C linical P roject Manager must receive the documentation that verifies IRB  approval for 
this protocol, associated informed consent documents, and upon request any recruitment material 
and handouts or surveys intended for the subjects, prior to the recruitment and enrollment of 
subjects.  
Any amendments to the protocol or consent materials will be a pproved by the IRB before they 
are implemented. Institutional  review board review and approval will occur at least annually 
throughout the enrollment and follow-up of subjects and may cease if annual review is no longer required by applicable regulations  and the IRB. The I nvestigator will notify the IRB of 
deviations from the protocol and reportable SAEs, as applicable to the IRB policy. 
Each institution engaged in this research  will hold a current FWA  issued by the OHRP for 
federally funded research.  
 Informed Consent Process  
Written informed consent in compliance with US Title 21  CFR Part  50 shall be obtained from 
each subject before he or she enters the study or before performing any unusual or nonroutine 
procedure that involves risk to the subject. I f any institution- specific modifications to 
study-related procedures are proposed or made by the clinical site, the consent should be 
reviewed by the Sponsor before IRB submission. Once reviewed, the I nvestigator will submit the 
ICF to the IRB for review a nd approval before the start of the study. If the ICF is revised during 
the course of the study, all active participating subjects must sign the revised form.  
Before recruitment and enrollment, each prospective subject will be given a full explanation of the study and will be allowed to read the approved ICF. Once the I nvestigator is assured that the 
subject understands the implications of participating in the study, the subject will be asked to 
give his or her consent to participate in the study by signing the ICF. A copy of the ICF will be provided to the subject.

 Subject Confidentiality  
Subject confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the participating I nvestigator, their study site 
staff, and the Sponsor and their agents. This confidentiality include s documentation, 
investigational  data, subject’s clinical information, and all other information generated during 
participation in the study. No information concerning the study, or the data generated from the 
study will be released to any unauthorized thi rd party without prior written approval of the 
Sponsor and the subject. Subject confidentiality will be maintained when study results are published or discussed in conferences . The study monitor,  or other authorized representatives of 
the S ponsor or governmental regulatory agencies may inspect all documents and records required 
to be maintained by the Investigator , including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, 
or hospital) and pharmacy records for the subjects in this study. The clinical  site will permit 
access to such records.  
All records will be kept locked and all computer entry and networking programs will be carried out with coded numbers only and with password- protected systems. All specimens, evaluation 
forms, reports, and other recor ds that leave the clinical site will be identified only by a coded 
number. 
 Certificate of Confidentiality  
To protect privacy, we have received a Certificate of Confidentiality . With this Certificate, the 
researchers cannot be forced to release information that may identify the research subject, even 
by a court subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. The researchers will use the Certificate to resist any demands for information  
that would identify the subject, except as explained below. 
The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the U S 
Government that is used for auditing or evaluation of federally funded projects, like this study, or 
for information that must be released in order to meet the requirements of the FDA. 
A Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the subject from voluntarily releasing 
information about themselves or their involvement in this research . If any person or agency 
obtains a written consent to receive research information, then the researchers may not use the 
Certificate to withhold that information . 
The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the researchers from reporting without the 
subject’s consent , information that would identify the subject as a participant in the research 
project regarding matters that must be legally reported including: child and elder abuse, sexual 
abuse, or wanting to harm themselves or others. 
The release of individual private information  or specimens for other research will only occur if 
consent was obtained from the individual to whom the information, document, or biospecimen

 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 Study Hypotheses 
No hypothesis will be formally tested.  
 Sample Size Considerations  
This study will enroll a total of 4 0 subjects in 5 cohorts of 8 subjects each and up to 8 subjects 
for replacements as necessary. Each cohort will consist of 6 AV -1 treated and 2 placebo treated 
subjects.  
 Treatment Assignment Procedures  
The PPD randomization statistician will generate the randomization schedule. The PPD 
randomization statistician will  not directly be involved in study conduct, data management, or 
data analysis.  The first group will be comprised of 2 eligible subjects (sentinel subjects) , with  
1 subject randomly assigned to receive AV-1 and 1 subject randomly assigned to receive 
placebo. The second group will be comprised of 6 eligible subjects (remaining cohort), with 5 subjects randomly assigned to r eceive AV -1 and 1 subject randomly assigned to receive 
placebo with an overall ratio of 6:2 in each cohort. Continuation to dose the remaining 6 subjects in the second group will be at the discretion of the Investigator following consultation with the Sponsor R epresentative. 
10.3.1 Randomization Procedures 
This is a double-blind study. Neither the subjects, the Investigator, nor the Sponsor will be aware 
of the treatment assignment. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive AV -1 or placebo in a 
6:2 randomization ratio. Access to the randomization code will be strictly controlled according to the standard operating procedures of PPD. 
10.3.2 Blinding  
The randomization list, as well as individual, subject -specific blind breaking documents, will be 
generated by the PPD ra ndomization statistician  and transferred to the unblinded study 
pharmacist prior to the start of the study. Pharmacy staff will store the subject -specific blind 
breaking documents in a tamper- evident container for afterhours access per standard clinic 
procedures. Study site staff participating in the administration of the IP  and assessment of the 
subjects will not be aware of the contents of the IV bag. It is not anticipated that AV-1 and 
placebo will be distinguishable; however, masking overlays will be employed to maintain blinding and ensure the study site staff and the subject cannot determine whether AV -1 or 
placebo is being infused . 
Protocol AV1 -PPD -0005 Version 5.0 
Single Intravenous Dose of AV-1 in Healthy Adults  23 April 2021  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  54 To maintain the study blind, AV-1 and placebo doses will be labeled with subject number, 
expiration date, expiration time , and volume. If the dose is not administered before the expiration 
time, a new dose should be requested from the unblinded pharmacy, if needed. The prepared 
dose, AV-1 or placebo , will be administered by appropriately trained neutral study site dosing 
staff as a single IV infusion over approximately 60  minutes by a controlled infusion device. 
10.3.3 Breaking the Blind 
Blind breaking envelopes will be prepared. A subject or subjects may be unblinded in the event of a dose- limiting toxicity, SAE, or other event, or if there is a medical emergency where the 
identity of the drug must be known to properly treat a subject. A cohort may be unblinded to determine if dose escalation to the next dose lev el will terminate. If a subject becomes seriously 
ill or pregnant during the study, the blind will be broken only if knowledge of the administered study drug will affect that subject’s treatment options. In the event of a medical emergency requiring identi fication of the IP administered to an individual subject, the Investigator will make 
every attempt to contact the Sponsor Medical Monitor to explain the need for opening the code within 24 hours of opening the code. The Investigator will be responsible for documenting the 
time, date, reason for the code break, and the names of the personnel involved. 
 Final Analysis Plan  
Prior to clinical database lock for this study, a statistical analysis plan  will be finalized. The 
statistical analysis plan  will detail th e analyses to be conducted, the statistical methods that will 
be employed, and the formats and content of the final tables, listings, and figures to be produced. 
10.4.1 Populations for Analysis 
The analysis populations are as follows: 
• The safety population will i nclude all subjects who receive the full dose of the IP . 
• The PK population will include subjects who receive the full dose of AV-1 and have at 
minimum all samples from predose through 1.5 hours from the start of infusion to have 
sufficient concentration data to support  accurate estimation of at least 1 PK parameter . 
10.4.2 Statistical Analyses  
Details of all statistical analyses will be described in a separate statistical analysis plan. All data 
collected will be presented in data listings. Data from subjects excluded from an analysis population will be presented in the data listings, but not included in the calculation of summary statistics.  
For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented. Continuous variables will be summariz ed using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation 
[SD], minimum, median, and maximum).

CONFIDENTIAL  55 All subjects receiving placebo across cohorts will be pooled into 1 treatment group for summary 
purposes. 
Baseline demographic and background variables will be summarized overall for all subjects. The 
number of subjects who enroll in the study and the number and percentage of subjects who 
complete the study will be presen ted. Frequency and percentage of subjects who withdraw or 
discontinue from the study, and the reason for withdrawal or discontinuation, will also be 
summarized.  
10.4.3 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Serum concentration data will be listed and summarized by time point for each dose level using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, SD, coefficient of variation [CV], minimum, 
median , and maximum).  Serum  concentration versus time profiles for each subject will be 
presented graphically. The mean serum  concentrati ons versus scheduled time profiles will be  
presented graphically by dose. 
The PK parameters of AV -1 will be analyzed based on the actual sampling times. All parameters 
will be calculated using the latest version of Phoenix
® WinNonlin® (Certara USA Inc., 
Princeton, New Jersey ) or SAS® (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, N orth Carolina). Pharmacokinetic 
parameters will be summarized by time point for each dose level using descriptive statistics 
(number of subjects, arithmetic mean, SD, CV, minimum, median, and maximum). Geometric 
means and geometric CV will be reported for AUC 0-tlast, AUC 0-∞, and C max. The following serum 
PK parameters will be calculated as data permit:  
Cmax Maximum observed serum concentration  
Tmax Time to reach maximum observed serum conc entration  
AUC 0-48 Area under the serum concentration -time curve from time 0 to 48 hours 
postdose, calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule method 
AUC 0-tlast Area under the serum concentration -time curve from time 0 to the last 
quantifiable concentration, calculated using the linear trapezoidal method  
AUC 0-∞ Area under the serum concentration -time curve from time 0 extrapolated to 
infinity, calculated as [AUC 0-tlast + (C t/λz)] where C t is the last observed 
serum drug concentration. %AUC exp must be <0.20 to retain AUC 0-∞ in the 
summary and statistical tables

parameters will also be listed to document the selection of data points used to estimate t 1/2 using 
noncompartmental procedures: 
%AUC exp Percentage of the area extrapolated for calculation of AUC 0-∞ 
λz Apparent terminal elimination rate constant  
Number of 
points Number of data points used to estimate λ z; a minimum of 3 data points must 
be used, and C max must not be included 
λz lower (h)  Lower bound used for the estimation of λ z 
λz upper (h) Upper bound used for the estimation of λ z 
Rsq r2, the coefficient of determination (goodness of fit statistic); visual inspection 
of the terminal slope wil l be performed. In general, λ z may only be retained if 
r2 ≥ 0.80  
Where data are available, AV -1 dose proportionality will be examined across the dose groups. 
The PK parameters will be analyzed for dose proportionality using a power model approach or 
analysis of variance model as appropriate. Additional analysis may be conducted if deemed appropriate. 
Dose proportionality will be tested using the power regression model for AUC
0-tlast, AUC 0-∞, and 
Cmax, defined as:  
ln[PK parameter ] =β0+β1ln[dose]  
where the PK parameter is an AUC or C max. The null hypothesis being tested is that the AUC and 
Cmax values are dose proportional, or slope (β 1) = 1.  
10.4.4 Anti -AV-1 Antibody Analyses 
Serum samples for measurement of anti- AV-1 antibody levels collected on Days –1, 29, 85, and 
120 ( ±5) (or ET)  will be analyzed by an ECL  ELISA method. The  proportion of subjects with 
detectable anti -AV-1 antibody responses prior to AV -1 dosing and treatment- emergent 
anti-AV-1 antibodies will be reported. 
10.4.5 Safety Analyses 
Adverse events will be coded by preferred term and system organ class using the latest version of 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and summarized by treatment and overall. All 
AE data wil l be presented in a data listing. Treatment -emergent AEs will  be summarized by 
treatment and overall, as well as by severity and relationship to the IP . Serious AEs and AEs 
leading to discontinuation of the IP  will also be presented in the data listings an d summarized by 
treatment and overall.

measurements, and 12- lead ECG results will be summarized by treatment at each time point 
using descriptive statistics ( number of  subjects, mean, SD, minimum, median, and maximum). 
Shift tables will be generated for clinical laboratory test results. Physical examination findings 
will be presented in a data listing.  
 Handling of Missing Data  
Concentrations that are below the limit of quantification (BLQ) will be treated as zero for 
descriptive statistics. Mean BLQ concentrations will be presented as BLQ, and the SD and CV will be reported as not applicable. Missing concentrations will be excluded from the calculations. 
For the PK analysis, BLQ values will be treated as zero with the exception that a BLQ value 
between 2 quantifiable concentrations will be set as missing. Missing concentrations will be treated as missing from the PK parameter calculations. If consecutive BLQ concentrations are followed by quantifiable concentrations in the terminal phase, those concentrations after BLQ 
concentrations will be treated as missing.  
 Interim Analyses  
No formal interim  analyses will be performed in this study.  A blinded safety data revie w will be 
performed  for each cohort before dose escalation is allowed  (Section  8.2.2).

 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
 Data Management Responsibilities  
All source documents and laboratory reports must be reviewed by the clinical team and data 
entry staff who will ensure that they are accurate and complete. Adverse events must be graded, 
assessed for severity and causality, and reviewed by the Investigator or designee.  
Data collection is t he responsibility of the study site  staff  at the clinical site under the supervision 
of the Investigator. During the study, the Investigator must maintain complete and accurate 
documentation of the study.  
PPD, the contract research organization, will serve as the statistical and data coordinating center  
for this study and will be responsible for data management, quality review, analysis, and study 
data reports. The Investigator is responsible to ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and 
timeliness of the data reported.  
 Data Coordinating Center/ Biostatistician Responsibilities  
Data collection is the responsibility of the study site staff at the participating clinical site under 
the supervision of the I nvestigator . During the study, the I nvestigator must maintain complete 
and accurate documentatio n for the study. 
The statistical and data coordination center  for this study will be responsible for data 
management, quality review, analysis, and reporting of the study data. 
 Data Capture Methods  
Clinical (including  AE/SAEs, concomitant medications, medi cal history, and physical 
assessments ) and clinical laboratory values  will be collected on data collection forms by study 
personnel then entered into eCRFs via a 21 CFR Part 11- compliant internet data entry system  
provided by PPD. The data system includes password protection and internal quality checks, 
such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate.  
 Types of Data  
Data for this trial will include clinical, safety, and outcome measures. 
 Study Records Retention  
Study records and reports must be maintained for a minimum of 2 years after a marketing application is approved for AV-1 for the indication for which it is being investigated; or, if no 
Protocol AV1 -PPD -0005 Version 5.0 
Single Intravenous Dose of AV-1 in Healthy Adults  23 April 2021  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  61 application is to be filed or if the application is no t approved for AV-1, until 2 years after the 
investigation is discontinued and the FDA has been notified. These documents will be retained 
for a longer period, however, if required by local regulations. Informed consent forms will be maintained as long as the sample/specimen exists.  
No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the Sponsor . It is the responsibility 
of the Sponsor to inform the Investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
 Protocol Deviations 
The I nvestigato r or designee must document and explain in the subject’s source documentation 
any deviation from the approved protocol. The I nvestigator may implement a deviation from, or 
a change to, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects without prior IRB approval. As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendments should be submitted to the IRB for review 
and approval, to the Sponsor R epresentative for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, if 
required. 
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures 
defined in the protocol. An important deviation (sometimes referred to as a major or significant 
deviation) is a subset of protocol deviations that leads to a subject being discontinued from the study, or significantly affects the subject’s rights, safety, or well -being or the completeness, 
accuracy, and reliability of the study data. An important deviation can include nonadherence to inclusion or exclusion criteria or nonadherence to FDA regulations or ICH E6(R2) guidelines. 
Protocol deviations will be documented by the clinical monitor throughout the course of 
monitoring visits. The Investigator will be notified in writing by the monitor of deviations. The 
IRB should be notified of all protocol deviations, if appropriate, in a timely manner.

procedures, study intervention administration, and data collection processes are of high quality 
and meet Sponsor , ICH/GCP guidelines and applicable regulations, and that this trial is 
conducted in accordance with the protocol and applicable standard operating procedures. PPD , 
the Sponsor , or its designee will conduct site -monitoring visits as detailed in the clinical 
monitoring plan.  
Site visits will be made at standard intervals as defined by the Sponsor and may be made more 
frequently as directed by the Sponsor. Monitoring visits will include, but are not limited to, review of regulatory files, accountability records, eCRFs, ICFs , medical and laboratory reports, 
and protocol and GCP compliance. Site monitors will have access to the c linical  site, study site 
staff, and all study documentation according to the Sponsor-approved site monitoring plan. Study 
monitors will meet with the Investigator to discuss any problems and actions to be taken and will 
document clinical site visit findings and discussions.

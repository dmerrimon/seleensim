CONFIDENTIAL    Protocol Synopsis  
Title:   Double- blind, Randomized, Multicenter, Placebo-c ontrolled, Parallel Group Study to 
Characterize the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of 24 Weeks of Evolocumab for Low Density 
Lipoprotein-c holesterol (LDL- C) Reduction, as Add-o n to Diet and Lipid-l owering Therapy, in 
Pediatric Subjects 10 to 17 Years of Age With Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH)  
Study Phase:   3b 
Indication:  Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in pediatric subjects  
Primary Objective:   To evaluate the effect of 24 weeks of subcutaneous (SC) evolocumab 
compared with placebo, when added to standard of care, on percent change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL- C) in pediatric subjects 10 to 17 years of age with HeFH.  
Secondary Efficacy Objectives:   to assess the effects of SC evolocumab compared with 
placebo, when added to standard of care, on mean percent change from baseline to weeks 22 and 24 and change from baseline to week 24 in LDL- C, and on percent change from baseline to 
week 24 in non- high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (no n-HDL-C), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), total 
cholesterol/HDL- C ratio, and ApoB/Apolipoprotein A -1 (ApoA1) ratio, in pediatric subjects 10 to 
17 years of age with HeFH  
Secondary Safety Objectives:   to evaluate the safety of SC evolocumab compared with 
placebo, when added to standard of care, in pediatric subjects 10 to 17 years of age with HeFH  
Secondary  Pharmacokinetic Objective:   to characterize pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure 
Hypotheses:   The primary hypothesis is that SC evolocumab will be well tolerated  and will result 
in greater reduction of LDL- C, defined as percent change from baseline to week 24, compared 
with placebo, when added to standard of care in pediatric subjects 10 to 17 years of age with HeFH.  
Primary Endpoint:  Percent change from baseline to week 24 in LDL-C 
Secondary E ndpoints : 
• Mean percent change from baseline to weeks 22 and 24 in LDL-C 
• change from baseline to week 24 in LDL-C 
• percent change from baseline to week 24 in the following:  
− non-HDL-C 
− ApoB  
− total cholesterol/HDL- C ratio 
− ApoB/Apo A1 ratio  
Study Design: This is a randomized, multicenter, placebo- controlled, double- blind, parallel group 
study.  Subjects are eligible for screening if they are 10 to 17 years of age at time of randomization and have met the local applicable diagnostic criteria for HeFH.  Subjects considered for enrollment will undergo screening assessments, including laboratory screening by central laboratory.  Approximately 150 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 24 weeks of QM evolocumab or placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by screening LDL- C 
(< 160 mg/dL [4.1 mmol/L] vs ≥ 160 mg/dL) and age (< 14 years vs ≥ 14 years).  
The study includes collection of biomarker development samples.  Where permitted by local regulations, subjects will be invited to consent to pharmacogenetic analyses.  
After completion of Study 20120123, subjects will be offered to participate in an extension study where they will receive open- label evolocumab.  
Sample Size:   Approximately 150 subjects will be randomized.

active infection, or major hematologic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal or endocrine dysfunction .  
Subjects are excluded if they have taken any cholesterylester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor in the last 12 months, mipomersen or lomitapide in the last 5 months, lipid apheresis within the last 12 weeks , or if they have  previously received evolocumab or any other investigational therapy to 
inhibit proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).  Subjects cannot be enrolled in 
another investi
gational device or drug study, receive other investigational agent(s) or procedures, 
or be within less than 30 days since ending another investigational device or drug study .  Female 
subjects of childbearing potential cannot be pregnant, planning to become pregnant, breast feeding or planning to breastfeed and must be willing to use acceptable method(s) of effective contraception  during treatment with IP (evolocumab or placebo) and for an additional 15 weeks after the end of treatment with IP (evolocumab or placebo).  
For a full lis
t of eligibility cr iteria, please refer to Section 4.1.1 through Section 4.1.2.  
Investigational Product 
Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:  Evolocumab and placebo are 
Amgen investigational product (IP).  IP will be administered SC using a spring- based prefilled 
autoinjector/pen (prefilled AI/Pen) .  Each prefilled AI/Pen will contain 1.0  mL deliverable volume, 
either 140 mg evolocumab or placebo.  
Non-Amgen Non- investigational Product Dosage and Administration:  Subjects will continue 
to use stable background lipid- lowering therapies as presc ribed.  These therapies will not be 
provided by Amgen unless required by law.  
Procedures:   Subjects being considered for participation in this study, and who have signed 
informed consent  or subject assent, will be assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Medical 
and medication history will be obtained.  Subjects will undergo screening assessments, including 
a SC administration of placebo to evaluate tolerability of the SC injection via the prefilled AI/pen.  
Lipid eligibility screening must be conducted after the subject has been on a low -fat diet and 
receiving lipid lowering therapy that includes an optimal dose of a statin not requiring uptitration in 
the opinion of the investigator  and has been stable for ≥ 4 weeks.  Subjects should maintain their 
diet, lipid -lowering therapy, and exercise regimen unchanged throughout screening and all 
phases of study participation.  Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive IP (evolocumab or 
placebo), in addition to their background lipid lowering therapy.  An interactive voice response 
system and/or interactive web response system (IVRS/IWRS) will allocate subjects to administration of investigational product.  Day 1 is defined as the day of first administration of investigational product.  Subsequent study visits are at weeks  4, 12, 20, 22, and 24 (EOS, 
end-of-study).  Day 1 and week 24 visits must  be scheduled at approximately the same time of 
day, and should be performed as close as possible to 8 am as the hormones measured have 
diurnal variation.  IP administration is every 4 weeks.  Administration at weeks 8 and 16 can be at

Protocol Number:  20120123  
Date:  01 September 2015  Page 5 of 84  
CONFIDENTIAL    the study site (optional visit) or at a location other than the study site.  Last administration of IP is 
at week 20.   Subjects who discontinue IP early for any reason will be asked to continue to return 
for all other study procedures and measurements until the end of the study.  
Assessments and procedures include vital signs, adverse events /serious adverse 
events /adverse device effects (ADE) /disease related events(DRE) /cardiovascular (CV) 
events , and concomitant therapy, dietary instruction, physical exam  including neurologic 
examination  and assessment of  waist circumference, body height and weight, 12- lead 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), fasting lipids, chemistry, hematology, anti -evolocumab antibodies, 
biomarker sample collection, serum pregnancy testing (females of childbearing potential), urinalysis, assessment of growth and pubertal development (Tanner staging), Cogstate neurocognitive assessment,  carotid intima -media thickness (cIMT), and IP administration.  In 
addition, specific laboratory assessments will be performed,  including  estradiol for girls, 
testosterone for boys, creatinine phosphokinase, follicle- stimulating hormone, luteinizing 
hormone, adenocorticotropic hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone, and cortisol.  If the subject consented to pharmacogenetics analyses, DNA will be extracted from some of the blood 
samples.  IP administration by SC injection, if applicable, will be done after all other procedures have been completed.   
For a full description of procedures, please refer to Section 7. 
Statistical Considerations:   
General Considerations  
Efficacy and safety analyses will be performed on the full analysis set (FAS), which includes all 
randomized subjects who have received at least 1 dose of IP.  
The superiority of evolocumab to placebo will be assessed for all efficacy endpoints.  
Methods of adjusting for multiplicity due to multiple endpoints are provided in Section 10.5.1  
Events of death, myocardial infarction (MI), hospitalization for unstable angina, coronary revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and hospitalization for heart failure will be adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC). Subject incidence of exploratory endpoint events will be summarized for each treatment group.  
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
To assess the primary endpoint of percent change from baseline in LDL- C at week 24, a repeated 
measures linear mixed effects model will be used to compare the efficacy of evolocumab with placebo. Missing values will not be imputed when the repeated measures linear mixed effects model is used.   
Analyses of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The statistical model for the secondary efficacy endpoints will be similar to  the primary endpoint.  
Safety Analyses  
Safety summaries will include the subject incidence of adverse events, summaries of laboratory parameters, vital signs, and anti -evolocumab antibodies.   
An independent data monitoring committee ( DMC) will formally review the accumulating data 
from this and other completed and ongoing studies with evolocumab to ensure there is no avoidable increased risk for harm to subjects.  Analyses  for the DMC will be provided by a group 
which is external to Amgen.

CONFIDENTIAL    2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Hypercholesterolemia and the Pediatr
ic Population  
Hypercholesterolemia (elevated serum low -density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL- C]) is an 
established risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) in humans ( Grundy et al, 2004), 
and more  than 50 million patients are treated for hypercholesterolemia in the United 
States and Europe ( Kuklina  et al, 2011 ; Kotseva et al, 2009; Tolonen et al, 2005).  
Cholesterol elevations requiring pharmacologic therapy are uncommon in children.  
However, patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an almost exclusively 
autosomal dominant condition most often resulting from deficient or defective LDLR function ( Rader et al, 2003), have elevated LDL- C beginning in childhood.  Since FH is a 
gene tic condition, the prevalence among children is very similar to the p revalence 
among younger adults.  
In the pediatric population, FH may be identified by the combination of elevated LDL- C 
and a positive family history of hypercholesterolemia and/or premature cardiovascular disease.  HeFH affects approximately one out of every 200 to 500 people worldwide (National Collaborating Centre, 2008;  Nordestgaard et al, 2013;  Rader et al, 2003).  By 
comparison,  homozygous FH ( HoFH ) is present in approximately 1 in 1,000,000 
individuals ( Goldstein et al, 2001).  Without treatment, these patients have severe 
hypercholesterolemia, develop premature coronary artery disease, and are at increased risk for premature cardiovascular death ( Rader et al, 2003 ). 
In the adult population, hydroxymethylglutaryl -coenzyme A (HMG -CoA) reductase 
inhibitors (statins) are currently the treatment of choice for both heterozygous FH 
patients and homozygous FH patients ( Grundy et al, 2004 ), as statins inhibi t 
endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis and upregulate LDLR expression (increasing the 
activity of functional LDLR) ( Rader et al, 2003).  Although statins reduce mortality in this 
patient population ( Raal et al, 2011), cholesterol levels may remain elevated in FH 
patients despite therapy with diet, exercise, and medications .  
Pediatric guidelines in the United States ( Daniels and Greer, 2008;  
McCrindle et al, 2007;  Kavey et al, 2006) recommend considering pharmacologic

Date:  01 September 2015  Page 17 of 84 
CONFIDENTIAL    treatment after initial treatment with lifestyle modification has failed in patients ≥ 10 years 
of age with LDL -C that is : 
 ≥ 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) for the highest risk (eg, diabetes mellitus)  
 ≥ 160 mg/dL (4.1 mmol/L) for intermediate risk (eg, ≥  2 other CHD risk factors, 
family history of prem ature coronary artery disease [ CAD]) 
 ≥ 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) for the lowest risk (no cardiovascular risk factors)  
Similarly, treatment guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology and European 
Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS; Reiner et al, 2011) and from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE;  National Collaborating Centre, 2008) recommend 
statin treatment in patients who are ≥ 10 years of age and have HeFH or HoFH , and 
consider pharmacologic treatment for subjects with HoFH at earlier ages (Reiner  et al, 2011).  When a child with FH has exceptionally high LDL- C and/or 
cardiovascular risk , bile  acid sequestrants and ezetimibe are also indicated and may be 
used in combination.  
Thus, while currently available therapies can reduce LDL- C levels, novel therapies that 
can be used alone or in combination with existing agents  to more effectively reduce 
LDL-C would be valuable for both adults and pediatric patients with severely elevated 
cholesterol levels.  
2.2 Amgen Investigational Product   
2.2.1  Background and Nonclinical Studies  
Recycling of the hepatic cell surface low -density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) plays a 
critical role in regulating serum LDL- C levels.  Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 
type 9 (PCSK9) binds to the LDLR and d own regulates  hepatic cell surface LDLR, 
which, in turn, leads to increased levels of circulating LDL- C.  Humans with PCSK9 
loss-of-function mutations have cholesterol levels lower than normal and reduced 
incidence of CHD ( Abifadel et al, 2009 ).  Evolocumab (formerly referred to as AMG 145) 
is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2), developed at Amgen Inc., that 
specifically binds to PCSK9 preventing its interaction with the LDLR.  The inhibition of 
PCSK9 by evolocumab leads to increased LDLR expression and subsequent decreased 
circulating concentrations of LDL- C. 
Evolocumab binds to human, cynomolgus monkey, and hamster PCSK9 with a similar high affinity (dissociation equilibrium constant [ K
D] = 16, 8, and 14  pM, respectively)  and 
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120123  
Date:  01 September 2015  Page 18 of 84 
CONFIDENTIAL    is pharmacologically active in both animal species.  Evolocumab exhibited nonlinear PK 
consistent with target -mediated elimination and a low volume of distribution (V ss/F) 
indicating limited tissue distribution.  A concentration- response relationship was 
observed between serum unbound evolocumab, free PCSK9, and LDL- C. 
Evolocumab- related effects were limited to expected pharmacology (serum LDL- C and 
total cholesterol lowering).  Toxicological assessments included repeated dose studies in the hamster and cynomolgus monkey (up to 3- and 6- months, respectively) at 
evolocumab dose levels up to 300 mg/kg, a 3 -month repeated dose study in the 
cynomolgus monkey in which evolocumab was dosed in combination with rosuvastatin, a hamster carcinogenicity study, a hamster fertility study, and an enhanced pre -post 
natal development study in the cynomolgus monkey.  No evolocumab-related adverse effect was observed in any study.  
Refer to the specific sections of the AMG 145 Investigators Brochure  for additional 
information r elated to the physical, chemical, and pharmaceutical properties of 
evolocumab.  
2.2.2  Clinical Studies  
Evolocumab is intended for long- term use and has been evaluated in approximately 
6800 subjects in 26 clinical studies to date.  Regulatory submissions have been filed in 
several jurisdictions, including to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) in the United 
States and to the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) in Europe .  The submissions are 
based on a phase 3 program which evaluated evolocumab administered every tw o 
weeks and monthly in various treatment settings (ie, in combination with statins, 
statin -intolerant, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [HeFH] or as an adjunct to 
diet [monotherapy]).  Additional studies with evolocumab are ongoing or planned, including studies to provide additional long- term safety and efficacy data,  studies  to 
determine the effect of evolocumab on coronary atherosclerosis,  and studies  to evaluate 
the effects of evolocumab on lipoprotein metabolism.   The FOURIER trial is a large 
cardiovascular outcomes trial  that is ongoing.  
The combined PK data including phase 1, 2 and 3 studies  have consistently show n that 
evolocumab displays approximately dose- proportional increases in exposure for 
repeated dose regimens ≥  140 mg SC. 
Pharmacodynamic (PD) studies explored LDL- C and unbound PCSK9 responses after 
administration of a wide range of SC doses and dosing frequencies.  With the 140 mg

CONFIDENTIAL    once every 2 weeks (Q2W) and 420 mg QM (once monthly) regimens, maximal LDL- C 
reduction was observed at 1 week or 2  weeks following administration, respectively, and 
returned towards baseline at the end of the dosing interval. 
A side -by-side analysis of efficacy across the individual phase 3 primary hyperlipidemia 
and mixed dyslipidemia studies dem onstrated the following for evolocumab administered 
140 mg Q2W and 420 mg QM:  
• Evolocumab was superior to placebo in reducing LDL- C (approximately 55% to 75% 
compared with placebo), total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), non -high density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (non- HDL-C), total cholesterol /high -density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (HDL- C), and ApoB/apolipoprotein A1(ApoA1) very low -density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL- C), triglycerides, lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), and increasing 
HDL-C and ApoA1.  
• Evolocumab reduced LDL- C as early as week 1 following administration, generally 
achieved maximal response within 1 to 2 weeks after dosing with 140  mg Q2W and 
420 mg QM, respectively, and maintained efficacy with long -term use.  
• Reductions in LDL- C and improvements in other lipid parameters were reversible 
upon cessation of treatment, with no evidence of rebound.  
• Evolocumab 140 mg Q2W and 420 mg QM dosing regimens were clinically 
equivalent; no clinically meaningful differences, with respect to reductions in LDL- C 
and improvements in other lipid parameters, were noted between the 2 doses.  
• Evolocumab 140 mg Q2W and 420 mg QM dosing regimens were effective in all subgroups relative to placebo and ezetimibe with no notable differences observed 
among subgroups (ie, age, race, gender, region, body mass index, current smoking 
status, baseline CHD risk factors, family history of premature CHD, glucose tolerance status [diabetes mellitus type 2, metabolic syndrome, or neither], 
hypertension, unbound baseline PCSK9, baseline LDL- C, baseline triglycerides, and 
National Cholesterol Education Program [NCEP] , 2002 high risk status).  
• Administration of evolocumab with the prefilled autoinjector/pen (AI/pen) was shown 
to be safe and effective for its intended use and the conditions of use,  including 
self-administration in the home- use setting.  
The results of the analyses conducted in the primary hyperlipidemia (heterozygous 
familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia integrated safety analysis set for evolocumab demonstrated the following with respect to safety:  
• In the integrated parent studies, the most common ( ≥ 2%) adverse events in the 
combined evolocumab group or control group were nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection, headache, back pain, and myalgia.  Common adverse 
events in the year  1 standard of care (SoC) -controlled period did not include 
headache and myalgia; otherwise, common adverse events were the same as integrated parent studies with the addition of arthralgia and hypertension.  There 
were no additional common adverse events during the year 2+ open- label ex tension 
(OLE) period.

CONFIDENTIAL    • The types and incidence of adverse events were consistent across studies where 
evolocumab was given as monotherapy, in combination therapy with statins (with or 
without ezetimibe) or in subjects with statin intolerance.  
• Most  adverse events were grade 1 or  2. 
• Serious adverse events, deaths, positively adjudicated clinical events, and adverse 
events leading to discontinuation of investigational product (IP) were infrequently 
repor ted and similar across treatment groups.  
• No safety issues were detected for adverse events of interest associated with other 
lipid-lowering therapies (ie, diabetes adverse events, liver-related adverse  events, 
muscle- related adverse  events , neurocognitive adverse events) and those that could 
theoretically be associated with PCSK9 inhibition/LDL- C receptor upregulation (ie, 
hepatitis C events).   No cognitive adverse events have been reported among 
adolescents in the completed Study 20110233 or in the ongoing open- label 
evolocumab- only Study 20110271. 
• The device- related adverse events from the 3 SC presentations (ie, pre-filled syringe 
[PFS] , prefilled AI/pen, and automated mini doser [ AMD ]) were uncommon, mostly 
grade 1, and generally limited to injection site reactions.  
• An evaluation of vitamin E data showed that long- term evolocumab exposure 
(52 weeks) did not change normalized vitamin E levels, regardless of LDL -C 
concentration.  Similarly, long- term evolocumab exposure (52 weeks) did not affect 
steroid hormone levels (cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, follicle -stimulating 
hormone, luteinizing hormone, testosterone, or estradiol), regardless of LDL- C 
concentration.  
• The type and incidence of adverse events observed in subjects with LDL- C 
concentrations < 25  mg/dL (< 0.6 mmol/L) and < 40 mg/dL (< 1.0 mmol/L) were 
similar to those observed in subjects with LDL- C concentrations ≥ 40 mg/dL  
(≥ 1.0 mmol/L) .  In particular, no safety signal was identified for neurocognitive 
adverse events, vitamin E levels, or steroid analytes based on LDL- C concentrations.  
• Presence of anti -evolocumab antibodies was infrequent, non- neutralizing, and not 
associated with clinically relevant adverse events.  
Refer to the AMG 145 Investigators Brochure  for additional information re garding the 
clinical experience with evolocumab.  
2.3 Pediatric Risk Assessment  
Loss -of-function (LOF) mutations of the PCSK9 gene are associated with low serum 
LDL-C levels ( ≤ 100 mg/dL [2.6 mmol/L]) (Cohen et al, 2005).  Subjects with 
heterozygous PCSK9 LOF mutations exhibit lower serum PCSK9 levels and as much as 
88% reduction in the incidence of CHD over a 15- year period compared with noncarriers 
of the mutations ( Cohen et al, 2006).  Importantly, despite complete loss of PCSK9 and 
associated very low serum LDL -C levels (<  20 mg/dL [0.5  mmol/L]), 2  subjects with 
LOF mutations in both PCSK9 alleles appear healthy ( Hooper et al, 2007; Zhao 2006).

CONFIDENTIAL    The subjects in this study are a pediatric population.  In Amgen’s development program 
for evolocumab, 2 studies to date have included pediatric subjects along with adults.  The completed Study 20110233 was a phase 2/3 study of subjects 12 to 80 years of age with HoFH; Part A of Study 20110233 was an open -label pilot study in 8 subjects and 
Part B of Study 20110233 was a randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled study of 
49 subjects ( Raal et al., 2014) .  The ongoing Study 20110271 is a phase 2/3, 
multicenter, open -label study of evolocumab  in approximately 310  subjects 12 to 
80 years of age with severe FH . 
To date, 15 subjects <  18 years of age and with HoFH or compound HeFH have been 
enrolled in Studies 20110233 and 20110271; 10 participated in both studies, 4 participated only in Study 20110271, and 1 participated only in Study 20110233.  
Based on the most recent data cut off of 01 July 2014, all adolescent subjects in Study  20110271 have HoFH.  Per protocol, the non- apheresis subjects (n=10) began 
the study on 420 mg QM, while the apheresis subjects (n=4) began the study on 420 mg 
Q2W.  In general, no differences in the safety profile have been seen in pediatric 
subjects relative to adults.  In Study 20110271, the subject incidences of treatment emergent adverse events and serious adverse events were 71% and 14% among adolescents, compared to 68% and 10% among all subjects with HoFH.  Average exposure to evolocumab was longer among adolesc ents, median 11.4 months vs 
7.5 months in adults with HoFH.  Among pediatric subjects, a total of 28 adverse events 
have been reported in Study 20110271.  All but 2 of these events were deemed non-serious and were Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
grade 1 or 2.  The 2 serious adverse events (worsening of chest pain and occlusive 
coronary artery disease) were both CTCAE grade 3 and unrelated to IP, and are both known cardiovascular consequences of the subjects’ underlying FH.  No serious adverse events were deemed by the investigator to be related to evolocumab. 
The dose of 420 mg evolocumab SC was selected based on pharmacokinetic modeling 
for this pediatric age group (Section 2.4) and is supported by the current safety 
experience with the same dosing in pediatric subjects in Studies 20110233 and 20110271.  
As in studies with adult subject, the subjects in this study wi ll be monitored for the 
development of anti- evolocumab antibodies.  To date, the overall immunogenicity rate is 
< 1% and the formation of neutralizing anti -evolocumab antibodies has not been 
observed.

CONFIDENTIAL    Volumes of blood withdrawn for analysis will be minimized as appropriate for this 
pediatric population. 
2.4 Rationale  
FH is a genetic disorder which typically requires lifelong treatment, sometimes beginning 
in childhood.  It is therefore important to study the safety and efficacy of potential treatments for FH in children and adolescents.  Because developmental processes that are complete in adults are ongoing in children and adolescents, additional safety assessments (eg, biochemical and clinical assessments of puberty, carotid intimal medial thickness, and cognition) are also appropriate.  Data from a dedicated randomized placebo- controlled study of evolocumab and adolescents will support the 
existing data from nonclinical studies in ages corresponding to human adolescence and 
clinical data from adolescent subjects participating in the TESLA and TAUSSIG studies.  
The safety and efficacy of evolocumab 420 mg SC QM in adults have been extensively 
studied in phase  2 and phase 3 clinical trials.   Additionally, in the two studies that have 
included pediatric subjects (TESLA and TAUSSIG), evolocumab lowered LDL- C and 
other lipid parameters in subjects aged 12- 17 years.  The percent change from baseline 
in LDL -C has been chosen as the primary assessment for this study because of the 
extensive body of data from interventional studies and epidemiological evidence 
demonstrating a strong causal relationship between serum LDL cholesterol, and the risk of CHD.  These data also support  the relationship with other clinical manifestations of 
atherosclerosis such as cerebrovascular disease (stroke) or peripheral vascular disease.  These relationships are present over a broad range of LDL- C levels.  Additionally, 
current guidelines focus on LDL- C as a target for  therapy.  
Non-HDL cholesterol (non- HDL-C), ApoB, the ratio of total  cholesterol/HDL- C, the ratio 
of ApoB/ApoA1, and Lp(a) have been included as secondary efficacy endpoints because these markers are known as useful markers of cardiovascular risk under cert ain 
circumstances and because they may be employed as future targets for lipid lowering therapy.  
Additional endpoints include triglycerides and HDL- C because data in adults 
demonstrates lowering of triglycerides and raising of HDL- C with evolocumab.  In 
addition, triglycerides and HDL- C are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease 
(Austin et al, 1998 ; Sarwar et al, 2007).

CONFIDENTIAL    Pharmacokinetic data from the 2 studies with evolocumab that included adults as well as 
pediatric subjects age 12 years and older (Studies 20110233 and 20110271) show that 
exposure among pediatric  subjects  is comparable to that seen in adults of similar weight .  
Further pharmacokinetic modeling to predict the optimal dosing regimen for pediatric 
subjects 10 to 17 years of age shows that the exposure with monthly administration of 
420 mg evolocumab SC in these subjects is expected to fall  within in the range observed 
to date in the evolocumab development program . 
2.5 Clinical Hypotheses 
The primary hypothesis is that SC evolocumab will be well tolerated  and will result in 
greater reduction of LDL- C, defined as percent change from baseline to week 24, 
compared with placebo, when added to standard of care in pediatric subjects 10 to 17 years of age with HeFH  
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design 
This is a randomized, placebo- controlled, double- blind, parallel group, multicenter study. 
Subjects are eligible for screening if they are 10 to 17 years of age at time of 
randomization and have met the local applicable diagnostic criteria for HeFH.  Subjects 
considered for enrollment will undergo screening assessments, including laboratory screening by central laboratory.  Approximately 150 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 24 weeks of QM evolocumab or placebo.  Randomization will be stratified  by screening LDL- C (< 160 mg/dL [4.1 mmol/L] vs ≥ 160 mg/dL) and age 
(< 14 years vs ≥ 14 years)  at randomization. 
The study includes collection of biomarker development samples.  Where permitted by local regulations, subjects will be invited to consent to pharmacogenetic analyses.  
Events of death, myocardial infarction (MI), hospitalization for unstable angina, coronary revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and hospitalization for heart failure will be adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC). Subject incidence of exploratory endpoint events will be summarized for each treatment group.   
Processes of event identification and submission to the CEC are described in a CEC 
Endpoint Reporting Manual.  
An independent data monitoring committee ( DMC ) will formally review the accumulating 
data from this and other completed and ongoing studies with evolocumab to ensure

5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Before subjects begin participat ion in any study -specific activities/procedures, Amgen 
requires a copy of the site’s written IRB/IEC approval of the protocol, 
AMG  145 Investigator’s Brochure  (IB), informed consent form (ICF), and all other subject 
information and/or recruitment material, if applicable (see Section 11.2).  All subjects o r 
parents/ legally acceptable representatives must personally sign and date the informed 
consent form or subject assent form before commencement of study -specific 
activities/procedures.  
Each subject who enters into the screening period for the study receives a unique 
subject identification number before any study -related activities/procedures are 
performed.  The subject identification number will be assigned by the IVR S/IWR S.  The 
investigator or designee must contact the IVRS /IWR S to register subjects once the 
informed consent, and subject assent  if applicable, is signed to obtain the unique subject 
identification number.  This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject.  
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120123  
Date:  01 September 2015  Page 28 of 84 
CONFIDENTIAL    The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical 
study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is rescreened.  
A subject is considered  enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met 
all eligibility criteria. The investigator is to document this decision and date, in the 
subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment CRF. 
5.1 Randomization /Treatment Assignment  
Assignment to the 2 treatment arms ( Section 3.1) will be based on a 
computer -generated randomization schedule prepared by Amgen before the start of the 
study.  
Each subject will receive a unique randomization number and each randomization 
number will only be assigned to 1 subject.  Randomization will be stratified by screening 
LDL-C (< 160 mg/dL [4.1 mmol/L] vs ≥ 160 mg/dL) and age (< 14 years vs ≥ 14 years)  at 
time of  randomization. 
Once the investigator decides that a subject has met all eligibility criteria, a site 
representative will make the randomization call to the IVRS/IWRS to assign a randomization number to the subject.  The randomization call to the IVR S/IWRS is 
accomplished by entering the pertinent information as detailed in the IVRS/IWRS user manual.  A confirmation fax or email will be sent to the site to verify that the correct information has been entered and to confirm the assignment of a randomization number.  
The randomization date is to be documented in the subject’s medical record and on the 
enrollment electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 
5.2 Site Personnel Access to Individual Treatment Assignments  
A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment is essential for the further management of the subject  on this study .  
Unblinding at the study site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation.   
The investigator  is strongly encouraged to contact the Amgen Clinical Study Manager  
before unblinding any subject’s treatment assignment, but must do so within 1 working 
day after the event.  
6. TREATMENT PROCEDURES  
6.1 Classification of Products and Medical Devices 
The Amgen investigational medicinal products used in this study include: evolocumab 
and matching placebo . 
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120123  
Date:  01 September 2015  Page 29 of 84 
CONFIDENTIAL    The medical device used in this study is the prefilled autoinjector/pen (AI/Pen) . 
An Investigational Product Instruction Manual (IPIM) and the Instructions For Use (IFU), 
documents external to this protocol, contain detailed information regarding the storage, 
preparation, destruction , and administration of investigational product . 
6.2 Amgen I nvestigational Product  Evolocumab  and Placebo  
Evolocumab and placebo will be manufactured and packaged by Amgen Inc. and 
distributed using Amgen clinical IP distribution procedures.  Evolocumab will be 
presented as a sterile, preservative- free solution in a single use, disposable, handheld 
mechanical (spring -based) prefilled autoinjector/pen ( AI/Pen) for fixed dose, 
SC injection.  The prefilled AI/Pen contains a 1.0 mL deliverable volume of 140 mg/mL 
evolocumab or 1.0 mL deliverable volume of placebo.  
IP (e volocumab or placebo) should be stored refrigerated and protected from light 
according to the storage and expiration information provided on the label (where 
required).   IP should be handled per the instructions provided in the IPIM and the 
Instructions for Use (IFU) for the prefilled AI/Pen.  
The prefilled AI/Pen should be inspected for IP quality, expiry, and damage before 
using.   Damaged, expired, or degraded product should not be used and any issues with 
the prefilled AI/Pen should be reported to Amgen.   Further details are provided in the 
IPIM and IFU.  
6.2.1  Dosage, Administration, and Schedule  
IP (evolocumab or matching placebo) will be administered SC in accordance with 
instructions in the IPIM and IFU.  IP administration by SC injection if performed during a study visit must occur after vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood draw procedures, if applicable.  After IP administration at the first dosing visit, subjects will be held for observation for at least 30  minutes before being discharged.  
Each QM administration of IP will consist of 3 injections of 140 mg evolocumab or placebo in 1. 0 mL (administration by prefilled AI/Pen) for a total of 3.0 mL (placebo or 
420 mg evolocumab) administered.  
In this study, subjects have the option of self -administration, defined as 
SC administration of IP by the subject, designee or a qualified health c are professional in 
a non- investigator site setting (eg, at home).  The subject (or designee, if not a qualified 
healthcare professional) must have demonstrated competency at administration of SC injections before self -administration is permitted.  T he fir st self -administered dose by

Protocol Number:  20120123  
Date:  01 September 2015  Page 30 of 84 
CONFIDENTIAL    the subject (or designee, if not a healthcare professional) must be administered at the 
site under the supervision of a healthcare provider.  
Details of preparing IP and the injection procedures are included in the IPIM and IFU provided by Amgen prior to the start of the study.  The dosing schedule is described by a schema  in the protocol synopsis.  
When IP is mandated to be administered at the study site, the date and completion time 
of administration, the body location of the injection, and whether the injection was fully or partially administered are to be recorded on each subject’s CRF.  
When IP can be administered at a non- investigato r site location, at a minimum, the dates 
the devices were dispensed and the used devices returned, and for each device whether it was returned fully or partially used are to be recorded on each subject’s CRF.  
6.2.2  Dosage Adjustments, Delays , Rules for Withholding or Restarting , 
Permanent Discontinuation   
There will be no dose adjustments in this study.  If, in the opinion of the investigator, a subject is unable to tolerate a specific dose of IP, that subject will discontinue IP but 
will continue to return for all other study procedures and measurements until the end of the study.  
If a subject is late for administration of IP, administration should occur as soon as 
possible.  A full QM dose of IP should not be administered within less than 7 days of a 
previous dose.  If a subject arrives for a visit with IP administration and IP was administered within the prior 7 days, the dose should not be administered but all other study procedures should be conducted.  Administration of IP should occur as soon as possible but at least 7 days after the previous administration.  
Subjects who completely miss a dose of IP will continue in the study and receive the next dose of IP per their schedule of administration.  
6.3 Other Protocol -required Therapies 
All lipid -lowering drugs that are allowed per protocol and that the subject may be taking, 
must be commercially available and are not provided or reimbursed by Amgen (except if required by local regulation).  The investigator will be responsible for obtaining supplies  
of these drugs.  All such therapy needs to be stable and unchanged during the entire time of screening and study participation unless a change is clinically necessary .

CONFIDENTIAL    6.4 Withholding of Amgen Investigational Product or Statin Background 
Therapy due to Elevation of Creatine Kinase (CK)  
If CK is > 5x ULN, CK must be retested before IP is administered.  In addition, 
investigators will ask study subjects to promptly report muscle pain, cramps, or weakness especially if accompanied by malaise or fever.  If such sy mptoms occur, the 
subject’s CK levels should be measured and if CK is > 5x ULN, the subject should be instructed to discontinue statin background therapy and IP.  CK must be retested before any statin or IP is administered.  
The following rules apply:  
CK at  prior visit  CK on retest  Amgen Investigational Product and Non- Amgen 
Statin Background Therapy Administration  
> 5x ULN  > 10x ULN  Discontinue statin and IPa.  Contact Amgen 
Medical Monitor  
> 5x to ≤ 10x ULN  Discontinue statin and retest CK before statin 
administration.  Consider continuing IP if alternative explanation  
≤ 5x ULN  Consider continuing IP and statin  
a CK elevations >10x ULN that have been confirmed to be secondary to myocardial infarction do not require 
discontinuation of Amgen IP or non-Amgen statin  background therapy.  
If muscular symptoms are severe and cause daily discomfort, even if the CK levels are 
elevated to ≤ 5x ULN, in consultation with the Amgen medical monitor, discontinuation of 
statin, or introduction of an alternative statin may be considered at the lowest dose and with close monitoring.
 
6.5 Hepatotoxicity Stopping and Rechallenge Rules 
Subjects with abnormal hepatic laboratory values (ie, alkaline phosphatase [ALP], 
aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], total bilirubin [TBL]) 
and/or international normalized ratio [INR] and/or signs/symptoms of hepatitis (as described below) may meet the criteria for withholding or permanent discontinuation 
of Amgen investigational product or other protocol -required therapies  as specified in the 
FDA Guidance for Industry Drug- Induced Liver Injury:   Premarketing Clinical Evaluation, 
July 2009. 
6.5.1  Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of Amgen Investigational 
Product and Other Protocol -required Therapies Due to Potential  
Hepatotoxicity

CONFIDENTIAL    Assessment Information) for possible drug -induced liver injury (DILI), if ALL of the 
criteria below are met:  
• TBL > 2x ULN or INR > 1.5 (testing determined per  Appendix  A) 
AND  
• AST or ALT >  3x ULN  
AND  
• no other cause for the combination of the above laboratory abnormalities is 
immediately apparent; important alternative causes for elevated AST/ALT and/or 
TBL values include, but are not limited to: 
− hepatobiliary tract disease 
− viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein- Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, 
herpes simplex virus, varicella, toxoplasmosis, and parvovirus)  
− right sided heart failure, hypotension or any  cause of hypoxia to the liver causing 
ischemia.   
− exposure to hepatotoxic agents/drugs or hepatotoxins, including herbal and dietary supplements, plants and mushrooms   
− heritable disorders causing impaired glucuronidation (eg, Gilbert’s Syndrome, Crigler- Najjar syndrome) and drugs that inhibit bilirubin glucuronidation 
(eg, indinavir, atazanavir)  
− alpha- one antitrypsin deficiency  
− alcoholic hepatitis  
− autoimmune hepatitis  
− Wilson’s disease and hemochromatosis  
− nonalcoholic fatty liver disease including steatohepatitis (NASH)  
− Non-hepatic causes (eg, rhabdomyolysis, hemolysis)  
6.5.2  Criteria for Conditional Withholding of Amgen Investigational Product and Other Protocol -required Therapies Due to Potential 
Hepatotoxicity  
For subjects who do not meet the criteria for permanent discontinuation of Amgen 
investigational product outlined above and have no underlying liver disease, and 
eligibility criteria requiring normal transaminases and TBL at baseline or subjects with 
underlying liver disease and baseline abnormal transaminases, the following rules are to be followed for withholding of Amgen investigational product and other protocol -required 
therapies:  
• AST or ALT > 8x ULN at any time  
• AST or ALT > 5x ULN but <  8x ULN for ≥ 2 weeks (or subject unable to adhere to 
enhanced monitoring schedule)  
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120123  
Date:  01 September 2015  Page 33 of 84 
CONFIDENTIAL    • ALT or AST >  3x ULN with clinical signs or symptoms that are, in the opinion of the 
investigator, consistent with hepatitis (such as right upper quadrant pain/tenderness, 
fever, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, rash or eosinophilia >  5%) 
• TBL > 3x ULN at any time 
• ALP >  8x ULN at any time 
Both statin and investigational product should be withheld pending investigation into 
alternative causes of DILI.  If statin or investigational product is withheld, the subject is to be followed according to  recommendations in Appendix  A for possible DILI.  
Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for impaired liver tests (ALT, AST, ALP) and/ or elevated TBL, is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve 
to normal or baseline ( Section 6.5.3 ). 
6.5.3  Criteria for Rechallenge of Amgen Investigational Product and Other 
Protocol -required Therapies After Potential Hepatotoxicity  
The decision to rechallenge the subject should be discussed and agreed upon unanimously by the subject, investigator, and Amgen.  
If signs or symptoms rec ur with rechallenge, then investigational product should be 
permanently discontinued.  Subjects who clearly meet the criteria for permanent discontinuation (as described in Section 6.5.1 ) should never be rechallenged.  
6.6 Concomitant Therapy  
Throughout the study, i nvestigator s may prescribe any concomitant medications or 
treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those 
listed in Section 6.9. 
All concomitant therapies are to be collected from start of screening through the 
end-of-study  (EOS) , including medications being taken at the time of enrollment.  This 
includes all lipid -regulating medications (eg, statin, ezetimibe, fibrates, cholesterol 
absorption inhibitors, and bile acid sequestrants).  Therapy name, indication, dose, unit, 
frequency, route, start date and stop date will be collected.  
6.7 Medical Devices

CONFIDENTIAL    7.2 General Study Procedures  
This is a multi- center, randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled trial.  The study 
consists of 2 periods:  
• screening period 
• double- blind treatment period 
All on -study visits and dosing should be scheduled from study day 1.  Day  1 and 
week  24 visits must  be scheduled at approximately the same time of day, and should be 
performed as close as possible to 8 am as the hormones measured have diurnal 
variation.  The week 4 visit is 4 weeks after the study day 1 visit, corresponding to study 
day 29.  When it is not possible to perform the study visit at the specified time point, the 
visit should  be performed within ± 3 days  (visit window ± 3 days) .  If a study visit is 
missed or late, including visits outside the visit window, subsequent visits should resume on the original visit schedule.  Missed assessments at prior visits should not be duplicated at subsequent visits.  With the exception of screening and rescreen visits, all study procedures for a visit must be completed on the same day.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that all procedures are performed according to the protocol.  Written informed consent must be obtained and will be 
implemented before protocol specific procedures are carried out.  The risks and benefits 
of participating in the study will be verbally explained to each potential subject prior to 
entering into the study.  The procedures to be performed at each study site visit are described below and the timing of the procedures is provided in  Table  1.  If IP is 
administered during a study visit, administration must be after completion of vital signs, ECG, and blood draw procedures, as applicable.  
Subjects must be fasting for  ≥ 9 hours before each study visit.  For procedures if the 
subject is not fasting when presenting at the study site for a visit, please see Section 7.2.1.2  and Section 7.2.2  below.  
All screening and on -study laboratory s
 amples will be processed and sent to the central 
laboratory.  Amgen or designee will be responsible for the evaluation of PK (evolocumab) and  serum levels
, anti -evolocumab antibody, and bi omarker 
development assessments and the central laboratory will ship the samples to Amgen or a specialty laboratory for assay (depending on the assessment).  
The central laborator
y will provide a study manual that outlines handling, labeling, and 
shipping procedures for all blood samples.  The date and time of sample collection will be recorded in the source documents at the site.

assignment to evolocumab, c entral laboratory results of the lipid panel, ApoA1, ApoB, 
Lp(a) , fasting vitamin s A, D, E,  and K,  and  will not be reported to the 
investigator
 (or study personnel) post -screening.  Inves tigators should not perform 
non-protocol testing of these analytes during a subject’s study participation from first 
administration of IP until at least 12 weeks after last IP administration, or the subject’s 
end of study, whichever is later . 
7.2.1  Screening Enro
llment and Randomization  
Subjects who are considered for entry into the study and have the risk s and benefits of 
participating in the study explained,  will sign  and da te the informed consent  or subject 
assent  form for this study.  Screening starts when the subject’s legally acceptable 
representative has provided informed consent and/or the subject has provided informed consent or assent  as applicable, whichever is later. Screening should be completed and 
the s ubject randomized or screen failed within 8 weeks of the screening start date. 
7.2.1.1  Screening Placebo Administration  
In order to reduce the burden of unnecessary procedures on subjects who subsequently elect not to participate in the study or continue with study procedures, all subjects will undergo a placebo administration to confirm tolerance of SC administration by SC  
injection prior to enrollment.  This placebo administration can be done before or after screening venipuncture procedures but must be done before randomization.  The 
screening placebo administration consists of 1 injection of 1.0 mL placebo, using 1 prefilled AI/Pen  device.  This administration is following the same procedures as 
injections of IP during the treatment period.  Further details are provided in the IPIM.  
7.2.1.2  Screening  
The following procedures are to be completed during the screening period:  
• confir mation that the informed consent  and subject assent, if applicable,  has been 
signed  
• demographic data including sex, age, race, and ethnicity will be collected in order to 
study their possible association with treatment effectiveness, subject safety, or, f or 
example, to further study biomarker variability  
• medical history  
• vital signs (sitting blood pressure [ BP], heart rate [HR]; see  Section 7.7.1 ) 
• review for adverse events /serious adverse events /ADE (adverse events  possibly 
related to study procedures and serious adverse events  are collected during 
screening)

infection, or with AST or ALT >  2x ULN at any time during screening*  
− High risk subjects for this protocol are those who meet any of the following 
conditions:  
o ever injected illegal drugs  
o were exposed to blood known to be infected with HCV  
o were ever on chronic hemodialysis  
o are known to be infected with HIV  
o have a known HCV -infected sexual partner  
• the subject will be instructed to maintain his/her current diet throughout the course of 
the study and avoid going on any strict diet or aiming to lose weight during the study  
• screening placebo injection as per Section 7.2.1.1 ; includes instruction/training on 
AI/Pen device use  
• randomization, if eligible (on or as close as possible to Day 1; see Section 7.2.1.3 ) 
* Please note that subjects with ALT or AST >  2x ULN must be screen failed unless the 
elevation is transient as confirmed by retesting per Section 7.2.1.4 . 
If a fasting sample could not be obtained at the initial screening visit and the other 
screening laboratory assessments confirm eligibility for the study, fasting lipid and 
glucose s amples to determine eligibility must be obtained before randomization. 
All prohibited lipid lowering therapy (see  Section 4.1.2  and Section 6.9) must be 
discontinued ≥ 4 weeks before screening laboratories are taken or as indicated in 
Section 4.1.2  and/or Section 6.9, whichever is longer . 
7.2.1.3  Randomization  
Subjects who continue to meet all eligibility criteria at the end of screening will be 
randomized and will return to the study site for day 1 procedures while continuing their 
background lipid-lowering  treatment.  Randomization should be on day 1 or as close as 
possible and not earlier than maximally 5 days prior. Subjects can only be randomized 1 time for this study.

CONFIDENTIAL    7.2.1.4  Retesting  
If, in the investigator’s judgment, lab abnormalities  are likely to be trans ient, (eg , subject 
participated in vigorous exercise and CK is elevated immediately afterwards), laboratory 
tests can be repeated.  Triglycerides, CK, and liver function and other laboratory values, except LDL- C, can be retested at any time during screening as long as the subject can 
be evaluated for eligibility and randomized within the allowed screening period.  
7.2.1.5  Rescreening  
Subjects with any LDL-C < 130 mg/dL (3.4  mmol/L) during screening are considered 
screen failures and cannot be rescreened for this study.  Suitable subjects who are 
ineligible at the initial screening for other reasons and have not been randomized can be 
re-consented and rescreened at a later time unless they withdraw from screening.  For 
subjects who are rescreened, data from the first screening period will not be used for the analysis.  
With the exception of the screening placebo injection, rescreened subjects who are re-consented will repeat all screening procedures.  Rescreened subjects will maintain 
the originally assigned subject identification number . 
7.2.1.6  Screen Fail  
Subjects who fail any of the eligibility criteria during screening or rescreening and have not been randomized need to be screen failed in IVRS/I WRS before they can be 
re-consented and re- registered in IVRS/IWRS for rescreening.  
7.2.2  Treatment  and End of Study  
Subjects who are randomized will visit the study site for treatment start.  The first administration of IP should be on or as close as possible to the day of randomization but not later than 5 calendar days after randomization.  Day 1 is defined as the day of first administration of IP.  The date of first administration of IP will be recorded in IVRS/IWRS and will determine the schedule of subsequent study visits.  
Subjects must be fasting for  ≥ 9 hours before each study visit where fasting lipid 
samples are obtained.   If the subject is not fasting for the scheduled study day 1 visit, no 
visit procedures are performed.  The subject must return as soon as possible in a fasting state for study day 1 visit procedures.  If the subject is not fasting as required for a visit 
after study day 1, visit procedures should be completed except for fasting laboratory 
sample collection and IP administration, if applicable.  An extra visit must be completed

• body height  
• Cogstate neurocognitive assessment  (see Section 7.7.7 ) 
• 12-lead ECG in triplicate using centralized ECG services equipment  
• blood draw for fasting lipids (≥  9 hour fasting sample), ApoA1, A poB, chemistry, 
hematology, PK,  high sensitivity C- react
ive protein ( hsCRP ), CK, FSH, LH, 
ACT
H, DHEA -S, cortisol, fasting vitamins A, D, E , and K , Lp(a), biomarkers, 
anti-evolocumab antibodies, and viral load in subjects positive for HCV  
• cIMT  
• Tanner staging 
• urine sample for u
rinalysis  
• pregnancy testing for females of childbearing potential  (serum at screening and 
EOS; urine at other time points)  
• IP administration at the study site (must be after completion of vital  signs, ECG, and 
blood draw procedures, if applicable)  
• dispense AI/Pen device with instructions for use  
No additional blood will be collected for the pharmacogenetics analyses.  For subjects who have consented to t he pharmacogenetic  portion of this study,  DNA will be extracted 
from blood samples already collected on day 1 or another visit (see Section 7.5 
“Pharmacogenetic Studies” and  Section 7.6 “Sample Storage and Destruction”). 
If a subject withdraws from the study early, all efforts should be made to  complete and 
report the observations as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal.  If 
possible, the procedures of week 24  should be completed at the time of withdrawal.  
Subjects will end the study with the week 24 visit.  Note that the week 24 visit must be 
scheduled at approximately the same time of day as the day 1 visit, as the hormones 
measured have diurnal variation.

CONFIDENTIAL    7.3 Antibody Testing Procedures 
Blood samples for antibody testing are to be collected per  Table 1  for the measurement 
of anti -evolocumab binding antibodies.  All subjects who have received at least 1 
administration of evolocumab will have samples assayed for binding and, if positive, 
neutralizing antibodies. Samples testing positive for binding antibodies will also be tested for neutralizing antibodies and may be further characterized for quantity/titer, isotype, affinity and presence of immune  complexes. Sites will be notified of any positive  
neutralizing antibody results to evolocumab. If results are not provided, no neutralizing antibodies to evolocumab have been detected.  Additional blood samples may be obtained to rule out anti- evolocumab antibodies during the study. Subjects who test 
positive for neutralizing antibodies to evolocumab at the final scheduled study visit will 
be asked to return for additional follow -up testing. This testing should occur 
approximately every 3 months starting from when the site has been notified of the 
positive result, until: (1) neutralizing antibodies are no longer detectable or (2) the 
subject has been followed for a period of at least 1 year (± 4 weeks). More frequent testing (eg, every month) or testing for a longer period of time may be requested in the event of safety -related concerns. Follow -up testing will not be required where it is 
established that the subject did not receive evolocumab. All follow -up results, both 
positive and negative will be communicated to the sites. Subjects who test positive for binding, non -neutralizing antibodies and have clinical sequelae that are considered 
potentially related to an anti -evolocumab antibody response may also be asked to return 
for additional follow -up testing. 
7.4 Biomarker Development  
Biomarkers are objectively measured and evaluated indicators of normal biologic 
processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention.  
It is expected that further advances will occur in the future  in investiga
 tional techniques 
that look at markers of  
  It is not po
ssible at this stage to anticipate what these 
advances will be;
 however, considerable benefit could accrue to future sufferers of 
coronary artery disease if these markers can be correlated with the data from the study.  It is also important to clarify any potential drug interactions in this population of subjects who will be on a number of other drugs.  For biomarker analysis 14.5 mL of blood will be collected at each of the time points indicated in Table  1 so that 
biomarkers related to, but

CONFIDENTIAL    not limited to  
 
 
 may be studi
ed. 
Refer to t
he laboratory manual for detailed collection and handling procedures for all 
biomarker development samples . 
7.5 Pharmacogenetic Studies 
If the subject consents to the optional pharmacogenetic portion of this study, DNA 
analyses may
 be performed.  These optional pharmacogenetics analyses focus on 
inherited genetic variations such as those of the  gene or t
he LDLR gene to 
evaluate their
 possible correlation to the disease and/or responsiveness to the therapies 
used in this study.  The goals of the optional studies include the use of genetic markers to help in the investigation of cardiovascular disease, hyperlipidemia and other metabolic disorders and/or to identify subjects who may have positive or negative response to 
evolocumab.  No additional blood will be collected for this analysis.  For subjects who have consented to the pharmacogenetic portion of this study,  DNA will be extracted from 
blood samples already collected.  Subjects can participate in the main trial irrespective of whether they do or do not consent to the pharmacogenetic portion of the study . 
7.6 Sample Stor
age and Destruction  
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessment s (Table  1) can be 
analyzed for any of th e tests out lined in  the protocol and for any tes ts necessary to 
minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure analytical methods 
produce reliable and valid data  throughout the course of the study .  This can also 
include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for 
analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to 
the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure database to ensure 
confidentiality . 
If permitted by local law and informed cons
 ent is provided by the subject,  Amgen can  do 
additional testing on remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and 
better understand processes related to

CONFIDENTIAL     
 
 eg, by ev
olocumab,  characte rize 
antibody response, and characterize aspects of the molecule (eg,  mechanism of 
action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be documented and 
maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  Samples can be 
retained for up to 20 years.  
Since the evaluat
ions are not expected to benefit the subject directly or to alter the 
treatment course, the results of pharmacogenetic, biomarker development, or other exploratory studies are not placed in the subject’s medical record and are not be made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other third parties, except as specified in the informed consent . 
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by contacting the investigator.  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining 
blood samples and any other components from the samples can be located and destroyed.  Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are 
completed.  However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be retained by Amgen.  
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request of the subject through the Investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no 
longer justifies keeping the sample).  If a commercial product is developed from this 
research project, the sponsor owns the commerc ial product.  The subject has no 
commercial rights to such product and has no commercial rights to the data, information, discoveries, or derivative materials gained or produced from the sample.  See Section 11.3 for subject confidentiality.  
7.7 Standardization of Study Procedures 
7.7.1  Measurement of Vital Signs  
BP and HR will be measured at each visit.   Use of an automated oscillometric  device for 
BP measurement is preferred and recommended.   BP will initially be recorded in both of 
the subject’s arms unless a concomitant condition favors the use of a particular arm.   
The arm with the higher systolic reading at screening will then be used for BP 

Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120123  
Date:  01 September 2015  Page 47 of 84 
CONFIDENTIAL    determinations throughout the study.   The appropriate size cuff should be used.   BP and 
HR measurements will be determined after the subject  has been seated for at least 
5 minutes.   The subject’s pulse should be measured for 30  seconds and the num ber 
multiplied by 2 to obtain heart rate.   Before randomization, BP measurement can be 
repeated if the previous reading is outside of the eligibility range.  The repeat BP 
measure should be taken at least 2 minutes following the previous measure. 
7.7.2  Height, Weight, and Waist Circumference  
Height and weight measurement will be obtained at the time points specified in 
the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 1 ).  If possible, visits with height and weight 
measurements should be scheduled at a similar time of day (eg, in the morning).  Height is measured to the nearest centimeter with the subject’s back against a 
wall.  Use of a stadiometer is preferred and recommended.  Height is defined as 
the maximum distance from the floor to the highest point on the head, when the subject is facing directly ahead.  Shoes must be off, feet together, and arms by the sides.  Head, upper back, buttocks, and heels should be i n contact with the wall 
when the measurement is made.  Two  (2) measurements of height should be taken 
at each timepoint and entered into the CRF.  Weight is to be measured to the 
nearest tenth of a kilogram with the subject wearing light clothing and with shoes removed.  A properly calibrated digital scale should be used.  The scale should weigh in 0.1 kg increments, have a stable weighing platform that can be easily set 
to zero, be calibrated through professional service or by standard known weight.  
For measurement of waist circumference, subjects should wear minimal clothing to 
ensure that the measuring tape is correctly positioned.  Subjects should stand erect with 
the abdomen relaxed, arms at the sides, feet together and with their weight equally 
divided over both legs.  To perform the waist measurement, the lowest rib margin is first 
located and marked with a pen.  The iliac crest is then palpated in the midaxillary line, and also marked.  It is recommended to apply an elastic tape horizontally midway between the lowest rib margin and the iliac crest, and tie firmly so that it stays in position around the abdomen about the level of the umbilicus.  The elastic tape thus defines the 
level of the waist circumference, which can then be measured by positioning the 
measuring tape over the elastic tape.  Subjects are asked to breathe normally, and to 
breathe out gently at the time of the measurement to prevent them from contracting their muscles or from holding their breath.  Measurements should be performed using the

7.7.3  Tanner Staging (Sexual Maturity Ratings)  
Tanner s taging is widely used to assess adolescents’ physical development duri ng 
puberty in 5 stages (from preadolescent to adult). Also known as Sexual Maturity 
Ratings (SMRs) , Tanner s tages  are a way of assessing the degree of maturation of 
secondary sexual characteristics (see  Appendix  D for guidance).  The developmental 
stages of the adolescent’s sexual characteristics will be rated and recorded separately 
(ie, one stage for pubic hair and one for breasts in females, one stage for pubic hair and one for genitals in males), because these characteristics may differ in their degree of maturity.  
7.7.4  Carotid I ntima -Media Thickness (cIMT)  
Carotid intima -media thickness will be measured by ultrasonography at the timepoints 
shown in the Schedule of Assessments in Section 7.1.  Sonograms will be sent to a core 
laboratory for analysis.  Please refer to the cIMT instruction manual for de tailed 
information on acquiring, storing, and transmitting the sonograms.  
7.7.5  Electrocardiograms  
At each scheduled visit where ECGs are being obtained ECGs will be performed in a standardized method, in triplicate, and run consecutively (ie, <  30 seconds apart ), prior 
to blood draws or other invasive procedures.  Using equipment supplied to each site, all protocol -specified ECGs will be acquired and transmitted to the centralized ECG 
services provider.  The Principal investigator ( PI) or designated physician wi ll review 
acquired ECGs.  One (1) signed, original ECG tracing should be retained with the subject’s source documents.  At the request of the sponsor, the original ECG should be 
made available to Amgen to be manually read by a central reader.  
The centralized ECG services cardiologists will perform standard interpretations of all 
tracings.  A cardiologist reviewed ECG report will be provided to the study site.  Investigators must initial and date the ECG reports upon receipt.  If the investigator’s interpret ation of any protocol -specified or unscheduled ECG differs from that supplied by 
centralized ECG services provider, it is the responsibility of the investigator to make the final clinical decisions.  The investigator’s interpretation does not need to be reconciled with that supplied by centralized ECG services cardiologists.  Any clinical interventions based on these results need to be documented in the appropriate source documents 
and eCRF as applicable.  It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain additional

CONFIDENTIAL    ECGs required for the clinical management of the subject, using centralized ECG 
services equipment or equipment on -site. 
Further detail about the equipment provided and its use for this study will be provided in an Investigator ECG Manual distributed to the sites before start of enrollment.  
7.7.6  Lipid Measurements  
Only the screening LDL- C concentration will be reported to the site for the eligibility 
decision.   Central laboratory results of the lipid panel, as well as ApoA1, ApoB, 
lipoprotein(a) , fasting vitamin s A, D, E,  and K,  and  will be blinded 
post-treatment until unblinding of the clinical database and will not be reported to the 
investigator post -screening.  In addition, investigators and staff involved with this trial 
and all medical staff involved in the subject’s medical care should refrain from obtaining 
lipid panels from randomization until at least 12 weeks after the subject’s last 
administration of IP or until the subject ends the study, whichever is later (to avoid potential unblinding).   If a lipid panel is drawn, all reasonable steps must be undertaken 
to avoid informing the subject and study personnel of the results.  
7.7.7  Neurocognitive A ssessments  
The Cogstate cognitive battery is a set of neuropsychological tests administered to subjects via computer.  In Study 20120123, the battery will consist of the following 
4 tests:  
• Groton Maze Learning Task (GMLT; Executive Function): The Groton Maze Learning 
task is a  measure of problem solving and reasoning and uses a well -validated maze 
learning paradigm.  In this task, the subject is shown a 10 x 10 grid of boxes on a 
computer screen.  A 28 -step pathway is hidden among these 100 possible locations.  
Each box represents move locations, and the grid refers to the box array (ie, 10 × 10).  Subjects are required to find the hidden pathway guided by 4 search rules.  These rules are: do not move diagonally, do not move more than 1 box (ie, do not 
jump), do not move back on the pathway, and return to the last correct location after 
an error.  At each step, only the most recently selected box is shown.  Feedback is given with visual and auditory cues (green check marks and red crosses) to indicate 
whether the selected box is correct or incorrect.  The head of path, or the last correct location, flashes with a green check when two errors are made in succession (failing 
to return errors).  There are 20 well -matched alternate pathways available.  The 
software records each move as  an error or as a correct move.  
• One Card Learning Test (OCL; Visual Memory): The One Card Learning test is a measure of visual recognition memory and uses a well -validated pattern separation 
paradigm using card stimuli.   In this test, the cards are similar  to those found in a 
deck of playing cards.  The subject is asked whether the card currently being 
presented in the center of the screen was seen previously in this test.  The subject 
responds by pressing the Yes or No key.  Because no card has been presented yet, 
the first response is always No.

Protocol Number:  20120123  
Date:  01 September 2015  Page 50 of 84 
CONFIDENTIAL    • Identification Test (IDN; Attention/Vigilance): The Identification test is a measure of 
visual attention and uses a well -validated choice reaction time paradigm using card 
stimuli.  In this test, the playing cards are all either red or black.  The subject is asked 
whether the card currently being presented in the center of the screen is red.  The 
subject responds by pressing the Yes key when the card is red and No when it is 
black.  
• Detection Test (DET; Psychomotor Speed): The Detection test is a measure of 
information processing speed and uses a well -validated simple reaction time 
paradigm using card stimuli.  In this test, the playing cards are all red and black.  The 
subject is asked to press the Yes key as soon as  the card in the center of the screen 
flips over.  
This battery will be administered 3 times during the study: during screening, on study 
Day 1 (baseline), and at Week 24 (EOS).  Completion of this test battery will take approximately 15 to 20 minutes at each administration.  The Cogstate tests do not 
require complex language skills for administration, and the forms themselves do not use linguistic stimuli or responses.  
Cogstate tests have been used to examine the potential adverse effects o f mobile 
telephone use in young adolescents (Abramson et al, 2009) , adolescents with eating 
disorders (Allen et al, 2013) , skipping breakfast in elementary schoolchildren 
(Kral et al, 2012) , dietary patterns in adolescents (Nyaradi  et al, 2014) , and in ute ro 
exposure to cocaine ( Mayes et al, 2007) .  The Cogstate tests have also been used to 
examine the cognitive effects of treatment with stimulant medication in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) ([Mollica et al, 2004 ]: 8 to 12 year olds; 
[Snyder et al, 2008 ]: 6 to 16 year olds), as well as the effects of computerized cognitive 
rehabilitation in pediatric cerebral malaria survivors as young as 5 years old 
[Bangirana et al, 2009]. 
Additionally, regulatory authorities have approved the use of Cogstate tests for monitoring and evaluating the safety of central nervous system  penetrant drugs in a 
range of pediatric indications, including epilepsy, neurogenic detrusor over- activity, 
bipolar depression, schizophrenia, and hyponatr emia , and in children as young as 
4 years old.   In sports , Cogstate tests a re being used to make return- to-play decisions in 
suspected concussion.  
7.7.8  Neurologic E xamination 
Physical examination (at screening and EOS) should include a neurologic examination.  
The neurologic physical examination should include a ssessments  of motor, sensory , 
reflexes , coordination, and g ait.

CONFIDENTIAL    On the relevant eCRF, each area should be described as normal or abnormal, and if 
abnormal, details should be recorded, including whether t here is worsening  from 
baseline.  
8. WITHDRAWAL FROM TREATMENT, PROCEDURES, AND STUDY  
8.1 Subject s’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to their  future medical care by the physician or at the institution. 
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving 
investigational product and/or other protocol -required therapies or procedures at any 
time during the study  but continue participation in the study .  If this occurs, the 
investigator is to discuss with the subject the appropriate processes for discontinuation 
from investigational product or other protocol -required therapies and must discuss with 
the subject t he options for continuation of the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 1 ) and 
collection of data, including endpoints and adverse events .  The investigator  must 
document the change to the Schedule of A ssessments  (Table  1) and the level of 
follow -up that is agreed to by the subject ( eg, in person, by tele phone/mail, through 
family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other physicians, from review of the medical records ). 
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive further protocol -required therapies or procedures , and the subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation .  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent 
will be included in the analysis of the study , and where permitted, publically available 
data can be included after withdrawal of consent.  The investigator is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.  The investigator should 
ask the subject’s consent to perform the procedures listed under the final study visit.  
8.2 Investigator or Sponsor Decision to Withdraw  or Terminate 
Subjects’ Participation Prior to Study Completion  
The investigator and /or sponsor can decide to withdraw a subject(s) from investigational 
product and/or other protocol- required therapies, protocol procedures , or the study as a 
whole at any time prior to study completion. 
Subjects may be eligible for continued treatment with Amg en investigational product(s)  
and/or other protocol -required therapies by a separate protocol or as provided for by the 
local country’s regulatory mechanism, based on parameters consistent with Section 12.1.

9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
9.1 Adverse Events  
9.1.1  Definition of Adverse Events 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial 
subject.  The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record. 
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre- existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying disease  
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120123  
Date:  01 September 2015  Page 53 of 84 
CONFIDENTIAL    (eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than  would be expected , and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome  than expected.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more  
than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease)  during the study or 
involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while 
on study, is not considered an adverse event. 
An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a medical device.  
Adverse device effects include adverse events resulting from  insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any malfunction of the device, or adverse events resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the device.  
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s legally acceptable representative requests to withdraw from protocol -required therapies 
or the study due to an adverse event, refer to Section 8.1 for additional instructions on 
the procedures recommended for safe withdrawal from protocol -required therapies or 
the study.  
9.1.2  Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the 
following serious criteria (unless it meets the definition of a Disease Related Event 
as defined in Section  9.1.3– below) : 
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
A disease related event is to be reported as a serious adverse event if:    
• the subject’s pre -existing condition becomes worse than what the invest igator 
would consider typical for a subject  with the same underlying condition, or  
• if the investigator believes a causal relationship exists between the 
investigational medicinal product(s)/protocol -required therapies and the event , 
• and the event meets at least 1 of the serious criteria above.   
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120123  
Date:  01 September 2015  Page 54 of 84 
CONFIDENTIAL    An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires  hospitalization”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).  
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix  A for 
drug-induced liver injury reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an emergency 
room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.  
9.1.3  Definition of Disease -related Events 
Disease -related events are events (serious or non -serious) anticipated to occur in the 
study population due to the underlying disease.  In this study, such events include atherosclerosis (especially of the coronary arteries) and its complications.  Examples 
include manifestations of myocardial ischemia such as chest pain and myocardial 
infarction, and percutaneous and surgical revascularization procedures.  Such events do 
not meet the definition of an adverse event unless assessed to be more severe than 
expected f or the subject’s condition or if the investigator believes there is a causal 
relationship between the investigational product(s)/study treatment protocol 
required therapies and disease worsening. 
Disease Related Events and/or Disease Related Outcomes that do not qualify as 
Serious Adverse Events:  
• An event which is part of the normal course of disease under study 
(eg, disease progression in oncology or hospitalization due to disease 
progression) is to be reported as a Disease Related Event.  
• Death due to the disease under study is to be recorded on the Event CRF.  
If the outcome of the underlying disease is worse than that which would normally 
be expected for the subject, or if the investigator believes there is a causal relationship between the investigational product(s)/study treatment protocol 
required therapies and disease worsening, this must be reported as an Adverse 
Event or Serious Adverse Event.  
9.2 Reporting of Adverse Events 
9.2.1  Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That do not Meet Serious 
Criteria  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the 
investigator or reported by the subject that occur from  randomization and all adverse

Protocol Number:  20120123  
Date:  01 September 2015  Page 55 of 84 
CONFIDENTIAL    events possibly related to study procedures from signing of the informed cons ent or 
subject assent through the end of study  are reported  using the applicable eCRF 
(eg, Adverse Event eCRF ). 
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or sy mptoms),  
• dates of onset and resolution (if resolved),  
• severity  
• assessment of relatedness to investigational product ( evolocumab or placebo or the 
prefilled autoinjector/pen (AI/Pen device) , or other protocol -required 
therapies /protocol -required procedure or activity , and 
• action taken.  
The adverse event grading scale used will be the most current version of the National 
Cancer Institute ( NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE) 
grading scal e.  The grading scale used in this study is referenced in Appendix  A. 
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to I P 
(evolocumab or placebo) .  This relationship is in dicated by a “yes” or “no” response to 
the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
Investigational Medicinal Product ? 
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to the 
prefilled autoinjector/pen (AI/Pen) device used to administer IP (evolocumab or 
placebo).   The relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: Is 
there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the device? 
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any other 
study -mandated activity (eg, screening  or background therapy /protocol -required 
therapies ).  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is 
there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by study 
procedure/activity?”  
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable,

Protocol Number:  20120123  
Date:  01 September 2015  Page 56 of 84 
CONFIDENTIAL    clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event.  
The Investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or reversibility.  If the severity of an adverse event worsens from the date of onset to the date of resolution, record a single event for each increased level of severity on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  
9.2.2  Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the informed consent  through 30 days after the last dose of IP or EOS, whichever is later, are 
recorded in the subject’s medical record and are submitted to Amgen.   All serious 
adverse events must be submitted to Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via the applicable eCRF.  
After the protocol -required reporting period defined above, the investigator does not 
need to actively monitor subjects for serious adverse events.  However, if the investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event after this protocol -required 
reporting period, the investigator will report the event to Amgen within 24 hours following 
the investigator’s knowledge of the event.  Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period will be captured within the safety database as 
clinical trial cases f or the purposes of expedited reporting.  
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the Serious Adverse Event, the information is to be reported to Amgen via an electronic Serious Adverse Event (eSAE) Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event.   See Appendix  B for a sample of the Serious 
Adverse Event Worksheet/electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form.  If the first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to Amgen via the eSAE Contingency Report Form, the data must be entered into the EDC system when the system is again available. 
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to IP 
(evolocumab or placebo) .  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to 
the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
Investigational Medicinal Product ? 
Product:  Evolocumab

CONFIDENTIAL    The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
the prefilled autoinjector/pen (AI/Pen) device used to administer IP ( evolocum ab or 
placebo).   The relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: Is 
there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the device? 
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
any other study -mandated activity (eg, screening procedure or background 
therapy/protocol -required therapies).  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” 
response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by study procedure/activity ?” 
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization or reversibility .  If the severity of a serious adverse event worsens from the date of onset 
to the date of resolution, record a single event for each increased level of severity on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be 
submitted to Amgen.   All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to 
Amgen within 24 hours following knowledge of the new information.  The investigator 
may be asked to provide additional follow -up information, which may include a discharge 
summary or extracts from the medical record.  Information provided about the serious adverse event must be consistent with that recorded on the applicable CRF (eg, Adverse Event eCRF).  
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapies because of a 
serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to Amgen.  
To comply with worldwide reporting regulations for serious adverse events, the treatment 
assignment of subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events 
may be unblinded by Amgen before submission to regulatory authorities.  Investigators 
will receive notification of related serious adverse events reports sent to regulatory authorities in accordance with local requirements.  
Amgen will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and good clinical practice .

CONFIDENTIAL    The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring 
at the site and other adverse event reports received from Amgen, in accordance with local procedures and statutes.  
9.2.3  Reporting Procedures for Disease -related Events 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all disease- related events observed by 
the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after the first dose of investigational 
medicinal product(s) through EOS  (including any  follow -up visits) are re ported using 
the appropriate Event CRF.  Additionally, the investigator is required to report a fatal 
disease- related event on the CRF.  
If the outcome of the underlying disease is worse than that which would normally 
be expected for the subject, or if the investigator believes there is a causal 
relationship between the investigational product(s)/study treatment protocol 
required therapies and disease worsening, this must be reported as an Adverse Event or Serious Adverse Event.  
9.3 Pregnancy and Lactation Report ing 
If a pregnancy occurs in a female subject, or female partner of a male subject, while the subject is taking  IP (evolocumab or placebo)  report the pregnancy to Amgen as specified 
below.  
In addition to reporting any pregnancies occurring during the study, investigators should monitor for pregnancies the last dose of IP (evolocumab or placebo) through 15 weeks after the end of treatment with IP (evolocumab or placebo) . 
The pregnancy should be reported to Amgen  Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of 
the investigator’s knowledge of the event of a pregnancy.  Report a pregnancy on the Pregnancy Notification Worksheet ( Appendix  C).  If a lactation case occurs while the 
female subject is taking IP (evolocumab or placebo) report the lactation case to Amgen as specified below.  
In addition to reporting a lactation case during the study, investigators should monitor for 
lactation cases that occur after the last dose of IP (evolocumab or placebo) through 
15 weeks after the end of treatment with IP (evolocumab or placebo) .  
Any lactation case should be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety  within 24 hours 
of the investigator’s knowledge of event.  Report a lactation case on the Lactation 
Notification Worksheet ( Appendix  C).

CONFIDENTIAL    10.1.2  Analysis Sets  
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who received at least 
1 dose of IP.  This analysis set will be used in both efficacy and safety analyses.  In 
efficacy analyses, subjects will be grouped according to their randomized treatment 
group assignment.  For safety analyses, subjects will be grouped according to their randomized treatment group assignment with the following exception: if a subject receives treatment throughout the study that is different than the randomized treatment group assignment, then the subject will be grouped by the actual treatment g roup.  The 
completer analysis set (CAS) includes subjects in the FAS who adhered to the scheduled IP regimen and have an observed value for the primary endpoint.  
10.1.3  Baseline Covariates and Subgroups  
The following baseline covariates may be used for subgroup or covariate analyses with the subgroups as specified or in their original format:  
• age (< 14 years vs ≥ 14 years)  
• sex  
• LDL-C by central laboratory (< 160 mg/dL [4.1 mmol/L] vs ≥ 160 mg/dL)  
Subgroup levels may be combined as appropriate for subgroup analyses.  
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
This study is to provide clinical experience with evolocumab in approximately 
150 pediatric subjects , compared to the current experience described in Sections 2.3 
and Section 2.4.  Based on the treatment effect from the global phase 3 study in adult 
subjects wit
h HeFH, evolocumab reduced LDL- C by approximately 55%.  A planned total 
sample size of 150 subjects (100 randomized to evolocumab 420 mg QM and 50 randomized to placebo QM) will provide approximately 99% power in tes
ting the 
superiority o
f evolocumab 420 mg QM over placebo.  The sample size calculation is

CONFIDENTIAL    10.3 Access to Individual Subject Treatment  Assignments by Amgen or 
Designees 
Blinded individuals will not have access to unblinded information until the study is 
formally unblinded.  Unblinding and potentially unblinding information should not be distributed to the study team, investigators or subjects prior to the study being formally unblinded (eg, the formal unblinding may occur at the final analysis rather than during the primary analysis) except as specified (eg, Section 5.2 and Section 9.2.2 ). 
Individual subject treatment assignments will be maintained by the IVRS/IWRS. Any unplanned unblinding occurring during the study period will be documented and reported 
in the final clinical study report. 
The independent DMC members and Independent Biostatistical Group (IBG) will have 
access to treatment assignments and subject level data from  the clinical trial database.  
Amgen staff members who are involved in randomization, biological sample management,  performing PK, and anti -evolocumab antibody assay analysis will have 
treatment assignment information but will not have access to subject level data from the clinical trial database. 
10.4 Planned Analyses  
10.4.1  Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  
An external independent DMC has been established to formally review the accumulating 
data from this and other completed and ongoing studies with evolocumab to ensure there is no avoidable increased risk for harm to subjects.  The independent DMC is 
chaired by an external academic cardiologist who is an expert in lipids and clinical trials. 
Analyses for the DMC are provided by the Independent Biostatistical Group (IBG), which is external to Amgen.  Details are provided in the DMC charter.  
10.4.2  Primary Analysis 
The primary analysis of this study will be conducted when the study is completed.  At that time, the database will be cleaned, processed and locked; the study will also be unblinded. Unless specified otherwise, the FAS will be the default analysis set in this 
study and data will be summarized by randomized treatment group. 
10.5 Planned Methods of Analysis  
10.5.1  General Considerations 
Efficacy and safety analyses will be performed on the FAS. Unless specified otherwise, 
the FAS will be the default analysis set in this study and data will be summarized by 
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120123  
Date:  01 September 2015  Page 63 of 84 
CONFIDENTIAL    randomized treatment g roup.  The superiority of evolocumab to placebo will be assessed 
for all efficacy endpoints.  
Subject disposition, demographics, baseline characteristics, and exposure to IP will be 
summarized.  
Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the number of subjects, mean, 
median, standard deviation, or standard error, minimum, and maximum.  For categorical 
variables, the frequency and percentage will be given.  
Methods of handling missing data for efficacy endpoints will be described throughout this section.   Missing data will not be imputed for safety endpoints.  
Multiplicity Adjustment Method  
To preserve the familywise error rate at 0.05, multiplicity adjustment for the multiple endpoints (primary and secondary efficacy endpoints as enumerated in section 10.1.1.2 ) 
will be performed using sequential gatekeeping and Hochberg procedures (Hochberg,  1988 ) as follows:  
• If the treatment effect from the primary analysis of the primary endpoint is 
significant at a significance level of 0.05, statistical testing of the secondary 
efficacy endpoint
1 and endpoint2 will proceed using the sequential procedure with 
a significance level of 0.05 (ie, secondary endpoint2 will be tested only if 
secondary endpoint1 is statistically significant at 0.05 significance level).  
• If the treatment effect from secondary endpoint2 is significant at a significance 
level of 0.05, statistical testing of the secondary endpoints3 will follow the 
Hochberg procedure at a significance level of 0.05.  
Unless specified otherwise, all other hypothesis testing will be 2- sided with a significance 
level of 0.05.  
10.5.2  Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses  
Primary Analyses  
The estimand of primary interest is the difference in mean percent change from 
baseline in LDL- C at week 24 regardless of treatment adherence for subjects in 
FAS.  A repeated measures linear effects model will be used to compare the efficacy of 
evolocumab with placebo.  The repeated  measures model will include terms for 
treatment group, stratification factor  (as appropriate), scheduled visit and the interaction 
of treatment with scheduled visit.  Missing values will not be imputed when the repeated 
measures linear effects model is us ed.  The analysis will use LDL -C values measured 
regardless of treatment adherence.

CONFIDENTIAL    Sensitivity Analysis 
To evaluate the robustness of the analysis results, sensitivity analyses will be performed 
as follows:  
• The primary analysis will be repeated using the CAS  
• Non-parametric analyses (Quade test)  
• To evaluate the impact of missing values, a sensitivity analysis under the assumption that subjects who, discontinued IP and have missing endpoint 
data have a mean zero percent change from baseline will be conducted using 
multiple imputation  
The difference between the number of randomized subjects and the number of subjects in the FAS will also be assessed and reported in the Clinical Study 
Report .  
Covariate and Subgroup Analysis  
If applicable, covariate and subgroup analyses on the primary endpoint will be 
conducted using baseline covariates.  
10.5.3  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Analyses  
The statistical model and testing of the secondary efficacy endpoints will be similar to the 
primary a nalysis of the primary endpoint. 
Multiplicity adjustment procedures are defined in Section 10.5.1.  
10.5.4  Tertiary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses  
Analysis of the tertiary efficacy endpoints will be similar to the primary analysis of the 
primary endpoint.  No multiplicity adjustment will be applied.  
10.5.5  Secondary Safety and Pharmacokinetic Endpoint Analyses  
Adverse Events  
Subject incidence of all treatment -emergent  adverse events will be tabulated by system 
organ class and preferred term.  Tables of fatal adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events leading to withdrawal from investigational product will also be provided.  Subject -level data may be provided instead of tables if the subject incidence is low.

CONFIDENTIAL    Safety Laboratory Parameters  
Laboratory parameters will be summarized for each treatment group using descriptive 
statistics at each scheduled visit. Laboratory shift tables for certain analytes  will be 
provided using the CTCAE v.4 toxicity criteria. The results will be based on the maximum (ie, worst) shift from baseline to the EOS.  
Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be summarized for each treatment group using descriptive statistics at each scheduled visit.  
Anti-evolocumab antibodies  
The incidence and percentages of subjects who develop anti -evolocumab 
antibodies (binding and neutralizing) at any time will be tabulated.  
Pharmacokinetic  
Unbound evolocumab serum concentrations by time will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics.  
10.5.6  Other Safety Endpoint Analyses  
Neurologic examination  
The incidence of abnormal neurologic findings overall and in each exam area will be summarized by treatment group.  
Cogstate neurocognitive assessment  
For each test, the change from baseline to EOS in the standardized score will be 
summarized by treatment group.

An initial sample informed consent form is provided for the investigator to prepare the 
informed consent document to be used at his or her site.  Updates to the template are to 
be communicated formally in writing from the Amgen Clinical Study Manager or designee to the investigator.  The written informed consent document is to be prepared in the language(s) of the potential patient population.  
Before a subject’s participation in the clinical study, the investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from the subject or legally acceptable representative 
after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential 
hazards of the study and before any protocol -specific screening procedures or any 
investigational product(s) is/are administered.  A legally acceptable representative is an 
individual or other body  authorized under applicable law to consent, on behalf of a 
prospective subject, to the subject’s participation in the clinical study.  
The investigator is also responsible for asking the subject if the subject has a primary care physician and if the subject agrees to have his/her primary care physician informed of the subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the subject agrees to such notification, the investigator is to inform the subject’s primary care physician of the 
subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the subject does not have a primary care 
physician and the investigator will be acting in that capacity, the investigator is to document such in the subject’s medical record .  
The acquisition of informed consent and the subject’s agreement or refusal of his/her notification of the primary care physician is to  be documented in the subject’s medical 
records, and the informed consent form  is to be signed and personally dated by the 
subject or a legally acceptable representative and by  the person who conducted the 
informed consent discussion.  The original signed informed consent form is to  be 
retained in accordance with institutional policy, and a copy of the signed consent form is 
to be provided to the subject or legally acceptable representative.  
If a potential subject is illiterate or visually impaired and does not have a legally 
acceptable representative, the investigator must provide an impartial witness to read the informed consent form to the subject and must allow for questions.   Thereafter, both the

CONFIDENTIAL    12.3 Study Monitoring and Data Collection  
The Amgen re presentative(s) and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for 
contacting and visiting the investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, 
upon request, inspecting the various records of the clinical study (eg, CRFs and other pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is respected.  
The Amgen Clinical Monitor is responsible for verifying the CRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research.  The Clinical Monitor is to have access to subject medical records and other 
study -related records needed to verify the entries on the CRFs.  
The investigator agrees to cooperate with the clinical monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in 
completing CRFs, are resolved.  
In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected for audit by representatives from Amgen’s Global Compliance Auditing function (or designees).  Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, protocol -required therapy 
storage areas, laboratories) and review of study -related records will occur to evaluate 
the study conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.  
Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:  
• All source documentation supporting entries into the CRFs must be maintained and 
readily available.  
• Updates to CRFs will be automatically documented through the software’s “audit 
trail”.  
• To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review is performed on subject data received at Amgen.  During this 
review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent 
discrepancies.  In addition, the data are reviewed for adherence to the protocol and 
GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review 
process, data queries and/or site notifications are created in the EDC system database for site resolution and subsequently closed by the EDC system or by an 
Amgen reviewer.  
• The investigator signs only the Investigator Verification Form for this electronic data capture study.  This signature indicates that investigator inspected or reviewed the 
data on the CRF, the data queries, and the site notifications, and agrees with the content.

CONFIDENTIAL    Amgen (or designee) will perform self -evident corrections to obvious data errors in the 
clinical trial database, as documented in the Study Specific Self Evident Corrections 
Plan.  Examples of obvious data errors that may be corrected by Amgen (or designee) include deletion of obvious duplicate data (eg, same results sent twice with the same date with different visit -week 4 and early termination) and clarifying “other, specify” if 
data are provided (eg, race, physical examination).  Each investigative site will be provided a list of the types of corrections applied to study data at the initiation of the trial and at study closeout.  
12.4 Investigator  Responsibilities for Data Collection 
The investigator  is responsible for comply ing with the requirements for all assessments 
and data collection (includ ing subjects not receiving protocol -required therapies) as 
stipulated in the protocol for each subject in the study.  For subjects who withdraw prior to completion of all protocol- required visits and are unabl e or unwilling to continue the 
Schedule of A ssessments  (Table 1 ), the investigator can search publically available 
records [where permitted]) to ascertain survival status.  This ensures that the data set(s) 
produced as an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as possible.  
12.5 Language 
All written information and other material to be used by subjects and investigative staff 
must use vocabulary and language that are clearly understood.  
12.6 Publication Policy  
To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, Amgen encourages the formation of 
a publication committee consisting of several investigators and appropriate Amgen staff,  
the governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication Charter.  The 
committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other investigators and to 
collaborate with authors and Amgen staff as appropriate as defined in the Publication 
Charter .  Membership on the committee (both for investigators and  Amgen staff) does 
not guarantee authorship.  The criteria described below are to be met for every 
publication.  
Product:  Evolocumab  
Protocol Number:  20120123  
Date:  01 September 2015  Page 72 of 84 
CONFIDENTIAL    Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis 
of the Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to  Biomedical Journals 
(International Committee of Medical Journal Editors), which states  (August 2013 
revision):  
• Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the 
version to be published; (4) agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work 
in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work 
are appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, 3, 
and 4.  
• When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should  identify 
the individuals who accept direct respons ibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.  
• Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship.  
• All persons designated  as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who 
qualify should be listed.  
• Each author should  have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content.  
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to Amgen for review.  The Clinical Trial Agreement among the institution, investigator, and Amgen will detail the procedures for, and timing of, Amgen’s review of publ ications.

Pediatric D rug-induced Liver Injury Reporting & Additional Assessments  
Reporting  
Cases with  
AST or ALT ≥ 3 x ULN and TBL > 2 x ULN or INR > 1.5  
or 
AST or ALT ≥ 3 x ULN with signs and symptoms consistent with hepatitis must be 
reported to Amgen as a serious adverse event within 24 hours of discovery or 
notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic investigations have been concluded).    
Cases with  
AST or ALT > 3 x ULN (if baseline ALT or AST is ≤ 3 x ULN)  
AST or ALT > 5 x ULN (if baseline ALT or AST is ≤ 5 x ULN)  
are to be reported as adverse events.  
The appropriate CRF (eg, Adverse Event CRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evaluation of treatment -emergent liver abnormalities is to be completed and 
sent to the Amgen.  
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse events if  they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section 9.1.2 . 
Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation  
All subjects in whom investigational medicinal product(s) or protocol -required therapies 
is/are withheld (either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in Sections 6.5.1  and Section 6.5.2  or who experience AST or ALT elevations > 3x ULN (if 
baseline ALT or AST is ≤ 3 x  ULN) or who experience AST or ALT > 5 x ULN (if baseline

CONFIDENTIAL    ALT or AST is ≤ 5 x ULN)   are to undergo a period of “close observation” until 
abnormalities return to normal or to the subject’s baseline levels.    
The following evaluations are to be performed during this period:    
1. Repeat liver tests AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin (total and direct), and INR as clinically 
necessary until laboratory abnormalities improve .    
2. Obtain pediatric gastroenterologist or pediatric hepatologist consult.  
The diagnostic approach (including blood tests) to investigate alternative causes for abnormal liver tests is to be determined in consultation with a pediatric gastroenterologist or hepatologist.  
The “close observation” is to continue until all laboratory abnormalities return to bas eline 
or normalize and subject’s clinical condition improves.

7.7.2 Height, Weight, and Waist Circumference 
Height and weight measurement will be obtained at the time points specified in 
the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1).  If possible, visits with height and weight measurements should be scheduled at a similar time of day (eg, in the morning).  
Height is measured to the nearest centimeter with the subject’s back against a 
wall.  Use of a stadiometer is preferred and recommended.  Height is defined as 
the maximum distance from the floor to the highest point on the head, when the subject is facing directly ahead.  Shoes must be off, feet together, and arms by the sides.  Head, upper back, buttocks, and heels should be in contact with  the wall 
when the measurement is made.  Two  (2) measurements of height should be taken 
at each timepoint and entered into the CRF. Weight is to be measured to the nearest tenth of a kilogram with the subject wearing light clothing and with shoes removed.  A properly calibrated digital scale should be used.  The scale should 
weigh in 0.1 kg increments, have a stable weighing platform that can be easily set to zero, be calibrated through professional service or by standard known weight.  
For measurement of waist circumference, subjects should wear minimal clothing to 
ensure that the measuring tape is correctly positioned.  Subjects should stand erect with the abdomen relaxed, arms at the sides, feet together and with their weight equally 
divided over both legs .

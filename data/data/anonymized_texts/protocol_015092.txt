2. BACKGROUND 
Recurrent Clear Cell Carcinoma of the Ovary 
Clear cell carcinoma of the ovary has an estimated prevalence of 3-12% of all epithelial 
ovarian carcinoma s (Anglesio et al., 2011). Clear cell carcinomas of the ovary have a 
distinct clinical behavior when compared to other epithelial ovarian carcinomas, with a worse prognosis especially in advanced disease (Sugiyama et al., 2000; Jenison et al., 1989; Mackay et al., 2010). The low survival rates in clear cell carcinomas of the ovary may reflect their lack of sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy (Sugiyama et al., 2000; Takano et al., 2006). Recurrent or persistent clear cell carcinoma of the ovary is particularly chemoresistant with response rates of <10% (Takano et al., 2008). Not only is this histologic subtype of ovarian cancer disproportionately represented in ovarian cancer clinical trials, the lack of effective therapy leads to clear cell carcinoma having proportionately increased representation for limited options in the recurrent setting. There is an unmet need for therapeutic options in this disease type, given the particularly poor prognosis of this tumor type upon recurrence, the lack of effective treatment, and the rarity of this disease. Future treatment of this disease may rest on novel therapies. 
NRG-GY016   8 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020 
PD-1 and PD-L1 Targeting 
PD-1 receptor is expressed by activated T-cells resulting in reduced cytokine production, 
cytolytic activity, and lymphocyte proliferation. The activation of PD-1 represents a 
major mechanism for suppressing anti-cancer T-cell responses (Menderes et al., 2016). These effects are mediated through its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. Many types of human 
tumors, including ovarian cancer, express PD- L1 (Kooi et al., 1996). When PD-L1 binds 
with PD-1, T-cell activity is attenuated, preventing the immune system from eliminating 
the tumor at the tissue level (Mellman et al., 2011). Blockade of PD-1 or PD-L1 with monoclonal antibodies can enhance T-cell activity, augmenting the anti-cancer immune response with the potential to produce durable clinical responses (Brahmer et al., 2012; Topalian et al., 2012). PD-L1 expression is associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer (Zhang et al., 2003) and PD-L1 also promotes progression of ovarian cancer by inducing host immune-suppression of peripheral cytotoxic CD8+ T cell lymphocytes (Abiko et al., 2013).  
MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab) Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background 
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformation has been known for decades (Disis 2010). Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various malignancies (Dong et al., 2002; Sharpe et al., 2002; Brown et al., 2003; Francisco et al., 2010; Thompson et al., 2007). In particular, the presence of CD8+ T-cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long-term survival in many solid tumors. 
 
The PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune control. The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated 
T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions. PD-1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA-4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD-L2) (Talmadge et al., 2007 ; Usubutun et al., 1998]. The structure of murine PD-1 has 
been resolved (Al-Shibli et al., 2008). PD-1 and family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable-type (V-type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine-based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM). Following T-cell stimulation, PD-1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3, PKCӨ and the CD3 T- cell signaling cascade (Talmadge et al., 2007;  
Deschoolmeester et al., 2010; Diez et al., 1998; Galon et al., 2006). The mechanism by which PD-1 down modulates T-cell responses is similar to, but distinct from that of CTLA-4 as both molecules regulate an overlapping set of signaling proteins (Hiraoka et 
al., 2010; Nobili et al., 2008]. PD-1 was shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes 
NRG-GY016   9 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020 
including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, T regs and Natural Killer cells 
(Hodi et al., 2010; Kloor 2009). Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4- CD8 - (double negative) T-cells as well as subsets of macrophages 
and dendritic cells (Hillen et al., 2008). The ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non-
hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors (Lee et al., 2008; Leffers et al., 2009 ; 
Nishimura et al., 2000; Hiraoka et al., 2010). Both ligands are type I transmembrane 
receptors containing both IgV- and IgC-like domains in the extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs. Binding of either PD-1 ligand to PD-1 inhibits T-cell activation triggered through the T-cell receptor. PD-L1 is expressed at low levels on various non-hematopoietic tissues, most notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen-presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments. PD-L2 is thought to control immune T-cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD-L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T-cell function in peripheral tissues (Hiraoka et al., 2010). Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD-L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T-cell inhibitor. PD-1 has been suggested to regulate tumor-specific T-cell expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL) (Liotta et al., 2010). This suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.  MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab) is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. MK -3475 (Pembrolizumab) has 
recently been approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma and patients with metastatic non-small cell lung 
cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 as determined by an FDA-approved test and who have disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.  
MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab) Preclinical and Clinical Study Data 
2.4.1 Nonclinical Toxicology 
 The safety of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) was evaluated in a 1-month and a 6-month 
repeat-dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys administered IV doses of 6, 40 or 200 mg/kg once a week in the 1-month study and once every 2 weeks in the 6-month study, followed by a 4-month treatment-free period. No findings of toxicological significance were observed and the NOAEL in both studies was ≥200 mg/kg, which produced exposure multiples of 19 and 94 times the exposure in humans at doses of 10 and 2 mg/kg, respectively. The exposure multiple between the NOAEL and a human dose of 200 mg was 74.  The carcinogenic potential of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in long-term animal studies, as 
well as the genotoxic potential o f MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) have not been evaluated as 
these studies are not required to support treatment of cancer patients. 
 
NRG -GY016    10 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020  
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ). 
The central  function of the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway i s to preserve pregnancy by maintaining 
immune  tolerance to the fetus. Blockade of PD -L1 signaling has been shown in murine 
models of  pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the fetus and to result in an increase in fetal 
loss. These  results indicate a potential risk that administration of MK-3475 
(pembrolizumab ) during pregnancy could  cause fetal harm, including increased rates of 
abortion or stillbirth.  
 
Developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with MK-3475 
(pembrolizumab ). There were  no notable ef fects in the male and female reproductive 
organs in monkeys based on 1 -month  and 6 -month repeat dose toxicity studies.  
 
2.4.2 Clinical Efficacy  
 
Many clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of MK-3475 
(pembrolizumab ) to treat  various cancers . MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) has demonstrated  
robust, substantial, and clinically meaningful benefit in the treatment of melanoma, non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) , head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ), 
urothelial carcinoma ( UC), and microsatellite  instability -high ( MSI-H) tumors based on 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) criteria and 
immune -related RECIST (irRECIST)  recommendations. For classical Hodgkin 
lymphoma ( cHL), demonstration of clinically meaningful bene fit was based on  Revised 
Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (2007) from the International Working  
Group (IWG).  
 
For the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma, MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) 
demonstrated  superior efficacy over available treatment options (IPI, Investigator’s 
choice chemotherapy)  in participants with advanced melanoma who were treatment -
naïve, as well as those who  progressed on prior therapy, including IPI.  
 
MK-3475 ( Pembrolizumab ) provided substantial, clinically meaningful benefit s in OS, 
PFS, and ORR in  participants with NSCLC who progressed after platinum -containing 
chemotherapy and  whose tumor cells expressed PD -L1. In previously treated participants 
with PD -L1 TPS ≥1%  and disease progression following platinum -containing 
chemot herapy, MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) provided a statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful OS benefit compared to standard  docetaxel chemotherapy. For 
participants with previously untreated metastatic NSCLC  whose tumors express high 
levels of PD -L1, MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) demonstrated significant  improvements in 
PFS and OS over standard of care chemotherapy.  
 
For the treatment of advanced HNSCC in a heavily pretreated population, MK-3475 
(pembrolizumab ) demonstrated a clinically meaningful response rate and a prolonged 
duration of response that  is substantially distinct from what is expected with standard of 
care in previously treated  participants with HNSCC, and points to the meaningful clinical 
benefit of MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ). 
 
NRG -GY016    11 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020  
MK-3475 ( Pembrolizumab ) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory cHL, has 
demonstrated durable,  robust, clinically meaningful responses in this heavily pretreated 
population that generally  included standard front -line therapies, salvage therapies, auto -
SCT if el igible with  chemo -sensitive disease, other single agent or combination 
chemotherapy regimens as needed,  and with or without brentuximab vedotin (BV).  
 
For the treatment of urothelial carcinoma (UC)  in participants who have not received 
prior chemotherapy a nd are  cisplatin -ineligible, MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) 
demonstrated a clinically meaningful ORR in  participants with locally advanced or 
metastatic UC. In participants with locally advanced or  metastatic UC who have received 
platinum -containing chemotherapy,  treatment with  MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) 
demonstrated a significant improvement in OS and a clinically meaningful  benefit in 
durable responses compared with standard of care therapies.  
 
In participants with MSI -H tumors, MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) provided evi dence of 
clinically  meaningful benefit over standard treatments, regardless of tumor histology.  
 
2.4.3 Clinical Safety  
 
MK-3475 ( Pembrolizumab ) has a positive benefit -risk profile and is well tolerated in the 
approved  indications, as evidenced by a low rate of toxicity Grade 3 to 5 drug -related 
adverse events ( AEs) (13.8%),  discontinuations due to AEs (11.9%), and deaths due to 
drug-related AEs (0.4%).  Furthermore, the frequency of immune -mediated adverse 
events of spec ial interest ( AEOSI ) is low, and these events are readily  managed in the 
clinical setting . 
 
MK-3475 (p embrolizumab ) is generally well tolerated and demonstrates a favorable 
safety profile in  comparison to chemotherapy. MK-3475 ( Pembrolizumab ) is an 
immunom odulatory agent, and based on  this mechanism of action, immune -mediated 
AEs are of primary concern. The important  identified risks for MK-3475 
(pembrolizumab ) are of an immune -mediated nature, and included the  following in the 
last IB (v13): pneumonitis; c olitis; hepatitis; nephritis; endocrinopathies that  include 
hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and secondary adrenal insufficiency),  thyroid 
disorder (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism), and Type I diabetes mellitus; uveitis;  
myositis; Guillain -Barré sy ndrome; pancreatitis; myocarditis; severe skin reactions 
including  Stevens -Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), some 
with fatal  outcome; and “solid organ transplant rejection following MK-3475 
(pembrolizumab ) treatment in donor  organ recipients” (risk applicable to post -marketing 
setting only, as such patients are currently  excluded from Merck clinical trials with MK-
3475 ( pembrolizumab )). The majority of immune -mediated  AEs were mild to moderate 
in severity, manageable with appropri ate care, and  rarely required discontinuation of 
therapy.  
 
In addition to the immune -related risks noted above, infusion -related reactions are also an  
important identified risk for MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ); however, they are not 
considered  immune -mediated.  
NRG-GY016   12 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020 
 
Consultation with the appropriate medical specialist should be considered when investigating a possible immune-related adverse event (irAE). These events can occur at times ranging from after the first dose to several months after the last dose of treatment. Mild irAEs are usually treated symptomatically and infrequently require dosing delays or 
discontinuation. Higher grade and persistent lower grade irAEs typically necessitate 
withholding or discontinuing treatment, and administration of systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive agents (such as tumor necrosis factor blockers) when systemic steroids are not effective. Early recognition of irAEs and initiation of treatment are critical to reduce the risk of complications because the majority of irAEs are reversible with the use of steroids and other immune suppressants.  
Rationale for the Study and Selected Patient Population 
 
In studies evaluating activity of anti- PD-1 or anti- PD-L1 antibodies in ovarian cancer, 
eligible patients have included all histologic subtypes of ovarian cancer, mainly high grade serous histology (Haminishi et al., 2015; Disis et al., 2015). Notably, in two studies, durable objective responses were seen in patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma. In a phase II study by Hamanishi et al. (2015), 20 patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer were treated with nivolumab, an anti- PD-1 antibody. The disease 
control rate was 45%. Two patients had a durable complete response (CR), one of whom had clear cell carcinoma with recurrent disease and peritoneal dissemination. After two courses of nivolumab, the peritoneal lesions disappeared and CA-125 decreased to normal range. The patient completed a 1-year trial of nivolumab and continued to 
experience a CR at time of study publication. In another phase II study by Disis et al. 
(2015), avelumab, an anti- PD-L1 antibody, was evaluated in recurrent ovarian cancer 
patients with multiple previous lines of chemotherapy. Among 75 patients, there was an overall response rate of 17.4% and stable disease in 47.8%. Tumor shrinkage by ≥30% was observed in 14.7% of patients, including 2 patients with clear cell histology. These cases are compelling given the general chemo-refractory state of recurrent ovarian clear cell carcinomas. These immune checkpoint inhibitors may have particular benefit for patients with this rare histologic subtype. At this point however, there have been no studies of immunotherapy dedicated to clear cell carcinomas of the ovary. 
Rationale for Combination Therapy with IDO-1 Inhibitor 
Although these early studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors in recurrent ovarian cancer 
have demonstrated promise, the overall response rate with these single agents is approximately 15%. In order to improve these results, strategies incorporating combinations of immunotherapy is needed. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have an important role in ovarian cancer pathogenesis and outcome (Sato et al., 2005; Wolf et al., 2005) . 
Low ratio of CD8+ T cells to CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs is associated with poor survival, and therefore Tregs are a potential target to disrupt local immune suppression in ovarian cancer (Preston et al., 2013). In clear cell ovarian cancers specifically, inherited 
variants in genes encoding Treg related immune molecules are significantly associated 
NRG-GY016   13 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020 
with poorer survival compared to serous cancers (Goode et al., 2013). Moreover, in 
contrast to high grade serous cancers where the increase of CD8+ T cells is associated with improved survival (HR 0.57, 95%CI 0.49-0.65, p=4.2 x 10
-16), in clear cell cancers 
there is no association between CD8+ T cells and survival (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.61-1.39, p=0.50), possibly because of the prominent role of Tregs in this subtype (Goode et al. , 
2017). An agent that can address the high degree of Tregs in the tumor microenvironment in combination with an anti- PD-1 antibody could enhance the immunotherapy effect that 
has been initially seen in clear cell carcinoma. 
Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is an enzyme that catalyzes oxidative cataboli sm 
of the amino acid tryptophan (Trp) to kynurenine (Takikawa et al., 2005). This 
catabolism of Trp results in the inhibition of antitumor cell–mediated immune responses. Histologic evaluation of most human cancers shows extensive infiltration by inflammatory and immune cells, suggesting that the immune system does recognize and respond to the presence of the malignancy (Galon et al., 2006), but in most cases the immune response is ineffective in inhibiting or eradicating tumor growth. Many tumor cells or the infiltrating immune cells overexpress IDO1, and there have been multiple lines of evidence to suggest that IDO1 is a key regulator in the immunosuppressive mechanisms responsible for tumor escape from immune surveillance (Liu et al., 2009). Therefore, inhibition of this enzyme may provide a unique method to treat malignancies, either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutics or other immune-based therapies.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Epacadostat Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background
 
Epacadostat (INCB024360) is a potent, selective oral inhibitor of IDO1. Inhibiting IDO1 leads to decreased kynurenine, and downstream downregulation of Tregs, thereby increasing the antitumor immune response. Because IDO1 catabolism of tryptophan (Trp) inhibits T- cell–mediated immune responses and IDO1 expression has been shown to be 
elevated in many human cancers, IDO1 inhibition may restore an effective antitumor immune response and may provide a method to treat malignant diseases either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutics and/or immunotherapy-
based strategies.

2.8.2 Clinical Efficacy  
 
There is no evidence of clinically meaningful antitumor activity for epacadostat 
monotherapy.  Based on preliminary data from ongoing Study INCB 24360 -202, 
epacadostat in combinati on with MK -3475 (pembrolizumab) demonstrated promising 
antitumor activity in subjects with advanced melanoma, head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma (HNSCC), NSCLC, UC, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC); the response 
outcomes in triple negative breast carcinom a (TNBC) and ovarian cancer were consistent 
with those previously reported for MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab ) monotherapy in PD -L1–
positive subjects.

Epacadostat in combination with MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab) 
Preliminary results from a phase I/II study of epacadostat in combination with MK-3475 
(pembrolizumab), an anti- PD-1 antibody, have been reported in patients with advanced 
cancers (Gangadhar et al., 2015). In this dose-escalation and dose-expansion study, 
patients were given MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) 2 mg/kg IV or 200 mg IV every 3 weeks 
with epacadostat at doses of 25 mg PO BID, 50 mg BID, 100 mg BID. Nineteen patients were evaluable. Overall response rate was 53% with 3 complete responses. The overall disease control rate was 74%, with an especially profound effect in patients with melanoma. The latest updated results have demonstrated that epacadostat in combination with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) demonstrates promising anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced melanoma, HNSCC, NSCLC, UC, and RCC with ORRs of 33%-56%. The 
disease control rates (DCRs) were 50-71%. 
NRG-GY016   17 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020 
 
In Phase 2 of this study, 294 subjects received ≥ 1 dose of study treatment (epacadostat 100 mg BID + MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab) 200 mg Q3W) and were included in the 
safety analysis. The median (range) epacadostat exposure was 13.6 (1.0+ to 70.7+) weeks. 
 
Treatment-related TEAEs occurred in 67% of Phase 2 subjects and Grade 3/4 treatment-related TEAEs occurred in 18% of Phase 2 subjects. The most common treatment-related TEAEs were fatigue, rash, nausea, and pruritus. The frequency of Grade 3/4 treatment-related TEAEs was low across all tumor types.  Treatment-related TEAEs leading to dose interruptions occurred in 18% of subjects; the most common were rash (3%), fatigue (3%), and lipase increased (3%). Treatment-related TEAEs leading to dose reductions occurred in 5% of subjects; the most common were rash (2%), fatigue (2%), and lipase increased (1%). Treatment-related TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 4% of subjects; the most common were arthralgia and rash (n = 2 each).  There was 1 treatment-related death due to respiratory failure (secondary to aspiration pneumonia; pneumonitis could not be ruled out). TEAEs of special interest and Grade 3/4 TEAEs of special interest occurred in 11% and 4% of subjects, respectively.  The frequency of Grade 3/4 AEs was low and similar across all tumor types.  Based on this data, a phase III study in melanoma comparing MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) 
+ epacadostat versus MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) alone has been activated 
(clinicaltrials.gov). 
 
Currently,  although  there is a Phase I/II study of MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) and 
epacadostat in patients with selected cancers, which includes  ovarian neoplasms 
(clinicaltrials.gov)  to date, there have been no clear cell carcinomas included amongst the 
enrolled ovarian cancer patients due to the rarity of this subtype.  
 
 
 
Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen: Fixed Do se MK -3475 (Pembrolizumab)
 
The dose regimen of 200 mg Q3W of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) is planned for all 
urothelial cancer trials. Available PK results in subjects with melanoma, NSCLC, and other solid tumor types support a lack of meaningful difference in PK exposures obtained at a given dose among tumor types. An open-label Phase I trial (PN001) in melanoma subjects is being conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of single agent MK-3475 (pembrolizumab). The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three dose 
levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects 
with advanced solid tumors. All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose-
NRG -GY016    18 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020  
limiting toxicities were observed. This first in human study  of MK-3475 
(pembrolizumab ) showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor 
size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W). No maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) has been identified.  
 
In KEYNOTE -001, two randomized coh ort evaluations of melanoma subjects receiving 
MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) at a dose of 2 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg Q3W have been 
completed. The clinical efficacy and safety data demonstrate a lack of clinically 
important differences in efficacy response or safety  profile at these doses. For example, 
in Cohort B2, advanced melanoma subjects who had received prior ipilimumab therapy 
were randomized to receive MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) at 2 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg 
Q3W. The overall response rate (ORR) was 26% (21/81) in t he 2mg/kg group and 26% 
(25/79) in the 10 mg/kg group (full  analysis set (FAS)). The proportion of subjects with 
drug-related adverse events (AEs), grade 3 -5 drug -related AEs, serious drug -related AEs, 
death or discontinuation due to an AE was comparable b etween groups or lower in the 10 
mg/kg group.  
 
Available pharmacokinetic results in subjects with melanoma, NSCLC, and other solid 
tumor types support a lack of meaningful difference in pharmacokinetic exposures 
obtained at a given dose among tumor types. Population PK analysis has been performed 
and h as confirmed the expectation that intrinsic factors do not affect exposure to MK-
3475 ( pembrolizumab ) to a clinically meaningful extent. Taken together, these data 
support the use of lower doses (with similar exposure to 2 mg/kg Q3W) in all solid tumor 
indications. 2 mg/kg Q3W is being evaluated in NSCLC in PN001, Cohort F30 and 
PN010, and 200 mg Q3W is being evaluated in head and neck cancer in PN012, which 
are expected to provide additional data supporting the dose selection.

Rationale for Current Trial 
 
Inhibition of the PD-1 receptor is promising with early results demonstrating examples of durable objective responses in patients with clear cell carcinomas of the ovary. However, 
the immunotherapy studies in ovarian cancer have included all histologic types and there 
has not been a dedicated study for clear cell carcinomas. It is clear from early studies that a combination approach for immunotherapy is warranted to improve response rates even further. The combination of MK -3475 (pembrolizumab) (anti- PD-1 antibody) and 
epacadostat (IDO1 inhibitor) has demonstrated promising results in melanoma, such that a phase III trial in melanoma is being conducted with this combination. This combination should be applied to recurrent clear cell carcinomas to determine if the profound effects of PD-1 inhibition can be further enhanced with IDO1 inhibition. For recurrent clear cell ovarian cancer in particular, where historically the response to standard chemotherapy is <10%, an improvement in this outcome is greatly needed. 
2.13 Translational Research Background 
Recurrent clear cell ovari an cancer (CCOC) has a poor prognosis and limited treatment 
options.  The current protocol tests the combination of the PD -1-blocking monoclonal 
antibody MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) (PEM) and the IDO -1 inhibitor epacadostat (EPAC) 
in patients with recurrent CC OC.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key peripheral mediators of immunologic self -tolerance 
and can downmodulate inflammatory responses to self -tissues (Panduro et al.,  2016) .  
Ovarian tumors are frequently infiltrated by Tregs, and Tregs are associated with poor 
prognosis in ovarian cancer (Curiel et al., 2004) .

eligibility questions, please contact RTQA (via the contact list on the NRG web site). [Insert 
appropriate center/person and location of contact information]  
Patient Selection Guidelines 
Although the guidelines provided below in 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 are not inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, investigators should consider these factors when selecting patients for this trial. Investigators also should consider all other relevant factors (medical and non-medical), as well as the risks and benefits of the study therapy, when deciding if a patient is an appropriate candidate for this trial. 
 Patients must have the psychological ability and general health that permits completion of the study requirements and required follow up. 
 Submission of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tumor tissue is required for all patients. Investigators should check with their site Pathology Department regarding release of biospecimens before approaching patients about participation in the trial. (See details of X submissions in Sections 9 and 10.) 
Eligibility Criteria
A patient cannot be considered eligible for this study unless ALL of the following 
conditions are met. 
Primary tumors must be at least 50% clear cell histomorphology in order to be eligible or 
have a histologically documented recurrence with at least 50% clear cell 
histomorphology. Recurrence should be biopsy proven as per standard of care unless the tumor is located in an area deemed unsafe to biopsy. Histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required via the pathology report.  The percentage of clear cell histomorphology must be documented in the pathology report or in an addendum to the original report. If slides of the primary tumor are not available for review due to disposal of slides by the histology laboratory (typically 10 years after diagnosis), a biopsy of the recurrent or persistent tumor is required to confirm at least 50% clear cell histomorphology, as long as tumor is located in an area deemed safe to biopsy. The percentage of clear cell involvement must be documented in the pathology report or in an addendum to the original report. 
All patents must have measurable disease, and at least one “target lesion” to be used to assess response as defined by RECIST 1.1. 
Measurable disease is defined as at least one 
lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded). Each lesion must be ≥ 10 mm when measured by CT, MRI or caliper measurement 
by clinical exam; or ≥ 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray. Lymph nodes must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI.

consent is withdrawn.  
Monitor patients for delayed 
toxicity and survival following 
disease progression  X 
*In the case that protocol directed therapy is discontinued for reasons other than disease progression, follow radiographic tumor measurement schedule as defined under Assessments during Treatment (until disease progression documented by RECIST 1.1 or until patient initiates a subsequent cancer therapy). 
5. TREATMENT PLAN/REGIMEN DESCRIPTION 
Treatment Plan  
All patients will receive MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) 200 mg IV q 3 weeks and epacadostat 100 
mg orally twice a day continuously until disease progression or adverse effects prohibit further 
treatment. A cycle equals 21 days. 
Patients will be given a Patient Medication Calendar to complete daily for epacadostat 
(Appendix IV ).The Patient Medication Calendar should be reviewed prior to the start of 
each cycle.  
Epacadostat 
Route of Administration: Epacadostat will be administered as an oral tablet. 
 
Dose to be Administered: The dose of epacadostat will be 100 mg orally twice a day, in 
the morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart.  Dosing Instructions:  Oral, may be administered without regard to food. If the morning or 
evening dose is missed by more than 4 hours, that dose should be skipped and the next 
NRG-GY016   28 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020 
scheduled dose should be taken at the usual time.  If a patient vomits after taking a tablet, the 
dose should be skipped.  
  
5.1.2 MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab)  
Route of Administration: MK -3475 (Pembrolizumab) will be administered as an IV 
infusion.  
 Dose to be Administered: The dose of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) will be 200 mg (fixed 
dose) IV every 3 weeks.   Dosing Instructions: Patients will receive MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) as an IV infusion 
over 30 minutes. Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible. However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of 25-40 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 25-40 minutes).   Preparation and Administration: See Section 9.1 for specific instructions for the preparation of the MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) infusion fluid and administration of 
infusion solution.  
5.1.3   A patient will be permitted to have an infusion delayed up to 7 days (without this being 
considered a protocol violation) for major life events (e.g. serious illness in a family member, major holiday, vacation which is unable to be rescheduled). Documentation to justify this decision should be provided, and the Study Chair  should be notified. 
It will be acceptable for individual infusions to be delivered within a 24-hour window 
before or after the protocol-defined date. If the treatment due date is a Friday, and the patient cannot be treated on that Friday, then the window for treatment would include the Thursday (1 day earlier than due) through the Monday (3 days past due). 
General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines
Permitted Supportive/Ancillary Care and Concomitant Medications All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a patient’s welfare may be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of medical care. All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) including all prescription, over- the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and 
IV medications and fluids. If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the CRF. 
All concomitant medications received within 28 days before the first dose of MK-3475 
(pembrolizumab) and 30 days after the last dose of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) should be 
recorded. Concomitant medications administered after 30 days after the last dose of MK-
3475 (pembrolizumab) should be recorded for serious adverse events (SAEs) and events 
of clinical interest (ECIs) as defined in Section 7.  
NRG-GY016   29 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020 
Epacadostat (INCB024360) is a substrate of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, UGT1A9, P-
gp, and BRCP. Use caution when administering with strong inhibitors/inducers of these isoenzymes and transporter proteins. Because there is a potential for interaction of epacadostat (INCB024360) with other concomitantly administered drugs. The Principal Investigator should be alerted if the patient is taking any agent known to affect or with 
the potential for drug interactions. The study team should check a frequently-updated 
medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of. Appendix V  (Patient 
Drug Information Handout and Wallet Card) should be provided to patients.  Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin. Close INR monitoring is recommended for subjects on a stable dose of warfarin who are starting treatment with epacadostat (INCB024360).  
Prohibited Therapies Patients are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during treatment on this trial:  •  
 Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol;  
Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol; 
 Radiation therapy not specified in this protocol;  
 Investigational agents other than MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) and epacadostat ;  
 Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the 
following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and 
typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed. 
 Glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an adverse 
event of suspected immunologic etiology. The use of physiologic doses of 
corticosteroids (defined as 10 mg prednisone) are acceptable, however site investigators should consult with the Study Chair for any dose higher than 10 mg 
prednisone. 
 Epacadostat (INCB024360) may cause an increase in serotonin levels which has the 
potential to precipitate serotonin syndrome when administered in combination with 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or serotonergic agents.  Concomitant use of MAO inhibitors or serotonergic agents is prohibited.   
 
 
Note : The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation 
with the Principal Investigator.  
Patients who, in the assessment of the treating investigator, require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from protocol treatment. Patients may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be 
medically necessary. 
NRG-GY016   30 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020 
See Section 3.3 , which describes other medications, which are prohibited in this trial. 
 
Duration of Therapy 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue as 
specified in the above treatment modality sections or until one of the following criteria 
applies: 
 Disease progression, 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, 
 Unacceptable adverse event(s), as described in Section 6 
 Patient decides to withdraw consent for participation in the study, or 
 General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. 
6. TREATMENT MODIFICATIONS/MANAGEMENT 
Adverse Drug Reactions requiring Discontinuation or Delays:
The following adverse drug reactions (ADRs) require permanent treatment 
discontinuation of MK -3475 (pembrolizumab) and epacadostat: 
Any Grade 4 ADRs require permanent treatment discontinuation with MK-3475 
(pembrolizumab) and epacadostat except for single laboratory values out of normal range that are unlikely related to trial treatment as assessed by the Investigator, do not have any 
clinical correlate, and resolve within 7 days with adequate medical management. 
Persistent Grade 2 or 3 adverse reactions (excluding endocrinopathies controlled with 
hormone replacement therapy) do not improve to Grade 0-1 within 8 weeks of last dose. 
Unable to reduce corticosteroid dose to 10 mg or less of prednisone or equivalent per day within 8 weeks. 
Any Grade 3 (severe) treatment-related or immune-mediated adverse reaction occurs. 
6.1.5 Patients who experience an unacceptable adverse event strictly due to epacadostat such 
that the patient requires permanent treatment discontinuation of epacadostat alone, following resolution of toxicity to ≤ grade 1 and permission from the Study Chair or Co-Chair, the patient can continue the use of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) alone. This should be confirmed with the Study Chair or Co-Chair on an individual basis. The same management guidelines should be followed, and any patient with any further unacceptable adverse events while receiving MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) alone should be taken off study treatment permanently. 
Tumor assessments should continue if protocol therapy is discontinued for reasons other than 
disease progression (see protocol section 4).
NRG-GY016   31 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020 
MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) Infusion-Related Reactions 
Since MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) contains only human immunoglobulin protein 
sequences, it is unlikely to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity 
reactions. However, if such a reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, urticaria, angioedema, pruritus, arthralgia, hypo- or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms.   All Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions should be reported as an SAE if criteria are met. Infusion reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE version 5.0 guidelines.   Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines as medically appropriate:  
 
For Grade 1 infusion reaction: (Mild transient reaction; infusion interruption not 
indicated; intervention not indicated)  
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. Infusion rate may be slowed. If the infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor patient closely.  
 
For Grade 2 infusion reaction : (Therapy or infusion interruption indicated but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment [ e.g., antihistamines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs, narcotics, IV fluids]; prophylactic medications indicated for ≤ 24 hours).  
Stop the MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and 
treat the subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen 500 to 1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor patient until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor patient closely. If symptoms recur, then no further MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) will be administered at that visit. 
Administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and remain at bedside and monitor the patient until resolution of symptoms. The amount of study drug infused must be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF). The following prophylactic pre-medications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and acetaminophen 500 to 1000 mg should be administered at least 30 minutes before additional MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) administrations. If necessary, corticosteroids 
(recommended dose: up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used.  
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 infusion reaction: Grade 3: (Prolonged [e .g., not rapidly 
responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence 
of symptoms following initial improvement; hospitalization indicated for other clinical 
sequelae); or Grade 4: (Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated).  
NRG -GY016    32 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020  
Immediately discontinue infusion of  MK-3475  (pembrolizumab ). Begin an IV inf usion of 
normal saline, and treat the subject as follows. Recommend bronchodilators, epinephrine 
0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 
1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphen hydramine 50 mg 
IV with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Patient should be 
monitored until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. MK-
3475 ( Pembrolizumab ) will be permanently discontinued. Investigators sho uld follow 
their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and 
monitor patient until recovery from symptoms. In the case of late -occurring 
hypersensitivity symptoms ( e.g., appearance of a localized or generalized pruritus  within 
1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given ( e.g., oral anti histamine, or 
corticosteroids).  
 
Please note that late occurring events including isolated fever and fatigue may represent 
the presentation of systemic inflammation. Please  evaluate accordingly.

Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAEs) General Definition, Monitoring, and 
Management  
For the purposes of this protocol, an immune-related adverse reaction irAE is defined as 
an adverse reaction of unknown etiology associated with drug exposure and consistent with an immune phenomenon. Efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin or other etiologic causes prior to labeling an event an irAEs. Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data should be used to support the diagnosis of an immune-related toxicity. Suspected immune-related adverse reactions must be documented in CTEP-AERS.  Overall, immune-related AEs commonly start within 3 to 10 weeks from initiation of therapy and are in most cases successfully managed by delaying doses, discontinuing dosing, and/or through administering symptomatic or immunosuppressive therapy, including corticosteroids, as mentioned below. Immune-related AEs generally resolved within days to weeks in the majority of subjects.  Patients should be informed of and carefully monitored for evidence of clinically significant systemic immune-mediated adverse reactions (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus-like diseases) or organ-specific immune-mediated adverse reaction (e.g., rash, colitis, uveitis, hepatitis or thyroid disease). If an immune-mediated adverse reaction is noted, appropriate work-up (including biopsy if possible) should be performed, and steroid therapy may be considered if clinically necessary.  
Below are dose delay tables for MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) (depending on assigned 
NRG -GY016    34 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020  
treatment regimen) related to adverse events. Pa tients may be dose -delayed for evaluation 
and restarted depending on results.  
 
Investigators should as a rule evaluate suspected adverse effects early, and with any 
suspicion, erring on the side of caution by withholding drug and instituting 
appropriate t reatment as indicated in the management tables and following event 
specific guidelines.  
 
There are no dose reductions for MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ). If the patient meets 
retreatment criteria, the full dose of 200 mg will be administered. If patients do not m eet 
retreatment criteria, then the  dose of MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) will be HELD and the 
patient re -evaluated weekly until retreatment criteria are met.  
 
Adverse events (both non -serious and se rious) associated with MK-3475 
(pembrolizumab ) exposure may repr esent an immunologic etiology. These adverse events 
may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of tr eatment. 
MK-3475 ( Pembrolizumab ) must be withheld for drug -related toxicities and severe or 
life-threatening AEs as per the table below.  
 
If MK -3475 (pembrolizumab) and epacadostat are withheld for drug -related toxicities , 
radiographic tumor measurement and chest imaging should still con tinue every 6 weeks 
(+/- 7 days), as outlined  in Section 4, Assessments During Treatment.  Once MK -3475 
(pembrolizumab) and epacadostat are  restarted, imaging assessments will resume every 6 
weeks from the time the drugs are restarted  until week 49.  
 
Althou gh these guidelines are for immune -related AEs attributable to MK-3475 
(pembrolizumab ), it is also meant to be applied to any suspected immune -related AEs 
from epacadostat or the combination of epacadostat with other immune -targeted agents.

Supportive Care Guidelines
Patients should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the 
treating investigator. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below. Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti-inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids. Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as 
symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be related to MK-
3475 (pembrolizumab).  Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator 
does not need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined below). 
 
NRG -GY016    37 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as b ronchoscopy, endoscopy, 
or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.  
 
Pneumonitis:  
 For Grade 2 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms  improve to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no  less than 4 
weeks.  
 For Grade 3 -4 events, immediately treat with intravenous steroids. Administer  
additional anti -inflammatory measures, as need ed. 
 Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged  
steroid administration.  
 
Diarrhea/Colitis:  
Patients should be carefully monitored for signs and sym ptoms of enterocolitis (such as 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or muc us in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).  
 All patients who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal  
quantities of clear fluids. If sufficient oral fluid in take is not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion. For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea,  
consider GI consultation and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis.  
 For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis, administer oral corticosteroids.  
 For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/co litis, treat with intravenous steroids followed by  high 
dose oral steroids.  
 When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and  
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus  (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or 
≥ Grade 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic 
acidosis  
(DKA)  
 For T1DM or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia  
o Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and for 
Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia a ssociated with metabolic acidosis or  ketonuria.  
o Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, 
glycosylated hemoglobin, and C -peptide.  
 
Hypophysitis:  
 For Grade 2 events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade  
1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by  oral 
corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper  should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of  appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 
 
NRG -GY016    38 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020  
Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism:  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in 
thyroid function (TSH and free T4 at the intervals sp ecified, and as indicated based on 
clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and sy mptoms of thyroid disorders. N o 
intervention is required for Grade 1 hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism events.  
 Grade 2 hyperthyroidism events:  
o In hyperthyroidism, non -selective beta -blockers (e.g. propranolol) are  suggested 
as initial therapy.  
o In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with  levothyroxine or 
liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care.  
 Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism events:  
o Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by oral  corticosteroids. 
When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, stero id taper  should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of  appropriate hormones may 
be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 
Hepatic:  
 For Grade 2 events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned to  
baseline va lues (consider weekly).  
o Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
 For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours.  
 When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and  
continued over no less than 4 wee ks. 
 
Renal Failure or Nephritis:  
 For Grade 2 events, hold MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab)  and epacadostat and treat with 
vigorous hydratio n and oral corticosteroids. Monitor renal function weekly until 
returned to baseline values.  
Note: if event is considered clin ically unrelated o r unlikely to be related to MK-3475 
(pembrolizumab) , and an alternate clinical expl anation is likely, probable, or definite in 
the judgment of the investigator (example, attributable to prerenal azotemia in the 
setting of nausea , and responding to hydration), then corticosteroids may be omitted and 
MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab)  and epacadostat may be administered.  
 For Grade 3 -4 events, hospitalization is indicated. Treat with vigorous hydration  and 
IV corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours . Monitor renal function frequently.  
Consultation with nephrology is recommended.  
 When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and

 Recommendations to managing irAEs not detailed elsewhere in the protocol are detailed in the Table below:  
TABLE: General Approach to Handling IRAEs 
irAE  Withhold/Discontinue MK-3475 
(pembrolizumab)  and Epacadostat ? Supportive Care  
Grade 1  No action  
 Provide symptomatic treatment  
Grade 2  May withhold MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) 
and epacadostat Consider systemic corticosteroids in 
addition to appropriate symptomatic 
treatment. 
 
Grade 3 and Grade 4  Withhold MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) and 
epacadostat  
Discontinue if unable to reduce corticosteroid dose to < 10 mg per day prednisone 
equivalent within 8 weeks of toxicity. 
 Systemic corticosteroids are 
indicated in addition to appropriate symptomatic treatment. May utilize 
1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or 
equivalent. 
 Steroid taper should be considered once symptoms improve to Grade 1 
or less and tapered over at least 4 
weeks.  
 
 
Serotonin Syndrome 
Serotonin syndrome has not been reported in any completed or ongoing studies. 
 There is a potential concern that epacadostat could cause an increase in serotonin levels in the brain that might trigger serotonin syndrome, when administered alone or in combination with other serotonergic agents. This rare syndrome has been associated with some MAOIs and combinations of serotonergic drugs (Boyer and Shannon 2005). The clinical manifestations of serotonin syndrome range from barely perceptible to lethal. Nonclinical data suggest that serotonin syndrome is unlikely following treatment with either epacadostat alone or in combination with MAOIs such as linezolid (Zhang et al 2016). As of 29 OCT 2017, 2 subjects treated across the epacadostat program have events reported as serotonin syndrome or symptoms of serotonin syndrome; both episodes were confounded, mild in severity, and resolved with dose interruption. Neither report was clinically substantiated to represent a true case of serotonin syndrome by the sponsor. Although the incidence of serotonin syndrome or symptoms of serotonin syndrome is rare, use of MAOIs or SSRIs is prohibited during the study. Subjects should be provided 
information describing the signs and symptoms of the syndrome along with instructions 
to seek immediate medical care if any signs or symptoms is observed (Appendix V).

7. ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Protocol Agents 
Investigational Agents 
MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab) and Epacadostat are the investigational agents administered in NRG-GY016, and are available under IND sponsored by DCTD, NCI.  For MK-3475 
(Pembrolizumab) and Epacadostat, determination of whether an adverse event meets expedited reporting criteria, see the reporting table in section 7.4 of the protocol.
Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
This study will utilize the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 for CTEP-AERS (CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System) CAERs reporting of adverse events (AEs), located on the CTEP web site, http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic applications/ctc.htm . All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. Definition of an Adverse Event (AE) Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product (attribution of unrelated, 
unlikely, possible, probable, or definite). (International Conference on Harmonisation 
[ICH], E2A, E6).  
For multi-modality trials, adverse event reporting encompasses all aspects of protocol 
treatment including radiation therapy, surgery, device, and drug. 
Due to the risk of intrauterine exposure of a fetus to potentially teratogenic agents, the 
pregnancy of a study participant must be reported via CTEP-AERS in an expedited 
manner.

Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events 
All serious adverse events that meet expedited reporting criteria defined in the reporting 
table below will be reported via the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System, CTEP-
AERS, accessed via the CTEP web site,  
https://eapps-ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers/pages/task?rand=1390853489613  
NRG-GY016   47 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020 
Submitting a report via CTEP-AERS serves as notification to the NRG 
Biostatistical/Data Management Center and satisfies NRG requirements for expedited adverse event reporting.  
CTEP-AERS provides a radiation therapy-only pathway for events experienced that 
involve radiation therapy only. These events must be reported via the CTEP-AERS radiation therapy-only pathway.  
In the rare event when Internet connectivity is disrupted, a 24-hour notification must be made to CTEP by telephone at 301- 897-7497, the NRG Biostatistical/Data Management 
Center by phone, (number to be provided) and to the NRG Regulatory Affairs by phone at 215-854-0770. An electronic report must be submitted immediately upon re-establishment of the Internet connection.  
Expedited Reporting Methods 
 Per CTEP NCI Guidelines for Adverse Event Reporting Requirements, a CTEP-
AERS-24 Hour Notification must be submitted within 24 hours of learning of the adverse event. Each CTEP-AERS24-hour notification must be followed by a 
complete report within 5 days.  
 Supporting source documentation is requested by the ING Sponsor for this study (CTEP/DCTD) and NRG as needed to complete adverse event review. When submitting supporting source documentation, include the protocol number, patient ID number, and CTEP-AERS ticket number on each page, and fax supporting documentation to CTEP at 301-230-0159 and NRG Regulatory Affairs at 215-854-
0716. 
 A serious adverse event that meets expedited reporting criteria outlined in the AE 
Reporting Tables but is assessed by the CTEP-AERS as “an action not 
recommended” must still be reported to fulfill NRG safety reporting obligations. Sites 
must bypass the “NOT recommended” assessment; the CTEP-AERS allows 
submission of all reports regardless of the results of the assessment.

Rave-CTEP-AERS Integration 
The RAVE Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Adverse Event Reporting 
System (CTEP-AERS) Integration enables evaluation of post-baseline Adverse 
Events (AE) entered in Rave to determine whether they require expedited 
reporting, and facilitates entry in CTEP-AERS for those AEs requiring expedited reporting.   
All AEs that occur after baseline are collected in Medidata Rave using the 
Adverse Event form, which is available for entry at each treatment or reporting 
period, and used to collect AEs that start during the period or persist from the previous reporting period. CRA will enter AEs that occur prior to the start of treatment on a baseline form that is not included in the Rave-CTEP-AERS integration. AEs that occur prior to enrollment must begin and end on the baseline Adverse Events form and should not be included on the standard Adverse Events form that is available at treatment unless there has been an increase in grade. 
Prior to sending AEs through the rules evaluation process, site staff should verify 
the following on the Adverse Event form in Rave: 
 The reporting period (course/cycle) is correct; and 
 AEs are recorded and complete (no missing fields) and the form is query 
free. 
The CRA reports AEs in Rave at the time the Investigator learns of the event. If 
the CRA modifies an AE, it must be re-submitted for rules evaluation. 
Upon completion of AE entry in Medidata Rave, the CRA submits the AE for 
rules evaluation by completing the Expedited Reporting Evaluation form. Both NCI and protocol-specific reporting rules evaluate the AEs submitted for expedited reporting. A report is initiated in CTEP-AERS using information entered in Medidata Rave for AEs that meet reporting requirements. The CRA completes the report by accessing CTEP-AERS via a direct link on the Medidata Rave Expedited Reporting Evaluation form. 
In the rare occurrence that Internet connectivity is lost; a 24-hour notification is to 
be made to CTEP by telephone at 301-897-7497. Once internet connectivity is restored, the 24-hour notification that was phoned in must be entered immediately into CTEP-AERS using the direct link from Medidata Rave. 
Additional information about the CTEP-AERS integration is available on the 
CTSU website:

Data Quality Portal 
The Data Quality Portal (DQP) provides a central location for site staff to manage 
unanswered queries and form delinquencies, monitor data quality and timeliness, generate reports, and review metrics.   The DQP is located on the CTSU members’ website under Data Management. The Rave Home section displays a table providing summary counts of Total Delinquencies and Total Queries. DQP Queries, DQP Delinquent Forms and the DQP Reports modules are available to access details and reports of unanswered queries, delinquent forms, and timeliness reports. Review the DQP modules on a regular basis to manage specified queries and delinquent forms. The DQP is accessible by site staff that are rostered to a site and have access to the CTSU website. Staff that have Rave study access can access the Rave study data using a direct link on the DQP.  To learn more about DQP use and access, click on the Help icon displayed on the Rave Home, DQP Queries, and DQP Delinquent Forms modules.  Note: Some Rave protocols may not have delinquent form details or reports specified on the DQP. A protocol must have the Calendar functionality implemented in Rave by the Lead Protocol Organization for delinquent form details and reports to be available on the 
DQP. Site staff should contact the LPO Data Manager for their protocol regarding 
questions about Rave Calendaring functionality.    
9. DRUG INFORMATION  
MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab) (NSC 776864)  
Other Names: Pembrolizumab, SCH 900475, KEYTRUDA® 
Classification : Anti- PD-1 MAb 
Molecular Weight: 148.9-149.5 KDa 
CAS Number:  1374853-91-4  
Mode of Action : The programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor is an inhibitory receptor 
expressed by T cells.  When bound to either of its ligands, PD-L1 or PD-L2, activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function.  The pathway may be engaged by 
tumor cells to suppress immune control.  MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) blocks the negative 
immune regulatory signaling by binding to the PD-1 receptor, inhibiting the interaction between 
PD-1 and its ligands. 
NRG -GY016    56 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020

Epacadostat (NSC 766086)  
Chemical Name: ( Z)-N-(3-Bromo-4-fluorophenyl)- N'-hydroxy-4- (2-(sulfamoylamino) 
ethylamino)-1,2,5-oxadiazole-3-carboximidamide 
Other Names:  INCB024360  
Classification : Indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitor 
Molecular Formula:  C11H13BrFN 7O4S M.W.: 438.23  
Approximate Solubility:  The solubility of INCB024360 at 25°C is approximately 0.1 mg/mL in 
all aqueous medium types studied (water,  pH 7.4 buffer, pH 8 buffer, and pH 2.1 buffer.  
Mode of Action : The enzyme IDO1 is responsible for the oxidation of tryptophan into 
kynurenine.  The catabolism of tryptophan by IDO1 inhibits T cell-mediated responses.  Within 
the immune system, IDO1 activity is induced in dendritic cells and macrophages localized at sites of inflammation.  By inhibiting IDO1 in tumor cells, epacadostat enhances T cell and 
natural killer cell proliferation and gamma interferon production while reducing regulatory T cell 
differentiation and dendritic cell apoptosis. 
Description: The epacadostat drug substance is a white to off-white powder. 
How Supplied:  Epacadostat is supplied by Incyte Corporation and distributed by the 
Pharmaceutical Management Branch, CTEP/DCTD/NCI as 100 mg uncoated tablets (white, 
round, debossed with the strength “100”)   The immediate release tablets contain drug substance, lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, croscarmellose sodium, colloidal 
silicon dioxide, and magnesium stearate.  Tablets are to be dispensed in the original bottles.  
Each bottle contains 35 tablets. 
Storage: Store at controlled room temperature (15-30°C/59-86°F). 
If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return epacadostat to between 15 and 
30°C and quarantine the supplies. Provide a detailed report of the excursion (including documentation of temperature monitoring and duration of the excursion) to PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov  for determination of suitability. 
Stability: Shelf -life stability studies of epacadostat tablets  are ongoing.  
Route  of Administration:  Oral administration. May be administered without regard to food. 
NRG-GY016   58 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020 
Potential Drug Interactions : Metabolism of INCB024360 occurs via CYP3A4, CYP1A2, 
CYP2C19, and UGT1A9 isoenzymes and via glucuronidation.  The potential for weak to 
moderate inhibitors of UGT1A9 to cause clinically significant drug interactions with epacadostat 
via inhibition of UGT1A9 activity is low. Results suggest that epacadostat is not a CYP inducer 
in vitro. Epacadostat has low potential to cause clinically significant drug-drug interactions 
through CYP and UGT inhibition and induction. Use caution when administered with strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and UGT1A9.  Epacadostat may cause an increase in serotonin levels which has the potential to precipitate serotonin syndrome when administered in combination with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or serotonergic agents.  Concomitant use of MAO inhibito rs or serotonergic agents is 
prohibited.   
Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin. Close INR monitoring 
is recommended for subjects on a stable dose of warfarin who are starting treatment with epacadostat. The dose of warfarin should be reduced when coadministered with epacadostat doses > 100 mg BID.  
Epacadostat and its metabolites are moderate inhibitors of OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, and 
OATP1B3. The potential for epacadostat to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions via uptake transporters is low. Studies suggest that epacadostat is likely a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. Epacadostat is a weak P-gp inhibitor, however the potential for epacadostat to cause drug-drug interactions through P-gp interaction is low at clinically relevant exposures. 
Epacadostat is not an inhibitor of BCRP. Use caution when administered with strong 
inhibitors/inducers of P-gp and BCRP.

NRG-GY016   62 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020 
Definition of Disease Assessments 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca  45:228-247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.
Disease Parameters  
Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in 
at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥10 mm with CT scan, as ≥20 mm by chest x-ray, or ≥10 mm with calipers by clinical exam. All tumor measurements must be recorded in decimal fractions of centimeters.  
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area will not be considered 
measurable unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy.  
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis wil l 
be measured and followed.  
Non-measurable disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable disease. Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pneumonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal/pelvic masses (identified by physical exam and not CT or MRI), are considered as non-measurable.  
Notes:  Bone lesions: Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the 
soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above. Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.  
Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
definition, simple cysts. ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. 
Target lesions: All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded 
NRG-GY016   63 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020 
and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions 
with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, and in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A 
sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow- up. 
Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  Chest x-ray: Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans), but NOT lung.  Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline, and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond 
the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all 
NRG-GY016   64 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020 
scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, subsequent image acquisitions should use the same 
type of scanner and follow the baseline imaging protocol as closely as possible. If possible, body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques.  
NRG will not allow PET-CT use for RECIST 1.1 response criteria.  
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response 
when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
CA-125 : CA125 cannot be used to assess response or progression in this study . If CA125 is 
initially above the upper normal limit, it must normalize for a patient to be considered in 
complete clinical response. Specific guidelines for CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) have been published [ JNCI 96:487-488, 2004]. In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer 
Intergroup has developed CA-125 progression criteria that are to be integrated with objective tumor assessment for use only in first-line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI 92:1534-1535, 2000].  
Cytology, Histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases, e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain.  It is mandatory to obtain cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when measurable disease has met criteria for response or stable disease. This confirmation is necessary to differentiate response or stable disease versus progressive disease, as an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment. 
Response Criteria  
Determination of response should take into consideration all target and non-target lesions and, if 
appropriate, biomarkers. 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
NRG -GY016    65 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020  
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%,  the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).  
 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify  for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters (i.e. the nadir) while on study.  
 
 
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions. All lymph nodes must be non -
pathological in size (<10 mm short axi s).  
 
Note: If CA -125 is initially above the upper normal limit, it must normalize for a patient to be 
considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) Progressive Disease (PD): 
Appearance of one or  more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non -target 
lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.  
 
Not evaluab le (NE):  When at least one non -target lesion is not evaluated at a particular time 
point.  
 
Although a clear progression of only “non -target” lesions is exceptional, the opinion of the 
treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
 
 
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progress ion/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Duration of Response 
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented. 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started, including the baseline measurements. 
NRG-GY016   67 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020 
Progression-Free Survival 
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time 
of progression or death, whichever occurs first. 
Survival 
Survival is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of death or the date 
of last contact. 
12. DATA AND RECORDS 
 
Summary of Data Submission 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical 
trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during the trial using Medidata Rave®. Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner for more timely monitoring of patient safety and care. See Sections 7.2 for information about expedited and routine reporting.  
Global Reporting/Monitoring 
 
This study will be monitored by the Clinical Data Update System (CDUS) version 3.0. 
Cumulative CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by electronic means. Reports are due January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31.  Monitoring Method for Protocol NRG-GY016: Complete 
 Note :  If your study has been assigned to CDUS-Complete reporting, all adverse events 
(both routine and expedited) that have occurred on the study and meet the mandatory CDUS reporting guidelines must be reported via the monitoring method identified above.  If your study has been assigned to CDUS-Abbreviated reporting, no adverse event reporting (routine or expedited) is required to be reported via CDUS, but expedited adverse events are still required to be submitted via CTEP- AERS.  
 
13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Study Design 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the anti-tumor activity for women 
receiving the combination of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) and epacadostat for recurrent or 
persistent clear cell carcinoma of the ovary.  The primary measure of efficacy is the objective tumor response rate, defined as a complete response or partial response. 
NRG-GY016   68 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020 
This is a single-arm, phase II clinical trial that will use a flexible, two-stage design (Chen 
et al., 1998).  Since it is a single-arm trial, it does not require randomization or stratification.  If the trial enters both stages, the total accrual target will be 23 patients but will be allowed to range from 21 to 25, due to the difficulty in accruing precise numbers of patients in a multicenter trial.  A hard stop on accrual will occur after accrual 
completes to the first stage (see Section 13.3.2).  The study will re-open to accrual in the 
event the study advances to the second stage. 
The biologic mechanism of the study agent is expected to impede the growth of tumors 
already present and inhibit the development of new metastases.  Therefore, the objective tumor response rate will be used as the primary measure of efficacy. 
Study Endpoints 
List of endpoints that correspond to the study objectives, e.g. the endpoint of overall 
survival for the study objective to evaluate the impact of drug X on overall survival in X population. Include endpoint definitions.  Primary endpoints: 
 Complete or partial objective tumor response within 7 months of study entry as assessed by RECIST v. 1.1 criteria
 Secondary endpoints: 
 Nature and degree of toxicity as assessed using CTCAE version 5 
 Progression-free survival 
 Overall survival 
Primary Objectives Study Design 
13.3.1 Primary Hypothesis and Endpoints 
The primary hypothesis of this study tests the proportion of patients with objective 
complete or partial tumor response ( 𝜋) evaluated by RECIST v. 1.1 criteria.  Based on 
predicted response rates in similar patient populations, the null hypothesis is that the 
proportion of patients with objective tumor response will be 15% or less, i.e.: 
H
0: 𝜋 ≤ 0.15. 
 The alternative hypothesis is the complement of the null parameter space (i.e. H
1: 𝜋 > 
0.15).  The study is powered to detect a 25 percentage point increase in response: 𝜋 = 
0.40. 
13.3.2 How Primary Endpoints Will Be Analyzed 
The study will use a flexible two-stage design with early stopping guidelines based on 
NRG-GY016   69 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020 
tumor response rate intended to limit the accrual of patients to ineffective treatments.  
The first stage of this study will target an accrual of 12 eligible patients, but in practice will permit accrual to range from 10 to 14 patients.  A hard stop on accrual will occur after 14 patients have enrolled in the study. If the number responding is less than or equal to 1, then the study will terminate early and the regimen will be declared uninteresting.  If 
there are at least 2 patients with response, the study advances to the second stage and the 
study re-opens to accrual.  If the study advances to the second stage, then the overall study accrual of 23 eligible patients will be targeted, but the actual accrual will be permitted to range from 21 to 25 patients.  If the number responding is less than or equal to 5 for a sample size of 21 – 23 patients or less than or equal to 6 for a sample size of 24 – 25 patients, then the regimen will be declared uninteresting to warrant further investigation.  All enrolled patients deemed eligible and who initiate study treatment will be included in the analysis of objective response.  Exact 95% confidence limits, accounting for interim analysis, will be provided in the final report. 
13.3.3 Sample Size and Power Calculations: All supporting assumptions and/or important 
considerations, such as expected sample size or patient cohorts. Also can include information such as over-accrual and how many patients are planned for enrollment to define power. 
A two-stage design was chosen to allow for flexibility in accrual.  The target sample size 
for the first stage is 12 eligible patients but allowed to vary between 10 and 14.  A hard stop on accrual will occur after 14 patients have enrolled in the study. The study will re-open to accrual in the even the study advances to the second stage. The target cumulative sample size at the second stage is 23 eligible patients but allowed to vary between 21 and 
25.  Across all possible accrual combinations and assuming uniform probabilities of 
accrual across these, the average probability of early termination is 45% under the null, and the average alpha and power are 0.08 and 0.91 respectively.  For most accrual combinations, the alpha is <0.10 and the power is >0.90.

monitoring committee.  The protocol monitoring team will consist of the Study Chair, the Study Statistician, the Study Co-Chairs, the Data Manager, and any others required.  After review of this information and any other information that may be relevant, the protocol monitoring team should reach a consensus on whether the accrual rate is 
sufficient to support completion of accrual, whether the rates of adverse events are low 
enough to be offset by the patient benefit hypothesized for intervention, and whether the number of events is sufficient to proceed to the next phase or sufficient to reach the definitive analysis.  Brief minutes of the meeting written by the Study Chair plus the Study Statistician’s report will be forwarded to the NRG Operations Office for archiving.  The NRG Operations Office will forward the meeting minutes and the report to the NRG Oncology Internal Early Phase Trial Oversight Committee for review at their regularly scheduled meetings.  See Section 13.7.6 for details regarding the Early Phase Trial Oversight Committee.

Oct. 1, 2012  Sept. 30, 2013  1.1/month  35 
There have been several trials recruiting patients with clear cell carcinoma of the ovary 
through NRG Oncology.  GOG-0254 was a two-stage, phase II trial of sunitinib that accrued 35 patients over 34 total months.  GOG-0283, a Phase II single-agent, open-label trial of dasatinib, accrued Stage I (all comers) with 26 evaluable in 11 months (2.4 patients per month), with 1.7 patients per month overall.  NRG-GY001 (cabozantinib) activated April 1, 2015 and enro lled its first stage (n=13) in 7 months.  The ovarian clear 
cell carcinoma community is active and a frequent inquirer for clinical trials.  Based on the accrual information above, the present trial is expected to accrue 1.5 patients/month (18 patients/yea r). 
 
Twelve eligible patients are required for the first stage (allowable range 10-14), with a 
cumulative target of 23 eligible patients (allowable range 21-25) in the second stage.    A 
hard stop on accrual will occur after 14 patients have enrolled in the study.  The study will re-open to accrual in the event the study advances to the second stage.    
NRG-GY016   71 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020 
Approximately eight months are expected to be required for the first stage of accrual, 
followed by approximately eight months of evaluation of objective tumor response to determine whether to open the second stage; if required, eight months are expected for accrual for the second stage, followed by eight months of evaluation for response.  If the 
study requires two stages, final analysis is expected in approximately three years. 
Dose Level Guidelines 
(Escalation or de-escalation): Mandatory for phase I or phase I/II trials 
Dose level guidelines are not applicable for this study. 
Secondary  (including correlative science aims) 
If there are secondary aims, they must be addressed in the Statistical 
Considerations section.  
Secondary Hypotheses and Endpoints: The expected level of detail for secondary 
hypotheses will be less than for the primary hypothesis and endpoint. The secondary endpoints of adverse events, progression-free survival and overall survival 
will be estimated as described in Section 13.7.2. 
Definitions of Secondary Endpoints and How These Will Be Analyzed CTCAE version 5 will be used to grade and categorize adverse events.  Descriptive 
statistics, including frequencies, of maximum grade of adverse events by term and 
category will be reported.  Adverse events categorized as Grade 5 will be individually reported.  Disease progression will be defined using RECIST v. 1.1 criteria.  Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from the start of study treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.  Overall survival (OS) is defined as the duration of time from the start of study treatment to time of death or the date of last contact.  The distributions of PFS and OS will be estimated and graphed using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method.  
Interim Analysis for All Other Endpoints (Goals): Include as applicable 
No interim analyses are planned for secondary endpoints. 
13.7.4 Power Calculations: power can be provided as applicable for selected secondary 
endpoints, if any. The power is based on the sample size for the primary endpoints. Power calculations are not needed for the secondary endpoints because only estimation, 
not testing, will be done for these endpoints. 
13.7.5 Expected Sample Size or Patient Cohorts :  
NRG -GY016    72 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020  
 
 Not applicable.  
 
13.7.6  Data and Safety Monitoring  
 
The Data Manager will work with the Study Statistician to keep the data up -to-date on a 
regular basis.   
 
Accrual and safety data on this protocol will be reviewed by the protocol monitoring 
team on a quarterly basis (eve ry three months) via conference call.  The protocol 
monitoring team will consist of the Study Chair, the Study Statistician, the Study Co -
Chairs, the Data Manager, and any others required.  The Study Statistician will assemble 
the necessary data and prepar e a report for review.  The report will include information 
related to patient accrual, basic patient and tumor characteristics, follow -up information, 
and adverse events and toxicities.  
 
The protocol monitoring team will consider information in the provid ed report and the 
recommendations of the Study Statistician.   After review of this information and any 
other information that may be relevant, the protocol monitoring team should reach a 
consensus on whether the accrual rate is sufficient to support comple tion of accrual, 
whether the rates of adverse events are low enough to be offset by the patient benefit 
hypothesized for intervention, and whether the number of events is sufficient to proceed 
to the next phase or sufficient to reach the definitive analysi s. 
 
Brief minutes of each meeting written by the Study Chair plus the Study Statistician’s 
report will be forwarded to the NRG Operations Office for archiving.  The NRG 
Operations Office will forward the meeting minutes and the report to the NRG Oncology 
Internal Early Phase Trial Oversight Committee for review at their regularly scheduled 
meetings.  
 
The Early Phase Trial Oversight Committee will review the study quarterly (every three 
months) with respect to patient accrual and morbidity.  Face -to-face mee tings will be held 
at the semiannual NRG Oncology group meetings and intervening quarterly meetings 
will be held by conference call.   Each quarterly report will be forwarded to the CIRB.  
 
The frequency and severity of all toxicities are tabulated from submitted case report 
forms and summarized for review by the Study Chairperson, Gynecologic Rare Tumor 
Committee, and NRG Safety Review Committee (SRG)  in conjunction with each semi -
annual mee ting (twice per year). For studies sponsored by CTEP of the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI), standardized toxicity reports are also submitted to the drug and disease 
monitors at the Investigational Drug Branch (IDB) and Clinical Investigation Branch 
(CIB).    
 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) are reported to the Study Chairperson, Sponsor, 
Pharmaceutical company, and regulatory agencies as mandated in the protocol.  SAE 
reports are reviewed by the Study Chairperson (or designated co -chairperson) 
NRG -GY016    73 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020  
immediately  for consideration of investigator notification of a suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reaction (SUSAR), protocol amendment, and/or immediate study 
suspension.  All participating institutions will receive notification of the SUSAR from 
NRG as well as th e reason study suspension, if applicable.  Upon suspension, accrual 
cannot be re -activated until review of the study by the SRG.  However, patients currently 
receiving treatment may continue to receive treatment in accordance with protocol 
guidelines at th e discretion of their physicians, unless otherwise directed.

APPENDIX V:   PATIENT DRUG INFOR MATION HANDOUT AND W ALLET 
CARD  
 
Information for Patients, Their Caregivers and Non -Study Healthcare Team on Possible 
Interactions with Other Drugs and Herbal Supplements  
 
 
The patient ____________________________ is enrolled on a clin ical trial using the 
experimental study drug epacadostat (INCB024360).  This clinical trial is sponsored by the 
National Cancer Institute.  This form is addressed to the patient, but includes important 
information for others who care for this patient.  
 
These are the things that you as a prescriber need to know:  
 
Epacadostat (INCB024360) interacts with certain specific enzymes in the liver and certain 
transport proteins that help move drugs in and out of cells.  
 
• The enzymes in question are CYP 3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and UGT1A9.  
Epacadostat (INCB024360) is metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and UGT1A9 and 
may be affected by other drugs that inhibit or induce these enzymes.   
• The proteins in question are OAT1 , OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, P -gp, and 
BCRP.  Epacadostat (INCB024360) is a substrate of P -gp and BCRP and may be affected by 
other drugs that inhibit or induce these transporters.  Epacadostat (INCB024360) is an inhibitor 
of OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and P -gp and may affect transport of other 
drugs in and out of cells.  
• Epacadostat (INCB024360) may cause an increase in serotonin levels when 
administered in combination with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.  Use of MAO 
inhibitors is prohibit ed. 
• Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and 
epacadostat (INCB024360).  Patients taking these medications should be monitored more 
frequently.  
 
To the patient: Take this paper with you to your medical appointments and k eep the attached 
information card in your wallet.   
 
Epacadostat (INCB024360) may interact with other drugs which can cause side effects.  For this 
reason, it is very important to tell your study doctors of any medicines you are taking before you 
enroll on to this clinical trial.  It is also very important to tell your doctors if you stop taking any 
regular medicines, or if you start taking a new medicine while you take part in this study.  When 
you talk about your current medications with your doctors, incl ude medicine you buy without a 
prescription (over -the-counter remedy), or herbal supplements such as St. John’s Wort.  It is 
helpful to bring your medication bottles or an updated medication list with you.  
 
Many health care providers can write prescription s.  You must tell all of your health care 
providers (doctors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or pharmacists) you are taking part 
in a clinical trial.  
NRG -GY016    86 NCI Version Date: June 11, 2020  
 
 
These are the things that you and they need to know:  
 
Epacadostat (INCB024360) must be use d very carefully with other medicines that need certain 
liver enzymes or transport proteins to be effective or to be cleared from your system.  Before you 
enroll onto the clinical trial, your study doctor will work with your regular health care providers 
to review any medicines and herbal supplements that are considered “strong inducers/inhibitors 
or substrates of CYP 3A4, 1A2, 2C19, UGT1A9, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, 
P-gp, and BCRP.  MAO inhibitors are prohibited.  Warfarin must be used with cauti on and 
closely monitored.”  
 
•  Please be very careful!  Over -the-counter drugs (including herbal 
supplements) may contain ingredients that could interact with your study drug.  Speak to your 
doctors or pharmacist to determine if there could be any side eff ects.  
• You may need to be monitored more frequently if you are taking warfarin with 
epacadostat (INCB024360).  
• Your regular health care provider should check a frequently updated medical 
reference or call your study doctor before prescribing any new med icine or discontinuing any 
medicine.  Your study doctor’s name is  
 
_____________________________________ and he or she can be contacted at

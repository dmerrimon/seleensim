SYNOPSIS
Study Title: A Phase II Clinical Study of BBI608 in Adult Patients with
Advanced Colorectal Cancer
Study Number: BBI608-224
Study Phase: Phase II
Study Drug BBI608, a novel investigational small molecule anticancer drug that targets
cancer stem cells.
Primary Objectives: To determine the safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of BBI608 when
administered in combination with Cetuximab, or Panitumumab, or
Capecitabine in adult patients with advanced colorectal cancer w ho have failed
first and second line treatment. 
The primary endpoint will be disease control rate, defined as t he proportion of
patients with a documented complete response, partial response a nd stable
disease (CR + PR + SD) based on RECIST. The secondary endpoints  w i l l
include progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS ).
Secondary
Objectives:To  determine  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of BBI608  and  Cetuximab , o r
Panitumumab, or Capecitabine when administered in combination. 
To determine the pharmacodynamics (biomarkers) of BBI608. 
To evaluate tolerability of two dosing regimens of BBI608 by co mparing 
administration of BBI608 at 240 mg twice daily starting dose an d escalating to 480 
mg twice daily after cycle 1 versus administration of BBI608 at  480 mg twice 
daily starting dose with dose adjustment permitted. 
To evaluate tolerability of BBI608 by comparing prophylactic ad ministration of 
anti-diarrheal medication versus as needed administration of an ti-diarrheal 
medication. The tolerability will be assessed using adverse eve nt profile and 
achieved dose intensity.

Study Design: This is an open label, multi-center, Phase II study of BBI608 adm inistered in
combination with either Cetuximab, or Panitumumab, or Capecitab ine. A
cycle will consist of daily and continuous oral administration of BBI608 for
four weeks in combination with either Cetuximab, or Panitumumab , or
Capecitabine.
Arm A (Cetuximab) - BBI608 is administered at 480 mg po twice daily
c o n t i n u o u s l y  a n d  C e t u x i m a b  w i l l  b e  a d m i n i s t e r e d I V  o n  d a y  5  a t 4 0 0 mg/m2
intravenous infusion over 120 minutes as  the initial dose, then w eekly at
250mg/m2over 60-minutes at subsequent cycles. 
Arm B (Panit umumab) - BBI608 is administered at 480 mg po twice daily
continuously and Panitumumab will be administered IV on day 8 an d 22 of
each 28 day cycle at 6 mg/kg over 60 minutes. 
Arm C (Capecitabine) - BBI608 is administered at 480 mg po twice daily
continuously and Capecitabine will be administered orally at 100 0 mg/m2bid
daily on days 8-21 every three weeks . 
6 pati ents will be initially enrolled in each combination arm at a dos e level of
480 mg twice daily (960 mg total daily dose) BBI608. If  1 ou t of  6 patien ts
have an observable DLT in the combination regimen, then that co mbination
arm may continue to accrue patients. If DLT occurs in  2 of the 6 patients in a
combination arm, then the combination arm will closed and no ne w patients
will be enrolled into this combination arm. A trial arm of BBI6 08 in
combination with Cetuximab, or Panitumumab, or Capecitabine wil l continue to 
enroll patients only if no more than 1 out of 6 patients for ea ch combination has
an observable DLT. It is expected that approximately 60 to 80 C RCpatients 
will be enrolled in the study.
Pharmac okinetics (PK) will be performed in the first cycle for the ini tial 6
patients of each combination arm of the study. 
Pharmacodynamic assessments will be performed in patients with accessible
tumors when tumor biopsy is possible.
Evaluation of anti-tumor activity of BBI608 in combination with  Cetuximab, or
Panitumumab or Capecitabine will be performed at about 8 week in tervals 
while patients remain on study. 
To evaluate the tolerability of BBI608, patients from each arm will be assigned to one 
of 4 sub-cohorts (with 6 patients in each sub-cohort IA, IB, II A, IIB). The evaluation of 
tolerability will be done at select centers for the study arm th at is continuing patient 
accrual and in which a total of 50 evaluable patients has not b een reached. For each 
combination arm, patients assigned to sub-cohorts IA and IB will receive BBI608 at 
240 mg po twice daily (480 mg total daily dose) starting on day  1 of cy cle 1. Intra-
patient dose escalation of BBI608 to 480 mg po twice daily (960  mg total daily dose) is 
allowed as tolerated. Patients assigned to sub-cohorts IIA and IIB will receive BBI608 
at 480 mg po twice daily (960 mg total daily dose) starting on day 1 of cycle 1. In case 
of toxicity, dose adjustment of BBI608 is permitted, as recomme nded in dose 
modification guidelines. Additionally, patients assigned to sub -cohorts IA and IIA will 
receive prophylactic anti-diarrheal treatment starting the day p rior to day 1 of cycle 1. 
Patients assigned to sub-cohorts IB and IIB will anti-diarrheal  treatment on an as 
needed basis starting with development of diarrhea above baseli ne. For each 
combination regimen, patients will be sequentially assigned to each of the 4 sub-
cohorts in the following order until 6 patients are accrued on each of the sub-cohorts: 
IA, IB, IIA, and IIB. If required, up to additional 20 patients m ay be assigned to 
selected sub-cohorts to validate the observations in initial 6 patients.

2In case of toxicity, dose adjustment of BBI608 is permitted.
Study Population: This study will enroll patients with advanced colorectal cancer.  Patients 
must have received at least 2 lines of standard chemotherapy based on  
regimens containing 5-FU, irinotecan or oxaliplatin. Patients to be 
enrolled into the Cetuximab or Panitumumab combination arms must 
have colorectal cancer with wild-type K-Ras. 
Patient accrual will occur over a period of time dependent upon  t h e  
enrollment rate of the study.
Test Product, Dose,
and Mode of
Administration:Patients in this trial will receive BBI608 orally at 480 mg twic e daily (960 mg
total daily dose). In each cycle BBI608 will be taken daily for  4  w e e k s  ( 2 8
days). BBI608 will be administered twice daily, approximately on e hour prior
to or two hours after meals with the first dose given in the mo rning and doses
separated by approximately 12 hours. 
For patients receiving Cetuximab, Cetuximab will be administered IV  on day 5
at 400 mg/m2intravenous infusion over 120 minutes as the initial dose, then
weekly at 250mg/m2over 60-minutes at subsequent cycles. 
For pati ents receiving Panitumumab, Panitumumab will be administered IV on
days 8 and 22 of each 28 day cycle at 6 mg/kg over 60 minutes. 
For patients receiving Capecitabine therapy, Capecitabine will be administered
orally at 1000 mg/m2bid daily on days 8-21 every three weeks.
Cycles will be repeated until progression of disease, unacceptabl e toxicity, or
another discontinuation criterion is met.
Duration of
Treatment:For an individual patient, treatment with BBI608 and the combin ation drug will
continue until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression (clin ical or
radiological) or another discontinuation criterion is met. It i s expected that
most patients will receive between one and four cycles of BBI60 8 for a
treatment period of 4 to 16 weeks.

Criteria for
Determination of
Dose-Limiting
Toxicity:A DLT is defined by the occurrence of any of the following toxi cities possibly
or probably related to BBI608, or BBI608 in combination with Ce tuximab, or
Panitumumab, or Capecitabine within 28 days of treatment: 
ƔCTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Grade 4
hematological toxicity. 
ƔGrade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicity, except Grade 3 or 4
nausea/vomiting/anorexia, diarrhea, or fatigue will be considere d a DLT only if
it persists more than three (3) days despite optimal medical ma nagement; and
alopecia will not be considered a DLT. 
ƔAny other toxicity that in the view of the Principal Investigat or represents a
clinically significant hazard to the patient.
Whether a DLT has occurred will be assessed during the first 28  d a y s  o f
BBI608 therapy. DLT will be determined from adverse events, cha nges from
baseline in physical examination findings and laboratory parame ters. The
incidence of adverse events and DLTs will be evaluated for each  combination
arm and for all patients. 
Adverse events considered related to Cetuximab, or Panitumumab or
Capecitabine will not be considered DLTs for BBI608 in combinat ion with
Cetuximab, or Panitumumab or Capecitabine.
Pharmacokineticand
Pharmacodynamic
Variables:Pharmacokinetic variables to be determined include maximum plas ma drug
concentration (Cmax), volume of distribution, area under the tim e-
concentration curve (AUC), distribution half-life, and terminal half-life. Blood
samples for PK determination will be drawn on Days 5-12 and Day s 26-33 for
the Cetuximab arm, on Days 8-15 and 22-29 for the Panitumumab a rm, and on
Days 8-9 and Days 21-22 for the Capecitabine arm during the firs t cycle for the
first 6 patients in each combination arm. Response (increase or  decrease) of
several biomarkers from biopsied tumors following BBI608 admini stration will
be examined in patients with accessible tumors for biopsy. Tumo r biopsies
will be collected prior to the first dose of BBI608 and on day 8 of the first cycle
for patients with accessible tumors and who have signed the opt ional tumor
biopsy consent.

Clinical Protocol BBI608-224
Statistical Methods:In general, categorical variables will be summarized as the number and
percentage of patients in each category. Continuous variables wi ll be
summarized by the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and
maximum.
The primary populati on for the efficacy evaluation will be the evaluable
population, defined as patients who have been treated with at le ast 80% of 1
complete cycle of BBI608 and a combination drug. The primary en dpoint will
be disease control rate, defined as the proportion of patients with a documented
complete response, partial response and stable disease (CR + PR + SD) based
on RECIST. The secondary endpoints will include progression-fre e survival
(PFS) and overall survival (OS). PFS will be calculated from th e date of
patient enrolment into the trial until documented disease progr ession based on
RECIST. OS will be calculated from the date of patient enrolmen t into the
trial until death. 
Patient sample size for each combination regimen is calculated based on a
power of 80 and a one-sided alpha of 5% to detect a disease con trol rate
improvement for Cetuximab and Panitumumab from about 30% (histo rical
DCR for 3rdand 4thline colorectal cancer) to 60% and for Capecitabine from
about 15% (historical DCR for 3rdline colorectal cancer) to 60%.
Safety analyses will include adverse events, SAEs, laboratory t ests, and
physical examination changes from baseline. The safety populati on will
include all patients who have received any amount of BBI608 and  t h e
combination drug. All patients receiving at least one daily dose o f BBI608 will
be considered evaluable for safety analyses. In addition to the  ev alu ation an d
categorization of adverse events, listings of laboratory test r esults collected at
baseline and during the study will be generated. Descriptive st atistics
summarizing the changes in those laboratory tests over time wil l be presented. 
Analysis and Sample size for sub-cohorts:
Each sub-cohort will be analyzed for number of days of Grade II /III diarrhea and 
% treatment compliance achieved during the first two cycles. Th e % treatment 
compliance will be calculated as the number of capsules actuall y ingested over 
the number of capsules that should have been ingested per dose level multiplied 
by 100. The research questions addressed by sub-cohorts are hyp othesis-
generating and exploratory in nature. Initially 6 subjects will  be assigned to each 
s u b - c o h o r t  t o  a s s e s s  t h e  e f f e c t  o f  i n t e r v e n t i o n .  S e l e c t e d  s u b - cohorts will be 
extended to enroll up additional 20 patients. The decision of ex tending the 
enrollment will be based on clinical assessment without formal statistical 
testing. However, 20 patients will give 80% power to detect 20%  difference in 
% treatment compliance between two arms and 57% power to detect  t h e  
difference of 25% in the number of days of having Grade II/III d iarrhea using 
two-sided Z test with pooled variance at type I error rate of 0 .15. The control 
rates assumed are 70% for treatment compliance and 30% for diar rhea. The 
patients will be sequentially allocated to different sub-cohort s by the Sponsor 
to avoid section bias.

1 PRECLINICAL SUMMARY AND STUDY RATIONALE
1.1 Scientific Background of BBI608
Recent studies have uncovered the presence of cancer stem cells ( CSC, also called tumor initiating 
cells or cancer stem-like cells) which have self-renewal capabil ity and are considered to be 
fundamentally responsible for malignant growth, relapse and met astasis. Importantly, CSCs are
inherently resistant to conventional therapies. Therefore, a ta rgeted agent with activity against cancer
stem cells holds a great promise for cancer patients (Lobo, Shimo no et al. 2007 1; Boman and Wicha, 
2008 2; Please find a list of updated reviews on cancer stem cells in al l major cancer types in the
special issue of Journal of Clinical Oncology on cancer stem cells (J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jun
10;26(17)).3
BBI608 is the most advanced product candidate selected from our BBI6 000 program designed by 
Boston Biomedical, Inc. (BBI) to target cancer stem cells. BBI608  is a small molecule that targets
cancer by blocking self-renewal of and inducing apoptosis in ca ncer stem cells. While not a kinase 
inhibitor, BBI608 works by inhibiting the CSCP3 pathway.
With our proprietary target discovery technology TPIV®, scientists at Boston Biomedical, Inc. have
discovered that the CSCP3 pathway activity is critical for self- renewal and survival of cancer stem 
cells in human cancer. B locking the CSCP3 pathway offers a novel and potentially highly
effective strategy to target cancer stem cells as well as the bu lk of the heterogeneous cancer
cells, while sparing normal ce lls and normal adult stem cells
1.2 Preclinical Efficacy
Cancer stem cells are intrinsically resistant (more than 5 to 10  fold) to chemotherapeutic drugs. 
BBI608 has potent activity (~100 to 500 nM) against cancer stem c ells in vitro and in vivo while
sparing normal hematopoietic stem cells (IC 50not reached at 30 μM), offering a wide therapeutic
window. The dependence on CSCP3 is conserved in various non-stem ca ncer cells. BBI608 has 
demonstrated in vitro efficacy in a broad spectrum of human cancer cell lines derived f rom both solid
tumors and hematologic malignancies (IC 50~100 nM to 500 nM).
BBI608 monotherapy has demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in vivo in multiple murine
xenograft models of human cancer, including liver, head and neck , breast, prostate, colon, gastric and
pancreatic cancers, in the absence of adverse effects. BBI608 mon otherapy has demonstrated anti- 
metastatic activity using an in vivo spontaneous metastasis mouse models. These data suggest broad
potential of BBI608 for a wide variety of human cancers.
1.3 GLP Toxicology
GLP 28-day repeat dose toxicology studies were performed in both rats and dogs at doses of 10, 30 
and 100 mg/kg/day by oral gavage.
In the rat study, 100 mg/kg was not tolerated by the male rats. Toxic observations include significant
weight loss, soft feces and diarrhea, and decreased food consumptio n, which led to early sacrifice. 
These observations recovered in the remaining male rats within 1 4 days after termination of dosing. 
Female rats receiving 100 mg/kg/day showed weight loss during t he first week of dosing, however 
weight gain recovered during the continued dosing phase without  significant abnormal clinical
observations.

Clinical Protocol BBI608-224
In the rat study, abnormal laboratory findings (azotemia, hypon atremia, hypochloremia, 
hyperkalemia, polycythemia, neutrophilia, monocytosis, and lymp hopenia) were observed primarily
in moribund male rats dosed at 100 mg/kg. These findings are con sistent with acute renal failure in
the setting of dehydration and diarrhea. In rats dosed at 100 mg/ kg for 28 days, there was mild
decrease in sodium, chloride and albumin levels and mild elevat ion of white blood cells, red blood 
cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes. No significan t abnormal laboratory findings in 
recovery rats, suggesting these abnormal laboratory findings ar e reversible. There were no abnormal 
laboratory findings in rats dosed at 10 and 30 mg/kg. 
In the rat study, histopathological findings were noted in the rats dosed at 100 mg/kg, primarily in
mordibund male rats, including microscopic changes in the stoma c h  a n d  u r i n a r y  b l a d d e r  ( f o c a l  o r
multifocal chronic ulceration, epithelial hyperplasia, chronic act ive inflammation or hemorrhagic
changes), in lymphoid tissues (mild to marked lymphoid atrophy with mild to moderate lymphocyte
apoptosis in thymus; mild to moderate lymphoid atrophy and mild  to moderate mastocytosis in 
mesenteric lymph nodes; mild to moderate lymphoid atrophy in 2 moribund male rats of the 100 
mg/kg group and some elevation of hemosiderosis in the spleen) and in adrenal glands (mild cortical 
vacuolation). These findings are considered non-specific changes related to the test vehicle in the
setting of dehydration and diarrhea. There were no significant h istopathological findings in recovery 
rats, suggesting these histopathological changes are reversible.  There was no significant test vehicle
related microscopic changes in rats dosed at 30 mg/kg and 10 mg/ kg. 
In the rat study, toxicokinetics showed that all dose groups in  rats achieved BBI608 exposure well
above the predicted exposure levels needed for efficacy with expo sure lasting beyond 10 hours.
For the dog study, toxicity was observed in dogs receiving 100 m g/kg/day consisting of mild weight 
loss, as well as clinical observations including emesis, diarrhea,  mucoid and soft feces. These adverse
effects were reversible within 14 days in the setting of continue d dosing. No treatment related
clinical pathology, gross pathology or histopathological effect s were observed at any dose level. All
dose groups achieved plasma levels of BBI608 above the predicted  levels needed for efficacy, with
exposure lasting beyond 10 hours. 
The no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL, based on clinica l observation, laboratory tests, gross
and histopathological changes) for rats administered BBI608 dai ly orally over 28 days was 30
mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose: 180 mg/m2) and the NOAEL in dogs administered BBI608 daily
orally over 28 days was 30 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose: 600 mg/m2).
1.4 Safety and Encouraging Signs of Antitumor Activity in Phase I
A phase 1 dose escalation study (BBI608-101) in adult patients w ith advanced cancer was initiated to
determine the safety, tolerability, recommended phase 2 dose (RP 2D), pharmacokinetics and 
preliminary anti-tumor activity of BBI608. A modified Simon accele rated titration scheme was used
for dose escalation, with a cycle consisting of twice-daily oral administration of BBI608 for 4 weeks, 
and was repeated every 4 weeks (28 days) until progression of di sease, unacceptable toxicity, or other
discontinuation criteria were met. 
The dose of BBI608 has been escalated from 20 mg to 2000 mg/day, and a MTD was not reached. 
Further dose escalation is limited by pill burden. Adverse even ts have been generally mild; the most 
common being grade 1-2 diarrhea and nausea. Grade 3 events inclu ded fatigue and transient diarrhea. 
BBI608 has exhibited favorable pharmacokinetics. The plasma conc entration of BBI608 reached 
several folds above the IC 50. Prolonged stable disease beyond 12 weeks was observed in abou t 60%
of evaluable patients, including patients with colon cancer, hea d and neck cancer, gastric cancer, 
ovarian cancer and breast cancer.  Complete regression of a meta static lesion to the kidney was also

Clinical Protocol BBI608-224
observed in one colon cancer patient.   Decrease in tumor marke rs (CEA and CA125) have been 
observed in colon cancer and ovarian cancer.
BBI608 has shown exciting signs of activity in colorectal cance r (CRC) patients in the phase I study 
where 22 CRC patients with k-Ras mutant or wild-type tumors have  been enrolled. These patients
were all end-stage patients who had failed standard treatments for CRC including FOLFOX, 
FOLFIRI, Avastin, EGFR therapy (if k-Ras wild-type) and experime ntal drugs.  Thirteen (13)
patients were evaluable with 8 (62%) showing SD or MR (27.6% regre ssion) yielding a disease 
control rate (DCR=CR+PR+SD) of 62% compared to the historical con trol of about 10% for similar 
CRC patients on best supportive care. Progression free survival  (PFS) was 13 weeks compared to the
historical control of 7.7 weeks (hazard ratio = 0.382; 95% CI, 0 .159 to 0.918; p=0.015) in CRC
patients on best supportive care.4,6
In addition, a phase Ib/II trial of BBI608 in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced
malignancies carried out under IND 100,887 has shown that BBI608  given at 500 mg bid (1000 mg
total daily dose) in combination with weekly paclitaxel is well tolerated.
In  summary,  BBI608  has  shown an excellent  safety  profile, fa vorable  pharmacokinetics,  and 
encouraging signs of antitumor activity. 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES
2.1 Primary Objectives
The primary objectives of the study are: 
• To assess the safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of BBI60 8 in adult patients with
advanced colorectal cancer who have failed first and second line treatment, when BBI608 is
administered in combination with Cetuximab, or Panitumumab, or Ca pecitabine. The
primary endpoint will be disease control rate, defined as the pr oportion of patients with a
documented complete response, partial response and stable diseas e (CR + PR + SD) based on 
RECIST. The secondary endpoints will include progression-free s urvival (PFS) and overall
survival (OS).  
2.2 Secondary Objectives
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
• To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of BBI608 and Cetuxima b, or Panitumumab, or 
Capecitabine when administered in combination.
• To determine the pharmacodynamics (biomarkers) of BBI608. 
• To evaluate tolerability of two dosing regimens of BBI608 by co mparing administration of 
BBI608 at 240 mg twice daily starting dose and escalating to 48 0 mg twice daily after cycle 1 
versus administration of BBI608 at 480 mg twice daily starting dose with dose adjustment 
permitted. 
• To evaluate tolerability of BBI608 by comparing prophylactic ad ministration of anti-diarrheal
medication versus as needed administration of anti-diarrheal me dication. The tolerability will be 
assessed using adverse event profile and achieved dose intensit y.

4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
4.1 Overall Study Design
This is an open-label, multicenter Phase II study of oral BBI608 administered with Cetuximab, or 
Panitumumab, or Capecitabine to patients with advanced metastat ic colorectal cancer. The study is
based on a Simon 2-stage design that will examine the safety, to lerability and pharmacokinetics of
BBI608 and Cetuximab, or Panitumumab, or Capecitabine, and asses s the preliminary anti-tumor 
activity of BBI608 when administered in combination with Cetuximab , or Panitumumab, or 
Capecitabine in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.
BBI608 treatment will be at a dose level of 480 mg twice daily ( 960 mg total daily dose). In each 
cycle, BBI608 will be taken daily continuously for 4 weeks (28 da ys). BBI608 will be administered 
twice daily approximately one hour prior to or two hours after meals with the first dose given in the 
morning and approximately 12 hours between doses.
For patients receiving Cetuximab therapy, Cetuximab will be adm inistered IV on day 5 of cycle 1 at
400 mg/m2intravenous infusion over 120 minutes as the initial dose, then  weekly at 250mg/m2 over 
60-minutes at subsequent cycles.
For patients receiving Panitumumab therapy, Panitumumab will be  administered IV on day 8, and 22 
of each 28 day cycle at 6 mg/kg over 60 minutes.
For patients receiving Capecitabine therapy, Capecitabine will be administered orally at 1000 mg/m2
bid daily on days 8-21 every three weeks.
Cycles will be repeated until progression of disease, unacceptab le toxicity, or another discontinuation
criterion is met. In the case of toxicity, adjustment is permit ted. If administration of Cetuximab, or 
Panitumumab, or Capecitabine is discontinued due to Cetuximab, o r Panitumumab, or Capecitabine- 
related toxicity, administration of BBI608 will be continued un til disease progression if tolerated.
Initially, 6 patients will be enrolled in each combination arm at  a dose level of 480 mg twice daily 
(960 mg total daily dose) BBI608. If  1 out of 6 patients has an observable DLT  in  the combination
regimen, then that arm of the study will continue to enroll pati ents at 480 mg po twice daily (960 
mg total daily dose) of BBI608 following the Simon 2-stage desig n (see Table 1 ). If

additional patients will be enrolled into the stage 2 cohort. 
To evaluate the tolerability of BBI608, patients from each arm w i l l  b e  a s s i g n e d  t o  o n e  o f  4  s u b -
cohorts (with 6 patients in each sub-cohort IA, IB, IIA, IIB). The evaluation of tolerability will be 
done at select centers for the study arm that is continuing pat ient accrual and in which a total of 50 
evaluable patients has not been reached. For each combination a rm, patients assigned to sub-cohorts 
IA and IB will receive BBI608 at 240 mg po twice daily (480 mg total daily dose) starting on day 1 of 
cycle 1. Intra-patient dose escalation of BBI608 to 480 mg po t wice daily (960 mg total daily dose) is 
allowed as tolerated. Patients assigned to sub-cohorts IIA and IIB will receive BBI608 at 480 mg po 
twice daily (960 mg total daily dose) starting on day 1 of cycl e 1. In case of toxicity, dose adjustment 
of BBI608 is permitted, as recommended in dose modification gui delines. Additionally, patients 
assigned to sub-cohorts IA and IIA will receive prophylactic an ti-diarrheal treatment starting the day 
prior to day 1 of cycle 1. Patients assigned to sub-cohorts IB and IIB will anti-diarrheal treatment on 
an as needed basis starting with development of diarrhea above baseline. For each combination 
regimen, patients will be sequentially assigned to each of the 4 sub-cohorts in the following order 
until 6 patients are accrued on each of the sub-cohorts: IA, IB,  IIA, and IIB. If required, up to 
additional 20 patients may be assigned to selected sub-cohorts to validate the observations in initial 6 
patients.

4.2 Rationale for Study Design
Considerable data has been collected from the Phase I monothera py study of BBI608 (Protocol 
BBI608-101) conducted in advanced oncol ogy patients who have failed mu ltiple previous regimens. 
Dose escalation for BBI608 has been successfully conducted from  a total daily dose of 20 mg to 2000 
mg total daily dose. Further dose escalation is limited by pill  burden. A MTD was not reached. In 
addition, a phase Ib/II trial of BBI608 in combination with pac litaxel in patients with advanced
malignancies carried out under IND 100,887 has shown that BBI608 given at 500 mg bid (1000  mg 
total daily dose) in combination with weekly paclitaxel is well tolera ted.
Combination of cancer stem cell therapeutics with chemotherapy or a targeted agent would allow 
simultaneous inhibition of cancer stem cells as well as non-stem reg ular cancer cells.
Based on the activity seen in colorectal cancer patients in the p hase I monotherapy trial, and the
excellent safety profile of BBI608, combination of BBI608 with Cetuximab, or Panitumumab or 
Capecitabine provides a good option for these patients.
4.3 Selection of Dose
Confidential Page: 21October 9th,2 0 1 4
Amendment #2 Boston Biomedical, Inc
Clinical Protocol BBI608-224
The dose escalation of BBI608 in the BBI608-101 Phase I study h a s r e a c h e d  a  t o t a l  d a i l y  d o s e o f  
2000 mg without dose-limiting toxicity. No MTD was reached and further dose escalation above 
2000 mg total daily dose was limited by pill burden . Adverse events observed in the BBI608-101
phase I trial have been generally mild with the most common bein g: diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue. 
Grade 3 events include: fatigue or transient diarrhea. No bone marrow suppression or neuropathy 
was observed.
In the BBI608-224 study, administration of BBI608 will be begin  at a dose of 480 mg twice daily 
with a total daily dose of 960 mg, in combination with Cetuxima b, or Panitumumab, or Capecitabine
with exception of patients enrolled into the IA and IB combinat ion arm sub-cohorts, for whom 
administration of BBI608 will begin at a dose of 240 mg twice d aily with a total daily dose of 480 mg 
in cycle 1. Intra-patient dose escalation of BBI608 to 480 mg p o twice daily (960 mg total daily dose) 
is allowed as tolerated..
4.4 Risk Benefit Assessment
Cancer stem cell inhibitors offer an exciting approach to the tre atment of advanced malignancies. 
Preclinical studies of BBI608 indicate that the drug is active ag ainst a wide range of solid tumors. 
Encouraging signs of antitumor activity have been observed in th e BBI608-101 phase I trial. 
Combination of cancer stem cell therapeutics with chemotherapy o r targeted agents would allow 
enhanced simultaneous inhibition of cancer stem cells as well as  non-stem regular cancer cells.
BBI608 has been well tolerated in phase I trials. A MTD was not  reached in the BBI608-101 Phase I
study with doses escalated from 20 mg up to 1000 mg bid (2 000 mg total daily dose). Further dose
escalation above 2000 mg/day was limited by pill burden. 
Adverse events observed in the BBI608-101 phase I trial have been generally mild with the most 
common being: diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue. Grade 3 events inc lude: fatigue or transient diarrhea. 
There is no clinically significant overlap between adverse event s observed for BBI608 and the 
adverse effects of Cetuximab, Panitumumab, or Capecitabine.
The sponsor believes that the proposed study is acceptable in th e context of its risks and benefits.

4.5 Dose-Limiting Toxicity
Dose-limiting toxicity is defined by the occurrence of any of th e following toxicities possibly or 
probably related to BBI608 in combination with Cetuximab, or Pa nitumumab or Capecitabine within 
28 days of treatment. DLT will be scored during the 28 days of BB I608 treatment. 
• Grade 4 hematological toxicity
• Grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicity, except: 
oGrade 3 or 4 nausea/vomiting/anorexia, diarrhea and fatigue wil l be considered a
DLT only if it persists more than three (3) days despite optimal m edical management 
oAlop ecia will not be considered a DLT 
Adverse events considered related to Cetuximab, or Panitumumab or  C a p e c i t a b i n e  w i l l  n o t  b e
considered DLTs.
4.6 Study Duration
Patients will receive treatment with BBI608 and Cetuximab, or P anitumumab, or Capecitabine until 
progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity or another of the discontinuation criteria is documented 
(see Section 5.6). It is expected that most patients will receiv e between one and four cycles of
BBI608 and Cetuximab, or Panitumumab, or Capecitabine for a treat ment period of 4 to 16 weeks.
5 STUDY VISITS
Study Visits will consist of a Pre-Study Evaluation, during which the patient is evaluated to determine 
suitability for entry into the study, Cycle 1 Evaluations which w ill be performed on Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 
4 of the first cycle only for Cetuximab, on Weeks 2 and 4 the fir st cycle only for Panitumumab, and 
on Weeks 2 and 3 the first cycle only for Capecitabine, evaluat ions in Cycle 2 and beyond, which will 
be performed in Week 1 or 2 of each cycle, and an End-of-Study Ev aluation. (See Section 14 for a
schedule of Assessments) 
Following the Pre-Study Evaluation and a determination by a Pri ncipal Investigator that the patient
meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria and signs the informed co nsent, the patient will be considered 
entered into the study. 
5.1 Informed Consent
Patients who agree to participate will sign the approved informed c onsent and will be provided a copy 
of the signed document. 
5.2 Pre-Study Evaluations (Baseline) (1 week ±3 days prior to the first dose of BBI608*)

Capecitabine should be taken about 3 hours after the first dail y dose of BBI608 on day 8 of 
each 3 week cycle of Capecitabine.
7.1.4 Diarrhea Management
For each combination arm, treatment for BBI608-related diarrhea  will be instituted on a prophylactic or 
on an as needed basis depending on sub-cohort assignment.
Patients assigned to sub-cohorts IA and IIA will receive prophy lactic anti-diarrheal medication starting 
the day prior to day 1 of cycle 1. With development of intolerab le grade 2 diarrhea or greater, 
prophylactic anti-diarrheal regiment may be adjusted as needed. Patients assigned to sub-cohorts IB and 
IIB will receive anti-diarrheal medication on an as needed basi s starting with development of BBI608-
related intolerable grade 2 or above diarrhea. Patients in all 4 sub-cohorts who develop sub-optimal 
diarrhea control while on protocol therapy will have adjustment  of their anti-diarrheal regiment as 
needed. 
The following treatments are suggested for diarrhea and accompa nying abdominal cramping 
management:
Diarrhea & Abdominal Cramping Management  
Diphenoxylate/atropine (Lomotil) 5 mg QID until control (max 20 mg/day); then maintain at 5 mg BI D
Loperamide (Imodium/Gastrostop) 4mg followed by 2 mg Q 4 hours or after each unformed stool (ma x 16 
mg/day); then maintain at 2-4 mg BID
Systemic opioids (e.g. hydromorphone [Dilaudid], codeine) have been found effective in reducing abdominal pain 
and diarrhea
Hyoscine butyl (Buscopan), or hyoscyamine (Levsin) can also be used for abdominal cramps
7.1.5 Body Surface Area Calculation
The calculation of the dose of Cetuximab or Panitumumab will be based on the patient’s body surface 
area (BSA). The BSA will be calculated before each cycle, based on the actual height and weight of 
the patient. The calculated dose will be adjusted downward to the  nearest whole milligram.

recommended. Dose modification may include reduction of the tota l daily dose and/or in the number 
of doses taken per day. Investigators should discuss dose modif ications with the medical monitor for 
the sponsor.  Patients may up-titrate dose to full dose as tolera ted. 
If a toxicity is thought by the Investigator to be related to b oth BBI608 and the combination drug 
(Cetuximab, Panitumumab or Capecitabine), then the dose modifica tion rules for both agents should
be followed.
7.3 Treatment Compliance
A patient is considered compliant with the study protocol when study medication is administered at a
compliance level of greater than 80%.
BBI608 compliance will be calculated using the following equati on: 
(Number of capsules actually ingested /number of capsules that sho uld have been ingested per dose
level) x 100= % compliance 
Capecitabine compliance will be calculated using the following e quation: 
(Number of capsules actually ingested /number of capsules that sho uld have been ingested per dose
level) x 100= % compliance 
Cetuximab or Panitumumab compliance will be calculated using the following equation:
(Number of treatments performed /number of treatments that should have been performed per dose
level) x 100= % compliance 
7.4 Blinding
This is an open label study.  Neither the patient nor the inves tigator and site staff will be blinded to
the treatment administered.
7.5 Prior Treatment
Reasonable efforts will be made to determine all relevant prior  treatments received by the patient
within four weeks of the first BBI608 dose. All relevant informa tion must be recorded on the
appropriate patient's case report form (CRF). All surgical proc edure history, prior chemotherapy and 
radiation therapy must be recorded on the appropriate CRF.
7.6 Concomitant Medication
7.6.1    Permitted Treatment 
All information regarding concomitant treatments (medications or  procedures) must be recorded on 
the patient’s CRF (including the name of the medication or proced ure and duration of treatment).
Palliative and supportive care for di sease-related symptoms will  be offered to all patients in 
this study.  Patients may recei ve palliative radiation therapy.

BBI608 was shown in vitro to inhibit individual CYP P450 isoforms 1A2, 2D6, 2C19, 3A4, an d 2C9
with IC 50’s of 0.25 μM, 0.25 μM, 2.5 μM, 5 μM, and 0.5 μM respectively. Since in vitro , BBI608 
has shown the ability to inhibit these CYP P450 isoforms, concomi tant use of agents that are
substrates of these CYP P450 enzymes should be avoided unless deeme d medically necessary by the 
primary investigator. Examples of commonly prescribed agents that  a r e  m e t a b o l i z e d  b y  t h e s e C Y P
P450 enzymes are: 
NSAIDS: such as ibuprofen, naproxen
Proton pump inhibitors: such as lansoprazole, omeprazole
Oral hypoglycemic medications: sulfonylureas
Beta-b lockers: metoprolol, carvedilol
Calcium channel blockers: amlodipine, diltiazem, nefedipine, ve rapamil
Antidepressants: paroxetine, imipramine, amitriptyline 
Anti-epileptics: such as phenytoin, phenobarbitone Anti-
psychotics: such as haloperidol, risperidone 
Antibiotics: such as clarithromycin, erythromycin 
HMG CoA reductase inhibitor: atorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastat in
Anesthetics: such as halothane, enflurane;
HIV antivirals: such as saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir
Immunomodulators (immunosuppressives): such as cyclosporine, ta crolimus 
Steroids: such as hydrocortisone, estrodiol
BBI608 is metabolized by the CYP P450 isoform 1A2. Therefore, c oncomitant use of drugs which
inhibit CYP1A2 should be avoided unless deemed medically necess ary by the primary investigator. 
Known drugs that inhibit CYP 1A2 include ciprofloxacin and othe r fluoroquinolones, Fluvoxamine
Verapamil, amiodarone, interferon, methoxsalen, enoxacin, mexiletin e, and ticlopidine

the first dose of BBI608 and including the protocol-defined post -treatment follow-up period (21 Code
of Federal Regulations [CFR] §312.64[b]) on designated CRF pages. AEs occurring following the 
signature of the informed consent, but prior to the first dose of  study drug will not be reported as AEs. 
It is also important to record all AEs that result in permanent  discontinuation of the investigational 
product being studied, whether serious or non-serious.
Serious adverse events (SAEs), as defined below, must be report ed to Boston Biomedical Inc. or its
representative within 24 hours of knowledge of their occurrence.
8.1.2 Definitions
An AE is defined as any untoward m edical occurrence in a patien t or clinical investigational patient
administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily  have to have a causal relationship
with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease te mporally associated with the use of
a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medici nal product. 
Laboratory data are to be collected as stipulated in this protoco l, and toxicity trends will be analyzed 
utilizing objective toxicity criteria. Clinical syndromes associ ated with laboratory abnormalities are
to be recorded as appropriate (e.g., diabetes mellitus instead of hyperglycemia).
Progression of disease is considered an efficacy outcome paramete r and should not be captured as an
AE. A non-serious AE is any untoward medical occurrence that do es not meet any of the criteria for 
SAEs as defined below. 
Patients should be instructed to report any AE that they experi ence to the investigator. Investigators
should assess the patient for AEs at each visit. AEs occurring during the clinical trial and the follow- 
up pe r io d s ho u ld be  re co rd e d o n the  ap pro p ri at e  A E  CRF . To  c ap tu r e the most potentially relevant 
safety information during a clinical trial, it is important tha t investigators record accurate AE terms on 
CRFs.
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than i ndividual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by the investigator and recorded on the CRF. However, if an observed 
or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a s pecific disease or syndrome by the 
investigator, it should be recorded as a separate AE on the CRF.

8.2 Serious Adverse Events
8.2.1 Definitions
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse experience occurrin g at any dose that results in any of
the following outcomes:
• Death 
• A life-threatening adverse drug experience
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitaliz ation , except for events that are 
clearly disease related
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect
Important medical events may be considered an SAE based upon appr opriate medical judgment. 
Under this protocol, scheduled hospitalizations or elective surg ical procedures will not be considered 
SAEs.  Prolongation of a scheduled hospitalization can be considered an SAE. Complications
associated with scheduled procedures are considered an AE.
8.2.2    Reporting Serious  Adverse Events 
Any SAE, including death, due to any cause that occurs during t his investigation, whether or not
related to the administration of study drug, must be reported to  the Sponsor immediately (not to
exceed 24 hours) by telephone or facsimile. The reaction must be completely described on the CRF
and SAE report form.

9   ASSESSMENT OF ANTI-TUMOR ACTIVITY IN SOLID TUMORS
The following definitions and criteria (from Response Evaluatio n Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST
1.1, Eisenhauer et al. 2009] 19) should be used for the baseline evaluations of existing disea se, and for
the ongoing evaluation of tumor responses.
Measurable disease - the presence of at least one measurable lesion.
Measurable lesions - lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimen sion with longest 
diameter 10 mm using conventional techniques or 10 mm with spiral CT scan. Malignant lymph 
nodes must be 15 mm in the shortest diameter.Matthew Hitw ron,tt MD,

Clinical Protocol BBI608-224
Non-measurable lesions - all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm with
conventional techniques, <10 mm with spiral CT scan or 10 mm to <15 mm in short axis), i.e., bone
lesions, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, cystic lesions and also abdominal masses that are not
confirmed and followed by imaging techniques.
• All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notatio n, using  a ru ler o r
calipers.
• The same method of assessment and the same technique should be us ed to
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and d uring follow-up. 
• Lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superfi cial (e.g., skin
nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions , documentation by 
color photography, and a measurement with a ruler to estimate t he size of the lesion, 
is recommended.
9.1 Methods of Measurement
• CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible met hods to measure 
target lesions selected for response assessment. Conventional C T and MRI should be 
performed with cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness contigu ously. Spiral CT
should be performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algo rithm. 
• All imaging methods should be performed according to institutio nal standards with
each patient having consistency of methods beginning from baselin e through the
course of the study. 
9.2 Baseline Documentation of “Tar get” and “Non-Target” Lesions
• All m easurable lesions up to a m axim um of five lesions total wi th a m axim um of 2 
lesions per organ, representative of all involved organs should be  identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.
• Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (le sions with the longest 
diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measuremen ts (either by imaging
techniques or clinical assessments).
• A  s u m  o f  t h e  l o n g e s t  d i a m e t e r  ( L D )  f o r  all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be us ed as the reference 
by which to characterize the objective tumor response.
• All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesi ons are not required, 
but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout fo llow-up.

9.3 Response Criteria
Evaluation of target lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions 
Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in shortaxis of <10mm
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recordedsince the treatment started. In addition to the increase of
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of
at least 5mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions isalso considered progression
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for  PR nor sufficient
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallestsum LD since the treatment started
Evaluation of non-target lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and norm alization of
tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-
pathological in size (<10mm short axis)
Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) an d/or
maintenance of tumor marker level above normal limits
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or une quivocal
progression of existing non-target lesions
9.4 Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from th e start of the treatment until disease
progression/recurrence and is determined as indicated in the ta ble below:

Patients who have received at least one cycle of study treatmen t and have had at least one disease 
assessment following the initiation of therapy will be considered  e v a l u a b l e  f o r  d i s e a s e  c o n t r o l  r a t e
and overall response. Progression-free survival and overall surv ival will be evaluated in the intent-to- 
treat population. Anti-tumor activity will be evaluated on an exp loratory basis and will be
summarized using descriptive statistics or graphics.
10.4 Efficacy
The primary population for the efficacy evaluation will be the evaluable population, defined as
patients who have been treated with at least 80 % of 1 complete  cycle of BBI608 and a combination 
drug. The primary efficacy outcome measure will be disease control  rate, defined as the proportion of
patients with a documented complete response, partial response a nd stable disease (CR + PR + SD)
based on RECIST. In addition, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) will be 
obtained from intent-to-treat patients. PFS w ill be calculated fr om the date of patient enrolment into
the trial until documented disease progression based on RECIST. O S will be calculated from the date
of patient enrolment into the trial until death. 
10.5 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Patient characteristics will include a complete summary of the fol lowing and will be recorded in the 
CRFs:
• Patient demographics
• Baseline disease characteristics 
• Pre-existing conditions
• Prior therapies
• Concomitant medications and treatments 
Other patient characteristics will be summarized as appropriate 
10.6 Statistical Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Variables
Pharmacokinetics will only be performed on the first 6 patients enrolled in each combination arm of 
this study. 
Timed blood sample collection for BBI608 and Cetuximab pharmacokin etic analysis will be
performed on Days 5-11 and 26-32 after the first dose of Cycle 1 for the first 6 patients enrolled in the
Cetuximab arm. Timed blood sample collection for BBI608 and Panit umumab pharmacokinetic
analysis will be performed on Days 8-14 and 22-28 after the firs t  d o s e o f  C y c l e  1  f o r  t h e  f i r s t  6
patients enrolled in the Panitumumab arm. Timed blood sample coll ection for BBI608 and 
Capecitabine pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed on Days 8-9 and 21-22 after the first dose 
of Cycle 1 for the first 6 patients enrolled in the Capecitabine arm. 
Bioanalytical analysis of patient samples will be conducted at a centralized laboratory using GLP- 
validated assays. Plasma concentrations will be summarized by de scriptive statistics, including mean, 
standard deviation, coefficient of variation, minimum, maximum, and median .
Concentration profiles will be analyzed by noncompartmental and/ or nonlinear least squares
regression using WinNonLin. Pharmacokinetic parameters, includi ng C ma x, volume of distribution, 
distribution half-life, terminal half-life, and AUC will be eva luated.

10.7 Safety Analysis
Safety will be assessed by physical examination, and laboratory assessments. Adverse events will be 
graded according to the NCI CTCAE, version 4.0. The incidence o f adverse events and DLTs will be
evaluated for each combination arm, and for all patients combined . Patients will be followed for
adverse events for at least 30 days after the last dose of BBI60 8, or until recovered from all related
BBI608 adverse events.
10.8 Analysis and Sample size for sub-cohorts
E a c h  s u b - c o h o r t  w i l l  b e  a n a l y z e d  f o r  n u m b e r  o f  d a y s  o f  G r a d e  I I /III diarrhea and % treatment 
compliance achieved during the first two cycles. The % treatmen t compliance will be calculated as 
the number of capsules actually ingested over the number of cap sules that should have been ingested 
per dose level multiplied by 100. The research questions addres sed by sub-cohorts are hypothesis-
generating and exploratory in nature. Initially 6 subjects will  be assigned to each sub-cohort to assess 
the effect of intervention. Selected sub-cohorts will be extend ed to enroll up additional 20 patients. 
The decision of extending the enrollment will be based on clini cal assessment without formal 
statistical testing. However, 20 patients will give 80% power t o detect 20% difference in % treatment 
compliance between two arms and 57% power to detect the differe nce of 25% in the number of days 
of having Grade II/III diarrhea using two-sided Z test with poo led variance at type I error rate of 0.15. 
The control rates assumed are 70% for treatment compliance and 30% for diarrhea. The patients will 
be sequentially allocated to different sub-cohorts by the Spons or to avoid section bias.
11 QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
The study will be initiated and conducted under the Sponsorship  of BBI. The clinical supplies of 
BBI608 and CRFs will be supplied by BBI or its representative. Re presentatives of BBI will monitor
the study to verify study data, medical records, and CRFs in acc ordance with current ICH GCPs and 
other applicable regulations and guidelines.
11.1 Compliance with the Protocol
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of any deviations from the protocol. Such contact with the 
Sponsor will be made as soon as possible to permit a decision as  to whether or not the subject (for 
whom the deviation from the protocol was effected) is to continu e in the study. The case records will
describe the deviation from the protocol and state the grounds fo r it. 
11.2 Registration and Enrollment
This is an open-label, non-randomized study. Boston Biomedical s hould be notified as soon as a
subject qualifies for entry in the protocol. Subjects will be r egistered by faxing Boston Biomedical or
their designee, within 7 days prior to the 1stdrug administration. At that time the combination arm 
will be assigned. The subject will be enrolled into the study w hen the subject receives the 1st dose of
study drug. Registration and enrollment forms and faxing instruc tions will be provided with the case
report forms (CRFs). The site should main t a i n  a  l o g  o f  a l l  s u b j e c t s  w h o  a r e s c r e e n e d  b u t  d o  n o t

16 APPENDIX D:  PHARMACOKINETIC STUDIES
Instructions for Collec ting a nd Processing Samples 
Sampling to define the plasma pharmacokinetics of BBI608 and Ce tuximab, or Panitumumab
or Capecitabine will be performed in the first 6 patients enrol led in each combination arm of 
the study. For the Cetuximab arm, samples are taken on Day 5-12  and Day 26-33 of cycle 1. 
For the Panitumumab arm, samples are taken on Day 8-15 and Day 22-29 of cycle 1. For the 
Capecitabine arm, samples are ta ken on Day 8-9 and Day 21-22 of  cycle 1. The sampling 
schedule and summary of procedures  that are to be used to estab lish times, collect samples, 
and process specimens for storage  prior to analysis, to insure t he acquisition of accurate
pharmacokinetic data, are described below. The sampling schedul e has been devised to 
accommodate treatment on an outpatient basis. Dosing of the fir st dose of drug must be 
started before 10 a.m. on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday to facilitate the collection of
the pharmacokinetic samples at th e scheduled times during the r egular operating hours of the 
outpatient clinics.
Before starting the BBI608 administration, place a large gauge peripheral catheter (e.g., 19 or 20
gauge angiocath straight set with T-connector, or similar IV acc ess device) within a vein in the
arm of the subject for the collection of pharmacokinetic blood samples. Patency of the 
sampling catheter should be maint ained between blood draws using  either a heparin lock 
(e.g., 10 U/mL in normal saline) o r a slow drip of Normal Salin e for Injection, USP (e.g., 10 
mL/hr). Extraordinary caution should be taken to prevent hemoly sis in the blood sample.
Blood may be obtained directly by venipuncture on days when onl y a single pharmacokinetic
blood specimen is scheduled for collection. When sampling throug h the peripheral catheter,
begin to clear the catheter approximately 1 min before the speci fied sample time by
withdrawing the lock solution and approximately 0.5 mL of blood  into a syringe. Remove 
and properly dispose the syringe  used to clear the catheter. 
A battery-powered digital timer/stopwatch programmed to operate  continuously as a 24-hr 
clock will be used to accurately monitor drug administration an d sample collection times. 
The same timer must be allowed to run without interruption until the last blood specimen has
been obtained from the subject dur ing the first cycle of therap y. Timer readings will be 
noted at the precise time that the administration is started as wel l as at the beginning and 
ending times of the bl ood sample collection intervals. Readings  of the digital timer must be 
directly recorded on a copy of t he appropriate Pharmacokinetic D osing and Blood Collection 
Time Form.
Please note that blood and plasma  must be protected from direct  exposure to light and all
s a m p l e  p r o c e s s i n g  p r o c e d u r e s  a r e  t o  b e  p e r f o r m e d  i n  a  r o o m  w i t h  indirect lighting. The 
volume of blood collected for each pharmacokinetic sample will be 3 mL. This volume has
shown to be adequate for the pharmacokinetic assay. Samples are  to be collected in plastic 
Vacutainer plasma collection tubes. Immediately wrap the tube w ith aluminum foil to 
protect it from exposure to light. Promptly mix the plasma collec tion tube by  gently
inverting 6-times, then place it on wet ice, and centrifuge (1,1 00-1,300 x g, 10 min, 4°C) 
Confidential Page: 49October 9th,2 0 1 4
Amendment #2Boston Biomedical, Inc
Clinical Protocol BBI608-224
within 5-10 min after collection. Separate the plasma from the bl ood cells using a pipette 
and transfer approximately equal volumes into three 2 mL self-sta nding opaque amber
polypropylene microcentrifuge cryogenic tubes with external thr eads. Affix a pre-printed 
label (protocol number, subject i nitials, subject number, sample  collection date and time) to 
the cryotube, oriented lengthwise toward the upper part of the tu be. Hand-written 
information on sample tube labels is absolutely prohibited. Comp letely cover the label with 
protective cryogenic freezer ta pe. Place the tube on crushed dr y-ice until stored in a freezer
maintained at -70°C. Any deviation from the sample collection time needs to be 
documented in the study subjects’ case report forms and in their s tudy binder.
The total volume of blood collect ed for pharmacokinetic studies , 100-120 mL, represents <
5% of the total blood volume for a 60 kg subject, during a 28-d ay treatment cycle. As
pharmacokinetic data becomes ava ilable during the course of the  trial, it may be necessary to 
modify the number of samples or the times at which they are col lected to more accurately
define the plasma conc entration-time profile of the drug. Howev er, the cumulative volume 
of blood collected for pharmac okinetic sampling will not exceed  240 mL, or approximately
5% of the total volume of a 60 k g subject during the first 4 we eks of study treatment. 
Computer files for dose administration and sample collection tim e forms and specimen tube 
labels will be placed in a subdirectory located on a secure netw ork server. All members of
the clinical, laboratory, and administrative staff involved wit h phase II studies will be given 
read-only access to this subdirectory. The files are placed unde r the following subdirectories: 
PK_Time_Forms; PK_Tube_Labels. Files for the PK time forms are pr inted directly from 
the file stored on the network server for each subject study. Si nce changes may be
periodically made to these forms, they cannot be copied onto user  personal computers and 
staff members are instructed not  to make photocopies of blank f orms. The PK_Tube_Label
files are templates, and the files are copied to user computers  and the limited information 
pertaining to each subject studied, typically the subject entry  no., is added by editing the 
computer file, then printed onto adhesive-backed labels. Hand-w ritten information  on 
sample tube labels is absolutely prohibited. There are separate sets of labels for blood 
collection vials and sample stor age tubes.  Blood collection via ls are prelabeled. 
Time points will be determined as the difference between the mi dpoint of the blood 
collection interval and starting time of dose administration. Co ncentration-time profiles of 
BBI608 and Cetuximab, or Panitumu mab or Capecitabine will be an alyzed by
noncompartmental methods and/or non linear least squares regress ion using WinNonlin 
(Scientific Consulting, Inc.). Pharmacokinetic parameters and v ariables will be calculated 
according to standard equations.

Instructions for Collecting, P rocessing and Shipping Samples 
Archival tissues:
Archival tissue samples should be  collected from all patients e nrolled in the clinical trial if
they are available. Submission of  paraffin embedded tissue bloc ks to Boston Biomedical is 
preferred. However, if tumor blo cks are not available, 20 positi vely charged, unstained tissue 
slides at 5 micron thickness should be sent to Boston Biomedica l. Archive tissue labels 
should be coded with the protocol number, study site number, the  patient’s initials and the 
patient number. Paraffin embedde d tissue blocks or prepared tiss ue slides should be shipped
by courier to Boston Biomedical at the address listed below. 
Fresh Tumor Biopsies:
Patients who are identified by t he principal investigator as ha ving a lesion, which could be 
biopsied with a minimally invasive technique, will be asked to sign an additional consent. 
Tumor biopsy samples should be collected at baseline and 4 hour s after administration of 
BBI608 on Day 8 of cycle 1. Tumor biopsies will be collected fo r immunohistochemitry- 
based analysis of the target and its downstream genes and for t he analysis of the effect of 
BBI608 on cancer stem cells. These samples will be used for resea rch purposes only. Tumor 
biopsies for analysis should be collected by core biopsy or min imally invasive procedures. 
Tumor specimen samples should be  processed sterilely into three parts: fixed, frozen, and 
fresh. 
Fixed Tumor Biopsies for Immunohistochemistry 
The sample should be processed to  yield paraffin embedded tissu es by the hospital pathology 
department using their  standard operating procedures. The sampl es should be labeled and 
coded with the protocol number, st udy site number, the patient’s  initials, the patient number
and the sample collection date and time. The paraffin embedded tissue blocks should be 
shipped to Boston Biomedical at  the address listed below. 
Fresh and Frozen Tumor Biopsy for cancer stem cell assays 
Tumor biopsies for the analysis of the effect of BBI608 on canc er stem cells should be 
collected by core biopsy or similar minimally invasive procedur es. Once the biopsy tissue is 
obtained, half of the biopsy tissue should be immediately and s terilely placed into CSC
transport media provided by Bost on Biomedical, stored and shippe d at 4ºC. Overnight 
shipment should be arranged on the same day as the biopsy is pe rformed. A label should be 
affixed to all sample tubes containing with the protocol number , study site number, the

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
STUDY TITLE  A phase 3, open -label, randomized, multicenter, 12 months , efficacy and safety 
study of weekly MOD -4023 compared to daily Genotropin® therapy in pre -
pubertal children with growth hormone deficiency . 
PROTOCOL NO. CP-4-006, Amendment 2, 27-APR -2018  
IND NO.  EUDRACT NO. 2016 -003874 -42 
CLINICAL 
SITES  The study will be conducted in approximately 30 -40 countries at approximately 
200 clinical  sites.  
STUDY PHASE  3 
THERAPEUTIC 
INDICATION  Treatment of children with growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency  
(GHD) . 
STUDY 
PRIMARY 
OBJECTIVE  To demonstrate that weekly MOD -4023 administration is non -inferior to daily 
Genotropin  administration . 
STUDY 
SECONDARY 
OBJECTIVE S  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of weekly MOD -4023 
administration.  
 To demonstrate successful operation (single injection) of the MOD -
4023 single patient use, multi -dose, disposable pre -filled pen (PEN ).  
 Evaluation of participant and observer feedback on MOD -4023 device 
usability.  
 To confirm the  correct operation of devic es returned for evaluation . 
LT-OLE 
OBJECTIVE  To demonstrate long  term (LT) safety and efficacy of MOD -4023 in a n open -
label extension  (OLE) . 
OTHER  
OBJECTIVE S To evaluate the effect of weekly MOD -4023 and daily Genotropin® 
administration on quality of life (QoL) , as measured by the  QoLISSY  (Quality 
of Life in Short Stature Youth)  in a specific number of countries  (determined by 
availability of validated translated tools ) during the first 12 months of treatment .  
STUDY DESIGN  The study will initially consist of a 12 month, open -label, randomized, active 
controlled, parallel group study comparing the efficacy and safety of weekly 
MOD -4023 to daily growth hormone  (GH) , Genotropin®. Patients will enter a 
long term open -label  extension to demo nstrate  continued safety and efficacy of 
MOD -4023 treatment (all patients) after successful completion of the first 12 
months of treatment .  
Initial  Study  Period (main study) : After a screening period lasting up to 8 
weeks  (wks), patients meeting the eligibility  criteria, as approved by  the Global 
Study Medical Monitor  (MM) , will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to MOD -4023 
or Genotropin® for 12 months.   
If the patient’s screening process is delayed because of a benign illness or 
unforeseen benign condition (i.e. pharyngitis, viral gastrointestinal ( GI) 
problems, minor accident or trauma, etc.) or a technical issue that is related to 
screening procedures ( for example, delays with lab results), extra time  will be 
added to the duration of the screening period, but not in excess of an additional 4 
wks (total of 12 wks).  
An independent and external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will 
review the key safety data  approximately every 4 months  or on ad hoc  basis .

LT-OLE  Period (LT -OLE) : Patients who received MOD -4023 during the main 
study  will continue in the LT -OLE with the same dose (mg/kg/wk) of MOD -
4023. Patients who received Genotropin® during the main study  will be switched 
to MOD -4023 and will begin treatment with a dose of 0.66 mg/kg/wk beginning 
no less than one day after cessation of Genotropin® treatment. The key safety 
data will be reviewed by an independent DSMB approximately every 6 months.     
During the entire study, dose s will be adjusted based on the patients’ body 
weight every 3 months. The dose may be decreased or maintained for safety 
reasons according to the pre -defined dose -adjustment criteria (based on the 
severity of adverse events  [AEs] or repeated, elevated levels of insulin -like 
growth factor -1 [IGF -1] Standard Deviation Score [SDS]).  
STUDY 
PROCEDURES  Visit 1 - Screening Period ( Day -56 to Day -1) 
The Screening period will last up to 8 wksa and can be conducted over several 
visits prior to eligibility approval and randomization. Screening visits are 
intended to collect current clinical data and to perform all required investigations 
needed to establish a patient’s eligibility for the study. Prior to any study -
specific investigations, written assent from pediatric patients (where applicable 
based on age and country) and consent from the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) 
will be obtained.  
The following assessments will be conducted at these screening visits:  
 Inclusion/exclusion verification.  
 Parental heightsb (Ht), and patients’ Ht, Ht SDS, Ht velocity (HV) and 
HV SDS . 
 Body weight and body mass index (BMI) SDS . 
 Medical history, including a  description of pituitary deficiencies, 
concomitant and previous medications . 
 Overall health status assessment , including  complete physical 
examination  and vital signs . 
 Pubertal status (according to Tanner stages) . 
 Bone age (BA) determination according to  the method of Greulich -Pyle 
using a central BA readerc. 
 Assessment of biochemical markers and stimulation testsd: 
o Two different GH stimulation (provocation) tests: insulin 
tolerance test (ITT) (with serum cortisol response to 
                                                 
a If the patient’s screening process is delayed because of a benign illness or unforeseen benign condition (i.e. 
pharyngitis, viral GI problems, minor accident or trauma, etc.) or a technical issue that is related to screening 
procedures (for example, delay s with laboratory results), extra time will be added to the duration of the 
screening period, but not in excess of an additional 4 wks (total of 12 wks screening period).  
b It's recommended that parents’ Ht be measured at the site. If measured parental Ht is not available an estimate 
should be provided by the parent.  
c Historical BA assessment might be accepted if it was done according to the method of Greulich -Pyle no more 
than 6 months prior to the informed consent form (ICF) signature date. If the patien t is eligible, the BA must 
be repeated at Visit 2 prior to dosing. The Visit 2 scan will be the baseline scan for these patients.  
d Local, documented provocation tests that were performed  prior to ICF signature, might be accepted by the 
global study MM ac cording to his/her judgment.  
e ITT with serum cortisol response to hypoglycemia is adequate for assessment of adrenal insufficiency and no 
ACTH stimulation test is required if such results are available. Historical ACTH test is acceptable.

hypoglycemia if insulin stimulation test is chosen)/arginine 
test/clonidine test/glucagon test/L -dopa  test. 
o Analysis of serum GH levels (and glucose and serum cortisol if 
ITT is performed) may be performed  by local laboratories and 
must  be provided for  global MM review and approv al. 
o Assessment  of morning cortisol ( at 8 am  ± 1 hour)  
 If morning cortisol is below 190  nmol/ L (7 μg/dL), test 
for adrenal insufficiency will be required – low dose 
adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH )e or corticotropin 
releasing hormone ( CRH ) stimulation test  (only if the 
patient was not previously assessed for the 
hypothalamus -pituitary -adrenal axis  or has been 
diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency ).  
o Assessment of IGF-1, IGF-1 SDS, IGF binding protein -3 
(IGFBP -3) and IGFBP -3 SDS levels .  
 Assessment of anti -human GH ( hGH ) antibody (Ab) levels . 
 Assessments of routine safety: chemistry, hematology and urinalysis .  
 Assessment of thyroid function tests ( thyroid stimulating hormone 
[TSH ], free thyroxine [ FT4]). 
 Assessment of glucose metabolism ( overnight fasting insulin, overnight 
fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin [HbA1C ]). 
 Head magnetic resonance imaginga (MRI) , if possible with contrast  or 
computed tomography (CT) scan . 
 Assessment of karyotype in girlsb. 
 SHOX (short stature homeobox) gene  evaluationc. Patients with 
confirmed multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies or confirmed 
structurally a bnormal pituitary gland  or other anatomical reasons for 
GHD  do not require SHOX gene evaluation.  SHOX gene evaluation is 
mandatory for isolated GHD wit h normal brain MRI.  
All lab oratory  assessments are performed  by a central lab oratory  unless stated 
otherwise.  
Key data and all test results obtained during screening will be reviewed by the  
Global  Study MM  and eligibility will be confirmed prior to randomization  of 
each patient.   It is recommended that the Investigator r andomiz e the patient  
within 7 days of confirmed eligibility.  
Main Study Treatment Period ( Day 1/ Baseline to Month 12)  
Eligible patients will be randomized (centralized randomization  within each 
region) in a 1:1 fashion to receive either weekly MOD -4023 or daily 
Genotropin® for 12 months.  
The following 3 stratification factors will be applied when randomizing patients 
to the treatment groups:  
                                                 
a Historical  MRI or CT is permitted if within 12 months  prior to ICF signature date .  For GHD associated with a 
congenital central nervous system ( CNS ) defect, the global study MM  could allow for use of the historic MRI or 
CT > 12 months old.  
b. Historical karyotype data and chromosomal microarray data are acceptable.  
c Historical data is acceptable.

LT-OLE  (Visit 10 to Visit 16) : 
After successful completion of 12 months treatment in the main study  and 
continuing to meet the LT-OLE inclusion/exclusion criteria of this protocol, 
patients will be eligible to rollover into a single arm LT -OLE treatment period 
with MOD -4023. An informed consent/assent will be obtained from patients 
and/or parent or legal/authorized guardian. Patients who  received MOD -4023 
during the main study  will continue with the same dose (mg/kg/wk), adjusted for 
body weight, of MOD -4023  they received . For these patients, study visits will 
take place on Day 4 ( -1) post -dose.  These patients will con sent to the LT -OLE  
preferably during  Visit 7 of the main study to ensure availability of MOD -4023 
at their next visit . If necessary, informed consent can be obtained at Visit 8  main 
study /10 LT-OLE . These Patients will con tinue treatment at visit 8/10, skip 
Visit s 9 and  11 and have a telephone visit at Visit 1 2 (one month post LT -OLE 
entry (Month 13 [±2wk]) ). 
Patients who received Genotropin®, during the main study  will be switched to 
MOD -4023 starting  no less than one day [+2wk] after cessation of Genotropin® 
treatment.  Recommended injection days are indicated in Appendix E. These 
patients will consent to the LT -OLE preferably during  Visit 7 of the main study 
to ensure availability of MOD -4023 at their next visit. If necessary, informed 
consent can be obtained at Visit 8/ 10. Patients will begin treatment  with MOD -
4023  at Visit 8/10, skip Visit 9  and have additional onsite visits at Visit 11 
(Month 12, Day 10 post first MOD -4023 dose [10+4 days]) and Visit 1 2 (one 
month  post first MOD -4023 dose (Month 13 [±2wk]) ).  All patients will be

INVESTIGATIONAL 
PRODUC T (IP) 
ROUTE AND 
DOSAGE FORM  MOD -4023 is a long -acting modified r-hGH  which utilizes C -terminal peptide 
(CTP) technology. It will b e provided as a solution for injection containing 20 or 
50 mg/mL MOD -4023 in a single patient use, multi -dose, disposable pre -filled  
pen (PEN ).   
Somatr ogon is the International Nonproprietary Name/United States Adopted 
Name ( INN/USAN ) of MOD -4023 and can be used interchangeably with MOD -
4023 . 
MOD -4023 will be administered as a subcutaneous ( SC) injection,  preferably  
(but not required)  in the morning hours once weekly, using  the PEN  into the 
upper arms, buttocks, thighs, or abdomen (8 locations).  
Injecti on sites should be rotated, it is  recommended that all 8  injection sites 
should be used successively, using a different injection site at each subsequent 
injection.  
The starting dose for the weekly administration will be 0.66 mg/kg/wk . All 
patients on Genotropin® that complete Visit 8/10 and continue into the LT -OLE 
will start treatment with MOD -4023 at 0.66 mg/kg/wk.  
IGF-1 SDS will be monitored throughout the study, and i f a patient has an IGF -1 
level above +2.0 SDS, they will be requested to return for an unscheduled visit 
 
 Protocol for Clinical Study CP -4-006 - USA

Confidential Document  
within 4 -6 wks after the > +2.0 SDS result, on  day 4( -1) post dose (for MOD -
4023 treated patients ).  If their IGF -1 level is still > +2.0 SDS, the most recent 
dose will be reduced by 15% .  They will continue to be monitored for any 
further dose reduction.  
REFERENCE 
THERAPY  Genotropin® is a daily GH, and is  used as the reference therapy  in this study.  
A delivery device ( Genotropin® Pen) will be used for daily (evening/bedtime) 
SC administration of Genotropin® into the region of the upper arms, buttocks, 
thighs or abdomen (8 locations). Injection sites should be rotated.  
Starting dose regimen for Genotropin®: 0.034 mg/kg/d ay (which is equivalent to 
0.24 mg/kg/w k divided equally into 7 daily injections).   
IGF-1 SDS will be monitored throughout the study, and i f a patient has an IGF -1 
level above +2.0 SDS, they will be requested to return for an unscheduled visit 
within 4 -6 wks after the > +2.0 SDS result, on  any day post dose  (for 
Genotropin® treated patients) .  If their IGF -1 level is still above +2.0 SDS, the 
most recent dose will be reduced by 15% .  They will continue to be monitored 
for any further dose reduction.

SAMPLE SIZE 
CALCULATION  The aim of the study is to demonstrate that SC weekly MOD -4023 is non -
inferior to SC daily Genotropin® administration with respect to the primary 
efficacy endpoint of annual HV in cm/year after 12 months of treatment.  
Non-inferiority will be concluded if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for the mean treatment difference (MOD -4023 – 
Genotropin®) in the primary efficacy endpoint is >–1.8 cm/year .  
 
 Protocol for Clinical Study CP -4-006 - USA

Confidential Document  
The following assumptions were made in the sampl e size calculation:  
 2-sided alpha of 0.05 , 
 80% power , 
 between -patient standard deviation of annual growth rate of 2. 5 cm/year in 
all treatment groups , 
 non-inferiority margin of –1.8 cm/year , 
 true mean treatment difference (MOD -4023 – Genotropin®) in the primary 
efficacy endpoint of –0.8 cm/year.  
With these assumptions, 100 treated patients  per group will provide 80% power 
for the non -inferiority test . To allow for an approximate 10% dropout rate, 110 
patients will be randomized to each treatment group , for a total of  220 patients.  
STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS:  Details on the statistical methods will be provided in a Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP) prior to database lock.  
The aim of the present study is to demonstrate that in terms of annual HV at 12 
months (p rimary efficacy endpoint), weekly MOD -4023 is non -inferior to daily 
Genotropin® administration by a non -inferiority margin of 1.8 cm/year .  
With µ M and µ C representing the mean annual HV                                                                  
at 12 months for the MOD -4023 and the Genotropin® (Control) group, 
respectively, the following hypotheses will be tested:  
Null hypothesis H 0: µM < µ C – 1.8 cm/year ;   
Versus ( vs.) 
Alternate hypothesis H 1: µM ≥ µ C – 1.8 cm/year  
Non-inferiority will be concluded for the primary efficacy endpoint if the lower 
bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the mean treatment difference (MOD -4023 – 
Genotropin®) is ≥ –1.8 cm/year .  
Primary Efficacy Analysis : The CI for the difference of means between the 2 
treatments will be derived from an analysis using Analysis of Covariance 
(ANCOVA ).   The ANCOVA model will include the stratification classes for 
treatment, age group, peak hGH value during stimulation test, regio n and 
gender, and Baseline H t SDS as a covariate.  The determination of non -
inferiority will be based on least squares means for the 2 treatments from the 
ANCOVA and the 95% CI of the differences between the treatments.  
Summary  statistics for HV at end of  treatment and for absolute change in HV 
from Baseline to end of treatment, will be presented by treatment group (and 
further stratified  by factors used in the ANCOVA model).  
Secondary Analys es: Annualized HV after 6 months of treatment, and change 
(from Baseline) in Ht SDS at 6 and 12 months will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics.  These 3 endpoints will each be analyzed using a similar 
ANCOVA  model as used for the primary endpoint, with terms for treatment and 
the randomization strata (age, peak hGH value during  stimulation test, region), 
gender and baseline  value for each endpoint of interest . The model -derived least 
square means and standard error ( SE) will be used to construct 95% CI for the 
difference between treatment groups.  These analyses are considered as 
supportive efficacy analyses.  
Change in BM, calculated as BA/CA at the end of 12 months, compared to 
 
 Protocol for Clinical Study CP -4-006 - USA

Effective Date: Date of final electronic approval  
 
 
Confidential Document  
Baseline  will be characterized with descr iptive statistics (mean, SD, and 95% 
CI) for each treatment group.  
Primary Efficacy Sensitivity Analysis: The ANCOVA -based primary efficacy 
analysis will be repeated using the modified intent -to-treat (mITT) set and the 
per protocol (PP) set.  
The ANCOVA -based primary efficacy analysis will be repeated on the full 
analysis set using last observation carried forward (LOCF) in place of multiple 
imputation for the handling of missing data.  
OAT and PAT  (USA Only)  
OAT and PAT results will be summarized b y using descriptive statistics.  
Proportion and counts of successful single injections out of total number of 
single injections using the MOD -4023 PEN in US A patients  at Wks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
and 6, based on the PAT will be reported. Similarly, counts and pro portion of 
successful single injections out of total number of single injections using the 
MOD -4023 PEN in US A patients  at Wk 1, based on the OAT will be reported. 
Details on the criteria constituting a successful single injection based on OAT 
and PAT, alo ng with statistical methods to be used for descriptive summaries 
will be included in the SAP.  
Comments on the PAT and OAT related to successful or unsuccessful injection 
attempts  
The written comments provided on the PAT and OAT for successful or 
unsuccessful injection attempts will be listed. Any other written comments will 
also be listed.  
Information gained by inspection of returned devices  
Summary of the information gathered by inspecting the returned devices will be 
reported.  
The QoLISSY core total score at Baseline, 12 months and change from Baseline 
to month 12,  for each group will be summarized using descriptive statistics. This 
will be done for specific countries as listed i n the Appendix L.  
Biochemical Endpoints  
IGF-1, IGF-1 SDS, IGFBP -3 and IGFBP -3 SDS will be summarized 
descriptively by visit.  Statistical comparisons between treatment groups are not 
planned.   Incidence of IGF-1 SDS >2 .0 will summarized at each visit and in 
total as percentage of total samples.  
Safety data  will be reported mainly using descriptive summaries for treatment 
emergent AEs and laboratory values that fall outside of pre -determined ranges. 
Both listings and tabular summaries will be reported for all safety endpoints.  
LT-OLE:  
The assessment of safet y and efficacy (auxology/clinical and biochemical 
endpoints)  during the LT -OLE will be based on descriptive statistics and 
summarized by patient’s treatment in the treatment period and overall. No 
hypothesis testing will be performed. The descriptive stati stics will include 
means, standard deviations, quartiles/ranges for continuous variables, and counts 
with percentages for categorical data. 95% CI will be used to further describe the 
clinical endpoints. A separate SAP for the LT -OLE will be provided.

1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY  
Human growth hormone (hGH) is a 191 -amino -acid pituitary protein that stimulates hepatic 
production and release of IGF-1 into the systemic circulation. IGF-1 is an important mediator  in the 
promotion of linear growth in children  and may play a role  in the regulation of  metabolism and 
body composition in adults. These factors are regulated through complex feedback mechanisms 
involving hGH, IGFBP -3 and their complexes  (Shalet, Toogood et al. 1998 ; Bach 2004 ).  
A GHD results in inadequate circulating IGF-1 levels and is manifested as abnormal linear growth 
in children (Krysiak, Gdula -Dymek et al. 2007 ; Thomas and Monson 2009 ).  
Childhood GHD can be congenital, acquired, or idiopathic. Underlying causes for c ongenital 
malformation include pituitary dysfunction due to abnormal neurodevelopment in utero  of certain 
brain regions and genetic abnormalities. Etiology for acquired GHD includes brain tumors in the 
hypothalamic region, traumatic brain injury, infiltrative disease, cranial irradiation and surgical 
intervention.  The idiopathic origin of GHD is po orly understood but it appears to be multifactorial 
(Rona and Tanner 1977 ).  
Data on incidence  and prevalence  rates of GHD are scarce. A nationwide study in  Denmark 
reported average incidence rate of 2.58 males,  and 1.7 females per 100,000 population  for 
childhood onset of GH D (Stochholm, Gravho lt et al. 2006 ). The prevalence and demographic s of 
childhood GHD in Belgium during the period 1986 -2001 was estimated to be 1/5600. The origin of 
GHD was idiopathic in 41% of the patients, congenital in 20% and acquired in 7%; there was male 
predominance in all 3 categories (Thomas, Massa et al. 2004 ).  The n umber of new cases has 
remained fairly constant over the last 2 decades. The Belgi an data are comparable to other 
countries; the prevalence of GHD in the USA  in the 1990’s was at least 1:3480, with male 
predominance (Lindsay, Feldkamp et al. 1994 ).  
Most morbidity in children with GHD relates to short stature. The inability to achieve normal Ht 
can lead to early onset of severe psychosocial problems directly related to short stature.  This is 
confounded  by delayed puberty and deficits in facial, dental and (in males) genital development.  
Approximately 5% of children with GHD have episodes of hypogl ycemia, particularly in infancy  
(Krysiak, Gdula -Dymek et al. 2007 ). Persistency of GHD i nto adulthood is associated with 
increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.  
1.2 CURRENT THERAPY  
Recombinant hGH (r-hGH)  replacement therapy has been used for over 30 years in tens of 
thousands of patients  (primarily children)  and has proved to be safe and effective  (Ho 2007 ; Cohen, 
Rogol et al. 2008 ). The main therapeutic goal of GH treatm ent in children with GHD is to enable 
short children to achieve normal Ht, with early improvement of the psychosocial problems related 
to short stature.  Treatment is by daily SC injection of r-hGH.  The Growth Hormone Research 
Society ( GRS ) consensus guideline recommends a dose range of 0.025 -0.05 mg/kg/day, although 
in Europe generally a dose of 0.025 -0.035 mg/kg /day or 0.7 -1.0 mg/m² body surface area /day is 
recommended ( according to the Summary of Product Characteristics ( SmPC ) of Somatrop in 
products).  Treatment response is assessed by measurement of Ht and growth velocity and is 
usually continued until final Ht, epiphyseal  closure, or both have been recorded .

The majority of currently available hGH  products require daily or every other da y SC or 
intramuscular  (IM)  injections to maintain hGH blood levels within the effective therapeutic 
window. The burden of daily administration  and its concomitant side effects (e.g., injection site 
discomfort, transient edema and arthralgia) cause a reduction in compliance  (Rosenfeld and Bakker 
2008 ) and can limit the therapeutic utility of existing formulations.   
Developments in drug delivery technology have allowed the use of slow -release preparations of 
GH in humans (Cook, Biller et al. 2002 ; Kemp, Fielder et al. 2004 ; Bidlingmaier, Kim et al. 2006 ).  
The most successful technology so far has been the encapsulation of GH molecules in poly  (D,L -
lactic -co-glycolic acid) biodegradable microspheres  (Makadia and Siegel 2011 ). A more recent 
formulation of GH called LB03002 is an injectable, sustained -release GH suspension of 
microparticles, consisting of GH incorporated into sodium hyaluronate, which are dispersed in an 
oil base of medium -chain tri glycerides before injection.  Hyaluronate is a natural biomaterial found 
in connective tissues including skin and cartilage and is naturally degraded by hyaluronidase as 
part of the physiological turnover process.  This formulation has been demonstrated to  have long 
acting properties with suitable pharmacokinetic ( PK) and pharmacodynamic ( PD) profiles  
(Bidlingmaier, Kim et al.  2006 ) and efficacy indistinguishable from daily GH treatment in 
childhood G HD when administered weekly  (Peter, Bidlingmaier et al. 2012 ). 
1.3 INVESTIGATIONAL THERAPY  
MOD -4023 is a long -acting r-hGH for SC administration. It consists of hGH fused to three  copies 
of the CTP of the beta chain of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG); one copy at the N -terminus 
and two copies (in tandem) at the C -terminus . 
The CTP provides hCG with the required longevity to maintain pregnancy (initial half-life ( t1/2) ~ 
10 hours,  terminal t1/2 ~ 37 hours). The beta chain of luteinizing hormone (LH), a gonadotropin that 
triggers ovulation, is almost identical to hCG, but does not include the CTP. As a result, LH has a 
significan tly shorter half-life  in blood (initial t1/2 ~ 1 hour,  terminal t1/2 ~ 10 hours). It is, therefore, 
suggested that the addition of CTP to a protein other than hCG may enable to increase the 
corresponding protein longevity  (Hershkovitz et al. 2015). 
Somatro gon is the INN/USAN of MOD -4023 and can be used interchangeably with MOD -4023 . 
1.3.1 Clinical Studies  
MOD -4023  clinical development program includes , apart from the current study,  five studies 
which have been completed . Two (2) Phase 1 studies  (CP-4-001, CP-4-007) in healthy adult male 
volunteers , and Phase 2  studies in GHD adults  (CP-4-003) and pre-pubertal GHD children  (CP-
4-004) were  completed . A Phase 3 pivotal study (CP-4-005) in adult patients  with GHD is 
completed  and pending final clinical stud y report . Currently, both CP-4-004 and CP -4-005 are 
continu ing as an OLE  until marketing approval.  
The Phase 1 study  (CP-4-001) was conducted in 24 healthy adult male volunteers

Another Phase 1 study (CP -4-007) was conducted in healthy male Caucasian and Japanese 
volunteers.  A total of 42 subjects were enrolled and randomized,  
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
The Phase 2 , randomized, open -label, multicen ter study  (CP-4-003) in  adults with GHD  was 
designed  to assess the safety, tolerability and PK/PD profile of three  doses of MOD -4023 
administered on a weekly regimen and one exploratory dose on an every other wk regimen . MOD -
4023 was  administered for a period of four wks in adult GHD  patients  who were previously on a 
stable, standard r -hGH treatment for at least six months. Fifty -four (54) patients  (48 men and 6 
women ) were enrolled and completed the study. The clinical adverse effect s (such as headache ) 
were  consistent with those expected in a GHD population  and were mostly of a mild nature.  
The completed Phase 2 study ( CP-4-004) in a pediatric population  was designed to assess the 
safety, efficacy and tolerability of three  MOD -4023 doses as compared to that of a commercially 
available standard daily r -hGH formulation in up to 56 pre -pubertal children with growth failure 
due to insufficient secretion of endogenous GH. Fifty -three  (53) patients were enrolled and treated  
with 5 2 of them finishing the 12 -month portion of the study . All three  MOD -4023 dose groups 
demonstrated a growth response comparable to daily r-hGH after  12 months of treatment , as 
described in detail in the Investigator Brochure  (IB), with a safety profile con sistent with 
commercially available r-hGH products .  
A Phase 3 pivotal study (CP-4-005) in adult patients  with GHD  was recently completed . The study 
is a randomized, parallel -group, multi -center study consist ing of a 26 -wk double -blind, placebo -
controlled (DBPC) period, a 26 -wk long -term OLE, in which all patients  receive MOD -4023, and a 
two-wk washout perioda. The starting dose of study drug differed by gender, age and estrogen 
therapy . Individual dose titration  was conducted according to a dose modification plan . The main 
study, first 12 months , has been completed  and is currently being analyzed and reported .

1.3.2 Study Ra tionale  
OBL’s  proprietary CTP technology has enabled the production of a long -acting hGH (MOD -4023), 
which may obviate the need for the numerous injections  currently required in marketed  hGH 
products. As demonstrated in animal models and clinical studies , MOD -4023 may be injected once 
per wk resulting in similar clinical efficacy as compared to daily injections of r -hGH .

The purpose of the current Phase 3 study is to demonstrate that weekly MOD -4023 administration  
in pre -pubertal children  with GHD is clinic ally comparable (non -inferior) to daily Genotropin® 
administration in terms of safety and efficacy  after 12 months treatment duration . The study  will be 
conducted  in a randomized, open -label , active -controlled, parallel -group d esign . After completion 
of an initial 12 months treatment patients will be eligible to continue treatment with weekly MOD -
4023 in a single arm, long term open -label extension (LT -OLE)  study  for the purpose of collecting 
additional long term safety  and efficacy information . 
1.3.3 Rationale  for Dose Selection  
MOD -4023 is a new molecular entity with GH mechanism of action demonstrating reduced 
receptor affinity, lower specific activity , but with an extended , optimized  t1/2.  
The in vitro  activity and receptor binding affinity of MOD -4023 were  established based on 
comprehensive characterization  studies  as part of the non-clinical program. MOD -4023, which is 
comprised of 72.3% net hGH on a molar basis, demonstrated 10  to 20-fold reduction in affinity to 
GH receptors (GHR) as compared to r -hGH (B iacore analysis). This was further strengthened by 
two independent cell-based  assays analysis indicating that MOD -4023 had a significant ly lower 
biological activity as compared to daily hGH.  
Based on the in vitro  non-clinical pharmacological findings  and Phase 2 data  it was concluded that 
any dose comparisons between MOD -4023 and hGH that  were initially done on molar  basis were 
not reflective  of the biological effect of the molecule. Therefore, the selection of MOD -4023 dose 
for th e Phase 3 studies was  determined by safety parameters and in particular by the clinical effect , 
i.e. HV. 
This assumption was confirmed during the Phase 2 pediatric study, when monitoring the IGF-1 
response.  Two (2) of the doses of MOD -4023 administered in the Phase 2 study, 0.48 and 
0.66 mg/kg/wk, resulted in comparable IGF -1 and IGFBP -3 profiles to that of Genotropin® 
administered daily at a dose of 34 µg/kg/day.  These two doses of MOD -4023 were shown to 
maintain IGF -1 serum levels, with values that were in the middle part of th e gender and age -
adjusted normal range (~0 SDS).  MOD -4023 dose of 0. 25 mg/kg/wk failed to maintain normal 
IGF-1 serum levels mainly during the second part of the wk, indicating that IGF -1 levels will be at 
the lower part of the normal range or even below it with the use of this dose on weekly basis.  
These observations were further confirmed by the population -based  model . Mean IGF-1 SDS 
values for Cohort 3 and Cohort  2 (MOD -4023 dose of 0. 66 and 0.4 8 mg/kg/wk , respectively ) were 
around 0 SDS IGF-1, and consistently much lower than 0 for Cohort 1 (0.25  mg/kg/wk). Therefore,  
it is proposed that MOD -4023 doses of 0.48 and 0.66 mg/kg/wk are more likely to result in IGF -1 
and IGFBP -3 levels that  are comparable to daily Genotropin® injections within the well -established 
suitable safety range with no direct correlation to GH molar content.  
As the dose selection is driven by evaluating the annual increment in HV, the annual HV  data 
obtained for MOD -4023 was compared to Genotropin® results in the Phase 2 study for 52 patients  
(one patient was mis -diagnosed) . Based on 12 -month auxology data, it is most likely that a 
minimum MOD -4023 dose of 0. 66 mg/kg/wk will provide an annualized HV comparable to daily 
hGH  at a dose of 34 µg/kg/day .

Other Objective s: 
To evaluate the effect of weekly MOD -4023 and daily Genotropin® administration on QoL, as 
measured by the  QoLISSY  in a specific number of countries  (determined by availability of  
validated  translated tools ) during the first 12 months of treatment .  
3. STUDY DESIGN  
The study will consist of 12 months, open -label, multi -center, randomized, active co ntrolled, 
parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of weekly MOD -4023 to daily GH, 
Genotropin®. 
Both drugs will be injected using a PEN  device.  
The study will be divided into two parts : 
Main Study  Period (main study) : After a n 8 wk screening perioda, patients meeting the eligibility 
criteria , as approved by  global study MM, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to weekly SC doses of 
MOD -4023 (investigational treatment) or daily SC administration of Genotropin® (reference 
therapy) for 12 months . The key safety data will be reviewed by an independent DSMB  every 4 
months  or on an ad hoc  basis .   
LT-OLE  Period (LT -OLE) : Patients who received MOD -4023  during the main study  will 
continue in the LT -OLE with the same dose (mg/kg /wk) of MOD -4023 . Patients who received 
Genotropin® during the main study  will be switched to MOD -4023  and will begin treatment with a 
dose of  0.66 mg/kg/wk beginning no less than one day after cessation of Genotropin® treatment . 
The key safety data will be reviewed by an independent DSMB approximately every 6 months .    
During the entire study  (main  study and LT -OLE) , the dose of MOD -4023 and Genotropin® will be 
adjusted every 3 months based on  the patient’s body weight. Doses may  be decreased for safety 
reasons according to the pre -defined dose -adjustment criteria  (which will be based on the severity 
                                                 
a If the patient’s screening process is delayed because of a benign illness or unforeseen benign condition (i.e. 
pharyngitis, viral GI problems, minor accident or trauma, etc.) or other technical issue that is related screening 
procedures (for example, delays with laboratory results) extra time will be added to the duration of the screening 
period, but not in excess of an additional four wks (total of 12 wks screening period).

of AEs or repeated, elevated levels of IGF -1). The dose will be decreased based on two, repeated 
day 4( -1) post -dose levels of IGF -1 SDS ≥ +2.0  (Section 6.4). During the LT -OLE, dose reduction 
for IGF -1 level >+2.0 SDS will be made following consultation with the Global Study M M on an 
individual patient basis  
The total duration of patient  participation in the main study  will be up to 15 months  (12 months of 
treatment , up to eighta (+4) wks of  screening  and one month post dosing  EOS follow up  for patients 
not continuing in the LT -OLE , discontinued early or following study closure ).  
The LT -OLE will continue until marketing approval .  
The study will be conducted at approximately  200 sites in 30-40 countries worldwide .

LT-OLE.  
4.4 REMOVAL , REPLACEMENT , OR EARLY WITHDRAWAL OF PATIENTS  FROM THERAPY OR 
ASSESSMENT  
Patients  are free to discontinue their participation in the study at a ny time and without prejudice to 
further treatment. The investigator must withdraw any patient  from the study if that patient  or 
parent /legal guardian requests to be withdrawn. Patients  withdrawn from the study during the  12 
months of treatment  post first dose will not be replaced.  Those patients withdrawn who have 
successfully completed screening , but prior to first dose , will be replaced.  
 
 Protocol for Clinical Study CP -4-006 - USA

Confidential Document  
The patient's participation in this study may be discontinued due to the following reasons:  
 Request from re gulatory agency, sponsor, primary care physician, or Investigator.  
 Withdrawal of the patient’s /parent’s /legal guardian's consent  for any additional study 
participation or procedure, including lost to follow up  (with specific withdrawal reason 
collected , as possible ). 
 AE: 
o Occurrence of a malignancy during the course of the study . 
o Development of serious intercurrent critical illness . 
o Development of benign intracranial hypertension, if the symptoms return 
following resumption of drug (after a temporary stop) . 
o Occurrence of AEs following which the Investigator,  or the patient wishes to 
discontinue treatment (such as, but not limited to, slipped capital femoral 
epiphysis, scoliosis, avascular necrosis and development of lipoatrophy, etc.).  
 Intake of prohibited concomitant medication  (in consultation with the MM) .  
 Investigator decides that withdrawal from the study is in the best interest of the patient  e.g. 
patient non -compliance, occurrence of neutralizing Ab, protocol deviation(s) (including 
protocol deviatio n(s) that affect patient safety and accuracy, and/or validity of data) etc. 
 Any clinically significant  change in the patient’s medical condition.  
 
During the LT -OLE:  
 Girls with a BA of ≥13.5 years and boys with a BA of ≥16 years.   
 Positive urine pregnancy test or confirmed pregnancy. In case of pregnancy, the study drug 
should be discontinued, and the Global Study MM be alerted immediately. All pregnancy 
tests used in this study, either urine or serum, must have a sensitivity of at least 25  mIU/mL 
and must be performed by a certified laboratory.  Pregnancy te sts will also be done whenever 
one menstrual cycle is missed during treatment (main study and LT -OLE)  and when potential 
pregnancy is otherwise suspected and may be repeated if r equested by institutional review 
boards (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations.  In the case of a 
positive confirmed pregnancy, the patient  will be withdrawn from administration of 
investigational product but may remain in the s tudy for follow up .  
 When the patient 's annualized growth rate  is ≤ 2 cm/12 months (the interval between two 
height measurements should be at least six months).  
Patients can be re -screened for inclusion in the main study one time.  Any data collected duri ng 
the original screening period will be acceptable as historical data, EXCEPT safety laboratory 
data and IGF -1 and IGFBP -3 levels, which must be repeated and evaluated for eligibility.  In 
this case, the patient will be assigned a new screening number.  
4.5 HANDLING OF WITHDRAWALS  
If a patient is withdrawn from the study or fails to return either at his or her request or at the 
investigator ’s discretion  after randomization,  every effort should be made to determine the reason.  
This information will be recorded  on the patient ’s electronic case report form ( eCRF). All patients  
who withdraw from the study prematurely, regardless of cause, should undergo all early 
termination assessments (see  Section  5.5). It is vital to obtain follow -up data for any patient  
withdr awn due to  an A E or abnormal laboratory test finding. In any case, every effort must be

made to undertake safety follow -up procedures.  If a patient wishes to withdraw, the difference 
between treatment discontinuation and study withdrawal will be explained. Patients should be 
encouraged to continue the follow up visits and at minimum provide a Ht measurement at 
12 months of the initial treatment period even if they discontinue the study treatment early.  
4.6 SPONSOR 'S TERMINATION OF STUDY   
The Spons or reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for any reason.  
Regulatory Authorities also have the right to terminate the study.  
5. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  AND STUDY PROCEDURES  
A schedule of events for this study is shown in  Appendix A. No protocol related  procedures, 
including the cessation of prohibited concomitant medications should be performed before patients  
provide writtena assent (where applicable) and consent from the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) is 
obtained . Study related  events and activities including specific instructions, procedures, 
concomitant medications, dispensing of study drugs  and descriptions of AEs should be  recorded in 
the appropriate source documents and /or eCRF.   
5.1 VISIT 1 - SCREENING PERIOD  (DAY – 56 TO DAY -1)  
The screening period will last up to  8 wksb and can be conducted over several visits prior to 
randomization , to minimize blood volume withdrawals per visit . Screening visits are intended to 
collect current clinical data and to perform all required investigations needed to establish a 
patient’s eligibility for the study. Prior to any study specific assessments , written assent from 
pediatric patients (where applicable based on age and country) and consent from the parent(s) or 
legal guardian(s) will be obtained . Upon completion of the Informed Consent process and 
obtaining written consent from the parent(s) or legal guardians(s ) a patient is deem ed to be 
'enrolled into the study'.   
The following assessments will be conducted at these screening visits:  
 Inclusion/exclusion verification . 
 Parental Htc, and patients’ Ht, Ht SDS, HV and HV SDS.  
 Body weight and BMI SDS.  
 Medical history, including a descrip tion of pituitary deficiencies, concomitant and previous 
medications.  
 Overall health status assessment , including  complete physical examination  and vital signs.  
 Pubertal status (according to Tanner stages ).  
                                                 
a Illiterate patients should provide their consent in a method that is accepted according to local regulations.   
b If the patient’s screening process is delayed because of a benign illness or unforeseen benign condition (i.e. 
pharyngitis, viral GI problems , minor accident or trauma, etc.) or other technical issue that is related screening 
procedures (for example, delays with laboratory results)  extra time will be added to the duration of the screenin g 
period, but not in excess of an additional four wks (tot al of 12 wks screening period).  
c It's recommended that parents will be measured at the site. If measured parental Ht is not available an estimate should 
be provided by the parent.  It should also be noted that the patient’s birth date is required for accu rately reporting of Ht 
SDS.

  BAa determination with the method of Greulich -Pyle using a central BA reader.  
 Assessment of biochemical markers and stimulation tests:  
 Two (2) different GH stimulation (provocation) tests  from the following list : ITT 
(with serum cortisol response to hypoglycemia if insulin stimulation test is chosen ); 
arginine test ; clonidine test ; glucagon test ; L-dopa  test.  The minimal duration and 
number of samples must conform to the specifications in Appendix B for each test.  
 
The use of a local laboratory for a ssessment  of GH serum levels (and glucose and serum cortisol if  
the insulin tolerance test is performed) might be acceptable , if done prior to ICF signature , and if 
the results a re reviewed and approved by the  global  study MM  prior to study entry .  
 Assessment  of morning cortisol ( at 8 am ± 1 hour). 
If morning cortisol is below 190  nmol/ L (7 μg/dL), test for adrenal insufficiency will be 
required – Low dose ACTH or CRH  stimulation test (only if the patient was not previously 
assessed for the hypothalamus -pituitary -adrenal axisb or has been diagnosed with adrenal 
insufficiency ).    
 Assessment of biochemical markers: IGF-1, IGF -1 SDS, IGFBP -3 and IGFBP -3 SDS 
serum levels .  
 Assessment  of anti -hGH Ab. 
 Safety laboratory tests: chemistry, hematology, urinalysis . 
 Assessment  of thyroid function : TSH, FT4 .  
 Parameters of glucose metabolism : overnight fasting insulin, overnight fasting glucose and 
HbA1C . 
 Head MRIc, if possible  with contrast or CT scan – recommended to be performed  only after 
the two GH stimulation tests . 
 Assessment of karyotype in girlsd. 
 SHOX gene evaluatione. 
The Global Study MM will review key data and all test results obtained during Screening ; the  
eligibility will be confirmed  by the  Global Study MM prior to randomization  of each patient.  
It is recommended that the Investigator r andomiz e the patient within  7 days of Global Study MM 
confirmation of eligibility  and to bring the patient back in for th e Baseline visit (Visit 2) within 2 
wks of randomization . 
                                                 
a Historical BA assessment might be accepted if they were done with the method of Greulich -Pyle no more than 6 
months prior to the ICF signature date. If the patient is eligible, the BA should be repeated at Visit 2 prior to dos ing. 
The Visit 2 scan will be the Baseline scan for these patients.  
b ITT with serum cortisol response to hypoglycemia is adequate for assessment of adrenal insufficiency and no ACTH 
stimulation test is required if such results are available . 
c Historical MRI or CT is permitted if within 12 months ; MRI or CT which was conducted no more than 12 months 
prior to ICF signature data will be acceptable.  For GHD associated with a congenital CNS defect, the medical monitor 
could allow for use of the his toric MRI or CT > 12 months old.  
d Historical karyotype data and chromosomal microarray data are acceptable .   
e Historical data is acceptable. SHOX gene evaluation is only necessary for isolated GHD  with a normal brain MRI. 
Patients with clear multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies or structurally abnormal pituitary gland do not  require  
SHOX gene evaluation.

After completion of 12 months treatment in the main study and continuing to meet the LT-OLE 
inclusion/exclusion criteria of this protocol , patients will be  eligible to rollover into a single arm 
LT-OLE  treatment period with MOD -4023 . An informed consent /assent  will be obtained from 
patients and /or parent /s or legal/authorized guardian  as required per local regulation .  
Patients who received MOD -4023 during the main study  will continue with the same dose of 
MOD -4023 (mg/kg/wk) , adjusted for body weight . For these patient s, study visits will take place 
every three  months  on Day 4 ( -1) post -dose. These patients will consent to the LT -OLE prefera bly 
during Visit 7 of the main study to ensure availability of MOD -4023 at their next visit.  If 
necessary, informed consent can be obtained at Visit 8  main study /10 LT-OLE . These Patients will 
continue  treatment at Visit 8/10, skip Visit s 9 and  11 and have  a telephone visit at Visit 1 2 (one 
month post LT -OLE entry (Month 13 [±2wk] ). 
Patients who received Genotropin®, during the main study  will be switched to MOD -4023  starting 
no less than one day [+2wk] after cessation of Genotropin® treatment .  Recommended  injection 
days are indicated in Appendix  E.  These patients will consent to the LT -OLE preferably during 
Visit 7 of the main study to ensure availability of MOD -4023 at their next visit. If necessary, 
informed consent can be obtained at Visit 8 /10. Patien ts will begin treatment with MOD -4023 at 
Visit 8/10, skip Visit 9  and have additional onsite visits at Visit 11 (Month 12, Day 10  post first 
MOD -4023 dose [10+4 days ]) and Visit 1 2 (one month (Month 13 post first MOD -4023 dose

5.7 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS AND ENDPOINTS  
5.7.1 Ht and Annual HV 
Ht measurements must be performed according to  Appendix C with a calibrated wall -mounted (e.g. 
Harpenden or similar) stadiometer and should ideally be conducted at the s ame time of the day for 
each visit, preferably in the morning. To ensure consistency of results, ideally the same auxologist 
will perform these measurements for each patient at each visit to minimize the variability of 
measurements. The time of measurement  and the observer’s initials is to be recorded in the eCRF. 
Three (3) independent readings will be recorded for each visit in the eCRF.  
The Ht Standard Deviation  Score  (Ht SDS) will be derived from the age and gender standards from 
2000 Center for Disease Control Growth Charts  (www.cdc.gov/growthcharts ) by the Sponsor  
during the study . 
Annual ized HV will be calculated in cm as the change in Ht from Visit 2 to Visit 8 (after 12 
months of treatment)  during the main study  and again every 12 months thereafter compared to the 
measurement taken 12 months prior  during the LT -OLE . 
5.7.2 BA 
BA will be determined by X -ray according to Greulich -Pyle method (Greulich 1959 ) using central 
BA reader  during the main study at Screening  (Visit 1), Visit 2a, and  Visit 8 (Month  12). X-ray 
films of the left hand and wrist will be taken as outlined in Appendix D and will be sent to a 
qualified central reader. The central reader will be blinded to the CA, drug allocation, and name of 
the patients. X -ray films will hold only an identification number and gender. Details of the central 
BA reader and the procedure for blinding and shipping of X -rays will be provided to the 
investigator . 
During the LT -OLE , BA will be determined by X -ray every 12 months. The central reader will be 
blinded to the CA and name of the patient.  
5.7.3 Biochemical Markers: IGF-1 and IGFBP -3 
hGH stimulates hepatic production and release of IGF-1 into the systemic circulation. IGF actions  
are modulated by a family of 6 structurally -related binding proteins (IGFBPs 1 -6), which bind 
IGFs , but not insulin with high affinity. More than 99% of IGFs bind to IGFBPs. In particular, 
IGFBP -3 is the predominant circulating IGFBP.  
Clinical evaluations  of IGF-1, IGF -1 SDS, IGFBP -3 and IGFBP -3 SDS will be performed at every 
study visit  during the main study  except Visits 3, 6a, 6b, 8a, and 9 . During the LT -OLE, these 
evaluations will be performed as per the schedule of events in Appendix A .   
5.8 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS AND ENDPOINTS  
Safety assessments will be based on changes from baseline of clinical AEs (including local 
tolerability , i.e. injection site reaction ) reported by the patient  or observed by the investigator , 
concomitant medication use, treatment  compliance, vital signs, ECG, physical examination , 
fundoscopy  and laboratory assessments ( hematology , blood chemistry , glucose metabolism , lipid

metabolism, thyroid function, IGF-1 levels, immunogenicity and urinalysis).  AEs and concomitant 
medication us e will be assessed at every visit. Physical examination and safety laboratory 
assessments will be performed according to the schedule of events in Appendix A.   
5.8.1 AEs 
AEs, including  local tolerability  (i.e. injection site reactions ), will be assessed at all study visits 
(excluding Visits 1 and 6b) throughout the study. In addition, patients  will be requested to 
complete a patient diary at home to collect data on AE, concomitant medications  and local 
tolerability . 
Any AEs that occur thr oughout the study will be recorded. Any new AE that occur s between 
scheduled visits should be brought to the attention of the investigator and recorded in the patient ’s 
medical file and on the appropriate eCRF page . AEs should be followed until  resolution or 
stabilization . 
5.8.2 Local  Tolerability  (Injection Site Reactions )  
Assessment of local tolerability will be performed by examining the injection sites (by the 
investigator if a reaction is present at the time of every visit, excluding Visit 1 ) and on the basis of 
anamnestic data and records in the patient diary .  Observations of local injection site reactions will 
be recorded on the appropriate eCRF pages.  
The patients and parents/legal guardians will be trained to record , at least once weekly,  any 
injecti on site reaction in their diaries .  
An abnormal injection site reaction is defined as:  
 Injection site reaction which is reported or  observed at the time of visit  or during a phone 
call and is of moderate to severe in intensity.  
 Injection site reaction betw een the last and present visit or  remaining at the time of visit 
which require medical attention, or i njection site reaction resulting from a previous 
injection, other than the last injection.  
 Any other injection site reaction deemed abnormal to the investigator’s judgment, other 
than those ordinarily observed in subcutaneous injections.  
 Pain score ≥4 (as reported in the patient diary) . 
If an injection site reaction meets the criteria for “abnormal ” defined above,  it will be considered 
and assessed as an AE.  
 Pain: For patients, injection site pain will be evaluated by the investigator or designated 
personnel if the injection is given at the medical center, and by the parent/legal guardian if 
the injection is given at home. The pain will be evaluated at least once weekly using a Pain 
Rating Scale and recorded in the patient diary . In addition, each patient and parent/guardian 
will be queried during study visits regarding possible injection site pain.  
 Pain score ≥4 should be reported as an AE.  
Photographs of Injection Site Reactions  
An optional photograph of an abnormal local injection site reaction may be taken . Photographs 
may be taken by site staff during a visit or by a patient or parent/ caregiver  between study visits in 
which case a copy should be given to study staff at the next study visit.   The photograph, if 
available will be kept signed and dated in the patient medical record.

5.8.3 Concomitant Medication Use  
Use of concomitant medication will be recorded  at all study visits  (excluding visit 6b). 
5.8.4 Treatment Compliance  
Diary cards  will be reviewed  at each visit  for treatment compliance from  previous visits.  
5.8.5 Vital Signs  
Vital signs measurements will be recorded  at all study visits  during the  main study  except Visits 3, 
6a, 6b, 8a and 9 and as per the schedule of events in Appendix A during the LT -OLE .  Vital Signs 
will include body temperature, respiration, blood pressure (BP) and heart rate after the patient  has 
sat quietly for at least 5 minutes.  
5.8.6 Phys ical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be performed at all study visits  during the main study  except 
Visits 3, 6a, 6b, 8a and 9 and as per the schedule of events in Appendix A during the LT -OLE . The 
physical examination will include appearance, eyes, ears, nose, head, throat, neck, chest, lungs, 
heart, abdomen, extremities, skin  and musculoskeletal system.  Weight will be measured as part of 
the physical examination at relevant visits, ideally fas ted in the morning, without shoes and having 
removed all outwear such as jackets, sweaters or sweatshirts and heavy pocket items.  CS findings 
at screening will be reported as medical history and as AEs after the Screening visit.  
5.8.7 ECG  
During the main study , ECG (preferably 12 -lead) will be performed  at Visit 2 (pre-dose),  Visit 6b 
at 7-12 hours post dosing  (MOD -4023 arm) and at Visit 6 for Genotropin® arm (no time 
limitation).  During the LT -OLE, ECG (preferably 12 -lead) will be performed annually every 12 
months until study closure.  
Initially ECG output will be evaluated by the Investigator at time of performance (signed and 
dated) and the printout  (including photocopy) should be kept in the patient’s medical file . When 
potentially CS findings are detected by the investigator, a cardiologist should be consulted for a 
definitive interpretation. All communications and diagnoses should be filed in the patient’s medical 
file. 
The final determination of whether the ECG findings are of CS to the patient  rests with the PI and 
reported as normal /abnormal in the eCRF . 
5.8.8 Fundoscopy   
Fundoscopic evaluations will be conducted only  if there are symptoms of increased intracranial 
pressure  (persisting headache different from typical headache patterns or headache accompanied by 
nausea/vomiting that is not self -limited and/or associated with other symptoms suggestive of 
infectious illness such as fever or myalgias ). 
Fundoscopy  will be performed according to standard of care and  confirmed by an ophthalmology 
evaluati on if necessary .

5.9 MOD -4023  DEVICE USABILITY   
5.9.1 PAT as provided in  Appendix M (USA Only) . 
The PAT will be used to record all the patient’s or caregiver’s injections using MOD -4023 PEN at 
Wks 1,  2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  It will be completed on site at Wk 1 and at home at Wks 2,  3, 4, 5, and 6 
by the actual user of the PEN or parent/legal guardian.  The PAT will be completed for all injection 
attempts at Wks 1,  2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 whether the patient  was able to complete the inj ection or not.  
At Visit 2, prior to MOD -4023 on site injection, patients and caregivers will be trained to use the 
device as outlined in the P atient Dosing Instructions Booklet . In addition , patients and caregivers 
will be trained on the completion of the PAT and instructed the following:  
 
 Protocol for Clinical Study CP -4-006 - USA  
 Page 52 of 127 
Effective Date: Date of final electronic approval  
 
 
Confidential Document  
 In any given wk a new PAT will be completed for each PEN used that wk (in some cases more 
than 1 PEN may be used for full dose administration; in some cases , more than 1 injection 
from the same PEN may be needed, in which case only 1 PAT is completed for that PEN that 
wk). 
 On Visit 4 (Month 1/Wk 4 [ +1 wk]), to bring the completed PATs and confirming proper 
recording  by the study staff . 
 To complete the PAT for ms (including the first injection) post MOD -4023 weekly injections.  
The PAT forms completed after Visit 4 will be collected on Visit 5 (3 months).  
 To return all used injection devices  and PAT forms as defined in the schedule of activities. If 
the PAT form s are not completely and correctly filled in as determined by the PI, up to 4 
additional wks will be added to the PAT assessment time, not to exceed a total of 6 dose 
administrations.  
5.9.2 OAT as provided in Appendix N (USA Only) . 
The OAT will be used to record the observer’s assessment of an administration with the device on 
site during Visit  2 after patient or caregiver injected MOD -4023.  
 A new OAT will be completed for each PEN used (in some cases more than 1 PEN may be 
used for full dose administration, in which case an OAT will be completed for each PEN used;  
in some cases , more than 1 injection from the same PEN may be needed, in which case only 1 
OAT  is completed for that PEN ). 
5.9.3 Assessment of Successful Operation of the MOD -4023 PEN  
All US A MOD -4023 injection devices used during the main study  will be collected and returned to 
the study  site. A subset of returned devices will be examined to provide evidence of appropriate 
device function and robustness.  In addition, any devices which are perceived to malfunction 
(either before or during use) will be returned through a formal complaint s ystem and evaluated to 
understand the root cause of the failure.   
5.10 PUBERTAL  ASSESSMENT   
Patients may enter puberty during the course of the study and contraception might become 
relevant. The puberty state is evaluated on routine basis as described above.  Once a female patient 
reports first menstrual cycle (menarche) study sites should perform urine pregnancy test at every 
visit.  
For a female child, even though she is pre -pubertal at enrollment, it is possible that she may enter 
puberty during the course of  the study and could theoretically become pregnant. As she cannot 
continue in the study if she were to become pregnant, the investigator or delegated study staff  is 
obligated to discuss this issue ahead of time with the patient and her parents /legal guardi an.  
Patients  must  refrain from sexual activity during the study i.e. observe complete sexual abstinence 
as the only acceptable contraceptive measure in this study.  
If a patient were to become pregnant or thinks she may have become pregnant during the stu dy, the 
Investigator  should be informed immediately, such information will be recorded in study 
documentation and the patient will be asked to stop taking the study medication as it may cause 
unforeseen risks to the unborn baby. Serum pregnancy test will b e scheduled immediately in such 
 
 Protocol for Clinical Study CP -4-006 - USA

Confidential Document  
cases, and in the case of the negative result the test should be repeated in two wks to confirm or 
exclude the pregnancy.  
In case of negative test results confirmed by the second negative test result, based on the 
Investiga tor’s recommendation , the Sponsor may allow the patient to return to the full study 
schedule  with guidance from Sponsor , if applicable . or the patient will be offered to remain in the 
study without study medication , but to complete the remaining study procedures as scheduled 
(missed visits are recommended to be realized ).  
All pregnancy tests used in this study, either urine or serum, must have a sensitivity of at least 
25 mIU/mL and must be performed by a certified laboratory.  Pregnancy te sts will also be done 
whenever one  menstrual cycle is missed during treatment (main study and LT -OLE)  and when 
potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected and may be repeated if requested by institutional review 
boards (IRBs)/ethics  committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations.  In the case of a positive 
confirmed pregnancy, the patient  will be withdrawn from administration of investigational product 
but may remain in the study for follow up .  
The pregnancy must be reported t o the Global Study MM, pharmacovi gilance (see section 7.6 ) and 
Sponsor .  A follow -up period on mother and child will be defined based on individual basis and per 
discussion with DSMB.  
Male patients  
The effect of MOD -4023 on sperm is not known.  
The Inves tigator  is obligated to discuss this issue of possible conception ahead of time with male 
patients and his parents /legal guardian . Patients  are requested to refrain from sexual activity during 
the study i.e. observe complete sexual abstinence as the only a cceptable contraceptive measure in 
this study.  
If partner of the male patient becomes pregnant, the Investigator  should be informed immediately. 
The patient doesn’t need stop taking the study medication. The pregnancy will be reported to the  
Global Study MM, pharmacovigilance and S ponsor and follow -up period on mother and child will 
be defined based on individual basis and per discussion with DSMB.  
5.11 QOL QUESTIONNAIRE  
QoL will be measured using the QoLISSY questionnaire which was developed to provide 
clinicians and researchers a validated tool to assess the impact of short stature on children. The 
QoLISSY core questionnaire consists of 22 like -scaled items assigned to the core dimensions: 
Physical, Social, and Emotional.  
For patients below the age of 7  and 0 days a parental QoLISSY core questionnaire  will be 
completed guided by the parent or caregiver. Patients above and including the age of 7 and 0 days 
will be encourage d to complete the child QoLISSY core questionnaire  on its own . Both 
questionnaire s are provided in Appendix L as well as a designated list of countries in which it will 
be completed.  
The QoLISSY core total score is calculated by the sum of the mean s of these 3 dimensions and 
divided by 3. All scores will be transformed from raw scores to 0 to 100 scores, consistent with the 
QoLISSY scoring manual.  Higher values represent a higher QoL.

The QoLISSY will be administered at V isit 2 and at the end of the study V isit 8, i.e. , after 
12 months of treatment  at designated countries (determined by availability of translated tools ) per 
the list in Appendix L. 
6. IP  
6.1 IDENTITY OF IP 
MOD -4023 is a long -acting m odified r-hGH  which utilizes CTP technology.  
MOD -4023 will be provided as a solution for injection  containing 20 or 50 mg/mL MOD -4023 in a 
multi -dose disposable pre-filled PEN .  
The formulation will include citrat e, histidine, sodium chloride , m-cresol, Poloxamer 188 , pH = 
6.6.   
6.2 REFERENCE THERAPY  
Genotropin® is a daily GH, which will be used as the reference therapy  during the main study.  
A delivery device ( Genotropin® Pen) will be used for daily (evening/bedtime) SC administration of 
Genotropin® into the region of the upper arms, buttocks, thighs or abdomen (8 locations). Injection 
sites should be rotated.  
The device is intended to assist self -injecting adult and paed iatric patients, healthcare professionals 
and caregivers with the daily  SC injection of the r-hGH , primarily self-administered at home or in a 
healthcare environment  
Starting dose regimen for Genotropin®: 0.034 mg/kg/d ay (or 0.24 mg/kg/w k divided equally t o 7 
injections over a wk).   Genotropin® will be used and monitored according to the approved product 
labeling and dose adjusted based on weight every 3 months during the main  study.  
6.3 STUDY DRUG ADMINISTRATION  
MOD -4023 will be administered as a SC injection  preferably (but not required) in the morning 
hours once weekly , using the PEN  into the upper arms, buttocks, thighs , or abdomen  (8 locations) . 
It is recommended that all 8 injection sites are used successively, using a different injection site  at 
each subsequent injection.  The same injection site should be used only after all other injection sites 
have been rotated (see recommended rotation scheme below).   
The starting dose for the administration will be  0.66 mg/kg/w k. All patients on Genotropin® that 
complete Visit 8 /10 and continue into the LT -OLE will start treatment with MOD -4023 at 0.66 
mg/kg/wk.

Figure 1: Recommended rotation of injection sites  for Genotropin® and MOD -4023  
If a patient on MOD -4023  treatment  misses a dose for not more than 72 hours (i.e. the dose is ≤ 72 
hours late), then he/she will take a full dose as soon as he/she remembers that an injection was 
missed. Then the patient will go back to taking the study medication on the regular da y of the wk. 
If the dose is more than 72 hours  late, the patient will not take a dose for the whole wk and will  
continue  taking the study m edication on the regular day the following wk.   
The patient should notify site  staff about the delayed  injection  or the missed dose and be instructed 
by the site as for the next visit schedule.  
In case the delayed injection  is in the wk when an on -site visit is planned , the site should confirm 
that the visit date follows  the proper post injection  interval (for example : three to four  days post 
dosing, in case IGF-1 samples should be collected).  If not, the visit date should be rescheduled to 
meet protocol visit dates requirements . In case the injection was missed, the  on-site visit in that wk 
should be rescheduled , to meet the required post dosing  interval . 
If a patient on Genotropin® misses a dose he /she should resume  the medication with the next 
scheduled dose  and should not double any doses.  
In case the prescribe d dose cannot be fully set  for a single injection on a PEN , the patient should be 
instruct ed how to split the dose into 2 injections. The partial dosing can occur in 2 cases:  
1. Two (2) injections using 1 PEN. In case the prescribe d dose is higher than the 
maximum dose which can be se lected according to the PEN amount , the patient should 
be instruct ed to subtract the dose already received from the prescribe d dose and set the 
PEN accordingly.  
For example, if the full prescribed dose is 33. 5 mg and the PEN only allow s the dose 
selector to be set to 30.0 mg, the patient should inject another 3. 5 mg using the same 
PEN.  
2. Split dose between 2 PENs, the current PEN and a new PEN.  This may happen when 
the complete dose cannot be fully administered from the PEN  in use , the pa tient should 
be instruct ed to subtract the dose already delivered  from the prescribe d dose and set the 
new PEN accordingly .

Confidential Document  
For example, if the full prescribed dose is 25.0  mg and the volume left on the current 
PEN only allow s the dose selector to be set t o 20.5 mg, the patient should inject another 
4.5 mg from the new PEN.  
It is recommend ed to encourage the patients to use a calculator to plan the doses and to calculate 
the dose that should be adjusted for the second injection.  
It is very important that fo r the second injection, whether from the same PEN or from a new PEN 
the patient replace s the needle and rotate s the injection site  and complete the patient diary for each 
of the 2 injections administered.  
Further details are provided in the Patient Dosing Instructions Booklet . 
Missing /Delayed  dose should be reported in the patient diary and eCRF . 
6.4 DOSE MODIFICATION PLAN 
The dose of MOD -4023 and Genotropin® (main study ) will be assessed every 3 months based on 
patient’s body weight. Doses will be determined by the IRT system and will include an automatic 
rounding – either up or down – to the closest PEN  increment (0.2 increments in 2 0 mg/ml pens and 
0.5 increments in 50 mg/ml pens).  
Doses may be decreased for safety reasons according to the pre -defined dose -adjustment criteria 
(which will be based on the severity of AEs or repeated, elevated levels of IGF-1 SDS).  
6.4.1 Dose Decrease  
For patients on MOD -4023, the dose will be decreased based on two, repeated day 4 (-1) levels of 
IGF-1 > +2 .0 SDS. For patients on Genotropin®, the dose may be decreased based on repeated 
IGF-1 levels > +2 .0 SDS.  
If a patient has an IGF-1 level > +2.0 SDS, they will be requested to return for an unscheduled visit 
within 4 -6 wks after  the >  +2.0 SDS result, on  day 4 (-1) post dose (for MOD -4023 treated 
patients  or any day  for Genotropin®).  If their IGF-1 level is still > +2.0 SDS, the most recent 
dose will be reduced by 15% (i.e. to 0.56 mg/kg /wk for MOD -4023 ; 29  µg/kg/day for 
Genotropin®). The patient will be treated with the new dose for at least 4 wks before a subsequent 
IGF-1 determination can result in a further dose modification .  If the next scheduled visit is less 
than 4 wks after the dose reduction  was effectuated , the IGF-1 result at that visit must NOT be used  
for additional dose recalculation ). At the time of the next visit (or at an extra, unscheduled visit 
which complies  with the 4 wk minimum time period) , IGF-1 will be retested . If the IGF-1 is still > 
+2.0 SDS, the dos e will be reduced an additional 15 % to  0.48 mg/kg /wk for MOD -4023 and to 
24.7 µg/kg/day for Genotropin® arm. If the IGF-1 is still > +2.0 SDS following 2 dose reductions  
(at least 4 wks after second dose reduction) , the Global Study MM  (with the assistance of the 
DSMB if necessary) will decide on course of treatment on an individual basis.  During the LT -OLE 
dose reduction for IGF -1 level >+2.0 SDS will be made following consultation with the Global 
Study MM on an individual patient basi s.  
If AEs are defined as “severe” AND drug -related , dose reduction will be in troduced upon  
discussion with the G lobal Study MM  and DSMB  - dose should be reduced at a similar manner as 
above in a 2-step approach.

Confidential Document  
Every attempt should be made to maintain the patient on the originally allocated dose if possible.  
In case that the investigator does not plan to decrease  the dose as described in the protocol, the 
Global Study MM  should be notified.  
The key safety data will be reviewed by an independent and external DSMB at least once every 4 
months  during the main study  and approximately every 6 months during the LT -OLE . The DSMB 
will also include review of number or percentage  of patients requiring dose reductions due to IGF-
1 > +2.0 SDS and number or p ercentage of patients whose IGF-1 remains > +2.0 SDS, despite dose 
reductions (in both MOD -4023 and Genotropin® cohorts). DSMB review will also include review 
of number or percentage of  patients requiring dose reductions due to AEs.

6.5 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS  TO TREATMENT GROUPS  
During the main study , eligible patients  will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (centralized 
randomization for each region  as defined in the stratification factors ) to one of two treatment 
groups, MOD -4023 or Genotropin® (reference therapy) for 12 months . 
The following stratification factors will be considered when adding patients to one of the treatment 
groups:  
1. Peak GH levelsa (≤3 ng/mL; >3 to ≤7 ng/mL; and >7 to ≤10a ng/mL) . 
2. CA (≥3 years to  ≤ 7 years, 0 days; and > 7 years, 0 days. ). 
3. Region ( 1. Western Europe, Israel, Australia, New Zealand , Canada  and USA; 2. Central and 
Eastern Europe,  Greece, Turkey,  Latin America  and Asia except for India and Vietnam; 3. 
India  and Vietnam ). 
Randomization will be performed through an IRT. The treatment codes for each patient  will be 
held according to EDC . Shipment, Storage, Dispensing and Return of the IP will be managed 
through the IRT. 
6.6 BLINDING  
In order to minimize any potential sources of bias in this open -label study, certain identified roles 
will remain blinded to the treatment assignments (and to any other treatment -identifying 
information), during the main study .  Details on the blinding pro cedures used will be provided in 
the Data Management Plan ( DMP ).   
6.7 ACCOUNTABILITY AND COMPLIANCE OF IP 
The IP will be packed and shipped at 2 -8°C in appropriate boxes with temperature loggers. If, upon 
arrival at the study site, study drug supplies appear to be damaged or temperature control does not 
appear to have been maintained, the study monitor and drug supplier should be contacted 
immediately.  
The investigator or study pharmacist should refer to the Pharmacy Manual for instructions on how 
to acknowle dge receipt of all shipments of study drug and ancillary supplies, how to keep record of 
how much study drug was returned used and unused by each patient.  
All IP must be kept refrigerated (2 -8°C) in a locked area with access to the study drug limited to 
designated study personnel. Only personnel under the supervision of either the investigator or 
investigator  trained and certified team member or  the local pharmaci st are authorized to dispense 
and administer study drug.  
The investigator must maintain complete and adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, 
or other disposition of the IP supplies.   All IP will be accounted for using a drug accountability 
form/record  either on paper or electronically . The investigator is responsible that all IP 
accountability records are accurate and available for review by the study monitor , Sponsor  or 
designee  or the rele vant regulatory authority.  
                                                 
a Proportion of patients with peak GH levels >7 to ≤10 ng/mL , will be capped at 35 -40% of total sample -size, in the 
random ization scheme.

Confidential Document  
All used and unused study drugs (PEN s) will be assessed for accountability by the study monitor  as 
detailed in the study monitoring plan . Interim accountability and destruction may also be 
performed during the study, following Sponsor ’s written approval.  
6.8 DESTRUCTION OF IP AND OTHER SUPPLIES  
The Sponsor  or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of  used and  unused IP, used and  
unused ancillaries  and expire d laboratory  kits. If destruction is authorized to take place at the 
Investigator ’s site, the Investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with 
applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by 
the Spons or. All destruction must be approved in advance in writing by the Sponsor and adequately 
documented.  
6.9 PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
6.9.1 General Guidelines  
All prior treatments received by the patient  within 30 days of the initial Screening visit will be  
recorded on the patient ’s eCRF including the treatment's name , indication  and the start and stop 
dates.   
Any medications (including prescription, over -the-counter, herbal and food supplements and health 
store products) to be taken during the study must be  approved by the Investigator.  
All approved concomitant medications taken by the patient  must be recorded on the eCRF, along 
with the  indication and  start and stop dates , dose and dose frequency.   
6.9.2 Disallowed Previous Medications/Therapies  
The following medications are not permitted prior to the Screening visit:  
 Any r -hGH therapy . 
 Systemic corticosteroids other than in replacement doses within the 3 months before 
ICF signing (temporary adjustment of glucocorticoids, as appropriate, is accept able) . 
 Anabolic steroids other than gonadal steroid replacement therapy within 2 months 
before study entry . 
 Use of IP (within 30 days  of ICF signing ). 
6.9.3 Allowed Medications  
The only concomitant medications allowed to be used in this study are those used at Baseline to 
control existing medical condition and/or those taken during the study to treat AEs. All 
concomitant medications used to treat AEs will be recorded in the patient ’s medical file and on the 
appropriate eCRF page .  
Careful monitoring is advisable when MOD -4023 is administered in combination with other drugs 
known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes. However, formal drug interaction studies 
have not been conducted . In patients with diabetes mellitus requiring drug therapy, the dose of 
insulin and/or oral/injectable agent may require adjustment when MOD -4023 treatment  is initiated.

6.9.4 Prohibited Concomitant Medication  
The following medications are not permitted during the study and may lead to withdrawal of the 
patient  from the study:  
 Any hormonally active medication other than replacement therapy for pituitary failure.  
Glucocorticoid replacement dosing should be carefully adjusted in children receiving 
MOD -4023 and Genotropin® and glucocorticoid treatments to avoid both 
hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth.  
 Any new long -term glucocorticoid treatment should be noted on the concomitant 
medication form and the patient should be retained in the safety population, but not the 
per-protocol population. Short term glucocorticoid treatm ent is allowed.   
 Anabolic steroids (including  testosterone replacement therapy ) should not be taken.  
 Weight loss drugs . 
 Psychiatric  medications  typically associated with weight changes and/or diabetes  
excluding medications used to treat ADHD . 
7. SAFETY AND PHARMACOVIGILANCE  
7.1 ADVERSE EVENT  
An AE is any adverse change from the patient  baseline condition, whether or not considered IP 
related. This includes any subjective signs, symptoms or diagnosis, clinical significant deviation  
from baseline laboratory values  or vital signs, or worsening (more severe, more frequent or 
increased in duration during the IP treatment) of the concomitant disease present at baseline visit 
(after initiation of IP treatment). Stable chronic conditions that are present prior to study e ntry and 
do not worsen during the study will not be considered AEs. Disease -related AEs will be considered  
AEs only if they worsen beyond what would be expected in the normal progression of the disease. 
In all cases, the etiology  should, as much as possibl e, be identified and the Sponsor notified.  
An abnormal result of diagnostic procedures including abnormal laboratory or vital sign findings 
will be considered an AE if it:  
 Results in patient ’s withdrawal by the investigator , 
 Is associated with clinical sig ns or symptoms , 
 Is considered by the physician to be of CS. 
AEs reported by the patient  or observed by the Investigator  will be individually listed on an AE 
form in the eCRF as follows: the specific event or condition, whether the event was present pre -
study, the dates and times of occurrence, duration, severity, relationship to study medication, 
specific counter  measures  and outcome.  
The intensity or severity of the AE will be characterized as:  
 Mild: Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required.  
 Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity - some assistance may be needed; no 
or minimal medical intervention/therapy required.  
 Severe:   Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually requ ired; medical 
intervention/therapy required ; hospitalization possible.

Confidential Document  
Significant medical events  are those which may not be immediately life -threatening, but may 
jeopardize the patient  and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes 
listed abov e. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; 
resulting in an AE will normally be considered serious by this criterion.  
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization means that hospital inpatient 
admission and/or prolongation of hospital stay were required for treatment of AE, or that they 
occurred as a consequence of the event.  
Any new SAE that occu rs after the study period and is considered to be related (possibly/probably) 
to the IP or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately . 
A life-threatening  adverse drug experience is any AE that places the patient , in the view of the 
investigator , at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a 
reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
7.3 DEFINITION OF AN UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENT  
An unexpected  adverse drug experi ence (event) is any AE, the specificity or severity of which is 
not consistent with information in the current IB for an unapproved IP or package insert/summary 
of product characteristics for an approved product  (package inserts are available separately at  the 
participating center ). 
7.4 DEFINITION OF SUSPECT ED UNEXPECTED SERIOU S ADVERSE REACTION (SUSAR)  
A SUSAR is a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction. An Adverse Reaction is defined 
as any AE caused by a drug. A suspected adverse reaction is defined a s an AE for which there is 
reasonable possibility  that the drug caused the AE. The "reasonable possibility" means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. Any unexpected SAE that 
may be related to study drug is a  SUSAR; however, unexpected SAEs that occur following 
treatment with a placebo solution usually does not qualify as a SUSAR. Because knowledge of 
treatment assignment  during the main study  is needed to complete the determination, the Sponsor's 
designee wil l provide the final determination as to whether an SAE is a SUSAR.  During the LT -
OLE the Sponsor will provide the final determination as to whether an SAE is a SUSAR.  
7.5 NOTIFICATION ABOUT SERIOUS OR UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.5.1 Initial Notification  
Each SAE m ust be reported by the Investigator to the Safety group immediately (within 24 hours) 
upon learning of its occurrence, even if it is not felt to be treatment -related. Follow -up information 
about a previously reported SAE must also be reported within 24 hours of the investigator 
receiving it. If the SAE is unexpected and is thought to be possibly related to the study drug, a 
Clinical Safety Associate shall urgently request further information from the investigator. This is 
essential for collecting informa tion to report to the competent regulatory authority (RA).  
7.5.2 Contact Persons and Numbers:  
All SAE forms should be electronically sent via EDC both to the Global Study MM  and to the 
global pharmacovigilance group . An appropriate distribution list is maintaine d within the EDC for 
reporting purposes.

Follow -Up of SAEs  / SUSARs  
Follow -up of SAEs / SUSARs that occur during the study will continue until their satisfactory 
resolution or stabilization.  
If supplementary information becomes available, a follow -up SAE Report For m must be completed 
by the site based on EDC syst em and emailed  within 24 hours to Safety group . 
The contact information for follow up SAE reporting is the same as for initial SAE reports (see 
above section).  
The SAE form and accompanying documentation should be placed in the SAE section of the 
Investig ator’s file  and/or patient medical file . If supplementary information on a SAE has to be 
sent, the SAE form to be used  must be  marked as “follow -up report”.  
Follow -Up Reports on Non-Serious AE 
All AEs must be followed until resolution or stabilization. In exceptional cases, it may be defined 
as “ongoing without further follow -up” by the Investigator and Sponsor’s decision . 
7.6 REPORTING OF PREGNANCIES OCCURRING DURING THE STUDY  
Following administration of IP, pregnancy cases in any female patient (as well as in  female 
partners of male patients) will be reported , if known , until the patient completes or withdraws from 
the study. The pregnancy will be reported immediately by phone and by faxing/emailing a 
completed Pregnancy Report to the Sponsor (or designee) wit hin 24 hours of knowledge of the 
event. The pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; however, the Investigator will follow the 
patient until completion of the pregnancy and must assess the outcome in the shortest possible 
time, but not more than, 30 days  after completion of the pregnancy. The Investigator should notify 
the Sponsor (or designee) of the pregnancy outcome by submitting a follow -up Pregnancy Report.   
Dosing in the study should be stopped upon immediate notification of the pregnancy.

Confidential Document  
If the ou tcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification of an SAE (e.g., 
spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted foetus is to be 
documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator will report the 
event by phone and by faxing /emailing  a completed SAE Form to the Sponsor (or designee) within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event, as outlined above.  
7.7  INDEPENDENT DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING BOARD (DSMB)  
An independent and exter nal DSMB  will be established  for the study,  to periodically review the 
safety information generated during the conduct of the study  and is allowed to request efficacy data 
if considered necessary for benefit/risk assessment . The primary responsibility of t he DSMB is to 
provide guidance to the Sponsor  regarding the safe conduct of the study based on their periodic 
review of  safety data. The DSMB will review study safety summaries  reported.  
The DSMB’s membership, full scope of responsibilities, operating pro cedures, data availability  
and reporting and record keeping requirements will be established by Sponsor  and/or its 
representative.  DSMB working procedures will be described in a DSMB Charter prior to enrolling 
the first patient .  
The key safety data will be reviewed by an independent DSMB  in approximately once every 4 
months  during the main study  and approximately every 6 months during the LT -OLE . DSMB will 
also include review of number or percentage of patients requiring dose reductions due to IGF-1 > 
+2.0 SDS and number or percentage of patients whose IGF-1 remains above +2 .0 SDS, despite 
dose reductions (in both MOD -4023 and Genotropin® cohorts). DSMB will also include review of 
number or percentage  of patients requiring dose reductions due to AEs.  
7.8 MEDICATION ERRORS  
Medication errors may result from the administration or consumption of the IP by the wrong 
patient , or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.  
Medication errors include:  
 Medication errors involving patient  exposure to the IP; 
 Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or do not 
involve the participating patient . 
Such medication errors occurring to a patient  is to be captured in the EDC system . 
7.9 MEDICAL DEVICE COMPLAINT REPORTING REQU IREMENTS  
All medical device complaints, regardless of whether the medical device complaint is associated 
with an AE, will be reported to the Sponsor on a designated form  through a formal complaint 
system .  Complaints may include incidents, potential incide nts, and/or queries by clinical study 
patients  and or clinical study site personnel on the function or use of the PEN or the drug product 
within the PEN.   An incident or malfunction  of the PEN  is an event that might have led to death or 
serious deteriorati on in health, or if it occurred again might lead to death or serious deterioration in 
health.  
Sponsor  is to be notified of all medical device complaints within 24 hours of the Investigator’s 
awareness of the event.

8. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS METHOD  
8.1 SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATION  
The aim of the main study is to demonstrate that weekly MOD -4023 is not inferior to daily r -hGH 
administration. Non -inferiority will be claimed if the 2-sided 95% CI for mean treatment difference 
(MOD -4023 ─ Genotropin®) in the primary effica cy endpoint will lie entirely above  “non -
inferiority margin” of -1.8 cm/year.  
The following assumptions were made in the sample size calculation:  
 2-sided alpha of 0.05 . 
 80 % power . 
 Between -patient SD of annual growth rate is 2.5 cm/year in all treatment groups . 
 Non-inferiority margin is  -1.8 cm/year .  
 The true mean treatment difference (MOD -4023  – Genotropin®) is -0.8 cm/year.  
With these assumptions, 100 patients  per group will provide 80  % power for the non -inferiority 
test. To allow for an approximate 10  % dropout rate, 110 patients will be randomized to each 
treatment group ( Total N= 220 patients).  
8.2 ANALYZED POPULATION SETS 
Five (5) analysis sets will be used for this study: Safety Analysis Set, Full Analysis Set, Full 
Analysis Subset (FAS), modified intent -to-treat ( mITT  )Set, and the per Protocol ( PP) Set. 
8.2.1 Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set will include all patients who have received at least one dose of study 
treatment.   Patients  will be analyzed according to actual treatment received.  
8.2.2 Full Analysis Set  
The full analysis set will include all patients  randomized and will be the primary efficacy analysis 
set. Patients  will be analyzed according to randomized treatment group.  
If stud y enrollment is closed prior to subject full qualification and/or study closure for any other 
reason by the Sponsor and/or patients  lost to follow up between Visit 1 and Visit 2, the patient will 
be excluded from the study.  
8.2.3 Modified Intent -to-Treat Set  
The mITT set will include all patients  who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least 
one post-baseline assessment of Ht. Patients  will be analyzed according to randomized treatment 
group.  
8.2.4 Per Protocol Set  
The PP set will consist of all randomi zed patients  who did not have any major protocol deviations .  
The patients  who have any major protocol deviations will be identified before database lock by the 
clinical team in a blinded review .

8.2.5 Full Analysis S ubset 
The term “full analysis subset” is used to describe the analysis set which is as complete as possible 
and as close as possible to the intention -to-treat (ITT) ideal of including all enrolled patients.  
The full analysis set will comprise all  treated  patien ts who have received at least one dose of active 
treatment and who provide any follow -up data. The patients will be grouped by their original 
treatment in the treatment period.   
8.3 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA 
The method for handling missing data will be describ ed in the SAP. The primary method of 
imputation will be with multiple imputation assuming missing at random, using SAS PROC MI.  
Details on all sensitivity analyses related to the handling of missing data will also be provided in 
the SAP.

8.5 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
The main study database will be cleaned and locked for analysis after the last patient  complete s 12 
months treatment.   
The assessment of safety  during the LT -OLE will be based on descriptive statistics and 
summarized by patient’s treatment in the treatment period, and overall . No hypothesis testing will 
be performed. The descriptive statistics will include means, standard deviations, quartiles/ra nges 
for continuous variables, and counts with percentages for categorical data. 95% CI will be used to 
further describe the clinical /auxological and biochemical  endpoints.  
The Sponsor reserves the right to stop enrollment when  the targeted number of randomized patients 
is reached.   If this situation arises, non -randomized patients that are undergoing Screening will be 
considered a Screen Failure.  
Details of applicable statistical methods for the main study and LT -OLE will be provid ed in two 
separate  SAPs prior to database lock  of the main study and final study closure of the LT -OLE .  
8.6 EFFICACY ANALYSIS  
The aim of the present study is to demonstrate that in terms of the primary efficacy endpoint, 
Annual ized HV at 12 months, weekly MOD -4023 is non -inferior to daily Genotropin® by a 
non-inferiority margin of 1.8 cm/year .  
With µ M and µ C representing the mean annual HV for the MOD -4023 and the Genotropin® 
(Control) group, respectively, the following hypotheses will be tested:  
Null hypothesis H0: µM < µ C -1.8 cm/year ;  
vs. 
Alternate  hypothesis  H1: µM ≥ µC -1.8 cm/year  
Non-inferiority  will be concluded  if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95  % CI for the mean treatment 
difference “MOD -4023  – Genotropin®”, in the primary efficacy end point  is ≥ -1.8 cm/year .  
The CI for the difference of means between the 2 treatments will be derived from an analysis using 
ANCOVA.  The ANCOVA model will include classification terms for treatment, age group, 
gender, peak hGH levels , and region .  The model will also include Baseline H t SDS as a covariate.  
The determination of non -inferiority will be based on least squares means for the 2 treatments from 
the ANOCVA and the 95  % CI of the differences between the treatments.  
 
 Protocol for Clinical Study CP -4-006 - USA

Confidential Document  
Descriptive statistics will be reported for observed and change from Baseline to annual HV values 
at 12 months  during the main study  and every 12 months thereafter .  
ANCOVA -based statistics will be reported by the categorical terms used in the ANCOVA model : 
age group, gender, peak GH levels, and region . 
8.6.1 Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
A similar ANCOVA model as used for the primary endpoint will be used to analyze:  
 annualized HV at 6 months ;  
 change in Ht SDS at 6 months ; 
 change in Ht SDS at 12 months . 
Least square mean estimates for the 2 treatments and the 95  % CI of the difference between the 
treatments will be presented.  
Descriptive statistics will also be reported for each of these endpoints.  
Descriptive statistics (including univariate 95  % CI) will be r eported for BM observed and change 
from Baseline to 12 months.   
Descriptive statistics will be reported for HV and Ht SDS at each visit.  
Series plots of mean values +/ - SE will be reported for HV and Ht SDS by visit and treatment.  
ANCOVA -based statistics will be reported by the categorical terms used in the ANCOVA model: 
age group, gender, peak GH levels, and region.  
8.6.2 Primary Effi cacy Sensitivity Analysis  
The ANCOVA -based primary efficacy analysis will be repeated using the mITT set and the PP 
set.  
The ANC OVA -based primary efficacy analysis will be repeated on the full analysis set using last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) in place of multiple imputation s for the handling of missing 
data.  
8.6.3 Biochemical Markers Analysis  
Descriptive statistics will be repor ted for observed and change from B aseline for all biochemical 
endpoints at each visit.   
The number and percent of patients  who achieved IGF -1 normalization (defined as IGF -1 SDS 
between -0.5 and 1.5, inclusive) will be summarized. The number and percent of patients  who had 
IGF-1 SDS > 2 .0 will be summarized at each visit.  
8.6.4 Additional  Endpoints  Analysis  
OAT and PAT  (USA Patient s Only)  
OAT and PAT results will be summarized by using descriptive statistics.  
The number and percentage of successful single injections for PAT will be summarized overall. A 
successful single injection for PAT will be based on the questions “Did the dos e window show ‘0’ 
when you finished your injection?” and “Do you believe that a full dose was injected?” The single

injection is considered successful if the subject answers “Yes” to both questions for all attempts on 
the form. A subject can have multiple successful single injections at one visit.  
Intermittent missing observations for the PAT will be imputed as a failure if both the prior and 
subsequent observations are a failure. Otherwise, intermittent missing observations will be imputed 
as a success.  
The number and percentage of successful single injections for OAT will be summarized overall. A 
successful single injection for OAT will be based on the question “…did the user successfully 
inject into an acceptable injection site without physical assistance ?” The single injection is 
considered successful if the observer answers “Yes” to the question for all attempts on the form. A 
subject can have multiple successful single injections at 1 visit.  
The number and percentage of successful single injections for PAT and OAT will also be 
summarized by age group, sex, and race.   
The number and percentage of the number of attempts required to achieve a success will be 
summarized for PAT and OAT.  
Comments on the PAT and OAT related to successful or unsuccessful inject ion attempts will be 
listed.   
Information gained by inspection of returned devices will be listed.   
Quality of Life Questionnaire  
The 3 dimensions (physical, social, and emotional) of the QoLISSY questionnaire will be 
calculated individually and as a comb ined core total score based on the QoLISSY scoring manual. 
This core score is calculated as the sum of the means of these 3 dimensions and divided by 3. All 
scores will be transformed from raw scores to 0 to 100 scores.  
8.6.5 LT-OLE  Analysis  
During the LT -OLE the primary goal of this safety and efficacy analysis is to report on the effect of 
long-term treatment on Annual HV and other auxological /clinical and biochemical  measures.  
 Annual HV will be summarized with descriptive statistics each y ear of LT -OLE treatment. 
For patients who discontinue without annual measurement, their HV will be calculated 
based on their last available measure.  
 Change in Ht SDS every 12 months (the last value within each year compare to the value 
12 months earlier) will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  
 Change in bone maturation (BM) every  12 months, (compared to Week 52 BA (calculated 
as BA/CA) at comp letion of LT -OLE year 1 and to previous values from LT -OLE year 2 
onwards).  
 IGF-1, IGF -1 SDS,  IGFBP -3 and IGFBP -3 SDS will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics at each visit.  A summary of the incidence of IGF -1 SDS >2.0 at each visit will be 
provided .

8.6.6 Safety Analysis  
The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of treatment emergent AEs and on 
the number of laboratory values that fall outside of pre -determined ranges. Data of all safety 
endpoints will be listed and tabulated.  
LT-OLE: 
The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of treatment emergent AEs and on 
the num ber of laboratory values that fall outside of pre -determined ranges. Each of the listed safety 
endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistic s for each year and overall.  Data of all 
safety endpoints will be listed .  
8.6.7 Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded with Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
For analysis purposes, all AEs will be classified to the appropriate MedDRA preferred t erm (PT) 
and system organ class (SOC). For each patient , multiple events that map to the same PT will only 
be counted once for the PT, and multiple PTs within an SOC will only be counted as 1 occurrence 
for that SOC to assess patient  incidence of events by  PT and SOC. The count and percentage of 
patients  with each PT and SOC will be summarized for each treatment group.  
Relationship and severity of AEs will be summarized ( patient  count, % of patients ) for each 
treatment group. For these summaries, multiple occurrences of an event within a patient  will be 
classified as a single observation with the strongest relationship and maximum severity ratings. In 
addition, frequency tables of all reported events  with each associated relationship and severity will 
be presented.  
SAEs will be classified as SAEs by the investigator and will be summarized by treatment group, 
PT and SOC, as well as total patients  exposed.  
8.6.8 Clinical Laboratory Findings  
Any CS laborator y data will be reported as an AE. Laboratory data will be reported by analyte for 
each treatment group. There will not be any hypothesis testing. The laboratory results will be 
presented at each visit along with the raw change from Baseline for quantitativ e data. 
Presence/absence or normal/abnormal results will be summarized as count and percentage. In 
addition, shift tables summarizing changes from normal to out -of-normal range will be provided.  
Descriptive statistics (the number and percentage of patients ) of patients with the presence of anti -
r-hGH and anti -MOD -4023 Abs will be summarized.  
8.6.9 Vital Signs , Fundoscopy and ECG  
Any CS findings will be reported as an AE. The summary of abnormal findings at each visit will be 
displayed by treatment group.  Descri ptive statistics of vital signs will be calculated at each 
scheduled visit and will include the raw change from Baseline.

9. ETHICS  
9.1 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD OR INDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMITTEE  
Prior to initiation of the study, the P I will submit the study protocol  and amendments , sample ICF 
and any other documents that may be requested to the IRB/IEC for review and approval. The 
Investigator  will request that the IRB/IEC provide written approval of the study and will keep on 
file records of approval of all documents pertaining to this study.  The Investigator  will not begin 
the study until the protocol and ICF h ave been approved by the IRB/ IEC. The Investigator  must 
agree to make any required progress reports to the IRB, as well as reports of SAEs, life -threatening 
conditions , or death.  
9.2 ETHICAL CONDUCT OF THE STUDY  
All clinical work conducted under this pro tocol is subject to GCP guidelines . This includes an 
inspection by Sponsor  or its designee, health authority or IRB /IEC  representatives at any time.  The 
Investigator  must agree to the inspection of study -related records by health authority 
representatives and/or Sponsor  or its designee.  
The s tudy will be conducted in accordance with Sponsor’s  standards  operating procedures  (SOPs) 
and the following guidelines:  
 GCP: International Council for  Harmonization (ICH): Integrated Addendum to ICH E6 
(R1): Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 (R2), 09  November 2016 . 
 Declaration of Helsinki: Brazil , 2013 (Appendix G). 
 Local country guidelines for conducting clinical studies.  
9.3 PROTOCOL REVISIONS AND /OR DEVIATIONS  
Changes to the protocol may be made only by the Sponsor (with or without consultation with the  
investigator ). All protocol modifications must be submitted to the IRB/IEC  in accordance with 
local requirements and, if required, to RAs, either as an amendment or a notification. Approval for 
amendments must be awaited before any changes can be implemen ted, except for changes 
necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study  patients , or when the changes involve only 
logistical or administrative aspects of the study . No approval will be  required for notifications.  
9.4 PATIENT  INFORMATION AND CONSENT  
Prior to screening for the study each patient  and parent (s)/legal guardian will be informed in detail 
about the study drugs to be administered  and the nature of the clinical investigation with its risks 
and discomforts to be expected. The basic elements of informed consent as specified by the FDA 
(21 CFR 50.25) and ICH -GCP will be followed .a Written consent will be obtained from each 
patient  to be i nvolved in the clinical study  by using the IRB/IEC -approved ICF prior to the conduct 
of any study -related activity . Each patient  will be given a copy of the written ICF. The patients  will 
also be instructed that they are free to withdraw their consent and discontinue their participation in 
the study at any time without prejudice. Each patient ’s chart will include the signed ICF for study 
                                                 
a Illiterate patients should provide their consent in a method that is accepted according to local regulations.

participation. When the study treatment is completed and the eCRF has been monitored, the ICF 
will be kept in the Investi gator’s Site File for the required period of time . RAs may check the 
existence of the signed ICF in this central study folder if not having done so during the study.   
Children and adolescents are legally unable to provide informed consent to participate in  clinical 
studies. Informed consent must be obtained instead from the legally acceptable representative of 
the child or adolescent, usually their parent(s) or legal guardian.  However, children and adolescents 
should be involved in health -care decisions aff ecting them. To that end, ICH guidelines, EMA 
Guideline on the Ethics of Clinical Trials in Children and FDA regulations require that the assent 
from the child or adolescent be obtained when this is appropriate and when the potential patient  is 
capable of providing assent. The determination of appropriateness and capacity of children in the 
study to provide assent is made by the relevant IRB/EC, though it may be left to the investigator to 
assess whether assent is actually obtainable from children of a youn g age, such as preschool -aged 
children.   
Assent may not be required if, consistent with local law and regulatory requirements, the IRB/EC 
determines that the intervention or procedure involved in the research holds out a prospect of direct 
benefit that is  important to the health or well -being of the potential patients  and is available only in 
the context of the research.   Even where the IRB/EC determines that patients  are capable of 
assenting, the IRB/EC may still waive the assent requirement under special  circumstances.  Where 
parental permission is to be obtained, the IRB/EC may find that permission of 1 parent is sufficient 
if consistent with local law and regulatory requirements.  For clinical investigations involving 
greater than minimal risk, permissi on is generally required from both parents unless only 1 parent 
has legal custody, or one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably available.  
9.5 PATIENT  INSURANCE  
The Sponsor  has an insurance policy for the total duration of the study cover ing the patients  and 
Investigator s in respect to the risks involved in conducting this study according to this protocol.  
The insurance policy will be filed in the Investigator 's Site F ile and can be made available to the 
Investigator and to the IRB /IEC  upon request . 
9.6 INFORMING THE GENERAL PRAC TITIONER  
The Investigator will inform the patient 's primary care  physician of his/her participation in the 
study  annually , by sending a letter  or email to the physician if required by the local  authorities . 
9.7 PERSONAL  DATA PROTECTION  
The Sponsor  complies  with a patient 's right to protection against invasion of privacy.  Throughout 
this study , all data will be identified only by an identification number , date of birth and patient  
initials  (where /if applicable).  
The personal data will be  blinded  in all data analyses. The patient  must be informed and consent is 
required that authorized  personnel of the Sponsor  and/or designee  (Study Monitor, Auditor, 
strategic partners  etc.) and relevant health RA will have direct acce ss to personal medical data to 
assure a high -quality standard of the study.   
10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
The Sponsor  and designated clinical research organization s (CRO ) maintain a quality assurance 
system with written SOPs to ensure that clinical studies  are conducted,  and data are generated,

requirements .  
10.1 AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS  
The Investigator  should understand that source documents for this study  should be made available 
to appropriately qualified personnel from the Sponsor Quality Assurance or its designees or to RA 
inspectors after appropriate notification. The verification of the eCRF  data must be by direct 
inspection of source documents. These audits or inspections may take place at any time, during or 
after the study  and are based on the national regulations, as well as ICH guidelines.  
10.2 STUDY MONITORING  
Monitoring of the study is  the responsibility of the Sponsor and may be delegated to a CRO or a 
contract monitor. The study monitor will advise the Investigator regarding the practical conduct of 
the study and maintaining compliance with the protocol, GCP and all applicable regulat ory 
requirements. Prior to Screening, the study monitor will evaluate the site’s source documents to 
ensure thorough, accurate and compliant source worksheets/systems are available for study 
reporting. Throughout the course of the study, the study monitor will oversee the conduct and the 
progress of the study by frequent contacts with the Investigator. This will include telephone calls, 
remote monitoring via the EDC and on -site visits. During the on -site visits, the eCRF will be 
reviewed for completeness wi th corresponding source documents. As part of the data audit, source 
documents will be made available for review by the study monitor. The study monitor will also 
perform drug accountability checks and may periodically request review of the Investigator’s Site 
File to ensure completeness of documentation in all respects of clinical study conduct.  
Upon completion of the study, the study monitor will arrange for a final review of the study files 
after which the files should be secured for the appropriate tim e period. The Investigator or 
appointed delegate will receive the study monitor during these on -site visits, cooperate in providing 
the documents for inspection and respond to inquiries.  
10.2.1  Source Document  
The Investigator will permit study -related monitorin g, audits by or on behalf of the Sponsor, 
IRB/IEC review and regulatory inspections providing direct access to source data documents. 
Source documents are original records in which raw data are first recorded. These may be 
office/clinic/hospital records, c harts, diaries, x -rays and laboratory results, printouts, pharmacy 
records, care records, completed scales for each study participant. Source documents should be 
kept in a secure and limited access area. All source documents must be accurate, clear, 
unambi guous, permanent and capable of being audited. They should be made using a permanent 
form of recording (ink, typing, printing, optical disc etc.). They should not be obscured by 
correcting fluid or have temporary attachments (such as removable self -stick n otes). Source 
documents that are computer generated and stored electronically must be printed, signed and dated 
by the Investigator.  
Source data for patients  registered to the study should indicate date informed consent /assent  was 
signed, participation in clinical protocol number and title, treatment number, evidence that 
inclusion/exclusion criteria have been met.

10.2.2  Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF)  
An eCRF will be used to store and transmit patient  information. The file struct ure and format for 
the eCRF will be provided by the Sponsor or their representative and should be handled in 
accordance with the instructions provided.  
The eCRF must be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the Investigator.  
Access to the eCRF wi ll be strictly password protected and limited to personnel directly 
participating in the study. Data should be entered into the eCRF completely by treating personnel 
or the study coordinator. The eCRF must be completed as soon as possible after any patient  
evaluation or communication. If data is to be changed due to erroneous input or other reason, an 
electronic audit trail will track these changes. The eCRFs and computers that store them must be 
accessible to Study Monitors and other regulatory auditors.  
10.3 QUALITY LABORATORY STANDARDS

APPENDIX B: GROWTH HORMONE STIMULATION TESTS  
As stated  in the 2000 Growth Hormone Research Society Consensus Guideline: “In a child 
with clinical criteria for GHD, a peak GH concentration less than 10 ng/ mL has 
traditionally been used to support the diagnosis . At the present  time, a new GH reference 
standa rd is being introduced that may require a downward adjustment of the lower limit of 
normal” (Growth Hormone Research Society Consensus Guidelines for the Diagnosis and 
Treatment of Growth Hormone (GH) Deficiency in Childhood  and Adolescence (2000))a. 
The new standard is currently used in the USA and European Union ( EU). However, the 
common clinical practice remains to treat patients with GH ≤ 10 ng/m L. The cutoff for this 
study is in line with this common clinical practice.  
The following GH stimulation tests are recommended , but the final decision regarding 
which test will be performed will be made by the investigator.  
ITT 
Regular  human insulin (0.075 -0.15 IU/kg) will be administered intravenously (iv) at time 
point 0. The test will be interpretable if the blood glucose level decreases below 40 mg/dL. 
Administration of oral dextrose, sugar containing juice, o r iv dextrose will be a llowed if the 
patient develops severe signs of hypoglycemia. ITT is contraindicated in patients with a 
history of seizures or coronary artery disease.  
Blood  will be collected at the following intervals: t  = 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min (6 
sampling  points)  for glucose, hGH and cortisol determination. Additional samples  may be 
obtained during hypoglycemia at the discretion of the investigator.  
A normal  ACTH reserve is defined as a baseline cortisol level above 190 nmol/ L (7 μg/dL) or 
an increase in peak cortisol level above 500 nmol/ L (18 μg/dL).  
Clonidine test  
After fasting  overnight, clonidine (up to 0.15  mg/m2 body surface, given orally) will be given 
at time (t) = 0, and venous blood will be obtained by an indwelling catheter inserted in a 
cubital vei n and kept patent by slow infusion of isotonic saline  or with saline flush, heparin 
lock if necessary.  Blood will be collected at the following intervals: t  = 0, 30, 60, 90,  120 and 
150 min ( 6 sampling points) for hGH measurement. Caution should be exercis ed when 
performing this test, however, as clonidine causes side effects such as tiredness and decreased 
BP. Thus, BP must be monitored prior to, and up to 30  min after normalization. If BP drops 
to 20% below baseline, start a normal saline bolus over 1 hou r and monitor BP every 15 
minutes.  
Arginine  test 
Soluble  10% arginine hydrochloride (0.5  g/kg) will be given iv from t  = 0 to t  = 30 min after 
an overnight fast. Blood samples will be obtained by an indwelling catheter inserted in a 
cubital vein and kept patent by slow infusion of isotonic saline. Blood will be  collected at the

following intervals: t  = 0, 30, 45, 60  and 90, 120 min ( 6 sampling points) for hGH 
measurement.  
Glucagon  test 
After fasting  overnight, glucagon (0.03 mg/kg with a maximal total dose of 1 mg) will be 
given i.m. or s.c. at time t  = 0, and venous blood will be obtained by an indwelling catheter 
inserted in a cubital vein and kept patent by slow infusion of isotonic saline. Blood will be 
collected for hGH measurement at 0, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min relative to the time of 
glucagon administ ration.  
Glucagon  test is not recommended for assessing the cortisol status. However, a normal 
ACTH reserve can be defined as a peak cortisol level above 500 nmol/ L (18 μg/ dL). If the 
peak cortisol level reached during the glucagon test (referring to a his torical test only) is 
lower, then an ACTH stimulation test is needed to confirm the diagnosis of hypoadrenalism.  
L-Dopa test  
After fasting overnight L -Dopa will be given orally at time -point t=0 at a dose of 125 mg if 
body weight is less than 15 kg, else 250 mg if body weight is less than 35 kg, else 500 mg if 
body weight is greater than 35 kg. Since L -Dopa alone is not available in the US A, the 
combination of Carbidopa/Levodopa can be used which is given as 25/250  mg (if > 15 kg) or 
10/100 mg (if <15 kg).  Blood samples will be obtained by an indwelling catheter inserted in a 
cubital vein and kept patent by slow infusion of isotonic saline. Blood will be collected at the 
following intervals: 0, 30, 60, 90 min.  
 Propranolol priming of L -dopa test is NOT  required  
If any of the above tests are administered in tandem, the last sample of the first test will 
be the baseline of the second test, decreasing the sample number by 1 .  
Any of the tests listed in Appendix B are acceptable.  
 The tests SHOULD be performed sequentially, they may NOT be simultaneous  
o  In case the historical GH stimulation tests were  done simultaneously, the data will 
be evaluated on individual basis and borderline stimulation test results may lead 
the global study MM  to request 1 additional test, as outlined above . In such cases, 
both global study MM  will review the historical and en rollment data before such a 
request is made . 
 IF the tests are performed sequentially, the 0 min sample for Agent 2 MAY  be the final 
sample timepoint for Agent 1  
 As all of the tests outlined in Appendix B have a minimum of 90 min, the final sample for 
a 2-agent sequential test should be NO LESS THAN  180 min

APPENDIX C: INSTRUCTIONS FOR OBT AINING HEIGHT MEASUR EMENTS  
Use the following instructions when obtaining Ht measurements . 
Please repeat the following instructions for 3 consecutive  measurement per patient per visit. It  
is recommended that the Ht measurement will be conducted by the same trained person .  
1. Use a wall-mounted calibrated stadiometer , ensure foot plate is in place . 
2. Patients should not stretch prior to Ht determination.  
3. The patient must be standing without shoes.  
4. The patient should be wearing only light clothing so that the patient's pose can be 
obser ved. 
5. The patient's gaze must be forward and horizontal. (Frankfurt position)  
6. Heels must be placed together. If the patient has genu valgum (knock -knee), the knees 
must be in contact with each other and the heels as close to each other as possible.  
7. Heels, buttocks, shoulders, and occiput of the cranium must be in contact with the 
stadiometer.  
8. Upward pressure must be applied to the mandibular rami (jaw).  
9. Shoulders should be relaxed and pressure applied to the abdomen to reduce lordosis 
(spine curvature).  
10. The counterweight head rest is lowered until it is in contact with the highest part of 
the patient's head.  
11. Measurement is read at the horizontal level with the counter.  
12. Have the patient step away from the stadiometer and repeat the previous steps 2 more 
times . Repeated determinations must be within 0. 2 cm of each other, otherwise the 
complete measurement needs to be repeated and recorded.  
13. Record all measurement, the time of measurement and the observer’s name in the 
CRF.

APPENDIX D: INSTRUCTIONS FOR OBTAINING X -RAY FILMS  
BA Assessment using the Greulich and Pyle Method:  
BA assessment is a procedure frequently employed in pediatric radiology and is a reliable 
indicator of the skeletal maturity of an individual.  The pattern of ossification in the bones of 
the hand and wrist occurs in a fairly predictable manner and is age sp ecific until the cessation 
of adolescence when bone elongation is complete.  BA assessments and their comparison 
with CA are imp ortant in pediatric endocrinology for diagnosing diseases which result in 
abnormalities of stature (tall or short) in children. Serial measurements of BA are also critical 
in determining the effectiveness of established treatments of these diseases as well as use in 
clinical studies  in pediatric populations with new drug candidates for assessment eligibility as 
well as efficacy and  /or safety.  
The most common imaging modality for assessment of BA is X-ray of bones of the hand and 
wrist in a posterior to anterior ( PA) view.  Assessments are usually done in the left hand and 
wrist bones to determine the developmental status of individual bones or epiphysis, and a 
“skeletal age”  is ascribed based on the particular indicator or indicators visible on X -ray. The 
hand radiogra phs are quite safe and do not expose the patient  to any significant radiation 
exposure with an effective dose of radiation received during a single exposure bei ng below 
0.0001 -0.001 mSV which is below the exposure one would receive through natural 
background radiation in 20 min or in 2 min on a transatlantic flight.  
The Greulich and Pyle Method is a holistic method based on “The radiographic atlas of 
skeletal dev elopment of the hand and wrist” (second edition, 1959). The atlas contains many 
standard plates which represent normal bone growth and development of the hand from 
infancy through  adolescence separately for males and females.   
For this study, the BA will be assessed by central review using a read model agreed upon 
with the Sponsor  for eligibility and efficacy. The central reviewers will ascribe a BA which 
corresponds to the appropriate structural features that represent a comparable developmental 
stage bas ed on the gender of the patient  based on the Greulich and Pyle Atlas.   
The imaging vendor will provide image acquisition parameters and guidelines to the study 
sites in order to ensure appropriate acquisition and positioning to facilitate robust reads.  
Radiographs will be received by the imaging vendor either as DICOM files from digital 
instruments or as a hard copy film from conventional X -ray instruments.  The imaging 
vendor will digitize the films and blind and mask as needed to ensure that all radiogr aphs will 
be provided to reviewers in a standardized, de -identified digital format .

59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Republic of Korea, October 2008  
64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013  
Preamble  
1.  The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including 
research on identifiable human material and data.  
         The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs 
should be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2.  Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to 
physicians. The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research 
involving human subjects to adopt these principles.  
General Principles  
3.  The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The 
health of my patient will be my firs t consideration,” and the International Code of 
Medical Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best inte rest when 
providing medical care.”  
4.  It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well -being and 
rights of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The 
physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to t he fulfilment of this duty.  
5.  Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving 
human subjects.  
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the 
causes, development and effects of  diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and 
therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proven 
interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, 
effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility an d quality.  
7.  Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all 
human subjects  and protect their health and rights.  
8.  While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal 
can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects .

Confidential Document  
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, 
health, dignity, integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality o f 
personal information of research subjects . The responsibility for the protection of 
research subjects  must always rest with the physician or other health care professionals 
and never with the research subjects , even though they have given consent.  
10.  Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for 
research involving human subjects  in their own countries as well as applicable 
international norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or 
regulatory re quirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research 
subjects  set forth in this Declaration.  
11.  Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimizes  possible harm to the 
environment.  
12.  Medical research involving human subjects  must be conducted only by individuals with 
the appropriate ethics and scientific education, training and qualifications. Research on 
patients or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately 
qualified physician or othe r health care professional.  
13.  Groups that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate 
access to participation in research.  
14.  Physicians who combine medical research with medical care should involve their 
patients in resear ch only to the extent that this is justified by its potential preventive, 
diagnostic or therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that 
participation in the research study will not adversely affect the health of the patients 
who serv e as research subjects . 
15.  Appropriate compensation and treatment for subjects  who are harmed as a result of 
participating in research must be ensured.  
Risks, Burdens and Benefits  
16.  In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions invo lve risks and 
burdens.  
Medical research involving human subjects  may only be conducted if the importance of 
the objective outweighs the risks and burdens to the research subjects . 
17.  All medical research involving human subjects  must be preceded by caref ul assessment 
of predictable risks and burdens to the individuals and groups involved in the research 
in comparison with foreseeable benefits to them and to other individuals or groups 
affected by the condition under investigation.  
Measures to minimize  the risks must be implemented. The risks must be continuously 
monitored, assessed and documented by the researcher.  
18.  Physicians may not be involved in a research study involving human patients  unless 
they are confident that the risks have been adequately  assessed and can be satisfactorily 
managed.  
When the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive 
proof of definitive outcomes, physicians must assess whether to continue, modify or 
immediately stop the study.

Confidential Document  
Vulnerable  Groups and Individuals  
19.  Some groups and individuals are particularly vulnerable and may have an increased 
likelihood of being wronged or of incurring additional harm.  
All vulnerable groups and individuals should receive specifically considered 
protection.  
20.  Medical research with a vulnerable group is only justified if the research is responsive 
to the health needs or priorities of this group and the research cannot be carried out in 
a non -vulnerable group. In addition, this group should stand  to benefit from the 
knowledge, practices or interventions that result from the research.  
Scientific Requirements and Research Protocols  
21.  Medical research involving human patients  must conform to generally accepted 
scientific principles, be based on a  thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, 
other relevant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, 
animal experimentation. The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
22.  The design and performance of eac h research study involving human patients  must be 
clearly described and justified in a research protocol.  
The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and 
should indicate how the principles in this Declaration have been ad dressed. The 
protocol should include information regarding funding, Sponsor s, institutional 
affiliations, potential conflicts of interest, incentives for patients  and information 
regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating patients  who are harmed  as a 
consequence of participation in the research study.  
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post -
trial provisions.  
Research Ethics Committees  
23.  The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, com ment, guidance and 
approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This 
committee must be transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the 
researcher, the Sponsor  and any other undue influence and must be duly qualifi ed. It 
must take into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in 
which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and 
standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protec tions 
for research patients  set forth in this Declaration.  
The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must 
provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any 
serious adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without 
consideration and a pproval by the committee. After the end of the study, the 
researchers must submit a final report to the committee containing a summary of the 
study’s findings and conclusions.

Confidential Document  
Privacy and Confidentiality  
24.  Every precaution must be taken to protect t he privacy of research patients  and the 
confidentiality of their personal information.  
Informed Consent  
25.  Participation by individuals capable of giving informed consent as patients  in medical 
research must be voluntary. Although it may be appropriate to consult family 
members or community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent 
may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely agrees.  
26.  In medical research involving human patients  capable of giving informed consent, 
each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of 
funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, 
the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may 
entail, post -study provisions and any other relevant aspects of the study. The potential 
subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to 
withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention should 
be given to the specific information needs of individual potential patients  as well as to 
the methods used to deliver the information.  
After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician 
or another appropriately qualifie d individual must then seek the potential subject’s 
freely -given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be 
expressed in writing, the non -written consent must be formally documented and 
witnessed.  
All medical research patients  shoul d be given the option of being informed about the 
general outcome and results of the study.  
27.  When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician 
must be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent rela tionship 
with the physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed 
consent must be sought by an appropriately qualified individual who is completely 
independent of this relationship.  
28.  For a potential research subject who is incapa ble of giving informed consent, the 
physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized  representative. 
These individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of 
benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the health of the group represented by 
the potential subject, the research cannot instead be performed with persons capable 
of providing informed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and 
minimal burden.  
29.  When a potential research subject who  is deemed incapable of giving informed 
consent is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the 
physician must seek that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized  
representative. The potential subject’s dissent sh ould be respected.  
30.  Research involving patients  who are physically or mentally incapable of giving 
consent, for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or 
 
 Protocol for Clinical Study CP -4-006 - USA

Confidential Document  
mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary cha racteristic of 
the research group. In such circumstances the physician must seek informed consent 
from the legally authorized  representative. If no such representative is available and if 
the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without inform ed consent 
provided that the specific reasons for involving patients  with a condition that renders 
them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and 
the study has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to rem ain in the 
research must be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorized  
representative.  
31.  The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to 
the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision 
to withdraw from the study must never adversely affect the patient -physician 
relationship.  
32.  For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on 
material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek 
informed consent for its collection, storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional 
situations where consent would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such 
research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and 
approval of a research ethics committee.  
Use of Placebo  
33.  The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested 
against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in t he following 
circumstances:  
Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is 
acceptable; or  
Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no 
intervention is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention  
and the patients who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, 
placebo, or no intervention will not be subject to addit ional risks of serious or 
irreversible harm as a result of not receiving the best proven intervention.  
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
Post-Trial Provisions  
34.  In advance of a clinical trial, Sponsor s, researchers and host coun try governments 
should make provisions for post -trial access for all participants who still need an 
intervention identified as beneficial in the trial. This information must also be 
disclosed to participants during the informed consent process.

Confidential Document  
Research R egistration and Publication and Dissemination of Results  
35. Every research study involving human patients  must be registered in a publicly 
accessible database before recruitment of the first subject.  
36.  Researchers, authors, Sponsor s, editors and publis hers all have ethical obligations 
with regard to the publication and dissemination of the results of research. 
Researchers have a duty to make publicly available the results of their research on 
human patients  and are accountable for the completeness and a ccuracy of their 
reports. All parties should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. 
Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results must be published or otherwise 
made publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations a nd conflicts of 
interest must be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance 
with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.  
Unproven Interventions in Clinical Practice  
37.  In the treatment of an indi vidual patient, where proven interventions do not exist or 
other known interventions have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert 
advice, with informed consent from the patient or a legally authorized  representative, 
may use an unproven inter vention if in the physician's judgement it offers hope of 
saving life, re -establishing health or alleviating suffering. This intervention should 
subsequently be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and 
efficacy. In all cases, new in formation must be recorded and, where appropriate, made 
publicly available.

Pain  
For patients, injection site pain will be evaluated by the Investigator or designated personnel 
if the injection is given at the medical center, and by the parent/legal guardian if the inj ection 
is given at home. The pain will be evaluated using the Pain Rating Scale ( below ). In addition, 
each patient and parent/guardian will be queried during study visits regarding possible 
injection site pain.  
The patients should  be trained to record any injection site reaction in their diaries.  
Pain score above or equal to 4 is considered as an AE .  
Pain  Assessment  
 
The patients will be asked to point to the face that best describes the pain they are 
experiencing (in the patient  diary) and circle the corresponding number.

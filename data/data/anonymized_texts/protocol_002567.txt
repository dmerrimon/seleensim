CONFIDENTIAL  SYNOPSIS  
Study Title: KPI-121-C-002: A Phase 2, Double-Masked, Randomized, 
Controlled Study of KPI-121 0.25% Ophthalmic Suspension 
Compared to Vehicle in Subjects with Dry Eye Disease  
Objectives:  The prima ry objective of the study is to investigate the safety 
and efficacy of KPI -121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension 
compared to vehicle in subjects who have a documented 
clinical diagnosis of dry eye disease . 
Study Population:  
 The study population will consist of subjects diagnosed with 
dry eye disease.  
Number of Subjects Up to 400 subjects who are diagnosed with dry eye disease 
will be screened.  Among those screened, approximately 150 
subjects will be randomized to KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic 
suspension or vehicle.  
Investigational Product s: 
 KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension and vehicle will be 
supplied as investigational product.  
Route and Duration of 
Administration : 1 to 2 drops of investigational product will be instilled in 
each eye four times per day (QID) for up to 28 days.  
Study Design:   
 This is a Phase 2, multi-center, double- masked , randomized, 
vehicle-controlled, parallel- group study designed to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic 
suspension ver sus vehicle  in subjec ts with dry eye disease.   
 Approximately 400 subjects will be screened and up to 150 
subjects will be randomized at up to 12 centers located in the 
United States (US).   
 Subjects will be randomized  to 1 of 2 study arms in an 
approximate 1:1 ratio.  The study arms are: 1) KPI-121 
0.25% ophthalmic suspension administered as 1-2 drops in 
each eye QID for up to 28 days or 2) vehicle administered as 
1-2 drops in each eye QID for up to 28 days.    
Furthermore, subjects will be assigned to a study arm based 
on the stratification of: 
• Subject’s day prior to Visit 2 (Day 1)  
 score

CONFIDENTIAL   AND 
• Study eye baseline investigator- rated bulbar 
conjunctival hyperemia score  
 
This study will include up to 6 clinic visits over 6 weeks. At Visit 1 Screening (14 ± 1 days prior to Day 1), subjects who 
meet screening inclusion/exclusion criteria will begin a 2-
week run-in period during w hich they will be treated with 1 -2 
drops of single-masked vehicle in each eye QID for 14 ± 1 
days.   
 At Visit 2,  Randomization (Day 1), subjects who continue to 
meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be eligible for 
randomization to 1 of the 2 arms of the study (i.e., KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or vehicle).  Following 
randomization, subjects will be instructed to return to the 
clinic to have a complete study evaluation at Study Visits  4 
and 6 (Days 15 ± 1 day and 29 ± 1 day, respectively).  
Subjec ts will further be instructed to return to the clinic for 
diary collection and in- clinic symptom assessment only at 
Visits 3 and 5 (Days 8 ± 1 day and 22 ± 1 day, respectively).  The last dose of investigational product and the final study 
visit will occur  upon completion of 28 ± 1 days of exposure 
to investigational product.  Subjects will be released from the study at the end of Visit 6 (Day 29 ± 1 day). 
 Assessments in this study will include:  
• Subject- rated assessment of ocular discomfort  
  
•  
• Investigator- rated assessment of bulbar conjunctival 
hyperemia 
•  
• Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  
• Slit lamp biomicroscopy  
• Corneal fluorescein staining  
• Unanesthetized Schirmer Test evaluation  
• Lissamine Green conjunctival staining  
• Intraocular p ressure (IOP) measurement

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Over 7 million people in the United States experience dry eye symptoms of some severity 
(DEWS Report, 2007).   Dry eye disease, also called keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) is 
characterized by several symptoms of ocular discomfort, including but not limited to dry eye 
sensation, foreign body sensation, irritation, burning, tearing, ocular pain, and itching.  
Patients with dry eye disease may experience significant ocul ar discomfort and reduced visual 
function, thus resulting in a decreased quality of life or work productivity1. 
 Current treatment of dry eye disease generally begins with artificial tear replacement and then 
expands to include topical anti-inflammatory therapy and punctal occlusion
1.  Topical 
cyclosporine (Restasis®) is currently the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 
prescription medication for use in patients with dry eye disease.  Restasis® is indicated to 
increase tear prod uction in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to 
ocular inflammation associated with KCS, but a significant percentage of patients experience adverse reactions to the drug, including ocular irritation upon instillation, slow ons et of 
response, and limited efficacy.   
 Inflammation has a prominent role in the development and proliferation of dry eye disease
2. 
Factors adversely affecting tear film stability and osmolarity can initiate an inflammatory 
cascade that leads to the development of a self -perpetuating inflam matory cycle2.  Topical 
corticoster oids are used to treat an array of ocular conditions that have an inflammatory 
component, and are generally indicated for treatment of steroid-responsive inflammatory conditions of the conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior segment
3.  
 
LE is an ester corticosteroid that is rapidly metabolized to inactive metabolites, and has been 
reported to have fewer side effects than traditional glucocorticosteroids.  LE was approved by 
FDA in 1998 under N ew Drug A pplication (NDA) 20-583 (Lotemax®; Bausch & Lomb). 
Lotemax has gained wide acceptance by ophthalmologists for use in the treatment of ocular inflammation.  
 
Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KPI) has developed an improved formulation of LE, designated 
KPI-121, using a proprietary technology known as Mucus Penetrating Particles (MPP). MPP 
technology utilizes submicron drug particles formulated to enhance penetration through the mucous layer of the t ear film. KPI-121 is an aqueous suspension of submicron particles of LE 
formulated with excipients present in other FDA-approved ophthalmic drug products. Preclinical studies have shown improved pharmacokinetics for KPI- 121 compared to 
Lotemax, with prolonged drug presence on the ocular surface and increased drug penetration 
into ocular tissues. This improved pharmacokinetic profile has the potential to reduce dosing 
strength of LE as compared to Lotemax.

CONFIDENTIAL   
Kala  Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  intends to develop KPI-121 for the treatment of dry eye disease.  
Study KPI-121-C-002 will evaluate the safety and efficacy of KPI -121 0.25% ophthalmic 
suspension in subjects with dry eye disease.  Additional information about KPI-121, including 
nonclinical pharmacology study results, and potential risks and benefits to human subjects, 
are found in the Investigator’s Brochure.    
 
1.1. DESCRIPTION OF INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
 KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension contains submicron particles of LE suspended in a 
formulation consisting of  excipients that have been used in other FDA-approved ophthalmic 
products.  Kala  is developing this improved LE formulation for the treatment of dry eye 
disease.  
 
KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension contains 0.25% (w/v) LE in an isotonic formulation 
that is buffered to maintain pH 5.0 – 7.0.  It is a sterile, aqueous submicron suspension of LE 
and is filled in a white, low -density polyethylene plastic dropper bottle with a white, 
controlled -drop polyethylene tip and a polypropylene cap. Each bottle contains 5.5 mL 
nominal fill volume.  
 The vehicle control has the same composition as KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension but 
does not contain LE.  The vehicle is  essentially isotonic and is buffered to maintain pH 5.0 – 
7.0.  It is a sterile, aqueous solution supplied in the same white, low-density polyethylene plastic dropper bottle with the same white , controlled-drop polyethylene tip and white 
polypropylene closure as KPI -121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension. 
 1.2. J
USTIFICATION FOR ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION AND DOSE SELECTION  
 KPI-121 will be administered as a topical ophthalmic suspension.  Subjects are expected to 
self-administer 1 to 2 drops of either KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or vehicle QID. 
 Direct instillation is the most efficient method for delivery to  the ocular surface and is an 
accepted and widely used method for topical application to the eye. This study will examine 
safety and efficacy of KPI -121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension versus vehicle dosed  QID for 28 
days in subjects with dry eye disease.  
 
For additional details on the toxicology studies and the respective safety multiples, see the 
Investigator’s Brochure.

ESCRIPTION OF TRIAL DESIGN  
 
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, double-masked, randomized, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group 
study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension 
in treating the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.   
 
This study will include up to 6 clinic visits, including 2 weeks of single- masked vehicle run -in 
followed by up to 28 days of investigational product dosing (KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic 
suspension or vehicle).   
 Up to 400 subjects at up to 12 centers located in the United States (US) will be screened at 
Visit 1 (Screening).  Subjects meeting eligibility criteria at this visit will enter a 14 -day run-in 
period of QID dosing with single masked vehicle.  At Visit 2 (Day 1/Randomization), 
approximately 150 subjects who continue to meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in an 
approximate 1:1 ratio to either KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or vehicle dosed QID.    The study eye will be selected based on the study qualification criteria entered into the 
Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) for stratification at ran domization. If both eyes 
qualify for the study with exactly the same values for ocular entry criteria, IWRS will choose 
the study eye as OD.  Other randomization and stratification allocation criteria will be applied 
as elaborated in the data management plan .  Randomization numbers will be automatically 
assigned to each subject as they are entered into the IWRS, based on the following 2 stratification criteria:  
 
• Subject’s day prior to Visit 2 (Day 1)  score  
 AND  
• Study eye baseline  bulbar conjunctival hyperemia score  
 
The IWRS will assign masked study kit numbers. Bottles of investigational product will be 
dispensed at designated visits based on the subject’s randomization. The Sponsor, 

CLINICAL PROTOCOL KPI- 121-C- 002  FINAL   PAGE 31 OF 80 
26 SEP 2014 
CONFIDENTIAL  Investigators, and study staff will be masked during the randomization process and through 
the remainder of the study.   
 
Subjects will return to the clinic for complete study evaluation at Visits 4 and 6 (Day 15 ± 1 day and Day 29 ± 1 day, respectively).   Subject will also return at Visits 3 and 5 (Days 8 ± 1 
day and 22 ± 1 day, respectively) to  
 assess concomitant medication use and adverse events.  Subjects will 
disco ntinue dosing and be released from the study at Visit 6 (Day 29 ± 1 day).  
 A summary of events is provided in 
Appendix 1 .  Assessments in this study will include:  
 
• Subject- rated ocular discomfort assessment ( Appendix 2 ) 
•  assessment ( Appendix 3 ) 
• Investigator- rated assessment of bulbar conjunctival hyperemia ( Appendix 4 ) 
• Unanesthetized Schirmer Test ( Appendix 5 )

labels will contain  the following information: sponsor name, protocol number, randomization 
number, storage temperature, and required statement(s) per the appropriate regulato ry agency.  
 
All investigational products w ill be stored in a secure area with limited access at controlled 
room temperature (15- 25°C/59 -77° F).  Subjects will be instructed to shake the investigational 
product bottle prior to administering each dose. At Visits 1 and 2, when subjects receive the first dose in the clinic, that dose will count as 1 of their 4 (QID) daily doses. Subjects will 
then self-administer 3 additional doses of investigational product during the remainder of that day to complete QID dosing.  All visits should be scheduled in the morning to allow subjects to receive a full day QID dosing. 
 
Subjects will be asked to instill 1 dose upon awakening and then 3 subsequent doses 
approximately 4 hours after their previous dose.  The 4 doses will be described as “Morning 
Dose ,” “Mid -Morning Dose,” “Afternoon Dose,” and “Evening Dose.”  
 
3.5.2. Methods to Minimize Bias  
 To minimize bias , investigational product  allocation (KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension 
versus vehicle) will be randomized and masked to  the sponsor, subjects, and the investigative 
staff with the exception of a dosing coordinator who will be responsible for dispensing investigational product to subjects and instructing subjects regarding dosing of the investigational product.  The randomization schedule will be generated by the randomization 
statistician  (who is not on the project team) or designee and maintained in a secure and 
limited -access location separate from the study Investigator and members of the project team.

5.1.7. Unscheduled Visit  
 Any visits or procedures performed beyond those specified within the protocol must be 
documented in the Unscheduled Visit pages of the eCRF. Unscheduled visits may include but are not limited to reporting adverse events (AEs), changes in concomitant medications, or 
ophthalmic assessments as deemed appropriate by an appropriately qualified physician.  If the 
subject is disco ntinuing study participation at the unscheduled visit, the eCRFs for Visit 6 
should be completed rather than the eCRFs for an Unscheduled Visit. 
 
5.1.8. Early Termination Visit 
 
In the event of termination prior to Visit 6, every attempt will be made to ensure that all Visit 
6 assessments are performed.  If this is not feasible, at least the following should be

5.2. RESCUE MEDICATION USE 
 
Any subjects not responding adequately to the study medication may be rescued and placed 
on alternate therapy at the Investigator's discretion at any time. The choice of rescue 
medication is at the Investigator's discretion. Any subject placed on rescue therapy will discontinue use of the study medication and continue study participation through Visit 6.  
Rescued subjects will be considered treatment failures, but the need for rescue therapy will 
not be considered an AE. Rescued subjects experiencing an AE at the time of rescue will be followed through stabilization or resolution of the AE or the end of the study (whichever 
comes last ).  Rescued subjects should not be withdrawn from the study, but rather followed to 
resolution of signs and symptoms or until the Investigator has deemed the subject is stable.  
 
5.3. S
UBJECT WITHDRAWAL AND /OR DISCONTINUATION  
 
Any subject who wishes to may withdraw from the investigational product use or from 
participation in the study of his or her own accord for any reason is entitled to do so without 
obligation.  The Investigator may also withdraw any subject from the investigational product use or from study participation, if deemed necessary.  
 Investigational product use  may be discontinued and any subject may be discontinued from 
study par ticipation  at any time during the study at the discretion of the Investigator or the 
sponsor for any reason including but not limited to:  
1. Occurrence of any medical condition or circumstance that exposes the subject to 
substantial risk and/or does not allow the subject to adhere to the requirements of the 
protocol. 
2. Any SAE, clinically significant AE, severe laboratory abnormality, intercurrent 
illness, or other medical condition that indicates to the Investigator that continued 
participation is not in the b est interest of the subject.  
3. Subject's decision to withdraw. 
4. Any woman who becomes pregnant while participating in the study.  Information on the pregnancy and outcome will be requested.   
5. Subject ’s failure to comply with protocol requirements or study related procedures. 
6. Termination of the study by the Sponsor, FDA, or other regulatory authorities.

CONFIDENTIAL  In the event study discontinuation of a randomized subject is necessary, the Investigator 
should make every attempt to have subject complete Visit 6 assessments as possible.   If a non-
serious AE is unresolved at the time of the subject’s final study visit, an effort will be made to 
follow up until the AE is resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or there is 
some other resolution of the event.  The Investigator should make every attempt to follow all 
serious adverse events (SAEs) to resolution.   The reason for premature discontinuation should 
be entered onto the Case Report Form ( CRF ) and recorded in the subject chart.  
 
Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. 
 Additionally, the trial or parts of the trial may be discontinued by the sponsor or at the 
recommendation of the Investigator after consultation with Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  This 
may be based on a significant number of AEs  of a similar nature that warra nt such action.

OLLECTION OF DATA 
 
Source documentation for data collected in this study will be maintained at the investigative 
site.  In cases where no source will be used   it will be no ted in the 
Investigator files.  The CRF will be electronic (eCRF) and data will be electronically entered 
from the source documentation into  the eCRF .  After study completio n, an archival  copy [e.g., 
Portable Document Format (PDF)] of the eCRF data will be retained by the site.

CONFIDENTIAL  6. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
6.1. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT S TO BE ADMINISTERED  
 
All subjects meeting eligibility criteria at Visit 1 will receive 2 bottles of single- masked 
investigational product (vehicle).  Subjects who continue to meet eligibility criteria at Visit 2 
will be randomized to either KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or vehicle.  One kit of 
randomized investigational product containing 3 dropper bottles will be allocated to each subject at Visit 2.  At Visit 2 (Day 1/Randomization), subjects will receive 2 bottles of 
double-masked investigational product (KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or vehicle).  At Visit 4 (Day 15 ± 1 day), subjects will receive 1 additional bottle of double- masked 
investigational product from the kit allocated.  All bottles will be returned to the site at Visit 6 
(Day 29 ± 1 day).  The investigational product will be stored at the site in a secure area with 
limited access at controlled room temperature (15 -25°C/59 -77°F). 
 Subjects will be asked to  administer investigational product QID.  Prior to each instillation, 
subject will be instructed to shake investigational product bottle.  The subjects will record the 
time of ad ministration of each dose of investigational product at the time of instillation 
(
Appendix 12 ).  Compliance with instillation of investigational product will be reviewed and 
assessed at each clinic visit.  
 
6.2. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
 
All medications that the subject has taken 6 months prior to Visit 1 and through Visit 6 or 
discontinuation from the study will be recorded in the eCRF and the subject chart.  The generic name of the drug, dose, route of administration, duration of treatme nt (including start 
and stop dates), frequency, indication, and whether or not the medication was taken due to an 
AE will be recorded for each medication.  
 
6.2.1. Permitted Medications 
 
Medications not specifically excluded in 
Section 6.2.2  may be taken as necessary.

NVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  USE COMPLIANCE  
 
Compliance will be assessed by comparing investigational product accountability records 
with the .  The site will document this 
comparison along with verification of the numbers of used and unused investigational product 
bottles. The numbers of missed doses as assessed at each clinic visit should be documented in 
the eCRF.   
 
6.4. DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
Sponsor study monitors or designees will conduct accountability of investigational product 
(KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or vehicle).  Accountability will be ascertained by

CONFIDENTIAL  performing reconciliation between the amount of drug sent to the site and the amount used 
and unused at the time of reconciliation.  
Clinical trial materials will be shipped to the investigational sites under sealed conditions.  Investigational product shipment records will be verified by comparing the shipment inventory sheet to the a ctual quantity of drug received at the site.  Accurate records of receipt 
and disposition of the investigational product (e.g., dates, quantity, subject number, dose dispensed, returned) must be maintained by the Investigator or his/her designee.    
Investigational product will be stored at controlled room temperature (15-25°C/59-77 °F) in an 
area limited  to controlled access.  
 At the end of the study, all study materials, including any unused investigational product s 
(KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or vehicle), as well as original containers (even if 
empty), will be returned to the drug-packaging vendor in accordance with sponsor or 
designee’s S tandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) , following approval by the Sponsor. All 
returns of investigational product will be documented.  The study monitor or designee will 
verify drug accountability.  All drug accounting procedures must be completed before the study is considered complete.  
 
6.5. M
AINTENANCE OF RANDOMIZATION AND PROCEDURE FOR BREAKING THE CODE 
 
The sponsor, the project teams at the designated Contract Research Organizations ( CROs ), 
and investigative staff responsible for assessments of study endpoints will be masked to 
investigational product assignments.  A dosing coordinator, who is not responsible for study 
assessments, will be required to dispense and retrieve investigational product to the subjects. In case of medical emergency, or occurrence of an SAE, the r andomization code may be 
unmasked and made available to the Investigator, sponsor, and/or other personnel involved in 
the monitoring or conduct of this study.  In the absence of medical need, the randomization code will not be available to the above individuals until after the study is completed and the 
database is locked.   
 
In the event of a medical need, the Investigator will treat each subject as needed.  Since there 
is no specific antidote to KPI-121, immediate emergency unmasking is not necessary.  If the 
Investigator feels it is necessary to unmask a subject’s assignment after an emergency 
situation, the Investigator may call the medical monitor and notify the sponsor.  The 
investigational product assignment will be revealed on a subject -by-subject  basis with the 
approval of the medical monitor and sponsor, thus leaving the masking of the remaining subject s intact.

8.1. SAFETY PARAMETERS  
 
Safety parameters include:  
• Assessments of AEs  
• BCVA  
• Slit lamp biomicroscopy  
• Dilated o phthalmoscopy  
• IOP measurement  
 
8.2. ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS  
 
Adverse Event  (AE) :  Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
investigational product in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
Adverse Reaction (AR) : any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) :  
Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes 
of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. 
 
Unexpected:   An AE or SAR is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
Investigator’s B rochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, 
if an Investigator’s B rochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the cu rrent 
application.   
Life-threatening:  An AE or SAR is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.  
 
  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL KPI- 121-C- 002  FINAL   PAGE 52 OF 80 
26 SEP 2014 
CONFIDENTIAL  A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) is any AE or suspected adverse reaction  occurring 
at any dose that:  
 
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening. 
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions . 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization.  
• Prolongs inpatient hospitalization. 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is a significant medical event (i.e., one that may jeopardize the subject or may require 
intervention to prevent one or more of the other outcomes listed above). 
 
A NON- SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT is any AE  that does not meet the definitions for 
SAE s as described above.  
 Each  AE will be classified as SERIOUS  or NON- SERIOUS using the definitions provided 
above.  The SEVERITY of each AE will be classified as MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE.   
The Investigator will review each event and assess its RELATIONSHIP  to use of 
investigational product (unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, definitely). The AE  will be 
assessed using the following definitions : 
 Unrelated :  
• Event occurring before dosing.  
• Event or intercurrent illness due wholly to factors other than investigational product use. 
 
Unlike ly:  
• Poor temporal relationship with investigational product use.  
• Event easily explained by subject’s clinical state or other factors.  
 
Possible:  
 Reasonable temporal relationship with investigational product use. 
 Event could be explained by subject’s clinical state or other factors.  
 Probable:  
 Reasonable temporal relationship with investigational product use.

CONFIDENTIAL   Likely to be known reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by known 
pharmacology. 
 Event cannot e asily be explained by subject’s clinical state or other factors.  
 Definite:   
• Distinct temporal relationship with investigational product use.  
• Known reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by known pharmacology. 
• Event cannot be explained by subjec t’s clinical state or other factors.

ROCEDURES FOR AE REPORTING BY THE INVESTIGATOR  
 
AEs will be monitored throughout the study and will be recorded on the CRF with the date 
and time of onset, date and time of resolution, severity, seriousness, causality (relationship to use of investigational product ), treatment required , and the outcome.   
To elicit AEs, simple questions with minimal suggestions or implications should be used as 
the initial questions at all evaluation points during the trial.  For example:  
• How have you felt since your last assessment? 
• Have you had any health problems since your last assessment?
 
 
The severity of each AE should be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. 
 The causality of use of investigational product in relation to the AE will be assessed by the 
Principal Investigator  after careful medical consideration and categorized as unrelated, 
unlikely, possible, probable, or definite.  
If an AE occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or treat as deemed appropriate.   
If a non- SAE  is unresolved at the time of the last day of the study, an effort will be made to 
follow up until the AE is resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or there is 
some other resolution of the event.  The Investigator should make every attempt to follow 
SAE s to resolu tion.

ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING BY THE INVESTIGATOR  
 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
It is the responsibility of the Investigators or their designees to report any event of this nature 
to the sponsor or a designee within 24 hours of the event being brought to the Investigators’ or their staffs ’ attention.  It is also the responsibility of the Investigator to report all SAEs 
reported at their site to their Institutional Review Board (IRB), as required.  The Investigator

CONFIDENTIAL  9. STATISTICS  
9.1. STATISTICAL METHODS  
 
Continuous measures (e.g., age) will be summarized descriptively by the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values.  Categorical measures will be 
summarized by the number and percent of subjects. 
 
9.1.1. Subject Disposition, Demographic and Background Characteristics  
 
Subject disposition, demographic characteristics, and background variables will be summarized by study group.   
 
9.1.2. Analysis of Efficacy  
 
The p rimary analysis population will be the Intent- to-Treat (ITT) population, defined as all 
subjects randomized.  A subset of efficacy analyses will be examined for the Efficacy 
Evaluable (EE ) population, the definition of which will be outlined in the Statisti cal Analysis 
Plan and finalized prior to unmasking of study data pursuant to clinical data review.  
 The primary analysis of all ophthalmic efficacy measures will be based on the single study 
eye for each subject.   
 
The co -primary endpoints are (1)  the mean bulbar conjunctival hyperemia score at Visit 6; 
and (2) the mean  severity score averaged over the days from Visit 5 to the 
day before Visit 6.  
Secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints will be evaluated as elaborated in 
Section 3 . 
 
9.1.3. Analysis of Safety  
 
Analysis of safety data will be presented for all subjects in the Safety population (i.e., all subjects receiving randomized investigational product).  AEs will be coded using Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, most current version) and categorized by system organ class using preferred terms.  AEs will be tabulated by study group with respect 
to their Severity  and relationship to the investigational product.  Ophthalmoscopy findings 
will be su mmarized descriptively .  IOP measurements, BCVA and Biomicroscopy will be 
summarized as safety outcomes.

A sample size of 71 in each group will have 90% power to detect an effect size of  using a 
2-group t-test with a 2- sided significance level . 
 
9.3. LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE  
 
The primary assessment of the dose-response will be evaluated using a 5% level of 
significance.  Since both co-primary endpoints will be required to be significant at the 0.05 
level, there is no adjustmen t needed for multiple comparisons. 
 All other reported p-values will be considered descriptive and hypothesis generating.  
 
9.4. P
ROCEDURE FOR ACCOUNTING FOR MISSING , UNUSED , OR SPURIOUS DATA 
 
Any missing, unused, or spurious data will be noted in the final clinical study report.  Multiple imputation will be employed to analyze incomplete data sets under the assumption that 
missing data are, at worst, characterized as missing at random (MAR).  T he reasons for 
missing data will be recorded and the impact of these reasons and any treatment group 
imbalance on the assumption of MAR will be evaluated.  Imputation will be carried out only 
on the co-primary endpoints and time points.  
9.5. P
ROCEDURE FOR REPOR TING DEVIATIONS FROM THE STATISTICAL PLAN 
 
Any deviations from the statistical analysis plan will be described and a justification given in the final clinical study report.

 APPENDIX 3:  ASSESSMENT  
 
Subjects will be asked to subjectively rate their ocular discomfort severity and frequency at 
Visit 1 for eligibility.   
  The total length of the line from  
 is 100 mm.  The length of the line between the  starting 
point and the first point where the subject’s mark crosses the line will be measured and 
recorded in millimeters. This assessment is a general assessment of both eyes.  There will not 
be a question for each individual eye. 
 
 SEVERITY ASSESSMENT  
 
Please place a single line across the line below to indicate how severe ,  
you feel your eye discomfort (for example, dryness or irritation) was:

 APPENDIX 5: UNANESTHETIZED SCHIRMER TEST EVALUATION  
 
Unanesthetized Schirmer  Test evaluation will be conducted at Visit 1.  Identical Schirmer 
Test strips will be supplied to each site.  When conducting assessments room temperature and 
humidity should be relatively consistent throughout each visit and throughout the study.  Please make certain to allow at least 20 minutes between any corneal staining evaluations and 
the unanesthetized Schirmer Test.  
 
Unanesthetized Schirmer Test  
 
• While still in the plastic sheath, fold the notched end of the unanesthetized Schirmer Test strip at the apex of “v”.  Additionally, fold a partial second fold at the halfway 
point of the strip so that the strip does not lie directly in the subject’s line of sight.
 
• Remove the right eye strip from the sheath. 
• Ask the subject to look up and gently draw the right lower lid in a downward and temporal direction. 
 
• Place the rounded end of the strip toward the temporal one-third of the lower eyelid.  
• Repeat this procedure in the left eye. 
• Darken the room, but ensure that the Large E or the ETDRS chart is visible. 
• Instruct the subject to relax and look at the chart while blinking normally or have subject gently close eyes.
 
• Strips are removed after 5 minutes. 
• After removing the strips, with a sharp pencil draw a horizontal line across the leading edge of moisture and a second horizontal line across the lowest point of moisture.
 
• Using a ruler and/or the millimeters recorded on the strips, measure a point halfway 
between the 2 lines and record this as the amount of wetting. 
• Retain Schirmer strips in source documentation.

 APPENDIX 6: BEST-CORRECTED VISUAL ACUITY  
 
BCVA will be conducted at Visits 1, 2, 4 and 6.   
 
Visual acuity testing should precede any examination requiring contact with the eye or instillation of study dyes.  LogMAR visual acuity must be assessed using an ETDRS or 
modified ETDRS chart.  Visual acuity testing should be performed with best correction using subject’s own corrective lenses (spectacles only) or pinhole refraction.  
 
An ETDRS or modified ETDRS chart may be used.  If a Lighthouse chart is used (24.5” by 
25”; either reflectance or retro -illuminated), the subject must view the chart from a distance of 
exactly 4 meters (13.1 feet).  If smaller reproductions (18” by 18”, e.g., Prevent Blindness) are 
used, the subject viewing distance should be exactly 10 feet.  Reflectance wall charts should 
be frontally illuminated (60 watt bulb or a well -lit room).  
 
The subject should be positioned according to the elevation of the chart (either seated or 
standing) so that the c hart is at a comfortable viewing angle.  The right eye should be tested 
first.  The subject should attempt to read each letter, line -by-line, left to right, beginning with 
line 1 at the top of the chart.  The subject should be told that the chart has lette rs only, no 
numbers.  If the subject reads a number, he or she should be reminded that the chart contains no numbers, and the examiner should then request a letter instead of the number.  The subject 
should be asked to read slowly, about 1 letter per secon d, to achieve the best identification of 
each letter.  He/she is not to proceed to the next letter until he/she has given a definite 
response.  If the subject changes a response before he has read aloud the next letter, then the 
change must be accepted.  
 
Maximum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart encouraging the subject to 
guess.  When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be made, the 
examiner should stop the test.  The number of letters missed or read incorrect ly should be 
noted. 
 
In order to provide standardized and well -controlled assessments of visual acuity during 
the study, consistently use the same lighting conditions during the entire study.  
 
Calculations : logMAR VA = Baseline value + (n X 0.02) 
where:  the baseline value is the logMAR number of the last line read (at least 1 letter 
read correctly in this line), and 
“n” is the total number of letters missed up to and including the last line read, and
  
“0.02” is the value for each letter

 APPENDIX 9: LISSAMINE  GREEN CONJUNCTIVAL STAINING  
 
Lissamine Green staining will be performed at Visit 1, 2, 4, and 6.   
 
The conjunctiva will be stained with non-preserved, 1% lissamine green. When conducting all assessments room temperature and humidity should be relatively consistent throughout each 
visit and throughout the study.  
 
• Without flushing the eye from the previous assessment, instill a 20 µ l drop of lissamine 
green to the right eye using a micropipette, allowing a drop to form. 
• Gently touch the drop at the tip of the delivery dropper to the lower palpebral 
conjunctiva of the right eye.    
• In order to thoroughly coat the ocular surface with the lissamine, ask the subject to blink several times and move his/her eye around. 
• After 1 minute and before 4 minutes have elapsed, using white light of moderate 
intensity , grade the areas of the conjunctiva of the right eye with the 0- 3 scale shown 
below. 
• Staining induced by Schirmer Test strip should be excluded. 
• Repeat this procedure for the left eye.

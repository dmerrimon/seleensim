Amendment 1 /26 Jan 2017 Confidential 6 Efficacy Assessments:  
Primary En dpoint:  
 Comparison of the  Duration of Severe Neutropenia  (DSN ) in Cycle 1  between the  SPI-2012 
Treatment Arm and the Pegfilgrastim Treatment Arm .  
DSN  is defined as the number of days of severe neutropenia (ANC  <0.5×109/L) from the first occurrence of  an 
ANC below the threshold . The assessment of ANC will be performed on Day 1  and Days 4 to 15 in Cycle 1 . The 
endpoint will be measured in all patients  in an Intent -to-Treat Population  (ITT Population ). For patients who 
do not meet severe neutropenia criteria , the endpoint measure ment  will be defined as DSN =0. 
Key Secondary Endpoints:  
 To compare SPI-2012  with pegf ilgrastim in:  
1. Time to ANC Recovery in Cycle 1   
2. Depth of ANC N adir, defined as the patient’s lowest ANC in Cycle 1  
3. Incidence of FN in patients during  Cycle 1  
The analyses of the Key Secondary Endpoints will employ a hierarchical , closed testing procedure . 
Additional Secondary Endpoints:  
 To compare SPI-2012  with pegfilgrastim in:  
1. Duration of Severe Neutropenia in Cycles 2 , 3, and 4 
2. Incidence of Neutropenic C omplications , including use of anti -infectives and hospitalizations, in 
patients during  Cycle  1 
3. Incide nces of FN in Cycle s 2, 3, and 4 
4. RDI of TC in Cycles 1  to 4 
5. Safety  
Pharmacokinetic Assessments:  
All patients in the SPI-2012  treatment arm will have blood samples drawn for sparse PK sampling at 6 time 
points during the study period for PK analysis. The sampling time  points will be : 
 Cycle 1:  
 Day 2  (1 to 4 hours after SPI-2012  administration)  
 Day 4  (at the same time as CBC blood draw ) 
 Day 5  (at the same time as CBC blood draw ) 
 Cycle 3 : 
 Day 2  (1 to 4 hours post -dose)  
 Day 4  (±1 day , at the same time as CBC blood draw ) 
 Day 7  (±1 day , at the same time as CBC blood draw )  
Safety Assessments:  
Safety (secondary endpoint ) will be assessed by reported/elicited  adverse events  (AEs), laboratory assessments, 
and physical examinations.  In addition, as applicable, patients who receive at least one dose of study drug will 
be followed for 12 months after the  last dose of study treatment to assess  long-term safety;  patients who receive 
SPI-2012  will be tested for antibodies to SPI-2012 , the Fc region of the SPI-2012  molecule, the PEG moiety, 
and G -CSF. Patients  who receive pegfilgrastim will be tested for antibodies to SPI-2012 , PEG and G -CSF. All 
sera samples positive for G -CSF-binding antibodies will be further tested for G -CSF neutralizing antibodies.   
Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Reporting:  
All AEs that occur from the first dose of study treatment through 35 (±5)  days after the date of last study 
treatment  or date of patient early discontinuation  are to be recorded on the AE CRF . Additionally, as applicable, 
Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol 
SPI- 2012 (HM10460A) Protocol Number: SPI-GCF- 301 
Amendment 1 /26 Jan 2017 Confidential 7 patients who receive at least one dose of study drug ( SPI-2012  or pegfilgrastim ) will be followed for 12 months  
after the  last dose of study treatment to evaluate the long -term safety and immunogenicity of SPI-2012 . All AEs 
during this time period will be recorded. From the time the study Informed Consent is signed through the first 
dose of study drug administration, only SAEs that are related to study procedures are to be recorded.  
Statistical Methods:  
For the primary efficacy analysis, the mean DSN  in Cycle 1  will be compared between the SPI-2012 and 
Pegfilgrastim T reatment Arms  using a bootstrap resampling method with non -inferiority hypothesis . A 
2-sided 95% confidence interval  (CI) of the difference between  the mean DSN  of the SPI-2012  Treatment A rm 
and the mean DSN  of the Pegfilgrastim Treatment  Arm will be calculated using bootstrap resampling  with 
treatment as the only stratification factor . The study will use a non-inferiority margin of 0.62 day for the above 
comparison.  
The non -inferiority of SPI-2012  to pegfilgrastim  will be declared if the upper bound of 95% CI of the difference 
in mean DSN  between the treatment arms is < 0.62 days. Primary analysis for the  non-inferiority hypothesis will 
be based on  the ITT P opulation . An analysis based on the Per Protocol Population  will be performed as  a 
sensitivity analysis.   
For the secondary efficacy analyses, the results will each be summarized by Treatment Arm and Cycle. The two-
sided 95% CI for the difference between the treatm ent arms will be calculated.  
For safety analysis, the number and percentage of patients with any treatment -emergent AEs ( TEAEs ), any  
serious AEs  (SAEs ), TEAEs related to study drug s, and TEAEs causing treatment discontinuation will be 
summarized. Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) (musculoskeletal pain , injection site reactions , and 
hypersensitivity reactions ) will be assessed and summarized by Preferred Term.  An exposure -response analysis 
will be performe d based on sparse PK sampling.  
Sample size estimates are based on a non -inferiority design. The pooled standard deviation of  the DSN  is 
assumed to be 2. 0 days,  after referencing the assumptions used in the two Phase 3 registrational pegfilgrastim  
trials.  The margin of non -inferiority is 0.62 days. The true difference between the means is assumed to be 0.0 
days. Sample sizes of 200 per treatment arm will provide  87% power to detect non -inferiority using a one -sided, 
two-sample t -test at 2.5% level of signifi cance.  
The study will enroll and randomize approximately 200 patients per arm for a total of approximately 
400 patients.

Amendment 1 /26 Jan 2017 Confidential 17 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 B ackground 
1.1.1 B reast Cancer and Role of Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor 
According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), breast cancer is one of the most common 
forms of cancer and the second highest cause of cancer deaths in women [ 1]. In 2014 in the 
United St
ates (US), an estimated 232,670 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 62,570 
additional cases of in situ  breast cancer occurred, and approximately 40,430 US women were 
e
xpected to die from breast cancer. In addition, breast cancer is also seen in males, with an 
e
stimated 2360 men being diagnosed with breast cancer and 410 dying from the disease in 2013. 
Data show
 that mortality rates from breast cancer increase with age, reac
hing
 a peak when 
patients are in their 70s [ 1].  
The
 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical guidelines recommend that most 
pa
tients with early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) receive adjuvant chemothera
py after they have 
undergone complete surgical excision of the primary tumor by lumpectomy and axillar
y 
dissection or modified radical mastectomy [ 2]. Current NCCN guidelines for adjuvant 
c
hemotherapy regimens to treat ESBC include docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide 
(TAC); dose dense doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC), with or without subsequent 
weekly or semiweekly
 paclitaxel; and docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide (TC).
  
The use of adjuvant chemotherapy to improve survival in patients with ESBC has been widely 
adopted [ 3]. Th e TC regimen is an attractive therapeutic option because it has demonstrated 
efficacy [4] and reduced risk of cardiotoxicity compared with other therapies that contain 
a
nthracyclines [ 5]. USO 9735  was a pivotal Phase 3 trial that compared TC vs. AC among 
pa
tients with operable ESBC [ 6]. Trial results showed that after 7 years of follow-up, 4 cycles of 
TC we
re associated with significantly improved Disease Free Survival ( DFS) and Overall 
S
urvival ( OS) compared with 4 cycles of AC. Specifically, the DFS  was 81% and 75% for TC 
a
nd AC, respectively, and the OS  was 87% and 82%, respectively. Although the TC regimen has 
not
 been associated with cardiotoxicity [4, 6, 7] , it  has been associated with other adverse events, 
particularly hematologic toxicities [ 4, 6].  
I
n USO 9735 , the reported rates of Febrile Neutropenia  (FN)  were 4% in women younger than 
65 years and 8% in those 65 years or older, although FN was not a pre-planned evaluable 
endpoint in the trial [4]. No dose reductions were permitted, and patients were taken off 
treatment if any study drug administration was delayed by more than 2 weeks becaus
e of drug-
related toxicities. Prophylactic use of quinolone antibiotics was recommended at the discretion of
 
the treating physician. Prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating f
actor (G-CSF) was not 
allowed, and reactive G-CSF support for chemotherapy-induced neutropen
ic complications was 
not specified [ 4].  
Subsequent reports have suggested that TC is associated with higher rates of FN  than those 
re
ported in USO 9735, ranging from 25% to 50% in the absence of G-CSF support and 
de
creasing to 0% to 6.3% with primary G-CSF prophylaxis (Table 1)  [8-12] .

SPI- 2012 (HM10460A) Protocol Number: SPI-GCF- 301 
Amendment 1 /26 Jan 2017 Confidential 19 Development of FN increases diagnostic and treatment costs, and often leads to prolonged 
hospitalizations. In addition, changes in ne
utrophil counts have been correlated with quality of 
life, as measured by physical functioning, vit
ality, and mental health [ 18].  
Filgr
astim, tbo-filgrastim, and pegfilgrastim are G-CSFs currently approved by the US Food and 
Drug Administration (F
DA) for the preve
ntion of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia [15].While 
the European guidelines also include lenograstim as a recommended G-CSF in solid tumors and 
non-myeloid malignancies, it is not approved for use in the US. 
Studies have
 demonstrated that the use of G-CSF can reduce the risk, severity, and duration of 
FN [15]. Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the European 
Or
ganization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Guidelines , as well as NCCN 
recommend the use of G-CSF as primary prophylaxis when the anticipated risk of FN for a 
pa
tient initiating chemotherapy is high [ 15, 19, 20 ].  
1.1.2 S PI-2012 
Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Spectrum) is developing a novel, long-acting form of G-CSF, 
SPI-2012 (also known as Rolontis™, eflapeg
rastim, HM10460A, Long Acting Protein/Peptide 
Discovery Platform Technology-G-
CSF [LAPS-G-CSF] ), a chemically conjugated form of a 
modi
fied G-CSF, for the indication of 
the reduction in the Duration of Severe Neutropenia 
(DSN) a nd incidence of infection, as manifested by FN in patients with solid tumors and non-
m
yeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer therapy. SPI-2012 is a novel 
biologic and not a biosimilar to either filg
rastim or pegfilgrastim. 
SPI- 2012
 is produced b
y conjugating a novel, modified recombinant human G-CSF (with no 
additional N-terminal Met, referred to as HM10411), a
nd the human immunoglobulin G4 Fc 
fragment (referred to as HMC001) via a 3.4 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker to produce a 
ne
w, long-acting G-CSF. 
HM10411 a nd HMC001 are each manufactured using recombinant -DNA technology in E. coli. 
Specifically, HM10411 is produced by fermentation of transformed E. coli in the periplasmic 
space followed by harvesting and purification. Whereas HMC001 is produced by fermentati on of 
transformed E. coli as an inclusion body followed by harvesting, refolding, and purification.  
The human immunoglobulin G4 F c fragment (HMC001) was specifically chosen as the 
conjugation partner for this novel G -CSF because it has a  long  in vivo half- li fe of several weeks . 
Details of the product’s characteristics can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
1.1.2.1 Nonclinical Studies 
The biological response to rh-G-CSF is not species specific, and therefore the biological 
response of rh-G-CSF has been e
xamined in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys in single- and repeat-
dose studie s. Mouse bone marrow cells, chemotherapy-induced neutropenic mouse and rat 
models, norm al and nephrectomized rats, and cynomolgus monkeys have all been used to 
stud
y the effects of SPI-2012 . All toxicology
 studies were performed under Good Laboratory 
P
ractice (GLP) conditions. 
The kinetics of neutrophil proliferation in neutropenic mice and rats stimulated with SPI-2012, 
pegfilgrastim, and filgrastim were
 also compared. SP
I-2012  was shown to have an 
a
pproximately 2-fold higher Area Under the Time-Concentration Curve (AUC) for Absolute 
Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol

Amendment 1 /26 Jan 2017 Confidential 20 Neutrophil Count (ANC) when compared to pegfilgrastim at similar doses (ie, when comparing 
equivalent G-CSF concentrations of the compounds). Based on these results, SP I-2012  was 
estimated to have twice the in vivo potency as pegfilgrastim. The potential clinical benefit of the 
increased potency of SPI-2012  was analyzed by comparing the DSN  in neutropenic rats to the 
DSN response to pegfilgrastim and filgrastim in this same model. S PI-2012  was found to be 
more potent in shortening the DSN with a lower G-CSF equivalent dose when compared to 
e
ither pegfilgrastim or filgrastim. The DSN was 0.2 days when S PI-2012 was co-administered or 
se
quentially administered as a single dose at 88 µg/kg (as G-CSF equivalent) with chemotherapy 
drugs in rats. In contrast, the DSN was 3.04 days with filgrastim administered at dose of 
20 µg/kg for 5 days and was 2.8 days with pegfilgrastim administered as a single dose of 
100 µg/kg. 
I
n cynomolgus monkeys, neutrophil counts increased as SPI-2012 dose levels increased (161.48 
to 322.96 μ
g/kg SPI-2012 ,) but were not dose-proportional. Maximum neutrophil levels peaked 
on Day 1  post-dose,  decreased by Day 7  following IV administration, peaked on Day 3 post-
dose, and then decreased by Day 16  following SC administration of SPI-2012 . SPI-2012  also 
showed an approximately 3-fold higher AUC for ANC compared to pegfilgrastim at the same 
G-CSF equivalent dosing level.  
1.1.2.2 Clinical Experience 
1.1.2.2.1 Phase 1 Studies 
Two Phase 1 studies of S PI-2012  (08-HM10460-101, N=60; 09-HM10460-101, N=30) were 
c
onducted in healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety and the pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
pha
rmacodynamic properties of SPI-2012. Most adverse events (AEs) reported in the se studies 
we
re mild and comparable to those reported in other clinical trials with pegfilgrastim. Common 
treatment-related AEs included bone pain, back pain, and headache. No clinically significant 
changes were found in electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, or splenic evaluation. Isolated cases 
of tachycardia, palpitation, and transient elevations of liver enzymes were seen in some patients. 
Ove
rall in the Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers, doses of SPI-2012 between 1.1 µg/kg and 
350 µg/kg were generally well-tolerated and increased white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil 
c
ounts in a pronounced and dose-dependent manner.  
1.1.2.2.2
 Phase 2 Study- SPI-GCF-12-201 
A P
hase 2, open-label, dose-ranging, study ( SPI-GCF-12-201, N=148) has also been completed. 
This 
study compared three weight-based doses of S PI-2012  (45, 135, and 270 µg/kg ) ve rsus 
pegfilgrastim (6  mg) for the management of neutropenia in breast cancer patients receiving TC 
chemotherapy, and provides safety and efficacy data supporting advancement to Phase 3 and the 
basis for the fixed dose recommendation. Brief results are presented below and additional results 
a
re presented in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
1.1.2.2.2.1 Study Design 
SPI-GCF-12-201 wa s a  Phase 2, open-label study to assess the effect of test doses of SPI-2012 
on the DSN during Cyc le 1  in patients with breast cancer who were candidates for adjuvant or 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC). 
The study included 4 single-dose treatment arms: 
Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol 
SPI- 2012 (HM10460A) Protocol Number: SPI-GCF- 301 
Amendment 1 /26 Jan 2017 Confidential 21  Arm 1 : SPI-2012  (45 μg/kg) 
 Arm 2 : SPI-2012  (135 μg/kg) 
 Arm 3 : SPI-2012  (270 μg/kg) 
 Arm 4 : Pegfilgrastim (6 mg) 
Administration of TC on Day 1 of each cycle IV was:  
 Doc etaxel at 75 mg/m2 IV infusion per Institute’s standard of care  
 C yclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 IV infusion per Institute’s standard of care  
Each treatment cycle was 21 days with up to a maximum of 4 cycles of chemotherapy. To begin 
full-dose chemotherapy on Day 1 of the next cycle ( Day 22  of the  previous cycle), patients must 
have
 recovered to an ANC greater than 2.0×109/L and a platelet count ≥100×109/L. 
SPI-2012 was administered on Day 2  of each cycle, approximately 24 to 26 hours after TC 
c
hemotherapy. The dose of SPI-2012 administered depended on the treatment arm to which each 
pa
tient was assigned. Pegfilgrastim was to be administered according to the manufacturer’s 
Prescribing Information (6 mg subcutaneously once per chemotherapy cycle).  
1.1.2.2.2.2 Disposition and Demographics 
In SPI-GCF-12-201, 148 patients were randomized into the 4 treatment arms. Most patients 
(147 
patients [99%]) completed at least 1 cycle of treatment. Ten patients (7%) discontinued 
fr
om the study. Three patients (2%) withdrew consent, two patients (1%) discontinued due to 
adverse events, and five patients discontinued for other reasons. Four patients (2 patients each in 
the 135 μg/kg SPI-2012 group [one patient withdrew consent and one patient initiated a non-
protoc
ol therapy] and 270 μg/kg SPI-2012 dose group [both patients withdrew consent]) 
disconti
nued prior to beginning Cycle 2  and 138 patients (93%) were treated for all 4 cycles.  
The mean age of all patients in SPI-GCF-12-201 was 58.2 years and ranged from 32 years to 
77 years across all groups. Most patients were less than 65 years of age ( n=100 [ 68%]), female 
(n=144 [98%]), and White (n=139 [95%]). There were 3 male patients in the study, two in the 
270 µg/kg SPI-2012 group and one in the 135 µg/kg S PI-2012 group. 
D
uring Cycle 1  in S PI-GCF-12 -201. During Cy cle 1 , most patients (≥64 %) in all three SPI-
2012 dose groups and the pegfilgrastim group did not develop neutropenia; at S PI-2012  doses 
≥135 
µg/kg, the proportion of patients not experiencing neutropenia was comparable or higher to 
the incidence with pegfilgrastim. 
1.1.2.2.2.3
 Duration of Severe Neutropenia 
In the 270 µg/kg  SPI-2012  group, n eutropenia was reported in only one patient (3%), which 
lasted only 1 day. In the 135 µg/kg SPI-2012 group, seven patients (19%) experienced 
ne
utropenia, which lasted for 1 day in three patients (8%), 2 days in three patients (8%), and 
7 days in one patient (3%). Approximately one-third of patients in the 45 µg/kg S PI-2012  group 
experienced neutropenia that lasted between 1 to 5 days. In the pegfilgrastim group, five patients 
(14%) experienced neutropenia, which lasted for 1 day in one patient (3%), 2 days in two 
pa
tients (6%), and 3 days in two patients (6%). The magnitude of DSN  and the mean values in 
the various treatment arms may be much lower in this study as compared to that in the literature

Amendment 1 /26 Jan 2017 Confidential 25 clinical benefits of the prophylactic use of G-CSF for patient safety, to maximize treatment 
intensity and outcomes, and cost-efficiency. 
Pharmacological analysis of S PI-2012  in vivo  revealed a 2- to 3-fold increase in the AUC of the 
ANC at G-CSF-equivalent doses similar to pegfilgrastim. Clinical experience from the Phase 2 
trial ( SPI-GCF-12-201) i n breast cancer patients has shown that SPI-2012 is non-inferior to 
pe
gfilgrastim and has a similar safety profile. All doses of SPI-2012 administered in 
S
PI-GCF-12-201 were well tolerated. No significant dose-related toxicities were observed. The 
DSN in the 135 µg/kg S PI-2012  arm was non-inferior to pegfilgrastim in Cycle 1  and the DSN 
in t
he 270 µg/kg S PI-2012  Treatment Arm was superior to the Pegfilgrastim Treatment A rm. 
Non-inferiority in DSN was also observed in Cyc les 2 to 4 in both the 135 µg/kg and 270 µg/kg 
treatment arms when compared to pegfilgrastim. 
The current Phase 3 study is designed to expand on the information obtained in the Phase 2 trial 
a
nd evaluate the efficacy, and safety of SPI-2012, as compared with pegfilgrastim ( Ne ulasta 
[NDC 55513 -190-01] manufac
tured by Amgen in the United States) , in breast cancer patients 
receiving TC.   
The dose of SPI-2012 to be studied in this trial is 13.2 mg S PI-2012  equivalent to 3.6 mg 
G
-CSF, approximately half of the G-CSF equivalent dose in 6 mg pegfilgrastim. This dose was 
selected on the basis of the pharmacological and pharmacodynamic data from the Phase 2 trial 
(S
PI-
GCF-12-201).   
As appli
cable, patients who have received at least one dose of study drug ( SPI-2012 or 
pe
gfilgrastim) will be followed for 12 months after the last dose of study treatment for safety 
follow
-up. Patients will visit the clinic at approximately 6 months and 12 months for a blood 
dra
w for evaluation of immunogenicity and for evaluation of AEs, subsequent anti-cancer 
therapy, use of other myeloid growth factors, and participation in any other subsequent clinical 
tria
ls. In addition, patients will also be contacted by telephone at approximatel y 3 months and 9 
mont
hs for evaluation of AEs, subsequent anti-cancer therapy, use of other myeloid growth 
factors, and participation in any other subsequent clinical trials.

7 S AFETY ASSESSMENT 
7.1 S afety Measures 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the patients at their 
site and to report all AEs/SAEs that are observed or reported during the study, regardless of 
relationship to study drug or clinical significance.  
Safety data will also be reviewed on a regular basis by Spectrum’s study monitoring team, which 
include
s a C
linical Research Associate ( CRA ), Medical Monitor, and other personnel from the 
company or its designee.  
Adverse events will be characterized by intensity (severity), causality, and seriousness by the 
Investigator based on the regulatory definitions included below. 
This study will utilize the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Eve
nts (CTCAE) Scale Version 4.03 for AE grading. 
7.2 Adver se Events 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient, t
emporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or study procedure, whether or 
not considered re
lated to the medicinal product. Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable and 
unintende
d sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or 
exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. A treatment-emergent 
AE (TEAE)
 is any AE that occurs from the first dose of study treatment through 12 months after 
the last dose of study treatment or 35 (±5) days after the date of patient early discontinuation. 
Additi
onall
y, as applicable, patients who receive at least one dose of study drug ( SPI-2012 or 
pegfilgrasti
m) will be followed for safety for 12 months after the last dose of study treatment or 
date of pati
ent early discontinuation. All AEs during this time period will be recorded. 
The study will record all AEs according to the information in  Section 7.3 .

 Ex acerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration.  
 S igns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug interaction. 
 S igns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational product or a concurrent medication. 
 AEs may include pre-treatment or post-treatment events that occur as a result of protocol-
mandated procedures, ie ,  invasive procedures. 
Abnormal laboratory results are to be recorded as AEs, if any of the following conditions are 
met:
 
 The  abn ormal laboratory value leads to a therapeutic intervention. 
 The  abnormal laboratory value is considered to be clinically significant by the

8 S TATISTICAL PLAN  
This section contains a brief overview of the statistical analyses planned for this study. A formal 
statistical anal
ysis plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to first patient enrolled.  
8.1 S ample Size  
Approximately 400 patients will be enrolled in this study. The primary endpoint analysis is based 
on the test of non-inferiority of S PI-2012  as compared to pegfilgrastim. The pooled standard 
deviation of DSN is assumed to be 2.0 days, after referencing the assumptions used in the two 
P
hase 3 reg
istrational pegfilgrastim trials [28]. Th e standard deviation used for sample size 
calculation in the two Phase 3 pegfilgrastim trials was 2.17 and 1.5 days, respectively.  
For the test of non-inferi
ority hypothesis, the margin of non-inferiority to be used in the study is 
0.62 day. The true difference between the means is assumed to be 0.0 days. Sample sizes of 
200pa
tients per treatment arm will achieve 87% power to detect non-inferiority using a one-
sided, two-sample t-test at 2.5% level of significance. The study will enroll and randomize 200 
patients per arm 
for a total of approximately 400 patients.  
The non-inferiority
 of SPI-2012  to pegfilgrastim will be declared if the upper bound of 95% CI 
of the
 difference in mean DSN  between the treatment arms is <0.62 days.  
8.2 M ethod of Treatment Assignment, Randomization, and/or Stratification 
The patients enrolled in this study will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to the  SPI-2012 and 
pegfilgrastim
 treatment arms and stratified by study site. A randomization scheme using a 
permuted block design w
ill be developed. An interactive web response system will be used to 
assign a ra
ndomization identification (ID) once patients meet eligibility criteria and are ready to 
be randomized. The randomization ID will be different than the Patient ID, and a mapping of 
randomization 
ID to Patient ID will be kept in a secured database.

SPI- 2012 (HM10460A) Protocol Number: SPI-GCF- 301 
Amendment 1 /26 Jan 2017 Confidential 46 8.3 Analysis Populations 
 Intent- to-Treat Population  (ITT): will consist of all patients who are randomized.  
Patients will be analyzed as randomized if the actual treatment assignments deviate from 
the 
randomization scheme.  
 Per Protocol (PP) Population:  will include all patients in the IT T population  with no 
major protocol deviation in Cycle 1 . Patients will be analyzed as treated if the actual 
tre
atment assignments deviate from the randomization scheme.  
 Safety Analysis Population  (S AF ): will consist of all patients who receive at least one 
dose of any protocol-specified drug (TC or SPI-2012  or pegfilgrastim) 
Patients who discontinue from the study prior to randomization will be replaced as they are not 
considered to be the ITT patients.  
8.4 G eneral Statistical Methods 
Spectrum’s Biostatistics and Data Management (BDM) group (or a contracted data management 
vendor ) will be responsible for data management and statistical analysis of this study. All 
statis
tical analyses will be performed using SAS for Windows (version 9.3 or higher). Patient 
da
ta listings and tabular presentations of results will be provided. Further details of the criteria 
a
nd conduct of the statistical analyses will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan for this 
study to be finalized prior to first patient enrolled. 
8.5 E fficacy Analyses 
8.5.1 P rimary Endpoint 
The primary analysis of the comparison of the DSN in Cyc le 1 between the SP I-2012 
Treatment Arm and the  Pegfilgrastim Treatment Arm will be conducted using the ITT 
Population . 
DSN in Cyc le 1  is defined as the number of days of severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5×109/L) from 
the first occurrence of an ANC below the threshold. The assessment of ANC will be performed 
on Day1  and Days 4-15  in Cycle 1. The endpoint will be measured in all patients in the IT T  
Population . For patients who do not meet severe neutropenia criteria, the endpoint measurement 
will be defined as DSN =0. 
F
or the primary efficacy analysis, the mean DSN in Cyc le 1 will be compared between the 
SP
I-2012 Treatment Arm  and the Pegfilgrastim Treatment A rm using a bootstrap resampling 
method with non
-inferiority hypothesis. A 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference 
between the mean DSN of the S PI-2012 Treatment A rm and the mean D SN of the 
P
egfilgrastim Treatment A rm will be calculated using bootstrap resampling with treatment as 
the onl
y stratification factor. The study will use non inferiority margin of 0.62 days for the above 
c
omparison. The non-inferiority of SPI-2012 to pegfilgrastim will be declared if the upper bound 
of 95
% CI of the difference in mean DSN between the treatment arms is <0.62 days.  
P
rimary analysis for the non-inferiority hypothesi s will  be based on the ITT population. An 
a
nalysis based on the PP Population  will be performed as a se nsitivity analysis.  
I
n addition to bootstrap resampling method to calculate 95% CI of the difference in mean DSN 
be
tween treatment arms, the test of the difference in mean DSN  between treatment arms will be

Amendment 1 /26 Jan 2017 Confidential 47 conducted using Poisson distribution as another sensitivity analysis. If the data is overdispersed, 
a
 negative binomial distribution will be incorporated for the test. For the Poisson and negative 
binomial regression, the identical link will be used and treatment will be the only covariate in the 
model. The difference in mean DSN between S PI-2012 and p egfilgrastim will be calculated 
along with 2-sided 95% CI, based on Poisson or negative binomial regression. Based on the 
ini
tial review of the efficiency of the estimates of bootstrap, Poisson and negative binomial 
distributions, 95% CI calculated using bootstrap resampling method appear to be robust and 
therefore is proposed to be the primary analysis method for the primary endpoint. Detailed 
sim
ulation results will be provided along with SAP.  
Additi
onal sensitivity analyses will also be used to examine the: 
 T reatment effect,  adjusting for the various study sites. This analysis will be carried out 
using
 the same methodology as the primary analysis (bootstrap resampling method), and 
stud
y site will be used as an additional stratification factor in the resampling.  
 T reatment effect,  adjusting for disease status at randomization (adjuvant or neoadjuvant). 
This analysis will be the same as the primary analysis (bootstrap resampling method) and 
disease status will be used as additional stratification factor in the resampling. 
 I mpact of missing data, using a worst case scenario. When ANC data are missing on or 
a
fter Day 5 , and before patients ’ ANC increase to ≥1.5×109/L  after the expected nadir in 
Cycle 1 , missing ANC values will be imputed as <0.5 ×109/ L for SPI-2012  and ≥0.5×
109/L  for pegfilgrastim, for the purpose of DSN calculation. The method of analysis of 
im
puted DSN data using worst case scenario will be the same as the primary analysis 
(bootstra
p resampling method).  
In addition, the following subgroups will be examined for DSN in Cyc le 1 :  
 Age : <65 y ears, ≥65 y ears 
 Ge nder (Male, Female) 
 R ace 
 Dise ase Status (Adjuvant, Neoadjuvant) at randomization 
 Ge ographic Region  
 W eight: <65 kg, 65 to 75 kg, or >75 kg 
8.5.2 K ey Secondary Endpoints 
 To c ompare SPI-2012  with pegfilgrastim in:  
 Time to ANC Recovery in  Cycle 1 , defined as the time from chemotherapy 
administration until the patient ’s ANC increases to ≥1.5×109/ L after the expected 
nadir. For patients with ANC value ≥1.5×109/ L at all times, Time to ANC Recover y 
will be assigned to a value of 0 .

 Safety  
The analyses of Key Secondary Endpoints will employ a hierarchical closed testing procedure 
[29], where endpoints are ranked with the primary endpoint first and then the Key Secondary 
Endpoints in the order listed above. Specifically, the order of testing is: 
1. DSN  in Cycle 1  
2. T ime to ANC Recovery  in Cycle 1  
3. De pth of ANC Nadir in Cycle 1  
4. I ncidence of FN in Cycle 1  
For the secondary efficacy analyses, the results will each be summarized by Treatment Arm and 
Cycle and will use the ITT population. Two-sided 95% CI for the difference between the 
tre
atment arms will be calculated. 
No adjustment to alpha will be necessary once the preceding endpoint comparison is significant 
for the subsequent 
endpoints in the above order of endpoints, with each test at the same 
significance level of α=0.05. 
8.6 Anal ysis of Safety 
The overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAE) (ie, AEs occurring from the time the 
first dose of the study drug through 12 months after the last dose of study drug administration or 
35 (±5) days a
fter the date of patient early discontinuation ) and the proportion of  patients who 
discontinue because of a TEAE are the primary safety outcome measures.  
The number and percent of patients with new-onset TEAEs will be summarized by the MedDRA 
System-Organ-Class (SOC) level and Preferred Term (PT) for all treated patients. The summary 
of TEAEs will be
 presented in the following categories:  
 Number and percentage of patients with any TEAEs by SOC and PT . 
 Number and percentage of patients with any SAEs by SOC and PT. 
 Number and percentage of patients with related TEAEs by SOC and PT. 
 Relate

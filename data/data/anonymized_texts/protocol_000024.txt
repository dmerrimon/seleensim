Minor ty pographical errors have been corrected in the protocol.
Protocol  synopsis (Statist ical methods) The actual non -inferiorit y margin for the study  
primary  object ive is clarified as 10% of the overall baseline mean LVEDV index across all 
treatm ent gro ups.  
Secti on 2. (Study  objectives) Primary object ive was not changed but added further 
clarificati on to the NI m argin .
Secti on 8.1 Added that combinat ion of s tratificat ion levels and/or variables or droppi ng of 
variables could be done for imputation models, (in addit ion to analysis modelswhich was 
specified originally ).
Secti on 8.2. (Sam ple size est imate) clarification that the 6.5 value used for the NI margin in 
this secti on is an est imate used for sample size calculat ion purposes and is not necessarily  
the NI m argin that will be applied in the analysis (which will be 10% of the overall baseline 
mean).  
Secti on 8.5 (Method of statist ical analysis)
To m ore cl osely  follow past heal th authori ty recommendat ions, a change t o the handling of 
missing data has been made.  Instead of co mplete case analysis, mult iple imputation will be 
done.  Clarification on how the non-inferiorit y margin will be tested is also added.

Target subject population
The target populat ion includes male and female patients aged 18 years and older with 
docum ented ty pe 2 di abetes m ellitus and wi th a prior diagnosis of heart failure. Approximately 
330 patients with docum ented LVEF ≤45% and NT-proBNP >300 pg/mL will be rando mized 
in equal  proporti ons (110 patients per group) to treatment with saxaglipt in, sitaglipt in or 
placebo.  
Patients must have an estimated glomerular filtrati on rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2at 
screening to qualify for enrollment. The proporti on of rando mized patients with an eGFR of 
≥30 and <50 mL/min/1.73 m2will be limited to 30% and rando mizat ion will be stratif ied to 
rando mize a maximum o f 99 patients (maximum 33 for each treatment group).  Patients whose

10(85)eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2must be permanent ly discont inued from the study  after 
an initial result is confirmed on repeat testing.
Patients m ust have a diagnosis of Ty pe 2 DM based on current ADA guidelines.   
Duration of treatment
In this study , sites will perform a pre-screening assessment prior to the enrollment visit to 
determine if patients meet eGFR inclusio n criteria.  All potenti ally eligible patients will be 
enrolled for screening, provi de Inform ed Consent, and undergo screening for all applicable 
inclusio n/excl usion criteria. Patients can enter screening as soon as laboratory results for eGFR 
are available, provided the patient meets the inclusion/excl usion criteria. The total  duration of 
the pre -screening and screening periods should not exceed 28 days.
Patients with a recent (within 1 month) laboratory  results for eGFR that meet the protocol 
mandated criteria can enter the screening period directly without pre-screening procedures 
needing to be performed.
Patients who do not qualify for the protocol based upon their pre -screening or screening results 
may have addi tional attem pts to qualify. There may be no more than 3 attem pts in total. If the 
patient failed to qualify during screening period (including, but not limited due to study supplies, 
equipment failure, unforeseen personal events that mandate missed screening visits, or out -of-
range laboratory /clinical tests), the patient may potenti ally be re-screened. These cases shoul d 
be discussed with the Ast raZeneca Moni tor and docum ented in the Invest igator Study  File (ISF). 
The Invest igator may use his/her judgment regarding the interval between screening periods. 
The Investi gator must track allattem pts in the form  of a log at the site. Screening will be 
followed by a 24-week randomized treatm ent period. Patients who complete the treatm ent 
periodwill be asked to return for an end -of-study  visit at Week 28.
Investigational product, dosage and mo de of administration
For patients rando mized to treatm ent with saxagliptin, saxagliptin 5mg tablets and sitaglipi tin 
placebo capsules will be administered orally  once daily for a 24-week treatm ent period for 
patients wi th an eGFR ≥50 m L/min/1.73 m2.  For p atients wi th an eGFR <50 m L/min/1.73 m2, 
the dose of saxaglipt in will be adjusted to 2.5 mg.
For patients rando mized to treatm ent with sitagliptin, sitaglipt in 100 mg capsules and 
saxagliptin placebo tablets will be administered orally once daily  for a 24-week treatm ent period 
for pati ents wi th an eGFR ≥50 mL/min/1.73 m2.  For pati ents wi th an eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73 
m2, the dose of sitagliptin will be adjusted to 50 mg. 
Saxaglipt in placebo tablets and sitaglipt in placebo capsules will be administered orally  once 
daily  for a 24 -week treatment period for patients rando mized to receive placebo.
Statistical methods
To demonstrate non -inferiority of saxaglipt in compared to placebo for the change fro m baseline 
to W eek 24 in LVEDV index with an assumed non-inferiori ty margin of 6.5 mL/m2 , (This is

11(85)an estimate of the NI margin fro m publicat ion [Foster et al]) and assuming a standard deviatio n 
(SD) of  15 m L/m2, and at a 1 -sided significance level o f 0.025, approximately  88 pati ents will 
be needed in each treatment gro up to provide approximately 80% power (given a true difference 
of zero between saxaglipt in and placebo). Assuming that 20% of patients have a missing
endpo int assessment, a total of approximately 330 patients (110 patients in each of the 3 
treatm ent groups) must be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to saxaglipt in, sitaglipt in, and placebo.  
Note, that the actual NI margin for the study  will be calculated as 10% of  the overall  baseline 
mean LVEDV index across all treatm ent groups.  Non-inferiorit y will be demonstrated if the 
upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in treatments (saxaglipt in minus 
placebo) is less than the NI margin.
Rando mization will be stratified by eGFR status and SGLT -2 inhibitor use, based on potential 
impact on the primary  endpoint. 
For purely  administrative reasons, the randomizat ion will also be stratified by regio nal drug 
distribut ion center to improve the effici ency  of drug all ocati on.
LVEDV index and other continuous variables collected at only  one visi t during randomizati on 
treatm ent period (LVESV index, LVEF, and LVM by MRI, etc.) will be analyzed using analysis 
of covari ance (ANCOVA) for the change from basel ine at Week 24, with term s for treatm ent 
group, eGFR category  (<50, ≥50 mL/min/1.73 m2), SGLT -2 inhibitor use, region, and baseline 
value as covariates in the model. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated 
for the adjusted mean chan ges within each treatment group as well as for the differences in 
adjusted m ean changes between treatment groups.
NT-proBNP and other continuous variables co llected at more than one visit during randomized 
treatm ent period (biomarkers, HbA1c, body  weight, percent change of plasma volume by 
Strauss formula, blood pressure, etc.) will be analyzed using a mixed -model repeated -measures 
(MMRM) approach with terms for treatm ent group, eGFR category  (<50, ≥50 mL/min/1.73 
m2), SGLT -2 inhibitor use, regi on, baseline value, time (each rel evant visi t), the interacti on of 
treatm ent and time, and the interaction of baseline value and time in the model.  Point estimates 
and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the adjusted mean changes within each 
treatm ent group, as well as for the differences in adjusted mean changes between treatm ent 
groups.  Biomarkers or data with extrem ely skewed distribut ion may be log transform ed prior 
to ANCOVA or MMRM analysis.
Plasma concentrations o f saxagliptin, 5 -hydroxy  saxaglipt in and sitaglipt in will be used to 
develop exploratory  PK/PD m odels, which may be reported separately from the clinical study  
report.
The efficacy analyses will be performed based on the full analysis set (FAS ). No m ultiplicity 
control  will be applied for t he statist ical comparisons.
Safety analyses for the doubl e-blind treatm ent period will be per formed using the safet y analysis 
set, including data after the addition of glycemic concomitant medication or change of heart 
failure concomitant medication.  Safety analyses will include, where appropri ate, descript ive

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study
Type 2 Di abetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic progressive disease, characterized by
hyperglycemia and an increased risk of microvascular and macrovascular complicat ions.  CV 
disease is by  far the greatest cause of death in individuals wit h diabetes ( Skyler et al 2009 ).  
Diabetes is also a significant and often underappreciated risk factor for the development of 
heart failure.  Diabetics are 2.5
 -
fold more likely to devel op HF than pat ients without di abetes, 
(Nichols et al 2004 ).  The pathogenesis o f heart failure among pat ients with diabetes is 
multifactorial with coro nary artery  disease, hypertensio n, diabet ic cardio myopathy, and 
extracellular fluid expansio n playing maj or contributory  roles (Foster et al 1998 , 
Gilbert and 
Krum 2015 ).  
Therapeut ic options for treatment of T2DM in patients with heart failure are more limited, as 
there is uncertaint y about the safet y of many diabetes therapi es in these pat ients.  There is a 
need for carefully performed studies to characterize the safet y of newer therapi es in pat ients 
with known HF.

22 (85 )Saxaglipt in is a highly potent, select ive, reversible, and compet itive dipept idyl pept idase -4 
(DPP4) inhibitor.  DPP4 is the enzyme responsible for the inact ivation of glucagon -like 
pepti de-1 (GLP -1) and gastric inhibitory  polypept ide (GIP).  By inhibit ing the enzyme DPP4, 
saxagliptin potentiates active endogenous GLP -1 concentrations, augmenting the 
physio logical mechanism of insulin secretion and decreasing glucagon release, thereby  
reducing postprandial and fast ing glucose levels in patients with T2DM.  The clinical 
development program for saxaglipt in supports its effi cacy in a wi de range of pat ients with 
T2DM, as monotherapy , as add -on therapy  (to m etformin, a sulfo nylurea, a thiazo lidinedio ne 
(TZD), or i nsulin), and as init ial therapy in co mbination with metformin.  Saxaglipt in has a 
well-established safet y profile, w ith a low ri sk of hypoglycemia and weight neutralit y 
(Hirshberg et al  2014 ). Details on the efficacy  and safet y of saxagliptin can be found in the 
ONGLYZA™ prescribing information and Invest igator Brochure.  
Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes 
Mellitus (the SAVOR study) 
SAVOR was designed to invest igate the cardiovascular safet y of saxaglipt in.  It was a 
multicenter, randomized, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled study in 16492 pat ients with type 2 
diabetes who had a history  of, or were at risk for, cardiovascular events that followed pat ients 
for a median of 2.1 y ears. SAVOR enro lled 2105 patients (12.8%) with a prior history  of 
heart failure; 2576 (15.6%) had impaired renal function (eGFR ≤50 m L/min). The SAVOR 
study  met its primary  safet y object ive by demo nstrating saxaglipt in was non -inferior to 
placebo for the primary  com posite MACE endpoint of CV death, n on-fatal MI, or non -fatal 
ischemic stroke; hazard ratio (HR) 1.00 (95% CI 0.89, 1.12).  However, superiorit y of 
saxagliptin versus placebo on the composite MACE endpoint was not demonstrated 
(p=0.986).  For the secondary  com posite endpoint of non -fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, CV death, 
hospi talizati on for heart failure (hHF), hospitalizatio n for unstable angina, or hospitalizat ion 
for coronary  revasculari zation, no statistically  significant treatm ent differences were observed 
between saxagliptin and placebo ( HR 1.02 [95% CI 0.94, 1.11]; nominal p=0.662 for a 
difference between the 2 treatment groups).  However, for the hHF co mponent of the 
secondary  com posite endpoint, m ore events were observed wit h saxaglipt in treatment 
compared wi th placebo (3.5% [289/8280 p atients] versus 2.8% [228/8212 patients]; HR 1.27; 
95% CI 1.07, 1.51; nominal p=0.007).  There is no definit ive mechanism to explain the hHF 
findings in SAVOR.  No signal for heart failure was observed in preclinical studies, other 
studi es in the clinical devel opment program , or in post -market ing surveillance.  
No heart failure signal was observed in TECOS (Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular Outcomes 
after Treatm ent wi th Sitaglipt in).  TECOS was a mult icenter, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled stu dy in 14671 patients with type with T2DM and established CV disease.  
Sitagliptin was non -inferior to placebo for the primary  com posite outcom e of CV death, 
nonfatal  myocardi al infarct ion, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina (HR 
0.98 [9 5% CI 0.88 to 1.09]; p=0.99 for superiorit y; p<0.001 for non -inferiorit y).  Rates of 
hHF di d not differ between the 2 groups (HR 1.00 [95% CI 0.83 to 1.20]; p=0.98, Green et al 
2015 ).  Reasons for the lack of a heart failure signal in TECOS, compared wit h SAVOR, may 
relate to differences in pat ient populat ions, the ty pe of  background care provided, the

23 (85 )capturing and adjudicat ion of hHF events, difference s among DPP4 inhibitors, or play  of 
chance.   
1.1.1 Rationale for the study design, doses, treatment and control groups
Because no mechanism for the increase in hHF observed in SAVOR has been ident ified, the 
current study  is planned to invest igate whether treat ment with saxaglipt in might affect cardiac 
dimensio ns, cardi ac function, changes in plasma volume, and relevant blood and urine 
biomarkers.
This is a 24- week, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, pl acebo -controlled, m ulticenter 
study .  Approximately 3 30 patients with T2DM and HF will be randomized in equal 
proporti ons (110 patients per group) to treatment with saxaglipt in, sitaglipt in, or placebo.  The 
study’s primary object ive is to exclude a meaningful increase in left ventricular end diastolic 
(LVED V) index of greater than 10% for saxaglipt in co mpared with placebo using magnet ic 
resonance imaging (MRI).  The rationale for choosing this endpo int is based on the findings of 
the Vildaglipt in in Ventricular Dysfunction Diabetes (VIVIDD) study .  VIVIDD wa s an 
echocardiographic study  performed in pat ients with HF and LVEF <40%.  The study  met its 
primary  endpoint of non -inferi ority between vildaglipt in versus placebo for a change in LVEF 
over 52 weeks, but unexpectedly  found that treatm ent wi th vildagliptin was associated with a 
significant increase in LVEDV and a trend towards an increase in left ventricular end systolic 
volume (LVESV, McMurr ay et al  2013 ).  For the present study , LVEDV index will be the 
primary  endpoint and cardi ac MRI, rather than echocardiography , has been chosen for the 
assessment of the primary  endpoint because of its high accuracy  and reproducibilit y (Grothues 
et al 2002 ). 
Events of hHF occurred at a consistent rate throughout the SAVOR study .  However, m ost of  
the difference in the rate of events between saxagliptin and placebo accrued in the first 6 to 
9months of treatment, with litt le increase in this difference afterward.  The MRI primary 
endpo int analysis will be conducted at 24 weeks (by which time over three -fourths of the hHF 
events in SAVOR had occurred) to also invest igate the potential for remodelling changes to 
occur.  
In addit ion to the saxaglipt in and placebo arms, there is another active antidiabetic treatment 
arm sitaglipt in.  Sitaglipt in has been chosen as a reference DPP4 inhibitor that has not been 
associ ated with an increase in hHF in TECOS. 
Sitagliptin
Sitagliptin is an orally  active DPP4 inhibitor that i s marketed as JANUVIA™ (Merck & Co) 
for use as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults wit h T2DM.  
Details on the efficacy and safet y of sitaglipt in can be found in the JANUVIA™ prescribing 
inform ation.

24 (85 )1.2 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
As stated in Sect ion 1.1, an exces s in heart failure hospitalizations was observed in the 
SAVOR trial.  However, a mechanism to explain these findings has yet to be identified and an 
increase in hospitalizat ion for heart failure was not observed in the TECOS study  with 
sitaglipt in.  Saxagl iptin and sitagliptin are effect ive anti -diabet ic agents that have been 
extensively  studied in clinical tri als, are approved worldwide, and have substant ial 
postm arket ing experience with well -established safet y profiles.  For information on 
saxagliptin, pl ease consult the respect ive Investigator Brochure; for sitaglipt in, please refer to 
its Product Label.
Benefit s related to parti cipat ion in this trial include close fo llow-up of  a pati ent’s diabetes and 
treatm ent wi th anti-diabetes agents that are both eff icacious and well tolerated.   While one of 
the three possible treatments is placebo, patients will cont inue to be treated with their current 
anti-glycemic regiments as background therapy .  Furtherm ore, appropri ate rescue therapy  for 
worsening glycemic con trol shoul d be implemented if required, as recommended in Sect ion 
7.7.2.1 .  
Although the findings from SAVOR suggest that saxaglipt in therapy coul d potenti ally resul t 
in an increased risk for hospitalizat ion for heart failure, patients in this study  will be cl osely 
monitored for si gns and symptom s of worsening heart failure with frequent study  visits.  In 
SAVOR, therapy  with saxaglipt in was not asso ciated with an increase in CV death, 
myocardial  infarct ion, or stroke, even amo ng patients with baseline risk factors for hHF.  As 
previously discussed, sitaglipt in has not been associated with an increase in hHF.
Further, study  data on cardiac funct ion, biomarkers, and plasma vo lume may result in 
improved patient management, on both an individual and populat ion basis.
1.3 Study Design 
This is a multic enter, randomized, doubl e-blind, parallel group, placebo -controlled study  to 
investigate the effects of saxagl iptin on cardi ac dimensio ns and function, in patients with 
T2DM and HF with abnorm al systolic function from both ischemic and non-ischemic causes. 
Approximately 330 pat ients with docum ented LVEF ≤45% and NT -proBNP > 300pg/mL will 
be rando mized in equal  proportions (110 patients per group) to treatm ent with saxaglipt in, 
sitaglipt in, or placebo. The calculated sample size is expected to yield approximately 
88patients per group with complete data (ie, patients with anonmissing primary endpo int 
assessment). In this study , sites will perform a  p re-study  screening assessment prior to 
enrollment visit to screen for eGFR criteria. Patients must have an estimated glomerular 
filtrat ion rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2at pre-screening to qualify for enrollment. 
Following Inform ed Consent, all potenti ally eligible patients will be enrolled and undergo 
screening for all applicable inclusio n/exclusion criteri a. The pre -screening value of eGFR can 
be used to qualify  a pati ent for randomizat ion.

25 (85 )Patients can enter screening as soon as laboratory  pre-screening results for eGFR are available 
provi ded the pati ent m eets the inclusio n/excl usion criteria.  The total duration of the pre -
screening and screening periods should not exceed 28days. 
Patients with a recent (wi thin 1 m onth) eGFR value will be allowed to enter the screening 
directly wit hout pre -screening procedures performed.
Patients who do not qualify  for the protocol  based upon their pre -screening or screening 
resul ts may have addit ional attem pts to qualify . There may  be no m ore than 3 attem pts in 
total.If the patient failed to qualify during screening period (including, b ut not limit ed due to 
study  supplies, equi pment failure, unforeseen personal events that mandate missed screening 
visits, or out -of-range l aboratory /clinical  tests), the pati ent m ay potentially be re -screened. 
These cases should be discussed with the Astra Zeneca Monitor and documented in the 
Invest igator Study  File (ISF). The invest igator may use his/her judgment regarding the 
interval  between screening periods. The Invest igator must track all attempts in the form of a 
log at the si te.Re-screened pat ientsshoul d re-sign informed consent on the re -screening 
visit. All procedures fro m screening period should be repeated.
The study  will com prise a pre -screening period (optional –see sect ion 3.3) and screening 
period that in total should not exceed 28days, a 24 -week randomized treatment period and a 
4-week fo llow up peri od.  After randomizat ion, patients will visit the study  site for study 
assessments at Weeks 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24.  Follow -up telephone calls will be conducted at 
Day 7, Week 3, and Week 9.  Patients who complete the treatm ent peri odwill be asked to 
return for an end -of-study  visit at Week 28.  The schedule of study  assessments i s shown in 
Table 2.
Study  treatm ent will be administered once daily , according to randomized treatment 
allocat ion.  For pati ents wi th an eGFR ≥50 mL/min/1.73 m2, the doses of the acti ve treatm ents 
are as fo llows: saxagliptin 5 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg.  For patients with an eGFR <50 
mL/min/1.73 m2, the doses of the active treatments will be adjusted as fo llows: saxagliptin 2.5 
mg and sitaglipt in 50 mg.  
MRI to evaluate cardi ac dimensi ons, and funct ion will be performed at baseline (<= 7 day s 
prior to randomizat ion), and at Week 24 (<= 7 days prior to Week 24) for all study  patients.  
The Week 24 MRI will provide the primary endpoint data.  The MRI evaluations will be 
perform ed according to a standard protocol and will be centrally  read by  a core l aboratory .  
Changes in plasma vo lume will be measured using the Strauss formula, as has been utilized in 
the EPHESUS study  (Kalra et al  2002 ; Strauss et al 1951 ; Rossigno l PR et al  2011 ).
During the study , pati ents will  cont inue to receive their usual, stable treatment regimens for 
diabetes and HF as prescribed by their physicians.  Medicat ions for di abetes and HF, 
including diuretic dose, should cont inue unchanged, unless there is a change in the patient’s 
clinical status.  Changes in diabetes and HF medications, including dose, must be recorded in 
the electronic case report form (eCRF).  In cases where doses of medications , including 
diuretics, requi re adj ustment, pati ents shoul d be encouraged to remain in the trial and

the study
25. Unable or u nwilling to provide written informed consent
Procedures for withdrawal of incorrectly  enrolled pati ents see Secti on 3.4.
3.3 Patient pre -screening, enrollment and randomization
Invest igators must keep a record of patients who entered pre- screening in the form of a log 
with assigned code associated with the Lab Kit used for pre -screening procedures. The pre -
screening visit will not be captured in the eCRF. The invest igator shall also keep a log of all 
patients who entered screening. Patients with a recent (within 1 mo nth) eGFR value (the Scr 
value used for the eGFR calculat ion should be accurate to two decimal places) will be allowed 
to enter the screening direct ly without pre -screening procedures performed and only the main 
inform ed consent form  will be signed.  See section 4.1.1 .
Patients who do not qualify  for the protocol  based upon their pre -screening or screening 
resul ts may have addit ional attem pts to qualify . There may  be no m ore than 3 attem pts in 
total.If the patient failed to qualify during screening period (including, but not limit ed due to 
study  supplies, equi pment failure, unforeseen personal events that mandate missed screening 
visits, or out -of-range l aboratory /clinical  tests), the pati ent m aypotentially be re -screened. 
These cases should be discussed with the AstraZeneca Monitor and documented in the 
Invest igator Study  File (ISF). The invest igator may use his/her judgment regarding the 
interval  between screening periods. The Invest igator must track all attempts in the form of a 
log at the si te.Re-screened pat ients should re -sign informed consent on the re -screening 
visit. All procedures fro m screening period should be repeated.
The Investigators will:
1. Obtain signed informed consent fro m thepotenti al patient before any  study  specific 
procedures are performed.  Separate, specific ICFs will be co llected before pre -
screening and screening procedures.
2. Assign the patient a unique pre -screening code associated with Lab Kit used for 
pre-screening p rocedures.

Study Code D1680C00016
Edition Number 5.0
Date 14 February 2020
34 (85 )After posit ive verificat ion of pre -screening criteria, the invest igator will assign 
potenti al patients a uni que enrollment number via IVRS/IWRS beginning with 
‘E#’ during screening.
3. Determine patient eligibilit y. See Secti ons 3.1and 3.2
At the rando mizat ion visit, once the patient is confirmed to be eligible, the Principal 
Invest igator or suitably trained delegate will:
4. Assign the eligible patient a unique rando mizat ion number via IVRS/IWRS.
If a patient withdraws fro m participat ion in the study , then his/her enrollment/randomizatio n 
code cannot be reused.
Randomization codes will be assigned strict ly sequent ially as pati ents beco me eligible for
rando mizat ion.
3.4 Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomized 
patients
Patients who fail to meet the eligibilit y criteria shoul dnot, under any  circumstances, be 
enrolled or receive study  medicat ion.  There can be no except ions to this rule. Patients who 
are enrolled, but subsequent ly found not to m eet all  the eligibilit y criteria must not be 
rando mized or init iated on treatment.
Where a patient does not meet all the eligibilit y criteri a but i s rando mized in error, or 
incorrectly  started on treatm ent, the invest igator should inform the AstraZeneca study  
physician immediately, and a discussio n should occur between the AstraZeneca stu dy 
physician and the invest igator regarding whether to continue or discont inue the patient fro m 
treatm ent. The AstraZeneca study  physician m ust ensure all decisio ns are appropriately 
docum ented.
3.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups
Eligible pat ients wil l be randomized to receive either saxaglipt in or sitagliptin orally once 
daily  or matching pl acebo in a 1:1:1 (saxagliptin, sitaglipt in, placebo) ratio using the 
IVRS/IWRS system.   
Randomization will be stratified by eGFR status and SGLT -2 inhibitor use, based on potential 
impact on the primary  endpoint. 
For purely  administrative reasons, the randomizat ion will also be stratified by regio nal drug 
distribut ion centre to improve the efficiency o f drug allocat ion.
The proporti on of  rando mized patients with an eGFR of ≥30and <50 mL/min/1.73 m2will be 
limited to 30% or a maximum of 99 patients.  
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance saxagliptin
Study Code D1680C00016
Edition Number 5.0
Date 14 February 2020
35(85)For pati ents wi th an eGFR ≥50 mL/min/1.73 m2, the doses of the active treatments are as 
follows: saxaglipt in 5 mg and sitaglipt in 100 mg.  For patients with an eGFR <50 
mL/min/1.73 m2, the doses of the active treatments will be adjusted as fo llows: saxagliptin 2.5 
mg and sitaglipt in 50 mg.
If a patient is discont inued fro m the study , his/her randomizat ion or enrollment number will 
not be reused, and the patient will not be allowed to re -enter the study.  Rando mized pat ients 
who discont inue early fro m the study  will not be repl aced.
3.6 Methods for ensuring blinding
Invest igational product (IP, also referred to as ‘study  drug’ in this protocol) will be labelled 
using a uni que m aterial kit ID, which i s linked to the randomization code.  The IVRS/IWRS 
will assign the bottles of study  material to be dispensed to each pati ent.  Thi s is a doubl e-blind 
study  wherein each patient will receive eit her the active drug or matching pla cebo.  The active 
drug and pl acebo tabl ets and capsules will be identical and presented in ident ical packaging to 
ensure blinding of the medicat ion.
3.7 Methods for unblinding 
Individual treatment codes, indicat ing the treatment allo cation for each rando mized patient, 
will be available to the invest igator(s) or pharmacists from the IVRS/IWRS. Routines for this 
will be described in the IVRS/IWRS user manual that will be provided to each center.
The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emergenci es when the appropriate 
management of the patient requires knowledge of the treatment randomizat ion.  The 
investigator documents and reports the action to AstraZeneca, without revealing the treatment 
given to patient to the AstraZeneca staff.
AstraZeneca r etains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are 
suspected to be causally  related to an invest igational product and that potentially  require 
expedited reporting to regulatory  authori ties.  Treatm ent codes will not be broken for the 
planned analyses of data until all decisio ns on the evaluabilit y of the data from  each individual 
patient have been m ade and docum ented.
The fo llowing personnel will be unblinded as to the exact content of invest igational treatments
(ie, the randomizat ion code):
Personnel carrying out the packaging and labelling of invest igational treatment
Personnel generat ing the randomization list.                                                                                                                              
Personnel analyzing the pharmacokinet ic samples.
Personnel overseeing the overall supply chain.

which will be maintained in a secure locat ion unt il after cl ean file and database lock have been 
declared.  T he sole exception will be in the event the PI determines knowledge of 
investigat ional treatm ent allocat ion to be essent ial for appropri ate clinical management of a 
patient.
The rando mizat ion list will be kept in a secure location unt il the end of the study .
3.8 Restrictions
The fo llowing restri ctions apply while the patient is receiving study  drug and for the specified 
times before and after:
Once screened and qualified for entry , pati ents will  be instructed as follows:
 Fast for at least 8 hours prior to the randomization visit and each study site visit at 
which fast ing plasma glucose is obtained (Weeks 6, 12, and 24, as well as Week 18 
if the pat ient was rescued at Week 12), ie, no food or beverage except water, until 
glycemic assessments scheduled for that day  are perform ed.  All owed m edicati ons 
can be taken with water only*. Delay administering the IPs (as applicable) on the 
day of the clinic visit and bring study  medicat ion to each study  site visi t*
 Refrain fro m alcohol intake and intense exercise 24 hours prior to each visit and 
recommend not to use tobacco/nicotine within 12 hours prior to each visit*
 Do not donate blood for the duration of the study  and for 3 m onths fo llowing the 
last study  visit
 Com ply wi th prescri bed dosing regimen to preserve study  integrity and ensure 
patient safet y 
 Discuss any new prescriptions and over -the-counter or herbal/nutritional therapies 
with the invest igator, as concomitant use could result in alterations to their glycemic 
control  and may place them at risk for significant hypoglycemic episodes
 Women must immediately contact the invest igator if they suspect they might be 
pregnant and if they have changed or plan to change their birth control method. 
*If a patient comes to a visit with out having fo llowed the above instructions, then the pat ient 
shoul d be re -scheduled for the ent ire visit (if possible within the allowed time -window).  The 
Sponsor or designee should be contacted if the investigator is informed of any restrict ion 
violations. 
Women of childbearing potential (including perimenopausal wo men who have had a 
menstrual period within 1 year) must practice, and be willing to continue to practice,

37 (85 )appropriate birth control.  As applicable, all methods must be in effect before the p atient takes 
the first dose of study  medicat ion.
All conco mitant m edicat ions should be captured on the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
The fo llowing m edicat ions are prohibited fro m up to 8 weeks prior to study  rando mizat ion 
and during randomized tre atment:
 Incretin therapy  (DPP4 inhibi tors, GLP -1 mimet ics) 
 Therapy  with thiazolidinedio ne agents (TZDs)
 Strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (see section 7.7.3 )
 Background therapy  with stable dosages of SGLT- 2 inhibitors is permitted in 
patients qualifying for the study  and can cont inue during the randomized treatment 
period. SGLT -2 inhibitors cannot be init iated or their dosages modified during 
rando mized tre atment or used as rescue therapy
3.9 Discontinuation of investigational product
Patients m ay be di scontinued from invest igational product (IP) in the fo llowing si tuations:
 Patient deci sion.  The pati ent is at any  time free to discontinue treatment, without 
prejudice to further treatment.  Patients who choose to discontinue study treatment 
are expected to continue in the study  until the end of the study  as described in the 
Secti on 3.9.1 of the protocol.
 Safety reasons as judged by the invest igator or by AstraZen eca representative
 Adverse Event
 Severe non -compliance wi th the study  protocol  as judged by  the invest igator and/or 
AstraZeneca
 Pregnancy (discontinue IP and notify AstraZeneca representative). See Section 6.6
 eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2  
if at any  time the patient ´s eGFR (calculated by MDRD) falls below 
30mL/min/1.73m2 and is confirmed at a repeated calculat ion (the re -test shoul d 
be scheduled within 7 days),  the patient should be discontinued fro m IP
 ALT and/or AST >3 x ULN and TB >2 x ULN
 ALT and/or AST >5 x ULN for ≥14 consecut ive days, at any t ime after init ial 
confirmatory  resul ts

Edition Number 5.0
Date 14 February 2020
38 (85 ) ALT and /or AST >8 x ULN
 Incorrectly enrolled patients (see Secti on 3.4)
Cases in which patients are incorrectly randomized (ie, the patient does not meet the required
inclusio n/excl usion criteria for the st udy), should be discussed wit h AstraZeneca 
representative prior to any  actions being taken (see Section 3.4). 
3.9.1 Procedures for discontinuation of a patient from investigational product 
At any time, pat ients are free to discont inue investigational product or withdraw from the stud y 
(ie, invest igational product and assessments –see Secti on 3.10), without prejudice to further 
treatm ent. A patient who decides to discont inue investigational product will always be asked 
about the reason(s) and the presence of any adverse events. If possible, they will be seen and 
assessed by  an investigator(s). 
All patients that are rando mized will be followed until the end of the study . If a patient 
temporarily  discont inues from study  medicat ion, it is the intention that the scheduled study 
visits, dat a collection and procedures continue according the study protocol unt il the study ends.
If a patient permanent ly discont inues from the study medicat ion, he or she should be asked, at 
the discret ion of the treating physician, to return to the study  site as soon as possible, but not 
later than 7 days fro m last IP dose. All endpo int (Week 24/ETD) assessments, including 
cardi ac MRI, and blood and urine bio marker assessments, must be performed at this visit. All 
study  drugs shoul d be returned by  the pati ent. T hepatient shoul d also be asked to return 4 
weeks later for end of study  (Week 28) assessments. If the patient is unable or unwilling to 
return, a followup by  phone call  should be conducted. Adverse events will be collected 
throughout the treatment period a nd SAEs will be collected up to 4 weeks after the end -of-
study  visit or an Early  Treatment Di scontinuati on Visit(see Sect ion 6.3.1 ). 
Only if a pa tient has explicit ly refused to attend any  visit or to have any  future contact, 
including telephone fo llow up, then the patient is considered to have withdrawn informed 
consent (see Section 3.10.2 ).
3.10 Criteria for withdrawal 
3.10.1 Screen failures 
Screening failures are patients who do not fulfil the eligibilit y criteria for the study , and 
therefore m ust not be randomized.  These patients should have the rea son for study  
withdrawal  recorded as ‘Screen Failure’ (ie. patient does not meet the required 
inclusio n/excl usion criteria).  This reason for study withdrawal is only  valid for screen failures 
(not randomized patients).
3.10.2 Withdrawal of the informed consent
Patients are free to withdraw from the study  at any time (invest igational product and 
assessments), without prejudice to further treatment.
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance saxagliptin
Study Code D1680C00016
Edition Number 5.0
Date 14 February 2020
39(85)A patient who desires to withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) for 
withdrawal  and the presence of any adverse events (AE). The investigator will follow up AEs 
outsi de of the clinical study .  If a pat ient expresses a desire to withdraw fro m the study, modified 
follow up options, including telephone follow up, should be offered as an alternat ive. The 
patient will also be asked if they agree to the use of previously donated, stored biological 
samples for the purposes of research (see Section 5.6.4). Once withdrawal  of consent is 
confirmed, no further patients visits or contact can occur.
3.11 Discontinuation of the study
The study  may be stopped if, in the judgment of Execut ive Co mmittee and AstraZeneca, trial 
patients are placed at undue risk because of clinically  significant findings that:
Meet individual stopping criteria or are otherwise considered significant 
Are assessed as causally related to study  drug
Are not considered to be consistent with cont inuat ion of the study
Regardless of the reason for terminat ion, all data available for th e pati ent at the time of 
discontinuat ion of fo llow-up m ust be recorded in the CRF.  All reasons for discont inuat ion of 
treatm ent m ust be docum ented.
In terminat ing the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate considerat ion is given to the 
protecti on of the pati ents’ interests.

possible but no later than 7 days from the last IP dose.  All endpoint (Week 24 /ETD ) assessments, including an MRI and blood and urine biomarker assessments, must be 
performed at this visit .All study drugs should be returned by the patient. 
cIf no LV assessment has been performed within the 6 months prior to screening.  If required, the test can be performed locall y.
dRANDOMIZATION: The MRI mu st be performed before randomization and drug dispensing but no more than 7 days prior to Day 1. The MRI scan of acceptable 
quality must be confirmed before the patient is randomized and takes study medication. If a repeat MRI is required, it may be perfor med within 7 days of the prior scan 
and the randomization visit should be rescheduled if necessary to allow confirmation of quality before randomization and dosi ng.
WEEK 24: An MRI scan of acceptable quality must be confirmed before the visit occurs . There fore, the MRI can be performed in advance of the planned visit but no 
more than 7 days. If a repeat MRI is required, it may be performed within 7 days of the prior scan. If necessary, the Week 24 visit should be re -scheduled until after the 
MRI has been qu alified as acceptable and the patient should continue study medication.
cMRI assessment must be performed and approved according to Investigator Site Operations Manual and Image Acquisition Guideli ne.
A urine pregnancy test must be performed in women of child bearing potential before each MRI.

The study  will com prise a pre -screening and screening periods of up to 28 day s.  Study  
procedures and timing required during enrollment/screening period are indicated in the Study  
Plan, Table 2.      
At pre-screening and screening, consent ing patients are assessed to ensure that they meet 
eligibilit y criteria.  Pati ents who do not meet these criteria must not be enrolled in the study.
All patients will be required to provide consent to supply bio logical  samples for entry  into this 
study .  This consent is included in the main pat ient informed consent form. 
Patients who do not qualify  for the protocol  based upon t heir pre -screening or screening 
resul ts may have addit ional attem pts to qualify . There may  be no m ore than 3 attem pts in 
total.If the patient failed to qualify during screening period (including, but not limit ed due to 
study  supplies, equi pment failure, unforeseen personal events that mandate missed screening 
visits, or out -of-range l aboratory /clinical  tests), the pati ent m ay potentially be re -screened. 
These cases should be discussed with the AstraZeneca Monitor and documented in the 
Invest igator Study  File (ISF). The invest igator may use his/her judgment regarding the 
interval  between screening periods. The Invest igator must track all attempts in the form of a 
log at the si te.Re-screened pat ients should re -sign informed consent on the re -screening 
visit. All procedures fro m screening period should be repeated
4.1.1 Pre-screening Informed Consent Form & Informed Consent Form (ICF)
The Pre -screening informed consent for Protocol D1680C00016 is an abbreviated document 
that explains the risks associated with the screening laboratory  tests for eGFR performed to 
assess qualification to the study . This docum ent will provide only general i nformation about 
the study , without the need to provide any specific details about the study  procedures, and 
risks or benefits fro m study  parti cipat ion.  The Pre -screening ICF will also document the 
patient’s consent to return to the enrollment visit (Visi t 1) in case they  are consi dered eligible 
for the study . 
For any  patient that undergoes the pre -screening procedure and is considered eligible to 
participate in the study , the full Informed Consent for Protocol D1680C00016 will be 
provi ded at the enrollme nt (Visit 1) See section 10.4.

At screening, all conco mitant m edicat ions will be recorded.  All new conco mitant medicat ion 
started during the treatment period must be reported.  See Section 7.7for more informat ion on 
concomitant medicat ions.
4.1.5 Inclusion/Exclusion criteria
Patients will  be assessed to ensure that they  meet eligibilit y criteria.  Patients who do not meet 
these cri teria must not be enrolle d in the study .
4.1.6 Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
Estimated GFR will be calculated from serum creatinine ( Scr) according to the Modification o f 
Diet in Renal  Disease (MDRD) form ula and the eGFR value will be provided wit h accuracy to 
two decimal places.
Estimated GFR will be calculated using the MDRD formula ( Levy  et al  2006 ):
eGFR (mL/ min/1.73 m2) = 175 x (S cr)-1.154x (Age)-0.203x 1.212 (if African American) x (0.742 if female) 
For the purpose of eGFR calculat ion the creatinine value will be provided with accuracy to 
two decimal places. 
The eGFR will be used for verification of patient eligibilit y criteria during pre -screening, and 
will also be calculated at randomization and visi t 6 (week 6), vi sit 8 (week 12) and visit 10 
(week 24).  It will also be used to determine the dosage of saxaglipt in and sitaglipt in at 
rando mizat ion and the need for dose adjust ment during the treatment period.  Please refer to 
Secti on 7.2.
Patients who, duri ng the course of the study , develop eGFR <50mL/min/1.73m2based on the 
central  laboratory  serum  creat inine value, will be scheduled for a fo llow-up visit (within 7 
days) to obtain a second central laboratory  serum  creatinine val ue and to repeat the cal culat ion 
of eGFR. If the repeat eGFR is still <50mL/min/1.73m2, the pati ent’s dose of IP will be 
adjusted. The pati ent m ust be invi ted for an addi tional visit to receive the down -titrated IP 
within 3 days after results arrival at the site.
The dose adjust ments will be to 2.5 mg saxaglipt in, 50 m g sitagliptin, or m atching placebo. 
Once reduced to 2.5 mg saxaglipt in, 50 mg sitagliptin or placebo, there will be no further 
dose-adjust ment even if the eGFR subsequent ly increased sufficient ly to meet init ial 
requi rements for the 5 mg saxaglipt in and 10 0 mg sitaglipt in dosing regimen.  The 
IVRS/IWRS will be used to allocate the adjusted IP.
If at any  time the patient ´s eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73m2and confirmed at a repeated 
calculat ion (the re -test shoul d be scheduled within 7 day s), the patient sh ould be discont inued 
from IP, see Secti on 3.9.1 .

shoul d be rescheduled if necessary to allow confirmat ion of qualit y before rando mizat ion and 
dosing.
At Wee k 24 an MRI scan of acceptable qualit y must be confirmed before the visit occurs. 
Therefore, the MRI can be performed in advance of the planned visit but no more than 7 days. 
If a repeat MRI is required, it may  be perform ed wi thin 7 days of the poor -qualit y scan query  
received. If necessary , the Week 24 visit should be re -scheduled unt il after the MRI has been 
qualified as acceptable and the patient should continue study  medicat ion.
The cMRI assessment must be performed and approved according to Invest igator Si te 
Operati ons Manual  and Im age Acquisi tion Guideline.
A urine pregnancy test must be performed before each MRI in women o f child bearing 
potenti al.
The cardiac MRI will be reviewed locally  by a qualified physician for incidental 
findings. Any inciden tal findings o f potenti al clinical  significance should be communicated 
directly to the investigator and then evaluated and handled by the invest igator as per standard

5.2.2 Physical examination
5.2.2.1 Complete physical examination
A co mplete physical examinat ion will be performed at screening and include an assessme nt of 
the following: general  appearance, skin inspect ion, lymph nodes, thy roid, abdo men, 
musculoskeletal/extremit ies, CV system, lungs, and reflexes.  The results of the complete 
physical examinat ion will be recorded for the screening visit, randomizat ion visit (Day  1), 
visit 8 (Week 12), and visit 10 (Week 24).  The baseline physical examinat ion is performed at 
the screening visit (Visit 1).  
5.2.2.2 Brief physical examination
The brief physical examinat ion will focus on signs and symptoms of heart failure at Vi sit 4 
(Week 2), 6 (Week 6), 9 (Week 18), and End -of-Study  Visi t (Week 28).  
5.2.3 Vital signs 
Vital signs will  be assessed fo llowing the study  plan (see Table 2). Weight will be measured 
as part of vital signs.  The patient’s weight will be recorded in kilograms, to 1 decimal place, 
with light cl othing and no shoes.  The patient’s height will be recorded in cent imeters, with no 
shoes.  Height will be measured as part of vital signs at Visit 1 only.
Pulse and seated BP will be measured twice (5 minutes apart) before any  blood sam pling i s 
done using a standardized cuff adapted to the size of the patient’s arm after the patient has 
been sitt ing and restin g for least 5 minutes.  For timings of assessments see Table 2.
5.2.4 Other safety assessments
5.2.4.1 CV Events Adjudication Committee
An independent Events Adjudi cation Co mmit teewill be appo inted and will adjudicate all CV 
events (including hHF).  The committee members will not have access to individual treatment 
codes for any  patient or clinical efficacy and safet y event.  The precise responsibilit ies and 
procedu res applicable for the Committee will be detailed in a separate Adjudicat ion Manual.
For all CV events identified for adjudicat ion, the investigator will co mplete the appropriate 
modules o f the eCRF and provide source documentation.  Guidance for reporting CV events i s 
provi ded in the Event Reporting Manual.

5.3.1 Collection of samples
In a subset of at least 150 patients, blood samples for determinat ion of saxaglipt in, 5-hydroxy 
saxagliptin, and sitaglipt in in plasma will be taken at the times p resented in the study  plan 
(Table 2).
Samples will  be collected, l abelled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory  Manual. 
Patients shoul d be instructed to provide the exact time of the dose taken the previous day .  
This information and the time of the sample draw will be entered into CRF. 
5.3.2 Determination of drug concentration
Samples for determination of drug concentration in plasma will be analyzed by  Covance on 
behalf o f AstraZeneca, using an appropriate bioanalyt ical method.  
The rando mizat ion code will be provided to ensure that only samples fro m patients who were 
on activ e study  treatm ent are analyzed.  Samples from patients not dosed with the relevant 
active study  treatment will only be analyzed on a ‘for cause’ basis, for example, if there is 
suspicio n that a patient has been dosed incorrectly.
The treatment allocat ion inform ation will be kept in a secure location unt il the end of the 
study .
Full details o f the analy tical method used will be described in separate bioanaly tical reports.
5.3.3 Storage and destruction of pharmacokinetic samples
Pharmacokinet ic (PK) samples will be disposed of after the Bioanalyt ical Report finalizat ion 
or6 months after issuance of the draft bioanaly tical report (whi chever is earlier), unless 
requested for future analyses.
Pharmacokinet ic samples may be dispose d of or destroy ed and anonymized by pooling. 
Addit ional analyses m ay be conducted on the anonymized, pooled pharmacokinet ic samples 
to further evaluate and validate the analyt ical method. Any result s from such analyses may  be 
reported separately  from the CSR.
Incurred sample reproducibilit y analysis, if any , will  be perform ed al ongside the bioanalysis 
of the test samples.   The results fro m the evaluat ion will not be reported in the Clinical Study  
Report but separately  in a Bioanaly tical Report.
Any residua l sample rem aining after PK analysis has been performed may  be used for 
exploratory  biomarker research and characterizat ion of metabo lites.

correl ations with study  endpoints and effects of study  drug.  The bio markers assessed in the 
study  include NT -proBNP, , given their 
associ ation to CV ri sk.  Addi tional bl ood and urine sam ples m ay be assayed either during the 
study  or stored for potential future analyses of other renal, cardiac, inflammato ry, and 
metabo lic disease -specific bio markers.  Those measurements, as well as other potential 
relevant bi omarkers, will be performed at Sponsor`s discret ion and for the purpose of this 
protocol  only .
5.6.1 Storage, re -use and destruction of biological samples
Samples will  be stored for a m aximum  of 15 y ears fro m the date of the l ast subject’s last visit, 
after whi ch they  will be destroyed.  The results of this bio marker research will be reported 
either in the Clinical Study  Report i tself or as an addendum, or se parately in a scient ific report 
or publicat ion.  The results of this bio marker research may be pooled with bio marker data 
from other studies with the study  drug to generate hypotheses to be tested in future research.
5.6.2 Labelling and shipment of biological sa mples
The Principal Invest igator ensures that samples are labelled and shipped in accordance with 
the Laboratory  Manual and the Bio logical Substance, Category  B Regulati ons (m aterials 
containing or suspected to contain infect ious substances that do not mee t Category  A cri teria), 
see Appendix B ‘IATA 6.2 Guidance Document’.
5.6.3 Chain of custody of biological samples 
A full chain o f custody  is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle.
The Principal Invest igator at each center will keep full traceabi lity of collected bi ological 
samples fro m the pati ents while in storage at the center until shipment or disposal (where 
appropriate).  The sample receiver keeps full traceabilit y of the sam ples while in storage and 
during use unt il used or disposed of or u ntil further shipment and keeps documentation of 
recei pt of arrival.
AstraZeneca keeps oversight of the ent ire life cycle through internal procedures, monitoring o f 
study  sites and audi ting of  external  laboratory  providers.
Samples retained for further use are registered by  the AstraZeneca Bio bank team  during the 
entire life cycle.

57(85)5.6.4 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for donated biological samples 
If a patient insists on withdrawing consent from the study , the local invest igator will confi rm 
with the pat ientwhether previously  donated biological  samples can st ill be u sed for the purposes 
of research. In the absence of expressed consent for their use, the biological samples will be 
disposed of/destroy ed, and the action docum ented.  If samples are already  analyzed,
AstraZeneca is not obliged to destroy  the resul ts of this research.
As collect ion of the bio logical samples is an integral part of the study , then the pati ent is 
withdrawn from  further study  parti cipat ion.
The Principal Invest igator:
 Ensures pat ients’withdrawal of informed consent to the use of donated samples is 
properly documented and is notified immediately to AstraZeneca. 
 Ensures that bio logical samples from that patient, if stored at the study  site, are 
immediately  identified, disposed of /destr oyed, and the action documented
 Ensures the laboratory (ies) ho lding the samples is/are informed about the 
withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/destroy ed, the 
action docum ented and the signed document returned to the study  site
 Ensures that the pati ent and AstraZeneca are informed about the sample disposal.
AstraZeneca ensures the central laboratory (ies) ho lding the samples is/are informed about the 
withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/destroy ed and the act ion 
docum ented and returned to the study  site.
6 SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT
The Principal Invest igator is responsible for ensuring that all staff invo lved in the study  are 
familiar wit h the content of this sect ion.
6.1 Definition of adverse events
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condit ion or the deterioration 
of a pre -exist ing medical condit ion following or during exposure to a pharmaceut ical product, 
whether or not considered causally related to the product.  An undesir able medical condit ion 
can be symptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg, tachy cardi a, enlarged liver) or the 
abnorm al resul ts of an investi gation (eg, l aboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  In clinical 
studi es, an AE can include an undesirable medica l condi tion occurring at any  time, incl uding 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study  treatm ent has been administered.
The term  AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs.

58(85)6.1.1 AEs of special interest
The fo llowing are considered to be AEOSI: 
 Hypersensi tivity react ions
 Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR)
 Decreased lymphocy te count
 Pancreat itis
 Cardi ac failure (including confirmed adjudicated cardiac failure events)
 Renal impairment/renal failure
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event
A serious adverse event i s an AE occurring during any study  phase (ie, run -in, treatment, 
washout, follow -up), that fulfils one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:
 Results in death
 Is immediately life -threatening
 Requi res in -patient hospi talizat ion or prolong ation of exist ing hospi talizati on 
 Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y or substantial disrupt ion of 
the abilit y to conduct normal life funct ions
 Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect
 Is an important medical event that may jeopa rdize the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed previously.
For further guidance on the definit ion of a SAE, see Appendix A to the Clinical Study 
Protocol .
6.3 Recording of adverse events
6.3.1 Time period for collection o f adverse events
Adverse events will be collected from t ime of first administration of invest igational product 
throughout the double -blind treatment period (Visit 10, Week 24).
Serious Adverse Events will be collected from signature of screening informed c onsent, 
throughout the double -blind treatment period and unt il the end -of-study  visit (Vi sit 11, Week 
28).

Date 14 February 2020
59(85)6.3.2 Follow -up of unresolved adverse events
Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last visit in the study  are f ollowed up by  the 
investigator for a s long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the CRF. 
AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional informat ion for any  patient with ongoing 
AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if judged necessary .
6.3.3 Variables 
The fo llowing variab les will be collect for each AE:
 AE (verbat im)
 The date and time when the AE started and stopped
 Maximum intensit y
 Whether the AE is serious or not
 Invest igator causalit y rating against the Investigat ional Product (yes or no)
 Action taken with regard to invest igational product
 AE caused patient’s withdrawal fro m study  (yes or no )
 Outcom e
In addit ion, the fo llowing vari ables will be collected for SAEs:
 Date AE m et cri teria for seri ous AE
 Date invest igator became aware of serious AE
 AE is seri ous due to
 Date of hospitalization
 Date of discharge
 Probable cause of death
 Date of death

60 (85 ) Descript ion of AE
The m aximum  intensity of an AE will be rated according to the following definit ion:
 Mild (awareness of sign of symptom but easily tolerated)
 Moderate (di scomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal act ivities)
 Severe (incapacitat ing, with inabilit y to perform  norm al activities)
It is important to dist inguish between serious and se vere AEs.  Severit y is a measure of 
intensity, whereas seriousness is defined by  the criteri a in Sect ion 6.2.   An AE of severe 
intensity need not n ecessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only  a limi ted degree of 
disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.
6.3.4 Causality collection
The invest igator will assess causal relat ionship between investigat ional product and each 
adverse event, and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do y ou consi der that there i s a 
reasonable possibilit y that the event m ay have been caused by  the investi gational product?’
For SAEs causal, relat ionship will also be assessed for other medicat ion and study  procedures 
and addit ional study  drug.  Note that for SAEs tha t coul d be associ ated wi th any study  
procedure the causal relat ionship is implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix A to the Clinical 
Study  Protocol .
6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by  the pati entor reported in response to the open question 
from the study  personnel: Have y ou had any heal th probl ems since the previous visit/y ou were 
last asked, or revealed by  observati on will  be collected and recorded in the CRF.  When 
collect ing AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of 
signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms 
that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis a nd each sign or symptom will be 
recorded separately.
6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from protocol mandated laboratory  tests and vi tal signs will be summarized in the 
clinical study  report.  Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol -mandated l aboratory  
values/vital signs should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any o f the SAE 
criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the invest igational product.

Version 5.0
Date 14 February 2020
61(85)If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/v ital sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory  resul t/vital sign 
will be considered as addit ional informat ion.  Wherever possible the reporting invest igator 
uses the cli nical, rather than the laboratory  term  (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).  
In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non -
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Any new or aggravated clinically rele vant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion 
as com pared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.
6.4 Reporting of serious adverse events
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the invest igational 
product, or to the study  procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study , then investi gators or other si te personnel inform 
the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day  ie, immediately  but no later than 
24 hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the invest igator to ensure that all the 
necessary  informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data entry  site within 1
calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events and within 5 calendar
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal  or life -threatening adverse events where important or relevant informat ion is missing, 
active fo llow-up is undertaken imme diately .  Investi gators or other site personnel inform 
AstraZeneca representatives of any  follow-up informat ion on a previously  reported SAE 
within one calendar day  ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she 
beco mes aware of it.
Once the invest igators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, 
an autom ated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative.
If the WBDC system is not available, then the investigator or other study  site personnel  
reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone.
The AstraZeneca representative will advise the investigator/study  site personnel how to 
proceed. 
The reference document for definit ion of expectedness/listedness is the IB for the Astra Zeneca 
drug and the EU Summary o f Product Characteristics (SPC) for the active co mparator product 
(including any AstraZeneca co mparator). 
6.5 Overdose
For the purpose of this study , an overdose i s defined as a dose of study  medicat ion in excess 
of that specif ied in the CSP (ie, more than 1 tablet per day  of either study  drug).
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance saxagliptin

62 (85 ) An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE m odules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF module.
 An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose CRF 
module.
If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study  drug occurs in the course of the study , then the 
investigator or other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives 
immediately , or no later than 24 hours ofwhen he or she beco mes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the invest igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data entry  site.
For overdoses associated with a SAE, the stand ard reporting t imelines apply, see Sect ion 6.4.  
For other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 day s.
In the event of an overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be init iated as di ctated by
the pati ent’s clinical status. Saxagliptin and its active metabo lite are rem oved by
hemodialysis (23% of dose over 4 hours). The Product Label for sitaglipt in states the drug is 
modestly dialyzable.
6.6 Pregnancy
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca.
6.6.1 Maternal exposure
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study  invest igational product should be 
discontinued immediately .
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event unless there is a suspicio n that the 
investigat ional product under study  may have interfered with the effect iveness of a 
contraceptive medicat ion.  Congenital abnormalit ies/bi rth defects and spontaneous 
miscarri ages shoul d be r eported and handled as SAEs.  Elect ive abortions without 
complicat ions should not be handled as AEs.  The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous 
miscarri age, el ective terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormalit y) 
shoul d be f ollowed up and docum ented even if the patient was discont inued fro m the study .
If any pregnancy  occurs in the course of the study , then the investigator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within a day  ie, immediately  but no later 
than 24 hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the invest igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data entry  site wi thin 1 or 5 
calendar day s for SAEs (see Secti on 6.4) and wi thin 30 days for all other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply when outcome informat ion is available.

Background, rescue medicat ion, and post -study  treatm ent will not be provided by the Sponsor.
7.7.1 Concomitant treatment
Therapy  with the pati ent’s stable series of medications for T2DM and h eart failure will 
continue during the duration of the trial.
For pati ents taking insulin, the investigator must query  the pati ent at pre -screening or 
screening regarding his/her usual total daily insulin dose (all t ypes co mbined).  Dosage 
reducti ons of ins ulin and sulfo nylurea agents may  be considered at randomizat ion to minimize 
the possibilit y of hypoglycaemia. For patients treated with insulin, consider a reduction in 
dose of 20% at randomizat ion.
For pati ents receiving sulfo nylurea agents, consider a re ducti on in dose of 50% or discontinue 
if on a dosage that is considered low at randomizatio n. 
Any reductions in the dosage of insulin and sulfo nylurea agents will be at the discret ion of the 
investigator.
Other medication than that described above, which is considered necessary for the patient’s 
safet y and well -being, m ay be given at the discretion of the invest igator and recorded in the 
appropriate sections of the Case Report Form.
Concomitant herbal or nutrit ional therapies must also be entered into the eCRF.
7.7.2 Rescue medication
The Sponsor will not supply  rescue m edicati on during the study .  Pati ents shoul d continue 
receiving study  medicati on while receiving rescue therapy .  If rescue therapy  fails, further 
therapy  will be given at the discretion of the in vestigator.

During the double -blind treatment period of the trial, patients may be eligible for the addit ion 
of open -label rescue medicat ion to thei r blinded treatment regimen in order to treat ongoing 
hyperglycemia, based upon central  laboratory  FPG values and repeat, confirmatory  FPG 
criteria ( Table 6). 
For parti cipants wi th sustained hyperglycemia as outlined in Table 6, increased doses of 
background medicat ion or addit ional agents, not listed in the exclusio ns, m ay be used 
according to local guidelines.
Patients wi th a centra l laboratory  FPG value m eeting the l ack of glycemic control criterion at 
a pre -specified visit will be scheduled for a follow -up visit (within 3- 5 days) to obtain a 
second central laboratory  FPG value.  If the repeat central laboratory  FPG value st ill meet s the 
criterion, the pati ent will receive rescue medicat ion.
If a patient has a local, or unplanned FPG value meeting the lack o f glycemic control criterion, 
then a central laboratory  FPG value shoul d be obtained as soon as possible. If the central 
labora tory FPG value meets the criterion, the patient will receive rescue medicat ion.

8 STATISTICAL ANALYSES BY ASTRAZENECA
8.1 Statistical considerations
All personnel invo lved wit h the analysis o f the study  will remain blinded unt il database l ock 
and protocol vio lators ident ified.
Analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representatives.    
The SAP will be signed off before review o f any potenti al treatm ent revealing data is 
undertaken and any subsequent amendments will be do cumented, with final amendments 
completed pri or to unblinding of the data. If one or more stratification cells has sparse or no 
data, then, for purposes of the imputation and analysis models, stratification levels and/or 
variables may be combined or variab les may be dropped from  the m odels.
8.2 Sample size estimate
The comparison o f saxagliptin versus placebo in LVEDV index is used to estimate sample 
size.  The mean change from baseline in LVEDV index at Week 24 will be assessed 
comparing saxaglipt in versus the placebo treatm ent group.  The efficacy  assessment will  claim 
non-inferiorit y if the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the adjusted mean 
treatm ent difference between saxaglipt in and placebo is less than the non -inferiorit y margin, 
whic h will be taken as 10% of the overall (all treatments combined) baseline mean value. For 
purposes of the sample size calculat ion, this number will be assumed to be 6.5 mL/m2. (See 
below)  
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance saxagliptin
Study Code D1680C00016
Version 5.0
Date 14 February 2020
69 (85 )A total o f 330 (110 each arm) eligible pat ients will be rando mized in a 1:1:1 ratio to: 
 Arm 1: Saxaglipt in  
 Arm 2: Sitaglipt in
 Arm 3: Placebo 
To dem onstrate non -inferiorit y of saxaglipt in co mpared to placebo for the change from 
baseline to Week 24 in LVEDV index within a non -inferiorit y margin o f 6.5 m L/m2, assuming 
a standard deviat ion (SD) of 15 mL/m2, and at a 1 -sided si gnificance l evel of 0.025, 
approximately  88 pati ents will be needed in each treatment group to provide approximately 
80% power (given a true difference of zero between saxaglipt in and placebo).  Assum ing that 
20% of patients will be missing an endpo int assessment, a total of approximately  330 patients 
(110 patients in each of the 3 treatment groups) must be randomized.
The non -inferiorit y margin estimate for the sample size calculat ion for LVEDV index is based 
on data from Foster et al 1998 , where the baseline LVEDV index is 65 ±13 (mean ±SD) 
mL/m2.  To exclude an increase in LVEDV index (relative to placebo) of greater than 10% of 
the baseline , the change seen with vildaglipt in in LVEDV in the VIVIDD study , the non -
inferi ority margin for these calculat ions is equivalent to 6.5 (65 × 0.10) mL/m2.  
8.3 Definitions of analysis sets
The primary  and secondar y efficacy  analyses will be performed based on the full analysis set. 
TheSafety analysis will be performed based on the safet y analysis set.
8.3.1 Efficacy analysis set s
The full analysis set (FAS) will include all rando mized pat ients who take at least one dose of 
the study  medicat ion.Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment groups to which 
they are randomized. 
The per -protocol (PP) analysis set is a subset of the FAS set that includes patients without 
important protocol deviat ions that might affec t the primary  analyses. Pati ents will  be analyzed 
according to the treatment rando mized. The criteria for important protocol deviations will be 
defined in the statist ical analysis plan. The cri teria for important protocol deviat ions will be 
established af ter protocol  deviat ion reviews, before the data have been unblinded.
8.3.2 Safety analysis set
The safet y analysis set will include all rando mized patients who have received at least 1 dose 
of study  treatm ent. Pati ents will be analyzed according to the treatm entactually received.

deviat ions or vi olations thought to sign ificantly affect the pharmacokinet ics of the drug). 
PK data will be reported separately from the clinical study  report.
8.4 Outcome measures for analyses
8.4.1 Primary efficacy variable
Change from baseline in LVEDV index measured by MRI at 24 weeks, saxaglipt in co mpared 
to placebo.
8.4.2 Secondary efficacy variables
 Change from baseline in LVESV index, LVEF, and LVM measured by MRI after 
24 weeks, saxaglipt in compared to placebo
 Change from baseline in NT -proBNP after 24 weeks, saxaglipt in compared to 
placebo.

8.5 Methods for statistical analyses
The full analysis set (FAS) will be used for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses. 
Efficacy analyses will also be conducted using the PP anal ysis set.  All primary and secondary  
analyses will be performed using values regardless of rescue or discont inuat ion of the study  
treatm ent. When pat ients have their final MRI measurements done at an ETD visit rather than 
at Week 24, these measurements wil l be used as the endpo int.  Sensit ivity analyses for the 
primary  and secondary variables will be performed using analyses that do not assume the data 
are missing at random and incorporate patients randomized and treated but with only baseline 
data.
All statistical co mpar isons will be tested at the alpha level o f 0.05 (two -sided) level.  No 
multiplicit y control  will be applied for the statistical comparisons.
8.5.1 Analysis of the primary variable (s)
The primary  analysis for LVEDV index ,mean change fro m baseline at Week 24 ,will be 
perform ed using analysis o f covari ance (ANCOVA), wi th term s for treatm ent group, eGFR 
category  (<50, ≥50mL/min/1.73 m2), SGLT -2 inhibitor use, region, and baseline value as 
covari ates in the m odel.  A m ultiple imputati on approach will be used to impute the missing 
values of LVEDV at Week 24 for all FAS subjects wi th a nonmissing baseline value . Point 
estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the adjusted mean changes 
within each treatm ent g roup, as well as for the differences in adjusted mean changes between 
treatm ent groups.  The NI margin for the study  will be calculated as 10% of the overall 
baseline mean LVEDV index across all treatment groups.  Non -inferiorit y will be 
demonstrated if th e upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in 
treatm ents (saxaglipt in minus placebo) is less than the NI margin.

Continuous variables co llected at only one visit during rando mizat ion treatment pe riod 
(cardi ac dimensio n and funct ion LVEDV index, LVESV index, LVEF, and LVM by MRI, 
etc), will be analyzed using the same analysis o f covari ance (ANCOVA) approach used for 
the primary  variable.
Continuous variables co llected at more than one visit during randomizat ion treatment period, 
(NT-proBNP, etc), will be analyzed using a mixed -model repeated -measures (MMRM) 
approach wi th term s for treatm ent group, eGFR category  (<50, ≥50mL/min/1.73 m2), SGLT -
2 inhibitor use, region, baseline value, time (each relev ant visi t), the interacti on of  treatm ent 
and time, and the interaction of baseline value and time in the model.  Bio markers or data with 
extrem ely skewed distributi onsmay be log transfo rmed pri or to ANCOVA or MMRM 
analysis. 
Point estimates and 95% confid ence intervals will be calculated for the adjusted mean changes 
within each treatm ent group as well as for the differences in adjusted mean changes between 
treatm ent groups.  No mult iplicit y control  will be applied for the statistical co mpar isons.
8.5.3 Explorat ory analyses
For continuous variables (percent change of plasma vo lume by Strauss formula, blood 
pressure, HbA1c (using values prior to rescue), body  weight, and bi omarkers, etc) collected at 
multiple visit s post -baseline, the same MMRM approach will be us ed.  For conti nuous 
variables (LVEDV index, LVESV index, LVEF, and LVM, etc.) collected at one visit post -
baseline, the same ANCOVA model described for the primary variable will be used although 
multiple imputation of missing data may not be used .
Plasma c oncentrati ons of  saxagliptin, 5 -hydroxy  saxaglipt in, and sitagliptin will be used to 
develop exploratory  PK/PD m odels, which may be reported separately from the clinical study  
report.
In cases where the central measurement of HbA1C is not possible due to h emoglobin vari ants 
not com patible wit h the central assay , no val ue will  be centrally  collected and these subjects 
will be excluded fro m the HbA1c analysis.
8.5.4 Subgroup analysis 
Details o f the subgroup analysis will be specified in Statistical Analysis Plan. The treatment 
effect on the adjusted mean change from baseline in LVEDV index measured by MRI at 24 
weeks will be examined in the fo llowing subgroups: 
Baseline HbA1c (<7.0%, 7.0% to 9.0%, and >9.0%)
Gender (male, female)
Age (<65, ≥65 y ears)

Safety analyses for the double -blind treatment period will be performed using the Safet y 
analysis set, including data after the addit ion of glycemic rescue concomitant medicat ion or 
change of heart failure conco mitant m edicat ion. Safet y analyses will include, where 
appropriate, descript ive statist ics, counts, and percentages f or AEs and other safet y measures.  
No formal stati stical tests will be performed.
Descript ive statistics will be calculated for demographic and other baseline characterist ics.  
The number and percent of patients with at least one adverse event will be sum marized for 
each treatment group, including summaries of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discont inuat ion, 
AEs of special interest, and adjudicated CV events, including hHF.  Summaries will include 
the number of patients with events by  specified system  organ cl asses and preferred terms.  
Addit ionally , the incidence of adverse events and frequency of recurring adverse events will 
be summarized for each treatment group for both frequent events (occurring in at least 5% of 
patients) and for sel ected adverse events of special interest.  
Values and changes from  baseline at each scheduled time po int for clinical laboratory  
param eters and vital signs, including seated blood pressure and heart rate, will be summarized 
by treatment group using descript ive statist ics.  The number and percent of patients with 
laboratory  values m eeting marked abnormalit y criteria will be summarized for each treatment 
group.  Other safet y assessments, including serum creatinine and eGFR by MDRD, will be 
summarized by  treatm ent group using descr iptive statist ics of values and changes fro m 
baseline at each scheduled time po int.
Addit ional analyses for adverse events and laboratory  marked abnorm alities may be 
perform ed excluding data after the addit ion of glycemic rescue conco mitant m edicat ion.

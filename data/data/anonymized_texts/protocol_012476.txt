General Explanation  Primary Reason s for Amendment:  
Inclusion criterion 4 stated that “at least 2, but no more than 4, prior HER2 -
directed therapy regimens  for breast cancer, including trastuzumab and 
trastuzumab emtansine (T -DM1, KADCYLA®)”. The majority of patients with 
advanced HER2 positive breast cancer have been treated with more than 4 
regimens of prior anti -cancer therapies. The restriction of patien ts having only 
up to 4 prior treatment regimens  significantly limits a patient’s participation 
opportunity. In order to include more patients, the inclusion criterion was 
changed so that a patient must have had at least 2 prior treatments, but there is 
no upper limit.  
A change to the prior treatment wash out requirement was based on the half -life 
of the treatments and  to ensure provide enough time  for recovery from side 
effects and minimization of influence s from prior therapy. This change is 
intended to pr ovide patients with study treatment earlier, as appropriate.  
Other changes in patient eligibility are based on the feedback from the 
investigators and study centers. These changes are expected to improve 
enrollment without an increased risk to patient saf ety.

Reference Therapy, Dose, and Route of Administration:  None   
Efficacy Assessments:  
Primary Endpoint:  
• The optimal dosing schedule for  poziotinib to be used in the clinical  development program  
• Objective Response Rate  (ORR ) 
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Safety  
• Pharmacokinetics (PK)  
• Progression -Free Survival  (PFS)  
• Disease Control Rate  (DCR ) 
• Time to Progression  (TTP )  
Pharmacokinetic Assessments:  All patients will have blood samples d rawn pre-dose and at 1  hour and 2 hours 
(±15 min) post -dose for sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling on Day 1  of Cycle 1 , Cycle 2 , and Cycle 3 (all 
cohorts) and pre-dose on Day 14  (±3 days) of Cycle 1  (Cohort 1  only) .  
Patients in Cohort 2  and Cohort 3 , if consented, will undergo intensive PK sampling.  Intensive PK 
sampling will replace sparse PK sampling in Cycle 1 . The schedule for intensive PK sampling will be Day 1  of 
Cycle 1  pre-dose and 30 minutes, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 24 hours post -dose.  
In addition, if a patient presents with a potentially drug -related serious adverse event (SAE), PK samples may be 
collected during the visit for PK analysis.  
Safety Assessments:  
Safety will be assessed by reported/elicited adverse events ( AEs), laboratory as sessments  including hematology 
and biochemistry, vital signs, physical examination, and neurological examination. The assessment of treatment -
emergent AEs (TEAEs) includes SAEs, AEs leading to study drug discontinuation, and AEs related to the study 
drug.  
Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Reporting:  
Adverse events will be recorded from the first dose of study drug administration until 35 (±5)  days after the last 
dose of study drug is administered. From the time Informed Consent is signed to the first dose of study drug 
administration, only serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study procedures will be recorded and reported.   
Statistical  Methods:  
A formal statistical analysis plan (SAP) providing full technical details of the planned analyses will be finalized 
prior to  database lock.  
Sample Size Justification:  
Other important treatments for HER2 -positive metastatic breast cancer include tra stuzumab emtansine (T -DM1), 
lapatinib -capecitabine combination, and neratinib. Published ORRs  reported for these regimens are 43.6%, 
30.8%, and 24%, respectively . The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of poziotinib  and 
identify t he optimal dose for future clinical development. No statistical hypothesis testing will be performed.  
The enrollment into Cohort 1  is now complete. A total of 32 patients have received treatment of poziotinib in 
Cohort 1 . A total of 30 patients are expect ed to be enrolled and treated in Cohort 2 . If the enrollment in 
Cohort  2 is stopped due to toxicity, new patients will be enrolled into Cohort 3 . A total of 20 patients will be 
enrolled in Cohort 3.  
Efficacy Analysis:  
The primary efficacy variable ORR  will be analyzed descriptively along with the 95% CI  for each cohort . The 
secondary efficacy variables, PFS, DCR, and TTP , will be analyzed descriptively  for each cohort .

Amendment 1 4 Jul 2017  Confidential  18 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
1.1.1 Breast Cancer  
Breast cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer and the second highest cause of cancer 
deaths in women  [1]. About 1 in 8 (12%) women in the United States (US) will develop invasive 
breast cancer during their lifetime. In the US in 2015, an estimated 231 ,840 new cases of 
invasive breast cancer will occur . Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in 
women, exceeded only by lung cancer. The chance that breast cancer will be responsible for a 
woman’s death is about 1 in 36 (about 3%). Death rates from breast cancer have been declining 
since about 1989, with larger decreases in women younger than 50  years of age . These decreases 
are believed to be the result of earlier detection through screening and increased awareness, as 
well as improved treatment. However, even with these improvements, it is still estimated that 
approximately 40,29 0 women and 440 m en are expected to die from breast cancer  in 2015  [1].  
Important components of the treatment of breast cancer are not only the extent of the disease but 
its biologic features. Knowledge of these factors contributes to the determination of the disease 
stage, assist in the risk assessment of recurrence, and may predict response to therapy. Due to 
this, t he National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Breast Cancer 
recommend that  estrogen receptors  (ERs) , progesterone receptors  (PRs) , and the human 
epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) status be d etermined in all breast cancer samples  [2]. 
1.1.2 Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Family - Role in Breast Cancer  
The human epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) family consists of four members: 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/HER1 or erbB -1), HER2 (erbB -2), HER3 (erbB -3), and 
HER4 (erbB -4), and these proteins regulate cell growth, apoptosis, migration, adhesion, and 
differentiation.  Hyperactivation of th ese receptors triggers a complex, multilayered network of 
interrelated signaling pathways including downstream up -regulation of the mitogen activated 
protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide -3-kinase/  AKT (PI3K/AKT), and Janus Kinase/Signal 
Transducer and A ctivator of Transcription ( JAK/STAT ) pathways  promoting cancer growth  [3]. 
HER2 is overexpressed in roughly 20% to 25% of breast cancers  and is a prognostic marker  [4-
5]. HER2 -positive  breast cancers are characterized as being more clinically aggressive and more 
invasive than HER2 -negative subtypes, are associated with increased growth rates, early 
systemic metastasis , and worse outcome  [5-6]. Treatments that specifically target HER2 have 
been shown to be particularly beneficial to patients with HER2 -positive  breast cancers , and 
several t argeted drug therapies have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) to treat patients with HER2 -positive  breast cancer, including trastuzumab, lapatinib, 
pertuzumab, and trastuzumab emtansine ( T-DM1 ). However, de novo  and acquired resist ance to 
HER2 -directed approaches remains a clinical challe nge and an unmet medical need. Thus, 
development of novel therapeutic agents aimed at preventing or circumventing resistance are still 
needed.

Amendment 1 4 Jul 2017  Confidential  19 1.1.3 Poziotinib  
1.1.3.1  Pharmacology of Poziotinib  
Poziotinib  (HM78 1-36B) is a novel, oral, quinazoline -based pan -HER inhibitor that irreversibly 
blocks signaling through the EGFR family of tyrosine -kinase receptors, including human 
epidermal growth factor receptor (HER1 /ErbB1 /EGFR), HER2 (ErbB2), and HER4 (ErbB4), as 
well as HER receptor mutations. This, in turn, leads to inhibition of the proliferation of tumor 
cells that overexpress these receptors. It is well established that several malignancies, including 
lung, breast, stomach, colorectal, head , and neck, and pancreatic carcinomas, are associated with 
a mutation in or overexpression of members of the EGFR receptor family  [7].  
1.1.3.2  Drug Product Description  
Poziotinib  (HM781 -36B) is formulated  as a hydrochloride salt of poziotinib . The chemical 
formula of poziotinib  is (1-[4-[4-(3,4-dichloro -2-fluorophenylamino) -7-methoxyquinazolin -6-
yloxy] -piperidin -1-yl]prop -2-en-1-one hydrochloride). For clinical trials conducted i n the United 
States, the dr ug product will be supplied as tablets for oral administration, which contain 2.0 mg 
or 8.0 mg of poziotinib  (as salt form), respectively.  
1.1.4 Poziotinib  Nonclinical Studies  
Poziotinib  demonstrated potent EGFR and HER2 inhibitory activity in vitro , irreversib le HER -
family binding and inhibition of EGFR downstream signaling, inhibition of cell growth in 
various human cancer cell lines, and inhibition of tumor volume and growth rate in human 
cancer cell line xenograft animal models. The comparative dose -response  effects of poziotinib  
(HM781 -36B), and other EGFR family inhibitors including erlotinib (Tarceva®), lapatinib, and 
afatinib (BIBW 2992) on cell growth in a breast cancer cell line are presented in Figure 1.  The 
cells were treated with increasing doses of poziotinib  (0.1-1000 nM) for 72 hours.  In all studies, 
poziotinib  was the most potent inhibitor of cell growth compared with the other EGFR inhibitors 
tested in SK -BR-3 cells.

Amendment 1 4 Jul 2017  Confidential  20 Figure 1 In Vitro  Growth Inhibitory Activity of Poziotinib  (HM781 -36B) Versus Other 
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitors in SK -BR-3 Cells  
 
In enzyme -based, in vitro  assays conducted in va rious human and mouse cancer cell lines, 
poziotinib  effectively inhibited wild -type EGFR family kinases, including EGFR, HER2, and 
HER4 with 50% inhibitory dose s (IC 50) of 3.2 nM, 5.3 nM , and 23.5 nM, respectively, and 
mutated EGFRs, including EGFRT790M and EGFRL858R/T790M with IC 50 values of 4.2 nM and 
2.2 nM, respectively.  In in vivo cancer models, poziotinib  monotherapy blocked the 
phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2 in HCC827, N -87, and NCI -H1975 cancer cell lines.  
Poziotinib  was also shown to irreversibly b ind to its target enzymes, which led to excellent in 
vivo anti-tumor effectiveness of poziotinib  in xenograft models with various EGFR -dependent 
cancer cell lines harboring high expression levels of EGFRWT or HER2, EGFRDel E746_A750 and 
EGFRL858R/T790M. In vitro  and in vivo studies have also been conducted to evaluate  the effects of 
poziotinib  when administered in combination with the well -established monoclonal antibody 
cancer drug trastuzumab. These studies were performed in HER2 -driven canc er models, 
including breast cancer and gastric cancer, and indicate that poziotinib  has synergistic 
antineoplastic effects when given in combination with trastuzumab.  
Safety pharmacology studies of poziotinib  were conducted , including a rat Irwin study, a rat 
respiratory study, and a cardiovascular telemetry study in dogs.  The inhibition of human ether -a-
go-go (hERG ) tail current observed in vitro  was not predictive of cardiovascular effects in 
telemetry -instrumented beagle dogs in vivo . The nonclinical eff icacy and safety data support the 
continued development of poziotinib .

Amendment 1 4 Jul 2017  Confidential  21 1.1.4.1  Poziotinib Absorption, Distribution and Metabolism   
Poziotinib  is a compound with high plasma clearance, moderate oral bioavailability, high protein 
binding, slow metabolism in vitro , and extensive metabolism in vivo . Exposure to poziotinib  
increased with increase in dose, and pharmacokinetic profiles were similar between males and 
females in nonclinical species. Poziotinib  was widely distributed in tissues, and was concentrated 
in the uveal tract and eye. Poziotinib  was extensively metabolized in the rat following 
intravenous and oral administration of the drug; 10 metabolites were identified. Metabolites 
identified in vitro  were similar to those identified in vivo , and in the clinic;  M1 (dihydroxy -
poziotinib ) and M2 (O-demethyl -poziotinib ) were the major metabolites. Metabolite formation 
was NADPH -dependent, suggesting a role for cytochrome P450 ( CYP 450) enzymes. CYP3A4 
was the primary enzyme in the formation of M1, and CYP2D6 was the  primary enzyme in the 
formation of M2. Both the M1 and M2 metabolites are pharmacologically active, but M2 is 
much more potent than M1 [8]. 
1.1.4.2  Poziotinib Toxicity Studies   
The toxicities of single or repeated daily doses of oral poziotinib  were asse ssed in rats and dogs. 
In the  13-week  toxicity study , rats tolerated poziotinib  up to a daily dose of 0.45 mg/kg. Adverse 
toxicological effects included an increase in the incidence of skin lesions (degeneration/atrophy, 
erosion/ulcer, epidermal hyperplasia, exudates), stomach toxicity (histopathological epithelial 
hyperplasia, hyper keratosis, inflammation and erosion/ulcer) and increased neutrophil counts 
secondary to inflammation. The NOAEL for the 13 -week study was 0.15 mg/kg/day.  The MTD 
for the study was 0.45  mg/kg/day, based on reductions in mean body weight in males ( -18.7%) 
and females ( -7.1%).  
In the 13 -week toxicity study, dogs tolerated up to 0.15 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL following dose 
reduction was 0.075  mg/kg/day.  The MTD following dose reduction was 0.15 mg/kg/day, based 
on reductions in body weight (13.2% and 13.9%) and foo d consumption (75.8% and 85.0%) in 
males and females, respectively. The major target organs were skin (hyperplasia, ulcer, and 
inflammation), gastrointestinal tract (inflammation, attenuation of luminal epithelium), eye 
(atrophy of the corneal epithelium),  and lymphoid organ (lymphocyte depletion/necrosis). In 
regard to cardiovascular effects ( electrocardiogram [ ECG ], blood pressure, heart rate, and QT), 
there were no changes up to 0.15 mg/kg/day of poziotinib  in the 13 -week dog toxicity study.   
Poziotinib  and its M1 and M2 metabolites were not mutagenic in vitro  in the bacterial reverse 
mutation assay (Ames test) or in the Chinese hamster ovary chromosome aberration assay; and, 
were not clastogenic in an in vivo  rat bone marrow micronucleus test at doses of  up to 
1000  mg/kg in males and 500 mg/kg in females.  Poziotinib  was evaluated in an embryo -fetal 
study in rats and rabbits. Effects of poziotinib  on embryo -fetal development were limited and  
restricted to high doses. High -dose poziotinib  exposure was assoc iated with a reduction in the 
mean number of viable fetuses and this was correlated with increased post implantation loss and 
resorptions. Neither the rat nor the rabbit showed evidence of teratogenicity. Poziotinib  did not 
show any evidence of skin irrita tion in male New Zealand White rabbits or any evidence of 
phototoxicity to BALB/c 3T3 clone A31 cells.  
The toxicological findings in animal studies have been entirely consistent with the adverse 
events reported in human clinical trials.  The most frequent adverse events reported in human 
clinical trials conducted in South Korea to date include diarrhea, stomatitis, rash, decreased 
Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol

Amendment 1 4 Jul 2017  Confidential  22 appetite, and p ruritus.  These toxicological effects observed in rats, dogs and humans with 
poziotinib  mirror t hose observed with other EGFR inhibitors [9-12], suggesting that poziotinib  
toxicity is a class effect of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition.  Since the poziotinib  metabolite M2 
exhibits in vitro  EGFR inhibitory activity nearly identical  to poziotinib  (IC 50 values = 5.6 nM  
and 5.4 nM, respectively), one can not exclude the possibility that in vivo  poziotinib  EGFR 
inhibitory activity is due to systemic levels of both poziotinib  and M2. As the formation of M2 is 
dependent on the variable activity of the human polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme, accounting for 
poziotinib  and M2 may be the most accurate estimate of TKI activity and hence toxicity. The 
mean safety margin at the NOAEL in dogs in the 13 -week toxicity study, compared to humans at 
the MTD of 24 mg/day, was 0.8 -fold using poziotinib  exposure alone and 2.1 -fold u sing 
poziotinib  + M2 exposure.  
These values are in line with the Phase 1 studies completed in South Korea , in which  patients 
were treated with poziotinib  doses ranging from 0.5 mg to 32 mg  (HM-PHI-101). The dose -
limiting toxicity  (DLT)  in these clinical t rials was observed at 32 mg , and 24 mg was the MTD 
for the intermittent ( 14 days on treatment  and 7 days  off) dosing schedule. Taken together, these 
data support the planned and ongoing clinical trials utilizing doses of poziotinib  up to 24  mg/day.  
1.1.5 Poziotinib  Clinical Studies  
To date, the clinical development program for poziotinib  has been conducted in Korea and 
comprises of 3 completed and 6 ongoing clinical studies in patients with advanced cancers.  
• Two completed Phase 1 studies  conducted  in patie nts with advanced cancers (solid 
tumors)  
• One completed Phase 1b/2 study conducted in patients with advanced gastric cancer  
• Six ongoing Phase 2 studies conducted in patients in various malignancies, including one 
Phase 2 study being performed in patients w ith breast cancer  
To date, more than 200 patients have received poziotinib  monotherapy in open -label clinical 
trials at doses ranging from 0.5 mg to 32 mg on an intermittent dosing schedule and from 12 mg 
to 24 mg on a continuous dosing schedule, or as com bination therapy with trastuzumab and 
paclitaxel. Clinical activity was observed in p atients on poziotinib  monotherapy and in 
combination with other anti -cancer agents, as defined by objective responses or prolonged 
stabilization of disease. Clinical benef it has been observed in patients with several solid tumors.  
Poziotinib  monotherapy utilizing an oral dose of 16 mg/day on either an intermittent (2 weeks 
on, 1 week off) or continuous dosing regimen can induce partial response or disease stabilization 
in patients with several advanced solid tumor types  (HM-PH1 -102). For the cancer indications 
being investigated, the patients experienced adverse events (AE s) that were either expected for 
the underlying malignancies or commonly seen with other HER2 -targeted t herapies (e.g., 
diarrhea, rash , and stomatitis).  
Despite the fact that most patients treated in poziotinib  clinical trials have had advanced and 
heavily pre -treated disease, t he safety profile described for poziotinib  in these trials and the anti -
tumor ac tivity noted s uggests  a favorable benefit -risk ratio  and provides justification for the 
continued development of poziotinib  for the treatment of multiple EGFR - or HER2 -driven solid 
tumor indications.

1.2 Rationale for the Current Stu dy 
HER2 -targeted approaches have revolutionized the treatment and outcomes associated with 
HER2 -overexpressing breast cancer. However, de novo  and acquired resistance to HER2 - 
directed approaches remains a clinical challenge , and many metastatic breast can cer patients 
continue to progress or relapse, despite having initially responded  to treatment . Several 
resistance mechanisms have been described, including mutations in other signaling pathways and 
expression of a truncated form of HER2  [13]. Therefore, there remains  an unmet need to develop 
novel treatment approaches for HER2 -positive  breast cancer that can improve clinical outcomes, 
particularly in the context of strategies to overcome resistance to HER2 -targeted therapy.  
Poziotinib  is an orally administered, irreversible pan -HER inhibitor with activity against HER1, 
(ErbB1; EGFR), H ER2 (ErbB2), and HER4 (ErbB4), as well as HER receptor mutations. The 
clinical results and safety profile of poziotinib  to date in various studies involving patients with 
relapsed or refractory solid tumors as either a single agent or as combination therap y, have been 
very promising. Th ese data  support the expectation  that poziotinib  will be efficacious and well 
tolerated in HER2 -positive  metastatic breast cancer patients.   
In Phase 1 studies , the MTD of poziotinib  was determined to be 18  mg for continuous daily 
dosing and 24  mg for intermittent dosing ( 14 days on  treatment, 7 days off treatment ). The most 
commonly occurring toxicit ies included diarrhea, rash , and stomatitis , which is  consistent with 
the know n toxicity profile of other EGFR inhibitors.  For m onoclonal antibody EGFR -targeted 
therapies, such as cetuximab or panitumumab, rates of Grade 2 diarrhea are up to 21% and for 
Grade 3 diarrhea (i.e., greater than 7 stools per day or requiring intravenous fluids) between 1% 
to 2% [14-17]. For small -molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors like erlotinib, gefitinib, and 
Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Poziotinib  Protocol Number: SP I-POZ -201 
Amendment 1 4 Jul 2017  Confidential  25 lapatinib, however, diarrhea is substantially more common, occurring in up to 60% for all grades 
and with Grade 3 diarrhea occurring in about 6% to 9% of patients [15].  
Although diarrhea is common with EGFR inhibitor  treatment  and can significantly impact 
patient s’ quality of life, evidence suggests that diarrhea is also an indicator that EGFR TKIs are 
hitting their targ et [18]. In one study of gefitinib in NSCLC, the p resence of diarrhea was 
identified as one of the independent predictors of a partial response,  and the absence of diarrhea 
was one of the predictors of progressive disease  [19]. In another  study of gefitinib and erlotinib 
in patients with recurrent and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck , EGFR 
TKI–induced diarrhea was associated with  clinical benefit and also an association with more 
favorable o verall survival  [20]. In afatinib lung cancer trials, a trend toward a higher rate of 
progression -free survival was observed in patients who had Grade 2 or greater diarrhea in the 
first 28 days of treatme nt with afatinib compared with patients who experienced no AEs [21]. 
Currently , prophylactic loperamide is often given to prevent diarrhea with other EGFR -directed 
therapies  [22]. In addition , base d on our experience from a recently completed  Phase 2 breast 
cancer study,  it is estimated that the average body size of US patients will be larger than that of 
the average Korean patient.  Therefore , to address the expected issues with acute diarrhea  in this 
study , prophylactic loperamide will be administered with the 24 mg starting dose of poziotinib  
(Section  5.4.10.1 ), which was not required in the Korean studies.  In addition , intermittent dosing 
rather than continuous dosing will be used to also help address the more chronic toxicities of rash 
and stomat itis. Supportive care for m ucositis/s tomatitis will also be provided, aiming to control 
symptoms  for all patients during the study . 
In Phase 1 studies, 18 mg/day was the maximum tolerated dose for continuous dosing, and 
16 mg/day was the recomme nded dose f or continuous dosing. Based on the tolerability of 
poziotinib in patients in  this study so far and the previous  data, two additional cohorts with lower 
doses and continuous dosing are being added to this protocol amendment . No new patients will 
be enrolled  into the original 24  mg per day with intermittent dosing cohort ( Cohort 1 ) and new 
patients will be enrolled into Cohort 2  (16 mg/day, continuous dosing). If patients are unable to 
tolerate the dosing regimen in Cohort 2 , new patients will be enrolled into Cohort 3  (12 mg/day, 
continuous dosing). These changes are being made  in order to improve  patient tolerability while 
maintaining  consistent drug exposure .

• Disease Control Rate  (DCR )  
• Time to Progression  (TTP )  
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design and Treatment Plan  
This is a Phase 2, open -label, multicenter study to establish the dose regimen and evaluate the 
preliminary  efficacy and the safety / tolerability of poziotinib  in approximately 75 patients with 
HER2 -positive  MBC  who have received at least two prior HER2 -directed treatment regimens  
including trastuzumab  and T-DM1 . 
The Screening  period ( Day -30 to Day -1) lasts up to approximately 30 days prior to Cycle 1, 
Day 1 . Patients must meet all Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria to participate in the study. Eligible 
patients will provide written Informed Consent prior to undergoing any study procedures.   
Each treatment cycle is 21 calendar days in duration . Eligible patients will be enrolled into each 
dose cohort as described below. In Amendment 1, in addition to the original 24 mg cohort 
(Cohort 1 ), two additional treatment cohorts were  added.  
• Cohort 1:  24 mg (three 8 -mg tablets once daily) for 2  weeks, rest 1 week 
(ENROLLMENT COMPLETE)  
• Cohort 2:  16 mg (two 8 -mg tablets once daily) continuous dosing  
• Cohort 3:  12 mg (one 8 -mg tablet and two 2 -mg tablet once daily) continuous  dosing  
Patient enrollment in Cohort 1  is complete. New patients will begin enrollment into Cohort  2. 
Rules for safety review and enrollment for Cohort 2  and Cohort 3  follow:  
Cohort 2:   
• Rate of Grade 3 or greater AEs of special interest ( ie, diarrhea, skin rash, stomatitis) that  
are identified  during Safety Data Review after the first 6 patients and again after 
12 patients  have completed Cycle 1 : 
• >33% : Stop Cohort 2  (≥3 of 6 or ≥5 of 12 patients with Grade 3 or above AE  of 
special interest ) and b egin Cohort 3   
• ≤33% : Keep enrolling Cohort 2  until 30 patients are enrolled and treated  and no 
additional patients will be enrolled.  
Cohort 3 - only if Cohort 2 is stopped due to toxicity : 
• Rate of Grade 3 or greater AEs of special interest ( ie, diarrhea, skin rash, stomatitis)  
are identified during Safety Data Review after  the first 6 patients and again after 
12 patients  have completed Cycle  1: 
• >33%:  End enrollment in Cohort 3   
• ≤33%:  Keep enrolling  Cohort 3  until 20 patients are enrolled and treated  
Toxicity will be assessed ba sed on the grade of the adverse events using CTCAE version  4.03.  
All treatments will be taken orally, once daily (QD) at approximately the same time each 
morning. On Day 1  of each cycle, the patient’s absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be

Amendment 1 4 Jul 2017  Confidential  27 ≥1.0×109/L and  platelet count must be ≥ 100×109/L before administering poziotinib . For Cycle  1 
and Cycle 2  only, the ANC and platelet count  should also be confirmed prior to the dose on 
Day 8. Day 1  of a new cycle is equivalent to Day 22  of the previous cycle, with a window of ±3 
days for the visit. If a visit is delayed during 1 cycle, then all subsequent cycles will be delayed 
sequentially . 
All patients will be treated until disease progression, death, intolerable adverse events , or up to a 
maximum of 24 months , whichever comes first.

7 SAFETY ASSESSMENT  
7.1 Safety Measures  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the patients at their 
site and to report all AEs/SAEs that are observed or reported during the study, regardless of 
relationship to study drug or clinical significance. The decision to modify the dose of study 
treatment will be determined by the Investigator based on t he decision rules shown in 
Section  6.1.5.  
Safety data will also be reviewed on a regular basis by Spectrum’s study monitoring team, which 
includes a Clinical Research Associate (CRA), Medical Monitor, and other personne l from the 
company or its designee.  
Adverse events will be characterized by intensity (severity), causality, and seriousness by the 
Investigator based on the regulatory definitions included below.  
This study will utilize the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) Scale Version  4.03 for AE grading.  
Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Poziotinib  Protocol Number: SP I-POZ -201 
Amendment 1 4 Jul 2017  Confidential  39 7.2 Adverse Events  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient, temporally associated with the use of a medic inal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product. Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally associated with the use of  a medicinal product. A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is 
any AE that occurs from the first dose of study treatment until 35 (±5) days after the last dose of 
study treatment.  
The study will record all AEs according to the information in Section 7.3 . 
Examples of AEs include : 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after investiga tional product administration.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational product or a concurrent medication.  
• AEs may include pre -treatment or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol -
mandated procedures, ie, invasive procedures.  
Abnormal laboratory results are to be recorded as AEs, if any of the following conditions are 
met: 
• The abnormal laboratory value leads to a th erapeutic intervention.  
• The abnormal laboratory value is considered to be clinically significant by the 
Investigator.  
• The abnormal laboratory value is predefined as an AE in the protocol or in another 
document communicated to the Investigator by Spectrum o r designee.  
Examples of events that do not  constitute AEs include:  
• Medical or surgical procedures (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads 
to the procedure is an AE.  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence does not occur (eg, social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
• Planned and prescheduled hospitalizations and procedures.  
• Progre ssive disease.  
The adverse events of special interest identified with poziotinib treatment in this study include 
diarrhea, skin rash, oral cavity mucositis/stomatitis, fatigue, and vomiting/nausea.

Poziotinib  Protocol Number: SP I-POZ -201 
Amendment 1 4 Jul 2017  Confidential  40 7.3 Guidelines for Recording and Attribution Scoring of Adver se Events  
Timely and complete reporting of all AEs is required for all patients . Monitoring and 
documentation of all AEs allows for identification of potential study -drug or dose -related AEs, 
and for adherence to regulatory requirements. Please refer to th e CRF Completion Guidelines 
located in the study binder for detailed instructions for AE reporting.  
7.3.1 Recording of Adverse Events  
All AEs that occur from the first dose of study treatment  through 35 (±5) days after the last dose 
of study treatment is adminis tered are to be recorded on the AE CRF. From the time the study 
Informed Consent is signed through the first dose of study drug administration, only SAEs that 
are related to study procedures are to be recorded.  
The resolution of all AEs must be recorded at the end of the study. The following conventions 
will be followed when patient completes or discontinues from the study:  
• If a patient dies, the date of death should be the date of AE stop for all ongoing AEs at 
the time of death.  
• If a patient discontinue s due to an AE(s), the outcome of the AE is to be followed for 
35 (±5) days from the date of discontinuation or until the AE has returned to Grade  ≤1. 
The status of the AE and the date of last contact with the patient will be captured. If the 
AE has not returned to Grade  ≤1 by the end of the study, the AE stop date should be left 
as ongoing.  
All AEs will be classified by intensity/severity ( Section 7.3.2 ), relationship to study drug 
(Section 7.5 ), and as serious or nonserious ( Section 7.7 ) by the Investigator . 
7.3.2 Grading of Adverse Events  
This study will utilize the NCI CTCAE Scale , Version 4.03 for AE grading.  
7.4 Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All AEs  and significant abnormal laboratory values are to be followed up in accordance with the 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and 
other applicable regulatory requirements (eg, United States [US] Code of F ederal Regulations 
[CFR]).  
7.5 Relationship  
The Investigator must make a causality assessment and document their opinion as to the 
relationship of all AEs and SAEs to study treatment ( Table 3).  
Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Poziotinib  Protocol Number: SP I-POZ -201 
Amendment 1 4 Jul 2017  Confidential  41 Table 3 Investigator Assessment of Adverse Event Causality  
Relationship  Description  
Not Related  The event is clearly related to factors other than study treatment, such as the patient’s 
clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the 
patient.  
Unlikely Related  The temporal association, patient history and/or circumstances are such that the study 
drug or treatment is not likely to have had an assoc iation with observed event.   
Possibly Related  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study treatment 
administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to study treatment, but could 
have been produced by other factors, such  as the patient’s clinical state, therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the patient.  
Probably Related  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study treatment 
administration, and follows a known res ponse pattern to study treatment, and cannot be 
reasonably explained by other factors, such as the patient’s clinical state, therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the patient.  
Definitely Related  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study treatment 
administration, and follows a known response pattern to study treatment, and cannot be 
reasonably explained by other factors, such as the patient’s clinical state, therapeuti c 
interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the patient.  
In addition, the event either occurs immediately following study treatment administration, 
improves on stopping study treatment, reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a positive  
reaction at the application site.  
7.6 Expectedness  
For investigational drugs, an AE is judged “expected” if its description agrees in nature and 
severity with the description of AEs previously noted with the study drug as detailed in the 
current Investigator’ s Brochure. An “unexpected” AE is one for which the specificity or severity 
is neither consistent with the current Investigator’s Brochure nor the risk information described 
in the general investigational plan. The Sponsor  will be responsible for assessing  the 
expectedness of AEs.  
The most common AEs associated with poziotinib  treatment  include:  
• Diarrhea  
• Rash  
• Stomatitis  
• Fatigue  
• Vomiting  
• Decreased Appetite   
• Dry Skin  
• Nausea

Amendment 1 4 Jul 2017  Confidential  42 7.7 Serious Adverse Events  
In the interest of patient care and to allow Spectrum to fulfil l all regulatory requirements, any 
SAE, regardless of causal relationship to study treatment, is to be reported to the Sponsor  within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event. SAEs are defined (21 CFR 312.32, ICH of Technical 
Requirements for Registration of Pha rmaceuticals for Human Use E2A Guideline) as those AEs 
that meet any of the following criteria:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening: ie, any event that, in the opinion of the Investigator, poses an 
immediate risk of death from that event.  
• Requires inpati ent hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (excluding 
hospitalizations for study therapy, disease -related procedures, or placement of an 
indwelling catheter, unless associated with other SAEs).  
• Results in a persistent or significant di sability/incapacity.  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Includes important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Adverse events that do not meet any of the above criteria for serious should be regarded as non -
serious.  
7.7.1 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
From the time the study Informed Consent is signed through the first dos e of study drug 
administration, only SAEs that are related to study procedures are to be recorded. All SAEs that 
occur from the first dose of study drug administration  through 35 (±5) days after the last dose of 
study treatment are to be reported to Spectr um within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  
SAEs (regardless of their relationship to study treatment) are to  be reported and the serious 
adverse event report (SAER) faxed or e-mailed within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to:  
Spectrum Pharmaceutical s, Inc . 
Primary Contact: Pharmacovigilance Department  
Fax:  
E-mail:  
Spectrum  may request additional information from the Investigator  to ensure the timely 
completion of accurate safety reports. Safety data that are critical to the reportability of an SAE, 
such as causality assessment and serious criteria, should be included in the initial fax ed or 
e-mailed SAER. If omitted, a timely res ponse to drug safety data queries received from Spectrum  
or designee is expected.  
The Investigator is to take all appropriate therapeutic measures necessary for resolution of the 
SAE. Any medications necessary for treatment of the SAE are to be recorded in  the concomitant 
medication section of the patient’s CRF.  

Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Poziotinib  Protocol Number: SP I-POZ -201 
Amendment 1 4 Jul 2017  Confidential  43 SAEs that are study -treatment related will be followed until resolution or until they have returned 
to Grade 1, whichever is longer, or until it is determined that the outcome will not change with 
further follow -up. 
Additionally, the SAE is to be entered in the AE section of the CRF. Follow -up SAERs need to 
be submitted to Spectrum within 24 hours, once additional information regarding the event 
becomes available (eg, final diagnosis is made, laborat ory or test results, event course, outcome, 
etc).  
The Sponsor  or its designee will be responsible for reporting SAEs to the regulatory authorities 
in accordance with applicable expedited reporting regulatory guidelines. The Investigator is 
responsible for  submitting SAEs to his/her Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee 
(EC). Copies of each SAER, and documentation of IRB/EC notification and acknowledgement 
of receipt, will be kept in the Site’s Regulatory Binder.  
7.7.2 Exclusions to Serious Adverse Ev ent Reporting Requirements  
The following are not considered SAEs:  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (eg, social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital, hospitalization for diagnostic tests such as CT  
scans).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected prior to first study treatment administration that do not worsen.  
• Planned and prescheduled hospitalizations and procedures.  
• Progressive disease.

Poziotinib  Protocol Number: SP I-POZ -201 
Amendment 1 4 Jul 2017  Confidential  44 8.1 Sample Size  
Other important treatments for HER2 -positive MBC  include T -DM1, lapatinib -capecitabine 
combination, and neratinib. Published OR Rs reported for these regimens are 43.6%, 30.8%, and 
24%, respectively [22, 24-25]. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
poziotinib  and identify  the optimal dose for future clinical development . No statistical hypothesis 
testing will be performed.   
The enrollment into Cohort 1  is now complete. A total of 32 patients have received treatment of 
poziotinib in Cohort 1 . A total of 30 patients are expected to be enrolled and treated in 
Cohort  2. If the enrollment in Cohort 2  is stopped due to toxicity, new patients will be enrolled 
into Cohort 3 . A total of 20 patients will be enrolled in Cohort 3.  
8.2 Method of Treatment Assignment  
This study is not randomized. Patients will be enrolled sequentially.  
8.3 Analysis Populations  
Two analysis populations have been defined as follows:  
• The Evalu able Population  (EP)  consist s of all patients who are enrolled , complete  at 
least one cycle of poziotinib treatment,  and have at least one  post-baseline tumor  
response  evaluat ion using  RECIST , Version 1.1 .  
• The Safety Analysis Population (SAF)  includes all  patients who signed informed 
consent, enrolled, and received at least one dose of study treatment. All demographics, 
Baseline characteristics , and safety data will be analyzed using the SAF  population.   
8.4 General Statistical Methods  
The Sponsor’s  Biostatist ics and Data Management (BDM) group  will be responsible for data 
manage ment and statistical analysis of this study. All statistical analyses will be performed using 
SAS for Windows ( version  9.3 or higher). Patient data listings and tabular presentations of  
results will be provided . Further details of the criteria and conduct of the statistical analyses will 
be included in the SAP for this study.  
8.5 Efficacy Analyses  
8.5.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary efficacy variables, as described below, will be summarized and analyzed 
descriptively, along with 95% CI , for each cohort . 
• Objective Response Rate  (ORR ) will be assessed according to the Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Guidelines, version 1.1 [23] and is defined as the best 
response [Complete Response ( CR) + Partial Response ( PR)] recorded from the start of 
the study until the end of study in patients who received at least 1 dose of poziotinib . The 
ORR will be based on the E P.

Poziotinib  Protocol Number: SP I-POZ -201 
Amendment 1 4 Jul 2017  Confidential  45 8.5.2 Secondar y Endpoint s 
• Safety, including adverse events and pharmacokinetics  
• Safety and adverse events:  Safety will be assessed by reported/elicited AEs, 
laboratory assessments including hematology and biochemistry, vital signs, physical 
examination, and neurological examination. The assessment of treatment -emergent 
AEs (TEAEs) includes SAEs, AEs leading to  study drug discontinuation, and AEs 
related to the study drug.  
• Pharmacokinetics:  All patients will have blood samples drawn pre-dose and at 
1 hour and 2  hours (±15 min) post -dose for sparse PK sampling on Day 1  of 
Cycles  1, 2, and 3 and pre-dose on Day 1 4 (±3 days) of Cycle 1  (Cohort 1  only) . If 
consented, intensive PK samples will be drawn pre -dose and 30 minutes, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 
4, 6, and 24 hours post -dose on Day 1  of Cycle 1 . In addition, if a patient presents 
with a potentially drug -related SAE, PK samp les may be collected during the clinic 
visit for PK analysis.  
• PFS is defined as the number of days from the treatment start date to the date of 
documented disease progression or death due to any cause . Disease progression will be 
determined by RECIST Version 1.1.  
• DCR , including CR, PR, and Stable Disease (SD), will be assessed using RECIST , 
version 1.1 and defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR, PR, and SD by the 
best response from the first dose of poziotinib  to the end of study.  
• TTP is defined as the period of time from the first dose of study drug to tumor 
progression, which excludes death without tumor progression, by the end of study.  
The secondary efficacy variables of PFS, DCR , and TTP  will be analyzed descriptively , for 
each cohort . 
8.6 Safety  Analysis  
The overall incidence of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAE) (ie, AEs occurring from the time the 
first dose of the study drug  until 35 (±5)  days after the last dose) and the proportion of patients 
who discontinue because of a TEAE are the prim ary safety outcome measures. The number and 
percent of patients with new -onset TEAEs will be summarized by the MedDRA (version 17) 
system -organ -class (SOC) level and Preferred Term for all treated patients , for each cohort . The 
summary of TEAEs will be pre sented in the following categories:  
• Number and percentage of patients with any TEAEs by SOC and Preferred Term.  
• Number and percentage of patients with any SAEs by SOC  and Preferred Term.  
• Number and percentage of patients with related TEAEs by SOC  and Preferred Term.  
• Number and percentage of patients with TEAEs causing discontinuation of the study by 
Body System and Preferred Term.  
In addition, the number and percent of patients with TEAEs by grade will be summarized.  
Adverse events reported prior to treatment but after IC will be provided in a listing.  
Finally, the number of completed cycles will also be summarized and analyzed descriptively.

a) Each cycle is comprised of 21 days. Day 1  of a new cycle is applicable to Day 22  of the previous cycle, with a window period of ± 3 days. If a visit is delayed during 1 cycle, the subsequent schedules 
will be delayed sequentially.  
b) An End-of-Treatment Visit  will be performed 35 (±5) days after the last dose of poziotinib . An End of Study page will be recorded at that time.  
c) A complete  physical examination is required at Screening , Day 1  of each Cycle, and at the End-of-Treatment Visit . Symptom -directed exams are required at other visits.  
d) Pregnancy test (urine β -HCG) in women of child -bearing potential.  
e) Tumor assessment will be performed at Screening  and every 6 weeks (± 14 days) until disease progression, death, or intolerable adverse events, whichever c omes earlier . Imaging studies performed 
prior to the signing of Informed Consent as part of the site’s routine standard of practice are allowed at the discretion of the Sponsor.  
f) Complete blood count (CBC) , including white blood cells  with 5 -part differenti al, hemoglobin,  and platelets , is to be obtained within 7 days prior to poziotinib administration on Day 1  of each cycle, 
at which time, the patient’s absolute neutrophil count must be ≥1. 0×109/L and platelet count must be ≥ 100×109/L before administering t he next dose of poziotinib. In addition, a CBC is to be 
performed on Day 8  of Cycles 1  and 2. 
g) Blood for chemistry is to be collected within 7 days prior to poziotinib  administration on Day 1  of each Cycle.  
h) Cardiac ejection fraction will be evaluated using echocardiogram or multi -gated acquisition (MUGA) scan and will be monitored at Screening, 3 months after first treatment, then every 6 months 
thereafter, while the patient is treated, and at the End-of-Treatment Visit .  
i) For all cohorts, patients will have blood samples drawn  pre-dose and at 1  hour and 2  hours (±15 min) post -dose for sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling on Day 1  of Cycles 1 , 2, and 3 and pre-dose 
on Day 14 of Cycle 1  (Cohort 1  only). For patients in Cohort 2  and Cohort 3 , if consented, intensive PK samples will be drawn pre -dose and 30 minutes, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 24 hours post -dose on 
Day 1  of Cycle 1 . In addition, if a patient presents with a potentially drug -related serious adverse event (SAE), PK samples may be co llected during the visit for PK analysis.  
j) Poziotinib and loperamide will be dispensed on Day 1  of each cycle. Patients will take poziotinib orally once daily at approximately the same time each morning according to the schedule for each 
cohort during each 21-day cycle .  
k) Adverse event assessment during Screening  will utilize National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.03) and record only s tudy-related SAEs.

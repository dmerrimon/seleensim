 I. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFIC AIMS  
Diabetes is  reported in 20 -34% of hospitalized adult patients in general medicine and surgery units  1,2. The 
annual incidence of diabetes as any listed diagnosis has more than doubled during the past 2 decades to a total 
of 7.2 million hospital discharges , for a total of 43.1 million hospital days among U.S. adults 3,4.  A large body 
of literature has shown a strong association between diabetes  and increased mortality and morbidity 1,5-8. 
Clinical guidelines have recommended the use of basal bolus insulin regimen s as the preferred management 
approach of non -ICU patients with diabetes 9-11, as it has been  shown to be effective in improving glycemic 
control and reducing hospital complications  12-14. However, hypoglycemia is a common adverse event of insulin 
therapy 15-18, with incidence rates ranging between 12% and 35% in randomized studies in non-ICU settings  
14,19. The development of hypoglycemia, like hy perglycemia, has been associated with higher rates of hospital 
complications, higher health care resource utilization, and hospital mortality 10,16,2 0-22.   
Bedside point -of-care (POC) capillary glucose monitoring is  the standard of care to assess gl ycemic control in 
the hospital . Diabetes g uidelines recommend  bedside capillary POC testing before meals and at bedtime  to 
assess glycemic control and to adjust insulin therapy in the hospital 9,10,23. Continuous glucose monitoring 
(CGM) measures  interstit ial glucose every 5 -15 minutes, thus providing a more complete glycemic profile 
during 24 -hours compared to standard POC glucose te sting 24,25. In a recent study of hospitalized patients with 
type 2 diabetes  (T2D) , we reported increased detection of both hypo - and hyperglycemic events with the use of 
CGM compare to the standard -of-care POC glucose testing . Patients were treated with basal -bolus regimen  in 
conjunction with CGM use 24. More than 50% of the hypoglycemic events occurred between dinner and 
breakfast; suggesting that many of these episodes would be missed by standard POC testing. Schaupp et al 26 
reported that the number  of nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes <3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dl) was 15 -fold higher, and 
the number of episodes >13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dl) detected by CGM during night was 12.5 -fold higher 24 
compared to capillary POC glucose testing  in general medicine patients with type 2 diabetes treated with a basal 
bolus insulin regimen for ≥ 3 days.    
A recent panel of experts in inpatient diabetes care reported that CGM could more effectively identify trends 
toward hypoglycemia and hyperglycemi a, allowing for better and safer management of patients with inpatient 
hyperglycemia  27,28.  Despite evidence supporting the use of CGM devices in hospitalized patients ; clinical 
guidelines have been inconclusive in recommend ing the use of CGM in the hospital due to the lack of safety 
and efficacy outcome studies 27,29,30. In recent years, the improvement  in the accuracy of CGM sensors , as well 
as lack of interference with acetaminophen  31 and need for calibration 32, suggest that CGM technology could 
replace the finger -stick blood glucose monitoring in insulin treated patients in the hospital. A ccordingly, we 
propose a pragmatic evalua tion of the Dexcom G6 CGM proving their accuracy and clinical effectiveness is 
needed , which may facilitate the widespread adoption of this technology in the hospital setting.   
We hypothesize that CGM will provide a more complete 24 -hour assessment of glu cose values during 
hospitalization and after hospital discharge improving  detection of hypoglycemic  and hyperglycemic  events 
compared to POC glucose testing (standard of care) in patients with  type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes  (T2D) . 
B.        Specific Aims:   
Aim 1.  To determine differences in glycemic control, as measured by mean daily blood gluco se and 
frequency of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic event s, between DexcomG6 CGM and POC BG testing in 
hospitalized patients with T1D and T2D treated with basal bolus insulin regimen.   
Hypothesis : Glucose monitoring by CGM will improve detection of clinical ly significant hypoglycemia (<54 
mg/dl) and severe hyperglycemia (>240 mg/dl) compared to standard POC testing  in insulin -treated patients  
with T1D and  T2D. 
Aim 2.  To determine differences in glycemic control and accuracy after hospital discharge between  
DexcomG6 CGM and POC BG test ing in hospitalized patients with  T1D and  T2D.

 Hypothesis : Glucose monitoring by CGM will improve detection of  clinical ly significant hypoglycemia (<54 
mg/dl) and severe hyperglycemia (>240 mg/dl) compared to standard POC after hospital discharge in  patients 
with T1D and  T2D.  
 
II. BACKGROUND AND STATUS  OF WORK IN THE FIELD.  
II.a.  Inpatient glycemic control in non -ICU setting.   Patients with diabetes have a three -fold greater chance 
of hospitalization compared to those without diabetes 33. The annual incidence of diabetes as any listed 
diagnosis has more than doubled during  the past 2 decades to a total of 7.2 million hospital discharges for a total 
of 43.1 million hospital days among U.S. adults affected 3,4. Current guidelines recommend the use of 
intravenous insulin in the ICU and  subcutaneous insulin r egimens in non-ICU setting s 10,34. Although effective 
in improving glycemic control  and in reducing hospital complications 14,35, intensive insulin t herapy results in 
frequent hypoglycemia, reported in 12% to 30% of patients 13,36,37. Thus, improving glycemic control while 
minimizing the rate of hypoglycemia is of major importance in the hospital, because both hyperglycemia and 
hypoglycemia have been shown to be independent risk factors of poor clinical outcome and mortality 1,38,39.  
II.b.  Transition Care from Hospital to Home.  Hospital discharge represents a critical time for ensur ing a safe 
transition to the outpatient setting and reducing the need for emergency department visits and re -hospitalization.  
Few studies have addressed the management of patients with diabetes after hospital discharge in insulin treated 
patients with T2D . In two recent randomized studies we assessed the efficacy of a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 
based algorithm using glargine insulin for the management of patients with T2D 12. Patients were discharged on 
a combination of oral antid iabetic drugs (OADs) and glargine insulin at 50% of hospital dose if their HbA1c 
was < 9%. Patients with an HbA1c ≥ 9% were discharged on a combination of OAD and glargine insulin a t 
80% of total daily hospital dose or on a basal bolus regimen with glargin e and rapid -acting insulin analog before 
meals. The admission HbA1c on admission of 8.75% decreased to 7.9% and 7.35% after 4 and 12 week s of 
hospital discharge . The rate of hypogly cemia was ~32% in patients treated wit h oral agents plus basal insulin 
and greater than 40% in patients treated wit h basal bolus insulin regimen. These RCT studies and previous 
retrospective studies highlight the importance of BG monitoring and cautious us e of insulin after hospital 
discharge.   
II.c.  Use and limitations of CGM in non -ICU setting . Several studies have shown that the inpatient use of 
CGM is more effective in identifying trends toward hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia compared to standard 
POC g lucose testing 24,25. In a r ecent  study of hospitalized patients with T2D,  we reported increased detection of 
both hypo - and hyper - glycemic events with the use of CGM compare to the standard -of-care POC BG (23). 
There was no difference in mean daily blood glucose concentration between gr oups. CGM detected most 
hypoglycemic events, only one of which was detected on POC monitoring. More than 50% of the hypoglycemic 
events occurred between dinner and breakfast; suggesting that many of these episodes would be missed by 
standard POC testing. A  recent panel of experts in inpatient diabetes care reported that CGM could more 
effectively identify trends toward hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, allowing for better and safer management 
of patients with inpatient hyperglycemia (22). Significant limitati ons; however, are noted  with the use of CGM 
in the hospital including  1) most studies used blinded CGM and therefore interventions to prevent impending 
hypoglycemia were not performed 25,26,40,41; 2) glucose values  captured in the CGM device are not tran smitted 
to the nursing station to allow providers to detect and treat impending hypoglycemia; 3) hypoglycemia alarms 
are only visible and audible at the bedside; 4) lack of studies using CGM to guide insulin therapy in patients 
with diabetes , with minimal data on T1D patients  42.  
We proposed a comprehensive research progra m to investigate the role of CGM (Dexcom  G6 CGM) in the 
management of patients with diabetes in non -ICU setting receiving insulin treatment.  The Dexcom G6 hospital 
research program includes two studies:  
Study 1.  Assessment of glycemic control in hospita lized insulin -treated patients with T1D and T2D  by 
capillary point -of-care testing and continuous glucose monitoring: Dexcom G6 Observation al Study  
CGM OBSERVATIONAL VERSION 09.09.2019             5 
 Study 2.  Efficacy of Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring in guiding insulin therapy in hospitalized 
patients with T1D and T2D : Dexcom G6 Hospital Intervention  Trial .  
Study 1 , the current proposal  is a pilot, exploratory observational prospective study aiming to evaluate the 
feasibility of using the Dexcom G6 CGM in the hospital to obtain preliminary estima tes on differences in 
glycemic con trol, as measured by mean daily blood glucose and frequency of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic 
events, compared to  capillary POC BG testing (standard of care) in hospitalized patients with T1D and T2D 
treated with basal bol us insulin regimen.  Treatment inte rventions will be made based on the current standard -of-
care POC BG monitoring.  
Patients with T1D and T2D  who are expected to be hospitalized for longer than 3 days will wear the CGM and 
undergo POC testing before meals a nd bedtime (standard of care) duri ng the hospital stay  and after hospital 
discharge for 10 days . Patients will wear a CGM in the current approved insertion site, the abdomen, and in the 
upper arm  both during hospitalization and then for 10 days post -discha rge. Patients and the research team will 
be blinded to the CGM glucose results during the study. Downloading of the sensors will be performed at the 
day of discharge and 10 days  after hospital di scharge .

The Dexcom G6 CGM  is a commercially available facto ry-calibrated sens or system 32, thus there is no need 
for POC BG testi ng for sensor calibration . Clinical data for 7-day stability have reported excellent correlation 
with glucose v alues reported by labo ratory  and POC testing . Although the benefits of factory -calibrated CGM 
sensors include replacing the need for finger -stick blood glucose monitoring and providing the benefits of real -
time glucose v alues, its benefits and safety have not yet been proven in  the hospital setting. It is important to 
mention potential  limitations, including: the need for removing the sensor before MRI or diathermy treatment, 
and the potential interference in patients with severe dehydration.

 Patients:  Patients  with T1D and T2D  will be included in this pilot, prospective observational study to 
determine differences in BG control by  the Dexcom G6 CGM and POC testing before  meals and bedtime 
(standard of care) during the hospital stay and after hospital discharge for 10 days . Two CGM devices will be 
inserted in all patients – one in the abdomen an d one in the arm to also assess differences in BG readings 
between upper extrem ity and abdominal insertion sites.  
We will recruit a total of 100 male and female subjects >18 years with T1D and T2D treated with basal bolus 
insulin regimen. Due to the design  of this study, there will be no run -in period.  Upon arrival to the emergency 
department or medical or general surgical wards, subjects will be screened.  Patients with a known history of 
T1D and T2D treated with insulin and expected to be hospitalized fo r longer than 3 days will be considered 
potential candidates for this study. Pa tients admitted with acute or chronic medical illnesses, emergency or 
elective surgical procedures and trauma will be included in the study. Patients anticipated to be admitted to ICU 
will be excluded from the study.  
Insulin treated patients will undergo B G monitoring by POC testing at bedside. A blinded Dexcom G6 will be 
place shortly after admission. Insulin therapy will be adjusted following POC readings (standard of care) 10,14,43.  
Information on CGM readings w ill be collected daily during the hospital stay  using the  Dexcom Studio software 
to download the Dexcom receiver data. During the study period patients and healthcare providers will be 
blinded to CGM readings.  
 
Primary and Secondary Research Outcomes:

outcome) and hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events  (safety outcome)  during hospitalization:   
1) Glycemic control, as measured by mean daily blood glucos e and time in range (70 -180 mg/dl)  
2) Clinical significant hypoglycemia  (<54 mg/dl) and severe hyperglycemia (>240    mg/dl).   
 
Secondary outcomes  include differences between groups in any of the following measures:  
1. Nocturnal hypoglycemia < 70 mg/dl and < 54 mg/dl (between 22:00 and 06:00)  
2. Number of hypoglycemi c events (< 70 and 54 mg/dl)  
3. Duration or time in hypoglycemi a (minutes) during the day and night

6. Percentage of patients with greater than 5% -time below glucose target (< 70 and 54 mg/dl)  
7. Percentage of patients with greater than 5% -time above glucose target (>180 and 240 mg/dl)  
8. Glycemic variability calculated by Standard Devia tion, and MAGE  
9. Number of sensor removal for procedures/imaging, sensors failures, sensors dislodgments  
10. After discharge: time in range (TIR), frequency of and time in hypoglycemia (TIHypo), frequency of 
and time in hy perglycemia (TIHyper), glycemic variabil ity (GV)  
11. Accuracy of Dexcom G6 CGM, as defined by overall MARD, as compared to the standard -of-care POC 
and daily morning laboratory glucose values  
12. Accuracy of Dexcom G6 CGM, as defined by ISO criteria (sensor value s within 30/30%, 20/20%, 
15/15% for valu es < 70 mg/dl, 70 -140 mg/dl, >140 -180 mg/dl and > 180 mg/dl), compared to the 
standard -of-care POC BG  
13. Differences in accuracy between G6 CGM in the abdomen and upper arm insertion sites  
14. Percentage of values within Zo ne A, B, C of the Clarke Error Grid

2. Known history of T1D or T2D receiving insulin therapy  
CGM OBSERVATIONAL VERSION 09.09.2019             7 
 3. Subjects must have a randomization BG between < 400 mg/dL wit hout laboratory evidence of diabetic 
ketoacidosis (bicarbonate < 18 mEq/L, pH < 7.30, or positive serum or urinary ketones).  
4. Patients with expected hospital length -of-stay of 3 or more day s  
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Patients with acute illness admitted to the ICU or expected to require admission to  the ICU.  
2. Patients expected to require MRI procedures during hospitalization.  
3. Mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and possible consequences of 
the study.  
4. Fema le subjects who are pregnant or breast ‑feeding at time of enrollment into the study.  
   
CGM Data Accuracy analysis:  
Interstitial glucose values collected by CGM will be paired with POC BG (closed values within a 5 min range). 
Two CGM devices will be inserted – one in the abdomen and one in the  upper arm - to assess differences in BG 
readings between upper extremity and ab dominal insertion sites.  In addition, patients will undergo daily  venous 
glucose  values measured by the hospital laboratory.  Patients with > 2 days of sensor data, and with a m inimum 
of 70% of CGM readings over used days will be included in the comparison  analysis. A minimum of 
approximately 70% of possible CGM readings over used days appears to generate a report that enables optimal 
analysis and decision -making; standard report ing and visualization of CGM data are important 44,45. CGM 
metrics will include overall MARD and MAD, 30/30%, 20/20%, 10/10% for values < 70 mg/dl, 70 -140 mg/dl, 
>140 -180 mg/dl and > 180 mg/dl 45. A three way and direct head -to-head comparison of data from the 
abdomen, upper arm and POC BG will be compared.  
 
Primary Care Team (PCT) can continue to manage patient s; if desired by PCT, research team can 
manage as follows:  
Recom mended Basal Bolus Insulin Protocol.   
Patients will be treated with a basal bolus insulin regimen as previously reported  12,13.  The research team will 
follow the recommenda tions below to adjust insulin doses that  target standard of care glycemic control goals.  
The primary care team will provide care concerning  patients’ underlying medical or surgical conditions not 
related to diabetes management.  
 
TREATMENT PROTOCOL  
Patients Treated with Insulin Prior to Admissi on 
• Discontinue oral antidiabetic drugs on admission.  
• Subjects treated with insulin prior to admission will receive 80% of the total daily dose (TDD) given as 
basal bolus regimen with basal insulin (glargine, detemir or degludec)  once daily plus rapid -actin g 
insulin (lispro or aspart) before meals.  
• Half of TDD will be given as basal  and half as rapid -acting insulin.   
• Basal insulin will be given once daily, at the same time of the day.   
• Rapid -acting  insulin  (lispro or aspart)  will be given in three equally divided doses before each meal.  To 
prevent hypoglycemia, if a subject is not able to eat, rapid -acting  insulin dose will be held.  
 
Insulin Naïve Patients Treated with Oral Agents or GLP1 -RAs Prior to Admission  
• Discontinue o ral antidiabetic drugs on admiss ion. 
• Starting total daily insulin dose:  
▪ 0.4 U/Kg/day when randomization BG between 140 -200 mg/dL  
▪ 0.5 U/ Kg/day when randomization BG between 201 -400 mg/dL   
▪ Reduce TDD to 0.3 units per kg in patients ≥ 70 years of age and/or  with a eGFR < 60 ml/min.  
• Half of TDD will be given as basal insulin (glargine, detemir or degludec) once daily plus rapid -acting 
insulin (lispro or aspart) before meals .   
CGM OBSERVATIONAL VERSION 09.09.2019             8 
 • Basal insulin will be given once daily, at the same time of the day.   
• Rapid -acting insulin (lispro or aspart) will be given in three equally divided doses before each meal.  To 
prevent hypoglycemia, if a subject is not able to eat, rapid -acting insulin dose will be hel d. 
 
Basal Insulin adjustment.   
• Daily basal (glargine, detemir or degludec) insulin dose will be adjusted as follow:  
▪ If the fasting and pre -dinner BG is between 100 - 140 mg/dl in the absence of hypoglycemia the 
previous day: no change  
▪ If the fasting and p re-dinner BG is between 141 - 200 mg/dl in the absence of hypoglycemia: 
increase basal insulin by 10% every day  
▪ If the fasting and pre -dinner BG is between 201 - 280 m g/dl in the absence of hypoglycemia: 
increase basal insulin by 20% every day  
▪ If the fasting and pre -dinner BG is >281  mg/dl in the absence of hypoglycemia the previous day: 
increase bas al insulin (glargine) dose by 3 0% every day  
▪ If the fasting and pre -dinner BG is between 70 - 99 mg/dl in the absence of hypoglycemia: decrease 
TDD (basal and  prandial) insulin dose by 10% every day  
▪ If BG <70 mg/dL , the insulin TDD (basal and prandial) should be decreased by 20%.   
▪ If BG <40 mg/dL , the insulin TDD (basal an d prandial) should be decreased by 30 -40%.   
 
Supplemental insulin.  Rapid -acting insulin  will be administered following the “supplemental/correction 
insulin scale” protocol.   
• If a patient is able and expected to eat most of his/her meals, supplemental insulin will be administered 
before meals and at bedtime following the  “usual” dose of the insulin scale protocol.  
• If a patient is not able to eat, supplemental insulin will be administered every 6 hours following the 
“sensitive” dose of the supplemental insulin scale protocol.  
• Table indicates  number of units  to be added to scheduled insulin dos e.

Hospital Diabetes Education.  
CGM OBSERVATIONAL VERSION 09.09.2019             9 
 1. Diabetes education if not received within 1 year of admission   
2. Use of glucose meters for home glucose self -monitor ing 
3. Keeping BG records, and will receive a logbook to record glucose tests results  
4. Training on placement and  care of  CGM Dexcom G6  
5. Hypoglycem ia prevention, recognition and management  
 
Aim 2.  To determine differences in glycemic control after hospital disc harge between  DexcomG6 CGM 
and POC BG testing in hospitalized patients with diabetes . 
During the hospital stay, patients will be instructed on CGM placement and care. The CGM system training 
sessions will be performed by a diabetes educator. The diabetes e ducator will educate patients on  how CGM system 
differs from capillary SMBG, reinforci ng the need for continued SMBG. Patients interested in participating in 
the study and willing to and able to  use the CGM device  will be recruited.  A new CGM (blinded) wi ll be 
placed  in the abdomen  prior to discharge. Patients will be asked to return for a clinic visit ten days  after 
discharge to review results of BG by home POC testing. Patients will be instructed to performed POC testing 
before meals and bedtime.  Patien ts with > 2 days of sensor data, and with a minimum of 70% of CGM readings 
over used days will be included in the comparison analysis .  
Recommendations for Insulin Discharge algorithm12:  
Patients will be discharge d following a standard pro tocol taking in consideration preadmission treatment (oral 
agents or insulin) and HbA1c value on admission as previously reported 12.   
• Patients on oral agents prior to admission with an HbA1c between 7.5% and <10% will be discharged on 
oral agents plus basal insulin ( NPH, glargine, detemir, degludec) at 50% of the daily hospital dose.  
• Patients on oral agents prior to admission with an admission A1C ≥ 10% will be discharge d on their oral 
agents plus basal insul in at 80% of daily hospital dose.   
• Patients on oral agents plus basal insulin (NPH, glargine, detemir , degludec ) prior to admiss ion with an 
admission A1C between 7.5% and <10% will be discharge d on their oral agents plus basal insulin at 
50% of daily hosp ital dose.   
• Patients on oral agents plus basal insulin (NPH, glargine, detemir , degludec ) prior to admission with an 
admission A 1C ≥ 10% will be discharge d on their oral agents plus glargine U300 or glargine U100 at 
80% of daily hospital dose.   
• Patients treated with basal bolus regimen prior to admission will be discharged on 80% of their 
preadmission TDD with basal insulin once d aily and rapid -acting insulin before meals.   
 
 
Follow -up Care:  
• New  CGM (blinded) sensor will be placed   in the abdomen on the day of discharge . If primary care team 
is planning to discharge over the weekend: participants will get new blinded sensor on Fri day evening 
prior to discharge . Patients will be ask ed to return to clinic 10 days after discharge  (soon er or later 
depending on participant’s availability and schedule ).   
• Duration of the outpatient study is 10 days.  
 
During follow up we will collect the following information:   
 
1. Glycemic control:

IV.  Statistical Methods  
The present study is one of two projects aimed to investigate the role of CGM  (Dexcom G6 CGM) in the 
management of patients with diabetes in non -ICU setting receiv ing insulin treatment.  This observational and 
prospective study will explore the efficacy of CGM compared to standard POC glucose testing in assessing 
glucose control (e fficacy) and hypoglycemic events (safety) in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes 
receiving insulin during admission and after hospital discharge.  
Statistical analyses will be conducted by Professor Limin Peng , PhD  at the School of Public Health at Emo ry 
University.  We will report baseline characteristics by hospital service (medicine and surgery), diabetes type 
(T1D and T2D), and risk factors for hypoglycemia. The rates of incidence of hypoglycemia will be calculated 
based on the data obtained by CGM and POC.  Comparisons will be made with the use of Wilcoxon tests (or 
Kruskal – Wallis tests) and Chi -square tests (or Fisher’s exact test) as appropriate. Multivariate linear regression 
will be conducted to assess the difference in continuous secondary outc omes betw een the two groups while 
other relevant covariates. To be eligible for analysis at least 70% of CGM values need to be available per day, 
with at least 2 eligible days of data per subject in each study arm (inpatient and outpatient). Glucose patter ns 
will b e analyzed based on the Ambulatory Glucose Profile, recently endorsed by an international expert as a 
standardized approach for CGM  interpretation 44. Hospital g lucose values after the first day of insulin  treatment 
will be included in the analysis to allow us to have a full 24 -hrs glucose profile and to avoid analyzing day -1 
CGM values which may have low er accuracy. For clinical accuracy, CGM and POC BG will be paired and will  
be plot i n the Clarke Error G rid 46,47. Paired CGM and POC BG falling in the Zone A will be defined as 
“accurate”, and in Zone B as “acceptable”, with remaining values considered “not acceptable” if falling in Zone 
C, D, or E.  
A total of 10 5 (first five randomized subjects will not be included in the statistical analysis, instead, we will 
review any potential issues with recording/downloading data from their sensors to troubleshoot any possible 
problems with the software ) insulin treated patie nts will be included in this prospective observational study.  
Based on previous studies by our unit, we anticipate that 80% of patients will complete the inpatient and 
ambulatory arms of the study  13,48. 
 
V.  Meth ods and Procedures Applied to Human Subjects:  
Potential Risk to Human Subjects  
Hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia in non -ICU patients treated with basal -bolus insulin is between 12%–
35% 14,19,37,49. In this ana lysis, hypoglycemia is defined as a BG or IG < 70 mg/dL. Clinical si gnificant 
hypoglycemia is defined as BG or IG < 5 4 mg/dl. Severe hypoglycemia is defined as BG or IG < 40 mg/dL.  
CGM OBSERVATIONAL VERSION 09.09.2019             11 
 Use of CGM.  No major risks are expected with the use of the CGM device. Pai n and bleeding with insertion is 
minimal. Skin irritation may occur in those sensitive to adhesives. Other potential risks and drawbacks of using 
CGM described in the literature including unrealistic expectations, overly -aggressive correction of elevated 
glucose levels, and alerts and alarms won’t be an issue in this study  because we will use blinded CGM . 
 
Protection against Risks  
We will follow safeguards to minimize the risk to our subjects: a) we will carefully monitor capillary BG at the 
bedside using a  hand -held glucose meter, b) only experienced nurses/or phlebotomist will draw blood samples, 
and c) women of reproductive age w ho are sexually active will undergo a urine pregnancy tests prior to 
participation in the study.  To prevent significant clinica l events, no patients with history of significant liver, 
renal impairment or cardiac failure will be recruited in this study.   
We expect that approximately 10% in the inpatient setting and ~20% in the outpatient (post -discharge) arm will 
experience one or  more episodes of hypoglycemia.  To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, the starting dose 
will be reduced in the basal bolus insu lin regimen (TDD: 0.4 units per kg of body weight), in addition, in 
patients ≥ 70 years of age and/or eGFR < 60 ml/min the TTD w ill be further reduce to 0.3 units/kg.  To avoid 
hypoglycemia, the total daily dose of insulin will be decreased by 10% for BG b etween 70 -99 mg/dl and by 
20% after each episode of hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dl).  In addition, in patients treated with insulin  at home, 
the TDD of insulin will be reduced by 20% on admission and the attending physician may further reduce insulin 
dose in the presence of severe hypoglycemia.  
Hypoglycemia will be treated with dextrose infusion.  Dextrose 50% solution will be given f or glucose values < 
70 mg/dl.  If the patient is awake, 25 ml (1/2 amp) will be given IV or oral juice/snack (crackers) as per 
protocol.  If the patient is not awake:  50  ml (1 amp) will be given STAT.  Blood glucose levels will be repeated 
in 15 minutes a nd dextrose administration will be repeated as needed for values < 70 mg/dl.   
Insertion of the CGM sensor will be performed per  manufacture r instructions, and following an aseptic 
technique. After insertion of the sensors, providers will ensure proper hem ostasis is achieved. Sensors will be 
removed if prolonged bleeding or severe pain occurs.  
Recruitment and Consent . Coordinators  will screen for potential participants from the electronic medical 
record. Subjects will be provided with sufficient informatio n on the practice of glucose monitoring before 
providing written consent. The process of obtaining informed consent will follow the standard procedures of 
Emory University. This protocol will be submitted for approval by the Emory IRB.   
Potential Benefits  to Human Subjects .  Subject participating in this trial will not receive any direct benefits 
during the hospital stay, since treatment decision will be made based on POC BG  (standard of care) . In the 
discharge follow up , investigators will analyze glucose  profiles in a more detailed manner with potential for 
better treatment modifications  in the future .   
Inclusion of chil dren . No patients under the age of 18 will be recruited in this study.  
Confidentiality.  Informed consent will follow the procedure of E mory University Institutional Review Board.   
Every potential participant will be informed in writing and verbally with the important and key points of the 
study.   One of the investigators or research coordinators will obtain a witnessed informed consent prior to 
inclusion of a patient into the study.  Data collection records with personal identifiers will be stored in loc ked 
file cabinets.  Presentation of the study results at regional or scientific meetings or in publications will not 
identify subjects.  Access to research and confidential records will be limited to clinical investigators, 
coordinators and the IRB at Emor y University.  
Payment for Participation.  Participation in this study is voluntary.  Patients will receive one hundred dollars 
($100.00)  during the hospital stay and fifty dollars ($50.00) at the follow up  visit 10 days  after discharge. Total 
CGM OBSERVATIONAL VERSION 09.09.2019             12 
 compensation will be one hundred and fifty dollars ($ 150). Transportation to outpatient clinic visit will be 
arranged for those who need  transportati on. 
Financial Obligation.   No additional cost to patients or to the institution will be incurred for research purposes. 
Research studies will be performed at no cost to study subjects. CGM  will be provided by the sponsor at no cost 
to participants.   
Resea rch Injuries.  If a patien t is injured because of taking part in this study, Dr. Umpierrez and investigators, 
along with the medical facility will make medical care available to the patient at the patient’s own cost.  
Financial compensation for such things as lost wages, disability  or discomfort due to an injury related to the 
study is not available.   
Financial Conflict of Interests.  None of the investigators in this study have any outside activities that may 
represent a conflict of interest.  None of the investigators have an eco nomic interest in an outside entity, or act 
as officers, directors, employees or consultants with such an entity, whose financial interest may be affected by 
this research study.  
Informed Consent.  After identification of eligible p atients these individuals  will be provided basic 
information regarding the study and, if interested, they will then be screened by research staff using the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria delineated elsewhere in this protocol.  The consent form, potential ris ks and 
benefits, and the rights of research participants will be explained to the participant by the investigators or 
research coordinator.  Individuals will be asked if they have any questions, and research staff will answer these 
questions.  The principa l investigator will also be available to answer questions that participants may have 
during the consent procedure or during the time a participant is enrolled in the study.  The consent form will be 
completed in accordance with the IRB guidelines of Emory University.  A signed cop y of the consent form will 
be provided to the participant and a copy will be placed in the file that is maintained for each participant in the 
study office.

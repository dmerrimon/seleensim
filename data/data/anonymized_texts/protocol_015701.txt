CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
The main purpose of this amendment is to remove the 1 -year limitation on the study enrollment 
period and to align with prior correspondence with a regulatory agency.  
Description of Change  Brief Rationale  Sections Changed  
Removed the 1 -year limitation on the 
recruitment period.  This change was made to increase 
flexibility for study recruitment 
due to enrollment holds caused 
by the global pandemic.  Clincal Study Protocol Synopsis: 
Study Design, Sample Size  
Section  6.1 Study Description 
and Duration   
Section  7.1 Number of Patients 
Planned  
The definition of evaluable for 
improvement for facial edema and 
peripheral edema was changed to require a 
severity of at least 3 points out of 5 at 
baseline rather than 2 points out of 5 at 
baseline.  
 This was a correction on the 
definition of an evaluable patient 
for facial and peripheral edema 
assessments. The 5 -point scale 
used would not be able t o 
accommodate a 2 -point 
worsening for a patient with a 
score of 2 at baseline.  Clincal Study Protocol Synopsis: 
Outcomes/Endpoints  
Section  5.1 Primary Outcome  
 
For the primary endpoint, the definition 
was revised for improvement and 
worsening. An increase  or decrease of 
25 points or more, respectively, will be 
used for improvement or worsening on the 
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory  
(PedsQL) gastrointestinal (GI) Symptoms 
Scale for the stomach pain and hurt sub -
scale.  
For the secondary endpoint on 
impro vement in each patient’s most 
bothersome sign/symptom, revised 
definition for improvement to an increase 
of 25  points or more on the PedsQL GI 
Symptoms Scale: nausea and vomiting 
subscale, and the definition for patients 
who are evaluable for improvement w as 
revised to patients with a score of ≤75 at 
baseline. Correspondingly, for the diarrhea 
sub-scale, worsening is defined as a 
decrease of 25 -points or more.  This change was made to address 
a comment from a regulatory 
agency regarding a more 
clinically mea ningful within -
patient change in scores. A 25 -
point change on the transformed 
score reflects a 1 -category change 
on the raw score scale.  
 
Corresponding changes were 
made for alignment to a related 
secondary endpoint on 
improvement in each patient’s 
most bo thersome sign/symptom 
and secondary endpoints on the 
proportion of patients who 
maintain disease control.  Clinical  Study Protocol Synopsis: 
Outcomes/Endpoints

Section  5.1 Primary Outcome  
Section  5.2 Secondary Outcom es 
 
Removed screening value from the 
definition of baseline for facial and 
peripheral edema. The baseline value will 
be used.  This change was made to align 
the definitions of baseline for 
edema with those for albumin and 
symptom scales.  Section  11.4.3.1  Primary Efficacy

CONFIDENTIAL  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  Sections Changed  
Added time periods (12 -48, 12 -104, [new] 
24-48, [new] 48 -104 weeks) to secondary 
endpoints on maintenance of control:  
• Proportion of patients with active 
disease at baseline who maintain disease 
control  
• Proportion of patients wit h inactive 
disease on eculizumab at baseline who 
maintain disease control  These analyses were requested by 
a regulatory agency to evaluate 
durability of response during a 
review of the study analysis plan.  Clinical  Study Protocol Synopsis: 
Outcomes/Endpoin ts  
Section  5.2 Secondary Outcomes  
Replaced bowel movement with PedsQL 
GI Symptoms Scales diarrhea subscale in 
the definition of maintenance of disease 
control. A definition of worsening based 
on the PedsQL GI Symptoms Scales 
diarrhea subscale is provided.  This correction was necessary as 
bowel movement e -diary is not 
continued after week  24. The 
definition of worsening for the 
PedsQL GI Symptoms Scales 
diarrhea subscale is provided.  Clinical  Study Protocol Synopsis: 
Outcomes/Endpoints   
Section  5.2 Secondary Outcomes  
 
Removed language to exclude patients 
without an evaluable core symptom from 
the primary efficacy analysis.  This language was removed to 
align with regulatory agency 
feedback.  Clinical  Study Protocol Synopsis:

The following table outlines the changes made to the protocol and the affected sections:  
Description of Change  Brief Rationale  Sections Changed  
Allowed an extended screening period up to 
approximately 10 weeks for patients who:  
(1) require additional time to complete 
meningococcal vaccinations  
(2) must physically relocate to the vicinity 
of a study center  
(3) are pending their screening laboratory 
results  
(4) have other requirements, which will be 
evaluated  on a case by case basis after 
a discussion between the sponsor and

Title  An Open -Label Efficacy and Safety Study of Pozelimab in Patients with 
CD55 -Deficient Protein -Losing Enteropathy (CHAPLE Disease)  
Site Locations  
 Principal Investigator  Multiple International Sites  
 
Objectives  The primary objective of the study is to determine the effect of pozelimab on 
active  CD55 -deficient protein -losing enteropathy (PLE; CHAPLE), as 
measured by:  
1. Normalization of serum albumin, and  
2. Improvement in the following clinical outcomes that are evaluable 
for improvement at baseline, without worsening of the others, after 
24 weeks of treatment (assessed at week  24):  
• Daily bowel movement frequency  
• The presence and severity of facial or peripheral edema  
• The patient/caregiver assessment of abdominal pain frequency  
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pozelimab in patients 
with CD55 -deficient PLE disease  
• To evaluate the effect of pozelimab on CD55 -deficient PLE 
(both patients with active disease at baseline and those with 
inactive disease on ecul izumab, switching to pozelimab)  
• To determine the effects of pozelimab on albumin and other 
serum proteins (total protein, immunoglobulins)  
• To determine the effects of pozelimab on ascites  
• To determine the effects of pozelimab on stool consistency  
• To determ ine the effect of pozelimab on health -related quality 
of life  
• To determine the effect of pozelimab on lab abnormalities 
observed in CD55 -deficient PLE such as hypertriglyceridemia, 
thrombocytosis, and hypovitaminosis B12  
• To describe the effects of pozelima b on the sparing of 
concomitant medications and reduction in hospitalization days  
• To determine the effects of pozelimab on growth  
• To characterize the concentration of pozelimab in patients 
with CD55 -deficient PLE  
• To assess the occurrence of anti -drug antib ody (ADA) for 
pozelimab in patients with CD55 -deficient PLE

CONFIDENTIAL  Study Design  R3918 -PLE-1878 is an open label, single arm, 144 -week treatment study in 
patients aged 1 year and older with active clinical signs and symptoms of 
CD55 -deficient PLE/CHAPLE disease, and a CD55 loss -of-function 
mutation detected by genotype analysis (frameshift, nonsense mutations). In 
the case of missense or suspected splice site mutations, CD55 -deficient PLE 
is to be confirmed by flow cytometry of peripheral blood cells. The first 
2 patients enrolled will be of age 6 years or older (exception will be made for 
patients under 6 years of age with life -threatening disease).  
A minimum of 6 patients with active PLE will be enrolled, up to 
approximately 20  patients. The primary analysis will  occur when 
approximately 6  patients with active PLE have received 24  weeks of 
treatment. Subsequent analyses will occur 1 and 2  years after the first dose in 
the last patient enrolled.  
The study consists of a screening period (up to 4 weeks [or up to 10 w eeks 
for patients with extenuating circumstances]) followed by a  144-week 
treatment period (from week  0 to week  144, with final dose at week 143), and 
a follow -up period (from week  145 to week  164).  
Patients will be given a single loading dose of pozelima b 30  mg/kg 
intravenously (IV) on day 1, then fixed doses subcutaneously (SC) (based on 
body weight) QW (±2 days) over the treatment period.  
Only patients with active PLE will be included in the primary analysis. Active 
PLE is defined as hypoalbuminemia of  less than or equal to 3.2 g/dL within 
the screening period, and within the last 6 months, at least 7 days (which do 
not have to be consecutive) of 1 or more of the following symptoms or signs: 
diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, peripheral or facial edema , an episode of 
infection with concomitant hypogammaglobulinemia, or a new thrombotic 
event.  
Study Duration  The duration of the study for a patient is approximately 165 weeks (from 
week  0 to week  164), excluding the screening period.  
End of Study Defini tion The end of study is defined as the last visit of the last patient.  
Population   
 Sample Size:  A minimum of 6 patients with active PLE will be enrolled, up to 
approximately 20  patients.  
Eligible patients with inactive PLE may also be enrolled, but their data will 
not be included in the primary analysis.  
 Target Population:  Patients aged 1 year and older with a clinical diagnosis of CD55 -deficient 
PLE disease, with CD55 loss of function mutation determined by genetic 
analysis (frameshift, nonsense mutations) and confirmed (only necessary in 
the case of missense or suspected splice site mutations) by flow cytometry or 
western blotting CD55 on peripheral blood cells. The first 2  patients must be 
aged 6  years and older (exception will be made for patie nts under 6 years of 
age with life -threatening disease).

Outcomes/Endpoints   
 Primary:  The primary endpoint at week  24 is the proportion of patients with active 
disease at baseline achieving both of the following:  
• Normalization of serum albumin, defined as  
− serum albumin within the normal  range at at least 70% of 
measurements between week 12 and week 24, and  
− no single albumin measurement of <2.5 g/dL between 
week  12 and week 24, and  
− no requirement for albumin infusion between week 12 and 
week  24  
• Improvement in the following clinical outco mes that were evaluable 
for improvement at baseline, with no worsening of the others (ie, 
those not evaluable for improvement) at week  24: 
− The number of bowel movements per day, based on a 1 -week 
average, captured by e -diary. Improvement is defined as a 
reduction of 50% or more in the number of daily bowel 
movements based on a 1 -week average. Patients evaluable for 
improvement are defined as those with an average of 3 or 
more bowel movements per day at baseline. Worsening is 
defined as an increase of 30% or  more  
− Physician assessment of facial edema (based on a 5 -point 
Likert scale). Improvement is defined as a reduction of 
2 points or more. Patients evaluable for improvement are 
defined as those with a severity of at least 3 points out of 5 at 
baseline. Wors ening is defined as an increase of 2 points or 
more  
− Physician assessment of peripheral edema (based on a 5 -point 
Likert scale). Improvement is defined as a reduction of 
2 points or more. Patients evaluable for improvement are 
defined as those with a severi ty of at least 3 points out of 5 at 
baseline. Worsening is defined as an increase of 2 points or 
more  
− Patient/caregiver assessment of abdominal pain frequency as 
assessed by the Stomach pain and hurt sub -scale of the 
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Pe dsQL™) 
Gastrointestinal (GI) Symptom Scale. Improvement is defined 
as an increase of 25  points or more. Patients evaluable for 
improvement are those with a score of 70 points or less at 
baseline. Worsening is defined as a decrease of 25 points or 
more

week  24, as determined prior to baseline using a semi -structur ed 
concept elicitation interview, from amongst the ‘core’ clinical 
endpoints of frequency of bowel movements, peripheral edema, 
facial edema, abdominal pain frequency (as described previously), 
nausea, vomiting, and stool consistency:  
− Improvement in nausea  and vomiting will be defined as an 
increase of 25 points or more on the 0 to 100 transformed 
nausea and vomiting subscale of the PedsQL GI Symptom 
Scale score where lower scores indicate worse nausea and 
vomiting. Patients will be evaluable for improvemen t in nausea 
and vomiting if they have a score ≤75 on the nausea and 
vomiting subscale at baseline  
− Improvement in stool consistency will be defined as a 
reduction of ≥50% in the number of days per week that the 
patient has a bowel movement of loose/watery c onsistency. A 
bowel movement is considered to be loose/watery if it 
corresponds to 3 images of loose or watery stools on the 
Brussels Infant and Toddler Stool Scale (BITSS), the images 
and descriptors for categories 4 or 5 on the modified Bristol 
Stool For m Scale for Children (mBSFS -C), and the images and 
descriptors for categories 6 or 7 of the Bristol Stool Form Scale 
(BSFS). To be evaluable for improvement in stool consistency, 
patients must have a bowel movement of loose/watery stool 
consistency for ≥2 days/week at baseline

Procedur es and Assessments  The efficacy procedures include laboratory measurements of serum albumin, 
protein, and immunoglobulins, and other laboratory abnormalities 
characteristic of PLE. Clinical assessments include those for global disease 
activity, edema, and ascites (characteristic clinical features of PLE). Patient 
or caregiver -reported outcomes include those for global disease assessment, 
common PLE symptoms, and health -related quality of life. Effect on 
healthcare utilization will be determined by quantifyi ng the sparing and 
withdrawal of concomitant therapies and the reduction of hospitalization 
days. Effects on growth and maturation will be assessed using weight, height, 
and pubertal Tanner staging. Evaluation of dosing regimen will be assessed 
using blood  concentration of pozelimab and CH50, a pharmacodynamic 
marker.  
Overall safety will be assessed by monitoring/evaluation of TEAEs, physical 
examinations, and clinical safety laboratory tests at prespecified time points. 
Samples for drug concentration will be collected, and the potential emergence 
of anti -pozelimab antibodies will also be evaluated.

CONFIDENTIAL  Statistical Plan  The primary objective of the study is to determine the effect of pozelimab on 
CD55 -deficient PLE/CHAPLE disease in patients with active disease  at 
baseline. The primary outcome is the achievement of both of the following: 
(1) normalization of serum albumin, and (2) improvement from baseline to 
week 24 in the prespecified clinical outcomes that were evaluable for 
improvement at baseline, with no w orsening of the others. The primary 
endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving the primary outcome.  
Justification for the sample size . The study is regarded as successful if at 
least 4 of 6 patients achieve the primary endpoint. Unpublished patient -level 
data of 14 patients treated with eculizumab were made available to the study 
sponsor. In the historical control period before initiating eculizumab, 0 of 
14 patients met the primary endpoint (90% exact confidence interval (CI): 
[0.00, 0.19]). If 4 of 6 evaluable patients treated with pozelimab achieve the 
primary endpoint, the 90% exact CI for the probability of achieving the 
primary endpoint is (0.27, 0.94), with the lower limit of 0.27 clearly greater 
than the upper limit of 0.19 for the historical c ontrol period of the 14  patients. 
By a Bayesian analysis, a comparison between 4 of 6  pozelimab -treated 
patients achieving the primary endpoint and 0 of 14 in the historical data by 
a Beta -Binomial analysis with the Jefferys prior of Beta(0.5, 0.5) would 
conclude that there is a >99% posterior probability that pozelimab has a 
greater response rate than untreated patients. There would also be a 90% 
posterior probability that the response rate with pozelimab is at least 
0.37 higher than that of untreated pati ents. Thus, the study success criterion 
of observing at least 4 of 6 evaluable patients achieving the primary endpoint 
provides strong evidence of effectiveness.  
All of the 14 eculizumab -treated patients achieved a normalized serum 
albumin level by 12 week s of treatment and required no albumin infusions 
subsequent to treatment initiation (90% exact CI: [0.81, 1.00]). If the true rate 
of achieving the primary endpoint for patients on pozelimab is 0.81 (the lower 
limit of the CI for eculizumab), then a sample  size of 6 gives a probability of 
91% for achieving the study success criterion.   
Primary Efficacy Analysis.  The subset of the full analysis set (FAS) with 
patients having active PLE at baseline will provide the data for the primary 
efficacy analysis. The percentage of patients achieving normalization of 
albumin and achieving improvement in the prespecified evaluable clinical 
outcomes will be calculated and its 90% CI will be reported.  
There are 7 planned albumin measurements between week 12 and week 24, 
inclusive. Patients will be considered non -evaluable for the primary analysis 
if there are fewer than 5 available albumin measurements between week 12 
and week  24. Albumin measurements outside of the visit windows and/or 
carried out at local laboratories wi ll be considered as valid measurements. To 
be considered responders, at least 70% of available measurements must be 
normal (≥3.5 g/dL). Thus, patients with the minimum of 5  available 
measurements must have 4 out of 5 normal. Patients with the planned numbe r 
of 7 measurements must have at least 5 normal. Patients who have more than 
7 available measurements (due to unplanned albumin measurement in local 
labs) must have at least 70% of all available measurements normal.  Non-
responder imputation for patients w ith fewer than 5 available albumin 
measurements between 12 and week 24 will be carried out as a sensitivity 
analysis. The mean changes from baseline in albumin over time and the mean 
number of albumin infusions per half -year will also be estimated. Patient  
profiles of albumin over time will be plotted.

CONFIDENTIAL  There are 4 clinical outcomes that can contribute to the clinical improvement 
component of the primary endpoint. Patients are evaluable for improvement 
in each of these based on activity at baseline. Patients  evaluable for only 1 of 
the 4 clinical outcomes must show improvement (as defined) in that clinical 
outcome and no worsening in the other 3. Patients evaluable for more than 1 
clinical outcome must show improvement for all of their evaluable outcomes 
and no worsening in any non -evaluable outcomes.  
For facial and peripheral edema, the primary analysis will be performed using 
the investigating physician’s report. Clinical photographs will be rated by a 
single, independent central reader blinded to the time point at which the 
photograph was taken. The correlation of central read to physician’s 
assessment will be described. The central read will be used as a sensitivity 
analysis on the primary endpoint.

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
CD55 -deficient protein -losing enteropathy (CD55 -deficient PLE) is a newly described disease and 
potential indication for C5 blockade, also referred to as complement hyperactiv ation, angiopathic 
thrombosis, protein -losing enteropathy (CHAPLE disease) (Kurolap, 2017 ) (Ozen,  2017b ). Of the 
11 patients described by Ozen et al., 9 were from Turkey, 1 was from Syria and 1 was from 
Morocco. Eight of these patients were <2 years old at presentation. Unlike paroxysmal nocturnal 
hemoglobinur ia (PNH), another disease being evaluated for REGN3918 (also known as 
pozelimab), hemolysis has not been observed in CD55 -deficiency patients.  
CD55 -deficient PLE/CHAPLE disease is caused by biallelic loss -of-function mutations in the 
CD55 gene. Clinically,  it manifests as a familial form of protein -losing enteropathy (PLE) caused 
by primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (PIL) or Waldmann’s disease that is frequently severe and 
can be accompanied by lethal systemic manifestations. CD55 is a glycophosphatidylin ositol (GPI) -
anchored membrane protein that inhibits the enzymatic activity of C3b and C4b, thus preventing 
the formation of C3 and C5 convertases that lead ultimately to the assembly of the membrane -
attack complex (C5b –C9). Thus, the absence of CD55 cause s overactivation of the complement 
system, causing the production of various complement products including anaphylatoxins and the 
membrane -attack complex. When absent due to somatic mutation of the PIGA gene (required for 
the biosynthesis of GPI anchors) i n hematopoietic stem cells, CD55 loss, as well as CD59 loss, is 
specific to hematopoietic cells (CD59 is another GPI -linked complement regulatory protein). The 
resultant complement -mediated lysis of red cells and platelets gives rise to intravascular hemol ysis 
and thrombosis, in a disease termed PNH. In CD55 -deficient PLE, isolated germ line loss of CD55 
expression in all tissues manifests in the GI tract, as primary intestinal lymphangiectasia, which 
causes PLE. The majority of patients suffer from early -onset GI manifestations, including bloody 
diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, and occasionally develop partial or complete intestinal 
obstruction and intestinal failure. The loss of proteins through the GI tract leads to 
hypoalbuminemia and subsequent p eripheral and facial edema and ascites, as well as 
hypogammaglobulinemia which predisposes to repeat infections. Due to loss of nutrients in the 
intestinal lumen, a malabsorption syndrome ensues, leading to vitamin and micronutrient 
deficiencies and severe ly impaired growth. As for PNH and other examples of complement 
disorders, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and transplant thrombotic 
microangiopathy, CD55 -deficient PLE patients are susceptible to thrombosis, particularly in 
mesenteric and hepat ic veins, and it is the thrombotic manifestation that leads to intestinal and 
hepatic failure, and most frequently leads to early mortality. Patients with CD55 deficiency 
frequently manifest with thrombocytosis.  
Following its discovery in 2017, CD55 -defici ent PLE/CHAPLE disease has to date been described 
in 14 patients (Kurolap, 2017 ) (Ozen, 2017b ). Age of onset in these 14 patients was less than 1  year 
in three, 1 year of age in five, 2 -3 years in three, and 4 to 10 years in three. Severity ranges from 
subclinical PLE (described in 3 relatives of 14 published pa tients) to early fatality (in 3 of the 
14 published patients). A hallmark of CD55 -deficient PLE disease, and PLE in general, is a 
decrease in serum proteins: all described patients demonstrate hypoalbuminemia and 
hypogammaglobulinemia. While a proportion o f patients with CD55 -deficient PLE display 
features of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and receive IBD medications (to which they are 
generally refractory), a greater percentage present with symptoms attributable to 
hypoalbuminemia, namely, edema. A typic al case is a child with infantile onset of facial and 
                                        VV-RIM-00158650-1.0 Approved - 01 Feb 2022 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  extremity edema in relation to hypoalbuminemia, with or without diarrhea, who requires frequent 
hospital admissions to receive albumin infusion. Due to malabsorption, these patients commonly 
show growth  failure, and some have delay in pubertal development. The more severely affected 
cases develop mesenteric venous thrombosis that is frequently associated with retrograde 
extension and cardiac involvement, as well as embolic complications. It appears that once the 
thrombotic complications develop, the patients follow a chronic course of increasing debilitation, 
eventually leading to premature death. Treatment has typically included corticosteroids, IVIg or 
SCIg, intravenous (IV) albumin, biologic immunomodu lators (anti -tumor necrosis factor [TNF], 
vedolizumab), small molecule immunomodulators (e.g. azathioprine, mesalazine), micronutrients, 
enteral or parenteral feeding, anti -coagulants (low -molecular -weight heparin, aspirin), antibiotics, 
anticoagulants, an d anti -platelet agents (Kurolap, 2017 ). In spite of these therapies, the long -term 
morbidity and risk of mortality remains high. In keeping  with the role of CD55 absence in 
pathogenesis, eculizumab, which is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the 
terminal complement protein C5, alleviates disease, with an immediate recovery of PLE and in 
children, improved growth, with the cessa tion of other medications. Eculizumab has been made 
available to some patients through a compassionate use program but is not currently approved for 
the treatment of CD55 -deficient PLE/CHAPLE disease nor, based on a search of public records, 
does there app ear to be an ongoing development program.  
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. intends to develop pozelimab for the treatment of CD55 -deficient 
PLE/CHAPLE. Pozelimab is a fully human, monoclonal immunoglobulin G4P (IgG4P) antibody 
directed against the terminal  complement protein C5 that inhibits terminal complement activation 
by blocking cleavage of C5 into C5a (anaphylatoxin) and C5b, thereby blocking the formation of 
the membrane -attack complex (C5b -C9, a structure -mediating cell lysis. Pozelimab is being 
developed for the treatment of PNH and other diseases in which tissue damage is mediated by the 
terminal complement pathway activity. Pozelimab can be administered by IV or subcutaneous 
(SC) administration. Additionally, pozelimab binds to polymorphic variati ons in C5 that are not 
recognized by eculizumab.

CONFIDENTIAL  3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIO NALE  
3.1. Hypothesis  
Pozelimab treatment will result in normalizat ion of serum albumin and improvement in clinical 
signs and symptoms in CD55 -deficient PLE/CHAPLE disease.  
3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
CD55 -deficient PLE is a life -threatening, ultra -orphan disease of infants, children, adolescents, 
and young adult s with no current approved therapy. There are approximately 40  patients across 
the world known to have this disease as of December 2018. R3918 -PLE-1878 is an open -label 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pozelimab in 4 to 20 patients with CD55 -deficient PLE, 
as an addition to standard -of-care therapies (excluding eculizumab). The rationale for an open -
label study is that the disease is too severe for patients to be allocated to a placebo group, and that 
there are no suitable active comparator ther apies available. There are reports of cases that suggest 
that a similar anti -C5 monoclonal antibody drug, eculizumab, significantly improves the clinical 
condition of patients with CD55 -deficient PLE and there is a very high likelihood, given the similar 
mechanism of action of eculizumab and pozelimab, that pozelimab will have a similar effect. 
CD55 -deficient PLE is a serious condition for which patients may experience disease progression 
over the period of the study if they do not receive active treatment.  The expected effect of treatment 
is expected to be large enough to distinguish the effect of treatment with pozelimab from the 
underlying disease progression accounting for its variability over time. The intent of this study is 
to generate the first effic acy and safety data from a clinical study for the anti -C5 therapeutic class 
in this indication, and to support licensure for the treatment of CD55 -deficient PLE with 
pozelimab. The study population has been designed (based on an analysis of data obtained f rom 
13 patients prior to and after eculizumab treatment) to maximize the inclusion of patients from 
among the known global patient population (which currently stands at 23  individuals, of which 17 
are known to be on eculizumab treatment and in remission). The following types of patients may 
be included:  
• Patients with active PLE who are naïve to eculizumab therapy. Active PLE is defined 
as: hypoalbuminemia of less than or equal to 3.2 g/dL within the screening period; and, 
within the last 6 months, at least 7 days (which do not have to be consecutive) of 1 or 
more of the following symptoms or signs: diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
peripheral or facial edema, or an episode of infection with concomitant 
hypogammaglobulinemia, or a new thrombotic event.  
• Patients with active PLE who were previously taking eculizumab, and stopped it 
because of access issues, or because their physician withdrew it in the expectation that 
they would remain inactive, or because they were refractory to it due to the Arg885His 
varia nt in the C5 gene (which is unable to bind to eculizumab).

CONFIDENTIAL  • Patients on treatment with eculizumab, with inactive or controlled disease, who elect 
to switch from an IV to an SC anti -C5 treatment. These patients will switch from 
eculizumab to pozelimab witho ut an interruption of anti -C5 treatment to limit the risk 
of loss of disease control. In these patients, eculizumab should be discontinued during 
the screening period, and pozelimab started at the time that the next scheduled 
eculizumab dose would have tak en place. These patients will not contribute data 
towards the primary endpoint but will provide supportive safety and efficacy data.  
The definition of inactive PLE is any case of PLE which fails to meet the definition of active 
disease as per definition ab ove. This should not include patients whose future access to eculizumab 
would be compromised, ie, those on the Alexion compassionate use program, with no likelihood 
of finding alternative reimbursement for eculizumab. Regeneron will not provide for patient s to 
be treated with eculizumab at any time during or after the study.  
Rationale for a study in pediatric patients : CD55 -deficient PLE is a life -threatening, ultra -
orphan disease with no current approved therapy. Pozelimab was well -tolerated in toxicology 
studies in adolescent (13 -week study) and adult (26 -week study) cynomolgus monkeys at doses 
up to 100 mg/kg/week via IV administration for up to 26 weeks. The no observable adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) based on the results of these toxicology studies was d etermined to be 100  mg/kg, 
the highest dose tested. To date, toxicology studies in juvenile animals have not been conducted 
for pozelimab. Available adult safety data, known target biology, and the lack of target organs 
identified in nonclinical toxicology  (13- and 26 -week) studies are expected to support dosing in 
the proposed patient population. Enhanced pre - and post -natal development (ePPND) data 
generation will run in parallel and is expected to be supportive of marketing authorization/BLA in 
pediatric  patients. The safety and effectiveness of Soliris® for the treatment of aHUS have been 
established in pediatric patients and supported by evidence from 4  adequate and well -controlled 
clinical studies (Soliris package insert, 2019 ). To mitigate the potential risk in very young patients, 
the first 2 patients recruited into the trial should be 6  years of age or older and safety through 
week  12 will be assessed before inclusion of pediatric patients 1 year and older. Exceptions to this  
rule will be made if patients younger than 6 years of age present with life -threatening disease prior 
to the availability of 12 weeks of data in 2 patients aged 6 years or older. Examples of life -
threatening disease include, but are not limited to: hemody namic compromise from severe edema 
or from evolving thrombosis, bowel intussusception or ileus. The decision to allow exceptions will 
be made in conjunction with the medical director, steering committee, and will require approval 
from senior Regeneron medi cal staff and Ethics Committee (EC)/Institutional Review Board 
(IRB). Depending on local policy, input from health authority may be sought before proceeding. 
As of 13 March 2020, 1 patient (aged greater than 6  years) has been recruited. There is a patient 
aged 5 years and 5 months with severe edema and serum albumin as low as 1.0  g/dL, requiring 
high dose intermittent steroids and intermittent albumin infusions, daily at their most frequent. 
Intravenous access is unreliable and when not available the edema has progressed to life -
threatening hemodynamic compromise. An expedited request for EC approval to enroll this patient 
is currently in progress.

CONFIDENTIAL  Evidence of pozelimab efficacy will be based on (a) an induction and maintenance of response 
with respect to no rmalization of serum albumin in active patients and (b) improvement in a clinical 
endpoint in active patients, as the 2 components of the primary endpoint (Section  5.1). 
Maintenance of response in switch patients will be measured and reported as supportive evidence. 
Given the ultra -rare nature of this condition and very small size of the study, the albumin endpoint 
has been designed to capture both inducti on and maintenance, and maintenance alone, so that it 
can be applied to every patient. Namely, that albumin measured between week  12 (allowing time 
for both the active patients to respond, and the switch patients to wash -out residual eculizumab) 
and week  24 (allowing for time to demonstrate maintenance of effect) is normalized. Sustained 
normalization of albumin as a primary endpoint is objective and stringent and has never been 
achieved through the use of existing standard of care prior to the advent of an ti-C5 therapy in all 
known patients. Serum albumin also has clinical meaning: Facial and peripheral edema and GI 
symptoms are directly correlated with the albumin level, since they are caused by a decrease in the 
oncotic pressure that is maintained by albu min. Furthermore, IV albumin infusions are an 
established standard therapy in PLE and temporarily improve these clinical manifestations, in 
parallel with a temporary increase in the albumin level. The decision to treat with albumin is made 
based on monitor ing of the albumin level. Taken together, these factors argue that the albumin 
level is clinically meaningful. The first component of the primary endpoint is: the proportion of 
patients with at least 70% of albumin measurements within the normal range betw een week  12 
(allowing time for both the active patients to respond, and the switch patients to wash -out residual 
eculizumab) and week  24 (allowing a full 3  months to demonstrate maintenance). Albumin normal 
range varies little between labs and is typically  3.5 to 5.5  g/dL. The upper limit for active PLE 
patients was set at 3.2 g/dL based on a review of data from 7 Turkish and 3 Israeli patients (Ozen 
unpublished data; Baris -Feldman unpublished data). In up to 15 years of pre -eculizumab follow -
up in these pa tients, the albumin never went above 3.2 g/dL nor showed a short -term increase of 
1 g/dL (absent having received an albumin infusion). Following eculizumab treatment, all 
10 patients showed a normalization of the mean albumin level using measurements taken  between 
weeks 12 and 24, and all 10 patients showed an increase from baseline of at least 1  g/dL on at least 
1 occasion between weeks 12 and 24. We will collect all available pre -study albumin (as well as 
other relevant laboratory and clinical) data on al l patients. A patient who receives an albumin 
infusion between weeks  12 and 24  will be considered a non -responder: in the historical data set, 
no patient required any albumin infusion while on treatment with eculizumab.  Patients will also 
be considered a  non-responder if any single albumin value is <2.5 g/dL  after between weeks  12 
and 24 . 
An improvement in clinical endpoints will be the second component of the primary endpoint. A 
range of clinical endpoints have been designed to capture patient benefit, due to the paucity of 
quantitative data regarding the clinical effect of eculizumab, and due to variability of clinical 
manifestations: there is no single clinical manifestation that occurs in every patient. Some of the 
clinical endpoints are included with in the primary endpoint; others are included as secondary. Four 
clinical endpoints were selected for inclusion in the primary endpoint on the basis of: a relatively 
higher prevalence in the patient population, a relatively stronger face validity for meanin gfulness, 
and a relatively greater degree of objective quantification. Frequent bowel movements emerged as 
commonly experienced by patients with the disease. In an analysis of data from 13 patients prior 
to and following eculizumab treatment, 8/13 patients  had average daily bowel movements 
(measured over a week) of 3 or more. Of these 8 patients, 7 showed a reduction of at least 50%.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 38 of 109 
CONFIDENTIAL  Only 4/13 patients had bowel movements of more than 4  times a day, and all 4  patients showed an 
improvement of at least 50%. Based on published literature and discussions with physicians with 
experience treating patients with CD55 -deficient PLE, abdominal pain was also identified as a 
prevalent aspect of disease. Frequency of abdominal pain is quantifiable using an existing pati ent 
reported outcome measure, the PedsQL GI Symptoms Scales' Stomach Pain and Hurt Subscale 
(Varni, 2012 ). The definition of a responder, ie, a 25 -point change on the transformed score, 
reflects a 1 -category change on the raw score scale. The scores at which patients will be considered 
evaluable for improvement is 70 or less because th e average score on the subscale tended to be 
less than 70 for patients with GI diseases (range: 63.8 to 71.9) (Varni, 2015b ) (Varni, 2015c ) 
(Varni, 2016 ). Facial and peripheral edema was also a prevalent aspect of disease but due to a lack 
of suitable existing measurement tools (with nothing available for children and for facial edema), 
we have developed Likert scales for the physician to grade the severity of edema. For the peripheral 
edema scale we have adopted re sponse options from an existing developed clinician -reported 
outcome assessment (Brodovicz, 2009 ). 
To mitigate the risk that our pre -defined responder thresholds do not perform adequately, we will 
use anchor -based methods using the patient/caregiver globals as anchors to assess the responder 
definition for the individual endpoints. Concept elicitation interviews conducted during the 
screening period will also be used to elicit each patient’s most bothersome sign /symptom from 
amongst those included in the core sign/symptom concepts of disease. Exit interviews will also be 
conducted on the date the primary endpoints will be assessed. The qualitative data from the exit 
interviews will also be used to interpret trial  results and to further understand whether the observed 
changes were meaningful from the perspective of the patient/caregiver.  
3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
Following an IV loading dose of 30 mg/kg, pozelimab will be administered SC weekly at doses 
dependin g on body weight (BW) as follows:   
• For BW <  10 kg: 125 mg  
• For BW ≥10 kg and <20 kg: 200 mg  
• For BW ≥20 kg and <40 kg: 350 mg  
• For BW ≥40 kg and <60 kg: 500 mg  
• For BW ≥60 kg: 800 mg  
These doses were selected to achieve, in modeling, similar peak and trough p ozelimab 
concentrations in serum as those shown to completely inhibit C5 activity (as assessed by 
suppression of ex vivo hemolysis through the CH50 assay) in healthy adult subjects. These are the 
doses chosen for the study of adult PNH patients (30 mg/kg I V loading dose followed by a weekly 
dose of 800 mg SC) in study R3918 -PNH -1852. The predicted peak concentrations of 600  to 
700 mg/L have been observed in study R3918 -HV-1659 in healthy volunteers and have been 
shown to be well tolerated; the predicted tro ugh concentration of 400 mg/L is above the 
concentration considered minimally necessary to achieve maximal suppression of C5 activity for 
all patients, and allows for the variability and uncertainty in pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics 
(PK/PD). There is a  theoretical consideration that increased enteric protein loss very early in 
treatment might require an upwards correction of the loading dose. However, the published data 
                                        VV-RIM-00158650-1.0 Approved - 01 Feb 2022 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  on eculizumab -treated patients report that free C5 concentrations fall to the lower limit of 
quantification within 3 days of first infusion, along with clinical improvement in all 3 patients 
within the first 12 hours of treatment, using a standard IV dose of eculizumab (ie, the maintenance 
dose tiered by body weight according to the label  for pediatric patients with atypical hemolytic 
uremic syndrome, in which there is no enteric protein loss) (Kurolap,  2017 ) (Soliris package insert,  
2019 ). These data suggest that increased e nteric protein loss early in treatment is unlikely to result 
in a pharmacologically meaningful reduction in therapeutic monoclonal antibody concentration.  
Pozelimab has been evaluated in a randomized, placebo -controlled double -blind study 
(R3918 -HV-1659) i n 56 healthy subjects in 7 dose cohorts (N=8, randomized 6:2 
pozelimab:placebo for each cohort). Pozelimab was found to be generally well tolerated in 
ascending single doses of 1,  3, 10, and 30 mg/kg IV and 300 and 600 mg SC. The seventh cohort, 
a multiple -dose cohort of 4  weekly SC doses of 400 mg following a 15 mg/kg IV loading dose, 
resulted in one resolved serious adverse event (SAE) in the study, an episode of salpingitis of 
undetermined etiology. The range of concentrations of pozelimab observed in st udy R3918 -HV-
1659 encompasses the predicted concentrations expected in pediatric patients at the proposed 
dosing regimen. In all 4  IV dosing cohorts, suppression of hemolysis was observed as early as 
15 minutes post -injection. Transient, complete suppressi on of hemolysis was achieved with 
≥ 3 mg/kg dosing. At 30 mg/kg, complete suppression of hemolysis was maintained for 4 weeks, 
consistent with observed, prolonged pozelimab exposure following this dose. In the multiple -dose 
cohort 5, complete suppression o f CH50 was observed over the 4 -week dosing period and up to 
2 weeks after the last SC dosing.  
Pozelimab was well -tolerated in toxicology studies in adolescent (13 -week study) and adult 
(26-week study) cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 100 mg/kg/week via IV  administration for 
up to 26 weeks. The NOAEL based on the results of these toxicology studies was determined to 
be 100  mg/kg, the highest dose tested. To date, toxicology studies in juvenile animals have not 
been conducted for pozelimab. Juvenile toxicolo gy data are not expected to be required to initiate 
trials in a limited number of pediatric (<12 years of age) patients with life -threatening, ultra -orphan 
condition and no approved therapy. Available adult safety data, known target biology, and the lack 
of target organs identified in nonclinical toxicology (13 - and 26 -week) studies are expected to 
support dosing in the proposed patient population. Enhanced pre - and post -natal development 
(ePPND) data generation will run in parallel and is expected to be su pportive of marketing 
authorization/BLA in pediatric patients.

CONFIDENTIAL  3.2.3.  Risk -Benefit Assessment  
CD55 -deficient PLE is a life -threatening, ultra -orphan disease with no current approved therapy. 
Current treatments typically include: corticosteroids, IVIg or SCIg, IV albumin, biologic 
immunomodulators (anti -TNF, vedolizumab), small molecule immunomodulators 
(e.g. azathioprine, mesalazine), micronutrients, enteral or parenteral feeding, ant i-coagulants 
(low-molecular -weight heparin, aspirin), antibiotics, and anti -coagulants (Kurolap, 2017 ). In spite 
of these therapies, the lo ng-term morbidity and risk of mortality remains.  
The benefit of blocking C5 complement activity in PLE is supported from reports of eculizumab, 
which alleviates disease, with an immediate recovery of signs and symptoms of PLE and in 
children, improved grow th, along with the cessation of other medications (Kurolap, 2017 ). 
Pozelimab offers potential additional benefits of better control by pro viding maximal and durable 
inhibition of C5 throughout the dosing interval, improving the dosing regimen, binding to the 
polymorphic variant C5 protein which renders eculizumab ineffective, and development of a SC 
formulation.  
An established risk of blocki ng C5 complement activity is an increased susceptibility to infections, 
specifically to encapsulated organisms, the most potentially severe of which is infection with 
Neisseria meningitidis  (Figueroa, 1991 ). Experience with eculizumab suggests that pretreatment 
with appropriate vaccinations covering multiple serotypes and concurrent therapy with oral 
antibiotics are effective at mitigating this risk (Hill, 2013 )(Soliris package insert, 201 9). Current 
treatment guidelines for PNH and the eculizumab package insert recommend such vaccination 
prior to dosing. In various disease settings such as asplenia in sickle cell disease, and with terminal 
complement deficiency, use of long -term prophyl actic antibiotics has been safely implemented for 
the prevention of encapsulated organisms including N. meningitidis (Gaston,  1986 ) 
(Wedzicha,  2008 ). Because vaccination does not provide 100% coverage to all strains and there 
are no proven titer levels associated with 100% protection, prophylactic oral antibiotics are also 
commonly given to patient s with genetic or pharmacologic deficiency in terminal complement 
activity. Therefore, vaccination prior to administration (or at the time of administration, based on 
local practice, per Section  8.3.1 ) will sufficiently mitigate the risks of single and multiple doses of 
pozelimab in patients to a level that has been considered acceptable in other anti -C5 clinical 
development programs. In addition, con current therapy with oral antibiotics should be considered 
according to local practice (Section  8.3.2 ). 
Recently, serious infections with Neisseria  species (other than N. meningitidis ), including 
disseminated gonococcal infections, have been reported during eculizumab treatment 
(Soliris  package insert, 2019 ). Counseling about Neisseria gonorrhea  prevention, testing, and 
treatment is to be performed in accordance with local practice/national guidelines (see 
Section  8.4). 
There is a potential risk of immune complex formation when switching from eculizumab to 
pozelimab. SKY59, a humanized antibody against C5, is being administered in a clinical trial to 
7 patients with PNH who had been on eculizumab for at least 3 months (Röth, 2018 ). SKY59 is 
administered as IV loading dose 2 weeks after the last dose of eculizumab, and then 1  week later 
patients receive SC administration either weekly, every 2 weeks, or every 4 weeks. In 2 out of 
7 patients, mild to moderate, non -serious, likely drug -target -drug complex -mediated reactions 
with clinical manifestations similar to serum sic kness were observed in the initial post -switch

CONFIDENTIAL  period (days 9 and 10, respectively). These manifestations were treated with topical steroids and 
resolved by day 21 with no interruption in study treatment. The authors noted that in patients 
switching from e culizumab to SKY59, the formation of drug -target -drug complex composed of 
SKY59, C5, and eculizumab is expected due to the different binding epitopes of the 2 antibodies.  
Therefore, during the transition of therapy in patients currently being treated with eculizumab and 
who switch to pozelimab treatment, immune complex formation comprising eculizumab, C5, and 
pozelimab may occur. Although the consequences of this hypothetical complex formation are 
unknown, a potential risk includes immune adverse events (AE s). To mitigate this risk, the 
investigator will maintain heightened awareness, and appropriate safety monitoring during this 
early phase will be included. Also, the loading dose of pozelimab has been designed to generate 
an excess of pozelimab over eculiz umab, a measure intended to avoid the equimolar stoichiometric 
conditions (Regeneron data; report in preparation) that may give rise to higher -order immune 
complexes. Guidance on the management of a suspected immune AE due to drug -target -drug 
immune comple x formations of eculizumab -C5-pozelimab is provided in Section  8.5. 
A risk -benefit statement for pozelimab is provided in the Investigator’s Brochur e. 
3.2.3.1.  Study Conduct in Response to COVID -19 
Recognizing that the “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID -19) pandemic will have an impact on 
the conduct of clinical trials, the sponsor does not intend to screen any subjects in this study until 
the impact of the COV ID-19 pandemic is deemed manageable and no longer interfering with the 
conduct of trials at individual sites, and subjects can safely participate in this study. Until then, the 
sponsor plans to obtain approvals from Health Authorities/Ethics Committees to enable initiation 
of study sites for this study, as allowed by local laws and regulations.

CONFIDENTIAL  5. PRIMARY AND SECONDAR Y OUTCOMES  
5.1. Primary Outcome  
The primary endpoint at week 24 is the proportion of patients with active disease at baseline 
achieving both of the following:  
• Normalization of serum albumin, defined as  
− serum albumin w ithin the normal range at at least 70% of measurements between 
week 12 and week 24, and  
− no single albumin measurement of <2.5 g/dL between week 12 and week 24, and  
− no requirement for albumin infusion between week 12 and week  24 
• Improvement in the following  clinical outcomes that were evaluable for improvement 
at baseline, with no worsening of the others (ie, those not evaluable for improvement) 
at week  24: 
− The number of bowel movements per day, based on a 1 -week average, captured by 
e-diary. Improvement is defined as a reduction of 50% or more in the number of 
daily bowel movements based on a 1 -week average. Patients evaluable for 
improvement are defined as those with an average of 3 or more bowel movements 
per day at baseline. Worsening is defined as an inc rease of 30% or more.  
− Physician assessment of facial edema (based on a 5 -point Likert scale). 
Improvement is defined as a reduction of 2 points or more. Patients evaluable for 
improvement are defined as those with a severity of at least 3 points out of 5 a t 
baseline. Worsening is defined as an increase of 2 points or more.  
− Physician assessment of peripheral edema (based on a 5 -point Likert scale). 
Improvement is defined as a reduction of 2 points or more. Patients evaluable for 
improvement are defined as those with a severity of at least 3 points out of 5 at 
baseline. Worsening is defined as an increase of 2 points or more.  
− Patient/caregiver assessment of abdominal pain frequency as assessed by the 
Stomach pain and hurt sub -scale of the PedsQL™ GI Symptom  Scale. 
Improvement is defined as an increase of 25 points or more (on the 0 to 
100 transformed total subscale score where lower scores indicate worse GI stomach 
pain and hurt). Patients evaluable for improvement are defined as those with a score 
of 70  points or less at baseline. Worsening is defined as a decrease of 25  points or 
more.

determined prior to baseline using a semi -structured concept elicitation interview, from 
amongst the ‘core’ clinical endpoints of frequency of bowel movements, peripheral 
edema, facial e dema, abdominal pain frequency (as described in Section  5.1), nausea, 
vomiting, and stool consistency:

(BITSS), the images and descriptors for categories 4 or 5 on the modified Bristol 
Stool Form Scale for Children ( mBSF S-C), and the images and descriptors for 
categories 6 or 7 of the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) . To be evaluable for 
improvement in stool consistency, patients must have a bowel movement of 
loose/watery stool consistency for ≥2 days/week at baseline

CONFIDENTIAL  6. STUDY DESIGN  
6.1. Study Description and Duration  
R3918 -PLE-1878 is an open -label, single -arm, 144 -week treatment study in patients aged 1  year 
and older with active clinical sign s and symptoms of CD55 -deficient PLE/CHAPLE disease, and 
a CD55 loss -of-function mutation detected by genotype analysis (frameshift, nonsense mutations). 
In the case of missense or suspected splice site mutations, CD55 -deficient PLE is to be confirmed 
by flow cytometry of peripheral blood cells. The first 2 patients enrolled will be of age 6 or older 
(exception will be made for patients under 6 years of age with life -threatening disease, see 
Section  3.2.1 ). 
A minimum of 6 patients with active PLE will be enrolled, up to approximately 20  patients. The 
primary analysis will occur when approximately 6 patients with active PLE have received 
24 weeks of treat ment. Subsequent analyses will occur 1 and 2 years after the first dose in the last 
patient enrolled.  
Patients will be given a single loading dose of pozelimab 30 mg/kg IV on day 1, then fixed doses 
SC (based on body weight) QW (±2 days) over the treatment  period (Section  3.2.2 ).  
The study consists of a screening period (up to 4 weeks [or up to 10  weeks for patients with 
extenuating circumstances, Sectio n 9.2.1 ]) followed by a  144-week treatment period (from week  0 
to week 144, with last dose at week 143), and a follow -up period (from week  145 to week  164;  
Figure  1).  
Active PLE is defined as hypoalbuminemia of less than or equal to 3.2 g/dL within the screening 
period, and within the last 6 months, at  least 7  days (which do not have to be consecutive) of one 
or more of the following symptoms or signs: diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, peripheral or 
facial edema, or an episode of infection with concomitant hypogammaglobulinemia, or a new 
thrombotic ev ent. Active patients should not be on current therapy with eculizumab.  
As part of risk mitigation for this study, patients should receive updated meningococcal, 
Haemophilus influenzae type B, and pneumococcal vaccinations (Section  8.3.1 ) and are 
recommended to receive daily oral antibiotic prophylaxis (Section  8.3.2 ) as well as counselling 
regarding risk of Neisseria gonorrhea  (Section  8.4), as applicable. Subsequent to the first 
2 patients, in addition to the active patient population heretofore described, patients who are well -
controlled on eculizumab may consider switching to pozelimab to avoid IV infusion. Patients 
switching to pozelimab from eculizumab will be switched with no wash -out, due to the risk of 
thrombosis with a return to active disease. In this case, eculizumab should be discontinued at the 
baseline visit, which s hould be scheduled within the window for the next eculizumab dose. 
Pozelimab should be started at the time that the next scheduled eculizumab dose would have taken 
place (the dosing interval for eculizumab is typically 2 weeks). The first pozelimab dose wi ll be 
administered instead of eculizumab. Due to a theoretical risk of formation of higher order 
complexes of pozelimab/C5/eculizumab in these patients in the initial weeks of active treatment, 
the protocol contains guidance for investigators to create awa reness of the symptoms and signs of 
type III hypersensitivity reactions and provides for clinical management of such reactions 
(Section  8.5).

1. Screening period may be extended to approximately 10 weeks for patients with extenuating circumstances, 
as described in Section  9.2.1 . 
2. Patients will receive an IV loading dose of pozelimab on week 0/day 1 and then receive SC pozelimab 
weekly until week 143 for a total treatment duration of 144 weeks.  
After the first administration of pozelimab at the study  site, subsequent administrations may either 
be continued at the clinical site, or by the site personnel or another healthcare professional at 
patient’s home (if possible) or local clinic, or self -administered/administered by the patient or 
designated pers on, respectively.  
6.1.1.  Study Stopping Rules  
6.1.1.1.  Individual Patient Stopping Rules  
If a patient experiences 1 SAE, or 2 AEs of severe intensity (in either case possibly or definitely 
attributable to pozelimab) (Section  10.2.5 ), or 1 of the reasons for discontinuation outlined in 
Section  8.6.2 , a meeting of the Steering Committee (Section  6.3.1 ) will take place to review the 
event and make recommendations as to whether the patient may continue treatment.  
6.1.1.2.  Study Stopping Criteria  
Decisions to discontinue or suspend the study will be made by the Steering Committee 
(Section  6.3.1 ).  
Enrollment of new patients will be paused should the following occur:  
• Two or more patients experience 1 or more SAEs judged to be possibly or definitely 
attributable to pozelimab  
Following the review o f all available safety data by the Steering Committee, a consensus opinion 
that the totality of the data suggests that this event is unlikely to be related to pozelimab will lead 
to resumption of study enrollment. Conversely, an unfavorable benefit -risk as sessment will lead 
to a recommendation to terminate the study. Any recommendation to terminate the study made by 
the Steering Committee must be approved by the Regeneron Safety Oversight Committee (RSOC), 
which includes senior clinical, regulatory, and pha rmacovigilance leaders at Regeneron . 
6.1.2.  End of Study Definition  
The end of study is defined as the last visit of the last patient.

6.3. Study  Committees  
6.3.1.  Steering Committee  
There will be a Steering Committee comprised of key investigators and individuals representing 
the sponsor (including representatives from clinical, safety, and statistics) who will meet regularly 
to review available data thr oughout the study, and ad hoc triggered by individual or study stopping 
rules. Impartial input will be provided by committee members who are not directly involved in the 
conduct of the study, including at least 1 physician experienced in treating patients with PLE and 
at least 1  member experienced in pediatric rare diseases and/or pediatric ethics. If 1 individual is 
identified with both these areas of expertise, there will be only 1 additional member. The Steering 
Committee may recommend to continue, disco ntinue, suspend, or alter the study on the basis of 
accumulating efficacy and safety information.  
The composition and meeting schedule for this committee will be described further in a charter.

PATIENTS  
7.1. Number of  Patients Planned  
A minimum of 6  patients with active PLE will be enrolled, up to approximately 20  patients. 
Eligible patients with inactive disease may also be enrolled, but their data will not contribute to 
the primary analysis.  
Selected sites are those  in Turkey, Israel, and the USA that have diagnosed and provided care for 
these patients. Other countries (including those in the EU) may be added depending on patient 
availability, without amending this protocol. Patients may attend some visits at a site in a country 
other than their country of residence on a case -by-case basis.

CONFIDENTIAL  c. Bilateral tubal ligation  
d. Vasectomized partner  
e. And/or sexual abstinence †, ‡. 
* Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months in order not to 
be considered of childbearing potential. Pregnancy testing and contraception are 
not required for women with documented hysterectomy or tubal ligation.  
† Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexua l intercourse during the entire period of risk associated 
with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated 
in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the patient.  
‡ Period ic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), 
withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea 
method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and 
male condom should not be used toget her.

assessment, and the use of tuberculin skin test or T -cell interferon -gamma release assay.  
7.3. Premature Withdrawal from the Study  
A patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, and without 
reper cussion.  
The investigator and/or sponsor have the right to withdraw a patient from the study if it is no longer 
in the interest of the patient to continue in the study, or if the patient’s continuation in the study 
places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a patient does not or cannot follow study 
procedures). An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; therefore, 
unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided.  
Patients who are withdrawn prematurely fr om the study will be asked to complete study 
assessments, as described in Section  9.1.2 . 
Rules for discontinuation of study treatment (permanent or t emporary) are discussed in 
Section  8.6.2 . 
7.4. Replacement of Patients

CONFIDENTIAL  8. STUDY TREATMENTS  
8.1. Investigational Treatment  
Pozelimab drug product will be provided in a sterile, single -use glass vial for either IV or SC 
administration and will be supplied by the sponsor.  
Pozelimab drug product will be initially provided in lyophilized form in a sterile, single use glass 
vial for IV or SC administration that requires reconstitution with sterile water for injection, and 
then transitioned to a sterile, single -use glass vial or pre -filled syringe containing a liquid 
200 mg/mL pozelimab formulation for IV or S C administration that will not require reconstitution. 
The compositions of the lyophilized and liquid formulations differ, mainly as a result of the 
inclusion of a viscosity reducer in the high concentration liquid formulation.  
Study drug will be supplied by the sponsor. The admixture solutions needed for delivery of the 
lyophilized or liquid drug product for IV administration will be sourced locally, or may be supplied 
by the sponsor, as necessary. Detailed information about the drug product and dose prepa ration is 
provided in the pharmacy manual. Detailed information about the drug product and dose 
preparation is provided in the pharmacy manual.  
8.2. Drug Administration  
Patients will be given a single loading dose of pozelimab 30 mg/kg IV on day 1, then SC dosi ng 
QW (±2 days) over the treatment period based on body weight. The last dose of study drug is 
administered at week  143. 
Dose regimen:  
• For BW <  10 kg: 125 mg.  
• For BW ≥10 kg and <  20 kg: 200 mg.  
• For BW ≥20 kg and <  40 kg: 350 mg.  
• For BW ≥40 kg and <  60 kg: 500 mg.  
• For BW ≥60 kg: 800 mg.  
The location and administration options for SC route of administration will depend on the 
preference of the investigator and patient (eg, abdomen, thigh, or upper arm), the availability of 
clinical supply, and home healthcare  visiting professional. Clinic visits for SC administration may 
or may not be needed.  
If self -administration/administration by patient/designated person is allowed locally, then 
sufficient injection training at the scheduled injection with pozelimab will b e provided. After 
training, observation of self -administration/administration by patient/designated person will be 
conducted by clinical site personnel or visiting healthcare professional. Once this observation is 
considered satisfactory, then the study dr ug can be subsequently administered independently by 
patient/designated person for the remainder of the study.

CONFIDENTIAL  In addition, a patient diary will be provided prior to initiation of self -administration (ie, day  29). 
The diary should be completed upon each st udy drug administration. A study drug kit will be 
dispensed at the clinical site visit, using a direct -to-patient (DTP) service provider, or transported 
by a healthcare professional, as applicable.  
Detailed information about the study drug administration i s provided in the pharmacy manual.  
8.3. Pretreatments  
Enrolled patients will require evidence of meningococcal immunization or administration of 
vaccination during the screening period, and oral antibiotics are recommended during the treatment 
period, according  to local or national practice and investigator’s assessment.  
8.3.1.  Vaccinations  
Enrolled patients will require immunization with meningococcal vaccinations. Administration of 
vaccination should occur preferably at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of pozelimab,  or at another 
time point according to local practice or national guidelines. It is suggested that patients undergo 
vaccination for serotypes A, C, Y, W, and, if available, serotype B. Patients who have had previous, 
documented vaccination for meningococcu s will be re -immunized based on local practice. Patients 
should be closely monitored for early signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection and 
evaluated immediately if an infection is suspected. Patients will be provided with a patient safety 
card descri bing signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection, along with instructions in case 
of a potential meningococcal infection, as well as information for the non -investigator healthcare 
provider.  
In addition, patients are also required to have evidence of Ha emophilus influenzae and 
pneumococcal immunizations, unless the patient has a medical contraindication. If adequate 
documentation of prior administration is not available or if the patient is not up -to-date with the 
recommended administration,  the vaccines will be administered prior to the initiation of treatment 
with the study drug, according to local practice, guidelines, and availability.  
The vaccinations will be sourced locally by the investigator or designee and reimbursed by the 
sponsor.  
8.3.2.  Oral Antibiotics  
Daily, oral antibiotic prophylaxis may commence on the day of first dosing, unless the risks 
outweigh the benefits, or it is inconsistent with local practice, and continue for the duration of the 
study. It is recommended that patients who prematurely discontinue pozelimab receive at least 
21 weeks of oral antibiotic prophylaxis after discontinuing pozelimab, or a duration consistent with 
local guidelines, whichever is longer (Section  9.1.2 ). For adults, it is suggested that antibiotic 
prophylaxis be penicillin V 500 mg twice a day (BID), and in the case of penicillin allergy, 
erythromycin 500 mg BID may be used at the discretion of the  investigator. For pediatric patients, 
it is suggested that antibiotic prophylaxis be penicillin VK 125 mg orally BID in patients who are 
< 5 years of age, and 250 mg BID if ≥  5 years of age. If pediatric patients are penicillin -allergic, 
then erythromycin  125 mg orally BID in patients who are <  3 years of age and 250 mg orally BID 
in patients who are ≥  3 years of age. Ultimately, the decision to administer prophylaxis with oral 
antibiotics, the duration of prophylaxis, the choice and dosage regimen of oral  antibiotics will be

CONFIDENTIAL  at the discretion of the investigator. The oral antibiotics will be sourced locally by the investigator 
or designee and reimbursed by the sponsor.  
8.4. Risk Management of Neisseria Gonorrhea  
Patients should be counseled about Neisseria gono rrhea  prevention and regular testing should be 
advised for at -risk patients, as applicable.  
A risk factor assessment should be based on local practice or national guidelines. The investigator 
should make his/her own assessment of risk (and if needed, consu ltation with other healthcare 
provider) to determine if the patient is at risk, which would lead to further management on 
prevention, testing, and treatment of Neisseria gonorrhea . 
Testing and treatment should be in accordance with local practice/national guidelines.  
General preventive measures include abstinence and use of a condom. Additional preventive 
measures should be considered based on local practice or national guidelines.  
8.5. Risk Management of Immune Complex Formation  
During the transition of therapy  from eculizumab to pozelimab, investigators should have 
heightened awareness for possible immune AEs as a result of the risk of drug -target -drug immune 
complex formations of eculizumab -C5-pozelimab. Patients may present with a variety of signs and 
symptom s such as fever, malaise, rash, and polyarthralgia. Less common manifestations include 
edema, neuropathy, GI complaints, nephropathy (including systemic hypertension), and vasculitis. 
If a rash does develop, the site may consider taking pictures of the ski n lesions, as allowed based 
on local requirements. If photos are obtained, then copies should be kept as source documents, 
which may later be collected by the Sponsor. Laboratory tests should include an unscheduled CBC, 
ESR, CRP, chemistry, C3, C4, and uri nalysis. Hematuria of ++ or more on urinalysis should be 
followed up with urine microscopy for red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) 
quantification. Proteinuria of ++ or more should be followed up with a protein:creatinine ratio 
from a spot urine  sample. Further investigations are at the discretion of the investigator. 
Investigators should consider treatment with an additional dose of SC pozelimab. This dose should 
be in accordance with the tiered, weight -based regimen and be administered 3 to 4 d ays prior to 
the next scheduled dose. This additional dose will establish conditions of pozelimab excess in the 
circulation and minimize the risk of further formation of immune complexes. In addition, further 
management should be based on clinical experien ce with type III hypersensitivity reactions (ie, 
serum sickness) which include antihistamines, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, topical 
corticosteroids for localized skin rash, and systemic corticosteroids for generalized skin rash, 
internal organs, or systemic manifestations.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.6. Dose Modification and Study Treatment Discontinuation Rules  
8.6.1.  Dose Modification  
Dose regimen modification/reduction is not allowed for an individual patient.  
• Patients will increase dose as specified by the dose regimen in the eve nt that they move 
into a higher BW bracket. For the purposes of these dose increases, body weight will 
be measured at the study visits as specified in the schedule of assessments ( Table  1) 
and not at each weekly administration. Pozelimab will be supplied initially in vials as 
lyophilized powder for reconstitution, so a single presentation will support all the 
weight -based dosing regimen The correct number of  vials and volume for SC injection 
drawn up will be administered by a healthcare practitioner (not necessarily a doctor) at 
the study site, during a visit, or at a local primary healthcare clinic in between visits or 
at home; self -administration/administra tion by patient/designated person may also be 
allowed (Section  8.2). Each SC dose may be administered by more than one injection 
if necessary; each inje ction should not exceed a 2 mL volume. Further details will be 
described in the Pharmacy Manual.  
8.6.2.  Study Drug Discontinuation  
Patients  who permanently discontinue from study drug and who do not withdraw from the study  
will be asked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits per the visit schedule.  
Patients  who permanently discontinue from study drug and who opt to withdraw from the study 
may be asked to complete study assessments, per Section  9.1.2 . 
8.6.2.1.  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug dosing will be permanently stopped in the event of:  
• Serious or severe allergic reactions cons idered related to study drug  
• Liver impairment as evidenced by one or more of the following criteria occurring 
without evidence of another etiology:  
− Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >  8 x ULN 
or 
− ALT or AST >  5 x ULN for mo re than 2 weeks or  
− ALT or AST >  3 x ULN and total bilirubin >  2 x ULN (or international normalized 
ratio [INR] >  1.5) and no other reason can be found to explain the combination of 
increased AST/ALT and total bilirubin, such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; 
preexisting or acute liver disease; or another drug capable of causing the observed 
injury  
• Patient withdraws consent

CONFIDENTIAL  • Patient noncompliance (eg, not complying with protocol -required visits, assessments, 
and/or dosing instructions)  
• Investigator’s clinical ju dgment that it is in the best interest of the patient  
Note: Evidence of pregnancy is not considered an automatic reason for permanent discontinuation 
and should be discussed with the medical monitor. Pregnancy may be a reason for permanent 
discontinuation if the benefit -risk assessment of continuing treatment with pozelimab is deemed 
unfavorable.  
8.6.2.2.  Reasons for Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Temporary discontinuation may be considered by the investigator because of suspected AEs. The 
investigator can reinitiate treatment with study drug under close and appropriate clinical and/or 
laboratory monitoring once the investigator will have considered, according to his/her best medical 
judgment, that the responsibility of the study drug in the occurrence of th e concerned event was 
unlikely.  
8.7. Management of Acute Reactions  
8.7.1.  Acute Intravenous Infusion Reactions  
Patients should be observed for 30 minutes after the infusion.  
Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of infusion reactions must be available f or 
immediate use. All infusion reactions must be reported as AEs (as defined in Section  10.2.4 ) and 
graded using the grading scales as instructed in  Section  10.2.5 . 
8.7.1.1.  Interruption of the Intravenous Infusion  
The infusion should be interrupted if any of the following AEs are observed:  
• Cough  
• Rigors/chill s 
• Rash, pruritus (itching)  
• Urticaria (hives, welts, wheals)  
• Diaphoresis (sweating)  
• Hypotension  
• Dyspnea (shortness of breath)  
• Vomiting  
• Flushing  
The reaction(s) should be treated symptomatically, and the infusion may be restarted at 50% of the 
original rate.

CONFIDENTIAL  If investigators feel there is a medical need for treatment or discontinuation of the infusion other 
than described above, they should use clinical judgment to provide the appropriate response 
according to typical clinical practice.  
8.7.1.2.  Termination of the Int ravenous Infusion  
The infusion should be terminated and NOT restarted if any of the following AEs occur:  
• Anaphylaxis*  
• Laryngeal/pharyngeal edema  
• Severe bronchospasm  
• Chest pain  
• Seizure  
• Severe hypotension  
• Other neurological symptoms (confusion, loss of consc iousness, paresthesia, 
paralysis, etc.)  
• Any other symptom or sign that, in the opinion of the investigator, warrants 
termination of the IV infusion  
*Consider anaphylaxis if the following is observed (Sampson, 2006 ): acute onset  of an illness 
(minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized 
hives, pruritus or ﬂushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula) AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE 
FOLLOWING:  
• Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze -bronchos pasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expiratory flow, hypoxemia)  
• Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia 
[collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
8.7.2.  Acute Injection Reactions  
8.7.2.1.  Systemic Injection Reactions  
Patients should be observed for 30 m inutes after the first SC injection.  
Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of systemic reactions must be available 
for immediate use. All injection reactions must be reported as AEs (as defined in Section  10.2.1 ) 
and graded using the grading scales as instructed in Section  10.2.5 . 
Acute systemic reactions following  SC injection of study drug should be treated using clinical 
judgment to determine the appropriate response according to typical clinical practice.

CONFIDENTIAL  9. STUDY SCHEDULE OF EV ENTS AND PROCEDURES  
9.1. Schedule of Events  
Study assessment and procedures are presented by study period and visit in Table  1. 
In light of the public health emergency related to COVID -19, the continuity of clinical study 
conduct and oversight may require implementation of temporary or alternative mechanisms.  
Examples of such mechanisms may include, but are not limited to, any of the following:  phone 
contact, virtual visits, telemedicine visits, online meetings, non -invasive remote monitoring

 CONFIDENTIAL  19. Total protein and albumin are tested in this panel (see blood chemistry panel in 
Section  9.2.4.4  Laboratory Testing). Testing will use either adult or small -volume pediatric 
kits as specified in a manual or kit instruction. If patient receives IV albumin infusion, this 
panel should be drawn either prior to the infusion or 2 weeks after the infusion.  
20. See Micronutrients Panel and Lipids Panel in Section  9.2.4.4  Laboratory Testing.  
21. See Blood Immunoglobulin Panel in  Section  9.2.4.4  Laboratory Testing.  
22. A pregnancy test is mandatory at screening and baseline for all women of childbearing 
potential (as defined in exclusion criter ion # 20). According to local practice in the study 
country, pregnancy testing (serum or urine) after enrollment is mandatory for all females 
from the age of sexual maturity, or for married females and, at the discretion of the 
investigator, for non -married females from the age of sexual maturity.  
23. Intensity of blood sampling for these analytes will be reduced if necessary to comply with 
local body weight -specific limitations on blood withdrawal volume. The blood draw 
schedule in Table  1 is designed for patients with body weight equal or greater than 20 kg. 
It is expected that patients below 20 kg in weight will require reduction in blood -draw 
intensity. A separate blood draw s chedule will be provided for patients with body weight 
between 10 kg and 20 kg in the sample handling manual. For patients with body weight 
less than 10 kg, an order of priority of blood draws will be provided in the sample handling 
manual or kit instructi on, and samples should be drawn in this order until the volume limit 
is reached. The chemistry panel will have highest priority followed by full blood count and 
drug concentration.

25. Sample sho uld be collected at baseline visit but may be collected at any time.  
26. Kits may be provided locally so that the chemistry panel may be taken locally to the 
patient without needing a site visit.  
27. Drug concentration and ADA samples are to be collected prior to study drug 
administration. In the event of any SAE or any AESI of anaphylactic reactions or systemic 
allergic reactions that are related to study drug and require treatment, or severe injection 
site reaction lasting longer than 24 hours, drug concentration  and ADA samples will be 
collected at or near the onset of the event for any additional analysis.  
28. In the event a patient sample is positive in the pozelimab ADA assay at week 12 or the first 
time point analyzed, the week 4 PK sample may be analyzed in the  ADA assay, provided 
there is sufficient volume.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.1.2.  Early Termination Visit  
Patients who discontinue treatment and do not withdraw from study should continue all study visits 
as scheduled. If the week 164 visit does not include at least 21 weeks of follow -up, then patie nt 
should continue with site visits until 21 weeks after last dose of study drug.  
Patients who discontinue treatment and study should be requested to have an early termination 
visit consisting of assessments listed for end of treatment visit ( Table  1). If the patient agrees to a 
follow -up safety phone visit, then a follow -up phone call will be scheduled for 21 weeks after last 
dose of study drug.  
Patients who  discontinue study treatment after completing the treatment period should have a 
follow -up visit 21 weeks after last dose of study drug. This visit will consist of the safety 
assessments including laboratory tests (Section  9.2.4.4 ) listed for the week  144 visit in Table  1. 
Patients who are withdrawn from the study before the primary endpoint visit (week 24) will be 
asked to return to the clinic for 2 visits: once for an early termination visit consisting of the end of 
study assessments described in Table  1, and again at the primary endpoint visit (week 24, 
day 169/visit 17). Patients who are withdrawn from the study after the primary endpoint visit will 
be asked to return to the clinic for early termination assessments, only.  
In all instances, every attempt will be made to conduct a safety follow -up at 21  weeks after the last 
dose of study drug.  
9.1.3.  Unscheduled Visits  
All attempts should be made to keep patients on the study schedule. Unscheduled visits may be 
necessary to repeat testing following abnormal laboratory results, for follow -up of AEs, or for any 
other reason, as warranted.  
9.2. Study Procedures  
9.2.1.  Procedures Performed Only at the Screening/Baseline Visit  
The following procedures will be performed for the sole purpose of determining study eligibility 
or characterizing the baseline population:  
• Medical history, including demonstration of CD55 gene loss of function (and absence 
of CD55 protein, if necessary) and collection of all available genetic sequencing data. 
All available genetic sequencing data and flow cytometry data are to be collected in its 
entirety. If at the time of screening, the patient does not have documentation of what 
mutation he/she carries  or it cannot be retrieved, then the study site staff should collect 
a blood sample for genetic testing by the investigator to determine the mutation type 
prior to randomization. This testing will be performed on an as needed basis.  
• History of albumin inf usions and prior thromboembolic events since birth  
• Demographics  
• Prior medications including eculizumab  
• Hospitalizations including dates, since birth if available

 CONFIDENTIAL  • Historical laboratory parameters, including albumin, total protein, and total 
immunoglobulins,  since birth if available  
• Vaccination history  
• Risk assessment for Neisseria gonorrhea , as applicable. See Section  8.4  
• Tuberculosis history and asses sment. Screening by tuberculin skin test or T -cell 
interferon -gamma release assay may be performed according to local practice or 
guidelines at the discretion of the investigator  
• Optional hepatitis B/C testing may be performed at the discretion of the inve stigator 
and may include: HBsAg, HBeAg, hepatitis B virus DNA, or HCV RNA  
• ECG as described in Section  9.2.4.3   
• Concept elicitation interview as described in Section  9.2.3.3  
For screening purposes, multiple retest of laboratory testing is permitted for non -clinically 
significant abnormality. Addi tionally, patients who are appropriately treated for an intercurrent 
illness (eg, after a successful resolution of an infection) may be rescreened.  
The screening period may be extended to approximately 10  weeks for patients who meet any of 
the following c riteria:  
• Patient requires additional time to complete meningococcal vaccinations  
• Patient must physically relocate to the vicinity of a study center  
• Patient is pending his/her screening laboratory results (Note: Samples for screening 
must be collected with in 6 weeks of baseline)  
• Patient has another requirement, which will be evaluated on a case by case basis after 
a discussion between the sponsor and investigator  
9.2.2.  Study Drug Administration  
Study drug will be administered as described in Section  8.2. Immunization with meningococcal, 
Haemophilus influenzae , and pneumococcal vaccines are to be performed according to local 
practice (Section  8.3.1 ). Daily oral antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended (Section  8.3.2 ). 
Compliance with study drug administration may be monitored with a patient diary according to 
Table  1. 
9.2.3.  Efficacy Procedures  
9.2.3.1.  Serum Albumin, Total  Protein, and Immunoglobulin  
Samples will be collected at visits according to Table  1, and tested in the blood chemistry or 
immunoglobin panel (see Section  9.2.4.4 ) at a central lab.  
9.2.3.2.  Physician Assessment of Edema and Ascites  
Physicians will assess peripheral edema as follows*: Following a general inspection and palpation 
of all 4 limbs, the investigator will rate the overall severity of peripheral edema, taking into account

 CONFIDENTIAL  both degree and distribution, on a 5 -point rating scale : 1) no edema; 2) mild edema: slight pitting, 
no visible change in the shape of the extremity; 3) moderate edema: definite pitting, slight change 
in the shape of the extremity; 4) severe edema: deep pitting, swollen extremity; and 5) very severe 
edema: very deep pitting, very swollen, distorted extremity.  
Physicians will ass ess facial edema as follows*: Following a general inspection of the face, the 
investigator will rate the overall severity of facial edema, taking into account both degree and 
distribution, on a 5 -point rating scale: 1) no edema, 2) mild edema, slight puffi ness around the eyes 
with some flattening of superficial creases, 3) moderate edema, definite periorbital swelling with 
some flattening of deep creases with or without puffiness of the cheeks, 4) severe edema, marked 
periorbital swelling with loss of deep periorbital creases and definite swelling of the cheeks, 
5) very severe edema, marked swelling of the entire face, eyes can only open to slit -like apertures.   
Ascites severity will be assessed by measurement of abdominal circumference, as follows*:  
1. Palpate  for the lower rib margin (costal margin) and mark with a short horizontal line.  
2. Palpate for the iliac crest and mark with a short horizontal line.  
3. Using the tape measure, measure the mid -distance between the two horizontal lines and 
mark this with another  short horizontal line in the middle.  
4. Ask the patient to cross their arms across their chest so that you have access to the waist. 
Instruct them to stand relaxed and look straight ahead. Try to make sure that they don’t 
deliberately hold themselves in or o ut. 
5. Pass the tape around the waist, making sure it is level and that it is positioned at the mid -
distance mark on both sides.  
6. Make sure the tape is not pulled too tight. It should rest on the skin but not indent it.  
7. Make the measurement at the end of expir ation.  
8. Measure to the nearest 0.1 cm (1 mm).  
9. Make 3 measurements of waist circumference.  
10. Record all three measurements and the mean (average) by adding the values together and 
dividing by 3.  
* In case of abnormal findings, assessments of facial edema, peri pheral edema, and ascites should 
be accompanied by clinical photography. All physician assessments for a patient should be 
performed by the same investigator until at least week 24. In addition, for consistency, a single 
independent physician blinded to th e time point at which the photograph was taken will be 
performing an evaluation of the clinical photographs obtained.  
9.2.3.3.  Clinical Outcome Assessments  
Daily e -Diary  
The daily e -diary, developed specifically for this study, will capture frequency of bowel 
movem ents as well as stool consistency for each bowel movement. The e -diary will be completed 
by the patients themselves if 12 years of age and older, and by caregiver otherwise (with input 
from the patient). When the caregiver is not with their child, bowel mo vement data will be

responsible for entering the data on b owel movements in the e -diary.  
Modified Bristol Stool Form Scale  
Stool consistency for patients who have been toilet -trained and who are less than 18 years of age 
will be assessed using the mBSFS -C. The BSFS was developed as a clinical assessment of 
intestinal transit time in patients with diseases of the bowel (O'Donnell, 1990 ) and has been 
modified for use in children (Lane, 2011 ). The mBSFS -C categorizes the form of human feces into 
5 categories using drawings of different stool forms and consistencies: 1) separate hard lumps, like 
nuts; 2) sausage -shaped but lumpy; 3) like a sausage or snake, smo oth and soft; 4) fluffy pieces 
with ragged edges, a mushy stool; 5)  watery, no solid pieces. The patient or caregiver will be asked 
to select the picture that best corresponds to each bowel movement. The mBSFS -C has been 
demonstrated to be reliable and val id for use by children; 8 is the minimum age limit for use of 
this scale without descriptors being read (Lane, 2011 ).  
Bristol Stool Form Scale  
Stool consistency for patients who have been toilet -trained and are 1 8 years of age and older will 
be assessed using the BSFS. The BSFS was developed as a clinical assessment of intestinal transit 
time in patients with diseases of the bowel (O'Donnell, 1990 ). The BSFS categorizes the form of 
human feces into 7 categories using drawings of different stool forms and consistencies: 
1) separate hard  lumps; 2) lumpy and sausage -like; 3) like a sausage with cracks on the surface; 
4) like a smooth, soft sausage or snake; 5) soft blobs; 6)  fluffy, mushy stool; 7) entirely liquid. The 
patient or caregiver will be asked to select the picture that best corr esponds to each bowel 
movement. The BSFS is widely used to treat and study bowel disorders in clinical and research 
settings and has demonstrated validity and reliability (Blake, 2016 ). The BSFS is the measure 
recommended by t he Rome Foundation (Lacy, 2016 ) and is considered appropriate by the FDA to 
assess stool consistency in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (FDA, 2012 ). 
Brussels Infant and Toddler Stool Scale  
Stool consistency for patients who are not toilet -trained will be assessed using the BITSS. The 
BITSS was developed with input from physicians, nurses, and parents to specifically assess stool 
consistency in infants and young children who use diapers (Vandenplas, 2017 ). The instrument 
consists of 7 photographs of different stool forms and consistencies: 1) hard stools; 2) formed 
stools; 3) loose stools; and 4) watery stools. The caregiver will be asked to select th e picture that 
best corresponds to each bowel movement. BITSS is a reliable assessment of stool consistency for 
children in diapers and has good agreement with the BSFS.  
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ Generic Core Scales  
The PedsQL™ 4.0 Generic Core Scales is a measure assessing health -related quality of life 
(HRQoL) in children and adolescents. The PedsQL™ Generic Score Scales for patients ages 
2 years and above is a 23 -item measure that assesses physical functioning, emo tional functioning, 
social functioning, and school/work/studies functioning. Different forms of the PedsQL™ Generic 
Core Scales allow the instrument to be self -administered in older patients and allow for parent 
proxy report for younger patients. The items  for each of the forms for patients ages 2 to 18 years

 CONFIDENTIAL  are essentially identical, differing primarily in the use of developmentally appropriate language, 
or first - or third -person tense. The PedsQL™ Generic Core Scales for patients ages 13 to 
24 months is a 45-item measure assessing physical functioning, physical symptoms, emotional 
functioning, social functioning, and cognitive functioning from the perspective of the parent. The 
instructions for all PedsQL™ Generic Core Scales forms ask how much of a probl em each item 
has been over the past 7 days on a 5 -point response scale, ranging from never a problem (0) to 
almost always a problem (4). The measure will be a self -administered patient -reported outcome 
(PRO) for patients ages 12 years and older, using the child report (age 12 years), teen report (ages 
13 to 17 years), young adult report (ages 18 to 25 years), and adult report (>25 years) forms. For 
patients 1 to 11 years of age, it will be an observer reporter outcome (ObsRO) measure using 
different forms f or patients 8 to 11 years (parent report for children), 5 to 7 years (parent report for 
young children), >2 years to 4 years (parent report for toddlers), and 13 to 24 months (parent report 
for infants). Items are reverse -scored and linearly transformed to  a 0 to 100 scale so that higher 
scores indicate better HRQoL. The total scale score is computed as the sum of all the items over 
the number of items answered on individual scales. The PedsQL™ Generic Core Scales was 
developed using focus groups, cognitive  interviews, pre -testing, and field -testing measurement 
development protocols (Varni, 2001 ) (Varni, 1999 ) and has demonstrated validity, reliability, 
ability to detect change, and responsiveness (Desai, 2014 ) (Varni, 2003 ) (Varni,  2011 ) 
(Varni,  2002 ) (Varni, 2001 ). This measure has also been used to evaluat e HRQoL in patients with 
functional and organic gastrointestinal disorders, which tends to be lower compared to healthy 
controls (Kunz, 2010 ) (Varni, 2015a ). 
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales  
The PedsQL™ GI Symptoms Scales is a 74 -item measure assessing gastrointestinal disease -
specific HRQoL in children, adolescents, and adults. The PedsQL™ Gastrointestinal Symptoms 
Scales is a multidimensional instrument comprising of 14 individual scales which can be 
administered and scored individually. Only the following 4 scales (23 items) will be administered: 
stomach pain and hurt (6 items), food and drink limitations (6 items), nausea and vomiting 
(4 items), and diarrhea (7  items). The format, instructions , Likert response scale, and scoring 
method for the PedsQL™ Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales are identical to the PedsQL™ 4.0 
Generic Core Scales.  
As with the PedsQL™ Generic Core Scales, different forms of the PedsQL™ Gastrointestinal 
Symptoms Scales all ow the instrument to be self -administered in older patients and also allow for 
parent proxy report for younger patients. There is no PedsQL™ Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales 
form to assess gastrointestinal symptoms in patients younger than 2 years of age. The items for 
each of the forms for patients ages 2 to 25 years are essentially identical, differing primarily in the 
use of developmentally appropriate language, or first - or third -person tense. The instructions for 
all PedsQL™ Gastrointestinal Symptoms S cales forms ask how much of a problem each item has 
been over the past 7 days on a 5 -point response scale, ranging from never a problem (0) to almost 
always a problem (4). The PedsQL™ Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales will be a self -
administered, PRO measur e for patients age 12 years (child report), 13 to 18  years (teen report), 
and 18 years of age and older (young adult report). For patients 2 to 11  years of age, the PedsQL™ 
Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales will be an ObsRO measure using different forms for  patients 8 
to 11  years (parent report for children), 5 to 7 years (parent report for young children), and 2 to 
4 years (parent report for toddlers). Items are reverse -scored and linearly transformed to a 0 to

the literature, interviewing pediatric gastroenterologists with clinical experience in treating 
gastrointestinal disorders, and by conducting focus groups, concept elicitation, and cognitive 
debriefing (Varni, 2012 ). The PedsQL™ Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales has demonstrated 
validity and reliability  (Varni, 2014 ) (Varni, 2016 ). 
PedsQL™ Quality of Life Inventory - Family Impact Module  
The PedsQL™ Family Impact Module Scales is a 36 -item, self -administered PRO measure 
assessing the impact of pediatric acute and chronic health conditions on parents and the family. 
The measure wi ll be administered to parent and non -parent caregivers. Additional instructions for 
the caregiver to think of the person they care for rather than the child to which the questionnaire 
refers will be included for non -parent caregivers. The PedsQL™ Family Im pact Module assesses 
the parent’s physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, cognitive functioning, 
communication, and worry as well as family functioning in terms of ability to perform daily 
activities and maintain family relationshi ps. The instructions ask how much of a problem each 
item has been for the parent (for physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, 
cognitive functioning, communication, and worry) or the family (for daily activities and family 
relations hips) over the past 7 days, as a result of their child’s health, on a 5 -point response scale 
ranging from never a problem (0) to almost always a problem (4). Items are reverse -scored and 
linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale so that higher scores indica te less negative impact. The 
total scale score is computed as the sum of all the items over the number of items answered on 
individual scales. The measure was developed using focus groups, cognitive interviews, and pre -
testing measurement development proto cols, and informed by prior research and clinical 
experiences with children with chronic health conditions and their families (Varni,  2004 ). The 
PedsQL™ Quality of Life Inventory – Family Impact Module has demonst rated reliability and 
validity among families caring for a child with complex chronic health conditions such as severe 
cerebral palsy and birth defects (Varni, 2004 ).  
Patient/Caregiver Global Impression of Severity  
The PGIS/CareGIS items are self -administered PRO questions for patients ages 12 and above, and 
self-administered ObsRO questions for patients aged less than 12 years. The PGIS/CareGIS 
questions will be used to assess the patient’s current overall severity of disease and of specific 
symptoms from the perspective of the patient or caregiver.  
Patie nt/Caregiver Global Impression of Change  
The PGIC/CareGIC items are self -administered PRO questions for patients ages 12 and above, 
and self -administered ObsRO questions for patients aged less than 12 years. The PGIC/CareGIC 
questions will be used to asses s the change in overall severity of disease and in specific symptoms 
compared to the start of the study, from the perspective of the patient or caregiver.  
Clinical Global Impression of Severity  
The CGIS items are self -administered clinical -reported outcome  (ClinRO) questions assessing the 
patient’s overall disease activity or symptom severity from the perspective of the treating clinician.

study, the treating clinician will rate the change in the patient’s disease activity and symptom 
severity.  
Concept Elicitation Interview  
Eligible patients and, when appropriate, their caregivers will participate in a face -to-face concept 
elicitation interview at screening. C oncept elicitation is designed to identify/confirm, describe, and 
substantiate important and relevant concepts of interest from the perspective of patients and their 
caregivers. Patients and, when appropriate, their caregivers will be asked questions relat ed to their 
experience or their child’s experience with CD55 -deficient PLE in terms of the signs/symptoms 
of disease, how bothersome each sign/symptom is and which is the most bothersome, as well as 
the ways in which the disease has impacted his/her life. Each interview will last approximately 
60 minutes and will be conducted by a trained internal or external interviewer following a semi -
structured interview guide. Further details will be provided in a separate study manual.  
Exit Interview  
At the time poin t of the primary endpoint, patients and, when appropriate, their caregivers will be 
interviewed to more fully explore the experiences of trial patients on treatment. Patients and their 
caregivers, where appropriate, will be asked questions to better unders tand the change in 
signs/symptoms (including the sign/symptom identified as most bothersome during the concept 
elicitation interview), and impact on quality of life. Results from exit interviews will be used to 
contextualize findings on the clinical outcom e assessments (COAs) and other clinical endpoints. 
Each interview will last approximately 60 minutes and will be conducted by a trained internal or 
external interviewer following a semi -structured interview guide.  
9.2.3.4.  Tanner Stages  
The Tanner stages will be a ssessed throughout the study for patients between the ages of 8 and 
20 years, in whom pubertal development is not complete (in the assessment of the investigator at  
specified time points shown in  Table  1). If possible, for each adolescent patient, the Tanner stages 
assessment should be performed by the same investigator or designee trained to assess pubertal 
development.  
9.2.4.  Safety Procedures  
9.2.4.1.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including temperature, sitting blood pressure, and pulse will be collected predose at 
time points according to Table  1.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.2.4.2.  Phys ical Examination, Height, and Body Weight  
A thorough and complete physical examination will be performed at time points according to 
Table  1. Each physical examination will include an evaluation of head and neck, lungs, heart, 
abdomen, extremities, and skin. Care should be taken to examine and assess any abnormalities that 
may be present, as indicated by the patient’s medical history. Additionally, for patien ts switching 
from eculizumab, risk assessment of immune complex formation is described in Section  8.5. 
Height and body weight will be measured at time points according to Table  1. Body weight should 
be obtained with the patient wearing undergarments or very light clothing and no shoes (should be 
the same each time). A calibrated scale should be used.  
9.2.4.3.  Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed at time points according to 
Table  1.  
Twelve -lead ECGs will be systematically recorded after the patient has been in the supine position 
for at least 10 minutes.  
The ECG will be interpreted locally by the investigator and a consultation  with the sponsor may 
occur. Any new and/or clinically significant changes in ECG parameters should be immediately 
rechecked for confirmation before making any decision for the concerned patient. Any clinically 
significant abnormality should be documented as an AE/SAE as applicable.  
Heart rate will be recorded from the ventricular rate, and the PR/PQ, QRS, RR, QT intervals, and 
QTcF will be recorded. The ECG strips or reports will be retained with the source.  
9.2.4.4.  Laboratory Testing  
Samples for laboratory testin g will be collected at visits according to Table  1.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Abnormal Laboratory Values and Laboratory Adverse Events  
All laboratory values must be reviewed by the investigator or authorized designee.  
Significantly abnormal test results that occur after start of treatment must be repeated to confirm 
the nature and degree of the abnormality. When necessary, appropriate ancillary investigations 
should be initiated. If the abnormality fails to resolve or c annot be explained by events or 
conditions unrelated to the study medication or its administration, the Medical/Study Director must 
be consulted.  
The clinical significance of an abnormal test value, within the context of the disease under study, 
must be d etermined by the investigator.  
Criteria for reporting laboratory values as an AE are provided in Section  10.2.5 . 
9.2.5.  Drug Concentration and Measurements  
Samp les for drug concentration will be collected prior to drug administration at visits listed in 
Table  1. The exact sampling time must be recorded, as allowed  per local regulation.  
Any unused samples may be used for exploratory biomarker research.  
9.2.6.  Anti -Drug Antibody Measurements and Samples  
Blood samples for ADA assessment in serum will be collected prior to drug administration at visits 
listed in Table  1. Samples positive in the ADA assay may be stored and analyzed in the NAb assay 
at a later time once the NAb assay is available.  
Detailed instructions for blood  sample collection are included in the laboratory manual provided

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.2.7.1.  Future Biomedical Research (Optional)  
Patients who have a body weight >20  kg and agree to participate in the future biomedical research 
sub-study will be required to assent/consent to this optional sub -study before collection of the 
serum and plasma samples . The unused biomarker samples for study -related research, as well as 
unused PK and ADA samples, will be stored for up to 15 years after the final date of the database 
lock. The unused samples may be utilized for future biomedical research of pozelimab, th e 
complement pathway, PLE, and related diseases. Additional samples will be collected for future 
biomedical research according to the Schedule of Events in Table  1. After 15 years, any residual 
samples will be destroyed. The results of these future biomedical research analyses will not be 
presented in the clinical study report.  
9.2.7.2.  Genomics Sub -Study (Optional)  
Patients who agree to participate in the genomics s ub-study will be required to assent/consent to 
this optional sub -study before collection of the samples. This genomics sub -study will not be 
available in countries where a separate ethics committee (EC) approval is required for such studies, 
and where such  an approval is not in place.  
Buccal swab samples for DNA extraction should be collected on day 1 (predose) but can be 
collected at a later study visit.  
DNA samples will be collected for pharmacogenomics analyses. These samples will be single -
coded as defi ned by the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) guideline E15. Samples 
will be stored for up to 15 years after the final date of the database lock. If there are specific site 
or country requirements involving the pharmacogenomic analyses with which  the sponsor is 
unable to comply, samples will not be collected at those sites.  
The purpose of the pharmacogenomic analyses is to identify genomic associations with clinical 
(safety or efficacy) or biomarker response to pozelimab, the complement pathway, P LE, and 
related complement -mediated diseases, clinical outcome measures, and possible AEs. In addition, 
associations between genomic variants and prognosis or progression of PLE and related 
complement -mediated diseases may also be studied. These data may b e used or combined with 
data collected from other studies to identify and validate genomic markers related to the study 
drug, target pathway, or PLE and related diseases.  
Analyses may include sequence determination or single nucleotide polymorphism studies  of 
candidate genes and surrounding genomic regions. Other methods, including whole exome 
sequencing, whole genome sequencing, DNA copy number variation, transcriptome sequencing 
(or other methods for quantitating RNA expression), and methods for quantifyi ng epigenetic 
modifications may also be performed. The list of methods may be expanded to include novel 
methodology that may be developed during the course of this study or sample storage period.  
Results from the genomic analyses will not be reported in the CSR.

 CONFIDENTIAL  10. SAFETY EVALUATION AN D REPORTING  
10.1. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
10.1.1.  General Guidelines  
The investigator must promptly record all clinical events occurring during the study data collection 
period (see Section  10.1.2 ). Medical conditions that existed or were diagnosed prior to the signing 
of the Informed Consent will be recorded as part of medical history. Abn ormal laboratory values 
and vital signs observed at the time of Informed Consent should also be recorded as medical 
history. Any subsequent worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug 
should also be recorded as an AE.  
At each visit, the investigator will determine whether any AEs have occurred by evaluating the 
patient. Adverse events may be directly observed, reported spontaneously b y the patient, or by 
questioning the patient at each study visit. Patients should be questioned in a general way, without 
asking about the occurrence of any specific symptoms. The Investigator must assess all AEs to 
determine seriousness, severity, and cau sality, in accordance with the definitions in Section  10.2. 
The Investigator’s assessment must be clearly documented in the site’s source documentat ion with 
the Investigator’s signature. The Investigator should follow up on SAEs (and AESIs) until they 
have resolved or are considered clinically stable; AEs should be followed until they are resolved 
or last study visit, whichever comes first.  
Always rep ort the diagnosis as the AE or SAE term. When a diagnosis is unavailable, report the 
primary sign or symptom as the AE or SAE term with additional details included in the narrative 
until the diagnosis becomes available. If the signs and symptoms are distin ct and do not suggest a 
common diagnosis, report them as individual entries of AE or SAE.  
Laboratory results, vital signs, and other diagnostic result s or findings  should be appraised by the 
Investigator to determine their clinical significance.  Isolated abnormal laboratory results, vital sign 
findings, or other diagnostic findings (ie, not part of a reported diagnosis) should be reported as 
AEs if they are symptomatic, lead to study drug discontinuation,  dose reduction,  require corrective 
treatment, or constitute an AE in the investigator ’s clinical judgment . 
For events that are serious due to hospitalization, the reason for hospitalization must be reported 
as the serious adverse event (diagnosis or symptom requiring hospitalization). A procedure is not 
an AE or SAE, but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or SAE. Pre -planned (prior to 
signing the Informed Consent Form) procedure s, treatment s requiring hospitalization for 
pre-existing conditions that do not worsen in severity, and admission for pallia tive or social care 
should not be reported as SAEs (see Section  10.2 for Definitions).  
For deaths, the underlying or immediate cause of death shoul d always be reported as an SAE.  
Any SAE that may occur subsequent to the reporting period (end of the follow -up/post treatment 
period) that the Investigator assesses as related to study drug should also be reported.  
All AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs) , AESIs, and pregnancy reports are to be reported according 
to the procedures in Section  10.1.3 .

 CONFIDENTIAL  10.1.2.  Reporting Procedure  
All events (serious and non-serious) must be reported with investigator’s assessment of the event’s 
seriousness, severity, and causality to the study drug. For SAEs and AESIs, a detailed narrative 
summarizing the course of the event, including its evaluation, treatment, and outco me should be 
provided on the AE CRF. Specific or estimated dates of event onset, treatment, and resolution 
should be included, when available. Medical history, concomitant medications, and laboratory data 
that are relevant to the event should also be summa rized in the narrative. For fatal events, the 
narrative should state whether an autopsy was or will be performed, and include the results if 
available. Information not available at the time of the initial report must be documented in a follow -
up report. So urce documents  (including hospital or medical re cords, diagnostic reports, etc. ) will 
be summarized in the narrative on the AE CRF, and retained at the  study center and available upon 
request.  
Urgent safety queries must be followed up and addressed prompt ly. Follow -up information and 
response to non -urgent safety queries should be combined for reporting to provide the most 
complete data possible within each follow -up.  
10.1.3.  Events that Require Expedited Reporting to Sponsor  
The following events also require rep orting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning 
of the event:  
• SAEs . 
• Adverse Events of Special Interest  (AESI; serious and nonserious) : Adverse events 
of special interest for this study include the following:  
− Moderate or severe infusion rea ctions  
− Confirmed Neisseria  infection  
− Any thrombotic or embolic event  
• Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility 
of the investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), within 24  hours of 
identification, any pregnanc y occurring in a female  or female partner of a male, during 
the study or within 21 weeks of the last dose of study drug. Any complication of 
pregnancy affecting a female study patient or female partner of a male study patient, 
and/or fetus and/or newborn that meets the SAE criteria must be reported as an SAE. 
Outcome for all pregnancies should be reported to the sponsor. Also see 
Section  8.6.2.1 .

 CONFIDENTIAL  10.2. Definitions  
10.2.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study drug which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug. Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug (ICH 
E2A Guideline. Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for  Expedited 
Reporting, Oct 1994).  
10.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event. This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization . In-
patient hospitalization is defined as admission to a hospital or  an emergency room for 
longer than 24 hours. Prolongation of existing hospitalization is defined as a hospital 
stay that is longer than was originally anticipated for the event, or is prolonged due to 
the development of a new AE as determined by the invest igator or treating physician.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event - Important medical eve nts may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (eg, 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home  for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse).  
Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events.  
10.2.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An advers e event of special interest (AESI; serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical 
interest specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by the investigator to the sponsor can be appropriate. S uch an event might warrant 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand it. Depending on the nature of the 
event, rapid communication by the trial sponsor to other parties (eg, regulators) might also be 
warranted (Section  10.1.3 ).

 CONFIDENTIAL  10.2.4.  Infusion Reactions  
Infusion reactions are defined as any relevant AE that occurs during the infusion or within 2  hours 
(up to 24 hours) after the infusion is  completed.  
10.2.5.  Severity  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:  
Mild: Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient’s normal functioning level. It 
may be an annoyance. Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed fo r relief of symptoms, but may 
be given because of personality of the patient.  
Moderate:  Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health. It is 
uncomfortable or an embarrassment. Treatment for symptom may be needed.  
Severe:  Produces s ignificant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a definite hazard 
to the patient’s health. Treatment for symptom may be given and/or patient hospitalized.  
If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity should be based on the degree o f 
physiological impairment the value indicates.  
Infusion Reactions  
The severity of infusion reactions will be graded according to the following scale (semi -colon 
indicates “or” within description of the grade):  
Mild : Mild transient reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not indicated.  
Moderate : Therapy or infusion interruption indicated but responds promptly to symptomatic 
treatment (eg, antihistamines, NSAIDs, narcotics, IV fluids); prophylactic medications indicated 
for ≤24 hours . 
Severe : Prolonged (eg, not rapidly responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption 
of infusion); recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement; hospitalization indicated for 
clinical sequelae; life -threatening consequences; urgent i ntervention indicated; death.  
Injection Site Reactions  
The severity of injection site reactions will be graded according to the following scale (semi -colon 
indicates “or” within description of grade:  
Mild : Pain that does not interfere with activity; mild d iscomfort to touch; <5 cm of erythema or 
induration that does not interfere with activity  
Moderate : Pain that requires repeated use of non -narcotic pain reliever >24 hours or interferes 
with activity; discomfort with movement; 5.1 cm to 10 cm erythema or i nduration or induration 
that interferes with activity  
Severe : Pain that requires any use of narcotic pain reliever or that prevents daily activity; 
significant discomfort at rest; >10 cm erythema or induration; prevents daily activity; requires ER 
visit or  hospitalization; necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis

 CONFIDENTIAL  10.2.6.  Causality  
The investigator must provide causality assessment as whether or not there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event, based on evidence or facts, his/her clinical 
judgm ent, and the following definitions. The causality assessment must  be made based on the 
available information and can be updated as new information becomes available.  
The following factors should be considered when assessing causality:  
• Temporal relationship : time to onset vs time drug was administered  
• Nature of the reactions: immediate vs. long term  
• Clinical and pathological features of the events  
• Existing information about the drug & same class of drugs  
• Concomitant medications  
• Underlying and concurrent i llnesses  
• Response to dechallenge (drug discontinuation) or dose reduction  
• Response to rechallenge (re -introduction of the drug) or dose increase, when applicable  
• Patient’s medical and social history  
Causality to the study drug (including study drug adm inistration):  
• Related:  
− The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration, 
and cannot be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, patient’s clinical 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, concomitant medications ), or other 
external factors.  
or 
− The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration, 
and is a known reaction to the drug under study or its class of drugs, or is predicted 
by known pharmacology.  
• Not Related:  
− The AE does not follow  a reasonable sequence from study drug administration, or 
can be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, patient’s clinical state 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications) or 
other external factors.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Causality t o the study conduct (protocol specified procedure):  
• Related:  
− The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from a protocol specified 
procedure, and cannot be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, 
patient’s clinical (eg, disease under study, c oncurrent diseases, concomitant 
medications), or other external factors.  
• Not Related:  
− The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence from a protocol specified procedure, 
or can be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, patient’s clinical state 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications) or 
other external factors.  
10.3. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study patient at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consistent wi th current Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion. The sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites. The Medical/Study Director will have primary responsibility 
for the emerging safety profile of the compound, but will be supported by other departments (eg, 
Pharmacovigilance; Risk Management; Biostatistics and Data Management). Safety monitoring 
will be performed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on a periodic 
cumulative aggregate basis.  
10.4. Notifying Health Authorities, Institutional Review Board /Ethics 
Committee, and Investigators  
During the study, the sponsor and/or the CRO will inform health authorities, IECs/IRBs, and the 
participating invest igators of any SUSARs (Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions) 
occurring in other study centers or other studies of the active study drug (pozelimab), as 
appropriate per local reporting requirements. In addition, the sponsor and/or CRO will comply 
with any additional local safety reporting requirements.  
Upon receipt of the sponsor’s notification of a SUSAR that occurred with the study drug, the 
investigator will inform the IRB/EC unless delegated to the sponsor.  
Event expectedness for study drug (p ozelimab) is assessed against the Reference Safety 
Information section of the current Investigator’s Brochure.  
At the completion of the study, the sponsor will report all safety observations made during the 
conduct of the trial in the Clinical Study Report  to health authorities and IECs/IRB as appropriate.

 CONFIDENTIAL  11. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section provides the basis for the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study. The SAP may 
be revised during the study to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and  to make 
changes to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the planned 
analyses. The final SAP will be issued before the database is locked.  
Analysis variables are listed in Section  4. 
11.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
The primary objective of the study is to determine the effect of pozelimab on active CD55 -deficient 
PLE/CHAPLE disease in patients with active disease at baseline. The p rimary outcome at week  24 
is achievement of both of the following:  
• Normalization of serum albumin, defined as  
− serum albumin within the normal range at at least 70% of measurements between 
week 12 and week 24, and  
− no single albumin measurement of <2.5 g/dL between week 12 and week 24, and  
− no requirement for albumin infusion between week 12 and 24  
• Improvement at week 24 in clinical outcomes listed in Section  5.1 that were evaluable 
for improvement at baseline, with no worsening of the others.  
The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving the primary outcome.  
11.2. Justification of Sample Size  
The study is regarded as successful if at least 4 of 6  evaluable patients achieve the primary 
endpoint. Unpublished patient -level data of 14 patients treated with eculizumab (Kurolap,  2017 ) 
(Kurolap, 2019 ) (Ozen, 2017a ) were made available to the study sponsor (Ozen unpublished data, 
Baris -Feldman unpublished data) . In the historical control period before initiating eculizumab, 0 
of 14 patients met the primary end point (90% exact confidence interval (CI): [0.00, 0.19]). If 4 of 
6 patients treated with pozelimab achieve the primary endpoint, the 90% exact CI for the 
probability of achieving the primary endpoint is (0.27, 0.94), with the lower limit of 0.27 clearly 
greater than the upper limit of 0.19 for the historical control period of the 14  patients. By a 
Bayesian analysis, a comparison between 4 of 6 pozelimab -treated patients achieving the primary 
endpoint and 0 of 14 in the historical data by a Beta -Binomial an alysis with the Jefferys prior of 
Beta(0.5, 0.5) would conclude that there is a >99% posterior probability that pozelimab has a 
greater response rate than untreated patients. There would also be a 90% posterior probability that 
the response rate with pozel imab is at least 0.37 higher than that of untreated patients. Thus, the 
study success criterion of observing at least 4 of 6 evaluable patients achieving the primary 
endpoint provides strong evidence of effectiveness.

 CONFIDENTIAL  All of the 14 eculizumab -treated patie nts achieved a normalized serum albumin level by 12  weeks 
of treatment and required no albumin infusions subsequent to treatment initiation (90% exact CI: 
[0.81, 1.00])  (Kurolap, 2017 ) (Kurolap, 2019 ) (Ozen, 2017a ). If the true rate of achieving the 
primary endpoi nt for patients on pozelimab is 0.81 (the lower limit of the CI for eculizumab), then 
a sample size of 6 gives a probability of 91% for achieving the study success criterion.   
11.3. Analysis Sets

 CONFIDENTIAL  11.4. Statistical Methods  
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics will include the following information: the number 
of patients reflected in the calculation (n), mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and 
maximum.  
For categorical or ordinal data, f requencies and percentages will be displayed for each category.  
In addition to summary statistics, data will be plotted whenever needed.  
11.4.1.  Patient Disposition  
The following will be provided:  
• The total number of screened patients: met the inclusion criteria r egarding the target 
indication and signed the ICF  
• The total number of enrolled patients  
• The total number of patients in each analysis set (eg, provided in Section  11.3) 
• The total number of patients who discontinued the study, and the reasons for 
discontinuation  
• A listing of patients enrolled but not treated  
• A listing of patients  prematurely discontinued from treatment, along with reasons for 
discontinuation  
11.4.2.  Demography and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively.  
11.4.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
11.4.3.1.  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The subset of t he FAS with patients having active PLE at baseline will provide the data for the 
primary efficacy analysis. The percentage of patients achieving normalization of albumin and 
achieving improvement in the prespecified evaluable clinical outcomes listed in Se ction  5.1 will 
be calculated and its 90% CI will be reported.  
There are 7 planned albumin measurements between week 12 and week  24, inclusive. Patients will 
be considered non -evaluable for the primary analysis if there are fewer than 5  available albumin 
measurements between week 12 and week  24. Albumin measurements outside of the visit 
windows and/or carried out at local laboratories will be considered as  valid measurements. To be 
considered responders, at least 70% of available measurements must be normal (≥3.5  g/dL). Thus, 
patients with the minimum of 5 available measurements must have 4 out of 5  normal. Patients with 
the planned number of 7 measurements  must have at least 5 normal. Patients who have more than 
7 available measurements (due to unplanned albumin measurement in local labs) must have at least 
70% of all available measurements normal.  Non -responder imputation for patients with fewer 
than 5 av ailable albumin measurements between week 12 and week 24 will be carried out as a 
sensitivity analysis. The mean changes from baseline in albumin over time and the mean number

 CONFIDENTIAL  of albumin infusions per half -year will also be estimated. Patient profiles of a lbumin over time 
will be plotted.  
There are 4 clinical outcomes that can contribute to the clinical improvement component of the 
primary endpoint. Patients are evaluable for improvement in each of these based on activity at 
baseline, as defined in Section  5.1. Patients evaluable for only 1 of the 4 clinical outcomes must 
show improvement in that clinical outcome and no worsening in the other 3. Patients  evaluable for 
more than 1 clinical outcome must show improvement (as defined) for all of their evaluable 
outcomes and no worsening in any non -evaluable outcomes.  
For facial and peripheral edema, the primary analysis will be performed using the investigat ing 
physician’s report. Clinical photographs will be rated by a single, central reader blinded to the time 
point at which the photograph was taken. The correlation of central read to physician’s assessment 
will be described. The central read will be used a s a sensitivity analysis on the primary endpoint.  
For the primary endpoint, the definitions of baseline for the component variables are:  
• Albumin - The measurement at the baseline visit will be used  
• PedsQL GI Symptoms Scales’ Stomach Pain and Hurt Subscale - The baseline visit 
score will be used  
• Bowel movement frequency - The daily average from the e -diary from the last 7 days 
pre-baseline will be used  
• Facial edema - The baseline value will be used  
• Peripheral edema - The baseline value will be used  
11.4.3.2.  Secondary  Efficacy Analysis  
For the responder outcomes for maintenance of effect at week 48 and 144, there are 9 planned 
albumin measurements between week 12 and week  48 inclusive. Patients will be considered non -
evaluable for the secondary analysis if there are fe wer than 6 available albumin measurements 
between week 12 and week  48. Non -responder imputation for patients with fewer than 6 available 
albumin measurements between week 12 and week 48 will be carried out as a sensitivity analysis. 
There are 14 planned al bumin measurements between week 12 and week  144 inclusive. Patients 
will be considered non -evaluable for the secondary analysis if there are fewer than 10 available 
albumin measurements between week 12 and week  144. There are 3 planned albumin 
measurements  between week 24 and week  48 inclusive. Patients will be considered non -evaluable 
for this secondary analysis if there are fewer than 2 available albumin measurements between 
week  24 and week  48. There are 5 planned albumin measurements between week 48 and  week  96 
inclusive. Patients will be considered non -evaluable for this secondary analysis if there are fewer 
than 3 available albumin measurements between week 48 and week  96. There are 2 planned 
albumin measurements between week 96 and week  144 inclusive.  Patients will be considered non -
evaluable for this secondary analysis if there are fewer than 2 available albumin measurements 
between week 96 and week  144. Albumin measurements outside of the visit windows and/or 
carried out at local laboratories will be  considered as valid measurements. Non -responder 
imputation for patients with fewer than 10 available albumin measurements between week 12 and 
week 144 will be carried out as a sensitivity analysis. The mean changes from baseline in albumin

 CONFIDENTIAL  over time and t he mean number of albumin infusions per half -year will also be estimated. Patient 
profiles of albumin over time will be plotted.  
Prior to baseline, concept elicitation interviews will seek to identify each patient’s most 
bothersome sign/symptom from the ‘ core’ clinical manifestations. The identification of the most 
bothersome sign/symptom following the interview and its translation into English may take place 
after the baseline visit, by expert individuals with no access to post -baseline clinical data. For  
continuous secondary outcomes, including total protein, total Ig, and weight, patient profiles over 
time will be tabularly and graphically presented. Changes from baseline in the outcome measures 
over time will be summarized with mean, 90% CI, and other s ummary statistics.  
For count secondary outcomes, including number of bowel movements per day, frequency of 
albumin infusions and hospitalization days, counts by day or periods of time will be summarized.  
For categorical secondary outcomes, including AEs and physician assessment of disease inactivity, 
percentages of patients in categories will be summarized.  
For time -to-event secondary outcomes, including time to first normalization of serum albumin, 
survival analysis of data with censoring through time w ill be conducted.

 CONFIDENTIAL  11.4.6.  Analysis of Immunogenicity Data  
Anti-drug antibodies will be characterized by the type and level of the observed response. Samples 
positive in the ADA assay will be further characterized for NAbs and ADA titers.  
Anti-drug antibodies response categories and titer categories that will be assessed are as follows:  
• Preexisting immunoreactivity: defined as a positive ADA a ssay response at baseline 
with all ADA results negative after the first dose of study drug, or a positive assay 
response at baseline with all ADA assay responses less than 9 -fold over baseline titer 
levels after the first dose of study drug  
• Treatment -emerg ent response: defined as any positive ADA assay response after the 
first dose of study drug when the baseline results are negative or missing  
• Treatment -boosted response: defined as any positive ADA assay response after the first 
dose of study drug that is 9-fold over baseline titer levels when baseline is positive in 
the ADA assay  
Treatment -emergent ADA responses may be further characterized into persistent, transient and 
indeterminate responses.  
Titer value category (titer range):  
− Low (titer <1,000)  
− Moder ate (1,000 ≤ titer ≤10,000)  
− High (tier >10,000)  
Listings of pre -existing, treatment -boosted, and treatment -emergent ADA responses, ADA titers, 
and NAb positivity presented by patient and time point will be provided. Incidence of treatment -
emergent, persistent and NAb responses will be assessed as absolute occurrence (N) and percent 
of patients (%), grouped by ADA titer level.  
Plots of drug concentrations will be examined and the influence of ADA responses on individual 
PK profiles evaluated. Assessme nt of impact of ADA responses on safety and efficacy may be 
provided.

13.2.1.  Adult Pa tients  
The principles of informed consent are described in ICH guidelines for GCP.  
The ICF used by the investigator must be reviewed and approved by the sponsor prior to 
submission to the appropriate IRB/EC. A copy of the IRB/EC -approved ICF and documentat ion 
of approval must be provided to the sponsor before study drug will be shipped to the study site.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by local regulations) to obtain 
written informed consent from each patient prior to  his/her participation in the study and after the 
aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study have been explained to the patient in 
language that he/she can understand. The ICF should be signed and dated by the patient and by the 
investig ator or authorized designee who reviewed the ICF with the patient.  
• Patients who can write but cannot read will have the ICF read to them before signing 
and dating the ICF.  
• Patients who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have the ICF re ad 
to them in the presence of an impartial witness, who will sign and date the ICF to 
confirm that informed consent was given.  
The original ICF must be retained by the investigator as part of the patient’s study record, and a 
copy of the signed ICF must be  given to the patient.  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, the ICF must 
be reviewed and updated appropriately. All study patients must be informed of the new information 
and provide their written consent  if they wish to continue in the study. The original signed revised 
ICF must be maintained in the patient’s study record and a copy must be given to the patient.

submission to the appropriate IRB/EC. A copy of the IRB/EC -approved ICF and documentation 
of approval must be provided to the sponsor before study drug will be shipped to the study site.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by local regulations) to obtain 
written informed consent from each patient  and his/her parent(s) or legal guardian(s) prior to the 
patient’s participation in the study and after the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards 
of the study have been explained to the fullest possible extent in language that the patient and th e 
parent(s) or legal guardian(s) can understand. The ICF should be signed and dated by the patient’s 
parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and the same investigator or designee who explained the ICF.  
Local law must be observed in deciding whether 1 or both parent s’/guardians’ consent is required. 
If only 1 parent or guardian signs the consent form, the investigator must document the reason the 
other parent or guardian did not sign. The patient may also be required to sign and date the ICF, 
as determined by the IRB /EC and in accordance with the local regulations and requirements.  
• Patients who can write but cannot read will have the assent form read to them before 
writing their name on the form.  
• Patients  who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have the ICF read 
to them in the presence of an impartial witness, who will sign and date the ICF to 
confirm that informed consent was given.  
The original ICF must be retained by the investigator as part of the patient’s study record, and a 
copy of the signed ICF must be given to the patient’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s).  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk -benefit assessment, the ICF 
must be reviewed and updated  appropriately. All study patients and their parent(s) or legal 
guardian(s) must be informed of the new information and provide their written consent if they wish 
the patient to continue in the study. The original, signed revised ICF must be maintained in the 
patient’s study record and a copy must be given to the patient’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s).  
13.3. Patient Confidentiality and Data Protection
